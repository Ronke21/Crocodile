<text>Peggy Mitchell (also Butcher) is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot;. Peggy was initially played by Jo Warne when she first appeared in the episode broadcast on 30 April 1991, featuring in 10 episodes. Peggy was reintroduced in 1994, recast to Barbara Windsor, who made her first appearance in the episode broadcast on 7 November 1994. Peggy became a regular character, and Windsor played the role until she was forced to take a long break due to poor health and departed on 23 May 2003. She returned for two episodes broadcast on 16 and 17 September 2004, before rejoining as a regular character on 8 September 2005. Windsor announced in October 2009 that she would be leaving the show and departed on 10 September 2010. Windsor returned to the show for guest appearances on 20 September 2013, 25 September 2014, 17 February 2015 (as part of the show&#x27;s 30th anniversary celebrations) and 15 January 2016. She then appeared in six episodes between 9 and 17 May 2016, where the character was killed off. Her voice is last heard in the following episode, on 19 May 2016. Peggy&#x27;s funeral aired on 4 July 2016. An archived recording of her voice was heard on 25 January 2022. On 26 July 2022, it was announced that Peggy would feature in a flashback episode set in 1979, alongside her husband Eric and their children Phil, Grant and Sam. Jaime Winstone played the role of Peggy for this special episode, which aired on 5 September 2022. She returned again in 2025 to appear as part of a mental health storyline for Phil and she made a guest appearance on 13 February. 

Peggy is fiercely protective of her family and the Mitchell name, and is famous for her catchphrase &quot;Get outta my pub!&quot;, used when ejecting people from The Queen Victoria during her reign as the landlady. Her storylines have included a series of failed romances, most notably a non-lasting marriage with established character Frank Butcher (Mike Reid) and then a short-lived wedding to her brother-in-law Archie Mitchell (Larry Lamb). She has also been central to several plotlines revolving around health issues; launching a hate campaign against the HIV positive character Mark Fowler (Todd Carty) before later going on to make amends with him when she is later diagnosed with breast cancer, which she recovers from; a longstanding feud with daughter-in-law Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean); an on-off rivalry and companionship with her frenemy Pat Evans (Pam St Clement); and clashing with many villains such as Frank&#x27;s troublesome daughter Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks) and gangland boss Johnny Allen (Billy Murray). It was then Peggy&#x27;s final storyline saw her cancer return in May 2016, which ultimately leads to the character being killed-off when she commits suicide.

==Creation==
Peggy was introduced as a guest character in April 1991, by executive producer Michael Ferguson. The character was brought in as the mother of the already established Mitchell clan: Phil (Steve McFadden), Grant (Ross Kemp) and Sam (Danniella Westbrook). Specifically, she played a key role in a storyline about the elopement of her daughter Sam with Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen). Peggy was played by actress Jo Warne for a period of three months, but was written out upon the completion of the storyline. Two other actresses had been cast in the part before Warne: the first quit before she could film any scenes, and the second, Frances Cuka (who had appeared in the &quot;EastEnders&quot; prequel &quot;CivvyStreet&quot;), filmed eight episodes, though all of her scenes were scrapped before broadcast.

The character did not make another appearance until 7 November 1994, when she was reintroduced by series producer Barbara Emile as a regular character. The actress was recast, the role being taken over by Barbara Windsor, already well known to viewers as a comic actress, notably appearing in the long-running &quot;Carry On&quot; films. Scott Matthewman of &quot;The Stage&quot; commented on the recast in 2006: &quot;Quite the biggest – and most inexplicable – transformation is that of Peggy Mitchell in &quot;EastEnders&quot;. While Barbara Windsor has dominated the role...first appearing in [1994], the character had appeared briefly [three] years earlier, played by Jo Warne, a lady who physically is as different from our Babs as it&#x27;s possible to get.&quot;

Steve McFadden and Ross Kemp had attempted to persuade &quot;EastEnders&quot; writer Tony Jordan to develop a spin-off for their characters, which would star Windsor as Peggy. The idea never advanced beyond informal discussions, but when the producers decided to reintroduce Peggy, McFadden and Kemp suggested Windsor play her. Windsor had previously expressed a desire to join the cast of &quot;EastEnders&quot;. Chat show host Chris Evans of Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot; made a public broadcast instructing viewers to fax or phone the BBC with pleas for Windsor&#x27;s instatement. However, Windsor was already in negotiations with the BBC about appearing in the serial. June Deitch, the &quot;EastEnders&quot; casting director, had met with Windsor to discuss the matter, and was convinced when Windsor declared that she would &quot;like to play my own age for a change&quot;. At the time, the producers had already thought about reintroducing Peggy, and Windsor was cast despite originally being considered too &quot;well-known&quot;. Windsor has spoken of her &quot;terrified&quot; reaction to being asked to audition, commenting: &quot;I had the weekend to prepare and I cried all the time. I didn&#x27;t know how to do soap acting. I was so used to using my hands, my eyes.&quot; She auditioned with two scenes, one emotion, one &quot;jolly&quot; which Windsor has described as &quot;agony&quot;, explaining: &quot;I was afraid of playing Barbara Windsor, so when I had to laugh I went &#x27;huh, huh&#x27;. Anything rather than &#x27;tee, hee, hee&#x27;.&quot; In an interview with the &quot;Walford Gazette&quot;, a US-based newspaper dedicated to &quot;EastEnders&quot;, Windsor commented on her casting: &quot;I was thrilled, I could rest my tired bones working on a marvelous television show that I deeply respected. I was very excited about the possibility [of] playing this feisty lady who would come in and shake up her two boys&#x27; lives.&quot;

Windsor has been described as the biggest &quot;name&quot; that &quot;EastEnders&quot; has ever added to its cast, and her arrival came at a time in the show&#x27;s history that has been branded its &quot;worst creative period&quot;. Mark Lawson for &quot;The Independent&quot; wrote that Windsor&#x27;s casting was intended to combat low ratings, commenting: &quot;The Windsor initiative seems to be a direct response to suggestions that &quot;EastEnders&quot; has become too gloomy: a view heavily advanced by Roy Hattersley, former deputy leader of the Labour Party, and fan of the BBC series&#x27; rival on ITV, &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. Certainly, Miss Windsor has been associated throughout her career with the lighter touch.&quot; According to Windsor, 27 million viewers watched her first appearance as Peggy on-screen. Mark Lawson for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; has stated that five million extra viewers watched her first scenes, reporting that initially: &quot;The critics said that she lacked the &#x27;brassiness and vulnerability&#x27; for soap acting and that, stripped of her bubbly image, &#x27;nothing much of interest was revealed&#x27;. Ironically, viewers complained that she was too upmarket.&quot; Windsor has commented of the impact of her pre-existing celebrity status:

===Characterisation===

Hilary Kingsley, author of &quot;The EastEnders Handbook&quot; (1991), has described Peggy as tough, with a &quot;knack for getting her own way&quot;. She adds, &quot;Peggy likes to think she looks much younger [than she is]. She&#x27;s flash, fast-talking and nobody&#x27;s fool. She has always done things her own way, and heaven help anyone who crosses her, though her bark&#x27;s usually worse than her bite.&quot;

When Windsor took over the role in 1994, she was unhappy with the way Peggy was being scripted. She has commented, &quot;a few things weren&#x27;t quite right about Peggy at the beginning. On a purely superficial level, the wig didn&#x27;t fit right. And the clothes weren&#x27;t right either. They appeared too downmarket. I was particularly worried about how the character was viewed by the producer and writers. I saw her as much ballsier than they did. I think they envisioned Peggy as this rather sad, vulnerable lady who spent all her time worrying about her children.&quot; However, early in 1995, &quot;EastEnders&quot; acquired a new executive producer, Corinne Hollingworth, who shared Windsor&#x27;s vision of Peggy. It was Hollingworth who decided that Peggy would be a central character, the new landlady of The Queen Victoria public house, one of the soap&#x27;s main focal points. Hollingworth stated that Peggy was &quot;not going to be allowed to just sit in some flat polishing her nails&quot;. Windsor has said: &quot;It was like a dream. [Hollingworth] let me go out with the costume designer and choose Peggy&#x27;s wardrobe, which needed to be a lot more flash and upmarket. Corinne and I worked on getting Peggy right and I finally began to believe...&quot;.

Windsor has described Peggy as &quot;from the old school, the generation which doesn&#x27;t put up with rubbish from anybody...She can get through practically anything because she&#x27;s tough, tough, tough.&quot; The character has been classified by Rupert Smith, author of &quot;EastEnders: 20 Years in Albert Square&quot;, as a matriarch, assuming &quot;papal infallibility. Whatever anybody does — particularly her own children — she knows better.&quot; She has also been branded a &quot;battleaxe&quot; by Dave West of entertainment website Digital Spy, and someone who &quot;wears her heart on her sleeve&quot; by Windsor. Family-orientated, Windsor adds that: &quot;[Peggy] loves her family with a passion. Her worst qualities are that she&#x27;s blinkered, sometimes wrongly passionate about her family.&quot;

It has been speculated that Windsor based Peggy on Violet Kray, mother of the infamous East End gangsters, the Kray twins; however Windsor has denied this. Instead, she claims that Peggy is based on women she has seen in East End pubs and her own mother: &quot;women whose hair is great and their outfits are more Walthamstow market, they get it wrong slightly...Some things I&#x27;ve done with Peggy is from my Mum. She was one of those East End snobs. I drew on all of those experiences.&quot; In a 2009 radio interview with Dale Winton, Windsor said three people have influenced her portrayal of Peggy: Violet Kray (thus retracting her earlier statement), her own mother, and the actor Mike Reid, who played her on-screen husband Frank Butcher.

==Development==
Peggy has been central to numerous high-profile storylines, including a battle with breast cancer, a failed marriage to Frank Butcher, and various business and family upsets.

===Breast cancer===
In 1996, Peggy featured in a storyline about breast cancer. It was the first time that the soap had given one of its characters the illness, though the issue was covered much less substantially in 1987 as a means of promoting breast cancer screening, when Sue Osman (Sandy Ratcliff) discovered a lump on her breast, which turned out to be benign.

Peggy&#x27;s breast cancer storyline was devised at the suggestion of a scriptwriter in a story conference session and, according to the production staff, was an idea &quot;that had been knocking about for a long time.&quot; In Lesley Henderson&#x27;s book, &quot;Social Issues in Television Fiction&quot;, an &quot;EastEnders&quot; researcher explains that: &quot;A lot of illnesses [...] translate quite readily into strong dramatic material&quot;, and the experience of being hospitalised or waiting on test results is something everyone can identify with. The programme sought expert advice on &quot;storyline visuals&quot; from a variety of sources including cancer organisations, breast cancer charities and medical professionals. There were anticipated problems with running a breast cancer story, such as timing, characterisation, casting, and interweaving the plot with other ongoing storylines. A story editor has explained: &quot;&quot;EastEnders&quot; is perceived as being an issue-led show, but it isn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s character and story-led [...] If you haven&#x27;t got the character to fulfill that storyline then it won&#x27;t work. You&#x27;ve got to be careful to make sure that the illness actually impacts on the family dynamics and the character development.&quot;

Producers decided to use Peggy in the breast cancer storyline, conforming to a soap opera tradition of reserving strong roles for a firmly established middle-aged matriarch. The audience were familiar with Peggy&#x27;s history, knew that her first husband had died from cancer, consequently making her fear hospitals, and she had: &quot;the right mentality for [the story theme], which was about &#x27;a woman who discovers a lump and then refuses to accept that anything&#x27;s wrong&#x27;. An added factor was that in choosing Peggy the programme could avoid appearing too issue driven, and [the] storyline could be used as a device to expand and develop her characterisation.&quot; Additionally, as the causes of breast cancer are not attributable to risky behaviour, the disease was deemed &quot;more attractive&quot; in storyline terms. A member of the &quot;EastEnders&quot; production team explains:

In the view of the production team, Peggy&#x27;s breast cancer was a catalyst, creating new dynamics and tensions amongst existing characters. Realism was also an issue. As a middle-aged woman, Peggy was epidemiologically at higher risk for developing breast cancer. In 2001, it was reported that Peggy&#x27;s character was one of only a few media portrayals of older females to be given the disease, and source organisations have praised &quot;EastEnders&quot; for this.

The storyline used elements of suspense, created by the use of &quot;shared secrets&quot; between Peggy and her daughter-in-law Tiffany Mitchell (Martine McCutcheon), who invented elaborate cover stories to mask Peggy&#x27;s trips to hospital from her sons and partner. Tension was deliberately built for viewing pleasure, posing the questions of whether Peggy&#x27;s lump was benign or malignant and whether she would die, but also in terms of Peggy&#x27;s relationships, whether her children would discover the truth or if George would end their relationship. Henderson has suggested that: &quot;such devises [added] pathos to Peggy&#x27;s treatment path. Audiences [knew] that she [was] terrified and about to discover her biopsy results, but must watch as she is casually castigated by her son Grant for pestering his wife Tiffany to accompany her to &#x27;the dentist&#x27;.&quot; Hospital scenes were also played for narrative pace to build tension and drama.

Because &quot;radical, body-altering&quot; surgery on a long-running character would cause the production team ongoing problems with continuity, it was decided that Peggy would have a &quot;less visible&quot; lumpectomy, rather than a mastectomy. A member of the &quot;EastEnders&quot; production team explained: &quot;We have to think about costume and what it&#x27;s going to look like afterwards and what we&#x27;re lumbering ourselves with [...] you have to think of that for a long-term character.&quot; Additionally, giving Peggy a lumpectomy at that stage of her disease was viewed favourably by source organisations, as it helped to spread a message that a mastectomy is not necessary in all breast cancer cases. However, the storyline was revisited several times over the next few years. In August 1997, Peggy was given the &quot;all-clear&quot; at her follow-up mammogram, and in March 1999 the cancer returned and she underwent a mastectomy, while in 2000 she had a breast reconstruction. It has been reported that Peggy was the first soap opera character to undergo a mastectomy. BBC Production chief executive Matthew Bannister praised Windsor&#x27;s portrayal of Peggy coming to terms with a mastectomy, commenting: &quot;It&#x27;s brought a good deal of comfort and help to us and a lot of other people.&quot;

Oncology nurses and consultants were involved in the development of the storyline, which was based on a real life case study. In Clive Seale&#x27;s book, &quot;Health and the Media&quot;, &quot;EastEnders&quot; was praised for putting its message across without being &quot;gruelling&quot;. It has also been praised for showing &quot;potent scenes&quot; of a woman coming to terms with her diagnosis, scenes that also provided &quot;rare opportunities&quot; to portray a cancer patient &quot;behaving badly&quot; and depicting &quot;ambivalent feelings (such as denial or anger)&quot; — as it had been noted that cancer patients are typically portrayed in the media as &quot;beatific, serene figures&quot;. When Peggy had a mastectomy, hundreds of viewers wrote to the BBC to thank producer, Matthew Robinson for tackling &quot;a difficult subject so sensitively&quot;. However, not all viewers were impressed with the storyline. Felicity Smart, who had undergone a mastectomy, wrote to the BBC on behalf of the Breast Carer Support Group at St Thomas&#x27; Hospital in London to say that emotionally the storyline &quot;hit the spot&quot;, but medically it was &quot;hopelessly inaccurate&quot; as according to Smart: &quot;No one pulls pints and wisecracks with customers three days after having a mastectomy.&quot;

===Marriage to Frank Butcher===
In 1998, Peggy was romantically paired on-screen with the character Frank Butcher (Mike Reid). Their coupling was part of producer Matthew Robinson&#x27;s plan to place the focus of the soap back on to the Butcher and Mitchell families, while various other long-running characters were axed following a decline in ratings. The soap was attracting 15.74 million viewers in May 1998, as opposed to rival soap &quot;Coronation Street&#x27;s&quot; 16 million.

Played by Mike Reid, Frank had been a regular character in the serial from 1987 to 1994, and had appeared in a recurring role until 1998, when Reid agreed to return full-time. Frank&#x27;s history on the show included a former marriage to another long-running matriarch, Pat Butcher (Pam St. Clement). Their history as lovers featured prominently in Peggy&#x27;s narrative in 1998, when, after agreeing to marry Frank, Peggy was wrongly told that Frank and Pat were having an affair. A special two-hander episode aired in November 1998, featuring only Pat and Peggy for the entire duration. It concentrated on Peggy&#x27;s reaction to the suspected affair, whilst simultaneously addressing Pat&#x27;s unresolved history with Frank and the apparent destruction of Pat&#x27;s own marriage to Roy (Tony Caunter), who had also responded badly to the rumours about his wife&#x27;s infidelity. The episode, written by Tony Jordan, featured what the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; described as one of &quot;the most vicious fights ever filmed by a soap&quot;, with both throwing glasses at one another and Pat slapping Peggy across the face exclaiming &quot;You bitch!&quot; and Peggy responding by slapping Pat exclaiming &quot;You cow!&quot;. According to press reports, the fight scene between the characters was &quot;so powerful that it had to have scenes and dialogue cut so it could be screened before the 9 pm watershed.&quot; Barbara Windsor was reportedly bruised during the filming. Windsor commented, &quot;The writer didn&#x27;t want a namby- pamby cat fight between two silly girls. We were throwing chairs and bottles and the adrenaline was at a high. When I saw the programme I couldn&#x27;t believe how good it was. Pam and I were really proud.&quot; The &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; described it as: &quot;one of the most impressive episodes of all time&quot;. In the climax of the storyline, both couples resolved their differences, and their relationships remained intact.

Peggy and Frank were married on-screen on 1 April 1999. A &quot;hen night&quot; was thrown for Windsor with the show&#x27;s make-up team, and the BBC threw a &quot;massive&quot; party in the show&#x27;s Albert Square to celebrate the event. Actors Windsor and Reid joined fellow stars, celebrities and TV executives for a celebration on the programme&#x27;s set in Elstree, Hertfordshire. Windsor admitted she had been so nervous before filming the wedding she was sick on set. She commented, &quot;I broke out in spots and threw up in the vestry. I was very nervous – we were both very nervous. The day you stop getting nervous you can hold your hands up. It shows you care.&quot; The soap wedding was filmed in Harrow, North West London in February 1999. A BBC spokesman commented: &quot;It is one of the best weddings Walford has ever seen but it is not problem free. There are a lot of people who do not want to see Frank and Peggy married – Grant being one of them – and it remains to be seen whether they will get through the day without a major upset. And as if the wedding is not gripping enough, there are certainly shocking revelations back at the Vic.&quot; In the eventual episode, it was actually Grant Mitchell who persuaded his mother to marry Frank – with whom he had been feuding following his accidental killing of wife Tiffany – after Peggy was having second thoughts, thinking that Frank was only marrying her out of pity. Nearly 20 million viewers watched Peggy and Frank marry.

Together Frank and Peggy ran The Queen Victoria, and were involved in various family and business crises, including a &quot;tug-of-war&quot; for their public house with &quot;cuckoo-in-the-nest&quot; Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass). After taking time off in 2000 due to ill-health, Reid announced that he was quitting the soap in May 2000. After Reid publicly declared that he would love Frank to have a last fling with Pat before he left, &quot;EastEnders&quot;&#x27; bosses granted his wish and an affair was scripted. The pair enjoyed a liaison on a Spanish beach during a week-long August special set on the Costa Blanca, which saw Frank and Peggy go away with Pat and Roy and Terry and Irene Raymond (Gavin Richards and Roberta Taylor). A BBC spokesperson said: &quot;Pat is obviously incredibly torn between her love for her husband, Roy, and her old feelings for Frank. She&#x27;s been hurt by Frank in the past, but she&#x27;s coming to realise that she still has strong feelings for him and he has made no secret of his soft spot for her. I can confirm they do enjoy a romantic kiss on the beach.&quot; On-screen, Pat and Frank&#x27;s affair continued until they decided, in November 2000, to elope. In the specially extended episode marking Frank&#x27;s official exit — which aired on 2 November 2000, but was Guy Fawkes Night in the on-screen events – Peggy discovered the affair amidst Frank&#x27;s attempt to retrieve a letter of confession, following Pat&#x27;s change of heart.

After revealing their deception to a busy Queen Victoria public house, Peggy slapped both Pat and Frank, rebuffed Frank&#x27;s attempt at reconciliation and left him to depart alone. In December 2000, Ian Hyland of the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; voted the scene in which Peggy slaps both Pat and Frank as one of the &quot;TV fights of the year&quot;, saying &quot;It was Peggy&#x27;s speech which really made it a Bonfire Night to remember. But the slaps were equally well dispatched.&quot; Commenting on Reid&#x27;s exit, Windsor has said, &quot;We fell out when I found out he was leaving because it was a shock for me. I was really upset. I&#x27;ve known him 30 odd years and I really like working with him. We had a great relationship as friends as well as performers. I got my own back when I had to slap him after I found out he was fooling around with Pat. I did the slap twice as I didn&#x27;t think I did it hard enough the first time.&quot;

===Sabbatical===

Peggy was written out of &quot;EastEnders&quot; in 2003, sent to live in Rio de Janeiro with her son Grant for two years, while Windsor took a sabbatical from the show after being diagnosed with the Epstein-Barr virus. Windsor had previously never taken more than two weeks leave annually during her eight years on the show, as Peggy was considered such a central character to the series. Windsor&#x27;s absence was originally only supposed to be a year long. She stated at the time: &quot;This has been a very hard decision for me to make because I&#x27;m so happy here on &quot;EastEnders&quot; but it&#x27;s been a long time without a proper break. I just feel some time off would be good for me and for the character too.&quot; Louise Berridge, then &quot;EastEnders&quot;&#x27; executive producer, commented: &quot;Barbara has been an absolute trouper for more than eight years on this show. We hope she has a great time and look forward to bringing her back with a big story in 2004.&quot;

Although Peggy did return briefly in 2004 to attend her daughter Sam&#x27;s wedding to Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs), it was not until 2005 that she resumed her role as a series regular. Her full return was announced in January 2005, with John Yorke, the BBC controller of continuing drama series, stating he was &quot;delighted&quot; as &quot;[Peggy] is a hugely loved character and one we think will be stirring things up from the moment she steps back into Walford.&quot; Windsor said that she was &quot;over the moon&quot; to return, adding: &quot;I had a great time when I came back to film for a couple of weeks recently. It really reminded me that the square is where I feel at home.&quot; BBC executives hoped that Peggy&#x27;s return would help to revive &quot;EastEnders&quot;&#x27; ratings. Her absence coincided with a two-year ratings slump for &quot;EastEnders&quot;, with David Liddiment in &quot;The Guardian&quot; drawing direct correlation between her return and the show&#x27;s &quot;ratings rejuvenation&quot;. The episode in which she returned was watched by 10 million viewers, winning &quot;EastEnders&quot; a 47% audience share in the timeslot.

===Relationship with Archie Mitchell; running for local government===
In March 2008, the BBC announced that Larry Lamb had been cast as Archie Mitchell, the brother of Peggy&#x27;s late husband Eric. Archie was scripted as a love-interest for Peggy and Peggy&#x27;s backstory was retconned to incorporate a romantic history with Archie. Portrayed as an adulterous villain, Archie began controlling Peggy, changing her clothing and her hair style and instructing her on how to behave.

In 2009 Peggy ran as an independent candidate in the local council elections against Archie&#x27;s wishes. Writers wanted a storyline that allowed Peggy to stand up for her beliefs, and felt that running for local government would allow her to speak passionately about the community. After a scene showed Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks) asking Peggy, &quot;Where would Tony Blair have been without Alastair Campbell?&quot;, Campbell responded by giving advice to Peggy in a video blog. A response from Peggy was then recorded, thanking Campbell for his input. Peggy pulled out of the election at Archie&#x27;s request ahead of their wedding, however the storyline set up a later episode in which Boris Johnson made a guest appearance in &quot;EastEnders&quot;. On 1 October 2009, Johnson appeared in the show as himself, visiting Walford and The Queen Victoria and conversing with Peggy. Johnson commented on his appearance: &quot;It was, of course, a tremendous honour to step inside that most venerable of London landmarks, The Queen Vic, and share a scene with another of the capital&#x27;s icons, the fabulous Barbara Windsor.&quot; Executive producer Diederick Santer stated: &quot;We couldn&#x27;t let the visit pass without the Mayor entering London&#x27;s most famous pub, The Queen Vic, and meeting its formidable and politically active landlady Peggy Mitchell.&quot; The episode was watched by 8 million viewers, winning &quot;EastEnders&quot; a 38% audience share in the timeslot.

Peggy and Archie&#x27;s wedding was filmed on location in North London in January 2009 and was screened on 2 April 2009 that year in an hour-long special. To promote the storyline, &quot;EastEnders&quot; screened a trailer showing Peggy being assembled in her wedding outfit by a robot, which symbolised Archie&#x27;s control of her. Realising the extent to which Archie had been controlling and trying to change her throughout their engagement, Peggy gave him an ultimatum at the altar: he either accept the real her, or call the wedding off. Archie chose to marry her, though Tim Teeman for &quot;The Times&quot; commented: &quot;&#x27;[T]he real Peggy&#x27; is a hazy concept: there’s Peggy the big-hearted East End landlady and Peggy the crone famous for rasping &#x27;Get ahht my pub&#x27; to anyone who crosses her path. For someone into evil mind control, Archie has brilliant taste. The wedding outfit he had chosen for Peggy was much nicer than the tatty net curtains that even Miss Havisham would have rejected that the &#x27;real Peggy&#x27; chose to marry in.&quot; Peggy and Archie&#x27;s wedding was watched by 10.6 million viewers, winning &quot;EastEnders&quot; a 48% audience share. A further 1.2 million viewers watched the episode&#x27;s repeat on BBC Three at 10 pm. However, the marriage lasts only as long as the reception; when Peggy realises Archie has been manipulating other members of his family, Peggy throws him out and a feud ignites between Archie and the Mitchell clan.

Peggy resumes her plan to run for council in 2010, but is furious to discover that Pat is also running. The storyline introduces the character of Harvey Freeman, played by Martin Jarvis, a freelance journalist who is reporting on the election. Harvey is a potential love interest for both Peggy and Pat, and causes friction between the friends.

===2010 departure===

On 28 October 2009 it was announced that Windsor had quit the show and would leave in 2010 after 15 years. She said: &quot;&quot;EastEnders&quot; has been wonderful to me and it&#x27;s no secret that it changed my life all of those years ago. I&#x27;ll be so sad to leave Peggy behind; she&#x27;s such a wonderful character to play. I have had the pleasure of working with a marvellous cast and crew and have made many lasting good friends. To have had the honour of showing the Queen around the set is something that will stay with me forever.&quot; Executive producer Diederick Santer said: &quot;Barbara has contributed so much to &quot;EastEnders&quot; over the last 15 years, plus countless episodes, and countless amazing storylines. Peggy Mitchell is a truly iconic character, and along with Steve McFadden and Ross Kemp, Barbara has made the Mitchells the premier family of British soap.&quot; Windsor filmed her final scene on 16 July 2010. Peggy&#x27;s final episode, which aired on 10 September 2010, was preceded by a number of television trailers in August and a new section on the &quot;EastEnders&quot; website dedicated to the character. The episode ended with a special reworking of the piano version of the &quot;EastEnders&quot; theme tune known as &quot;Julia&#x27;s Theme&quot;, called &quot;Peggy&#x27;s Theme&quot;. Tribute was then paid to her in a clip programme, Peggy Mitchell: Queen of the Vic. Peggy&#x27;s final episode attracted 10.1 million viewers, and was the second most-watched programme in the week of 6–12 September.

At the recording of the new series of &quot;The Rob Brydon Show&quot; for BBC Two, Brydon asked if Windsor would consider returning, to which Windsor replied, &quot;Never say never&quot;.

===Breast cancer return and death===
After making three separate returns in September 2013, September 2014 and another in February 2015 to commemorate 30 years of &quot;EastEnders&quot; during Live Week, Windsor made an unannounced return to &quot;EastEnders&quot; on 15 January 2016. After this, it was announced that the character was to be killed off, losing her battle with breast cancer. The scenes were filmed in secret in November 2015, following Windsor&#x27;s personal decision for Peggy to be killed. She said: &quot;Peggy is a character close to my heart but I made the decision a while ago that I need to say goodbye to Peggy once and for all as otherwise she will always be there, urging me to go back and that is something I need to shut the door on. After thinking long and hard about it, I realised that it is time for me and the audience to say our final farewells to the lady who I have loved for many years and I thought that whilst [executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins], who I adore, is still in charge I want him to be the one to oversee it. I am grateful that Dominic has accepted my decision and together, since late last summer, we have been secretly plotting Peggy’s last scenes.&quot;

Treadwell-Collins said, &quot;when [Windsor] told me her decision back in the summer [2015], we both had a little cry before getting excited about how Peggy Mitchell, the matriarch to end all matriarchs could bid her final farewell to Albert Square. In Peggy Mitchell, Barbara has created one of the greatest ever characters on British television, someone who has become as synonymous with &quot;EastEnders&quot; as The Queen Vic itself. So this is the end of an &quot;EastEnders&quot; era. But it is also an opportunity to send Peggy Mitchell out in style in what will be one of the most heartbreaking, uplifting and epic exits an &quot;EastEnders&quot; character has ever had. We can&#x27;t wait to have Barbara back at &quot;EastEnders&quot;, even if it is for the final time. The most professional of professionals on set and off, and a true friend, we have all been working harder than ever to make Barbara and Peggy Mitchell proud.&quot; Windsor resumed filming on 21 March 2016.
On 3 May 2016, it was revealed that Peggy would refuse treatment and decide to spend time with her family. Windsor said it was a &quot;special week&quot; of episodes with &quot;lots of surprises&quot; that would be &quot;a perfect ending for Peggy&quot;. Peggy&#x27;s final scenes aired on 17 May 2016; however, her voice was heard in the following episode, which aired on 19 May 2016.

On 25 January 2022, the voice of Peggy is heard by Phil, who is contemplating whether to become an informant for the police, or spend the rest of his life behind bars. Phil hears Peggy&#x27;s voice, telling him “Phil, you gotta get out there and defend what&#x27;s yours” and “You&#x27;re surrounded by people who love you, just try to love yourself…”. Due to Windsor&#x27;s death in December 2020, Peggy&#x27;s soundbites were taken from archive footage from previous episodes.

==Storylines==
===Backstory===
Peggy married Eric Mitchell (George Russo) because she was pregnant with their son Phil (Steve McFadden). Eric grew to be a keen boxer and he soon ended up working for his gangland boss, Johnny Allen (Billy Murray). This impacted the marriage as Johnny constantly taunted Eric, making him do demeaning jobs because Eric was a better boxer than him. Eric fell in love with a glamorous woman called Maureen Loftus and planned to elope with her, but he changed his mind at the last minute – unable to desert his family, who he grew to resent. Eric took his anger out on Peggy and was often violent towards her and Phil. The abuse eventually ended when Peggy told the police that Eric was involved in a Post office robbery and he was sent to prison. Peggy considered leaving when her sons, Phil and Grant (Ross Kemp) were teenagers, and once even tried to seduce Johnny, but he turned her down. It was then Eric had cheated on Peggy with Claudette Hubbard (Ellen Thomas), who he also intended to run away with, but he changed his mind again – leading to Claudette hating the entire family. Soon afterwards, Peggy turned to Eric&#x27;s older brother Archie (Larry Lamb) for comfort because he was there for Peggy when Eric began to abuse her. She tried to save her marriage by having another child in 1975 – her only daughter Samantha (Danniella Westbrook; Kim Medcalf). Her relationship with Eric improved, but only temporarily, and when Kevin Masters (Colin McCormack) employed Peggy to work at his minicab firm, they ended up having a secret affair. When Eric developed prostate cancer, Peggy gave up work to care for him until he eventually died in 1985. Following Eric&#x27;s death, Kevin acquainted himself with Peggy once more and her children grew to harbour resentment towards him.

===1991===
Peggy makes her first appearance in Albert Square when her son, Grant, decides to reenlist with the army and returns when her daughter Sam&#x27;s desire to escape from her family causes her to elope with Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen), at the age of sixteen. Peggy, along with Kevin, tries to persuade Sam that getting married at the age of sixteen will ruin her life, but she is unsuccessful. Peggy later accepts Sam and Ricky&#x27;s relationship and leaves, after giving the couple her blessing.

===1994–2010===
Peggy is not seen for three years, during which time her relationship with Kevin ends. She returns to Walford when her sons fall out after Phil&#x27;s affair with Grant&#x27;s wife, Sharon Mitchell (Letitia Dean), is revealed. Peggy becomes acting landlady of The Queen Victoria public house and blames Sharon for the affair. Peggy tries to force her out of Walford, resulting in Sharon signing over her share of the pub and leaving the Mitchell family as the sole owners, with Peggy in charge.

Peggy starts dating businessman George Palmer (Paul Moriarty), unaware that he is a gangster involved in illegal money laundering. She also instigates a hate campaign against local resident Mark Fowler (Todd Carty) when she discovers he is HIV positive, and in doing so clashes with his mother Pauline (Wendy Richard) on several occasions. Peggy later realises she was wrong when she is diagnosed with breast cancer. She initially refuses surgery and ends things with George, fearing that he will not be able to handle her illness. However, supported by George and her family, she eventually has a lumpectomy. Peggy and George get engaged but their relationship ends when Phil reveals his illicit activities. Peggy goes on to date local car lot owner, Frank Butcher (Mike Reid), and they become engaged. Peggy has doubts about the wedding when her cancer returns and she has to have a mastectomy, but eventually decides to go through with it. Tension soon develops between Peggy and Phil when Grant leaves for Rio de Janeiro after a violent fight with his brother. To spite Peggy, Phil sells Grant&#x27;s share in the pub to his business partner Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass) for £5. The result of this causes Peggy to loathe Dan, and the two frequently argue over the running of The Queen Vic. At one point, Frank gets involved and punches Dan after the latter insults Frank&#x27;s daughter Janine (Charlie Brooks). Eventually, she and Phil call a truce and force Dan out of Walford. Peggy discovers Frank is planning to leave her for his ex-wife, Pat Evans (Pam St Clement), so she shames them by reading Frank&#x27;s Dear Jane letter to the entire pub and then slaps them both. She throws Frank out and he leaves Walford. Afterwards, Peggy becomes depressed and begins to rely heavily on tranquilisers. When Janine taunts her on Christmas Day about her father moving on, Peggy begins drinking heavily and smashes up the pub with a baseball bat. The next year, Peggy is forced to sell the pub as Frank left her in debt and is furious to discover that Sharon is the new owner.

By 2001, Peggy has begun dating Harry Slater (Michael Elphick); he is a relative of the newly-arrived Slater Family as well as being a womaniser who owns a bar in Spain. He soon convinces her to move there with him and they become engaged, but their romance abruptly ends when Peggy learns that Harry has sexually abused his niece Kat (Jessie Wallace) when she was 13; not only that, but Harry got Kat pregnant and is therefore the illegitimate father of her teenage daughter Zoe (Michelle Ryan), initially believed to be Kat&#x27;s youngest sister. When Phil begins dating Sharon again and becomes joint owner of The Queen Vic, Peggy moves back in. She later becomes sole licensee again when Sharon sells her half of the pub back to her. Peggy is briefly reunited with Frank when she travels to Spain to attend his funeral. She discovers he faked his own death to avoid creditors. While she&#x27;s in Spain, she shockingly finds Sam working as a lap dancer and takes her home. Peggy later decides to move to Brazil to be with Grant but visits Walford for Sam&#x27;s wedding to Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs) before returning to Brazil.

When Peggy returns to Walford in 2005, she is furious to discover Sam has lost possession of The Queen Vic – with the new licensee now being Sharon&#x27;s stepmother Chrissie (Tracy-Ann Oberman). Later on, Peggy learns from Sam that she is framed by Chrissie for the murder of the latter&#x27;s late husband Den Watts (Leslie Grantham). While trying to exonerate Sam and reclaim ownership of the pub, Peggy is surprised to learn that Johnny is now the square&#x27;s new gangland kingpin and the two establish a feud when he also wishes to buy The Queen Vic. Johnny hires a mobster to assault Peggy, but she is saved by her sons Phil and Grant at the last minute. They are able to deal with Johnny, secure Sam&#x27;s release from prison, and return Peggy to The Queen Vic. 

In 2006 Peggy starts dating Jack Edwards (Nicky Henson), the father-in-law of Peggy&#x27;s nephew Billy (Perry Fenwick). However, when Peggy discovers Billy&#x27;s newborn daughter Janet (Grace) has Down syndrome, she declares that the baby should be put up for adoption – causing friction in her relationship with Edwards as a result. Although Peggy eventually comes to accept the baby, Edwards breaks up with her and leaves Walford for good.

Just a few years later, Peggy finds herself reacquainted with Archie no sooner after his two daughters Ronnie (Samantha Womack) and Roxy (Rita Simons) arrive to live with her at the pub. She forms a relationship with him and the pair get engaged, although Archie quickly begins subtly controlling Peggy. They nonetheless get married, but it ends a few hours later when it is publicly transpires that Archie lied to Ronnie about her infant daughter&#x27;s death. Peggy has Archie evicted from The Queen Vic and attempts to have Phil kill him in revenge, but she is left furious when Phil doesn&#x27;t go through with it in the end. Peggy files for divorce and Archie plots revenge on the entire Mitchell family. When Peggy loses the bail surety she has paid on behalf of her daughter Sam, who breaks the conditions of her bail following coercion from Archie, the Mitchells are forced to use The Queen Vic to gain a collateral loan from Phil&#x27;s sworn arch-rival and estranged stepson Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) in order to surmount their debts. Archie thereafter uses Janine to blackmail Ian into selling him the loan, and when the Mitchells are unable to meet the loan repayment, Archie evicts them and assumes ownership of the pub. However, Archie is murdered on Christmas Day 2009 by an unknown assailant (see Who Killed Archie?). Peggy grieves for Archie, but she and various other members of her family become suspects for his murder. Following a police enquiry, local resident Bradley Branning (Charlie Clements) is posthumously found guilty of the murder, though unbeknownst to everyone, the actual murderer is Bradley&#x27;s wife Stacey Branning (Lacey Turner) after Archie raped her months ago. In his will, Archie leaves The Queen Vic to Roxy, who reinstates Peggy.

After being disgusted with the state of the Square and learning that a councillor has stood down, Peggy and Pat both decide to run for council and are interviewed by journalist Harvey Freeman (Martin Jarvis). Eventually they both pull out of the election, but Harvey hears of this and individually invites them both out. They both finally discover his two-timing, and humiliate him as punishment. When Phil prevents his daughter Louise (Brittany Papple) from contacting her mother Lisa Fowler (Lucy Benjamin) and shouts at her, Peggy interjects and Phil slaps her. Believing that her son is an unfit parent and fearing for Louise&#x27;s safety, Peggy takes Louise to Lisa against Phil&#x27;s wishes. Although Lisa promises to allow Phil visitation, she flees with Louise just as the Mitchells learn about this too late. Phil blames Peggy for the loss of his child and begins relapsing his alcoholism as well as developing a crack cocaine addiction. Peggy tries to stop Phil using crack by locking him in her pub, but Phil escapes and in a drunken bid for revenge, he sets fire to the pub (see Queen Vic Fire Week). Peggy watches in horror as it is destroyed. Realizing her role in Phil&#x27;s problems, Peggy decides to leave Walford for his sake. After saying tearful goodbyes to her family and making peace with Phil in a heartfelt conversation beteeen them, Peggy takes one last look at The Queen Vic and leaves Albert Square (which included her own version of the &quot;EastEnders&quot; theme tune, known as &quot;Peggy&#x27;s Theme&quot;).

===2013–2016===
In January 2012, Peggy misses Pat&#x27;s funeral as she is on a cruise, and in 2013, Phil visits Peggy in Cornwall with Ben&#x27;s baby daughter, Lexi Pearce (Dotti-Beau Cotterill). Three months later, Peggy flies into London to visit Phil in hospital, and encourages him to get rid of Carl White (Daniel Coonan) – an ex-conman who seeks to take over the Mitchell business empire. Afterwards, she visits Pat&#x27;s old house and leaves a bottle of gin on the doorstep as a way of saying goodbye. In September 2014, Peggy appears in Portugal, telling Ronnie to go back to Walford and stop Phil from marrying Sharon. In February 2015, Peggy returns to Albert Square to confront her old friend Dot Branning (June Brown), after Dot&#x27;s notoriously villainous son Nick Cotton (John Altman) cut the brakes on a car and falsely incriminated Phil. She learns from Dot that Nick has died, and comforts her and invites her to move in with her and Grant in Portugal. Peggy is also in on the secret that Ben&#x27;s mother and Phil&#x27;s ex-wife, Kathy Sullivan (Gillian Taylforth), had faked her own death nine years ago and wants to return to Walford. Before returning to Portugal, Peggy visits The Queen Vic and meets its new landlord, Mick Carter (Danny Dyer), who tells her to &quot;get out of my pub&quot; – which Peggy was known for saying as landlady.

In January 2016, Phil calls Peggy&#x27;s older sister Sal (Anna Karen) and wants to know Louise&#x27;s (now played by Tilly Keeper) address. When he soon goes to visit at her house, Peggy is there, having returned a week earlier. Peggy is disgusted to see that Phil has returned to alcoholism, but does give him Louise&#x27;s address. She then reveals her breast cancer has returned, and she is dying. Phil tries to admit that he has cirrhosis of the liver, but she refuses to see him again and he leaves. In May, Peggy turns up on Ronnie&#x27;s doorstep, and the next day Sal arrives with the news that Peggy&#x27;s chemotherapy is not working and she is dying. A hospital appointment confirms that Peggy&#x27;s cancer has spread to her brain and it is terminal. Peggy finally faces Phil, who is in recovery from his alcoholism, and admits she is dying. He is upset that she is refusing any more treatment, and takes her on a boat trip on the Thames, and back to their childhood home, to try to make her fight. However, Peggy is not convinced and asks Phil to help her die.

Sharon calls Grant back to Walford, and he persuades Phil not to help Peggy. She tells them both she will not kill herself. After talking with Dot and settling old feuds with Sharon and Stacey, and having one last drink at the Queen Vic, Peggy begins hallucinating the smell of cigarette smoke; this eventually manifests into a vision of Pat. As the two reminisce about past memories, Peggy states she still wants to commit suicide, as she wants everyone to remember her as a strong woman, and not see her deteriorate and eventually die. Upon being reassured by Pat that she will not leave her side, Peggy then commits suicide by taking an overdose of her pills. Phil is devastated to find her body, and a letter from her urges him to love himself as others love him. Peggy&#x27;s funeral takes place on 4 July 2016. Phil is due to give a eulogy, but gets too emotional and rushes home. Sharon later calms him down by revealing that Peggy was the one who had Eric sent to prison when Phil was a child, not corrupt police officers as he was previously told, and that she did it to protect him. Phil later works up the courage to finish his eulogy to Peggy at the wake, and then returns to her grave at the church to finish his goodbyes to her, unaware that Grant has secretly left a rose at the grave.

==Reception==
Peggy has been described by the BBC as one of &quot;EastEnders&quot;&#x27; &quot;most high-profile characters.&quot; Windsor has won several awards for her performance as Peggy. In 1999, she was named BBC Personality of the Year. She won Best Actress at the 1999 British Soap Awards, and was granted a Lifetime Achievement award in 2009. She also won a Lifetime Achievement award at the 2001 &quot;Inside Soap&quot; awards, and was named the UK&#x27;s top soap matriarch in a 2009 &quot;Inside Soap&quot; poll. She also won the Soap Legend award at the 2009 TV Now Awards. Furthermore, Windsor was nominated for the Outstanding Serial Drama Performance award at the 2008 and 2009 National Television Awards, Best Soap Actress at the 2007 TV Now Awards, Best Actress at the 2009 British Soap Awards, and Best Actress at the 2009 &quot;Inside Soap&quot; awards.

The character was viewed unfavourably by a proportion of viewers in 1996, when Peggy discovered that Mark Fowler (Todd Carty) was HIV positive and subsequently mounted a hate campaign against him. Windsor has since revealed that she was initially opposed to the storyline:

Actress and writer Jacquetta May, who played the character Rachel Kominski between 1991 and 1993, has discussed the storyline and the role of women in an article about &quot;EastEnders&quot;. According to May, the scriptwriters were faced with a problem once Peggy, &quot;a key figure of the community&quot;, was shown to exhibit such &quot;pig-headed ignorance and appalling prejudice&quot;. In order for Peggy to be redeemed, she had to be seen to be punished, and so the character was given breast-cancer later that year. May comments, &quot;Peggy, malicious gossip and bigot, herself becomes the victim of a life-threatening illness. At Christmas they run a Christian forgiveness story. Peggy calls on Mark and tells him she now knows what it is like to suffer as he has. She apologises, thus underlining one of the basic tenets of the programme: underneath the skin we are all the same, human and vulnerable, and recognition of this should unite us not divide us. Along the way, a great deal of useful information about these illnesses was broadcast. So, although &quot;EastEnders&quot; endlessly repeats its conservative format, and although all issues are there primarily to feed the great hungry story-beast, its positive by-products cannot be denied.&quot;

&quot;EastEnders&quot; has received praise for the handling of Peggy&#x27;s breast cancer storyline, as she was a rare media portrayal of an older matriarchal woman with the disease. Older women are at higher risk of being diagnosed; however, in 2001, it was reported that media representation of breast cancer is skewed towards younger women in their 20s or 30s, as they are seen as &quot;more tragic&quot; or &quot;more sexy&quot; in media terms. A 2000 study by Kitzinger and Henderson showed that 94% of newspaper coverage on non-celebrity women with breast cancer was on those aged under 50. Source organisations working with &quot;EastEnders&quot; on the storyline have commented: &quot;[The team] decided it was going to be [Peggy] and very rightly so. Bang on, the right age [...] perfect dramatic licence in terms of her sons that she was going to have to share this terrible news with, and how would she share it? Every female would have that problem. How would you tell your children? And they followed that with her. She was exactly the right person.&quot; The storyline also received media criticism, for the use of a breast care nurse, who was used to counsel Peggy and translate medical terminology into lay terms for viewers; a character who could provide both a dramatic and educational purpose. However, not all oncology units in the UK offer breast care nurses, and the character presented &quot;particularly positive messages&quot; concerning patient choice and control over treatment options. Because of this, the UK press dubbed the storyline &quot;didactic&quot;. The storyline was also criticised because Peggy received her cancer test results after six days, which prompted cancer charities to warn that not all patients would receive the same treatment.

In December 2008, Bupa doctors criticised UK soaps for presenting unhealthy role models to viewing audiences. Paul Bignell and Cole Moreton for &quot;The Independent&quot; refuted the accusation, naming Peggy as an acceptable role model for her devotion to her family, protecting her nieces and loving her sons despite their numerous misdemeanours. Peggy Mitchell&#x27;s (Barbara Windsor) 2010 departure was watched over 11 million viewers. A reporter writing for the &quot;Inside Soap Yearbook&quot; described Peggy&#x27;s death as &quot;heartbreaking&quot;. In 2
In a 2021 &quot;Radio Times&quot; poll, Peggy was voted as the second best &quot;soap pub landlord&quot;, receiving 13% of the votes.

==In popular culture==

Peggy has been spoofed in several programmes, including the ITV cartoon sketch show &quot;2DTV&quot;, and &quot;Harry Hill&#x27;s TV Burp&quot;. In the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Big Impression&quot;, impressionist Ronni Ancona performs as Peggy, shuffling around on her knees to exaggerate Barbara Windsor&#x27;s petite height, and regularly using the catchphrase &quot;Get outta my pub!&quot; Impressionist Jan Ravens has spoofed her in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Dead Ringers&quot;, also mimicking her cheeky laugh. Commenting on Ancona&#x27;s impersonation, Windsor has said: &quot;she does me brilliantly. I told her it was a great compliment. She made me realise my little hands wave around a lot.&quot;

In November 2005, Peggy appeared in a sketch for Children in Need, which was a crossover between &quot;EastEnders&quot; and &quot;The Catherine Tate Show&quot;. The sketch featured Peggy, Little Mo Mitchell (Kacey Ainsworth), Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner) and Catherine Tate as her character Lauren Cooper. The 2006 episode of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; titled &quot;Army of Ghosts&quot; features a fictional &quot;EastEnders&quot; scene in which Peggy tells the ghost of Den Watts to &quot;get outta my pub!&quot;

<text>slrn is a console-based news client for multiple operating systems, developed by John E. Davis and others. It was originally developed in 1994 for Unix-like operating systems and VMS, and now also supports Microsoft Windows. It supports scoring rules to highlight, sort or kill articles based on information from their header. It is customizable, allows free key-bindings and can be extended using the S-Lang macro language. Offline reading is possible by using either slrnpull (included with slrn) or a local newsserver (like leafnode or INN). slrn is free software.

slrn was maintained by Thomas Schultz from 2000 to 2007, with the help of others who made contributions, but development is now again followed by the original author, John E. Davis. Current development focuses on better support for different character sets and tighter integration of the S-Lang language processor. Version 1.0.0 of slrn was released on December 21, 2012, 18 years after the first release. The latest release is 1.0.3 on October 23, 2016. Historically slrn was the starting point for many Usenet users. slrn is still a compromise between features, resource usage and simplicity.

==Operation==
slrn is fully controlled with the keyboard, and new messages are composed with an external text editor.

== Name ==
The slrn name derives from the use of S-Lang and its function to read news.

<text>Mercy Corps is a global non-governmental, humanitarian aid organization operating in transitional contexts that have undergone, or have been undergoing, various forms of economic, environmental, social and political instabilities. The organization claims to have assisted more than 220 million people survive humanitarian conflicts, seek improvements in livelihoods, and deliver durable development to their communities.

Mercy Corps proposes a mission to &quot;alleviate suffering, poverty and oppression by helping people build secure, productive and just communities.&quot; As of August 2021, the organization reports to be operating within 38 countries, including Afghanistan, Central African Republic, Myanmar and Yemen, with programs focused in a number of humanitarian sectors ranging from conflict management, children &amp; youth to agriculture and food security.

== History ==
Originally established as the Save the Refugee Fund in 1979 to provide first hand post-conflict relief after the Cambodian genocide under the Pol Pot regime, the organization has since expanded its mandate to deliver humanitarian assistance. In 1982, the organization&#x27;s founders, Ellsworth Culver and Dan O&#x27;Neill, chose the name of Mercy Corps to represent the broader international activities of the organization that has since been focusing on delivering durable, long-term solutions to a range of humanitarian and development issues. The organization has been present in varying locations at different times – cumulatively, it reports to have delivered humanitarian assistance in 122 countries.

Mercy Corps delivered its first development program in Honduras in 1982. The program led to the establishment of the non-profit organization Project Global Village/Proyecto Aldea Global (PAG) in 1984 with a number of initiatives focused on development issues such as &quot;health &amp; HIV/AIDS prevention, domestic violence, education, agro-industrial development, microcredits, environmental development &amp; infrastructure.&quot; In the next decade following the formation of Mercy Corps, the organization would gradually expand its mandates into the broader international arena, stationing in countries including Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Jordan, Bosnia, Kosovo, North Korea, North Macedonia, China, Sudan, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Haiti.

Mercy Corps incorporated the Conflict Management Group founded by Roger Fisher in 2004. Three years later, it also moved to incorporate NetAid seeking to broaden its scope of youth engagement in fighting global poverty.

Its programs have gradually gained structural and facilitating consistency throughout the course of the organization&#x27;s development, ranging from long-term market system development programs, such as the Resilient Communities Program in Mongolia that would last until 2019, to short-term emergency response programs, such as the organization&#x27;s post-disaster relief initiatives in Puerto-Rico after Hurricane Maria in the months following September 2017.

==Scandal==
According to Ellsworth Culver&#x27;s daughter, Tanya Culver Humphrey, Culver sexually abused her from her early childhood until she was a teenager. Humphrey said that despite her repeatedly bringing the issue to the attention of Mercy Corps senior leadership, no action was taken beside moving Culver to another position in the organization. Following a 2019 documentary on the sexual abuse allegations released by &quot;the Oregonian&quot;, the leader of Mercy Corps, Neal Keny Guyer, as well as senior legal counsel, and a longtime board member resigned. Beth deHamel served as interim CEO and was succeeded by Tjada D&#x27;Oyen McKenna on 15 October 2020.

== Broad philanthropic strategies ==
Throughout the course of Mercy Corps&#x27; history in its deliverance of humanitarian programs, the organization&#x27;s focus in its overall operational strategies has seen substantial shifts. Starting as a non-government humanitarian aid organization specifically focused in the immediate humanitarian complexity of the refugee dilemma caused by the Cambodian genocide in 1979, the preceding incarnation of the organization, Save the Refugee Fund, focused on providing the means necessary to respond to first-hand emergencies of the grim implications of the genocide: short-term aids in food, water, shelter and other corresponding refugee assistance.

As Mercy Corps expanded its mandates and progressed into a large humanitarian aid organization with a notable international presence, it has also gradually transformed its main philanthropic focus from solely the deliverance of temporary assistance that contribute short-term impacts to the development of broader socio-economic infrastructures that encourage long-term improvements in the well-being of target beneficiaries. In a nutshell, Mercy Corps programs&#x27; main focus has transitioned from direct deliverance of emergency aid to long-term provision of assistance in improving community &quot;resilience&quot;. Through a presentation published by USAID, Mercy Corps defines &quot;resilience&quot; as: &quot;The capacity of communities in complex socio-ecological systems to learn, cope, adapt, and transform in the face of shocks and stresses.&quot;

To upkeep its new humanitarian focus on long-term community development, the phrase &quot;Market System Development&quot; has become one of the operational concepts of increasing importance for recent and upcoming Mercy Corps programs. Instead of focusing solely upon assisting one type of stakeholder within a community, the organization has dedicated increasing effort into engaging and all related actors and stakeholders in the complete market chain to participate in the improvement of the overall health of the targeted economic sector (agriculture, IT, pasture etc.) to eventually create a self-reliable operational market structure. Darius Radcliffe, the Country Director of Mercy Corps in Jordan, stated on 26 September 2023, that the organization will enhance diverse, dynamic economic opportunities that foster sustainable and comprehensive growth in Jordan while also improving water and energy management practices.

== Mercy Corps International ==
Mercy Corps International is the organization&#x27;s main branch of operation. It focuses on resolving humanitarian and development challenges currently faced by societies in countries of unstable, transitional backgrounds. Mercy Corps International is commonly considered to be a leading organization in its field, contributing &quot;close to 94 percent of its resources to the most vulnerable areas in the world.&quot; With primary focuses on disaster relief and capacity building, the organization has also been integrating long-term civil society and human rights initiatives into their humanitarian programs, delivering notable funds and resources to target states of operation. The organization has been gradually expanding its general mandates, and they mainly revolve around 14 main objectives:

=== Main operational objectives ===

In 38 countries ranging from the Democratic Republic Congo, Haiti and Guatemala to Tajikistan, Afghanistan and Mongolia, Mercy Corps reportedly designs and delivers both temporary and long-term humanitarian assistance programs that are predominantly funded by other partnering international donor institutions. Some of the partnering donors include:

=== Partnering donor institutions ===
Mercy Corps accepts contributions from both individual and institutional donors. For instance, the organization received a combined operational grant of more than US$13 million from the United States Agency for International Development&#x27;s 2016 Emergency Food Security Program in post-Ebola recovery in Liberia and conflict response in Yemen.
== Mercy Corps Northwest ==
Mercy Corps Northwest operates domestically within the United States with focuses in primary economic development. It mainly aims to stimulate business growth opportunities for individuals and communities in the states of Oregon and Washington. Through different community development programs, Mercy Corps Northwest seeks to offer financial and technical assistance to low-income individuals to start a business, or small local business owners who experience financial hardships to overcome particular challenges, with the ultimate end-goal to enhance community-level economic capacity. Some of the specific target populations include (but not restricted to):
* New college graduates; 
* Retirees;
* Low-income families; 
* Female small business owners; 
* Former prisoners seeking community reentry.

Mercy Corps Northwest targets several social fronts through a number of programs that deliver education, training and mentoring for prospective small business entrepreneurs. Its Community Investment Trust seeks to mobilize small community investments (ranging from US$10 to US$100) in selected commercial properties that are not only affordable venues for small businesses, but can also generate profit dividends for investors from local community in return. The organization also establishes Individual Development Accounts (IDAs) and provides Small Business Grants of up to US$3000 through established IDAs for eligible families and individuals who complete specific sets of business training offered by the organization. The organization hosts a Women&#x27;s Business Center that aims to empower start-up female entrepreneurs through training, microloan and grant provisions. For former prisoners seeking re-integration into the community in Portland, Oregon, Mercy Corps Northwest also operates the Reentry Transition Center that offers joint business and social reentry training curricula that assist ex-offenders with managing independent and successful lives after being released from prison.

== Objective-specific example programs ==

=== Agriculture ===

==== Market-oriented agricultural development ====
A number of Mercy Corps&#x27; agriculture-related programs are jointly delivered with objectives in other areas such as water conservation, disaster resilience, emergency crisis response and market system development. For example, Mercy Corps establishes partnerships with local farmers or agribusinesses to stimulate local market exchanges in Uganda, with the ultimate target to not only help farmers gain market competitiveness, but also make affordable food choices more accessible for local populations living in deprived conditions, including incoming refugees within Uganda and from neighboring countries in crisis. In response to the food crisis of the mid-1990s and at the request of North Korea, Mercy Corps began their work in 1996 focusing in the areas of local agricultural development. Throughout the duration of its presence, Mercy Corps has moved from food assistance to working on long-term agricultural and economic solutions: apple trees and fish farms and cross-cultural exchange. The effort involves aid workers living in Pyongyang, and in Chagang and North Pyongan provinces to visit families, monitor distribution and assess impact.

Mercy Corps offers a number of agriculture-oriented programs in various countries, often delivered with water conservation and disaster prevention focuses. In Timor-Leste, for example, Mercy Corps seeks to build &quot;market-based incentives to mitigation activities&quot; so that local farmers are able to exercise different types of farming practices with different weather-resistance characteristics. By providing them with seed and farming assistance, these practices can enable Timorese farmers to contribute more &quot;nutritious food source to households and to local markets&quot; all the while diversifying farming practices so that &quot;communities are not so reliant on one or two key crops for income and nutrition.&quot; In Syria since 2011, it has been supporting an estimate of 9,000 local farmers and small gardeners by providing technical assistance in seasonal planting to mitigate with not only natural weather conditions but also man-made humanitarian crises on the ground. The organization purchases seeds for local farmers to reduce the investment cost of crop production in the post-Syrian war environment with destroyed infrastructure, and provide technical and business training that teach farmers efficient ways of planting and cultivation, as well as exchanging surplus productions in local markets.

=== Food security ===

Like most of its other development programs, Mercy Corps work to &quot;provide communities with the tools and support they need to transform their own lives to support resilient well-being.&quot; With regards to food security, it targets five main areas for development: Pro-Poor Markets, Empowerment, Good Governance, Human Well-Being, and Economic Health. It has been maintaining the main aim to providing its beneficiary population with necessary tools (both technical and material) and assisting them with utilizing these particular tools for the advancement of their own well-being.

In Niger, Mercy Corps jointly delivered the &quot;Sawki&quot; Program with Africare and Helen Keller International. The program, funded by USAID, aimed to respond to the food security needs of a reported 118,000 people in the most vulnerable regions of the country, including Maradi and Zinder. Understanding that 60% of the marginalized population in the program&#x27;s target areas were children of severe malnutrition, the program sought to &quot; bring together complementary activities in nutrition, health, agriculture, livestock husbandry, livelihoods promotion, and market development,&quot; with an emphasized focal point on the empowerment of adolescent girls.

From 2009 to 2013, Mercy Corps has delivered a SECURE program in Timor-Leste that seeks to relieve and prevent agriculture related damages caused by extreme rainfalls by connecting local blacksmiths who are able to produce effective small and medium-sized metal silos to broader rural farming populations. In collaboration with the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Mercy Corps provided local farmers with subsidies for local farmers to purchase silos, while the FAO provided training and material assistance for blacksmiths to produce.

Mercy Corps has also been operating in post-conflict Uganda since 2009: as the state approaches societal recovery, it has been facing a range of development challenges, one of which being the production under-capacity of the farming sector. The Revitalizing Agricultural Incomes and New markets (RAIN) program was created to target key areas that are detrimental for long-term assurance of food security, including financial services for small and medium agro-businesses at the local level, advising larger food-related enterprises for agricultural investment opportunities at the regional and national level, and technical training for returning farmers at the individual level. In parallel of training programs for the farmer communities that seek to improve land-capacity, growth and cultivation capacity and production efficiency, Mercy Corps has also been facilitating various actors within the domestic market chain to promote better access and more extensive availability of financial services and market platforms to ensure the continuous operation of the agricultural supply and demand chains, with the broader objective to encourage sustainable food security.

=== Children &amp; youth ===

==== Youth economic empowerment ====
Mercy Corps has been operating the PROSPECTS program in Liberia with the support of Exxon Mobil, Coca Cola Africa Foundation and the Swedish Government. The program, at its third phase as of 2018, has been focused in improving livelihoods of close to 12,000 vulnerable Liberian youth by providing them pre-employment and entrepreneurial trainings, apprenticeships in 15 partnering host enterprises all the while stimulating overall local markets. It is expected that the program will be able to reach 19,000 youth from Bong, Nimba and Montserrado counties in Liberia with a range of skill training and cash grants to obtain employment or start small businesses.

In the Gaza Strip, Mercy Corps created Gaza Sky Geeks in 2011 with the support of a seed funding from Google, the Coca-Cola Foundation, Skoll and various local donors. The particular initiative seeks to create a stage for new, young talents to grow and share their ideas while improving their skills through receiving professional mentoring and performing hands-on work. It also works to encourage female startup members within the IT community to engage in business and software engineering activities. The Gaza Sky Geeks also provide considerable start-up grants for eligible young IT entrepreneurs to begin their businesses in the challenging market environment of Gaza. It hosts up to 140 people a day, with almost half of those hosted being women, with a prospective second location opening in the near future. Meanwhile, it has promoted local youth startups that receive significant attention from large U.S. technology firms such as Strips and Silicon Valley Bank.

=== Economic opportunity ===

==== Fostering microfinance ====
Mercy Corps has been facilitating programs that deliver micro-financial services to individuals in different community contexts to promote long-term, self-sustainable economic growth. These particular programs offer small, short-term business loans to people of economically deprived conditions for them to start-up local businesses gain financial independence.

Domestically within the United States, Mercy Corps Northwest partners with the AmeriCorps VISTA and offers small business loans and grants to help eligible individuals with jump-starting their own small enterprises. Internationally, Mercy Corps offers microcredits to people living in transitional or developing contexts through its networks of affiliations with banking sectors across the globe.

For example, in Indonesia and the Philippines, Mercy Corps announced the Maximizing Financial Access and Innovation at Scale (MAXIS) initiative that would the establishment of Bank Andara, a commercial bank that would partner with a broad network of microfinance institutions in the region to provide access to microfinancial services to, reportedly, 12 million Indonesian and 5 million Filipino nationals living in poverty through innovative strategies. The MAXIS initiative, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2008, also provided financial and technical assistance that increased the operational capacity of Indonesia&#x27;s Microfinance Innovations Center for Resources and Alternatives (MICRA) to provide extended means of assistance to 851 Indonesian poverty-focused microfinancial institutions. Mercy Corps also implemented similar actions in the Philippines to provide technical and research support to other 359 Filipino microfinancial institutions that provide durable financial capacity-building services.

Another example would be the Asian Credit Fund in Kazakhstan, a microfinancial institution facilitated by Mercy Corps, was able to obtain an operational loan totaled in US$1.8 million from the Grameen Credit Agricole Foundation to deliver microfinancial services to people of deprived conditions individual micro-loans with terms of six months to one year, all the while providing education in financial literacy and environmental sustainability. The Asian Credit Fund is reported to have 37 offices, 21,000 borrowers of which 92% are female, and a US$8.7 million gross loan deliverance profile.

As of 2018, it is reported that Mercy Corps has distributed US$1.4 billion in forms of micro-loans to 244,315 clients globally. 


=== Education ===
Mercy Corps&#x27; SAFE (abbreviation of Supporting Adolescent Girls&#x27; Future through Second Chance Education) School program in Niger ensures vital access for young adolescent girls to basic extents of education despite the nation&#x27;s difficult socio-economic conditions. The program is a part of Mercy Corps&#x27; SAFE program series that, together, have the overall aim to improve the well-being of the female population in target areas. In collaboration with N&#x27;s Ministry of Education and a local non-government organization, Organisation Nigerienne des Educateurs Novateurs, the SAFE School program sought to help &quot;adolescent girls from vulnerable households to enter or re-enter the education system.&quot; Since its launch, it has engaged nearly 500 girls and 27 teachers (mostly female), as well as provided 20 learning centers with diversified management and teaching skills.

In Kailali, Nepal, Mercy Corps implemented the Education of Marginalized Girls in Kailali from 2013 to 2017. The program seeks to broaden the spectrum of education for local girls in far western Nepal through organizing girls&#x27; education hubs/clubs that encourage girls to continue their education above the necessary education nationally established time frame (after obtaining the School Leaving Certificate), all the while persuading girls who have dropped out of their education to return to school. In addition, the program has also funded school curriculum in natural sciences, math, English and sexual health education to ensure the targeted adolescent girl population have extensive exposure to knowledge that are necessary for maintaining proper livelihoods. Mercy Corps has also created two tool kits as one of the many elements of its deliverance of programs that encourage inclusive education for children with disabilities in Jordan, including various worksheets, plans, exercises and checklists to aid targeted disabled student populations with better managing their curriculum.

In 2018, Mercy Corps, in collaboration with Educate A Child (EAC) and implemented through a consortium with Mercy USA, spearheaded the Wax Bar Carruurta Soomaaliyeed, also known as the Educate Somali Children (ESC) program. This three-year program aimed to enhance access to high-quality and inclusive primary education for 42,071 Somali Out-of-School-Children (OOSC) residing in the Federal Member States of Galmudug, Hirshabelle, South West, Jubbaland, and Banadir region, as well as in Puntland and Somaliland.

=== Women &amp; gender ===
Mercy Corps has facilitated linkages between gender dimensions and positive aspects of long-term market development. In the United States, Mercy Corps Northwest facilitates the Women&#x27;s Business Center that seeks to empower, grow and support female entrepreneurs in the state of Oregon by providing them with business training, a discussion platform and operation grants/loans.

In Nigeria, the organization has recognized that a notable percentage of the adolescent girls want to start a small enterprise, of which most were already engaged in various extents of economic activity. Mercy Corps hence implemented the Adolescent Girls in Northern Nigeria: Financial Inclusion and Entrepreneurship Opportunities Profile program to identify key challenges and barriers for adolescent girls to initiate economic activities and gain a stable revenue to pay for their tuition and living expenses. Around 1800 adolescent girls have been profiled in Northern Nigeria. These profiles would assist Mercy Corps and other related development organizations to facilitate future programs that aim to empower female to engage in entrepreneurial actions and contribute to the improvement of the market capacities of their own communities.

In Afghanistan, Mercy Corps&#x27; INVEST program has had a meta-objective on developing durable market capacity of the Southern region of Helmand through introducing vocational education and skills training to local young Afghani population. Funded by the United Kingdom&#x27;s Department for International Development (DFID), it is specifically designed for the particular demographics of the target region, and has provided specific technical training opportunities for nearly 22,000 young men and women, over 70% of which were able to find employment or self-employment in fields of tailoring, electric, mechanics and plumbing. INVEST&#x27;s gender-neutral delivery has enabled a significant number of local women to gain a progressive amount of personal autonomy in patriarchal communities where they are still extensively marginalized, all the while contributed to the capacity-building of the overall Afghani market economy.

In Niger, where adolescent girls and women experience increasing exposures to gender-based violence in their communities, Mercy Corps have delivered the SAFE Space and later on, the SAFE Space + Livelihood programs that aims to provide safe platforms for young women and men to have access to accredited information on contraception, sexual health and family planning. Over the life of these programs, Mercy Corps has worked with &quot;15 health care providers at community pharmacies and health centers to ensure that they have increased knowledge in family planning counselling and stock management to improve access to contraception.&quot;

=== Emergency response ===
In North Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo, Mercy Corps delivers the Emergency Assistance to Conflict-Affected Populations (EACAP) program to provide first-hand emergency aid to internally displaced populations in the region created by related domestic instabilities. The program, at its second phase in 2012, operated with the main focuses on economic recovery and WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene) maintenance. Responding to the socio-political effects of the M23-related armed conflicts in Goma and broader North Kivu, Mercy Corps reached to assist a total of 122,769 internally-displaced populations to respond and mitigate existing instabilities.

Operating as part of the Better Than Cash Alliance in the Philippines, Mercy Corps sought to take advantage of existing financial technologies to meet the emergency financial needs for the surviving victims of the Haiyan Typhoon in the country. Rather than relying on the traditional physical cash-transfer methods, Mercy Corps partnered with the BPI Globe BanKO to offer a range of electronic financial services that can deliver emergency recover aid to typhoon survivors. Program beneficiaries were &quot;enrolled in BanKO&#x27;s mobile savings accounts, through which they received one to three separate electronic cash transfers totaling 3,950 Philippine Pesos (about $90).&quot; The beneficiaries are provided with a SIM telephone card and an ATM cash withdrawal card so that Mercy Corps can send important context-specific financial tips, advice, literacy information via both voice and SMS messages, while BanKO has the opportunity to reach directly to the beneficiaries through electronic banking means. The program has delivered first-hand emergency aids and access to more efficient financial management tools to more than 25,000 households affected by the Haiyan Typhoon.

== Disputes and criticisms ==
In May, 2017, Mercy Corps publicly announced that it had commenced the investigation of two staff members in its refugee program stations in Greece after receiving a call through the complaint hotline with regards to the &quot;serious misconduct&quot; of addressed workers. After the Greek representative officials probed into the issue with regards to two staff from an unnamed, European Union-funded non-government organization having sexually violated refugees and misused the financial resource that was allocated solely for refugee use. Responding to the particular probe, Mercy Corps has launched related investigations, and the two identified staff members were put on leave with further decisions on behavior outcomes to be made.

The Charity Navigator gave Mercy Corps a 3-star overall rating, a 2-star financial rating and a 4-star accountability and transparency rating for the 2019 fiscal year.

In 2019, senior staff resigned following public disclosure of the organization&#x27;s longtime inaction over its co-founder&#x27;s sexual abuse of his daughter.

<text>The northern flicker or common flicker (Colaptes auratus) is a medium-sized bird of the woodpecker family. It is native to most of North America, parts of Central America, Cuba, and the Cayman Islands, and is one of the few woodpecker species that migrate. Over 100 common names for the northern flicker are known, including yellowhammer (not to be confused with the Eurasian yellowhammer (&quot;Emberiza citrinella&quot;)), clape, gaffer woodpecker, harry-wicket, heigh-ho, wake-up, walk-up, wick-up, yarrup, and gawker bird. Many of these names derive from attempts to imitate some of its calls. It is the state bird of Alabama (known by its colloquial name &quot;yellowhammer&quot;).

==Taxonomy==

The English naturalist Mark Catesby described and illustrated the northern flicker in his book &quot;The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands&quot; which was published between 1729 and 1732. Catesby used the English name &quot;Gold-winged Wood-pecker&quot; and the Latin &quot;&quot;. When in 1758 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the tenth edition, he included the northern flicker, coined the binomial name &quot;Cuculus auratus&quot; and cited Catesby&#x27;s book. 

The specific epithet is a Latin word meaning &quot;gilded&quot; or &quot;ornamented with gold&quot;. The type locality is South Carolina. The northern flicker is one of 13 extant New World woodpeckers now placed in the genus &quot;Colaptes&quot; that was introduced by the Irish zoologist Nicholas Aylward Vigors in 1825 with the northern flicker (&quot;Colaptes auratus&quot;) as the type species.

== Subspecies ==
Ten subspecies are recognized, one of which is now extinct, though it may be invalid. The extant subspecies were at one time considered subspecies of two separate species called the yellow-shafted flicker (&quot;C. auratus&quot;, with four subspecies) and the red-shafted flicker (&quot;C. cafer&quot;, with six subspecies, five living and one extinct), but they commonly interbreed where their ranges overlap and are now considered one species by the American Ornithologists Union. This is an example of what is referred to in science as the species problem.

=== Yellow-shafted group ===
*The southern yellow-shafted flicker (&quot;C. a. auratus&quot;) resides in the southeastern United States. It is yellow under the tail and underwings and has yellow shafts on its primaries. It has a gray cap, a beige face, and a red bar at the nape of the neck. Males have a black mustache. &quot;Colaptes&quot; comes from the Greek verb &quot;colapt&quot;, meaning &quot;to peck&quot;; is from the Latin root , meaning &quot;gold&quot; or &quot;golden&quot;, and refers to the bird&#x27;s underwings. As the state bird of Alabama, this subspecies is known by the common name &quot;yellowhammer&quot;, a term that originated during the American Civil War to describe Confederate soldiers from Alabama.
*The northern yellow-shafted flicker (&quot;C. a. luteus&quot;; formerly &quot;C. a. borealis&quot;) resides from central Alaska throughout most of Canada to southern Labrador, Newfoundland, and the northeastern United States.
*The Cuban yellow-shafted flicker (&quot;C. a. chrysocaulosus&quot;) is restricted to Cuba.
*The Grand Cayman yellow-shafted flicker (&quot;C. a. gundlachi&quot;) is restricted to Grand Cayman in the Cayman Islands. The subspecific epithet is named after Cuban naturalist Juan Gundlach.

=== Red-shafted group ===
*The western red-shafted flicker (&quot;C. a. cafer&quot;) resides in western North America. It is red under the tail and underwings and has red shafts on its primaries. It has a beige cap and a gray face. Males have a red mustache. The subspecific name &quot;cafer&quot; is the result of an error made in 1788 by the German systematist Johann Gmelin, who believed that its original habitat was in South Africa among the Xhosa people, then known as the &quot;Kaffirs&quot;. As the origin of the subspecies designation is regarded as offensive by some, proposals to change the scientific name of this subspecies to &quot;C. a. lathami&quot; have been presented to the American Ornithological Society. The Society, in accordance with the rules governing scientific nomenclature, has as of September 2018 declined to support a change of the subspecific name, but may consult with the ICZN on the matter.
*The coastal red-shafted flicker (&quot;C. a. collaris&quot;) has a range that closely overlaps that of &quot;C. a. cafer&quot;, extending along much of the West Coast of North America from British Columbia to northwestern Mexico.
*The dwarf red-shafted flicker (&quot;C. a. nanus&quot;) resides in western Texas south to northeastern Mexico.
*The Mexican red-shafted flicker (&quot;C. a. mexicanus&quot;) resides in central and southern Mexico from Durango to San Luis Potosí and Oaxaca.
*The Guatemalan red-shafted flicker (&quot;C. a. mexicanoides&quot;) resides in the highlands of southern Mexico and Central America. It is considered by some authorities to be a separate species, the Guatemalan flicker (&quot;C. mexicanoides&quot;).
*The Guadalupe red-shafted flicker (&quot;C. a. rufipileus&quot;)† is extinct and was formerly restricted to Guadalupe Island, off the northwestern coast of Baja California, Mexico. It was last recorded in 1906. It may be invalid. Individuals of an extant mainland red-shafted subspecies (which one is unknown) were observed breeding on Guadalupe Island in 1996.
==Description==

Adults are brown with black bars on the back and wings. A mid- to large-sized northern flicker measures in length and in wingspan. The body mass can vary from . Among standard scientific measurements, the wing bone measures , the tail measures , the bill measures and the tarsus measures . The largest-bodied specimens are from the northern stretches of the species&#x27; range at the latitude of Alaska and Labrador, while the smallest specimens come from Grand Cayman Island. A necklace-like black patch occupies the upper breast, while the lower breast and belly are beige with black spots. Males can be identified by a black (in the eastern part of the species&#x27; range) or red (in the western part) mustachial stripe at the base of the beak, while females lack this stripe. The tail is dark on top, transitioning to a white rump which is conspicuous in flight. Subspecific plumage is variable.

===Call and flight===

This bird&#x27;s call is a sustained laugh, &quot;ki ki ki ki&quot;, quite different from that of the pileated woodpecker (&quot;Dryocopus pileatus&quot;). One may also hear a constant knocking as they often drum on trees or even metal objects to declare territory. Like most woodpeckers, northern flickers drum on objects as a form of communication and territory defense. In such cases, the purpose is to make as loud a noise as possible, so woodpeckers sometimes drum on metal objects.

Like many woodpeckers, its flight is undulating. The repeated cycle of a quick succession of flaps followed by a pause creates an effect comparable to a roller coaster.

==Diet==
According to the Audubon field guide, &quot;flickers are the only woodpeckers that frequently feed on the ground&quot;, probing with their beak, also sometimes catching insects in flight. Although they eat fruits, berries, seeds, and nuts, their primary food is insects. Ants alone can make up 45% of their diet. Other invertebrates eaten include flies, butterflies, moths, beetles, and snails. Northern flickers also eat berries and seeds, especially in winter, including those of poison ivy, poison oak, dogwood, sumac, wild cherry and grape, bayberries, hackberries, and elderberries, as well as sunflower and thistle seeds. Northern flickers often break into underground ant colonies to get at the nutritious larvae there, hammering at the soil the way other woodpeckers drill into wood. They have been observed breaking up cow dung to eat the insects living within. Their tongues can dart out beyond the end of the bill to catch prey. The northern flicker is a natural predator of the European corn borer (&quot;Ostrinia nubilalis&quot;), an invasive species of moth that costs the U.S. agriculture industry more than $1 billion annually in crop losses and population control. As well as eating ants, northern flickers exhibit a behavior known as anting, in which they use the formic acid from the ants to assist in preening, as it is useful in keeping them free of parasites.

===Influence of diet on offspring===
According to an article published in &quot;Ibis&quot;, the availability of food affects the coloration of feathers in northern flicker nestlings. The article focused on the correlation between melanin spots and carotenoid-based coloration on the wings of nestlings with food stress via indirect manipulation of brood size. The article found that there was a positive correlation between the quality of the nestlings&#x27; diet and T-cell-mediated immune response. T-cell-mediated immune response was found to be positively correlated with brightness of pigmentation in flight feathers, but not related to melanin spot intensity.

==Habitat==
The northern flicker may be observed in open habitats near trees, including woodlands, edges, yards, and parks. In the western United States, one can find it in mountain forests all the way up to the tree line. The northern flicker generally nests in holes in trees like other woodpeckers. Occasionally, it has been found nesting in old, earthen burrows vacated by belted kingfishers (&quot;Megaceryle alcyon&quot;) or sand martins (&quot;Riparia riparia&quot;). Both sexes help with the nest excavation. The entrance hole is about in diameter, and the cavity is deep. The cavity widens at the bottom to make room for the eggs and the incubating adult. Inside, the cavity is bare except for a bed of wood chips for the eggs and chicks to rest on. Once the nestlings are about 17 days old, they begin clinging to the cavity wall rather than lying on the floor. They can create cavities inside homes, especially homes of stucco or weak wooden siding.

==Lifespan==

A study from 2006 examined the mortality rates of male and female northern flickers over a six-year period using capture-tag-recapture techniques. The researchers observed that only one to two birds out of every 300 adults were 7 or more years old. This observation data correlated well with a mortality model that predicted a 0.6% 7-year survival rate. The data also illustrated that there were no significant differences between male and female survival rates for the general population.
The oldest yet known &quot;yellow-shafted&quot; northern flicker lived to be at least 9 years 2 months old, and the oldest yet known &quot;red-shafted&quot; northern flicker lived to be at least 8 years 9 months old.

===Reproduction===
The northern flicker&#x27;s breeding habitat consists of forested areas across North America and as far south as Central America. It is a cavity nester that typically nests in trees, but may also use posts and birdhouses if sized and situated appropriately. It prefers to excavate its own home, although it may reuse and repair damaged or abandoned nests. Often the old nests are created by belted kingfishers or sand martins. Abandoned northern flicker nests create habitats for other cavity nesters. The northern flicker is sometimes driven away from its nesting site by other cavity nesters like the common starling (&quot;Sturnus vulgaris&quot;).

The northern flicker commonly breeds during the months of February to July, depending upon the temperature of the area. During the breeding season, both mates will stay together. After the season, they do not stay together. Before breeding season, one to two weeks are needed for a mated pair to build the nest. Male flickers find female flickers by head bobbing and their personal mating call. The common sounds the male bird makes towards a female is &quot;woikawoikawoika&quot;, symbolizing their relationship to one another and other birds. If the call is used towards a male, it is a territorial sign.  The calls&#x27; pattern can be classified as flat and gradually rises into a loud noise. The call type is a chirp that drums and rattles.

Additional territorial signs towards other males can be head swinging when in close proximity to another or repeatedly creating loud noises with their beaks. Commonly used objects are wood or metal for a louder sound. While making the loud noises, they will spread their wings, moving them up and down, spreading their tail to flash their colorful underside. The color of their feathers depends on the environment surrounding the bird. Currently, there is no direct correlation between the birds&#x27; colors and mate choice. Rather, it plays a bigger role in territory.

The northern flicker may also point its bill forward towards a competitor for territorial reasons. Juvenile northern flickers are often helpless against predators who enter the nest. The common predators are Cooper&#x27;s hawks (&quot;Astur cooperii&quot;), sharp-shinned hawks (&quot;Accipter striatus&quot;), raccoons (&quot;Procyon lotor&quot;), squirrels, and snakes. Full grown northern flickers are preyed upon by larger birds and hunting birds. The entrance hole of their nest is roughly wide. The hole entrance is often facing east to southeast. On average, the northern flicker can have one to two clutches each breeding season. A typical clutch consists of six to eight eggs whose shells are pure white with a smooth surface and high gloss. The eggs are the second-largest of the North American woodpecker species, exceeded only by the pileated woodpecker&#x27;s. Incubation is by both sexes for about 11 to 12 days. Commonly the male will sit on the eggs overnight, and both the male and female will incubate the eggs during the day. The young are fed by regurgitation and fledge about 25 to 28 days after hatching.

===Wintering and migration===
Northern flickers are partial migrants, in which some southern populations are completely non-migratory. Those that do migrate tend to begin their spring migration towards the beginning of April and make their return between September and October. Individuals that breed farther north travel greater distances than their migratory southern conspecifics, often resulting in the convergence of northern and southern populations at wintering sites. This discrepancy likely arises from the northern flickers&#x27; ground foraging behavior, in which prey can only be found in snow-free locations. Furthermore, females tend to winter farther north than males, suggesting that parental investment and division of reproductive labour are key factors in determining individual migratory behavior. Rising temperatures resulting from anthropogenic climate change have been shown to trigger migration prematurely in Northern flickers, as well as many other migratory bird species as evidenced in Sherbrooke, Quebec.

Northern flickers are divided into eastern and western populations by the Rocky Mountains, with each population having a unique migratory pathway. Individuals breeding in the prairie provinces of Canada, the Dakotas, and surrounding U.S. states winter in Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas. Those breeding in southern Ontario and Michigan to New England winter from east Texas to the Carolinas, whereas those breeding in British Columbia and the Pacific Northwest winter from central California to Baja Peninsula, Mexico.

During migration, northern flickers may form flocks. Additionally, the species&#x27; propensity for roosting in cavities is not mitigated during migration. On average, 75% of individuals spend their nights in a cavity during migration, even in completely unknown locations. Northern flickers demonstrate a high rate of nest cavity re-use, as opposed to excavating new cavities each year. Furthermore, breeding individuals exhibit intense site fidelity, with pairs consistently returning to the specific nest cavity they used in the previous year.

<doc id="351592" wikidata="Q4384608" url="?curid=351592" title="Bill English">
<text>Sir Simon William English (born 30 December 1961) is a New Zealand former politician who served as the 39th prime minister of New Zealand from 2016 to 2017 and leader of the National Party from 2001 to 2003 and 2016 to 2018. He had previously served as the 17th deputy prime minister of New Zealand and minister of finance from 2008 to 2016 under John Key and the Fifth National Government.

A farmer and public servant before entering politics, English was elected to the New Zealand Parliament in as the National Party&#x27;s candidate in the Wallace electorate. He was elevated to Cabinet in 1996 and in 1999 was made minister of finance, although he served for less than a year due to his party&#x27;s loss at the 1999 general election. In October 2001, English replaced Jenny Shipley as the leader of the National Party (and consequently as Leader of the Opposition). He led the party to its worst defeat at the 2002 general election, and as a consequence, in October 2003 he was replaced as leader by Don Brash.

In November 2006, after Brash&#x27;s resignation, English became deputy leader under John Key. After National&#x27;s victory at the 2008 general election, he became deputy prime minister and was also made minister of finance for the second time. Under English&#x27;s direction New Zealand&#x27;s economy maintained steady growth during National&#x27;s three terms of government. He became a list-only MP after stepping down as an electorate MP at the 2014 general election.

John Key resigned as leader of the National Party and prime minister in December 2016. English won the resulting leadership election unopposed and was sworn in as prime minister on 12 December 2016. His tenure was only ten months, and included a three-month election campaign. In the 2017 general election, National won the largest number of seats but fell short of a majority. The parties holding the balance of power declined to support the existing government, and English was subsequently replaced as prime minister by Jacinda Ardern, leader of the Labour Party. English initially continued on as Leader of the Opposition, but resigned as leader of the National Party on 27 February 2018 and left parliament two weeks later.

==Early life==
English was born on 30 December 1961 at Lumsden Maternity Centre in Lumsden, a small town in the South Island of New Zealand. He is the eleventh of twelve children of Mervyn English and Norah (née O&#x27;Brien) English. His parents purchased &quot;Rosedale&quot;, a mixed sheep and cropping farm in Dipton, Southland from Mervyn&#x27;s uncle, Vincent English, a bachelor, in 1944. English was born in the maternity unit at Lumsden.

English attended St Thomas&#x27;s School in Winton, then boarded at St. Patrick&#x27;s College in Upper Hutt, where he became head boy. He played in the first XV of the school&#x27;s rugby team. English went on to study commerce at the University of Otago, where he was a resident at Selwyn College, and then completed an honours degree in English literature at Victoria University of Wellington.

After finishing his studies, English returned to Dipton and farmed for a few years. From 1987 to 1989, he worked in Wellington as a policy analyst for the New Zealand Treasury, at a time when the free market policies favoured by Labour&#x27;s finance minister Roger Douglas (known collectively as &quot;Rogernomics&quot;) were being implemented.

English joined the National Party in 1980, while at Victoria University. He served for a period as chairman of the Southland branch of the Young Nationals, and became a member of the Wallace electorate committee. After moving to Wellington, he served for periods on the Island Bay and Miramar electorate committees, respectively.

==Fourth National Government (1990–1999)==





At the 1990 general election, English stood as the National candidate in Wallace, the former electorate of National&#x27;s first full-time leader, Adam Hamilton. The incumbent, Derek Angus, was retiring. English was elected with a large majority amid that year&#x27;s National landslide. He would hold this seat, renamed Clutha-Southland in 1996, until 2014. He and three other newly elected National MPs (Tony Ryall, Nick Smith, and Roger Sowry) were soon identified as rising stars in New Zealand politics, and at various points were dubbed the &quot;brat pack&quot;, the &quot;gang of four&quot;, and the &quot;young Turks&quot;. In his first term in parliament, English chaired a select committee into social services. He was made a parliamentary under-secretary in 1993, serving under the Minister of Health.

===First period in cabinet (1996–1999)===
In early 1996, English was elevated to cabinet by Prime Minister Jim Bolger, becoming the Minister for Crown Health Enterprises and Associate Minister of Education (to Wyatt Creech). He was 34 at the time, becoming the cabinet&#x27;s youngest member. After the 1996 general election, the National Party was forced into a coalition with New Zealand First to retain government. In the resulting cabinet reshuffle, English emerged as Minister of Health. However, as a condition of the coalition agreement, NZ First&#x27;s Neil Kirton (a first-term MP) was made Associate Minister of Health, effectively becoming English&#x27;s deputy. This arrangement was described in the press as a &quot;shotgun marriage&quot;, and there were frequent differences of opinion between the two ministers. After their relationship became unworkable, Kirton was sacked from the role in August 1997, with the agreement of NZ First leader Winston Peters.

As Minister of Health, English was responsible for continuing the reforms to the public health system that National had begun after the 1990 general election. The reforms were unpopular, and health was perceived as one of the government&#x27;s weaknesses, with the health portfolio consequently being viewed as a challenge. English believed that the unpopularity of the reforms was in part due to a failure in messaging, and encouraged his National colleagues to avoid bureaucratic and money-focused language (such as references to &quot;balance sheets&quot; and &quot;user charges&quot;) and instead talk about the improvements to services the government&#x27;s reforms would bring. He also rejected the idea that public hospitals could be run as commercial enterprises, a view which some of his colleagues had previously promoted.

By early 1997, as dissatisfaction with Bolger&#x27;s leadership began to grow, English was being touted as a potential successor, along with Jenny Shipley and Doug Graham. His age (35) was viewed as the main impediment to a successful leadership run. National&#x27;s leadership troubles were resolved in December 1997, when Bolger resigned and Shipley was elected to the leadership unopposed. English had been a supporter of Bolger as leader, but Shipley reappointed him Minister of Health in her new cabinet.

English was promoted to Minister of Finance in a reshuffle in January 1999, a position which was at the time subordinate to the Treasurer, Bill Birch. After a few months, the pair switched positions as part of Birch&#x27;s transition to retirement, with English assuming the senior portfolio. In early interviews, he emphasised his wish to be seen as a pragmatist rather than an ideologue, and said that the initiatives of some of his predecessors (Roger Douglas&#x27;s &quot;Rogernomics&quot; and Ruth Richardson&#x27;s &quot;Ruthanasia&quot;) had focused on &quot;fruitless, theoretical debates&quot; when &quot;people just want to see problems solved&quot;.

==Opposition (1999–2008)==

After the National Party lost the 1999 election to Helen Clark&#x27;s Labour Party, English continued on in the shadow cabinet as National&#x27;s spokesperson for finance. He was elected deputy leader of the party in February 2001, following the resignation of Wyatt Creech, with Gerry Brownlee being his unsuccessful opponent.

===Leader of the Opposition===
In October 2001, after months of speculation, Jenny Shipley resigned as leader of the National Party after being told she no longer had the support of the party caucus. English was elected as her replacement unopposed (with Roger Sowry as his deputy), and consequently became Leader of the Opposition. However, he did not openly organise against Shipley, and according to &quot;The Southland Times&quot; &quot;there was almost an element of &#x27;aw, shucks, I&#x27;ll do it then&#x27; about Mr English&#x27;s ascension&quot;.

Aged 39 when he was elected, English became the second-youngest leader in the National Party&#x27;s history, after Jim McLay (who was 38 when elected in 1984). He also became only the third Southlander to lead a major New Zealand political party, after Joseph Ward and Adam Hamilton. However, English failed to improve the party&#x27;s performance. In the 2002 election, National suffered its worst electoral defeat ever, gaining barely more than twenty percent of the vote. English described it as &quot;the worst day of my political life&quot;. Both party insiders and the general public were split as to how much to blame him for the loss, but most of the party believed that English would be able to rebuild National&#x27;s support.

By late 2003, however, National&#x27;s performance in opinion polls remained poor. The party had briefly increased its popularity in the year following the election, but by October its support had fallen to levels only slightly better than what it achieved in the last ballot. English also appeared in a boxing match for a charity against entertainer Ted Clarke. This did not boost his polling or that of the National party either, with suggestions that it devalued his image as a serious politician. Don Brash, former governor of the Reserve Bank and a relative newcomer to politics, began to build up support to replace English. On 28 October, Brash gained sufficient backing in Caucus to defeat English in a leadership contest.

===Shadow cabinet roles and deputy leader===
On 2 November 2003, when Brash changed responsibilities for certain MPs, English became National&#x27;s spokesman for education, ranked at fifth place in the party&#x27;s parliamentary hierarchy. He remained in parliament after the 2005 election. In his new shadow education portfolio, English performed strongly, and remained a party favourite despite his election defeat as leader in 2002, eventually being returned to the finance portfolio in August 2004 as deputy spokesman (while still retaining responsibility for education).

In November 2006, Brash resigned as leader. English was considered as a potential replacement leader (running against John Key) or deputy leader (against incumbent Gerry Brownlee) in the ensuing leadership election. However, a contest was avoided when the MPs agreed a Key/English ticket would run unopposed in a display of party unity. English took over the deputy leadership and the finance portfolio in the Key shadow cabinet.

==Fifth National Government (2008–2017)==
===Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance (2008–2016)===

At the 2008 election, English was re-elected by his electorate, winning by a margin of about 15,500 votes. He became Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand and Minister of Finance in the fifth National Government, being sworn into office on 19 November 2008 and continued to serve in those roles until becoming Prime Minister on 12 December 2016. He was also made Minister of Infrastructure in National&#x27;s first term of government and Minister responsible for Housing New Zealand Corporation and minister responsible for the New Zealand flag consideration process in its third.

He was comfortably re-elected in Clutha-Southland in the 2011 election but opted to run as a party-list candidate in 2014.

The pairing of John Key as leader of the National Party and English as his deputy has been compared to that of Bob Hawke and Paul Keating (in Australia) and Tony Blair and Gordon Brown (in the UK).

English acceded to the role of finance minister in the continuing wake of the financial crisis. In response to New Zealand&#x27;s rising debt, English made budget deficit-reduction his main priority. His first budget outlined three focuses in New Zealand&#x27;s financial recovery: &quot;improving the business environment and removing roadblocks to growth; investment in productive infrastructure; and improving the way government works&quot;. One of his first acts was creating the National Infrastructure Unit, charged with formulating a plan for infrastructure projects and investments. He commissioned a government-wide spending review, with an aim to reducing government expenditure—with the exceptions of a two-year stimulus package and long-term increases on infrastructure spending.

In April 2011, the Opposition criticised English for suggesting that New Zealand businesses could use New Zealand&#x27;s low wages to help it compete with Australia. The National Government campaigned for re-election in 2011 on its economic record. The Government boasted growth for five consecutive quarters up to mid-2010, totalling 1.6% of real GDP.

Strong growth resulted in a surplus of $473 million for the 2015/16 financial year, projected to rise to $8.5 billion by 2020/21. In his 2016 Economic and Fiscal Update address, English stated that reducing debt and tackling the costs of the 2016 Kaikōura earthquake were higher priorities than reducing rates of tax.

====Allowances issue====
In 2009, the media, including TVNZ and TV3 revealed that English was receiving about NZ$900 a week as part of a living allowance for ministers, to live in his own NZ$1.2 million Wellington home. At the time, English also received $276,200 in his annual salary as deputy prime minister. It was also revealed other ministers with homes in the capital city were also claiming accommodation allowances. On 3 August 2009, Prime Minister John Key started a review of the housing allowances claimed by cabinet ministers. English subsequently paid back $12,000 and only claimed about $24,000 a year in living allowances. The Auditor-General&#x27;s office said in September 2009 that they were making &quot;preliminary enquiries&quot; into parliamentary housing expenses in response to a letter of complaint from Progressive party leader Jim Anderton. Two days later English stated that he would no longer take up any housing allowance and had paid back all the allowance he had received since the November 2008 election.

===Prime Minister (2016–2017)===

John Key resigned on 12 December, and endorsed English as his successor in the resulting leadership election. Following the drop-out of both Judith Collins and Jonathan Coleman from the leadership election, English was sworn in as the 39th Prime Minister of New Zealand on 12 December 2016.

English appointed his first cabinet on 18 December. In a reshuffle, he appointed Steven Joyce to succeed him as finance minister, while most ministerial portfolios remained the same.

In February 2017, English did not attend Waitangi Day commemorations at the historic treaty grounds, reportedly in response to the Ngāpuhi iwi&#x27;s decision to stop the Prime Minister from speaking at the marae. Ngāpuhi have protested the Government&#x27;s negotiation of the Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPPA), which the iwi believe infringes upon Māori sovereignty, and thus does not adhere to the Treaty of Waitangi. English had been invited to attend in an official capacity; his non-attendance was criticised by a Ngāpuhi elder and Opposition leader Andrew Little.

In his first overseas trip as prime minister, English travelled to Europe to discuss trade ties, including a prospective New Zealand–European Union free trade agreement. He first travelled to London on 13 January 2017 to meet British prime minister Theresa May. Discussing trade relations, English said the two nations were &quot;natural partners&quot; and would &quot;continue to forge ties&quot; after the UK&#x27;s withdrawal from the EU. He also arranged to meet with London Mayor Sadiq Khan, Belgian prime minister Charles Michel and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. In a meeting with Merkel, English received crucial backing from Germany for a trade deal with the EU. On 16 January, English stated that his government would continue to promote TPPA, despite the United States&#x27; decision to withdraw from the agreement. He explained that Southeast Asian countries would now be treated as a priority in negotiations—he also asserted that the United States was ceding influence to China by its rejection of the trade pact.

At a press conference at the Beehive on 1 February 2017, English announced that the 2017 general election would be held on 23 September. The Prime Minister later confirmed that his party would approach ACT, United Future and the Māori Party if confidence and supply agreements were required to form a government following the election. In his second cabinet reshuffle on 24 April, English appointed Gerry Brownlee as his new Foreign Affairs Minister; he also promoted Nikki Kaye to the portfolio of Education Minister, and moved Mark Mitchell into the cabinet to become Defence Minister. The reshuffle was perceived as an election preparation.

On 13 February 2017, English welcomed Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull to Wellington. The two leaders reaffirmed their shared trade agenda, and discussed changes to the Australian citizenship pathway which will affect permanent residents originating from New Zealand.

On 19 June, it was reported that Todd Barclay, who succeeded English as MP for Clutha-Southland, had clandestinely recorded one of his employee&#x27;s conversations the previous year, and that John Key&#x27;s leaders&#x27; budget was used to pay a confidential settlement after the employee resigned. English admitted that he had been aware of the illegal recording and the settlement, and thus implicated in the scandal.

During the 2017 National campaign launch, English introduced a $379 million social investment package including digital learning academies for high school students, more resources for mathematics, and boosting support for teaching second languages in schools, and maintaining National Standards in the school curriculum. Prime Minister English also sought to defend National&#x27;s financial management and economic track record and claimed that the opposition Labour Party would raise taxes. Early opinion polling had forecast a poor showing in the election for the Labour Party, but in early August 37-year-old Jacinda Ardern took over as Labour leader and seemingly energised younger voters.

At the 2017 general election, National won the largest share of the party vote (44.4%) and the largest number of seats (56) in the House of Representatives. However, National lacked enough seats to govern alone due to two of the party&#x27;s support partners, the Māori Party and United Future, losing their parliamentary seats. In response, English stated that the party would be entering into talks to form a coalition with New Zealand First. Following talks with the two largest parties, New Zealand First entered a coalition arrangement with the Labour Party. English was succeeded as prime minister by Jacinda Ardern on 26 October.

==Opposition (2017–2018)==
===Leader of the Opposition===
English was re-elected as National Party leader on 24 October 2017. At the time of his re-election, English announced his intention to stay on as leader until the next general election. On 13 February 2018, however, he stood down as National Party leader for personal reasons, and instructed the party to put into motion the processes to elect a new leader. He also retired from Parliament. English&#x27;s resignation followed weeks of speculation that he would step aside for a new leader. On 27 February, he was succeeded as party leader by Simon Bridges as the result of the leadership election held that day.

==Post-prime ministerial career==
In 2018, English joined the board of Australian conglomerate, Wesfarmers. English serves in Chairmanships of Mount Cook Alpine Salmon, Impact Lab Ltd and Manawanui Support Ltd. He is also a director of The Instillery, Centre for Independent Studies and The Todd Corporation Limited, and is a member of the Impact Advisory Group of Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets.

In mid December 2023, the National-led coalition government appointed English to lead an independent review into housing agency Kāinga Ora&#x27;s financial situation, procurement, and asset management. On 20 May 2024, English&#x27;s review found that Kāinga Ora exploited its easy access to Government credit and excessively borrowed without exercising fiscal discipline.

==Political and social views==

English is regarded as more socially conservative than his predecessor, John Key. He has stated his opposition to voluntary euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, same-sex civil unions, and the decriminalisation of prostitution. As prime minister he opposed any &quot;liberalisation&quot; of abortion law.

In 2004, English voted against a bill to establish civil unions for both same-sex and opposite-sex couples. In 2005, he voted for the Marriage (Gender Clarification) Amendment Bill, which would have amended the Marriage Act to define marriage as only between a man and a woman. English voted against the Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Bill, a bill that legalised same-sex marriage in New Zealand. However, in December 2016 he stated, &quot;I&#x27;d probably vote differently now on the gay marriage issue. I don&#x27;t think that gay marriage is a threat to anyone else&#x27;s marriage&quot;.

In 2009, English voted against the Misuse of Drugs (Medicinal Cannabis) Amendment Bill, a bill aimed at amending the Misuse of Drugs Act so that cannabis could be used for medical purposes.

== Personal life ==

English met his future wife, Mary Scanlon, at university. She was studying medicine at the time, and became a general practitioner. Both her parents were immigrants, her father being Samoan and her mother Italian, born on the island of Stromboli. They have six children: a daughter and five sons.

English is a practising Roman Catholic, but has stated that he considers his religious beliefs personal and thus separate from politics.

In June 2002, English took part in TV3&#x27;s &quot;Fight For Life&quot;, a celebrity boxing fundraiser to raise money for the Yellow Ribbon anti-youth-suicide campaign, influenced by the death of a teenage nephew in 1997. He lost a split decision to former university colleague Ted Clarke.

==Honours==

<doc id="351596" wikidata="Q1760034" url="?curid=351596" title="Machine (Static-X album)">
<text>Machine is the second studio album by American industrial metal band Static-X, released on May 22, 2001, and recorded at Studio 508 (Los Angeles). When compared to the band&#x27;s other albums, &quot;Machine&quot; features more electronics and industrial effects, and more screamed vocals from Wayne Static. It was also the final Static-X album for eighteen years to feature drummer Ken Jay (although he received songwriting credits on the band&#x27;s subsequent third album), and the last for four years to feature lead guitarist Koichi Fukuda, who, despite having already left Static-X, was credited as a keyboardist on the album.

==Background==
While the band toured &quot;Wisconsin Death Trip&quot;, Wayne Static wrote the entirety of this record by himself on the band&#x27;s tour bus while the rest of the band partied. Because of this isolated effort, when the band went in to record the record, Static insisted that royalties for the album&#x27;s sales would not be split an even four ways. This created tension in the band, leading to Fukuda&#x27;s departure before recording began and his eventual replacement with Tripp Eisen, and Jay&#x27;s departure just before recording for &quot;Shadow Zone&quot; began. Static played all the guitars on the album and Eisen was only involved with the album&#x27;s photoshoot.

==Promotion==
The song &quot;This Is Not&quot; provided the album&#x27;s first single and music video, and later a second single would be found in &quot;Black and White&quot;. The song &quot;Cold&quot; also had a video made for it, and tied in with the film &quot;Queen of the Damned&quot;. It was featured on the film&#x27;s soundtrack album, as was the exclusive &quot;Not Meant for Me&quot;, performed by Wayne Static who replaced Jonathan Davis who sings it in the movie. The song &quot;Anything but This&quot;, a bonus track from the Japanese version, is also found on the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; soundtrack. &quot;Otsego Undead&quot; was featured in the film &quot;Dracula 2000&quot;, as well as on its soundtrack.

==Reception==

Critical reaction to the album was mixed, the most positive reviews came from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot;. Terry Bezer of &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; stated in his review that &quot;It is impossible to put into words just how much Static X have progressed since their last effort. True enough, it&#x27;s not the most original of sounds (think Ministry crossed with Slipknot) but it does have all the enthusiasm of a bull charging for El Matador&#x27;s red cloth and twice the power.&quot;

Despite the mixed reviews, &quot;Machine&quot; sold around 500,000 copies in the USA, making it the band&#x27;s second most successful album (after &quot;Wisconsin Death Trip&quot;) and was certified Gold by the RIAA on November 10, 2003, a month after the release of &quot;Shadow Zone.&quot;

== Commercial performance ==
&quot;Machine&quot; debuted at No. 11 on the Billboard 200, selling 83,000 copies in its first week, becoming a chart and first week sales best for the band. The album spent 14 weeks on the chart. While not as successful as the last album, &quot;Machine&quot; has sold around 500,000 copies in the US, making it the band&#x27;s second most successful album (after &quot;Wisconsin Death Trip&quot;) and was certified Gold by the RIAA on November 10, 2003, a month after the release of &quot;Shadow Zone.&quot;

==Production==
In the unreleased Static-X DVD &quot;Where the Hell Are We and What Day Is It... This Is Static-X&quot;, it was commented that the songs for the album would have guitar solos; however, this didn&#x27;t happen.

The opening sample of the track &quot;A Dios Alma Perdida&quot;, a synthetic arrangement with a filtered voice speaking in what sounds at times like English (notably closing with an eerie &quot;It&#x27;s me!&quot;), is from the 1978 film &quot;Laserblast&quot;. This sample is an abbreviated version of a conversation between the aliens in that movie.

==Comic book==
A comic book series was created by Chaos! Comics entitled &quot;Static-X Machine.&quot; Only one volume was made as Chaos! declared bankruptcy shortly after its release. The comic was packaged with a CD containing one track, &quot;This Is Not (Live),&quot; as well as multimedia content featuring back stage interviews with the band and a live music video of &quot;This Is Not&quot; from the 2002 Machine tour.

<doc id="351599" wikidata="Q1460922" url="?curid=351599" title="Shadow Zone (Static-X album)">
<text>Shadow Zone is the third studio album by American industrial metal band Static-X, released on October 7, 2003. Marked by many personnel and stylistic changes, the album sports a much more melodic sound than any other work in their catalog, while still staying in the confines of their industrial metal and nu metal sound. It was the first of two albums to feature guitarist Tripp Eisen, and is the band&#x27;s only album to not feature an official drummer, due to the departure of Ken Jay just prior to the album&#x27;s recording sessions; drumming duties were subsequently handled by Josh Freese.

==Background==

In 2002, Static would be contacted by Jonathan Davis of the nu metal band Korn. Davis had recently signed on to provide the soundtrack for the &quot;Queen of the Damned&quot; film soundtrack, but due to contract limitations with Sony, was legally unable to actually perform the music he had written for the soundtrack. As a remedy of this, Davis contacted a number of metal vocalists, Static included, to sing on the songs he had written. Static provided vocals for one track, &quot;Not Meant for Me&quot;, with the &quot;Queen of the Damned&quot; soundtrack releasing in February 2002.

Meanwhile, prior to starting up sessions for a third album, tensions had grown high within the band. The band found success with their platinum-selling debut album, &quot;Wisconsin Death Trip&quot; in 1999, but dissatisfaction grew in the band in creating the follow-up, &quot;Machine&quot; in 2001. With their first album, the band had created it together, led by Static, whereas with the follow-up, the album was completely written by Static alone. Static had felt anxiety in being able to recreate the success of the first album, and resented the band for not helping him work on the second while touring. Concurrently, the rest of the band resented Static for leaving them out of the process when telling him they&#x27;d rather focus on touring. The move led original guitarist Koichi Fukuda to leave the band, and left the rest of the members largely upset with Static. Guitarist Tripp Eisen was brought in to replace Fukuda.

==Writing and recording==

Work on the album started in early 2002, and would span well over a year. Writing sessions began during the last of the band&#x27;s touring in support of &quot;Machine&quot;. By March 2002, the band had started their first jam sessions of the new material. Material would be demoed by the band in Static&#x27;s home studio in Burbank, California. However, Static would concede that his early demos sounded very different from the album&#x27;s eventual new direction. Static&#x27;s contribution to the &quot;Queen of the Damned&quot; soundtrack would prove to be a turning point for the band. The track, which was much more melodic than much of the band&#x27;s music up until that point, would attract the attention of Warner Bros. executive Tom Whalley, who pressured the band as a whole to pursue a melodic sound. Personnel and line-up changes would further alter the band&#x27;s sound. The label would not allow the band to work again with record producer Ulrich Wild as they had for their prior two albums, instead arranging for them to work with Josh Abraham, a producer known for working with more commercially melodically mainstream bands such as Staind, Filter, and Velvet Revolver. The album would also be the only album to feature Josh Freese of the band A Perfect Circle, on drums. Freese was a last minute addition to recording, after the resignation of drummer Ken Jay, who quit two days before the band was scheduled to enter the studio to start the recording process, due to being unhappy with the direction the album was heading.

All of this would fundamentally change how the band had worked on prior albums. The album would be the first to feature Eisen&#x27;s songwriting contributions and performances, which was a change for the band, since Fukuda had not historically written material for the band, and Static had performed all guitar parts on &quot;Machine&quot;. Eisen wrote around half of the material for the album, though it was largely described by him as &quot;a lot of collaborative efforts&quot; between band members. Static enjoyed collaborating with Eisen in the sessions stating that his &quot;punk rock attitude&quot; was refreshing and brought a new approach and sound to the album; while Static typically was more of a &quot;big picture&quot; person, with this album, he let Eisen take control of many of the musical ideas while he focused more so on vocals.

The band had amassed over 20 songs by March 2003, with five being revealed by name - &quot;Shadow Zone&quot;, &quot;The Only&quot;, &quot;New Pain&quot;, &quot;Deliver Me&quot;, and &quot;Breathe&quot;. Freese joined the sessions later, once the band had ironed out which songs were likely to make the cut. Prior albums employed the use of drum machines with Jay&#x27;s live cymbals edited in afterwards, whereas for &quot;Shadow Zone&quot;, the band opted to do the opposite; they wrote and demoed the songs with a drum machine, but chose to use Freese&#x27;s live drums after being very impressed with his work. Freese completed all of his drum parts in three days, even though he had never heard a single song prior to the sessions. Static explained his experience with Freese:

The dude is just amazing. It changed my life and it changed my perspective on drummers. We played the demo for him twice and he&#x27;d take down a couple of notes and then we&#x27;d run through the songs three times and then that was it and then we&#x27;d move onto the next song. We did three or four songs a day and then in three days we were done. I really got goose bumps on some of the shit he was doing. That was why I was willing to change things up and have the drummer come in and really be a part of things. Everything kind of changed and went in that different direction.&quot;

Recording sessions wrapped up by June 2003. While the band was unable to retain Wild as a producer, they were able to secure him for the album&#x27;s final mixing process.

==Sound==
While the album was still described commonly as industrial metal, nu metal, alternative metal, much like the rest of their work, &quot;Shadow Zone&quot; focused much more on melody than any other album in their catalog.

Static&#x27;s vocal performance on &quot;Shadow Zone&quot; was commonly compared by journalists as similar to Jonathan Davis of Korn. Allmusic also felt that his vocals on the second single, &quot;So&quot;, sounded similar to the vocals of Layne Staley of Alice in Chains.

==Release and promotion==
Recording the album wrapped up in June 2003, Nick Oshiro, prior drummer of the band Seether, joined the band shortly after the recording process to tour in support of the album, as Freese was always meant to just be a temporary session drummer for the album’s creation. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;The Only&quot;, was released to radio in August 2003. &quot;Shadow Zone&quot; was released on October 7, 2003. A second single, &quot;So&quot;, was later released in 2004.

==Reception==
The album debuted at no. 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 charts, selling 48,418 copies in its first week, just over half the number of their prior album, &quot;Machine&quot;. By January 2004, the album had sold 179,051 copies.

<doc id="351600" wikidata="Q334198" url="?curid=351600" title="John Baird, 1st Viscount Stonehaven">
<text>John Lawrence Baird, 1st Viscount Stonehaven, (27 April 1874 – 20 August 1941) was a British politician who served as the eighth Governor-General of Australia, in office from 1925 to 1930. He had previously been a government minister under David Lloyd George, Bonar Law, and Stanley Baldwin.

Baird was born in London, and attended Eton and Christ Church, Oxford. His father was Sir Alexander Baird, a Scottish-born civil servant who spent much of his life in Egypt. Baird was a member of the Diplomatic Service before winning election to the House of Commons in 1910, representing the Conservative Party. When war broke out a few years later, he joined the Intelligence Corps and won the Distinguished Service Order (DSO). Baird was added to the Lloyd George ministry in 1916, and held various junior portfolios until 1922 when he was appointed Minister of Transport and First Commissioner of Works.

In 1925, Baird was appointed Governor-General of Australia on the advice of Stanley Bruce. He was raised to the peerage as Baron Stonehaven, having previously succeeded to his father&#x27;s baronetcy in 1920. Lord Stonehaven was the first governor-general to live in Canberra, moving into Yarralumla in 1927 and presiding over the first sitting at the new Parliament House. After returning to Britain, Stonehaven served as Chairman of the Conservative Party from 1931 to 1936. He was raised to the viscountcy in 1938, and retired to his ancestral seat in Aberdeenshire.

==Early life==
Baird was born in Chelsea, London, son of Sir Alexander Baird, 1st Baronet, and wife The Hon. Annette Maria, daughter of Lawrence Palk, 1st Baron Haldon.

He was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford, but left university without graduating. He was commissioned in the Lanarkshire Yeomanry (later the Scottish Horse). In 1894 he served as an &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; to the Governor of New South Wales, then entered the diplomatic service. He was appointed Second Secretary in September 1902, and became a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1904, before he retired from the Diplomatic Service in 1908.

He was a Deputy Lieutenant for Kincardineshire from 5 January 1900.

==Political career 1910–1924==
Baird was elected to the House of Commons for Rugby in the January 1910 general election as a Conservative, and was private secretary to the Leader of the Conservative Party, Bonar Law, between 1911 and 1916. He also fought in the First World War where he was mentioned in despatches and awarded the Distinguished Service Order. He entered David Lloyd George&#x27;s coalition government as Parliamentary Secretary to the Air Board in December 1916, an office that was renamed Parliamentary Secretary to the Air Council in November 1917. In January 1919 he became Joint Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Munitions. Already in April 1919, he was made Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, which he remained until the coalition government fell in October 1922.

Bonar Law became Prime Minister the same month, and appointed Baird Minister of Transport and First Commissioner of Works. He was sworn of the Privy Council a few days later. In the November 1922 general election, he was returned for Ayr Burghs. He continued as First Commissioner of Works and Minister of Transport also when Stanley Baldwin became Prime Minister in May 1923 and held them until January 1924, when Ramsay MacDonald&#x27;s Labour government took office.

==Governor-General of Australia==

In December, after the Conservatives returned to power, he accepted the position of Governor-General of Australia offered to him by Australian Prime Minister Stanley Bruce, who opted for Baird partly because of his political experience and partly because he was a more modest figure than the aristocratic alternatives. In June 1925, he was raised to the peerage as Baron Stonehaven, of Ury in the County of Kincardine, and appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG).

Lord Stonehaven arrived in Australia in October 1925. He quickly established good relations with Bruce, with whom he had much in common. But, like his predecessor, he found that Australian Prime Ministers no longer wanted a Governor-General acting as an Imperial overseer, or as a representative of the British government, but merely as discreet figureheads. The 1926 Imperial Conference in London recognised the &quot;de facto&quot; independence of the Dominions, and ended the role of the Governors-General as diplomats and as channels of communication between governments. From now on, the Governor-General&#x27;s sole role was to be a personal representative of the Crown.

There were other changes during Stonehaven&#x27;s term. In May 1927, he formally opened the first meeting of the Australian Parliament in the newly built Parliament House in Canberra, and the Governor-General was at last given a permanent residence, Government House, Canberra, commonly known by the previous name of the house, &quot;Yarralumla&quot;. This meant an end to travelling between government houses in Sydney and Melbourne and made the post of Governor-General less expensive. At the same time, the advent of aviation, of which Stonehaven was a keen exponent, made travelling around Australia much easier.

For most of Stonehaven&#x27;s term, Bruce seemed firmly entrenched in office but, in September 1929, he was unexpectedly defeated on the floor of the House of Representatives, and asked Stonehaven for a dissolution. Although the Parliament was only a year old, Stonehaven agreed at once: the days when Governors-General exercised a discretion in this area had passed.

Bruce&#x27;s party was defeated at the October election, and Bruce also lost his own seat. The Labor leader, James Scullin, took office in January 1930. Stonehaven&#x27;s relations with Scullin were correct but not friendly, since his political sympathies lay elsewhere. It was probably fortunate for him that his term expired before the crises of the Scullin government began. Stonehaven left Australia on 2 October 1930, at which point his successor had not been determined; Lord Somers, the Governor of Victoria, took over as Administrator of the Commonwealth until a permanent successor, Sir Isaac Isaacs, took office in January 1931.

===Freemasonry===
Stonehaven was a freemason. During his term as Governor-General (1925–1930), he was also Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of New South Wales.

==Later life==
On his return to Britain, he was appointed Chairman of the Conservative Party in 1931, a post he held until 1936. In 1938, he was further honoured when he was made Viscount Stonehaven, of Ury in the County of Kincardine.

==Family==
Stonehaven married Lady Ethel Sydney Keith-Falconer, daughter of the 9th Earl of Kintore, in 1905. The couple had two sons and three daughters. Lord Stonehaven died of hypertensive cardiac disease at Ury House, Stonehaven, Scotland, in August 1941, aged 67, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Ian. The Viscountess Stonehaven succeeded her elder brother as eleventh Countess of Kintore in 1966. She died in September 1974, one day after her 100th birthday.

<text>Crystal Falls was a small community that existed midway between St. Jovite and Arundel on Route 327 in the province of Quebec, Canada. The community no longer exists but can still be found in the Toponomie Quebec of the province of Quebec. There was a post office, a school, a cheese factory, a combination water-powered grist and sawmill and a Presbyterian Church - Knox Church Crystal Falls.

All that remains of the original settlement is the church which is now maintained by the Knox Church Crystal Falls Memorial Fund - a non-profit charitable organization dedicated to the preservation of the church and cemetery at Crystal Falls. The mill burned in 1919 and the post office is now a private home.

In September 2002, a ceremony was held to illuminate Knox Church Crystal Falls. The church is to be perpetually lit at night as a beacon along Route 327. On May 29, 2021, the church was burned to the ground by vandals.

<doc id="351603" wikidata="Q1443672" url="?curid=351603" title="Piloting">
<text>Piloting or pilotage is the process of navigating on water or in the air using fixed points of reference on the sea or on land, usually with reference to a nautical chart or aeronautical chart to obtain a fix of the position of the vessel or aircraft with respect to a desired course or location. Horizontal fixes of position from known reference points may be obtained by sight or by radar. Vertical position may be obtained by depth sounder to determine depth of the water body below a vessel or by altimeter to determine an aircraft&#x27;s altitude, from which its distance above the ground can be deduced. Piloting a vessel is usually practiced close to shore or on inland waterways. Pilotage of an aircraft is practiced under visual meteorological conditions for flight.

Land navigation is a related discipline, using a topographic map, especially when applied over trackless terrain. Divers use related techniques for underwater navigation.

== Piloting references ==
=== Charts ===
Depending on whether one is navigating on a water course, in the air or on land, a different chart applies for the navigator:
*&quot;Nautical charts&quot; – show coastal regions and depict depths of water and land features, natural features of the seabed, details of the coastline, navigational hazards, locations of natural and human-made aids to navigation, and human-made structures such as harbours, buildings and bridges.
*&quot;Aeronautical charts&quot; – for visual meteorological conditions depict terrain, geographic features, navigational aids and other aids to navigation. They vary in scale from 1:1,000,000 for world aeronautical charts to 1:250,000.
*&quot;Topographic maps&quot; – show landforms and terrain, lakes and rivers, forest cover, administrative areas, populated areas, roads and railways, and other man-made features.

=== Maritime piloting ===

Coastal mariners often use reference manuals, called &quot;pilots&quot; for navigating coastal waters. In addition to providing descriptions of shipping channels and coastal profiles, they discuss weather, currents and other topics of interest to mariners. Notable guides include a worldwide series of &quot;Sailing Directions&quot; by the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office (formerly by the British Admiralty) that includes, most notably, the English Channel, the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. Another series worldwide series of Sailing Directions is by the US National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, which has planning guide and enroute portions. The &quot;United States Coast Pilot&quot;, by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Office of Coast Survey, covers the coastal and intracoastal waters and the Great Lakes of the United States.

== Points of reference ==
Common types of visual reference point used for piloting and pilotage include:

=== Day ===
* Natural features: Mountains, hills, lakes, rivers and coastal features such as cliffs, rocks and beaches
* Navigational aids: sea marks (including buoys and beacons) and landmarks
* Other structures: Airports, cities, dams, highways, and radio antennas

=== Night ===
* Lighted navigational aids: Lighthouses, lightvessels and lighted sea marks
* Lighted structures: Airports, illuminated towers and buildings

=== Vertical ===
Depth, measured with a depth sounder or lead line, can be used to identify a bathymetric contour or crossing point. Similarly, elevation can be used to confirm a geographic contour or crossing point. Measurement of depth and altitude allow vessels and aircraft navigators to confirm clear passage over obstructions.

== Fix of position ==


=== Instruments used ===
On shipboard, navigators may use a pelorus to obtain bearings, relative to the vessel, from charted objects. A hand bearing compass provides magnetic bearings. On land a hand compass provides bearings to landmarks.

=== Afloat ===
Mariners use position-fixing navigation, to obtain a &quot;position fix&quot; or &quot;fix&quot; by measuring the bearing of the navigator&#x27;s current position from known points of reference. A visual fix of position can be made by using any sighting device with a bearing indicator to obtain position lines from the navigator&#x27;s current position to each point of reference. Two or more objects of known position are sighted as points of reference, and the bearings recorded. Bearing lines or transits are then plotted on a chart through the locations of the sighted items. The intersection of these lines is then the current position of the navigator.

Usually, a fix is where two or more position lines intersect at any given time. If three position lines can be obtained, the resulting &quot;cocked hat&quot;, where the 3 lines do not intersect at the same point, but create a triangle where the vessel is inside, gives the navigator an indication of the accuracy in the three separate position lines.

If two geographic features are visually aligned (the edge of an island aligned with the edge of an island behind, a flag pole and a building, etc.), the extension of the line joining the features is called a &quot;transit&quot;. A transit is not affected by compass accuracy, and is often used to check a compass for errors.

The most accurate fixes occur when the position lines are at right angles to each other.

=== Aloft ===
Flying at low altitudes and with sufficient visibility, aircraft pilots use nearby rivers, roads, railroad tracks and other visual references to establish their position.

== Course versus ground track ==

The line connecting fixes is the track over the ground or sea bottom. The navigator compares the ground track with the navigational course for that leg of the intended route, in order to make a correction in &quot;heading&quot;, the direction in which the craft is pointed to maintain its course in compensation for cross-currents of wind or water that may carry the craft off course.

== In channels and rivers ==
Where a channel is narrow, as in some harbor entrances and on some rivers, a system of beacons allows mariners to align pairs of daymarks, called &quot;range markers&quot;, to form a &quot;leading line&quot; (British English) or &quot;range axis&quot; (American English), along which to navigate safely. When lighted, these markers are called &quot;leading lights&quot; (British English) or &quot;range lights&quot; (American English). The relative positions of the marks and the vessel affect the accuracy of perceiving the leading line.

<text>Saale-Orla is a &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) in the east of Thuringia, Germany. Neighboring districts are (from the north clockwise) the districts Saale-Holzland, Greiz, the Vogtlandkreis in Saxony, the Bavarian districts Hof and Kronach, and the district Saalfeld-Rudolstadt.

==History==
The district was created in 1994 by merging the previous districts Lobenstein, Pößneck and Schleiz.
==Geography==
The main rivers in the district are the Saale and the Orla, which also contributed to the name of the district. The highest elevation with 732.9 m above sea level is the Sieglitzberg (near Lobenstein), the lowest with 180 m is near Schimmersburg Langenorla. The district is mountainous, covering the &quot;Thüringer Schiefergebirge&quot;. The dams of the Saale create the biggest system of artificial lakes in Germany.

==Coat of arms==
The two lions in the top of the coat of arms represent the historic states which covered the area in the past. In the left is the lion with crown of the Reuß family, while the lion to the right is the symbol of the margravate of Meißen. The two wavy lines at the bottom symbolize the two rivers of the district, Saale and Orla.

<text>Princess Stephanie of Windisch-Graetz (9 July 1909 in Ploskovice, Bohemia – 7 September 2005 in Uccle, Belgium) was the daughter of Archduchess Elisabeth Marie of Austria (1883–1963), only child of Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria and Princess Stéphanie of Belgium, and Prince Otto Weriand of Windisch-Graetz (1873–1952). She was the great-grandchild of Emperor Franz-Joseph and Empress Elisabeth (&#x27;Sissi&#x27;) of Austria. She was also the great-grandchild of King Leopold II of Belgium.

Her full name was &quot;Stéphanie Eleonore Maria Elisabeth Kamilla Philomena Veronika zu Windisch-Grätz&quot; in German, and &quot;Stéphanie Éléonore Marie Élisabeth Camille Philomène Véronique de Windisch-Grätz&quot; in French. She may have been named after her maternal grandmother, Princess Stéphanie of Belgium. Her nickname in the family was Fée.

==Parents&#x27; separation, effect on life==
As a child she suffered greatly from her mother&#x27;s frequent absences, and her parents&#x27; inharmonious marriage. The couple was separated in 1924 and divorced in 1948. Her mother came to live in Brussels with the four children and Princess Clementine of Belgium offered a friendly refuge to Stéphanie.

In 1921, Archduchess Elisabeth had begun a relationship with the Austrian socialist member of parliament Leopold Petznek, whom she eventually married in 1948. Stéphanie got along well with her stepfather, but her relationship with her mother was not very good, and worsened after her second marriage. Archduchess Elisabeth did not like Karl-Axel Björklund, and forbade him to be in her house. Stéphanie financially supported her father Otto Weriand in later life.

Stéphanie had three elder brothers:
* Prince Franz Joseph zu Windisch-Grätz (1904 in Prague – 1981 in Nairobi), married to Ghislaine d&#x27;Arschot Schoonhoven (1912–1997) and father of
** Princess Stéphanie Windisch-Graetz (1939–2019) became an artist, known for her photographic portraits using only candles as a source of light and for her sensual images from the animal world. She married Dermot Blundell-Hollinshead-Blundell (1935–2009) (a descendant of Nicholas Blundell). They are the parents of:
*** Henry Victor William Blundell-Hollinshead-Blundell (born 1967) 
*** Alexander Otto Blundell-Hollinshead-Blundell (born 1969), whose surname was changed to &quot;de Windisch-Graetz&quot; in Belgium in 2011.
** Prince Guillaume Franz Josef Maria Windisch-Graetz (born 1950; unmarried).
* Prince Ernst zu Windisch-Grätz (1905–1952)
* Prince Rudolf zu Windisch-Grätz (1907–1939)

==First marriage==
In 1933, Stéphanie married Count Pierre d&#x27;Alcantara de Querrieu (2 November 1907 – 14 October 1944). Count d&#x27;Alcantara was the son of Jean d&#x27;Alcantara de Querrieu and Baroness Marie-Lucie t&#x27;Kint de Roodenbeeke. Count d&#x27;Alcantara was a member of the household of King Leopold III. In 1942 he was arrested by the Gestapo and died two years later in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. She had one child by her first husband:
* Count Alvar Etienne d&#x27;Alcantara de Querrieu (30 July 1935 – 5 August 2019)

==Second marriage==

In 1945, after the death of her husband, she married Karl-Axel Björklund (1906–1986). She had one child by her second husband:
* Bjorn-Axel Björklund (20 October 1944 – 7 September 1995)

==Later life==
During her long life, Stéphanie traveled extensively, especially in Africa, where her brother François-Joseph lived in Kenya, and also in South America, particularly in Argentina.

<doc id="351608" wikidata="Q740312" url="?curid=351608" title="Xiahou Ba">
<text>Xiahou Ba (died 255–259), courtesy name Zhongquan, was a Chinese military general of the state of Cao Wei in the Three Kingdoms period of China. He was the second son of Xiahou Yuan, a prominent general who served under Cao Cao, the warlord who laid the foundation for the state of Cao Wei. Around 249, Xiahou Ba defected to Wei&#x27;s rival state, Shu Han, after the regent Sima Yi seized power in a coup d&#x27;état. He died sometime between 255 and 259.

==Service under Cao Wei==
===Early career===
Xiahou Ba&#x27;s parents were important figures in Cao Wei; his father, Xiahou Yuan, had fought alongside his distant cousin and founder of Wei, Cao Cao, since the start of the civil war, and was one of the most trusted of Cao&#x27;s generals, while Xiahou Ba&#x27;s mother was a sister-in-law of Cao Cao. After Xiahou Yuan was killed at Battle of Mount Dingjun in 219 at the hands of Shu general, Huang Zhong, most of his troops were placed under the command of Zhang He upon advice from Guo Huai, while his private militia and guards were succeeded by his five sons. Xiahou Ba displayed great hatred for Shu, and vowed revenge for his father. In 220, Xiahou Yuan&#x27;s eldest son Xiahou Heng was given his own marquisate and marquis title, so Xiahou Ba inherited his father&#x27;s marquis title with a stipend of tax revenues from 800 taxable households.

===Mid career===

In 230, when the Wei general Cao Zhen proposed a shift from defensive to offensive stance against Shu Han, Lieutenant-General (偏将军) Xiahou Ba was named as the vanguard. He then led a force towards Hanzhong Commandery taking a route through the 330 km Ziwu Trail (子午道), and camped in a crooked gorge, near the Xingshi camp set up earlier by Shu general, Wei Yan. There, Xiahou Ba was identified by the local residents, who reported his presence to the Shu forces, and was under heavy attack. As the main army of Cao Zhen had not caught up with the vanguard, Xiahou Ba was thrown into a grave situation, where he was forced to rely on personal skills to fight his enemies between barricades until Cao Zhen arrived.

The two forces reached a stalemate and the standoff lasted for a few months, but the developments favoured the Shu side as continuous rainfall over a month had rendered narrow valleys impassable, resulting in Wei army&#x27;s logistical difficulty. In addition to the disadvantageous weather, Wei Yan had penetrated to the Wei army&#x27;s rear and successfully incited some non-Han tribes to oppose the Wei forces, so Cao Zhen and Xiahou Ba begrudgingly decided to retreat. Since then, Xiahou Ba was appointed General of the Right, and stationed in Longxi Commandery to train troops; he personally cared for his soldiers and established friendly relation with the foreign tribes (Xirong people) of the region hence he acquired their admiration.

===As a trusted aide of Cao Shuang===
In the 240s, Xiahou Ba was enfeoffed as the Marquis of Bochang Village and became a close associate of Cao Shuang, Cao Zhen&#x27;s son and a regent to the Wei emperor Cao Fang. When Cao Shuang decided to wage war against Shu to enhance his personal influence and reputation, Xiahou Ba was made Protector of the Army and came under command of Xiahou Xuan, who was the marquis&#x27;s son in the clan. For the ensuing campaign, however, the Wei general Guo Huai, whom Xiahou Ba disliked, had the honour of leading the vanguard. This time, Wei forces chose the shorter Tangluo Trail into Shu territory, but again experienced logistic problems as a long section of the trail had no water source. As a result, the Wei forces had no choice but to retreat, and many soldiers merely died of thirst along the way back. After the war, Guo Huai, due to his timely withdrawal of troops, was granted a higher military authority over Xiahou Ba.

From 244 to 249, Xiahou Ba played into the hands of Guo Huai, who wielded power to temporarily command him when a military crisis arose. In 247, when some tribal leaders rebelled against Wei, Xiahou Ba came under attack by the Shu general Jiang Wei, who came to support the tribes. Together with Guo Huai, Xiahou Ba repelled Jiang Wei&#x27;s attack and struck back at the rebels, forcing many of them to surrender. However, E Zhesai (蛾遮塞) of the Qiang tribes and Zhi Wudai (治无戴) of the Hu tribes still persevered, so the war was fragmented into battles that dragged on to 248, wherein Jiang Wei again led Shu forces to the aid of the rebels.

At this point, it is clear that Guo Huai, instead of Xiahou Xuan, was the actual commander on the field to give out orders. For instance, when Guo Huai decided to attack Jiang Wei&#x27;s subordinate, Liao Hua, Xiahou Ba was ordered directly by the decision maker to tail Jiang Wei&#x27;s main troop to the west. Upon knowing Liao Hua was under attack, Jiang Wei harshly returned to his aide&#x27;s assistance just as Guo Huai predicted, isolating the rebels from Shu reinforcement. As the Shu commander was worn out from the travel, so was Xiahou Ba, but the glory and merit of subjugating the rebellion went to Guo Huai, who was promoted to a district marquis for his achievements. On the contrary, Xiahou Ba virtually received nothing for his effort in the campaign.

==Service under Shu==
===Defection from Wei to Shu===
In 249, after a coup d&#x27;état by Sima Yi against Cao Shuang, a lot of the latter&#x27;s affiliates were also put to death; being a close friend and associate of Cao Shuang, Xiahou Ba was sensitive to the political developments and grew suspicious of Sima Yi&#x27;s faction. Soon, Xiahou Xuan, who had the staff of authority to command troops over Liang and Yong provinces, was ordered to the capital under the guise of a promotion. Fraught with dread, Xiahou Ba discussed the issue with Xiahou Xuan, and persuaded the latter to flee with him to Shu. But Xiahou Xuan refused and said &quot;I won&#x27;t live as a guest in a kingdom of barbarians!&quot; What further perturbed Xiahou Ba was the person who succeeded Xiahou Xuan&#x27;s former position was none other than Guo Huai, whom Xiahou Ba had a personal feud with. Therefore, Xiahou Ba embarked on his lone journey into Shu.

On his way to Shu, Xiahou Ba lost his way and went into a dead end in a valley, where he ran out of food and resorted to killing his horse, taking the carcass as a last supper. He kept walking until his legs were crippled, then he laid beneath a shadow projected from a large rock, and asked travellers for direction, but still could not figure out how to get out from the dead end. When the locals reported the presence of a lame beggar who looked like the great general Xiahou Ba who attacked them years ago, the Shu emperor, Liu Shan, hurriedly sent a rescue team to escort his uncle-in-law to the Shu capital, Chengdu.

Years ago, Xiahou Ba&#x27;s cousin, Lady Xiahou, was abducted by the Shu general Zhang Fei and became his wife. As a consequence, the Liu clan and Xiahou clan were linked together though Liu Shan&#x27;s marriage with Zhang Fei&#x27;s daughter. That was why Liu Shan called his son a grandnephew of the Xiahou family. Whether it was for political reasons or a private family issue, Liu Shan appointed the handicapped Xiahou Ba as General of Chariots and Cavalry in Shu.

===Later life in Shu===
Nevertheless, Jiang Wei apparently befriended Xiahou Ba, and the duo went on several campaigns against the state of Wei. The Wei imperial court pardoned Xiahou Ba&#x27;s sons on account of Xiahou Yuan&#x27;s role in the founding of Wei. Instead they were exiled to Lelang Commandery in present-day North Korea.

At the time Xiahou Ba was already a sexagenarian, if not a septuagenarian, he was still active in social life. A story about that was recorded in Yi Bu Qijiu Zhuan (益部耆舊傳), which says an eager Xiahou Ba once wanted to befriend Zhang Ni, who was famous for subjugating the southern barbarians and was one of the most celebrated Shu generals back then. When Xiahou Ba first met Zhang Ni, he told him, &quot;Although I&#x27;m not close to you, I have already entrusted wholly to you for a long time, I hope you would understand this.&quot; Zhang Ni responded, &quot;I don&#x27;t know you, and you don&#x27;t know me. The rationale is on the other end, how can you say you rely on me? I hope you save your words and continue this talk three years later.&quot; This incident was circulated within Shu, and knowledgeable persons and scholars found this anecdote worthy of Xiahou Ba and Zhang Ni character.

As a newcomer from Wei, Xiahou Ba must have had faced discrimination and distrust from his colleagues, but due to his complicated background, he was trusted by Liu Shan, and highly valued by another defector of Wei, Jiang Wei. Once, Jiang Wei asked Xiahou Ba if Sima Yi, who gained control of Wei court, would attack Shu, Xiahou Ba replied, &quot;they just recently established hegemony, so they will not indulge in foreign affairs. However, there is a young Zhong Hui, who will be a threat to both Wu and Shu.&quot; Believing Xiahou Ba&#x27;s views that Sima Yi would not handle border issues for some time, Jiang Wei revived Zhuge Liang&#x27;s strategy on constantly waging wars against Wei, and brought Xiahou Ba with him on his expeditions. Xiahou Ba distinguished himself in Jiang Wei&#x27;s greatest victory in his campaigns, which was the Battle of Didao, after that battle, Xiahou Ba was not mentioned again in historic records.

==Date of death and birth==
According to &quot;Records of Three Kingdoms&quot;, Xiahou Ba succeeded Deng Zhi as the General of Chariots and Cavalry after the predecessor&#x27;s death in 251. &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot; noted that Xiahou Ba was alive in 255, and &quot;Records of Three Kingdoms&quot; noted that Xiahou Ba was not alive in 259, when Liao Hua and Zhang Yi were recorded to have succeeded his general position, so Xiahou Ba must have had died between 255 and 259. His birth date isn&#x27;t recorded as well. However, the &quot;Weilüe&quot; indicated that a younger cousin of Xiahou Ba was captured by Zhang Fei while she was gathering firewood at the age of 12-13 in the year 200, which meant that Xiahou Ba must have been born before 187-188.

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==
In the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, Xiahou Ba&#x27;s death was altered. When the invasion of Shu occurred in 262, Xiahou Ba defended Shu. At the Battle of Taoyang, he was killed by the arrows and stones that were thrown by the Wei forces laying in wait on the cliffs.

==In popular culture==
Xiahou Ba is first introduced as a playable character in the seventh installment of Koei&#x27;s &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; video game series.

<text>Avebury () is a Neolithic henge monument containing three stone circles, around the village of Avebury in Wiltshire, in south-west England. One of the best-known prehistoric sites in Britain, it contains the largest megalithic stone circle in the world. It is both a tourist attraction and a place of religious importance to contemporary pagans.

Constructed over several hundred years in the third millennium BC, during the Neolithic, or New Stone Age, the monument comprises a large henge (a bank and a ditch) with a large outer stone circle and two separate smaller stone circles situated inside the centre of the monument. Its original purpose is unknown, although archaeologists believe that it was most likely used for some form of ritual or ceremony. The Avebury monument is a part of a larger prehistoric landscape containing several older monuments nearby, including West Kennet Long Barrow, Windmill Hill and Silbury Hill.

By the Iron Age, the site had been effectively abandoned, with some evidence of human activity on the site during the Roman period. During the Early Middle Ages, a village first began to be built around the monument, eventually extending into it. In the late medieval and early modern periods, local people destroyed many of the standing stones around the henge, both for religious and practical reasons. The antiquarians John Aubrey and William Stukeley took an interest in Avebury during the 17th and 18th centuries, respectively, and recorded much of the site between various phases of destruction. Archaeological investigation followed in the 20th century, with Harold St George Gray leading an excavation of the bank and ditch, and Alexander Keiller overseeing a project to reconstruct much of the monument.

Avebury is owned and managed by the National Trust. It has been designated a Scheduled Ancient Monument, as well as a World Heritage Site, in the latter capacity being seen as a part of the wider prehistoric landscape of Wiltshire known as Stonehenge, Avebury and Associated Sites. About 480 people live in 235 homes in the village of Avebury and its associated settlement of Avebury Trusloe, and in the nearby hamlets of Beckhampton and West Kennett.

== Location and environment ==

At , Avebury is respectively about from the modern towns of Marlborough and Calne. The monuments at the Avebury World Heritage Site cover about . Avebury lies in an area of chalkland in the Upper Kennet Valley that forms the catchment for the River Kennet and supports local springs and seasonal watercourses. The monument stands slightly above the local landscape, sitting on a low chalk ridge above sea level; to the east are the Marlborough Downs, an area of lowland hills.

The site lies at the centre of a collection of Neolithic and early Bronze Age monuments and was inscribed as a World Heritage Site in a co-listing with the monuments at Stonehenge, to the south, in 1986. It is now listed as part of the &quot;Stonehenge, Avebury and Associated Sites World Heritage Site&quot;. The monuments are preserved as part of a Neolithic and Bronze Age landscape for the information they provide regarding prehistoric people&#x27;s relationship with the landscape.

Radiocarbon dating and analysis of pollen and occasionally insects in buried soils have shown that the environment of lowland Britain changed around 4250–4000 BC. During the Neolithic period, argillic (clayey) brownearths reigned in the landscape formed by the acidifying conditions of a closed woodland, becoming more chalky as a result of clearance and anthropogenic (human-made) interference.

The area was originally a mix of deep argillic brownearths on clay-rich areas along with calcareous (chalky) brownearths that were &quot;predisposed&quot; to transforming into grassland. The change to a grassland environment from damp, heavy soils and expanses of dense forest was mostly brought about by farmers, probably through the use of slash and burn techniques. Environmental factors may also have made a contribution. The long grassland area formed a dense vegetational mat which eventually led to the decalcification of the soil profile. In the Mesolithic period, woodland was dominated by alder, lime, elm and oak. There is a major decline in pollen around 4500 BC, but an increase in grasses from 4500 BC to 3200 BC and the first occurrence of cereal pollen.

Pollen is poorly preserved in the chalky soils found around Avebury, so the best evidence for the state of local environment at any time in the past comes from the study of the deposition of snail shells. Different species of snail live in specific habitats, so the presence of a certain species indicates what the area was like at a particular time.

The available evidence suggests that in the early Neolithic, Avebury and the surrounding hills were covered in dense oak woodland, and as the Neolithic progressed, the woodland around Avebury and the nearby monuments receded and was replaced by grassland.

== Mesolithic and Neolithic history ==

The history of the site before the construction of the henge is uncertain, because little datable evidence has emerged from modern archaeological excavations. Evidence of activity in the region before the 4th millennium BC is limited, suggesting that there was little human occupation.

=== Mesolithic ===

What is now termed the Mesolithic period in Britain lasted from circa 11,600 to 7,800 BP, at a time when the island was heavily forested and when there was still a land mass, called Doggerland, which connected Britain to continental Europe. During this era, those humans living in Britain were hunter-gatherers, often moving around the landscape in small familial or tribal groups in search of food and other resources. Archaeologists have unearthed evidence that there were some of these hunter-gatherers active around Avebury during the Late Mesolithic, with stray finds of flint tools, dated between 7000 and 4000 BC, having been found in the area. The most important of these discoveries is a densely scattered collection of worked flints found to the west of Avebury, which has led archaeologists to believe that that spot was a flint working site occupied over a period of several weeks by a group of nomadic hunter-gatherers who had set up camp there.

The archaeologists Mark Gillings and Joshua Pollard suggested the possibility that Avebury first gained some sort of ceremonial significance during the Late Mesolithic period. As evidence, they highlighted the existence of a posthole near the monument&#x27;s southern entrance that would have once supported a large wooden post. Although this posthole was never dated when it was excavated in the early 20th century, and so cannot definitely be ascribed to the Mesolithic, Gillings and Pollard noted that its positioning had no relation to the rest of the henge, and that it may therefore have been erected centuries or even millennia before the henge was actually built. They compared this with similar wooden posts that had been erected in southern Britain during the Mesolithic at Stonehenge and Hambledon Hill, both of which were sites that like Avebury saw the construction of large monuments in the Neolithic.

=== Early Neolithic ===

In the 4th millennium BC, around the start of the Neolithic period in Britain, British society underwent radical changes. These coincided with the introduction of domesticated species of animals and plants, as well as a changing material culture that included pottery. These developments allowed hunter-gatherers to settle down and produce their own food. As agriculture spread, people cleared land. At the same time, they also erected the first monuments to be seen in the local landscape, an activity interpreted as evidence of a change in the way people viewed their place in the world.

Based on anthropological studies of recent and contemporary societies, Gillings and Pollard suggest that forests, clearings, and stones were important in Neolithic culture, not only as resources but as symbols; the site of Avebury occupied a convergence of these three elements. Neolithic activity at Avebury is evidenced by flint, animal bones, and pottery such as Peterborough ware dating from the early 4th and 3rd millennia BC. Five distinct areas of Neolithic activity have been identified within of Avebury; they include a scatter of flints along the line of the West Kennet Avenue—an avenue that connects Avebury with the Neolithic site of The Sanctuary. Pollard suggests that areas of activity in the Neolithic became important markers in the landscape.

=== Late Neolithic ===
During the Late Neolithic, British society underwent another series of major changes. Between 3500 and 3300 BC, these prehistoric Britons ceased their continual expansion and cultivation of wilderness and instead focused on settling and farming the most agriculturally productive areas of the island: Orkney, eastern Scotland, Anglesey, the upper Thames, Wessex, Essex, Yorkshire and the river valleys of the Wash.

Late Neolithic Britons also appeared to have changed their religious beliefs, ceasing to construct the large chambered tombs that are widely thought by archaeologists to have been connected with ancestor veneration. Instead, they began the construction of large wooden or stone circles, with many hundreds being built across Britain and Ireland over a period of a thousand years.

== Construction ==
The chronology of Avebury&#x27;s construction is unclear. It was not designed as a single monument, but is the result of various projects that were undertaken at different times during late prehistory. Aubrey Burl suggests dates of 3000 BC for the central cove, 2900 BC for the inner stone circle, 2600 BC for the outer circle and henge, and around 2400 BC for the avenues.

The construction of large monuments such as those at Avebury indicates that a stable agrarian economy had developed in Britain by around 4000–3500 BC. The people who built them had to be secure enough to spend time on such non-essential activities. Avebury was one of a group of monumental sites that were established in this region during the Neolithic. Its monuments comprise the henge and associated long barrows, stone circles, avenues and a causewayed enclosure. These monument types are not exclusive to the Avebury area. For example, Stonehenge features the same kinds of monuments, and in Dorset there is a henge on the edge of Dorchester and a causewayed enclosure at nearby Maiden Castle. According to archaeologist Caroline Malone, who worked for English Heritage as an inspector of monuments and was the curator of Avebury&#x27;s Alexander Keiller Museum, it is possible that the monuments associated with Neolithic sites such as Avebury and Stonehenge constituted ritual or ceremonial centres.

Archaeologist Mike Parker Pearson noted that the addition of the stones to the henge occurred at a similar date to the construction of Silbury Hill and the major building projects at Stonehenge and Durrington Walls. For this reason, he speculated that there may have been a &quot;religious revival&quot; at the time, which led to huge amounts of resources being expended on the construction of ceremonial monuments.

Archaeologist Aaron Watson highlighted the possibility that by digging up earth and using it to construct the large banks, those Neolithic labourers constructing the Avebury monument symbolically saw themselves as turning the land &quot;inside out&quot;, thereby creating a space that was &quot;on a frontier between worlds above and beneath the ground.&quot;

=== Henge ===

The Avebury monument is a henge, a type of monument consisting of a large circular bank with an internal ditch. The henge is not perfectly circular and measures in diameter and over in circumference.

Radiocarbon dating suggests that the henge was made by the middle of the third millennium BC.

The top of the bank is irregular, something Caroline Malone suggested was because of the irregular nature of the work undertaken by excavators working on the adjacent sectors of the ditch. Later archaeologists such as Aaron Watson, Mark Gillings and Joshua Pollard have, however, suggested that this was an original Neolithic feature of the henge&#x27;s architecture.

=== Outer Stone Circle ===

Within the henge is a great outer circle. With a diameter of , this is one of Europe&#x27;s largest stone circles, and Britain&#x27;s largest. It was either contemporary with, or built around four or five centuries after, the earthworks. It is thought that there were originally 98 sarsen standing stones, some weighing in excess of 40 tons. The stones varied in height from to , as exemplified at the north and south entrances. Radiocarbon dating of some stone settings indicate a construction date of around 2870–2200 BC.

The two large stones at the Southern Entrance had an unusually smooth surface, likely due to having stone axes polished on them.

=== Inner Stone Circles ===
Nearer the middle of the monument are two additional, separate stone circles. The northern inner ring is in diameter, but only two of its four standing stones remain upright. A cove of three stones stood in the middle, its entrance facing northeast. Taking experiments undertaken at the megalithic Ring of Brodgar in Orkney as a basis, the archaeologists Joshua Pollard, Mark Gillings and Aaron Watson believed that any sounds produced inside Avebury&#x27;s Inner Circles would have created an echo as sound waves reflected off the standing stones.

The southern inner ring was in diameter before its destruction in the 18th century. The remaining sections of its arc now lie beneath the village buildings. A single large monolith, high, stood in the centre along with an alignment of smaller stones.

In 2017, a geophysical survey by archaeologists from the Universities of Leicester and Southampton indicated &#x27;an apparently unique square megalithic monument within the Avebury circles&#x27; which may be one of the earliest structures on this site.

=== The Avenue ===

The West Kennet Avenue, an avenue of paired stones, leads from the southeastern entrance of the henge; and traces of a second, the Beckhampton Avenue, lead out from the western entrance.

The archaeologist Aaron Watson, taking a phenomenological viewpoint to the monument, believed that the way in which the Avenue had been constructed in juxtaposition to Avebury, the Sanctuary, Silbury Hill and West Kennet Long Barrow had been intentional, commenting that &quot;the Avenue carefully orchestrated passage through the landscape which influenced how people could move and what they could see, emphasising connections between places and maximising the spectacle of moving between these monuments.&quot;

== Purpose ==

The purpose which Neolithic people had for the Avebury monument has remained elusive, although many archaeologists have postulated about its meaning and usage. Many suggest that the henge could have been a meeting place for the citizens of the area for seasonal fairs or festivals. During that time the people would have been watching ceremonies or standing on the earthen banks. A lack of pottery and animal bone from excavations at Avebury suggest that the entrance to the henge was prohibited. The lack of &quot;mess&quot; and archaeological finds indicates &quot;sanctity&quot;. Many of the stones had former uses before being transported to Avebury. For instance, many of the sarsens had been used to polish stone axes, while others had been &quot;heavily worked&quot;.

Archaeologist Aubrey Burl believed that rituals would have been performed at Avebury by Neolithic peoples in order &quot;to appease the malevolent powers of nature&quot; that threatened their existence, such as the winter cold, death and disease.

In his study of those examples found at Orkney, Colin Richards suggested that the stone and wooden circles built in Neolithic Britain might have represented the centre of the world, or &quot;axis mundi&quot;, for those who constructed them, something Aaron Watson adopted as a possibility in his discussion of Avebury.

A great deal of interest surrounds the morphology of the stones, which are usually described as being in one of two categories; tall and slender, or short and squat. This has led to numerous theories relating to the importance of gender in Neolithic Britain with the taller stones considered &quot;male&quot; and the shorter ones &quot;female&quot;. The stones were not dressed in any way and may have been chosen for their pleasing natural forms.

The human bones found by Gray point to some form of funerary purpose and have parallels in the disarticulated human bones often found at earlier causewayed enclosure sites. Ancestor worship on a huge scale could have been one of the purposes of the monument and would not necessarily have been mutually exclusive with any male/female ritual role.

The henge, although clearly forming an imposing boundary to the circle, could have had a purpose that was not defensive as the ditch is on the inside (this is the defining characteristic of a henge). Being a henge and stone circle site, astronomical alignments are a common theory to explain the positioning of the stones at Avebury. The relationships between the causewayed enclosure, Avebury stone circles, and West Kennet Long Barrow to the south, has caused some to describe the area as a &quot;ritual complex&quot;—a site with many monuments of interlocking religious function. Based on the scale of the site and wealth of archaeological material found in its ditches, particularly animal bone, it is theorised that the enclosure on Windmill Hill was a major, extra-regional focus for gatherings and feasting events.

== Archaeological excavations ==

=== 1800s ===
In 1829, the foot of the Cove stone was dug to a &#x27;yard&#x27; in depth, and in 1833 Henry Browne claimed to find evidence for &#x27;burnt human sacrifices&#x27; also at the Cove in the north-east sector. in 1865, the Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society supported A. C. Smith and W. Cunnington to spend a week directing excavations in fourteen places, including around the Cove; they found no human bones. In 1894 Sir Henry Meux sponsored excavations which put a trench through the bank of the south-east sector, which gave the first indication that the earthwork was built in two phases.
=== 1908–1922 ===
The site was surveyed and excavated intermittently between 1908 and 1922 by a team of workmen under the direction of Harold St George Gray, on behalf of the British Association. The discovery of over 40 antler picks on or near the bottom of the ditch enabled Gray to demonstrate that the Avebury builders had dug down into the natural chalk using red deer antlers as their primary digging tool, producing a henge ditch with a high bank around its perimeter. Gray recorded the base of the ditch as being wide and flat, but later archaeologists have questioned his use of untrained labour to excavate the ditch and suggested that its form may have been different. Gray found few artefacts in the ditch-fill but he did recover scattered human bones, amongst which jawbones were particularly well represented. At a depth of about , Gray found the complete skeleton of a tall woman.

=== 1934–1939 ===

Alexander Keiller financed and led excavations on West Kennet Avenue in 1934 and 1935; the North West sector of Avebury in 1937; the South West sector in 1938, and the South East sector in 1939. It can reasonably be said that &quot;Avebury today is largely Keiller&#x27;s creation&quot;, as Keiller directed his team to find and re-erect fallen or buried stones, and to build concrete &#x27;pylons&#x27; in the place of missing stones. Stuart Piggott co-directed excavations; local archaeologist William E. V. Young served as Foreman; Doris Emerson Chapman illustrated the stones and facial reconstructions for the human remains found across the landscape; and Denis Grant King created illustrations, plans and section drawings. Upwards of 50 men from across Wiltshire served as &#x27;hands&#x27; during the excavations over the 6 year period, doing the hard work of digging and re-erecting stones.

During excavations in 1938, Keiller&#x27;s team excavated the skeleton of a man from beneath Stone 38 (Stone 9 using Isobel Smith&#x27;s system), now known as the Barber surgeon of Avebury. Coins dating from the 1320s were found with the skeleton, and the evidence suggests that the man was fatally injured when the stone fell on him whilst he was digging the hole in which it was to be buried in a mediaeval &quot;rite of destruction&quot;. As well as the coins, Keiller&#x27;s team found a pair of scissors and a lancet, the tools of a barber-surgeon at that time, hence the name given to the stone.

Alexander Keiller and Stuart Piggott published short reports from the excavations, however the outbreak of World War II, Keiller&#x27;s failing health and dwindling finances, and Piggott&#x27;s career which took him abroad during the war and into new archaeological projects post war, meant that they did not publish a full report. The archeologist Isobel Smith was commissioned by Gabrielle Keiller to synthesise and complete the full report. Smith completed the publication in 1965, reorganised the stone numbering system for the landscape, and put Windmill Hill, Avebury and West Kennet Avenue into context.

=== 1969–1982 ===
When a new village school was built in 1969 there was a further opportunity to examine the site, and in 1982 an excavation to produce carbon dating material and environmental data was undertaken.

=== 2003 ===
In April 2003, during preparations to straighten some of the stones, one was found to extend at least below ground. It was estimated to weigh more than 100 tons, making it one of the largest found in the UK. Later that year, a geophysical survey of the southeast and northeast quadrants of the circle by the National Trust revealed at least 15 of the megaliths lying buried. The survey identified their sizes, the direction in which they are lying, and where they fitted in the circle.

== Development after the Neolithic ==

=== Iron Age and Roman periods ===
During the British Iron Age, it appears that the Avebury monument had ceased to be used for its original purpose, and was instead largely ignored, with little archaeological evidence that many people visited the site at this time. Archaeologist Aubrey Burl believed that the Iron Age Britons living in the region would not have known when, why or by whom the monument had been constructed, perhaps having some vague understanding that it had been built by an earlier society or considering it to be the dwelling of a supernatural entity.

In 43 AD, the Roman Empire invaded southern Britain, making alliances with certain local monarchs and subsuming the Britons under their own political control. Southern and central Britain would remain a part of the Empire until the early 5th century, in a period now known as Roman Britain or the Roman Iron Age. It was during this Roman period that tourists came from the nearby towns of Cunetio, Durocornovium and the villas and farms around Devizes and visited Avebury and its surrounding prehistoric monuments via a newly constructed road. Evidence of visitors at the monument during this period has been found in the form of Roman-era pottery sherds uncovered from the ditch.

=== Early Mediaeval period ===
In the Early Middle Ages, which began in the 5th century following the collapse of Roman rule, Anglo-Saxon tribes from continental Europe migrated to southern Britain, where they may have come into conflict with the Britons already settled there. Aubrey Burl suggested the possibility that a small group of British warriors may have used Avebury as a fortified site to defend themselves from Anglo-Saxon attack. He gained this idea from etymological evidence, suggesting that the site may have been called &quot;weala-dic&quot;, meaning &quot;moat of the Britons&quot;, in Old English, the language of the Anglo-Saxons.

The early Anglo-Saxon settlers followed their own pagan religion which venerated a selection of deities, the most notable of whom were apparently Woden and Thunor. It is known from etymological sources that they associated many prehistoric sites in the Wiltshire area with their gods, for instance within a ten-mile of radius of Avebury there are four sites that were apparently named after Woden: Wansdyke (&quot;Wodin&#x27;s ditch&quot;), Wodin&#x27;s Barrow, Waden Hill (&quot;Wodin&#x27;s Hill)&quot; and perhaps Wanborough (also &quot;Woden&#x27;s Hill&quot;). It is not known if they placed any special religious associations with the Avebury monument, but it remains possible.

During the Early Mediaeval period, there were signs of settlement at Avebury, with a &quot;grubenhaus&quot;, a type of timber hut with a sunken floor, being constructed just outside the monument&#x27;s west bank in the 6th century. Only a few farmers appeared to have inhabited the area at the time, and they left the Avebury monument largely untouched. In the 7th and 8th centuries, the Anglo-Saxon peoples began gradually converting to Christianity, and during the 10th century a church was built just west of the monument.

In 939, the earliest known written record of the monument was made in the form of a charter of King Athelstan which defined the boundaries of Overton, a parish adjacent to Avebury. In the following century, invading Viking armies from Denmark came into conflict with Anglo-Saxon groups in the area around Avebury, and it may be that they destroyed Avebury village, for the local prehistoric monument of Silbury Hill was fortified and used as a defensive position, apparently by a local Anglo-Saxon population attempting to protect themselves from Viking aggression.

=== Late Mediaeval period ===

By the Late Middle Ages, England had been entirely converted to Christianity, and Avebury, being an evidently non-Christian monument, began to be associated with the Devil in the popular imagination of the locals. The largest stone at the southern entrance became known as the Devil&#x27;s Chair, the three stones that once formed the Beckhampton Cove became known as the Devil&#x27;s Quoits and the stones inside the North Circle became known as the Devil&#x27;s Brand-Irons. At some point in the early 14th century, villagers began to demolish the monument by pulling down the large standing stones and burying them in ready-dug pits at the side, presumably because they were seen as having been erected by the Devil and thereby being in opposition to the village&#x27;s Christian beliefs. Although it is unknown how this situation came about, archaeologist Aubrey Burl suggests that it might have been at the prompting of the local Christian priest, with the likely contenders being either Thomas Mayn (who served in the village from 1298 to 1319), or John de Hoby (who served from 1319 to 1324).

Archaeologists found a man&#x27;s body under one of the toppled stones in 1938. He had been carrying a leather pouch, in which were three silver coins dated to around 1320–25, as well as a pair of iron scissors and a lancet. From these latter two items, the archaeologists surmised that he had probably been a travelling barber-surgeon who journeyed between market towns offering his services. It appears that the death of the barber-surgeon prevented the locals from pulling down further stones, perhaps fearing that it had in some way been retribution for toppling them in the first place, enacted by a vengeful spirit or even the Devil himself. The event appears to have left a significant influence on the minds of the local villagers, for records show that in the 18th and 19th centuries there were still legends being told in the community about a man being crushed by a falling stone.

Soon after the toppling of many of the stones, the Black Death hit the village in 1349, almost halving the population. Those who survived focused on their agricultural duties to grow food and stay alive. As a result, they would not have had the time or manpower to once more attempt to demolish any part of the non-Christian monument, even if they had wanted to.

=== Early Modern period ===

It was in the Early modern period that Avebury was first recognised as an antiquity that warranted investigation. Around 1541, John Leland, the librarian and chaplain to King Henry VIII travelled through Wiltshire and made note of the existence of Avebury and its neighbouring prehistoric monuments. Despite this, Avebury remained relatively unknown to anyone but locals and when the antiquarian William Camden published his Latin language guide to British antiquities, &quot;Britannia&quot;, in 1586, he made no mention of it. He rectified this for his English language version in 1610, but even in this he only included a fleeting reference to the monument at &quot;Abury&quot;, believing it to have been &quot;an old camp&quot;. In 1634, it was once more referenced, this time in Sir John Harington&#x27;s notes to the &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot; opera; however, further antiquarian investigation was prevented by the outbreak of the English Civil War (1642–51), which was waged between the Parliamentarians and Royalists, with one of the battles in the conflict taking place five miles away from Avebury at Roundway Down.

With the war over, a new edition of the &quot;Britannia&quot; was published in 1695, which described the monument at &quot;Aubury&quot; in more detail. This entry had been written by the antiquarian and writer John Aubrey, who privately made many notes about Avebury and other prehistoric monuments which remained unpublished. Aubrey had first encountered the site whilst out hunting in 1649 and, in his own words, had been &quot;wonderfully surprised at the sight of those vast stones of which I had never heard before.&quot; Hearing of Avebury and taking an interest in it, King Charles II commanded Aubrey to come to him and describe the site, which he did in July 1663. The two subsequently travelled to visit it together on the monarch&#x27;s trip to Bath, Somerset, a fortnight later, and the site further captivated the king&#x27;s interest, who commanded Aubrey to dig underneath the stones in search of any human burials. Aubrey, however, never undertook the king&#x27;s order. In September 1663, Aubrey began making a more systematic study of the site, producing a plan that has proved invaluable for later archaeologists, for it contained reference to many standing stones that would soon after be destroyed by locals.

In the latter part of the 17th and then the 18th centuries, destruction at Avebury reached its peak, possibly influenced by the rise of Puritanism in the village, a fundamentalist form of Protestant Christianity that vehemently denounced things considered to be &quot;pagan&quot;, which would have included pre-Christian monuments like Avebury. The majority of the standing stones that had been a part of the monument for thousands of years were smashed up to be used as building material for the local area. This was achieved by lighting a fire to heat the sarsen, then pouring cold water on it to create weaknesses in the rock, and finally smashing at the fire-cracked rock with a sledgehammer.

In 1719, the antiquarian William Stukeley visited the site, where he witnessed the destruction being undertaken by the local people. Between then and 1724 he visited the village and its monument six times, sometimes staying for two or three weeks at the Catherine Wheel Inn. In this time, he made meticulous plans of the site, considering it to be a &quot;British Temple&quot;, and believing it to having been fashioned by the druids, the Iron Age priests of north-western Europe, in the year 1859 BC. He developed the idea that the two Inner Circles were a temple to the moon and to the sun, respectively, and eventually came to believe that Avebury and its surrounding monuments were a landscaped portrayal of the Trinity, thereby backing up his erroneous ideas that the ancient druids had been followers of a religion very much like Christianity.

Stukeley was disgusted by the destruction of the sarsen stones in the monument, and named those local farmers and builders who were responsible. He remarked that &quot;this stupendous fabric, which for some thousands of years, had brav&#x27;d the continual assaults of weather, and by the nature of it, when left to itself, like the pyramids of Egypt, would have lasted as long as the globe, hath fallen a sacrifice to the wretched ignorance and avarice of a little village unluckily plac&#x27;d within it.&quot;

Stukeley published his findings and theories in a book, &quot;Abury, a Temple of the British Druids&quot; (1743), in which he intentionally falsified some of the measurements he had made of the site to better fit his theories about its design and purpose. Meanwhile, the Reverend Thomas Twining had also published a book about the monument, &quot;Avebury in Wiltshire, the Remains of a Roman Work&quot;, which had been published in 1723. Whereas Stukeley claimed that Avebury and related prehistoric monuments were the creations of the druids, Twining thought that they had been constructed by the later Romans, justifying his conclusion on the fact that Roman writers like Julius Caesar and Tacitus had not referred to stone circles when discussing the Iron Age Britons, whereas Late Mediaeval historians like Geoffrey of Monmouth and Henry of Huntingdon had described these megaliths in their works, and that such monuments must have therefore been constructed between the two sets of accounts.

=== Victorian period and early 20th century ===

By the beginning of the Victorian era in 1837, the majority of Neolithic standing stones at Avebury had gone, having been either buried by pious locals in the 14th century or broken up for building materials in the 17th and 18th. Meanwhile, the population of Avebury village was rapidly increasing, leading to further housing being built inside the henge. In the 1870s, to prevent further construction on the site, the wealthy politician and archaeologist Sir John Lubbock (later created Baron Avebury) purchased much of the available land in the monument, and encouraged other buyers to build their houses outside rather than within the henge.

Archaeologist Alexander Keiller developed an interest in Avebury and West Kennet Avenue while conducting excavations at nearby Windmill Hill. Keiller decided that the best way to preserve Avebury was to purchase it in its entirety. Keiller was heir to the James Keiller and Son marmalade business and was able to use his wealth to acquire much of the site between 1924 and 1939. He also acquired Windmill Hill, as much of the Kennet Avenue as possible, and the nearby Avebury Manor, where he was to live until his death in 1955.

=== Post World War II ===
Keiller sold some of his property to the National Trust in 1943, and they went on to acquire further farmland in the area. The National Trust had a policy to demolish houses within the circle as they fell vacant, but by 1976, those remaining were allowed to stand.

The Stonehenge and Avebury landscape became a designated UNESCO World Heritage site in 1986.

The question of access to the site at certain times of the year has been controversial and the National Trust, who steward and protect the site, have held discussions with a number of groups. The National Trust have discouraged commercialism around the site, preventing many souvenir shops from opening up in an attempt to keep the area free from the &quot;customary gaudiness that infiltrates most famous places&quot; in the United Kingdom. Two shops have been opened in the village catering to the tourist market, one of which is the National Trust&#x27;s own shop. The other, known as The Henge Shop, focuses on selling New Age paraphernalia and books.

By the late 1970s the site was being visited by around a quarter of a million visitors annually.

On 1 April 2014, as part of an April Fools&#x27; Day prank, the National Trust claimed through social media and a press release that their rangers were moving one of the stones in order to realign the circle with British Summer Time. The story was picked up by local media and &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s &quot;Best of the Web&quot;.

== Contemporary Paganism and the New Age movement ==

Avebury has been adopted as a sacred site by many adherents of contemporary Pagan religions such as Druidry, Wicca and Heathenry. These worshippers view the monument as a &quot;living temple&quot; which they associate with the ancestors, as well as with genii loci, or spirits of place. Typically, such Pagan rites at the site are performed publicly, and attract crowds of curious visitors to witness the event, particularly on major days of Pagan celebration such as the summer solstice.

Druidic rites held at Avebury are commonly known as &quot;gorseddau&quot; and involve participants invoking &quot;Awen&quot; (a Druidic concept meaning inspiration), with an eisteddfod section during which poems, songs and stories are publicly performed. The Druid Prayer composed by Iolo Morganwg in the 18th century and the later Druid Vow are typically recited. One particular group, known as the Gorsedd of Bards of Caer Abiri, focus almost entirely upon holding their rites at the prehistoric site, referring to it as Caer Abiri. In their original ceremony, composed by Philip Shallcrass of the British Druid Order in 1993, those assembled divide into two groups, one referred to as the God party and the other as the Goddess party. Those with the Goddess party go to the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Chair&quot; at the southern entrance to the Avebury henge, where a woman representing the spirit guardian of the site and the Goddess who speaks through her sits in the chair-like cove in the southern face of the sarsen stone. Meanwhile, those following the God party process around the outer bank of the henge to the southern entrance, where they are challenged as to their intent and give offerings (often of flowers, fruit, bread or mead) to the Goddess&#x27;s representative.

Due to the fact that various Pagan, and in particular Druid groups, perform their ceremonies at the site, a rota has been established, whereby the Loyal Arthurian Warband (LAW), the Secular Order of Druids (SOD) and the Glastonbury Order of Druids (GOD) use it on Saturdays, whilst the Druid Network and the British Druid Order (BDO) instead plan their events for Sundays.

Alongside its usage as a sacred site amongst Pagans, the prehistoric monument has become a popular attraction for those holding New Age beliefs, with some visitors using dowsing rods around the site in the belief that they might be able to detect psychic emanations.

== Alexander Keiller Museum ==

The Alexander Keiller Museum features prehistoric and later artefacts collected from across the Avebury landscape. As well as financing excavations at Avebury, Alexander Keiller demolished some newer structures and built the museum now bearing his name. The museum is housed in the 17th-century stables, and is operated by English Heritage and the National Trust. The nearby 17th-century threshing barn houses a permanent exhibit gallery about Avebury and its history.

The museum was first built to house Keiller&#x27;s collection of artefacts from Windmill Hill and Avebury, with artefacts brought to the site from his Charles Street, London, address in 1938. The collections feature artefacts mostly of Neolithic and Early Bronze Age date, with other items from the Anglo-Saxon and later periods. The museum also features the skeleton of a child nicknamed &quot;Charlie&quot;, found in a ditch at Windmill Hill, Avebury. The Council of British Druid Orders requested that the skeleton be re-buried in 2006, but in April 2010 the decision was made to keep it on public view. From the mid 1960s to her death in 1978, Faith Vatcher was the curator of the museum. She was heavily involved in the excavations on the western side of the henge in 1969 and in what is now the modern day visitor car park, in 1976. The museum collections are owned by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and are on loan to English Heritage.

== Controversial theories ==
Various non-archaeologists as well as pseudoarchaeologists have interpreted Avebury and its neighbouring prehistoric monuments differently from academics. These interpretations have been defined by professional archaeologist Aubrey Burl as being &quot;more phony than factual&quot;, and in many cases &quot;entirely untenable&quot;. Such inaccurate ideas originated with William Stukeley in the late 17th century, who believed that Avebury had been built by the druids, priests of the Iron Age peoples of north-western Europe, who were persecuted by Roman invaders. Political events such as the Acts of Union 1707 and the Hanoverian succession of 1714 motivated British nationalism and Stukeley&#x27;s antiquarian ideals. In the 1720s scholarly opinion was largely based on the idea that the stones were Roman works. Most believed that ancient Britons were &quot;too unsophisticated&quot; to construct an intricate architectural structure. Archaeologists since then have identified the monument as having been constructed two thousand years before the Iron Age, during the Neolithic.

Inigo Jones was the first to suggest that the stones were built by Romans in his book &quot;The Most Notable Antiquity of Great Britain, Vulgarly called Stone-Heng on Salisbury Plain&quot; (1665). The book consisted of architectonic designs, depicting the broken &quot;Roman&quot; construction. The English diarist Thomas Hearne was unsure if the stones had been built by the Romans or the ancient Britons, but Stukeley was confident that the Avebury and associated sites were much older than the Roman period.

Stukeley determined that by gathering a mass of information about all known stone circles and other archaeological sites, one could build a typology and provide an accurate understanding of prehistoric sites. He formed a typology of &quot;Celtic&quot; stone temples, attempting to associate the monuments with the druids. In his book, &quot;History of the Temples of the Ancient Celts&quot;, he asserted the common characteristics between all stone structures in Britain. In doing so, he wished to advance the Avebury and Stonehenge were developed by ancient inhabitants of Britain.

Stukeley most likely shared his theories with his friends within the Antiquarian Society or the Roman Knights. He was motivated in proving that the Druids had formed the stones because he could prove that ancient Britons were well-informed about science, disproving sceptics like Hearne. Stukeley was interested in proving an association with his antiquarian work and the Avebury stones to provide additional information on the holy doctrine of the Trinity. He believed that the snake illustrated on the stones represented the Messiah and the circle meant &quot;divine,&quot; a symbol for God. In the remaining part of the trinity, wings, which were not depicted on the stones, represent the holy spirit. He concluded that the absence of wings on the pattern of stones at Avebury was because of the challenge of depicting them on stones. Terence Meaden held the theory that Neolithic inhabitants carved faces in the stones.

Following Stukeley, other writers produced inaccurate theories about how Avebury was built and by whom. The Reverend R. Weaver, in his &quot;The Pagan Altar&quot; (1840) argued that both Avebury and Stonehenge were built by Phoenicians, an ancient seafaring people whom many Victorian Britons believed had first brought civilisation to the island. James Fergusson disagreed, and in his &quot;Rude Stone Monuments in All Countries&quot; (1872) put forward the idea that the megalithic monument had been constructed in the Early Mediaeval period to commemorate the final battle of King Arthur, and that Arthur&#x27;s slain warriors had been buried there. W. S. Blacket introduced a third idea, arguing in his &quot;Researches into the Lost Histories of America&quot; (1883) that it was Native Americans from the Appalachian Mountains who, in the ancient period crossed the Atlantic Ocean to build the great megalithic monuments of southern Britain.

The prominent modern Druid Ross Nichols, the founder of the Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids, believed that there was an astrological axis connecting Avebury to the later megalithic site at Stonehenge, and that this axis was flanked on one side by West Kennet Long Barrow, which he believed symbolised the Mother Goddess, and Silbury Hill, which he believed to be a symbol of masculinity.

Alexander Thom suggested that Avebury was constructed with a site-to-site alignment with Deneb. Researcher and author Paul Devereux deemed the monuments in the Avebury landscape to be associated with one another by &quot;engineered sightlines&quot; towards Silbury Hill. He believed that the terracing towards the top of the mound indicated a connection between the complex constructions in the area. Environmental evidence from buried soil under Silbury Hill showed no evidence of soil disturbance. This could signify that if the sightline Devereux suggested was used, it was very late in the landscape at Avebury.

Avebury&#x27;s association with crop circles invokes the theory of ley lines. Ley lines are commonly seen as tracks on the land, intersecting at various monuments and landmarks, supposedly connecting &quot;earth energies&quot;. They are recalled to be ancient paths that connected sacred spaces. Those who study crop circles claim that the circles are formed by extraterrestrial creatures trying to warn the world about events such as climate change or people trying to communicate from an alternate universe. Others believe in natural methods of explaining the phenomena, such as vortexes or ball lightning. There are a great number of crop circles in Wiltshire, including Stonehenge and Avebury. Crop circle season often begins at the end of May and ends by September, when the harvesting of the crops cuts away the circular patterns.

<doc id="351615" wikidata="Q240313" url="?curid=351615" title="Artillery battery">
<text>In military organizations, an artillery battery is a unit or multiple systems of artillery, mortar systems, rocket artillery, multiple rocket launchers, surface-to-surface missiles, ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, etc., so grouped to facilitate better battlefield communication and command and control, as well as to provide dispersion for its constituent gunnery crews and their systems. The term is also used in a naval context to describe groups of guns on warships.
==Land usage==

Historically the term &quot;battery&quot; referred to a cluster of cannon in action as a group, either in a temporary field position during a battle or at the siege of a fortress or a city. Such batteries could be a mixture of cannon, howitzer, or mortar types. A siege could involve many batteries at different sites around the besieged place. The term also came to be used for a group of cannons in a fixed fortification, for coastal or frontier defence. During the 18th century &quot;battery&quot; began to be used as an organizational term for a permanent unit of artillery in peace and war, although horse artillery sometimes used &quot;troop&quot; and fixed position artillery &quot;company&quot;. They were usually organised with between 6 and 12 ordnance pieces, often including cannon and howitzers. By the late 19th century &quot;battery&quot; had become standard mostly replacing company or troop.

In the 20th century the term was generally used for the company level sub-unit of an artillery branch including field, air-defence, anti-tank and position (coastal and frontier defences). 20th-century firing batteries have been equipped with mortars, guns, howitzers, rockets and missiles.

===Mobile batteries===

During the Napoleonic Wars some armies started grouping their batteries into larger administrative and field units. Groups of batteries combined for field combat employment called Grand Batteries by Napoleon.

Administratively batteries were usually grouped in battalions, regiments or squadrons and these developed into tactical organisations. These were further grouped into regiments, simply &quot;group&quot; or brigades, that may be wholly composed of artillery units or combined arms in composition. To further concentrate fire of individual batteries, from World War I they were grouped into &quot;artillery divisions&quot; in a few armies. Coastal artillery sometimes had completely different organizational terms based on shore defence sector areas.

Batteries also have sub-divisions, which vary across armies and periods but often translate into the English &quot;platoon&quot; or &quot;troop&quot; with individual ordnance systems called a &quot;section&quot; or &quot;sub-section&quot;, where a section comprises two artillery pieces.

The rank of a battery commander has also varied, but is usually a lieutenant, captain, or major.

The number of guns, howitzers, mortars or launchers in an organizational battery has also varied, with the calibre of guns usually being an important consideration. In the 19th century four to 12 guns was usual as the optimum number to maneuver into the gun line. By the late 19th century, a mountain artillery battery was divided into a and an ammunition line. The gun line consisted of six guns (five mules to a gun) and 12 ammunition mules.

During the American Civil War, artillery batteries often consisted of six field pieces for the Union Army and four for the Confederate States Army, although this varied. Batteries were divided into sections of two guns apiece, each section normally under the command of a lieutenant. The full battery was typically commanded by a captain. Often, particularly as the war progressed, individual batteries were grouped into battalions under a major or colonel of artillery.

In the 20th century it varied between four and 12 for field artillery (even 16 if mortars), or even two pieces for very heavy pieces. Other types of artillery such as anti-tank or anti-aircraft have sometimes been larger. Some batteries have been &quot;dual-equipped&quot; with two different types of gun or mortar, and taking whichever was more appropriate when they deployed for operations.

From the late 19th century field artillery batteries started to become more complex organisations. First they needed the capability to carry adequate ammunition, typically each gun could only carry about 40 rounds in its limber so additional wagons were added to the battery, typically about two per gun. The introduction of indirect fire in the early 20th century necessitated two other groups, firstly observers who deployed some distance forward of the gun line, secondly a small staff on the gun position to undertake the calculations to convert the orders from the observers into data that could be set on the gun sights. This in turn led to the need for signalers, which further increased as the need to concentrate the fire of dispersed batteries emerged and the introduction fire control staff at artillery headquarters above the batteries.

===Fixed battery===

Fixed artillery refers to guns or howitzers on mounts that were either anchored in one spot (though capable of being moved for purposes of traverse and elevation), or on carriages intended to be moved only for the purposes of aiming, and not for tactical repositioning. Historical versions often closely resembled naval cannon of their day, &quot;garrison carriages,&quot; like naval carriages, were short, heavy, and had four small wheels meant for rolling on relatively smooth, hard surfaces. Later, both naval and garrison carriages evolved traversing platforms and pivoting mounts. Such mounts were typically used in forts, or permanent defensive batteries, such as coastal artillery. Fixed batteries could be equipped with much larger guns than field artillery units could transport, and the gun emplacement was only one part of an extensive installation that included magazines and systems to deliver ammunition from the magazines to the guns. Improvements in mobile artillery, naval and ground; air attack; and precision guided weapons have limited fixed position&#x27;s usefulness.

===NATO===
Within NATO member nations, it is typical to label company sized organizations of artillery as &quot;batteries.&quot; NATO defines a company as &quot;larger than a platoon, but smaller than a battalion&quot; while being a &quot;unit consisting of two or more platoons, usually of the same type, with a headquarters and a limited capacity for self-support.&quot; The standard NATO symbol for a company consists of a single vertical line placed above a framed unit icon.

==Naval usage==
&quot;Battery&quot; is a relatively modern term at sea. Advanced warships in the Age of Sail, such as the ship of the line, mounted dozens of similar cannons grouped in broadsides, sometimes spread over several decks. This remained the standard main weapon layout for centuries, until the mid-19th century evolution of the naval rifle and revolving gun turrets came to displace fixed cannon.

The first operational use of a rotating turret was on the American ironclad , designed during the American Civil War by John Ericsson. Open barbettes were also used to house their main batteries on rotating mounts. Both designs allowed naval engineers to dramatically reduce the number of guns present in the battery, by giving a handful of guns the ability to concentrate on either side of the ship. In time this trend reversed, with a proliferation of weapons of multiple calibers being arranged somewhat haphazardly about a vessel, many in mounts on the hull or superstructure with limited travel. Confusion also arose when combinations of large caliber &quot;main battery&quot; and smaller &quot;secondary battery&quot; weapons of mixed offensive and defensive use were deployed.
This began to be resolved with the 1906 launching of the revolutionary &quot;all big gun&quot; battleship . It shipped a main battery of ten heavy caliber guns, and a smaller secondary battery for self-defense. This leap in heavy offensive armament from a standard four large caliber guns to a main battery of ten made all other battleships obsolete overnight, as the weight of broadside it could unleash, and overwhelming rate of fire a superior number of similar weapons could sustain, could overwhelm any similarly sized warship. 

A third, or tertiary battery, of weapons lighter than the secondary battery was typically mounted. To simplify the design many later ships used dual-purpose guns to combine the functions of the secondary battery and the heavier guns of the tertiary batteries. Many dual-purpose guns also served in an anti-aircraft role. In addition, dedicated light-caliber rapid-fire anti-aircraft weapons were deployed, often in the scores. An example of this combination was the , which carried a main battery of eight guns, a secondary battery of twelve guns for defense against destroyers and torpedo boats, as well as a tertiary battery of various anti-aircraft guns ranging in caliber from .

Conventional artillery as a vessel&#x27;s battery has been largely displaced by guided missiles for both offensive and defensive actions. Small caliber guns are retained for niche roles, such as the multi-barrel Phalanx CIWS rotary cannon used for point defense. The rapid fire 5&quot;/54 caliber Mark 45 gun and Otobreda 76 mm (3.0 in) used for close defense against surface combatants and shore bombardment are among the last traditional naval guns still in use.

==Modern battery organization==

In modern battery organization, the military unit typically has six to eight howitzers or six to nine rocket launchers and 100 to 200 personnel and is the equivalent of a company in terms of organisation level.

In the United States Army, generally a towed howitzer battery has six guns, whereas a self-propelled battery (such as an M109 battery) contains eight. They are subdivided into:

* Light batteries, equipped with 105 mm howitzers or equivalent;
* Medium batteries, equipped with 155 mm howitzers or equivalent;
* Heavy batteries, which are equipped with guns of 203 mm or larger calibre, but are now very rare; and
* Various more specialized types, such as anti-aircraft, missile, or Multiple Launch Rocket System batteries.
* Headquarters batteries, which themselves have no artillery pieces, but are rather the command and control organization for a group of firing batteries (for example, a regimental or battalion headquarters battery).

The battery is typically commanded by a captain in US forces and is equivalent to an infantry company. A US Army battery is divided into the following units:

* The firing section, which includes the individual gun sections. Each gun section is typically led by a staff sergeant (US Army Enlisted pay grade E-6); the firing section as a whole is usually led by a lieutenant and a senior NCO.
* The fire direction center (FDC), which computes firing solutions based on map coordinates, receives fire requests and feedback from observers and infantry units, and communicates directions to the firing section. It also receives commands from higher headquarters (i.e. the battalion FDC sends commands to the FDCs of all three of its batteries for the purpose of synchronizing a barrage).

Other armies can be significantly different, however. For example:

The United Kingdom and Commonwealth forces have classified batteries according to the caliber of the guns. Typically:

* Light batteries, equipped with 105 mm howitzers or smaller
* Medium batteries, equipped with larger calibres, up to 155 mm howitzers or equivalent
* Heavy batteries, with larger calibres
* Various more specialised types, such as anti-aircraft, missile, or Multiple Launch Rocket System batteries

Headquarters batteries, which themselves have no artillery pieces, but are rather the command and control organization for a group of firing batteries (for example, a regimental or battalion headquarters battery).

The basic field organization being the &quot;gun group&quot; and the &quot;tactical group&quot;. The former being reconnaissance and survey, guns, command posts, logistic and equipment support elements, the latter being the battery commander and observation teams that deploy with the supported arm. In these armies the guns may be split into several fire units, which may deploy dispersed over an extended area or be concentrated into a single position. In some cases batteries have operationally deployed as six totally separate guns, although sections (pairs) are more usual.

A battery commander, or &quot;BC&quot; is a Major (like his infantry company commander counterpart). However, in these armies the battery commander leads the &quot;tactical group&quot; and is usually located with the headquarters of the infantry or armoured unit the battery is supporting. Increasingly these direct support battery commanders are responsible for the orchestration of all forms of fire support (mortars, attack helicopters, other aircraft and naval gunfire) as well as artillery. General support battery commanders are likely to be at brigade or higher headquarters.

The gun group is commanded by the Battery Captain (BK), the battery&#x27;s second-in-command. However this position has no technical responsibilities, its primary concern is administration, including ammunition supply, local defence and is based in the &quot;wagon-lines&quot; a short distance from the actual gun position, where the gun towing and logistic vehicles are concealed. Technical control is by the Gun Position Officer (GPO, a lieutenant) who is also the reconnaissance officer. The battery has two Command Posts (CP), one active and one alternate, the latter provides back-up in the event of casualties, but primarily moves with the preparation party to the next gun position and becomes the main CP there. Each CP is controlled by a Command Post Officer (CPO) who is usually a Lieutenant, 2nd Lieutenant or Warrant Officer Class 2. Gun positions may be &quot;tight&quot;, perhaps when the counter battery threat is low, or gun manoeuver areas, where pairs of self-propelled guns move around a far larger area, if the counter-battery threat is high.

During the Cold War NATO batteries that were dedicated to a nuclear role generally operated as &quot;sections&quot; comprising a single gun or launcher.

Groupings of mortars, when they are not operated by artillery, are usually referred to as platoons.

<doc id="351616" wikidata="Q945611" url="?curid=351616" title="Chyme">
<text>Chyme or chymus (; from Greek χυμός &quot;khymos&quot;, &quot;juice&quot;) is the semi-fluid mass of partly digested food that is expelled by the stomach, through the pyloric valve, into the duodenum (the beginning of the small intestine).

Chyme results from the mechanical and chemical breakdown of a bolus and consists of partially digested food, water, hydrochloric acid, and various digestive enzymes. Chyme slowly passes through the pyloric sphincter and into the duodenum, where the extraction of nutrients begins. Depending on the quantity and contents of the meal, the stomach will digest the food into chyme in some time from 40 minutes to 3 hours. 
With a pH of approximately 2, chyme emerging from the stomach is very acidic. The duodenum secretes a hormone, cholecystokinin (CCK), which causes the gall bladder to contract, releasing alkaline bile into the duodenum. CCK also causes the release of digestive enzymes from the pancreas. The duodenum is a short section of the small intestine located between the stomach and the rest of the small intestine. The duodenum also produces the hormone secretin to stimulate the pancreatic secretion of large amounts of sodium bicarbonate, which then raises pH of the chyme to 7. The chyme moves through the jejunum and the ileum, where digestion progresses, and the non-useful portion continues onward into the large intestine. The duodenum is protected by a thick layer of mucus and the neutralizing actions of the sodium bicarbonate and bile.

At a pH of 7, the enzymes that were present from the stomach are no longer active. The breakdown of any nutrients still present is by anaerobic bacteria, which at the same time help to package the remains. These bacteria also help synthesize vitamin B and vitamin K, which will be absorbed along with other nutrients.

==Properties==
Chyme has a low pH that is countered by the production of bile, which helps the further digestion of food. Chyme is part liquid and part solid: a thick semifluid mass of partially digested food and digestive secretions that is formed in the stomach and small intestine during digestion. Chyme also contains cells from the mouth and esophagus that slough off from the mechanical action of chewing and swallowing.

==Path of chyme==
After hours of mechanical and chemical digestion, food has been reduced into chyme. As particles of food become small enough, they are passed out of the stomach at regular intervals into the small intestine, which stimulates the pancreas to release fluid containing a high concentration of bicarbonate. This fluid neutralizes the gastric juices, which can damage the lining of the intestine and result in duodenal ulcer. Other secretions from the pancreas, gallbladder, liver, and glands in the intestinal wall help in digestion, as these secretions contain a variety of digestive enzymes and chemicals that assist in the breakdown of complex compounds into those that can be absorbed and used by the body.

When food particles are sufficiently reduced in size and composition, they are absorbed by the intestinal wall and transported to the bloodstream. Some food material is passed from the small intestine to the large intestine. In the large intestine, bacteria break down any proteins and starches in chyme that were not digested fully in the small intestine.

When all of the nutrients have been absorbed from chyme, the remaining waste material changes into semisolids that are called feces. The feces pass to the rectum, to be stored until ready to be discharged from the body during defecation.

==Uses==

The chyme of an unweaned calf is the defining ingredient of pajata, a traditional Roman recipe.

Chyme is sometimes used in Pinapaitan, a bitter Ilocano stew.

<text>Creation Records Ltd. was a British independent record label founded in 1983 by Alan McGee, Dick Green, and Joe Foster. Its name came from the 1960s band The Creation, whom McGee greatly admired. The label ceased operations in 1999, although it was revived at one point in 2011 for the release of the compilation album &quot;Upside Down&quot;.

Over the course of its sixteen-year history, Creation predominantly focused on alternative rock, releasing several influential indie rock, shoegaze, and Britpop records, but also featured bands performing various other styles of rock, including indie pop and post-punk, as well as some electronic, folk, and experimental artists.

== Early years ==
McGee formed Creation Records following the culmination of various projects, including fanzine Communication Blur, his own rock outfit The Laughing Apple (with future Primal Scream guitarist and long-time friend Andrew Innes), and his running of the venue The Communication Club. Initially, McGee wished to provide an outlet for like minded musicians and an opportunity for young bands to see their work on vinyl. Primarily the label was in opposition to the &quot;manufactured&quot; synth pop of the era, that bore little resemblance to the work of his favourite acts including Public Image Ltd and the Sex Pistols.

McGee started the label by putting out the &quot;&#x27;73 in &#x27;83&quot; single by The Legend!, after taking out a £1,000 bank loan. Around the same time, he started a club called The Living Room in Tottenham Court Road, through which he met several people who would go on to record for Creation, including Peter Astor and Lawrence. Distributor Rough Trade soon began funding releases.

Creation was among the key labels in the mid-1980s indie movement, with early artists such as The Jesus and Mary Chain, The Membranes and Primal Scream. The Jesus and Mary Chain went to record for Warner Brothers in 1985, yet McGee remained as their manager. With the profits he had made from the band, he was able to release singles by label acts such as Primal Scream, Felt, and The Weather Prophets.

McGee had enthusiasm and an uncanny ability to attract the weekly music media, and he was able to get a growing underground following. In their early days, he was able to project a notorious image of The Jesus and Mary Chain, which had often courted violence and loutish behaviour.

The early years of Creation feature prominently in 2017 documentary, &quot;Teenage Superstars&quot;.

== Mid-period ==
Following an unsuccessful attempt to run an offshoot label for Warner Brothers (Elevation Records), McGee regrouped Creation and immersed himself in the burgeoning dance and acid house scene starting in the late 1980s. Those scenes had influenced Creation mainstays such as Primal Scream and Ed Ball, as well as newer arrivals such as My Bloody Valentine.

Creation Records&#x27; releases at this time tended to be critically acclaimed, without being major commercial hits. Creation had run up considerable debt that was only held off until McGee sold half the company to Sony Music in 1992. There were reports of McGee&#x27;s escalating drug use, as well as numerous and conflicting reports of the label being nearly bankrupted after funding the two-year-long recording of My Bloody Valentine&#x27;s 1991 &quot;Loveless&quot;.

== Sony years ==
After selling to Sony, Creation signed Oasis, whose debut album &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot; became a huge critical and commercial success. The band went on to epitomise the cultural Britpop movement of the mid-1990s. The success of Oasis was unprecedented for an act on an independent label. Their second album, &quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot; became the biggest selling British album of the decade.

In the 1990s, Creation launched the subsidiary Rev-Ola Records, which was formed by Joe Foster. Rev-Ola is now a part of the PoppyDisc group of labels.

The revitalised Labour Party took note of McGee&#x27;s accomplishments with Creation. They got McGee to spearhead a media campaign prior to the 1997 general election in order to appeal to Britain&#x27;s youth culture. He was largely responsible for changing government legislation in relation to musicians being able to go on the New Deal which gave musicians three years to develop and be funded by the government instead of having to take other jobs to survive.

&quot;Omnibus&quot; went on to make a documentary on McGee and Creation in 1998 for BBC One. Creation Records was awarded &#x27;Independent Label of the Year&#x27; every year between 1995 and 1998 by &quot;Music Week&quot;, and McGee was awarded the &quot;NME&quot; &#x27;Godlike Genius&#x27; award in February 1995.

In the United States and Canada, some of Creation&#x27;s catalogue was licensed to various non-Sony record labels such as A&amp;M Records (Swervedriver), DGC Records (Teenage Fanclub [outside Europe]), Reprise Records (Oasis), SBK Records (Adorable, Slowdive), and Sire Records (My Bloody Valentine, Primal Scream, Ride [outside the United Kingdom]).

== Dissolution ==
According to the documentary &quot;Upside Down&quot;, McGee and Foster opted to close Creation in December 1999 after McGee began to suffer burnout and disillusionment with the label. The label&#x27;s final release was &quot;XTRMNTR&quot; by Primal Scream, issued in January 2000, shortly after the label ceased functioning.

The dissolution of Creation Records in 1999 led to McGee and Foster forming Poptones. The label saw a return to the staunchly independent roots of Creation, and had most notably launched the career of The Hives in the UK.

In May 2007, McGee told &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper that he was winding down Poptones for financial reasons.

&quot;Upside Down,&quot; a film on Creation Records premiered at the BFI in London on 23 and 24 October 2010. It was released on DVD in the UK on 9 May 2011. Additionally, a soundtrack album compiled by Joe Foster featuring 34 tracks which covered the entire career of Creation Records was released. This album was released on Creation Records, which was revived for the release of the album only.

In numerous interviews in 2012, McGee said he was &quot;seriously considering&quot; resurrecting Creation Records but took up an offer from Cherry Red Records to launch 359 Music instead.

After the partnership with Cherry Red came to an end, McGee launched label specialising in releasing 7 inch vinyl records. This label was called Creation23 and was seen as the new incarnation of Creation Records. Acts who had singles released by the label included The K&#x27;s, Shambolics, Rubber Jaw, Young Garbo and Juggs.

==&quot;It&#x27;s Creation Baby&quot;==
On 1 February 2021, McGee relaunched Creation23 as the &quot;It&#x27;s Creation Baby&quot; record label and became the sole owner of the company. The label would now sign acts and put out albums as well as 7 inch singles, with Astrid&#x27;s Charlie Clark releasing a solo album called &quot;Late Night Drinking&quot; as the label&#x27;s first album release. By December 2021, McGee had overseen releases by acts such as Marquis Drive, Shambolics and The Illicits (bands who had been previously part of Creation23) as well as singles by Caterina Speranza&#x27;s band CAT SFX and Cast member John Power, who released a solo single called &quot;Grounded Truth&quot; via the label. McGee also launched an indie music festival using the Creation name, set up by McGee to showcase his acts on a bill which also includes named headliners from the indie music scene. The festival, now called the Utilita Creation Day Festival, was due to be held in Wolverhampton in 2021 but was postponed until 2022.

<text>The goitered gazelle (Gazella subgutturosa) or black-tailed gazelle is a gazelle native to Turkey, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Iran, parts of Iraq and Pakistan, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and in northwestern China and Mongolia. The specific name, meaning &quot;full below the throat&quot;, refers to the male having an enlargement of the neck and throat during the mating season.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The goitered gazelle inhabits sands and gravel plains and limestone plateau.
Large herds were also present in the Near East. Some 6,000 years ago, they were captured and killed with the help of desert kites. Rock art found in Jordan suggests that it was slaughtered ritually.

== Behaviour and ecology ==
Its mating behaviour is polygynous and usually occurs in the early winter.
It runs at high speed, without the leaping, bounding gait seen in other gazelle species. Throughout much of its range, the goitered gazelle migrates seasonally. Herds cover per day in the winter, with these distances being reduced to about in summer.

== Taxonomy==
Several subspecies have been described, and four forms are distinguished, which used to be treated as separate monotypic species. &quot;Gazella marica&quot; was traditionally recognised as a subspecies, but has been identified as a species in 2011.

*Persian gazelle (&quot;Gazella (subgutturosa) subgutturosa&quot;) - southeastern Turkey, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Syria, northern and eastern Iraq, Iran, southern Afghanistan, western Pakistan
*Turkmen gazelle (&quot;Gazella (subgutturosa) gracilicornis&quot;) - Kazakhstan (Buzachi) in the east to about Lake Balkash, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan
*Yarkand gazelle (&quot;Gazella (subgutturosa) yarkandensis&quot;) - northern and northwestern China (Xinjiang, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Gansu, Nei Monggol), Mongolia; includes subspecies &quot;hilleriana&quot;.

=== Former subspecies ===

*The Arabian sand gazelle (&quot;Gazella marica&quot;) occurs in Saudi Arabia, southern Syria, southwestern Iraq, United Arab Emirates, Oman, offshore Persian Gulf islands.

Until recently, goitered gazelles were considered to represent a single, albeit polymorphic, species. However, recent genetic studies show one of the subspecies, &quot;G. s. marica&quot;, is paraphyletic in respect to the other populations of goitered gazelles,

<doc id="351623" wikidata="Q2878611" url="?curid=351623" title="Rod Roddy">
<text>Robert Ray &quot;Rod&quot; Roddy (September 28, 1937 – October 27, 2003) was an American radio and television announcer. He was primarily known for his role as an offstage announcer on game shows. Among the shows that Roddy announced are the CBS game shows &quot;Whew!&quot; and &quot;Press Your Luck.&quot; Roddy is widely recognized by the signature line, &quot;Come on down!&quot; from &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, and it appears on his grave marker, although the phrase was originated and made popular by his predecessor Johnny Olson. Roddy succeeded original announcer Olson on &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; and held the role from 1986 until his death in 2003, and as of 2022, is the longest-serving announcer on the current incarnation of the show. On many episodes of &quot;Press Your Luck&quot; and &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, Roddy appeared on camera. He was also the voice of Mike the microphone on &quot;Disney&#x27;s House of Mouse&quot; from 2001 until his death in 2003.

==Early career==
After graduating from Texas Christian University (TCU), Roddy began his professional broadcasting career as a disc jockey and talk show host on KLIF and KNUS-FM (now KSPF) in (Dallas, Texas). He also worked overnights and mid-days at the Buffalo, New York, radio station WKBW-AM (now WWKB), a clear channel radio station covering the Eastern Seaboard of the United States, and at other high-profile stations. Returning to KLIF and KNUS during the 1970s, Roddy hosted a call-in program, &quot;Rod Roddy&#x27;s Hotline&quot;, and became a frequent target of death threats. He conducted a long-running on-air feud with an elderly woman (dubbed &quot;Granny Hate&quot; by an earlier host), who claimed to represent the local Ku Klux Klan.

Roddy announced the sitcom &quot;Soap&quot; from 1977 to 1981, where he provided the opening and closing narration: &quot;Confused? You won&#x27;t be after this week&#x27;s episode of &quot;Soap&quot;!&quot; Roddy replaced Casey Kasem, who quit the series after the pilot due to the show&#x27;s content. Roddy&#x27;s first work as a game show announcer was on &quot;Whew!&quot;, which aired from 1979 to 1980. From there, he went on to announce several other game shows, including &quot;Battlestars&quot; (1981–1982), &quot;Love Connection&quot; (1983–1985, 1986), &quot;Hit Man&quot; (1983) and &quot;Press Your Luck&quot; (1983–1986). He also worked as a substitute announcer on &quot;Family Feud&quot;, &quot;Card Sharks&quot; and &quot;$25,000 Pyramid&quot;. He was the guest announcer for two weeks on the Tom Bergeron version of &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; that featured game show hosts and panelists as the celebrities. Roddy also voiced a number of national television commercials, including those for Pennzoil and Public Storage.

==&quot;The Price Is Right&quot;==
After Goodson-Todman announcer Johnny Olson died in October 1985, Roddy was chosen as one of several substitute announcers (along with Rich Jeffries, Bob Hilton, and Gene Wood) to announce &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;. According to former producer Roger Dobkowitz, both he and CBS liked Roddy the best. Despite only announcing for six episodes (the least of the four), on February 17, 1986, Roddy was announced as the show&#x27;s regular announcer. He was also the announcer on Tom Kennedy&#x27;s nighttime &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; after Olson&#x27;s death.

Overweight for much of his adult life, Roddy later adopted a rigorous diet and exercise program which resulted in a loss of close to 200 pounds. With his weight-loss regimen becoming a much-lauded success (frequently being mentioned by Bob Barker), Roddy was frequently shown on-camera, at least once per show while he announced &quot;the next contestant on &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;&quot;, and was occasionally featured in Showcase skits aiding the &quot;Barker&#x27;s Beauties&quot;, similar to Olson&#x27;s frequent on-camera appearances.

Roddy was also noted for wearing brightly colored and sequined sport jackets, a practice he first adopted as a trademark when making personal appearances emceeing teen dances and concerts for WKBW in Buffalo in the 1960s. On &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, Roddy first wore vivid pastel jackets made in Hong Kong, to contrast with Barker&#x27;s &quot;dapper&quot; fashion sense. With the encouragement of Barker, he turned them into a staple of the show and traveled to Thailand several times a year to have the suits custom-made in colorful Thai silk. Roddy would also frequently travel to Thailand as the official ambassador to Chiang Mai.

==Illness and death==
On September 11, 2001, Roddy was diagnosed with colon cancer, and took a leave of absence to undergo and recover from surgery and chemotherapy, and he returned a month later (though the shows that were taped during his absence did not air until after Roddy returned to work). A year later, the cancer returned, and Roddy temporarily took another leave of absence to undergo and recover from surgery on September 20, 2002. Again, he recovered within a month. In April 2003, Roddy was diagnosed with male breast cancer. He underwent surgery and afterwards, experienced major complications. As a result, Roddy was unable to announce for &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; for the rest of Season 31. The diagnoses led to Roddy becoming a spokesperson for early detection of cancer in his last years. In an interview with CBS, Roddy commented to the general public:

Roddy continued to announce for &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; until his last hospitalization two months before his death on October 27, 2003, at the age of 66. After his departure from the show, Burton Richardson and Randy West filled-in. Roddy was replaced by Rich Fields in April 2004. Roddy&#x27;s final episode aired on October 20, 2003, one week before his death. Roddy is interred at Fort Worth&#x27;s Greenwood Memorial Park. He had &quot;Come on Down&quot; inscribed on his tombstone, a phrase popularized by Johnny Olson.

Roddy was given a short tribute recorded shortly afterwards as a segment that lasted eighteen seconds, narrated by Barker, which aired before the start of a later episode:

Following Barker&#x27;s tribute is a message saying In Loving Memory of ROD RODDY 1937-2003. Craig Kilborn, then in his final season as host of &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;, paid tribute to Roddy (a frequent guest and friend of Kilborn&#x27;s) in a lengthy clip montage to end the October 28, 2003, show.

In a similar manner to the 18-second tribute, Roddy is mentioned a single time in Barker&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Priceless Memories&quot;, when Barker lists the series&#x27; announcers since 1972. However, Barker did speak of Roddy at length for an interview with CBS Radio the day after his death, including a mention of visiting him in the hospital several days before his death.

<doc id="351627" wikidata="Q110084" url="?curid=351627" title="Serum (blood)">
<text>Serum () is the fluid and solvent component of blood which does not play a role in clotting. It may be defined as blood plasma without the clotting factors, or as blood with all cells and clotting factors removed. Serum contains all proteins except clotting factors (involved in blood clotting), including all electrolytes, antibodies, antigens, hormones; and any exogenous substances (e.g., drugs, microorganisms). Serum also does not contain all the formed elements of blood, which include blood cells, white blood cells (leukocytes, lymphocytes), red blood cells (erythrocytes), and platelets.

The study of serum is serology. Serum is used in numerous diagnostic tests as well as blood typing. Measuring the concentration of various molecules can be useful for many applications, such as determining the therapeutic index of a drug candidate in a clinical trial.

To obtain serum, a blood sample is allowed to clot (coagulation). The sample is then centrifuged to remove the clot and blood cells, and the resulting liquid is serum.

== Clinical and laboratory uses ==
The serum of convalescent patients successfully recovering (or already recovered) from an infectious disease can be used as a biopharmaceutical in the treatment of other people with that disease, because the antibodies generated by the successful recovery are potent fighters of the pathogen. Such &quot;convalescent serum&quot; (antiserum) is a form of immunotherapy.

Serum is also used in protein electrophoresis, due to the lack of fibrinogen which can cause false results.

Fetal bovine serum (FBS) is rich in growth factors and is frequently added to growth media used for eukaryotic cell culture. A combination of FBS and the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor was originally used to maintain embryonic stem cells, but concerns about batch-to-batch variations in FBS have led to the development of serum substitutes.

==Purification strategies==
Blood serum and plasma are some of the largest sources of biomarkers, whether for diagnostics or therapeutics. Its vast dynamic range, further complicated by the presence of lipids, salts, and post-translational modifications, as well as multiple mechanisms of degradation, presents challenges in analytical reproducibility, sensitivity, resolution, and potential efficacy. For analysis of biomarkers in blood serum samples, it is possible to do a pre-separation by free-flow electrophoresis that usually consists of a depletion of serum albumin protein. This method enables greater penetration of the proteome via separation of a wide variety of charged or chargeable analytes, ranging from small molecules to cells.

==Usage note==
Like many other mass nouns, the word &quot;serum&quot; can be pluralized when used in certain senses. To speak of multiple serum specimens from multiple people (each with a unique population of antibodies), physicians sometimes speak of sera (the Latin plural, as opposed to &quot;serums&quot;). Etymologically serum is derived from the Proto-Indo-European *ser- (&quot;to flow, run&quot;).

<text>The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) (often called &quot;the Chicago Merc&quot;, or &quot;the Merc&quot;) is a global derivatives marketplace based in Chicago and located at 20 S. Wacker Drive. The CME was founded in 1898 as the Chicago Butter and Egg Board, an agricultural commodities exchange. For most of its history, the exchange was in the then common form of a non-profit organization, owned by members of the exchange. The Merc demutualized in November 2000, went public in December 2002, and merged with the Chicago Board of Trade in July 2007 to become a designated contract market of the CME Group Inc., which operates both markets. The chairman and chief executive officer of CME Group is Terrence A. Duffy, Bryan Durkin is president. On August 18, 2008, shareholders approved a merger with the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and COMEX. CME, CBOT, NYMEX, and COMEX are now markets owned by CME Group. After the merger, the value of the CME quadrupled in a two-year span, with a market cap of over $25 billion.

Today, CME is the largest options and futures contracts open interest (number of contracts outstanding) exchange of any futures exchange in the world. The Merc trades several types of financial instruments: interest rates, equities, currencies, and commodities.

CME also pioneered the CME SPAN software that is used around the world as the official performance bond (margin) mechanism of 50 registered exchanges, clearing organizations, service bureaus, and regulatory agencies throughout the world.

== Trading platforms ==
Trading is conducted in two methods; an open outcry format and the CME Globex electronic system. More than 90 percent of total volume at the exchange occurs electronically on CME Globex.

===Open outcry===
Operating during regular trading hours (RTH), the open outcry method consists of floor traders standing in a trading pit to call out orders, prices, and quantities of a particular commodity or its derivatives. Different colored jackets are worn by the traders to indicate what firm they are a part of. In addition, complex hand signals (called Arb) are used. These hand signals were first used in the 1970s. Today, however, headsets are also used by the brokers to communicate with the traders. The pits are areas of the floor that are lowered to facilitate communication, somewhat like a miniature amphitheater. The pits can be raised and lowered depending on trading volume. To an onlooker, the open outcry system can look chaotic and confusing, but in reality, the system is a tried and true method of accurate and efficient trading. An illustrated project to record the hand signal language used in CME&#x27;s trading pits has been compiled.
CME Group announced in 2021 that it will permanently close most of its physical trading pits, including those for grain trading. They had been closed since March 2020 due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.

===Electronic trading===
Operating virtually around the clock, today the CME Globex Trading System is at the heart of CME. Proposed in 1987, it was introduced in 1992 as the first global electronic trading platform for futures contracts. This fully electronic trading system allows market participants to trade from booths at the exchange or while sitting in a home or office thousands of miles away. On October 19, 2004, the one billionth (1,000,000,000) transaction was recorded.

When CME Globex was first launched, it used Reuters&#x27; technology and network. September 1998 saw the launch of the second generation of CME Globex using a modified version of the NSC trading system, developed by Paris Bourse for the MATIF (now Euronext).

Traders connect to CME Globex via Market Data Protocol (MDP) and iLink 2.0 for order routing.

==Merger==
On October 17, 2006, Chicago Mercantile Exchange announced a merger with the Chicago Board of Trade in an $8 billion deal. Shareholders of both companies approved the merger on July 9, 2007, and the deal closed on July 12, 2007. The overarching holding company then launched as CME Group. On January 13, 2008, electronic trading at the Chicago Board of Trade shifted onto CME Globex.

== Investigation ==
In 1984, the CME was investigated by the U.S. Government Accountability Office. During this investigation, it was realized that the open-outcry system could be abused. The GAO noted that the exchange made attempts to cut down on malpractice, but that it is likely that illegal activity still occurs.

== Products ==
Chicago Mercantile Exchange was known as the Chicago Butter and Egg Board when it was founded in 1898, and futures available through the exchange were initially limited to agricultural products. In 1919 the Board was restructured and the name changed to Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which reflected a new focus on commodities beyond butter and eggs, including potatoes, onions, and cheese. In 1972, CME introduced the first financial futures market, offering contracts on seven foreign currencies. By the 2000s, CME had expanded to offer four core financial instruments: commodities, foreign exchange, interest rates, and stock indexes. As of 2022, CME operates under CME Group, which offers a number of derivatives products, including commodities, equity indices, foreign exchange, interest rates, and weather.

For example, as of 2017, agricultural contracts were offered on products such as wheat, corn, soybeans, and lean hogs. In metal futures, the CME trades precious metals, base metals, and ferrous metals. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange is the only market for trading in weather derivatives. It launched its first weather products in 1999. Products include, but are not limited to: futures on rainfall, snowfall, hurricanes, and temperature.

<doc id="351633" wikidata="Q858133" url="?curid=351633" title="Knock, County Mayo">
<text>Knock (, meaning &quot;The Hill&quot; – but now more generally known in Irish as &quot;Cnoc Mhuire&quot;, &quot;Hill of (the Virgin) Mary&quot;) is a village in County Mayo, Ireland.

Knock is also a civil parish in the ancient barony of Costello.

It is notable as the location of Knock Shrine - a Marian shrine and place of pilgrimage. According to Catholic beliefs, Mary, mother of Jesus, Saint Joseph and Saint John the Evangelist appeared to witnesses in the village on 21 August 1879. There is international skepticism of this event due to the age of the witnesses and the lack of evidence supporting the event. In the 20th century, Knock became one of Europe&#x27;s most visited shrines to the Virgin Mary, along with Lourdes and Fatima. It was a focus of peace pilgrimages in Ireland during the Second World War, when the faithful prayed for peace. One and a half million pilgrims visit the shrine annually.

In 1979, on the centenary of the apparition, Pope John Paul II visited the shrine. On 26 August 2018, Pope Francis visited the basilica while in Ireland for the 9th World Meeting of Families.

==Name==
Knock comes from the Irish word &quot;cnoc&quot; meaning hill, historical evidence shows the village had been named that as far back as 1625. The Irish language name was changed to &quot;Cnoc Mhuire&quot; meaning the hill of the Virgin Mary after the visions. The parish and village of Knock is sometimes referred to historically and in Lewis&#x27; 1837 topographical dictionary as &quot;Knockdrumcalry&quot; (Cnoc Droma Chálraighe) meaning &quot;hill of the ridge of the Cálraighe&quot;.
==Civil History==
The civil parish of Knock covers 45 townlands. Thirty five of the townlands are in the barony of Costello. The remaining 10 townlands along the central western boundary of the parish are in the neighbouring barony of Clanmorris. Knock is located five miles from the town of Claremorris (one of the major market towns of the early 19th century) and is between Claremorris and Ballyhaunis.

==Monsignor James Horan==
Monsignor James Horan (1911–1986) became parish priest of Knock in 1963. During his tenure, he oversaw the construction of a new basilica church with a capacity for 10,000 worshipers. &quot;Our Lady, Queen of Ireland&quot; was consecrated in 1967. Monsignor Horan was also involved in the construction of the nearby Ireland West Airport. He was a leading advocate in issuing an invitation to Pope John Paul II to visit Knock in 1979 to commemorate the centenary of the Marian apparition.

==Education==
The local primary school is Knock National School, built in 1966.

==Sport==
The local soccer club is Kiltimagh Knock United F.C. established in 2002. Their ground, CMS Park, is situated in Cloonlee on the Knock/Kiltimagh Road, 3 km from the village. There is no other sports club located in the parish area and players from the village often play for Aghamore.

Ireland West Airport, which is located 19 km (12 miles) to the north of the village on the N17 road near Charlestown, was opened by Monsignor James Horan on 30 May 1986 and has been an important tourism boost for the village and shrine.

<text>Curses, Hexes and Spells is a 1974 book by Daniel Cohen. Marketed as children&#x27;s book, it explains what &quot;curses&quot; are, and describes supposed curses on families (such as the House of Atreus in Greek mythology, the House of Habsburg or the Kennedy family), creatures, places (the Bermuda Triangle, the Devil&#x27;s Sea), wanderers (like the Flying Dutchman) and ghosts. It also describes a few protective amulets from supposed &quot;occult&quot; dangers, and briefly touches on birthstones.

&quot;Curses, Hexes, and Spells&quot; is number 73 on the American Library Association&#x27;s list of the 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990–2000. The book also appears on several other lists of &quot;banned&quot;/challenged books in the United States such as &quot;The New York Times&quot; 50 Most Frequently Banned Books in which it is number 11.

<doc id="351638" wikidata="Q1573860" url="?curid=351638" title="Hammersmith Bridge">
<text>Hammersmith Bridge is a suspension bridge that crosses the River Thames in west London. It links the southern part of Hammersmith in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham, on the north side of the river, with Barnes in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, on the south side of the river. The current bridge, which is Grade II* listed and was designed by civil engineer Sir Joseph Bazalgette, is the second permanent bridge on the site, and has been attacked three times by the IRA.

The bridge was closed indefinitely to all motor traffic in April 2019 after cracks were discovered in the bridge&#x27;s pedestals. The closure was extended to pedestrians and cyclists between August 2020 and July 2021 when limited use resumed. In October 2022, Hammersmith and Fulham Council agreed to lodge a planning application to temporarily double-deck the bridge to speed up its restoration, with the council&#x27;s construction and ongoing operation and maintenance costs set to be eventually funded by tolls.

==History==
===Origins===

A group of local people proposed a new bridge at Hammersmith rather than detouring to either Kew Bridge or Putney Bridge to cross the river. The construction of the bridge was first sanctioned by an act of Parliament, the (5 Geo. 4. c.cxii), on 9 June 1824, which established the Hammersmith Bridge Company. Work began on site the following year, and the bridge was opened on 6 October 1827. Construction of the bridge cost some £80,000 (equivalent to £ million in ).
It was the first suspension bridge over the River Thames and was designed by William Tierney Clark. A further act of Parliament, the (9 Geo. 4. c. lii) was obtained in 1828. The acts also included powers to acquire land by compulsory purchase in order to build approach roads, and required the company to purchase the entire Barn Elms estate (the surplus land was subsequently sold).

Hammersmith Bridge Road in Hammersmith was also constructed with the bridge, together with Upper Bridge Road (now Castelnau) and Lower Bridge Road (now Lonsdale Road) in Barnes. It was operated as a toll bridge, with the toll house located at the Hammersmith end of the bridge.

The bridge had a clear water-way of . Its suspension towers were above the level of the roadway, where they were thick. The roadway was slightly curved upwards, above high water, and the extreme length from the back of the piers on shore was , supporting of roadway. There were eight chains, composed of wrought-iron bars, each five inches deep and one thick. Four of these had six bars in each chain; and four had only three, making thirty-six bars, which form a dip in the centre of about . From these, vertical rods were suspended, which supported the roadway, formed of strong timbers covered with granite. The width of the carriageway was , with two footways of . The chains passed over the suspension towers, and were secured to the piers on each shore. The suspension towers were built of stone, and designed as archways of the Tuscan order. The approaches were provided with octagonal lodges, or toll-houses, with appropriate lamps and parapet walls, terminating with stone pillars, surmounted with ornamental caps.

In order to increase profits, the company built a floating steamboat pier to the downstream side of the suspension pier closest to Barnes.

By the 1870s, the bridge was no longer strong enough to support the weight of heavy traffic and the owners were alarmed in 1870 when 11,000 to 12,000 people crowded onto the bridge to watch the University Boat Race, which passes underneath just before the halfway point of its course.

The Metropolitan Board of Works purchased the bridge from the Hammersmith Bridge Company in 1880 under the Metropolis Toll Bridges Act 1877 (40 &amp; 41 Vict. c. xcix), and transferred the approach roads to the local authorities (Fulham District Board of Works and the Parish of Barnes). The tolls were removed from the bridge on 26 June 1880.

There were no immediate plans to replace the bridge, which remained sound, until a boat collided with it in 1882 causing damage, and leading to an Act of Parliament in 1883 authorising the construction of a replacement. In 1884 a temporary bridge was put up to allow a more limited cross-river traffic while a replacement was constructed.

=== 1880s construction ===

The current Hammersmith Bridge was designed by Sir Joseph Bazalgette and rests on the same pier foundations constructed for Tierney Clark&#x27;s original structure. The new bridge was built by Dixon, Appleby &amp; Thorne and was opened by the Prince of Wales on 11 June 1887. With much of the supporting structure built of wrought iron, it is long and wide and cost £82,117 to build (equivalent to £ million in ).

With the abolition of the Metropolitan Board of Works on 21 March 1889, ownership of Hammersmith Bridge passed to the new London County Council.

=== 20th century ===

Near midnight on 27 December 1919, Lieutenant Charles Campbell Wood, a South African serving as an airman in the Royal Air Force, dived from the upstream footway of the bridge into the Thames to rescue a drowning woman. Although Wood saved her life, he later died from tetanus as a consequence of his injuries. His act of bravery is commemorated by a plaque on the handrail, which reads: 
The first attempt by Irish republicans to destroy Hammersmith Bridge occurred on Wednesday 29 March 1939, when it was attacked by the IRA (of 1922–1969) as part of their S-Plan. Maurice Childs, a women&#x27;s hairdresser from nearby Chiswick, was walking home across the bridge at one o&#x27;clock in the morning when he noticed smoke and sparks coming from a suitcase that was lying on the walkway. He opened it to find a bomb and quickly threw the bag into the river. The resulting explosion sent up a column of water. Moments later, a second device exploded causing some girders on the west side of the bridge to collapse and windows in nearby houses to shatter. Childs was later awarded an MBE for his quick-thinking. Eddie Connell and William Browne were subsequently jailed for 20 and 10 years respectively for their involvement in the attack.

On 1 April 1965, the bridge was transferred to the Greater London Council (GLC) when it took over from London County Council.

In 1986 the GLC was abolished. The Local Government Act 1985 transferred non-trunk road bridges in their entirety to one of the two London boroughs that each bridge lay within – the choice of borough to be decided between the two councils, or failing agreement, by the Secretary of State for Transport. In addition to the bridge, the London borough taking responsibility also gained 100 yards of approach road from the other borough. For Hammersmith Bridge, on 31 March 1986 the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham took responsibility.

On 26 April 1996, the Provisional IRA attempted to destroy the bridge after installing two large Semtex devices on the south bank of the Thames. Though the detonators were activated, the bomb, the largest Semtex bomb ever found in Britain at the time, failed to ignite.

At 4:30 am on 1 June 2000, the bridge was damaged by a Real IRA bomb planted underneath the Barnes span. Following two years of closure for repairs the bridge was reopened with further weight restrictions in place.

== Structural problems ==

Hammersmith Bridge has long suffered structural problems and has been closed for lengthy periods on several occasions, due to the weight and volume of road traffic now common in inner London, which the bridge was not originally designed to support.

The bridge was refurbished in 1973 with replacement steel trusses, improvements to the mid-span hangers and new deck expansion joints. New deck timbers were installed and surfacing was changed from wooden blocks to coated plywood panels. These panels were subsequently replaced in 1987.

In 1984, the Barnes-side tower bearings failed under a heavy load and had to be replaced.

In February 1997, the bridge was closed to all traffic except buses, bicycles, motorcycles, emergency vehicles and pedestrians to allow further essential repair works. Structural elements of the bridge had been found to be corroded or worn, in particular cross girders and deck surfacing, as well as some areas of masonry.

The bridge re-opened in July 1998 to all road users, subject to a weight restriction and with a priority measure in place for buses. Local bus flow was controlled by traffic lights, and routes (such as the number 72) were required to convert from double-decker buses to smaller single-deckers to reduce the load on the bridge.

As part of the renovations following the 2000 bomb attack, the bridge received a complete new paint job restoring it to the original colour scheme of 1887, and new lighting was installed.

The bridge was declared a Grade II* listed structure in 2008, providing protection to preserve its special character from unsympathetic development.

The bridge was temporarily closed to traffic to allow repairs in early 2014. Further repairs and strengthening works were delayed in November 2016 in a wrangle over funding between Hammersmith and Fulham Council and Transport for London. LBHF leader Steven Cowan said: &quot;There&#x27;s no way that this council is going to spend anything like that money, the majority of this issue is the responsibility of TfL and we will work with them to make sure the bridge is fit for public purpose&quot;.

===2019–24 closure===
With funding for a major refurbishment still not resolved, on 10 April 2019, Hammersmith and Fulham Council announced that the bridge would be closed indefinitely to motor vehicular traffic due to safety concerns. Pedestrians and cyclists could continue to use the bridge. It was later (24 May 2019) reported that the closure was due to cracks in the bridge&#x27;s pedestals, the footings which support the structure.

On 10 October 2019, &quot;Planning in London&quot; magazine published the results of its competition for a quick fix to Hammersmith Bridge&#x27;s closure. The winning entry, by marine civil engineers Beckett Rankine, consisted of a prefabricated temporary road and foot bridge downstream of Hammersmith bridge and connecting in to Queen Caroline Street on the Hammersmith side. Beckett Rankine claimed that the bridge&#x27;s cost could be recouped by charging a toll on vehicles.

The bridge&#x27;s closure was extended to pedestrians and cyclists on 13 August 2020 after the structural issues worsened due to a heatwave. River traffic and pedestrian routes under the bridge were also stopped. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported an estimate of £141 million (US$187 million) to fully repair the bridge and £46 million (US$65 million) to stabilise it adequately for use by cyclists and pedestrians. Neither the council nor the transportation authority had the funds to proceed. Deficits incurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic made it unlikely that the bridge would be repaired in the near future.

On 9 September 2020, the Secretary of State for Transport, Grant Shapps appointed a Department for Transport task force to investigate the bridge&#x27;s condition, and work towards reopening the bridge for cyclists and pedestrians, and later enabling the return of motor traffic. In October 2020, it was announced that Hammersmith Bridge would not re-open to vehicles until at least 2027. In November 2020, engineers proposed a temporary double-decked steel structure fitted within the existing bridge crossing to allow elements of the damaged bridge to be removed for repair. The scheme, designed by Foster and Partners with bridge engineers COWI, was backed by the local council and presented to Shapps.

The Fosters scheme, costed at around £100 million, would potentially allow the bridge to reopen for pedestrians and cyclists in the summer of 2021, with cars and vans able to cross two months later, and full restoration completed in 2023. The proposals were discussed on 19 March 2021 at a meeting of the government&#x27;s Hammersmith Bridge taskforce, and plans for the work to be funded through a £3 toll scheme were accepted.

In December 2020, reports from AECOM and University of Cambridge professor Norman Fleck suggested that the full closure may have been overly cautious, and that, after minimal work, the bridge could be reopened to cyclists and pedestrians.

On 14 February 2021, local residents illuminated the bridge scarlet with a Valentine&#x27;s Day message reading &quot;Broken Hearts. Broken Promises. Broken Lives. Broken Bridge,&quot; to highlight the ongoing delays to its repair.

===2021: partial reopening===
On 1 June 2021, Transport for London, Hammersmith and Fulham Borough Council and central government came to a cost-sharing agreement that would reopen the bridge in the near future. The following month, Stephen Cowan, leader of the Council, announced that the bridge would partially re-open to pedestrians and cyclists from 17 July 2021, but local MP Sarah Olney said there was still a lot of work to be done to the bridge.

A £6 million, 46-week stabilisation plan designed by consultants Mott MacDonald was approved by Hammersmith and Fulham Council in August 2021. This initial pedestrian stabilisation plan is the first phase of works on the bridge. A second phase, involving extensive strengthening and full restoration, will allow the bridge to eventually reopen to motor vehicles.

===2022: repairs===
In February 2022, highways contractor FM Conway and subcontractors Freyssinet and Taziker Industrial started work on a planned 10-month first phase of the restoration. The council approved the full £8.9 million investment in expectation that DfT and TfL will subsequently reimburse the council for their one-third shares. Completion of this work was put back to February 2023 following delays in procuring steel due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

In May 2022, Hammersmith and Fulham Council alerted contractors to the £130 million phase 2 contract ahead of formal procurement later in the year. It was considering delivery options including a design, build, finance and maintain model, a design-and-build contract, or other &quot;concession-style models&quot;, which could involve motor vehicles paying a toll to use the crossing. A council spokesman said: &quot;The government has decreed that Hammersmith and Fulham must pay an unprecedentedly high 33% of the total cost. The only way that can be met is with a toll and this has been agreed by all parties.&quot;

In July 2022, the chains were wrapped in foil and cooled with air-conditioning to 13°C during a heatwave to prevent further cracking.

In October 2022, Hammersmith and Fulham Council agreed to lodge a planning application to temporarily double-deck the bridge to speed up its restoration (as recommended by Foster/COWI). Consultation would be required with stakeholders including Historic England, the Environment Agency, Port of London Authority, Richmond Council and the Marine Management Organisation, while preparations would also require gas main diversions. The council intended to appoint a private sector contractor to design, renovate, finance and maintain the bridge, with the council&#x27;s construction and ongoing operation and maintenance costs funded by tolls.

=== 2024: partial reopening ===

In February 2024, Hammersmith &amp; Fulham Council announced the temporary reopening to cyclists of the central vehicle lane for a 10-week period from 13 February 2024. This decision was due to a pause in construction works necessary for repairing a steel gantry damaged in a collision with a boat, MV &quot;Emerald of London&quot;, carrying West Ham United football fans to a match against Fulham in December 2023.

The final stage of the stabilisation works is the replacement of the bridge&#x27;s bearings on the four corner pedestals, following which Hammersmith &amp; Fulham Council will &quot;review e-mobility options to shuttle residents across the bridge, notably the elderly or disabled&quot;.

=== Alternatives to reopening to motor vehicles ===
On 18 January 2024, the BBC reported the cost of repairing the bridge had increased to £250 million (US$316 million). A day later, London Mayor Sadiq Khan told the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; that &quot;I do want that bridge fit for purpose for vehicles&quot; but neither Hammersmith &amp; Fulham Council nor TfL had the money to do so. The &quot;Evening Standard&quot; noted that TfL&#x27;s 2024 Business Plan did not include funding for the bridge. While the bridge remains closed to motor vehicles, alternative transport options have been proposed.

In May 2023, the BBC reported climate charity Possible&#x27;s proposal for a fleet of 10 autonomous pods to operate on the bridge and ferry people with mobility difficulties, alongside a two-way protected cycle lane and the existing pedestrian footways at a cost of £10 million (US$13 million).

In 2021, a plan to launch a community pedicab service, proposed by Barnes Community Association using vehicles owned and operated by CityShuttle, was abandoned due to issues raised by TfL relating to the licensing status of pedicabs.

However, The Pedicabs (London) Bill will make TfL responsible for regulating pedicabs and in a House of Commons debate in November 2023 Richmond Park MP Sarah Olney welcomed the bill and proposed rickshaws &quot;as an interim transport solution across Hammersmith bridge&quot;. During debate of the bill on 11 December 2023, Baroness Stowell backed introducing pedicabs to the bridge: &quot;The problems associated with the closure of Hammersmith Bridge, which have gone on for years, are very serious for local residents. Let us turn a negative into a positive: pedicabs offer an opportunity for local residents to hire one to cross the bridge, which would be really useful.&quot;

==Heraldry==

At both the Hammersmith and Barnes ends of the bridge, there is a heraldic composition made up of seven coats of arms. These were formerly painted in their &quot;correct&quot; heraldic colours but have now been painted in the standard colour scheme. In the centre is the royal coat of arms of Queen Victoria which is surrounded by six others, representing the area of the Metropolitan Board of Works, from top clockwise: 
*1: Coat of arms of the Borough of Guildford (representing Surrey): &quot;Sable, on a mount vert between two woolpacks argent a castle with three towers argent the central one triple-towered and charged with a shield of the royal arms of France and England quarterly the outer towers each surmounted by a spire under the battlements two roses in fesse and within the open port beneath a portcullis a key all Or on the mount before the port a lion chouchant guardant also or the base barry wavy argent and azure&quot;
*2: Coat of arms of the City of Westminster: &quot;Azure, a portcullis or on a chief of the second a pallet of the first thereon a cross flory between five martlets also of the second being the arms of King Edward the Confessor between two united roses gules and argent&quot;
*3: Coat of arms of the Borough of Colchester (representing Essex): &quot;Gules, four pieces of wood raguly conjoined in a cross proper each side arm transfixed with a nail palewise sable ensigned by an ancient crown or and that in base enfiling a like crown and transfixed by a like nail in bend&quot;
*4: Coat of arms of the County of Middlesex (in its original form without the crown, identical to that of the later Essex County Council)
*5: Coat of arms of the City of London
*6: Coat of arms of the County of Kent

<text>Earl Kemp Long (August 26, 1895 – September 5, 1960) was an American politician who served as the 45th governor of Louisiana on three occasions (1939–1940, 1948–1952, and 1956–1960). A member of the Democratic Party, he held the same position that his brother, Huey Long, held years earlier (1928–1932).

Long served as lieutenant governor of Louisiana from 1936 to 1939. Trying to keep a close hand in state government, he failed in three other bids to be elected lieutenant governor, in 1932, 1944, and 1959. Long was nominated in the summer of 1960 to the United States House of Representatives for Louisiana&#x27;s 8th congressional district, and was running unopposed in the general election, but he died before he could take office.

During his career, Long promoted a progressive agenda by expanding school-lunch programs, teacher pay, public-works projects, and minority voting rights. Known as &quot;Uncle Earl&quot;, Long connected with voters through his folksy demeanor and colorful oratory. His sometimes erratic behavior – including a liaison with New Orleans stripper Blaze Starr – did not affect his electoral success.

==First races for governor==
Long first ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1932 without the support of his brother, Governor and U.S. Senator-elect Huey Long, who was committed in that election to the successful candidates, Oscar K. Allen of Winnfield for governor and John B. Fournet of St. Martinville for lieutenant governor. In his autobiography, &quot;Every Man a King&quot;, Huey Long said that Earl Long&#x27;s first candidacy for lieutenant governor brought forth charges of a family dynasty in the making.

Not long after Huey Long&#x27;s assassination, however, Earl Long handily defeated fellow Democrat Clement Murphy Mos (much later a judge in Lake Charles) in the primary held for lieutenant governor in January 1936. Richard W. Leche of New Orleans was elected governor in 1936, but he resigned in scandal in 1939, and Long succeeded for 11 months to the governorship.

==Governorships==
===1939–1940===
Long failed to win a gubernatorial term of his own in the election of 1940. During his abbreviated term, Long appointed a cousin, Floyd Harrison Long Sr., as the custodian of the Central State (Mental) Hospital in Pineville. Earl Long&#x27;s brief first tenure corresponded with the &quot;Louisiana Hayride&quot; scandals that engulfed both Governor Leche and the president of Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, James Monroe Smith.

Long was defeated in the Democratic primary by the conservative lawyer Sam H. Jones of Lake Charles. After the abbreviated governorship, with Coleman Lindsey of Minden as lieutenant governor, Long was indicted in New Orleans on charges of embezzlement and extortion. The charges involved placing a &quot;deadhead&quot; (an unneeded state worker who performs few or no duties) on the payroll of a special state board.

===The 1944 election===
In 1944, Long did not run for governor as many had expected, but instead for his earlier position as lieutenant governor on an intraparty ticket with former U.S. Representative Lewis L. Morgan of Covington in St. Tammany Parish across Lake Pontchartrain from New Orleans. Long led the party balloting for the second position in state government, but he lost the runoff to J. Emile Verret of New Iberia, the choice of incoming Governor Jimmie Davis. His previous elected position was as a member and president of the Iberia Parish School Board.

Had Lewis Morgan not entered the second primary against Jimmie Davis, Long would have become lieutenant governor without a runoff. At the time, Louisiana law provided that there would be no statewide constitutional runoff elections unless there was also a second contest for governor. That rule did not apply to state legislative races, however. In the same campaign, the Long-endorsed candidate for attorney general, state Senator Joe T. Cawthorn of Mansfield, lost to the Davis-backed Fred S. LeBlanc.

Long blamed his failure to become lieutenant governor in 1944 on Louisiana Secretary of State Wade O. Martin Jr., a former ally with whom he quarreled for many years thereafter. Years later, he repaid Martin politically. In 1957, Long pushed through a new law, taking jurisdiction of insurance and voting machines from the secretary of state&#x27;s office and setting up two new patronage positions. Long appointed Rufus D. Hayes of Baton Rouge as the first insurance commissioner and Drayton Boucher of Webster Parish as the commissioner of voting machines. After Boucher decided not to run for office in the 1959–1960 election cycle, Long appointed Douglas Fowler of Red River Parish, who held the job for more than 20 years.

===1948–1957===
In 1948, Long was elected governor to succeed Jimmie Davis. At the time, the salary was $12,000 annually. Long defeated his old rival Sam Jones by a wide margin. Eliminated in the first primary was U.S. Representative James Hobson &quot;Jimmy&quot; Morrison of Hammond, who made his third and final gubernatorial bid. Long appointed A.A. Fredericks as his executive secretary. Harvey Locke Carey of Shreveport was the campaign manager for northwest Louisiana and later the short-term U. S. Attorney for the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana.

The &quot;Memphis Commercial Appeal&quot; criticized Long&#x27;s election as governor in 1948. Long &quot;promised everything but the moon&quot;—old-age pensions, veterans bonuses, and a new highway system. &quot;The voters took him at his word, for they elected him by the largest majority ever given a Louisiana candidate [in a gubernatorial runoff contest]. That may be something in the nature of poetic justice, for the majority of voters will be getting exactly what was promised them, and for which they asked, whether they knew it or not.&quot; During the second half of his four-year term, Governor Long became close to Margaret Dixon, the first woman managing editor of the &quot;Baton Rouge Morning Advocate&quot;. She often advised him on political strategy. In 1951, he appointed her to the LSU Board of Supervisors. Long suffered a major heart attack in 1950, but recovered.

In 1950, Long struck a deal with his intraparty rival, Mayor deLesseps Story Morrison, to return home rule to the Crescent City, which at the time was being virtually governed out of Baton Rouge. Morrison agreed not to work against Long&#x27;s nephew, Russell B. Long, who was successfully seeking a full term in the United States Senate. Instead, Morrison formally endorsed one of Long&#x27;s rivals, Malcolm Lafargue, the former U. S. attorney for the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana, based in Shreveport. Though Morrison &quot;endorsed&quot; Lafargue, he privately urged his followers to support Russell Long, whom he fully expected to win the race, anyway.

===1952–1956 interim period===
Term-limited and unable to run in the 1951–1952 elections, Long essentially sat out the statewide elections. According to Garry Boulard&#x27;s book, &quot;The Big Lie&quot; (2001), Long proved instrumental during the 1951–1952 campaign in charges of communism made against gubernatorial candidate Hale Boggs of New Orleans. Rival candidate Lucille May Grace attacked him publicly, but Boulard believes this was rigged by Plaquemines Parish boss Leander Perez. At a stormy session of the state Democratic committee, Long attacked Perez and Grace for attacking Boggs, but prevented Boggs from publicly defending himself. Some analysts thought this strategy greatly contributed to Boggs&#x27; defeat in the primary. Judge Robert F. Kennon of Minden won as governor, although most loyal Longites had lined up with Judge Carlos Spaht of Baton Rouge.

===1956–1960===

Long surfaced at the top of the state again in 1955–1956, when he scored an easy victory for governor over a field that included Mayor of New Orleans deLesseps Story &quot;Chep&quot; Morrison Sr., a law partner of Hale Boggs; state highway director Fred Preaus of Farmerville, the choice of outgoing Governor Robert Kennon; former state police superintendent Francis Grevemberg; and businessman James M. McLemore of Alexandria. As Louisiana governors rarely won in the first primary, Long&#x27;s first response on his victory was, &quot;Huey never done that, did he?&quot; In his second race for the office, McLemore ran on a primarily racial segregationist platform, following the ruling by the US Supreme Court in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (1954) that segregated public schools were unconstitutional.

In 1956, Long vetoed funding for the work undertaken by the LSU historian Edwin Adams Davis to establish the state archives. Davis appealed to the State Board of Liquidation for temporary relief until funding could be restored in the next legislative session. The archives became a permanent institution in Baton Rouge.

Long eased the governmental indignities placed on African Americans and allowed a considerable number to vote. He convinced the legislature to equalize teacher pay between the races. In 1959, in response to legislative attempts to restrict the suffrage, he called for full participation by blacks in Louisiana elections. He knew that he would attract most of the limited black vote, as most were still restricted by barriers to voter registration. In the 1950s, he quarreled with the state&#x27;s leading segregationist, then state Senator William M. Rainach of Claiborne Parish.

Long reappointed A.A. Fredericks as his executive secretary from 1959 to 1960, his last two years of his last term as governor. He appointed another confidante, former legislator Drayton Boucher of Springhill and later Baton Rouge, as interim &quot;Custodian of voting machines&quot; from 1958 to 1959, as he took the responsibility from the Secretary of State. Long supported another ally, Douglas Fowler of Coushatta, who won the position in 1960 after it was established as an elective office.

On three occasions, Long tapped Lorris M. Wimberly of Bienville Parish as Speaker of the Louisiana House of Representatives. In Louisiana, the powerful governor (although limited at the time by nonconsecutive terms) chooses the House Speaker despite the separation of powers. In his last term, Long named Wimberly as director of the state department of public works. In his last gubernatorial term from 1959 to 1960, Long relied heavily on his legislative floor leader, state Representative W.L. Rambo of Georgetown in Grant Parish, in getting bills through the legislature. Rambo was a Long &quot;by marriage&quot;, having wed the former Mary Alice Long.

In 1959, Long considered resigning as governor. His loyal lieutenant governor, Lether Frazar of Lake Charles, would have succeeded him as the Louisiana chief executive for some seven months. Under this scenario, Long planned to run again for governor in the December 1959 Democratic primary, but by leaving office early could avoid Louisiana&#x27;s ban (at the time) on governors&#x27; succeeding themselves. He never proceeded with this. Instead, the term-limited Long unsuccessfully sought the lieutenant governorship on a ticket headed by fellow Democrat and wealthy former Governor James A. Noe. Instead, Jimmie Davis was elected to a second non-consecutive term as governor in 1960, having first served from 1944 to 1948. It was said that in 1948 Long followed Davis and in 1960 Davis followed Long.

Long was defeated for lieutenant governor in the 1959 primary by the conservative C. C. &quot;Taddy&quot; Aycock of Franklin in St. Mary Parish in south Louisiana. Aycock also won the January 1960 runoff election over Alexandria Mayor W. George Bowdon Jr. In the 1959 primary, Long lost a race to Sheridan Garrett, 2,563 to 2,068, for a Winn Parish seat on the Louisiana Democratic State Central Committee.

==Social reform==

Like his brother Huey Long, Earl Long&#x27;s time as governor saw a number of initiatives in the social field. A $50 pension was provided for the aged, along with bonuses for veterans, while new charity hospitals and trade schools were established. Long also experimented with free hot lunches for all schoolchildren, and also added free ambulance services for charity hospitals and free dental clinics that travelled the state. Increases were also made to teachers&#x27; salaries, and for the first time the salaries of black teachers matched those of white teachers. During his second term, the legislature voted overwhelmingly for spending on increased assistance grants, a foster care program, teacher retirement, the retirement for certain school employees, school community units, vocational education, scholarships to children of veterans, a minimum wage scale for teachers, retirement pay of certain teachers, and free lunches. During Long&#x27;s third term, improvements were made in unemployment benefits while a &quot;right-to-work law&quot; was repealed in 1956, with the House of Representatives voting 57-44 and the Senate 21–18 in favour of repeal. As noted by one study, &quot;Repeal proved a boon for organized labor.&quot;

==&quot;Uncle Earl&quot; and anecdotes==

The colorful &quot;Uncle Earl&quot; (so-named because of his relatives, including nephew and U.S. Senator Russell Long) once joked that one day the people of Louisiana would elect &quot;good government, and they won&#x27;t like it!&quot; But, beneath his public persona as a simple, plain-spoken rural Louisianan of little education, he had an astute political mind of considerable intelligence. Earl Long was a master campaigner, who attracted large crowds when his caravan crisscrossed the state. He would not allow a local person to introduce him or his ticket mates at a rally. Only out-of-parish people could do the honor. Long reasoned that nearly any local person would have made some political enemies who might reject Earl Long just because that person&#x27;s &quot;enemy&quot; was pro-Long. Long was determined to get every vote possible, so tried to remain independent of local rivalries.

Both Earl Long and his brother Huey had grown close to Earl Williamson, a local politician in Caddo Parish. Williamson&#x27;s son, Don W. Williamson, later recalled Earl Long coming into their town of Vivian and picking up his father to join the Long entourage for a trip to Hot Springs, Arkansas, where they enjoyed drinking buttermilk and horse racing, as well as illicit attractions in the resort city. Long demanded absolute loyalty among his inner circle, often saying that he did not need them to back him when he was right, but when he was wrong. Long&#x27;s erratic political behavior led the aspiring singer Jay Chevalier to compose in 1959 the song, &quot;The Ballad of Earl K. Long&quot;.

===Long&#x27;s feud with Dave Pearce===
In the 1948 Democratic primary, W.E. Anderson of Tangipahoa Parish defeated Dave L. Pearce, a legislator from West Carroll Parish in northeastern Louisiana, for the position of Louisiana Commissioner of Agriculture and Forestry. For the 1952 primary, the Democratic Party renominated Anderson without opposition to a second term. After Anderson died that year, outgoing Governor Long appointed Pearce to finish the term. Pearce won a special election and also served as commissioner during the administration of the anti-Long Governor Robert F. Kennon of Minden.

Long&#x27;s first lieutenant governor, William J. &quot;Bill&quot; Dodd, in his memoir entitled &quot;Peapatch Politics: The Earl Long Era in Louisiana Politics&quot; (named for Earl Long&#x27;s &quot;Peapatch Farm&quot; in Winn Parish), writes that Earl Long developed a &quot;hatred&quot; for Pearce. The governor encouraged state entomologist Sidney McCrory of Ascension Parish to run against Pearce in the 1956 primary election. Dodd did not explain why the relationship between Long and Pearce had declined. McCrory defeated Pearce, but beginning with the 1959 primary, Pearce was nominated by the Democrats for the first of what became four consecutive terms as agriculture commissioner. That year, Earl Long ran for lieutenant governor, but lost to Taddy Aycock. Dodd noted with humor that Long had become irritated with McCrory after inviting him on Long&#x27;s intraparty ticket in 1956:

==Eccentricity and hospitalization==
Long was well known for eccentric behavior, leading some to suspect that he had bipolar disorder. In his last term in office, his wife, Blanche Revere Long (1902–1998), and others attempted to remove him on the grounds of mental instability. For a time, Long was confined to the Southeast Louisiana Hospital in Mandeville, but his legal adviser, Joseph A. Sims, was said to have rescued Long from the institution. Long was never formally diagnosed with any mental disorder. Commentators have speculated that political opposition may have led the effort to prove him mentally incompetent, including his wife, who resented his connection with Starr. He had a severe heart attack in 1951. Additionally, in his later years, he was alleged to have suffered from strokes, resulting in further mental impairment. Some have speculated that he may have suffered from dementia in his last days. 

==Presumptive congressman-elect==
Only a few months after his term as governor expired in 1960, Earl Long ran for the United States House of Representatives from Louisiana&#x27;s 8th congressional district. An entourage of Long backers from over the years flocked to support him in the race, including Bill Dodd, former Senate floor leader C. H. &quot;Sammy&quot; Downs, state Senator Sixty Rayburn, the Long attorney Joseph A. Sims, and A.A. Fredericks, Long&#x27;s former executive assistant.

Due to a third candidate, former State Representative Ben F. Holt of Rapides Parish, Long finished in second place in the primary election and was compelled into a runoff contest for the Democratic nomination with the short-term incumbent, Alexandria attorney Harold B. McSween, which Long won. Because no Republican filed for the seat, Long was poised to run unopposed in the general election set for November 8, 1960. However, in September he suffered a fatal heart attack while in the Baptist Hospital (later Rapides General Hospital) in Alexandria.

After Earl Long&#x27;s death, the Democratic State Central Committee gave the nomination to McSween, who had earlier succeeded Earl Long&#x27;s late brother George Long in the 8th district seat. McSween was thus unopposed in the 1960 general election and won a second consecutive term in the U.S. House. In 1962, McSween was defeated in the primary election by his fellow liberal Democrat, Gillis William Long, who claimed to be the rightful heir to the Long dynasty. His funeral in Baton Rouge attracted numerous attendees. Long was interred at the Earl K. Long Memorial Park in Winnfield. His nephew, U.S. Senator Russell Long, was among the pallbearers.

<doc id="351653" wikidata="Q1525029" url="?curid=351653" title="Gingoog">
<text>Gingoog ( ), officially the City of Gingoog (; ), is a component city in the province of Misamis Oriental, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 136,698 people.

Like other municipalities in the Philippines that retained Spanish-based orthography, the city name is spelled as &quot;Gingoog&quot; but is pronounced as or since it originated as a Binukid word.

==History==
The term Gingoog originally came from the word &quot;Hingoog&quot;, which means &quot;Goodluck&quot;, from a Lumad tribe of Manobo who settled in the area. The word implies good fortune, thus Gingoog means the &quot;City of Good Luck&quot;. The natives of this place are the ones with the family names of &quot;Gingco&quot;, and &quot;Gingoyon&quot;.

Gingoog was founded as a mission by Spanish missionaries in 1750. It was one of the oldest localities in Misamis Oriental Province, older than the province&#x27;s capital and economic hub, Cagayan de Oro which was founded in 1871.

The territory of then-independent Gingoog was made part of Talisayan for a while, since the passage of &quot;Act No. 951&quot;, issued by the Philippine Commission on October 21, 1903, which reduced the number of municipalities in the then-undivided Misamis province from 24 to 10, until becoming the first former municipality to be reconstituted thereafter through &quot;Act No. 1618&quot;, enacted on March 20, 1907 and took effect on August 10.

During the early 20th century, with its abundant natural resources, Gingoog slowly continued to edge forward their economic progress, attracting migrants from Luzon and Visayas to settle in the area as their new home. After the World War II, the fast and vast production output of agriculture (specifically coconut &amp; coffee) and logging industry created a momentum of progress that led to the initiation of Gingoog’s early independence from the Province of Misamis Oriental.

In 1957, the sitio of Binuangan was converted into a barrio known as Talisay.

===Cityhood===

Gingoog was turned into a city via Republic Act No. 2668 signed by President Carlos P. Garcia circa June 18, 1960.

On October 19, 1978, Miguel Paderanga of Mahinog, Misamis Oriental (now part of Camiguin) was appointed by president Ferdinand Marcos as the new mayor of Gingoog City.

==Geography==
Gingoog is located in the Province of Misamis Oriental in the Northern Mindanao Region on Mindanao island. The city is approximately east of Cagayan de Oro and west of Butuan. It is bounded on the east by the Municipality of Magsaysay; on the west by the Municipality of Medina; on the south by the Municipality of Claveria; and on the north by Gingoog Bay. Its total land area is .

===Barangays===
Gingoog is politically subdivided into 79 barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks while some have sitios.

In 1957, the sitio of Malibod was converted into a barrio.

The 79 barangays are the following:

==Demographics==
The majority of Gingoog&#x27;s population speak Cebuano (spoken with Northern Mindanao variant), although the early inhabitants of the city are mostly Higaonons, who still inhabit the mountains to avoid contact with migrants from Cebu, Bohol, Siquijor and Negros Oriental who came to the area and occupied the coastal parts of the area long before Spanish presence in the area. There is also a sizeable speakers of Boholano dialect of Cebuano in Gingoog. Higaonon is also spoken by the city&#x27;s indigenous people of the same name who live in the mountains. Tagalog/Filipino and English are widely understood and often used for administrative functions by the local government and in education, with the former is also varyingly spoken with Batangas dialect due to ethnic Tagalog residents who came from Batangas in various numbers. Other languages also spoken varyingly in Gingoog are Bicolano, Ilocano, Hiligaynon, Kapampangan, Pangasinan, Waray, Butuanon, Surigaonon, as well as Maranao, Maguindanaon and Tausug.

== Economy ==
The city&#x27;s total income during year 2000 reached , of which 292,077.262.40 or 98.43% accrued in the general fund while or 1.5% accrued in the special education fund. Comparatively, the 1999 income level of million has increased by million or 18.39%. The biggest bulk of the city&#x27;s income was derived from tax revenues complementing around 95.5% of the total earnings of the year. One major component of this income class is the Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA) which contributed a total amount of million or 93.04%. Said IRA has increased by million or 16.83% against that of 1999. Local revenue contributed only 10.04% of the city&#x27;s total annual income.

Total expenditure incurred by the city for the whole year reached to about million, of which million was spent from the general fund and million was spent from the special education Fund. Comparatively, an increase of about million or 4.17% over 1999.

By expense class, personal services absorbed as much as million or 66.41%. That includes the services of the devolved employees, newly created positions as mandated by R.A. 7160 and project engaged workers. Maintenance and other operating expenses followed with million, or 18.62%, then capital outlay with million, or 14.97%.

<doc id="351656" wikidata="Q136736" url="?curid=351656" title="Geographic Names Information System">
<text>The Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) is a database of name and location information about more than two million physical and cultural features throughout the United States and its territories; as well as the associated states of the Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, and Palau; and Antarctica. It is a type of gazetteer. It was developed by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) in cooperation with the United States Board on Geographic Names (BGN) to promote the standardization of feature names.

Data were collected in two phases.
Although a third phase was considered, which would have handled name changes where local usages differed from maps, it was never begun.

The database is part of a system that includes topographic map names and bibliographic references. The names of books and historic maps that confirm the feature or place name are cited. Variant names, alternatives to official federal names for a feature, are also recorded. Each feature receives a permanent, unique feature record identifier, sometimes called the GNIS identifier. The database never removes an entry, &quot;except in cases of obvious duplication.&quot;

== Original purposes ==
The GNIS was originally designed for four major purposes: to eliminate duplication of effort at various other levels of government that were already compiling geographic data, to provide standardized datasets of geographic data for the government and others, to index all of the names found on official U.S. government federal and state maps, and to ensure uniform geographic names for the federal government.

== Phase 1 ==
Phase 1 lasted from 1978 to 1981, with a precursor pilot project run over the states of Kansas and Colorado in 1976, and produced 5 databases.
It excluded several classes of feature because they were better documented in non-USGS maps, including airports, the broadcasting masts for radio and television stations, civil divisions, regional and historic names, individual buildings, roads, and triangulation station names.

The databases were initially available on paper (2 to 3 spiral-bound volumes per state), on microfiche, and on magnetic tape encoded (unless otherwise requested) in EBCDIC with 248-byte fixed-length records in 4960-byte blocks.

The feature classes for association with each name included (for examples) &quot;locale&quot; (a &quot;place at which there is or was human activity&quot; not covered by a more specific feature class), &quot;populated place&quot; (a &quot;place or area with clustered or scattered buildings&quot;), &quot;spring&quot; (a spring), &quot;lava&quot; (a lava flow, kepula, or other such feature), and &quot;well&quot; (a well).
Mountain features would fall into &quot;ridge&quot;, &quot;range&quot;, or &quot;summit&quot; classes.

A feature class &quot;tank&quot; was sometimes used for lakes, which was problematic in several ways.
This feature class was undocumented, and it was (in the words of a 1986 report from the Engineer Topographic Laboratories of the United States Army Corps of Engineers) &quot;an unreasonable determination&quot;, with the likes of Cayuga Lake (in upstate New York) being labelled a &quot;tank&quot;.
The USACE report assumed that &quot;tank&quot; meant &quot;reservoir&quot;, and observed that often the coordinates of &quot;tanks&quot; were outside of their boundaries and were &quot;possibly at the point where a dam is thought to be&quot;.

=== National Geographic Names database ===
The National Geographic Names database (NGNDB hereafter) was originally 57 computer files, one for each state and territory of the United States (except Alaska which got two) plus one for the District of Columbia.
The second Alaska file was an earlier database, the Dictionary of Alaska Place Names that had been compiled by the USGS in 1967.
A further two files were later added, covering the entire United States and that were abridged versions of the data in the other 57: one for the 50,000 most well known populated places and features, and one for most of the populated places.
The files were compiled from all of the names to be found on USGS topographic maps, plus data from various state map sources.

In phase 1, elevations were recorded in feet only, with no conversion to metric, and only if there was an actual elevation recorded for the map feature.
They were of either the lowest or highest point of the feature, as appropriate.
Interpolated elevations, calculated by interpolation between contour lines, were added in phase 2.

Names were the official name, except where the name contained diacritic characters that the computer file encodings of the time could not handle (which were in phase 1 marked with an asterisk for update in a later phase).
Generic designations were given after specific names, so (for examples) Mount Saint Helens was recorded as &quot;Saint Helens, Mount&quot;, although cities named Mount Olive, not actually being mountains, would not take &quot;Mount&quot; to be a generic part and would retain their order &quot;Mount Olive&quot;.

The primary geographic coordinates of features which occupy an area, rather than being a single point feature, were the location of the feature&#x27;s mouth, or of the approximate center of the area of the feature.
Such approximate centers were &quot;eye-balled&quot; estimates by the people performing the digitization, subject to the constraint that centers of areal features were not placed within other features that are inside them.
alluvial fans and river deltas counted as mouths for this purpose. For cities and other large populated places, the coordinates were taken to be those of a primary civic feature such as the city hall or town hall, main public library, main highway intersection, main post office, or central business district regardless of changes over time; these coordinates are called the &quot;primary point&quot;.

Secondary coordinates were only an aid to locating which topographic map(s) the feature extended across, and were &quot;simply anywhere on the feature and on the topographic map with which it is associated&quot;.
River sources were determined by the shortest drain, subject to the proximities of other features that were clearly related to the river by their names.

=== USGS Topographic Map Names database ===
The USGS Topographic Map Names database (TMNDB hereafter) was also 57 computer files containing the names of maps: 56 for 1:24000 scale USGS maps as with the NGNDB, the 57th being (rather than a second Alaska file) data from the 1:100000 and 1:250000 scale USGS maps.
Map names were recorded exactly as on the maps themselves, with the exceptions for diacritics as with the NGNDB.

Unlike the NGNDB, locations were the geographic coördinates of the south-east corner of the given map, except for American Samoa and Guam maps where they were of the north-east cornder.

The TMNDB was later renamed the Geographic Cell Names database (GCNDB hereafter) in the 1990s.

=== Generic database ===
The Generic database was in essence a machine-readable glossary of terms and abbreviations taken from the map sources, with their definitions, grouped into collections of related terms.

=== National Atlas database ===
The National Atlas database was an abridged version of the NGNDB that contained only those entries that were in the index to the USGS National Atlas of the United States, with the coördinates published in the latter substituted for the coördinates from the former.

=== Board on Geographic Names database ===
The Board on Geographic Names database was a record of investigative work of the USGS Board on Geographic Names&#x27; Domestic Names Committee, and decisions that it had made from 1890 onwards, as well as names that were enshrined by Acts of Congress.
Elevation and location data followed the same rules as for the NGNDB.
So too did names with diacritic characters.

== Phase 2 ==
Phase 2 was broader in scope than phase 1, extending the scope to a much larger set of data sources.
It ran from the end of phase 1 and had managed to completely process data from 42 states by 2003, with 4 still underway and the remaining 4 (Alaska, Kentucky, Michigan, and New York) awaiting the initial systematic compilation of the sources to use.

Many more feature classes were included, including abandoned Native American settlements, ghost towns, railway stations on railway lines that no longer existed, housing developments, shopping centers, and highway rest areas.

The actual compilation was outsourced by the U.S. government, state by state, to private entities such as university researchers.

=== Antarctica Geographic Names database ===
The Antarctica Geographic Names database (AGNDB hereafter) was added in the 1990s and comprised records for BGN-approved names in Antarctica and various off-lying islands such as the South Orkney Islands, the South Shetland Islands, the Balleny Islands, Heard Island, South Georgia, and the South Sandwich Islands.
It only contained records for natural features, not for scientific outposts.

=== Additional media ===
The media on which one could obtain the databases were extended in the 1990s (still including tape and paper) to floppy disc, over FTP, and on CD-ROM.
The CD-ROM edition only included the NGNDB, the AGNDB, the GCNDB, and a bibliographic reference database (RDB); but came with database search software that ran on PC DOS (or compatible) version 3.0 or later.
The FTP site included extra topical databases: a subset of the NGNDB that only included the records with feature classes for populated places, a &quot;Concise&quot; subset of the NGNDB that listed &quot;major features&quot;, and a &quot;Historical&quot; subset that included the features that no longer exist.

== Populated places ==
There is no differentiation amongst different types of populated places.
In the words of the aforementioned 1986 USACE report, &quot;[a] subdivision having one inhabitant is as significant as a major metropolitan center such as New York City&quot;.

In comparing GNIS populated place records with data from the Thematic Mapper of the Landsat program, researchers from the University of Connecticut in 2001 discovered that &quot;a significant number&quot; of populated places in Connecticut had no identifiable human settlement in the land use data and were at road intersections.
They found that such populated places with no actual settlement often had &quot;Corner&quot; in their names, and hypothesized that either these were historical records or were &quot;cartographic locators&quot;.
In surveying in the United States, a &quot;Corner&quot; is a corner of the surveyed polygon enclosing an area of land, whose location is, or was (since corners can become &quot;lost&quot; or &quot;obliterated&quot;), marked in various ways including with trees known as &quot;bearing trees&quot; (&quot;witness trees&quot; in older terminology) or &quot;corner monuments&quot;.

From analysing Native American names in the database in order to compile a dictionary, professor William Bright of UCLA observed in 2004 that some GNIS entries are &quot;erroneous; or refer to long-vanished railroad sidings where no one ever lived&quot;. Such false classifications have propagated to other geographical information sources, such as incorrectly classified train stations appearing as towns or neighborhoods on Google Maps.

==Name changes==
The usual sources of name change requests are an individual state&#x27;s board on geographic names, or a county board of governors.
This does not always succeed, the State Library of Montana having submitted three large sets of name changes that have not been incorporated into the GNIS database.

Name changes may also be made by the President of the United States via an executive order, as was the case with Executive Order 14172 &#x27;Gulf of Mexico&#x27; being renamed to &#x27;Gulf of America&#x27; in 2025.

Conversely, a group of middle school students in Alaska succeeded, with the help of their teachers, a professor of linguistics, and a man who had been conducting a years-long project to collect Native American placenames in the area, in changing the names of several places that they had spotted in class one day and challenged for being racist, including renaming &quot;Negrohead Creek&quot; to an Athabascan name Lochenyatth Creek and &quot;Negrohead Mountain&quot; to Tl&#x27;oo Khanishyah Mountain, both of which translate to &quot;grassy tussocks&quot; in Lower Tanana and Gwichʼin respectively.
Likewise, in researching a 2008 book on ethnic slurs in U.S. placenames Mark Monmonier of Syracuse University discovered &quot;Niger Hill&quot; in Potter County, Pennsylvania, an erroneous transcription of &quot;Nigger Hill&quot; from a 1938 map, and persuaded the USBGN to change it to &quot;Negro Hill&quot;.

=== Removal of racial and ethnic slurs ===
In November 2021, the United States Secretary of the Interior issued an order instructing that &quot;Squaw&quot; be removed from usage by the U.S. federal government.
Prior efforts had included a 1962 replacement of the &quot;Nigger&quot; racial pejorative for African Americans with &quot;Negro&quot; and a 1974 replacement of the &quot;Jap&quot; racial pejorative for Japanese Americans with &quot;Japanese&quot;.

In 2015, a cross-reference of the GNIS database against the Racial Slur Database had found 1441 racial slur placenames, every state of the United States having them, with California having 159 and the state with the most such names being Arizona.
One of the two standard reference works for placenames in Arizona is Byrd Howell Granger&#x27;s 1983 book &quot;Arizona&#x27;s Names: X Marks the Place&quot;, which contains many additional names with racial slurs not in the GNIS database.
Despite &quot;Nigger&quot; having been removed from federal government use by Stewart Udall, its replacement &quot;Negro&quot; still remained in GNIS names in 2015, as did &quot;Pickaninny&quot;, &quot;Uncle Tom&quot;, and &quot;Jim Crow&quot; and 33 places named &quot;Niggerhead&quot;.
There were 828 names containing &quot;squaw&quot;, including 11 variations on &quot;Squaw Tit&quot; and &quot;Squaw Teat&quot;, contrasting with the use of &quot;Nipple&quot; in names with non-Native American allusions such as &quot;Susies Nipple&quot;.

<doc id="351657" wikidata="Q475971" url="?curid=351657" title="Putney Bridge">
<text>Putney Bridge is a Grade II listed bridge over the River Thames in west London, linking Putney on the south side with Fulham to the north. Before the first bridge was built in 1729, a ferry had shuttled between the two banks. 

The current format is three lanes southbound (including one bus lane) and one lane (plus cycle lane/bus stop) northbound. Putney High Street, a main approach, is part of a London hub for retail, offices, food, drink and entertainment. Putney Embankment hosts Putney Pier for riverboat services immediately south-west of the bridge as well as the capital&#x27;s largest set of facilities in rowing. The Pier in the sport marks one end of the Championship Course.

==Position==
The north side of the bridge is 120m west-southwest of Putney Bridge Underground station, which is in the park-sandwiched Hurlingham neighbourhood of Fulham. Parkland to the west includes the gardens of Fulham Palace, historic home of the Bishops of London. On the south side of the bridge is a rounded glass-prowed ship-shaped 21st-century building, Putney Wharf Tower, one of the tallest buildings in Putney.

The bridge has medieval parish churches beside its abutments: St Mary&#x27;s Church, Putney is built on the south and All Saints Church, Fulham, on the north bank. This close proximity of two churches by a major river is rare, another example being at Goring-on-Thames and Streatley, villages hemmed in by the Chiltern Hills (the Goring Gap). 

==History==

===First bridges===
The first bridge of any kind between the two parishes of Fulham and Putney was built during the Civil War: after the Battle of Brentford in 1642, the Parliamentary forces built a bridge of boats between Fulham and Putney. According to an account from the period:The Lord-Generall hath caused a bridge to be built upon barges and lighters over the Thames, between Fulham and Putney, to convey his army and artillery over into Surry, to follow the King&#x27;s forces; and he hath ordered that forts shall be erected at each end thereof to guard it; but for the present the seamen, with long boats and shallops, full of ordnance and musketeers, lie there upon the river to secure it.

In 1720 Sir Robert Walpole (the following year considered the first Prime Minister) was returning from seeing George I at Kingston on Thames and being in a hurry to get to the House of Commons rode together with his servant to Putney to take the ferry across to Fulham. However, the ferrymen were drinking in The Swan Inn. The calls of Sir Robert and his servant went unanswered. Walpole, who was left to take a longer route to Parliament, seemed to be motivated by the experience to have a bridge built across the Thames between Fulham and Putney. 


The legal framework for construction of a bridge was approved by an Act of Parliament (the Fulham and Putney Bridge Act) in 1726. Built by local master carpenter Thomas Phillips to a design by Royal Navy Surveyor Sir Jacob Ackworth, the first bridge was opened on 29 November 1729. In its first guise, from 1729 to 1886 it was slightly downriver to the north, and in many official records was also known as Fulham Bridge. It was the only bridge between London Bridge and Kingston Bridge at the time. It was a toll bridge with tollbooths at either end of the timber-built structure.

In October 1795, Mary Wollstonecraft, philosopher and early women&#x27;s equality advocate, allegedly planned to commit suicide by jumping from the bridge, because she had returned from a trip to Sweden to discover that her lover was involved with an actress from London.

The bridge was the starting point for The Boat Race from 1845 until the new iron aqueduct was built just upstream in 1856, after which this became the starting point. The competitors are currently 32 male rowers, plus a cox for each eight, representing the universities of Oxford and Cambridge with two crews of first and second eights. Women&#x27;s eights competed in an equivalent race for the first time in 2015, having since 1927 competed a shorter varsity race in Henley also in the early spring.

The bridge was badly damaged by the collision of a river barge in 1870. Although part of the bridge was subsequently replaced, the entire bridge was then demolished to make way for construction of the current bridge. The iron aqueduct was also demolished as the new bridge carried the water in pipes beneath the road surface.

===Current bridge===

The Metropolitan Board of Works purchased the bridge in 1879, discontinued the tolls in 1880, and set about its replacement. 

In 1886 construction of the stone bridge that stands today, on a new alignment, was completed. A new road – Putney Bridge Approach – was laid to connect the northern end of the new bridge with Fulham High Street at its junction with New King&#x27;s Road; in consequence the southernmost stretch of Fulham High Street was reduced to a cul-de-sac. The bridge was designed by civil engineer Sir Joseph Bazalgette as a five-span structure, built of stone and Cornish granite. Bazalgette also designed London&#x27;s sewerage system, and the bridge integrates two of his five outfall sewers running perpendicular to it. It was constructed by John Waddell of Edinburgh, whose tender of £240,433 () was accepted on 15 April 1882. It is and , and was opened by the Prince (later King Edward VII) and Princess of Wales on 29 May 1886. In 1933, the bridge was widened to its present three carriageways. Putney Bridge Approach was widened in consequence, further encroaching on the churchyard of All Saints Church, Fulham.

The stone marking the downstream end of the Championship Course is used for all boat races through Putney in Olympic-class rowing boats. These include the Wingfield Sculls and the UK&#x27;s main Head of the River Races, just west of the bridge, rather than at the bridge itself, under which the centre of its middle arch would provide an advantage if starting underneath it, as all races are competed with the tide.

In 2007, the bridge suffered considerable damage by a developer who cut several holes into the Cornish granite of the southern approach of the bridge.

On 14 July 2014, Putney Bridge closed for three months, except to pedestrians and dismounted cyclists, to undergo &quot;essential repairs&quot; by Wandsworth Council &quot;to better protect the bridge from damage caused by water penetration, which has contributed to the poor road surface&quot;. The bridge reopened on 26 September that year.

On 5 May 2017 an unidentified jogger on the bridge pushed over a woman, where an approaching bus narrowly avoided hitting her. Irish playwright Sonya Kelly wrote a play, &quot;Once Upon a Bridge&quot;, inspired by the incident which was produced by Druid Theatre in 2021.

<text>The Potawatomi (), also spelled Pottawatomi and Pottawatomie (among many variations), are an Indigenous North American people of the Great Plains, upper Mississippi River, and western Great Lakes region. They traditionally speak the Potawatomi language, a member of the Algonquian family. The Potawatomi call themselves Neshnabé, a cognate of the word &quot;Anishinaabe&quot;. The Potawatomi are part of a long-term alliance, called the Council of Three Fires, with the Ojibwe and Odawa (Ottawa). In the Council of Three Fires, the Potawatomi are considered the &quot;youngest brother&quot;. Their people are referred to in this context as Bodéwadmi, a name that means &quot;keepers of the fire&quot; and refers to the council fire of three peoples.

In the 19th century, some bands of Potawatomi were pushed to the west by European/American encroachment. In the 1830s the federal government removed most from their lands east of the Mississippi River to Indian Territory - first in Kansas, Nebraska, and last to Oklahoma. Some bands survived in the Great Lakes region and today are federally recognized as tribes, in addition to the Potawatomi in Oklahoma.

==Name==
The English &quot;Potawatomi&quot; is derived from the Ojibwe (syncoped in the Ottawa as ). The Potawatomi name for themselves (autonym) is (without syncope: ; plural: ), a cognate of the Ojibwe form. Their name means &quot;those who tend the hearth-fire,&quot; which refers to the hearth of the Council of Three Fires. The word comes from &quot;to tend the hearth-fire,&quot; which is (without syncope: ) in the Potawatomi language; the Ojibwe and Ottawa forms are and , respectively.

Alternatively, the Potawatomi call themselves (without syncope: ; plural: ), a cognate of Ojibwe , meaning &quot;original people.&quot;

==Teachings==
The Potawatomi teach their children about the &quot;Seven Grandfather Teachings&quot; of wisdom, respect, love, honesty, humility, bravery, and truth toward each other and all creation. Each principle teaches the equality and importance of their fellow tribesmen and respect for all of nature&#x27;s creations. 

The story that underlies these teaches the importance of patience and listening. It follows the Water Spider&#x27;s journey to retrieve fire so that the other animals can survive the cold. As the other animals step forth one after another to proclaim that they shall be the ones to retrieve the fire, the Water Spider sits and waits while listening to her fellows. As they finish and wrestle with their fears, she steps forward and announces that she will be the one to bring fire back. As they laugh and doubt her, she weaves a bowl out of her web, using it to sail across the water to retrieve the fire. She brings back a hot coal out of which the animals make fire, and they celebrate her honor and bravery.

==History==
The Potawatomi are first mentioned in French records, which suggest that in the early 17th century, they lived in what is now southwestern Michigan. During the Beaver Wars they fled to the area around Green Bay to escape attacks by both the Iroquois and the Neutral Confederacy, who were seeking expanded hunting grounds. It is estimated that the Potawatomi numbered around 3,000 in 1658.

As an important part of Tecumseh&#x27;s Confederacy, Potawatomi warriors took part in Tecumseh&#x27;s War and the War of 1812. Their alliances switched repeatedly between United Kingdom and the United States as power relations shifted between the nations, and they calculated effects on their trade and land interests.

At the time of the War of 1812, a band of Potawatomi inhabited the area near Fort Dearborn, where Chicago developed. Led by the chiefs Blackbird and Nuscotomeg (Mad Sturgeon), a force of about 500 warriors attacked the United States evacuation column leaving Fort Dearborn. They killed most of the civilians and 54 of Captain Nathan Heald&#x27;s force, and wounded many others. George Ronan, the first graduate of West Point to be killed in combat, died in this ambush. The incident is referred to as the Battle of Fort Dearborn. A Potawatomi chief named Mucktypoke (, Black Partridge), counseled his fellow warriors against the attack. Later he saved some of the civilian captives who were being ransomed by the Potawatomi.

===French period (1615–1763)===
The French period of contact began with early explorers who reached the Potawatomi in western Michigan. They also found the tribe located along the Door Peninsula of Wisconsin. By the end of the French period, the Potawatomi had begun a move to the Detroit area, leaving the large communities in Wisconsin.
* Madouche during the Fox Wars
* Millouisillyny
* Onanghisse (&quot;Wnaneg-gizs&quot; &quot;Shimmering Light&quot;) at Green Bay
* Otchik at Detroit

===British period (1763–1783)===
The British period of contact began when France ceded its lands after its defeat by Britain in the French and Indian War (the North American front of the Seven Years&#x27; War). Pontiac&#x27;s Rebellion was an attempt by Native Americans to push the British and other European settlers out of their territory. The Potawatomi captured every British frontier garrison but the one at Detroit.

The Potawatomi nation continued to grow and expanded westward from Detroit, most notably in the development of the St. Joseph villages adjacent to the Miami in southwestern Michigan. The Wisconsin communities continued and moved south along the Lake Michigan shoreline.
* Nanaquiba (Water Moccasin) at Detroit
* Ninivois at Detroit
* Peshibon at St. Joseph
* Washee (from , &quot;the Swan&quot;) at St. Joseph during Pontiac&#x27;s Rebellion

===United States treaty period (1783–1830)===
The United States treaty period of Potawatomi history began with the Treaty of Paris, which ended the American Revolutionary War and established the United States&#x27; interest in the lower Great Lakes. It lasted until the treaties for Indian removal were signed. The US recognized the Potawatomi as a single tribe. They often had a few tribal leaders whom all villages accepted. The Potawatomi had a decentralized society, with several main divisions based on geographic locations: Milwaukee or Wisconsin area, Detroit or Huron River, the St. Joseph River, the Kankakee River, Tippecanoe and Wabash Rivers, the Illinois River and Lake Peoria, and the Des Plaines and Fox Rivers.

===American removal period (1830–1840)===
The removal period of Potawatomi history began with the treaties of the late 1820s, when the United States created reservations. Billy Caldwell and Alexander Robinson negotiated for the United Nations of Chippewa, Ottawa and Potowatomi in the Second Treaty of Prairie du Chien (1829), by which they ceded most of their lands in Wisconsin and Michigan. Some Potawatomi became religious followers of the &quot;Kickapoo Prophet&quot;, Kennekuk. Over the years, the US reduced the size of the reservations under pressure for land by incoming European Americans. 

The final step followed the Treaty of Chicago, negotiated in 1833 for the tribes by Caldwell and Robinson. In return for land cessions, the US promised new lands, annuities and supplies to enable the peoples to develop new homes. The Illinois Potawatomi were removed to Nebraska and the Indiana Potawatomi to Kansas, both west of the Mississippi River. Often annuities and supplies were reduced, or late in arrival, and the Potawatomi suffered after their relocations. Those in Kansas were later removed to Indian Territory (now Oklahoma). The removal of the Indiana Potawatomi was documented by a Catholic priest, Benjamin Petit, who accompanied the Indians on the Potawatomi Trail of Death in 1838. Petit died while returning to Indiana in 1839. His diary was published in 1941, over 100 years after his death, by the Indiana Historical Society.

Many Potawatomi found ways to remain, primarily those in Michigan. Others fled to their Odawa neighbors or to Canada to avoid removal to the west.

==Ethnobotany==
They regard &quot;Epigaea repens&quot; as their tribal flower and consider it to have come directly from their divinity. &quot;Allium tricoccum &quot; is consumed in traditional Potawatomi cuisine. They mix an infusion of the root of &quot;Uvularia grandiflora &quot; with lard and use it as salve to massage sore muscles and tendons. They use &quot;Symphyotrichum novae-angliae&quot; as a fumigating reviver. &quot;Vaccinium myrtilloides&quot; is part of their traditional cuisine, and is eaten fresh, dried, and canned. They also use the root bark of the plant for an unspecified ailment.

==Location==
The Potawatomi first lived in Lower Michigan, then moved to northern Wisconsin and eventually settled into northern Indiana and central Illinois. In the early 19th century, major portions of Potawatomi lands were seized by the US government. Following the Treaty of Chicago in 1833, by which the tribe ceded its lands in Illinois, most of the Potawatomi people were removed to Indian Territory, west of the Mississippi River. Many perished en route to new lands in the west on their journey through Iowa, Kansas, and Indian Territory, following what became known as the &quot;Trail of Death&quot;.

==Language==
Potawatomi (also spelled Pottawatomie; in Potawatomi &quot;Bodéwadmimwen&quot; or &quot;Bodéwadmi Zheshmowen&quot; or &quot;Neshnabémwen&quot;) is a Central Algonquian language and is spoken around the Great Lakes in Michigan and Wisconsin. It is also spoken by Potawatomi in Kansas, Oklahoma, and in southern Ontario. As of 2001, there were fewer than 1,300 people who speak Potawatomi as a first language, most of them elderly. The people are working to revitalize the language, as evidenced by recent efforts such as the online Potawatomi language Dictionary created by the Citizen Potawatomi Nation or the various resources available through the Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians.

The Potawatomi language is most similar to the Odawa language; it also has borrowed a considerable amount of vocabulary from Sauk. Like the Odawa language, or the Ottawa dialect of the Anishinaabe language, the Potawatomi language exhibits a great amount of vowel syncope.

Many places in the Midwest have names derived from the Potawatomi language, including Waukegan, Muskegon, Oconomowoc, Pottawattamie County, Kalamazoo, and Skokie.

<text>The year 1915 involved numerous significant events in science and technology, some of which are listed below.

==Astronomy==
* January – British physicist Sir Joseph Larmor publishes his observations on &quot;The Influence of Local Atmospheric Cooling on Astronomical Refraction&quot;.
* March 19 – Pluto is photographed for the first time but is not classified as a planet.
* Einstein&#x27;s new theory of general relativity is used to explain Mercury&#x27;s strange motions that baffled Urbain Le Verrier.
* Robert Innes discovers Proxima Centauri, the closest star to Earth after the Sun.

==Chemistry==

* Thomas Lyle Williams produces the mascara Maybelline.

==Earth sciences==
* May 22 – Lassen Peak, one of the Cascade Volcanoes in Northern California, erupts, sending an ash plume 30,000 feet in the air and devastating the nearby area with pyroclastic flows and lahars. It is the only volcano to erupt in the contiguous United States between 1900 and 1980.
* Alfred Wegener publishes his theory of Pangea, which he calls &quot;Urkontinent&quot;.

== Paleontology ==
* The new theropod dinosaur genus and species &quot;Spinosaurus aegyptiacus&quot; is assigned by German paleontologist Ernst Stromer.

==Life sciences==
* January – Mildred Hoge publishes her discovery of the gene (much later identified as PAX6) responsible for development of the eye.
* A global pandemic of encephalitis lethargica begins.
* Trench nephritis is first reported as affecting soldiers of the British Expeditionary Force in Flanders in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot;; the name is coined by Nathan Raw.
* Walter Bradford Cannon coins the term &quot;fight or flight&quot; to describe an animal&#x27;s response to threats.
* Thomas Hunt Morgan, demonstrates non-inherited genetic mutation (in &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;), undermining the conceptual basis of eugenics.
* Reginald Punnett&#x27;s &quot;Mimicry in Butterflies&quot; is published in Cambridge (U.K.)
* Clara H. Hasse publishes a paper identifying the cause of citrus canker which leads to the development of methods for controlling the disease, saving the citrus crops in the southern United States from being wiped out.

==Mathematics==
* Emmy Noether proves her theorem that any differentiable symmetry of the action of a physical system has a corresponding conservation law.
* Wacław Sierpiński describes the Sierpinski triangle.

==Physics==
* August – Ada Hitchins&#x27; experimental results indicating that radium is formed by the decay of uranium are published.
* November 25 – Albert Einstein presents to the Prussian Academy of Sciences the Einstein field equations of general relativity. He abandons his hole argument for general relativity.
* Arnold Sommerfeld develops a modified Bohr atomic model with elliptic orbits to explain relativistic fine structure.

<doc id="351700" wikidata="Q1278811" url="?curid=351700" title="2003 Croatian parliamentary election">
<text>Parliamentary elections were held in Croatia on 23 November 2003 to elect all 151 members of parliament. They were the fifth parliamentary elections to take place since the first multi-party elections in 1990. Voter turnout was 61.7%. The result was a victory for the opposition Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) which won a plurality of 66 seats, but fell short of the 76 needed to form a government. HDZ chairman Ivo Sanader was named the eighth Prime Minister of Croatia on 23 December 2003, after parliament passed a confidence motion in his government cabinet, with 88 MPs voting in favor, 29 against and 14 abstaining. The ruling coalition going into the elections, consisting of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Croatian People&#x27;s Party (HNS), Croatian Peasant Party (HSS), Party of Liberal Democrats (Libra) and the Liberal Party (LS), did not contest the elections as a single bloc; the SDP ran with the Istrian Democratic Assembly (IDS), the Party of Liberal Democrats (Libra) and the Liberal Party, HNS ran with the Alliance of Primorje-Gorski Kotar (PGS) and the Slavonia-Baranja Croatian Party (SBHS), while HSS ran on its own.

==General information==
There are 10 electoral units based on geography and population. In each unit, 14 candidates are elected on proportional electoral system. The election threshold is 5%.

In addition, 8 candidates are elected to represent national minorities.

The citizens that live outside Croatian borders vote in a separate electoral unit. The number of representatives elected from this unit will be determined after the elections, based on how many people actually vote in Croatia, so that there is equal value of votes both inside and outside Croatia.
For reference, the number of diaspora seats in the 2000-2003 Sabor was six.

Total: 140 domestic seats + 8 minority seats + 4 diaspora seats.

Distribution of minority seats:
* Serbs: 3
* Hungarians: 1
* Italians: 1
* Czechs and Slovaks: 1
* Austrians, Bulgarians, Germans, Poles, Romani, Romanians, Rusyns, Russians, Turks, Ukrainians, Vlachs and Jews: 1
* Albanians, Bosniaks, Montenegrins, Macedonians, Slovenes: 1

==Parties and coalitions==
Pre-election coalitions:
* DC and HSLS, in all electoral units
* SDP and IDS, in the 8th electoral unit (the county of Istria et al.)
* HB and HIP, in all electoral units
* SDP and Libra in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 10th electoral unit
* SDP and LS, in the 4th and 6th electoral unit
* HNS and SBHS, in the 4th and 5th electoral unit (counties of Slavonia)
* HNS and PGS, in the 7th and 8th electoral unit (Northern seacoast counties)

==Opinion polls==
==Results==
The number of diaspora mandates was reduced by two compared to previous elections due to somewhat lower diaspora turnout. Due to distribution according to the d&#x27;Hondt method, the independent lists for diaspora were not allocated seats even if they received more than 5% of the total votes.

===Minority seats===
National minorities elected 8 representatives through a separate election system: Vojislav Stanimirović (22,2% of votes), Milorad Pupovac (21,7%) and Ratko Gajica (13,8%) for the Serb national minority, Jene Adam (42%) for the Hungarian minority, Furio Radin (79,8%) for the Italian minority, Zdenka Čuhnil (39,2%) for the Czech and Slovak minorities, Nikola Mak (14,3%) for the Austrian, Bulgarian, German, Jewish, Polish, Roma, Romanian, Rusyn, Russian, Turkish, Ukrainian, Vlach minorities and Šemso Tanković (59,1%) for the Albanian, Bosniak, Macedonian, Montenegrin and Slovene minorities.

==Aftermath==
Ivo Sanader of the Croatian Democratic Union was appointed as prime minister by the President and confirmed by the Croatian Parliament.

The new government was formed of 13 HDZ ministers and one from the Democratic Centre.

<doc id="351706" wikidata="Q450526" url="?curid=351706" title="Blake Hall tube station">
<text>Blake Hall is a disused former station on the London Underground in the civil parish of Stanford Rivers, and south from the village of Bobbingworth in Essex. It was latterly on the Central line, between North Weald and Ongar, but was originally served by the Epping to Ongar shuttle service branch line.

It was opened in 1865 and named after Blake Hall, a country house located a mile or so to the northeast and inhabited by the Capel-Cure family of substantial local land-owners. The station was closed in 1981.

==History==
Blake Hall station was opened by the Great Eastern Railway on 24 April 1865, serving principally as a goods yard carrying agricultural produce from the nearby farms into London. Steam locomotives operated by British Railways for the Underground ran a shuttle service from Epping to Ongar, stopping at Blake Hall, from 1949 until 1957, when the line was electrified and taken over by the Underground&#x27;s Central line. On 18 April 1966 the goods yard was closed and Blake Hall became a dedicated passenger station. On 17 October 1966, Sunday services were withdrawn.

Blake Hall became reputed as the least-used station on the entire Underground network . Fare subsidies provided on the rest of the system were not provided on this part of the line because local government agencies for Essex and London failed to agree on their respective public transport responsibilities, and Blake Hall station was located a considerable distance from any substantial settlement. By the time the last train ran on 31 October 1981, the station was reported to have only 17 passengers per day. It was permanently closed on 2 November 1981. The Epping to Ongar branch line was closed 13 years later, on 30 September 1994.

Blake Hall&#x27;s station building has since been converted into a private home and the line passing the station site is now privately owned and operated as a heritage railway by the Epping Ongar Railway. The platform was demolished after closure and reinstated in May 2012 but this is for aesthetic purposes only, and the station remains closed. Additionally, the rebuilt platforms are much shorter in length than they originally were.

<doc id="351708" wikidata="Q986049" url="?curid=351708" title="Harwell, Oxfordshire">
<text>Harwell is a village and civil parish in the Vale of White Horse about west of Didcot, east of Wantage and south of Oxford, England. The parish measures about north – south, and almost east – west at its widest point. In 1923, its area was . Historically in Berkshire, it has been administered as part of Oxfordshire since the 1974 boundary changes. The parish includes part of Harwell Science and Innovation Campus in the southwest. The 2011 census recorded the parish&#x27;s population as 2,349.

==Toponymy==
The earliest known surviving records of Harwell&#x27;s name are 10th-century Saxon charters now reproduced in the &quot;Cartularium Saxonicum&quot;. One from 956 records Horn Down, a nearby hill, as &quot;Harandúne&quot;, which is derived from the Old English for &quot;grey hill&quot;. The same charter records the manor as &quot;Haranwylle&quot;, which comes from the Old English for &quot;stream by or coming from Horn Hill&quot;. A slightly later charter, from 973, records the manor as &quot;Harawille&quot;. The Domesday Book of 1086 records the manor as &quot;Harwelle&quot;. Another 11th-century source records it as &quot;Harowell&quot;. One 13th-century document records it as &quot;Arewell&quot;. Other 13th- and 14th-century sources record it as &quot;Harewell&quot;.

==Parish church==
The Church of England parish church of Saint Matthew may date from the 11th century. In 1962, &quot;The Times&quot; reported that walling had been found west of the tower indicating where a former nave had been. The herringbone layering of the masonry suggested that an 11th-century date is likely. At the same time a pewter chalice from about 1200 was found. The present nave, east of the tower, was built in about 1200. This second nave has north and south aisles with three-bay arcades. The west tower may have been at the same time, but its Early English Gothic bell openings suggest that it may not have been finished until the middle of the 13th century. The Decorated Gothic chancel is early 14th century and has a five-light east window. The rood screen is probably of the same date, but the screen&#x27;s Perpendicular Gothic top is later.

The tower has a ring of eight bells. Joseph Carter, who was Master bellfounder at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry and also had a foundry at Reading, cast the fourth bell in 1590 and the seventh bell in 1597. William Yare of Reading cast the third and fifth bells in 1611 and the sixth and tenor bells in 1612. John Taylor &amp; Co of Loughborough cast the treble and second bells in 1932, completing the present ring. St. Matthew&#x27;s also has a Sanctus bell cast by Robert I Wells of Aldbourne, Wiltshire in the 18th century. There is a single-handed clock on the tower&#x27;s west face. In 1975, a two-storey extension was built on the north wall which now includes a parish office. A new church hall was built in 1994. St Matthew&#x27;s parish now shares a rector with the parish of All Saints, Chilton.
==Economic and social history==

Harwell contains two 13th-century houses, each of which is a Grade II* listed building. Lime Tree Cottage in the High Street was built about 1250 and remodelled about 1300. A cross-wing was added about 1360 and the house was given a new front about 1700. Gable Cottage and Tibbleton Cottage in Wellshead Lane were originally one timber-framed house, built in about 1295 and extended with a new front range in the 17th century. Bayllols Manor house at Middle Farm is a timber-framed 14th-century hall house, and its service wing may be the remains of a 13th-century building. In 1589, an upper floor was inserted in the 14th-century hall and some pargeting was applied. The farm has two 14th-century barns, each of which is Grade II* listed. One is the Cherry Barn, which was built about 1350 and has 15th- and 17th-century outbuildings. The other was built around 1365 and has a cruck frame.

The White Hart in the High Street is an early 17th-century timber-framed building with early 18th- and mid-19th century brick-built extensions. It now trades as the Hart of Harwell pub and restaurant. Harwell once had five pubs and a brewery. The former brewery is a 17th-century building in the High Street with an 18th-century malt house and 19th-century extension. It is now a private house. The Crown in the High Street was converted into a nursing home, which was run by Southern Cross Healthcare and ceased trading in 2012. The Chequers, The Crispin and The Kicking Donkey have all been converted to private houses. On 4 April 1899, Berkshire Constabulary PC John Charlton was killed in an affray outside the Chequers. His two killers were felled and arrested by another officer, PC Thomas Hewett and later sentenced to 20 years hard labour for manslaughter. Until the Second World War Harwell may have been best known for its cherry orchards.

Geering Almshouses are a row of brick-built almshouses built by a charity established in 1715 but the houses themselves may not have been built until about 1723. The almshouses are a Grade II* listed building. The Great Western Main Line was built through the north of the parish and opened in 1840. Originally the nearest station was , about northwest of Harwell, which the Great Western opened in 1840. In 1844, the GWR opened Didcot railway station about northeast of Harwell. In 1964, British Railways closed Steventon station, making Didcot (now ) Harwell&#x27;s nearest rail link.

The parish boundary has been altered a number of times. On 1 April 2015, the portion north of the railway line, which included part of the Milton Park estate and part of the Didcot Power Station site, was transferred to Sutton Courtenay. In April 2023, the portion east of the A34 road and north of the A417, which included part of the Great Western Park housing development, was split off to create a new parish, Western Valley.

==Airfield and Atomic Energy Research Establishment==

RAF Harwell was built in 1937. It spans the parish boundaries between Harwell, Chilton and East Hendred. The airfield was used in World War II to launch troop-carrying military gliders for the invasion of Normandy. In 1946, the airfield was taken over to be the new Atomic Energy Research Establishment, the main centre for nuclear power research in the UK, and become Harwell Laboratory. It was the site of Europe&#x27;s first nuclear reactor in 1946, and once had five nuclear reactors, all of which have been shut down. Two have been completely dismantled, and the other three will be decommissioned by 2022.

Other parts of the airfield were later used by other scientific organisations, including the Science and Technology Facilities Council&#x27;s Rutherford Appleton Laboratory which runs the ISIS neutron source and hosts the Diamond Light Source synchrotron joint venture. Part of the Atomic Energy Research Establishment is now operated by Research Sites Restoration Limited which is undertaking decommissioning work on behalf of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority. The former airfield site as a whole is now the Harwell Science and Innovation Campus and is managed by the Australian-based Goodman property group.

==Amenities==

Harwell&#x27;s remaining public house, The Hart of Harwell, is at the junction of the High Street and Burr Street. The village has two shops: a butcher and a combined newsagent and off licence. The village has clubs and societies including The Harwellian Club, a Scout troop, a tennis club, a horticultural society, Harwell Feast Committee, Harwell Rugby Club, football clubs, and others. Harwell Feast is a celebration held on the Monday of the Late May Bank Holiday each year. The celebrations include a parade of decorated floats and people through the village. The recreation ground hosts fund-raising stalls and displays including sheepdog handling and historic cars. Either a cow or two pigs are roasted for the feast.

===Buses===
Several Thames Travel bus routes serve Harwell. Route 23 links the Great Western Park housing estate with Henley-on-Thames via Milton Park, Didcot and Wallingford, on Mondays to Fridays only. Route 98 links Harwell village and campus with Didcot via the Great Western Park housing estate. Route 99 links Great Western Park with the Milton Park business estate from Mondays to Fridays. It has no Saturday or Sunday service. Route X32 links Harwell village and campus with Didcot, Milton Park, and Oxford daily, and from Mondays to Saturdays also serves Wantage. Route 34 is a limited service between Wantage, Harwell campus and Oxford that runs from Mondays to Fridays only.

<doc id="351709" wikidata="Q4058973" url="?curid=351709" title="William Henry Ireland">
<text>William Henry Ireland (1775–1835) was an English forger of would-be Shakespearean documents and plays. He is less well known as a poet, writer of gothic novels and histories. Although he was apparently christened William-Henry, he was known as Samuel through much of his life (apparently after a brother who died in childhood), and many sources list his name as Samuel William Henry Ireland.

==Early life==
Although Ireland claimed throughout his life that he was born in London in 1777, the Ireland family Bible puts his birth two years earlier, on 2 August 1775. His father, Samuel Ireland, was a successful publisher of travelogues, collector of antiquities and collector of Shakespearian plays and &quot;relics&quot;. There was at the time, and still is, a great scarcity of writing in the hand of Shakespeare. Of his 37 plays, there is not one copy in his own writing, not a scrap of correspondence from Shakespeare to a friend, fellow writer, patron, producer or publisher. Forgery would fill this void.

William Henry also became a collector of books. In many later recollections Ireland described his fascination with the works and the glorious death of the forger Thomas Chatterton, and probably knew the Ossian poems of James Macpherson. He was strongly influenced by the 1780 novel &quot;Love and Madness&quot; by Herbert Croft, which was often read aloud in the Ireland house, and which contained large sections on Chatterton and Macpherson. When he was apprenticed to a mortgage lawyer, Ireland began to experiment with blank, genuinely old papers and forged signatures on them. Eventually he forged several documents until he was ready to present them to his father.

==First forgeries==

In December 1794 William told his father that he had discovered a cache of old documents belonging to an acquaintance who wanted to remain unnamed, and that one of them was a deed with a signature of Shakespeare in it. He gave the document—which he had of course made himself—to his overjoyed father, who had been looking for just that kind of signature for years.

Ireland first forged a letter, that he claimed was written by Shakespeare expressing gratitude towards the Earl of Southampton for his patronage.

Ireland went on to make more findings—a promissory note, a written declaration of Protestant faith, letters to Anne Hathaway (with a lock of hair attached), and to Queen Elizabeth—all supposedly in Shakespeare&#x27;s hand. He claimed that all came from the chest of the anonymous friend. He &quot;found&quot; books with Shakespeare&#x27;s notes in the margins and &quot;original&quot; manuscripts for &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;King Lear.&quot; The experts of the day authenticated them all.

On 24 December 1795, Samuel Ireland published his own book about the papers, a lavishly illustrated and expensively produced set of facsimiles and transcriptions of the papers called &quot;Miscellaneous Papers and Legal Instruments under the Hand and Seal of William Shakespeare&quot; (the book bears the publication date 1796). More people took interest in the matter and the plot began to unravel.

==&quot;This Solemn Mockery&quot;==

In 1795, Ireland became bolder and produced a whole new play—&quot;Vortigern and Rowena.&quot; After extensive negotiations, Irish playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan acquired rights for the first production of the play at London&#x27;s Drury Lane Theatre for £300, and a promise of half of all profits to the Irelands.

Sheridan read the play and noticed it was relatively simplistic compared to Shakespeare&#x27;s other works. John Philip Kemble, actor and manager of Drury Lane Theatre, later claimed he had serious doubts about its authenticity; he also suggested that the play appear on April Fool&#x27;s Day, though Samuel Ireland objected, and the play was moved to the next day.

Although the Shakespeare papers had prominent believers (including James Boswell), sceptics had questioned their authenticity from the beginning, and as the premiere of &quot;Vortigern&quot; approached, the press was filled with arguments over whether the papers were genuine or forgeries. On 31 March 1796, Shakespearean scholar Edmond Malone published his own exhaustive study, &quot;An Inquiry into the Authenticity of Certain Miscellaneous Papers and Legal Instruments&quot;, about the supposed papers. His attack on the papers, stretching to more than 400 densely printed pages, showed convincingly that the papers could be nothing other than modern forgeries. Although believers tried to hold their ground, scholars were convinced by Malone&#x27;s arguments.

&quot;Vortigern and Rowena&quot; opened on 2 April 1796, just two days after Malone&#x27;s book appeared. Contemporary accounts differ in details, but most agree the first three acts went smoothly, and the audience listened respectfully. Late in the play, though, Kemble used the chance to hint at his opinion by repeating Vortigern&#x27;s line &quot;and when this solemn mockery is o&#x27;er.&quot; Malone&#x27;s supporters had filled the theatre, and the play was greeted with the audience&#x27;s catcalls. The play had only one performance, and was not revived until 2008.

==Forgeries exposed==

When critics closed in and accused Samuel Ireland of forgery, his son published a confession—&quot;An Authentic Account of the Shaksperian Manuscripts&quot;—but many critics could not believe a young man could have forged them all by himself. One paper published a caricature in which William Henry is awed by the findings when the rest of the family forges more of them (as opposed to what was really going on). Samuel Ireland&#x27;s reputation did not recover before his death in 1800.

In 1805 William Henry published &quot;The Confessions of William Henry Ireland&quot;, but confession did not help his reputation. He took on a number of miscellaneous jobs as a hack writer, but always found himself short of money. In 1814 he moved to France and worked in the French national library, continuing to publish books in London all the while. When he returned in 1823, he resumed his life of penury. In 1832 he published his own edition of &quot;Vortigern and Rowena&quot; (his father had originally published it in 1799) as his own play with very little success.

There has been recent scholarly interest in his later Gothic novels and his poetry. His illustrated &quot;Histories&quot; were popular, so to say that Ireland died in obscurity is probably not correct. He was, however, perpetually impoverished; he spent time in debtors&#x27; prison, and was constantly forced to borrow money from friends and strangers. When he died, his widow and daughters applied to the Literary Fund for relief. They received only token amounts.

Ireland is one of the main characters in Peter Ackroyd&#x27;s 2004 novel &quot;The Lambs of London&quot;, though the contacts with Charles and Mary Lamb have no basis in the historical record, and Ackroyd took many liberties with the story.

<text>Eric Hebborn (20 March 1934 – 11 January 1996) was an English painter, draughtsman, art forger, and later an author.

==Early life==
Eric Hebborn was born in South Kensington, London, in 1934. His mother was born in Brighton and his father in Oxford. According to his autobiography, his mother beat him constantly as a child. He stated that at the age of eight, he set fire to his school, and was sent to Longmoor reformatory in Harold Wood; his sister Rosemary disputes this. Teachers encouraged his painting talent, and he became connected to the Maldon Art Club, where he first exhibited at the age of 15.

Hebborn attended Chelmsford Art School and Walthamstow Art School before attending the Royal Academy. He flourished at the academy, winning the Hacker Portrait prize and the Silver Award, and the British Prix de Rome in Engraving, a two-year scholarship to the British School at Rome in 1959. There he became part of the international art scene, establishing acquaintances with many artists and art historians, including Soviet spy Sir Anthony Blunt in 1960, who told Hebborn that a couple of his drawings looked like Poussins. This sowed the seeds of his forgery career.

Hebborn returned to London, where he was hired by art restorer George Aczel. During his employ he was instructed not only to restore paintings, but to alter and improve them. Aczel graduated him from restoring existing paintings to &quot;restoring&quot; paintings on entirely blank canvases so that they could be sold for more money. A falling out over Hebborn&#x27;s knowledge of painting and restoration destroyed the relationship between him and Aczel.

Hebborn and his lover Graham David Smith also frequented a junk and antique shop near Leicester Square, where Hebborn befriended one of the owners, Marie Gray. In organizing the prints catalogued in the shop, Hebborn began to learn more about paper, and its history and uses in art. It was on some of these blank old pieces of paper that Hebborn made his first forgeries.

His first true forgeries were pencil drawings after Augustus John, based on a drawing of a child by Andrea Schiavone. Smith states that several of these were sold to their landlord Mr. Davis, several to Bond Street galleries, and two or three through Christie&#x27;s sale rooms.

Eventually Hebborn decided to settle in Italy with Smith. They founded a private gallery there.

==Life as a forger==
When contemporary critics did not seem to appreciate his own paintings, Hebborn began to copy the style of old masters such as: Corot, Castiglione, Mantegna, Van Dyck, Poussin, Ghisi, Tiepolo, Rubens, Jan Breughel and Piranesi. Art historians such as Sir John Pope Hennessy declared his paintings to be both authentic and stylistically brilliant and his paintings were sold for tens of thousands of pounds through art auction houses, including Christie&#x27;s and Sotheby&#x27;s. According to Hebborn himself, he had sold thousands of fake paintings, drawings and sculptures. Most of the drawings Hebborn created were his own work, made to resemble the style of historical artists—and not slightly altered or combined copies of older work.

In 1978 a curator at the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC, Konrad Oberhuber, was examining a pair of drawings he had purchased for the museum from Colnaghi, an established and reputable old-master dealer in London: one by Savelli Sperandio and the other by Francesco del Cossa. Oberhuber noticed that two drawings had been executed on the same kind of paper.

Oberhuber was taken aback by the similarities of the paper used in the two pieces and decided to alert his colleagues in the art world. Upon finding another fake &quot;Cossa&quot; at the Morgan Library, this one having passed through the hands of at least three experts, Oberhuber contacted Colnaghi, the source of all three fakes. Colnaghi, in turn, informed the worried curators that all three had been acquired from Hebborn, although Hebborn was not publicly named.

Colnaghi waited a full eighteen months before revealing the deception to the media, and even then never mentioned Hebborn&#x27;s name, for fear of a libel suit. Alice Beckett states that she was told &#x27;...no one talks about him...The trouble is he&#x27;s too good&#x27;. Thus Hebborn continued to create his forgeries, changing his style slightly to avoid any further unmasking, and manufactured at least 500 more drawings between 1978 and 1988. The profit made from his forgeries is estimated to be more than 30 million dollars.

==Confession, criticism and death==
In 1984 Hebborn admitted to a number of forgeries – and feeling as though he had done nothing wrong, he used the press generated by his confession to denigrate the art world.

In his autobiography &quot;Drawn to Trouble&quot; (1991), Hebborn continued his assault on the art world, critics and art dealers. He spoke openly about his ability to deceive supposed art experts who (for the most part) were all too eager to play along with the ruse for the sake of profit. Hebborn also claimed that some of the works that had been proven genuine were actually his fakes. During this period, Hebborn went on record to state that Sir Anthony Blunt and he had never been lovers.

On one page he offers a side-by-side comparison of his forgeries of &quot;Henri Leroy&quot; by Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, and the authentic drawing, challenging &quot;art experts&quot; to tell them apart.

On 8 January 1996, shortly after the publication of the Italian edition of his book &quot;The Art Forger&#x27;s Handbook&quot;, Eric Hebborn was found lying in a street in Rome, having suffered massive head trauma possibly delivered by a blunt instrument.
He died in hospital on 11 January 1996.

The provenance of many artworks attributed to Hebborn, including some which are alleged to hang in renowned collections, continues to be debated. Both the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, California and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City deny that they feature any Hebborn forgeries, although this was disputed by Hebborn himself.

==Legacy==
A documentary film &quot;Eric Hebborn: Portrait of a Master Forger&quot;, featuring an extended interview with Hebborn at his home in Italy, was produced for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Omnibus&quot; strand and broadcast in 1991.

The 2014 novel &quot;In the Shadow of an Old Master&quot; is based on the mystery surrounding Eric Hebborn&#x27;s death and its aftermath.

In October 2014 it was announced that 236 drawings were to be sold, in individual lots, ranging in price from £100 to £500 each, by auctioneers Webbs of Wilton in Wiltshire. On 23 October 2014 the drawings went on to sell for over £50,000, with one sanguine drawing, after a design by Michelangelo, selling for £2,200, more than 18 times its expected price; Hebborn&#x27;s modern drawing manual, &quot;The Language of Line&quot;, complete with pencil corrections and edits, sold for more than £3,000. Although the identity of the successful purchaser of &quot;The Language of Line&quot; remains unknown, and no further copies are thought to have been in existence, Hebborn&#x27;s former agent Brian Balfour-Oatts allowed &quot;The Guardian&quot; to have sight of the manuscript, which had been sent to him by a friend of the artist. Details of the previously unpublished text were published by the newspaper in August 2015.

<text>Eustace the Monk (; c. 1170 – 24 August 1217), born Eustace Busket, was a mercenary and pirate, in the tradition of medieval outlaws. The birthplace of Eustace was not far from Boulogne. A 1243 document mentions a Guillaume le Moine, seigneur de Course, which indicates that the family lived in that vicinity.

==Life==

===Early life===
Eustace was born a younger son of Baudoin Busket, a lord of the county of Boulogne. According to his biography, he went to Toledo, Spain, and studied black magic there. The author of the &quot;Histoire des Ducs de Normandie&quot; wrote in Eustace&#x27;s own day, &quot;No one would believe the marvels he accomplished, nor those which happened to him many times.&quot; He later returned home to become a Benedictine monk at St Samer Abbey near Calais, and then left the monastery to avenge his murdered father. Other sources, however, suggest that his father died soon after 1190. The same sources mention that by 1202, Eustace was the seneschal and bailiff of the count of Boulogne, Renaud de Dammartin, and that in c. 1204, the two quarrelled and, accused of mishandling his stewardship, Eustace fled and was declared an outlaw. Renaud confiscated his lands and fields; Eustace supposedly burned two mills in retaliation.

===Serving England===
Eustace became a pirate in the English Channel and the Strait of Dover, both for his own purposes and as a mercenary of France and England. King John of England employed him intermittently from 1205 to 1212, against Philip II of France. The biography asserts that John gave him command of thirty ships at the start of this assignment. This employment involved Eustace and his brothers raiding the Normandy coast and establishing bases in the Channel Islands (he and his men held Castle Cornet in Guernsey for a considerable period). He took the island of Sark in 1205. When he raided English coastal villages, King John briefly outlawed him, but soon afterwards issued a pardon because he needed Eustace&#x27;s services.

===Serving France===
However, Eustace switched sides in 1212 (the biography puts it down to Eustace&#x27;s enemy Renaud de Dammartin allying himself with John and poisoning John&#x27;s mind against Eustace) and raided Folkestone when English troops seized his Channel Island bases. When civil war broke out in England in 1215, he supported the rebel barons and ferried Prince Louis of France across the Channel to help them in 1216.

In August 1217, whilst ferrying much-needed reinforcements to Louis, Eustace met an English fleet under Hubert de Burgh sailing out of Dover. In the ensuing Battle of Dover, Eustace wrought havoc among his former allies, until the English blinded the French with powdered lime. English troops boarded his ships and defeated his men in hand-to-hand combat. Eustace, his flagship and some other ships managed to escape, but his ship was surrounded on 24 August 1217 in the Battle of Sandwich by Philip d&#x27;Aubigny&#x27;s English fleet of Cinque Ports ships. Eustace was found hiding in the ship&#x27;s bilges and offered huge sums for his life, which his captors refused, since he had made himself so hated by the English crews. Instead, they allowed him merely the choice between the ship&#x27;s rail or the side of the trebuchet (carried as deck-cargo to England) as his execution site. (Matthew Paris includes the beheading but does not specify which he chose.) His brothers survived, and continued to hold his Channel Islands base.

===Aftermath===
In June 1217, during the negotiations for what would be known as the Treaty of Lambeth, the English demanded the return of the Channel Islands from Eustace&#x27;s control, forcibly if necessary. However, he was executed while negotiations were still ongoing and thereafter the negotiations concerned his brothers, with the same demand. The treaty eventually compelled Louis not only to give up his claim to the English throne but also to eject Eustace&#x27;s brothers from the Channel Islands.

==Biography==
A romance biography of him was written between 1223 and 1284 by an unknown poet from Picardy, mainly interested in his year or so of adventures after leaving Renaud&#x27;s service. This account tells of Eustace, from a forest hideout, duping, ambushing and humiliating Renaud again and again, in different disguises and often stealing his horses. It is linked to the medieval myths of Robin Hood and the 13th-century Old French romance &quot;Fouke le Fitz Waryn&quot; on the life of Fulk FitzWarin.

This account is then supplemented from 1205 onwards by English government records.

===Legacy===
Eustace served as the main inspiration for the murderous Friar Bellows from the first season of the British television show Blackadder.
Eustace was one of two pirates who directly inspired the character Eustass Kid from the Japanese Anime/Manga One Piece (the other being William Kidd).

<doc id="351712" wikidata="Q1435890" url="?curid=351712" title="Fonthill Abbey">
<text>Fonthill Abbey—also known as Beckford&#x27;s Folly—was a large Gothic Revival country house built between 1796 and 1813 at Fonthill Gifford in Wiltshire, England, at the direction of William Thomas Beckford and architect James Wyatt.

It was built near the site of the Palladian house, later known as Fonthill Splendens, which had been constructed by 1770 by his father William Beckford. This, in turn, had replaced the Elizabethan house that Beckford the Elder had purchased in 1744 and which had been destroyed by fire in 1755. The abbey&#x27;s main tower collapsed several times, lastly in 1825 damaging the western wing. The abbey was later almost completely demolished.

==History==

Fonthill Abbey was the brainchild of William Thomas Beckford, son of wealthy English plantation owner William Beckford and a student of architect Sir William Chambers, as well as of James Wyatt, architect of the project.

In 1771, when Beckford was ten years old, he inherited £1 million () and an income which his contemporaries estimated at around £100,000 per annum, a colossal amount at the time, but which biographers have found to be closer to half of that sum. Newspapers of the period described him as &quot;the richest commoner in England&quot;.

He first met William Courtenay (Viscount Courtenay&#x27;s 11-year-old son) in 1778. A spectacular Christmas party lasting for three days was held for the boy at Fonthill. During this time (c.1782), Beckford began writing &quot;Vathek&quot;, his most famous novel. In 1784, Beckford was accused by Courtenay&#x27;s uncle, the 1st Baron Loughborough, of having molested Courtenay over a prolonged period. The allegations of misconduct remained unproven, but the scandal was significant enough to require his exile.

Beckford chose exile in the company of his wife, Lady Margaret Gordon, whom he grew to love deeply; however, she died in childbirth after the couple had found refuge in Switzerland. Beckford travelled extensively after this tragedy—to France (repeatedly), to Germany, Italy, Spain, and Portugal (the country he favoured above all). Shunned by English society, he nevertheless decided to return to his native country; after enclosing the Fonthill estate in a long wall (high enough to prevent hunters from chasing foxes and hares on his property), the arch-romantic Beckford decided to have a Gothic cathedral built for his home.

Fonthill Abbey would be vast, reflecting &quot;the aesthetic category of &#x27;the Sublime&#x27; as defined by the philosopher Edmund Burke in the middle of the eighteenth century.&quot;

==Construction==

Construction of the abbey began in earnest in 1796 on Beckford&#x27;s estate of Fonthill Gifford near Hindon in southern Wiltshire. He hired James Wyatt, one of the most popular and successful architects of the late 18th-century, to lead the works. Wyatt was often accused of spending a good deal of his time on women and drink. Consequently, he also angered many of his clients—including Beckford—because of his all too common absences from client meetings, for a general disregard for supervising the construction works he was in charge of, and for not delivering the promised results in time, with clients accusing him—in certain instances—of years of delay.

Although suffering from a relationship which was at times strained, Beckford and Wyatt engaged in the construction of the abbey. It is clear, however, that Beckford, due to Wyatt&#x27;s constant absences from the site, and because of the intense personal interest he had in the enterprise, often took on the roles of construction site supervisor, general organiser, and patron, as well as client. Indeed, his biographers and his correspondence indicate that, during Wyatt&#x27;s prolonged absences, he took it upon himself to direct the construction of the Abbey, as well as leading the landscaping efforts on his estate.

Furthermore, the evidence suggests that not only was he happy to undertake all of those duties but, as Brockman suggests, must even have lived some of the brightest moments of his adult life managing the gigantic efforts at Fonthill. This is not to say that Wyatt&#x27;s role in the construction was by any means less than Beckford&#x27;s. Wyatt had not only designed the building (based on Beckford&#x27;s ideas), but was ultimately a master at combining the different volumes and scales. By combining different architectural styles and elements, Wyatt achieved a &quot;faux&quot; effect of layered historical development in the building.

Glass painter Francis Eginton did much work in the building, including thirty-two figures of kings, knights, etc., and many windows, for which Beckford paid him £12,000.

Beckford&#x27;s 500 labourers worked in day and night shifts. To speed the work, he out-bid (some would say bribed) 450 more from the building of the new royal apartments at Windsor Castle by increasing an ale ration. He also commandeered all the local wagons for transportation of building materials. To compensate, Beckford delivered free coal and blankets to the poor in cold weather.

The first part to be built was the tower, which reached about before it collapsed. The new tower was finished six years later, again 90 metres tall. It collapsed as well. Beckford immediately started to build another one, this time with stone, and this work was finished in seven years.

===Decorations===
The abbey part was decorated in silver, gold, red and purple. Four long wings radiated from the octagonal central room. Its front doors were tall. It was declared finished in 1813.

==Use==
The approach to the abbey, some 900 metres long and named the Great Western Avenue, ran in a straight line through woodland ENE from the Hindon-Tisbury road. Beckford lived alone in his abbey and used only one of its bedrooms. His kitchens prepared food for 12 every day, although he always dined alone and sent the surplus food away afterwards. Only once, in 1800, did he entertain guests, when Horatio Nelson, Sir William Hamilton and Emma Hamilton visited the abbey for Christmas.

Once he stipulated that he would eat a Christmas dinner only if it were served from the new abbey kitchens, and told his workmen to hurry. The kitchens collapsed as soon as the meal was over.

Beckford lived in Fonthill Abbey until 1822 when he lost two of his Jamaican sugar plantations in a legal action. He was forced to sell it and its contents for £330,000 () to arms dealer John Farquhar. William Hazlitt took the opportunity to look around Fonthill and its collections. He disagreed with Beckford&#x27;s taste, remarking 

==Collapse==
Beckford&#x27;s obsessive haste in erecting the grandiose building, coupled with his wish to achieve heights in the tower which were structurally unsound, and the use of a building method called &quot;compo-cement&quot; by Wyatt, which consisted of timber stuccoed with cement, led to the eventual collapse of the tower—damaging the western wing of the building too—in 1825. By this time, Beckford had already sold the building. He died in 1844 in Bath.

The rest of the abbey was demolished c. 1845. Only a small two-storey remnant of the north wing, with a four-storey tower, still stands; this fragment was designated as Grade II* listed in 1966. Stone from the site, including windows and carvings, was used in the construction of buildings in nearby Tisbury.

==Fonthill New Abbey==
The western part of Beckford&#x27;s estate was later acquired by the 2nd Marquess of Westminster, who had a new Fonthill Abbey built in 1846–1852 (Pevsner) or 1856–1859 (VCH), some 500 metres southeast of the site of Beckford&#x27;s abbey. This mansion, designed by William Burn in Scottish Baronial style, was demolished in 1955.

The stable buildings survive in residential use, as do four lodges at estate entrances, built in or around 1860: Tisbury Lodge, south of Fonthill Gifford church, designed in matching Scottish style by Burn; Lawn Lodge, further south along the same road, also by Burn but in plain ashlar; West Gate Lodge, in the southwest of Beckford&#x27;s estate, in red and yellow brick; and Stone Gate Lodge, at Beckford&#x27;s western entrance, in the same brick style.

Ornamental stonework also survives in the grounds of the former mansion. Two groups of four statues, representing the four seasons and the four elements, stand among trees southeast of the site; they are thought to have been bought by the Marquess at the Paris Exhibition of 1855 or 1867. To the northwest, close to the site of Beckford&#x27;s abbey, are three decorated urns on plinths, said to be from the same source.

<text>North Weald railway station is on the Epping Ongar Railway, a heritage railway, located in North Weald, Essex.

The station was opened in 1865 by the Great Eastern Railway, on its extension from Loughton to Ongar. It was latterly a Central line station on the London Underground between Epping and Blake Hall stations. The section beyond Epping to closed in 1994.

==History==
North Weald station was opened by the Great Eastern Railway (GER) on 24 April 1865, serving principally as a goods yard, taking agricultural produce from the nearby farms into London. During World War II it was frequently used by airmen travelling to and from the nearby North Weald Airfield. Steam locomotives operated by British Rail for the London Underground ran a shuttle service from Epping to Ongar (stopping at North Weald) from 1949 to 1957, when the track was electrified and taken over by the Central line.

While the Epping to Ongar branch was normally operated as an isolated section of the Central line, for two days every year trains were run from London to terminate at North Weald: these trains served the North Weald Airshow on the Saturday and Sunday of its opening at the aerodrome almost adjacent to the station. The normal Epping to Ongar shuttle dovetailed with this service passing the terminating train on the adjacent line during its southbound journey.

The line from Epping to Ongar is a single-track railway apart from at North Weald, which functioned as the only available passing loop for trains travelling in opposite directions. In 1888, however, the eastern end of the loop was severed and it was used only as a siding. The loop was restored in 1949 after transfer to London Transport, and a second (westbound) platform was built at this time, and both platforms were used from 1949 until 1976, the westbound track being lifted in 1978. Until this time, access to the two platforms was controlled from the original Eastern Counties Railway signal box still sited on the southbound platform to this day. Until this occurred, North Weald was the last section of the Underground network to be signalled using mechanical semaphore signals. Although disused, the illuminated track diagram in the signal box continued to show the progress of trains until its closure.

===Closure===
The Epping to Ongar branch was not heavily used and became increasingly unprofitable. The service was further undermined when the Greater London Council removed the running subsidy for the line because it was not within the boundary of Greater London, and no comparable subsidy was forthcoming from the local government agencies in Essex, which meant that fare levels were much higher than on the rest of the Underground network. Initially, the Sunday service was dropped, and then the Saturday service. Subsequently, the service was restricted to a peak-only service of seven trains in each direction per day (three in the morning and four in the evening). London Transport (later London Underground Ltd) had made repeated representations to the government to close the line, but each was refused as there was no alternative mode of transport between Epping and Ongar.

A final request was made in 1994 with a proviso that the line was to be sold to a private organisation which would continue to run the services. With the promise of continued services, the government finally agreed to London Underground closing the line. The line, including North Weald station, was closed on 30 September 1994. Because of the intention to continue services, the line was left largely intact, although the two electric conductor rails were lifted. However, the promised service did not immediately materialise, and it was not until 2004 that a volunteer force restored a partial service as a heritage railway. Because London Underground would not provide platform space at Epping, North Weald is currently the westernmost terminus of the line. A shuttle does run further west as far as Coopersale, but there are no station facilities there. It is intended to run to a separate station facility near Epping station in the future.

===Current ownership===
North Weald station, as with the rest of the 6.5-mile branch reaching to the outskirts of Epping station, is undergoing significant improvement and infrastructure works in connection with its use as a heritage railway. These works are designed with the long-term future of the branch and to enable the use of locomotive-hauled trains (hauled by steam and diesel locomotives).

The station itself has been extensively restored with all the rooms being restored to their original uses.
The original GER signalbox dating from 1888 is being restored, complete with its original lever frame, as part of the works to signal the passing loop which has been reinstated through the station. The westbound platform has been restored, with a new accessible ramp installed, and an original GER latticework footbridge (formerly from Woodford) is in the process of being installed to replace the British Rail concrete structure.

The branch once again runs locomotive-hauled trains between Ongar and North Weald, with a diesel shuttle towards Coopersale and connecting heritage buses to Epping.

==Connections==

Local bus routes 62, 380, 381, 396, 501 (Sundays only), SB06 and Vintage Route 339 serve the station (and North Weald village).

== Trivia ==
The station was used as a filming location for a scene in the &quot;Heartstopper&quot; Netflix show.

<text>The Burke and Hare murders were a series of sixteen murders committed over a period of about ten months in 1828 in Edinburgh, Scotland. They were undertaken by William Burke and William Hare, who sold the corpses to Robert Knox for dissection at his anatomy lectures.

Edinburgh was a leading European centre of anatomical study in the early 19th century, in a time when the demand for cadavers led to a shortfall in legal supply. Scottish law required that corpses used for medical research should only come from those who had died in prison, suicide victims, or from foundlings and orphans. The shortage of corpses led to an increase in body snatching by what were known as &quot;resurrection men&quot;. Measures to ensure graves were left undisturbed—such as the use of mortsafes—exacerbated the shortage. When a lodger in Hare&#x27;s house died, he turned to his friend Burke for advice; they decided to sell the body to Knox. They received what was, for them, the generous sum of £7 10s. A little over two months later, when Hare was concerned that a lodger with a fever would deter others from staying in the house, he and Burke murdered her and sold the body to Knox. The men continued their murder spree, probably with the knowledge of their wives. Their actions were uncovered after other lodgers discovered their last victim, Margaret Docherty, and contacted the police.

A forensic examination of Docherty&#x27;s body indicated she had probably been suffocated, but this could not be proven. Although the police suspected Burke and Hare of other murders, there was no evidence on which they could take action. An offer was put to Hare granting immunity from prosecution if he turned king&#x27;s evidence. He provided the details of Docherty&#x27;s murder and confessed to all sixteen deaths; formal charges were made against Burke and his wife for three murders. At the subsequent trial Burke was found guilty of one murder and sentenced to death. The case against his wife was found not proven—a Scottish legal verdict to acquit an individual as the prosecution had not proven their guilt. Burke was hanged shortly afterwards; his corpse was dissected and his skeleton displayed at the Anatomical Museum of Edinburgh Medical School where, , it remains.

The murders raised public awareness of the need for bodies for medical research and contributed to the passing of the Anatomy Act 1832. The events have made appearances in literature, and been portrayed on screen, either in heavily fictionalised accounts or as the inspiration for fictional works.

==Background==
===Anatomy in 19th-century Edinburgh===
In the early 19th century Edinburgh had several pioneering anatomy teachers, including Alexander Monro, his son who was also called Alexander, John Bell, John Goodsir and Robert Knox, all of whom developed the subject into a modern science. Because of their efforts, Edinburgh became one of the leading European centres of anatomical study, alongside Leiden in the Netherlands and the Italian city of Padua. The teaching of anatomy—crucial in the study of surgery—required a sufficient supply of cadavers, the demand for which increased as the science developed. Scottish law determined that suitable corpses on which to undertake the dissections were those who died in prison, suicide victims, and the bodies of and orphans. With the rise in prestige and popularity of medical training in Edinburgh, the legal supply of corpses failed to keep pace with the demand; students, lecturers and grave robbers—also known as resurrection men—began an illicit trade in exhumed cadavers.

The situation was confused by the legal position. Disturbing a grave was a criminal offence, as was the taking of property from the deceased. Stealing the body itself was not an offence, as it did not legally belong to anyone. The price per corpse changed depending on the season. It was £8 during the summer, when the warmer temperatures brought on quicker decomposition, and £10 in the winter months, when the demand by anatomists was greater, because the lower temperatures meant they could store corpses longer so undertook more dissections.

By the 1820s the residents of Edinburgh had taken to the streets to protest at the increase in grave robbing. To avoid corpses being disinterred, bereaved families used several techniques in order to deter the thieves: guards were hired to watch the graves, and watchtowers were built in several cemeteries; some families hired a large stone slab that could be placed over a grave for a short period—until the body had begun to decay past the point of being useful for an anatomist. Other families used a mortsafe, an iron cage that surrounded the coffin. The high levels of vigilance from the public, and the techniques used to deter the grave robbers, led to what the historian Ruth Richardson describes as &quot;a growing atmosphere of crisis&quot; among anatomists because of the shortage of corpses. The historian Tim Marshall considers the situation meant &quot;Burke and Hare took graverobbing to its logical conclusion: instead of digging up the dead, they accepted lucrative incentives to destroy the living&quot;.

===Robert Knox===

Knox was an anatomist who had qualified as a doctor in 1814. After contracting smallpox as a child, he was blind in one eye and badly disfigured. He undertook service as an army physician at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, followed by a posting in England and then, during the Cape Frontier War (1819), in southern Africa. He eventually settled in his home town of Edinburgh in 1820. In 1825 he became a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, where he lectured on anatomy. He undertook dissections twice a day, and his advertising promised &quot;a full demonstration on fresh anatomical subjects&quot; as part of every course of lectures he delivered; he stated that his lessons drew over 400 pupils. Clare Taylor, Knox&#x27;s biographer in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, observes that he &quot;built up a formidable reputation as a teacher and lecturer and almost single-handedly raised the profile of the study of anatomy in Britain&quot;. Another biographer, Isobel Rae, considers that without Knox, the study of anatomy in Britain &quot;might not have progressed as it did&quot;.

===William Burke and William Hare===

William Burke was born in 1792 in Urney, County Tyrone, Ireland, one of two sons to middle-class parents. Burke, along with his brother Constantine, had a comfortable upbringing, and both joined the British Army as teenagers. Burke served in the Donegal militia until he met and married a woman from County Mayo, where they later settled. The marriage was short-lived; in 1818, after an argument with his father-in-law over land ownership, Burke deserted his wife and family. He moved to Scotland and became a labourer, working on the Union Canal. He settled in the small village of Maddiston near Falkirk, and set up home with Helen McDougal, whom he affectionately nicknamed Nelly; she became his second wife. After a few years, and when the works on the canal were finished, the couple moved to Tanners Close, Edinburgh, in November 1827. They became hawkers, selling second-hand clothes to impoverished locals. Burke then became a cobbler, a trade in which he experienced some success, earning upwards of £1 a week. He became known locally as an industrious and good-humoured man who often entertained his clients by singing and dancing for them on their doorsteps while plying his trade. Although raised as a Roman Catholic, Burke became a regular worshipper at Presbyterian religious meetings held in the Grassmarket; he was seldom seen without a bible.
William Hare was probably born in either County Armagh, County Londonderry or Newry. His age and year of birth are unknown; when arrested in 1828 he gave his age as 21, but one source states that he was born between 1792 and 1804. Information on his earlier life is scant, although it is possible that he worked in Ireland as an agricultural labourer before travelling to Britain. He worked on the Union Canal for seven years before moving to Edinburgh in the mid-1820s, where he worked as a coal man&#x27;s assistant. He lodged at Tanner&#x27;s Close, in the house of a man named Logue and his wife, Margaret Laird, in the nearby West Port area of the town. When Logue died in 1826, Hare may have married Margaret. Based on contemporary accounts, Brian Bailey in his history of the murders describes Hare as &quot;illiterate and uncouth—a lean, quarrelsome, violent and amoral character with the scars from old wounds about his head and brow&quot;. Bailey describes Margaret, who was also an Irish immigrant, as a &quot;hard-featured and debauched &quot;.

In 1827 Burke and McDougal went to Penicuik in Midlothian to work on the harvest, where they met Hare. The men became friends; when Burke and McDougal returned to Edinburgh, they moved into Hare&#x27;s Tanner&#x27;s Close lodging house, where the two couples soon acquired a reputation for hard drinking and boisterous behaviour.
==Events of November 1827 to November 1828==

On 29 November 1827 Donald, a lodger in Hare&#x27;s house, died of dropsy shortly before receiving a quarterly army pension while owing £4 of back rent. After Hare bemoaned his financial loss to Burke, the pair decided to sell Donald&#x27;s body to one of the local anatomists. A carpenter provided a coffin for a burial which was to be paid for by the local parish. After he left, the pair opened the coffin, removed the body—which they hid under the bed—filled the coffin with bark from a local tanners and resealed it. After dark, on the day the coffin was removed for burial, they took the corpse to Edinburgh University, where they looked for a purchaser. According to Burke&#x27;s later testimony, they asked for directions to Professor Monro, but a student sent them to Knox&#x27;s premises in Surgeon&#x27;s Square. Although the men dealt with juniors when discussing the possibility of selling the body, it was Knox who arrived to fix the price at £7 10s. Hare received £4 5s while Burke took the balance of £3 5s; Hare&#x27;s larger share was to cover his loss from Donald&#x27;s unpaid rent. According to Burke&#x27;s official confession, as he and Hare left the university, one of Knox&#x27;s assistants told them that the anatomists &quot;would be glad to see them again when they had another to dispose of&quot;.

There is no agreement as to the order in which the murders took place. Burke made two confessions but gave different sequences for the murders in each statement. The first was an official one, given on 3 January 1829 to the sheriff-substitute, the procurator fiscal and the assistant sheriff-clerk. The second was in the form of an interview with the &quot;Edinburgh Courant&quot; that was published on 7 February 1829. These in turn differed from the order given in Hare&#x27;s statement, although the pair were agreed on many of the points of the murders. Contemporary reports also differ from the confessions of the two men. More recent sources, including the accounts written by Brian Bailey, Lisa Rosner and Owen Dudley Edwards, either follow one of the historic versions or present their own order of events.

Most of the sources agree that the first murder in January or February 1828 was either that of a miller named Joseph lodging in Hare&#x27;s house, or a salt seller named Abigail Simpson. The historian Lisa Rosner considers Joseph the more likely; a pillow was used to smother the victim, while later ones were suffocated by a hand over the nose and mouth. The novelist Sir Walter Scott, who took a keen interest in the case, also thought the miller was the more likely first victim, and highlighted that &quot;there was an additional motive to reconcile them to the deed&quot;, as Joseph had developed a fever and had become delirious. Hare and his wife were concerned that having a potentially infectious lodger would be bad for business. Hare again turned to Burke and, after providing their victim with whisky, Hare suffocated Joseph while Burke lay across the upper torso to restrict movement. They again took the corpse to Knox, who this time paid £10. Rosner considers the method of murder to be ingenious: Burke&#x27;s weight on the victim stifled movement—and thus the ability to make noise—while it also prevented the chest from expanding should any air get past Hare&#x27;s suffocating grip. In Rosner&#x27;s opinion, the method would have been &quot;practically undetectable until the era of modern forensics&quot;.

The order of the two victims next after Joseph is also unclear; Rosner puts the sequence as Abigail Simpson followed by an English male lodger from Cheshire, while Bailey and Dudley Edwards each have the order as the English male lodger followed by Simpson. The unnamed Englishman was a travelling seller of matches and tinder who fell ill with jaundice at Hare&#x27;s lodging house. As with Joseph, Hare was concerned with the effect this illness might have on his business, and he and Burke employed the same &quot;modus operandi&quot; they had with the miller: Hare suffocating their victim while Burke lay over the body to stop movement and noise. Simpson was a pensioner who lived in the nearby village of Gilmerton and visited Edinburgh to supplement her pension by selling salt. On 12 February 1828—the only exact date Burke quoted in his confession—she was invited into the Hares&#x27; house and plied with enough alcohol to ensure she was too drunk to return home. After murdering her, Burke and Hare placed the body in a tea-chest and sold it to Knox. They received £10 for each body, and Burke&#x27;s confession records of Simpson&#x27;s body that &quot;Dr Knox approved of its being so fresh ... but [he] did not ask any questions&quot;. In either February or March that year an old woman was invited into the house by Margaret Hare. She gave her enough whisky to fall asleep, and when Hare returned that afternoon, he covered the sleeping woman&#x27;s mouth and nose with the bed tick (a stiff mattress cover) and left her. She was dead by nightfall and Burke joined his companion to transport the corpse to Knox, who paid another £10.
Burke met two women in early April: Mary Paterson (also known as Mary Mitchell) and Janet Brown, in the Canongate area of Edinburgh. He bought the two women alcohol before inviting them back to his lodging for breakfast. The three left the tavern with two bottles of whisky and went instead to his brother Constantine&#x27;s house. After his brother left for work, Burke and the women finished the whisky and Paterson fell asleep at the table; Burke and Brown continued talking but were interrupted by McDougal, who accused them of having an affair. A row broke out between Burke and McDougal—during which he threw a glass at her, cutting her over the eye—Brown stated that she did not know Burke was married and left; McDougal also left, and went to fetch Hare and his wife. They arrived shortly afterwards and the two men locked their wives out of the room, then murdered Paterson in her sleep. That afternoon the pair took the body to Knox in a tea-chest, while McDougal kept Paterson&#x27;s skirt and petticoats; they were paid £8 for the corpse, which was still warm when they delivered it. Fergusson—one of Knox&#x27;s assistants—asked where they had obtained the body, as he thought he recognised her. Burke explained that the girl had drunk herself to death, and they had purchased it &quot;from an old woman in the Canongate&quot;. Knox was delighted with the corpse, and stored it in whisky for three months before dissecting it. When Brown later searched for her friend, she was told that she had left for Glasgow with a travelling salesman.

At some point in early-to-mid 1828 a Mrs Haldane, whom Burke described as &quot;a stout old woman&quot;, lodged at Hare&#x27;s premises. After she became drunk, she fell asleep in the stable; she was smothered and sold to Knox. Several months later Haldane&#x27;s daughter (either called Margaret or Peggy) also lodged at Hare&#x27;s house. She and Burke drank together heavily and he killed her, without Hare&#x27;s assistance; her body was put into a tea-chest and taken to Knox where Burke was paid £8. The next murder occurred in May 1828, when an old woman joined the house as a lodger. One evening while she was intoxicated, Burke smothered her—Hare was not present in the house at the time; her body was sold to Knox for £10. Then came the murder of Effy (sometimes spelt Effie), a &quot;cinder gatherer&quot; who scavenged through bins and rubbish tips to sell her findings. Effy was known to Burke and had previously sold him scraps of leather for his cobbling business. Burke tempted her into the stable with whisky, and when she was drunk enough he and Hare killed her; Knox gave £10 for the body. Another victim was found by Burke too drunk to stand. She was being helped by a local constable back to her lodgings when Burke offered to take her there himself; the policeman obliged, and Burke took her back to Hare&#x27;s house where she was killed. Her corpse raised a further £10 from Knox.

Burke and Hare murdered two lodgers in June, &quot;an old woman and a dumb boy, her grandson&quot;, as Burke later recalled in his confession. While the boy sat by the fire in the kitchen, his grandmother was murdered in the bedroom by the usual method. Burke and Hare then picked up the boy and carried him to the same room where he was also killed. Burke later said that this was the murder that disturbed him the most, as he was haunted by his recollection of the boy&#x27;s expression. The tea-chest that was usually used by the duo to transport the bodies was found to be too small, so the bodies were forced into a herring barrel and taken to Surgeons&#x27; Square, where they fetched £8 each. According to Burke&#x27;s confession, the barrel was loaded onto a cart which Hare&#x27;s horse refused to pull further than the Grassmarket. Hare called a porter with a handcart to help him transport the container. Once back in Tanner&#x27;s Close, Hare took his anger out on the horse by shooting it dead in the yard.

On 24 June Burke and McDougal departed for Falkirk to visit the latter&#x27;s father. Burke knew that Hare was short of cash and had even pawned some of his clothes. When the couple returned, they found that Hare was wearing new clothes and had surplus money. After he was asked, Hare denied that he had sold another body. Burke checked with Knox, who confirmed Hare had sold a woman&#x27;s body for £8. It led to an argument between the two men and they came to blows. Burke and his wife moved into the home of his cousin, John Broggan (or Brogan), two streets away from Tanner&#x27;s Close.
The breach between the two men did not last long. In late September or early October Hare was visiting Burke when Mrs Ostler (also given as Hostler), a washerwoman, came to the property to do the laundry. The men got her drunk and killed her; the corpse was with Knox that afternoon, for which the men received £8. A week or two later one of McDougal&#x27;s relatives, Ann Dougal (also given as McDougal) was visiting from Falkirk; after a few days the men killed her by their usual technique and received £10 for the body. Burke later claimed that about this time Hare&#x27;s wife suggested killing Helen McDougal on the grounds that &quot;they could not trust her, as she was a Scotch woman&quot;, but he refused.

Burke and Hare&#x27;s next victim was a familiar figure in the streets of Edinburgh: James Wilson, an 18-year-old man with a limp caused by deformed feet. He was mentally disabled and, according to Alanna Knight in her history of the murders, was inoffensive; he was known locally as Daft Jamie. Wilson lived on the streets and supported himself by begging. In November Hare lured Wilson to his lodgings with the promise of whisky, and sent his wife to fetch Burke. The two murderers led Wilson into a bedroom, the door of which Margaret locked before pushing the key back under the door. As Wilson did not like excess whisky—he preferred snuff—he was not as drunk as most of the duo&#x27;s victims; he was also strong and fought back against the two attackers, but was overpowered and killed in the normal way. His body was stripped and his few possessions stolen: Burke kept a snuff box and Hare a snuff spoon. When the body was examined the following day by Knox and his students, several of them recognised it to be Wilson, but Knox denied it could be anyone the students knew. When word started circulating that Wilson was missing, Knox dissected the body ahead of the others that were being held in storage; the head and feet were removed before the main dissection.
The final victim, killed on 31 October 1828, was Margaret Docherty, a middle-aged Irish woman. Burke lured her into the Broggan lodging house by claiming that his mother was also a Docherty from the same area of Ireland, and the pair began drinking. At one point Burke left Docherty in the company of McDougal while he went out, ostensibly to buy more whisky, but actually to get Hare. Two other lodgers—Ann and James Gray—were an inconvenience to the men, so they paid them to stay at Hare&#x27;s lodging for the night, claiming Docherty was a relative. The drinking continued into the evening, by which time Margaret had joined in. At around 9:00 pm the Grays returned briefly to collect some clothing for their children, and saw Burke, Hare, their wives and Docherty all drunk, singing and dancing. Although Burke and Hare came to blows at some point in the evening, they subsequently murdered Docherty, and put her body in a pile of straw at the end of the bed.

The next day the Grays returned, and Ann became suspicious when Burke would not let her approach a bed where she had left her stockings. When they were left alone in the house in the early evening, the Grays searched the straw and found Docherty&#x27;s body, showing blood and saliva on the face. On their way to alert the police, they ran into McDougal who tried to bribe them with an offer of £10 a week; they refused. While the Grays reported the murder to the police, Burke and Hare removed the body and took it to Knox&#x27;s surgery. The police search located Docherty&#x27;s bloodstained clothing hidden under the bed. When questioned, Burke and his wife claimed that Docherty had left the house, but gave different times for her departure. This raised enough suspicion for the police to take them in for questioning. Early the following morning the police went to Knox&#x27;s dissecting-rooms where they found Docherty&#x27;s body; James identified her as the woman he had seen with Burke and Hare. Hare and his wife were arrested that day, as was Broggan; all denied any knowledge of the events.

In total sixteen people were murdered by Burke and Hare. Burke stated later that he and Hare were &quot;generally in a state of intoxication&quot; when the murders were carried out, and that he &quot;could not sleep at night without a bottle of whisky by his bedside, and a twopenny candle to burn all night beside him; when he awoke he would take a drink from the bottle—sometimes half a bottle at a draught—and that would make him sleep.&quot; He also took opium to ease his conscience.

==Developments: investigation and the path to court==

On 3 November 1828 a warrant was issued for the detention of Burke, Hare and their wives; Broggan was released without further action. The four suspects were kept apart and statements taken; these conflicted with the initial answers given on the day of their arrests. After Alexander Black, a police surgeon, examined Docherty&#x27;s body, two forensic specialists were appointed, Robert Christison and William Newbigging; they reported that it was probable the victim had been murdered by suffocation, but this could not be medically proven. On the basis of the report from the two doctors, the Burkes and Hares were charged with murder. As part of his investigation Christison interviewed Knox, who asserted that Burke and Hare had watched poor lodging houses in Edinburgh and purchased bodies before anyone claimed them for burial. Christison thought Knox was &quot;deficient in principle and heart&quot;, but did not think he had broken the law.

Although the police were sure murder had taken place, and that at least one of the four was guilty, they were uncertain whether they could secure a conviction. Police also suspected there had been other murders committed, but the lack of bodies hampered this line of enquiry. As news of the possibility of other murders came to the public&#x27;s attention, newspapers began to publish lurid and inaccurate stories of the crimes; speculative reports led members of the public to assume that all missing people had been victims. Janet Brown went to the police and identified her friend Mary Paterson&#x27;s clothing, while a local baker informed them that Jamie Wilson&#x27;s trousers were being worn by Burke&#x27;s nephew. On 19 November a warrant for the murder of Jamie Wilson was made against the four suspects.

Sir William Rae, the Lord Advocate, followed a regular technique: he focused on one individual to extract a confession on which the others could be convicted. Hare was chosen and, on 1 December, he was offered immunity from prosecution if he turned king&#x27;s evidence and provided the full details of the murder of Docherty and any other; because he could not be brought to testify against his wife, she was also exempt from prosecution. Hare made a full confession of all the deaths and Rae decided sufficient evidence existed to secure a prosecution. On 4 December formal charges were laid against Burke and McDougal for the murders of Mary Paterson, James Wilson and Mrs Docherty.
Knox faced no charges for the murders because Burke&#x27;s statement to the police exonerated the surgeon. Public awareness of the news grew as newspapers and broadsides began releasing further details. Opinion was against Knox and, according to Bailey, many in Edinburgh thought he was &quot;a sinister ringmaster who got Burke and Hare dancing to his tune&quot;. Several broadsides were published with editorials stating that he should have been in the dock alongside the murderers, which influenced public opinion. A new word was coined from the murders: &quot;&quot;, to smother a victim or to commit an anatomy murder, and a rhyme began circulating around the streets of Edinburgh:

==Trial==
The trial began at 10:00 am on Christmas Eve 1828 before the High Court of Justiciary in Edinburgh&#x27;s Parliament House. The case was heard by the Lord Justice-Clerk, David Boyle, supported by the Lords Meadowbank, Pitmilly and Mackenzie. The court was full shortly after the doors were opened at 9:00 am, and a large crowd gathered outside Parliament House; 300 constables were on duty to prevent disturbances, while infantry and cavalry were on standby as a further precaution.
The case ran through the day and night to the following morning; Rosner notes that even a formal postponement of the case for dinner could have raised questions about the validity of the trial. When the charges were read out, the two defence counsels objected to Burke and McDougal being tried together. James Moncreiff, Burke&#x27;s defence lawyer, protested that his client was charged &quot;with three unconnected murders, committed each at a different time, and at a different place&quot; in a trial with another defendant &quot;who is not even alleged to have had any concern with two of the offences of which he is accused&quot;. Several hours were spent on legal arguments about the objection. The judge decided that to ensure a fair trial, the indictment should be split into separate charges for the three murders. He gave Rae the choice as to which should be heard first; Rae opted for the murder of Docherty, given they had the corpse and the strongest evidence.

In the early afternoon Burke and McDougal pleaded not guilty to the murder of Docherty. The first witnesses were then called from a list of 55 that included Hare and Knox; not all the witnesses on the list were called and Knox, with three of his assistants, avoided being questioned in court. One of Knox&#x27;s assistants, David Paterson—who had been the main person Burke and Hare had dealt with at Knox&#x27;s surgery—was called and confirmed the pair had supplied the doctor with several corpses.

In the early evening Hare took the stand to give evidence. Under cross-examination about the murder of Docherty, Hare claimed Burke had been the sole murderer and McDougal had twice been involved by bringing Docherty back to the house after she had run out; Hare stated that he had assisted Burke in the delivery of the body to Knox. Although he was asked about other murders, he was not obliged to answer the questions, as the charge related only to the death of Docherty. After Hare&#x27;s questioning, his wife entered the witness box, carrying their baby daughter who had developed whooping cough. Margaret used the child&#x27;s coughing fits as a way to give herself thinking time for some of the questions, and told the court that she had a very poor memory and could not remember many of the events.

The final prosecution witnesses were the two doctors, Black and Christison; both said they suspected foul play, but that there was no forensic evidence to support the suggestion of murder. There were no witnesses called for the defence, although the pre-trial declarations by Burke and McDougal were read out in their place. The prosecution summed up their case, after which, at 3:00 am, Burke&#x27;s defence lawyer began his final statement, which lasted for two hours; McDougal&#x27;s defence lawyer began his address to the jury on his client&#x27;s behalf at 5:00 am. Boyle then gave his summing up, directing the jury to accept the arguments of the prosecution. The jury retired to consider its verdict at 8:30 am on Christmas Day and returned fifty minutes later. It delivered a guilty verdict against Burke for the murder of Docherty; the same charge against McDougal they found not proven. As he passed the death sentence against Burke, Boyle told him:

==Aftermath, including execution and dissection==

McDougal was released at the end of the trial and returned home. The following day she went to buy whisky and was confronted by a mob who were angry at the not proven verdict. She was taken to a police building in nearby Fountainbridge for her own protection, but after the mob laid siege to it she escaped through a back window to the main police station off Edinburgh&#x27;s High Street. She tried to see Burke, but permission was refused; she left Edinburgh the next day, and there are no clear accounts of her later life. On 3 January 1829, on the advice of both Catholic priests and Presbyterian clergy, Burke made another confession. This was more detailed than the official one provided prior to his trial; he placed much of the blame for the murders on Hare.

On 16 January 1829 a petition on behalf of James Wilson&#x27;s mother and sister, protesting against Hare&#x27;s immunity and intended release from prison, was given lengthy consideration by the High Court of Justiciary and rejected by a vote of 4 to 2. Margaret was released on 19 January and travelled to Glasgow to find a passage back to Ireland. While waiting for a ship she was recognised and attacked by a mob. She was given shelter in a police station before being given a police escort onto a Belfast-bound vessel; no clear accounts exist of what became of her after she landed in Ireland.
Burke was hanged on the morning of 28 January 1829 in front of a crowd possibly as large as 25,000; views from windows in the tenements overlooking the scaffold were hired at prices ranging from 5s to 20s. On 1 February Burke&#x27;s corpse was publicly dissected by Professor Monro in the anatomy theatre of the university&#x27;s Old College. Police had to be called when large numbers of students gathered demanding access to the lecture for which a limited number of tickets had been issued. A minor riot ensued; calm was restored only after one of the university professors negotiated with the crowd that they would be allowed to pass through the theatre in batches of fifty, after the dissection. During the procedure, which lasted for two hours, Monro dipped his quill pen into Burke&#x27;s blood and wrote, &quot;This is written with the blood of Wm Burke, who was hanged at Edinburgh. This blood was taken from his head&quot;.

Burke&#x27;s skeleton was given to the Anatomical Museum of the Edinburgh Medical School where, , it remains. His death mask and a book said to be bound with his tanned skin is on display at Surgeons&#x27; Hall Museum.

Hare was released on 5 February 1829—his extended stay in custody had been undertaken for his own protection—and was assisted in leaving Edinburgh in disguise by the mailcoach to Dumfries. At one of its stops he was recognised by a fellow passenger, Erskine Douglas Sandford, a junior counsel who had represented Wilson&#x27;s family; Sandford informed his fellow passengers of Hare&#x27;s identity. On arrival in Dumfries the news of Hare&#x27;s presence spread and a large crowd gathered at the hostelry where he was due to stay the night. Police arrived and arranged for a decoy coach to draw off the crowd while Hare escaped through a back window and into a carriage which took him to the town&#x27;s prison for safekeeping. A crowd surrounded the building; stones were thrown at the door and windows and street lamps were smashed before 100 special constables arrived to restore order. In the small hours of the morning, escorted by a sheriff officer and militia guard, Hare was taken out of town, set down on the Annan Road and instructed to make his way to the English border. There were no subsequent reliable sightings of him and his eventual fate is unknown.
Knox refused to make any public statements about his dealings with Burke and Hare. The common thought in Edinburgh was that he was culpable in the events; he was lampooned in caricature and, in February 1829, a crowd gathered outside his house and burned an effigy of him. A committee of inquiry cleared him of complicity and reported that they had &quot;seen no evidence that Dr Knox or his assistants knew that murder was committed in procuring any of the subjects brought to his rooms&quot;. He resigned from his position as curator of the College of Surgeons&#x27; museum, and was gradually excluded from university life by his peers. He left Edinburgh in 1842 and lectured in Britain and mainland Europe. While working in London he fell foul of the regulations of the Royal College of Surgeons and was debarred from lecturing; he was removed from the roll of fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1848. From 1856 he worked as a pathological anatomist at the Brompton Cancer Hospital and had a medical practice in Hackney until his death in 1862.

===Legislation===

The question of the supply of cadavers for scientific research had been promoted by the English philosopher Jeremy Bentham before the crimes of Burke and Hare took place. A parliamentary select committee had drafted a &quot;Bill for preventing the unlawful disinterment of human bodies, and for regulating Schools of Anatomy&quot; in mid 1828—six months before the murders were detected. This was rejected in 1829 by the House of Lords.

The murders committed by Burke and Hare raised public awareness of the need for bodies for medical purposes, and of the trade that doctors had conducted with grave robbers and murderers. The East London murder of a 14-year-old boy and the subsequent attempt to sell the corpse to the medical school at King&#x27;s College London led to an investigation of the London Burkers, who had recently turned from grave robbing to murder to obtain corpses; two men were hanged in December 1831 for the crime. A bill was quickly introduced into Parliament, and gained royal assent nine months later to become the Anatomy Act 1832. This Act authorised dissection on bodies from workhouses unclaimed after 48 hours, and ended the practice of anatomising as part of the death sentence for murder.

In Scotland, especially among the travelling community, myths of &quot;Burkers&quot; and &quot;Noddies&quot;, along with a more general fear of hospitals and doctors, continued to hold sway into the 20th century.

===In media portrayals and popular culture===
The events of the West Port murders have made appearances in fiction. They are referred to in Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s 1884 short story &quot;The Body Snatcher&quot; and Marcel Schwob told their story in the last chapter of &quot;Imaginary Lives&quot; (1896), while the Edinburgh-based author Elizabeth Byrd used the events in her novels &quot;Rest Without Peace&quot; (1974) and &quot;The Search for Maggie Hare&quot; (1976). The murders have also been portrayed on stage and screen, usually in heavily fictionalised form.

David Paterson, Knox&#x27;s assistant, contacted Walter Scott to ask the novelist if he would be interested in writing an account of the murders, but he declined, despite Scott&#x27;s long-standing interest in the events. Scott later wrote:

<text>Walter Friedrich Schellenberg (16 January 1910 – 31 March 1952) was a German SS functionary during the Nazi era. He rose through the ranks of the SS, becoming one of the highest ranking men in the &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; (SD) and eventually assumed the position as head of foreign intelligence for Nazi Germany following the abolition of the &quot;Abwehr&quot; in 1944.

==Career==
Schellenberg, born in Saarbrücken, Germany, was his parents&#x27; seventh child; his father was a piano manufacturer. Schellenberg moved with his family to Luxembourg when the French occupied (1920) the Saar Basin after the First World War and the Weimar Republic experienced an economic crisis in the early 1920s. Like many young intellectuals who later joined the &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; (SD), Schellenberg was deeply affected by the economic woes which befell Germany in the wake of the First World War.

Schellenberg returned to Germany to attend university, first at the University of Marburg and then, from 1929, at the University of Bonn. He initially studied medicine, but soon switched to law. While in law school, Schellenberg performed some spy work for the SD. He reported actually having been recruited by two SD agents who were college faculty, who also advised him to join the Civil Service. After graduating he joined the SS in 1933. (Schellenberg later wrote that the &quot;better type of people&quot; preferred the SS over the other Nazi organizations.) Although educated as a lawyer, Schellenberg distrusted administrative attorneys and was intent on ensuring that the SD could operate outside the constraints of normal law. Subscribing to the &quot;Führerprinzip&quot;, Schellenberg also regarded Hitler&#x27;s directives as beyond the framework of the legal system and believed it was best to &quot;unquestioningly&quot; carry out anything ordered by the Nazi leader.

In 1935, Schellenberg met Reinhard Heydrich and worked for him in the counter-intelligence department of the SD. Besides his native German, Schellenberg also spoke French and English fluently. Correspondingly, his first foreign-intelligence assignment was to Paris in 1934 to check up on the political views of a professor. Then in 1937, Schellenberg was sent to Italy for a police assignment which included security duties for an upcoming visit by Mussolini; his outstanding work in providing security garnered positive attention from Heydrich, who then gave him additional organizational responsibilities, some of which later helped give birth to the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA) in 1939. The official SS personnel report on Schellenberg described him as &quot;open, irreproachable, and reliable&quot;; the file also depicted him as &quot;firm, tough, possesses energy&quot; and as &quot;very sharp thinking&quot;; his National Socialist worldview was labeled &quot;thoroughly fortified&quot;. Many of the SS street-brawling types despised men like Schellenberg, considering them effete, but for the most part Schellenberg made a good impression on the Nazi elite.

Sometime in 1938 Schellenberg married Käthe Kortekamp, a seamstress three years his senior, whom he dated for seven years and who had supported him through college. Their marriage proved brief, partially because of her social standing and because many things about her embarrassed him; the relationship ended in divorce in 1939, but only after Schellenberg promised her an &quot;aryanized&quot; fashion-business expropriated from Jewish owners. Shortly thereafter, he married a more socially-acceptable woman named Irene Grosse-Schönepauck, the daughter of an insurance executive, but this relationship was also troubled.

As the Nazis tightened their grip on German society, Hitler and &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Heinrich Himmler determined that the SS and police organs should merge, a move which Schellenberg fully supported: on 24 February 1939 he released a memorandum which advocated further centralization within the state. In summer 1939, Schellenberg became one of the directors of Heydrich&#x27;s foundation, the &quot;Stiftung Nordhav&quot;. Schellenberg was mentored by Herbert Mehlhorn while at the &quot;SS-Hauptamt&quot;. When Heydrich announced his intention to create the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA) in July 1939, he had Schellenberg to thank as both the organisation&#x27;s name and its existence resulted from his plans. On 27 September 1939, Himmler decreed the RSHA an official state organisation.

As the role of the SS and its action groups, the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot;, expanded in the war zones and prospective war zones in May 1941, Schellenberg negotiated with the Wehrmacht to acquire logistical support from the army (both on the front-line and in rear areas) so the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; could carry out their killing operations more effectively. Acting on behalf of Heydrich, Schellenberg issued a circular on 20 May 1941 to all segments of the German Security Police which forbade any Jews from emigrating out of German-controlled territory; this new policy formed part of the genocidal Final Solution. The language within the circular Schellenberg issued even contained the explicit expression: &quot;in view of the undoubtedly imminent Final Solution of the Jewish question&quot;, wording that makes it clear he was both complicit in and aware of the impending extermination activities. Despite being Heydrich&#x27;s direct subordinate, Schellenberg skillfully ingratiated himself with Himmler by first delivering his intelligence reports to him instead of to Heydrich, which earned him the &quot;Reichsführer&#x27;s&quot; confidence. After Heydrich&#x27;s death in June 1942, Schellenberg became the &quot;closest professional confidant&quot; of Himmler. Himmler bestowed upon Schellenberg a unique position beyond that of a simple aide, making him his special plenipotentiary (&quot;Sonderbevollmächtigter&quot;).

==SD operations==
When Walter Schellenberg moved to Frankfurt in 1934, he recalled meeting an SS-&quot;Oberführer&quot;, who explained to him the mission of the SD; he was told the following, which he wrote in his memoirs: 
::The SD was the chief organ of the intelligence service of the party. Its task was to inform the top Party leaders of all opposition movements and forces at home and abroad. It covered the administration, the Party, industry, the theatre, journalism, the police—in fact there was no sphere that was not under the watchful eye of the SD, no place where it did not seek out the first signs of opposition among movements or individuals &#x27;hostile&#x27; to the state&#x27;.
In March 1938, Schellenberg traveled with Himmler and Heydrich to Vienna for the impending &quot;Anschluss&quot; with Austria. One of the reasons for their journey was so the SD could &quot;confiscate Austrian secret service material.&quot; During the trip, Schellenberg allegedly saved Himmler from a potential mishap when he noticed that the aircraft door that he had been leaning against was not properly secured. Throwing Himmler aside in the process, Schellenberg earned the gratitude of the &quot;Reichsführer&quot;, who promised to reciprocate the favor if the chance ever presented itself. Following the exuberant reception of Hitler when he arrived in Vienna, Schellenberg later wrote, &quot;&#x27;never...have I seen such tremendous, enthusiastic and joyous crowds.&quot;

Much like Austria, the Nazis set their sights on the Sudetenland of Czechoslovakia, a region with over three million ethnic Germans which they wanted to incorporate into the Reich; more than that, Hitler once told his generals that he desired for Czechoslovakia to &quot;disappear from the map&quot;. In the summer of 1938, the Gestapo and &quot;SD-Ausland&quot;, which had taken control of the Secret Service in Czechoslovakia, helped the Sudeten Nazis from the &quot;Sudetendeutsche Partei&quot; infiltrate regional and local organizations, veterans groups, musical societies, sporting associations, sailing clubs, and cultural societies—which gave them insight into the economic, political, and military situation there. So thorough was the Nazi penetration in much of the Sudetenland, that Schellenberg stated later it was necessary to establish two telephone transmission stations along the frontier to communicate with Berlin. Eventually after strained negotiations with the West, Hitler acquired the Sudetenland when the Munich Agreement was concluded. Following this event, Schellenberg accompanied Hitler, Himmler, and Heydrich into Prague on 15 March 1939 and reported that Himmler was so pleased with the performance and racial makeup of the Czech police, that he incorporated them into the SS. 
In November 1939 Schellenberg played a major part in the Venlo Incident, which led to the capture of two British MI6 agents, Captain Sigismund Payne-Best and Major Richard Stevens. Schellenberg posed as a &quot;Major Schaemmel&quot; claiming to be part of an anti-Nazi group of officers planning a coup against Hitler. At Schellenberg&#x27;s third meeting with Stevens and Best in the German-Dutch border town of Venlo, the trap was sprung; the two British agents were captured. Hitler awarded Schellenberg the Iron Cross for his actions. Success in this operation helped the SD acquire greater leverage in foreign policy and gave their police Attachés access to foreign networks through the diplomatically immune offices of the German embassies abroad. The operation also damaged British morale and inclined them to mistrust the opposition in Germany.

In 1940, Schellenberg was sent to Portugal by Heydrich at Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop&#x27;s request to intercept the Duke and Duchess of Windsor and try to persuade them to work for Germany (&quot;Operation Willi&quot;). Ribbentrop believed that the former King Edward VIII, was open to making peace with the &quot;Reich&quot; in exchange for being allowed to regain his throne. The duke of Windsor was scheduled to leave Lisbon for the Bahamas where he had been appointed governor. Schellenberg was supposed to offer them 50 million Swiss francs to go to neutral Switzerland. However, Winston Churchill dispatched an attorney, Walter Monckton, an old friend of the Duke&#x27;s, to convince them to leave Portugal. Schellenberg planned to repeat the same operation used in Venlo to kidnap the duke and duchess of Windsor which added with &quot;psychologically adroit influence&quot; would in Schellenberg&#x27;s view cause the duke to declare himself for peace with Germany. Under Schellenberg&#x27;s plan, the duke and duchess would be invited to go hunting near the Portuguese-Spanish border, and then a corrupt Portuguese border official would allow a German team to cross over the frontier to kidnap the Windsors. The plan failed when the duke of Windsor declined the offer to go hunting. When it became clear that the duke of Windsor was going to leave Lisbon to take up his post as Governor of the Bahamas, Schellenberg tried hard to keep the duke from leaving. Schellenberg sent a bouquet of flowers to the duchess of Windsor along with a death threat, saying she and her husband would die if they went to the Bahamas. Schellenberg sent the duke of Windsor a list of all the Jews who would be sailing on the same ship that was to take him to the Bahamas along with a signed statement from the chief of the Portuguese counterespionage police that he could not guarantee the duke&#x27;s safety if he sailed on that ship. Finally, Schellenberg bribed the duke&#x27;s British chauffeur to talk to him about how dangerous it would be for him to go to the Bahamas. Despite all of Schellenberg&#x27;s efforts, the duke and duchess of Windsor left for the Bahamas. In the end, the mission was a failure; Schellenberg managed nothing more than a delay of the Duke&#x27;s baggage for a few hours. 

In June 1940, he was charged with compiling the &quot;Informationsheft G.B.&quot;, a blueprint for the occupation of Britain after a proposed invasion by Nazi Germany. The preparations for invasion, known as Operation Sea Lion (&quot;Unternehmen Seelöwe&quot;), were ultimately abandoned. He based his work on the interrogations of British agents Best and Stevens, along with his own &quot;preconceptions&quot;. Part of what he prepared was described as &quot;a handbook for German troops and officials as a guide to the British institutions they would encounter.&quot; The extent of his direct involvement in compiling the book and its supplement, however, has been disputed. The supplement was the &quot;Special Wanted List, GB&quot; (&quot;Sonderfahndungsliste G.B.&quot;, also known as &quot;The Black Book&quot;), which was a list of 2,300 prominent Britons to be arrested immediately after the successful invasion of Britain. Both Schellenberg and Heydrich perceived Great Britain as a country run by &quot;Freemasons, Jews, and a small public-school-trained elite.&quot; Despite the poor opinion of Britain shared by both men, their full attention was turned there when on 10 May 1941, Deputy Führer Rudolf Hess made his infamous flight to Scotland. Subsequently, SD Chief Schellenberg informed Hitler that Hess had been long under the influence of the British Secret Service and German collaborators. Upon further investigation, Schellenberg also reported to Hitler that Hess made his flight under the advice of an astrologer, which incited the activity of Heydrich who promptly arrested as many mediums, psychics, and astrologers he could round up in Berlin.

Besides reactive intelligence reports like those he provided concerning Hess, Schellenberg arranged numerous plots of subterfuge and intelligence gathering, including the bugging of Salon Kitty, a high-class Berlin brothel. Some of the Nazi regime&#x27;s upper echelons even visited this brothel unaware at first, such as Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop. However, intelligence collection efforts at Salon Kitty were essentially a failure as they never revealed anything significant.

Direct access to Himmler also made Schellenberg privy to some of the Reich&#x27;s most sensitive material. For example, Schellenberg knew early on about the arrangement between Germany and the Soviet Union concerning the partition of Poland, an agreement that presaged the military invasion. Once the Nazis invaded and occupied Polish territory, Schellenberg was entrusted with securing the rear areas by Himmler and Heydrich, which meant he oversaw the deployment of special commandos from the SD and Gestapo, units which carried out brutal measures against the Poles. Another one of his areas of responsibility was counter-espionage, both within Germany and the occupied territories—a task for which Schellenberg seemed well-suited given his penchant for intrigue. Operating as an intelligence adviser to Himmler in Poland meant Schellenberg was at the front edge of the spear, but this did not mean he was incapable of being surprised. In fact, he was particularly shocked at the utter devastation wrought by the Wehrmacht in Poland and commented in his &quot;Memoirs&quot; upon seeing it that, &quot;Until then I had no real conception of what total war meant.&quot;

In March 1940, he did help convince Hitler that Dutch military intelligence was working closely with the British intelligence services, which Hitler used as a pretext to attack the Netherlands &quot;for violating their neutrality.&quot;

In February, 1942, after the 1941 German attack on the Soviet Union had stalled, Schellenberg conceived and implemented a large-scale spy operation designed to penetrate into the Soviet Union, an initiative known as Operation Zeppelin (&quot;Unternehmen Zeppelin&quot;). Using anti-Communists selected from the many thousands of POWs captured by the Germans, he soon had anywhere from 10,000 to 15,000 potential candidates in training, who were accordingly indoctrinated. Only between 2,000 and 3,000 completed the training, and as little as a few hundred of them were ever committed to the operation due to insufficient numbers of aircraft and radio communication equipment. What started as a large-scale effort by Schellenberg, quickly became a precision one with very limited success. Most of them produced little to no useful intelligence and/or were killed once deployed. One German intelligence officer commented that if losses &quot;were not over 90 percent, we were satisfied.&quot;

In March 1942, Heinz Jost was fired as RSHA Chief of Amt VI, &quot;SD-Ausland&quot; (SD foreign intelligence). In his place, Schellenberg was appointed chief of &quot;SD-Ausland&quot; by Heydrich. Sometime in mid-1942, Schellenberg had been involved in planning operations in neutral Ireland including Operation Osprey: a plan involving No.1 SS Special Service Troop. Knowledge that Germany might lose the war prompted Schellenberg to open communication channels during the fall of 1942 with the Swiss intelligence chief, Colonel Roger Masson. He even went so far as providing Masson with a list of all the &quot;Abwehr&quot; (military intelligence) agents operating in Switzerland with the intention of &quot;having them expelled.&quot;

When the Allies invaded Italy in 1943, Schellenberg went to great lengths to ensure the safety of Amin al-Husseini, the anti-Semitic and anti-British Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, who was residing in Rome, by having him transported away to Berlin. As the Red Army repulsed the Germans and began driving their forces back towards the west, the German General Staff began planning a retreat into Fortress Europe which included the incorporation of Switzerland into the defensive operation. Using his previous channels to Schellenberg, the Swiss intelligence chief Masson, who was privy to this plan known as &quot;Case Switzerland&quot;, contacted Schellenberg as to whether or not an attack on Switzerland was imminent. By asking Schellenberg this question, Masson naively revealed to Schellenberg that a leak existed within Hitler&#x27;s headquarters, but it also meant the Germans lost the opportunity for a surprise attack against Switzerland. To further ingratiate himself to the Swiss, Schellenberg claimed that he had convinced the German high command of the needlessness for such an operation. Despite having direct contacts to Schellenberg himself, the Director in Switzerland of the OSS, Allen Dulles, expressed deep concern about the possible intelligence leaks between Masson and Schellenberg.

Signals intelligence intercepts alerted the Gestapo and SD to the &quot;Red Orchestra&quot;, the Soviet spy ring in Germany. Schellenberg led extensive efforts over many months to identify the participants. 116 were arrested by the Gestapo, half of whom were executed following intense interrogations. By this time, Schellenberg had become a general (&quot;Brigadeführer&quot;) in the &quot;Allgemeine-SS&quot; (General-SS). The operation was a major victory for the RSHA at the expense of the &quot;Abwehr&quot;, who had been oblivious to the Soviet operation. Historian Klaus Fischer asserts that Schellenberg&#x27;s &quot;only major success was smashing the Red Orchestra.&quot;

===Control of all intelligence operations===
Reportedly, Schellenberg and Wilhelm Canaris, the head of the &quot;Abwehr&quot;, were friends. They would go horseback-riding together in Berlin&#x27;s wooded Grunewald, where they discussed the future of Nazi Germany. Often present at these equestrian outings were Heydrich and Werner Best. Their alleged friendship aside, Canaris was careful around Schellenberg, a man whose ambitions included controlling all intelligence for the Reich. Like Heydrich, Schellenberg ultimately envisioned a centrally directed &quot;all-embracing security system&quot; and a singular &quot;Greater German Intelligence Service&quot; under direct Nazi control (unlike the &quot;Abwehr&quot;, which was part of the Wehrmacht). Nonetheless, there are indications that Schellenberg preferred to deal with Canaris&#x27; &quot;Abwehr&quot; over the Gestapo, particularly since he distrusted its chief, Heinrich Müller. However, after the attempted assassination of Hitler on 20 July 1944, the &quot;Abwehr&quot; was dissolved and the SD was given additional powers over intelligence across the Reich. Canaris was arrested on 23 July 1944 on the basis of the interrogation of his successor at military intelligence, Georg Hansen.

As a result, sections of the &quot;Abwehr&quot; were incorporated into RSHA Amt VI &quot;SD-Ausland&quot; and therefore placed under Schellenberg&#x27;s command. Assumption of these powers made Schellenberg the &quot;absolute master&quot; of Nazi intelligence&quot;. He was infamous for his &quot;office fortress&quot; desk, which had two automatic guns built into it that could be fired by the touch of a button. According to the memoirs of SS intelligence officer Wilhelm Hoettl, Schellenberg was very suspicious of Gestapo Chief Müller, whom he claimed to have evidence against by way of radio surveillance recordings (allegedly revealing Müller&#x27;s plans to work with the Soviets); when he informed then RSHA chief Ernst Kaltenbrunner of possessing proof to that end, he was ignored. Kaltenbrunner disliked Schellenberg, perhaps due to his direct access to Himmler, and complained about him in particular on a number of occasions. Despite Kaltenbrunner&#x27;s animosity towards Schellenberg, the latter&#x27;s soothing manners kept him in good graces with Himmler and allowed him to &quot;retain the ear of the SS overlord&quot;.

===Operation Modellhut===
Allied military intelligence documents have been unearthed linking French couturier Coco Chanel to espionage activity in concert with Schellenberg, who reportedly was also one of her romantic liaisons. In 1943–1944, Operation Modellhut (Operation Model Hat) was conceived to capitalize on Chanel&#x27;s long-standing associations with British aristocracy and her friendship with Winston Churchill. Schellenberg recruited Chanel to act as an intermediary in a plan (proposed by Chanel) whose goal was to broker a separate peace between Nazi Germany and Britain independently of other Allied powers; Operation Modellhut failed.

==Peace negotiations and capture==

During early 1945, Schellenberg encouraged Himmler to overthrow Hitler in order to negotiate a separate peace with the Western Allies, using as an excuse Hitler&#x27;s poor health; however, Himmler never took action, but instead vacillated. He also convinced Himmler to meet with the former president of Switzerland, Jean-Marie Musy, who promised to pay in Swiss francs for the release of Jews. At the end of the war, Schellenberg was able to persuade Himmler to try negotiating with the Western Allies through Count Folke Bernadotte. Schellenberg had earlier in the year worked as an intermediary between Count Bernadotte and Himmler for the release and safe passage of a number of prisoners and inmates held in concentration camps through the Swedish Red Cross.

In the spring of 1945, Schellenberg instigated further meetings with Count Bernadotte as an opening to the western powers. He personally went to Stockholm in April 1945 to arrange the meetings for Himmler. Both Himmler and Schellenberg continued to believe that the Jews interned in concentration camps represented a bargaining chip for the Nazi leadership: one they could use to derive concessions from the Western allies. To foster goodwill for their negotiations, Schellenberg—with Himmler&#x27;s consent—organised the transport of 1,700 Jews out of German-controlled territory to Switzerland and Sweden. Hitler found out and put a stop to further evacuations.

After the first set of failed meetings, Schellenberg requested Bernadotte to intercede directly with General Eisenhower but this final action proved futile as well. At war&#x27;s end, Schellenberg was in Denmark attempting to arrange his own surrender when the British took him into custody in June 1945. That same month, a Swedish dispatch reported that Schellenberg had &quot;confessed&quot; to Germany&#x27;s complicity in the massacre of Polish officers at the Katyn forest. According to Schellenberg, the Germans then blamed the Soviets for the atrocity in an effort to split the allies. 

The U.S., British, and Soviet intelligence services had all been searching for him as a valuable intelligence asset. Captain Horace Hahn, a member of the OSS, was one of the few Americans allowed to interrogate Schellenberg. Looking to recover as much information as they could from Schellenberg, the British sent him to London in July 1945 where he was extensively interrogated; their intention (along with the Americans) was to extract information on any remaining Nazi resistance yet to surface and to gather what they could on Germany&#x27;s possible postwar intelligence activities. Schellenberg confirmed to the Allies that no such plans were in place, which was supported by Allied intelligence efforts. The fact that Schellenberg had been on the opposite side of the RSHA faction which included Kaltenbrunner, Müller, Ohlendorf and Skorzeny, along with other war criminals, was the &quot;best thing&quot; he had going for him at the end of the war. Additional independent signals intelligence also proved helpful in evaluating Schellenberg.

==Nuremberg trials==
After the war, Schellenberg was arrested by British military police and eventually stood trial in Nuremberg. To spare himself from a long prison sentence, Schellenberg testified against the SS organisation and the Nazi leaders in its fold during the postwar trials. During the Ministries Trial, he wrote his memoirs, titled &quot;The Labyrinth&quot;. Historian Robert Gerwarth describes certain content of Schellenberg&#x27;s memoirs as &quot;questionable.&quot; On 4 November 1949, he was sentenced to six years in prison for failing to prevent the murder of Soviet POWs who were utilized as agents in Operation Zeppelin. The tribunal found that near the end of the war, Schellenberg had started aiding victims of the Nazi regime. It questioned whether he was acting out of good faith, but nevertheless credited him for his actions. He was released from prison after two years on the grounds of ill-health, due to a worsening liver condition, and moved to Switzerland, before settling in Verbania-Pallanza, Italy. In 1952, he died in Turin, Italy.

<text>Major General Count Albert-Marie Edmond Guérisse (5 April 1911 – 26 March 1989) was a Belgian Resistance member who organized French and Belgian escape routes for downed Allied pilots during World War II under the alias of Patrick Albert &quot;Pat&quot; O&#x27;Leary, purportedly the name of a peace-time Canadian friend. His escape line was dubbed the Pat O&#x27;Leary Line.

==Biography==

Guérisse was born in Brussels, and qualified in medicine at the Université Libre de Bruxelles before joining the Belgian Army. Guérisse was Médecin-Capitaine with a Belgian cavalry regiment during their eighteen-day campaign in May 1940. He managed to escape to England through Dunkirk. At Gibraltar, he joined the crew of a former French merchant ship, &quot;Le Rhin&quot;, which was later renamed and served in the Mediterranean on clandestine missions. He secured entry into the British Royal Navy and was commissioned as Lieutenant Commander Patrick Albert O&#x27;Leary RNVR of French-Canadian origin. The &quot;Canadian&quot; identity attempted to explain his not-quite British accent in English, and his not-quite French accent in French, in order to protect his family in occupied Belgium if he was captured. He had a six-week undercover training session with Naval Intelligence. Until April 1941, he was serving mainly as a conducting officer, escorting agents ashore in small boats through the surf, whilst the large vessel lay some distance offshore. This was skilled work, exposed to physical dangers from the sea-conditions and operational dangers from the Vichy security services.

On 25 April 1941, during a mission to place Special Operations Executive (SOE) agents in Collioure, on Roussillon coast in southern France, &quot;O&#x27;Leary&quot; and three crewmen from HMS &quot;Fidelity&quot; were arrested by the Vichy French coast guard and taken to a camp for British military prisoners at Saint-Hippolyte-du-Fort near Nîmes. Helped by &#x27;fellow British&#x27; officers, &quot;O&#x27;Leary&quot; escaped in early June 1941. He went to Marseilles where there was an escape organisation run by a British Army officer, Ian Grant Garrow, and soon made contact. At this point his intention was make his way to Gibraltar and resume his original naval service. Events were to dictate otherwise because Garrow wanted &quot;O&#x27;Leary&quot; to stay and help with the organisation since he had undercover training and, unlike Garrow, spoke French fluently. Consequently, a request was sent to London that he stay, which was approved and confirmed by a BBC radio message received on 2 July 1941. &quot;O&#x27;Leary&quot; immediately began his job : within a four-month period, he helped about fifty men escape from the prison of St Hippolyte du Fort, then moved them down the line back to England through the Pyrenees.

When the Vichy France authorities captured Garrow in October 1941, Guérisse took over as chief of the escape network. Along with others, including Nancy Wake, he smuggled a guard uniform to Garrow in his cell in Mauzac prison camp, which helped Garrow&#x27;s escape on 6 December 1942. At this point the British decided it was time for Garrow to return to London, so &quot;O&#x27;Leary&quot; continued in command and expanded the reach of the escape line&#x27;s operations. The line carried over 600 escapees to Spain and back to Britain.

In January 1943, the escape line was infiltrated and betrayed by a French turncoat, Roger le Neveu; Guérisse was arrested in Toulouse on 6 March 1943. En route to prison he managed to get one of the younger members, Fabien de Cortes, to escape and warn the British. After his arrest the line was taken over by Marie Dissard. Guérisse told nothing to the Gestapo interrogators even while being tortured. He then was sent to a series of concentration camps, including Mauthausen. No one, neither in the network, nor the French police nor the Gestapo, ever knew &quot;O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s&quot; true identity.

In the summer of 1944, he was at the Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp in Alsace with another SOE agent, Brian Stonehouse. At the camp he witnessed the arrival of four other female SOE agents, Andrée Borrel, Vera Leigh, Diana Rowden, and Sonya Olschanezky, who were all executed and disposed of in the crematorium in an attempt to make them disappear without a trace, under the &quot;Night and Fog&quot; programme. After the war, Guérisse and Stonehouse were able to testify at the Nazi war crimes trials as to the women&#x27;s fate.

Finally, Guérisse was taken to the Dachau concentration camp, tortured again and then sentenced to death. However, when SS guards surrendered before the Allied advance, Guérisse took command and refused to leave until the Allies agreed to take care of the inmates. On 30 April 1945, he was chosen as the first president of the International Prisoners&#x27; Committee that administered the camp after liberation.

From its founding in 1956 until his death he served many terms as president of the Comité International de Dachau, and regularly gave the keynote speech at the May memorial ceremonies.

In 1946, he was appointed a member of the War Crime Commission at Nuremberg. In November 1946 he was demobilized from the Royal Navy and resumed his real name and rejoined the Belgian Army, returning to his former regiment. In 1951, he volunteered as a medical officer for the Belgian United Nations Corps in Korea during the Korean War where he was wounded while going to rescue a wounded soldier under enemy fire. He became the head of the medical service of the Belgian Army and retired in 1970, in the rank of major general.

==Personal life==

In his personal life, he married Sylvia Cooper-Smith in 1947; they had a son, Patrick. Sylvia Guérisse predeceased her husband.

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in November 1963 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the BBC Television Theatre.

==Awards and decorations==

General Guérisse received 37 decorations, from a variety of nations. In 1946, the British recognised his war service with the award of the George Cross. This was the highest possible award of the British Commonwealth nations for actions not in combat and only the Victoria Cross (the equivalent award for bravery in actual combat) takes precedence.

In the UK it is the convention for the post-nominal letters for both these awards to be appended to the surname even for general usage, i.e. to refer to: &#x27;Guérisse, GC&#x27;. Recognising his military service as a whole, the British later also conferred on Albert-Marie Guérisse, GC, an honorary knighthood (KBE).

Similarly, the King of Belgium recognised the lifetime service of General Guérisse with the grant of a peerage in 1989, in the rank of Count. His motto: &quot;Honores non-quaero, fidelis sum&quot; (&quot;Honors I do not seek, faithful I am&quot;).

==Death==
General Count Albert-Marie Guérisse died in Waterloo, Belgium on 26 March 1989, aged 77.

<text>Joseph Darnand (19 March 1897 – 10 October 1945) was a French far-right political figure, Nazi collaborator and convicted war criminal during the Second World War. A decorated veteran of the First World War and the Battle of France in 1940, he later pledged allegiance to Nazi Germany, joining the Waffen-SS on 8 August 1943.

Darnand was the de facto leader of the Milice française, a fascist paramilitary organisation established under the Vichy regime to combat the French Resistance, persecute Jews, and enforce forced labour drafts. On 1 January 1944, at the request of the German authorities, he was appointed Secretary General for Law and Order, before becoming Secretary of State for the Interior on 14 June 1944.

Following the liberation of France, he was arrested, tried for treason, sentenced to death, and executed by firing squad on 10 October 1945.

==Early years and war service==

Darnand was born at Coligny, Ain, Rhône-Alpes in France.

On 8 January 1916, he enlisted in the 35th Infantry Regiment. He was promoted to corporal in April 1917, sergeant on 1 June 1917 and to adjutant (warrant officer) in 1918. He volunteered for a squadron that undertook dangerous missions. For his efforts in July 1918 penetrating German lines in the Champagne sector with a small force that captured prisoners and secured information about a forthcoming German offensive, &quot;Darnand emerged a major war hero.&quot;

Demobilised after the armistice, he again enlisted for two years in the army in September 1919. After a stint in the army of occupation in Germany, he participated in the campaign against the forces of Kemal Atatürk in Cilicia. He ended his service in July 1921 as a sub-lieutenant (second lieutenant). He worked as a cabinetmaker and later founded his own transportation company in Nice.

Between the wars, Darnand joined a number of far-right political, paramilitary organizations: &quot;l&#x27;Action Française&quot; in 1925, the &quot;Croix-de-Feu&quot; in 1928, &quot;La Cagoule&quot; and Jacques Doriot&#x27;s French Popular Party (PPF) in 1936. He formed his own Fascist outfit, the &quot;Chevaliers du Glaive&quot; (Knights of the Sword); in the 1930s he became prominent among La Cagoule, or the &quot;Cagoulards&quot; (&quot;Hooded Men&quot;), a secret terrorist group that organised bombings and assassinations, and that stored arms in depots all over France.

==Vichy collaborator==

At the beginning of World War II, Darnand volunteered to join the French Army and was commissioned as a lieutenant. He served in the Maginot Line and was decorated for bravery. During the Phoney War, Darnand took part in several commando actions against German forces. He was captured in June 1940, but fled to Nice. He became a leading figure in the Vichy French organization &quot;Légion française des combattants&quot; (French Legion of Veterans) and recruited troopers for the fight against &quot;Bolshevism&quot;.

In 1941, Darnand was made a member of the National Council of Vichy France. The same year, he founded the collaborationist militia, &quot;Service d&#x27;ordre légionnaire&quot; (SOL), that supported Philippe Pétain and Vichy France. He offered his help against the French Resistance. On 1 January 1943 he transformed the organization into the Milice. Although Pierre Laval was its official president, Darnand was its &quot;de facto&quot; leader. Darnand&#x27;s political convictions were of the far right but he was known as a Germanophobe. Nonetheless, his views toward Nazi Germany changed. By the spring of 1941, Darnand had told a friend that &quot;France had been wrong to fight Germany in 1939.&quot; Germany&#x27;s assault on the Soviet Union in June 1941 &quot;reinforced Darnand&#x27;s evolution toward collaboration.&quot;

==SS officer==

Darnand turned to Nazi Germany and was made an officer of the SS. Darnand&#x27;s turn to the SS was also influenced by the fact that &quot;miliciens&quot; were being targeted for assassination by the Resistance but Vichy and Wehrmacht authorities refused to arm the Milice.

In joining the SS, Darnand took a personal oath of loyalty to Adolf Hitler, receiving a rank of &quot;Untersturmführer&quot; (Second Lieutenant) in the Waffen SS in August 1943. 

In December 1943, he became head of police and later secretary of the interior. Joseph Darnand expanded the Milice and by 1944 it had over 35,000 members. The organization played an important role in investigating the French Resistance; as time progressed it &quot;became ever more unrestrained,&quot; carrying out assassinations, chasing resisters, and &quot;enthusiastically ... rounding up Jews.&quot; 

In early 1944, Vichy France announced a new law empowering Darnand &quot;to create special courts martial to try on the spot&quot; persons caught in violent acts against the state. The law was &quot;without precedent in modern French legal history.&quot; The Milice also aided German forces in combat against the Resistance, and Darnand himself commanded a Milice unit in March 1944 near Lyons that flushed out some &quot;maquisards&quot; (French Resistance guerilla fighters). After the Normandy Invasion and Allied advance, Darnand fled to Germany in September 1944 and joined the pro-Nazi puppet government in the Sigmaringen enclave. He received a promotion to &quot;Sturmbannführer&quot; on 1 November 1944.

==Capture, trial and execution==

In April 1945, he fled from Sigmaringen to Merano in northern Italy. The British captured him in Italy on 25 June 1945 and took him back to France. Like some other collaboration leaders, Darnand was found guilty of collaboration with the enemy. He was sentenced to death on 3 October 1945 and executed by firing squad on 10 October 1945 at the Fort de Châtillon in Paris.

<text>John Banvard (November 15, 1815 – May 16, 1891) was a panorama and portrait painter known for his panoramic views of the Mississippi River Valley. He was a pioneer in moving panoramic paintings.

==Biography==
John Banvard was born in New York and was educated in high school. When his father went bankrupt, he began to travel around the United States, and supported himself with paintings he exhibited.

In 1840, he began to paint large panoramas of the whole Mississippi River valley. He traveled through the area in a boat, made preliminary drawings and supported himself with paintings and hunting. He combined the preliminary sketches and transferred them to a canvas in a building erected for this purpose in Louisville, Kentucky. His largest panorama began as 12 feet (3,6 m) high and 1,300 feet (369 m) long and was eventually expanded to about half a mile (about 800 meters) although it was advertised as a &quot;three-mile canvas&quot;. It toured around the nation, and was eventually cut up into hundreds of pieces, none of which still exist today.

&quot;Scientific American&quot; magazine published a piece under &quot;New Inventions&quot; in its issue of December 16, 1848, describing and illustrating Banvard&#x27;s mechanism for displaying a moving panorama.

He premiered his panorama of the Mississippi in Boston in December 1846. After a run of nearly a year, he took the production to New York City and then to Europe, Asia, and Africa and even gave Queen Victoria a private viewing. His portrait was painted in 1849 by the English artist Anna Mary Howitt. 
During his travels, he also painted panoramas in Palestine and the Nile River Valley.

Banvard had a rivalry with panorama performers John Rowson Smith and Richard Risley Carlisle. Banvard called them imitators and &quot;unprincipled persons&quot;. They in turn referred to the &quot;crude efforts of the uncultivated artist&quot; Banvard. Banvard suggested that Smith and Carlisle&#x27;s panorama was actually painted by George Catlin, who had copied the image after his own panorama.

On his return he invested part of the fortune he had made in overlooking Cold Spring Harbor on the North Shore of Long Island, where in 1852-55, in competition with P. T. Barnum&#x27;s palace &quot;Iranistan&quot; in Bridgeport, Connecticut, he proceeded to design and have built a baronial residence from its eastern shore, which, it was given out, was intended to resemble Windsor Castle; he named the place Glenada, the glen of his daughter Ada, but the locals called it &quot;Banvard&#x27;s Folly&quot;. After his death it became a fashionable resort hotel, The Glenada.

In 1875, he published in the U.S.A. a book &quot;The Private Life of a King&quot; which in large parts was plagiarised from one published some years earlier in the United Kingdom.

During World War 2, a Liberty ship was named the S.S. &quot;John Banvard&quot;.

The Brooklyn-based history band Pinataland recorded a song about Banvard&#x27;s travails for their 2008 album &quot;Songs for the Forgotten Future Vol. 2&quot;.

In 2016, a new musical entitled &quot;Georama: An American Panorama Told on Three Miles of Canvas&quot; premiered at the Repertory Theatre of St. Louis. The musical tells Banvard&#x27;s life story through his rise and fall as an artist, his conflict with P. T. Barnum and love for his wife Elizabeth. Georama was written by West Hyler, Matt Schatz, and Jack Herrick. It premiered in 2017 on August 2 through 6th at New York Musical Theatre Festival, and starred PJ Griffith, Jillian Louis, Randy Blair, and Nick Sullivan.

<text>The 250th Infantry Division (), better known as the Blue Division (, ), was a unit of volunteers from Francoist Spain operating from 1941 to 1943 within the German Army () on the Eastern Front during World War II. It was officially designated the Spanish Volunteer Division () by the Spanish Army.

Francisco Franco had secured power in Spain after the Nationalist victory in the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), during which the Nationalists received support from Nazi Germany. Franco&#x27;s authoritarian regime remained officially non-belligerent in World War II but sympathised with the Axis powers. After lobbying by the Spanish Foreign Minister Ramón Serrano Suñer and by senior figures within the Spanish Army following the 22 June 1941 launch of Operation Barbarossa, Franco agreed that Spanish people would be permitted to enlist privately in the German Army and undertook to provide tacit support. An infantry division was raised from Falangist and Spanish Army cadres and was sent for training in Germany. The unit fought on the Eastern Front, in the 1941–1944 siege of Leningrad, notably in the Battle of Krasny Bor. They eventually withdrew from the front after Allied political pressure on Spain in October 1943 and returned to Spain shortly afterwards. Several thousand non-returners were incorporated into the 121st Infantry Division, the short-lived Blue Legion, and eventually into the Waffen-SS.

==Background==
Francisco Franco took power at the head of a coalition of fascist, monarchist, and conservative political factions in the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939) against the left-leaning Spanish government supported by communist and anarchist factions. More than 300,000 people were killed, and lasting damage was done to the country&#x27;s economy.

Franco had been supported by National Socialist Party of Germany and Italian Socialist Party of Italy during the Civil War and Franco sympathised with many aspects of fascist ideology, especially its anti-communism.
On the other side, the republican army had been supported by Soviet aid.
Franco ensured that Spain was neutral at the start of World War II but seriously contemplated joining the conflict as a German ally in the aftermath of the Fall of France in 1940. He met Adolf Hitler on 23–24 October 1940 at Hendaye but was unable to gain promises that Spain would gain colonial territories from France in North Africa. Hitler feared delegitimizing the new Vichy regime in France. Ultimately, Spain remained neutral.

==Formation==

The German invasion of the Soviet Union led to renewed interest in participating in what Spanish officials saw as an &quot;anti-communist crusade&quot;. Within hours of the invasion on 22 June 1941, Foreign Minister Ramón Serrano Suñer first proposed to Franco the idea of a Spanish contribution, publicly declaring the Soviet Union guilty of the Spanish Civil War. Senior officers of the Spanish Army supported the proposal. Franco soon agreed to the proposal, directing that the Spanish Army should unofficially co-ordinate the formation of the unit. Although disappointed that Spain had not declared war on the Soviet Union, the German regime accepted the Spanish offer on 24 June 1941. Franco struggled to balance the demands of the Spanish Army and Falangist factions, both of which attempted to influence the new unit, himself siding with the former.

Recruitment began on 27 June 1941 and 18,373 men had volunteered by 2 July 1941 from within the Spanish Army and Falangist movement. Fifty per cent of officers and NCOs were professional soldiers given leave from the Spanish Army, including many veterans of the Spanish Civil War. The division was made up mainly of Falangist volunteers and almost a fifth of early volunteers were students. General Agustín Muñoz Grandes was assigned to lead the volunteers. Because the soldiers could not use official Spanish Army uniforms, they adopted a symbolic uniform comprising the red berets of the Carlists, the khaki trousers of the Spanish Legion, and the blue shirts of the Falangists—hence the nickname &quot;Blue Division.&quot; This uniform was used only while on leave in Spain; in the field, soldiers wore the German Army field grey uniform () with a shield on the upper right sleeve bearing the word &quot;&quot; and the Nationalist Spanish national colours.

==Operational history==
===Organization and training===

On 13 July 1941 the first train left Madrid for Grafenwöhr, Bavaria for a further five weeks of training. There they became the German Army&#x27;s 250th Infantry Division and were initially divided into four infantry regiments, as in a standard Spanish division. To aid their integration into the German supply system, they soon adopted the standard German model of three regiments. One of the original regiments was dispersed amongst the others, which were then named after three of the Spanish cities that volunteers largely originated from—Madrid, Valencia and Seville. Each regiment had three battalions (of four companies each) and two weapons companies, supported by an artillery regiment of four battalions (of three batteries each). There were enough men left over to create an assault battalion, mainly armed with submachine guns. Later, due to casualties, this unit was disbanded. Aviator volunteers formed a Blue Squadron (&quot;Escuadrillas Azules&quot;) which, using Messerschmitt Bf 109s and Focke-Wulf Fw 190s, claimed to have shot down 156 Soviet aircraft.

===Eastern Front===
On 31 July, after taking the Hitler Oath, the Blue Division was formally incorporated into the German Wehrmacht as the 250th Division. It was initially assigned to Army Group Center, the force advancing towards Moscow. The division was transported by train to Suwałki, Poland (August 28), from where it had to continue by foot on a march. It was scheduled to travel through Grodno, and Lida in Belarus, Vilnius (Lithuania), and Maladzyechna, Minsk, and Orsha in Belarus to Smolensk, and from there to the Moscow front. While marching towards the Smolensk front on September 26, the Spanish volunteers were rerouted from Vitebsk and reassigned to Army Group North (the force closing on Leningrad), becoming part of the German 16th Army. The Blue Division was first deployed on the Volkhov River front, with its headquarters in Grigorovo, on the outskirts of Novgorod. It was in charge of a section of the front north and south of Novgorod, along the banks of the Volkhov River and Lake Ilmen.

The division&#x27;s soldiers used the iconostasis of the Church of Saint Theodore Stratelates on the Brook for firewood. The iconostases of the Cathedral of St. Sophia, Sts. Peter and Paul Church in Kozhevniki, and the Cathedral of the Nativity of the Mother of God in the Antoniev Monastery were taken to Germany at the end of 1943. According to the museum curator in the Church of the Transfiguration on Ilyina Street, the division used the high cupola as a machine-gun nest. As a result, much of the building was seriously damaged, including many of the medieval icons by Theophanes the Greek. Vladimir Kovalevskii, one of the division&#x27;s White Russian emigre interpreters, left a particularly acerbic memoir account describing the low discipline and the crimes committed by the Spanish volunteers.

In August 1942, the Blue Division was transferred north to the southeastern flank of the siege of Leningrad, just south of the Neva River near Pushkin, Kolpino and Krasny Bor in the Izhora River area. After the collapse of the German southern front following the Battle of Stalingrad, more German troops were deployed southwards. By this time, General Emilio Esteban Infantes had taken command. The Blue Division faced a major Soviet attempt to break the siege of Leningrad in February 1943, when the Soviet 55th Army, reinvigorated after the victory at Stalingrad, attacked the Spanish positions at the Battle of Krasny Bor, near the main Moscow-Leningrad road. Despite very heavy casualties, the Spaniards were able to hold their ground against a Soviet force seven times larger and supported by tanks. The assault was contained and the siege of Leningrad was maintained for a further year. The division remained on the Leningrad front where it continued to suffer heavy casualties due to weather and to enemy action.

The Blue Division was the only component of the German Army to be awarded a medal of its own, commissioned by Hitler in January 1944 after the Division had demonstrated its effectiveness in impeding the advance of the Red Army. Hitler referred to the division as &quot;equal to the best German ones&quot;. During his table talks, he said: &quot;...the Spaniards have never yielded an inch of ground. One can&#x27;t imagine more fearless fellows. They scarcely take cover. They flout death. I know, in any case, that our men are always glad to have Spaniards as neighbours in their sector&quot;.

===Disbandment and the Blue Legion===
Eventually, the Allies and many Spaniards began to press Franco to withdraw troops from the quasi alliance with Germany. Franco initiated negotiations in the spring of 1943 and gave an order to withdraw on October 10. Some Spanish volunteers refused to return. On 3 November 1943 the Spanish government ordered all troops to return to Spain. In the end, the total of &quot;non-returners&quot; was close to 3,000 men, mostly Falangists. Spaniards also joined other German units, and fresh volunteers slipped across the Spanish border near Lourdes in occupied France. The new pro-German Spanish units were collectively called the &quot;Legión Azul&quot; (&quot;Blue Legion&quot;).

Spaniards initially remained part of the 121st Infantry Division, but even this meagre force was ordered to return home in March 1944, and was transported back to Spain on March 21. The rest of the volunteers were absorbed into German units. Platoons of Spaniards served in the 3rd Mountain Division and the 357th Infantry Division. One unit was sent to Latvia. Two companies joined the Brandenburger Regiment and German 121st Division in Nazi security warfare in Yugoslavia. The 101st Company (&quot;Spanische-Freiwilligen Kompanie der SS 101&quot;, &quot;Spanish Volunteer Company of the SS Number 101&quot;) of 140 men, made up of four rifle platoons and one staff platoon, was attached to 28th SS Volunteer Grenadier Division Wallonien.

Through rotation, as many as 45,000 Spanish soldiers served on the Eastern Front. The casualties of the Blue Division and its successors included 4,954 men killed and 8,700 wounded. Another 372 members of the Blue Division, the Blue Legion, or volunteers of the &quot;Spanische-Freiwilligen Kompanie der SS 101&quot; were taken prisoner by the Red Army; 286 of these men remained in captivity until 2 April 1954, when they returned to Spain aboard the ship &quot;Semiramis&quot;, supplied by the International Red Cross. In action against the Red Army, the Blue Division suffered 22,700 casualties, while inflicting 49,300 casualties.
==After the war==
Hundreds of Blue Division prisoners of war were held by the Soviet authorities.
While most prisoners from other nations would be repatriated after the war, Francoist Spain and the Soviet Union did not have diplomatic relations. Soviet camps held together staunch anti-Communist prisoners, those who collaborated with the Soviets either by their previous hidden ideology or after captivity and even those Republican sailors whose Spanish ships had been requisitioned after the fall of the Republic. In 1954, after the death of Stalin, the French Red Cross arranged the ship to bring those prisoners who desired repatriation to Barcelona.

== Portuguese volunteers ==
Like Spain, Portugal under the Salazar regime remained neutral during World War II in agreement with the United Kingdom in accordance to the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1373 and more openly sympathized with Western Allies. There was some popular anti-communist sentiment, and 150 Portuguese volunteers served unofficially in the Blue Division. However, most had roots in Spain or had already fought on the Francoist side in the Viriatos division during the Spanish Civil War. The Portuguese served in Spanish units and had no separate national presence.

==War cemetery==
1,900 soldiers of the Blue Division are buried in the war cemetery in Veliky Novgorod.

<text>The Blue Legion (; ), officially called the Spanish Volunteer Legion (; ), was a volunteer legion created from 2,133 falangist volunteers who remained behind at the Eastern Front after most of the Spanish Blue Division was withdrawn in October 1943 because Francisco Franco had started negotiations with the Allies. It officially consisted of two battalions. It was later estimated that the legion grew to over 3,000 Spaniards.

A certain number of Spanish volunteers refused to return to Spain and remained on the Eastern Front, integrated into different German units. Some of them would continue to fight until the end of World War II. The 101st SS Spanish Volunteer Company () of 140 men, composed of four rifle platoons and one staff platoon, was attached to the 28th SS Volunteer Grenadier Division &quot;Wallonien&quot; (the Walloon Legion) and fought against the Soviets in Pomerania and Brandenburg. Under the command of Miguel Ezquerra, remnants of the legion defended Berlin against an overwhelming Soviet assault from April-May 1945. They fought in and around the central government district of Berlin (&quot;Zitadelle&quot; sector), which included the Reich Chancellery and the Reichstag, being among the last defenders of the &quot;Führerbunker&quot;. 

The troops bore the word &quot;ESPAÑA&quot; and a red/yellow/yellow/red horizontally striped shield worn on the upper right arm, and a helmet.

<text>Josef &quot;Sepp&quot; Dietrich (28 May 1892 – 21 April 1966) was a German politician and a general in the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) during the Nazi era. He joined the Nazi Party in 1928 and was elected to the Reichstag of the Weimar Republic in 1930. Prior to 1929, Dietrich was Adolf Hitler&#x27;s chauffeur and bodyguard. 

Despite having no formal staff officer training, Dietrich was, along with Paul Hausser, the highest-ranking officer in the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;, the military branch of the SS. Reaching the rank of &quot;SS-Oberst-Gruppenführer&quot;, he commanded units up to army level during World War II. As commanding officer of the 6th Panzer Army during the Battle of the Bulge, Dietrich bore responsibility for the Malmedy massacre, the murder of U.S. prisoners of war in December 1944. 

After the war, an American military tribunal convicted Dietrich of war crimes at the Malmedy massacre trial. Upon his release from Landsberg Prison in 1955, Dietrich became active in HIAG, a lobby group established by former high-ranking &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; personnel. He died in 1966.
==Early life==
Josef &quot;Sepp&quot; Dietrich was born on 28 May 1892 in Hawangen, near Memmingen in the Kingdom of Bavaria, German Empire. 

A butcher’s apprentice, Dietrich joined the Bavarian Army with the 4. &quot;Bayerische Feldartillerie-Regiment &quot;König&quot;&quot; (4th Bavarian Field Artillery Regiment &quot;King&quot;) in Augsburg. In the First World War he served with the Bavarian field artillery. He was promoted to &quot;Gefreiter&quot; (Corporal) in 1917 and awarded the Iron Cross 2nd class. In 1918 he was promoted to &quot;Unteroffizier&quot; (Sergeant). His last Bavarian Army record lists Dietrich as recipient of the Iron Cross 1st class.

==Interwar period==

===In the Weimar Republic===
After the Great War ended, Dietrich worked at several jobs, including policeman and customs officer. He joined the Freikorps and fought against Polish insurgents during the Silesian Uprisings, but lost his job as a police officer due to his suspected involvement in the Beer Hall Putsch. Dietrich joined the Nazi Party (NSDAP) in 1928, then was hired at Eher Verlag, the NSDAP publisher, and became commander of Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) bodyguard. His NSDAP number was 89,015 and his SS number was 1,117. Dietrich had been introduced to Nazism by Christian Weber, who had been his employer at the &quot;Tankstelle-Blauer-Bock&quot; filling station in Munich. He accompanied Hitler on his tours around Germany. Later Hitler arranged other jobs for him, including various SS posts, and let him live in the Reich Chancellery. At the election of 14 September 1930, he was elected to the &quot;Reichstag&quot; as a Nazi Party deputy. He would remain in the &quot;Reichstag&quot; until the fall of the Nazi regime, representing several different electoral districts: Lower Bavaria–Swabia (&quot;Wahlkreis&quot; #24, to 1933), Upper Bavaria (#25, to 1936) and Frankfurt/Oder (#5, to 1945).
By 1931, Dietrich had been promoted to &quot;SS-Gruppenführer&quot;. When the Nazi Party seized power in 1933, he rose swiftly through the hierarchy. At the end of 1933, Prussian Minister President Hermann Göring appointed Dietrich to the recently reconstituted Prussian State Council, where he would continue to serve until 1945. Responsible for Hitler&#x27;s personal security detail since February 1932, Dietrich became the commander of the &quot;SS–Sonderkommando Berlin&quot; (SS–Special Command Unit Berlin) on 2 August 1933. This special bodyguard unit was renamed &quot;Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler&quot; (LSSAH) on 13 April 1934. As one of Hitler&#x27;s intimates, Dietrich was often able to disregard his SS superior, Heinrich Himmler, at one time even banning Himmler from the &quot;Leibstandarte&quot; barracks. The LSSAH eventually grew into an elite division of the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;. Although the unit was nominally under Himmler, Dietrich was the real commander and handled day-to-day administration.

In the summer of 1934, Dietrich played a key role in the Night of the Long Knives. Hitler, along with Dietrich and a unit from the &quot;Leibstandarte&quot;, travelled to Bad Wiessee to personally oversee Ernst Röhm&#x27;s arrest on 30 June. Later, at approximately 17:00 hours, Dietrich received orders from Hitler for the &quot;Leibstandarte&quot; to form an &quot;execution squad&quot; and go to Stadelheim prison, where certain &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA) leaders were being held. There in the prison courtyard, the &quot;Leibstandarte&quot; firing squad shot six SA officers, including Edmund Heines. Additional SA personnel identified by the regime as traitors were shot in Berlin by a unit of the &quot;Leibstandarte&quot; after Hitler told him to take six men and go to the Ministry of Justice to shoot certain SA leaders. Shortly thereafter, Dietrich was promoted to &quot;SS-Obergruppenführer&quot;. Dietrich&#x27;s role later earned him an 18-month sentence from a postwar court.

==World War II==

After World War II in Europe began, Dietrich led the &quot;Leibstandarte&quot; during the German advance into Poland and later the Netherlands. After the Dutch surrender, the &quot;Leibstandarte&quot; moved south to France on 24 May 1940. They took up a position 15 miles southwest of Dunkirk along the line of the Aa Canal, facing the Allied defensive line near Watten. That night the OKW ordered the advance to halt, with the British Expeditionary Force trapped. The &quot;Leibstandarte&quot; paused for the night. However, on the following day, in defiance of Hitler&#x27;s orders, Dietrich ordered his III Battalion to cross the canal and take the heights beyond, where British artillery observers were putting the regiment at risk. They assaulted the heights and drove the observers off. Instead of being censured for his act of defiance, Dietrich was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross. During this campaign members of the &quot;Leibstandarte&quot; 2nd Battalion were responsible for the murder of 80 British and French POWs, in what became known as the Wormhoudt massacre.

Dietrich remained in command of the &quot;Leibstandarte&quot; throughout the campaigns in Greece and Yugoslavia before being promoted to command of the 1st SS Panzer Corps, attached to Army Group Center, on the Eastern Front. In 1943, he was sent to Italy to recover Benito Mussolini&#x27;s mistress Clara Petacci. He received numerous German military medals.

During the German invasion of the Soviet Union, Dietrich was mainly noted for believing that the Russians could not be defeated even when leading the Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler, which was very unpopular with many of his peers yet he would continue to fight even with these opinions.

Dietrich commanded the 1st SS Panzer Corps in the Battle of Normandy. He rose to command 5th Panzer Army during the later stages of this campaign. Hitler gave him command of the newly created 6th Panzer Army. Dietrich led it in the Battle of the Bulge (December 1944-January 1945). He had been assigned to that task because, due to the 20 July Plot, Hitler distrusted Wehrmacht officers. On 17 December, &quot;Kampfgruppe Peiper&quot;—an SS unit under his overall command—murdered 84 U.S. prisoners of war near Malmedy, Belgium, in what is known as the Malmedy massacre. 
In March 1945 Dietrich&#x27;s 6th Panzer Army and the LSSAH spearheaded Operation Spring Awakening, an offensive in Hungary near Lake Balaton aimed at securing the last oil reserves still available to Germany. Despite early gains, the offensive was too ambitious in scope and failed. After that failure, the 6th SS Panzer Army (and LSSAH) retreated to the Vienna area. As a mark of disgrace, the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; units involved in the battle were ordered by Hitler to remove their treasured cuff titles bearing his name. Dietrich did not relay the order to his troops. Shortly thereafter, Dietrich&#x27;s troops were forced to retreat from Vienna by Soviet Red Army forces. Dietrich, accompanied by his wife, surrendered on 9 May 1945 to the U.S. 36th Infantry Division in Austria.

==Assessment==
Dietrich had the complete confidence of Hitler because of his loyalty; the old political fighter was one of Hitler&#x27;s favorites. He therefore enjoyed much lavish publicity, numerous decorations and a rapid series of promotions. Dietrich often took gambles, much to the dislike of the OKW, such as when he sent the &quot;Leibstandarte&quot; division &quot;charging into Rostov&quot; without orders &quot;purely to gain a prestige victory&quot;. Once Dietrich was promoted to a Corps command he was at least assisted by competent staff officers transferred from the army; still, the army command had to take some pains to keep him in line.

By 1944, there were clear signs Dietrich had been elevated above his military competence. He reportedly had never been taught how to read a military map. Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt considered him to be &quot;decent but stupid&quot; and was especially critical of Dietrich&#x27;s handling of the 6th Panzer Army in the Ardennes. Even Dietrich&#x27;s principal staff officer conceded that he was &quot;no strategic genius&quot;.

Dietrich&#x27;s long, personal acquaintance with Hitler allowed him to be more frank than other senior officers in his interactions with Hitler. He was reported by a fellow general to have &quot;railed against the Führer and [his] entourage&quot; with promises to let Hitler know that he was &quot;leading us all to destruction&quot;.

==War crimes conviction==

In 1943, Dietrich was sentenced to death &quot;in absentia&quot; by the Soviet Union for war crimes committed by his men in Kharkiv. However, after the war, the Soviets did not push for his extradition. Dietrich was tried as Defendant No. 11 by the U.S. Military Tribunal at Dachau (&quot;United States of America vs. Valentin Bersin et al.&quot;, Case No. 6-24), from 16 May 1946 until 16 July 1946. On that day he was sentenced to life imprisonment in the Malmedy massacre trial for his involvement in ordering the execution of U.S. prisoners of war. Dietrich was found guilty of issuing orders that &quot;troops were to be preceded by a wave of terror and fright, that no humane inhibitions were to be shown, and that every resistance was to be broken by terror,&quot; and that prisoners of war were to be shot, &quot;if necessary, in very compelling situations.&quot;

Due to testimony in his defence by other German officers, Dietrich&#x27;s sentence was shortened to 25 years. He was imprisoned at the Landsberg Prison in Bavaria. Dietrich served only ten years and was released on parole on 22 October 1955.

Dietrich was re-arrested in Ludwigsburg in August 1956. He, along with former SS-Standartenführer Michael Lippert, was charged by the Landgericht München I and tried from 6 to 14 May 1957 for their role in the killing of SA leaders during the Night of the Long Knives in 1934. Dietrich was sentenced to 18 months for his part in that purge, after being convicted as an accessory to manslaughter for providing a firing squad for the executions of six SA men. After losing his appeals, Dietrich was returned to Landsberg Prison on 7 August 1958. He was released due to a heart condition and circulation problems in his legs on 6 February 1959.

==Later life ==
Upon his release from prison, Dietrich took an active part in the activities of HIAG, an organization and lobby group of former &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; members. Founded by former high-ranking &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; personnel, it campaigned for the legal, economic and historical rehabilitation of the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;, with some success. In 1966, Dietrich died of a heart attack. Six thousand people, including many former SS men, attended his funeral.

Dietrich was married twice: he was divorced from his first wife in 1937 and remarried in 1942. He had three children. Before his second marriage, Dietrich was a visitor of the Salon Kitty.

<text>John &quot;Mad Jack&quot; Mytton (30 September 1796 – 29 March 1834) was a British eccentric and rake of the Regency period who was briefly a Tory Member of Parliament.

==Early life ==

John Mytton was born on 30 September 1796, the son of John Mytton and Sarah Harriet. His family were Shropshire squires with a lineage that stretched back some 500 years. His father died at the age of 30, when Jack was two years old, and he inherited the family seat of Halston Hall, Whittington, near Oswestry, which was worth £60,000 (), as well as an annual income of £10,000 () from rental and agricultural assets generated by estates of more than at Dinas Mawddwy and in Shropshire.

Mytton was sent to Westminster School, but was expelled after one year for fighting a master. He was then sent to Harrow School, from which he was also expelled after three terms. He was then educated by a disparate series of private tutors whom he tormented with practical jokes that included leaving a horse in one tutor&#x27;s bedroom.

Despite having achieved very little academically, Mytton was granted entry to Trinity College, Cambridge. He matriculated in January 1816 but, according to &quot;Alumni Cantabrigienses&quot;, it is doubtful that he took up his place, although there are claims that he took 2,000 bottles of port to sustain himself during his studies. He certainly was not awarded a degree, having found university life boring, and embarked on a Grand Tour.

==Military service==
Mytton saw both part-time and full-time military service. In 1812, when he was 16, he was commissioned as captain in a local yeomanry regiment, the Oswestry Rangers. In 1814 it was merged into the North Shropshire Yeomanry Cavalry, into which Mytton transferred.

After Mytton&#x27;s return from the Grand Tour, he was commissioned in the regular Army and joined the 7th Hussars. As a cornet, he spent a year with the regiment in France as part of the army of occupation after the defeat of Napoleon I, spending his time gambling and drinking before resigning his commission. He rejoined the North Shropshire Yeomanry after his subsequent return to England and was promoted to major in 1822. He had attempted in vain to lobby its colonel for an even higher rank in the place of an uncle, William Owen, who had left the regiment. Despite his later periods abroad and imprisonment, he was still on the regimental strength at the time of his death twelve years later.

==Life as a squire==
Mytton later returned to his country seat and took up the duties of a squire in preparation for coming into his full inheritance when he became 21.

In 1819 he entertained ambitions of standing for Parliament, as a Tory, following family tradition. He secured his seat by offering voters £10 notes, spending a total of £10,000 (). He thus became MP for Shrewsbury. He spent just 30 minutes in the House of Commons in June 1819, but found the debates boring and difficult to follow because of his incipient deafness. When Parliament was dissolved in 1820 he declined to stand at the next election.

However, he attempted to re-enter Parliament in 1831, this time for one of the two Shropshire seats and as a Whig candidate. He withdrew on the fifth day of the poll and came bottom with 376 votes. He then issued an address stating that he would contest the next parliamentary election, but by the time of that election, in 1832, he had gone into exile to escape his creditors.

He instead served as High Sheriff of Merionethshire for 1821–22, High Sheriff of Shropshire for 1823–24; Mayor of Oswestry for 1824–25 and as treasurer of the Salop Infirmary at Shrewsbury in 1822.

Meanwhile, he indulged his enjoyment of horseracing and gambling, and enjoyed some success at both. He bought a horse named Euphrates, which was already a consistent winner, and entered it in the Gold Cup at Lichfield in 1825, and it duly won. Its portrait, commissioned by Mytton from the painter William Webb, was exhibited at the Royal Academy the same year. Mytton also became a well-known character at Oswestry Race Course, an increasingly disreputable local racetrack.

It is said that in 1826, in order to win a bet, he rode a horse into the Bedford Hotel opposite the Town Hall in Leamington Spa, up the grand staircase and onto the balcony, from which he jumped, still seated on his horse, over the diners in the restaurant below, and out through the window onto the Parade.

He also held contests for local children at Dinas Mawddwy, giving sums ranging from half a crown to half a guinea to those who rolled all the way down the hill Moel Dinas.

===Field sports===

Mytton had hunted foxes with his own pack of hounds from the age of ten and went hunting in any kind of weather. His usual winter gear was a light jacket, thin shoes, linen trousers and silk stockings, but in the thrill of the chase he sometimes stripped off and continued the hunt naked, even through snow drifts and rivers in full spate. He also continued hunting despite being unseated and sustaining broken ribs -&quot;unmurmuring when every jar was an agony&quot;, and sometimes led his stable boys on rat hunts, each stable boy being equipped with ice skates. He had a wardrobe consisting of 150 pairs of hunting breeches, 700 pairs of handmade hunting boots, 1,000 hats and some 3,000 shirts.

Mytton kept numerous pets, including some 2,000 dogs. His favourites among them were fed on steak and champagne. His favourite horse, Baronet, had free range inside Halston Hall and lay in front of the fire with Mytton.

It was said of &quot;Mad Jack&quot; that &quot;not only did he not mind accidents, he positively liked them&quot;. Mytton drove his gig at high speed and once decided to discover if a horse pulling a carriage could jump over a tollgate (it could not). On another occasion he asked his passenger whether he had ever been upset in a gig. The man said he had not and Mytton responded, &quot;What!! What a damn slow fellow you must have been all your life!&quot; He promptly drove the gig up a sloping bank at full speed, tipping himself and his passenger out.

==Decline and death==
Mytton was an extravagant spendthrift. Visitors to his estates sometimes found banknotes secreted around the grounds, whether left on purpose or simply lost. Over the course of fifteen years he managed to spend his inheritance and then fell into deep debt. His agent had calculated that if he could but reduce his expenditure to £6,000 a year for six years his estate would not have to be sold, but Mytton declared that &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t give a damn to live on £6,000 a year!&quot; In 1831 he sold his estate at Dinas Mawddwy to John Bird, and fled to Calais to avoid his creditors. He had met an attractive 20-year-old woman named Susan on Westminster Bridge and offered her £500 a year to be his companion. She accompanied him to France and stayed with him until his death.

During his stay in Calais he tried to cure his hiccups by setting his shirt on fire. Charles James Apperley, who wrote under the pseudonym of &quot;Nimrod&quot;, was present at this event: &quot;&#x27;Damn this hiccup!!&#x27; said Mytton as he stood undressed on the floor, apparently in the act of getting into bed &#x27;but I’ll frighten it away&#x27;; so seizing a lighted candle applied it to the tail of his shirt – it being a cotton one – he was instantly enveloped in flames. A fellow guest and Mytton’s servant beat out the flames: &#x27;The hiccup is gone, by God!&#x27;, said he and reeled, naked, into bed.&quot;

In 1833, Mytton returned to England, where, still unable to pay his debts, he was confined at Shrewsbury Prison, then transferred to the King&#x27;s Bench Prison in Southwark. He died there in 1834, a &quot;round-shouldered, tottering, old-young man bloated by drink, worn out by too much foolishness, too much wretchedness and too much brandy&quot;. The cause of death was delirium tremens. He was buried in the vault of the private chapel at Halston on 9 April. In 2023, a Time Team investigation sent a camera down into the vault, which discovered his intact coffin had what appeared to be the skin of his beloved pet bear draped over it.

A print of a portrait of John Mytton by Rudolph Ackermann was published in 1847, 13 years after their deaths. These were marked &quot;JOHN MYTTON ESQ. HALSTON SALOP ~ from an original picture in the possession of John Bishton Minor Esq. Astley House Pradoe, guardian of J. F. G. Mytton, this engraving of his ward&#x27;s late father&quot; When the print was published John jnr would have been 24 years old and would have inherited what was left of the estate. There is also a portrait of Mytton on horseback, by William Webb, and numerous illustrations, by Henry Thomas Alken and T. J. Rawlins, appear in Nimrod&#x27;s &quot;Life of John Mytton&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1818, Mytton married Harriet Emma Jones, a daughter of Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt Jones, in London. Before her death in Cliffden, Somerset, on 2 July 1820, they were the parents of:

* Harriet Emma Charlotte Mytton (1819–1885), who married Clement Delves Hill, a nephew of Maj-Gen. Clement Delves Hill.

His second marriage was to Caroline Mallet Giffard from Chillington Hall in October 1821 at Brewood, Staffordshire. She ran away in 1830 and lived the rest of his life estranged. Before their estrangement, they were the parents of a daughter and four sons:

* Barbara Augusta Norah Mytton (1822–1870), who married Col. Poulett George Henry Somerset, son of Lord Charles Henry Somerset, a younger brother of the 6th Duke of Beaufort, in 1847.
* John Fox Fitz-Giffard Mytton (1823–1875), who married Jane Latham.
* Charles Orville January Mytton (1825–1834), who died young.
* Euphrates Henry Mytton (1826–1834), who died young.
* William Harper Mytton (b. 1827).

Euphrates and Charles both died within months after their father and were also buried at Halston, as was Caroline upon her death in 1841. His two other sons and both daughters survived him. 

==Legacy==
*Mytton appears prominently in Dame Edith Sitwell&#x27;s 1933 book &quot;English Eccentrics&quot;, which draws largely on the Nimrod account.
*The Jack Mytton Way, a long-distance bridleway for riders, mountain bikers and walkers, runs for through South and Mid-Shropshire
*There is a public house named after Mytton in the canalside village of Hindford near Halston Hall
* A hotel, the Mytton and Mermaid Hotel, on the River Severn at Atcham, near Shrewsbury, and has a bar called Mad Jack&#x27;s Bar. His funeral cortege halted there on its way to the chapel at Halston
* The Jack Mytton Run, an annual event by students, was held on the University of Minnesota campus in Minneapolis, Minnesota across Northrup Mall on the first class day following spring break. It is reported to have begun in 1999. The event was discontinued in 2009 when campus police deterred it
* He is mentioned in the book &quot;The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman&quot; by John Fowles, beside Casanova
* Jack Wenlock, the lead character in The Case of the &#x27;Hail Mary&#x27; Celeste by Malcolm Pryce is revealed as being named after John Mytton.
* There is a race horse named after him 
*He is the earliest known person to use the phrase &quot;easy come, easy go&quot; in an earlier form as &quot;light come, light go&quot;.

<doc id="351730" wikidata="Q1675101" url="?curid=351730" title="Matthew Robinson, 2nd Baron Rokeby">
<text>Matthew Robinson, 2nd Baron Rokeby (Baptised, York 12 April 1713 – 30 November 1800), FRS, was an English landowner, politician and nobleman. In later life, he was considered an eccentric.

==Early life==
Lord Rokeby was born Matthew Robinson in a large family from Yorkshire. His parents were Matthew Robinson (1694–1778) of Edgely and West Layton, Yorkshire, and Elizabeth, daughter of Robert Drake of Cambridge; his sisters included the novelists Elizabeth Montagu and Sarah Scott. Of his six brothers, Thomas the second was known as a legal writer, William the fifth as a cleric, and the youngest, Charles, as a Member of Parliament. His father inherited property in the neighbourhood of Rokeby from his great-uncle Matthew Robinson, rector of Burneston; and his mother inherited the Mount Morris estate at Monks Horton, near Hythe, Kent, from her brother Morris Drake Morris, which Rokeby in turn succeeded to in 1746.

Robinson was admitted to Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1730, and to Trinity Hall, Cambridge in 1731. He became a Fellow there in 1734. In 1746 his mother died and he inherited her Monks Horton property. As a consequence, he then assumed the additional name of Morris.

In November 1746 he became a Fellow of the Royal Society. The Royal Society citation reads: &quot;Mathew Robinson Esqr, A Gentleman well versed in Philosophical Learning, and polite Literature; being desirous of becoming a fellow of this Society, We on our personal knowledge do recommend him as every way qualified and likely to become a useful Member of our Body.&quot; His proposers were Edw Montagu (brother-in-law); Daniel Wray; Geo Lewis Scott (brother-in-law); Henry Baker; Robt Smith; M Folkes.

He was elected as a Bailiff to the board of the Bedford Level Corporation in 1756, a position he held until 1763.

Robinson-Morris represented Canterbury in Parliament, from 1747 to 1761 including managing to hold the constituency without expense in 1754; in politics he was a Whig. He inherited the title Lord Rokeby in 1794 after the death of his father&#x27;s second cousin, The 1st Baron Rokeby, Church of Ireland Lord Primate of All Ireland and Lord Archbishop of Armagh.

==Supposed eccentric==
The 2nd Lord Rokeby became an enthusiastic supporter of baths during a holiday in the spa town of Aix-la-Chapelle. When he returned to Kent, he began to make daily trips to the seashore to swim in salt water regardless of the weather. He preferred this environment to such an extent that his servant had to persuade him to come home. Sometimes he fainted and had to be rescued. He had a hut built for him on the sands at Hythe and drinking fountains along his route to the beach. He walked all the way and let his servant follow him in the carriage with full livery. If he found people drinking from a fountain, he gave them a half-crown coin.

He also let his beard grow, which was against the contemporary fashion. Eventually, it was so thick that it stuck out under his arms and could be seen from behind. In a couple of years, he decided to build a swimming pool in his mansion - it was built under glass and was heated by the sun. There he spent hours at a time, preferably alone. He refused to have a fire in his house even in the coldest weather.

His increased isolation bred rumours, including one that he was a cannibal or ate only raw meat - when he ate mainly beef tea and nibbled at venison. He also refused to see any doctors. As for church service, he claimed that God was best worshipped at natural altars of the earth, the sea and the sky - not to mention that the sermons were boring.

When Lord Rokeby did indeed agree to accept visitors, he might &quot;entertain&quot; them with lengthy, boring poems. He arranged a sumptuous meal for Prince William of Gloucester but ate very little himself. He very rarely visited the court and then was an embarrassment to his socialite sister, Elizabeth Montagu. When he stayed at the Chequers Inn at Lenham in 1796 so he could vote in the general election, curious locals took him for a Turk.

In January 1755 Mrs. Montagu wrote to their sister, Sarah Scott: &#x27;Brother Robinson is emulating the great Diogenes and other ... doctors of the stoic fur; he flies the life of London and leads a life of such privacy and seriousness as looks to the beholder like wisdom&#x27;, and in 1756 she reported that he now lived upon almost raw meat, never touched bread, considering corn exotic, and for the same reason substituted honey for sugar.

==Death==
Lord Rokeby died in December 1800, peacefully in his bed. His title and estates passed to his nephew Morris Robinson, 3rd Baron Rokeby. His tomb in Armagh Cathedral is sculpted by John Bacon.

<text>Ongar railway station is a station on the Epping Ongar Railway heritage line, and a former London Underground station in the town of Chipping Ongar, Essex. It was opened in 1865 by the Great Eastern Railway, and became part of London Transport in 1949. Until its closure as such in 1994, it was the easternmost point of the Central line and the eastern buffers remain the point from which all distances on the London Underground are measured.

==History==


The station was opened by the Great Eastern Railway on 24 April 1865, serving principally as a goods station taking agricultural produce from the nearby farms into central London. On 25 September 1949, London Underground services took over the operation of the station from British Railways when services were extended from Loughton.

Although the rest of the branch was electrified by London Underground before operations were taken over from British Railways, trains on the section north of Epping continued to be hauled by steam locomotives as a separate shuttle service. The service was operated by British Railways for the Underground until 18 November 1957, when the line was electrified and electric trains took over from steam. The low power supply prevented the Epping to Ongar section being fully integrated into the line and it continued to operate as a shuttle service.

The entire Epping to Ongar branch was a single track line with one passing place at North Weald station, although this loop was taken out of service between 1888 and 1949, and again from 1976. Between 1949 and 1976 two Tube trains could use the branch, although they were limited to four cars in length because of the restriction on the available traction current, as well as by the restricted platform lengths at North Weald and Blake Hall. The service was reduced to one train after the southbound track at North Weald was lifted. It was therefore never suitable for heavy use, and the line was reportedly never profitable. For much of its latter years, the service only operated during Monday to Friday peak hours, and London Transport closed Blake Hall station, the least used on the entire system, in 1981. The line itself continued in use and there was a brief re-introduction of all day services in 1990. However, a system wide cost-cutting exercise saw the service return to peak hours soon afterwards, with an even more skeletal service than before. The line was under threat of closure for many years, and it was finally closed on 30 September 1994.

==Epping Ongar Railway==

The station and the line are now in the ownership of a private company, Epping Ongar Railway Ltd who, at time of purchase, publicly stated their intention to run commuter services again, but the claimed lack of platform availability at London Underground&#x27;s Epping station at the west end of the line has to date proven an insuperable obstacle to this. The Epping Ongar Railway Volunteer Rail Society ran heritage trains on Sundays over the former Epping and Ongar line from 2004 until 2007, when the line was closed following a change in ownership.

The line was reopened to the public on 25 May 2012.

Ongar Station, as with the rest of the 6.05-mile branch reaching to the outskirts of Epping station, is currently undergoing significant improvement and infrastructure works. These are designed with the long-term future of the branch and to enable the use of locomotive-hauled trains (hauled by steam and diesel locomotives), all in keeping with its use as a heritage railway.
The station itself has been extensively restored by the teams of volunteers, with all the rooms being restored to their original layouts, opening up bricked up doorways and windows, and restoring the station to Great Eastern Railway colours (believed to be the only original operational GER station in its original colours). Within the station the former Parcels Office will be a museum and educational display.

In addition a GER signalbox, originally located at Spellbrook, has been rescued and rebuilt to replace the Ongar signalbox demolished by LU in the 1980s, and the platform is being improved to facilitate access.

Local bus services connecting Ongar railway station to Brentwood, Chelmsford, Epping and Harlow are provided by NIBS Buses, Central Connect and First Essex. The station is also occasionally served by heritage bus route 339, operated by the Epping Ongar Railway, which serves the Shenfield, Ongar and Epping stations using a fleet of preserved London Transport buses.

==Other information==
The sand drag at the very end of the rails — intended to help slow trains that overshot the stopping mark — was said to be home to a breed of harmless scorpion and featured in a 1979 episode of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Wildlife on One&quot;. They had been released there by a station foreman who was a keeper of exotic pets. The sand drag has since been removed. A scorpion has since been sighted in the wild, ten miles north of Ongar, in April 2010, although this is thought to be unrelated.

In 1971–72 the London underground network was remeasured in kilometres using Ongar as its zero point.

The Royal Navy&#x27;s Tigerfish torpedo was known as Project ONGAR during development.

There were various ill-fated attempts mainly by the Great Eastern Railway later the London and North Eastern Railway to extend beyond Ongar station in the past including to Great Dunmow, Bury St Edmunds via Great Dunmow and back on to the GER mainline at Chelmsford by way of Margaretting. There was also a few light railway schemes like the Hedingham &amp; Long Melford Railway and others that proposed a route from Ongar to Yeldham at Great Yeldham via Great Dunmow, Haverhill and Shenfield.

<text>Karakalpakstan, officially the Republic of Karakalpakstan, is an autonomous republic of Uzbekistan. It spans the northwestern portion of Uzbekistan. Its capital is Nukus (&quot;&quot; / ). Karakalpakstan has an area of , and has a population of about 2 million people. Its territory covers the classical land of Khwarazm, which in classical Persian literature was known as ().

The name &quot;Karakalpakstan&quot; means &quot;land of the Karakalpaks&quot;. Although most Karakalpaks reside in Uzbekistan, Karakalpak culture and language are closer to those of the Kazakhs and Nogais.

== History ==

From about 500 BC to 500 AD, the region of what is now Karakalpakstan was a thriving agricultural area supported by extensive irrigation. It was strategically important territory and fiercely contested, as is seen by the more than 50 Khorezm fortresses which were constructed here. The Karakalpak people, who used to be nomadic herders and fishers, were first recorded by foreigners in the 16th century. Karakalpakstan was ceded to the Russian Empire by the Khanate of Khiva in 1873. 

Under Soviet rule, it was an autonomous area within the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic before becoming part of Uzbekistan in 1936 as the Karakalpak ASSR. 

The region was probably at its most prosperous in the 1960s and 1970s, when irrigation from the Amu Darya was being expanded. However, the evaporation of the Aral Sea has made Karakalpakstan one of Uzbekistan&#x27;s poorest regions. 

The region is suffering from extensive drought, partly due to climate patterns, but also largely because the Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers are mostly diverted in the eastern parts of Uzbekistan. Crop failures have deprived about 48,000 people of their main source of income and shortages of potable water have created a surge of infectious diseases.

== Geography ==
Karakalpakstan is now mostly desert and is located in western Uzbekistan near the Aral Sea, in the lowest part of the Amu Darya basin. It has an area of 164,900 km2 and is surrounded by desert. The Kyzyl Kum Desert is located to the east and the Karakum Desert is located to the south. A rocky plateau extends west to the Caspian Sea.

== Politics ==

=== Autonomous status ===

Its predecessor, the Karakalpak Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, was an autonomous republic in the Soviet Union until its incorporation into the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic in 1932. The Republic of Karakalpakstan maintained its predecessor&#x27;s formal sovereignty, even after the independence of Uzbekistan in 1990. Karakalpakstan shares veto power with Uzbekistan over decisions concerning its affairs. According to the constitution, relations between Karakalpakstan and Uzbekistan are &quot;regulated by treaties and agreements&quot; and any disputes are &quot;settled by way of reconciliation&quot;. Its right to secede is limited by the veto power of Uzbekistan&#x27;s legislature over any decision to secede. Article 89, chapter XVII, Constitution of Uzbekistan, provides that: &quot;The Republic of Karakalpakstan shall have the right to secede from the Republic of Uzbekistan on the basis of a nationwide referendum held by the people of Karakalpakstan.&quot;

In July 2022, large protests broke out in the region over a proposed constitutional change which would strip Karakalpakstan of its autonomy. The proposed change was later scrapped in response to the demonstrations.

=== Leadership ===
The head of the republic is the Chairman of the Supreme Council of Karakalpakstan or parliament (known as the &quot;President of the Republic&quot; from 1991 to 1992). The head of the government is the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Karakalpakstan.

One of the deputy chairmen of the Senate of the Oliy Majlis is a representative of Karakalpakstan as per the constitution.

== Demographics ==
On 1 July 2023, the population of Karakalpakstan was 1,986,900 people. It increased of 1.2% compared to the corresponding period of 2022. The number of women (989,100) slightly exceeded the number of men (997,800). There were slightly more people living in rural areas (1,015,500) than in urban areas (971,400).

In 2007, it was estimated that about 400,000 of the population are of the Karakalpak ethnic group, 400,000 are Uzbeks and 300,000 are Kazakhs. Though 95% of Karakalpaks reside in Uzbekistan, mostly in Karakalpakstan, the Karakalpak language is closer to Kazakh than to Uzbek. The language was written in a modified Cyrillic in Soviet times and has been written in the Latin alphabet since 1996.

Other than the capital Nukus, major cities include Xojeli, Taqiyatas, Shimbay, Qońirat (&quot;Kungrad&quot;) and Moynaq.

The crude birth rate is 2.2%: approximately 39,400 children were born in 2017. Nearly 8,400 people died in the same period. The crude death rate is 0.47%. The natural growth rate is 31,000, or 1.72%.

The median age was 27.7 years old in 2017, which is younger than the rest of Uzbekistan (median age of 28.5 countrywide). Men are 27.1 years old, while women are 28.2 years old.

Dynamics of the number and ethnic composition of the population of Karakalpakstan according to the All-Union censuses of 1926–1989:

== Economy ==

The economy of the region used to be heavily dependent on fisheries in the Aral Sea. It is now supported by cotton, rice, and fruits, such as plums, pears, grapes, and apricots, in addition to all kinds of melons. Hydroelectric power comes from a large Soviet-built station on the Amu Darya, which was once heavily populated and supported extensive irrigation based agriculture for thousands of years. Under the Khorezm, the area attained considerable power and prosperity. 

However, climate change over the centuries, accelerated by human induced evaporation of the Aral Sea in the late 20th century has created a desolate scene in the region. The ancient oases of rivers, lakes, reed marshes, forests and farms are drying up and being poisoned by wind-borne salt and by fertilizer and pesticide residues from the dried bed of the Aral Sea. Summer temperatures have risen by and winter temperatures have decreased by . The rates of incidence of anemia, respiratory diseases and other health problems has risen dramatically.

== Administrative divisions ==

The autonomous republic of Karakalpakstan consists of 16 districts (listed below) and one district-level city: Nukus (number 1 on map).


Taqiyatas district was created in 2017 from part of Xojeli district. Bozataw district was created in September 2019 from parts of the Kegeyli district and the Shimbay district.

There are 12 cities (Nókis, Mańģit, Beruniy, Xaliqabat, Qońirat, Moynaq, Taqiyatas, Tórtkúl, Xojeli, Shimbay, Shomanay, Bostan) and 26 urban-type settlements in Karakalpakstan.

== Media ==

=== Journalism ===
Journalists can face intimidation in the region, for example Lola Kallikhanova has been questioned by police, and prosecuted. This treatment of Kallikhanova and other journalists was condemned by the Coalition for Women in Journalism.

=== Radio ===
In 2009, the first radio station of Karakalpakstan was opened, in Nukus. Named &#x27;Nukus FM,&#x27; the station broadcasts on radio frequency 100.4 MHz.

=== Television ===
Qaraqalpaqstan tеlеvideniesi is an Uzbek television channel that broadcasts to the autonomous republic of Karakalpakstan. The channel airs programming in four languages, Karakalpak, Uzbek, Kazakh and Russian.

<text>Italo Balbo (6 June 1896 – 28 June 1940) was an Italian fascist politician and Blackshirts&#x27; leader who served as Italy&#x27;s Marshal of the Air Force, Governor-General of Italian Libya and Commander-in-Chief of Italian North Africa. Due to his young age, he was sometimes seen as a possible successor to dictator Benito Mussolini.

After serving in World War I, Balbo became the leading Fascist party organizer in his home region of Ferrara. He was one of the Quadrumvirs, the four principal architects (&quot;Quadrumviri del Fascismo&quot;) of the March on Rome that brought Mussolini and the Fascists to power in 1922, along with Michele Bianchi, Emilio De Bono and Cesare Maria De Vecchi. In 1926, he began the task of building the Italian Royal Air Force and took a leading role in popularizing aviation in Italy, and promoting Italian aviation to the world. In 1933, perhaps to relieve tensions surrounding him in Italy, he was given the task of governing Italian Libya, where he resided for the remainder of his life. Balbo, hostile to antisemitism, was among a minority of leading Fascists to oppose Mussolini&#x27;s alliance with Nazi Germany. Early in World War II, he was killed by friendly fire when his plane was shot down over Tobruk by Italian anti-aircraft guns who misidentified it.

==Early life==
In 1896, Balbo was born in Quartesana (part of Ferrara) in the Kingdom of Italy. Balbo was very politically active from an early age. At 14 years of age, he attempted to join in a Revolt in Albania under Ricciotti Garibaldi, Giuseppe Garibaldi&#x27;s son.

As World War I broke out and Italy declared its neutrality, Balbo supported joining the war on the side of the Allies. He joined in several pro-war rallies. Once Italy entered the war in 1915, Balbo joined the Italian Royal Army (&quot;Regio Esercito&quot;) as an officer candidate and served with the Alpini mountain infantry. His first assignment was with the Alpini Battalion &quot;Val Fella&quot;, 8th Alpini Regiment, before volunteering for flight training on 16 October 1917. A few days later the Austro-Hungarian and German armies broke the Italian lines in the Battle of Caporetto, and Balbo returned to the front, now assigned to the Alpini Battalion &quot;Pieve di Cadore&quot;, 7th Alpini Regiment, where he took command of an assault platoon. At the end of the war, Balbo had earned one bronze and two silver medals for military valour and reached the rank of Captain (&quot;Capitano&quot;) due to courage under fire.

After the war, Balbo completed the studies he had begun in Florence in 1914–15. He obtained a law degree and a degree in Social Sciences. His final thesis was written on &quot;the economic and social thought of Giuseppe Mazzini&quot;, and he researched under the supervision of the patriotic historian Niccolò Rodolico. Balbo was a Republican, but he hated Socialists and the unions and cooperatives associated with them.

Balbo returned to his home town to work as a bank clerk. In 1920, Balbo was initiated in the regular Masonic Lodge &quot;Giovanni Bovio&quot;, affiliated to the Gran Loggia d&#x27;Italia. Subsequently, he received the degree of Orator in the Masonic Lodge&quot; Girolamo Savonarola&quot; in Ferrara, joined by various other party officials. He left the lodge on 18 February 1923, just three days before the vote of the Grand Council of Fascism which forbade fascists to be members of the Freemasonry.

==Blackshirt leader==
In 1921, Balbo joined the newly created National Fascist Party (&quot;Partito Nazionale Fascista&quot;, or PNF) and soon became a secretary of the Ferrara Fascist organization. He began to organize Fascist gangs and formed his own group nicknamed &quot;Celibano&quot;, after their favorite drink. They broke strikes for local landowners and attacked communists and socialists in Portomaggiore, Ravenna, Modena, and Bologna. The group once raided the Estense Castle in Ferrara. Balbo had become one of the &quot;Ras&quot;, adopted from an Ethiopian title somewhat equivalent to a duke, of the Fascist hierarchy by 1922, establishing his local leadership in the party. The &quot;Ras&quot; typically wished for a more decentralized Fascist Italian state to be formed, against Mussolini&#x27;s wishes.

At 26 years of age, Balbo was the youngest of the Quadrumvirs: the four main planners of the March on Rome. The Quadrumvirs were Michele Bianchi (age 39), Cesare Maria De Vecchi (38), Emilio De Bono (56), and Balbo. Mussolini himself (39) would not participate in the risky operation that ultimately brought Italy under Fascist rule. In 1923, as one of the Quadrumvirs, Balbo became a founding member of the Grand Council of Fascism (&quot;Gran Consiglio del Fascismo&quot;). This same year, he was implicated in the murder of anti-Fascist parish priest Giovanni Minzoni in Argenta. He fled to Rome and in 1924 became General Commander of the Fascist militia and undersecretary for National Economy in 1925.

==Aviator==


On 6 November 1926, though he had only a little experience in aviation, Balbo was appointed Secretary of State for Air. He went through an intensive course of flying instruction and began building the Italian Royal Air Force (&quot;Regia Aeronautica Italiana&quot;). On 19 August 1928, he became General of the Air Force and on 12 September 1929 Minister of Aeronautics.

In Italy, this was a time of great interest in aviation. In 1925, Francesco de Pinedo flew a seaplane from Italy to Australia to Japan and back again to Italy. Mario De Bernardi successfully raced seaplanes internationally. In 1928, Arctic explorer Umberto Nobile piloted the airship &quot;Italia&quot; on a polar expedition.
Balbo himself led some transatlantic flights. The first was the 1930 flight of twelve Savoia-Marchetti S.55 flying boats from Orbetello Seaplane Base, Italy to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil between 17 December 1930 and 15 January 1931.

The &quot;Crociera del Decennale&quot; featured the so-called &quot;Italian Air Armada.&quot; From 1 July to 12 August 1933, twenty-four seaplanes flew round-trip from Rome to the Century of Progress in Chicago, Illinois. The flight had eight legs: Orbetello – Amsterdam – Derry – Reykjavík – Cartwright – Shediac – Montreal – Lake Michigan near Burnham Park, Chicago – New York City. In honor of this feat, Mussolini donated a column from Ostia to the city of Chicago: the Balbo Monument. It can still be seen along the Lakefront Trail, a little south of Soldier Field. Chicago renamed the former 7th Street &quot;Balbo Drive&quot; and staged a great parade in his honour. The Newfoundland Post Office overprinted one of their 75-cent airmail stamps, that had been issued just two months previously, for the event: General Balbo Flight, Labrador, The Land of Gold.

From Chicago, they flew to New York City with an escort of 36 U.S. airplanes. New York gave a warm welcome to the pilots on Broadway. Millions of people watched the parade of dozens of cars escorted by police horses along the streets of Manhattan. Balbo was featured on 26 June 1933 cover of &quot;Time&quot;.

During Balbo&#x27;s stay in the United States, President Franklin Roosevelt invited him to lunch and presented him with the Distinguished Flying Cross. He was awarded the 1931 Harmon Trophy. The Sioux even honorarily adopted Balbo as &quot;Chief Flying Eagle&quot;. Balbo received a warm welcome in the United States, especially from the large Italian-American populations in Chicago and New York City. To a cheering mass in Madison Square Garden, he said: &quot;Be proud you are Italians. Mussolini has ended the era of humiliations.&quot; The term &quot;Balbo&quot; entered common usage to describe any large formation of aircraft.

The return flight from New York stopped in Shoal Harbour at Clarenville, Newfoundland, on 26 July. A road overlooking the bay used by the flying boats was renamed Balbo Drive, a name it still carries today. On 12 August 1933, Balbo&#x27;s formation departed Clarenville for the Azores, Lisbon, and Rome.
Back home in Italy, he was promoted to the newly created rank of Marshal of the Air Force (&quot;Maresciallo dell&#x27;Aria&quot;).

Following his return to Italy, Balbo proposed his vision for a reorganised Italian army. Balbo advocated that the army be reduced to twenty divisions, of which there would be ten motorised, five Alpine and five armoured, all well-equipped, trained and prepared for amphibious warfare, while the navy would have three marine divisions. The idea was that the army would become an expeditionary force that could rapidly deploy by sea or train to Italy&#x27;s borders (including Libya). However, such a proposal was financially impossible as it would require an unprecedented increase in the defence budget.

==Governor of Libya==


On 7 November 1933, Balbo was appointed Governor-General of the Italian colony of Libya. Mussolini looked to the flamboyant Air Marshal to be the &quot;condottiero&quot; of Italian ambition and extend Italy&#x27;s new horizons in Africa. Balbo&#x27;s task was to assert Italy&#x27;s rights in the indeterminate zones leading to Lake Chad from Tummo in the west and from Kufra in the east towards the Sudan. Balbo had already made a flying visit to Tibesti. By securing the &quot;Tibesti-Borku strip&quot; and the &quot;Sarra Triangle&quot;, Italy would be in a good position to demand further territorial concessions in Africa from France and Britain. Mussolini even had his sights set on the former German colony of Kamerun. From 1922, the colony had become the League of Nations mandate territories of French Cameroun and British Cameroons. Mussolini pictured an Italian Cameroon and a territorial corridor connecting that territory to Libya. An Italian Cameroon would give Italy a port on the Atlantic Ocean, the mark of a world power. Ultimately, control of the Suez Canal and of Gibraltar would complete the picture.

As of 1 January 1934, Tripolitania, Cyrenaica and Fezzan were merged to form the new colony and Balbo moved to Libya. At that stage, Balbo had apparently caused bad blood in the party, possibly because of jealousy and individualist behaviour. Being appointed Governor-General of Libya was an effective exile from politics in Rome where Mussolini considered him a threat, both for his fame and, more importantly, because of his close relationship with the possibly anti-fascist Crown Prince Umberto. Italian newspapers reportedly could not mention Balbo&#x27;s name more than once a month. &quot;Benito in Balboland,&quot; an article in 22 March 1937 issue of &quot;Time Magazine&quot;, played with the conflict between Mussolini and Balbo. Balbo was still well known in the United States for his visit to the Century of Progress exhibition. While Governor, Balbo ordered Jews who closed their businesses on the Sabbath to be whipped. Balbo commissioned the Marble Arch to mark the border between Tripolitania and Cyrenaica. It was unveiled on 16 March 1937.

===Abyssinia crisis===
In 1935, as the &quot;Abyssinia Crisis&quot; worsened, Balbo began preparing plans to attack Egypt and Sudan. As Mussolini made his intentions to invade Ethiopia clear, relations between Italy and the United Kingdom became more tense. Fearing a &quot;Mad Dog&quot; act by Mussolini against British forces and possessions in the Mediterranean, Britain reinforced its fleet in the region and also its military forces in Egypt. Balbo reasoned that, should Britain choose to close the Suez Canal, Italian troop transports would be prevented from reaching Eritrea and Somalia. Thinking that the planned attack on Abyssinia would be crippled, Balbo asked for reinforcements in Libya. He calculated that such a gesture would make him a national hero and restore him to the centre of the political stage. The 7th Blackshirt Division (Cirene) and 700 aircraft were immediately sent from Italy to Libya. Balbo may have received intelligence concerning the feasibility of advancing into Egypt and Sudan from the famous desert researcher László Almásy.

By 1 September 1935, Balbo secretly deployed Italian forces along the border with Egypt without the British knowing anything about it. At the time, British intelligence concerning what was going on in Libya was woefully inadequate. In the end, Mussolini rejected Balbo&#x27;s over-ambitious plan to attack Egypt and Sudan and London learned about his deployments in Libya from Rome.

===Munich crisis===
The &quot;Anglo-Italian Agreement&quot; of April 1938 brought a temporary cessation of tensions between the United Kingdom and the Kingdom of Italy. For Balbo, the agreement meant the immediate loss of 10,000 Italian troops; it was characterised by renewed promises of undertakings that Mussolini had previously broken and he could easily break again. By the time of the &quot;Munich Crisis&quot;, Balbo had his 10,000 troops back.

At this time, Italian aircraft were making frequent overflights of Egypt and Sudan and Italian pilots were being familiarised with the routes and airfields. In 1938 and 1939, Balbo himself made a number of flights from Libya across the Sudan to Italian East Africa (&#x27;Africa Orientale Italiana&#x27;, or AOI). He even flew along the border between AOI and British East Africa (modern Kenya). In January 1939, Balbo was accompanied on one of his flights by German Colonel-General Ernst Udet.

There were distinct signs of German military and diplomatic cooperation with the Italians. General Udet was accompanied by the Head of the German Mechanization Department, and the German military attache to Rome paid a long visit to Egypt. A German Military Mission was present in Benghazi and German pilots were engaged in navigational training flights.

Balbo began road construction projects such as the &quot;Via Balbia&quot; in an attempt to attract Italian immigrants to Libya. He also made efforts to draw Muslims into the Fascist cause. In 1938, Balbo was the only member of the Fascist regime who strongly opposed the new legislation against the Jews, the Italian &quot;Racial Laws&quot;.

In 1939, after the German invasion of Poland, Balbo visited Rome to express his displeasure at Mussolini&#x27;s support for German dictator Adolf Hitler. Balbo was the only Fascist of rank to publicly criticize this aspect of Mussolini&#x27;s foreign policy. He argued that Italy should side with the United Kingdom, but he attracted little following to his argument. When informed of Italy&#x27;s formal alliance with Nazi Germany, Balbo exclaimed: &quot;You will all wind up shining the shoes of the Germans!&quot;

===World War II===
At the time of the Italian declaration of war on 10 June 1940, Balbo was the Governor-General of Libya and Commander-in-Chief of Italian North Africa (&quot;Africa Settentrionale Italiana&quot;, or ASI). He became responsible for planning an invasion of Egypt. After the surrender of France, Balbo was able to shift much of the men and material of the Italian Fifth Army on the Tunisian border to the Tenth Army on the Egyptian border. While he had expressed many legitimate concerns to Mussolini and to Marshal Pietro Badoglio, the Chief-of-Staff in Rome, Balbo still planned to invade Egypt as early as 17 July 1940.

==Death==

On 28 June 1940, Balbo was a passenger on a Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 headed for the Libyan airfield of Tobruk, arriving shortly after the airfield had been attacked by British aircraft. Italian anti-aircraft batteries defending the airfield misidentified the aircraft as British, opening fire upon it as it attempted a landing. It was downed and all on board perished.

Eyewitness General Felice Porro reported that the cruiser &quot;San Giorgio&quot;, serving as a floating anti-aircraft battery, began firing on Balbo&#x27;s aircraft, followed by the airfield&#x27;s anti-aircraft guns. It remains unclear which of them ultimately led to his aircraft being downed.

Rumours that Balbo was assassinated on Mussolini&#x27;s orders have been conclusively debunked. Instead, it is generally accepted that Balbo&#x27;s aircraft was simply misidentified as an enemy target, as it was flying low and coming in against the sun, in addition to the fact of its arrival shortly after an aerial attack by British Bristol Blenheims.

Upon hearing of the death of Balbo, the Commander-in-Chief of the RAF Middle East Command ordered an aircraft dispatched to fly over the Italian airfield to drop a wreath, with the following note of condolence:

Balbo&#x27;s remains were buried outside Tripoli on 4 July 1940. In 1970, Balbo&#x27;s remains were brought back to Italy and buried in Orbetello by Balbo&#x27;s family after Muammar Gaddafi threatened to disinter the Italian cemeteries in Tripoli.

==Memorial==

In 1933, Benito Mussolini presented the city of Chicago with a monument to Balbo. Balbo Drive is a well-known street in the heart of downtown. In 2017, a campaign was launched to rename it. After encountering opposition, the city instead elected to rename another street, Congress Parkway, in honour of Ida B. Wells, a leading Chicago journalist, anti-lynching activist and suffragette.

In post-fascist Italy, most monuments and streets named after Balbo during the Fascist Regime reverted to their pre-fascist names, such as in Palermo, liberated by the Allies in July 1943, where Piazza Italo Balbo reverted to its former name, Piazza Bologna, or were named after anti-fascist partisans, such as in Sanremo, where &quot;Via Italo Balbo&quot; was renamed after partisan Luigi Nuvoloni.

<text>Colonel Maurice James Buckmaster (11 January 1902 – 17 April 1992) was the leader of the French section of Special Operations Executive and was awarded the &quot;Croix de Guerre&quot;.

Apart from his war service, Buckmaster was a corporate manager with the French branch of the Ford Motor Company, in the postwar years serving in Dagenham. He wrote two memoirs about his service with the Resistance during World War II.

==Early life and career==
Maurice Buckmaster was born on 11 January 1902 at Ravenhill, Brereton, Rugeley, Staffordshire, England, the son of Eva Matilda (daughter of R. B. Nason, M.D., of Nuneaton, Warwickshire) and Henry James Buckmaster, a company director running a brewery. He grew up at Marsham Lodge, Gerrards Cross. He was educated at Eton College.

Buckmaster showed an academic bent and gained an exhibition (scholarship) to study Classics at the University of Oxford, but was unable to take this up as his father went bankrupt. After financial problems in early 1912, his father received orders under the &quot;Bankruptcy Act of 1914&quot; in June 1921.

Buckmaster was allowed to stay on at Eton for a final year through a scholarship and by tutoring younger boys, and from that point onwards was entirely dependent on his own resources. After doing some teaching he made his way to France where he soon became almost fluent in the language and gained a reporter&#x27;s position with the French newspaper &quot;Le Matin&quot;. Later he moved into banking for six years where, at Schroeders, he met his future wife May Dorothy Steed (born in Lima in 1904). They married in 1927 and had three children, Michael (known as Tim) in 1930, Sybil Romola (in Paris, 1933) and Mary (known as Tina) back in London in 1935. In 1929, he was employed to help establish branches of the Ford Motor Company in several European countries, eventually becoming a senior manager with the French branch of the American Ford Motor Company. While travelling throughout France in this role he gained very considerable knowledge of the towns and the road network.

==Early wartime service==
When World War II broke out, Buckmaster returned to England. He joined the British Army and on 14 October 1939 was commissioned to the General List as a lieutenant (service number 101877). He joined the British Expeditionary Force and fought in France until the retreat to Dunkirk, evacuating on one of the last boats out on 2 June 1940. On his return from France, Buckmaster transferred from the General List to the Intelligence Corps with effect from 15 July 1940 and was promoted to temporary captain.

Following this, Buckmaster was an intelligence officer with 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division, which he decided to leave after the division was scheduled to move to the Middle East. He was involved in Operation Menace in September 1940, a failed attempt to seize the port of Dakar in former French territory. Following a meeting with Gerald Templer, he was recruited into Special Operations Executive (SOE), or MO1(SP).
On 20 December 1940, his services in the Battle of France and at Dunkirk were recognized and he was mentioned in dispatches. The official record shows his rank as second lieutenant acting major.

==Special Operations Executive==
On 17 March 1941, Buckmaster was appointed to SOE&#x27;s French section and following an attachment to T-Section, the Belgian Section, to assist Hardy Amies from July 1941, he was noted as a future head of F Section. This section recruited agents from among those Frenchmen who had not chosen to directly ally themselves with General Charles de Gaulle. A separate section of SOE, RF Section, worked with those members of the French Resistance who were clearly Gaullist in their loyalties. There was often considerable tension between F and RF sections.

In September 1941, succeeding the civilian Henry R. Marriott (a director of Courtaulds French Division), Major Buckmaster assumed command of F Section, supported by Nicholas Bodington, working from an apartment in Orchard Court near Oxford Street. His task was to build an organization which could carry out sabotage and collect information about the enemy and provide money and equipment for the French resistance. Between 1941 and 1944, his organization placed 366 agents in France and set up nearly 50 networks. The office later moved to 64 Baker Street, London.

In Chelsea, London in November 1941, Buckmaster married Anna Cecilia Stevenson (née Reinstein). She was the daughter of a Bavarian German hairdresser brought up in East London, and the former wife of the barrister Melford Stevenson.

At F Section, Buckmaster worked closely with his assistant Vera Atkins, who was also the section&#x27;s intelligence officer and a spy mistress. During the war, the F Section handled over 400 undercover agents, many of whom went missing. After the war, it would be Atkins&#x27; task to find out what had happened to them, including agents she had trained. It turned out that Buckmaster had refused to believe, although shown evidence, that their network had been compromised, thus sending many agents to their arrests and deaths for over a year, despite warnings from agents. During the war, he usually worked 16 to 18 hours per day and frequently more.

In the autumn of 1944, Buckmaster was promoted to colonel and toured newly freed France, giving lectures and delivering speeches on a mission based in the Hotel Cecil in Paris and known as &quot;JUDEX&quot; which also provided the opportunity to clear up F Section&#x27;s circuits and networks.

Buckmaster&#x27;s wartime service was recognized by an award of the OBE, unusually in the Civil Division, on 3 January 1945 (Colonel Buckmaster was discreetly listed as a &quot;Civil Assistant&quot; at the &quot;War Office&quot;) and a Croix de Guerre from the French.

At the end of the war, Allied commander General Dwight D. Eisenhower said the section had helped shorten the war by six months. &quot;It was the equivalent of 15 divisions,&quot; he said.
On 23 May 1947, the US Government awarded Buckmaster the Legion of Merit (Officer) which appeared in the &quot;London Gazette&quot;, and he was listed as a colonel with the Intelligence Corps.

==After World War II==
After the war, Buckmaster rejoined the Ford Motor Company, serving in Dagenham as director of public affairs. In 1946 and 1947, he wrote a series of eight articles on F Section for the now-defunct &quot;Chambers Magazine&quot;, entitled &quot;They Came By Parachute&quot;. He wrote two memoirs, &quot;Specially Employed&quot; (1952) and &quot;They Fought Alone&quot; (1958). He was interviewed for the 1969 documentary &quot;The Sorrow and the Pity&quot;.

In the official history of &quot;SOE in France&quot; (HMSO), a part of the series of campaign histories commissioned by the British government, author M.R.D. Foot wrote of Buckmaster, &quot;He was a colourful and in many ways a controversial figure; he was not universally popular, but no better head for the section was ever in sight.&quot; Buckmaster was an adviser on, and appeared as himself in, the film &quot;Odette&quot;, about Odette Sansom (then Odette Churchill, later Hallowes).

Maurice Buckmaster Lane, built on the former Joint Services School of Intelligence site in Ashford, Kent, is named after him.
