<text>The Dark Crystal is a 1982 dark fantasy film directed by Jim Henson and Frank Oz. It stars the voices of Stephen Garlick, Lisa Maxwell, Billie Whitelaw, Percy Edwards, and Barry Dennen. The film was produced by ITC Entertainment and The Jim Henson Company and distributed by Universal Pictures. The plot revolves around Jen and Kira, two Gelflings on a quest to restore balance to the world of Thra and overthrow the evil, ruling Skeksis by restoring a powerful broken Crystal.

It was marketed as a family film, but was notably darker than the creators&#x27; previous material. The animatronics used in the film were considered groundbreaking for the time, with most creatures, like the Gelflings, requiring around four puppeteers to achieve full manipulation. The primary concept artist was fantasy illustrator Brian Froud, famous for his distinctive fairy and dwarf designs. Froud also collaborated with Henson on the 1986 fantasy film &quot;Labyrinth&quot;.

&quot;The Dark Crystal&quot; was produced by Gary Kurtz, while the screenplay was written by David Odell, with whom Henson previously worked as a staff writer for &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;. The film score was composed by Trevor Jones. The film initially received mixed reviews from mainstream critics; while being criticized for its darker, more dramatic tone in contrast to Henson&#x27;s previous works, it was praised for its narrative, aesthetic, and characters. Over the years, it has been re-evaluated by critics and has garnered a cult following.

An Emmy Award-winning prequel television series, &quot;The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance&quot;, premiered on Netflix in 2019 and ran for one season.

==Plot==

On the blighted planet Thra a thousand years earlier, a powerful crystal cracked and two new races appeared: the cruel Skeksis, who use the crystal&#x27;s power to extend their lives, and gentle Mystics, the urRu, who dwell in a secluded valley. Among the Mystics is Jen, a young Gelfling adopted after the Skeksis slaughtered his clan. As the Great Conjunction of the world&#x27;s three suns draws near, the dying Mystic Master instructs Jen to fulfill a prophecy to heal the crystal by first retrieving a missing shard from Aughra. If Jen fails to complete his quest before the three suns meet, the Skeksis will rule forever. The Master then dies, and the Skeksis Emperor dies at the same moment. The Skeksis General successfully challenges the Chamberlain for succession in a &quot;trial by stone&quot; and banishes him from the castle. When the Skeksis learn of Jen&#x27;s existence, they send their army of giant crab-like Garthim to capture him, with the cunning Chamberlain following.

Jen meets Aughra and enters her orrery. Offered several shards, he chooses one that responds when he plays the Mystics&#x27; chord on his flute. Before Aughra can explain Jen&#x27;s mission, the Garthim arrive and destroy the orrery, taking Aughra prisoner as Jen flees. Hearing the call of the crystal, the Mystics leave their valley and journey to the castle. On his journey through a forest swamp, Jen meets Kira, another Gelfling. The two learn more about each other when they accidentally &quot;dreamfast&quot;, sharing each other&#x27;s memories. They stay for a night with the Podlings who raised Kira, only for them and Kira&#x27;s pet Fizzgig to flee when the Garthim raid the village. They are nearly caught, but the Chamberlain orders the Garthim back.

Jen and Kira discover a ruined Gelfling city where a prophecy is inscribed:

Jen realizes that he must take the shard to the castle. The Chamberlain approaches and begs them to come to the castle with him. The Gelflings flee and reach the castle on Landstriders, intercepting the Garthim that raided Kira&#x27;s village. They attack to free the Podlings but are cornered. Kira grabs Jen and Fizzgig and reveals wings that she uses to glide into the castle&#x27;s dry moat. They enter the castle through the catacombs while above the Skeksis Scientist uses the crystal&#x27;s rays to extract vital essence from Podlings. The Emperor drinks the essence and finds that it has only temporary restorative effects. The Chamberlain tries again to seize the Gelflings, and Jen stabs his hand with the shard; elsewhere the Mystic Chanter notices a wound on his hand. Enraged, the Chamberlain buries Jen in a cave-in and takes Kira as a gift to the Emperor. The Emperor reinstates him and orders Kira drained of essence. Aughra, imprisoned in the laboratory, tells Kira to call the captive animals for help. They break free and attack the Scientist, who deflects the draining prism before falling into the fiery crystal shaft; on a rocky plain, the Mystic Alchemist vanishes in flames. Aughra frees herself while Jen, awakened by Kira&#x27;s call, climbs up the shaft to the laboratory.

The Gelflings make their way to a hall overlooking the crystal chamber, where the Skeksis gather for the conjunction ceremony. When the Skeksis spot them and order the Garthim to attack, Jen leaps onto the crystal but drops the shard. Kira glides down to the chamber, grabs the shard and throws it to Jen before the High Priest stabs her fatally. As the suns align Jen plunges the shard into the crystal, producing a force that throws him aside. The Garthim disintegrate and the drained Podlings regain their vitality while the dark stone covering the castle crumbles to reveal a crystalline structure. The Mystics arrive and use the crystal&#x27;s light to draw the Skeksis to themselves, merging into angelic urSkeks. The urSkek leader tells Jen that they shattered the crystal a thousand years ago, sundering themselves and upsetting the world&#x27;s balance. They revive Kira in gratitude and ascend toward the suns, leaving the crystal to light the rejuvenated world.

==Production==
===Development===
Henson&#x27;s inspiration for the visual aspects of the film came around 1975–76, after he saw an illustration by Leonard B. Lubin in a 1975 edition of Lewis Carroll&#x27;s poetry showing crocodiles living in a palace and wearing elaborate robes and jewelry. The film&#x27;s conceptual roots lay in Henson&#x27;s short-lived &quot;The Land of Gorch&quot;, which also took place in an alien world with no human characters. According to co-director Frank Oz, Henson&#x27;s intention was to &quot;get back to the darkness of the original Grimms&#x27; Fairy Tales&quot;, as he believed that it was unhealthy for children to never be afraid.

Henson formulated his ideas into a 25-page story he entitled &quot;The Crystal&quot;, which he wrote whilst snowed in at an airport hotel. Henson&#x27;s original concept was set in a world called Mithra, a wooded land with talking mountains, walking boulders and animal-plant hybrids. The original plot involved a malevolent race called the Reptus group, which took power in a coup against the peaceful Eunaze, led by Malcolm the Wise. The last survivor of the Eunaze was Malcolm&#x27;s son Brian, who was adopted by the Bada, Mithra&#x27;s mystical wizards.

This draft contained elements in the final product, including the three races, the two funerals, the quest, a female secondary character, the Crystal, and the reunification of the two races during the Great Conjunction. &quot;Mithra&quot; was later abbreviated to &quot;Thra&quot;, due to similarities the original name had with an ancient Persian deity. The character Kira was also at that point called Dee.

Most of the philosophical undertones of the film were inspired by Jane Roberts&#x27;s &quot;Seth Material&quot;. Henson kept multiple copies of the book &quot;Seth Speaks&quot;, and insisted that Froud and screenwriter David Odell read it prior to collaborating for the film. Odell later wrote that Aughra&#x27;s line &quot;He could be anywhere then,&quot; upon being told by Jen that his Master was dead, could not have been written without having first read Roberts&#x27; material.

The Bada were renamed &quot;Ooo-urrrs&quot;, which Henson would pronounce &quot;very slowly and with a deep resonant voice.&quot; Odell simplified the spelling to urRu, though they were ultimately named Mystics in the theatrical cut. The word &quot;Skeksis&quot; was initially meant to be the plural, with &quot;Skesis&quot; being singular, though this was dropped early in the filming process. Originally, Henson wanted the Skeksis to speak their own constructed language, with the dialogue subtitled in English.

Accounts differ as to who constructed the language, and on what it was based. Gary Kurtz stated that the Skeksis language was conceived by author Alan Garner, who based it on Ancient Egyptian, while Odell stated it was he who created it, and that it was formed from Indo-European roots. This idea was dropped after test screening audiences found the captions too distracting, but the original effect can be observed in selected scenes on the various DVD releases. The language of the Podlings was based on Serbo-Croatian, with Kurtz noting that audience members fluent in Polish, Russian and other Slavic languages could understand individual words, but not whole sentences.

The film was shot at Elstree Studios from April–September 1981, and exterior scenes were shot in the Scottish Highlands; Gordale Scar, North Yorkshire, England; and Twycross, Leicestershire, England. Once filming was completed, the film&#x27;s release was delayed after Lew Grade sold ITC Entertainment to Robert Holmes à Court, who was skeptical of the film&#x27;s potential, due to the bad reactions at the preview and the need to re-voice the film&#x27;s soundtrack. The film was afforded minimal advertisement and release until Henson bought it from Holmes à Court and funded its release with his own money.

===Design===

Brian Froud was chosen as concept artist after Henson saw one of his paintings in the book &quot;Once upon a time&quot;. The characters in the film are elaborate puppets, and none are based on humans or any other specific Earth creature. Before its release, &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot; was billed as the first live-action film without any humans on screen, and &quot;a showcase for cutting-edge animatronics&quot;.

The hands and facial features of the ground-breaking animatronic puppets in the film were controlled with relatively primitive rods and cables, although radio control later took over many of the subtler movements. Human performers inside the puppets supplied basic movement for the larger creatures, which in some cases was dangerous or exhausting. Swiss mime Jean-Pierre Amiel led a team of dancers, acrobats and others in performing the Mystics, with Amiel himself performing the Weaver Mystic. Both Jen&#x27;s dying Mystic master and the Ritual Guardian were performed by Brian Muehl, a recurring puppeteer on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; at the time, and many of the other Mystic performers would go on to work on the &quot;Star Wars&quot; film &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, as would two of the Skeksis&#x27; puppeteers, Mike Quinn (Slave Master) and Tim Rose (Treasurer).

When conceptualizing the Skeksis, Henson had in mind the seven deadly sins, though because there were ten Skeksis, some sins had to be invented or used twice. Froud originally designed them to resemble deep sea fish, but later designed them as &quot;part reptile, part predatory bird, part dragon&quot;, with an emphasis on giving them a &quot;penetrating stare.&quot; Each Skeksis was conceived as having a different &quot;job&quot; or function, thus each puppet was draped in multicolored robes meant to reflect their personalities and thought processes.

Each Skeksis suit required a main performer (from Jim Henson&#x27;s main team of puppeteers, most of whom had previously worked on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;), whose arm would be extended over his or her head in order to operate the creature&#x27;s facial movements, while the other arm operated its left hand. Another performer would operate the Skeksis&#x27; right arm. A team of four technicians operated the Skeksis&#x27; hand and face animatronics. The Skeksis performers compensated for their lack of vision by having a monitor tied to their chests. The Chamberlain Skeksis, in particular, was built with 21 electronic components.

One Skesis puppet, identified as &quot;SkekGek,&quot; is displayed at The Museum of the Moving Image.
In designing the Mystics, Froud portrayed them as being more connected to the natural world than their Skeksis counterparts. Henson intended to convey the idea that they were purged of all materialistic urges, yet were incapable of acting in the real world. Froud also incorporated geometric symbolism throughout the film in order to hint at the implied unity of the two races. The Mystics were the hardest creatures to perform, as the actors had to walk on their haunches with their right arm extended forward, with the full weight of the head on it. Henson stated that he could hold a position in a Mystic costume for only 5–10 seconds.

The Gelflings were designed and sculpted by Wendy Midener. They were difficult to perform, as they were meant to be the most human creatures in the film, and thus their movements, particularly their gait, had to be as realistic as possible. During scenes when the Gelflings&#x27; legs were off-camera, the performers walked on their knees in order to make the character&#x27;s movements more lifelike. According to Odell, the character Jen was Henson&#x27;s way of projecting himself into the film. Jen was originally meant to be blue, in homage to the Hindu deity Rama, but this idea was scrapped early on.

Aughra was originally envisioned as a &quot;busy, curious little creature&quot; called Habeetabat, though the name was rejected by Froud, who found the name too similar to Habitat, a retailer he despised. The character was re-envisioned as a seer or prophetess, and renamed Aughra. In selecting a voice actor for Aughra, Henson was inspired by Zero Mostel&#x27;s performance as a &quot;kind of insane bird trying to overcome Tourettes syndrome&quot; on &quot;Watership Down&quot;. Although the character was originally voiced by Oz, Henson wanted a female voice, and subsequently selected Billie Whitelaw.

The character Fizzgig was invented by Oz, who wanted a character who served the same function as the Muppet poodle Foo-Foo, feeling that, like Miss Piggy, the character Kira needed an outlet for her caring, nurturing side. The character&#x27;s design was meant to convey the idea of a &quot;boyfriend-repellant&quot;, to contrast the popular idea that it is easier to form a bond with a member of the opposite sex with the assistance of a cute dog.

The Podlings were envisioned as people in complete harmony with their natural surroundings, thus Froud based their design on that of potatoes. Their village was modeled on the Henson family home.

In designing the Garthim, Froud took inspiration from the discarded carapaces of his and Henson&#x27;s lobster dinners. The Garthim were first designed three years into the making of the film, and were made largely of fiberglass. Each costume weighed around , thus Garthim performers still in costume had to frequently be suspended on racks in order to recuperate.

&quot;The Dark Crystal&quot; was the last film in which cinematographer Oswald Morris, BSC, involved himself in before retiring. He shot all the footage with a &quot;light flex&quot;, a unit placed in front of the camera which gave a faint color tint to each scene in order to give the film a more fairy tale atmosphere similar to Froud&#x27;s original paintings.

===Music===
The film&#x27;s soundtrack was composed by Trevor Jones, who became involved before shooting had started. Jones initially wanted to compose a score which reflected the settings&#x27; oddness by using acoustical instruments, electronics and building structures. This was scrapped in favor of an orchestral score performed by the London Symphony Orchestra once Gary Kurtz became involved, as it was felt that an unusual score would alienate audiences. The main theme of the film is a composite of the Skeksis&#x27; and Mystics&#x27; themes. Jones wrote the baby Landstrider theme in honor of his newly born daughter.

==Release==

===Box office===
&quot;The Dark Crystal&quot; was released in 858 theaters in North America on December 17, 1982 and finished third for the weekend with a gross of $4,657,335, behind &quot;Tootsie&quot; and &quot;The Toy&quot;, performing better than some people expected. In its initial weekends, it had a limited appeal with some audiences for various reasons, including parental concerns about its dark nature when contrasted with Henson&#x27;s family-friendly Muppet franchise. In its third weekend, it moved up to second place nationally with a gross of $5,405,071 from 1,052 screens. It made $40,577,001 in its box office run, managing to turn a profit. The film became the 16th highest-grossing film of 1982 within North America. To date, it technically remains as one of the highest-grossing puppet animated films of all time, particularly for its domestic gross.

It made £2.4 million in the UK.

===Reception===
The film received a mixed response upon its original release, but has earned a more positive reception in later years, becoming a favorite with fans of Henson and fantasy. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; negatively reviewed the film, describing it as a &quot;watered down J. R. R. Tolkien... without charm as well as interest.&quot; Kevin Thomas gave it a more positive assessment in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;: &quot;Unlike many screen fantasies, &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot; casts its spell from its very first frames and proceeds so briskly that it&#x27;s over before you realize it. You&#x27;re left with the feeling that you have just awakened from a dream.&quot; Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; magazine wrote: &quot;The invention is impressive, but there is little indication of the Henson-Oz trademark: a sense of giddy fun. Audiences nourished on the sophisticated child&#x27;s play of the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; Muppets and the music-hall camaraderie of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; may not be ready to relinquish pleasure for awe as they enter &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot;″s palatial cavern.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; praised the film as &quot;a dazzling technological and artistic achievement ...that could teach a lesson in morality to youngsters at the same time it is entertaining their parents.&quot;

Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote the main characters were &quot;the softest and potentially weakest figures&quot; in the film, but nevertheless, &quot;&quot;The Dark Crystal&quot; leaves no doubt that Jim Henson and his colleagues have reached a point where they can create and sustain a powerfully enchanting form of cinematic fantasy.&quot; Gene Siskel of &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot; awarded the film out of four stars in which he felt &quot;...the resultant absence of dramatic tension cripples &#x27;Crystal,&#x27; which doesn&#x27;t have much going for it save for weird characters, who look like they just walked in from the bar scene in &quot;Star Wars&quot;. In fact, a lot of this movie looks like it was ripped off from &quot;Star Wars&quot;.&quot; Colin Greenland, reviewing for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, stated that &quot;&quot;The Dark Crystal&quot; is a technical masterpiece with splendid special effects work by a team two dozen strong. It may be that they did well to keep the story simple and then lavish a wealth of detail on it, rather than go for a more complicated fantasy and fail.&quot;

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of based on reviews, with an average rating of . The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;&quot;The Dark Crystal&quot;″s narrative never quite lives up to the movie&#x27;s visual splendor, but it remains an admirably inventive and uniquely intense entry in the Jim Henson canon.&quot; On Metacritic it has a weighted average score of 66 out of 100 based on reviews from 13 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

In 2008, the American Film Institute nominated this film for its Top 10 Fantasy Films list.

The company&#x27;s successor HBO Video re-released it on VHS in 1988 and also released it in widescreen on LaserDisc for the first time. On July 29, 1994, Jim Henson Video (through Disney&#x27;s Buena Vista Home Video) re-released the film again on VHS and on a new widescreen LaserDisc. On October 5, 1999, Columbia TriStar Home Video and Jim Henson Home Entertainment gave the film one final VHS release and also released it on DVD for the first time and it has had multiple re-releases since including a Collector&#x27;s Edition on November 25, 2003, and a 25th Anniversary Edition on August 14, 2007. It was also released on UMD Universal Media Disc for PlayStation Portable (PSP) on July 26, 2005. It was released on Blu-ray on September 29, 2009.

Another anniversary edition of &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot; was announced in December 2017, with a brand-new restoration from the original camera negative, and was released on Blu-ray and 4K Blu-ray on March 6, 2018. Prior to the 4K/Blu-Ray release, Fathom Events presented the restored print of &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot; in US cinemas on February 25 and 28, and March 3 and 6, 2018.

On January 1, 2024, a worldwide distribution agreement signed between Shout! Studios and the Jim Henson Company for &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot; and &quot;Labyrinth&quot; as well as associated content went into effect. The agreement grants Shout! Studios streaming, video-on-demand, broadcast, digital download, packaged media and limited non-theatrical rights to the films. The company released the films on all major digital entertainment platforms on February 6, 2024.

==Novelization==
A tie-in novelization of the film was written by A. C. H. Smith. Henson took a keen interest in the novelization, as he considered it a legitimate part of the film&#x27;s world rather than just an advertisement. He originally asked Alan Garner to write it, but Garner declined on account of prior engagements. Henson and Smith met several times over meals to discuss the progress of the manuscript. According to Smith, their only major disagreement had arisen over his dislike of the Podlings, which he considered &quot;boring&quot;. He included a scene in which a Garthim carrying a sackful of Podlings fell down a cliff and crushed them. Henson considered this scene to be an element of &quot;gratuitous cruelty&quot; that did not fit well into the scope of the story. In order to assist Smith in his visualizing the world of &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot;, Henson invited him to visit Elstree Studios during filming. In June 2014, Archaia Entertainment reprinted the novelization, with included extras such as some of Brian Froud&#x27;s illustrations and Jim Henson&#x27;s notes.

==Cancelled sequel==
During the development phase of &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot;, director Jim Henson and writer David Odell discussed ideas for a possible sequel. Almost 25 years later, Odell and his wife Annette Duffy pieced together what Odell could recall from these discussions to draft a script for &quot;The Power of the Dark Crystal&quot;. Genndy Tartakovsky was initially hired in January 2006 to direct and produce the film through The Orphanage animation studios in California.

However, faced with considerable delays, the Jim Henson Company announced a number of significant changes in a May 2010 press release: It was going to partner with Australia-based Omnilab Media to produce the sequel, screenwriter Craig Pearce had reworked Odell and Duffy&#x27;s script, and directing team Michael and Peter Spierig were replacing Tartakovsky. In addition, the film would be released in stereoscopic 3D.

During a panel held at the Museum of the Moving Image on September 18, 2011, to commemorate the legacy of Jim Henson, his daughter Cheryl revealed that the project was yet again on hiatus. By February 2012 Omnilab Media and the Spierig brothers had parted ways with the Henson Company due to budgetary concerns; production on the film has been suspended indefinitely. In May 2014, Lisa Henson confirmed that the film was still in development, but it was not yet in pre-production.

Ultimately, plans for a feature film were scrapped, and the unproduced screenplay was adapted into a 12-issue comic book series &quot;The Power of the Dark Crystal&quot; from Archaia Comics and BOOM! Studios, released in 2017.

==Spin-offs==
===Prequel comics===
&quot;Legends of the Dark Crystal&quot;, an original English-language manga written by Barbara Kesel with art by Heidi Arnhold, Jessica Feinberg, and Max Kim, was published by Tokyopop. Its story is set hundreds of years before the events of &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot;, after the Great Conjunction which saw the splitting of the urSkeks into the Mystics and the Skeksis, but before the extermination of the Gelflings. The first volume of the series came out November 2007, followed sometime later by the second in August 2010. A third installment had been originally planned but was canceled and subsequently merged into the second volume.

Another comic book prequel, &quot;The Dark Crystal: Creation Myths&quot;, was published by Archaia Entertainment as a series of three graphic novels. The Henson Company and Archaia began collaborating on this project in late 2009. A brief preview was made available on Free Comic Book Day in May 2011, and the first installment was released January 2012, shortly thereafter spending two weeks on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list of hardcover graphic books. In February 2013, the second installment was officially released. The third and final part was released in October 2015.

===Prequel novels===
On July 1, 2013, an announcement was made by The Jim Henson Company, in association with Grosset and Dunlap (a publishing division of Penguin Group USA) that they would be hosting a Dark Crystal Author Quest contest to write a new &quot;Dark Crystal&quot; novel, as a prequel to the original film. It would be set in the Dark Crystal world during a Gelfling Gathering. The winning author was J.M. (Joseph) Lee of Minneapolis, Minnesota, whose story, &quot;The Ring of Dreams,&quot; was selected from almost 500 contest submissions.

The novel series consists of four books: &quot;Shadows of the Dark Crystal&quot;, released on June 28, 2016; &quot;Song of the Dark Crystal&quot;, released July 18, 2017; &quot;Tides of the Dark Crystal&quot;, released December 24, 2018; and &quot;Flames of the Dark Crystal&quot;, released on August 27, 2019. Together, the novels serve to establish the setting of the Netflix series &quot;The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance&quot;, focusing on adventures of some of the series&#x27; side characters.

===Prequel series===

In May 2017, it was announced that The Jim Henson Company in association with Netflix would produce a prequel series titled &quot;The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance&quot;. Shooting began in the fall of 2017 with Louis Leterrier as director. The prequel was written by Jeffrey Addiss, Will Matthews, and Javier Grillo-Marxuach. The series premiered on August 30, 2019 and explores in ten episodes the world created for the original film.

*The song &quot;Return to Oz&quot; by the band Scissor Sisters on the album &quot;Scissor Sisters&quot; (2004) features a reference to the film&#x27;s antagonists the Skeksis: &quot;The Skeksis at the rave meant to hide deep inside their sunken faces and their wild, rolling eyes, But their callous words reveal that they can no longer feel.&quot;
* The song &quot;Skeksis&quot; on the album &quot;Alien&quot; by Canadian band Strapping Young Lad is named after the film&#x27;s antagonists; the song itself contains an interpolation of the film&#x27;s theme melody. Singer-songwriter Devin Townsend would later base Ziltoid the Omniscient on the characters from the film.
* &quot;Dark Crystal Tales&quot; by Cory Godbey, a children&#x27;s book of short stories, was released in August 2017.
* A book entitled &quot;The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance: Inside the Epic Return to Thra&quot; was released in November 2019, two months after the Netflix series premiered. It details the making of the series and features concept art, interviews, set photography, and more.
* In October 2020, a guide to the characters and creatures from the Dark Crystal universe called &quot;The Dark Crystal Bestiary: The Definitive Guide to the Creatures of Thra&quot; was released.
* In January 2021, the River Horse company has announced that it is developing a role-playing game set in the world of both the original film and the Netflix prequel series called &quot;The Dark Crystal Adventure Game&quot; that will be released in 2021.
* In March 2021, it was announced that the Royal Opera House will adapt the film into a ballet entitled &quot;The Dark Crystal: Odyssey&quot;. It will be directed and choreographed by Wayne McGregor and is described as a &quot;coming-of-age story&quot; for family audiences.

<text>Simon Proctor (born 1959) is a British composer and pianist, known for his works for unusual instruments.

==Education==
Proctor graduated from the Royal Academy of Music where he gained the GRSM degree, LRAM diploma in piano and several prizes for composition, orchestration and piano.

==Career==
His best-known work, the Concerto for Serpent and Orchestra, was written in 1987 when the composer was attached to the University of South Carolina. Its premiere, with the soloist Alan Lumsden and the University of South Carolina Chamber Orchestra under Donald Portnoy, was at the First International Serpent Festival on 21 October 1989. Douglas Yeo performed it again on 31 March 1997 at New England Conservatory, and then on 29 and 30 May 1997 with the Boston Pops Orchestra conducted by John Williams, both in Boston.

Other compositions include his Concerto for Keyed Bugle and Orchestra. The &quot;Amherst Suite&quot; also features 8 serpents. He composed a &quot;Jubilee Fanfare&quot; for the RHS Bicentennial, which was attended by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.

He has also composed a great number of other works, including 26 concertos, and many works for solo piano including a seven-part fugue.

He composed a symphony, which included a hand bell ensemble, for the Lincoln Park Academy Orchestra in 1998.

He composed a &quot;James Bond&quot; Piano Concerto. This had its world premiere on 20 February 2010 in Cadogan Hall, London. It was performed by the London Gay Symphony Orchestra. Thomas Pandolfi was the solo pianist.

Proctor is a graduate of the Royal Academy of Music. He lives in Sevenoaks, Kent and teaches piano in several schools with Kent Music centre, and privately. He has performed solo piano recitals in the UK, Germany, USA and The Bahamas. Simon has played principal keyboard for Les Miserables and other shows, and has acted as musical director for other productions.

He has made two CDs of his compositions, &quot;Sounds of Kent – Piano&quot; (recorded by 12-year-old Tyler Hay), and &quot;Sounds of Kent – Woodwind&quot; (recorded by the Pneuma Quintet, a wind quintet of students from the Royal Academy of Music). A movement from his Concerto for Ophicleide and Orchestra has been recorded by Nick Byrne and David Miller. In 2022 his album entitled Virtuoso Piano Works, played by Tyler Hay, was released by American Label Parma Recordings. His Serpent Concerto was recorded by Douglas Yeo on the CD &quot;Le Monde du Serpent&quot;.

<text>AppleLink was the name of both Apple Computer&#x27;s online service for its dealers, third-party developers, and users, and the client software used to access it. Prior to the commercialization of the Internet, AppleLink was a popular service for Mac and Apple IIGS users. The service was offered from about 1986 to 1994 to various groups, before being superseded by their short-lived eWorld and finally today&#x27;s multiple Apple websites.

== Early years ==

The original AppleLink, which went online in 1985, was a service available only to Apple employees and dealers, and shortly thereafter to Apple University Consortium members. Apple&#x27;s consumer 800 number in fact touted this fact, promoting your dealer as the place to turn for help because of his access to AppleLink. In the late 1980s the service was also opened up to software developers, who could use it both as an end-user support system as well as a conduit to Apple development for questions and suggestions.

AppleLink used client software written in Pascal under contract to Apple by Pete Burnight/Central Coast Software. The program extended the desktop metaphor of the Macintosh Finder to encompass the areas on the remote server site. These were displayed as folders and files just as local folders and files were. In addition, there was a set of public bulletin boards, and the ability to use email via the service—although initially only between AppleLink users. File transfer for drivers and system software was another important role, and for this Apple created the AppleLink Package format to combine and compress the two forks of a Macintosh file into one for storage and sending. Apple also developed their Communications Control Language (CCL) for AppleLink, a language still used in a very similar form for today&#x27;s Macintosh modem scripts.

The &quot;back end&quot; of the AppleLink system was hosted on General Electric&#x27;s Information Services (GEIS) (division) Mark III time-sharing mainframes and worldwide communications network. AppleLink translated the user&#x27;s GUI actions into a transaction protocol that was sent into a server program running on the mainframe. The connection used a proprietary error free sliding window protocol called EF3. Later versions upgraded this protocol to GEIS&#x27; &quot;EFX&quot; (Error-Free eXtended) protocol. GEIS charged fairly substantial prices to Apple, both for maintaining the service (about $30 million a year per year), and the end-users&#x27; connection fees of about $15 an hour during business hours (which Apple rebilled to the users). For some years prior to the discontinuation of the system, GEIS maintained a number of employees on the campus of Apple&#x27;s Cupertino, California, headquarters, co-located with the Apple On-Line Services organization. Repeated attempts to negotiate a lower cost failed, and Apple management chafed at paying for a service that had no obviously measurable income.

Eventually Apple approached Steve Case of Quantum Computer Services, who ran a somewhat similar system for users of the Commodore 64. They reached an agreement in which Apple and Quantum would develop a new system known as AppleLink Personal Edition, which would be intended for end-users until all existing AppleLink content could be moved over and the system proved itself stable enough for support services as well. Beta-test users were generally disappointed that the new service did not give them access to the &quot;real&quot; AppleLink, and eventually the service was released instead as America Online. Aaron Marcus and Associates, Inc., under contract to Apple and working closely with Apple&#x27;s software engineers, designed the icons, dialogue boxes and screen layout for AppleLink Personal Edition. These icons and some dialogue boxes were incorporated into the first graphical user-interface design of America Online.

Meanwhile, interested in selling the system to other customers, GEIS developed both DOS and eventually Windows based versions of the client software and sold the system as &quot;DealerTalk&quot; starting in 1986, aiming at the Apple model of manufacturers using the system to communicate with their dealers. All the systems, including the AppleLink community, were united behind the scenes as part of GEIS&#x27; worldwide Quik-Comm E-mail service and could exchange mail with each other and all GEIS mail customers, using addresses like MICHAEL@APPLELINK or JOHNDOE@GEIS. This was later expanded to include Internet mail addresses. Eventually, the GEIS products were renamed BusinessTalk and after a complete system rewrite and creation of their own Macintosh client program (never incorporated into AppleLink), again renamed BusinessTalk System 2000 in 1992. During this time the system, with the Windows client, also became the foundation for Microsoft&#x27;s first on-line service for developers, the Microsoft Partner Network (MSPN).

== E-mail from space ==
On August 9, 1991, AppleLink, running on a Macintosh Portable was used to send the first e-mail from space, aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis, mission STS-43.

Atlantis astronauts Shannon Lucid and James C. Adamson with the help of Dave Crego, an engineer at Apple, sent a message to Marcia Ivins, a shuttle communicator at Johnson Space Center. The Message read:&quot;Hello Earth! Greetings from the STS-43 Crew. This is the first AppleLink from space. Having a GREAT time, wish you were here...send cryo and RCS! Hasta la vista, baby...we&#x27;ll be back!&quot;The AppleLink software was configured with a special Macintosh Communications ToolBox Connection Tool that interfaced to NASA&#x27;s communication system which allowed the Shuttle to call up GEIS&#x27; network from space. The Shuttle&#x27;s e-mail address was secret, but exposed to GEIS&#x27; e-mail network as any other AppleLink address. To avoid a deluge of incoming mail resulting from the publicity of the event, Apple set up a number of obvious &quot;honeypot&quot; addresses not really used by the Shuttle crew, such as STS43@APPLELINK. Most of the well-wishers&#x27; e-mail went there, rather than to the real Atlantis address.

== Demise ==

Quantum retained rights to the AppleLink Personal Edition software, and released a version for both the Mac and Microsoft Windows machines in 1989, calling the new service America Online as Apple owned the AppleLink name. In 1991 the service had grown substantially, and the company was renamed as America Online Inc. The original AOL Macintosh software still retained within it vestiges of its GEIS/AppleLink heritage. It was not lost on GEIS engineers that it included a version of their proprietary EF3 protocol which was never Apple&#x27;s intellectual property to share with Quantum. It was handed over anyway as part of the Macintosh source code, thanks to John Sculley, Apple&#x27;s CEO at the time. Although no legal action was ever pursued, this further soured the technical relationship between GEIS and Apple in the final years of AppleLink, especially since by then AOL was competing with GEIS&#x27; own consumer service, GEnie. As a result, when GEIS developed the improved EFX and upgraded AppleLink, it never released source code to Apple, supplying only a copyrighted code-resource for the protocol.

Apple, encouraged by AOL&#x27;s success and still wanting to turn the cost of AppleLink into a profit center, decided to re-enter the market. After a months-long RFP process that included GEIS as an unsuccessful bidder, Apple approached AOL at the end of 1992 to host a private-label system known as eWorld. By this time AOL had grown to be both much larger than GEIS, so all AppleLink content was to be moved over as well, allowing the GEIS service to be shut down. The eWorld software was basically a version of the original AOL software with custom graphics, giving it a distinctive look. The system was ready for launch in mid-1994.

However, by this point the rapid rise of the Internet was generally killing off all smaller online services and bulletin board systems, and online systems were generally seen as antiquated. Apple was never able to turn a profit on eWorld, and shut it down after a little over a year of operation, before it was able to supplant AppleLink. Subsequently, Apple moved all of its services and replaced all of the AppleLink content. The first step involved a site within AOL&#x27;s Computing Channel at keyword &quot;Apple&quot;. Later, this site was shut down and replaced with website addressed by subdomains under apple.com. The AppleLink service itself was finally shut down at the end of March 1997.

AppleLink&#x27;s server machines (not the GEIS mainframes) were named for various famous musical composers: Beethoven, Copland, Lennon, etc.

<text>A digital video recorder (DVR), also referred to as a personal video recorder (PVR) particularly in Canadian and British English, is an electronic device that records video in a digital format to a disk drive, USB flash drive, SD memory card, SSD or other local or networked mass storage device. The term includes set-top boxes (STB) with direct to disk recording, portable media players and TV gateways with recording capability, and digital camcorders. Personal computers can be connected to video capture devices and used as DVRs; in such cases the application software used to record video is an integral part of the DVR. Many DVRs are classified as consumer electronic devices. Similar small devices with built-in (~5 inch diagonal) displays and SSD support may be used for professional film or video production, as these recorders often do not have the limitations that built-in recorders in cameras have, offering wider codec support, the removal of recording time limitations and higher bitrates.

== History ==

===Hard-disk-based digital video recorders===

The first working DVR prototype was developed in 1998 at Stanford University Computer Science department. The DVR design was a chapter of Edward Y. Chang&#x27;s PhD dissertation, supervised by Professors Hector Garcia-Molina and Jennifer Widom. Two design papers were published at the 1998 VLDB conference,
and the 1999 ICDE conference. The prototype was developed in 1998 at Pat Hanrahan&#x27;s CS488 class: Experiments in Digital Television, and the prototype was demoed to industrial partners including Sony, Intel, and Apple.

Consumer digital video recorders ReplayTV and TiVo were launched at the 1999 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada. Microsoft also demonstrated a unit with DVR capability, but this did not become available until the end of 1999 for full DVR features in Dish Network&#x27;s DISHplayer receivers. TiVo shipped their first units on March 31, 1999. ReplayTV won the &quot;Best of Show&quot; award in the video category with Netscape co-founder Marc Andreessen as an early investor and board member, but TiVo was more successful commercially. &quot;Ad Age&quot; cited Forrester Research as saying that market penetration by the end of 1999 was &quot;less than 100,000&quot;.

Legal action by media companies forced ReplayTV to remove many features such as automatic commercial skip and the sharing of recordings over the Internet, but newer devices have steadily regained these functions while adding complementary abilities, such as recording onto DVDs and programming and remote control facilities using PDAs, networked PCs, and Web browsers.

In contrast to VCRs, hard-disk based digital video recorders make &quot;time shifting&quot; more convenient and also allow for functions such as pausing live TV, instant replay, chasing playback (viewing a recording before it has been completed) and skipping over advertising during playback.

Many DVRs use the MPEG format for compressing the digital video. Video recording capabilities have become an essential part of the modern set-top box, as TV viewers have wanted to take control of their viewing experiences. As consumers have been able to converge increasing amounts of video content on their set-tops, delivered by traditional &#x27;broadcast&#x27; cable, satellite and terrestrial as well as IP networks, the ability to capture programming and view it whenever they want has become a must-have function for many consumers.

====Digital video recorders tied to a video service====
At the 1999 CES, Dish Network demonstrated the hardware that would later have DVR capability with the assistance of Microsoft software, which also included access to the WebTV service. By the end of 1999 the Dishplayer had full DVR capabilities and within a year, over 200,000 units were sold.

In the UK, digital video recorders are often referred to as &quot;plus boxes&quot; (such as BSKYB&#x27;s Sky+ and Virgin Media&#x27;s V+ which integrates an HD capability, and the subscription free Freesat+ and Freeview+). Freeview+ have been around in the UK since the late 2000s, although the platform&#x27;s first DVR, the Pace Twin, dates to 2002. British Sky Broadcasting marketed a popular combined receiver and DVR as Sky+, now replaced by the Sky Q box. TiVo launched a UK model in 2000, and is no longer supported, except for third party services, and the continuation of TiVo through Virgin Media in 2010. South African based Africa Satellite TV beamer Multichoice recently launched their DVR which is available on their DStv platform. In addition to ReplayTV and TiVo, there are a number of other suppliers of digital terrestrial (DTT) DVRs, including Technicolor SA, Topfield, Fusion, Commscope, Humax, VBox Communications, AC Ryan Playon and Advanced Digital Broadcast (ADB).

Many satellite, cable and IPTV companies are incorporating digital video recording functions into their set-top box, such as with DirecTiVo, DISHPlayer/DishDVR, Scientific Atlanta Explorer 8xxx from Time Warner, Total Home DVR from AT&amp;T U-verse, Motorola DCT6412 from Comcast and others, Moxi Media Center by Digeo (available through Charter, Adelphia, Sunflower, Bend Broadband, and soon Comcast and other cable companies), or Sky+. Astro introduced their DVR system, called Astro MAX, which was the first PVR in Malaysia but was phased out two years after its introduction.

In the case of digital television, there is no &quot;encoding&quot; necessary in the DVR since the signal is already a digitally encoded MPEG stream. The digital video recorder simply stores the digital stream directly to disk. Having the broadcaster involved with, and sometimes subsidizing, the design of the DVR can lead to features such as the ability to use interactive TV on recorded shows, pre-loading of programs, or directly recording encrypted digital streams. It can, however, also force the manufacturer to implement non-skippable advertisements and automatically expiring recordings.

In the United States, the FCC has ruled that starting on July 1, 2007, consumers will be able to purchase a set-top box from a third-party company, rather than being forced to purchase or rent the set-top box from their cable company. This ruling only applies to &quot;navigation devices&quot;, otherwise known as a cable television set-top box, and not to the security functions that control the user&#x27;s access to the content of the cable operator. The overall net effect on digital video recorders and related technology is unlikely to be substantial as standalone DVRs are currently readily available on the open market.

In Europe Free-To-Air and Pay TV TV gateways with multiple tuners have whole house recording capabilities allowing recording of TV programs to Network Attached Storage or attached USB storage, recorded programs are then shared across the home network to tablet, smartphone, PC, Mac, Smart TV.

=== Introduction of dual tuners ===
In 2003 many Satellite and Cable providers introduced dual-tuner digital video recorders. In the UK, BSkyB introduced their first PVR Sky+ with dual tuner support in 2001. These machines have two independent tuners within the same receiver. The main use for this feature is the capability to record a live program while watching another live program simultaneously or to record two programs at the same time, possibly while watching a previously recorded one. Kogan.com introduced a dual-tuner PVR in the Australian market allowing free-to-air television to be recorded on a removable hard drive. Some dual-tuner DVRs also have the ability to output to two separate television sets at the same time. The PVR manufactured by UEC (Durban, South Africa) and used by Multichoice and Scientific Atlanta 8300DVB PVR have the ability to view two programs while recording a third using a triple tuner.

Where several digital subchannels are transmitted on a single RF channel, some PVRs can record two channels and view a third, so long as all three subchannels are on two channels (or one).

In the United States, DVRs were used by 32 percent of all TV households in 2009, and 38 percent by 2010, with viewership among 18- to 40-year-olds 40 percent higher in homes that have them.

==Types==

===Integrated television sets===

DVRs are integrated into some television sets (TVs). These systems simplify wiring and operation because they employ a single power cable, have no interconnected ports (e.g., HDMI), and share a common remote control.

===VESA compatibility===

VESA-compatible DVRs are designed to attach to the VESA mounting holes (100×100 mm) on the back of an LCD television set (TV), allowing users to combine the TV and DVR into an integrated unit.

===Set-top boxes (STB)===
&quot;Over-the-air&quot; DVRs are standalone receivers that record broadcast television programs. Several companies have launched over-the-air DVR products for the consumer market over the past few years.

Some pay-TV operators provide receivers that allow subscribers to attach their own network-attached storage (NAS) hard drives or solid-state or flash memory to record video and other media files (e.g., audio and photos).

===PC-based===
Software and hardware are available which can turn personal computers running Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X into DVRs, and is a popular option for home-theater PC (HTPC) enthusiasts.

====Linux====
There are many free and open source software DVR applications available for Linux. For example, TV gateway interfaces to DVB tuners and provides network tuner and TV server functions, which allows live viewing and recording over IP networks. Other examples include MythTV, Video Disk Recorder (VDR), LinuxMCE, TiVo, VBox Home TV Gateway, and Kodi (formerly XBMC).

====macOS====
Geniatech makes a series of digital video recording devices called EyeTV. The software supplied with each device is also called EyeTV, and is available separately for use on compatible third-party tuners from manufacturers such as Pinnacle, TerraTec, and Hauppauge.

SageTV provided DVR software for the Mac but no longer sells it. Previously sold devices support the Hauppauge HVR-950, myTV.PVR and HDHomeRun hardware with its DVR software. SageTV software also included the ability to watch YouTube and other online video with a remote control.

MythTV (see above) also runs under Mac OS X, but most recording devices are currently only supported under Linux. Precompiled binaries are available for the MythTV front-end, allowing a Mac to watch video from (and control) a MythTV server running under Linux.

Apple provides applications in the FireWire software developer kit which allow any Mac with a FireWire port to record the MPEG2 transport stream from a FireWire-equipped cable box (for example: Motorola DCT62xx, including HD streams). Applications can also change channels on the cable box via the firewire interface. Only broadcast channels can be recorded as the rest of the channels are encrypted. &quot;FireRecord (formerly iRecord)&quot; is a free scheduled-recording program derived from this SDK.

====Windows====
There are several free digital video recording applications available for Microsoft Windows including GB-PVR, MediaPortal, and Orb (web-based remote interface).

There are also several commercial applications available including CyberLink, SageTV (which is no longer available after Google acquired it in June 2011), Beyond TV (which is considered discontinued despite an official announcement from SnapStream since the last update was October 2010 and they are concentrating on their enterprise search products), DVBViewer, Showshifter, InterVideo WinDVR, the R5000-HD and Meedio (now a dead product – Yahoo! bought most of the company&#x27;s technology and discontinued the Meedio line, and rebranded the software Yahoo! Go – TV, which is now a free product but only works in the U.S.). Most TV tuner cards come bundled with software which allows the PC to record television to hard disk. See TV tuner card. For example, Leadtek&#x27;s WinFast DTV1000 digital TV card comes bundled with the WinFast PVR2 software, which can also record analog video from the card&#x27;s composite video input socket.

Windows Media Center is a DVR software by Microsoft which was bundled with the Media Center edition of Windows XP, the Home Premium / Ultimate editions of Windows Vista, as well as most editions of Windows 7. When Windows 8 was released in 2012, Windows Media Center was not included with Windows 8 OEM or Retail installations, and was only available as a $15 add-on pack (including DVD Playback codecs) to Windows 8 Pro users.

The Windows Game Bar specifies all recordings made by it as being titled &quot;Microsoft Game DVR&quot; followed by the game or application&#x27;s title.

===Embeddable===

An &quot;embeddable&quot; DVR is a standalone device that is designed to be easily integrated into more complex systems. It is typically supplied as a compact, bare circuit board that facilitates mounting it as a subsystem component within larger equipment. The control keypad is usually connected with a detachable cable, to allow it to be located on the system&#x27;s exterior while the DVR circuitry resides inside the equipment.

==Source video==
Television and video are terms that are sometimes used interchangeably, but differ in their technical meaning. Video is the visual portion of television, whereas television is the combination of video and audio modulated onto a carrier frequency (i.e., a television channel) for delivery. Most DVRs can record both video and audio.

===Analog sources===
The first digital video recorders were designed to record analog television in NTSC, PAL or SECAM formats.

To record an analog signal a few steps are required. In the case of a television signal, a television tuner must first demodulate the radio frequency signal to produce baseband video. The video is then converted to digital form by a frame grabber, which converts each video image into a collection of numeric values that represent the pixels within the image. At the same time, the audio is also converted to digital form by an analog-to-digital converter running at a constant sampling rate. In many devices, the resulting digital video and audio are compressed before recording to reduce the amount of data that will be recorded, although some DVRs record uncompressed data. When compression is used, video is typically compressed using formats such as H.264 or MPEG-2, and audio is compressed using AAC or MP3.

====Analog broadcast copy protection====
Many consumer DVRs implement a copy-protection system called &quot;Copy Generation Management System—Analog&quot; (CGMS-A), which specifies one of four possible copy permissions by means of two bits encoded in the vertical blanking interval:
* Copying is freely allowed
* Copying is prohibited
* Only one copy of this material may be made
* This is a copy of material for which only one copy was allowed to be made, so no further copies are allowed.

CGMS-A information may be present in analog broadcast TV signals, and is preserved when the signal is recorded and played back by analog VCRs. VCRs do not understand the meanings of the bits but preserve them in case there is a subsequent attempt to copy the tape to a DVR.

DVRs such as TiVo also detect and act upon analog protection systems such as Macrovision and DCS Copy Protection which were originally designed to block copying on analog VCRs.

===Digital sources===
Recording digital signals is generally a straightforward capture of the binary MPEG data being received. No expensive hardware is required to quantize and compress the signal (as the television broadcaster has already done this in the studio).

DVD-based PVRs available on the market as of 2006 are not capable of capturing the full range of the visual signal available with high-definition television (HDTV). This is largely because HDTV standards were finalized at a later time than the standards for DVDs. However, DVD-based PVRs can still be used (albeit at reduced visual quality) with HDTV since currently available HDTV sets also have standard A/V connections.

====ATSC broadcast====
ATSC television broadcasting is primarily used in North America. The ATSC data stream can be directly recorded by a digital video recorder, though many DVRs record only a subset of this information (that can later be transferred to DVD). An ATSC DVR will also act as a set-top box, allowing older televisions or monitors to receive digital television.

=====Copy protection=====
The U.S. FCC attempted to limit the abilities of DVRs with its &quot;broadcast flag&quot; regulation. Digital video recorders that had not won prior approval from the FCC for implementing &quot;effective&quot; digital rights management would have been banned from interstate commerce from July 2005, but the regulation was struck down on May 6, 2005.

====DVB====
DVB digital television contains audio/visual signals that are broadcast over the air in a digital rather than analog format. The DVB data stream can be directly recorded by the DVR. Devices that can use external storage devices (such as hard disks, SSDs, or other flash storage) to store and recover data without the aid of another device are sometimes called telememory devices.

====Digital cable and satellite television====
Recording satellite television or digital cable signals on a digital video recorder can be more complex than recording analog signals or broadcast digital signals. There are several different transmission schemes, and the video streams may be encrypted to restrict access to subscribers only.

A satellite or cable set-top box both decrypts the signal if encrypted, and decodes the MPEG stream into an analog signal for viewing on the television. In order to record cable or satellite digital signals the signal must be captured after it has been decrypted but before it is decoded; this is how DVRs built into set-top boxes work.

Cable and satellite providers often offer their own digital video recorders along with a service plan. These DVRs have access to the encrypted video stream, and generally enforce the provider&#x27;s restrictions on copying of material even after recording.

====DVD====
Many DVD-based DVRs have the capability to copy content from a source DVD (ripping). In the United States, this is prohibited under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act if the disc is encrypted. Most such DVRs will therefore not allow recording of video streams from encrypted movie discs.

====Digital camcorders====
A digital camcorder combines a camera and a digital video recorder.

Some DVD-based DVRs incorporate connectors that can be used to capture digital video from a camcorder. Some editing of the resulting DVD is usually possible, such as adding chapter points.

Some digital video recorders can now record to solid state flash memory cards (called &quot;flash camcorders&quot;). They generally use Secure Digital cards, can include wireless connections (Bluetooth and Wi-Fi), and can play SWF files. There are some digital video recorders that combine video and graphics in real time to the flash card, called DTE or &quot;direct to edit&quot;. These are used to speed-up the editing workflow in video and television production, since linear videotapes do not then need to be transferred to the edit workstation (see Non-linear editing system).

== File formats, resolutions and file systems ==
DVRs can usually record and play H.264, MPEG-4 Part 2, MPEG-2 .mpg, MPEG-2 .TS, VOB and ISO images video, with MP3 and AC3 audio tracks. They can also display images (JPEG and PNG) and play music files (MP3 and Ogg).

Some devices can be updated to play and record in new formats. DVRs usually record in proprietary file systems for copy protection, although some can use FAT file systems. Recordings from standard-definition television usually have 480p/i/576p/i while HDTV is usually in 720p/1080i.

== Applications ==

=== Security ===

Digital video recorders configured for physical security applications record video signals from closed-circuit television cameras for detection and documentation purposes. Many are designed to record audio as well. DVRs have evolved into devices that are feature rich and provide services that exceed the simple recording of video images that was previously done through VCRs. A DVR CCTV system provides a multitude of advanced functions over VCR technology including video searches by event, time, date and camera. There is also much more control over quality and frame rate allowing disk space usage to be optimized and the DVR can also be set to overwrite the oldest security footage should the disk become full. In some DVR security systems remote access to security footage using a PC can also be achieved by connecting the DVR to a LAN network or the Internet.
Some of the latest professional digital video recorders include video analytics firmware, to enable functionality such as &#x27;virtual tripwire&#x27; or even the detection of abandoned objects on the scene.

Security DVRs may be categorized as being either PC-based or embedded. A PC-based DVR&#x27;s architecture is a classical personal computer with video capture cards designed to capture video images. An embedded type DVR is specifically designed as a digital video recorder with its operating system and application software contained in firmware or read-only memory.

==== Hardware features ====
Hardware features of security DVRs vary between manufacturers and may include but are not necessarily limited to:
* Designed for rack mounting or desktop configurations.
* Single or multiple video inputs with connector types consistent with the analogue or digital video provided such as coaxial cable, twisted pair or optical fiber cable. The most common number of inputs are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32. Systems may be configured with a very large number of inputs by networking or bussing individual DVRs together.
* Looping video outputs for each input which duplicates the corresponding input video signal and connector type. These output signals are used by other video equipment such as matrix switchers, multiplexers, and video monitors.
* Controlled outputs to external video display monitors.
* Front panel switches and indicators that allow the various features of the machine to be controlled.
* Network connections consistent with the network type and utilized to control features of the recorder and to send and/or receive video signals.
* Connections to external control devices such as keyboards.
* A connection to external pan-tilt-zoom drives that position cameras.
* Internal CD, DVD, VCR devices typically for archiving video.
* Connections to external storage media.
* Alarm event inputs from external security detection devices, usually one per video input.
* Alarm event outputs from internal detection features such as motion detection or loss of video.

==== Software features ====
Software features vary between manufacturers and may include but are not necessarily limited to:
* User-selectable image capture rates either on an all input basis or input by input basis. The capture rate feature may be programmed to automatically adjust the capture rate on the occurrence of an external alarm or an internal event
* Selectable image resolution either on an all input basis or input by input basis. The image resolution feature may be programmed to automatically adjust the image resolution on the occurrence of an external alarm or an internal event.
* Compression methods determine quality of playback. H.264 hardware compression offers fast transfer rates over the Internet with high quality video.
* Motion detection: Provided on an input by input basis, this feature detects motion in the total image or a user definable portion of the image and usually provides sensitivity settings. Detection causes an internal event that may be output to external equipment and/or be used to trigger changes in other internal features.
* Lack of motion detection. Provided on an input by input basis, this feature detects the movement of an object into the field of view and remaining still for a user definable time. Detection causes an internal event that may be output to external equipment and/or used to trigger changes in other internal features.
* Direction of motion detection. Provided on an input by input basis, this feature detects the direction of motion in the image that has been determined by the user as an unacceptable occurrence. Detection causes an internal event that may be output to external equipment and/or be used to trigger changes in other internal features.
* Routing of input video to video monitors based on user inputs or automatically on alarms or events.
* Input, time and date stamping.
* Alarm and event logging on appropriate video inputs.
* Alarm and event search.
* One or more sound recording channels.
* Archival.

==Privacy concerns==
Some (very few), but certainly not all, digital video recorders which are designed to send information to a service provider over a telephone line or Internet (or any other way) can gather and send real-time data on users&#x27; viewing habits. This problem was noted back in 2000 and was still considered a problem, specifically with TiVo, in 2015.

==Television advertisements==

Digital video recorders are also changing the way television programs advertise products. Watching pre-recorded programs allows users to fast-forward through commercials, and some technology allows users to remove commercials entirely. Half of viewers in the United States, for example, use DVRs to skip commercials entirely. This feature has been controversial for the last decade, with major television networks and movie studios claiming it violates copyright and should be banned.

In 1985, an employee of Honeywell&#x27;s Physical Sciences Center, David Rafner, first described a drive-based DVR designed for home TV recording, time shifting, and commercial skipping. U.S. Patent 4,972,396 focused on a multi-channel design to allow simultaneous independent recording and playback. Broadly anticipating future DVR developments, it describes possible applications such as streaming compression, editing, captioning, multi-channel security monitoring, military sensor platforms, and remotely piloted vehicles.

In 1999, the first DVR which had a built-in commercial skipping feature was introduced by ReplayTV at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. In 2002, five owners of the ReplayTV DVR sued the main television networks and movie studios, asking the federal judge to uphold consumers&#x27; rights to record TV shows and skip commercials, claiming that features such as commercial skipping help parents protect their kids from excessive consumerism. ReplayTV was purchased by SONICblue in 2001 and in March 2003, SONICblue filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after fighting a copyright infringement suit over the ReplayTV&#x27;s ability to skip commercials. In 2007, DirecTV purchased the remaining assets of ReplayTV.
A third-party add-on for Windows Media Center called &quot;DVRMSToolbox&quot; has the ability to skip commercials.
There is a command-line program called Comskip that detects commercials in an MPEG-2 file and saves their positions to a text file. This file can then be fed to a program like MEncoder to actually remove the commercials.

Many speculate that television advertisements will be eliminated altogether, replaced by advertising in the TV shows themselves. For example, &quot;Extreme Makeover: Home Edition&quot; advertises Sears, Kenmore, Kohler, and Home Depot by specifically using products from these companies, and some sports events like the Sprint Cup of NASCAR are named after sponsors.

Another type of advertisement shown more and more, mostly for advertising television shows on the same channel, is where the ad overlays the bottom of the television screen, blocking out some of the picture. &quot;Banners&quot;, or &quot;logo bugs&quot;, as they are called, are referred to by media companies as Secondary Events (2E). This is done in much the same way as severe weather warnings are done. Sometimes, these take up only 5–10% of the screen, but in the extreme, can take up as much as 25% of the viewing area. Some even make noise or move across the screen. One example of this is the 2E ads for &quot;Three Moons Over Milford&quot; in the months before its premiere. A video taking up approximately 25% of the bottom-left portion of the screen would show a comet impacting into the moon with an accompanying explosion, during another television program.

Because of this widely used new technology, advertisers are now looking at a new way to market their products on television. An excerpt from the magazine &quot;Advertising Age&quot; reads: &quot;As advertisers lose the ability to invade the home, and consumer&#x27;s minds, they will be forced to wait for an invitation. This means that they have to learn what kinds of advertising content customers will actually be willing to seek out and receive.&quot;

With ad skipping and the time-sensitive nature of certain ads, advertisers are wary of buying commercial time on shows that are heavily digitally video-recorded. However, technology today makes it possible for networks to insert ads dynamically on videos being played in DVRs. Advertisers could inject time-relevant ads to recorded programs when the program is viewed. This way the ads could be not just topical but also personalized to viewers interests. DirecTV in March 2011 signed an arrangement with NDS Group to enable the delivery of such addressable advertisement.
It is believed that viewers prefer to forward ads, than to switch the channel. By switching channels, viewers will have the probability of skipping the beginning of their program. Users might switch to a channel that is also showing ads. Having the ability to pause, rewind, and forward live TV gives users a chance to change the channel fewer times. Forwarding ads can have a later effect on the viewer. Ads that get the viewers&#x27; attention will influence the viewers&#x27; to rewind and watch what was missed.

In January 2012, Dish Network announced Hopper service, costing $10 extra per month, which recorded prime-time programming from the four major broadcast networks. With the Auto Hop feature, viewers can watch the programs they choose without commercials, without making the effort to fast-forward. On May 24, 2012, Dish and the networks filed suit in federal court.

== Patent and copyright litigation ==

On July 14, 2005, Forgent Networks filed suit against various companies alleging infringement on , entitled &quot;Computer controlled video system allowing playback during recording&quot;. The listed companies included EchoStar, DirecTV, Charter Communications, Cox Communications, Comcast, Time Warner, and Cable One.

Scientific-Atlanta and Motorola, the manufacturers of the equipment sold by the above-mentioned companies, filed a counter-suit against Forgent Networks claiming that their products do not violate the patent, and that the patent is invalid. The two cases were combined into case 6:06-cv-208, filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Tyler Division.

According to court documents, on June 20, 2006, Motorola requested that the United States Patent and Trademarks Office reexamine the patent, which was first filed in 1991, but has been amended several times.

On March 23, 2007, Cablevision Systems Corp lost a legal battle against several Hollywood studios and television networks to introduce a network-based digital video recorder service to its subscribers. However, on August 4, 2008, Cablevision won its appeal. John M. Walker Jr., a Second Circuit judge, declared that the technology &quot;would not directly infringe&quot; on the media companies&#x27; rights. An appeal to the Supreme Court was rejected.

In court, the media companies argued that network digital video recorders were tantamount to video-on-demand, and that they should receive license fees for the recording. Cablevision and the appeals court disagreed. The company noted that each user would record programs on his or her own individual server space, making it a DVR that has a &quot;very long cord&quot;.

In 2004, TiVo sued EchoStar Corp, a manufacturer of DVR units, for patent infringement. The parties reached a settlement in 2011 wherein EchoStar pays a one-time fee (in three structured payments) that grants Echostar full rights for life to the disputed TiVo patents upon first payment(as opposed to indefinite and escalating license fees to be constantly renegotiated), and Echostar granted TiVo full rights for life to certain Echostar patents and dropped their counter-suit against TiVo.

In January 2012, AT&amp;T settled a similar suit brought by TiVo claiming patent infringement (just as with Echostar) in exchange for cash payments to TiVo totaling $215 million through June 2018 plus &quot;incremental recurring per subscriber monthly license fees&quot; to TiVo through July 2018, but grants no full lifetime rights as per the Echostar settlement.

In May 2012, Fox Broadcasting sued Dish Network, arguing that Dish&#x27;s set-top box with DVR function, which allowed the users to automatically record prime-time programs and skip commercials, was copyright infringement and breach of contract. In July 2013, the 9th circuit rejected Fox&#x27;s claims.

<doc id="348302" wikidata="Q1521268" url="?curid=348302" title="Van der Pauw method">
<text>The van der Pauw Method is a technique commonly used to measure the resistivity and the Hall coefficient of a sample. Its strength lies in its ability to accurately measure the properties of a sample of any arbitrary shape, as long as the sample is approximately two-dimensional (i.e. it is much thinner than it is wide), solid (no holes), and the electrodes are placed on its perimeter. The van der Pauw method employs a four-point probe placed around the perimeter of the sample, in contrast to the linear four point probe: this allows the van der Pauw method to provide an average resistivity of the sample, whereas a linear array provides the resistivity in the sensing direction. This difference becomes important for anisotropic materials, which can be properly measured using the Montgomery Method, an extension of the van der Pauw Method (see, for instance, reference).

From the measurements made, the following properties of the material can be calculated:
* The resistivity of the material
* The doping type (i.e. whether it is a P-type or N-type material)
* The sheet carrier density of the majority carrier (the number of majority carriers per unit area). From this the charge density and doping level can be found
* The mobility of the majority carrier
The method was first propounded by Leo J. van der Pauw in 1958.

== Conditions ==
There are five conditions that must be satisfied to use this technique:1. The sample must have a flat shape of uniform thickness2. The sample must not have any isolated holes3. The sample must be homogeneous and isotropic4. All four contacts must be located at the edges of the sample5. The area of contact of any individual contact should be at least an order of magnitude smaller than the area of the entire sample.

The second condition can be weakened. The van der Pauw technique can also be applied to samples with one hole. 
== Sample preparation ==
In order to use the van der Pauw method, the sample thickness must be much less than the width and length of the sample. In order to reduce errors in the calculations, it is preferable that the sample be symmetrical. There must also be no isolated holes within the sample.

The measurements require that four ohmic contacts be placed on the sample. Certain conditions for their placement need to be met:
* They must be as small as possible; any errors given by their non-zero size will be of the order &quot;D/L&quot;, where &quot;D&quot; is the average diameter of the contact and &quot;L&quot; is the distance between the contacts.
* They must be as close as possible to the boundary of the sample.

In addition to this, any leads from the contacts should be constructed from the same batch of wire to minimise thermoelectric effects. For the same reason, all four contacts should be of the same material.

== Measurement definitions ==
* The contacts are numbered from 1 to 4 in a counter-clockwise order, beginning at the top-left contact.
* The current &quot;I&quot;12 is a positive DC current injected into contact &quot;1&quot; and taken out of contact &quot;2&quot;, and is measured in amperes (A).
* The voltage &quot;V&quot;34 is a DC voltage measured between contacts &quot;3&quot; and &quot;4&quot; (&quot;i.e.&quot; &quot;V&quot;4 - &quot;V&quot;3) with no externally applied magnetic field, measured in volts (V).
* The resistivity &quot;ρ&quot; is measured in ohms⋅metres (Ω⋅m).
* The thickness of the sample &quot;t&quot; is measured in metres (m).
* The sheet resistance &quot;RS&quot; is measured in ohms per square (Ω/sq or formula_1).

== Resistivity measurements ==
The average resistivity of a sample is given by &quot;ρ = RS⋅t&quot;, where the sheet resistance &quot;RS&quot; is determined as follows. For an anisotropic material, the individual resistivity components, e.g. &quot;ρx&quot; or &quot;ρy&quot;, can be calculated using the Montgomery method.

=== Basic measurements ===
To make a measurement, a current is caused to flow along one edge of the sample (for instance, &quot;I12&quot;) and the voltage across the opposite edge (in this case, &quot;V&quot;34) is measured. From these two values, a resistance (for this example, formula_2) can be found using Ohm&#x27;s law:

:formula_3

In his paper, van der Pauw showed that the sheet resistance of samples with arbitrary shapes can be determined from two of these resistances - one measured along a vertical edge, such as formula_2, and a corresponding one measured along a horizontal edge, such as formula_5. The actual sheet resistance is related to these resistances by the van der Pauw formula

:formula_6

=== Reciprocal measurements ===
The reciprocity theorem tells us that formula_7

Therefore, it is possible to obtain a more precise value for the resistances formula_2 and formula_5 by making two additional measurements of their reciprocal values formula_10 and formula_11 and averaging the results.

We define formula_12 and formula_13

Then, the van der Pauw formula becomes formula_14

=== Reversed polarity measurements ===
A further improvement in the accuracy of the resistance values can be obtained by repeating the resistance measurements after switching polarities of both the current source and the voltage meter. Since this is still measuring the same portion of the sample, just in the opposite direction, the values of &quot;Rvertical&quot; and &quot;Rhorizontal&quot; can still be calculated as the averages of the standard and reversed polarity measurements. The benefit of doing this is that any offset voltages, such as thermoelectric potentials due to the Seebeck effect, will be cancelled out.

Combining these methods with the reciprocal measurements from above leads to the formulas for the resistances being

:formula_15

and

:formula_16

The van der Pauw formula takes the same form as in the previous section.

=== Measurement accuracy ===

Both of the above procedures check the repeatability of the measurements. If any of the reversed polarity measurements don&#x27;t agree to a sufficient degree of accuracy (usually within 3%) with the corresponding standard polarity measurement, then there is probably a source of error somewhere in the setup, which should be investigated before continuing. The same principle applies to the reciprocal measurements – they should agree to a sufficient degree before they are used in any calculations.

=== Calculating sheet resistance ===

In general, the van der Pauw formula cannot be rearranged to give the sheet resistance &quot;RS&quot; in terms of known functions. The most notable exception to this is when &quot;Rvertical = R = Rhorizontal&quot;; in this scenario the sheet resistance is given by

:formula_17

The quotient formula_18 is known as the van der Pauw constant and has approximate value 4.53236. In most other scenarios, an iterative method is used to solve the van der Pauw formula numerically for RS. Typically a formula is considered to fail the preconditions for Banach Fixed Point Theorem, so methods based on it do not work. Instead, nested intervals converge slowly but steadily. Recently, however, it has been shown that an appropriate reformulation of the van der Pauw problem (e.g., by introducing a second van der Pauw formula) makes it fully solvable by the Banach fixed point method. 

Alternatively, a Newton-Raphson method converges relatively quickly. To reduce the complexity of the notation, the following variables are introduced:

:formula_19
:formula_20
:formula_21

Then the next approximation formula_22 is calculated by
:formula_23

== Hall measurements ==

=== Background ===
When a charged particle—such as an electron—is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a Lorentz force proportional to the strength of the field and the velocity at which it is traveling through it. This force is strongest when the direction of motion is perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field; in this case the force
:formula_24
where formula_25 is the charge on the particle in coulombs, formula_26 the velocity it is traveling at (centimeters per second), and formula_27 the strength of the magnetic field (Wb/cm2). Note that centimeters are often used to measure length in the semiconductor industry, which is why they are used here instead of the SI units of meters.

When a current is applied to a piece of semiconducting material, this results in a steady flow of electrons through the material (as shown in parts (a) and (b) of the accompanying figure). The velocity the electrons are traveling at is (see electric current):
:formula_28
where formula_29 is the electron density, formula_30 is the cross-sectional area of the material and formula_25 the elementary charge (1.602×10−19 coulombs).

If an external magnetic field is then applied perpendicular to the direction of current flow, then the resulting Lorentz force will cause the electrons to accumulate at one edge of the sample (see part (c) of the figure). Combining the above two equations, and noting that formula_25 is the charge on an electron, results in a formula for the Lorentz force experienced by the electrons:
:formula_33

This accumulation will create an electric field across the material due to the uneven distribution of charge, as shown in part (d) of the figure. This in turn leads to a potential difference across the material, known as the Hall voltage formula_34. The current, however, continues to only flow along the material, which indicates that the force on the electrons due to the electric field balances the Lorentz force. Since the force on an electron from an electric field formula_35 is formula_36, we can say that the strength of the electric field is therefore
:formula_37

Finally, the magnitude of the Hall voltage is simply the strength of the electric field multiplied by the width of the material; that is,
:formula_38
where formula_39 is the thickness of the material. Since the sheet density formula_40 is defined as the density of electrons multiplied by the thickness of the material, we can define the Hall voltage in terms of the sheet density:
:formula_41

=== Making the measurements ===

Two sets of measurements need to be made: one with a magnetic field in the positive &quot;z&quot;-direction as shown above, and one with it in the negative &quot;z&quot;-direction. From here on in, the voltages recorded with a positive field will have a subscript P (for example, &quot;V13, P&quot; = &quot;V3, P&quot; - &quot;V1, P&quot;) and those recorded with a negative field will have a subscript N (such as &quot;V13, N&quot; = &quot;V3, N&quot; - &quot;V1, N&quot;). For all of the measurements, the magnitude of the injected current should be kept the same; the magnitude of the magnetic field needs to be the same in both directions also.

First of all with a positive magnetic field, the current &quot;I24&quot; is applied to the sample and the voltage &quot;V13, P&quot; is recorded; note that the voltages can be positive or negative. This is then repeated for &quot;I13&quot; and &quot;V42, P&quot;.

As before, we can take advantage of the reciprocity theorem to provide a check on the accuracy of these measurements. If we reverse the direction of the currents (i.e. apply the current &quot;I42&quot; and measure &quot;V31, P&quot;, and repeat for &quot;I31&quot; and &quot;V24, P&quot;), then &quot;V13, P&quot; should be the same as &quot;V31, P&quot; to within a suitably small degree of error. Similarly, &quot;V42, P&quot; and &quot;V24, P&quot; should agree.

Having completed the measurements, a negative magnetic field is applied in place of the positive one, and the above procedure is repeated to obtain the voltage measurements &quot;V13, N&quot;, &quot;V42, N&quot;, &quot;V31, N&quot; and &quot;V24, N&quot;.

=== Calculations ===

Initially, the difference of the voltages for positive and negative magnetic fields is calculated:

&quot;V&quot;13 = &quot;V&quot;13, P − &quot;V&quot;13, N
&quot;V&quot;24 = &quot;V&quot;24, P − &quot;V&quot;24, N
&quot;V&quot;31 = &quot;V&quot;31, P − &quot;V&quot;31, N
&quot;V&quot;42 = &quot;V&quot;42, P − &quot;V&quot;42, N

The overall Hall voltage is then
:formula_42.

The polarity of this Hall voltage indicates the type of material the sample is made of; if it is positive, the material is P-type, and if it is negative, the material is N-type.

The formula given in the background can then be rearranged to show that the sheet density
:formula_43

Note that the strength of the magnetic field &quot;B&quot; needs to be in units of Wb/cm2 if ns is in cm−2. For instance, if the strength is given in the commonly used units of teslas, it can be converted by multiplying it by 10−4.

== Other calculations ==

=== Mobility ===
The resistivity of a semiconductor material can be shown to be
:formula_44
where &quot;n&quot; and &quot;p&quot; are the concentration of electrons and holes in the material respectively, and &quot;μn&quot; and &quot;μp&quot; are the mobility of the electrons and holes respectively.

Generally, the material is sufficiently doped so that there is a difference of many orders-of-magnitude between the two concentrations, allowing this equation to be simplified to
:formula_45
where &quot;nm&quot; and &quot;μm&quot; are the doping level and mobility of the majority carrier respectively.

If we then note that the sheet resistance RS is the resistivity divided by the thickness of the sample, and that the sheet density nS is the doping level multiplied by the thickness, we can divide the equation through by the thickness to get
:formula_46

This can then be rearranged to give the majority carrier mobility in terms of the previously calculated sheet resistance and sheet density:
:formula_47

<doc id="348304" wikidata="Q1048818" url="?curid=348304" title="Desktop metaphor">
<text>In computing, the desktop metaphor is an interface metaphor which is a set of unifying concepts used by graphical user interfaces to help users interact more easily with the computer. The desktop metaphor treats the computer monitor as if it is the top of the user&#x27;s desk, upon which &quot;objects&quot; such as documents and folders of documents can be placed. A document can be opened into a window, which represents a paper copy of the document placed on the desktop. Small applications called desk accessories are also available, such as a desk calculator or notepad, etc.

The desktop metaphor itself has been extended and stretched with various implementations of desktop environments, since access to features and usability of the computer are usually more important than maintaining the &#x27;purity&#x27; of the metaphor. Hence one can find trash cans on the desktop, as well as disks and network volumes (which can be thought of as filing cabinets—not something normally found &quot;on&quot; a desktop). Other features such as menu bars or taskbars have no direct counterpart on a real-world desktop, though this may vary by environment and the function provided; for instance, a familiar wall calendar can sometimes be displayed or otherwise accessed via a taskbar or menu bar belonging to the desktop.

==History==

The desktop metaphor was first introduced by Alan Kay, David C. Smith, and others at Xerox PARC in 1970 and elaborated in a series of innovative software applications developed by PARC scientists throughout the ensuing decade. The first computer to use an early version of the desktop metaphor was the experimental Xerox Alto, and the first commercial computer that adopted this kind of interface was the Xerox Star. The use of window controls to contain related information predates the desktop metaphor, with a primitive version appearing in Douglas Engelbart&#x27;s &quot;Mother of All Demos&quot;,
though it was incorporated by PARC in the environment of the Smalltalk language.

One of the first desktop-like interfaces on the market was a program called Magic Desk I. Built as a cartridge for the Commodore 64 home computer in 1983, a very primitive GUI presented a low resolution sketch of a desktop, complete with telephone, drawers, calculator, etc. The user made their choices by moving a sprite depicting a hand pointing by using the same joystick the user may have used for video gaming. Onscreen options were chosen by pushing the fire button on the joystick. The Magic Desk I program featured a typewriter graphically emulated complete with audio effects. Other applications included a calculator, rolodex organiser, and a terminal emulator. Files could be archived into the drawers of the desktop. A trashcan was also present.

The first computer to popularise the desktop metaphor, using it as a standard feature over the earlier command-line interface was the Apple Macintosh in 1984. The desktop metaphor is ubiquitous in modern-day personal computing; it is found in most desktop environments of modern operating systems: Windows as well as macOS, Linux, and other Unix-like systems.

BeOS observed the desktop metaphor more strictly than many other systems. For example, external hard drives appeared on the &#x27;desktop&#x27;, while internal ones were accessed clicking on an icon representing the computer itself. By comparison, the Mac OS places all drives on the desktop itself by default, while in Windows the user can access the drives through an icon labelled &quot;Computer&quot;.

Amiga terminology for its desktop metaphor was taken directly from workshop jargon. The desktop was called Workbench, programs were called tools, small applications (applets) were utilities, directories were drawers, etc.
Icons of objects were animated and the directories are shown as drawers which were represented as either open or closed.
As in the classic Mac OS and macOS desktop, an icon for a floppy disk or CD-ROM would appear on the desktop when the disk was inserted into the drive, as it was a virtual counterpart of a physical floppy disk or CD-ROM on the surface of a workbench.

==Paper paradigm==
The &quot;paper paradigm&quot; refers to the paradigm used by most modern computers and operating systems. The paper paradigm consists of, usually, black text on a white background, files within folders, and a &quot;desktop&quot;. The paper paradigm was created by many individuals and organisations, such as Douglas Engelbart, Xerox PARC, and Apple Computer, and was an attempt to make computers more user-friendly by making them resemble the common workplace of the time (with papers, folders, and a desktop). It was first presented to the public by Engelbart in 1968, in what is now referred to as &quot;The Mother of All Demos&quot;.

From John Siracusa:

Back in 1984, explanations of the original Mac interface to users who had never seen a GUI before inevitably included an explanation of icons that went something like this: &quot;This icon represents your file on disk.&quot; But to the surprise of many, users very quickly discarded any semblance of indirection. This icon &quot;is&quot; my file. My file &quot;is&quot; this icon. One is not a &quot;representation of&quot; or an &quot;interface to&quot; the other. Such relationships were foreign to most people, and constituted unnecessary mental baggage when there was a much more simple and direct connection to what they knew of reality.

Since then, many aspects of computers have wandered away from the paper paradigm by implementing features such as &quot;shortcuts&quot; to files, hypertext, and non-spatial file browsing. A shortcut (a link to a file that acts as a redirecting proxy, not the actual file) and hypertext have no real-world equivalent. Non-spatial file browsing, as well, may confuse novice users, as they can often have more than one window representing the same folder open at the same time, something that is impossible in reality. These and other departures from real-world equivalents are violations of the pure paper paradigm.

<text>The term open market is used generally to refer to an economic situation close to free trade. In a more specific, technical sense, the term refers to interbank trade in securities.

==In economic theory==

Economists judge the &quot;openness&quot; of markets according to the amount of government regulation of those markets, the scope for competition, and the absence or presence of local cultural customs which get in the way of trade. In principle, a fully open market is a completely free market in which all economic actors can trade without any external constraint. In reality, few markets exist which are open to that extent, since they usually cannot operate without an enforceable legal framework for trade which guarantees security of property, the fulfillment of contractual obligations associated with transactions, and the prevention of cheating.

A physical open market is a space where anyone wishing to trade physical goods may do so free of selling charges and taxes, and has come to be regarded by many activists as the ultimate social enterprise and a major tool for tackling unemployment.

In a more general sense the term has started to be used in economics and political economy, in which an open market refers to a market which is accessible to all economic actors. In an open market so defined, all economic actors have an equal opportunity of entry in that market. This contrasts with a market closed by a monopoly which dominate an industry, and with a protected market in which entry is conditional on certain financial and legal requirements or which is subject to tariff barriers, taxes, levies or state subsidies which effectively prevent some economic actors from participating in them (see protectionism).

The concept of an open market in this general sense is sometimes criticized on the ground that participation in it is conditional on having sufficient money, income or assets. Lacking sufficient money, income or assets, people may be effectively excluded from participation. Thus, whereas people may have sufficient funds to participate in some markets, their funds are inadequate to participate in other markets. This raises the question of whether markets are ever truly &quot;open&quot;, and suggests that the &quot;openness&quot; of markets is more a relative concept. In response to this type of criticism, the concept of open market is often redefined to mean a situation of free competition, and the inability to participate is explained as a lack of competitiveness. On this view, if people were more competitive they would be able to participate, and thus their lack of funds is due to their unwillingness to compete for resources. On this view, lack of participation in an open market is either a subjective preference or a personal defect.

== In banking ==

In banking and financial economics, the open market is the term used to refer to the environment in which bonds are bought and sold between a central bank and its regulated banks. It is not a free market process.

* To intervene in the &quot;business cycle&quot;, a central bank may choose to go into the open market and buy or sell government bonds, which is known as open market operations to increase reserves. Open Market Operations are when the central bank buys bonds from other banks in exchange for cheques. These local banks then cash the cheques, which allow them to take money from the central bank. This action thus decreases any credit the local banks may owe to the central bank, and also increases their money supply. This thus increases reserves.
* Stated otherwise: To intervene in the &quot;business cycle&quot;, a central bank may choose to buy (or sell) government securities from (or to) the banks which it regulates, thereby increasing (or decreasing) the reserves (not deposits) of those banks; the regulated banks must comply with the buy &amp; sell orders of the central bank. This process is known as open market operations. For example, a central bank may command its regulated banks to sell government bonds or bills to the central bank, which pays with cheques or electronic transactions which are cashed by these banks, moving money from the central bank to the bank reserves (not deposits) of the regulated banks.

<doc id="348311" wikidata="Q267691" url="?curid=348311" title="Joan Didion">
<text>Joan Didion (; December 5, 1934 – December 23, 2021) was an American writer and journalist. She is considered one of the pioneers of New Journalism, along with Gay Talese, Truman Capote, Norman Mailer, Hunter S. Thompson, and Tom Wolfe.

Didion&#x27;s career began in the 1950s after she won an essay contest sponsored by &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine. She would go on to publish essays in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;, &quot;National Review&quot;, &quot;Life&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, and &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. Her writing during the 1960s through the late 1970s engaged audiences in the realities of the counterculture of the 1960s, the Hollywood lifestyle, and the history and culture of California. Didion&#x27;s political writing in the 1980s and 1990s concentrated on the subtext of political rhetoric and the United States&#x27;s foreign policy in Latin America. In 1991, she wrote the earliest mainstream media article to suggest that the Central Park Five had been wrongfully convicted. 

With her husband John Gregory Dunne, Didion wrote screenplays including &quot;The Panic in Needle Park&quot; (1971), &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; (1976), and &quot;Up Close &amp; Personal&quot; (1996). In 2005, she won the National Book Award for Nonfiction and was a finalist for both the National Book Critics Circle Award and the Pulitzer Prize for &quot;The Year of Magical Thinking&quot;, a memoir of the year following the sudden death of her husband. She later adapted the book into a play that premiered on Broadway in 2007. In 2013, she was awarded the National Humanities Medal by president Barack Obama. Didion was profiled in the 2017 Netflix documentary &quot;The Center Will Not Hold&quot;, directed by her nephew Griffin Dunne.

== Early life and education ==
Didion was born on December 5, 1934, in Sacramento, California, to Eduene (née Jerrett) and Frank Reese Didion. She had one brother, five years her junior, James Jerrett Didion, who became a real estate executive. Didion recalled writing things down as early as age five, although she said she never saw herself as a writer until after her work had been published. She identified as a &quot;shy, bookish child&quot;, an avid reader, who pushed herself to overcome social anxiety through acting and public speaking. During her adolescence, she would type out Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s works to learn how his sentence structures worked.

Didion&#x27;s early education was nontraditional. She attended kindergarten and first grade, but, because her father was a finance officer in the Army Air Corps and the family constantly relocated, she did not attend school regularly. In 1943 or early 1944, her family returned to Sacramento, and her father went to Detroit to negotiate defense contracts for World War II. Didion wrote in her 2003 memoir &quot;Where I Was From&quot; that moving so often made her feel as if she were a perpetual outsider.

Didion received a B.A. in English from University of California, Berkeley, in 1956. During her senior year, she won first place in the &quot;Prix de Paris&quot; essay contest, sponsored by &quot;Vogue&quot;, and was awarded a job as a research assistant at the magazine. The topic of her winning essay was the San Francisco architect William Wurster.

== Career ==

=== &quot;Vogue&quot; ===
During her seven years at &quot;Vogue&quot;, from 1956 to 1964, Didion worked her way up from promotional copywriter to associate feature editor. &quot;Mademoiselle&quot; published Didion&#x27;s article &quot;Berkeley’s Giant: The University of California&quot; in January 1960. While at &quot;Vogue&quot;, and homesick for California, she wrote her first novel, &quot;Run, River&quot; (1963), about a Sacramento family as it comes apart. Writer and friend John Gregory Dunne helped her edit the book. John—the younger brother of author, businessman, and television mystery show host Dominick Dunne—was writing for &quot;Time&quot; magazine at the time. He and Didion married in 1964.

The couple moved to Los Angeles in 1964, intending to stay only temporarily, but California remained their home for the next 20 years. In 1966, they adopted a daughter, whom they named Quintana Roo Dunne. The couple wrote many newsstand-magazine assignments. &quot;She and Dunne started doing that work with an eye to covering the bills, and then a little more,&quot; Nathan Heller reported in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. &quot;Their [&quot;Saturday Evening&quot;] &quot;Post&quot; rates allowed them to rent a tumbledown Hollywood mansion, buy a banana-colored Corvette Stingray, raise a child, and dine well.&quot;

In Los Angeles, they settled in Los Feliz from 1963 to 1971, and then, after living in Malibu for eight years, she and Dunne moved to Brentwood Park, a quiet, affluent residential neighborhood.

=== &quot;Slouching Towards Bethlehem&quot; ===
In 1968, Didion published her first nonfiction book, &quot;Slouching Towards Bethlehem&quot;, a collection of magazine pieces about her experiences in California. Cited as an example of New Journalism, it used novel-like writing to cover the non-fiction realities of hippie counterculture. She wrote from a personal perspective, adding her own feelings and memories to situations, inventing details and quotes to make the stories more vivid, and using metaphors to give the reader a better understanding of the disordered subjects of her essays: politicians, artists, or just people living an American life. &quot;The New York Times&quot; characterized the &quot;grace, sophistication, nuance, [and] irony&quot; of her writing.

=== 1970s ===
Didion&#x27;s novel &quot;Play It as It Lays&quot;, set in Hollywood, was published in 1970, and &quot;A Book of Common Prayer&quot; appeared in 1977. In 1979, she published &quot;The White Album&quot;, another collection of her magazine pieces from &quot;Life&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;. In &quot;The White Album&quot;&#x27;s title essay, Didion documented an episode she experienced in the summer of 1968. After undergoing psychiatric evaluation, she was diagnosed as having had an attack of vertigo and nausea.

After periods of partial blindness in 1972, she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, but remained in remission throughout her life. In her essay entitled &quot;In Bed&quot;, Didion explained that she experienced chronic migraines.

Dunne and Didion worked closely for most of their careers. Much of their writing is therefore intertwined. They co-wrote a number of screenplays, including a 1972 film adaptation of her novel &quot;Play It as It Lays&quot; that starred Anthony Perkins and Tuesday Weld and the screenplay for the 1976 film of &quot;A Star is Born&quot;. They also spent several years adapting the biography of journalist Jessica Savitch into the 1996 Robert Redford and Michelle Pfeiffer film, &quot;Up Close &amp; Personal&quot;.

=== 1980s and 1990s ===
Didion&#x27;s book-length essay &quot;Salvador&quot; (1983) was written after a two-week trip to El Salvador with her husband. The next year, she published the novel &quot;Democracy&quot;, the story of a long, but unrequited love affair between a wealthy heiress and an older man, a CIA officer, against the background of the Cold War and the Vietnam War. Her 1987 nonfiction book &quot;Miami&quot; looked at the different communities in that city. In 1988, the couple moved from California to New York City.

In a prescient &quot;New York Review of Books&quot; piece of 1991, a year after the various trials of the Central Park Five, Didion dissected serious flaws in the prosecution&#x27;s case, making her the earliest mainstream writer to view the guilty verdicts as miscarriages of justice. She suggested the defendants were found guilty because of a sociopolitical narrative with racial overtones that clouded the judgment of the court. 

In 1992, Didion published &quot;After Henry&quot;, a collection of twelve geographical essays and a personal memorial for Henry Robbins, who was Didion&#x27;s friend and editor until his death in 1979. She published &quot;The Last Thing He Wanted&quot;, a romantic thriller, in 1996.

=== &quot;The Year of Magical Thinking&quot; ===
In 2003, Didion&#x27;s daughter Quintana Roo Dunne developed pneumonia that progressed to septic shock and she was comatose in an intensive-care unit when Didion&#x27;s husband suddenly died of a heart attack on December 30. Didion delayed his funeral arrangements for approximately three months until Quintana was well enough to attend.

On October 4, 2004, Didion began writing &quot;The Year of Magical Thinking&quot;, a narrative of her response to the death of her husband and the severe illness of their daughter. She finished the manuscript 88 days later on New Year&#x27;s Eve. Written at the age of 70, this was her first nonfiction book that was not a collection of magazine assignments. She said that she found the subsequent book-tour process very therapeutic during her period of mourning. Documenting the grief she experienced after the sudden death of her husband, the book was called a &quot;masterpiece of two genres: memoir and investigative journalism&quot; and won several awards.

Visiting Los Angeles after her father&#x27;s funeral, Quintana fell at the airport, hit her head on the pavement and required brain surgery for hematoma. After progressing toward recovery in 2004, she died of acute pancreatitis on August 26, 2005, aged 39, during Didion&#x27;s New York promotion for &quot;The Year of Magical Thinking&quot;. Didion wrote about Quintana&#x27;s death in the 2011 book &quot;Blue Nights&quot;.

=== 2000s ===

Didion was living in an apartment on East 71st Street in Manhattan in 2005. Everyman&#x27;s Library published &quot;We Tell Ourselves Stories in Order to Live&quot;, a 2006 compendium of much of Didion&#x27;s writing, including the full content of her first seven published nonfiction books (&quot;Slouching Towards Bethlehem&quot;, &quot;The White Album&quot;, &quot;Salvador&quot;, &quot;Miami&quot;, &quot;After Henry&quot;, &quot;Political Fictions&quot;, and &quot;Where I Was From&quot;), with an introduction by her contemporary, the critic John Leonard.

Didion began working with English playwright and director David Hare on a one-woman stage adaptation of &quot;The Year of Magical Thinking&quot; in 2007. Produced by Scott Rudin, the Broadway play featured Vanessa Redgrave. Although Didion was hesitant to write for the theater, she eventually found the genre, which was new to her, exciting.

Didion wrote early drafts of the screenplay for an untitled HBO biopic directed by Robert Benton on Katharine Graham. Sources say it may trace the paper&#x27;s reporting on the Watergate scandal.

=== Later works ===
In 2011, Knopf published &quot;Blue Nights&quot;, a memoir about aging that also focused on Didion&#x27;s relationship with her late daughter. More generally, the book deals with the anxieties Didion experienced about adopting and raising a child, as well as the aging process.

In 2012 &quot;New York&quot; magazine announced &quot;Joan Didion and Todd Field are co-writing a screenplay.&quot; The project titled &quot;As it Happens&quot; was a political thriller that never came to fruition, as they couldn’t find a studio to properly back it. Ultimately Field was to become the only writer, other than Dunne, with whom Didion would ever collaborate. He paid tribute to her in a scene for his movie &quot;Tár&quot; wherein the title character returns to her childhood bedroom and peers at &quot;little boxes&quot; labeled precisely the way Didion describes Quintana&#x27;s in &quot;Blue Nights&quot;

A photograph of Didion shot by Juergen Teller was used as part of the 2015 spring-summer campaign of the luxury French fashion brand Céline, while previously the clothing company Gap had featured her in a 1989 campaign. Didion&#x27;s nephew Griffin Dunne directed a 2017 Netflix documentary about her, &quot;Joan Didion: The Center Will Not Hold&quot;. In it, Didion discusses her writing and personal life, including the deaths of her husband and daughter, adding context to her books &quot;The Year of Magical Thinking&quot; and &quot;Blue Nights&quot;.

In 2021, Didion published &quot;Let Me Tell You What I Mean&quot;, a collection of 12 essays she wrote between 1968 and 2000.

== Death ==
Didion died from complications of Parkinson&#x27;s disease at her home in Manhattan on December 23, 2021, at the age of 87.

== Writing style and themes ==
Didion viewed the structure of the sentence as essential to her work. In the &quot;New York Times&quot; article &quot;Why I Write&quot; (1976), she remarked, &quot;To shift the structure of a sentence alters the meaning of that sentence, as definitely and inflexibly as the position of a camera alters the meaning of the object photographed ... The arrangement of the words matters, and the arrangement you want can be found in the picture in your mind ... The picture tells you how to arrange the words and the arrangement of the words tells you, or tells me, what&#x27;s going on in the picture.&quot;

Didion was heavily influenced by Ernest Hemingway, whose writing taught her the importance of how sentences work in a text. Her other influences included George Eliot and Henry James, who wrote &quot;perfect, indirect, complicated sentences&quot;.

Didion was also an observer of journalists, believing the difference between the process of fiction and nonfiction is the element of discovery that takes place in nonfiction, which happens not during the writing, but during the research.

Rituals were a part of Didion&#x27;s creative process. At the end of the day, she would take a break from writing to remove herself from the &quot;pages&quot;, saying that without the distance, she could not make proper edits. She would end her day by cutting out and editing prose, not reviewing the work until the following day. She would sleep in the same room as her work, saying: &quot;That&#x27;s one reason I go home to Sacramento to finish things. Somehow the book doesn&#x27;t leave you when you&#x27;re right next to it.&quot;

In a notorious 1980 essay, &quot;Joan Didion: Only Disconnect,&quot; Barbara Grizzuti Harrison called Didion a &quot;neurasthenic Cher&quot; whose style was &quot;a bag of tricks&quot; and whose &quot;subject is always herself&quot;. In 2011, &quot;New York&quot; magazine reported that the Harrison criticism &quot;still gets her (Didion&#x27;s) hackles up, decades later&quot;.

Critic Hilton Als suggested that Didion is reread often &quot;because of the honesty of the voice.&quot;

== Personal life ==
For several years in her 20s (1957–1962), Didion was in a relationship with Noel E. Parmentel Jr., a political pundit and figure on the New York literary and cultural scene. Didion wished to have a baby during this period, but Parmentel felt he had already failed at marriage and ruled out a conventional domestic arrangement. According to Didion&#x27;s husband, John Gregory Dunne, he actually met her through Parmentel, and Didion and Dunne remained friends for six years before embarking on a romantic relationship. As he later recalled, when they shared a celebratory lunch after Dunne finished reading the galleys for her first novel, &quot;Run, River&quot;, &quot;while [h]er [significant] other was out of town, it happened.&quot; Parmentel had introduced Dunne to Joan as a potential husband. Didion and Dunne subsequently married in January 1964 and remained together until his death from a heart attack in 2003. Breaking a long-held silence on Didion, whose work he had championed and for which he found publishers, Parmentel was interviewed for a 1996 article in &quot;New York&quot; magazine. He had been angered in the 1970s by what he felt was a thinly veiled portrait of him in Didion&#x27;s novel &quot;A Book of Common Prayer&quot;.

In 1966, while living in Los Angeles, she and John adopted a daughter, whom they named Quintana Roo Dunne.

A Republican in her early years, Didion later drifted toward the Democratic Party, &quot;without ever quite endorsing [its] core beliefs.&quot;

As late as 2011, she smoked precisely five cigarettes per day.

<text>MultiFinder is an extension for the Apple Macintosh&#x27;s classic Mac OS, introduced on August 11, 1987 and included with System Software 5. It adds cooperative multitasking of several applications at once – a great improvement over the previous Macintosh systems, which can only run one application at a time. With the advent of System 7, MultiFinder became a standard integrated part of the operating system and remained so until the introduction of Mac OS X.

==History==
===Background===
The first Macintosh was released in 1984, and Apple&#x27;s developers made an early decision that the machine&#x27;s 128 KB of RAM was so limited that they must abandon the application multitasking functionality that Apple had developed for the Lisa. As the successive Macintosh hardware models were released with much more RAM being the key feature, new programming techniques were developed as workarounds to allow users to run concurrent applications. Desk Accessories became a staple through the lifespan of System 6; and the Switcher would give way to the MultiFinder, which then became directly integrated into System 7.

====Desk Accessories====
To allow some degree of freedom and to deliver the GUI&#x27;s promise of interface consistency, the original Macintosh includes Desk Accessories, such as a calculator, that can be run concurrently. However, their functionality is deliberately limited in favor of RAM conservation. In fact, they are device drivers which take advantage of the multitasking system designed for hardware peripheral support. As such, their running environment is severely restricted. They can only draw a single window, which by default is given a special round-bordered appearance. Although the system software does little to specifically support them, the popularity of Desk Accessories led many application developers to ensure good cooperative multitasking support even from the early days.

====Switcher====
Andy Hertzfeld, one of Apple&#x27;s original Macintosh software architects, wrote Switcher after seeing John Markoff use a terminate-and-stay-resident program on an IBM PC in October 1984. By the end of the year he had a working prototype, and he soon demonstrated it in public. Both Microsoft and Apple wanted to purchase the utility. Hertzfeld chose the latter because of his belief that Switcher should be bundled with the Macintosh system. Apple offered more money ( plus royalties) and the company planned to ship Switcher with the Macintosh 512K. The first official version of Switcher appeared in April 1985.

Switcher works by designating a number of fixed slots in memory into which applications could be loaded. The user can then switch between these applications by clicking a small button on the top of the menu bar. The current application horizontally slides out of view, and the next one slides in. Though awkward, this approach does fit well with the existing system&#x27;s memory management scheme, and applications need no special programming to work with Switcher. This early work on Switcher led to the development of MultiFinder by Apple system software engineers Erich Ringewald and Phil Goldman.

Microsoft saw Switcher as especially benefiting the company&#x27;s highly memory-optimized Macintosh applications so the utility was shipped with Excel. Microsoft stated that using multiple applications with Switcher was preferable to a single integrated software application like Lotus Symphony. By 1987, &quot;Compute!&#x27;s Apple Applications&quot; reported that &quot;many Macintosh owners are comfortable only when using more than one application at a time. Switcher and desk accessories are the two most common examples of that philosophy&quot;. &quot;PC Magazine&quot; said that Switcher used too much of the system&#x27;s precious little RAM and was not reliable enough.

====Multi-Mac====
Multi-Mac is another application switching utility designed specifically for the Macintosh 512K, though it is more known for its mysteriousness. Showing up sometime in late 1985, after the introduction of Switcher, and being credited as being made by &quot;Jwa van der Vuurst&quot; with a copyright by &quot;Aubrac Systems&quot;, it makes over 200 direct calls to undocumented addresses in the Macintosh ROMs. This led to the accusations that &quot;Jwa van der Vuurst&quot; was merely an alias and that the program was actually from someone that worked at Apple and had significant knowledge on the Macintosh&#x27;s inner workings. The app itself adds a second apple menu on the right side of the menu bar which displays all currently running application and allows switching between them. It also allows adjusting the applications&#x27; memory allocation size, disk cache and adds background multi-threaded copying similar to Speed Doubler&#x27;s and Mac OS 8&#x27;s improved copy function.

====Servant====
Servant was another attempt by Andy Hertzfeld at multitasking on the Macintosh, intended to solve Switcher&#x27;s shortcomings. Released in September 1986, it was effectively a Finder, Switcher and ResEdit combined into one tool for the Macintosh Plus. Its file manager is unusual due to its lack of a scrollbar, instead requiring to hold and drag the window background like a modern map app. One of its most interesting features is the first known implementation of wallpapers on the Macintosh, allowing users to replace the default grey background with MacPaint or ThunderScan images. In comparison to Switcher, Servant allows users to open apps as they see fit instead of requiring you to select which apps you want to run first, then launching them inside Switcher. Switcher also has a primitive ability to recover from application crashes as well as force quit stuck applications that are no longer responding. The result is a user experience more intuitive than Switcher. While Servant&#x27;s resource editing features are not as full featured as ResEdit, it does allow editing file icons.

===MultiFinder===

MultiFinder, known before its release as &quot;Juggler&quot;, was introduced on August 11, 1987. It is simply a way for windows from different applications to coexist by using a cooperative application layering model. Its initial release is able to handle only two concurrent applications, one of which runs in the background; and later releases allow many more concurrent applications. When an application is activated, all of its windows are brought forward as a single layer. This approach is necessary for backward compatibility with many of the windowing data structures that were already documented. MultiFinder also provides a way for applications to supply their memory requirements ahead of time, so that MultiFinder can allocate a chunk of RAM to each according to need. This scheme, while functional, has severe limitations which cause many problems for users. Virtual memory was only available to contemporary Macs with a PMMU chip (Mac II-class machines required) and an extension named Virtual from Connectix. Apple eventually provided virtual memory with the introduction of System 7.

Later in 1987, System 6 engineer Erich Ringewald&#x27;s desire to solve these architectural problems altogether would bring him to defiantly cofound and lead the Pink project as the intended future of a new MacOS, and then become chief software architect at Be Inc. to design BeOS in 1990.

With the release of System 7, the MultiFinder extension was integrated with the operating system, and it remained so in Mac OS 8 and Mac OS 9. However, the integration into the OS does nothing to fix MultiFinder&#x27;s inherent idiosyncrasies and disadvantages. These problems were not overcome in the mainstream Macintosh operating system until the MultiFinder model was abandoned with the move to a modern preemptive multitasking Unix-based OS in Mac OS X. Two utilities, CPU Doubler and Peek-A-Boo, did implement a form of priority based task scheduling in the classic Mac OS, though they were unable to solve its other issues, like the lack of protected memory.

==Reception==
Upon MultiFinder&#x27;s 1987 release, &quot;PC Magazine&quot; noted it for beating IBM&#x27;s competing OS/2 multitasking operating system to market, and said the System with MultiFinder &quot;isn&#x27;t a true multitasking operating system, though it&#x27;s much more than a context switcher&quot;. Jerry Pournelle of &quot;Byte&quot; in 1989 said that &quot;while MultiFinder doesn&#x27;t work very well yet, DESQView on a big 80386 machine certainly does&quot;. In 1990, &quot;InfoWorld&quot; tested the four mainstream desktop multitasking options: DESQView, OS/2 1.2, Windows 3.0, and System 6 with MultiFinder. MultiFinder was viewed overall positively for speed, ease of use, and value. Its presence halved the speed of file transfer and printing compared to the single-tasking System 6 without MultiFinder, but this was still comparable to Windows and DesqView and much faster than OS/2. These tradeoffs were seen as typical of contemporary add-on multitaskers compared to the natively architected but less friendly OS/2.

<doc id="348319" wikidata="Q1376113" url="?curid=348319" title="Atta (ant)">
<text>Atta is a genus of New World ants of the subfamily Myrmicinae. It contains at least 17 known species.

&quot;Atta&quot; leafcutter ants are relatively large, rusty red or brown in colour, and have a spiny body and long legs. The three main castes within a nest are the queen, worker, and soldier. Only the queens and males have wings (alate), and these ants are also known as reproductives or swarmers. Although most of the ants in the nest are female, only the queens produce eggs. Queens are usually over long.

==Overview==
Ants of the genus &quot;Atta&quot; are leafcutter ants that comprise one of the two genera of leafcutting ants within the tribe Attini, along with &quot;Acromyrmex&quot;. They have no sting, thus inject no venom, although they are known as strong biters.

&quot;Atta&quot; spp. exhibit a high degree of polymorphism, with four castes being present in established colonies: minims (or garden ants), minors, mediae, and majors (also called soldiers or dinergates). Their immature development undergoes four larval stages, regardless of the ultimate caste, wherein larvae are also associated with fungal hyphae.

The high degree of polymorphism in this genus is also suggestive of its high degree of advancement. Every caste has a specific function, and some remarkably advanced phenomena have been observed in &quot;Atta&quot; species. An example of such is the behaviour of the minim ants, which climb on the cut sections of leaf while they are carried back to the nest by the media workers to protect the latter from a particular species of phorid fly that parasitises the leaf-carrying caste. While hitchhiking, the minims also work to decontaminate the fragment before it arrives at the nest, and feed on the sap of the leaf. The minims behaving this way demonstrates the highly derived character of the species. 

Like &quot;Acromyrmex&quot;, &quot;Atta&quot; spp. subsist mostly on a particular species of fungus (Rozites gongliophora) that they cultivate on a medium of masticated leaf tissue. This is the sole food of the queen and other colony members that remain in the nest. The media workers also gain subsistence from plant sap they ingest while physically cutting out sections of leaf from a variety of plants. If Attas become trapped in a collapsed tunnel, they make a tapping sound, and their sisters will rescue them.

Before leaving their parent colonies, winged females carry a small section of fungus in their intrabuccal pocket, and with this, the subsequently wingless queens seed the fungus gardens of incipient colonies. The queen does not eat from the fungus initially; she gives it time to grow by fertilizing it with her fecal matter. She survives on her body fat reserves, eating 90% of the eggs she lays, and catabolizing her wing muscles. Swanson et al 2019 finds annual turnover of &quot;Atta&quot; nest sites to be between 1127%.
&quot;Atta&quot; spp. have evolved to change food plants constantly, preventing a colony from completely stripping off leaves and thereby killing trees, thus avoiding negative biological feedback on account of their sheer numbers. This does not diminish the huge quantities of foliage they harvest; &quot;Atta&quot; is estimated to be responsible for the decomposition of 20% of all leaves in South America. Consequently, the genus is considered a major agricultural pest species in areas where its range coincides with farming activity.

Workers of the genus have few cuticular bacteria.

==Evolution==
The leafcutter ants (&quot;Atta&quot; and &quot;Acromyrmex&quot;) are different from other ants by their underground fungi cultivation; the two genera split off from a common ancestor species about 10 million years ago (Mya). The &quot;Trachymyrmex&quot; group and &quot;Sericomyrmex&quot; are the closest relatives to the leafcutters; they split off about 17 Mya. Leafcutter ants are very specialized organisms in that they coevolved with another organism through symbiosis. This process took millions of years to occur, about 50 Mya, which is when these ants began their relationship with fungi. The fungus eventually lost the ability to produce spores and the ants capitalized on that by making the fungus its main food source. About 66 Mya, South America was isolated from other land masses, and this is when gardening ants started their relationship with a fungus. Leafcutter ants are thought to have propagated the same fungal lineage for 25 million years, which means they caused the fungus to reproduce.

==Ecological effects==
Leafcutter ants can create bottom-up gaps by forming their large nests. The ants excavate soil rich in organic matter, and store additional organic matter in their underground chambers. This creates rich soils that promote plant growth. The ants can also trim the leaves of plants in the understory, allowing for more light to hit the forest floor. They can also control the types of trees and other plants by selectively bringing seeds into the underground chambers. Depending on the location of the chamber, a seed can grow by reaching light.

== Uses ==
===As food===

&quot;Atta&quot; species are a popular ingredient in Mexican cuisine, particularly in the southern states such as Chiapas, Guerrero, Hidalgo, Puebla, Veracruz, and Oaxaca. It is considered a delicacy, as well as a food of high protein content, so is often served as a main dish, not as garnish, despite its small portions. They may be eaten as the sole filling in tacos. &quot;Atta&quot;, the type of ant most eaten in Mexico, has a nutty flavor.

Also in Brazil, the queens of leafcutter ants (locally known as &quot;tanajuras&quot;) are highly appreciated as delicacies in several regions. The techniques involving their capture and cooking are considered an immaterial patrimony of the people of the Tianguá municipality, in Ceará.

&quot;Atta&quot; spp. are also eaten by the Guanes tribe.

==Cultural references==
Princess Atta from &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; was named after the genus Atta, the species group of leafcutter ants.&lt;br&gt;
In &quot;Atta (novel)&quot;, a man is shrunk by a bolt of lightning and befriends an ant named Atta.

<text>The Senkaku Islands, known as the Diaoyu Islands in China and the Tiaoyutai Islands in Taiwan, are a group of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea, administered by Japan. They were historically known in the Western world as the Pinnacle Islands. The islands are located northeast of Taiwan, east of China, west of Okinawa Island, and north of the southwestern end of the Ryukyu Islands.

The islands are the focus of a territorial dispute between Japan and China and between Japan and Taiwan. China claims the discovery and ownership of the islands from the 14th century, while Japan maintained ownership of the islands from 1895 until its surrender at the end of World War II. The United States administered the islands as part of the United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands from 1945 until 1972, when the islands returned to Japanese control under the Okinawa Reversion Agreement between the United States and Japan. The discovery of potential undersea oil reserves in 1968 in the area was a catalyst for further interest in the disputed islands. Despite the diplomatic stalemate between China and Taiwan, both governments agree that the islands are part of Taiwan as part of Toucheng Township in Yilan County. Japan administers and controls the Senkaku islands as part of the city of Ishigaki in Okinawa Prefecture. It does not acknowledge the claims of China nor Taiwan, but it has not allowed the Ishigaki administration to develop the islands.

As a result of the dispute, the public is largely barred from approaching the uninhabited islands, which are about a seven-hour boat ride from Ishigaki. Vessels from the Japan Coast Guard pursue Chinese ships crossing the maritime boundary in what one visiting journalist described in 2012 as &quot;an almost cold war-style game of cat-and-mouse&quot;, and fishing and other civilian boats are prevented from getting too close to avoid a provocative incident.

The Senkaku Islands are important nesting sites for seabirds, and are one of two remaining nesting sites in the world for the short-tailed albatross, alongside Tori-shima, Izu Islands.

== Names ==
The islands are referred to as the in Japanese. In mainland China, they are known as the &quot;Diaoyu Islands&quot; () or more fully &quot;Diaoyu Dao and its affiliated islands&quot; (), while in Taiwan they are called the &quot;Diaoyutai Islands&quot; or &quot;Tiaoyutai Islands&quot; (). In Western sources, the historical English name &quot;Pinnacle Islands&quot; is occasionally still used when neutrality among the competing national claims is desirable. 

In Okinawan (northern Ryukyu), the islands are known as &quot;&quot;, while their Yaeyama (southern Ryukyu) name is &quot;iigunkubajima&quot;.

Chinese records of these islands date back to as early as the 15th century when they were referred as &quot;Diaoyu&quot; in books such as &quot;Voyage with a Tail Wind&quot; () (1403) and &quot;Record of the Imperial Envoy&#x27;s Visit to Ryūkyū&quot; () (1534). Adopted by the Chinese Imperial Map of the Ming Dynasty, the Chinese name for the island group () and the Japanese name for the main island () both mean &quot;fishing&quot;.

==History==
===Early history===
Historically, the Chinese had used the uninhabited islands as navigational markers in making the voyage to the Ryukyu Kingdom upon commencement of diplomatic missions to the kingdom, &quot;resetting the compass at a particular isle in order to reach the next one&quot;.

The first published description of the islands in Europe appears in a book imported by Isaac Titsingh in 1796. His small library of Japanese books included by Hayashi Shihei. This text, which was published in Japan in 1785, described the Ryūkyū Kingdom. Hayashi followed convention in giving the islands their Chinese names in his map in the text, where he coloured them in the same pink as China.

In 1832, the Oriental Translation Fund of Great Britain and Ireland supported the posthumous abridged publication of Titsingh&#x27;s French translation.

The name, &quot;Pinnacle Isles&quot; was first used by James Colnett, who charted them during his 1789–1791 voyage in the &quot;Argonaut&quot;. William Robert Broughton sailed past them in November 1797 during his voyage of discovery to the North Pacific in HMS &quot;Providence&quot;, and referred to Diaoyu Island/Uotsuri Island as &quot;Peaks Island&quot;. Reference was made to the islands in Edward Belcher&#x27;s 1848 account of the voyages of HMS &quot;Sammarang&quot;. Captain Belcher remarked that &quot;the names assigned in this region have been too hastily admitted.&quot; Belcher reported anchoring off Pinnacle Island in March 1845.

In the 1870s and 1880s, the English name Pinnacle Islands was used by the British navy for the rocks adjacent to the largest island &quot;Uotsuri-shima&quot; / &quot;Diaoyu Dao&quot; (then called ); &quot;Kuba-shima&quot; / &quot;Huangwei Yu&quot; (then called &quot;Ti-a-usu&quot;); and &quot;Taishō-tō&quot; / &quot;Chiwei Yu&quot;.

A Japanese navy record issued in 1886 first started to identify the islets using equivalents of the Chinese and English terms employed by the British. The name &quot;Senkaku Retto&quot; is not found in any Japanese historical document before 1900 (the term &quot;Senkaku Gunto&quot; began being used in the late 19th century), and first appeared in print in a geography journal published in 1900. It was derived from a translation of the English name Pinnacle Islands into a Sinicized Japanese term &quot;Sento Shoto&quot; (as opposed to &quot;Senkaku Retto&quot;, i.e., the term used by the Japanese today), which has the same meaning.

The collective use of the name &quot;Diaoyutai&quot; to denote the entire group began with the advent of the controversy in the 1970s.

===Control of the islands by Japan and the US===

As the uninhabited islets were historically used as maritime navigational markers, they were never subjected to administrative control other than the recording of the geographical positions on maps, descriptions in official records of Chinese missions to the Ryukyu Kingdom, etc.

The Japanese central government incorporated the islands into Okinawa Prefecture in January 1895 while still fighting China in the First Sino-Japanese War. Around 1900, Japanese entrepreneur constructed a bonito fish processing plant on the islands, employing over 200 workers. The business failed around 1940 and the islands have remained deserted ever since. In the 1970s, Koga Tatsushirō&#x27;s son Zenji Koga and Zenji&#x27;s wife Hanako sold four islets to the Kurihara family of Saitama Prefecture. Kunioki Kurihara owned Uotsuri, Kita-Kojima, and Minami-Kojima. Kunioki&#x27;s sister owned Kuba.

The islands came under US government occupation in 1945 after the surrender of Japan ended World War II. In 1969, the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East (ECAFE) identified potential oil and gas reserves in the vicinity of the Senkaku Islands. In 1971, the Okinawa Reversion Treaty passed the U.S. Senate, returning the islands to Japanese control in 1972. Also in 1972, the Republic of China government and People&#x27;s Republic of China government officially began to declare ownership of the islands.

Since 1972, when the islands reverted to Japanese government control, the government of Ishigaki has been given civic authority over the territory. The Japanese central government, however, has prohibited Ishigaki from surveying or developing the islands.

In 1978, a Japanese political group constructed the first lighthouse on Uotsuri island and grazed two goats. Goats have since proliferated and affected the island&#x27;s vegetation.

In 1979 an official delegation from the Japanese government composed of 50 academics, government officials from the Foreign and Transport ministries, officials from the now-defunct Okinawa Development Agency, and Hiroyuki Kurihara, visited the islands and camped on Uotsuri for about four weeks. The delegation surveyed the local ecosystem, finding moles and sheep, studied the local marine life, and examined whether the islands would support human habitation.

In 1988, a Japanese political group reconstructed a lighthouse on Uotsuri Island.

In 2005, a Japanese fisherman who owned a lighthouse at Uotsuri Island expressed his intention to relinquish the ownership of the lighthouse, and the lighthouse became a national property pursuant to the provisions of the Civil Code of Japan. Since then, the Japan Coast Guard has maintained and managed the Uotsuri lighthouse.

From 2002 to 2012, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications paid the Kurihara family ¥25 million a year to rent Uotsuri, Minami-Kojima and Kita-Kojima. Japan&#x27;s Ministry of Defense rents Kuba island for an undisclosed amount. Kuba is used by the U.S. military as a practice aircraft bombing range. Japan&#x27;s central government completely owns Taisho island.

The reaction of the Kan Cabinet to the September 2010 Senkaku boat collision incident was seen by former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as &quot;a very foolish move&quot; and &quot;frighteningly naive&quot;.

On December 17, 2010, the city of Ishigaki designated January 14 as &quot;Pioneering Day&quot; to commemorate Japan&#x27;s 1895 incorporation of the Senkaku Islands. China condemned Ishigaki&#x27;s actions.

In May 2012, both the Tokyo Metropolitan and Japanese central governments announced plans to negotiate purchase of Uotsuri, Kita-Kojima, and Minami-Kojima from the Kurihara family, and on September 11, 2012, the Japanese government nationalized its control over Minami-kojima, Kita-kojima, and Uotsuri islands by purchasing them from the Kurihara family for ¥2.05 billion. China&#x27;s Foreign Ministry objected saying Beijing would not &quot;sit back and watch its territorial sovereignty violated.&quot;

In 2014, Japan constructed a lighthouse and wharf featuring Japanese flag insignia on the islets.

==Geography==

The island group are known to consist of five uninhabited islets and three barren rocks. China has identified and named as many as 71 islets that belong to this group after the Japanese Cabinet released names of 39 uninhabited islands.

These minor features in the East China Sea are located approximately 120 nautical miles northeast of Taiwan, 200 nautical miles east of the Chinese mainland and 200 nautical miles southwest of the Japanese island of Okinawa.

According to one visitor, Uotsuri-shima, the largest of the islands, consists of a pair of rocky gray mountains with steep, boulder-strewn slopes rising almost straight from the water&#x27;s edge. Other, nearby islands were described as large rocks covered by low vegetation.

In ascending order of distances, the island cluster is located:

* east of Pengjia Islet, Republic of China (Taiwan)
* north of Ishigaki Island, Japan
* northeast of Keelung, Republic of China (Taiwan)
* west of Okinawa Island, Japan


The depth of the surrounding waters of the continental shelf is approximately except for the Okinawa Trough on the south. The shelf is shallow enough that the western islands were likely connected to the mainland during the Last Glacial Period.

=== Geology ===

Uotsuri, Kitakojima, Minamikojima and surrounding islets are sedimentary in origin, predominantly consisting of probably Miocene aged sandstone and sandstone-conglomerate, with subordinate conglomerate, coal seams up to thick, and rare siltstone beds. The sedimentary strata have around of exposed thickness at Uotsuri, and have SW-NE, EW and NW-SE strikes, with a general inclination of a dip of less than 20 degrees towards the North. These strata are intruded by sheets of Mio-Pliocene porphyritic hornblende diorite, and are fringed by recent coral outcrops and surface talus deposits. Kuba and Taisho are volcanic in origin, with Kuba comprising &quot;pyroxene andesite, lava, volcanic bombs, pumice, limestone, and other rocky material&quot; and Taisho is thought to be consist of &quot;andesite, tuff breccia, and tuffaceous sandstone&quot;.

==Wildlife==
===Plants===
Permission for collecting herbs on three of the islands was recorded in an Imperial Chinese edict of 1893.

Several floral surveys have been conducted on the Senkaku islands, with a 1980 survey finding that Uotsuri had 339 species of plants. These ecological communities varied based on altitude, with the communities being divided into windswept mountaintop vegetation with &quot;Podocarpus macrophyllus&quot; trees, with the understory including &quot;Liriope muscari&quot; and &quot;Rhaphiolepis umbellata,&quot; inclined high forest including the palms &quot;Livistona chinensis&quot; and &quot;Arenga engleri,&quot; lowland windswept shrub forest including &quot;Ficus microcarpa&quot; and &quot;Planchonella obovata,&quot; and seashore plants. Minamikojima was much less diverse, and dominated by grasses, while Kitakojima only had sparse plant life. Kuba has a forest near the crater, which includes a variety of flora including &quot;Ceodes umbellifera, Macaranga tanarius, Ficus benjamina, Diospyros maritima, Trema orientalis, Machilus thunbergii, and Livistona subglobosa,&quot; with forest floor plants being sparse.

===Animals===
In an account by in 1900, it was noted the large number of birds present on the islands, tens of thousands of short-tailed and black-footed albatross would flock on Uotsuri-shima, in the colder months, while hundreds of thousands of sooty tern and brown noddy would descend on Kitakojima and Minamikojima in the warmer months. He also described the air of Uotsuri as swarming with bluebottle flies and mosquitoes. In the same year, an account by , surveying Kuba Island, noted the presence of whimbrel, Von Schrenck&#x27;s bittern, the streaked shearwater, and the brown booby. Mikinosuke also noted the large number of chickens and feral cats on the island, with dozens of cats descending on the seabirds at night. Kitakojima and Minamikojima are one of only two significant breeding places of the rare short-tailed albatross (&quot;Phoebastria albatrus&quot;). The islands have been recognised as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International.

Uotsuri-shima, the largest island, has a number of endemic species such as the Senkaku mole (&quot;Mogera uchidai&quot;) and Okinawa-kuro-oo-ari ant. Due to the introduction of domestic goats to the island in 1978, the Senkaku mole is now an endangered species. The striped field mouse (&quot;Apodemus agrarius&quot;) has also been noted to be present on Uotsuri. Surveys from 1900 to 1953 and noted the presence of the Asian house shrew, black rats and fruit bats but these were not noted in more recent surveys.

Six species of reptile have been recorded from the islands, including &quot;Gekko hokouensis&quot; (Uotsuri, Minami) &quot;Eumeces elegans&quot; (Uotsuri, Minami), an indeterminate species of &quot;Scincella&quot; (Uotsuri) &quot;Ramphotyphlops braminus&quot; (Uotsuri) &quot;Elaphe carinata&quot; (Uotsuri) and &quot;Dinodon rufozonatus&quot; (Uotsuri).

Rich marine biodiversity adjacent to the islands has been recognized but poorly studied. Seemingly, varieties of larger fish and animals inhabit or migrate through the area, including tunas, sharks, marlins, critically endangered hawksbill sea turtles, dolphins, pilot whales, sperm whales, and humpback whales.

==Sovereignty dispute==

Territorial sovereignty over the islands and the maritime boundaries around them are disputed between the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the Republic of China, and Japan.

The People&#x27;s Republic and Republic of China claim that the islands have been a part of Chinese territory since at least 1534. China acknowledges that Japan took control of the islands in 1894–1895 during the first Sino-Japanese War, through the signature of the Treaty of Shimonoseki. China asserts that the Potsdam Declaration required that Japan relinquish control of all islands except for &quot;the islands of Honshū, Hokkaidō, Kyūshū, Shikoku and such minor islands as we determine&quot;, and China states that this means control of the islands should pass to Republic of China, which was part of China at the time of the first Sino-Japanese War as well as of the San Francisco Peace Treaty. Both the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) and the Republic of China (ROC) respectively separately claim sovereignty based on arguments that include the following points:

* Discovery and early recording in maps and travelogues.
* The islands being China&#x27;s frontier off-shore defence against wokou (Japanese pirates) during the Ming and Qing dynasties (1368–1911).
* A Chinese map of Asia, as well as the &quot;Sangoku Tsūran Zusetsu&quot; map compiled by Japanese cartographer Hayashi Shihei in the 18th century, showing the islands as a part of China.
* Japan taking control of the islands in 1895 at the same time as the First Sino-Japanese War was happening. Furthermore, correspondence between Foreign Minister Inoue and Interior Minister Yamagata in 1885, warned against the erection of national markers and developing their land to avoid Qing Dynasty suspicions.
* The Potsdam Declaration stating that &quot;Japanese sovereignty shall be limited to the islands of Honshū, Hokkaidō, Kyūshū, Shikoku and such minor islands as we determine&quot;, and &quot;we&quot; referred to the victors of the Second World War who met at Potsdam and Japan&#x27;s acceptance of the terms of the Declaration when it surrendered.
* China&#x27;s formal protest of the 1971 US transfer of control to Japan.

Japan does not accept that there is a dispute, asserting that the islands are an integral part of Japan. Japan has rejected claims that the islands were under China&#x27;s control prior to 1895, and that these islands were contemplated by the Potsdam Declaration or affected by the San Francisco Peace Treaty.

The existence of the back-arc basin complicates descriptive issues. According to Professor Ji Guoxing of the Asia-Pacific Department at Shanghai Institute for International Studies,
* China&#x27;s interpretation of the geography is that

...the Okinawa Trough proves that the continental shelves of China and Japan are not connected, that the Trough serves as the boundary between them, and that the Trough should not be ignored ...

* Japan&#x27;s interpretation of the geography is that

...the trough is just an incidental depression in a continuous continental margin between the two countries ... [and] the trough should be ignored ...

The stance given by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is that the Senkaku Islands are clearly an inherent territory of Japan, in light of historical facts and based upon international law, and the Senkaku Islands are under the valid control of Japan. They also state &quot;there exists no issue of territorial sovereignty to be resolved concerning the Senkaku Islands.&quot; The following points are given:

* The islands had been uninhabited and showed no trace of having been under the control of China prior to 1895.
* The purposes of maps and the intentions behind their creators can vary significantly, and the mere existence of an ancient map does not substantiate claims of territorial sovereignty. The map (1785) cited by China from Hayashi Shihei does not provide evidence that the creator&#x27;s coloring was intended to indicate an understanding of territorial sovereignty. This map depicts Taiwan as being only about one-third the size of Okinawa&#x27;s main island and is colored differently from that of mainland China. This suggests that the creator did not possess accurate knowledge.
* The islands were neither part of Taiwan nor part of the Pescadores Islands, which were ceded to Japan by the Qing Dynasty of China in Article II of the May 1895 Treaty of Shimonoseki, thus were not renounced by Japan under Article II of the San Francisco Peace Treaty, which serves as the international law addressing the aftermath of WW2.
* A resident of Okinawa Prefecture who had been engaging in activities such as fishery around the Senkaku Islands since around 1884 made an application for the lease of the islands, and approval was granted by the Meiji Government in 1896. After this approval, he sent a total of 248 workers to those islands and ran the following businesses: constructing piers, collecting bird feathers, manufacturing dried bonito, collecting coral, raising cattle, manufacturing canned goods and collecting mineral phosphate guano (bird manure for fuel use). The fact that the Meiji Government gave approval concerning the use of the Senkaku Islands to an individual, who in turn was able to openly run these businesses mentioned above based on the approval, demonstrates Japan&#x27;s valid control over the Islands.
* In May 1920, a thank-you letter from the Republic of China&#x27;s consulate in Nagasaki regarding the rescue of Chinese fishermen in distress near the Senkaku Islands by Japanese fishermen included the notation &quot;Senkaku Islands, Yaeyama District, Okinawa Prefecture, Empire of Japan.&quot;
* Though the islands were controlled by the United States as an occupying power between 1945 and 1972, Japan has since 1972 exercised administration over the islands.
* In 1953, the official Chinese newspaper People&#x27;s Daily published an article that explicitly stated that the Ryukyu Islands consist of seven island groups, including the Senkaku Islands. Additionally, in the world atlas published by the China Map Press in 1958 (reprinted in 1960), these islands were clearly referred to as the &quot;Senkaku Islands&quot; and considered part of Okinawa.
* Republic of China and People Republic of China only started claiming ownership of the islands in 1971, following a May 1969 United Nations report that a large oil and gas reserve may exist under the seabed near the islands.

In 2012 the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs created a website in support of its claims; in late 2014 the National Marine Data and Information Service, a department under the State Oceanic Administration of People&#x27;s Republic of China created a website of its own to support its claims. In 2016, Chinese fishing, Coast Guard and other vessels were entering the territorial waters around the islands almost daily and in August 2016 the Japanese foreign minister Fumio Kishida reportedly told China&#x27;s foreign minister Wang Yi &quot;that the activity represented an escalation of tensions&quot; according to Japanese sources. It was the first meeting of the top diplomats since the Permanent Court of Arbitration ruling against China&#x27;s South China Sea claims and was coincident with a three-party meeting (including South Korea) relative to a North Korean submarine-launched missile in the Sea of Japan.

On 22 June 2020, the Ishigaki City Council voted to change the name of the area containing the Senkaku Islands from &quot;Tonoshiro&quot; to &quot;Tonoshiro Senkaku&quot;. Republic of China&#x27;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded that the islands belong to Republic of China, and any moves to deny this fact are invalid. The Taiwanese government and the opposition KMT party also condemned the council&#x27;s move, saying the Islands are ROC territory and the nation would not give up even &quot;an inch&quot; of its sovereignty.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Diaoyu Islands: The Truth&quot; is a documentary film produced by Chris D. Nebe and J.J. Osbun of Monarex Hollywood Corporation and directed by Chris D. Nebe. Nebe calls on the Japanese Government to cede the islands to China, asserting that Japan has no justifiable claim to the islands, and that the United States of America has turned a blind eye in Japan&#x27;s favor due to the need of the United States to have a strong ally between it and China. Reception of the film was positive in Chinese media, while the Australian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s &quot;Correspondents Report&quot; called Nebe a &#x27;Chinese propagandist&#x27; in 2014.

In 2018 the National Museum of Territory and Sovereignty (currently located in the Toranomon Mitsui Building, Chiyoda, Tokyo) was established by the Japanese government to raise public awareness of Japanese territorial rights issues concerning the Senkaku Islands, as well as issues concerning territorial claims to Takeshima and southernmost Kuril Islands.

<doc id="348340" wikidata="Q1220957" url="?curid=348340" title="Scarlet (cloth)">
<text>Scarlet was a type of fine and expensive woollen cloth common in Medieval Europe. In the assessment of John Munro, &#x27;the medieval &quot;scarlet&quot; was therefore a very high-priced, luxury, woollen broadcloth, invariably woven from the finest English wools, and always dyed with the red dye kermes, even if mixed with woad, and other dyestuffs. There is no evidence for the use of the term &quot;scarlet&quot; for any other textile, even though other textiles, especially silks, were also dyed with kermes.&#x27;

==Characteristics==

The origins of the word &quot;scarlet&quot; have been debated quite extensively and are crucial to understanding what scarlet actually was in the Middle Ages. The word certainly came to English from Old French &quot;escarlate&quot;, which is one of a wide range of similar words in the Romance languages such as Provençal &quot;escarlat&quot;, Spanish &quot;escarlata&quot;, Portuguese &quot;escarlate&quot;, Italian &quot;scarlatto&quot;, and medieval Latin &quot;scarlat(t)um&quot;. The origin of this romance word, however, has been more widely debated. For a long time the origin was thought to be a Persian word which takes forms like &quot;saqalāt&quot;, &quot;siqalāt&quot;, or &quot;suqlāt&quot;. However, the romance word is now thought to come from Arabic &quot;siklāt&quot; (plural &quot;siklātūn&quot;), denoting very expensive, luxury silks dyed scarlet-red using the exceptionally expensive dye kermes. Arabic &quot;siklāt&quot; is first attested around the ninth century, and now thought also to be the origin of the Persian word, which is first attested around the 1290s. The origin of the word &quot;siklāt&quot; is itself uncertain and may come from the Late Roman term &quot;sigillatus&quot; (Latin)/&quot;σιγιλλατον&quot; (Greek), denoting a kind of cloth decorated with seal-like patterns (from Latin &quot;sigillum&quot; &#x27;seal&#x27;). The word then came to be used of woollen cloth dyed with the same dye. The most obvious route for the Arabic word &quot;siklāt&quot; to have entered the Romance languages would be via the Arabic-speaking Iberian region of Al-Andalus, particularly Almería, where kermes was produced extensively.

Recent work has discredited an alternative suggestion that the word &quot;scarlet&quot; originated in the Germanic languages. Henri Pirenne, in an argument elaborated by Jean-Baptiste Weckerlin, argued that the term &quot;scarlet&quot; originated in the Germanic words related to Dutch &quot;schar&quot; (&#x27;shear&#x27;) and &quot;laken&quot; (&#x27;cloth&#x27;), in which case scarlet was originally highly sheared cloth. They argued that the word spread from Germanic to other European languages due to the dominance of the Low Countries in the medieval wool trade. They guessed that &quot;scarlet&quot; became associated with the colour red because this was among the most prestigious colours, and therefore most fitting for exceptionally fine cloth. However, their ideas have not proved a good fit with the full range of European evidence: most importantly, historical evidence for the production of scarlet does not indicate more extensive shearing than other cloth. It is now thought that terms like Old High German &quot;schar-lachen&quot;, Middle Low German &quot;scharlaken&quot;, and the Scandinavian derivatives (Danish &quot;skarlagen&quot;, Swedish &quot;skarlakan&quot;, Icelandic &quot;skarlak&quot;, &quot;skarlakan&quot;) originally referred to highly sheared cloth produced on the horizontal treadle loom that came into use in northern Europe around the eleventh century. Meanwhile, Germanic words like Old Norse &quot;skarlat&quot;, Middle High German &quot;scharlât&quot;, and early modern Flemish &quot;schaerlat&quot; are all now thought to have been borrowed from the Romance words which themselves derived from Arabic &quot;siklāt&quot;.

It has long been claimed that scarlet cloth was produced in red, white, blue, green, and brown colors, among others, with carmine red being merely the most common colour. However, recent work has argued that this is a misunderstanding of the use of colour-terms in medieval cloth production, and that references to other colours in scarlet production refers to their colour before dyeing with kermes.

Scarlet cloth was particularly fashionable in Europe during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, but fell out of fashion during the sixteenth to seventeenth.

==Appearances in popular culture==

It is probable that the name of the character Will Scarlett in the Robin Hood legends referred to this type of cloth, similarly to the common occupational surnames (e.g. Weaver, Cooper, Fletcher, etc.).

<text>Peter John Sinfield (27 December 1943 – 14 November 2024) was an English poet and songwriter. He was best known as a co-founder and lyricist of King Crimson. Their debut album &quot;In the Court of the Crimson King&quot; is considered one of the first and most influential progressive rock albums ever released.

Sinfield&#x27;s lyrics are known for their surreal imagery, often involving common fantasy concepts, nature, or the sea. They often also deal with emotional concepts and, sometimes, storyline concepts. Later in his career, he adapted his songwriting to better suit pop music, and wrote a number of successful songs for artists such as Celine Dion, Cher, Cliff Richard, Leo Sayer, Five Star, and Bucks Fizz.

Paul Stump, in his 1997 &quot;History of Progressive Rock&quot;, called Sinfield &quot;the premier littérateur of Progressive&quot;. In 2005, Sinfield was referred to as a &quot;prog rock hero&quot; in &quot;Q&quot; magazine for his lyrical work and influence in the music industry.

==Early life==
Sinfield was born in Fulham, London, to mixed English-Irish ancestry and a bohemian activist mother Deidre (also known as Joey or Daphne). He seldom had contact with his father Ian. Up until the age of eight, he was raised largely by his mother&#x27;s German housekeeper Maria Wallenda, a high wire walker from the circus act the Flying Wallendas, after which he was sent to Danes Hill School in Oxshott. It was there that Sinfield discovered a love of words and their uses and meanings, with the guidance of his tutor John Mawson. He began to read literature of all kinds, particularly poetry. He later attended Ranelagh Grammar School in Bracknell, Berkshire. He left school at sixteen and worked briefly as a travel agent, believing that this would &quot;allow him to see the world&quot;. 

Sinfield then went on to work for a computer company for six years, travelling around Europe when he could and hanging around with friends from the Chelsea School of Art. To compete with his art school friends, Sinfield learned to play the guitar. He wrote poetry beginning in the mid 1960s and made a living on market stalls selling handmade kites, lampshades, paintings and customised clothing. Sinfield spent a number of years drifting around Morocco and Spain before returning to England. In 1967, he formed the Creation, a band he said he envisioned as a cross between Donovan and the Who. One of the members, Ian McDonald, convinced Sinfield to switch from singer/guitarist to lyricist.

==King Crimson==
In 1968, Ian McDonald joined Giles, Giles and Fripp, a progressive pop trio consisting of Michael Giles, Peter Giles, and Robert Fripp, who were looking to do more with music than their three-man line-up could manage. McDonald let the others know that he was already working with someone who could write lyrics. In their primordial form, Giles, Giles &amp; Fripp, augmented by McDonald and ex-Fairport Convention vocalist Judy Dyble, recorded an early version of the McDonald-Sinfield song &quot;I Talk to the Wind&quot;, which later became part of King Crimson&#x27;s repertoire.

Peter Giles left the group at about this time, to be replaced by Greg Lake, and Sinfield joined around the same time. In his own words, &quot;I became their pet hippie, because I could tell them where to go to buy the funny clothes that they saw everyone wearing&quot;. Sinfield also came up with the name King Crimson. Sinfield loved working with the band and, in addition to writing the phantasmagorical lyrics that came to be part of King Crimson&#x27;s trademark, he also ran the group&#x27;s light-show and mixed the sound at their concerts, and offered advice on artwork, album design, and other details of the band&#x27;s releases. Sinfield&#x27;s performance role in the band was limited to occasionally producing sound effects using an EMS VCS 3 synthesizer.

Fripp became involved with other projects (most notably the Centipede orchestra), which left Sinfield with much of the responsibility for the final version and design of the album, including the uniquely ornate jacket. The relationship between Sinfield and Fripp became increasingly strained as the band progressed. On their fourth album, &quot;Islands&quot;, Sinfield began exploring new lyrical territory, with more sexual imagery juxtaposed with the languidly surreal title track. On 1 January 1972, following a tour of the United States, Fripp told Sinfield he could no longer work with him and asked him to leave the group.

==ELP, PFM, and &quot;Still&quot;==
In 1972, Sinfield, associated with E.G. Records, which represented King Crimson and Roxy Music, was producing Roxy Music&#x27;s debut album and their hit single &quot;Virginia Plain&quot;. It was during this time that he first decided to venture into recording a solo album. In 1973, he wrote English lyrics for the Italian group Premiata Forneria Marconi (PFM) and produced their first album for Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer (ELP)&#x27;s Manticore Records, titled &quot;Photos of Ghosts&quot; (1973), as well as the follow-up, &quot;The World Became the World&quot; (1975).

In 1973, Sinfield formed a band provisionally called A Bowl of Soup and featuring Phil Jump on keyboards, Richard Brunton on guitar, Allan &quot;Min&quot; Mennie on drums, Steve Dolan on bass, and Sinfield himself on vocals, guitar, and synthesizer. They were booked to record an album at Command Studios. This album, &quot;Still&quot;, was ultimately credited as a Pete Sinfield solo album, and in addition to the five members of A Bowl of Soup it featured input from numerous former (Greg Lake, Mel Collins, Ian Wallace), and future (John Wetton) members of King Crimson. While working on &quot;Still&quot;, he was approached by Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, who needed a lyricist of Sinfield&#x27;s calibre. Sinfield put it more bluntly: &quot;Greg [Lake] called me. &#x27;I need help with the lyrics.&#x27; And, boy, did he need help.&quot; &quot;Still&quot; was originally released on ELP&#x27;s own Manticore label in 1973, but Sinfield found himself subsumed into Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer. Already having a fear of the stage which he had little time to overcome due to writing demands, his solo career was put on hold and he worked with ELP for the next few years.

During this time, Sinfield lived with his first wife Stephanie in The Mill House, Surrey, which was loaned to him by ELP. His neighbour was Gary Brooker of Procol Harum, with whom he co-wrote five songs on Brooker&#x27;s first solo album &quot;No More Fear of Flying&quot;. He also released a book containing his previous lyrics and poems titled &quot;Under the Sky&quot; (named after one of the lyrics from &quot;Still&quot;). In 1975, &quot;I Believe in Father Christmas&quot;, a song co-written with Greg Lake was released, reaching No. 2 in the UK charts. &quot;C&#x27;est la Vie&quot;, from the album &quot;Works Volume 1&quot; and written by Lake and Sinfield, reached No. 75 in Canada, October 15, 1977.

==Ibiza years==
After overestimating his wealth and underestimating his percentage of royalties from ELP, he moved to Ibiza to live as a tax exile, and enjoyed his first interruption from continual work in the music industry. There he met a circle of artists, actors, painters, and members of the Chelsea Arts Club such as Peter Unsworth and Barry Flanagan, and eventually parted from his first wife. During his time in Ibiza, Sinfield&#x27;s break from songwriting allowed him to spend his time travelling, socialising, and reflecting, which he had been unable to do for the previous decade.

During the late 1970s, he continued to move in communities around Spain. In 1978, following the success of his previous lyrics for Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, Sinfield was asked by ELP to produce lyrics for their album &quot;Love Beach&quot;, now regarded by many (including Sinfield himself) to be the weakest of all ELP&#x27;s albums. In 1978 he also narrated Robert Sheckley&#x27;s &quot;In a Land of Clear Colours&quot;, an audio sci-fi story released the following year on a limited edition of 1000 vinyl records. The backing music for the story was provided by Brian Eno, with whom Sinfield had previously worked while producing Roxy Music. By the time he returned to London in 1980, with his new Spanish wife (a model and runner-up for Miss Spain), he discovered that progressive rock music was no longer in demand, and that punk had emerged in the UK.

Sinfield also wrote the lyrics, in 1978–1980, for the English versions of &quot;Alla fiera dell&#x27;est&quot; (&quot;Highdown Fair&quot;) and &quot;La pulce d&#x27;acqua&quot; (&quot;Fables and Fantasies&quot;), by Italian singer-songwriter Angelo Branduardi and, in 1981–1983, for &quot;It&#x27;s Your Dream&quot; (&quot;Nikka Costa&quot;), &quot;My First Love&quot;, &quot;I Believe in Fairy Tales&quot;, and &quot;Trick or Treat&quot; (&quot;Fairy Tales&quot;), by the American child singer Nikka Costa.

==Pop years==
Upon his return to London in 1980, his publisher introduced him to Andy Hill, a composer and fellow songwriter. He and Sinfield collaborated on such hits as &quot;The Land of Make Believe&quot; by Bucks Fizz, which reached No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart, and became one of the biggest-selling hits of the decade. While re-educating himself to adapt to the pop music industry with the help of Hill, he returned to Spain, where he was already established in the communities within Ibiza and Barcelona, and as his career progressed, moved into a house in Majorca. At this time, he appeared on Spanish television programme &quot;Musical Express&quot;, where he was interviewed and performed a set with Boz Burrell, Tim Hinkley, Michael Giles, Bobby Tench, Mel Collins, and Gary Brooker.

In the United Kingdom, he continued to release hits with Hill, including &quot;I Hear Talk&quot; by Bucks Fizz and &quot;Have You Ever Been in Love&quot; by Leo Sayer (which they wrote with John Danter). He also co-wrote Five Star&#x27;s &quot;Rain or Shine&quot; with Billy Livsey. After divorcing his wife and leaving Majorca, he returned to the UK around 1990 to a flat in Holland Park and continued to write lyrics for popular music. In 1993, he re-released his solo album as &quot;Stillusion&quot;. In the same year, he and Hill released &quot;Think Twice&quot; by Celine Dion, which went on to become a massive hit and won an Ivor Novello Award for &quot;Best Song Musically and Lyrically&quot;. Sinfield and Hill had also won an Ivor Novello a decade previously for the Leo Sayer track, &quot;Have You Ever Been in Love&quot;.

==Haiku==

There had been rumours of a second solo album, and Sinfield worked on it for a couple of years with vibraphone player and programmer Poli Palmer, formerly of Family. It was always a challenging project, made more so by Sinfield&#x27;s quadruple bypass operation in 2005. After a period of convalescence, Sinfield attempted to restart the project, but it failed to take off.

During this time Sinfield wrote an increasing number of haiku. After his appearance at the Genoa Poetry Festival at the Ducal Palace in June 2010, he has turned his creative energies more towards poetry.

Sinfield was active as a writer and appeared in the 2009 BBC documentary &quot;Prog Rock Britannia: An Observation in Three Movements&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Sinfield lived in Aldeburgh, Suffolk. He was active within the songwriting community and was a member of the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors committee. He underwent heart surgery in 2005.

Sinfield died on 14 November 2024, at the age of 80.

==Influences==
Sinfield had a fairly unusual and colourful upbringing, being an only child (bar his adopted brother, Dennis) of a bisexual mother who ran a hair salon and one of the first burger bars in London in the 1950s. He grew up in a bohemian household, and claims to have vivid memories of extravagant and wonderful Christmases, later inspiring the lyrics for his hit &quot;I Believe in Father Christmas&quot;, which recalled a lost and naive faith in Father Christmas. Sinfield claimed that &quot;A Poet&#x27;s Notebook&quot; by Edith Sitwell had an important influence on his writing, as well as the works of Arthur Rimbaud, Paul Verlaine, William Blake, Kahlil Gibran, and Shakespeare.

Musically he was largely influenced by Bob Dylan and Donovan. Hearing Donovan&#x27;s opening line of &quot;Colours&quot;: &quot;Yellow is the colour of my true love&#x27;s hair&quot;&#x27; was, Sinfield stated, the defining moment when he decided he had the desire and ability to start writing songs.

<text>Partner dances are dances whose basic choreography involves coordinated dancing of two partners. As such it occupies a middle ground between individuals dancing alone or individually in a non-coordinated manner, and groups of people dancing simultaneously in a coordinated manner.

== United States dance history ==

Prior to the 20th century, many ballroom dance and folk dances existed in America. As jazz music developed at the start of the 20th century, Black American communities in tandem developed the Charleston and eventually the Lindy Hop by the end of the 1920s. Many cities had regular local competitions such as the Savoy Ballroom which accelerated the development and popularization of the dance. The dances were introduced to wider public through movies and regular performances such as those done at the Cotton Club in New York.

An unusual (for the time) feature of the dance was the inclusion of sections where the dancers would move apart from each other and perform individual steps (known as the &quot;breakaway&quot;). Another unique feature that was introduced in these early days were the first airsteps, also known today as aerials. These daring maneuvers were exciting for the audiences to watch, and when combined with live performances such as those by Ella Fitzgerald, became a staple of organized Lindy Hop performances.

Other dances such as Collegiate shag and Balboa developed in the United States in the same time period but never saw the same international popularity as the Lindy Hop.

Over the next few decades, popular music changed, moving away from the big band sound of swing to styles like rhythm and blues and then rock and roll. Due to this and other factors, the Lindy Hop evolved and mutated into a number of different styles. Dance styles such as West Coast Swing and Modern Jive integrated features of ballroom dances and new music to create distinctive but similar dances.

== German dance history ==
In 1023, the German poet Ruodlieb referred to a couple dance with a basic motif of a boy wooing a girl, and the girl rejecting his advances. Men and women dancing as couples, both holding one hand of their partner, and &quot;embracing&quot; each other, can be seen in illustrations from 15th-century Germany.

At the end of the 13th century and during the 14th century, nobles and wealthy patricians danced as couples in procession in a slow dignified manner in a circle, while farmers and lower classes danced in a lively fashion. The burgher middle class combined the dances with the processional as a &quot;fore dance&quot;, and the turning as an &quot;after dance&quot;.

The Danse de Paysans&#x27; (Peasant&#x27;s Dance) by Théodore de Bry shows a couple with a man lifting his partner off the ground, pulling her towards him while holding her closely with both arms. His Danse de Seigneurs et Dames (Dance of the Lords and Ladies) features one Lord with his arms around the waist of his Lady. Syncopated rhythms gained widespread popularity for dancing in the last two centuries, although usually less complex and more regular than previous music.

An old couple dance which can be found all over Northern Europe is known as &quot;Manchester&quot; or &quot;Lott is Dead&quot;. In Bavaria words to the music include &quot;One, two, three and one is four, Dianderl lifts up her skirt And shows me her knees&quot;, and in Bavaria one verse invites the girl to leave her bedroom window open to allow a visit from her partner.

Dance partners stay together for the duration of the dance and, most often, dance independently of other couples dancing at the same time, if any.

Although this kind of dancing can be seen, for instance, in ballet, this term is usually applied to various forms of social dance, ballroom dance, folk dance, and similar forms.

== Group dances ==
Partner dance may be a basis of a formation dance, a round dance, a square dance or a sequence dance. These are kinds of group dance where the dancers form couples and dance either the same choreographed or called routines or routines within a common choreography—routines that control both how each couple dances together and how each couple moves in accord with other couples. In square dance one will often change partners during the course of a dance, in which case one distinguishes between the &quot;original partner&quot; and a &quot;situational partner&quot;.

== Leader and follower ==

In most partner dances, one is the leader and the other is the follower. As a rule, they maintain connection with each other. In some dances the connection is loose and called dance handhold. In other dances the connection involves body contact. In the latter case the connection imposes significant restrictions on relative body positions during the dance and hence it is often called dance frame. It is also said that each partner has their own &quot;dance frame&quot;. Although the handhold connection poses almost no restriction on body positions, it is quite helpful that the partners are aware of their dance frames, since this is instrumental in leading and following.

In promenade-style partner dancing there is no leader or follower, and the couple dance side-by-side maintaining a connection with each other through a promenade handhold. The leader dances traditionally to the left of the follower.

Some peoples have folk partner dances, where partners do not have any body contact at all, but there is still a kind of &quot;call-response&quot; interaction.

A popular form of partner dancing is slow dance.

==History of same-sex partner dancing==

Generally, partner dance has taken place between a man and a woman. Before the 1950s, however, if there was not a sufficient number of partners of the opposite sex available, couples formed into pairs of the same sex.

Sometimes this is also done as part of a dance tradition. In traditional partner dances done within certain conservative cultures, such as in traditional Uyghur partner dance, dancing is often done with the same sex as a matter of respect for the conservative culture.

As learning both dance roles has become more common and social norms have changed, many events and competitions have removed restrictions.

Typically, in ballroom competitions today, same-sex partnerships are allowed up to the silver level (the third level in competition, after newcomer and bronze). However, these are comparatively rare.

It is thought that some partner dances actually developed with more relaxed gender roles. Prior to adoption by the mainstream, these dances did not actually normalize the man-lead/woman-follow paradigm.

==Double partner dancing==
This kind of dance involves dancing of three persons together: usually one man with two women or one woman with two men. In social dancing, double partnering is best known during times when a significant demographic disproportion happens between the two sexes. For example, this happens during wars: in the military, there is a lack of women, while among civilians, able dancers are mostly women. For example, during the Second World War, many advanced leaders learned to dance Lindy Hop with two followers.

Since the 1980s, double partner dance is often performed in Ceroc, Hustle, Salsa and Swing dance communities, experienced leaders leading two followers.

There are a number of folk dances that feature this arrangement. Among these are the Russian Troika and the Polish Trojak folk dances, where a man dances with two or more women. A Cajun dance with the name &quot;Troika&quot; is also known.

<doc id="348348" wikidata="Q498729" url="?curid=348348" title="Kenny Dorham">
<text>McKinley Howard &quot;Kenny&quot; Dorham (August 30, 1924 – December 5, 1972) was an American jazz trumpeter, composer, and occasional singer. Dorham&#x27;s talent is frequently lauded by critics and other musicians, but he never received the kind of attention or public recognition from the jazz establishment that many of his peers did. For this reason, writer Gary Giddins said that Dorham&#x27;s name has become &quot;virtually synonymous with &#x27;underrated&#x27;.&quot;

Dorham also composed the bossa nova jazz standard &quot;Blue Bossa&quot;, which was first recorded by his associate Joe Henderson.

==Biography==
Dorham was one of the most active bebop trumpeters. Early in his career, he played in the big bands of Lionel Hampton, Billy Eckstine, Dizzy Gillespie, and Mercer Ellington, and in Charlie Parker&#x27;s quintet. He joined Parker&#x27;s band in December 1948. He was a charter member of the original cooperative the Jazz Messengers. He also recorded as a sideman with Thelonious Monk and Sonny Rollins, and he replaced Clifford Brown in the Max Roach Quintet after Brown&#x27;s death in 1956. In addition to sideman work, Dorham led his own groups, including the Jazz Prophets (formed shortly after Art Blakey took over the Jazz Messengers name). The Jazz Prophets, featuring a young Bobby Timmons on piano, bassist Sam Jones, and tenorman J. R. Monterose, with guest Kenny Burrell on guitar, recorded a live album, &quot;&#x27;Round About Midnight at the Cafe Bohemia&quot;, in 1956 for Blue Note.

In 1963, Dorham added the 26-year-old tenor saxophonist Joe Henderson to his group, which later recorded the album &quot;Una Mas&quot;. The friendship between the two musicians led to a number of other albums, such as Henderson&#x27;s &quot;Page One&quot;, &quot;Our Thing&quot;, and &quot;In &#x27;n Out&quot;. Dorham recorded frequently throughout the 1960s for Blue Note and Prestige Records, as leader and as sideman for Henderson, Jackie McLean, Cedar Walton, Andrew Hill, Milt Jackson, and others.

Dorham&#x27;s later quartet consisted of some well-known jazz musicians: Tommy Flanagan (piano), Paul Chambers (double bass), and Art Taylor (drums). Their recording debut was &quot;Quiet Kenny&quot; for Prestige&#x27;s New Jazz label, an album which featured mostly ballads. An earlier quartet featuring Dorham as co-leader with alto saxophone player Ernie Henry had released an album together under the name &quot;Kenny Dorham/Ernie Henry Quartet.&quot; They produced the album &quot;2 Horns / 2 Rhythm&quot; for Riverside Records in 1957, with double bassist Eddie Mathias and drummer G.T. Hogan. In 1990, the album was re-released on CD under the name &quot;Kenny Dorham Quartet featuring Ernie Henry&quot;.

===Death===
During his final years, Dorham suffered from kidney disease, from which he died on December 5, 1972, aged 48.

<text>Weaning is the process of gradually introducing an infant human or other mammal to what will be its adult diet while withdrawing the supply of its mother&#x27;s milk. In the UK, weaning primarily refers to the introduction of solid foods at 6 months; in the US, it primarily refers to stopping breastfeeding.

The process takes place only in mammals, as only mammals produce milk. The infant is considered to be fully weaned once it is no longer fed by any breast milk (or bottled substitute).

==Humans==

In some cultures, weaning progresses with the introduction of feeding the child food that has been prechewed by the parent along with continued breastfeeding, a practice known as premastication. The practice was important throughout human history in that it naturally gave a child a greatly improved protein source in addition to preventing iron deficiency. However, premasticated food from caregivers of lower socioeconomic status in areas of endemic diseases can result in the passing of the disease to the child.

How and when to wean a human infant is controversial. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends feeding a baby only breast milk for the first six months of its life. Many mothers find breastfeeding challenging, especially in countries where many mothers have to return to work relatively soon after the birth of their child.

The American Academy of Pediatrics, the World Health Organization, the National Health Service Choices UK, and the National Health &amp; Medical Research Council in Australia recommend waiting until six months to introduce baby food. However, many baby food companies market their &quot;stage 1&quot; foods to children between four and six months old with the precaution that the food is meant to be consumed in addition to breast milk or formula and is just for &quot;practice&quot;. These practice foods are generally soft and runny. Examples include mashed fruit and vegetables. Certain foods are recommended to be avoided. The United Kingdom&#x27;s NHS recommends withholding foods including those &quot;that contain wheat, gluten, nuts, peanuts, peanut products, seeds, liver, eggs, fish, shellfish, cows&#x27; milk and soft or unpasteurised cheese&quot; until a baby is six months old, as they may cause food allergies or make the baby ill. However, recommendations such as these have been called into question by research that suggests early exposure to potential allergens does not increase the likelihood of allergies, and in some cases reduces it.

Evidence from clinical trials shows that nutrition education of family members about infant weaning practices probably has a positive effect on babies&#x27; weight and height at 12 months compared with conventional management of weaning.

No matter what age baby food is introduced, it is generally a very messy affair, as young children do not have the coordination to eat neatly. Coordination for using utensils properly and eating with dexterity takes years to develop. Many babies begin using utensils between 10 and 14 months, but most will not be able to feed themselves sufficiently well until about two or three years of age.

===Weaning conflict===
At this point, the mother tries to force the infant to cease nursing, while the infant attempts to force the mother to continue. From an evolutionary perspective, weaning conflict may be considered the result of the cost of continued nursing to the mother, perhaps in terms of reduced ability to raise future offspring, exceeding the benefits to the mother in terms of increased survival of the current infant. This can come about because future offspring will be equally related to the mother as the current infant, but will share less than 100% of the current infant&#x27;s genes. So, from the perspective of the mother&#x27;s evolutionary fitness, it makes sense for her to cease nursing the current infant as soon as the cost to future offspring exceeds the benefit to the current infant. But, assuming the current infant shares 50% of the future offspring&#x27;s genes, from the perspective of the infant&#x27;s own evolutionary fitness, it makes sense for the infant to continue nursing until the cost to future offspring exceeds twice the benefit to itself (perhaps less, depending on the number of potential future offspring). Weaning conflict has been studied for a variety of mammal species, including primates and canines.

===Age===

There are significant individual and cultural variations in regards to weaning.

Scientifically, one can ask various questions; some of the most straightforwardly empirical include:
* At what age do children self-wean?
* At what age do various societies normatively choose to wean?
* In comparison with other animals, especially similar primates, by various measures.
As there are significant ranges and skew in these numbers (some infants are never nursed, or only nursed briefly, for instance), looking at the median (half-way mark) is more useful than looking at the average.

Considering biological measures of maturity, notably investigated by Katherine Ann Dettwyler, yields a range of ages from years to 7 years as the weaning age analogous to other primates – the &quot;natural age of weaning&quot;. This depends on the measure, for example: weaning in non-human primates is often associated with eruption of permanent molars (humans: to 6 years); comparing duration of nursing to length of pregnancy (gestation time) yields a factor of about 6 in chimpanzees and gorillas (humans: months = 54 months = years); body weight may be compared to birth weight (quadrupling of birth weight yields about to years for humans; of adult weight yields 5 to 7 years for humans); and similarly for other measures.

Other studies are possible, as in psychological factors. For example, Barbara Rogoff has noted, citing a 1953 study by Whiting &amp; Child, that the most distressing time to wean a child is at 13–18 months. After this peak, weaning becomes progressively easier and less distressing for the child, with &quot;older children frequently wean[ing] themselves&quot;.

In her study of pre-war Japanese society &quot;The Chrysanthemum and the Sword&quot;, Ruth Benedict documents that Japanese children were usually not weaned until soon before a new sibling arrives.
However the government promoted eighth-month weaning which was reluctantly adopted by the middle-class in the benefit of the baby.
The factor that the Japanese meals did not include cow&#x27;s milk or special vegetables for children also favored late weaning.

==In other mammals==
In science, mice are frequently used in laboratory experiments. When breeding laboratory mice in a controlled environment, the weaning is defined as the moment when the pups are transferred out of the mothers&#x27; cage. Weaning is recommended at three to four weeks after parturition.

For pet carnivores such as dogs or cats, there are special puppy or kitten foods commercially available. Alternatively, if the pet owner feeds the parent animals home-made pet food, the young can be fed the same foods chopped into small pieces.

=== In cattle ===

Weaning in cattle can be done by many methods. Dairy calves in the United States are weaned off their mother at an average of around 7 weeks of age. Beef calves are not usually weaned off their dams until the calves are between 8 and 10 months of age. Before a calf is completely weaned off of milk, for both dairy and beef cattle, the calf must have developed a fully functioning rumen. For beef cattle, there are many methods of weaning that are used. Options include:

* traditional weaning through total separation,
* two-step weaning with the use of a nose ring or other device, and
* fenceline weaning, which physically separates the calf from its dam by a fence.

The use of these methods depends on farm management style, feed availability, condition and age of cow (dam), type of production and whether or not the calves are heifers. Results vary between farms, and methods are still being researched as studies have shown contradicting results on stress levels of calves from different methods of weaning.

Traditionally beef calves are weaned by abrupt separation, where the calves are separated from their dams and have no contact with each other, or by fence line weaning where the dam and calf have contact over a fence line. This has shown to cause high stress in both the dams and the calves. Both the dams and the young express high vocalization, reduced feed intake, reduced rumination, and an increased amount of time searching for each other as well as disrupting the social structure of the herd and of the calves. There is evidence that calves can undergo a form of depression post weaning, and have the potential to undergo illness that may need to be treated.

Two-step weaning is used to wean off beef calves from their dams over the space of a couple of weeks. With this method the calf is fitted with a nose flap that prevents suckling for a period of time, after which the calf is separated from the dam preventing contact. The nose flap does not limit the calf from performing any behaviors other than suckling; they are still able to drink and graze normally. Most research has shown that this method reduces the amount of stress that the calves endure. Studies show that prior to separation there is no change in feeding habits, social interaction to other members of the herd. Once the nose flap is removed and the calves are separated from the dams, there has been data showing less vocalization, less pacing and spent more time eating than calves that were weaned on a more traditional method.

Dairy calves are separated from their dam soon after they are born in most dairy operations. In some there is no contact between calf and cow for health related reasons, such as preventing bovine paratuberculosis (Johne&#x27;s disease). The main purpose of separating dairy cows from their calves to allow collection and selling of milk. The calves are then fed colostrum from the dam for the first few days, and then milk replacer. Dairy calves do not have ab libitum milk like beef calves. By limiting the amount of milk the calves receive it caused the calves to consume more feed which leads to faster development of the rumen. Dairy calves are usually weaned off milk early, usually at 4 to 8 weeks of age.

=== In horses ===
Weaning in horses usually takes place when the foal is 4 to 5 months old, as by this point the foal no longer needs nutrients beyond what the mare offers. Prior to weaning the foal, there is usually a creep feeder set up to allow the foal to begin consuming feed that the mare cannot access. There are two main approaches to weaning foals, abrupt and gradual weaning. Abrupt weaning is when the mare and foal are separated, usually without contact. Gradual weaning consists of the separating the mare and foal, but still with contact, but not enough contact that allows nursing to occur, and then after a period of time the mare and foal are separated not allowing contact, or, in some cases, sight of each other. Foals that are weaned by the abrupt method have shown to have higher stressful behaviors displayed. Weaning foals in groups for both methods can reduce stress in the foals.

=== In dogs ===
With dogs the puppies are slowly weaned off their mother, slowly reducing the amount of milk and care that the mother is giving to them. It generally is started when the puppies are 3–4 weeks old, and usually continues until they are 7–8 weeks old. By weaning the puppies slowly, it allows the mothers milk to dry up at a slow pace, making it less stressful for the mother.

Naturally, in the wild, the mother will begin weaning off the puppies because the puppies will start developing teeth which will irritate the mother when the puppies are suckling. This causes her to continually leave the puppies for longer periods of time, causing them to gradually be weaned off their mother. Wild dogs will also regurgitate food to transition the puppies to a new diet.

During this weaning process the puppies will learn from their litter-mates, and from their mother certain behaviors such as understanding dominance, and learning to reduce their biting habit and when to be submissive to others.

While weaning the puppies should be fed a high quality diet that will be fed to them as they grow post weaning. It may be helpful to moisten the food with water or milk replacer for the first while. By feeding the puppies this it causes the puppies to reduce how much they rely on their mother for food.

=== In rats ===
Rats that are raised in a laboratory, or are bred for selling purposes, are usually weaned at the age of 3 weeks. If the pups were left with their mother then weaning would not occur until they were older. This can have some health and behavioral benefits in the rats. The main reason that pups are weaned at 3 weeks of age is because often the mother is pregnant again, especially in a laboratory setting or if owned by a rat breeder, and therefore the pups must be weaned off the mother before the next litter is born. By doing this it will prevent trampling of the pups, as well as over crowding, which can easily occur, especially if the mother is being kept in a monogamous pairs. Generally the pups are separated by sex when weaning occurs, but are never housed alone. After weaning has begun, the pups should be fed a supplemented diet for at least a month, but can be done up to 13 weeks.

===In kittens===

Weaning kittens involves transitioning the kittens from mother&#x27;s milk to solid food. During weaning kittens gradually progress from dependence on a mother&#x27;s care to social independence. Ideally, weaning is handled entirely by the mother cat. However, if the kitten, for instance, is separated from its mother weaning may have to be done by someone.

Twenty-four hours after birth, kittens can discriminate between their mother&#x27;s teat and a foreign teat. Studies indicate that kittens have different preferences when being weaned and this is based on specific prenatal and postnatal exposure to various flavours. For example, kittens exposed to cheese flavor during pregnancy and the first week after birth oriented preferentially toward cheese-flavored chicken. The weaning process normally begins when kittens are around four weeks old, and is usually completed when they reach 8–10 weeks. It is important to remember that abrupt removal from the mother cat can have a negative effect on the kitten&#x27;s health and socialization skills. Weaning kittens should be done when the kittens reach 4 weeks old. They should be placed in a separate area for a few hours at a time to reduce their dependence on the mother&#x27;s milk and her overall presence. The kittens should be put in their own special area with a litter box, food and water bowls.

<doc id="348350" wikidata="Q359416" url="?curid=348350" title="George Hamilton (actor)">
<text>George Stevens Hamilton (born August 12, 1939) is an American actor. For his debut performance in &quot;Crime and Punishment U.S.A.&quot; (1959), Hamilton won a Golden Globe Award and was nominated for a BAFTA Award. He has received one additional BAFTA nomination and two Golden Globe nominations. 

Hamilton began his film career in 1958, and although he has a substantial body of work in film and television, he is perhaps most famous for his debonair style, perpetual suntan, and commercials for Ritz Crackers. Bo Derek wrote in her autobiography that &quot;there was an ongoing contest between John Derek and George Hamilton as to who had the most tan!&quot;

==Early life==
Hamilton was born in Memphis, Tennessee, and spent his early years with his mother, Annie Lucille Stevens (Hamilton), known as &quot;Teeny&quot; in Blytheville, Arkansas. He attended Hawthorne School in Beverly Hills, California. In 1950, his mother sent him to live with his father in the north. He briefly attended a progressive school in New York City before being sent to the Gulf Coast Military Academy in Gulfport, Mississippi.

Hamilton&#x27;s stepfathers were Carleton Hunt and Jesse Spalding; his stepmother was June Howard, with whom Hamilton said he had repeated sexual relations when he was 12, shortly after she married his father, and again when he was an adult.

==Career==
===Early appearances===
Hamilton&#x27;s first roles were in television, appearing in shows such as &quot;The Veil&quot;, (playing an Indian), &quot;The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin&quot;, &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot;, and &quot;Cimarron City&quot;. His first film role was a lead, &quot;Crime and Punishment U.S.A.&quot; (1959), directed by Denis Sanders, and &quot;Home from the Hill&quot; (1960).

===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===
MGM cast Hamilton in support of Natalie Wood and Robert Wagner in the melodrama &quot;All the Fine Young Cannibals&quot; (1960) and the beach party comedy &quot;Where the Boys Are&quot; (1960). Hamilton appeared in the lower budgeted &quot;Angel Baby&quot; (1961), a drama about an evangelist, for Allied Artists. It had minimal commercial or critical impact. The movie was the feature debut of Burt Reynolds, who recalled &quot;George was different. When I came to Hollywood, there were 175 Marlon Brandos, 2,000 Jimmy Deans, and a lot of Carroll Bakers. But nobody wanted to be David Niven, except George.&quot; Reynolds later said, &quot;if anybody could have gotten him to be&quot; as &quot;relaxed and self-deprecating on film&quot; as he was in real life &quot;he would have been the next Cary Grant.&quot;

For United Artists, Hamilton supported Lana Turner in the melodrama &quot;By Love Possessed&quot; (1961). MGM tried to change his image by putting him in the Western &quot;A Thunder of Drums&quot; (1961).

Hamilton lobbied hard for the role of the Italian husband in &quot;Light in the Piazza&quot; (1962), with Olivia de Havilland. The film lost money, but Hamilton received excellent notices. It was shot in Italy, and MGM kept Hamilton in Italy to play a role in &quot;Two Weeks in Another Town&quot; (1962). Hamilton had a part in &quot;The Victors&quot; (1963), an anti-war drama from Carl Foreman. His performance was described as &quot;excellent&quot;. Hamilton played Moss Hart in &quot;Act One&quot; (1963),

After making a cameo in &quot;Looking for Love&quot; (1964), Hamilton appeared in &quot;Your Cheatin&#x27; Heart&quot; (1964), playing Hank Williams. He went to Mexico for &quot;Viva Maria!&quot; (1965). It was directed by Louis Malle, who cast Hamilton on the strength of his performance in &quot;Two Weeks in Another Town&quot;. Malle said, &quot;he was a personal choice and I am happy with him...He&#x27;s more interested in being in the social columns—I don&#x27;t understand—when he should be one of the greatest of his generation&quot;.

Hamilton made &quot;That Man George&quot; (1965), and appeared in a production of &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; (1966) on TV. He returned to MGM to make &quot;Doctor, You&#x27;ve Got to Be Kidding!&quot; (1967), a romantic comedy with Sandra Dee, which was mildly popular. At Columbia, he co-starred with Glenn Ford in &quot;A Time for Killing&quot; (1967).

Hamilton played a cat burglar in MGM&#x27;s &quot;Jack of Diamonds&quot; (1967). It was produced by Sandy Howard, who said Hamilton was &quot;a hot commodity these days&quot; because he was dating Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s daughter. Reports put his fee around this time at $100,000 per movie. He was drafted into the Army but received a 3-A deferral notice on the grounds that he was his mother&#x27;s sole financial provider. The deferral was highly controversial because it was thought that his relationship with the president&#x27;s daughter gave him preferential treatment. In 1968, Hamilton made &quot;The Power&quot;.

===Television===
Hamilton went into television in 1969, supporting Lana Turner in the all-star series &quot;Harold Robbins&#x27; The Survivors&quot; (1969–70). When the show was canceled in January 1970, Hamilton went into &quot;Paris 7000&quot; (1970). He portrayed a trouble shooter for the U.S. State Department in Paris. This series was canceled in March 1970. He starred in the TV films &quot;Togetherness&quot; (1970) and &quot;The Last of the Powerseekers&quot;, a 1971 compilation of two episodes of &quot;Harold Robbins&#x27; The Survivors&quot;.

===Producer===
Hamilton moved into producing to give himself greater control over his career. He produced and played the title role in &quot;Evel Knievel&quot; (1971). Hamilton had the script rewritten by John Milius, and the latter called Hamilton &quot;a wonderful guy, totally underrated. A great con-man, that&#x27;s what he really is. He always said &#x27;I&#x27;ll be remembered as a third-rate actor when in fact, I&#x27;m a first-rate con man.&#x27;&quot;

He appeared in the TV movie &quot;The Last of the Powerseekers&quot; (1973), and had a supporting role in &quot;The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing&quot;, starring Burt Reynolds (1973). He produced and appeared in &quot;Medusa&quot; (1973). He starred in the TV movie &quot;The Dead Don&#x27;t Die&quot; (1975) and had a supporting role in &quot;Once Is Not Enough&quot; (1975).

On a 1975 episode of &quot;Columbo&quot;, Hamilton played a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis to commit a murder, whose arrogant assertions in his own defence establish that he was in fact at the scene of the crime. Hamilton guest-starred on episodes of &quot;Police Story&quot;, &quot;McCloud&quot;, &quot;Roots&quot;, &quot;The Eddie Capra Mysteries&quot;, &quot;Gibbsville&quot;, &quot;Supertrain&quot;, and &quot;Sword of Justice&quot;.

He had supporting roles in &quot;The Strange Possession of Mrs. Oliver&quot; (1977), &quot;The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington&quot; (1977), &quot;Killer on Board&quot; (1977), &quot;Sextette&quot; (1978), &quot;The Users&quot; (1978), &quot;From Hell to Victory&quot; (1979), &quot;Institute for Revenge&quot; (1979), and &quot;Death Car on the Freeway&quot; (1979).

===&quot;Love at First Bite&quot;===
In 1979, he appeared in the surprise hit &quot;Love at First Bite&quot;, in which he showed a flair for comedy; it was the story of Count Dracula&#x27;s pursuit of a young Manhattanite model, played by Susan Saint James. The film included scenes with Dracula and his conquest as they dance to &quot;I Love the Nightlife&quot; at a disco. The film&#x27;s box-office success created a popularity surge for Hamilton, who also served as executive producer.

He returned to TV for &quot;The Seekers&quot; (1979) and &quot;The Great Cash Giveaway Getaway&quot; (1979), then did 1981&#x27;s &quot;Zorro, The Gay Blade&quot;, which he produced. &quot;Zorro&quot; was not as popular as &quot;Love at First Bite&quot;, and film leads dried up quickly. He focused on television: &quot;Malibu&quot; (1983) and &quot;Two Fathers&#x27; Justice&quot; (1985).

In the mid-1980s, Hamilton starred in the sixth season of the Aaron Spelling-produced television serial &quot;Dynasty&quot;. He supported Joan Collins in the miniseries &quot;Monte Carlo&quot; (1986) and had the lead role in the series &quot;Spies&quot; (1987). He supported Elizabeth Taylor in &quot;Poker Alice&quot; (1987).

===1990s===
A break for Hamilton came in 1990 when Francis Ford Coppola cast him as the Corleone family&#x27;s lawyer in &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot;. For the second time, he portrayed a murderer on the television series &quot;Columbo&quot;, starring as the host of a TV true-crime show in the 1991 episode &quot;Caution: Murder Can Be Hazardous to Your Health&quot;. He had been in the 1975 episode &quot;A Deadly State of Mind&quot;. Hamilton had small roles in &quot;Doc Hollywood&quot; (1991), &quot;Once Upon a Crime&quot; (1992), and &quot;Amore!&quot; (1993), and guest-starred on &quot;&quot; and &quot;Dream On&quot;. He went to Germany to make &quot;&quot; (1993). He did &quot;Two Fathers: Justice for the Innocent&quot; (1994), &quot;Vanished&quot; (1995), and &quot;Playback&quot; (1996); and guest-starred on the shows &quot;Bonnie&quot;, &quot;Hart to Hart&quot;, and &quot;The Guilt&quot;.

He was in &quot;Meet Wally Sparks&quot; (1997), &quot;8 Heads in a Duffel Bag&quot; (1997), and the miniseries &quot;Rough Riders&quot; (1997), where he portrayed William Randolph Hearst. It was sometimes said that Hamilton resembled Warren Beatty. Beatty&#x27;s political satire &quot;Bulworth&quot; (1998) contained a running gag, with Hamilton appearing as himself. Hamilton had a regular role on the TV series &quot;Jenny&quot; (1997). He was in &quot;Casper Meets Wendy&quot; (1998), &quot;P.T. Barnum&quot; (1999), and &quot;She&#x27;s Too Tall&quot; (1999). He was a semi-regular celebrity guest on the 1998–99 syndicated version of &quot;Match Game&quot;.

===2000s===
In 2001, Hamilton starred on Broadway in the play &quot;Chicago&quot; as Billy Flynn. He played the role from November 21, 2001, to February 17, 2002; June 4 to July 29, 2002; and September 14 to October 7, 2007.

In 2003, Hamilton hosted &quot;The Family&quot;, a reality television series, for one season. The program starred 10 members from a traditional Italian-American family, each fighting for a prize of $1 million. In 2006, Hamilton competed in the second season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; with professional Edyta Sliwinska. They lasted until the sixth round. At 66 and recovering from knee injuries, Hamilton, unable to match his younger competitors&#x27; limber moves, charmed the audience and judges with silly dances that used props, including a Zorro mask and the sword from &quot;Zorro, The Gay Blade&quot;.

In 2006, it was rumored that Hamilton would replace Bob Barker on &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;. He auditioned for the show, and in March 2007, TMZ reported that Hamilton was a frontrunner to replace Barker. According to Reuters, Hamilton was one of the final three contenders to host the show, alongside Mark Steines and Todd Newton. Drew Carey was named as Barker&#x27;s successor. Hamilton has hosted the live stage adaptation of the show &quot;The Price Is Right Live!&quot; In August 2008, he co-starred in &quot;Coma&quot;, a web series on Crackle. Hamilton was executive producer of the 2009 film loosely based on his early life and relationship with his mother, &quot;My One and Only&quot;.

Hamilton was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk Of Fame on August 12, 2009. In 1999, a Golden Palm Star on the Walk of Stars was dedicated to him. Hamilton appeared as a contestant on the UK edition of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot; in November 2009. Hamilton walked out of the jungle on November 30, 2009, telling the other contestants that he wasn&#x27;t there to win but to have fun. Hamilton was considered one of the favorites to win the series. In 2010, he was chosen as one of David Hasselhoff&#x27;s roasters in the &quot;Comedy Central Roast of David Hasselhoff&quot;. Starting in 2011, Hamilton starred as Georges in the national tour of the Tony-winning revival of &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot;. He was still starring in the show .

In 2015 George and his ex-wife Alana Hamilton appeared in Season 4/Episode 10 of &quot;Celebrity Wife Swap&quot;. Alana swapped with Angela &quot;Big Ang&quot; Raiola of &quot;Mob Wives&quot; and her husband Neil Murphy. In 2016, Hamilton appeared in commercials for KFC as the &quot;Extra Crispy Colonel&quot;, a deeply tanned version of the company&#x27;s mascot Colonel Sanders, a role which he returned to in 2018. On July 6, 2018, Hamilton portrayed the Colonel on &quot;General Hospital&quot;.

==Business endeavors==
In the late 1980s, Hamilton launched the George Hamilton Skin Care System and the George Hamilton Sun Care System and tanning salons. A cigar lounge bearing his name opened in the late 1990s at the New York, New York, hotel in Las Vegas and other locations, along with a line of cigars bearing his name. A 1998 article in &quot;Cigar Aficionado&quot; called Hamilton&#x27;s style &quot;Cary Grant meets Pat Riley&quot;.

In April 2006, Hamilton served as grand marshal for the 79th Annual Shenandoah Apple Blossom Festival in Winchester, Virginia.

==Relationship with Imelda Marcos==
Hamilton had a relationship with Imelda Marcos, widow of former Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos, and had business ties to the Marcos family. In 1990, Hamilton was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in a federal fraud and racketeering case against the Marcoses involving the looting of government funds; Imelda was acquitted in the case.

==Personal life==
In 1966, Hamilton had a relationship with Lynda Bird Johnson, the daughter of U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson.

From 1972 to 1976, Hamilton was married to actress Alana Stewart. Their son, Ashley George, was born in 1974. The divorced Hamiltons reunited in the mid-1990s to co-host the daytime talk show &quot;George &amp; Alana&quot;, and again in 2015, as stars of the reality show &quot;Stewarts &amp; Hamiltons&quot;.

From 1995 to 1999, Hamilton dated Kimberly Blackford, whom he met in Fort Lauderdale when she was a swimsuit model. In December 1999, Kimberly gave birth to their son, George Thomas Hamilton (nicknamed &quot;GT&quot; or George Jr.). Hamilton never married Blackford, but they became friends again as their son got older. Hamilton and both his sons attended military schools; GT attended Admiral Farragut Academy in St. Petersburg.

As a contestant in &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity&quot; in 2009, Hamilton revealed he had dated at least four Miss Worlds. In 2019, Hamilton said he was romantically unattached but enjoyed dating different ladies.

According to Burt Reynolds&#x27;s autobiography, Hamilton has a healthy sense of humor, even when the humor is directed at him. Reynolds wrote that he made up a birthday card for Hamilton with a composite photograph of Tony Curtis and Anthony Perkins, titled &quot;To George, love from Mum and Dad&quot;. Hamilton found the card hilarious and showed it to everybody.

In 2009, he was in a comedy film, &quot;My One and Only&quot;, loosely based on a story about his early life on the road with his mother and brother. It features anecdotes that Hamilton told Merv Griffin.

<text>Paraponera clavata, commonly known as the bullet ant, is a species of ant known for its extremely painful sting. It inhabits humid lowland rainforests in Central and South America.

==Etymology==
The specific epithet of the ant, &#x27;, means &quot;club-shaped&quot;. The generic name, &quot;Paraponera&quot;, translates to &quot;near-&quot;Ponera&quot;&quot;. Because of its fearsome reputation, the ant has several Native American, Spanish, and Portuguese local names in different geographical areas; perhaps the best-known of these is the Venezuelan nickname &#x27; (the &quot;24 ant&quot; or &quot;24-hour ant&quot;), referring to the full day of pain that follows being stung; it can also refer to the time it takes to kill a human. In Brazil, the Portuguese names given by locals include &#x27;, &#x27;, or &quot;&quot; (big black ant); Native American–derived names include &quot;tocandira&quot;, and &quot;tocanquibira&quot;, from the Tupi–Guarani &quot;tuca-ndy&quot;, which translates to &quot;the one wounding deeply&quot;. Other names by which it is called include &quot;chacha&quot;, &quot;cumanagata&quot;, &quot;munuri&quot;, &quot;siámña&quot;, and &quot;yolosa&quot;. In Costa Rica, &quot;P. clavata&quot; is known as &quot;bala&quot;, meaning &quot;bullet&quot;. &quot;P. clavata&quot; also has several common names; it is most commonly known as the bullet ant because of the extreme pain it delivers following a sting, similar to that of getting shot. Other names are the &quot;lesser giant hunting ant&quot; and &quot;conga ant&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Paraponera clavata&quot; was first described by Danish zoologist Johan Christian Fabricius in 1775, who named it &quot;Formica clavata&quot; in his &quot;Systema entomologiae&quot;. Fabricius listed the type locality as India, incorrectly, as these ants are only found in Central and South America. In 1804, &quot;P. clavata&quot; was transferred to the genus &quot;Ponera&quot; by the French zoologist Pierre André Latreille. The genus &quot;Paraponera&quot; was established by the British entomologist Frederick Smith in 1858, and &quot;P. clavata&quot; was designated as the type species by monotypy (the creation of a taxonomic group that includes only a single taxon). In his book, Smith synonymised multiple taxa under &quot;Paraponera clavata&quot;, including &quot;Formica armata&quot;, &quot;Formica spininoda&quot;, &quot;Ponera tarsalis&quot;, and &quot;Ponera clavata&quot;. Later publications would also synonymise more taxa, including &quot;Formica aculeata&quot; and &quot;Formica clavata&quot;. The genus was placed in a monotypic tribe, the Paraponerini, in 1901 by the Italian entomologist Carlo Emery, who stressed the importance of certain morphological characteristics of &quot;Paraponera&quot;; Emery had also placed the tribe close to the Ectatommini. This classification was accepted by the entomological community until 1958, when the American entomologist William Brown Jr. synonymised Paraponerini and transferred &quot;Paraponera&quot; to Ectatommini. It was treated as a valid tribe in 1994, but in 2003, the English myrmecologist elevated the rank of the tribe to subfamily level as Paraponerinae, part of the Poneromorph subfamilies.

Under the present classification, the bullet ant is a member of the genus &quot;Paraponera&quot; in the tribe Paraponerini, subfamily Paraponerinae. It is a member of the family Formicidae, belonging to the order Hymenoptera. It was once the sole member of its own genus and tribe, until the extinct &quot;Paraponera dieteri&quot; was described in 1994 by the entomologist Cesare Baroni Urbani. The ant, described from Dominican amber, existed during the Early Miocene 15 to 45 million years ago. &quot;P. dieteri&quot; can be distinguished from &quot;P. clavata&quot; by its much narrower head, length, pronotum width, petiole width, and other features. The good preservation of the fossil allowed comprehensive comparisons between the two species; the body sculpture of &quot;P. dieteri&quot; suggests that the genus as a whole exhibits a slow evolutionary rate.

&quot;P. clavata&quot; is the only living species in its subfamily. Although &quot;P. dieteri&quot; was the first extinct relative of &quot;P. clavata&quot; to be described, another &quot;Paraponera&quot; fossil had been examined earlier in the 1980s. The fossil, which was from the Miocene, was found embedded in Dominican amber from Hispaniola; at the time of discovery, the ant was the largest fossil of its kind. It showed similar characteristics to &quot;P. clavata&quot;, although it was considerably smaller. The fossil also has biogeographic importance. As &quot;P. clavata&quot; is not found in the Greater Antilles, but rather in Central and South America, this suggests that moister tropical forests covered the island during the Tertiary period. This is further supported by the fact that &quot;P. clavata&quot; is a forest ant that forages on the ground and up into bushes and trees.

==Description==
Worker ants are long and resemble stout, reddish-black wingless wasps. &quot;Paraponera&quot; is predatory, and like all primitive poneromorphs, does not display polymorphism in the worker caste; the queen ant is not much larger than the workers. They are not aggressive ants but are vicious when defending the nest, they produce a stridulating sound and sting with ferocity.

==Distribution==
&quot;Paraponera&quot; is distributed throughout Central and South America, commonly found in the wet Neotropical realm. These ants are found in Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama from the north, and in Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, and Brazil from the south. Colonies are found in lowland areas, at elevations ranging from sea level to . However, specimens have been collected at elevations of in La Amistad International Park.

==Habitat==
Colonies consist of several hundred individuals and are usually situated at the bases of trees. Workers forage arboreally for small arthropods and nectar in the area directly above the nest, often as far as the upper canopy; little foraging occurs on the forest floor. Nectar, carried between the mandibles, is the most common food taken back to the nest by foragers. Two studies in Costa Rica and on Barro Colorado Island (BCI) found about four bullet ant nests per hectare of forest. On BCI, the nests were found under 70 species of trees, six species of shrubs, two species of lianas, and one species of palm. Nests were most common beneath the canopies of &quot;Faramea occidentalis&quot; and &quot;Trichilia tuberculata&quot;, but these trees are also the most abundant in the forest. Nests were present under &quot;Alseis blackiana&quot;, &quot;Tabernaemontana arborea&quot;, &quot;Virola sebifera&quot;, &quot;Guarea guidonia&quot;, and &quot;Oenocarpus mapora&quot; more frequently than would be expected from abundance of these tree species. The large number of nest plants suggests little active selection of nest sites by bullet ants. Small shrubs, however, are underused, probably because they do not provide access to the forest canopy. The study on BCI concluded that bullet ants may select trees with buttresses and extrafloral nectaries.

==Enemies==
The ant is a predator of &quot;Greta oto&quot;, the glasswing butterfly. This butterfly attempts to combat &quot;P. clavata&quot; by producing chemical extracts during the larval stage that are unpalatable to these ants.

===Parasites===
The small (1.5- to 2.0-mm-long) phorid fly &quot;Apocephalus paraponerae&quot; is a parasite of injured workers of &quot;P. clavata&quot;, of which the supply is constant because frequent aggressive encounters occur between neighbouring ant colonies, resulting in maimed workers. The flies are able to parasitise healthy ants if the ants are artificially restrained, but healthy ants are agile and able to repel them. Both male and female flies are attracted by the scent of injured ants; the females lay eggs, as well as feeding, and the males feed and possibly mate with the females. The flies are attracted to a crushed ant within two to three minutes, and 10 or more flies may be attracted to each ant. Each ant can harbour 20 fly larvae. Carl Rettenmeyer observed &quot;P. clavata&quot; actively trying to attack &quot;A. paraponerae&quot; when they approached the entrance to their nest.

==Relationship with humans==

===Sting===
The bullet ant&#x27;s sting currently ranks the highest of all insect stings on Justin O. Schmidt&#x27;s informal sting pain index, at 4.0+. According to Schmidt, the pain is like &quot;[w]alking over flaming charcoal with a three-inch nail embedded in your heel&quot;. Some victims compared the pain to that of being shot, hence the name of the insect. It is described as causing &quot;waves of burning, throbbing, all-consuming pain that continues unabated for up to 24 hours&quot;. Lymphadenopathy, edema, tachycardia, and fresh blood appearing in human victim feces are common symptoms from even a single sting. Poneratoxin, a paralyzing neurotoxic peptide isolated from the venom, affects voltage-dependent sodium ion channels and blocks the synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. It is being investigated for possible medical applications.

===Initiation rites===

The Sateré-Mawé people of Brazil use intentional bullet ant stings as part of their initiation rites to become warriors or leaders. The ants are first rendered unconscious by submersion in a natural sedative, and then 80 of them are woven into gloves (which resemble large oven mitts) made of vines or leaves, stingers facing inward. When the ants regain consciousness, an initiator repeatedly blows smoke at the ants, with the objective of making them agitated and aggressive. Once this is done, the initiate has the gloves put on his hands and keeps them on for 5 to 10 minutes or longer. Afterward, the boy&#x27;s hand and part of his arm are temporarily paralyzed because of the ant venom, and he may shake uncontrollably for days. The only &quot;protection&quot; provided is a coating of charcoal on the hands, supposedly to confuse the ants and inhibit their stinging. To fully complete the initiation, a boy or man must go through the ordeal 20 times over the course of several months or even years.

<text>Bringing Out the Dead is a 1999 American drama film directed by Martin Scorsese and written by Paul Schrader, based on the 1998 novel by Joe Connelly. It stars Nicolas Cage, Patricia Arquette, John Goodman, Ving Rhames, and Tom Sizemore. The plot depicts 48 hours in the life of a depressed New York City paramedic (Cage).

&quot;Bringing Out the Dead&quot; was released in the United States on October 22, 1999 by Paramount Pictures, while it was released internationally by Touchstone Pictures through Buena Vista International. It was the final film to be released on LaserDisc in the United States. It received generally positive reviews from critics but was a disappointment at the box office, grossing just $16 million against its $32 million production budget.

== Plot ==
In Manhattan, paramedic Frank Pierce suffers from depression, insomnia, and occupational burnout having not saved any patients in months after botching the resuscitation of Rose, a homeless teen. He has begun to hallucinate Rose&#x27;s ghost. One night, Frank and his partner Larry respond to a dispatcher&#x27;s call by the family of a Mr. Burke who has entered cardiac arrest. There, Frank befriends Burke&#x27;s distraught daughter Mary, a former drug addict, and discovers Mary was friends with Noel, a drug addict and delinquent who is frequently sent to the hospital.

After a few minor calls, Frank and Larry respond to the aftermath of a shooting, where Frank notices two vials of &quot;Red Death&quot; heroin roll out from a surviving victim&#x27;s sleeve. While in the back of the ambulance with Frank and Noel, the victim attempts to repent for his drug dealing ways but dies before they can reach the hospital.

The next day, Frank is paired with the charismatic, fervently religious Marcus. The two respond to a call to a man reported to be in cardiac arrest in a club. When they arrive, Frank diagnoses that he is, in fact, suffering from an overdose caused by Red Death. As Frank injects the man with Narcan, Marcus starts a prayer circle with the baffled club-goers, and just as his preaching climaxes, the overdosed man regains consciousness.

On the way back to the hospital, Frank visits Mary&#x27;s apartment to tell her that her father&#x27;s condition is improving. Frank and Marcus then respond to a call by a young man whose girlfriend is giving birth to twins. Frank and Marcus rush the two infants and mother to the hospital, where Marcus brings the mother and healthy twin to the maternity ward, while Frank attempts to revive the other twin with the hospital staff. The hospital is unable to revive the smaller twin, and a dismayed Frank starts drinking before Marcus joins him and crashes the ambulance into a parked car. They are unharmed and laugh the incident off.

The following morning, Frank sees Mary leaving the hospital and follows her to an apartment block; Mary tells Frank that she is visiting a friend and he escorts her to the room. After waiting a while, Frank barges in and discovers that it is a drug den run by a dealer named Cy Coates. Mary admits that she has turned back to drugs to cope with her father&#x27;s condition, and as Frank tries to get her to leave, Cy offers him some pills.

In a moment of desperation, Frank takes the drugs and begins to hallucinate, seeing more ghosts of his patients. Once sober, he grabs Mary and carries her out of the building. While visiting a comatose Burke in the hospital, Frank starts hearing Burke&#x27;s voice in his head, telling Frank to let him die, but he resuscitates Burke instead.

In his third shift, Frank is paired with Tom Wolls, a fervent and messianic man with violent tendencies. The pair respond to a call to Cy&#x27;s drug den where a shooting has occurred, and find Cy impaled on a railing. Frank holds onto Cy as emergency services cut the railing but both are nearly flung off the edge before being pulled back up. Cy then thanks Frank for saving his life and becomes the first patient Frank has saved in months.

Afterward, Frank agrees to help Tom beat up Noel, and chase him down. Frank starts to hallucinate again, snapping out of it just as he comes upon Tom beating Noel with a baseball bat. Frank saves Noel. As Frank visits Burke again, the voice pleads for death once more, and Frank removes Burke&#x27;s breathing apparatus, causing him to fatally enter cardiac arrest. Frank then heads to Mary&#x27;s apartment to inform her that he died. He hallucinates Rose&#x27;s ghost for a final time, obtaining her forgiveness. Mary accepts her father&#x27;s death. Frank is invited in and falls asleep with Mary.

== Reception ==
=== Critical response ===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Bringing Out the Dead&quot; has an approval rating of 74% based on 117 reviews, with an average rating of 6.7/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Stunning and compelling, Scorsese and Cage succeed at satisfying the audience.&quot; Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 70 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave it a perfect four-star rating, writing, &quot;To look at &quot;Bringing Out the Dead&quot;—to look, indeed, at almost any Scorsese film—is to be reminded that film can touch us urgently and deeply.&quot; Years later, Scorsese reflected to Ebert that &quot;Bringing Out the Dead&quot; &quot;failed at the box office, and was rejected by a lot of the critics.&quot; Yet he added: &quot;I had 10 years of ambulances. My parents, in and out of hospitals. Calls in the middle of the night. I was exorcising all of that. Those city paramedics are heroes -- and saints, they&#x27;re saints. I grew up next to the Bowery, watching the people who worked there, the Salvation Army, Dorothy Day&#x27;s Catholic Worker Movement, all helping the lost souls. They&#x27;re the same sort of people.&quot;

Thelma Schoonmaker, the editor, praised the movie and said: &quot;It&#x27;s the only one of [Scorsese&#x27;s] films, I think, that hasn&#x27;t gotten its due. It&#x27;s a beautiful film, but it was hard for people to take, I think. Unexpected. But I think it&#x27;s great.&quot; She claims that the film initially was mis-marketed as a car-chase film: &quot;What happened was, that film was about compassion, and it was sold, I think, as a car chase movie. When I saw the trailer I said, &#x27;Wait a minute! That&#x27;s not what the movie&#x27;s about!&#x27; I think people were made nervous by the theme of it, which I think is beautiful. I think it&#x27;ll get its due.&quot;

In 2022, Nicolas Cage singled out &quot;Bringing Out the Dead&quot; as one of the best movies he ever made.

=== Box office ===
&quot;Bringing Out the Dead&quot; debuted at #4 in 1,936 theatres with a weekend gross of $6,193,052. The film grossed $16.7 million against a production budget of $32 million, making it a box office bomb.

<text>Theodore &quot;Fats&quot; Navarro (September 24, 1923 – July 7, 1950) was an American jazz trumpet player and a pioneer of the bebop style of jazz improvisation in the 1940s. A native of Key West, Florida, he toured with big bands before achieving fame as a bebop trumpeter in New York. Following a series of studio sessions with leading bebop figures including Tadd Dameron, Bud Powell, and Kenny Clarke, he became ill with tuberculosis and died at the age of 26. Despite the short duration of his career, he had a strong stylistic influence on trumpet players who rose to fame in later decades, including Clifford Brown and Lee Morgan.

==Early life==
Navarro was born in Key West, Florida and was of Cuban, African, and Chinese descent. He was bilingual, speaking Spanish as his second language, and he was a childhood friend of drummer Al Dreares. Navarro&#x27;s father, a barber by trade, had some musical knowledge and hired a piano teacher to give Navarro private lessons in his early childhood. Hence, the younger Navarro began to play piano at age six, although he did not become serious about music until he began playing trumpet at the age of thirteen. Additionally, he mastered the tenor saxophone and played both trumpet and tenor saxophone professionally during the earliest years of his career.

By the time Navarro graduated from Frederick Douglass School in 1941, he wanted to be away from Key West and moved north to Orlando to join Sol Allbright&#x27;s band. As a member, Navarro was able to tour the Midwest, reaching Cincinnati before he left to take lessons.

== Career ==

=== 1941–1946: Touring with big bands ===
Now living permanently in the Midwest, Navarro joined Snookum Russell&#x27;s territory band. He gained valuable experience touring in bands, including Russell&#x27;s band, where he met and influenced a young J.J. Johnson. Navarro also played in the Andy Kirk, Benny Goodman, and Lionel Hampton big bands.

Vocalist Billy Eckstine invited the young trumpet player to join his band, which included several prominent musicians in the emerging bebop genre. Although Eckstine&#x27;s group and other big bands yielded few opportunities for Navarro to demonstrate his improvisational skills, he used the opportunity to gain experience. He befriended other trumpet players including Howard McGhee and his third cousin Charlie Shavers.

Navarro made his last recordings with Kirk and Eckstine in January and March 1946, respectively. Regarding Navarro&#x27;s presence in the big bands of the day, Carmen McRae noted in her book that Navarro &quot;was a big, lovable character, playing the most beautiful horn, forever practicing and forever striving. He and I used to discuss the way the cats were using the stuff [narcotics], and he said he’d never do it.”

=== 1946–1948: Transition to bebop ===
Tiring of life on the road, Navarro settled in New York City in 1946, where his career took off. Navarro participated in small group recording sessions with Kenny Clarke, Eddie &quot;Lockjaw&quot; Davis, Coleman Hawkins, Illinois Jacquet, and Howard McGhee. Clarke&#x27;s 52nd Street Boys, also known as the Be Bop Boys, recorded at the studio in September 1946 and 1947 and included another young bebop trumpet player, Kenny Dorham, and were joined by Sonny Stitt on alto saxophone and Bud Powell on piano. The September sessions, in which Navarro participated, were among his first opportunities to play bebop in a studio session and the group&#x27;s work later formed part of the album &quot;Fats Bud-Klook-Sonny-Kinney&quot;.

Navarro met and played with Charlie Parker. However, he was in a position to demand a high salary and did not join one of Parker&#x27;s regular groups. He instead joined pianist Tadd Dameron&#x27;s group based at the Royal Roost jazz club in New York. A recording with this group for Blue Note included Ernie Henry on alto saxophone and Charlie Rouse on tenor, both of whom contributed significantly to bebop in the 1940s and 1950s.

Dameron went to great lengths to accommodate Navarro&#x27;s position in the band, but the trumpeter&#x27;s continued demands for higher pay ultimately led him to form his own group for studio sessions. Navarro preferred the financial security of being a band member over being a bandleader.

Navarro won the Metronome Jazz Poll in 1948, enabling him to join the Metronome Jazz All-Stars for a studio session. In addition to regular studio recording, in the late 1940s Navarro began to compose, and many of his tunes were dedicated to Dameron&#x27;s band, in which he continued to play on occasion. Navarro reunited with McGhee in late 1948 for yet another recording session, this time including Milt Jackson on his second instrument, the piano.

By the late forties, many jazz musicians refused to play in bands with Navarro for fear of being overshadowed by the trumpeter. Although Dizzy Gillespie described Navarro&#x27;s personality as &quot;sweet,&quot; at jam sessions he feuded often with Bud Powell and on one occasion attacked the pianist with his trumpet, but missed.

=== 1948–1950: Tuberculosis ===
He once again began touring in 1948, this time with Lionel Hampton&#x27;s band. While on the group&#x27;s tour bus on route to Chicago, Navarro fell ill and decided to return to New York. His illness proved to be tuberculosis, but he continued to play despite declining health. His continued narcotics use hastened the progression of the disease.

Navarro toured with Jazz at the Philharmonic in early 1949. He appeared on two studio sessions that year: with Bud Powell for &quot;The Amazing Bud Powell, Vol. 1&quot; in August and with tenor saxophone player Don Lanphere in September for a few sides. Powell&#x27;s session was notable for the presence of tenor saxophone player Sonny Rollins, who was only 18 years old at the time of recording. The quintet, known on record as &quot;Bud Powell&#x27;s Modernists,&quot; recorded three of Powell&#x27;s tunes and the jazz standard &quot;52nd Street Theme&quot; written by Thelonious Monk.

The Lanphere date proved one of the few times Navarro would record with pianist Al Haig and drummer Max Roach. Navarro performed on live recordings twice at Birdland prior to his death, but the dates of those performances are disputed; what is certain is that both were recorded in 1950, and that they included Parker and Miles Davis respectively. One of them was released as the album &quot;One Night in Birdland&quot; and starred Charlie Parker on alto saxophone and Powell on piano.

== Death ==
Navarro, nicknamed &quot;Fat Girl&quot; due to his weight and high speaking voice, developed a heroin addiction, tuberculosis, and a weight problem. These afflictions led to a slow decline in health. Navarro was hospitalized on July 1, 1950, and he died five days later on July 7 at the age of 26. His last performance was with Charlie Parker at Birdland.

Navarro died of tuberculosis in New York City on July 6, 1950, and was survived by wife Rena (née Clark, 1927–1975) and his daughter Linda (1949–2014). He was buried in an unmarked grave, number 414, at the Rose Hill Cemetery in Linden, New Jersey.

== Legacy ==
In 1982, Navarro was inducted into the &quot;DownBeat&quot; Hall of Fame.

In September 2002, friends and family members dedicated a headstone for Fats Navarro&#x27;s grave. The event of dedication was sponsored by the Jazz Alliance International while the day of it was proclaimed as Fats Navarro Day by the mayor of Linden.

During the ceremony, Linden High School Choir performed &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;, while trumpeter Jon Faddis played Navarro&#x27;s &quot;Nostalgia&quot;. The night of the same day, 14 trumpeters joined a stellar rhythm section to honor the Navarro songbook at the Jazz Standard in Manhattan. Faddis, who assembled the section under musical direction from Don Sickler, was accompanied by drummer Billy Drummond, bassist Peter Washington, and pianist James Williams.

<text>A seminary, school of theology, theological college, or divinity school is an educational institution for educating students (sometimes called seminarians) in scripture and theology, generally to prepare them for ordination to serve as clergy, in academics, or mostly in Christian ministry.

The English word is taken from , translated as &#x27;seed-bed&#x27;, an image taken from the Council of Trent document which called for the first modern seminaries.

In the United States, the term is currently used for graduate-level theological institutions, but historically it was used for high schools.

==History==
The establishment of seminaries in modern times resulted from Roman Catholic reforms of the Counter-Reformation after the Council of Trent. These Tridentine seminaries placed great emphasis on spiritual formation and personal discipline as well as the study, first of philosophy as a base, and, then, as the final crown, theology. The oldest Catholic seminary in the United States is St. Mary&#x27;s Seminary and University in Baltimore founded in 1791. In the United States, Protestant institutions also widely adopted the term &#x27;seminary&#x27; for independent graduate schools (separate from a university) to train their ministers. The oldest such Protestant seminary in the United States was founded in Andover, Massachusetts, in 1807 as the Andover Theological Seminary and was affiliated with the Congregationalist Church. After two mergers and a number of relocations, Andover is now part of the Yale Divinity School, in New Haven, Connecticut.

==Roman Catholicism==
General guidelines for seminary formation are set out in the governing document as of 2016 is &quot;Ratio Fundamentalis Institutionis Sacerdotalis&quot;, 1992&#x27;s &quot;Pastores dabo vobis&quot;, and the &quot;Code of Canon Law&quot;. Seminaries are overseen by regional conferences of bishops. In the United States, the governing document is &quot;Program of Priestly Formation: in the United States of America (6th Ed.)&quot;, published by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops in 2022.

Seminaries in the Catholic Church are divided into minor seminaries for teenagers and major seminaries for adults, including both college seminaries, sometimes also known as minor seminaries, for undergraduate students and post-graduate seminaries for those who already have a bachelor&#x27;s degree. There are also seminaries for older adults who are well out of school, such as the Sacred Heart Seminary and School of Theology in Wisconsin, and for other more specialized purposes.

All seminaries are run either by religious orders or by dioceses or other similar structures. Often a seminary will train both that particular order&#x27;s or diocese&#x27;s priests and the priests of other orders or dioceses that select that particular seminary for its priests. For instance, Saint John&#x27;s Seminary in Boston, Massachusetts trains priests for many of the other dioceses in New England which are suffragan dioceses of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston. Either way, a man who seeks to enter a seminary to become a priest must be sponsored by either a diocese or by a religious order.

Often a diocese might be attached to or affiliated with a larger Catholic college or university so that the larger college and its faculty provides more general education in history or theology while the seminary focuses on topics specific to the needs of future priests, such as training in canon law, the sacraments, and preaching, or specific to the particular order or diocese. For instance the Theological College in Washington, D.C., is part of The Catholic University of America.

Further, in Rome there are several seminaries which educate seminarians or already ordained priests and bishops and which are maintained by orders or dioceses from outside of Italy. Many countries have their own pontifical seminary in Italy, usually very close to the Vatican. For instance, the Pontifical North American College, which trains priests from the United States and elsewhere, is supported by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. These colleges usually award degrees to seminarians and priests pursuing further education and specializing in specific fields such as Scripture, hagiography, moral theology, or Canon Law, among countless others. In addition to civil degrees, these pontifical seminaries confer ecclesiastical degrees (Baccalaureate of Sacred Theology, Licentiate of Sacred Theology, and Doctorate of Sacred Theology), which are backed by the Holy See. Only some Catholic universities may bestow these degrees; these are called ecclesiastical or pontifical universities. The only pontifical &quot;seminary&quot; outside of Italy is the Pontifical College Josephinum, in Columbus, Ohio.

As outlined by the &quot;Ratio&quot;, Catholic seminary formation is composed of four major components, or dimensions: human, spiritual, intellectual and pastoral. The human dimension focuses on the seminarian&#x27;s ability to relate to others, show etiquette, and care for himself (in what he eats, frequency of exercise, healthcare, etc.). The spiritual dimension aids the seminarian in becoming more responsive to God and forming a habit of prayer throughout the day. It also emphasizes the importance of the Sacraments and liturgy. The intellectual dimension consists of academic classes, usually beginning with a college degree, usually a Bachelor of Arts or a Bachelor of Philosophy, and terminating in a higher degree, such as a Master of Arts in Theology or a Master of Divinity. The pastoral dimension helps to develop pastoral familiarity with situations such as bedside manner, marriage, and life in the parish.

For Catholic seminarians, seminary formation can be divided into four distinct stages of formation.
# Propaedeutic Stage: the seminarian primarily grows in prayer and his relationship with God, study of Scripture, and Church teaching. He also significantly grows in the human dimension. This stage lasts from 12 months to three years and can be compared in many ways to a postulant in religious life.
# Discipleship Stage: the seminarian begins his academic studies and continues to follow Christ as a disciple. If he entered out of high school, he usually pursues the Bachelor of Arts, which takes four years. If he did some college, he pursues the same degree, but it may take less time. If he already achieved a college degree, he pursues a two-year Bachelor of Philosophy.
# Configuration Stage: the seminarian becomes configured to Christ. At this point, he has a regular habit of prayer. Focus in formation becomes more and more pastoral, as he gets closer to ordination. At the beginning of this stage, he receives candidacy (similar to Tonsure), which means he is expected to eventually be ordained. The seminarian may (depending on his region) begin wearing clerical attire. This stage usually lasts three to four years and ends in master&#x27;s degree.
# Vocational Synthesis Stage: the seminarian is ordained. He becomes a deacon and transitions into parish life for a period of at least six months. He becomes a priest thereafter, usually becoming a parochial vicar before becoming a pastor.

==Protestantism==
The Dallas Theological Seminary (DTS) is an evangelical theological seminary in Dallas, Texas. It is known for popularizing the theological system of dispensationalism. DTS has campuses in Dallas, Houston, and Washington, D.C., as well as extension sites in Atlanta, Austin, San Antonio, Nashville, Northwest Arkansas, Europe, and Guatemala, and a multilingual online education program. DTS is the largest non-denominational seminary accredited by the Association of Theological Schools.

DTS was founded as &quot;Evangelical Theological College&quot; in 1924 by Rollin T. Chafer and his brother, Lewis Sperry Chafer, who taught the first class of thirteen students, and William Henry Griffith Thomas, who was to have been the school&#x27;s first theology professor but died before the first classes began. Their vision was a school where expository Bible preaching was taught simply, and under Chafers&#x27; leadership, DTS pioneered one of the first four-year degrees in theology, the Master of Theology (Th.M.). The present location of the school was purchased in 1926 and Doctor of Theology (Th.D.) program was started in 1927. Chafer remained president until his death in 1952.

The seminary had a considerable influence in the fundamentalist movement by training students who established various Bible Colleges and independent fundamentalist churches in the southern United States.

The International Council for Evangelical Theological Education was founded in 1980 by the Theological Commission of the World Evangelical Alliance. In 2015, it would have 1,000 member schools in 113 countries.

==Other uses of the term==
In some countries, the term &quot;seminary&quot; is also used for secular schools of higher education that train teachers; in the nineteenth century, many female seminaries were established in the United States.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) hosts seminary classes for high school students ages 14 to 18, as part of the Church Educational System. Unlike use in other religious contexts, the word &quot;seminary&quot;, in an LDS Church context, does not refer to a higher education program designed to train students that they may obtain a church-based career. LDS seminary students do not get high school credit for their seminary studies.

<text>Bitzi was a website, operating from 2001 to 2013, where volunteers shared reports about any kind of digital file, with identifying metadata, commentary, and other ratings.

Information contributed and rated by volunteers was compiled into the &quot;Bitpedia&quot; data set and reference work, described by Bitzi as a &quot;digital media encyclopedia&quot;. The Bitpedia was published through the Bitzi website and web services under an open content license (Creative Commons Attribution - Share Alike 2.0).

Bitzi&#x27;s standards and services have been adopted by a number of popular peer-to-peer file sharing systems. Bitzi was sponsored by a metadata publishing company of the same name based in San Francisco.

==History==
Founded by Gordon Mohr with Mike Linksvayer, the Bitzi service launched in 2001.

The Bitzi website shut down on 31 December 2013.

==Technology==

At Bitzi, files were identified by applying a strong hash function to their contents, which gives a distinct &quot;fingerprint&quot; for each file. Bitzi named the combination of standard hash functions used by its system &quot;bitprints.&quot; An open source downloadable tool, the &quot;Bitcollider&quot;, calculates file hashes and extracts intrinsic metadata from common media file types to assist user contributions. 

Bitzi cross-referenced multiple Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) for files, primarily URIs used by peer-to-peer file-sharing networks and/or clients:

* sha1:/magnet: (Gnutella)
* (Grokster)
* tree:tiger: (DC++, Shareaza).
* ed2k: (eDonkey2000, eMule, OverNet)

Other file-specific metadata was also collected, such as file size, alternate filenames, audio/video encoding details, user ratings, and free-form comments or descriptions. Users could displace flawed information with new contributions.

Data about specific files can also be programmatically retrieved via a REST-style XML Web Services.

==Relationship to peer-to-peer networks==

Bitzi originated several popular standards in the peer-to-peer file sharing sphere, including the Magnet URI scheme and Tiger tree hashes.

Many peer-to-peer file sharing programs, including LimeWire/Frostwire, older Bearshare versions, and older Shareaza versions, offered an option to look up local files or network search results at Bitzi for more information about their contents or quality.

As peer-to-peer file sharing networks often have mislabeled or corrupt files, Bitzi can sometimes provide additional confidence that a file is as expected, before a user begins a long download. In such a role, Bitzi served to ameliorate some common attacks on peer-to-peer networks.

<doc id="348364" wikidata="Q866207" url="?curid=348364" title="The Neptunes">
<text>The Neptunes were an American record production duo composed of Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo, formed in Virginia Beach, Virginia, in 1992. Williams often provided backing vocals and music video appearances on the duo&#x27;s productions, while Hugo remained behind the scenes.

Since their inception, the Neptunes have produced songs for several music industry artists, including Clipse, Beyoncé, Jay-Z, Kelis, N.O.R.E., Britney Spears, Justin Timberlake, Nelly, Ludacris, T.I., Robin Thicke, Gwen Stefani, and Snoop Dogg, among others. In 2009, &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked the Neptunes number one on their list of the top 10 producers of the decade. In January 2020, the Neptunes were announced to be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame as a part of the 2020 class, and in May 2021, Hugo and Williams received Honorary Doctorates from Berklee College of Music and Boston Conservatory at Berklee.

== History ==
Williams and Hugo met at a summer camp for the school of the Gifted and Talented in Virginia Beach, Virginia, where Williams played drums and Hugo played tenor saxophone. Upon entering a local talent contest in 1991, the Neptunes were competing with childhood friends Missy Elliott, Timbaland &amp; Magoo, which led to the duo to be discovered by record producer Teddy Riley, whose studio was close to Williams&#x27; school. Through working with Riley, the Neptunes wrote Wreckx-n-Effect&#x27;s 1992 song &quot;Rump Shaker&quot; while still in school. They also worked with Riley&#x27;s group Blackstreet, co-writing the single &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot; from their self-titled debut album.

In 1998, the Neptunes produced New York City-based rapper Noreaga&#x27;s single &quot;Superthug&quot;. They also produced Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard&#x27;s 1999 single &quot;Got Your Money&quot; featuring singer Kelis, for whom they would entirely produce her debut studio album, &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; (1999), and her 2001 album &quot;Wanderland&quot;. The Neptunes produced hip-hop duo Clipse&#x27;s album, &quot;Exclusive Audio Footage&quot; (1999), which was intended to be Clipse&#x27;s debut album before eventually being shelved. In 2000, the Neptunes produced Jay-Z&#x27;s single &quot;I Just Wanna Love U (Give It 2 Me)&quot; from his fifth studio album, &quot;The Dynasty: Roc La Familia&quot;, and Mystikal&#x27;s &quot;Shake Ya Ass&quot;, from his fourth studio album, &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Ready&quot;. In addition, The Neptunes produced Cuban Link&#x27;s single &quot;Still Telling Lies&quot; from Cuban&#x27;s 24K album. They also co-wrote the hook to &quot;Play How You Want&quot; featuring P!nk.

In 2001, N.E.R.D. released their debut studio album, &quot;In Search of...&quot;, featuring production from the Neptunes. In the same year, the Neptunes gained their first worldwide hit with Britney Spears&#x27; single, &quot;I&#x27;m a Slave 4 U&quot;, for her eponymous third studio album, &quot;Britney&quot;.

The Neptunes wrote and produced NSYNC&#x27;s final single, &quot;Girlfriend&quot;, then wrote and produced most of co-lead singer Justin Timberlake&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;Justified&quot; (2002), including lead singles &quot;Like I Love You&quot;, &quot;Rock Your Body&quot;, and &quot;Señorita&quot;.

In 2003, the Neptunes released a compilation album, &quot;Clones&quot;, featuring songs and remixes from various Star Trak artists. The Neptunes won &quot;Producer of the Year&quot; at the 2004 Grammy Awards.

In 2024, Hugo filed a legal action against Williams over the trademarks for the production duo&#x27;s name. Williams subsequently confirmed the duo were no longer on speaking terms.

<text>Eli &quot;Lucky&quot; Thompson (June 16, 1924 – July 30, 2005) was an American jazz tenor and soprano saxophonist whose playing combined elements of swing and bebop. Although John Coltrane usually receives the most credit for bringing the soprano saxophone out of obsolescence in the early 1960s, Thompson (along with Steve Lacy) embraced the instrument earlier than Coltrane.

== Early life ==
Thompson was born in Columbia, South Carolina and moved to Detroit, Michigan during his childhood. Thompson had to raise his siblings after his mother died, and he practiced saxophone fingerings on a broom handle before acquiring his first instrument. He joined Erskine Hawkins&#x27; band in 1942 upon graduating from Cass Technical High School.

== Career ==
After playing with the swing orchestras of Lionel Hampton, Don Redman, Billy Eckstine (alongside Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker), Lucky Millinder, and Count Basie, he worked in rhythm and blues and then established a career in bebop and hard bop, working with Kenny Clarke, Miles Davis, Gillespie and Milt Jackson.

Ben Ratliff observed that Thompson &quot;connected the swing era to the more cerebral and complex bebop style. His sophisticated, harmonically abstract approach to the tenor saxophone built off that of Don Byas and Coleman Hawkins; he played with beboppers, but resisted Charlie Parker&#x27;s pervasive influence.&quot; He showed these capabilities as sideman on many albums recorded during the mid-1950s, such as Stan Kenton&#x27;s &quot;Cuban Fire!&quot;, and those under his own name. He recorded with Parker (on two Los Angeles Dial Records sessions) and on Miles Davis&#x27;s hard bop &quot;Walkin&#x27;&quot; session. Thompson recorded albums as leader for Disques Vogue (in Paris), ABC Paramount and Prestige and as a sideman on records for Savoy Records with Jackson as leader.

Thompson was strongly critical of the music business, later describing promoters, music producers and record companies as &quot;parasites&quot; or &quot;vultures&quot;. This, in part, led him to move to Paris, where he lived and made several recordings between 1957 and 1962. During this time, he began playing soprano saxophone.

Thompson returned to New York, then lived in Lausanne, Switzerland, from 1968 until 1970, and recorded several albums there including &quot;A Lucky Songbook in Europe&quot;. He taught at Dartmouth College in 1973 and 1974, then completely left the music business.

== Later life ==
Thompson&#x27;s whereabouts after the mid-1970s are unclear; he is believed to have lived briefly on Manitoulin Island in Canada and in Savannah, Georgia.

In his last years, he lived in Seattle, Washington. Acquaintances reported that Thompson was homeless by the early 1990s, and lived as a hermit.

Thompson died from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in an assisted living facility on July 30, 2005.

== Family ==
Thompson was married to Thelma Thompson, who died in 1963. Thompson&#x27;s son, guitarist Daryl Thompson, played with Peter Tosh and Black Uhuru before embarking on a jazz career in the late 1980s. Thompson also had a daughter, Jade Thompson-Fredericks, and two grandchildren.

<text>The Book of Cerne (Cambridge, Cambridge University Library, MS Ll. 1. 10) is an early ninth-century Insular or Anglo-Saxon Latin personal prayer book with Old English components. It belongs to a group of four such early prayer books, the others being the Royal Prayerbook, the Harleian prayerbook, and the Book of Nunnaminster. It is now commonly believed to have been produced sometime between ca. 820 and 840 AD in the Southumbrian/Mercian region of England. The original book contains a collection of several different texts, including New Testament Gospel excerpts, a selection of prayers and hymns with a version of the &quot;Lorica of Laidcenn&quot;, an abbreviated or &quot;Breviate Psalter&quot;, and a text of the &quot;Harrowing of Hell&quot; liturgical drama, which were combined to provide a source used for private devotion and contemplation. Based on stylistic and palaeographical features, the Book of Cerne has been included within the Canterbury or Tiberius group of manuscripts that were manufactured in southern England in the 8th and 9th centuries AD associated with the Mercian hegemony in Anglo-Saxon England. This Anglo-Saxon manuscript is considered to be the most sophisticated and elaborate of this group. The Book of Cerne exhibits various Irish/Celtic, Anglo-Saxon, Continental, and Mediterranean influences in its texts, ornamentation, and embellishment.

Recent research of this manuscript by Michelle P. Brown suggests that the various Anglo-Saxon component sections of this book are conceptually inter-related and primarily associated with the doctrine of the Communion of Saints (&quot;communio sanctorum&quot;). This doctrine is found in the Ninth Article of the Apostles&#x27; Creed (&quot;Symbolum Apostolorum&quot;) and is based on the spiritual union between each Christian, living and dead, and Christ, and between each other Christian, which ultimately derives its origins in the &quot;vita apostolica&quot; and the inter-relationships or fellowship of the Early Christian congregations. This doctrine is found in the Anglo-Saxon Creed dating to the 9th century. However, in addition to the doctrine of the Communion of Saints, other themes are embedded in the texts and images that include a penitential and Paschal element that emphasizes baptism and communion (Eucharist), as well as notions of forgiveness and salvation.

==Manuscript Organization and Contents==

===Contents and Organization===
The original early medieval Anglo-Saxon &quot;core&quot; of this codex is composed of six different, but conceptually inter-related sections or texts. In collational sequence, these sections are:

====An Old English Exhortation to Prayer on folio 2 recto (r)====
Written in an Old English dialect, presumably Mercian, this text was to introduce the reader of this book to the main purpose of the following devotional texts. According to Brown the purpose of this exhortation was to emphasize the unity of the Communion of Saints in the form of the Roman Church on earth and in heaven. This introductory exhortation prayer is considered to be the earliest known extent example of Old English prose.

====The New Testament Gospel Extracts on folios 2 verso (v) to 40r====
This section is composed of extracts of the Passion and Resurrection narratives from the four Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Kuypers noted that these extracts were from a Vulgate text with some anomalies or peculiarities. They do have some affinities to Celtic Gospel books, but with corrections. A full-page polychrome evangelist miniature with Latin inscriptions precedes each Gospel text (see below).

====An Acrostic Poem on folio 21r====
This consists of a poem written in Latin with each line written in different alternating colored inks of red, purple, blue, and orange. This poem names Ædeluald Bishop (&quot;&quot;Aedeluald episcopus&quot;). It seems that this poem was placed to fill in a blank page caused by a scribal miscalculation.

====A series of Prayers and Hymns on folios 43r to 87v====
These seventy-one prayers and hymns, including the &quot;Lorica of Laidcenn&quot; (folios 43r-44v) were written in Latin, with Old English glosses. Thirteen prayers (Numbers 7, 10, 16, 26, 31–32, 63, 67–68, 70, and 72–74) exhibit Irish influences, seven prayers (Numbers 18–19, 53–54, 61–62, and 66) contain apocryphal content, and Marian devotion is found in six (Numbers 1, 15, 18, and 56–58) prayers.

====A &quot;Breviate Psalter&quot; on folios 87v to 98r====
This section is composed of a selection of abbreviated Old Testament Psalm verses that are so ordered as to form a continuous prayer. The Book of Cerne only contains 272 verses, not the full 365 verses that are commonly found in these early Psalters. Psalms 118 to 136 are missing from this book, which may be due to errors in the exemplar from which it was copied, or these missing verses may not have suited the scribe&#x27;s or patron&#x27;s intentions. This form of abridged Psalm verses may suggest Irish influences, however, the Psalm texts used are from the Old Latin Romanum Psalter version, which supports the inference for an Anglo-Saxon composition. This section is introduced by a rubric in Latin &quot;hoc argumentum forsorum [sic. versorum] oeðelpald episcopus decrepsit&quot;&quot; (&quot;Bishop Ædeluald has worn out these lines of proof&quot;).

====The &quot;Harrowing of Hell&quot; text on folios 98v to 99v====
The text of this liturgical drama is in a form of an apocryphal dialogue between the narrator, Adam, and Eve, with a choir/chorus that is indicated in the text by alternating black and red inks. This extra New Testament story tells of when Jesus went into Hell between the Crucifixion of Jesus and his resurrection for the salvation of all the righteous who had died since the beginning of the world. However, the existing text may be incomplete with its ending now lost. According to Dumville this liturgical drama seems to be one of the earliest known examples of this text, influenced by the text of the &quot;Descensus ad Infernos&quot; found in the Latin version of the extra New Testament &quot;Gospel of Nicodemus&quot;, as well as a now lost Latin pseudo-Augustinian homily that has survived in an Old English version found in the &quot;Blickling Homilies&quot; (Princeton, Princeton University Library, W.H. Schelde Collection, Blickling Homilies), and the Roman Psalter. There is a conceptual or compositional relationship between this section and the preceding &quot;Breviate Psalter&quot; verses, as this &quot;Harrowing of Hell&quot; is a pastiche of verses from the Psalms. An Irish influence is suggested by the metrical structure of the hymns as well as the inclusion of the &quot;Breviate Psalter&quot;.

===Later Accretions===
This early medieval core is sandwiched between two later sets of accretions dating from the 14th to the early 16th century AD that relate to the Benedictine Cerne Abbey in Dorset, and have provided this codex with its current name. The top set of accretions preceding the core is composed of 26 leaves containing between forty and fifty charters pertaining to the Abbey at Cerne Abbas and a prayer attributed to St. Augustine that date to the 14th century. The bottom set of accretions following the core is composed of 28 leaves that include a text of the &quot;De Beata Maria&quot; and an inventory of the relics contained within the abbey dating between the 14th century and the early 16th century (pre-Dissolution).

==Script==
The basic script in the Book of Cerne uses a Southumbrian/Mercian pointed minuscule that is consistent with Phase II Minuscule type identified by T.J. Brown. Throughout the original ninth century Anglo-Saxon texts there is little variation seen in the relatively high quality script, conforming to a &quot;cursive media&quot; grade script or basic cursive minuscule lettering. Although minuscule letters are found throughout the majority of the text, there are variant examples that were used on higher grade letters, such as capitals, uncials, and half-uncials, that are occasionally embedded within the text to emphasize certain points, such as indicating punctuation marks to emphasize pauses. Based on the palaeographical evidence in this codex, it is inferred that only a single scribe was involved in the writing of the original Anglo-Saxon text.

==Illumination and Decoration==
This manuscript was decorated and embellished with four painted full-page miniatures, major and minor letters, continuing panels, and litterae notibiliores. The ornamental elements include zoomorphic/animal, floral, interlace, and curvilinear motifs and designs. The color palette employed by the artist/illuminator consisted of pigments of gold, purple, blues, red, red/brown, yellow, green, white, and black. The pigment binding medium was clarified egg white or clarea.

===The Evangelist Miniatures===
In the Book of Cerne the illuminations of the four evangelists precede each Gospel section containing the selected extracts from Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. These miniatures are found on the verso (v) sides of folios 2 (Matthew), 12 (Mark), 21 (Luke), and 31 (John). All four illuminations are consistent using the same format, but with nuanced variations that help to visually discern and introduce each Gospel section. The miniatures exhibit a more linear figural style. In the top center set within a circular medallion or roundel is a partial frontal human bust of the Evangelist who is beardless and has a halo or nimbus. He holds his Gospel book in his left hand, while the right hand is variable in each image. This medallion is located at the apex of an arched frame that is supported by two verticals or columns with capitals. These rest on or without a base on a bottom horizontal floor. Each set of capitals in these illuminations is different from each other. Set within the arch is a full-length figure is the particular tetramorph beast symbol of each particular Evangelist – Human/Angel (Matthew), Lion (Mark), Ox/Calf (Luke), and Eagle (John) – inspired by the vision found in the Old Testament Book of Ezekiel 1.10. All four evangelical beast symbols are all winged and haloed or nimbed, and each beast symbol holds a book in its fore or hind limbs. Each miniature is also accompanied by a set of two Latin inscriptions written in capital letters, one at the top flanking the human bust and the other at the bottom flanking the beast symbol.

====The Gospel of Matthew Miniature on folio 2v====
Within the top roundel of this miniature the Evangelist is shown with his right hand in a gesture of benediction with his two index fingers pointing to his Gospel book that he holds in his left hand. His tetramorph beast symbol within the arch consists of a full-figure frontal standing angel. The capitals or column heads from which the arches spring consisting of simple double rings or cusps, and the columns rest on two stepped bases. This miniature is artistically more elaborate that the other three illuminations, thus emphasizing its important status as first Gospel book. This elaboration includes the additional architectural elements (bases) as well as the inclusion of Celtic/Irish Ultimate La Tène trumpet-spiral and pelta infill designs or motifis in the spandrels. The Latin inscriptions for this miniature read: top &quot;&quot;+ HIC MATHEVS IN HUMANITATE&quot;” (“Here Matthew is in his human form”), and bottom “&quot;+ HIC MATHEVS IN ANGELICA ASSPECTV VIDETVR&quot;” (“Here Matthew is seen in his angelic aspect”).

====The Gospel of Mark Miniature on Folio 12v====
Within the top roundel of this miniature the Evangelist is depicted with his right hand in a gesture of benediction with his two index fingers pointing to his Gospel book he holds in his left hand. Below, his beast symbol within the arch consists of a full-figure, three-quarter profile figure of a winged lion that stands on its hind legs. The capitals from which the arches spring consist of single tablet capitals topped by floral buds. In addition to the arches, a pointed floral leaf-shaped bud with two shoots that also spring from these two capitals. The flanking two columns rest on the floor or ground, lacking bases. The Latin inscriptions for this miniature read: top &quot;+ HIC MARCVS IN HUMANITATE&quot; (&quot;Here Mark is in his human form&quot;), and bottom &quot;+ HIC MARCVS IMAGINEM TENET LEONIS&quot; (&quot;Here Mark has the image of a lion&quot;).

====The Gospel of Luke Miniature on folio 21v====
Within the top roundel the Evangelist is shown holding a stylus in his right hand and an open Gospel book he holds in his left hand. His beast symbol within the arch consists of a full-figure, three-quarter profile figure of a winged horned calf/ox standing on its hind hooves. The hindquarters of this beast symbol appears to have been borrowed or copied from elsewhere, and the upper half of the calf was influenced by either a Carolingian or Mediterranean exemplar or model, thereby creating a hybrid image. The capitals from which the arches spring consist of simple double tablet capitals painted in reddish brown and blue. Here again, the flanking columns rest directly on the floor or ground lacking bases. The Latin inscriptions for this miniature read: top = “&quot;+ HIC LUCAS IN HUMANITATE&quot;” (“Here Luke is in his human form”), and bottom “&quot;+ HIC LVCAS FORMAM ACCEPIT VITULI&quot;” (“Here Luke has taken the shape of a calf”).

====The Gospel of John Miniature on folio 31v====
Within the top roundel the Evangelist is depicted with both his hands holding his closed Gospel book. His beast symbol within the arch consists of a full-figure frontal eagle figure with its head turned to its right in profile in an &quot;imperial&quot; fashion. The capitals consist of distinctive elaborate masks from which spring the arch as well as foliate and zoomorphic motifs. The Latin inscriptions for this miniature read: top “&quot;+ HIC IOHANNIS IN HUMANITATE&quot;” (“Here John is in his human form”), and bottom “&quot;+ HIC IOHANNIS VERTIT FRONTEM IN AQVILAM&quot;” (“Here John has transformed into the likeness of an eagle”).

====Marginalia====
On the outer margins outside the arched frames of the Evangelist illuminations for Matthew, Luke, and John are partial line drawings or “doodles” in black ink of the tetramorph beast symbols for these three Evangelists.

===Decorative Letters and Motifs===
Other decorative features are found throughout the textual components of this codex, and include the major and minor initials, continuing lettering, and litterae notabiliores. The types of decoration used consist of principally of both zoomorphic/animal and floral motifs. The zoomorphic decoration in the Book of Cerne is characteristically composed of “brontosaurus-like” beasts and grotesques that indicate Hiberno-Saxon, primarily Irish, origins with influences from the Mediterranean (Coptic and Byzantine). Foliate decorative motifs are primarily found on exteriors and terminals of zoomorphic/animal elements, the frames of the continuation panels and, as described above, the architectural capitals on the arched frames of the Mark and John Evangelist illuminations.

====Major Initials and Continuation Panels====
These are found at the opening of each of the four Gospel extract texts as well as the &quot;Suffragare&quot; panel that introduces &quot;Lorica of Laidcenn&quot; text on fol. 43 recto. Continuation panels are the decorative backgrounds or frames to the letters following the major initials. These elements exhibit the use of display capitals, zoomorphic, sub-zoomorphic, interlaced, and curvilinear decoration. The initials and continuation panels for the Gospel extract texts are distinguished by the use of gold and purple pigments, while the one in the Lorica text use the colors red, green, yellow, and blue.

====Minor Initials====
The minor initials within the text are decorated with interlace and curvilinear motifs with zoomorphic terminals.

====&quot;Litterae Notabiliores&quot;====
Almost all of these letters are ornamented with abstract zoomorphic/animal motifs, with the exception of one anthropomorphic image found on folio 91 verso.

==Attribution and provenance==
Like a number of other manuscripts that comprise the Canterbury/Tiberius group, the specific provenance or place (i.e., &quot;scriptorium&quot;) of manufacture of the Book of Cerne is unknown. This issue of provenance has generated much academic debate within the literature of this Southumbian codex, especially with the two references to Bishop Ædeluald/Oeðelpald, presumably the patron of this codex, within its text. The issue partly revolves around the identity of Bishop Ædeluald/Oeðelpald mentioned in the texts. Some researchers believe that these texts refer to Bishop Ædiluald/Æthelwold (721-740 AD) of Lindisfarne in Northumbria, while others have suggested that the name refers to Bishop Ædeluald (818-830 AD) of Lichfield in Mercia. As early as 1868 J.O. Westwood attributed the Book of Cerne to Lindisfarne in the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria. Variants of this Lindisfarne recension theory have been supported by subsequent studies written by such scholars as Bishop, Henry, and Dumville. However, other researchers who favor a 9th-century Mercian original have contested this Lindisfarne hypothesis. In 1902 Kuypers recognized this issue in his study of this manuscript where he cautiously identified the patron as the Bishop of Lichfield. More recent studies of the Book of Cerne by Moorish, Wormald, Robinson, Brown, Walker, and Webster have supported the Southumbrian/Mercian hypothesis. Brown has inferred that even if this manuscript is linked to the earlier Bishop of Lindisfarne, the orthography of the acrostic poem suggests that it may have been produced with reference to Bishop Ædeluald of Lichfield, or it was changed with him in mind.
The other interpretive issue concerning the Book of Cerne pertains to attempts to identify a plausible scriptorium location or origin provenance in which this codex was produced. Generally, its Southumbian or Mercian origins are now commonly accepted based on palaeographic, codicological, and stylistic evidence, particularly the script type used and visual decorative elements of the miniatures and text. This manuscript has often been placed within a group of Anglo-Saxon manuscripts alternatively referred to as the Canterbury or Tiberius Group, which is composed of several other well-known examples, such as the &quot;Vespasian Psalter&quot; (London, British Library, Cotton Vespasian A.i.), the &quot;Codex Aureus&quot; (Stockholm, Royal Library, MS A.135), the &quot;Barberini Gospels&quot; (Rome, Vatican, Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, MS lat.570), and the &quot;Royal Bible&quot; (London, British Library, Royal MS I.E.vi), to name a few. This group of manuscripts is distinguished by several characteristic elements that include:
* The use of minuscule script in later manuscripts in this group, as evident in the Book of Cerne;
* The use of an interlace display script in which each letter is joined to one another by means of brontosaurus-like beast heads; and
* The display of script with zoomorphic ornament that resembles contemporary 9th Trewhiddle style metalwork, which is characterized with the use of interlaced and contorted animals and leafy scrollwork.
T. D. Kendrick observed that the Book of Cerne exhibits a distinctive style from the other manuscripts from the Canterbury group and suggested that it was possibly Mercian in origin. Later, in several articles dating between 1948 and 1957 there was a debate between S.M. Kuhn and K. Sisam over the provenance of these manuscripts, including the Book of Cerne. Although the Book of Cerne has been periodically attributed with a possible Mercian origin, Kuhn postulated the direct link between this manuscript and the Bishop of Lichfield, and attributed the entire group of manuscripts to Mercia, particularly Lichfield. Sisam, on the other hand, dismissed Kuhn&#x27;s interpretation by reasserting the Canterbury/Kentish association for this group of Anglo-Saxon manuscripts. However, Sisam did realize that the Book of Cerne was different from the other manuscripts of this group, and he postulated that it could be a provincial or Mercian outlier. The recent in depth studies of the Book of Cerne by Brown has included this codex within the Canterbury/Tiberius group of manuscripts that she argues were produced in Mercia, Kent, and Wessex in the 8th and 9th centuries CE, a region which she defines as a “Mercian Schriftprovinz”. Along with other manuscripts including the Barberini Gospels, Brown has placed the Book of Cerne in the Mercian school of the Tiberius group. She further concluded that this codex was the product of a scriptorium in Worcester, or perhaps Lichfield.

==Subsequent History==
The subsequent history of this 9th-century AD Insular/Anglo-Saxon manuscript after its production is equally speculative. However, the existing evidence seems to suggest that at some point after its production in the later 9th and early 10th centuries this codex may have been subsequently relocated somewhere in unoccupied Mercia, presumably Worcester, or even Wessex. This evacuation, along with other ecclesiastical manuscripts, was to provide a safe environment or repository to protect the book from potential Viking raids and incursions.

Despite the attachment of accretionary texts to the original Insular/Anglo-Saxon book relating to the Benedictine Abbey at Cerne in Dorset, there are even questions concerning whether or not this codex was ever physically housed at this monastery. All one can say for certain based on codicological evidence is that at some point after the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century, and by 1697, that these accretionary documents from Cerne Abbas were attached to the original Insular/Anglo-Saxon core.

The earliest historical account of the Book of Cerne is found in an inventory of the personal library of John Moore, Bishop of Norwich (1691–1707) and Bishop of Ely (1707–1714) found in Edward Bernard’s &quot;Catalogi Librorum Manuscriptorum&quot; dating to 1697. After Moore’s death in 1714 his library, along with the Book of Cerne, was purchased by King George I (reigned 1714-1727) for 6,000 guineas. The king then presented this library to Cambridge University as a royal gift on 20 September 1715.

<doc id="348378" wikidata="Q4129653" url="?curid=348378" title="Penn Jillette">
<text>Penn Fraser Jillette (born March 5, 1955) is an American magician, actor, comedian, musician, inventor, television presenter, and author, best known for his work with fellow magician Teller as half of the team Penn &amp; Teller. The duo has been featured in numerous stage and television shows, such as &quot;Penn &amp; Teller: Fool Us&quot; and &quot;Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!&quot;, and is as of 2024 headlining in Las Vegas at The Rio. Jillette serves as the act&#x27;s orator and raconteur.

Jillette has published eight books, including the &quot;New York Times&quot; Bestseller, &quot;God, No!: Signs You May Already Be an Atheist and Other Magical Tales&quot;. He is also known for his advocacy of atheism, scientific skepticism, the First Amendment, as well as previously identifying as a libertarian, a position he disavowed in 2020.

==Early life==
Jillette was born in Greenfield, Massachusetts. His mother, Valda Rudolph Jillette (née Parks; 1909–2000), was a secretary, and his father, Samuel Herbert Jillette (1912–1999), worked at Greenfield&#x27;s Franklin County Jail. Jillette became an atheist in his early teens after reading the Bible. He was subsequently asked to leave the church, after asking questions in a youth group that purportedly also made skeptics of his peers. Jillette became disenchanted with traditional illusionist acts that presented the craft as authentic magic, such as The Amazing Kreskin on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;. At age eighteen, he saw a show by illusionist James Randi, and became enamored of his approach to magic that openly acknowledged deception as entertainment rather than a mysterious supernatural power. Jillette regularly acknowledges Randi as the one person on the planet he loved the most besides members of his family.

Jillette worked with high school classmate Michael Moschen in developing and performing a juggling act during the years immediately following their 1973 graduation. In 1973, Jillette graduated from Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Clown College. In 1974, he was introduced to Teller by Weir Chrisemer, a mutual friend. The three then formed a three-person act called Asparagus Valley Cultural Society which played their first act together on August 19, 1975, at the Minnesota Renaissance Festival, and later in San Francisco. In 1981, he and Teller teamed up as Penn &amp; Teller, and went on to do a successful Off Broadway and later Broadway theatre show called &quot;Penn &amp; Teller&quot; that toured nationally.

==Career==
Jillette served as host and presenter of the first touring performance by avant-garde band the Residents in 1983. The performance (titled &quot;The Mole Show&quot; and based on their &quot;Mole trilogy&quot; of albums) featured Jillette coming out between songs telling long and intentionally pointless stories. The show was designed to appear to fall apart as it progressed; Jillette pretended to grow angrier with the crowd, and lighting effects and music would become increasingly chaotic, all building up to the point where he was dragged off stage and returned, handcuffed to a wheelchair, to deliver his last monologue. During one performance, an audience member assaulted Jillette while he was handcuffed to the wheelchair. In later years, Jillette would contribute to two documentary films about the Residents.

Jillette was a contributor to the now-defunct &quot;PC/Computing&quot; magazine, having a regular back-section column between 1990 and 1994.

Jillette was the primary voice announcer for the U.S.-based cable network Comedy Central in the 1990s through the early 2000s.

In 1994, Jillette purchased a house in the Las Vegas Valley and dubbed it &quot;The Slammer&quot;.
It has been featured in dozens of television shows and articles and was designed by his friend Colin Summers. He formerly recorded music there, and conducted his radio show at the studio inside &quot;The Slammer&quot;. In 2016, he sold &quot;The Slammer&quot; so that his family could move to a less remote location.

Starting in 1996, Jillette had a recurring role on &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot; as Drell, the head of the Witches&#x27; Council. He and Teller both appeared in the pilot with Debbie Harry as the third member of the council. The show was created by Jillette&#x27;s friend Nell Scovell.

For a brief time in 1997, Jillette wrote bi-weekly dispatches for the search engine Excite.com. Each column ended with a pithy comment identifying which of the Penn &amp; Teller duo he was. (For example: &quot;Penn Jillette is the half of Penn &amp; Teller that&#x27;s detained at airports.&quot;) Jillette made a habit of linking many words in his online column to wacky sites that generally had nothing to do with the actual words. The columns are no longer available on the current Excite.com site, but have been republished with permission at PennAndTeller.com.

Starting in 2003, Jillette, along with Teller, began producing and hosting the show &quot;Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!&quot; on Showtime. In the show, the two analyze cultural phenomena, debunk myths, criticize people and aspects of society they deem &quot;bullshit&quot;.

In 2005 with actor Paul Provenza, Jillette co-produced and co-directed &quot;The Aristocrats&quot;, a documentary film tracing the life of an obscene joke known as &quot;The Aristocrats&quot;. It principally consists of a variety of comedians telling their own versions of the joke.

From January 3, 2006, to March 2, 2007, Jillette hosted, along with fellow atheist, skeptic, and juggler Michael Goudeau, a live, hour-long radio talk show broadcast on Free FM. The show, &quot;Penn Radio&quot;, broadcast from his Vintage Nudes Studio in his Las Vegas home. The most notable recurring segment of the show was &quot;Monkey Tuesday&quot; and later &quot;The Pull of the Weasel&quot;. On March 2, 2007, Jillette announced that he would no longer be doing his radio show. He stated that he is a &quot;show biz wimp&quot; and decided to stop doing the show so he could spend more time with his children.

During the 2006–07 television season, Jillette hosted the prime-time game show &quot;Identity&quot; on NBC.

In 2008, Jillette was a contestant on &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, paired with professional dancer Kym Johnson.

During 2010–2011, Jillette did a bi-weekly show on Revision3 called &quot;Penn Point&quot;.

On August 16, 2011, Jillette&#x27;s book &quot;God, No! Signs You May Already Be An Atheist and Other Magical Tales&quot; was released and made the New York Times Best Sellers shortly after, in the week of August 28, in the 14th position.

An avid upright bassist, Jillette frequently accompanies jazz pianist Mike Jones, who opens for the magician&#x27;s Las Vegas show. On March 16, 2018, Jones released a live jazz album with Jillette entitled &quot;The Show Before the Show&quot; which consisted of ten tracks played by the duo at the Rio Las Vegas. Jillette additionally performed at the famed Green Mill Cocktail Lounge to coincide with the album&#x27;s debut.

Jillette was one of the contestants on &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice&quot; season 5, beginning on February 19, 2012. He was fired from the show by Donald Trump during the Week 11 episode. Also on February 19, 2012, along with Michael Goudeau, he started the podcast &quot;Penn&#x27;s Sunday School&quot;.

In 2013, he returned for the All-Star Celebrity Apprentice season, where he successfully made his way to the finale, raising $663,655 for the charity of his choice, Opportunity Village. On April 5, 2013, Penn and Teller were honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in the live performance category. Their star, the 2,494th awarded, is near the star dedicated to Harry Houdini. The following day they were recognized by the Magic Castle with the &quot;Magicians of the Year&quot; award.

Penn credits magician and skeptical activist James Randi for his career. During an interview at TAM! 2012, Penn stated that &quot;If not for Randi there would not be Penn &amp; Teller as we are today.&quot; He went on to say that &quot;Outside of my family... no one is more important in my life. Randi is everything to me.&quot;

==Business ventures==
===50 Skidillion Watts===
From 1987 to 1989, Jillette provided financial support to David and Jad Fair of the art rock band Half Japanese for their record label 50 Skidillion Watts. This allowed the band to release the albums &quot;Music to Strip By&quot;, &quot;The Band That Would Be King&quot; and &quot;Charmed Life&quot;. When asked about his assistance Jillette said, &quot;anybody who listens to Half Jap becomes a fan.&quot;

===Jill-Jet===
In July 1999, Jillette was granted for the &quot;Jill-Jet&quot;, a hot-tub jet specially angled for allowing a woman to masturbate against the water stream. The patent expired in September 2018. He has credited Debbie Harry of Blondie for suggesting the idea, as the two of them were once in a hot tub and Harry made a remark about changing the jets for a woman&#x27;s pleasure. Jillette liked the idea enough to pursue a patent application at the USPTO under the patent title &quot;Hydro-therapeutic Stimulator&quot;.

The abstract of the patent explains that a &quot;discharge nozzle is located within the tub and connected to the outlet, mounted to the seat so that the discharged water from the circulation pump automatically aligns with and is directed to stimulation points (e.g., the clitoris) of the female user when the female user sits in the seat.&quot; An article in the June 2006 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot; shed additional light on the invention. Originally, it was to be called the &quot;ClitJet&quot;; however, he stated that &quot;Jill-Jet&quot; was more suitable because it included his name in the title.

On the &quot;Penn Radio&quot; show, telling the listeners about the photo shoot for the &quot;Playboy&quot; article, Jillette mentioned that he has a Jill-Jet installed in a tub in his house, and that several of his female friends and friends&#x27; female spouses enjoy it a lot, but he is not aware of any other installations of a water jet in such a configuration anywhere else.

===Vintage Nudes Studio===
Jillette created a private recording studio in his Las Vegas home. The addition, designed by &quot;Outside The Lines Studio&quot; and built by Crisci Custom Builders between October 2003 and June 2004 as part of his Las Vegas home, was named Vintage Nudes Studios by Jillette for playing cards that he had collected. The cards are displayed in the interior design in a manner which is meaningful to magicians. The studio was home to Free FM&#x27;s &quot;Penn Radio&quot; show, and was the home of the Penn&#x27;s Sunday School stream and podcast until it was demolished in 2016, along with his former home, &quot;The Slammer&quot;.

==Personal life==
===Family===
Jillette is married to Emily Jillette, and they have two children: Zolten and Moxie CrimeFighter (who sometimes uses the name &quot;Luka&quot;).

===Red fingernail===
Jillette has told multiple stories regarding the red fingernail on his left hand. In one, Jillette&#x27;s mother told him to get a manicure because people would be looking at his hands. In response to this, he had all of his nails painted red as a joke. Jillette has also claimed that the red fingernail provides excellent misdirection and is &quot;just plain cool&quot;.

In direct response to questions about his red fingernail, Penn has stated &quot;People are asking about my fingernail. Wear my Dad&#x27;s ring and my Mom&#x27;s nail polish. Just for remembrance and respect.&quot; On the podcast &quot;Skepticality&quot; in 2012, Jillette said that he was considering changing the meaning of the red nail polish, telling his child it is for them.

===Health===
Jillette says that he has an addictive personality and claims to have never had &quot;so much as a puff of marijuana or a drop of alcohol&quot; because he does not trust himself to do it in moderation.

In December 2014, Jillette&#x27;s blood pressure caused him to be admitted to the hospital. By his birthday, March 5, 2015, he had lost . He follows Joel Fuhrman&#x27;s nutritarian diet, which means that he eats little or no animal products, no processed grains, and no added sugar or salt. Penn is featured in &quot;Eating You Alive&quot;, a 2016 American documentary about food and health. In an interview with Big Think in 2020, Jillette said he is a vegan.

===Atheism===

Jillette identifies as an atheist. His cars&#x27; license plates read &quot;ATHEIST&quot;, &quot;NOGOD&quot; and &quot;GODLESS&quot;. &quot;Strangely enough, they wouldn&#x27;t give me &#x27;INFIDEL,&#x27;&quot; he said.

In 2005, he wrote and read an essay for National Public Radio claiming that he was &quot;beyond atheism,” stating “Atheism is not believing in God... I believe there is no God.&quot; His atheism, he has explained, has informed every aspect of his life and thoughts, and as such is as crucial to him as theistic beliefs are to the devout. Jillette encourages open discussion, debate, and proselytizing on the issue of God&#x27;s existence, believing that the issue is too important for opinions about it to remain private. Jillette does not dismiss all who do believe in God: in a 2008 edition of his &quot;Penn Says&quot; podcast, he expresses his appreciation for a fan who brought him the gift of a pocket Gideon Bible after a performance because he realized that this individual sincerely cared enough about him to try to help him.

In January 2007, Jillette took the &quot;Blasphemy Challenge&quot; offered by the Rational Response Squad and publicly denied the existence of a holy spirit.

In 2016, Jillette said that &quot;every sane person is&quot; agnostic.

Jillette appeared in the 2019 Church of the SubGenius film &quot;J.R. ‘Bob’ Dobbs and the Church of the SubGenius&quot;, where he spoke positively of the parody religion.

===Politics===
Jillette has previously identified as a libertarian, and stated in 2003 that he may consider himself an anarcho-capitalist. He was a fellow at the libertarian think tank the Cato Institute.

In 2008, Jillette stated that there is not enough information to make an informed decision on global warming, that his gut told him it was not real, but his mind said that he cannot prove it. As of 2014, he has changed his position and now believes that climate change is occurring.

He stated in 2008 that he &quot;always&quot; votes Libertarian, 
and endorsed Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson for president in 2012 and 2016. However, he participated in vote swapping in 2016 by voting for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the swing state of Nevada, in exchange for &quot;10 or 11&quot; of his friends promising to vote for Johnson in blue states like California and New York.

In 2020, Jillette distanced himself from aspects of libertarianism, particularly surrounding COVID-19. In an interview with Big Think, he stated, &quot;[A] lot of the illusions that I held dear, rugged individualism, individual freedoms, are coming back to bite us in the ass.&quot; He went on to elaborate, &quot;[I]t seems like getting rid of the gatekeepers gave us Trump as president, and in the same breath, in the same wind, gave us not wearing masks, and maybe gave us a huge unpleasant amount of overt racism.&quot;

In a 2024 interview, he said he renounced his libertarianism as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic after a libertarian group asked him to speak at an anti-mask rally. &quot;The fact they sent me this email is something I need to be very ashamed of, and I need to change&quot; adding &quot;Many times when I identified as Libertarian, people said to me, &#x27;It’s just rich white guys that don’t want to be told what to do,&#x27; and I had a zillion answers to that — and now that seems 100 percent accurate.&quot;

In the 2020 United States presidential election, Jillette endorsed Andrew Yang in the Democratic primary. In an op-ed for CNN after that year&#x27;s general election, he stated that he &quot;used to identify as Libertarian&quot;, but voted for Joe Biden. In a January 2024 interview, he stated regarding the upcoming presidential election: &quot;I&#x27;m going to vote Democrat, maybe that&#x27;s all you need to know. I will not vote for a third-party candidate.&quot;

<text>Social dances are dances that have social functions and context. Social dances are intended for participation rather than performance. They are often danced merely to socialise and for entertainment, though they may have ceremonial, competitive and erotic functions.

Many social dances of European origin are in recent centuries partner dances &quot;(see Ballroom dance)&quot; but elsewhere there may instead be circle dances or line dances.

==Social dance in western cultures==
The types of dance performed in social gatherings change with social values. Social dance music of the 14th century has been preserved in manuscript, though without proper choreography, for dances such as the &quot;ballo&quot;, carol, &quot;stampita&quot;, &quot;saltarello&quot;, &quot;trotto&quot; and &quot;roto&quot;. The 15th century is the first period from which written records of dances exist. A manuscript from Brussels highlights the Burgundian court dance, which spread all over Europe, referred to as the basse dance in which a large group perform a series of steps in triple time. Italian courts danced &quot;balli&quot;, with a wide array of choreographed rhythms, steps and positions for the dancers. These were documented in instruction books written by the dance masters who choreographed them for the courts.

Social dances of lower classes were not recorded until the Late Renaissance. According to Richard Powers, courtiers in the late 16th century continually had to &quot;prove themselves through their social skills, especially through dance.&quot; Recorded social dances of the late 16th century include the pavane and the Canary dance. Thoinot Arbeau&#x27;s book &quot;Orchésographie&quot; describes peasant branles as well as the 16th century &quot;basse danse&quot; and &quot;la volta&quot;. The peasants from the countryside supplied new dances to the court as the old ones&#x27; novelty wore out.

During the Baroque Era court balls served to display social status. A formal ball opened with a branle in which couples stood in a line in order of their place in the social hierarchy, the most highly regarded couples dancing first. The Menuet and the Gavotte gained popularity. Balls often ended with an English country dance. France gained a pre-eminence in dance, but the French Revolution created a shift away from formality.

During the Regency Era, from 1811 to 1830, the Quadrille became the most popular dance in England and France. The Quadrille consisted of a large variety of steps that skimmed the ground, such as chassé and jeté. Most other dances of this era, such as the Mazurka, were performed in lines and squares.

The waltz, which arrived in Britain toward the end of the Napoleonic Wars, was a partner dance in which partners danced more closely than had previously been considered acceptable. In the waltz, neither partner led. Individuals danced as equals, which was new at the time. The Polka was another dance that arose during this time in which partners were scandalously close. According to Powers, the dances of this time were &quot;fresh, inventive, youthful, and somewhat daring,&quot; which mirrored society at the time.

===20th century United States===
Towards the end of the 19th century, Americans were tiring of the court dances of their grandparents&#x27; era. In the early 20th century, Americans began pairing Victorian dances such as the Two-Step with Ragtime music. Other dances included the African American Cakewalk, and animal dances such as the Turkey Trot. The most popular social dance of the time was the One-Step. The dance consisted of couples taking one step on each beat of the music, so even beginners could participate.

The introduction of the phonograph record marked a shift toward dancing to recorded music, as radio stations, jukeboxes, and sock hops played records to dance to.

Swing dance in the 1930s has grown in popularity, taking many dance forms, some of them, such as Lindy Hop or West Coast Swing have survived to today.

Rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll in the 1950s brought about a shift in social dancing toward rebelliousness. This shift was seen especially in teenagers who did not want to dance the same steps that their parents did. The dancing was mostly swing based but had a variations in different regions. Couples began dancing as individuals for the first time, sending the message that there did not have to be a leader and a follower.

<text>Black Tiger Fist () is a northern Chinese martial art originating in Henan Province.

== Origins ==
The style is believed to have originated sometime around the 10th century. The traditional lineage of the system begins with master Wang Zhenyuan in the late nineteenth-century; but the style was originally formed at the Shaolin Temple in Henan before being transferred to Wang.The style was then passed from Wang Zhenyuan to Wang Zijiu, Wang Zhixiao (1862–1948), then to Gildardo Castro Cruz(?), and finally to Jose Alí Loaiza Pita(?).

== Techniques ==
The Black Tiger style is characterised by its extensive footwork, acrobatic kicks, low, wide stances, and unique fist position (where the thumb is curled in the same manner as the other fingers, rather than wrapped around them).

The Black Tiger style&#x27;s fighting mentality is to use these sweeps and kicks by acrobatic movements, with the purpose of overwhelming the opponent before they are able to attack.

The style places emphasis on developing physical power and focus on fitness, rather than on internal aspects. Iron palm training is central to this style.

<text>Rubyfruit Jungle is the first novel by Rita Mae Brown. Published in 1973, it was remarkable in its day for its explicit portrayal of lesbianism. The novel is a coming-of-age autobiographical account of Brown&#x27;s youth and emergence as a lesbian author. The term &quot;rubyfruit jungle&quot; is a term used in the novel for the female genitals.

==Plot summary==
The novel focuses on Molly Bolt, the adopted daughter of a poor family, who possesses remarkable beauty and who is aware of her lesbianism from early childhood. Her relationship with her mother is rocky, and at a young age her mother, referred to as &quot;Carrie&quot;, informs Molly that she is not her own biological child but a &quot;bastard&quot;. Molly has her first same-sex sexual relationship in the sixth grade with her girlfriend Leota B. Bisland, and then again in a Florida high school, where she has another sexual relationship with another friend, the school&#x27;s head cheerleader Carolyn Simpson, who willingly has sex with Molly but rejects the &quot;lesbian&quot; label. Molly also engages in sex with males, including her cousin Leroy when the two were younger. Her father, Carl, dies when she is in her junior year of high school.

Molly pushes herself to excel in high school, winning a full scholarship to the University of Florida. However, when Molly&#x27;s relationship with her alcoholic roommate is discovered, she is put into their psychiatric ward and denied a renewal of her scholarship. Possessing little money, she hitchhikes to New York to pursue an education in filmmaking.

In New York, Molly has her first experiences in lesbian communities. She is critical of most of the circles she meets and, as she always has done, continues to define herself and go down her own path.

Molly appears to notice environmental differences between the countryside and the city, and she also notices similarities of American culture-at-large.

At film school, she continues to observe and ignore the heterosexual culture that appears to saturate the world around her.

Molly takes a trip home to have her mother Carrie star in her short documentary that will be her final project for her film degree. After a quiet but successful graduation from film school, Molly runs into all of the roadblocks she expected to in looking for a job in her field. She is offered secretary jobs. She does not take any of the jobs and states that if it takes her until she&#x27;s 50 years old then so be it.

Upon reaching New York, she realizes that the rubyfruit is possibly not as delicious and varied as she had dreamed within the concrete jungle.

==Literary significance and criticism==
This work is notable for being an early literary lesbian novel. Many lesbian readers have found in it a reflection of their own experiences and observations. While some refer to it as &quot;just another lesbian coming of age novel&quot;, its success is part of why the genre is now often considered a cliché. However, the book was criticized by psychological theorist David Halperin, who considered its savage ridiculing of butch culture to be heteronormative. In 2015, Rita Mae Brown was awarded the Lee Lynch Classic Book Award from the Golden Crown Literary Society for &quot;Rubyfruit Jungle&quot;.

==Reception==
A 1977 review reported that since the book&#x27;s 1973 release it has remained popular.

In an interview at the 2015 republishing of the book, Brown remarked that the book was an immediate success at the time of its publication.

==In popular culture==
A copy of the novel can be seen on Trish&#x27;s nightstand in &quot;The Slumber Party Massacre&quot;, for which author Rita Mae Brown wrote the screenplay.

The book was mentioned and was later being read from in the movie, &quot;The Incredibly True Adventure of Two Girls in Love&quot;, as it was suggested by one of the protagonist&#x27;s friends for her to read.

The titular character of &quot;Educating Rita&quot;, whose real name is Susan, adopts the name Rita after reading the book.

One of the titular characters of &quot;Billie &amp; Emma&quot; owns a copy of the book and is seen reading it throughout the film, to the discomfort of her aunt with whom she lives, and discusses with her love interest how it makes her feel less alone.

The Team Dresch song Musical Fanzine about the LGBTQ+ representation the band members wished they had seen as children includes the lyrics &quot;You can find what you need / Maybe it&#x27;s finding a very secret place / To hide your copy of Rubyfruit Jungle / Maybe you&#x27;re writing your own&quot;

<text>CrimethInc., also known as CWC, which stands for either &quot;CrimethInc. Ex-Workers Collective&quot; or &quot;CrimethInc Ex-Workers Ex-Collective&quot;, is a decentralized anarchist collective of autonomous cells. CrimethInc. emerged in the mid-1990s, initially as the hardcore zine &quot;Inside Front&quot;, and began operating as a collective in 1996. It has since published widely read articles and zines for the anarchist movement and distributed posters and books of its own publication.

CrimethInc. cells have published books, released records, and organized national campaigns against globalization and representative democracy in favor of radical community organizing. Less public splinter groups have carried out direct action (including arson and hacktivism), hosted international conventions and other events, maintained local chapters, sparked riots, and toured with multimedia performance art or anarcho-punk musical ensembles. The collective has received national media and academic attention, as well as criticism and praise from other anarchists for its activities and philosophy. CrimethInc. has an association with the North American anarcho-punk scene due to its relationship with artists in the genre and its publishing of &quot;Inside Front&quot; as well as more recently the contemporary anti-capitalist movement.

==Activities==
Activities by CrimethInc. cells have toured with hardcore anarcho-punk musical ensembles. In 2002, a cell in Olympia, Washington staged a five-day film festival with skill-sharing workshops and screenings. Cells have also supported various large-scale campaigns with publicity work, including &quot;Unabomber for President&quot; and the &quot;Don&#x27;t Just (Not) Vote&quot; election campaigns as well as the protests against the Free Trade Area of the Americas of 2003 in Miami, Florida. Individuals adopting the CrimethInc. &quot;nom de guerre&quot; have included convicted Earth Liberation Front arsonists, as well as hacktivists who successfully attacked the websites of DARE, the Republican National Committee, and sites related to U.S. President George W. Bush&#x27;s 2004 re-election campaign. These activities have earned the collective irregular attention from the mainstream news media. Several CrimethInc. cells have worked in collaboration with other anti-capitalists and anarchists to promote Steal Something From Work Day every April 15, which coincides with the United States Tax Day, to protest exploitation in the workplace.

===Publications and media===

The creation of propaganda has been described as the collective&#x27;s core function. Among their best-known publications are the books &quot;Days of War, Nights of Love&quot;, &quot;Expect Resistance&quot;, &quot;Evasion&quot;, &quot;Recipes for Disaster: An Anarchist Cookbook&quot;, the pamphlets &quot;To Change Everything: an Anarchist Appeal&quot; (available in paper, PDF and video form), and &quot;Fighting For Our Lives&quot; (with 650,000 copies printed by 2010), the hardcore punk/political zine &quot;Inside Front&quot;, and the music of hardcore punk bands. Several websites are maintained by individual cells, including Crimethinc.com, operated by the Far East Cell, which hosts propaganda, excerpts from available publications, and a blog of the activities of other cells. CrimethInc. is connected to publishing collectives/organizations with similar ideas, notably the Curious George Brigade, which has written a number of publications including &quot;Anarchy in the Age of Dinosaurs&quot;. In 2005, they began publishing a half-gloss journal, &quot;Rolling Thunder&quot;, with the byline &quot;An Anarchist Journal of Dangerous Living&quot;, which released its eighth issue in 2009. CrimethInc. texts have received wide coverage in the anarchist media and in academic publications, and have been used as reading materials for university courses on anarchism.

CrimethInc. also distributes documentaries such as &quot;&quot; (anti-free-trade) and &quot;PickAxe&quot; (anti-logging).

In 2021, the collective&#x27;s downtown Olympia publishing location burned in a fire.

In 2022, Elon Musk banned its Twitter account at the behest of right-wing influencer Andy Ngo. CrimethInc accused Musk of purchasing Twitter &quot;to silence opposition&quot;.

===Convergences===
Since the summer of 2002, CrimethInc. has hosted annual conventions, termed &quot;convergences&quot;, open to anyone. Typically featuring the performances of traveling theatrical troupes, musicians, direct-action and mutual-aid workshops from individual participants, the few-days-long camping trips have attracted coverage in newspaper articles, initiated multiple Reclaim the Streets actions, mobilized large Critical Mass events, and catalyzed many other activities.

The 2007 convergence in Athens, Ohio, saw an impromptu street party which resulted in arrests on minor charges. &quot;The Athens News&quot; characterized the convergence as &quot;a sort of networking, resume-swapping opportunity for would-be radicals, free-thinkers, Levellers, Diggers, Neo-Luddites, and other assorted malcontents.&quot; It is typical of these gatherings to require that all attendees have something to contribute to the momentum: whether it is bringing food or equipment to share, leading a discussion group, or providing materials with which to write to political prisoners. There has been a pattern of promoting convergences as festivals, reminiscent of barnstorming flying circuses and travelling sideshows.

&quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; journalist Matthew Power described the 2006 convergence in Winona, Minnesota as follows:
These convergences have been hosted by different groups within the collective each time, typically based on the initiative of local enthusiasts. Every year a different set of policy requests is released from locals in the field, typically encouraging a sober, consensus-based space in which no financial transactions are made. The one firm rule has been &quot;No police informants,&quot; a regulation which has been ignored by the FBI. Information gathered by FBI informants at CrimethInc. convergences (in 2004, 2005, and 2008) contributed to the convictions of Eric McDavid and his associates, as well as 2008 Republican National Convention protester Matthew DePalma.

In 2010, CrimethInc. announced the &quot;We Are Everywhere&quot; campaign of national tours and events in lieu of the traditional convergence. In 2015, CrimethInc. embarked on the similar &quot;To Change Everything&quot; two-month tour of the United States.

=== Music ===

CrimethInc. is associated with the North American anarcho-punk scene because of its long relationship with notable musicians in the genre and its publishing of &quot;Inside Front&quot;, a &quot;journal of hardcore punk and anarchist action&quot;. CrimethInc. releases include LP&#x27;s, CD&#x27;s, and 7-inch vinyl records from North American and European anarcho-punk, hardcore, and anti-folk bands. Academic Stacy Thompson has described CrimethInc. as &quot;exemplary of a more contemporary and nuanced approach&quot; to the possible forms anarcho-punk could take to resist commodification through aesthetic expression. However, Thompson does not consider the aesthetic choices of the collective to be substantially different from the anarcho- and crust punk bands released by fellow anarcho-punk collective &quot;Profane Existence&quot; in the mid-to-late 90s.

==Philosophy==

CrimethInc as a loose association represents a variety of political views; the CrimethInc. Their frequently-asked questions page asserts that it has &quot;no platform or ideology except that which could be generalized from the similarities between the beliefs and goals of the individuals who choose to be involved—and that is constantly in flux.&quot; &quot;CrimethInc.&quot; is an anonymous tag, a means of constructing dynamic networks of support and communication within the anarchist movement, and as such anyone can publish under the name or create a poster using the logo; each agent or group of agents operate autonomously. As well as the traditional anarchist opposition to the state and capitalism, agents have at times advocated a straight edge lifestyle, the total supersession of gender roles, violent insurrection against the state, and the refusal of work.

CrimethInc. is influenced by the Situationist International, and has been described by scholar Martin Puchner as &quot;inheritors of the political avant-garde&quot;, For their part, the authors of the book criticized the &quot;exclusive, anti-subjective&quot; nature of history as &quot;paralyzing&quot;, advocating in its place a non-superstitious myth. The collective has expressed a strident anti-copyright stance and advocacy of the appropriation of texts and ideas of others, which has attracted criticism from academic philosopher George MacDonald Ross as an endorsement of plagiarism. CrimethInc.&#x27;s N©! free license is known as an example of copyleft. It grants rights to individuals and none to corporations.

The active participants of CrimethInc. characterize it as a mindset and a way of life first and foremost, rather than as an organization &quot;per se&quot;. Its main goal is to inspire people to take more active control of their own lives, becoming producers of culture and history instead of passive consumers. Those who subscribe to the CrimethInc. philosophy advocates radical ways of living one&#x27;s life to the end of eliminating the perceived inequities and tyrannies within society. Contributors to publications are generally not credited in respect of anonymity asserted by participants to be one of the organization&#x27;s primary values. The name &quot;CrimethInc.&quot; itself is a satirical self-criticism about the hypocrisy of revolutionary propaganda and other &quot;margin-walking between contradictions&quot;, and a direct reference to the concept of &quot;thoughtcrime&quot; developed in George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;.

<text>Waterbury is a town in Washington County in central Vermont, United States. Although the town is still home to the Waterbury Village Historic District, the village sharing the name of the town officially dissolved as a municipality in 2018. As of the 2020 census, the population was 5,331.

==History==
The location where Waterbury now lies was once the frontier between the Mahican and Pennacook people. European settlement of the area dates from 1763, when King George III granted a charter for land in the Winooski River valley. James Marsh became the first permanent white settler in the region in 1783. Many of the early settlers came from Waterbury, Connecticut, and named their new town in honor of the hometown. The village of Waterbury was incorporated in 1882 with a population of over 2,000.

The Central Vermont Railroad came to Waterbury in 1849. The railroad expanded a passenger station for the railroad in 1875, making the station a more major stop on the &quot;Vermonter&quot;. The Green Mountain Seminary was built in Waterbury Center in 1869.

The state opened the Vermont State Asylum for the Insane in Waterbury in 1891. The hospital, renamed the Vermont State Hospital, grew to occupy over 40 buildings, but by the 1980s the number of patients had declined to the point where only one building was required. The remainder of the campus came to be used for state offices.
Like many New England towns, Waterbury&#x27;s economy was based around the local river mill industry and the surrounding agricultural producers. The mills produced products such as lumber and finished wood products, wicker products, leather, starch, and alcohol. The agriculture was based on sheep through the 19th century but switched over to dairy farming by the 20th century. Waterbury had a ski factory in the 1940s, the Derby &amp; Ball Company.

In 1927, Waterbury, like many other Vermont communities, was devastated by flooding. Inscriptions on the sides of some buildings in Waterbury village purport to show where the level of the water rose during the 1927 flood. The village recovered, and in 1938 the Waterbury Dam was built on the Little River by the Army Corps of Engineers to control future flooding in areas downstream of the town center.

On August 29, 2011, Tropical Storm Irene flooded downtown Waterbury and filled the buildings of the Vermont State Hospital, Vermont&#x27;s public psychiatric complex, with up to of water. Patients from the mental hospital were temporarily housed in various locations around Vermont, and over 1,100 of the 1,586 state employees were working in office space in other towns as of October 2011. The state was expected to decide by 2012 whether to relocate all or part of the workforce back to Waterbury.

In 2017, the citizens within the Village of Waterbury voted to dissolve it as a municipality, completing their merger with the Town of Waterbury. The Village dissolved on June 30, 2018.

==Economy==

Waterbury is the location of Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s Ice Cream, whose factory tours have become one of Vermont&#x27;s most popular tourist attractions. 

Other local businesses include a number of restaurants and bars. Businesses in the town, which sits between several major mountains including Mount Mansfield, typically thrive during the month of October, when tourism swells thanks to fall foliage.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 4,915 people, 2,011 households, and 1,321 families residing in the town. The population density was 810.4 people per square mile (312.9/km2). There were 2,106 housing units at an average density of 347.2 per square mile (134.1/km2). The racial makeup of the town was 97.80% White, 0.26% African American, 0.12% Native American, 0.65% Asian, 0.26% from other races, and 0.89% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.67% of the population.

==Transportation==

Amtrak, the national passenger rail system, provides daily service to Waterbury, operating its &quot;Vermonter&quot; between St. Albans and Washington, D.C.

The Green Mountain Transit Agency (GMTA) provides public transit bus services to Burlington, Montpelier, Morrisville, and Stowe.

Waterbury is served by Interstate 89, U.S. Route 2, and Route 100.

==Media==
Radio station WDEV -550 AM &amp; 96.1 FM (News/Talk), is located in town, with its offices and studios on Stowe Street. WIXM –103.3 FM is officially licensed to Waterbury and has its transmission tower located on Ricker Mountain (which it shares with sister station WNCS Montpelier), but its offices and studios are located in South Burlington.

The Waterbury Record was a weekly newspaper that served the local area. On March 26, 2020, the Vermont Community Newspaper Group announced that it was suspending publication of the Waterbury Record, after 13 years of publication, citing the lack of widespread advertising support and now the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic.

In May 2020 a web-based publication, the Waterbury Roundabout, was founded by Lisa Scagliotti to provide local news with support from the University of Vermont’s Community News Service. A partnership was formed with the Barre Montpelier Times Argus to distribute a free weekly printed &quot;Waterbury Reader&quot; to residents of Waterbury. That partnership ended in September 2022 and the Waterbury Roundabout returned to being a web-only publication.

<doc id="348438" wikidata="Q1317983" url="?curid=348438" title="Ship's tender">
<text>A ship&#x27;s tender, usually referred to as a tender, is a boat or ship used to service or support other boats or ships. This is generally done by transporting people or supplies to and from shore or another ship.

A second and distinctly different meaning for &quot;tender&quot; is small boats carried by larger vessels, to be used either as lifeboats, or as transport to shore, or both.

==Purpose==
For a variety of reasons, it is not always advisable to try to tie a ship up at a dock; the weather or the sea might be rough, the time might be short, or the ship too large to fit. In such cases tenders provide the link from ship to shore, and may have a very busy schedule of back-and-forth trips while the ship is in port.

On cruise ships, lifeboat tenders do double duty, serving as tenders in day-to-day activities, but fully equipped to act as lifeboats in an emergency. They are generally carried on davits just above the promenade deck, and may at first glance appear to be regular lifeboats; but they are usually larger and better-equipped. Current lifeboat tender designs favor catamaran models, since they are less likely to roll in the calm to moderate conditions in which tenders are usually used. They typically carry up to 100 to 150 passengers and two to three crew members. 

Before these ships were mass-produced, the main way to board a larger ship (mainly ocean liners) was to board a passenger tender. Passenger tenders remained based at their ports of registry, and when a ship came through the area, the tender would tie up with the ship and embark passengers on an elevated walkway. These vessels were larger, had a greater passenger capacity, and a broader sense of individuality in their respective companies than the more modern tenders seen today. Because of their increased size, lifeboats and life preservers were commonplace on board these ships (with two lifeboats being typical for an average tender).

===Warships and submarines===
Before the technologies that allow submarines and destroyers to operate independently matured by the latter half of the 20th century (and significantly during the Second World War), they were heavily dependent upon tenders to perform most maintenance and supply. Their hull classification symbols in the US Navy were, respectively, AS and AD, while general repair ships were AR. Naval tenders fell out of use during the late 20th century, as the speed and range of warships increased (reducing the need for advanced basing).

By the end of the 20th century, all of the tenders in the U.S. Navy had been inactivated except for two submarine tenders. As a result of the settlement of lawsuits over the Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet, the U.S. Navy and MARAD are engaged in an aggressive disposal program that will scrap all of those ships by 2017. While the Navy&#x27;s plans for tenders held in reserve in other places (such as inactivated submarine tenders and held at Inactive Ships, St. Juliens Creek Annex) were not addressed in that lawsuit, since its settlement, the Navy has indicated its desire to dispose of such ships as soon as possible.

Apparently not completely willing to wean itself from tenders all together – but with an eye towards reducing costs – the last two tenders remaining in active service have now been operationally turned over to the Military Sealift Command. s and now operate with a &quot;hybrid&quot; crew. The commanding officer and approximately 200 technicians are Navy personnel, while the operation of the ship itself is performed by merchant mariners. Prior to the turn-over, both ships had more than 1,000 sailors. While at this time the ships still bear the AS classification, both ship&#x27;s primary mission has been expanded well beyond submarines to include service and support of any Naval vessel in their operational area. Under the traditional Navy classification, both ships should be reclassified as AR (Auxiliary Repair), however since now operated by the MSC it is doubtful such a reassignment will occur. &quot;Emory S. Land&quot; is forward deployed in the Indian Ocean at Diego Garcia while &quot;Frank Cable&quot; is forward-deployed in the Pacific at Polaris Point, Apra Harbor, Guam. Such forward deployments are to provide service and support at the very great distances of the Western Pacific.

Two tenders, and , were built for the White Star Line by Harland and Wolff to serve the liners and at Cherbourg. &quot;Nomadic&quot; survives as a museum ship, and is the last remaining vessel built for the White Star Line in existence.

<doc id="348444" wikidata="Q2429803" url="?curid=348444" title="Persecution of Muslims">
<text>The persecution of Muslims has been recorded throughout the history of Islam, beginning with its founding by Muhammad in the 7th century.

In the early days of Islam in Mecca, pre-Islamic Arabia, the new Muslims were frequently subjected to abuse and persecution by the Meccans, known as the Mushrikun in Islam, who were adherents to polytheism. In the contemporary period, Muslims have faced religious restrictions in some countries. Various incidents of Islamophobia have also occurred.

==Medieval==

===Early Islam===

In the early days of Islam in Mecca, the new Muslims were often subjected to abuse and persecution by the pagan Meccans (often called &quot;Mushrikin&quot;: the unbelievers or polytheists). Some were killed, such as Sumayya, the seventh convert to Islam, who was allegedly tortured first by Amr ibn Hisham. Even the Islamic prophet Muhammad was subjected to such abuse; while he was praying near the Kaaba, Uqba ibn Abu Mu&#x27;ayt threw the entrails of a sacrificed camel over him. Abu Lahab&#x27;s wife Umm Jamil would regularly dump filth outside his door and placed thorns in the path to his house.

Accordingly, if free Muslims were attacked, slaves who converted were subjected to far worse. The master of the Ethiopian Bilal ibn Rabah (who would become the first muezzin) would take him out into the desert in the boiling heat of midday and place a heavy rock on his chest, demanding that he forswear his religion and pray to the polytheists&#x27; gods and goddesses, until Abu Bakr bought him and freed him.

===Crusades===

The First Crusade was launched in 1095 by Pope Urban II, with the stated goal of regaining control of the sacred city of Jerusalem and the Holy Land from the Muslims, who had captured them from the Byzantines in 638. The Fatimid Caliph, Al Hakim of Cairo, known as the &quot;mad Caliph&quot; destroyed the Constantinian-era Church of the Holy Sepulcher in 1009, as well as other Christian churches and shrines in the Holy Land.

This event, in conjunction with the killing of Germanic pilgrims who were travelling from Byzantium to Jerusalem, raised the anger of Europe, and inspired Pope Urban II to call on all Catholic rulers, knights, and noblemen to recapture the Holy Land from Muslim rule.

In part, it was also a response to the Investiture Controversy, which was the most significant conflict between secular and religious powers in medieval Europe. The controversy began as a dispute between the Holy Roman Emperor and the Gregorian Papacy and gave rise to the political concept of Christendom as a union of all peoples and sovereigns under the direction of the pope; as both sides tried to marshal public opinion in their favour, people became personally engaged in a dramatic religious controversy. Also of great significance in launching the crusade were the string of victories by the Seljuk Turks, which saw the end of Arab rule in Jerusalem.
On 7 May 1099 the Crusaders reached Jerusalem, which had been recaptured from the Seljuks by the Fatimids of Egypt only a year before. On 15 July, the Crusaders were able to end the siege by breaking down sections of the walls and entering the city. Over the course of that afternoon, evening, and next morning, the Crusaders killed almost every inhabitant of Jerusalem, Muslims and Jews alike. Although many Muslims sought shelter atop the Temple Mount inside the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the Crusaders spared few lives. According to the anonymous &quot;Gesta Francorum&quot;, in what some believe to be one of the most valuable contemporary sources of the First Crusade, &quot;...the slaughter was so great that our men waded in blood up to their ankles...&quot; (which is however rather a literary figure used multiple times in similar context than probable reality). According to Fulcher of Chartres: &quot;Indeed, if you had been there you would have seen our feet coloured to our ankles with the blood of the slain. But what more shall I relate? None of them were left alive; neither women nor children were spared.&quot;. Tancred, Prince of Galilee claimed the Temple quarter for himself and offered protection to some of the Muslims there, but he was unable to prevent their deaths at the hands of his fellow Crusaders.

During the massacre committed in Jerusalem during the First Crusade, it was reported that the Crusaders &quot;[circled] the screaming, flame-tortured humanity singing &#x27;Christ We Adore Thee!&#x27; with their Crusader crosses held high&quot;. Muslims were indiscriminately killed, and Jews who had taken refuge in their synagogue were killed when it was burnt down by the Crusaders.

===Southern Italy===
The island of Sicily was conquered by the Aghlabids in the 10th century after over a century of conflict, with the Byzantine Empire losing its final stronghold in 965. The Normans conquered the last Arab Muslim stronghold by 1091. Subsequently, just as Muslims had previously imposed the jizya tax on the non-Muslims of Sicily, the new rulers continued the practice and imposed the same tax now on the Muslims (locally spelled &quot;gisia&quot;). Another tax on levied them for a time was the &quot;augustale&quot;. Muslim rebellion broke out during the reign of Tancred as King of Sicily. Lombard pogroms against Muslims started in the 1160s. Muslim and Christian communities in Sicily became increasingly geographically separated. The island&#x27;s Muslim communities were mainly isolated beyond an internal frontier which divided the south-western half of the island from the Christian north-east. Sicilian Muslims were dependent on royal protection. When King William the Good died in 1189, this royal protection was lifted, and the door was opened for widespread attacks against the island&#x27;s Muslims. Tolerance towards Muslims ended with increasing Hohenstaufen control. Many oppressive measures, passed by Frederick II, were introduced in order to please the Popes to stop Islam from being practised in Christendom: the result was in a rebellion of Sicily&#x27;s Muslims. This triggered organized and systematic reprisals which marked the final chapter of Islam in Sicily. The rebellion abated, but direct papal pressure induced Frederick to mass transfer all his Muslim subjects deep into the Italian hinterland. In 1224, Frederick II expelled all Muslims from the island transferring many to Lucera (&quot;Lugêrah&quot;, as it was known in Arabic) over the next two decades. In this controlled environment they could not challenge royal authority and they benefited the crown in taxes and military service. Their numbers eventually reached between 15,000 and 20,000, leading Lucera to be called &quot;Lucaera Saracenorum&quot; because it represented the last stronghold of Islamic presence in Italy. During peacetime, Muslims in Lucera were predominantly farmers. They grew durum wheat, barley, legumes, grapes, and other fruits. Muslims also kept bees for honey. The Muslim settlement of Lucera was destroyed by Charles II of Naples with backing from the papacy. The Muslims were either massacred, forcibly converted, enslaved, or exiled. Their abandoned mosques were demolished, and churches were usually built in their place. The Lucera Cathedral was built on the site of a mosque which was destroyed. The mosque was the last one still functioning in medieval Italy by that time. Some were exiled, with many finding asylum in Albania across the Adriatic Sea. Islam was no longer a major presence in the island by the 14th century.

The Aghlabids also conquered the island of Malta at the same time during their invasion of Sicily. Per the Al-Himyari the island was reduced to an uninhabited ruin due to the conquest. The place was later converted into a settlement by Muslims. The Normans conquered it at the same time as Sicily. The Normans however did not interfere in the matters of Muslims of the island and gave them a tributary status. Their conquest however led to the Christianization and Latinization of the island. An annual fine on the Christian community for killing of a Muslim was also repealed in the 12th century, signifying the degradation of the protection given to the Muslims. Most of the Maltese Muslims were deported by 1271. All Maltese Muslims had converted to Christianity by the end of the 15th century and had to find ways to disguise their previous identities by Latinizing or adopting new surnames.

===Mongol invasions===

Genghis Khan, and the later Yuan Emperors of China imposed restrictive decrees which forbade Islamic practices like halal butchering and forced Muslims to follow Mongol methods of butchering animals. As a result of these decrees, Muslims were forced to slaughter sheep in secret. Genghis Khan referred to Muslims as &quot;slaves&quot;, and he also commanded them to follow the Mongol method of eating rather than the halal one. Circumcision was also forbidden. Toward the end of their rule, the corruption of the Mongol court and the persecution of Muslims became so severe that Muslim generals joined Han Chinese in rebelling against the Mongols. The Ming founder Zhu Yuanzhang employed Muslim generals like Lan Yu who rebelled against the Mongols and defeated them in combat. Some Muslim communities were named &quot;kamsia&quot;, which, in Hokkien Chinese, means &quot;thank you&quot;; many Hui Muslims claim that their communities were named &quot;kamsia&quot; because the Han Chinese appreciated the important role which they had played in assisting them to overthrow the Mongols. The Muslims in the Semu class also revolted against the Yuan dynasty in the Ispah Rebellion but the rebellion was crushed and the Muslims were massacred by the Yuan loyalist commander Chen Youding.

Following the brutal Mongol invasion of Central Asia under Genghis Khan, and the sack of Baghdad which occurred in 1258, the Mongol Empire&#x27;s rule extended across most Muslim lands in Asia. The Abbasid caliphate was destroyed and the Islamic civilization suffered much devastation, especially in Mesopotamia, and Tengriism and Buddhism replaced it as the official religions of the empire. However, the Mongols attacked people for goods and riches, not because of their religion. Later, many Mongol khans and rulers such as those of the Oljeitu, the Ilkhanid, and the Golden Horde became Muslims along with their subjects. The Mongols made no real effort to replace Islam with any other religion, they just had the desire to plunder goods from anyone who did not submit to their rule, which was characteristic of Mongol warfare. During the Yuan Dynasty which the Mongols founded in China, Muslim scientists were highly regarded and Muslim beliefs were also respected. Regarding the Mongol attacks, the Muslim historian, ibn al-Athir lamented:

I shrank from giving a recital of these events on the account of their magnitude and abhorrence. Even now I come reluctant to the task, for who would deem it a light thing to sing the death song of Islam and the Muslims or find it easy to tell this tale? O that my mother had not given me birth!

The detailed atrocities during the sack of Baghdad include:
* The Grand Library of Baghdad, which contained countless precious historical documents and books on subjects that ranged from medicine to astronomy, was destroyed. Survivors said that the waters of the Tigris ran black with ink from the enormous quantities of books that were flung into the river.
* Citizens attempted to flee, but they were intercepted by Mongol soldiers who killed them with abandon. Martin Sicker writes that close to 90,000 people may have died (Sicker 2000, p. 111). Other estimates go much higher. Wassaf claims that the loss of life was several hundred thousand. Ian Frazier of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; claims that estimates of the death toll range from 200,000 to one million.
* The Mongols looted and destroyed mosques, palaces, libraries, and hospitals. Grand buildings which had taken generations to build were burned to the ground.
* The caliph was captured and forced to watch as his citizens were murdered and his treasury was plundered. According to most accounts, the caliph was killed by trampling. The Mongols rolled the caliph up in a rug, and rode their horses over him, because they believed that the earth would be offended if it were ever touched by royal blood. All but one of his sons were killed, and the sole surviving son was sent to Mongolia.
* Hulagu had to move his camp upwind from the city, due to the stench of decay that emanated from its ruins.

At the intervention of Hulagu&#x27;s Nestorian Christian wife, Dokuz Khatun, the city&#x27;s Christian inhabitants were spared. Hulagu offered the royal palace to the Nestorian Catholicos Mar Makikha, and he also ordered that a cathedral should be built for him. Ultimately, the seventh ruler of the Ilkhanate, Mahmud Ghazan, converted from Buddhism to Islam, and thus began the gradual decline of Tengrism and Buddhism in the region and its replacement by the renaissance of Islam. Later, three of the four principal Mongol khanates embraced Islam.

Muslim and Jewish paternal cousin marriage was banned by the Yuan dynasty which also forced Muslims to obey Mongol customs like levirate marriage.

===Iberian Peninsula===


Arabs relying largely on Berbers conquered the Iberian Peninsula starting in 711, subduing the whole Visigothic Kingdom by 725. The triumphant Umayyads got conditional capitulations probably in most of the towns, so that they could get a compromise with the native population. This was not always so. For example, Mérida, Cordova, Toledo, or Narbonne were conquered by storm or after laying siege on them. The arrangement reached with the locals was based on respecting the laws and traditions used in each place, so that the &quot;Goths&quot; (a legal concept, not an ethnic one, i.e. the communities ruled by the &quot;Forum Iudicum&quot;) continued to be ruled on new conditions by their own tribunals and laws. The Gothic Church remained in place and collaborated with the new masters. Al-Andalus or Muslim ruled Iberian peninsula, was conquered by northern Christian kingdoms in 1492, as a result of their expansion taking place especially after the definite collapse of the Caliphate of Cordova in 1031.

The coming of the Crusades (starting with the massacre of Barbastro) and similarly entrenched positions on the northern African Almoravids, who took over al-Andalus as of 1086, added to the difficult coexistence between communities, including Muslims in Christian ruled territory, or the Mozarabic rite Christians (quite different from those of the northern kingdoms), and further minority groups. The Almohads, a fanatic north African sect who later occupied al-Andalus, were the only Iberian Muslim rulers to demand conversion, exile, or death from the Christians and Jews.
During the expansion south of the northern Christian kingdoms, depending on the local capitulations, local Muslims were allowed to remain (Mudéjars) with extreme restrictions, while some were peacefully converted to the Christian faith. After the conquest of Granada, all the Spanish Muslims were under Christian rule. The new acquired population spoke Arabic or Mozarabic, and the campaigns to convert them were unsuccessful. Legislation was gradually introduced to remove Islam, culminating with the Muslims being forced to convert to Catholicism by the Spanish Inquisition. They were known as Moriscos and considered New Christians. Further laws were introduced, as on 25 May 1566, stipulating that they &quot;had to abandon the use of Arabic, change their costumes, that their doors must remain open every Friday, and other feast days, and that their baths, public and private, to be torn down.&quot; The reason doors were to be left open so as to determine whether they secretly observed any Islamic festivals. King Philip II of Spain ordered the destruction of all public baths on the grounds of them being relics of infidelity, notorious for their use by Muslims performing their purification rites. The possession of books or papers in Arabic was near concrete proof of disobedience with severe reprisals and penalties. On 1 January 1568, Christian priests were ordered to take all Morisco children between the ages of three and fifteen, and place them in schools, where they were forced to learn Castillian and Christian doctrine. All these laws and measures required force to be implemented, and from much earlier.

Between 1609 and 1614 the Moriscos were expelled from Spain. They were to depart &#x27;under the pain of death and confiscation, without trial or sentence ... to take with them no money, bullion, jewels, or bills of exchange ... just what they could carry.&#x27;

===Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth===
The Lipka Tatars, also known as Polish Tatars or Lithuanian Tatars, were a community of Tatar Muslims who migrated into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and became Polonized.

The Counter-Reformation of the Catholic Church in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth led to persecution of Muslims, Jews, and Orthodox Christians. The ways the Muslims were persecuted included banning the repair of old mosques and preventing new ones from being constructed, banning serfdom of Christians under Muslims, banning marriage of Christian females to Muslims, putting limitations on property ownership among Tatars and the Polish–Ottoman Wars fed into the discriminatory atmosphere against them and led to anti-Islamic writings and attacks.

===Sikh Khalsa and Sikh Empire===

Misr Diwan Chand became the first Hindu governor of Kashmir under Singh and enacted dozens of anti-Muslim laws. He raised the tax levels of Muslim subjects, demolished the Jamia Masjid of Srinagar and prohibited cow slaughter. The punishment for cow slaughter was the death penalty without any exception. Shah Shujah Durrani, the grandson of Ahmad Shah Durrani, wanted to implement similar anti-cow slaughter policies in the Emirate of Afghanistan and with help from Singh and the East India Company regained the Afghan throne and imposed a ban on cow slaughter in Kabul.

Sayyid Ahmed Barelvi declared war against Maharaja Ranjit Singh and recruited many Muslims from madrassas. However the Yousufzai and Muhammadzai Khawaneen did not like his egalitarian ideals and betrayed Sayyid Ahmed Shahid and his army at the battle of Balakot and supported the Sikh Army in the Battle of Balakote in 1831, and Barelvi&#x27;s head was severed by the Sikh General Hari Singh Nalwa.

Muslims still revered Sayyid Ahmed, however he was defeated and killed in the battle by Sikh Army which was commanded by Hari Singh Nalwa and Gulab Singh. Raja Aggar Khan of Rajouri was defeated, humiliated by the Sikh Army commander Gulab Singh and was brought to Lahore where he was beheaded by Gulab Singh of Jammu. Raja Sultan Khan of Bhimber also met the same fate when he was defeated and captured by the Dogra ruler Gulab Singh and brought to Jammu where he was imprisoned. Raja Sultan Khan later died in prison.

=== Dutch East India Company ===

The Dutch East India Company and Japanese samurai they hired as mercenaries committed genocide against Muslim Bandanese on the Banda islands, quartering in their mosques, humiliating their women and beheading their orang kaya in the conquest of the Banda Islands.

In his book &quot;God&#x27;s Shadow&quot;, historian Alan Mikhail posits that the 1492 voyage to the Americas by Columbus was driven in part by Islamophobic views. European Christians arriving in the Americas perceived local customs as being Islamic and used this as a rationale for genociding the indigenous people. Muslims who were brought to the region as slaves, though mistreated, found several ways to hold onto aspects of their faith.

===Bulgaria===


Half a million Muslims succeeded in reaching Ottoman controlled lands and 672,215 of them were reported to have remained after the war. Approximately a quarter of a million of them perished as a result of massacres, cold, disease, and other harsh conditions.
According to Aubaret, the French Consul in Ruse in 1876, in the Danube Vilayet which also included Northern Dobruja in today&#x27;s Romania, as well as a substantial portion of territory in today&#x27;s southern Serbia, there were 1,120,000 Muslims and 1,233,500 non-Muslims of whom 1,150,000 were Bulgarian. Between 1876 and 1878, through massacres, epidemics, hunger, and war, a large portion of the Turkish population vanished. In 1950-1951 around 155,000 left Bulgaria as a result of Islamophobia and Anti-Turkish sentiment.

===Cambodia===
The Cham Muslims experienced serious purges in which as much as half of their community&#x27;s entire population was exterminated by authoritarian communists in Cambodia during the 1970s as part of the Cambodian genocide. About half a million Muslims were killed. According to Cham sources, 132 mosques were destroyed by the Khmer Rouge regime. Only 20 of the 113 most prominent Cham clerics in Cambodia survived the rule of the Khmer Rouge.

===China===

The Dungan revolt erupted due to infighting between Muslim Sufi sects, the Khafiya and the Jahariyya, and the Gedimu. When the rebellion failed, mass-immigration of the Dungan people into Imperial Russia, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan ensued. Before the war, the population of Shaanxi province totalled approximately 13 million inhabitants, at least 1,750,000 of whom were Dungan (Hui). After the war, the population dropped to 7 million; at least 150,000 fled. But once-flourishing Chinese Muslim communities fell 93% in the revolt in Shaanxi province. Between 1648 and 1878, around twelve million Hui and Han Chinese were killed in ten unsuccessful uprisings.

The Ush rebellion in 1765 by Uyghur Muslims against the Manchus of the Qing dynasty occurred after Uyghur women were gang raped by the servants and son of Manchu official Su-cheng. It was said that &quot;Ush Muslims had long wanted to sleep on [Sucheng and son&#x27;s] hides and eat their flesh.&quot; because of the rape of Uyghur Muslim women for months by the Manchu official Sucheng and his son. The Manchu Emperor ordered that the Uyghur rebel town be massacred, the Qing forces enslaved all the Uyghur children and women and slaughtered the Uyghur men. Manchu soldiers and Manchu officials regularly having sex with or raping Uyghur women caused massive hatred and anger by Uyghur Muslims to Manchu rule. The invasion by Jahangir Khoja was preceded by another Manchu official, Binjing who raped a Muslim daughter of the Kokan aqsaqal from 1818 to 1820. The Qing sought to cover up the rape of Uyghur women by Manchus to prevent anger against their rule from spreading among the Uyghurs.

The Manchu official Shuxing&#x27;a started an anti-Muslim massacre which led to the Panthay Rebellion. Shuxing&#x27;a developed a deep hatred of Muslims after an incident where he was stripped naked and nearly lynched by a mob of Muslims. He ordered several Hui Muslim rebels to be slowly sliced to death.

The revolts were harshly suppressed by the Manchu government in a manner that amounts to genocide. Approximately a million people in the Panthay Rebellion were killed, and several million in the Dungan revolt as a &quot;washing off the Muslims&quot;(洗回 (xi Hui)) policy had been long advocated by officials in the Manchu government. Many Muslim generals like Ma Zhanao, Ma Anliang, Ma Qianling, Dong Fuxiang, Ma Haiyan, and Ma Julung helped the Qing dynasty defeat the rebel Muslims, and were rewarded, and their followers were spared from the genocide. The Han Chinese Qing general Zuo Zongtang even relocated the Han from the suburbs Hezhou when the Muslims there surrendered as a reward so that Hezhou (now Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture) is still heavily Muslim to this day and is the most important city for Hui Muslims in China. The Muslims were granted amnesty and allowed to live as long as they stayed outside the city. Some of the Muslims who fought, like General Dong, did not do it because they were Muslim, rather, like many other generals, they gathered bands of followers and fought at will.

Zuo Zongtang generally massacred New Teaching Jahriyya rebels, even if they surrendered, but spared Old Teaching Khafiya and Sunni Gedimu rebels. Ma Hualong belonged to the New Teaching school of thought, and Zuo executed him, while Hui generals belonging to the Old Teaching clique such as Ma Qianling, Ma Zhan&#x27;ao, and Ma Anliang were granted amnesty and even promoted in the Qing military. Moreover, an army of Han Chinese rebels led by Dong Fuxiang surrendered and joined Zuo Zongtang.
General Zuo accepted the surrender of Hui people belonging to the Old Teaching school, provided they surrendered large amounts of military equipment and supplies, and accepted relocation. He refused to accept the surrender of New Teaching Muslims who still believed in its tenets, since the Qing classified them as a dangerous heterodox cult, similar to the White Lotus Buddhists.

The Qing authorities decreed that the Hui rebels who had taken part in violent attacks were merely heretics and not representative of the entire Hui population, just as the heretical White Lotus did not represent all Buddhists. Qing authorities decreed that there were two different Muslim sects, the &quot;old&quot; religion and &quot;new&quot; religion. The new were heretics and deviated from Islam in the same way that the White Lotus deviated from Buddhism and Daoism, and stated its intention to inform the Hui community that it was aware that the original Islamic religion was one united sect before the advent of new &quot;heretics&quot;, saying they would separate Muslim rebels by which sect they belonged to. Zuo also stated that he would accept the surrender of New Teaching Muslims who admitted that they were deceived, radicalized, and misled by its doctrines. Zuo excluded khalifas and mullas from the surrender.

During the Cultural Revolution, mosques along with other religious buildings were often defaced, destroyed, or closed and copies of the Quran were destroyed and cemeteries by the Red Guards. During that time, the government also constantly accused Muslims and other religious groups of holding &quot;superstitious beliefs&quot; and promoting &quot;anti-socialist trends&quot;. The government began to relax its policies toward Muslims in 1978, and supported worship and rituals. Today, Islam is experiencing a modest revival and there are now many mosques in China. There has been an upsurge in Islamic expression and many nationwide Islamic associations have been organized to co-ordinate inter-ethnic activities among Muslims.

However, restrictions have been imposed on Uyghur Islamic practices because the Chinese government has attempted to link Islamic beliefs with terrorist activities since 2001. Numerous events have led the Chinese government to crack down on most displays of Islamic piety among Uyghurs, including the wearing of veils and long beards. The Ghulja Incident and the July 2009 Ürümqi riots were both caused by abusive treatment of Uyghur Muslims within Chinese society, and they resulted in even more extreme government crackdowns. While Hui Muslims are seen as being relatively docile, Uyghurs are stereotyped as Islamists and punished more severely for crimes than Hui are. In 1989, China&#x27;s government banned a book which was titled &quot;Xing Fengsu&quot; (&quot;Sexual Customs&quot;) and placed its authors under arrest after Uyghurs and Hui Muslims protested against its publication in Lanzhou and Beijing because it insulted Islam. Hui Muslims who vandalized property during the protests against the book&#x27;s publication were not punished but Uyghur protestors were imprisoned.

===Fascist Italy===


The Libyan genocide was the systematic destruction of the indigenous Libyan Arab people and culture in Italian Libya by the Italian colonial authorities from 1911 to 1943, using the wider definition of genocide, where an estimated 250,000-750,000 Libyans died as a result of colonial-related causes. The most severe and frequent episodes of Italian atrocities against the locals came during the conflict between Italy and the indigenous rebels of the Senussi Order that lasted from 1923 until 1932, when the principal Senussi leader, Omar Mukhtar, was captured and executed. Italy committed major war crimes during the conflict; including the use of chemical weapons, episodes of refusing to take prisoners of war and instead executing surrendering combatants, and mass executions of civilians. During this period, an estimated 83,000-125,000 Libyans were massacred or died in Italian concentration camps.

===French Algeria===

Some governments and scholars have called the French conquest of Algeria a genocide. Ben Kiernan, an Australian expert on the Cambodian genocide, wrote in &quot;Blood and Soil: A World History of Genocide and Extermination from Sparta to Darfur&quot; on the French conquest of Algeria:

By 1875, the French conquest was complete. The war had killed approximately 825,000 indigenous Algerians since 1830. A long shadow of genocidal hatred persisted, provoking a French author to protest in 1882 that in Algeria, &quot;we hear it repeated every day that we must expel the native and if necessary destroy him.&quot; As a French statistical journal urged five years later, &quot;the system of extermination must give way to a policy of penetration.&quot;

French Algeria became the prototype for a pattern of French colonial rule which has been described as &quot;quasi-apartheid&quot;. Napoleon III oversaw an 1865 decree that allowed Arab and Berber Algerians to request French citizenship – but only if they &quot;renounced their Muslim religion and culture&quot;: by 1913, only 1,557 Muslims had been granted French citizenship. Despite periodic attempts at partial reform, the situation of the &quot;Code de l&#x27;indigénat&quot; persisted until the French Fourth Republic, which began in 1946, but although Muslim Algerians were accorded the rights of citizenship, the system of discrimination was maintained in more informal ways. This &quot;internal system of apartheid&quot; met with considerable resistance from the Muslims affected by it, and is cited as one of the causes of the 1954 insurrection.

In response to France&#x27;s recognition of Armenian genocide, Turkey accused France of committing genocide against 15% of Algeria&#x27;s population.

===Imperial Japan===
Imperial Japanese forces slaughtered, raped, and tortured Rohingya Muslims in a massacre in 1942 and expelled hundreds of thousands of Rohingya into Bengal in British India. The Japanese committed countless acts of rape, murder, and torture against thousands of Rohingyas. During this period, some 220,000 Rohingyas are believed to have crossed the border into Bengal, then part of British India, to escape the violence. Defeated, 40,000 Rohingyas eventually fled to Chittagong after repeated massacres by the Burmese and Japanese forces.

Japanese forces also carried out massacres, torture, and atrocities on Muslim Moro people in Mindanao, and Sulu. A former Japanese Imperial Navy medic, Akira Makino, admitted to carrying out dissections on Moro civilians while they were still alive.

Panglong, a Chinese Muslim town in British Burma, was entirely destroyed by the Japanese invaders in the Japanese invasion of Burma. The Hui Muslim Ma Guanggui became the leader of the Hui Panglong self-defense guard created by Su who was sent by the Kuomintang government of the Republic of China to fight against the Japanese invasion of Panglong in 1942. The Japanese destroyed Panglong, burning it and driving out the over 200 Hui households out as refugees. Yunnan and Kokang received Hui refugees from Panglong driven out by the Japanese. One of Ma Guanggui&#x27;s nephews was Ma Yeye, a son of Ma Guanghua and he narrated the history of Panglang including the Japanese attack. An account of the Japanese attack on the Hui in Panglong was written and published in 1998 by a Hui from Panglong called &quot;Panglong Booklet&quot;. The Japanese attack in Burma caused the Hui Mu family to seek refuge in Panglong but they were driven out again to Yunnan from Panglong when the Japanese attacked Panglong.

The Hui Muslim county of Dachang was subjected to slaughter by the Japanese.

During the Second Sino-Japanese war the Japanese followed what has been referred to as a &quot;killing policy&quot; and destroyed many mosques. According to Wan Lei, &quot;Statistics showed that the Japanese destroyed 220 mosques and killed countless Hui people by April 1941.&quot; After the Rape of Nanking mosques in Nanjing were found to be filled with dead bodies. They also followed a policy of economic oppression which involved the destruction of mosques and Hui communities and made many Hui jobless and homeless. Another policy was one of deliberate humiliation. This included soldiers smearing mosques with pork fat, forcing Hui to butcher pigs to feed the soldiers, and forcing girls to supposedly train as geishas and singers but in fact made them serve as sex slaves. Hui cemeteries were destroyed for military reasons. Many Hui fought in the war against Japan.

The Japanese brought Indonesian Javanese girls to British Borneo as comfort women to be raped by Japanese officers at the Ridge road school and Basel Mission Church, and the Telecommunication Center Station (former rectory of the All Saints Church) in Kota Kinabalu as well as ones in Balikpapan and Beaufort. Japanese soldiers raped Indonesian women and Dutch women in the Netherlands East Indies. They got infected with STDs.

Sukarno prostituted Indonesian girls from ethnic groups like Minangkabau to the Japanese.

The Japanese massacred Hui Muslims in their mosques in Nanjing and destroyed Hui mosques in other parts of China. Shen Xi’en and his father Shen Decheng witnessed the corpses of Hui Muslims slaughtered by the Japanese in Nanjing, when he was asked by Hui people to help bury their relatives. The Hui security maintenance leader Sun Shurong and Hui Imams Zhang Zihui, Ma Zihe, Ge Changfa, Wang Shouren, Ma Changfa were involved in collecting Hui corpses and burying them after the Nanjing massacre. The Ji&#x27;e lane Mosque caretaker father Zhang was in his 60s when killed by the Japanese and his decomposing corpse was the first to be washed ina ccording to Islamic custome and buried. They buried the Hui corpses in Jiuhua mountain, Dongguashi, Hongtu Bridge (where Guangzhou road is now located), Wutai mountain, Donguashi (where Nanjing Normal University is located). Shen Xi&#x27;en helped bury  400 Hui bodies including children, women and men. Shen recalled burying  a 7 or 8 year old boy in addition to his mother among the Hui bodies.

Japanese used machine guns to massacre Muslim Suluk children and women at a mosque in the aftermath of the Jesselton revolt.

===Indonesia===

The Walisongo school massacre was the slaughter carried out by Christian militants on May 28, 2000, upon several predominantly Muslim villages around Poso town, Central Sulawesi, Indonesia as part of a broader sectarian conflict in the Poso region. Officially, the total number killed in the attacks is 367.

===Syria===
The Hama massacre () was a genocidal campaign of extermination launched by Ba&#x27;athist Syria in February 1982, under orders of Syrian dictator Hafez al-Assad to crush an uprising by the Muslim Brotherhood in Sunni-majority town of Hama. Hama was besieged for 27 days by Syrian military and Ba&#x27;athist paramilitaries, during which period the city was isolated from the outside. The ground operations of the massacre were supervised by Rifaat al-Assad, the brother of Hafez al-Assad, who commanded sectarian Alawite deathsquads such as the Defense Companies.

Prior to the start of operations, Hafez al-Assad issued orders to seal off Hama from the outside world; effectively imposing a media blackout, total shut down of communications, electricity and food supplies to the city for months. Then the massacre campaign was launched, which involved indiscriminate attacks, military bombardment, aerial attacks, etc. The indiscriminate bombings and mass-shootings by paramilitaries had razed much of the city to the ground and killed tens of thousands of civilians. Patrick Seale, reporting in &quot;The Globe and Mail,&quot; described the operation as a &quot;two-week orgy of killing, destruction and looting&quot; which destroyed the city and killed a minimum of 25,000 inhabitants. However, contemporary estimates put the total death toll to at least 40,000 civilians. The massacre is the &quot;single deadliest act&quot; of violence perpetrated by any Arab regime upon its own population, in Modern Arab history.

The attack has been described as a &quot;genocidal massacre&quot; which was motivated by anti-Sunni sectarianism of Alawite-dominated elites of the Arab Socialist Ba&#x27;ath party. The militant secularist ideology of neo-Ba&#x27;athism which advocated the elimination of religion and establishment of socialism in the society also played a role in the brutality of the massacre. Memory of the massacre remains an important aspect of Syrian culture and evokes strong emotions amongst Syrians to the present day. Women, children and all Hama inhabitants irrespective of their political leanings were targeted indiscriminately during the military onslaught. Even Ba&#x27;ath party members and their families became victims of slaughter and mass-shootings of Rifaat al-Assad&#x27;s paramilitaries. Internationally, the Hama massacre became a symbol of the Assad regime&#x27;s brutal repression and disregard of civilian lives.

===Myanmar===

Myanmar has a Buddhist majority. The Muslim minority in Myanmar mostly consists of the Rohingya people and the descendants of Muslim immigrants from India (including the modern-day nations of Bangladesh) and China (the ancestors of Chinese Muslims in Myanmar came from Yunnan province), as well as the descendants of earlier Arab and Persian settlers. Indian Muslims were brought to Burma by the British in order to aid them in clerical work and business. After independence, many Muslims retained their previous positions and achieved prominence in business and politics.

At first, the Buddhist persecution of Muslims arose for religious reasons, and it occurred during the reign of King Bayinnaung, 1550–1589 AD. He also disallowed the Eid al-Adha, the religious sacrifice of cattle, regarding the killing of animals in the name of religion as a cruel custom. Halal food was also forbidden by King Alaungpaya in the 18th century.

When General Ne Win swept to power on a wave of nationalism in 1962, the status of Muslims changed for the worse. Muslims were expelled from the army and rapidly marginalized. Many Rohingya Muslims fled Burma as refugees and inundated neighbouring Bangladesh including 200,000 who fled Burma in 1978 as a result of the King Dragon operation in Arakan and 250,000 in 1991.

A widely publicized Burmese conflict was the 2012 Rakhine State riots, a series of clashes that primarily involved the ethnic Rakhine Buddhist people and the Rohingya Muslim people in the northern Rakhine State – an estimated 90,000 people were displaced as a result of the riots.

Myanmar&#x27;s pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi was accused of failing to protect Myanmar&#x27;s Rohingya Muslims during the 2016–17 persecution. State crime experts from Queen Mary University of London warned that Suu Kyi is &quot;legitimising genocide&quot; in Myanmar.

Some buddhist leaders in Myanmar such as Ashin Wirathu promote violence against Muslims.

===Nazi Germany===

Nazi ideology&#x27;s racial theories considered ethnic groups which were associated with Islam to be &quot;racially inferior&quot;, particularly Arabs.

During the invasion of France, thousands of Muslims, both Arabs and sub-Saharan Africans, who were serving in French colonial units were captured by the Germans. Massacres of these men were widespread, the most notable of these massacres was committed against Moroccans by Waffen-SS troops during the fighting which occurred around Cambrai, the Moroccans were killed in mass after they were driven from the outskirts of the city and surrendered. In Erquinvillers, another major massacre was committed against captured Muslim Senegalese troops by Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS troops.

During Operation Barbarossa, the Einsatzgruppen engaged in the mass execution of over 140,000 Soviet POWs, many of whom were killed because they had &quot;Asiatic features&quot;. Civilian Muslim men were often mistaken for Jews and killed due to the fact that they had previously been circumsized. In 1942 in Amersfoort in the Netherlands, 101 Soviet Uzbek Muslim soldiers were massacred by Nazi Germans after they were forced into a concentration camp and displayed to the local Dutch people as proof the Soviets were made out of &quot;untermenschen&quot;.
Various Muslim ethnic groups were targeted for extermination, such as the Turkmens.

===Philippines===

The Philippines is a predominantly Christian society with a complicated history of relations between Islam and Christianity. Despite historic evidence of Islamization spreading throughout the islands in the 13th–16th centuries, the archipelago came under Spanish rule in the 16th century. The Spanish proselytized many natives, and labelled those who remained Muslims as &quot;Moro&quot;, a derogatory term recalling the Moors, an Islamic people of North Africa who occupied parts of Spain for several centuries. Today, this term &quot;Moro&quot; is used to refer to the indigenous Muslim tribes and ethnic groups of the country. When the Spanish came to the Philippine islands, most of the natives in Luzon and Visayas were pagans with Muslim minorities, and while Spanish proselytized many natives, many Muslims in Luzon and Visayas were not exempted by the Spaniards from the Spanish Inquisition, wherein Muslims to become Catholics or else die for their faith. Those who remained Muslims are only the natives of Mindanao and Sulu which the Spaniards failed to subjugate, or had control of only briefly and partially.

The Spanish–Moro Wars between Spanish colonial authorities and the indigenous Sultanates of the Moro peoples (the Sultanate of Sulu, confederation of sultanates in Lanao and Sultanate of Maguindanao) further escalated tensions between the Christian and Muslim groups of the country. The Moros fought in the Moro Rebellion against the Americans during which Americans massacred Moro women and children at the Moro Crater massacre, against the Japanese in World War II, and are waging an insurgency against the Philippines.

The pro-Philippine government Ilaga militia, composed of Catholic and other Christian settlers on Moro land in Mindanao, were known for their atrocities and massacres against Moro civilians. The Ilaga&#x27;s bloodiest attack happened in June 1971 when they slaughtered 65 Moro civilians in a Mosque during the Manili massacre. On 24 September 1974, in the Malisbong massacre, the Armed Forces of the Philippines slaughtered about 1,500 Moro Muslim civilians who were praying in a Mosque, in addition to mass raping Moro girls who had been taken aboard a boat.

Polls have shown that some non-Muslim Filipinos hold negative views directed against the Moro people.

===Russia===
====Russian Empire====

The period from the conquest of Kazan in 1552 to the ascension of Catherine the Great in 1762, was marked by systematic repression of Muslims through policies of exclusion and discrimination as well as the destruction of Muslim culture by elimination of outward manifestations of Islam such as mosques. The first wave of persecution and forced conversions of Muslims to Christianity occurred soon after the Russian conquest of the Kazan and Astrakhan Khanates.

Another period of intense mosque destruction and anti-Muslim oppression from the Russian authorities occurred during the 18th century. During the reign of Anna of Russia, many Muslims were forced or pressured to convert. New converts were exempted from paying taxes, were granted certain privileges, and were given better resources for the learning of their new faith. Many continued to secretly practice Islam and were crypto-Muslims.

The Russians initially demonstrated a willingness in allowing Islam to flourish as Muslim clerics were invited into the various region to preach to the Muslims, particularly the Kazakhs whom the Russians viewed as &quot;savages&quot; and &quot;ignorant&quot; of morals and ethics. However, Russian policy shifted toward weakening Islam by introducing pre-Islamic elements of collective consciousness. Such attempts included methods of eulogizing pre-Islamic historical figures and imposing a sense of inferiority by sending Kazakhs to highly elite Russian military institutions. In response, Kazakh religious leaders attempted to bring religious fervor by espousing pan-Turkism, though many were persecuted as a result.

While total expulsion as in other Christian nations such as Spain, Portugal, and Sicily was not feasible to achieve a homogeneous Russian Orthodox population, other policies such as land grants and the promotion of migration by other Russian and non-Muslim populations into Muslim lands displaced many Muslims making them minorities in places such as some parts of the South Ural region to other parts such as the Ottoman Turkey, and almost annihilating the Circassians, Crimean Tatars, and various Muslims of the Caucasus. The Russian army rounded up people, driving Muslims from their villages to ports on the Black Sea, where they awaited ships provided by the neighbouring Ottoman Empire. The explicit Russian goal was to expel the groups in question from their lands. They were given a choice as to where to be resettled: in the Ottoman Empire or in Russia far from their old lands. Only a small percentage (the numbers are unknown) accepted resettlement within the Russian Empire. The trend of Russification has continued at different paces during the remaining Tsarist period and under the Soviet Union, so that today there are more Tatars living outside the Republic of Tatarstan than inside it.

Alexander Suvorov announced the capture of Ismail in 1791 to the Tsarina Catherine in a doggerel couplet, after the assault had been pressed from house to house, room to room, and nearly every Muslim man, woman, and child in the city had been killed in three days of uncontrolled massacre, 40,000 Turks dead, a few hundred taken into captivity. For all his bluffness, Suvorov later told an English traveller that when the massacre was over he went back to his tent and wept.

During the Circassian genocide, German general Grigory Zass in the Russian army sent the severed Circassian heads to his fellow Germans in Berlin who were professors and used them to study anatomy. The Decembrist said that Zass cleaned and boiled the flesh off the heads after storing them under his bed in his tent. He also had Circassian heads outside of his tent impaled on lances on a hill. Circassian men&#x27;s corpses were decapitated by Russian-Cossack women on the battlefield after the battles were over for the heads to be sent to Zass for collection. Zass erected Circassian heads on poles outside of his tent and witnesses saw the wind blowing the beards of the heads. Russian soldiers and Cossacks were paid for sending Circassian heads to General Zass. Besides cutting Circassian heads off and collecting them, Zass employed a deliberate strategy of annihilating Circassian en masse, burning entire Circassian villages with the people in it and encouraging violation of Circassian women and children. Zass&#x27; forces referred to all Circassian elderly, children women, and men as &quot;Bandits, &quot;plunderers&quot;, or &quot;thieves&quot; and the Russian empire&#x27;s forces were commanded by ferociously partholofical officers who commanded political dissidents and criminals. Cossacks raped Circassian women and impregnated them with children. Circassian children were scared of Zass and he was called the devil (Iblis) by the Circassians.

Russians raped Circassian girls during the 1877 Russo-Turkish war from the Circassian refugees who were settled in the Ottoman Balkans. Circassian girls were sold into Turkish harems by their relatives. Circassians also raped and murdered Bulgarians during the 1877 Russo-Turkish war. Circassian women in the Balkans were raped by Russian soldiers in the Russo-Turkish war of 1877.

Zass worked with another German officer in the Russian army named Georg Andreas von Rosen during the genocide against the Circassians. Zass wrote letters to Rosen proudly admitting he ordered Cossacks to slaughter Circassian civilians. Russia was ruled by Tsars from the German House of Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov and military officer ranks were filled with Germans from the Baltic German nobility.

====Soviet Union====

The Soviet Union was hostile to all forms of religion, which was &quot;the opium of the masses&quot; in accordance with Marxist ideology. Relative religious freedom existed for Muslims in the years following the revolution, but in the late 1920s the Soviet government took a strong anti-religious turn. Many mosques were closed or torn down. During the period of Joseph Stalin&#x27;s leadership, Crimean Tatar, Chechen, Ingush, Balkar, Karachay, and Meskhetian Turk Muslims were victims of mass deportation. Though it principally targeted ethno-religious minorities, the deportations were officially based on alleged collaborationism during the Nazi occupation of Crimea. The deportation began on 17 May 1944 in all Crimean inhabited localities. More than 32,000 NKVD troops participated in this action. 193,865 Crimean Tatars were deported, 151,136 of them to Uzbek SSR, 8,597 to Mari ASSR, 4,286 to Kazakh SSR, the rest 29,846 to the various oblasts of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.

From May to November, 10,105 Crimean Tatars died of starvation in Uzbekistan (7% of deported to Uzbek SSR). Nearly 30,000 (20%) died in exile during the year and a half by the NKVD data and nearly 46% by the data of the Crimean Tatar activists. According to Soviet dissident information, many Crimean Tatars were made to work in the large-scale projects conducted by the Soviet Gulag system of slave labour camps.

===South-eastern Europe (Balkans)===


As the Ottoman Empire entered a permanent phase of decline in the late 17th century it was engaged in a protracted state of conflict, losing territories both in Europe and the Caucasus. The victors were the Christian states, the old Habsburg and Romanov Empires, and the new nation-states of Greece, Serbia, Romania, and Bulgaria. Rival European powers encouraged the development of nationalist ideologies among the Ottoman subjects in which the Muslims were portrayed as an ethnic &quot;fifth column&quot; left over from a previous era that could not be integrated into the planned future states. The struggle to rid themselves of Ottomans became an important element of the self-identification of the Christians of the Balkans.

According to Mark Levene, the Victorian public in the 1870s paid much more attention to the massacres and expulsions of Christians than to massacres and expulsions of Muslims, even if on a greater scale. He further suggests that such massacres were even favoured by some circles. Mark Levene also argues that the dominant powers, by supporting &quot;nation-statism&quot; at the Congress of Berlin, legitimized &quot;the primary instrument of Balkan nation-building&quot;: ethnic cleansing. Hall points out that atrocities were committed by all sides during the Balkan conflicts. Deliberate terror was designed to instigate population movements out of particular territories. The aim of targeting the civilian population was to carve ethnically homogeneous countries.

Muslims were forced to leave Principality of Serbia in 1862. Muslim Albanians, along smaller numbers of urban Turks (some with Albanian heritage), were expelled by the Serb army from most parts of the Sanjak of Niş and fled to the Kosovo Vilayet and Macedonia during and after the Serbian–Ottoman War (1876–78). An estimated 49–130,000 Albanians were either expelled, fled and/or retreated from the captured areas seeking refuge in Ottoman Kosovo. The departure of the Albanian population from these regions was done in a manner that today would be characterized as ethnic cleansing.

Justin McCarty estimates that between 1821 and 1922 around five and a half million Muslims were driven out of Europe and five million more were killed or died of disease and starvation while fleeing. Cleansing occurred as a result of the Serbian and Greek independence in the 1820s and 1830s, the Russo-Turkish War 1877–1878, and culminating in the Balkan Wars 1912–1913. Mann describes these acts as &quot;murderous ethnic cleansing on stupendous scale not previously seen in Europe&quot; referring to the 1914 Carnegie Endowment report. It is estimated that at the turn of the 20th century there were 4,4 million Muslims living in the Balkan regions under Ottoman control. More than one million Muslims left the Balkans in the last three decades of the 19th century. Between 1912 and 1926 nearly 2.9 million Muslims were either killed or forced to emigrate to Turkey.

Between 10,000 and 30,000 Turks were killed in Tripolitsa by Greek rebels in the summer of 1821, including the entire Jewish population of the city. Similar events as these occurred elsewhere during the Greek Revolution resulting in the eradication and expulsion of virtually the entire Turkish population of the Morea. These acts ensured the ethnic homogenization of the area under the rule of the future modern Greek state. According to claims by Turkish delegations, in 1878 the Muslim inhabitants in Thessaly are estimated to be 150,000 and in 1897 the Muslims numbered 50,000 in Crete. By 1919 there were virtually no Muslims left in Thessaly and only 20,000 in Crete.

In the Bulgarian insurgency of the April Uprising in 1876 an estimate of 1,000 Muslims were killed. During the Russo-Turkish War large numbers of Turks were either killed, perished, or became refugees. There are different estimates about the casualties of the war. Crampton describes an exodus of 130,000–150,000 expelled of which approximately half returned for an intermediary period encouraged by the Congress of Berlin. Hupchick and McCarthy point out that 260,000 perished and 500,000 became refugees. The Turkish scholars Karpat and Ipek argue that up to 300,000 were killed and 1–1.5 million were forced to emigrate. Members of the European press who covered the war in Bulgaria reported on the Russian atrocities against Muslims. Witness accounts from Schumla and Razgrad describe children, women, and elderly wounded by sabres and lances. They stated that the entire Muslim population of many villages had been massacred. Recently uncovered photographs in the archive of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs from the Russo-Turkish War 1877–1878 show the massacre of Muslims by the Russians in the region of Stara Zagora claiming to have affected some 20,000 Muslim civilians.

Massacres against Turks and Muslims during the Balkan Wars in the hands of Bulgarians, Greeks, and Armenians are described in detail in the 1912 Carnegie Endowment report. The Bulgarian violence during the Balkan War included burning of villages, transforming mosques into churches, rape of women, and mutilation of bodies. It is estimated that 220,000 Pomaks were forcefully Christianized and forbidden to wear Islamic religious clothing.

During World War II, the Chetniks, a Yugoslav Royalist and Serbian nationalist movement, committed numerous war crimes primarily directed against the non-Serb population of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia explicitly ordering the ethnic cleansing, mainly 29,000–33,000 Muslims were killed.

Also during World War II, Muslims faced sporadic but significant and violent persecution at the hands of the Croatian fascist Ustaše movement in the Independent State of Croatia. Despite Ustaše overtures and positive propaganda towards Muslims, the government in Zagreb in reality staunchly favored Catholics in the military, government and ministry positions, with Muslim militias being regarded as little more than cannon fodder with little to no combat effectiveness. Catholics held the vast majority of high ranking government offices, leading to complaints and protests from Muslim religious leaders. The archbishop of Sarajevo had stated that the situation had become critical for Muslims due to violent persecution from both the Serbian Chetniks and Croatian fascists. According to some reports, as many as 100,000 Muslims had been killed and 250,000 displaced by the Ustaše by 1943. There were also reports of forced conversions of Muslims to Catholicism. One German officer reportedly remarked that “the Muslims bear the special status of being persecuted by all others.”

===Tatarstan===
The 1921–1922 famine in Tatarstan was a period of mass starvation and drought that took place in the Tatar ASSR as a result of war communism policy, in which 500,000 to 2,000,000 peasants died. The event was part of the greater Russian famine of 1921–1922 that affected other parts of the USSR, in which up 5,000,000 people died in total. According to Roman Serbyn, a professor of Russian and East European history, the Tatarstan famine was the first man-made famine in the Soviet Union and systematically targeted ethnic minorities such as Volga Tatars and Volga Germans. The 1921–1922 famine in Tatarstan has been compared to Holodomor in Ukraine, and in 2008, the All-Russian Tatar Social Center (VTOTs) asked the United Nations to condemn the 1921–22 Tatarstan famine as genocide of Muslim Tatars.

===Turkey===
During World War One, both Turks and Kurds were killed by Russians, Assyrians and Armenians in the eastern provinces of the Ottoman Empire, however, this was mainly in retaliation for Turkish persecution of Christians (Armenian genocide and Greek genocide).

On 14 May 1919, the Greek army landed in İzmir (Smyrna), which marked the beginning of the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922). During the war, the Greek side committed a number of atrocities in western provinces (such as İzmir, Manisa, and Uşak), the local Muslim population was subjected to massacre, ravaging and rape.

The Republic of Turkey was founded on a strict interpretation of secularism by the war-hero turned statesman, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. In the early republican era, the revolutionary Kemalist government had sought to actively de-Islamize society and turn Turkey into a fully Westernized country. The Kemalists had perceived religion, Islam in particular, to be a force of backwardness. As such, they cracked down on many outward expressions of Islam, whether orthodox or heterodox-folk manifestations of it. They wanted religion to be solely limited to the &quot;conscience of individuals&quot;. The fifth Turkish prime minister, Şükrü Saracoğlu, had allegedly desired the abolition of religion altogether through government restrictions. The government had all shariah courts (including those relating to personal civil law) and traditional madrasas dissolved. The teaching of Arabic, and the Arabic adhaan, was also banned. The fez (an Ottoman Islamic head gear) was also banned, with European hats being mandated instead. Those who opposed this mandate were dealt with harshly. However, the military regime under Kenan Evren had softened its stance on Islam, seeing it as an alternative to communism. The Turkish generals had also promoted Turkish-Sunni Islam to counter Islamism, amidst the Iranian Revolution.

===Vietnam===
The Vietnamese Emperor Minh Mạng unleashed persecution of Cham Muslims after he conquered the final remnants of Champa in 1832. The Vietnamese coercively fed lizard and pig meat to Cham Muslims and cow meat to Cham Hindus against their will to punish them and assimilate them to Vietnamese culture.

==Current situation==

===Africa===
==== Burkina Faso ====
On 11 October 2019 a mass shooting occurred in a mosque in northern Burkina Faso which left 16 people dead and two injured. It happened while the residents were praying inside the Grand Mosque in Salmossi, a village close to the border with Mali. &quot;AFP&quot; reported that 13 people died on the spot while 3 died later due to the injuries.

==== Central African Republic ====
During the internal armed conflict in the Central African Republic in 2013, anti-balaka militiamen were targeting Bangui&#x27;s Muslim neighbourhoods and Muslim ethnic groups such as the Fulas.

Early 2014 marked a turning point; hardened by war and massacres, the anti-balaka committed multiple atrocities. In 2014, Amnesty International reported several massacres committed by anti-balaka against Muslim civilians, forcing thousands of Muslims to flee the country.

On 24 June 2014, anti-balaka gunmen killed 17 Muslim Fula people at a camp in Bambari. Some of the bodies were mutilated and burnt by the assailants.

On 11 October 2017, 25 Muslim civilians were massacred by anti-balaka militiamen inside a mosque in the town of Kembe.

==== Chad ====
In February 1979, anti-Muslim riots occurred in southern Chad, as a result hundreds or thousands of Muslim civilians died.

==== Ethiopia ====
In April 2022, a group of Christian extremists opened fire at a Muslim funeral, killing more than 20 people. Amidst sectarian tensions, two mosques were burnt down and another two were damaged.

==== Mali ====
On 23 March 2019, several attacks by gunmen killed at least 160 and injured at least 55 Muslim Fulani herdsmen, because of the allegations that the villagers were involved in supporting Islamic terrorism. Two villages, Ogossagou and Welingara, were particularly affected.

===Asia===

====Azerbaijan====
In Nardaran, a deadly incident broke out in 2015 between Azerbaijan security forces and religious Shia residents in which two policemen and four suspected Shia Muslim militants were killed.

As a result of this incident, the Azerbaijani parliament passed laws prohibiting people with religious education received abroad to implement Islamic rites and ceremonies in Azerbaijan, as well as to preach in mosques and occupy leading positions in the country; as well as prohibiting the display of religious paraphernalia, flags, and slogans, except in places of worship, religious centers, and offices. Ashura festivities in public have also been banned. The Azerbaijani government also passed a law to remove the citizenship of Azerbaijani citizens who fight abroad.

The Azerbaijan authorities cracked down on observant Sunni Muslims.

====China====
===== Hainan Island =====
Hainan is China&#x27;s southernmost region inhabited by the Utsul Muslim population of approximately 10,000. In September 2020, the hijab was banned from schools in the region.

Earlier in 2019, a CCP document titled &quot;Working Document regarding the strengthening of overall governance over Huixin and Huihui Neighbourhood&quot; described a number of measures to be taken on the Utsuls, including increased surveillance of residents in Muslim neighbourhoods, ban on traditional dress in schools and government offices, rebuilding of mosques to a smaller size and without &quot;Arabic tendencies&quot;, removal of Arabic script from shopfronts, along with words like &quot;halal&quot; and &quot;Islamic&quot;.

===== Tibet =====
When Hui started migrating into Lhasa in the 1990s, rumours circulated among Tibetans in Lhasa about the Hui, such as that they were cannibals or ate children. In February 2003, Tibetans rioted against Hui, destroying Hui-owned shops and restaurants. Local Tibetan Buddhist religious leaders led a regional boycott movement that encouraged Tibetans to boycott Hui-owned shops, spreading the myth that Hui put the ashes of cremated imams in the cooking water they used to serve Tibetans food, in order to convert Tibetans to Islam.

In Tibet, the majority of Muslims are Hui people. Hatred between Tibetans and Muslims stems from events during the Muslim warlord Ma Bufang&#x27;s oppressive rule in Qinghai such as Ngolok rebellions (1917–49) and the Sino-Tibetan War, but in 1949 the Communists put an end to the violence between Tibetans and Muslims, however, new Tibetan-Muslim violence broke out after China engaged in liberalization. Riots broke out between Muslims and Tibetans over incidents such as bones in soups and prices of balloons, and Tibetans accused Muslims of being cannibals who cooked humans in their soup and of contaminating food with urine. Tibetans attacked Muslim restaurants. Fires set by Tibetans which burned the apartments and shops of Muslims resulted in Muslim families being killed and wounded in the 2008 mid-March riots. Due to Tibetan violence against Muslims, the traditional Islamic white caps have not been worn by many Muslims. Scarfs were removed and replaced with hairnets by Muslim women in order to hide. Muslims prayed in secret at home when in August 2008 the Tibetans burned the Mosque. Incidents such as these which make Tibetans look bad on the international stage are covered up by the Tibetan exile community. The repression of Tibetan separatism by the Chinese government is supported by Hui Muslims. In addition, Chinese-speaking Hui have problems with Tibetan Hui (the Tibetan speaking Kache minority of Muslims).

On 8 October 2012, a mob of about 200 Tibetan monks beat a dozen Dungans (Hui Muslims) in Luqu County, Gansu province, in retaliation for the Chinese Muslim community&#x27;s application to build a mosque in the county.

The main Mosque in Lhasa was burned down by Tibetans and Chinese Hui Muslims were violently assaulted by Tibetan rioters in the 2008 Tibetan unrest. Tibetan exiles and foreign scholars like ignore and do not talk about sectarian violence between Tibetan Buddhists and Muslims. The majority of Tibetans viewed the wars against Iraq and Afghanistan after 9/11 positively and it had the effect of galvanizing anti-Muslim attitudes among Tibetans and resulted in an anti-Muslim boycott against Muslim owned businesses. Tibetan Buddhists propagate a false libel that Muslims cremate their Imams and use the ashes to convert Tibetans to Islam by making Tibetans inhale the ashes, even though the Tibetans seem to be aware that Muslims practice burial and not cremation since they frequently clash against proposed Muslim cemeteries in their area.

Since the Chinese government supports and backs up the Hui Muslims, the Tibetans deliberately attack the Hui Muslims as a way to demonstrate anti-government sentiment and because they have a background of sectarian violence against each other since Ma Bufang&#x27;s rule due to their separate religions and ethnicity and Tibetans resent Hui economic domination.

===== Xinjiang =====

The city of Karamay has banned Islamic beards, headwear, and clothing on buses. China&#x27;s far-western Xinjiang province have passed a law to prohibit residents from wearing burqas in public. China has also banned Ramadan fasting for Chinese Communist Party (CCP) members in certain parts of Xinjiang. Amnesty International has said Uyghurs face widespread discrimination in employment, housing, and educational opportunities, as well as curtailed religious freedom and political marginalization. Uyghurs who choose to practice their faith can only use a state-approved version of the Koran; men who work in the state sector cannot wear beards and women cannot wear headscarves. The Chinese state controls the management of all mosques, which many Uyghurs feel stifles religious traditions that have formed a crucial part of their identity for centuries. Children under the age of 18 are not allowed to attend religious services at mosques. According to Radio Free Asia in April 2017, the CCP banned Islamic names such as &quot;Saddam&quot;, &quot;Hajj&quot;, and &quot;Medina&quot; for babies born in Xinjiang. Since 2017, it is alleged that China has destroyed or damaged 16,000 mosques in China&#x27;s Xinjiang province – 65% of the region&#x27;s total.

According to human rights organizations and western media Uyghurs face discrimination and religious persecution at the hands of the government authorities. In a 2013 news article, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported, &quot;Many Uighurs are also convinced that Beijing is seeking to wipe out their language and culture through assimilation and education policies that favor Mandarin over Uighur in schools and government jobs. Civil servants can be fired for joining Friday afternoon prayer services, and Uighur college students say they are often required to eat lunch in school cafeterias during the holy month of Ramadan, when observant Muslims fast.&quot;
Chinese authorities have confiscated passports from all residents in largely Muslim region of Xinjiang, populated by Turkic-speaking Uyghurs.

In August 2018, the United Nations said that credible reports had led it to estimate that up to a million Uighurs and other Muslims were being held in &quot;something that resembles a massive internment camp that is shrouded in secrecy&quot;. The U.N.&#x27;s International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination said that some estimates indicated that up to 2 million Uighurs and other Muslims were held in &quot;political camps for indoctrination&quot;, in a &quot;no-rights zone&quot;. Conditions in Xinjiang had deteriorated that they were described by political scientists as &quot;Orwellian&quot;.

These so-called &quot;re-education&quot; camps and later, &quot;vocational training centres&quot;, were described by the government for &quot;rehabilitation and redemption&quot; to combat terrorism and religious extremism. In response to the UN panel&#x27;s finding of indefinite detention without due process, the Chinese government delegation officially conceded that it was engaging in widespread &quot;resettlement and re-education&quot; and State media described the controls in Xinjiang as &quot;intense&quot;.

On 31 August 2018, the United Nations committee called on the Chinese government to &quot;end the practice of detention without lawful charge, trial, and conviction&quot;, to release the detained persons, to provide specifics as to the number of interred individuals and the reasons for their detention, and to investigate the allegations of &quot;racial, ethnic, and ethno-religious profiling&quot;. A BBC report quoted an unnamed Chinese official as saying that &quot;Uighurs enjoyed full rights&quot; but also admitting that &quot;those deceived by religious extremism... shall be assisted by resettlement and re-education&quot;. On 10 September 2018, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet urged China to allow observers into Xinjiang and expressed concern about the situation there. She said that: &quot;The UN rights group had shown that Uyghurs and other Muslims are being detained in camps across Xinjiang and I expect discussions with Chinese officials to begin soon&quot;.

The U.S. Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act of 2020 imposes sanctions on foreign individuals and entities responsible for human rights violations in China&#x27;s Xinjiang region.

====India====


Communalism and communal violence is a longstanding problem in Indian society, especially between Hindus and Muslims. Scholars have observed that in the Hindu–Muslim communal riots in India, it is invariably Muslims who suffer the greatest losses. Proportionately more Muslims are killed and more Muslim property is destroyed. In 1961, first major riots took place in Jabalpur. In 1964 there were riots in Jamshedpur and Rourkela. Major riots took place in Ranchi, Bihar in 1967 and in Ahmedabad, Gujarat in 1969. In the 1970s and 1980s major communal riots took place. In many of these riots nearly 1,000 Muslims were killed. In 1992–93, riots took place in Bombay in which 50 Muslims perished. From 1992 to 2003 the Muslim community faced a series of communal riots, among which the most serious was the Babri mosque incident.

The 2002 Gujarat riots were a series of incidents starting with the Godhra train burning and the subsequent communal violence between Hindus and Muslims in the Indian state of Gujarat. On 27 February 2002, an allegedly Muslim mob burnt the Sabarmati Express train and 58 Hindus including 25 women and 15 children were burnt to death. Frontline claimed that the blame of train burning was put on Muslims, while larger sections of media reported that it was Muslim mob which burnt the train. Attacks against Muslims and general communal riots arose on a large scale across the state, in which 790 Muslims and 254 Hindus were ultimately killed; 223 more people were reported missing. 536 places of worship were damaged: 273 dargahs, 241 mosques and 19 temples. Muslim-owned businesses suffered the bulk of the damage. 6,000 Muslims and 10,000 Hindus fled their homes. Preventive arrests of 17,947 Hindus and 3,616 Muslims were made. In total, 27,901 Hindus and 7,651 Muslims were arrested.

The 2020 Delhi riots, which left more than 53 dead and hundreds injured including both Hindus and Muslims, were triggered by protests against a citizenship law seen by many critics as anti-Muslim and part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi&#x27;s Hindu nationalist agenda. According to Ashutosh Varshney, the director of the Center for Contemporary South Asia at Brown University, “on the whole, the Delhi riots ... are now beginning to look like a pogrom, à la Gujarat 2002 and Delhi 1984”. According to Subir Sinha, a senior lecturer at the SOAS University of London, the north and northeast areas of Delhi were a focus of &quot;highly inflammatory speeches from top BJP ministers and politicians&quot; in the run-up to the Delhi election. Sinha continues that &quot;the pent-up anger of BJP supporters&quot; who lost the election in Delhi, effectively took it out on &quot;the Muslim residents of these relatively poor parts of the city&quot;.

According to Thomas Blom Hansen, a Stanford University professor, across India &quot;a lot of the violence perpetrated against Muslims these days is actually perpetrated by subsidiaries of the Hindu nationalist movement&quot;. According to Hansen, the police harassment of Muslims in Muslim neighborhoods in the run-up to the Delhi riots is &quot;very well-documented&quot;. According to Sumantra Bose, a London School of Economics professor, since Narendra Modi&#x27;s reelection in May 2019, his government has “moved on to larger-scale, if still localized, state-sanctioned mob violence”. In recent years, anti-Muslim violence in India has increased seriously due to the Hindutva ideology, where citizens with other religious beliefs are tolerated but have second‐​class status.

====Philippines====
The Muslim Moro people live in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao and the southern provinces, remain disadvantaged in terms of employment, social mobility, education, and housing. Muslims in the Philippines are frequently discriminated against in the media as scapegoats or warmongers. This has established escalating tensions that have contributed to the ongoing conflict between the Philippine government, Christians, and Moro people.

There has been an ongoing exodus of Moro (Tausug, Samal, Islamized Bajau, Illanun, and Maguindanao) to Malaysia (Sabah) and Indonesia (North Kalimantan) for the last 30 to 50 years, due to the annexation of their lands by Christian Filipino militants such as the Ilaga, who were responsible for massacres of Muslim villages from the 1970s to the late 1990s. This has changed the population statistics in both countries to a significant degree, and has caused the gradual displacement of the Moros from their traditional lands.

====Sri Lanka====


===== Persecution by Sinhala-Buddhist nationalists =====
Religious minorities have been subjected to increased persecution and attacks owing to the widespread mono-ethnic Sinhala Buddhist Nationalism in Sri Lanka. A nationalistic Buddhist group, Bodu Bala Sena (BBS), is alleged to have been behind attacks on Mosques and Muslims, as well as having organized a moral unofficial police team to check the activities of Christian missionaries and Muslim influence in daily life. The BBC reported that &quot;Sri Lanka&#x27;s Muslim minority is being targeted by hardline Buddhists. ... There have also been assaults on churches and Christian pastors but it is the Muslims who are the most concerned.&quot; The BBS has received criticism and opposition from other Buddhist clergy and politicians. Mangala Samaraweera, a Sri Lankan Theravada Buddhist politician who has served as Minister of Foreign Affairs since 2015, has accused the BBS of being &quot;a representation of &#x27;Taliban&#x27; terrorism&quot; and of spreading extremism and communal hatred against Muslims. Samaraweera has also alleged that the BBS is secretly funded by the Ministry of Defence. Anunayake Bellanwila Wimalaratana, deputy incumbent of Bellanwila Rajamaha Viharaya and President of the Bellanwila Community Development Foundation, has stated that &quot;The views of the Bodu Bala Sena are not the views of the entire Sangha community&quot; and that &quot;We don&#x27;t use our fists to solve problems, we use our brains&quot;. Wataraka Vijitha Thero, a Buddhist monk who condemns violence against Muslims and heavily criticized the BBS and the government, has been attacked and tortured for his stances.

Sinhala Buddhist Nationalism is opposed to Sarvodaya, although they share many of the same influences like Dharmapāla&#x27;s teachings by example, by having a focus upon Sinhalese culture and ethnicity sanctioning the use of violence in defence of dhamma, while Sarvodaya has emphasized the application of Buddhist values in order to transform society and campaigning for peace.

===== Persecution by the LTTE =====
Beginning in July 1990, tensions between the Sri Lankan Muslims (who constitute a separate ethnic group) and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam arose. Tit-for-tat killings between Tamils and Muslims in the Eastern Province resulted in the massacres of dozens of Muslims there. This culminated in the infamous Kattankudy mosque massacre in August 1990 by the LTTE. Following these massacres, thousands of Muslims fled Tamil-majority areas of the Eastern Province and resettled in Muslim-majority areas.

====Tajikistan====

Sunni Islam of the Hanafi school has been officially recognized by the government since 2009. Tajikistan considers itself a secular state with a Constitution providing for freedom of religion. The Government has declared two Islamic holidays, Id Al-Fitr and Idi Qurbon, as State holidays. According to a U.S. State Department release and Pew research group, the population of Tajikistan is 98% Muslim. The 2012 Pew report stated that approximately 87 of identified as Sunni, roughly 3% as Shia and roughly 7% as non-denominational Muslims. The remaining 2% of the population are followers of Russian Orthodoxy, a variety of Protestant denominations, Catholicism, Zoroastrianism, and Buddhism.

A great majority of Muslims fast during Ramadan, although only about one third in the countryside and 10% in the cities observe daily prayer and dietary restrictions.

There is some reported concern among mainstream Muslim leaders that minority religious groups undermine national unity. There is a concern for religious institutions becoming active in the political sphere. The Islamic Renaissance Party (IRP), a major combatant in the 1992–1997 Civil War and then-proponent of the creation of an Islamic state in Tajikistan, constitutes no more than 30% of the government by statute. Numbers of large mosques appropriate for Friday prayers are limited and some feel this is discriminatory.

By law, religious communities must register by the State Committee on Religious Affairs (SCRA) and with local authorities. Registration with the SCRA requires a charter, a list of 10 or more members, and evidence of local government approval prayer site location. Religious groups who do not have a physical structure are not allowed to gather publicly for prayer. Failure to register can result in large fines and closure of place of worship. There are reports that registration on the local level is sometimes difficult to obtain. People under the age of 18 are also barred from public religious practice.

The reason for having Tajikistan in this article is primarily because the government of the country itself, is – or is seen to be – the source of claimed persecution of Muslims. (As opposed to coming from outside forces or other religious groups.) This can make the reported issues open to bias by media and personal religious beliefs or preferences. In fact, the government – with the apparent approval of the people – is attempting to keep the government completely secular (full separation of Church and State) to avoid what they perceive as problems in other surrounding countries.
* The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government generally respects this right.
* There are some restrictions, and the Government monitors the activities of religious institutions to keep them from becoming overtly political.
* Religious communities must be registered by the Committee on Religious Affairs, which monitors the activities of Muslim groups
* The official reason given to justify registration is to ensure that religious groups act in accordance with the law but in practice it ensures they do not become overly political.
* President Imomali Rahmonov strongly defended &quot;secularism&quot;, likely understood both by the President and his audience, as being &quot;antireligious&quot; rather than &quot;nonreligious.&quot;
* The vast majority of citizens, including members of the Government, consider themselves Muslims and are not anti-Islamic but there is a pervasive fear of Islamic fundamentalism in both the government and much of the population at large.
* A 1998 law prohibits the creation of political parties with a religious orientation.
* A November 2015 rule reportedly bans Government Employees from attending Friday Prayers.
* The Friday &quot;Government Employee Prayer ban&quot; appears to relate to leaving work during normal working hours to attend prayers. &quot;Over the last two weeks, after Idi Qurbon, our management forbade us from leaving work to attend Friday prayers,&quot; one unnamed government employee told Asia-Plus.

Mosques are not permitted to allow women inside due to a fatwa issued in August 2004, by the Tajik Council of Ulema, or scholars – the country&#x27;s highest Muslim body. Part of the reasoning for this is that Tajikistan has 3,980 mosques, but very few are designed to allow men and women to worship separately, a practice Islam generally requires. The fatwa was not strictly enforced and more recently, it has been reported that the Ulema Council will relax the ban.

Only state controlled religious education is approved for children and long beards are banned in Tajikistan.

In Tajikistan, Mosques are banned from allowing Friday Prayers for children younger than 18 year old.

From the beginning of 2011, 1,500 mosques were shut down by the Tajik government, in addition to banning the hijab for children, banning the use of loudspeakers for the call of prayer, forbidding mosques from allowing women to enter, and monitoring Imams and students learning an Islamic education abroad, having sermons in the Mosque approved by the government and limiting the Mosque sermons to 15 minutes. Muslims experienced the most negative effects from the &quot;Religion Law&quot; enacted by the government of Tajikistan, curtailing sermons by Imams during weddings, making the &quot;Cathedral mosques&quot; the only legal place for sermons to be given by Imams with sermons not being allowed in five-fold mosques, the five-fold mosques are small mosques and serve a limited number of people while the medium and big mosques are categorized as Cathedral mosques, girls who wore the hijab have been expelled from schools and hijabs and beards are not permitted on passport photos. Mosques have been demolished and shut down by the Tajikistan government on the justification that they were not registered and therefore not considered as mosques by the government.

Tajikistan has targeted religious groups like Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, Jews, Christians, and Muslims who try to evade control by the government, synagogue, churches, and Mosques have been shut down and destroyed, only a certain amount of mosques are allowed to operate and the state must approve all &quot;religious activity&quot;, in which younger than 18-year-old children are not allowed to join in. Buildings for religious worship for Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, Protestant Churches, the Jewish Synagogue, and Muslim mosques have been targeted, destroyed, and shut down and prayers are forbidden to take place in public halls, with severed restrictions placed on religion. Churches, a synagogue, and mosques have been destroyed by the Tajikistan government.

Government approval is required for Tajiks seeking to engage in religious studies in foreign countries and religious activities of Muslims in particular are subjected to controls by the Tajikistan government. State control has been implemented on Islamic madrasahs, Imams, and Mosques by Tajikistan. A list of sermon &quot;topics&quot; for Imams has been created by the Tajikistan government. Towns are only allowed to have a certain number of mosques and only religious buildings sanctioned by the government are allowed to host religious activities, schools have banned hijab, religious studies in private have been forbidden mosque religious services are not allowed to admit children and non-registered mosques have been closed. Religious matters are banned for children under 18 year old. Public buildings do not allow beards, schools ban hijabs, unregistered mosques are shut down, and sermons are subjected to government authority. Only if &quot;provided the child expresses a desire to learn&quot; can a family teach religion to their own children, while the Tajik government banned all non-family private education. Islam and Muslims have been subjected to controls by the Tajikistan government, the states decides what sermons the Imams give, the government discharges the salaries of Imams and there is only a single madrasah in Tajikistan.

Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses have been declared illegal in Tajikistan. Abundant Life Christian Centre, Ehyo Protestant Church, and Jehovah&#x27;s witnesses have accused Tajikistan of lying about them not being declared illegal at a Warsaw OSCE conference for human rights.

Among increasingly religious Tajiks, Islamic-Arabic names have become more popular over Tajik names. However the government has considered the outlawing of Arabic-Islamic names for children. Tajikistan President Rakhmon (Rahmon) has said that the Persian epic Shahnameh should be used as a source for names, with his proposed law hinting that Muslim names would be forbidden after his anti-hijab and anti-beard laws.

The Tajik government has used the word &quot;prostitute&quot; to label hijab wearing women and enforced shaving of beards. As well as that the black coloured Islamic veil was attacked and criticized in public by Tajik President Emomali Rahmon.

The Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan has been banned by the Tajik government.

Tajikistan&#x27;s restrictions on Islam has resulted in a drastic decrease of big beards and hijabs. Tajikistan bans Salafism under the name &quot;Wahhabi&quot;, which is applied to forms of Islam not permitted by the government.

160 Islamic clothing stores were shut down and 13,000 men were forcibly shaved by the Tajik police and Arabic names were banned by the parliament of Tajikistan as part of a secularist campaign by President Emomali Rajmon.

Arabic names were outlawed by the legislature of Tajikistan.

In Uzbekistan and Tajikistan women wore veils which covered their entire face and body like the Paranja and faranji. The traditional veil in Central Asia worn before modern times was the faranji but it was banned by the Soviet Communists but the Tajikistan President Emomali has misleadingly tried to claim that veils were not part of Tajik culture.

After an Islamic Renaissance Party member was allowed to visit Iran by the Iranian government a diplomatic protest was made by Tajikistan.

====Vietnam====
The Cham Muslims in Vietnam are only recognized as a minority, and not as an indigenous people by the Vietnamese government despite being indigenous to the region. Muslim Chams have experienced violent religious and ethnic persecution and restrictions on practising their faith under the current Vietnamese government, with the Vietnamese state confisticating Cham property and forbidding Cham from observing their religious beliefs. In 2010 and 2013 several incidents occurred in Thành Tín and Phươc Nhơn villages where Cham were murdered by Vietnamese. In 2012, Vietnamese police in Chau Giang village stormed into a Cham Mosque, stole the electric generator, and also raped Cham girls. Cham Muslims in the Mekong Delta have also been economically marginalized and pushed into poverty by Vietnamese policies, with ethnic Vietnamese Kinh settling on majority Cham land with state support, and religious practices of minorities have been targeted for elimination by the Vietnamese government.

===Europe===
====Bosnia and Herzegovina====


The majority of persecutions that have been reported were during the Bosnian War. Primarily, the actions taken by all three factions has led to the Bosnian genocide, which refers to either the genocidal actions that took place at Srebrenica and Žepa which were committed by the Army of Republika Srpska in 1995, or the broader ethnic cleansing campaign throughout certain areas that were controlled by Republika Srpska during the 1992–1995 Bosnian War.

The events in Srebrenica in 1995 included the complete cleansing of more than 8,000 Bosniak men and boys, as well as the mass expulsion of another 25,000–30,000 Bosniak civilians, in and around the town of Srebrenica in Bosnia and Herzegovina, committed by units of the Army of the Republika Srpska (VRS) under the command of General Ratko Mladić.

The ethnic cleansing campaign that took place throughout areas controlled by the VRS targeted Bosnian Muslims. The ethnic cleansing campaign included unlawful confinement, murder, rape, sexual assault, torture, beating, robbery, and inhumane treatment of civilians; the targeting of political leaders, intellectuals, and professionals; the unlawful deportation and transfer of civilians; the unlawful shelling of civilians; the unlawful appropriation and plunder of real and personal property; the destruction of homes and businesses; and the destruction of places of worship.

The Srebrenica massacre, also known as the Srebrenica genocide (), was the July 1995 killing of more than 8,000 Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims), mainly men and boys, in and around the town of Srebrenica during the Bosnian War. The killing was perpetrated by units of the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) under the command of General Ratko Mladić. The Secretary-General of the United Nations described the mass murder as the worst crime on European soil since the Second World War. A paramilitary unit from Serbia known as the Scorpions, officially part of the Serbian Interior Ministry until 1991, participated in the massacre, along with several hundred Russian and Greek volunteers.

====Bulgaria====
In 1989, 310,000 Turks left Bulgaria, many of them left under pressure as a result of the communist dictator Todor Zhivkov regime&#x27;s assimilation campaign (though up to a third of them returned before the end of the year). That program, which began in 1984, forced all Turks and all other Muslims who lived in Bulgaria to adopt Bulgarian names and renounce all Muslim customs. The motivation behind the 1984 assimilation campaign is unclear; however, some experts believe that the disproportionately high birth rate of the Turks and the lower birth rate of the Bulgarians were major factors. During the name-changing phase of the campaign, Turkish towns and villages were surrounded by army units. Citizens were issued new identity cards with Bulgarian names. Failure to present a new card meant forfeiture of salary, pension payments, and bank withdrawals. Birth or marriage certificates would only be issued in Bulgarian names. Traditional Turkish costumes were banned; homes were searched and all signs of Turkish identity were removed. Mosques were closed. According to contemporary estimates, 500 to 1,500 people were killed when they resisted assimilation measures, and thousands of others were imprisoned, sent to labour camps or forcibly resettled.

==== France ====
In the week after the Islamist terrorist attack against &quot;Charlie Hebdo&quot; which made 23 casualties, 54 anti-Muslim incidents were reported in France. These included 21 reports of actions (shootings with non-lethal weapons such as bb gun and dummy grenades) against Islamic buildings (e.g. mosques) and 33 cases of threats and insults. Three grenades were thrown at a mosque in Le Mans, west of Paris, and a bullet hole was found in its windows. A Muslim prayer hall in the Port-la-Nouvelle was also fired at. There was an explosion at a restaurant affiliated to a mosque in Villefranche-sur-Saône. No casualties were reported. Seven days after the attack, Mohamed El Makouli was stabbed to death at home by 28-year-old neighbour Thomas Gambet shouting &quot;I am your God, I am your Islam.&quot; His wife, Nadia, suffered hand injuries while she tried to save him.

Between 24 and 28 December 2015, a Muslim prayer hall was burned down and Qur&#x27;ans were set alight following marches by Corsican nationalists in a series of protests in Corsica. The protesters claimed to be acting in revenge for an incident that occurred the day prior when firefighters and police were assaulted in the neighbourhood of Jardins de l&#x27;Empereur; however, outside observers labeled the ensuing riots as anti-Arab and anti-Muslim. The Corsican nationalist politicians have claimed their view does not legitimise xenophobia, blaming the protest on French nationalism instead. Scholarly opinions on this claim are divided.

====Germany====
On 28 May 1993, four neo-Nazi skinheads (ages 16–23) set fire to the house of a Muslim Turk family in Solingen in North Rhine-Westphalia. As a result of the attack 3 girls and 2 women died and 14 other family members, including several children, were injured, some of them severely.
On 9 June 2004 a nail bombing in a business area popular with Turkish immigrants in Cologne injured 22 Turks, completely destroyed a barber shop and many other shops and seriously damaged numerous parked cars.

On 1 July 2009, Marwa El-Sherbini was stabbed to death in a courtroom in Dresden, Germany. She had just given evidence against her attacker who had used insults against her because she wore an Islamic headscarf. El-Sherbini was called &quot;Islamist&quot;, &quot;terrorist&quot;, and (according to one report) &quot;slut&quot;.

The National Socialist Underground murders took place between 2000 and 2006. The Neo-Nazi group killed 10 people. The police discovered a hit list of 88 people that included &quot;two prominent members of the Bundestag and representatives of Turkish and Islamic groups&quot;.

German officials recorded more than 70 attacks against mosques from 2012 to 2014. In 2016, 91 mosques in Germany were attacked. Police stated that the majority of cases have gone unsolved, and only one arrest was made so far. There were 950 attacks reportedly on Muslims and mosques in Germany in 2017 injuring 34 Muslims. In 2018, police recorded 813 hate crimes against Muslims, injuring at least 54 Muslims. 132 Islamophobic incidents occurred in Germany in the first half of 2019, injuring 4 Muslims.

On 17 July 2018, a man fired six shots at a female employee wearing a headscarf in a Turkish-owned bakery, leaving no casualties.

==== Netherlands ====
According to research by Ineke van der Valk, an author and researcher at the University of Amsterdam, a third of mosques in the Netherlands have experienced at least one incident of vandalism, threatening letters, attempted arson, or other aggressive actions in the past 10 years.

==== Norway ====
On 22 July 2011, two sequential lone wolf domestic terrorist attacks by Anders Behring Breivik against the government, the civilian population, and a Workers&#x27; Youth League (AUF) summer camp killed 77 people and injured at least 319. Analysts described him as having Islamophobic views and a hatred of Islam, and as someone who considered himself as a knight dedicated to stemming the tide of Muslim immigration into Europe. In a manifesto, he describes opposition to what he saw as the Islamisation of Europe as his motive for carrying out the attacks.

On 10 August 2019 21 year old lone gunman Philip Manshaus opened fire on a mosque in Bærum, Norway, a suburbia 20 kilometers outside of Oslo. He injured one person and was then subdued by two worshippers. At the time of the shooting there were three congregants in the mosque.

==== Sweden ====
Two people died and 13 were injured in a series of shootings targeting people with dark skin and non-Swedish appearance in Malmö in 2009 and 2010. The perpetrator had &quot;strong anti-immigrant sentiments&quot; and all but one of the victims were not ethnically Swedish.

Between 25 December 2014 and 1 January 2015, three arson attack against mosques occurred across Sweden in Eslöv, Uppsala and Eskilstuna injuring at least five Muslim civilians.

On 22 October 2015, a masked swordsman killed three and wounded another at Kronan School in Trollhättan. The perpetrator chose the school as his target due to its high immigrant population. He was later shot and killed by police. It is the deadliest attack on a school in Swedish history.

==== Switzerland ====
Zürich Islamic center shooting was a mass shooting of several people in an Islamic center in Central Zürich that occurred on 19 December 2016. Three people were wounded in the attack, two seriously, though all are expected to survive.

In 2019, one in every two Muslims in Switzerland stated that they had been discriminated against based on their religious identity.

==== United Kingdom ====
In 2015, 46% of Muslims in United Kingdom stated that they think being Muslim in U.K. is difficult.

In 2016, 1,223 cases of Islamophobic attacks were reported to Tell MAMA.

After the Manchester Arena bombing in May 2017, there was a 700% rise in the number of reported hate crimes against Muslims in the U.K. 94,098 hate crimes were recorded in the country in 2017–2018, 52% of them targeted Muslims which is about 130 to 140 hate crimes against Muslims reported each day. Scotland Yard stated that such crimes were &quot;hugely underreported&quot;. According to Tell MAMA, between March and July 2017, 110 attacks targeting mosques occurred in United Kingdom.

Boris Johnson&#x27;s comments on women wearing the veil in August 2018 led to a surge in anti-Muslim attacks and incidents of abuse. In the week following Johnson&#x27;s comments, Tell MAMA said anti-Muslim incidents increased from eight incidents the previous week, to 38 in the following which equals an increase of 375%. Twenty-two of the recorded anti-Muslim hate crimes targeted women who wore the niqab, or face veil.

In 2019, there were 3,530 recorded cases of Islamophobic hate crime in UK. A week after the March 2019 Christchurch mosque shootings in New Zealand, the number of reported hate crimes against Muslims increased by 593% and 95 incidents were reported to The Guardian between 15 March (day of the Christchurch mosque shootings) and midnight on 21 March.

===North America===
====Canada====
Police forces from across Canada have reported that Muslims are the second most targeted religious group, after Jews. And while hate crimes against all religious groups (except Jews) have decreased, hate crimes against Muslims have increased following 9/11. In 2014, police forces recorded 99 religiously motivated hate crimes against Muslims in Canada, the number was 45 in 2012.

In 2015, the city of Toronto reported a similar trend: hate crimes in general decreased by 8.2%, but hate crimes against Muslims had increased. Police hypothesized the spike could be due to the Paris attacks or anger over refugees. Muslims faced the third highest level of hate crimes in Toronto, after Jews and the LGBTQ community.

On 29 January 2017, a mass shooting occurred at the Islamic Cultural Centre of Quebec City, killing 6 and injuring 19 Muslims. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Premier Philippe Couillard called the shooting a terrorist attack, but the perpetrator was not charged with terrorism. The incident was classified as a hate crime and an Islamophobic attack.

In June 2021, five members of a Muslim family were the victims of a domestic terrorist attack in the city of London, Ontario. Four members died as a result of this attack, leaving the fifth, a 9-year-old boy, with severe injuries. The act was reported as premeditated and motivated by anti-Muslim hate.

====United States====
In the aftermath of 9/11, the number of hate crimes against people of Middle-Eastern descent in the country increased from 354 attacks in 2000 to 1,501 attacks in 2001.

Zohreh Assemi, an Iranian American Muslim owner of a nail salon in Locust Valley, New York, was robbed, beaten, and called a &quot;terrorist&quot; in September 2007 in what authorities call a bias crime. Assemi was kicked, sliced with a boxcutter, and had her hand smashed with a hammer. The perpetrators, who forcibly removed $2,000 from the salon and scrawled anti-Muslim slurs on the mirrors, also told Assemi to &quot;get out of town&quot; and that her kind were not &quot;welcomed&quot; in the area. The attack followed two weeks of phone calls in which she was called a &quot;terrorist&quot; and told to &quot;get out of town&quot;, friends and family said.

On 25 August 2010, a New York taxi driver was stabbed after a passenger asked him whether he was a Muslim.

On 27 December 2012, in New York City 31-year-old Erika Menendez allegedly pushed an Indian immigrant and small businessman named Sunando Sen onto the subway tracks where he was struck and killed by a train. Menendez, who has a long history of mental illness and violence, told police: &quot;I pushed a Muslim off the train tracks because I hate Hindus and Muslims... Ever since 2001 when they put down the Twin Towers, I&#x27;ve been beating them up.&quot; She was charged with second-degree murder as a hate crime and was sentenced to 24 years imprisonment in 2015.

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) keeps track of Nationwide Anti-Mosque Activity where they have noted at least 50 anti-mosque incidents in the previous five years.

In 2017, a Tennessee man harassed two Muslim girls after they got off a school bus. He yelled at the girls &quot;Go back to your country!&quot;. The man injured the father of the girls by assaulting him and swinging a knife. The man also chased the mother while still holding the knife. When he was taken into custody, he called the family &quot;terrorists&quot; and vowed to kill them when released from jail. Acting U.S. Attorney Mary Jane Stewart said of the attack, &quot;The cowardly and unprovoked attack and display of hate-filled aggression by this defendant toward two innocent young girls and their father is despicable. An attack upon the free exercise of any person&#x27;s religious beliefs is an attack on that person&#x27;s civil rights. The Department of Justice will continue to vigorously prosecute such violent acts motivated by hate.

In 2020, it was reported that Muslim detainees at a federal immigration facility in Miami, Florida, were repeatedly served pork or pork-based products against their religious beliefs, according to claims made by immigrant advocates. The Muslim detainees at the Krome detention facility in Miami were forced to eat pork because religiously compliant/halal meals that ICE served had been consistently rotten and expired. In one instance, the Chaplain at Krome allegedly dismissed pleas from Muslim detainees for help, saying, &quot;It is what it is.&quot; Civil rights groups said many had suffered illness, like stomach pains, vomiting, and diarrhea, as a result. An ICE spokesman said, &quot;Any claim that ICE denies reasonable and equitable opportunity for persons to observe their religious dietary practices is false.&quot; Previously in 2019, a Pakistani-born man with a valid US work permit was reportedly given nothing but pork sandwiches for six consecutive days.

===== Wrongful detentions =====
In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, Arabs and Muslims complained of increased scrutiny and racial profiling at airports. In a poll conducted by the &quot;Boston Globe&quot;, 71 percent of Blacks and 57 percent of Whites believed that &quot;Arabs and Arab-Americans should undergo special, more intensive security checks before boarding airplanes.&quot; Some Muslims and Arabs have complained of being held without explanation and subjected to hours of questioning and arrest without cause. Such cases have led to lawsuits being filed by the ACLU. Fox News radio host Mike Gallagher suggested that airports have a &quot;Muslims Only&quot; line in the wake of the 9/11 attacks stating &quot;It&#x27;s time to have a Muslims check-point line in America&#x27;s airports and have Muslims be scrutinized. You better believe it, it&#x27;s time.&quot; In Queens, New York, Muslims and Arabs have complained that the NYPD is unfairly targeting Muslim communities in raids tied to the alleged Zazi terror plot.

===== Criticism of the war on terror =====

The war on terror has been labelled a war against Islam by ex-United States Attorney General Ramsey Clark, who said that &quot;Most of the politicians are putting it as Islamic terrorists but what they really mean is the threat of Islam. So the idea of the war on Islam is the idea of extermination of a proportion never seen in history at any time.&quot;

There is no widely agreed on figure for the number of people that have been killed so far in the War on Terror as it has been defined by the Bush Administration to include the war in Afghanistan, the war in Iraq, and operations elsewhere. The International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, and the Physicians for Social Responsibility and Physicians for Global Survival give total estimates ranging from to casualties. Another study from 2018 by Brown University&#x27;s Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs puts the total number of casualties of the War on Terror in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan between 480,000 and 507,000. A 2019 Brown University study places the number of direct deaths caused by the War on Terror at over 800,000 when Syria and Yemen are included, with the toll rising to 3.1 million or more once indirect deaths are taken into account.

===Oceania===
====New Zealand====
The Christchurch mosque shootings were two consecutive white supremacist terrorist attacks which were committed at the Al Noor Mosque and the Linwood Islamic Centre in Christchurch, New Zealand, during Friday prayers on 15 March 2019. The attacks killed 51 people and injured 40 others.

<text>The moustached warbler (Acrocephalus melanopogon) is an Old World warbler in the genus &quot;Acrocephalus&quot;. It breeds in southern Europe and southern temperate Asia with a few breeding in north-west Africa. It is partially migratory. South-west European birds are resident, south-east European birds winter in the Mediterranean breeding range, and the Asiatic race migrates to Arabia, India and Pakistan.

It is scarce north of its range, but has occurred as a very rare vagrant as far as Poland and Denmark. There have been a few reports from Great Britain, including a pair breeding in Cambridgeshire in 1946, but these records have recently been removed from the official list of British birds, being unconvincingly distinguished from sedge warblers or paddyfield warblers.

This passerine bird is a species found in upright aquatic vegetation such as reeds and sedge. 3 to 6 eggs are laid from mid-April and incubated for 14 to 15 days. The nest is built over water among reeds or rushes or in a bush. This species is usually monogamous (Leisler &amp; Wink 2000).

This is a medium-sized warbler, long, slightly larger than the similar sedge warbler, &quot;Acrocephalus schoenobaenus&quot;. The adult has a finely streaked brown back and white underparts. The forehead is flattened, there is a prominent whitish supercilium, grey ear coverts, and the bill is strong and pointed.

The sexes are identical, as with most warblers, but young birds are more heavily streaked and have markings on the breast. Like most warblers, it is insectivorous and also feeds on water snails.

The song is fast and similar to the sedge warbler and reed warbler, with some mimicry and typically acrocephaline whistles added. Its song is softer and more melodious than those of its relatives, and includes phrases reminiscent of the nightingale. Unlike the sedge warbler, it does not sing in flight.
