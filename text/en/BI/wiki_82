<text>Easingwold is a market town and civil parish in North Yorkshire, England. Historically, part of the North Riding of Yorkshire, it had a population of 4,233 at the 2001 census, increasing to 4,627 at the 2011 Census. It is located about north of York, near the foot of the Howardian Hills.

==History==
The town is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Eisicewalt&quot; in the Bulford hundred. At the time of the Norman conquest, the manor was owned by Earl Morcar, but subsequently passed to the King. In 1265 the manor was passed to Edmund Crouchback by his father, Henry III. The manor was caught up in the dispute between the 2nd Earl of Lancaster and Edward I and the manor passed back to the crown following the Battle of Boroughbridge in 1322 which resulted in the execution of the Earl at Pontefract. The manor was restored to the Earl&#x27;s brother some six years later, but he left no male heir, so the lands passed to his son-in-law, John of Gaunt in 1361. The lands were next granted to his son-in-law, Ralph Neville. Following the War of the Roses, the lands were declared forfeit to the Crown until 1633, when they were granted to Thomas Belasyse and subsequently became the possession of the Wombwell family.

The town is an amalgamation of two smaller villages, &quot;Uppleby&quot; and &quot;Lessimers&quot;. The former being a settlement, or &quot;-by&quot; of a Dane called &quot;Upple&quot;, and the latter being an Angle settlement on the &quot;lease-mires&quot;, meaning leased land frequently waterlogged.

The name of Easingwold is Anglo Saxon in origin, with &quot;wold&quot; being a derivation of &quot;wald&quot; meaning &quot;forest&quot;, and the former part being a Saxon family name, possibly &quot;Esa&quot;. King John had a hunting lodge there and the royal Forest of Galtres once surrounded the area.

The market place was the site of an old toll booth. The base of the old market cross still exists next to Easingwold Town Hall, which was built as a public hall. It replaced an old row of &#x27;shambles&#x27; where butchers sold their wares. The market place was also the site of a bullring used for baiting. Records show that markets have been held in the town since 1221, but were formalised under letters patent from Charles I.

In the 18th century, two coaching inns served the town: the New Inn, and the Rose and Crown.

Under the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 a Poor law union was established in Easingwold in 1837. The town had a workhouse built in 1756 on Oulston Road. In 1934, Easingwold Union Workhouse was converted into a hospital for the mentally handicapped and known as &quot;Claypenny Colony&quot; until 1952 and then as &quot;Claypenny Hospital&quot; until the majority of the site was sold and redeveloped as residential accommodation towards the end of the 20th century.

In 1891 a privately owned branch line was opened from the town to the London-Edinburgh main line at Alne after many failed attempts to have the main line pass through or closer to the town. The line ran a passenger service until 1948 and a goods service until its final closure in 1957. The station was located in what is now Station Court. All that remains is the old station house following a fire in 1967 that resulted in its demolition.

There are 51 Grade II listed buildings in Easingwold, including five mileposts and the telephone kiosk in Back Lane. The areas of Long Street; the Parish Church and Church Hill; Uppleby and the market place are all within the Easingwold Conservation Area.

In 1908 Lieutenant-General Baden-Powell, the founder of the Scout Movement, visited Easingwold as commander of the Northumbrian division of the newly formed Territorial Force. Easingwold&#x27;s Scout Group was founded two years later.

===Parks===
After the closure of the Claypenny Hospital, the land was developed into a housing estate with a 34-acre parkland in between called Millfields Park opened in 1999 and now run by the Woodland Trust. The park is bounded to the west by a hawthorn hedge, to the north by a stock proof fence and by the housing estate around the rest. There are a number of informal footpaths across the site as well as the Sustrans National Cycle Route 65. Among the tree species planted here are sessile oak, cherry, field maple, ash, birch, rowan, walnut, whitebeam and larch. Some of the shrub species found here are holly, hazel, hawthorn, blackthorn and dogrose. Supported by the council and local community, Millfields Park hosts the 5 km Millfield parkrun every Saturday at 9 am.

Towards the centre of the town is Memorial Park. The site was formerly occupied by private tenants, a tennis club and a garage. After several years of planning and delay, the park was opened in September 1955.

==Economy==

There are a number of local retail businesses in the town. The number of public houses has significantly reduced since the 19th century, when there were also a number of local brew houses, the names of which can still be seen on local houses.

<doc id="353148" wikidata="Q815469" url="?curid=353148" title="Heckler &amp; Koch MP7">
<text>The Heckler &amp; Koch MP7 (German: &quot;Maschinenpistole 7&quot;) is a personal defense weapon chambered for the HK 4.6×30mm armor-piercing cartridge designed by German defence manufacturer Heckler &amp; Koch.

It was designed (together with the new cartridge) to meet NATO requirements published in 1989, which called for an SMG-type weapon with a greater capacity to defeat Kevlar body armor (versus pre-existing submachine guns using conventional pistol cartridges such as the .45 ACP and 9×19mm Parabellum).

The MP7 went into production in 2001, and is a direct rival to the FN P90, also developed in response to NATO&#x27;s requirement by Belgian company FN Herstal. The weapon has been revised since its introduction and the latest production variants are the MP7A1 and MP7A2.

The proliferation of cheap yet effective soft body armor has begun to make guns that fire pistol ammunition (such as Heckler &amp; Koch&#x27;s earlier MP5 submachine gun and USP pistol) ineffective. In response to this trend, Heckler &amp; Koch designed the MP7 (along with the cancelled UCP pistol, which was to use the same ammunition) to penetrate soft body armor while being small enough to be used in place of either a pistol or a submachine gun.

==Design details==

The MP7 uses a short-stroke piston gas system as is used on H&amp;K&#x27;s G36 and HK416 in place of a blowback system traditionally seen on submachine guns. The 4.6×30mm ammunition is exclusive to the gun and offers low recoil. This ammunition is unique among submachine guns in that the bullet is made almost entirely of a hardened steel penetrator instead of softer copper or lead. The MP7 has a cyclic rate of fire of around 950 rounds per minute (which is around 15.8 rounds per second).

The MP7 allows a conventional 20, 30 or 40-round box magazine to be fitted within the pistol grip (the 20-round magazine is comparable in size to a 15-round 9×19mm magazine, while the 40-round magazine compares to a 30-round 9×19mm magazine). It features an ambidextrous fire selector, bolt catch lever and magazine release. It has an extendable stock and a folding front grip (MP7 and MP7A1 variants, the MP7A2 lacks the folding front grip); it can be fired either one-handed or two-handed. It is compact and light, due to the use of polymers in its construction.

===Ammunition===
The MP7&#x27;s specially designed armor piercing (AP) high-velocity rounds consist of either copper-plated solid steel (DM11), alloy-plated steel jacket (DM21) or copper-alloy-jacketed lead core projectiles (Fiocchi FMJ ZP). Standard AP high-velocity DM11 (Ultimate Combat) round with a 2.0-g (31 gr) projectile has a muzzle velocity of 720 m/s (2,362 ft/s) and a muzzle energy of 506 J (373 ft-lb). The &quot;DM11&quot; round penetrates the NATO CRISAT target (20 layers of Kevlar with 1.6 mm titanium backing) at 200 m. The round has a small diameter, allowing for redoubling penetration capability and high capacity in a very small magazine.

VBR of Belgium produces a 4.6×30mm two-part controlled-fragmenting projectile that is claimed to increase the content of the permanent wound cavity and double the chance to hit a vital organ.
Heckler &amp; Koch claims that the CPS Black Tip ammunition made by Fiocchi has a muzzle energy of approximately 525 J, which would be comparable to 9×19mm Parabellum rounds.

===Accessories===
The MP7 features a full-length, top-mounted Picatinny rail that comes as standard with folding fore and rear iron sights attached. When the sights are folded flat, they resemble Patridge style open sights. Folded up, they feature aperture sights. The sights can easily be removed by loosening a single screw and lifting them off. Besides iron sights, other optics such as a red dot sight or a scope can also be mounted on the top picatinny rail. the MP7 is also usually fitted with additional rails on both sides of the barrel, which allows the MP7 to be mounted with other accessories such us a laser aiming modules (LAM), tactical flashlights, and more, without obscuring the view while aiming. The MP7 can also accept a suppressor, and its tailor-made suppressor does not interfere with its accuracy or rate of fire.

==Variants==
*PDW: The first prototype was shown in 1999 through the 1999 SHOT SHOW and was designated as the &#x27;PDW&#x27; (Personal Defense Weapon). It had a short Picatinny rail on the top and a smooth pistol grip surface.
*MP7: In 2001, it was designated as the &#x27;MP7&#x27; and went into production. Changes include a full-length Picatinny rail, a thick curved stock and an anti-slide surface on the pistol grip much like the HK USP. It also features folding iron sights mounted on the Picatinny rail and the button to fold the foregrip was made larger for easier operation.
*MP7A1: In 2003, its designation was changed to &#x27;MP7A1&#x27; and featured a redesigned pistol grip with a different surface and curved shape, a smaller stock with a straight buttpad, side-mounted picatinny rails as standard and the folding iron sights were made more compact. The weapon was made slightly longer, but because the stock was shortened, the overall length did not change. The stock is also able to be locked into 3 positions. Recent MP7A1 models have a trigger safety similar to a Glock pistol; the middle section of the trigger must be pulled first before the outer part will move. This helps to stop accidental discharges if the trigger is bumped.
*MP7A2: A variant without the folding front grip but features a Picatinny rail to mount various grips in line with the user&#x27;s preference.
*MP7-SF: A semi-automatic only variant of the MP7 which is currently used by the Ministry of Defence Police in the United Kingdom.

==Clones==
* T7 Pistol: MP7 clone by Tommy Built Tactical, unveiled at SHOT SHOW 2024. It can be sold as a pistol or as a SBR.
* AMK MP7: 3D printable lookalike by Deterrence Dispensed, available in 5.7×28mm and 9×19mm
* PSA X5.7: Submachine gun made by PSA, unveiled at SHOT SHOW 2024. Has a close resemblance to the MP7. It&#x27;s able to use 40-round magazines.

==Heckler &amp; Koch UCP==
The Heckler &amp; Koch Universal Combat Pistol (HK UCP), also known as the HK P46 is a double action, semi-automatic handgun developed under commission for the German Bundeswehr. The concept for the UCP was later cancelled at the prototype stage.

===History and description===
The UCP was to be the companion sidearm to the HK MP7, using the same HK 4.6×30mm cartridge. The 4.6×30mm round is a direct competitor to the 5.7×28mm by Fabrique Nationale de Herstal (FN). As such, the UCP would have been a direct competitor to the FN Five-seven pistol. Both have greater armor-piercing capabilities and less recoil compared to other commonly used military handgun cartridges, such as the 9×18mm Makarov and 9×19mm Parabellum.

The UCP operated on the delayed-blowback operating principle. The external design of the UCP appears to have been borrowed from the HK P2000 pistol, and includes ambidextrous controls, interchangeable backstraps, and a Picatinny rail system for the attachment of accessories. Like the USP and P2000 series of pistols, the trigger mechanism is reported to have been modular and capable of different configurations. The UCP was designed to accept an extended, threaded barrel capable of accepting the attachment of a sound suppressor made by Brügger &amp; Thomet.

The design remained in the prototype phase , and had been reported as entering limited trials with the Bundeswehr.

In July 2009, HK USA&#x27;s president, Wayne Weber, indicated that the UCP project has been cancelled because &quot;HK felt it did not provide adequate ballistics in handgun form.&quot;

<text>1949 in sports describes the year&#x27;s events in world sport.

==American football==
* NFL Championship: the Philadelphia Eagles won 14–0 over the Los Angeles Rams at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum
* Cleveland Browns 21–7 San Francisco 49ers for the All-America Football Conference championship. After the 1949 season, the Browns, 49ers and original Baltimore Colts all joined the NFL for the 1950 season.
* The decades–long &quot;color barrier&quot; in athletics for the Big Seven Conference is broken by Harold Robinson, playing football for Kansas State. Robinson would go on to be named All–Conference in 1950.
* Notre Dame Fighting Irish – college football national championship

==Association football==
England
* First Division – Portsmouth win the 1948–49 title.
* FA Cup – Wolverhampton Wanderers beat Leicester City 3–1.
Italy
* Superga air disaster – a plane carrying the Torino team crashes into a mountain on May 4, killing everyone on board. Of the entire squad, only one player (who didn&#x27;t fly, due to injury) survived, as well as potential signing Ladislao Kubala, who was due to fly but did not, due to his son&#x27;s ill health.

On 21 September 1949 at Goodison Park, Liverpool, the home of Everton, England were defeated 2–0 by Ireland in a friendly international.

==Australian rules football==
* Victorian Football League
** Essendon wins the 53rd VFL Premiership (Essendon 18.17 (125) d Carlton 6.16 (52))
** Brownlow Medal awarded to Ron Clegg (South Melbourne) and Col Austen (Hawthorn)

==Baseball==
* January 28 – The New York Giants sign their first black players: Negro leaguers outfielder Monte Irvin and pitcher Ford Smith. Both men are assigned to Jersey City. Irvin will star for the Giants, but Smith will not reach the major leagues.
* May 5 – Hall of Fame election. After a runoff election was necessary, Charlie Gehringer is selected for induction; on May 9, the Old-Timers Committee elects Mordecai &quot;Three Finger&quot; Brown and Kid Nichols as its first selections in 3 years.

<text>1946 in sports describes the year&#x27;s events in world sport. Although World War II had ended in 1945, a number of major sporting events were still precluded by planning difficulties, which the war had produced, the 1946 FIFA World Cup being perhaps the best known. However, the year is still notable as several sporting events resumed for the first time since the start of the war.

==American football==
* NFL Championship: the Chicago Bears won 24–14 over the New York Giants at the Polo Grounds
* All-America Football Conference begins play. Cleveland Browns win the championship by beating New York Yankees 14–9.
*The San Francisco 49ers are established and the Cleveland Rams move to Los Angeles, becoming the first professional sports teams in California.
* Notre Dame Fighting Irish – college football national championship

==Association football==
International
* FIFA World Cup – not held due to World War II
Colombia
* Millonarios F.C. was founded in Teusaquillo area, Bogota on June 18. 
Spain
* La Liga – won by Sevilla
England
* FA Cup – Derby County beat Charlton Athletic 4–1 after extra time.
* The Football League resumes playing for the 1946–47 season.
Germany
* No major football is held due to the Allied occupation of Germany.
Italy
* Serie A-B – won by Torino
Portugal
* Primeira Liga – won by C.F. Os Belenenses
France
* French Division 1 – won by Lille OSC

==Athletics==
* The third European Athletics Championships held from August 22 to August 25 at the Bislett Stadion in Oslo. For the first time, it is a combined event for men and women; and for the first time a city in Scandinavia hosts the championships.

==Australian rules football==
* Victorian Football League
** Essendon wins the 50th VFL Premiership, defeating Melbourne 22.18 (150) to 13.9 (87) in the Grand Final.
** Brownlow Medal awarded to Don Cordner (Melbourne)
*South Australian National Football League
** 5 October: Norwood 13.14 (92) beat Port Adelaide 9.10 (64) for their twentieth premiership, and the first of ten for coach Jack Oatey.
*Western Australian National Football League

==Baseball==
* January 23 – Hall of Fame election – the writers&#x27; vote again fails to select an inductee, despite a newly revamped voting process. Voting again favors earlier candidates from the 1900s and 1910s, but none is able to gain 75% of the vote.
* Jackie Robinson plays for the Montreal Royals, the AAA affiliate of the Brooklyn Dodgers, becoming the first African-American to play in organised baseball in the 20th century. Vincent &quot;Manny&quot; McIntyre from Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada becomes the first Black Canadian to sign a professional baseball contract (with the Sherbrooke Canadians).
* April 23 – the Hall of Fame Committee clears the deadlock at the top of the writers&#x27; ballot by selecting 11 new inductees, primarily from the popular candidates of the 1900s and 1910s: Jesse Burkett, Frank Chance, Jack Chesbro, Johnny Evers, Clark Griffith, Tommy McCarthy, Joe McGinnity, Eddie Plank, Joe Tinker, Rube Waddell and Ed Walsh. Selections of 19th century players are largely postponed. It is decided that the writers will henceforth select only players retired within the more recent past, rather than from the entire 20th century.
* June 15 – when some ballplayers jump to the Mexican League, MLB Commissioner Happy Chandler mentions a lifetime suspension for them, but his penalty is later reduced (1949).
* July 14 – player–manager Lou Boudreau of Cleveland Indians hits four doubles and one home run, but Ted Williams wallops three HRs and drives in eight runs, as the Boston Red Sox top the Indians 11–10. In the Sox second–game win, the famous &quot;Boudreau Shift&quot; is born. Boudreau shifts all his players, except the third baseman and left fielder, to the right side of the diamond in an effort to stop Williams, who grounds out and walks twice while ignoring the shift.
* World Series – St. Louis Cardinals defeat the Boston Red Sox 4 games to 3.

<text>The parasitic jaeger (North America) or Arctic skua (Europe) (Stercorarius parasiticus), is a seabird in the skua family Stercorariidae. It is a migratory species that breeds in Northern Scandinavia, Scotland, Iceland, Greenland, Northern Canada, Alaska, and Siberia and winters across the southern hemisphere. Kleptoparasitism is a major source of food for this species during migration and winter, and is where the name is derived from.

==Taxonomy==
The parasitic jaeger was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Larus parasiticus&quot;. Linnaeus specified the type locality as &quot;within the Tropic of Cancer of Europe, America and Asia&quot; but this is now restricted to the Swedish coastline. The parasitic jaeger is now placed with the six other skuas in the genus &quot;Stercorarius&quot; that was introduced in 1760 by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson. The species is considered to be monotypic: no subspecies are recognised. The genus name &quot;Stercorarius&quot; is Latin and means &quot;of dung&quot;; the food disgorged by other birds when pursued by skuas was once thought to be excrement. The specific &quot;parasiticus&quot; is from Latin and means &quot;parasitic&quot;. The word &quot;jaeger&quot; is the German word &quot;Jäger&quot;, meaning &quot;hunter&quot;. The English &quot;skua&quot; comes from the Faroese name &quot;skúgvur&quot; for the great skua, with the island of Skúvoy known for its colony of that bird. The general Faroese term for skuas is &quot;kjógvi&quot; .

==Description==

Identification is complicated by similarities to long-tailed jaeger and pomarine jaeger, and the existence of three colour morphs. Small for a skua, the parasitic jaeger measures in length, in wingspan and weighs . The tail streamer of the breeding adult accounts for about of their length. Light-morph adults have a brown back, mainly white underparts and dark primary wing feathers with a white &quot;flash&quot;. The head and neck are yellowish-white with a black cap and there is a pointed central tail projection. Dark-morph adults are dark brown, and intermediate-phase birds are dark with somewhat paler underparts, head and neck. All morphs have the white wing flash.

Identification of juveniles is even more problematic, and it is difficult to separate parasitic jaegers from long-tailed jaegers. Parasitic jaegers are bulkier, shorter-winged, and less tern-like than long-tailed jaegers. They are usually warmer toned, with browner shades, rather than grey. However, they show the same wide range of plumage variation. The flight is more falcon-like. The parasitic jaeger is the most common of the three jaeger species seen from shore.

The typical call of these birds is a nasal mewing sound, repeated a few times in display. Their alarm call is a shorter sound.

==Distribution and habitat==
This species breeds in the north of Eurasia and North America, with significant populations as far south as northern Scotland, in Shetland and Orkney, the Outer Hebrides, Sutherland, Caithness, and some islands in Argyll. Birds in North America breed in Alaska, Yukon, the Northwest Territories, Nunavut, the Hudson Bay coast, and parts of Northern Quebec and Nunatsiavut.

The parasitic jaeger is a migrant, wintering at sea in the tropics and southern oceans. While much of the migration is over sea, overland spring migration occurs in the Canning River Valley, Alaska, and overland fall migration occurs from northern Russia to the Persian Gulf among Eurasian populations, and over the Great Lakes (particularly Lake Ontario) among American populations.

==Behavior==
===Breeding===

Nesting occurs on dry tundra, higher fells, and islands. Clutches consist of up to four olive-brown eggs. Jaegers are usually silent except for mewing and wailing notes while on the breeding grounds. Like other skuas, it will fly at the head of a human or fox approaching its nest.

===Feeding===
This bird will feed on rodents, insects, eggs, chicks and small birds in the breeding season, but the majority of its diet (especially in winter and on migration) is made up of food that it acquires by robbing other birds (primarily gulls and terns) of their catches in an act called kleptoparasitism.

==Conservation status==
In 2018, &quot;Stercorarius parasiticus&quot; was regionally uplisted to Endangered in Iceland, from Least Concern in 2000, after their numbers declined drastically in the early 2000s. It is globally listed as Least Concern.

<text>Anthropomancy (from Greek &quot;anthropos&quot; (&quot;ἄνθρωπος&quot;, man) and &quot;manteia&quot; (&quot;μαντεία&quot;, divination)) is a method of divination by the entrails of dead or dying men or women through sacrifice. This practice was sometimes also called splanchnomancy. In ancient Etruria and Rome, the usual variety of divination from entrails was haruspicy (performed by a haruspex), in which the sacrifice was an animal.

<text>The N7 road is a national primary road in Ireland, connecting Limerick and Dublin. The majority of the route (between Naas and Limerick) is motorway standard and is designated as the [[M7 motorway (Ireland)|M7 motorway]]. At the Rosbrien interchange in Limerick the route continues as the N18 dual carriageway to Galway, Shannon and Ennis. The road passes through the midlands of Ireland, and acts as a trunk route out of Dublin for the N8 and N9 national primary routes to Cork and Waterford respectively. It forms part of European route E20.

==Route==

===N7 - Naas Road===

From the M50, the N7 passes south of Clondalkin leaving the city as part of the &quot;Naas Road&quot;. (The Naas Road begins at the Grand Canal as a regional road (R810), a continuation of the Tyrconnell Road. It continues 3.4  km southwest to the M50 motorway, at the Red Cow interchange, where it becomes the N7.) The N7 route continues in a south-west direction with 3 lanes of traffic each way towards Naas for approximately . Construction of the third lane commenced on 4 January 2005 and concluded on 14 August 2006 (thumbnail left); having been originally dualled between 1963 and 1968.

At Newlands Cross a flyover and exit slip roads replaced the at-grade signal-controlled crossing in November 2014. This eliminated the last signal-controlled crossing on the N7/M7 route between the M50 and Limerick. Traffic for Clondalkin to the north and Tallaght to the south leave the N7 by slip roads connecting to the R113. The N7 continues southwards to bypass Citywest, Saggart, Rathcoole, Kill and Johnstown in County Kildare. These locations are all served with grade-separated interchanges which were constructed as part of the upgrade works completed in the mid-2000s. The old junctions consisted of traffic lights with a break in the dual-carriageway median. The three-lane section used to end at junction 9 (Naas, Sallins) with a left-hand lane-drop/lane-gain for traffic leaving/entering here.

The section of the N7 between Naas and the M50 Motorway is the second busiest road in the country with frequent daily tailbacks from the Naas North junction on the southbound side.

This part of the route is the only section that remains designated as N7 as the road is not motorway standard. Left-in/left-out access is provided to minor roads and to homes, farms and businesses along this section.

===M7 - Naas to Limerick===

From Naas, motorway restrictions are enforced and the route is designated as the M7 motorway. The route continues in a south-west direction bypassing the towns of Naas, Newbridge, Kildare, Monasterevin and Portlaoise. The M9 to Waterford diverges from the route at junction 11. South of Portlaoise the M8 diverges from the M7 to Cork and the south at junction 19 with the M7 continuing south-westwards bypassing the towns of Mountrath, Borris-in-Ossory, Castletown (County Laois), Roscrea, Moneygall, Toomevara, Nenagh and Birdhill. From Birdhill the route continues towards Limerick city where it forms part of the Limerick Southern Ring Road bypassing Annacotty and Castletroy. The route terminates at the Rosbrien Interchange to the south of Limerick City. The road continues as the N18 into county Clare. At the Rosbrien Interchange, access is available to the M20 motorway via a slip road from the M7.

==History==
Originally the N7 was a single carriage-way route between Dublin and Limerick and passed through the main towns on the route that are now bypassed. The old N7 route was downgraded to regional road status (as soon as sections of the M7 motorway were complete) and is currently designated as the R445 road. The R445 is an alternative route between Limerick and Dublin.

Until 2012, the N7 was the only one of the inter-urban routes out of Dublin which did not commence in Dublin city centre, but rather at the M50. The original N7 route (under the &quot;Local Government (Roads and Motorways) Act, 1974 (Declaration of National Roads) Order, 1977&quot;) started the route in Dublin city centre, like the other national routes, with the route originally running through Inchicore village before reaching the Naas Road. However, in 1994, following the construction of the Chapelizod bypass which brought the N4 road (now R148) into Dublin city centre as dual carriageway, the N7 inside the M50 was downgraded to regional road status (as the R110 road), with N7 traffic signposted to use the N4 and M50 rather than the original route through Inchicore.

The N7 is noted for two firsts in the history of Irish roads - the first substantial length of dual carriageway in Ireland, running from Dublin to Naas which was completed in 1968 and also Ireland&#x27;s first section of motorway, the Naas Bypass, opened in 1983 bypassing the original route through the town.

The old N7 route (now R445/R110) also formed most of the T5 trunk route between Dublin and Limerick. This was an old method of designating routes in Ireland before the current method was introduced.

===History of upgrades to the N7 and M7===
Towards the start of the 21st Century, a substantial effort was made to upgrade all sections of the N7 road to motorway standard, creating a high-quality standard connection between Dublin and Limerick. Prior to the year 2000, only short sections of the N7 were of motorway or dual-carriageway status:
* Widening of the N7 between Dublin and Naas to dual carriageway status - 1960s (the third lane constructed each way completed in 2006)
* M7 Naas Bypass - completed 1983
* M7 Newbridge Bypass - completed 1993
* M7 Portlaoise Bypass - completed 1997

As part of the National Development Plan undertaken by the Irish Government from the mid-2000s onwards; work took place to link existing sections of the M7 and extend it to Limerick:
* M7 Kildare Bypass - completed 2003
* M7 Monasterevin Bypass and Limerick Bypass - completed in 2004
* M7 Nenagh to Limerick, Portlaoise to Castletown and Castletown to Nenagh - all completed in 2010.

==Map of route==
* Route of N7 overlaid on Google Maps

==Junctions==
The junctions on the Naas Bypass and Newbridge Bypass sections of the M7 were previously numbered J7-J11 (now renumbered Junctions 9–13), in the expectation that an M7 motorway would be built along a new alignment. Instead, the Naas Road dual-carriageway was upgraded. There remain some private accesses and minor exits prior to J9, the beginning of the M7 motorway.

Junctions 9–30 apply of the motorway section of the N7.

<text>The M7 motorway () is a motorway in Ireland. The motorway runs continuously from the outskirts of Naas in County Kildare to Rossbrien on the outskirts of Limerick city. The M7 forms part of the Dublin to Limerick N7 national primary road. The section of the motorway bypassing Naas, an 8 km stretch, was the first section of motorway to open in Ireland, in 1983. Following substantial works to extend the M7 to Limerick, by the end of 2010, the motorway replaced all of the old single-carriageway N7 route which is now designated as R445. At 166.5 km, the M7 is the longest motorway in Ireland.

==Route==
===Naas to Limerick===
The N7 leads directly into the M7 motorway at the Maudlin&#x27;s Interchange near Naas (junction 9 on the N7-M7 corridor), and proceeds southwestwards, bypassing Naas, Newbridge, Kildare, Monasterevin, Ballybrittas, Portlaoise, Mountrath, Borris-in-Ossory, Roscrea, Moneygall, Toomevara, Nenagh and Annacotty. As of December 2010, the M7 is approximately 186 km in length and ends at the Rosbrien interchange (junction 30) outside Limerick. Here, the road connects to the Limerick Southern Ring Road - Phase 2 and continues as the N18. At junction 30 there is also a slip-road to the M20 Limerick - Cork/Kerry road. Along this section of the M7 there is a fly-over for the N24 Limerick to Waterford road at junction 29. Southwest of Portlaoise it forms an interchange with the M8 Dublin-Cork motorway at junction 19 and at junction 11 there is an interchange with the M9 Dublin - Waterford motorway. (From this junction the M7/N7 is 3 lanes in each direction until it intersects with the M50 (Dublin&#x27;s ring-motorway))

==History==
The M7 was constructed in stages between 1983 and 2010 to replace the old national route which ran (in order from east to west) through the villages and towns of Naas (1983), Newbridge (1993), Kildare (December 2003), Monasterevin (November 2004), Portlaoise (29 May 1997), Mountrath and Borris-in-Ossory (both 28 May 2010), Roscrea, Moneygall and Toomevara (all 22 December 2010), Nenagh (single carriageway, original bypass, July 2000) and Birdhill (28 September 2010) and the city of Limerick (May 2004). Today, junctions provide access to all of these places. The old route has been re-classified as a regional road, the R445. A restricted-access fork junction (junction 11) connects the M7 to the M9 motorway to Waterford and Kilkenny also allowing access from the M9 to eastbound carriageway of the M7. The M8 for Cork and parts of Tipperary South such as Cahir and Cashel branches at yet another fork junction.

The Kildare bypass, which was completed in 2003, overcame noteworthy environmental and engineering challenges. To allow the bypass to cut through 3.5 km of a major aquifer, an impermeable layer made up of a Bituminous geomembrane and compacted clay was installed underneath the road. This layer created a tanked system in which the road level is below the groundwater level, thereby minimizing the impact to the environmentally sensitive Pollardstown Fen.

Until summer 2006, junction numbers started at seven, although only the first five junctions were numbered. This junction numbering scheme was devised when it was believed that a motorway would be built from Naas to the yet-to-be-constructed junction 8 on the M50. While a motorway reservation still exists, it is now unlikely to be built, having been superseded by the widening of the N7 between Newlands Cross and Naas to three lanes and the grade separation of this section. The junction numbers were renumbered to fit into this scheme in July–August 2006.

The construction of the Nenagh to Limerick section was slow and difficult. Work on this section began on 7 December 2006 and was initially due to be completed in May 2009. The total length of the scheme is , of which was the upgrading of the single carriageway Nenagh bypass. The road opened in three stages. The Nenagh bypass re-opened to motorway standard on 17 December 2009 and the Nenagh to Birdhill section opened on 1 April 2010. Problems were encountered while constructing the road over two sections of deep bog at Annaholty and Drominboy near Birdhill and this delayed the opening of the Birdhill to Limerick section by over a year. Parts of the road collapsed over the two bogs and the sections were rebuilt and opened on 28 September 2010. This scheme was originally to be built as a high-quality dual carriageway (HQDC), but it was re-designated motorway by Statutory Instrument on 17 July 2008.

In June 2007, construction commenced on a section of the M7 motorway between Portlaoise and Castletown, which opened on 28 May 2010 and is subject to a toll north of the M7-M8 interchange. This M7 scheme runs between junctions 18 and 21 on the N7-M7 corridor and bypasses Borris-in-Ossory and Mountrath. This section includes a tie-in to the new 143 km M8.

In March 2008, construction commenced on a 36 km section (22 miles) of the M7 route between Castletown, County Laois and Nenagh, tying into the Portlaoise-Castletown scheme mentioned above at the Borris-in-Ossory junction. It runs between junctions 21 and 24 on the N7-M7 corridor. This scheme was originally planned to proceed as a High Quality Dual Carriageway (HQDC), which would have seen it built to many of the same engineering standard as a motorway, with a design speed of 120 km/h, however a Statutory Instrument was passed on 17 July 2008, re-designating this and many other new HQDC schemes as motorway. Consequently, when this scheme was complete, it opened with full motorway regulations on 22 December 2010.

In May 2004 work was completed on phase 1 of the Limerick Southern Ring Road which consists of approximately of dual carriageway, and joins the M20 road to Cork and the N21 road to Kerry. Two grade separated junctions allow access to Limerick city at Annacotty via the R445 and at Ballysimon via the N24. The N20 Carew park link road was closed permanently to inbound traffic from both the M7 and M20 in June 2010 to facilitate phase 2 of the Limerick southern ring road project. The dual carriageway was redesignated as M7 in 2009. Phase 2 of the Limerick Southern Ring Road opened as part of the N18 and was completed in July 2010.

In 2017 work started on the widening of 13.5 km of the former two-lane dual carriageway to D3M standard between the Maudlin&#x27;s interchange (J9) and the M7/M9 junction (J11). The widening project included the relocation of the on/off ramps at Junction 10 to a new junction at the main Naas to Newbridge dual carriageway (R445). A new interchange at Osberstown between junctions 9 and 10 was also built and designated Junction 9a. The project was fully completed in March 2021.

In April 2022, an average speed camera system went into operation on a 9km stretch between junction 26 and 27.

==Junctions==

==Motorway service areas==
While there are several on-line service areas on the N7, there are none provided along the motorway section. There are instead a number of off-line service areas.

&quot;Junction 14 Mayfield&quot;, an independently owned service area, was opened in June 2011. Accessed from either direction, traffic must use the existing junction 14 slip roads with eastbound traffic then crossing to the south side of the motorway by bridge. Facilities include a Spar store and deli, an Insomnia Coffee and a Supermac&#x27;s.

There are two service areas in operation at junction 17 outside Port Laoise. The Midway Food Court is operated by Applegreen and contains a Burger King, Subway and Chopstix noodle bar, as well as a Maldron hotel. The Portlaoise Plaza was opened in July 2020, despite objection from Petrogas, and consists of a Supermac&#x27;s, Papa John&#x27;s Pizza, Spar and Bewley&#x27;s.

&quot;Barack Obama Plaza&quot;, an independently owned service area, opened at junction 23 on the outskirts of Moneygall, County Offaly (however the service area itself is in County Tipperary) and includes a Spar store, a Supermac&#x27;s, Papa John&#x27;s Pizza, Mac&#x27;s Place (a deli) and Bewley&#x27;s coffee. It is accessed using the existing junction 23 slip roads with eastbound traffic then passing under the motorway bridge.

Petrogas opened a service area in October 2014 at junction 27, the Birdhill exit. The &quot;Applegreen&quot; branded service area contains a Costa Coffee and a Burger King franchise. Traffic uses the existing slip roads with westbound traffic then passing over the motorway bridge.

==Roadside art on M7==
Roadside art is funded under the Percentage For Arts Scheme where 1% of the scheme budget is allocated to roadside art with a cap of €63,000. The local authorities decide on a theme and are responsible for commissioning the work, usually by open competition. There are several examples along the M7
*Perpetual Motion, a large sphere with road markings situated where the N7 becomes the M7 at Naas. Created by Remco de Fouw in collaboration with Rachel Joynt in 1995.
*Race of The Black Pig on the Kildare bypass. Artist Dan George created (2003) this 0.4 km long installation in three segments, East, Central and West groups.
* The Hitchhiker on the Monasterevin bypass. Artist Willie Malone created this phosphor bronze installation (2005) to represent the wheel. Jointly commissioned by Kildare and Laois County Councils. In March 2011 The Hitchhiker was removed from the side of the motorway by persons unknown.
* Doon a two-part earthwork with stainless steel superstructure located on the Portlaoise bypass. Viewed from the air the implication is that the earthwork ring stretches across the motorway. Artists Robert McColgan and Irene Benner.
* The Dandelion is on the north side of the M7 at Rathnaveogue between the Roscrea and Moneygall junctions. In two pieces a three dimensional figure of a girl blowing at a dandelion carved in bas relief from a large slab of stone. The Artist was Michael Disley.
* Architects of the Land, limestone figures of a Man and a Bull, one each side of M7 Nenagh Bypass. Artist Colin Grehan created the sculpture in 2001 from two massive limestone blocks. The mans legs merge into plough shears, his pose designed to indicate an imaginary link to the bull across the carriageways.

==Future==
===Motorway redesignations affecting the M7===
On 30 September 2008, the Irish National Roads Authority released the second tranche of potential motorway redesignations. These included parts of the present N7/M7 route.

The M7 was to end at junction 28, where it would have blended into the N7 southern ring road scheme. On 10 July 2009, ministerial approval was given for 10 km of the Limerick southern-ring and the N7/N20 interchange (and all relevant slip-roads) to be redesignated to motorway status.

If various other schemes on the N7 are to be redesignated motorway (e.g., the section from Dublin to Naas), the route could reach up to 220 km in length.

<doc id="353192" wikidata="Q1771632" url="?curid=353192" title="N8 road (Ireland)">
<text>The N8 road is a national primary road in Ireland, connecting Cork with Dublin via the M7. The N8 is further classified by the United Nations as the entirety of the (partially signed) European route E 201 (formerly E200), part of the trans-Europe International E-road network. The road is motorway standard from junction 19 on the M7 to the Dunkettle interchange in Cork City and is designated as the M8 motorway. From here the route continues into Cork city centre and terminates at the N22 road at St. Patrick&#x27;s Street. The M8 motorway was completed in May 2010, replacing the single carriageway sections of the old N8 and bypassing towns on the main Cork to Dublin road. It is now possible to travel from Cork to Dublin on the M/N8 in about 2 hours 30 minutes. The route commences just south of Portlaoise, and reaches Cork via the midlands and the Golden Vale, through counties Laois, Kilkenny, Tipperary, Limerick and Cork.

== Route from County Laois to Cork City ==

Junction 19 on the N7 route (M7 motorway from Naas to past Portlaoise) at Aghaboe marks the start of the N8 (see thumbnails). From here it proceeds southwards, passing under the R434 and R433 roads until it runs parallel to the single-carriageway R639 road, bypassing Abbeyleix, Durrow, Cullahill, Johnstown, Urlingford, Littleton, Horse and Jockey, Cashel, New Inn, Cahir, Skeheenarinky, Kilbeheny, Mitchelstown, Kilworth Mountain, Fermoy, Rathcormac, Watergrasshill and Glanmire. Originally the N8 route passed through all of these towns as a single carriageway however a series of projects as part of the transport 21 road infrastructural project saw all of these towns bypassed and the route replaced with motorway. The M8 motorway ends at the Dunkettle interchange however the N8 route continues into Cork city centre as the &quot;Lower Glanmire Road&quot;, &quot;Water Street&quot;, &quot;Horgan&#x27;s Quay&quot;, &quot;Penrose Quay&quot;, &quot;Brian Boru Bridge&quot; and &quot;Merchant&#x27;s Quay&quot; (and the route returns via &quot;St. Patrick&#x27;s Bridge&quot;, &quot;Bridge Street&quot; and &quot;McCurtain Street&quot;). The N8 ends where it meets the N22 at &quot;St. Patrick&#x27;s Street&quot;. Following completion of the M8 the old N8 has been redesignated as the N77 from Durrow to Portlaoise, with other sections redesignated as the R639.

== History of the Dublin to Cork road ==

=== 18th and 19th centuries ===
In the 17th, 18th, and early- to mid-19th centuries, and probably earlier still, horse-drawn Dublin-Cork traffic travelled via Kilcullen, Carlow, Kilkenny, Clonmel, Ardfinnan, Clogheen, Ballyporeen, Kilworth, Fermoy and Rathcormac. Much of the N8/R639 route was built to connect the midlands to southern Tipperary and north County Cork as part of the Irish turnpike road-building drive of the mid-18th century. However, some sections are much older, such as the segments between Cork and Fermoy, Cashel and Cahir and Durrow to Abbeyleix; the construction of these particular stretches cannot as yet be dated, though they were in place prior to 1714. The N8/R639 between Fermoy and Cahir via Mitchelstown was built sometime after 1811, while the R639/former N8 between Cashel and Urlingford was built around 1739. At the same time, the route from Urlingford to Maryboro (modern-day Portlaoise) was substantially improved. In 1782 an unnamed English tourist in Ireland, known to historians as &quot;X.Z.&quot;, gave a brief description of the route between Cashel and Urlingford: &quot;From Cashel we rode fifteen miles of a bad road, through a bleak country to Urlingford, when we enter Leinster province. The country now becomes more populous, better improved, and the roads much more agreeable for travelling.&quot;

=== 20th and 21st centuries ===

Some time after 1811 the gaps in the R639 between Fermoy and Cahir were filled, but the traditional route, known for much of the 20th century as the T6, continued to run from Cahir to Dublin via Clonmel, Kilkenny and Carlow. The R639/N8 corridor did not become the official Dublin to Cork road until 1974 when it was designated as the N8, though several Esso road atlases considered it to be the preferred route for motorists travelling between the two cities from at least the early 1960s.

The N8 was improved at various times during the 1970s through to the early years of the 21st century. Improvement projects carried out on the road during the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s involved periodic widening, resurfacing and the replacement of signposts. The first major improvement work carried out on the N8, post designation, involved the construction of a 4 km single carriageway bypass south-west of Cahir in County Tipperary. This opened to traffic in 1991, and remained the N8 until the M8 motorway was completed through South Tipperary on 25 July 2008.

The 1991 N8 Cahir Bypass was then renumbered as part of the N24, and was simultaneously designated as the R639. (The original route of the N8 through Cahir town was redesignated a regional road in 1991, and was renumbered as part of the R670).

The next major improvement entailed a realignment of the road so that it bypassed the village of Glanmire for 6 km to the east. This dual carriageway bypass, referred to in official documentation as the &quot;Glanmire Bypass&quot;, cost £35 million and opened on 3 April 1992 after a construction period of almost seven years. In spring 2001, attention was turned to Watergrasshill in County Cork. For many years regarded as a serious bottleneck on the N8, a wide median 7 km dual carriageway bypass was constructed and opened to traffic in September 2003 as the N8, with the former road through Watergrasshill becoming the R639.
In 2004, the N8 through Cashel in County Tipperary was realigned with a narrow-median dual carriageway bypass to the east of that town. Again, the former N8 through Cashel was redesignated a regional road, and renumbered the R639. In July 2006, a circuitous and oft-criticized single carriageway relief road for Mitchelstown was opened to traffic around the west of the town.
Ultimately, the N8 Cashel bypass was itself reclassified as part of the M8 motorway in July 2008. The changes took effect on 24 September 2008. Shortly prior to this, in October 2007, the section of N8 between Cashel and Cahir was bypassed by an early-opening segment of the now M8 motorway between junctions 9 and 10 and, for a 10-month period, this 13 km section of high-quality dual carriageway was designated a section of the N8 (the former single carriageway became the R639). On 25 July 2008 the section of single carriageway N8 between Cahir and Kilbehenny was also superseded by the new motorway, and this too was renumbered as the R639. This, in turn, was followed on 8 December 2008 by the length of road from Cashel to 2 km south of Cullahill in County Laois. In the meantime, the Watergrasshill to Fermoy section of the M8 had opened in October 2006.

The Fermoy to Mitchelstown section of the M8 opened on 25 May 2009. The former single carriageway N8 that ran between these towns was then reclassified, for the most part, as the R639 except for a section of the Mitchelstown Relief Road which became a part of the N73 national secondary route.

<doc id="353197" wikidata="Q1771638" url="?curid=353197" title="N11 road (Ireland)">
<text>The N11 road is a national primary road in Ireland, running for along the east side of Ireland from Dublin to Wexford. It passes close to Bray, Greystones, Wicklow, Arklow, Gorey, and Enniscorthy. Beyond Wexford, the route continues to Rosslare as the N25. The road forms part of European route E01. As of July 2019 the N11/M11 is of dual carriageway or motorway standard from Dublin as far as Oilgate in County Wexford.

The road is a busy commuter route, being the only dual carriageway passing through the south eastern suburbs of Dublin, as well as close to the many commuter towns along the east coast as far south as Gorey. Summer Friday and Sunday evenings also see very heavy traffic as Dubliners decamp to and return from their many holiday home locations along the County Wicklow and County Wexford coastlines.

==Original route out of and into Dublin==
The N11 commenced where it met the N4 on the south end of &quot;O&#x27;Connell Bridge&quot; in Dublin city centre. The route proceeded along &quot;D&#x27;Olier Street&quot;, &quot;College Street&quot; (and in the opposite direction, &quot;Westmoreland Street&quot;). The route continued around &quot;College Green&quot; and &quot;Grafton Street&quot; (and in the other direction, &quot;Suffolk Street&quot;, &quot;Church Lane&quot; and &quot;Dame Street&quot;). From here, the route continued out of the city via &quot;Nassau Street&quot;, &quot;Kildare Street&quot;, North side of &quot;St. Stephen&#x27;s Green&quot;, &quot;Merrion Row&quot;, &quot;Baggot Street Lower&quot;, &quot;Pembroke Street Lower&quot;, &quot;Fitzwilliam Square West&quot; and &quot;Pembroke Street Upper&quot;. This route section in the other direction (into the city centre) ran via &quot;Leeson Street Lower&quot;, East and North sides of &quot;St. Stephen&#x27;s Green&quot; and &quot;Dawson Street&quot;. The N11 ran in both directions along &quot;Leeson Street Lower&quot; after the junction with &quot;Pembroke Street&quot;. Having crossed the Grand Canal the route divided again for a portion of &quot;Leeson Street Upper&quot;, with outbound traffic proceeding via &quot;Sussex Road&quot;. The route continued via Morehampton Road and &quot;Donnybrook Road&quot;, through Donnybrook. Eventually converting from single carriageway (including bus lanes either side) to dual carriageway at Donnybrook Church, which marks the beginning of what is known as the &quot;Stillorgan Road&quot;.

The &quot;Stillorgan Road&quot; brought the road past Belfield, where University College Dublin is located (and accessed from a grade-separated interchange on the dual carriageway - the first full interchange built in Ireland) and onwards to its junction with Mount Merrion Avenue.

This former section of the N11 is now the R138.

==Current starting point==
Heading south, the N11 currently starts in Mount Merrion at the junction with the N31 to Dún Laoghaire harbour.

From this junction it heads south to Stillorgan village. Stillorgan village is bypassed to the east by the N11 dual carriageway, which proceeds southeast through Galloping Green, bypassing Leopardstown and Foxrock to the east also. Then the &quot;Cabinteely Bypass&quot; and part of the &quot;Bray Road&quot; bring the N11 via Loughlinstown to north of Shankill, where the M11 motorway commences as the &quot;Bray/Shankill Bypass&quot;.

The entire length of the N11, from Mount Merrion to the Loughlinstown roundabout, is provided with a Quality Bus Corridor (QBC) bus lane. Dublin Bus Route 46A operates over this stretch of road as far as the junction with Kill Lane in Foxrock. The 145 links Bray to various parts of the city centre as far as Heuston Train Station

==Link with M50==
Along the &quot;Shankill Bypass&quot;, the M11 is joined by the Dublin&#x27;s M50 motorway partial ring road, which terminates at a major junction along the M11, which opened in June 2005. This link allows motorists to drive on continuous motorway and dual carriageway from Oilgate, County Wexford to various destinations via the M50 and the national roads it serves. These roads include the N7, the N4, the N3, the N2 and the M1.

Traffic proceeding north on the M11 is given a choice to stay on the main carriageway (which becomes the M50), or take the exit at what is junction 17 on the M50, in order to stay on the M11, following the N11 and the R138 into the city centre.

==Route through Wicklow and Wexford==
West of Bray in County Wicklow, the motorway ends, with the N11 continuing south as dual carriageway through the &quot;Glen of the Downs&quot;. The upgrading of the road to dual carriageway through the &quot;Glen of the Downs&quot; was controversial, as the valley is a wooded area. Expanding the road resulted in the removal of some woodland. A campaign of protests, mainly by environmental activists, led to long delays in the construction of this section of road, but the work was eventually completed with a minimal disruption to the woodland. After &quot;Glen of the Downs&quot; the N11 continues south to bypass Kilpedder and Newtownmountkennedy. The road becomes the M11 again at Junction 14 and bypasses Ashford, Rathnew and Arklow (which was bypassed by a dual-carriageway route opened in January 1999 and re-designated as motorway in August 2009). 

Just north of Inch, the M11 enters County Wexford. The route continues South, bypassing Gorey and Clogh. This section was also re-designated as motorway from 28 August 2009. The former N11 road between Newtownmountkennedy and Gorey is now signposted as the R772 regional road. The M11 then bypasses Camolin, Ferns and Enniscorthy. At Ballydawmore, about 4.25 km east-northeast of Enniscorthy, the N30 from New Ross, which also connects to the N80 from Tullamore at Clavass about 5 km north of Enniscorthy, meets the M11 at a junction, which also connects to R744 road. At the end of the Enniscorthy Bypass the motorway section ends at the Scurlocksbush roundabout. The N11 then continues as a single carriageway. South of here, the N11 passes through Oilegate, County Wexford, continuing south through Ferrycarrig, and crossing the River Slaney to terminate on a bypass west of Wexford where it meets the N25 from Waterford at the Ballindinas roundabout.

==Upgrades==
The N11 has been gradually upgraded from single to dual carriageway standard from the 1950s to the present, with improvements taking place at an accelerated pace in recent years. The first short stretch of dual carriageway on the road, and the first stretch of dual carriageway in Ireland, was built in the 1950s between the Stillorgan Road/Newtownpark Avenue junction (&quot;White&#x27;s Cross&quot;) and Foxrock Church (this stretch was substantially widened around the turn of the millennium). Subsequent short stretches of dual carriageway, at Loughlinstown, between Bray and Kilpedder, and from Donnybrook to Stillorgan were constructed during the early to mid-1970s, this phase ending with the opening of the Stillorgan bypass in October 1977. Since that time, these sections have been joined up through further improvements.

===Timeline (from 1970)===
* 1970: Kilcroney dual carriageway (with at grade junctions) from Fassaroe to Kilmacanogue, west of Bray. 3 km.

* 1984: Cabinteely and Cornelscourt bypass. At grade 4 lane dual carriageway with hard shoulder. 2 km.
* 1986: Old 1950s dual carriageway replaced by at grade 4 lane dual carriageway with hard shoulder between White&#x27;s Cross and the Cabinteely bypass. 1 km.
* 1990: Newtownmountkennedy bypass. Four lane dual carriageway with hard shoulders and GSJ. 5 km.
* 1991: M11 Bray-Shankill bypass. Motorway from the 1960s Loughlinstown dual carriageway to the Kilcroney (1970) dual carriageway. 5 km.
* 1993: Fassaroe Bridge; grade separated junction created at the end of the M11/start of Kilcroney dual carriageway.
* 1995: Ram Bridge; grade separated junction created linking the N11 to the southern end of Bray.
* 1999: Arklow bypass; fully grade separated dual carriageway (re-classified as motorway in 2009). 10 km.
* 2003: Glen of the Downs dual carriageway joining the dual carriageway north of Kilmacanogue to the 1972 Kilpedder bypass. 5 km.
* 2004: New dual carriageway replaced the 1960s &quot;Loughlinstown dual carriageway&quot; and included a grade separated junction with the R118. 3 km.
* 2004: Ashford/Rathnew bypass; fully grade separated dual carriageway (partially re-classified as motorway in 2009). 14 km.
* 2007: Gorey bypass; fully grade separated dual carriageway (re-classified as motorway in 2009). 22 km.
* 2008: Grade separated junction created on the Kilpedder bypass (1972) to link with the new R774 dual carriageway to Greystones.
* 2015: Arklow-Rathnew; motorway from Rathnew to Arklow. Officially opened to traffic on 13 July 2015. 14 km 
* 2019: Enniscorthy bypass; motorway from Clogh to Scurlocksbush, also connecting the M11 to the N30 and the N80. Officially opened to traffic on 18 July 2019. 27 km Since it was completed in 2019, dual carriageway or motorway extends from Donnybrook near central Dublin (R138) to north of Oilgate in County Wexford.

Initial planning is underway to bypass Oilgate by building a new dual carriageway N11 from the end of the current M11 Enniscorthy bypass to the N25 near Wexford Town. A new section of N25 will complete the up-grade of Euroroute 01 between the M50 and Rosslare Harbour.

If this project was completed as planned, there would be no single carriageway sections of the N11 left.

On 30 September 2008, the Department of Transport proposed that the dual carriageway sections from Ashford to south of Rathnew, and from north of Arklow to south of Gorey, be reclassified as motorway under the Roads Act 2007. The Statutory Instrument for these reclassifications was passed on 2 July 2009 and came into effect on 28 August 2009. There are two sections of M11 motorway forming part of the N11 route.

<text>The Road to Oz is the fifth book in L. Frank Baum&#x27;s Oz series. It was originally published on July 10, 1909 and documents the adventures of Dorothy Gale&#x27;s fourth visit to the Land of Oz. It was followed by &quot;The Emerald City of Oz&quot; (1910).

==Plot==
While Dorothy Gale is at home in Kansas one day, she and her pet dog Toto meet the Shaggy Man who comes walking past the Gale farm. He is a friendly, yet slightly senile hobo with an optimistic, care free mentality. He politely asks Dorothy for directions to Butterfield, which is the nearest town on the prairie. The girl agrees to show him the way, bringing her dog with her.

Further on, the road splits into seven paths. They take the seventh one and soon find themselves lost in what appears to be another dimension. The trio meets Button-Bright, a cute and wealthy little boy in a sailor&#x27;s outfit who is always getting lost. Later, the companions encounter Polychrome, the beautiful and ethereal Daughter of the Rainbow who is stranded on Earth. Polychrome explains that she accidentally fell off her father&#x27;s bow while dancing on it. The bow ascended into the atmosphere and back into the clouds before she was able to climb her way back on it, thus being left behind.

Dorothy, Toto, the Shaggy Man, Button-Bright, and Polychrome come to the peculiar town of Foxville, where anthropomorphic foxes live. With prompting from King Dox of Foxville, Dorothy deduces that she and Toto are obviously on another &quot;fairy adventure&quot; that will ultimately lead them to the magical Land of Oz, just in time for Princess Ozma&#x27;s royal birthday party. The king takes a particular liking to Button Bright, whom he considers astute and clever due to his tabula rasa-like mind. Believing that the human face does not suit one so clever, Dox gives him a fox&#x27;s head which he is unable to remove. A similar event subsequently happens to the Shaggy Man, when King Kik-a-Bray of Dunkiton confers a donkey&#x27;s head upon him — also in reward for cleverness, even though it is implied that Foxville and Dunkiton exist at odds with one another. Though both of them ask Dorothy to procure them invitations to Princess Ozma&#x27;s birthday party.

After meeting the Musicker (who produces music from his breath) and fighting off the Scoodlers (who fight by removing their own heads and throwing them at the travelers), Dorothy and her companions reach the edge of the fatal Deadly Desert completely surrounding the Land of Oz. There, the Shaggy Man&#x27;s friend Johnny Dooit builds a &quot;sand-boat&quot; by which they may cross. This is necessary because physical contact with the desert&#x27;s sands, as of this book and &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot; (1907), will turn the travelers to dust.

Upon reaching the Land of Oz, Dorothy and her companions are warmly welcomed by the mechanical man Tik-Tok and Billina the Yellow Hen. They proceed in company to come in their travels to the Truth Pond where Button Bright and the Shaggy Man regain their true heads by bathing in its waters. They meet the Tin Woodman, the Scarecrow, and Jack Pumpkinhead who journey with them to the imperial capital known as the Emerald City for Ozma&#x27;s grand birthday bash. Dorothy meets up with Ozma as her chariot is pulled in by the Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger.

As preparations for Ozma&#x27;s birthday party are made, the guests include Dorothy, Scarecrow, Tin Woodman, Cowardly Lion, the Wizard of Oz, Jack Pumpkinhead, the Sawhorse, Tik-Tok, Billina, Jellia Jamb, Woggle-Bug, Hungry Tiger, the Good Witch of the North, Shaggy Man, Button-Bright, Polychrome, and characters from all over Nonestica such as Santa Claus, a band of Ryls, and a bunch of Knooks from the Forest of Burzee, Queen Zixi of Ix, the Queen of Merryland, four wooden soldiers, and the Candy Man from Merryland, the Braided Man from Boboland&#x27;s Pyramid Mountain, the Queen of Ev, King Evoldo, and his nine siblings from the Land of Ev, King Bud and Princess Fluff from Noland, and John Dough, Chick the Cherub, and Para Bruin the Rubber Bear from Hiland and Loland. While invitations were sent to King Dox, King Kik-a-Bray, and Johnny Dooit, Princess Ozma couldn&#x27;t procure an invitation to the Musicker due to a chance that his uncontrollable vocal tic might arouse violence against him. The Shaggy Man receives permission to stay in Oz permanently. He is also given a new suit of clothes having bobtails in place of his former costume&#x27;s ragged edges, so that he may retain his name and identity.

After everyone has presented their gifts and feasted at a lavish banquet in Ozma&#x27;s honor, the Wizard of Oz demonstrates a method of using bubbles as transportation by which to send everyone home. Polychrome is finally found by her rainbow family and she is magically lifted into the sky when she climbs back onto her bow. Button-Bright leaves with Santa Claus in a soap bubble with the Sawhorse loaned to Santa Claus. Dorothy and Toto are finally wished back home to Kansas again by Ozma&#x27;s use of the Magic Belt.

==Publication history==
The sales figures of Baum&#x27;s other fantasy novels always lagged behind his Oz novels; it has therefore been theorized that the &quot;guest appearances&quot; of his non-Oz characters in &quot;The Road to Oz&quot; were a marketing ploy to raise interest in those other titles.

This is the only Oz book to be printed on colored pages instead of with colored pictures. The colored pages represent the signature colors of the various countries of Oz that Dorothy and her companions travel through on their way to the Emerald City.

The Tin Woodman&#x27;s garden features images of Dorothy and Toto, representing them as they first arrived in Oz. The illustrator, John R. Neill, apparently takes this description literally, by causing the statues to resemble the illustrations made by his predecessor, W.W. Denslow. This is in contrast to the &quot;real&quot; Dorothy, who is drawn here much as she is drawn in all of the Oz books illustrated by Neill. It is implied that she is amused by the differences present.

==Reception==
In &quot;A Brief Guide to Oz&quot;, Paul Simpson notes, &quot;&quot;The Road to Oz&quot; contradicts earlier stories by claiming there&#x27;s no money in Oz, with many Oz scholars speculating that Baum is suggesting a very communist ethos at work.&quot;

<text>Claria Corporation (formerly Gator Corporation) was a software company based in Redwood City, California that invented “Behavioral Marketing”, a new form of online advertising. It was founded in 1998 by Denis Coleman (co-founder of Symantec), Stanford MBA Sasha Zorovic (Saša Zorović),&lt;ref name=&quot;Zorovic/TR095&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;impel.ai/hires&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;businesswire/Advisor360&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dtiq/sasa-zorovic&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;prnewswire/v12-data&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and engineer Mark Pennell, based on work Zorovic had done at Stanford. In March 1999 Jeff McFadden was hired as CEO and Zorovic was effectively forced out.

Its name was later used interchangeably with its Gain advertising network, which it claimed serviced over 50 million users. Claria exited the adware business at the end of second quarter 2006, and eventually shut down completely in October 2008.

The &quot;Gator&quot; (also known as Gain AdServer) products collected personal information from its unknowing users, including websites visited and portions of credit card numbers to target and display ads on the computers of web surfers. It billed itself as the &quot;leader in online behavioral marketing&quot;. The company changed its name to Claria Corporation on October 30, 2003 in an effort to &quot;better communicate the expanding breadth of offerings that [they] provide to consumers and advertisers&quot;, according to CEO and President Jeff McFadden.

==Products==
=== Gator ===
Originally released in 1999, Gator was most frequently installed together with programs being offered free of charge, such as Go!Zilla, or Kazaa. The development of these programs was partially funded by revenue from advertising displayed by Gator. By mid-2003 Gator was installed on an estimated 35 million PCs.

Even though Gator was installed with an uninstall available via Add/Remove Programs in the Control Panel on Microsoft Windows, many spyware removal tools can also detect and remove it. Gator&#x27;s end user license agreement attempted to disallow its manual removal by prohibiting &quot;unauthorized means&quot; of uninstallation.

The Gator software undercut the fundamental ad-supported nature of many Internet publishers by replacing banner ads on web sites with its own, thereby depriving the content provider of the revenue necessary to continue providing that content. In June 2002 a number of large publishers, including the &quot;New York Post&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; and Dow Jones &amp; Company, sued Gator Software for its practice of replacing ads.
Most of the lawsuits were settled out of court in February 2003.

Gator attempted to combat spyware labels with litigation. In September 2003 the company threatened sites such as PC Pitstop with libel lawsuits.

As part of a settlement signed Sept. 30, (2003), PC Pitstop--which scans computers for hostile and otherwise undesirable code--removed pages from its Spyware Information Center with such titles as &quot;Is Gator Spyware?&quot; and the &quot;Gator Boycott List.&quot;

In February 2004, Gator made a confidential settlement of litigation brought against it by seven top newspaper publishers, including &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, the &quot;New York Post&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and Dow Jones. The Washington Post, L.L. Bean and &quot;Extended Stay America&quot; suits were similarly settled.

=== Other defunct applications ===
Gator corporation released a suite of &quot;free&quot; Internet applications that performed various tasks. However, after installing the applications, a user would continually be shown ads from the Gain network, even when the programs were not running in the foreground. This suite included:
* Gator - Gator itself was initially marketed as a password keeper.
* eWallet - a program that will automatically fill in personal information on webpages from a stored set of data entered by the user.
* GotSmiley
* Dashbar - an advertisement supported search toolbar by Claria. Intrusive in that it displays pop up ads during an Internet browsing session.
* Date Manager
* Precision Time
* Screenscenes
* Weatherscope
* WebSecureAlert

While using the software, a user was shown advertisements. According to Computer Associates&#x27; spyware information center, all applications in the suite are classified as both adware and spyware, as they both display ads unrelated to the product while the primary user interface is not visible. These programs all employ the user&#x27;s Internet connection to report behavior information back to Claria. Although the user&#x27;s explicit consent is always required to install these applications, Claria took advantage of the fact that most users choose not bothering to educate themselves about what they are installing. In most cases, during the install process, users must choose whether to install the &quot;free&quot; version (which serves lots of ads as described above) or to pay the $30 for a version that serves no ads. Since the announcement to shut the ad network down, Claria has stopped accepting payment for &quot;ad free&quot; versions.

== Backers ==
Despite its unpopular reputation, Claria Corporation received backing from major venture capital firms, including Greylock, Technology Crossover Ventures, and U.S. Venture Partners. Andy Bechtolsheim was an early investor.
They filed for a $150 million IPO in April 2004, stating income of $35 million on revenues of $90 million in 2003.
Investors were concerned that its practices might be illegal, at least in Utah at the time.
Another concern was that most revenue came from one partner: Yahoo Overture.
Claria withdrew the filing in August 2004.

== Recent news ==
In July 2005, Microsoft Corporation came under fire when it revealed that their anti-spyware product would no longer quarantine Claria software as &quot;spyware&quot; (though it still offered users the option to remove the software). Microsoft was reportedly contemplating the purchase of Claria, which many consumers felt to be a conflict of interest. Other spyware-reporting agencies, such as Computer Associates and Panda Software&#x27;s TruPrevent Technologies, still label Claria products as both adware and spyware.

In March 2006, Claria claimed that it would be exiting the adware business and focusing on personalized search technology.

On July 1, 2006, Claria ceased displaying pop-up ads. Around this time, a new company NebuAd was formed with some former Claria employees with another approach to targeted advertisements. On April 21, 2008, Claria sold the gator.com domain.

In October 2008, rebranded as Jelly Cloud, the company quietly shut down.

<doc id="353206" wikidata="Q290560" url="?curid=353206" title="Benjamin Graham">
<text>Benjamin Graham (; né Grossbaum; May 9, 1894 – September 21, 1976) was a British-born American financial analyst, economist, accountant, investor and professor. He is widely known as the &quot;father of value investing&quot;, and wrote two of the discipline&#x27;s founding texts: &quot;Security Analysis&quot; (1934) with David Dodd, and &quot;The Intelligent Investor&quot; (1949). His investment philosophy stressed independent thinking, emotional detachment, and careful security analysis, emphasizing the importance of distinguishing the price of a stock from the value of its underlying business.

After graduating from Columbia University at age 20, Graham started his career on Wall Street, eventually founding Graham–Newman Corp., a successful mutual fund. He also taught investing for many years at Columbia Business School, where one of his students was Warren Buffett. Graham later taught at the Anderson School of Management at the University of California, Los Angeles.

Graham laid the groundwork for value investing at mutual funds, hedge funds, diversified holding companies, and other investment vehicles. He was the driving force behind the establishment of the profession of security analysis and the Chartered Financial Analyst designation. He also advocated the creation of index funds decades before they were introduced. Throughout his career, Graham had many notable disciples who went on to earn substantial success as investors, including Irving Kahn and Warren Buffett, who described Graham as the second most influential person in his life after his own father. Among other well-known investors influenced by Graham were Charles D. Ellis, Mario Gabelli, Seth Klarman, Howard Marks, John Neff and Sir John Templeton.

==Early life and education==
Graham was born Benjamin Grossbaum on May 9, 1894, in London, England, to Jewish parents. On his mother&#x27;s side, he was the great-grandson of Rabbi Yaakov Gesundheit and a cousin of neuroscientist Ralph Waldo Gerard. He moved with his family to New York City when he was one year old. The family changed his name from Grossbaum to Graham to assimilate into American society and avoid anti-Semitic and anti-German sentiments.

After his death of his father, who owned a successful porcelain shop, and the Panic of 1907, the family fell into poverty. That experience helped shape Graham&#x27;s lifelong quest for investment values. Graham excelled as a student, graduating as salutatorian of his class at Columbia, finishing his studies in three-and-a-half years after entering at age 16. Before the end of his senior year, the college offered him teaching positions in three different departments: mathematics, English, and philosophy. Graham chose instead to help support his widowed mother by taking a job on Wall Street, where he later ran private partnerships and, starting in 1936, the Graham-Newman fund. Early on, Graham made a name for himself with &quot;The Northern Pipeline Affair&quot;, an early case of shareholder activism involving John D. Rockefeller. Graham&#x27;s research indicated Northern Pipeline Co. held vast cash and bond assets that he believed were not being put to good use and bought enough shares to force a proxy vote to distribute these assets to shareholders.

Later, Graham patented two innovative hand-held calculators, wrote a Broadway play called &quot;Baby Pompadour,&quot; and taught himself Spanish so he could translate a major Uruguayan novel, Mario Benedetti’s The Truce, into English. (By the end of his life, Graham knew at least seven languages.)

== Investment and academic career ==
His first book &quot;Security Analysis&quot;, which he co-authored with David Dodd, was published in 1934. In &quot;Security Analysis&quot;, he proposed a clear definition of investment that was distinguished from what he deemed speculation. It read, &quot;An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and a satisfactory return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.&quot;

Warren Buffett describes &quot;The Intelligent Investor&quot; (1949) as &quot;the best book about investing ever written.&quot; Graham exhorted the stock market participant to first draw a fundamental distinction between investment and speculation. 

Graham wrote that the owner of stocks should regard them first and foremost as conferring part ownership in a business. With that perspective in mind, the stock owner should be unconcerned with erratic fluctuations in stock prices, since in the short term the stock market behaves like a voting machine, but in the long term it acts like a weighing machine (i.e. its true value will be reflected in its stock price in the long run). 

Graham distinguished between defensive and enterprising investors. The defensive investor seeks to minimize the time and effort -- and, above all, the worry -- of investing. So the defensive investor seldom trades, renouncing the attempt to forecast market behavior and security prices, instead holding for the long term. The enterprising investor, in contrast, is one who has more time, interest, and can devote the effort to original analysis seeking exceptional buys in the market. Graham recommended that enterprising investors devote substantial time and effort to analyze the financial state of companies. When a company is available at a discount to its intrinsic value, a &quot;margin of safety&quot; exists, which makes it suitable for investment.

Graham wrote that &quot;investment is most intelligent when it is most businesslike.&quot; By that he meant that investing, like running a business, is a systematic effort to maximize the likelihood of earning a reasonable return and to minimize the probability of suffering a severe loss. Thinking for yourself is vital: &quot;You are neither right nor wrong because the crowd disagrees with you,&quot; Graham wrote. &quot;You are right because your data and reasoning are right.&quot; 

Graham&#x27;s favorite metaphor is that of Mr. Market, a fellow who turns up every day at the investor&#x27;s door offering to buy or sell his shares at a different price. Usually, the price quoted by Mr. Market seems plausible, but occasionally it is ridiculous. The investor is free either to agree with his quoted price and trade with him, or to ignore him completely. Mr. Market doesn&#x27;t mind this, and will be back the following day to quote another price. The investor should not regard the whims of Mr. Market as determining the value of the shares that the investor owns. The investor should profit from market folly rather than participate in it. The investor is best off concentrating on how the underlying businesses perform, not on how Mr. Market behaves.

Graham was critical of the corporations of his day for obfuscated and irregular financial reporting that made it difficult for investors to discern the true state of the business&#x27;s finances. He was an advocate of dividend payments to shareholders rather than businesses hoarding all of their profits as retained earnings. He also criticized those who advised that some types of stocks were a good buy at any price, because of the prospect of potentially unlimited earnings growth, without a thorough analysis of the business&#x27;s actual financial condition. These observations remain relevant today.

Graham&#x27;s investment performance was approximately a ~20% annualized return over 1936 to 1956. The overall market performance for the same time period was 12.2% annually on average. Even so, both Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman Charlie Munger have said they consider Graham&#x27;s methods necessary but not sufficient for success in contemporary investing, because Graham placed too little emphasis on the potential for future growth. As Buffett told journalist Carol Loomis in 1988 for Fortune, &quot;Boy, if I had listened only to Ben [and not also to Charlie Munger], would I ever be a lot poorer.&quot;

Graham&#x27;s largest gain was from GEICO, in which the firm Graham-Newman purchased a 50% interest in 1948 for $712,500. To comply with a regulatory limitation, Graham-Newman was ordered by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to distribute its GEICO stock to the fund&#x27;s investors. An investor who owned 100 shares of the Graham-Newman fund in 1948 (worth $11,413) and who held on to the GEICO distribution would have had $1.66 million by 1972. Graham-Newman Corp. closed in 1956 when Graham retired from active investing. GEICO was eventually acquired in whole by Berkshire Hathaway in 1996, having previously been saved by Buffett and John J. Byrne in 1976.

==Personal life==
Graham married three times and had four children.

On September 21, 1976, Graham died in Aix-en-Provence, France, at the age of 82.

==Legacy==
His contributions spanned numerous fields, primarily fundamental value investing.

Graham is considered the &quot;father of value investing.&quot; His two books, &quot;Security Analysis&quot; and &quot;The Intelligent Investor,&quot; defined his investment philosophy, especially what it means to be a value investor. His most famous student is Warren Buffett, who is consistently ranked among the wealthiest persons in the world. According to Buffett, Graham used to say that he wished every day to do something foolish, something creative, and something generous. And Buffett noted, Graham excelled most at the last.

While many value investors have been influenced by Graham, his most notable investing disciples include Charles Brandes, William J. Ruane, Irving Kahn, and Walter J. Schloss. In addition, Graham&#x27;s thoughts on investing have influenced hedge-fund managers Bill Ackman, Seth Klarman, Whitney Tilson, and Nancy Zimmerman. While some of Graham&#x27;s investing concepts are now regarded as superseded or outdated, most are still recognized as important, and &quot;Security Analysis&quot; or &quot;The Intelligent Investor&quot; are required reading for new hires at many investment firms around the world.

Graham also made contributions to economic theory. Most notably, he proposed a new basis for both U.S. and global currency as an alternative to the gold standard. Graham regarded this currency theory as his most important professional work; it gained renewed attention decades after his death in the aftermath of the 2007–2008 financial crisis.

<text>Eric Norman Thompson (9 November 1929 – 30 November 1982) was an English actor, scriptwriter and stage director. He is best remembered for creating and performing the English narration for &quot;The Magic Roundabout&quot;, which he adapted from the original French &quot;Le Manège enchanté&quot;.

==Early life==
Eric Norman Thompson was born on 9 November 1929 in Sleaford, Lincolnshire, England, the son of Annie (née Jackson) and George Henry Thompson, a hotel waiter, and grew up in Rudgwick, Sussex, attending Collyer&#x27;s School, Horsham. He trained to be an actor at the Old Vic acting school in London and joined the Old Vic theatre company in 1952.

==Career==
Thompson worked regularly for the BBC, and was a presenter of the children&#x27;s television programme &quot;Play School&quot; from 1964 to 1967. He was best known as the narrator of &quot;The Magic Roundabout&quot;, for which he also wrote the English language scripts, using the visuals from the original French &quot;Le Manège enchanté&quot;. These were transmitted from October 1965 to January 1977. Thompson rarely worked in television after his voice became well known, but occasionally appeared in programmes including &quot;Doctor Finlay&#x27;s Casebook&quot; (episode: &quot;Beware of the Dog&quot;), &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in the serial &quot;The Massacre of St Bartholomew&#x27;s Eve&quot; in 1966, and in two episodes of &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, in 1964 and 1969 (playing two different characters).

==Personal life==
Thompson married Scottish actress Phyllida Law, whom he met while at the Old Vic in 1957. Their daughters Emma and Sophie Thompson followed into acting.

In 1967, he had a heart attack, attributed to overwork and heavy smoking, and he therefore changed his focus to directing. He directed Kenneth Williams in &quot;My Fat Friend&quot; in 1972 and the conflicts between the two are extensively discussed in Williams&#x27; diaries.

On 30 November 1982, Thompson died of a heart attack in London.

<doc id="353210" wikidata="Q289130" url="?curid=353210" title="The Last Battle">
<text>The Last Battle is a portal fantasy novel written by British author C. S. Lewis, published by The Bodley Head in 1956. It was the seventh and final novel in &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; (1950–1956). Like the other novels in the series, it was illustrated by Pauline Baynes and her work has been retained in many later editions.

&quot;The Last Battle&quot; is set almost entirely in the Narnia world and the English children who participate arrive only in the middle of the narrative. The novel is set some 200 Narnian years after &quot;The Silver Chair&quot; and about 2500 years (and 49 Earth years) since the creation of the world narrated in &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot;. A false Aslan is set up in the north-western borderlands and conflict between true and false Narnians merges with that between Narnia and Calormen, whose people worship Tash. It concludes with termination of the world by Aslan, after a &quot;last battle&quot; that is practically lost.
Macmillan US published an American edition within the calendar year. 

Lewis and &quot;The Last Battle&quot; won the annual Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year&#x27;s best children&#x27;s book by a British subject. The author wrote to illustrator Baynes, &quot;is it not rather &#x27;our&#x27; medal? I&#x27;m sure the illustrations were taken into account as well as the text.&quot;

==Plot==
In the western regions of Narnia, the clever and greedy ape Shift persuades the naive donkey Puzzle to wear a lion&#x27;s skin (an echo from Aesop&#x27;s story of The Ass in the Lion&#x27;s Skin) and introduces him to the other Narnians as the Great Lion Aslan. Shift, posing as Aslan&#x27;s spokesman, uses Aslan&#x27;s name to persuade the Narnians to cut down the trees for lumber. Shift pockets the profits and garners support from the Calormenes – led by Rishda Tarkaan – by claiming that Aslan is another name for Tash, a bloodthirsty deity worshipped by the Calormenes. Those who question Shift&#x27;s words are invited into a large stable where &quot;Tashlan&quot; is said to reside, only to be stealthily murdered by one of Rishda&#x27;s men. 

King Tirian, a descendant of King Caspian X, is warned by Roonwit the Centaur that strange and evil things are happening to Narnia and that the stars portend ominous developments. Tirian and his friend Jewel the Unicorn hear word of the death of the Dryads and rashly set out to confront the danger, instructing Roonwit to gather a small army to join them. Finding two Calormenes abusing a Narnian Talking Horse, Tirian and Jewel kill them both in a blind rage. Ashamed, they give themselves up to &quot;Aslan&quot;.

Awaiting judgment, Tirian recognizes the farce that Shift has fabricated in league with Rishda and the talking cat Ginger. When he accuses Shift of lying, Tirian is tied to a tree for the night to face judgment the following morning. While the woodland creatures are sympathetic to his suffering, they cannot bring themselves to defy &quot;Aslan&quot;.

Tirian calls upon Aslan for help, and sees High King Peter and several others in a vision. He asks them to come to his aid. Shortly afterwards Jill Pole and Eustace Scrubb arrive in Narnia from Earth. They relate that Peter and Edmund Pevensie went to London to dig up the magic rings from the old house of Professor Kirke (mentioned in the previous story) in hopes that Jill and Eustace can use them to get to Narnia. But feeling a shock in their railway carriage on Earth, Eustace and Jill find themselves in Narnia without ever seeing the rings. Tirian gives Eustace and Jill a warm welcome.

They release Tirian and rescue Jewel. In the stable, Jill finds Puzzle, who comes to understand his folly and joins Tirian&#x27;s side. A band of Dwarfs are also rescued, but their faith in Aslan has been shattered and they renounce their allegiance, proclaiming &quot;the Dwarfs are for the Dwarfs&quot;. Only one Dwarf named Poggin remains faithful to Aslan and joins the group. Tirian learns that Shift and Rishda have inadvertently summoned the real Tash to Narnia when he and the others see him travelling north towards the stable.

Farsight the Eagle arrives bearing grim news: Roonwit and the Narnian army loyal to Tirian have all been massacred by the Calormenes who have taken Cair Paravel in Tirian&#x27;s absence. Tirian and his small force advance on the stable to expose the truth of Shift&#x27;s deception. Ginger, sent in to aid in the deception, runs out in terror, having lost his ability to speak. Emeth, one of Rishda&#x27;s men and a devout follower of Tash, insists on seeing his god. Rishda tries to dissuade him, but Emeth enters the empty stable. Angry at the deception in the name of Tash, he kills another soldier who was stationed in the stable to murder the rebellious Narnians, but Emeth then disappears. 

Outside the stable, Tirian&#x27;s group engages Shift and the Calormenes, but most of the remaining Narnians on either side are all either killed or sacrificed to Tash by being thrown into the stable. Tirian throws Shift into the stable and Tash devours Shift. Realising that real danger lies in the stable, the terrified Rishda offers the remaining Narnians as sacrifices to avoid the wrath of Tash. Tirian, left alone and fighting for his life, drags Rishda into the stable and finds himself in a vast and lush plain. Tash seizes Rishda and advances on Tirian, but is stopped by the &quot;Friends of Narnia&quot;: Digory Kirke, Polly Plummer, Peter Pevensie and his siblings Edmund and Lucy. Susan is absent as she has ceased to believe in Narnia. Peter orders Tash to return to his realm and Tash vanishes with Rishda in his clutches.

The real Aslan appears and praises Tirian for his valiant struggle in defense of Narnia. The faithless Dwarfs are present but cannot see they are in Aslan&#x27;s country; they perceive themselves to be locked in an actual stable. Aslan demonstrates that, without their faith, even he cannot help them. The Friends ask Aslan to heal Narnia, but he admits that even he cannot undo the evil that has been sown and he brings the world to an end: Father Time is awoken and calls the stars down from the skies into the sea. The inhabitants of Narnia gather outside the barn to be judged by Aslan. The faithful enter Aslan&#x27;s country while those who have opposed or deserted him become ordinary animals and vanish in his shadow to a fate unknown even to the narrator. The vegetation is consumed by dragons, salamanders and giant lizards until they grow old, die, and rot into skeletal structures. The sea rises to cover Narnia. The land freezes when Father Time puts out the sun after it destroys the moon. At Aslan&#x27;s command, King Peter shuts the door on Narnia. Aslan leads the faithful to his country, telling them to go &quot;further up and further in&quot;. Soon they encounter Emeth; Aslan has accepted his faithful service to Tash because it was offered in good faith and therefore truly done to Aslan, whereas Tash is served only by evil.

Aslan takes the Friends to a &quot;true&quot; version of Narnia, the previous Narnia having been an imperfect and corruptible shadow. As they advance, the Friends meet and reunite with characters from previous adventures who have been dead for centuries; Aslan reveals that the Friends may also stay as they had died in a train accident on Earth. Aslan sheds his lion form (&quot;And as He spoke He no longer looked like a lion&quot;), and the series ends with the revelation that this was only the beginning of the true story, &quot;which goes on for ever, and in which every chapter is better than the one before&quot;.

<text>Abū al-Qāsim Khalaf ibn al-&#x27;Abbās al-Zahrāwī al-Ansari (;‎ c. 936–1013), popularly known as al-Zahrawi (), Latinised as Albucasis or Abulcasis (from Arabic &quot;Abū al-Qāsim&quot;), was a physician, surgeon and chemist from al-Andalus. He is considered one of the greatest surgeons of the Middle Ages.

Al-Zahrawi&#x27;s principal work is the &quot;Kitab al-Tasrif&quot;, a thirty-volume encyclopedia of medical practices. The surgery chapter of this work was later translated into Latin, attaining popularity and becoming the standard textbook in Europe for the next five hundred years. Al-Zahrawi&#x27;s pioneering contributions to the field of surgical procedures and instruments had an enormous impact in the East and West well into the modern period, where some of his discoveries are still applied in medicine to this day. He pioneered the use of catgut for internal stitches, and his surgical instruments are still used today to treat people.

He was the first physician to identify the hereditary nature of haemophilia and describe an abdominal pregnancy, a subtype of ectopic pregnancy that in those days was a fatal affliction, and was first to discover the root cause of paralysis. He also developed surgical devices for Caesarean sections and cataract surgeries.

== Biography ==
Al-Zahrawi was born in the city of Azahara, 8 kilometers northwest of Cordoba, Andalusia. His birth date is not known for sure, however, scholars agree that he was born around 936, the year his birthplace city of Azahara was founded. The nisba (attributive title), &quot;Al-Ansari&quot;, in his name, suggests origin from the Medinian tribe of Al-Ansar, thus, tracing his ancestry back to Medina in the Arabian Peninsula.

He lived most of his life in Cordoba. It is also where he studied, taught and practiced medicine and surgery until shortly before his death in about 1013, two years after the sacking of Azahara.

Few details remain regarding his life, aside from his published work, due to the destruction of El-Zahra during later Castillian-Andalusian conflicts. His name first appears in the writings of Abu Muhammad bin Hazm (993–1064), who listed him among the greatest physicians of Moorish Spain. But we have the first detailed biography of al-Zahrawī from al-Ḥumaydī&#x27;s &quot;Jadhwat al-Muqtabis&quot; (&quot;On Andalusian Savants&quot;), completed six decades after al-Zahrawi&#x27;s death.

Al-Zahrawi was a court physician to the Andalusian caliph Al-Hakam II. He was a contemporary of Andalusian chemists such as Ibn al-Wafid, al-Majriti and Artephius. He devoted his entire life and genius to the advancement of medicine as a whole and surgery in particular. As a court physician, Zahrawi had access to the most advanced medical knowledge and resources of the time, allowing him to develop new techniques and instruments for surgical procedures. Zahrawi&#x27;s time as a court physician to Al-Hakam II allowed him to develop his skills and knowledge as a physician and surgeon, and to make significant contributions to the field of medicine. His work helped to lay the foundation for modern surgical techniques and has had a lasting impact on the practice of medicine.

== Surgical career ==
Al-Zahrawi specialized in curing disease by cauterization. He invented several devices used during surgery, for purposes such as inspection of the interior of the urethra and also inspection, applying and removing foreign bodies from the throat, the ear and other body organs. He was also the first to illustrate the various cannulae and the first to treat a wart with an iron tube and caustic metal as a boring instrument.

While al-Zahrawi never performed the surgical procedure of tracheotomy, he did treat a slave girl who had cut her own throat in a suicide attempt. Al-Zahrawi sewed up the wound and the girl recovered, thereby proving that an incision in the larynx could heal. In describing this important case-history he wrote:

Al-Zahrawi also pioneered neurosurgery and neurological diagnosis. He is known to have performed surgical treatments of head injuries, skull fractures, spinal injuries, hydrocephalus, subdural effusions and headache. The first clinical description of an operative procedure for hydrocephalus was given by Al-Zahrawi who clearly describes the evacuation of superficial intracranial fluid in hydrocephalic children.

== &quot;Kitab al-Tasrif&quot; ==

Al-Zahrawi&#x27;s thirty-volume medical encyclopedia, &quot;Kitāb al-Taṣrīf&quot;, completed in the year 1000, covered a broad range of medical topics, including on surgery, medicine, orthopaedics, ophthalmology, pharmacology, nutrition, dentistry, childbirth, and pathology.
The first volume in the encyclopedia is concerned with general principles of medicine, the second with pathology, while much of the rest discuss topics regarding pharmacology and drugs. The last treatise and the most celebrated one is about surgery. Al-Zahrawi stated that he chose to discuss surgery in the last volume because surgery is the highest form of medicine, and one must not practice it until he becomes well-acquainted with all other branches of medicine.

The work contained data that had accumulated during a career that spanned almost 50 years of training, teaching and practice. In it he also wrote of the importance of a positive doctor-patient relationship and wrote affectionately of his students, whom he referred to as &quot;my children&quot;. He also emphasized the importance of treating patients irrespective of their social status. He encouraged the close observation of individual cases in order to make the most accurate diagnosis and the best possible treatment.

Not always properly credited, modern evaluation of &quot;Kitab al-Tasrif&quot; manuscript has revealed on early descriptions of some medical procedures that were ascribed to later physicians. For example, Al-Zahrawi&#x27;s &quot;Kitab al-Tasrif&quot; described both what would later become known as &quot;Kocher&#x27;s method&quot; for treating a dislocated shoulder and &quot;Walcher position&quot; in obstetrics. Moreover, the &quot;Kitab al-Tasrif&quot; described how to ligature blood vessels almost 600 years before Ambroise Paré, and was the first recorded book to explain the hereditary nature of haemophilia. It was also the first to describe a surgical procedure for ligating the temporal artery for migraine, also almost 600 years before Pare recorded that he had ligated his own temporal artery for headache that conforms to current descriptions of migraine. Al-Zahrawi was, therefore, the first to describe the migraine surgery procedure that is enjoying a revival in the 21st century, spearheaded by Elliot Shevel, a South African surgeon.

=== &quot;On Surgery and Instruments&quot; ===
&quot;On Surgery and Instruments&quot; is the 30th and last volume of the &quot;Kitab al-Tasrif&quot;. It was without a doubt his most important work and the one which established his authority in Europe for centuries to come.
&quot;On Surgery and Instruments&quot; is the first illustrated surgical guide ever written. Its contents and descriptions has contributed in many technological innovations in medicine, notably which tools to use in specific surgeries. In his book, al-Zahrawi draws diagrams of each tool used in different procedures to clarify how to carry out the steps of each treatment. The full text consists of three books, intended for medical students looking forward to gaining more knowledge within the field of surgery regarding procedures and the necessary tools.

The book was translated into Latin in the 12th century by Gerard of Cremona. It soon found popularity in Europe and became a standard text in all major Medical universities like those of Salerno and Montpellier. It remained the primary source on surgery in Europe for the next 500 years, and as the historian of medicine, Arturo Castiglioni, has put it: al-Zahrawi&#x27;s treatise &quot;in surgery held the same authority as did the Canon of Avicenna in medicine&quot;.

Al-Zahrawi claims that his knowledge comes from careful reading of previous medical texts as well as his own experience: “...whatever skill I have, I have derived for myself by my long reading of the books of the Ancients and my thirst to understand them until I extracted the knowledge of it from them. Then through the whole of my life I have adhered to experience and practice... I have made it accessible for you and rescued it from the abyss of prolixity&quot;.

In the beginning of his book, al-Zahrawi states that the reason for writing this treatise was the degree of underdevelopment surgery had reached in the Islamic world, and the low status it held amongst physicians at the time. Al-Zahrawi ascribed such decline to a lack of anatomical knowledge and a misunderstanding of the human physiology.

Noting the importance of anatomy he wrote: 

In urology, al-Zahrawi wrote about taking stones out of the bladder. By inventing a new instrument, an early form of the lithotrite which he called &quot;Michaab&quot;, he was able to crush the stone inside the bladder without the need for a surgical incision. His technique was important for the development of lithotomy, and an improvement over the existing techniques in Europe which caused severe pain for the patient, and came with high death rates.

In dentistry and periodontics, al-Zahrawi had the most significant contribution out of all Muslim physicians, and his book contained the earliest illustrations of dental instruments. He was known to use gold and silver wires to ligate loosened teeth, and has been credited as the first to use replantation in the history of dentistry. He also invented instruments to scale the calculus from the teeth, a procedure he recommended as a prevention from periodontal disease.

Al-Zahrawi introduced over 200 surgical instruments, which include, among others, different kinds of scalpels, retractors, curettes, pincers, specula, and also instruments designed for his favoured techniques of cauterization and ligature. He also invented hooks with a double tip for use in surgery. Many of these instruments were never used before by any previous surgeons.

His use of catgut for internal stitching is still practised in modern surgery. Catgut appears to be the only natural substance capable of dissolving and is acceptable by the body, an observation Al-Zahrawi discovered after his monkey ate the strings of his oud. Al-Zahrawi also invented the forceps for extracting a dead fetus, as illustrated in the &quot;Kitab al-Tasrif&quot;.

=== Tone ===

Throughout the text, Al-Zahrawi assumes an authoritative tone. In &quot;On cauterization for numbness&quot;, he declares the procedure &quot;should not be attempted except by one who has a good knowledge of the anatomy of the limbs and of the exits of the nerves that move the body&quot;. He warns that another procedure should not be attempted by any surgeon lacking &quot;long training and practice in the use of cautery&quot;. He is not afraid to depart from old practice, disparaging the opinions that cauterization should only be used in the spring or that gold is the best material for cauterization: &quot;cauterization is swifter and more successful with iron&quot;. In &quot;On cauterization for pleurisy&quot;, he notes that the introduction of a red-hot probe into the intercostal space to evacuate pus from an abscess could result in the creation of &quot;an incurable fistula&quot; or even the immediate death of the patient.

== Pharmacology and Cosmetics ==
In pharmacy and pharmacology, Al-Zahrawi pioneered the preparation of medicines by sublimation and distillation. He dedicated the 28th chapter of his book to pharmacy and pharmaceutical techniques. The chapter was later translated into Latin under the title of &quot;Liber Servitoris&quot;, where it served as an important source for European herbalists. The book is of particular interest, as it provides the reader with recipes and explains how to prepare the &quot;simples&quot; from which were compounded the complex drugs then generally used.

Al-Zahrawi also touched upon the subject of cosmetics and dedicated a chapter for it in his medical encyclopedia. As the treatise was translated into Latin, the cosmetic chapter was used in the West. Al-Zahrawi considered cosmetics a branch of medicine, which he called &quot;Medicine of Beauty&quot; (&quot;Adwiyat al-Zinah&quot;). He deals with perfumes, scented aromatics and incense. He also invented a perfumed sticks rolled and pressed in special molds, perhaps the earliest antecedents of present-day lipsticks and solid deodorants.

== Legacy ==
Al-Zahrawi was the &quot;most frequently cited surgical authority of the Middle Ages&quot;.
Donald Campbell, a historian of Arabic medicine, described Al-Zahrawi&#x27;s influence on Europe as follows:

The chief influence of Albucasis on the medical system of Europe was that his lucidity and method of presentation awakened a prepossession in favour of Arabic literature among the scholars of the West: the methods of Albucasis eclipsed those of Galen and maintained a dominant position in medical Europe for five hundred years, i.e long after it had passed its usefulness. He, however, helped to raise the status of surgery in Christian Europe; in his book on fractures and luxations, he states that &#x27;this part of surgery has passed into the hands of vulgar and uncultivated minds, for which reason it has fallen into contempt.&#x27; The surgery of Albucasis became firmly grafted on Europe after the time of Guy de Chauliac (d.1368).

In the 14th century, the French surgeon Guy de Chauliac quoted &quot;al-Tasrif&quot; over 200 times. Pietro Argallata (d. 1453) described Al-Zahrawi as &quot;without doubt the chief of all surgeons&quot;. Al-Zahrawi&#x27;s influence continued for at least five centuries, extending into the Renaissance, evidenced by &quot;al-Tasrif&quot;&#x27;s frequent reference by French surgeon Jacques Daléchamps (1513–1588).

The street in Córdoba where he lived is named in his honor as &quot;Calle Albucasis&quot;. On this street he lived in house no. 6, which is preserved today by the Spanish Tourist Board with a bronze plaque (awarded in January 1977) which reads: &quot;This was the house where Al-Zahrawi lived.&quot;

<doc id="353219" wikidata="Q208022" url="?curid=353219" title="Police, West Pomeranian Voivodeship">
<text>Police (; ) is a town in the West Pomeranian Voivodeship, in northwestern Poland. It is the capital of Police County and one of the biggest towns of the Szczecin agglomeration.

The town is situated on the Oder River and its estuary, south of the Szczecin Lagoon and the Bay of Pomerania. The centre of Police is situated about north of the centre of Szczecin.

==Etymology==
The name of the town comes from Proto-Slavic &quot;pole&quot;, which means .

== History ==

The settlement was first mentioned in 1243. Pomeranian duke Barnim of Pomerania granted Magdeburg law to the town in 1260. At the end of the 13th century, the town had become a fief of a local dynasty of knights, the Drake family. In 1321, with the death of Otto Drake, the town became a dependency of nearby Stettin (now Szczecin), hindering its growth until the mid-18th century.

Nearby Jasienica Abbey, now within the Police city limits, was secularized during the Protestant Reformation, which was adapted in the Duchy of Pomerania in 1534. After its secularization, the abbey became a ducal domain, and was the site of the treaty that for the first time partitioned the duchy into a western and eastern part (Pomerania-Wolgast and Pomerania-Stettin) in 1569.

From the Treaty of Stettin (1630) until the Treaty of Stockholm (1720), Pölitz was part of Swedish Pomerania, and of Prussian Pomerania thereafter. In 1808, Pölitz became independent from Stettin again. In 1815, Pölitz became part of the restructured Province of Pomerania, administered within Landkreis Randow county. In 1939, this county was dissolved and Pölitz was made part of Groß-Stettin.

=== German synthetic fuel factory===
In 1937, the synthetic fuel plant &quot;Hydrierwerke Pölitz AG&quot; was founded by IG Farben, Rhenania-Ossag, and Deutsch-Amerikanische Petroleum Gesellschaft which by 1943 was producing 15% of Nazi Germany&#x27;s synthetic fuels, 577,000 tons. The plant derived its workforce from an adjacent system of camps (Pommernlager, Nordlager, Tobruklager, Wullenwever-Lager, Arbeitserziehungslager Hägerwelle, Dürrfeld Lager) plus a ship moored on the Oder River serving as a camp (Umschulungslager Bremerhaven). In addition, a subcamp of the Stutthof concentration camp was located in Pölitz.

During World War II, the plant made Pölitz a nine-time bombing target of the Allied Oil Campaign from late April 1943 onward, leading to 70% of the town being destroyed.

===Post–World War II===

The city with the plant was captured by the Soviet Union&#x27;s Red Army during the Battle of Berlin on 26 April 1945. While most of the former German territory east of the Oder-Neisse line became Polish, Pölitz, situated on the western bank of the Oder, remained a Soviet-administered exclave: Marshal Zhukov decreed the establishment of a Soviet county with Pölitz, Ziegenort, Jasenitz, Messenthin and Scholwin. 25,000 German workers had to disassemble the plant before it was sent to the USSR.

Gradually, the area without the plant was given to Poland: Mścięcino on 7 September 1946, and Police with Jasienica on 19 September. On 25 February 1947 the plant also passed to Polish control. As a result, the Soviet Union allowed Polish annexations of German land west of the river Odra, beyond the border as agreed on the Potsdam Conference.

Polish settlers, partially expellees from the east of former Poland, arrived in the region to replace the German population that had fled or were forcibly expelled. They were joined by refugees from Greece and Yugoslav Macedonia in 1953.

The ruins of the plant still remain standing, though they are not secured and are dangerous to visit.

A large chemical plant (&quot;Zakłady Chemiczne &quot;Police&quot;&quot;) was built in the town in 1969 and has grown since to become one of the largest in Poland. It produces mostly titanium dioxide pigments and nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers.

Police was in the Szczecin Voivodeship from 1946 to 1998. Since 1999 the town has been part of the West Pomeranian Voivodeship.

<text>Pyrzyce (; ) is a town in Pomerania, north-western Poland. As of 2007, it had 13,331 inhabitants. It is the capital of the Pyrzyce County in West Pomeranian Voivodeship.

==History==

An anonymous medieval document of about 850, called Bavarian Geographer, mentions the tribe of Prissani having 70 strongholds (&quot;Prissani civitates LXX&quot;). The territory became part of the emerging Polish state under Mieszko I around 967.

The settlement was first mentioned in 1124 by bishop Otto von Bamberg, who baptized the first Pomeranians here, a task entrusted to him by Polish monarch Bolesław III Wrymouth. It was one of the first towns of Western Pomerania to convert to Christianity. In 1140, a church was founded, and a castle was first mentioned. Later on, as a result of the fragmentation of Poland, it was part of the Duchy of Pomerania. In 1248, a ducal mint of Barnim I was mentioned for the first time. A new church was built in 1250, an Augustinian cloister in 1256 and a monastery of the Franciscan order in 1281.

In 1263 the town received Magdeburg town rights from Duke Barnim I. In 1320 Dukes Otto I and Barnim III exempted the burghers from customs duties throughout their duchy, in 1322 they granted the town the village of Czarnowo, and in 1326 they confirmed the old right to mint coins. By the &quot;Contract of Pyritz&quot; of March 26, 1493 the Dukes of Pomerania recognized the right of succession of the House of Brandenburg. A large fire destroyed almost the whole town in 1496. Pyritz was the first town in Pomerania to implement the Lutheran Reformation in 1524.

During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the town was occupied by the Holy Roman Empire since 1628, then by Sweden from 1630, by the Holy Roman Empire again in 1635, and by Sweden again in 1636. It was plundered repeatedly both by Imperial and Swedish troops, and in 1634, it was largely destroyed by a conflagration. After the death of the last Pomeranian Duke in 1637, the Swedes took over the town. In 1653 the town became part of the Brandenburg-Prussian province of Pomerania following the Peace of Westphalia (1648) and the Treaty of Stettin (1653), along within the rest of Farther Pomerania.

In 1818, the town became the seat of the district administration (Kreis Pyritz) and was connected to the railway system in 1882. As part of Prussia the town was located in unified Germany of 1871.

At the end of World War II the Soviet Red Army conquered the town during the Pomeranian Offensive. Bombardment of Pyritz by Soviet artillery began on February 1, 1945, and achieved maximum intensity on February 27, when attacks by heavy artillery destroyed the old town. Following the post-war boundary changes, Pyrzyce became again part of Poland; the local population was expelled in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement and replaced by Poles, including those displaced from former eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union.

From 1975 to 1998 Pyrzyce was administratively located in the Szczecin Voivodeship.

Since 1994 the town of Pyrzyce is home for the second oldest Geothermal Plant in Poland. The power plant is generating clean geothermal energy thanks to use of Lower Jurassic reservoirs of thermal waters (61 degree Celsius) at approx. 1600 m b.s.l.

<text>Gryfino () is a town in Pomerania, northwestern Poland, with 21,393 inhabitants (2017). It is also the capital of Gryfino County in West Pomeranian Voivodeship.

The town is located on the Odra Wschodnia, the eastern branch of the Oder river, about south of Szczecin in Poland. The western branch of the Oder, away from the town center, marks the border with Germany. There is a direct road link between Gryfino and the German town of Mescherin across the river.

The Crooked Forest is located in the village of Nowe Czarnowo, just outside Gryfino.

==History==

The territory became part of the emerging Polish state under Mieszko I around 967. Following the fragmentation of Poland into smaller duchies it formed part of the Duchy of Pomerania. There are archaeological traces of Slavic settlement dating back to the 12th century. The settlement was built in 1230, and was raised to the rank of a town by Duke Barnim I in 1254. In 1271 Barnim I granted guild privileges modelled after Szczecin. In 1281 the town was exempted from customs duties and declared a free port. In 1284 it obtained a permission to build defensive walls and was one of the Pomeranian towns that guaranteed a peace treaty between the Duchy of Pomerania and the Margraviate of Brandenburg. The town was in conflict with the town of Gartz across the Oder (current twin town), which was resolved in 1304. In 1306 Duke Otto I allowed the town to build a bridge and a dam over the Oder and collect customs duties on it like Szczecin.

In the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the town was hit by epidemics in 1625 and 1638, and was occupied by the Holy Roman Empire in 1627–1630 and by Sweden in 1630–1640. After the war, it remained in Swedish possession. In 1675 it was captured by the Brandenburgers, into whose possession it came finally in 1679. In 1709 Polish King Stanisław Leszczyński stopped in the town. In 1723, French Huguenots settled in the town. During the Seven Years&#x27; War, the town was plundered by the Russians. From 1871 it formed part of the German Empire.

Two labour camps of the Reich Labour Service were located in the town under Nazi Germany. In the final months of World War II, in March 1945, it was captured by Allied Polish and Russian forces. Afterwards, the region became again part of Poland, although with a Soviet-installed communist regime, which stayed in power until the Fall of Communism in the 1980s. Despite the existence of the old Polish name &quot;Gryfów&quot;, the town was first renamed to &quot;Gryfin&quot;, and in 1946 to &quot;Gryfino&quot; by replacing the German suffix -hagen by the Polish suffix -ino.

After the war, the town&#x27;s life was reestablished, in 1945 the first schools began teaching, in 1946 the Gryf cinema was opened, and in 1947 the municipal library was opened. A new hospital and culture center were opened in 1955 and 1958, respectively. From 1975 to 1998 Gryfino was administratively located in the Szczecin Voivodeship. Underground anti-communist press was published in Gryfino from 1982 to 1984. In 2021, a mural to Polish resistance hero Witold Pilecki was unveiled in Gryfino.

In 1974 the first unit of Dolna Odra Power Station, a large coal-fired power station, went in service.

<text>Goleniów (; ) is a town in Pomerania, northwestern Poland with 22,844 inhabitants as of 2011. It is the capital of Goleniów County in West Pomeranian Voivodeship. The town&#x27;s area is , and its geographical position is 53°33&#x27;N, 14°49&#x27;E. It is situated in the centre of Goleniowska Forest on Goleniów Plain, near main roads numbers 3 and 6.

The international airport Szczecin-Goleniów &quot;Solidarność&quot; Airport is located just east of the town.

== History ==
The settlement dates back to the 10th century. Pomerania became part of the emerging Polish state under its first ruler Mieszko I around 967. As a result of the 12th-century fragmentation of Poland it became part of the separate Duchy of Pomerania, ruled by the House of Griffin. Barnim I, Duke of Pomerania granted the settlement Magdeburg town rights and additional privileges in 1264, yet Goleniów was rechartered with Lübeck Law, which favoured the local merchants, in 1314. The town grew by exploiting the vast timber reserves in the town-owned forests, and by trade. The town was connected to the Baltic Sea trade routes by the port of Ihnamünde (Inoujście) at the mouth of the Ina river. Competition with nearby Stettin (Szczecin) led to a series of conflicts between the two towns, the differences were set aside only in 1615 when the towns signed a reconciling treaty. The town remained part of the Duchy of Pomerania until Sweden took over in 1630.

The Thirty Years&#x27; War devastated the town, and as a consequence of the post-war Peace of Westphalia (1648) and Treaty of Stettin (1653), the town remained with Sweden who had occupied the area since the Treaty of Stettin (1630). The border with Brandenburg-Prussian Pomerania now ran close to the town, and cut Gollnow off from its economic hinterland, which hindered recovery from the war. Between 1677 and 1683, Gollnow was occupied by Brandenburg-Prussia. In the years that followed, the number of craftsmen in the town grew steadily. In 1720, Sweden lost its possessions south of the Peene and east of the Peenestrom rivers, including Gollnow, to Prussia in the Treaty of Stockholm. In the 19th century, craft and trade were joined by industry – Gollnow hosted a coppersmith, a needle fabrication, several facilities for the manufacturing of furniture, three breweries, a distillery, and five water mills. In the late 19th and early 20th century, the town became an important railroad junction, when it was connected to Neudamm (&quot;Dębno&quot;) and Naugard (&quot;Nowogard&quot;) in 1882, to Cammin (&quot;Kamień Pomorski&quot;) and Wollin (&quot;Wolin&quot;) in 1892, and to Massow in 1903. Gollnow was part of the Prussian province of Pomerania from 1815 to 1945. With the unification of Germany in 1871, it became part of the German Reich. In 1919, the Germans operated a camp in the town, in which they imprisoned Poles arrested in Szubin during the Greater Poland uprising.

During World War II, the Nazis operated a prison in the town, with multiple forced labour subcamps located in the region. Polish forced labourers were imprisoned in the town. On 7 March 1945, the town was captured by the Red Army. After Nazi Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War II, the area became once again part of Poland, although with a Soviet-installed communist regime, which stayed in power until the Fall of Communism in the 1980s. The town&#x27;s German population was expelled in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement.

In 1954, town limits were expanded by including Helenów as Goleniów&#x27;s new district. From 1975 to 1998, it was administratively located in the Szczecin Voivodeship.

<text>Gryfice ( ; Kashubian: &quot;Grëfice&quot;; ) is a historic town in Pomerania, north-western Poland, with 16,600 inhabitants (2017). It is the capital of Gryfice County in West Pomeranian Voivodeship (since 1999), previously in Szczecin Voivodeship (1975–1998). The town is situated approximately 22 kilometres from the Baltic Sea coast and seaside resorts.

==History==
===Middle Ages===

The region was part of Poland during the reign of the first Polish ruler Mieszko I and during the early part of the reign of his successor, Bolesław I the Brave. It broke away along with most of Pomerania in the pagan revolt that occurred around 1005, but was reconquered by the Polish king in the early 1100s. The Battle of Niekładź took place in the area of Gryfice in 1121, in which Polish ruler Bolesław III Wrymouth defeated Wartislaw I, Duke of Pomerania and Swantopolk I, Duke of Pomerania. The area was part of the Duchy of Pomerania, a vassal state of Poland, which later on separated itself from Poland as a result of the fragmentation of Poland.

In 1262 Wartislaw III, Duke of Pomerania founded a town under Lübeck law on the Rega river to attract German settlers. After his death, his successor, Barnim I, Duke of Pomerania, named the settlement &quot;Civitat Griphemberch super Regam&quot; (Middle High German &#x27;Griphemberch&#x27; meaning Griffin&#x27;s mountain) after the coat of arms symbol of the Dukes of Pomerania. In 1365 the town entered the Hanseatic League and prospered due to the right of free navigation on the Rega, despite the 350-year conflict over rafting on the Rega river.

A town wall was built and at the end of the 13th century the construction of the St. Mary&#x27;s church was begun. In a document of 1386 a Latin school is mentioned, which is generally called the oldest in Pomerania.

===Modern era===
In the 16th century, the local Germans pursued a policy of Germanisation towards the indigenous population, which, however, did not bring results quickly. At that time, some of the indigenous peasants fled to Poland, while Scottish immigrants settled in the town. As a result of the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the population of the town decreased dramatically. The town was occupied by the Imperial and Swedish armies. After the death of the last Pomeranian Duke and by the Treaty of Westphalia Greifenberg became part of Brandenburg-Prussia in 1648 and part of Imperial Germany in 1871. In 1818 the town became the capital of the Greifenberg district (Kreis Greifenberg).

In 1894 the town was connected to the railway line Dąbie (Altdamm) - Kołobrzeg (Kolberg). On 1 July 1896 the Greifenberger Kleinbahn was opened, a narrow-gauge railway today used as a railway Museum. In 1933 a Polish association of agricultural workers was established in Gryfice. Local Poles and Jews were subjected to increased repressions, after the Nazis came to power in Germany in 1933. After the German invasion of Poland, forced labourers from Poland were brought to the town.

At the end of World War II, on 5 March 1945, the Soviet Red Army conquered the town, and on March 8, Poles entered the town. Approximately 40 per cent of the town was destroyed, however many historical monuments stayed intact or were reconstructed. Following the post-war boundary changes, the town became part of Poland. Initially called &quot;Zagórze&quot;, it was eventually given the Polish name &quot;Gryfice&quot;. The Germans who did not escape during the battle with the Soviets, were expelled and the town was populated with Poles, some of them expellees themselves from Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union. The post-war administration of Gryfice was created with the participation of the just-freed Polish forced labourers.

After the war, the life of the town was being rebuilt. In 1945, the first post-war schools, a hospital and a cinema were opened and the following year a mill, a gasworks and a marmalade factory were opened. In 1948 a sugar factory was established, which already in 1951 was one of the leading sugar factories in Poland.


==Demographics==
Between its foundation and 1945, Greifenberg was predominantly inhabited by German-speaking people. By the 18th century, almost all inhabitants where Lutheran Protestants, with small Jewish and Catholic minorities. With the expropriation and expulsion of the German inhabitants at the end of World War II and the occupation of the vacated buildings by Polish settlers, the majority of its population has been composed of Roman Catholics.

<doc id="353224" wikidata="Q207736" url="?curid=353224" title="St Andrews">
<text>St Andrews (; ; , pronounced [kʰʲɪʎˈrˠiː.ɪɲ]) is a town on the east coast of Fife in Scotland, southeast of Dundee and northeast of Edinburgh. St Andrews had a recorded population of 16,800 , making it Fife&#x27;s fourth-largest settlement and 45th most populous settlement in Scotland.

The town is home to the University of St Andrews, the third oldest university in the English-speaking world and the oldest in Scotland. It was ranked as the best university in the UK by the 2022 Good University Guide, which is published by &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. According to other rankings, it is ranked as one of the best universities in the United Kingdom.

The town is named after Saint Andrew the Apostle. The settlement grew to the west of St Andrews Cathedral, with the southern side of the Scores to the north and the Kinness Burn to the south. The burgh soon became the ecclesiastical capital of Scotland, a position which was held until the Scottish Reformation. The famous cathedral, the largest in Scotland, now lies in ruins.

St Andrews is also known globally as the &quot;home of golf&quot;. This is in part because of The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews, founded in 1754, which until 2004 exercised legislative authority over the game worldwide (except in the United States and Mexico). It is also because the famous Old Course of St Andrews Links (acquired by the town in 1894) is the most frequent venue for The Open Championship, the oldest of golf&#x27;s four major championships. Visitors travel to St Andrews in great numbers for several courses ranked amongst the finest in the world, as well as for the sandy beaches.

The Martyrs Memorial, erected to the honour of Patrick Hamilton, George Wishart, and other martyrs of the Reformation epoch, stands at the west end of the Scores on a cliff overlooking the sea. The civil parish has a population of 18,421 (in 2011).

The town also contains numerous museums, a botanic garden and an aquarium.

== Name and etymology ==
The earliest recorded name of the area is &quot;Cennrígmonaid&quot;. This is Old Gaelic and composed of the elements (head, peninsula), (king) and (moor). This became &quot;Cell Rígmonaid&quot; (&quot;cell&quot; meaning church) and was Scoticised to &quot;Kilrymont&quot;. The modern Gaelic spelling is &quot;Cill Rìmhinn&quot;. It is likely that the Gaelic name represents an adaptation of a Pictish form &quot;*Penrimond&quot;. The name &quot;St Andrews&quot; derives from the town&#x27;s claim to be the resting place of bones of the apostle Andrew. According to legend, St Regulus (or Rule) brought the relics to Kilrymont, where a shrine was established for their safekeeping and veneration while Kilrymont was renamed in honour of the saint. This is the origin of a third name for the town &quot;Kilrule&quot;.

Its name may also be notable for the lack of apostrophe; this is due to the fact that the name of the town predates the introduction of the apostrophe into the English language from French in the 16th century.

== History ==

The first inhabitants who settled on the estuary fringes of the rivers Tay and Eden during the mesolithic (middle Stone Age) came from the plains in Northern Europe between 10,000 and 5,000 BCE. This was followed by the nomadic people who settled around the modern town around 4,500 BCE as farmers clearing the area of woodland and building monuments.

During the Iron Age/Early Middle ages, a fortified enclosure, potentially a hillfort, was established on East Balrymonth hill, a mile to the south of the town. Today, the outline of the defences are visible on some aerial images. It marks the oldest still extant structure in St Andrews.

In the mid-eighth century a monastery was established by the Pictish king Oengus I, traditionally associated with the relics of Saint Andrew, a number of bones supposed to be the saint&#x27;s arm, kneecap, three fingers and a tooth believed to have been brought to the town by St Regulus. In AD 877, king Causantín mac Cináeda (Constantine I) built a new church for the Culdees at St Andrews and later the same year was captured and executed (or perhaps killed in battle) after defending against Viking raiders.

In AD 906, the town became the seat of the bishop of Alba, with the boundaries of the see being extended to include land between the River Forth and River Tweed. In 943 Constantine II abdicated and took the position of abbot of the monastery of St Andrews.

The establishment of the present town began around 1140 by Bishop Robert on an L-shaped hill, possibly on the site of the ruined St Andrews Castle. According to a charter of 1170, the new burgh was built to the west of the Cathedral precinct, along Castle Street and possibly as far as what is now known as North Street. This means that the lay-out may have led to the creation of two new streets (North Street and South Street) from the foundations of the new St Andrews Cathedral filling the area inside a two-sided triangle at its apex. The northern boundary of the burgh was the southern side of the Scores (the street between North Street and the sea) with the southern by the Kinness Burn and the western by the West Port. The burgh of St Andrews was first represented at the great council at Scone Palace in 1357.

St Andrews, in particular the large cathedral built in 1160, was the most important centre of pilgrimage in medieval Scotland and one of the most important in Europe. Pilgrims from all over Scotland came in large numbers hoping to be blessed, and in many cases to be cured, at the shrine of Saint Andrew. The presence of the pilgrims brought about increased trade and development. Recognised as the ecclesiastical capital of Scotland, the town now had vast economic and political influence within Europe as a cosmopolitan town. The Scottish Parliament met in the town in 1304, when King Edward I, in his capacity as overlord of Scotland, came to be received by Bishop William de Lamberton. As many as 130 landowners turned up to witness the event ranging from Sir John of Cambo to Sir William Murray of Fort.

In 1559, the town fell into decay after the violent Scottish Reformation and the Wars of the Three Kingdoms losing the status of ecclesiastical capital of Scotland. Even the University of St Andrews was considering relocating to Perth around 1697 and 1698. Under the authorisation of the bishop of St Andrews, the town was made a burgh of barony in 1614. Royal Burgh was then granted as a charter by King James VI in 1620. In the 18th century, the town was still in decline, but despite this the town was becoming known for having links &#x27;well known to golfers&#x27;. By the 19th century, the town began to expand beyond the original medieval boundaries with streets of new houses and town villas being built. Today, St Andrews is served by education, golf and the tourist and conference industry.

In 1951, &quot;The Masque of St. Andrews&quot;, which dramatised important events in the town&#x27;s history, was staged in the Cathedral grounds as part of the Festival of Britain.

== Governance ==

===Local government===
St Andrews is represented by several tiers of elected government. Prior to 1975 the town was governed by a burgh council, a provost and baillies. From 1975, St Andrews was administered by North East Fife District Council and Fife Regional Council. North East Fife District was abolished in 1996 when Fife Council became the unitary authority. Fife Council, based in Glenrothes, is now the executive, deliberative and legislative body responsible for local governance. The Scottish Parliament is responsible for devolved matters such as education, health and justice while reserved matters are dealt with by the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

The Royal Burgh of St Andrews Community Council, meeting on the first Monday of the month in the Council Chamber of St Andrews Town Hall, forms the lowest tier of governance whose statutory role is to communicate local opinion to local and central government. The current chair is Mrs Penelope Fraser. The chair uses the honorary title of Provost of St Andrews on official and ceremonial occasions, this ancient title having been revived to mark the 400th Anniversary of the granting of Royal Burgh status to St Andrews in 1620 by King James VI &amp; I.

===UK Parliament===
In the early days of the United Kingdom, following implementation of the union of 1707, St Andrews elected one Member of Parliament (MP) to the United Kingdom Parliament. Following the implementation of the Reform Act 1832 St Andrews Burgh merged with Anstruther for the purposes of electing one MP to the United Kingdom Parliament. Following implementation of the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885, there was one MP sitting for St Andrews Burgh (which would include Anstruther Easter, Anstruther Wester, Crail, Cupar, Kilrenny and Pittenweem).

St Andrews now forms part of the North East Fife constituency, electing one Member of Parliament (MP) to the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom by the first past the post system. The constituency is represented by Wendy Chamberlain, MP of the Scottish Liberal Democrats. For the purposes of the Scottish Parliament, St Andrews forms part of the North East Fife constituency. The North East Fife Scottish Parliament (or &quot;Holyrood&quot;) constituency created in 1999 is one of nine within the Mid Scotland and Fife electoral region. Each constituency elects one Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) by the first past the post system of election, and the region elects seven additional members to produce a form of proportional representation. The seat was won at the 2016 Scottish Parliament Election by Willie Rennie, for the Scottish Liberal Democrats.

== Demography ==
According to the 2001 census, St Andrews had a total population of 14,209. The population increased to around 16,680 in 2008 and 16,800 in 2012 The demographic make-up of the population is much in line with the rest of Scotland. The age group from 16 to 29 forms the largest portion of the population (37%). The median age of males and females living in St Andrews was 29 and 34 years respectively, compared to 37 and 39 years for those in the whole of Scotland.

The place of birth of the town&#x27;s residents was 87.78% United Kingdom (including 61.80% from Scotland), 0.63% Republic of Ireland, 4.18% from other European Union countries, and 7.42% from elsewhere in the world. The economic activity of residents aged 16–74 was 23.94% in full-time employment, 8.52% in part-time employment, 4.73% self-employed, 1.94% unemployed, 31.14% students with jobs, 9.08% students without jobs, 13.24% retired, 2.91% looking after home or family, 2.84% permanently sick or disabled, and 1.67% economically inactive for other reasons.

St Andrews is often considered as an expensive destination. In 2016, St Andrews was reported to be home to the &quot;Most Expensive Street in Scotland&quot;, with average house prices in The Scores in excess of 2 million pounds.

== Weather and climate ==

St Andrews has a temperate maritime climate, which is relatively mild despite its northerly latitude. Winters are not as cold as one might expect, considering that Moscow and Labrador lie on the same latitude. Daytime temperatures can fall below freezing and average around . However, the town is subject to strong winds. Night-time frosts are common; however, snowfall is more rare.
The nearest official Met Office weather station for which data are available is at Leuchars, about northwest of St Andrews town centre.

Rainfall, at little more than 650 mm per year makes St Andrews one of the driest parts of Scotland, shielded from Atlantic weather systems by several mountain ranges. Over 1 mm of rain is recorded on just under 117 days of the year.

Sunshine, averaging in excess of 1,500 hours a year is amongst the highest for Scotland, and comparable to inland parts of Southern England. St Andrews is about the furthest north annual levels of above 1500 hours are encountered.

All averages refer to the 1971–2000 observation period.

== Transport ==
The St Andrews Railway provided a connection to the main Edinburgh to Aberdeen Line at Leuchars railway station. This service was ended in 1969. The St Andrews Rail Link project aims at realising a new high-speed twin-cord mainline rail link via Cupar to the south and west and via Leuchars to the north.

Nowadays, the only public transport to reach trains at Leuchars or to connect other towns in Fife is the Stagecoach bus station located near the town centre. Stagecoach&#x27;s Route 99 (and its alternate routes 99A, 99B, 99C, 99D) connects St Andrews to Dundee via Leuchars with buses up to every ten minutes. Moffat &amp; Williamson operates Route 92 (and 92A, 92B, 92C) on a lesser frequency from Balmullo via Leuchars station to St Andrews before looping the town. There are also some local bus service that links the town centre to St Andrews Community Hospital in the south.

St Andrews Bus Station provides frequent bus services to most towns in Fife and the nearby city of Dundee via Leuchars, and less frequent services to further destinations like Edinburgh and Stirling. Travellers from Edinburgh Airport may take Route 747 to Halbeath Park &amp; Ride then take X59/X24 to St Andrews. Otherwise, they have to travel to central Edinburgh for train or bus services.

Dundee Airport, about 15 miles north of the town, has flights that connect with London-City and Belfast-City provided by Loganair.

Roads A91, A915, A917, A918 and B939 traverse the town at different locations.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC Scotland and STV North. Television signals are received from either the Angus or Durris TV transmitters.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Scotland, Kingdom FM, Forth 1, Greatest Hits Radio Edinburgh, Lothians, Fife and Falkirk, and St Andrews Radio, a community based station which broadcast from the University of St Andrews.

The St Andrews Citizen is the town&#x27;s local newspaper including student newspapers which are published from the University of St Andrews, The Saint and The Stand.

== Landmarks ==

St Andrews was once bounded by several &quot;ports&quot; (the Lowland Scots word for a town gate). Two are still extant: So&#x27;gait port (South Street, now called West Port) and the Sea Yett (as The Pends terminates to the harbour). The West Port is one of few surviving town &quot;Ports&quot; in Scotland and is a scheduled monument. The towers were influenced by those seen at the base of the Netherbow Port in Edinburgh. The central archway which displays semi-octagonal &quot;rownds&quot; and &quot;battling&quot; is supported by corbelling and neatly moulded passageways. Side arches and relief panels were added to the port, during the reconstruction between 1843 and 1845.

 The Category A listed Holy Trinity (also known as the Holy Trinity Parish Church or &quot;town kirk&quot;) is the most historic church in St Andrews. The church was initially built on land, close to the south-east gable of the cathedral, around 1144, and was dedicated in 1234 by Bishop David de Bernham. It then moved to a new site on the north side of South Street between 1410 and 1412 by bishop Warlock. Much of the architecture feature of the church was lost in the re-building by Robert Balfour between 1798 and 1800. The church was later restored to a (more elaborately decorated) approximation of its medieval appearance between 1907 and 1909 by MacGregor Chambers.

 To the east of the town centre, lie the ruins of St Andrews Cathedral. This was at one time Scotland&#x27;s largest building, originated in the priory of Canons Regular founded by Bishop Robert Kennedy. St Rule&#x27;s Church, to the south-east of the medieval cathedral is said to date from around 1120 and 1150, being the predecessor of the cathedral. The tall square tower, part of the church, was built to hold the relics of St Andrew and became known as the first cathedral in the town. After the death of Bishop Robert Kennedy, a new cathedral was begun in 1160 by Bishop Arnold (his successor) on a site adjacent to St Rule&#x27;s Church. Work on the cathedral was finally completed and consecrated in 1318 by Bishop William de Lamberton with Robert the Bruce (1306–29) present at the ceremony. The cathedral and associated buildings, including St Rule&#x27;s Church, are protected as a scheduled monument.
The ruins of St Andrews Castle are situated on a cliff-top to the north of the town. The castle was first erected around 1200 as the residence, prison and fortress of the bishops of the diocese. Several reconstructions occurred in subsequent centuries, most notably due to damage incurred in the Wars of Scottish Independence.

The castle was occupied, besieged and stormed during The Rough Wooing and was severely damaged in the process.

The majority of the castle seen today dates to between 1549 and 1571. The work was commissioned by John Hamilton (archbishop of St Andrews) in a renaissance style which made the building a comfortable, palatial residence while still remaining well-fortified.
After the Reformation, the castle passed to several owners, who could not maintain its structure and the building deteriorated into a ruin.
The castle is now a scheduled monument administered by Historic Environment Scotland.

The apse of the Dominican friary, Blackfriars, can still be seen on South Street (between Madras College and Bell Street). Other defunct religious houses that existed in the medieval town, though less visible, have left traces, as for instance the leper hospital at St Nicholas farmhouse (The Steading) between Albany Park and the East Sands leisure centre.

== Education ==

Today, St Andrews is home to one secondary school, one private school and three primary schools.
Canongate Primary School, which opened in 1972 is located off the Canongate, beside the St Andrews Botanic Garden. The school roll was recorded in February 2008 as 215. Lawhead Primary School, which opened in 1974 is on the western edge of the town. The school roll was recorded in September 2009 as 181. Greyfriars Primary School is a Roman Catholic school located in the southern part of the town.

Madras College is the sole secondary school in the town. The school which opened to pupils in 1833 was based on a Madras system – founded and endowed by Andrew Bell (1755–1832), a native of the town. Prior to the opening, Bell was interested in the demand for a school which was able to teach both poor and privileged children on one site. The high reputation of the school meant that many children came from throughout Britain to be taught there, often lodging with masters or residents in the town. The school was located on two campuses – Kilrymont, (which opened in 1967) and South Street (incorporating the original 1833 building). Pupils in S1-S3 are served by Kilrymont and S4-S6 by South Street.

Plans to build a replacement for Madras College on a single site have been ongoing since 2006. Originally, the school was in negotiations with the University of St Andrews for a joint new build at Lang Lands on land owned by the university. The plans, which were scrapped in August 2011, would have seen the school share the university&#x27;s playing fields. In October 2011, a scoring exercise drawn up by the council to decide the best location for the new Madras College was put before parents, staff and the local community to ask for their views. A £40-million redevelopment of the Kilrymont building proved to be most popular and was officially given the go-ahead in November 2011. This decision was met with controversy from parents, staff and the local community. Following a decision from a group of senior councillors to analyse the other potential sites than push ahead with the controversial redevelopment, The new Building was finished in 2021. In August 2020, it was reported that the college will sell its Kilrymont site and built a replacement school at Langlands.

The private school known as St Leonards School was initially established as the St Andrews School for girls company in 1877. The present name was taken in 1882 when a move to St Leonards House was made. The school is now spread across thirty acres between Pends Road and Kinnesburn. A private school for boys was also set up in 1933 as New Park. The operations of the school merged with the middle and junior sections of St Leonards to become St Leonards-New Park in 2005.

The University of St Andrews, which is the third oldest English-speaking university and the oldest university in Scotland, was founded between 1410 and 1413. A charter for the university was issued by Bishop Henry Wardlaw between 1411 and 1412 and this was followed by Avignon Pope Benedict XIII granting university status to award degrees to students in 1413. The school initially started out as a society for learned men in the fields of canon law, the arts and divinity. The chapel and college of St John the Evangelist became the first building to have ties with the university in 1415. The two original colleges to be associated with the university were St Salvator in 1450 by Bishop James Kennedy and St Leonard in 1512 by archbishop Alexander Stewart and prior James Hepburn.

== Sport and recreation ==
=== Golf ===
St Andrews is known widely as the &quot;home of golf&quot;. According to the earliest surviving document from 1552, the &quot;playing at golf&quot; on the links adjacent to the &quot;water of eden&quot; was granted permission by Archbishop Hamilton. The most famous golf course in the town is the Old Course, purchased by the town council in 1894. The course which dates back to medieval times, is an Open Championship course – which was first staged in 1873 and will host the 2022 Open Championship. Famous winners at St Andrews have included: Old Tom Morris (1861, 1862, 1867 and 1874), Bobby Jones (1927 and 1930 British Amateur), Jack Nicklaus (1970 and 1978) and Tiger Woods (2000 and 2005). According to Jack Nicklaus, &quot;if a golfer is going to be remembered, he must win at St Andrews&quot;. There are seven golf courses in total – Old, New, Jubilee, Eden, Strathtyrum, Balgove and the Castle –
surrounding the western approaches of the town. The seventh golf course (the Castle) was added in 2007 at Kinkell Braes, designed by David McLay Kidd.

Other leisure facilities in the town include a canoe club, a senior football club (St Andrews United), a rugby club (known as Madras Rugby Club), tennis club, university sports centre, and a links golf driving range. The East Sands Leisure Centre, which opened in 1988, sits on the outskirts of the town as the town&#x27;s swimming pool with gym facilities.

=== West Sands Beach ===
West Sands Beach in St Andrews, Scotland, served as the set for the opening scene in the movie &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;. This scene was reenacted during the 2012 Olympics torch relay. The beach was also featured in the 2012 Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony

The beach is adjacent to the famous St Andrews Links golf course. Sand dunes on the beach, which have long protected the golf course, are themselves in danger of eroding away, and are the subject of a restoration project.

== Places of interest ==
=== Byre Theatre ===

The Byre Theatre was founded in 1933 by Charles Marford, an actor (found in the Who&#x27;s Who of 1921) and Alexander B. Paterson, a local journalist and playwright, with help from a theatre group made up from members of Hope Park Church, St Andrews. The third and current building was opened in 2001 by Sir Sean Connery. Its main auditorium is named after A.B. Paterson. There is also a second 60-seat performance space named after the late golf photographer, Lawrence Levy. The theatre is said to be haunted by the benevolent ghost of Charles Marford, one of its founders.

=== Lade Braes Walk ===
The Lade Braes Walk is a scenic public footpath of about that follows the route of a medieval mill lade through St Andrews. The walk starts in the town centre near Madras College and runs roughly westward, through Cockshaugh Park to Law Mill. The lade&#x27;s function was to transport water from a higher upstream point on the Kinness Burn to the water mill in the grounds of St Andrews Cathedral Priory where it arrived at an elevated level simply by following the contours of the land. It may have been built before 1144. In the late 19th century, the lade was covered over and the area from Cockshaugh Park to Law Mill was landscaped and planted with trees. The remains of Law Mill, its grain drying kiln and water wheel are a category C listed building. A Brae is an old Scots word for the high ground adjoining a river bank.

<text>Stargard (; &quot;Starogród&quot;, &quot;Stargard Szczeciński&quot;; or &quot;Stargard an der Ihna&quot;; ) is a city in northwestern Poland, located in the West Pomeranian Voivodeship. In 2021 it was inhabited by 67,293 people. It is situated on the Ina River. The city is the seat of the Stargard County, and, extraterritorially, of the municipality of Stargard. It is the second biggest city of Szczecin agglomeration. Stargard is a major railroad junction, where the southwards connection from Szczecin splits into two directions: towards Poznań and Gdańsk.

== Etymology ==
The city&#x27;s name is of Pomeranian (Kashubian) origin and stands for &quot;old&quot; (&quot;stari&quot;) &quot;town/city&quot; (&quot;gard&quot; or &quot;gôrd&quot;).

In this meaning, the term &quot;gard&quot; is still being used by the only surviving Pomeranian language speakers, the Kashubs. However, some experts say that the name is of proto-Norse origin: &quot;starn&quot; (star) and &quot;gate&quot; (as in English).

==History==
===Middle Ages===

The settlement was founded in the 8th century at the site of the present-day district of Osetno near downtown Stargard. In 967 it became part of the emerging Polish state under the first Polish rulers from the Piast dynasty. Stargard was first mentioned in 1124, when it was part of Poland under Bolesław III Wrymouth. A church was founded in 1140. Stargard received Magdeburg city rights in 1243 from Barnim I, Duke of Pomerania.

It was one of the most important towns and a major trade centre of the Duchy of Pomerania, after it split off from Poland as a result of the 12th-century fragmentation of Poland. From 1283, the city had a port at the mouth of the Ina River in the nowadays abandoned village of Inoujście. Defensive city walls were built in the 13th century and expanded in the 14th, 15th and early 16th centuries. In 1363 the city joined the Hanseatic League.

As a result of the ongoing fragmentation of Pomerania, in 1368 Stargard became part of the Duchy of Słupsk (Pomerania-Stolp) and in 1377 it became the capital of a separate eponymous duchy, which in 1403 fell back to Duchy of Słupsk, a vassal state of the Kingdom of Poland. In 1478 Stargard became part of the reunified Duchy of Pomerania.

In the meantime, the trade rivalry with the nearby city of Szczecin led to the outbreak of the Stargard-Szczecin war in 1454, which ended in 1464. In 1477 Stargard helped Duke Wartislaw X recapture the town of Gartz during a Brandenburgian invasion.

===Modern period===
Stargard was part of the Duchy of Pomerania until its dissolution after the death of the last duke Bogislaw XIV in 1637. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War the city was captured by Sweden in 1630. It was besieged by the troops of the Holy Roman Empire in 1635, and in order to hamper the attacks the Swedish commander set fire to the suburbs, causing a city fire, however, it was still captured by imperial troops. In 1636 it was recaptured by the Swedes, then it was taken and plundered by Imperial troops to fall back to the Swedes again after the Battle of Wittstock. In 1637 it was again captured by Imperial troops and then by Sweden. As a result of the war, the population decreased by about 75%.

In accordance to the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, in 1653 it was incorporated, together with the rest of Farther Pomerania, into Brandenburg-Prussia. In 1701 Stargard became part of the Kingdom of Prussia and in 1818, after the Napoleonic Wars, Stargard became part of the new district Szadzko (then officially &quot;Saatzig&quot;) within the Province of Pomerania. During the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871), the Prussians established a prisoner-of-war camp for French troops in the city.

As a result of the unification of Germany in 1871 the city became part of the German Empire. On 1 April 1901 it became an independent city, separate from the Saatzig District. According to the Prussian census of 1905, Stargard had a population of 26,907, of which 97% were Germans and 3% were Poles. During World War I, the Germans operated a prisoner-of-war camp in Stargard, which housed in total some 50,000 POWs, including Russian (including ethnic Poles from the Russian Partition of Poland conscripted to the Tsarist army), French (including Algerians), Belgian, American, English, Serbian, Romanian, Portuguese, Italian and Japanese. In interwar Germany, the town was the site of a concentration camp for unwanted Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe. The &quot;Stargarder Zeitung&quot; was as a local newspaper published in Stargard. In the March 1933 German federal election the Nazi Party received 58.7% of the vote in the city.

===World War II===

In 1939, during the German invasion of Poland, which started World War II, the Germans established the Dulag L temporary camp for Polish (including Kashubian) prisoners of war and civilians near Stargard, which in October 1939 was transformed into the large prisoner-of-war camp Stalag II-D. Then, after the battle of France in 1940, also the French, the Dutch and Belgians were held there, from 1941 also Yugoslavian and Soviet POWs, from 1942 also thousands of Canadians captured at Dieppe, one of whom was Gerald MacIntosh Johnston, a Canadian actor, who was killed trying to escape, and after 1943 also Italians. The POWs were subjected to racial segregation, and Poles, Africans, Arabs, Jews and Soviet troops were separated from POWs of other nationalities and subjected to worse treatment. Serbs also faced more severe treatment.

There were also two subcamps of the Ravensbrück concentration camp, one in Stargard and one in the present-day district of Kluczewo, as well as seven forced labour camps. The Polish resistance organized a district of the Union of Armed Struggle and Home Army in Stargard, under the cryptonym &quot;Starka&quot;. Polish underground press was distributed in the city.

In February 1945, one of the last German armoured offensives, Operation Solstice, was launched from the Stargard area. The local population was evacuated by the Germans on the order of Heinrich Himmler before the approaching Soviets in the final stages of the war.

As a result of World War II the town again became part of Poland, under territorial changes demanded by the Soviet Union at the Potsdam Conference. Polish local administration was appointed on March 23, 1945. The town was repopulated by Poles, many of whom were displaced from former eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union.

===Post-war period===
In 1950 the city was renamed &quot;Stargard Szczeciński&quot; by adding the adjective &quot;Szczeciński&quot; after the nearby city of Szczecin to distinguish it from Starogard Gdański in Gdańsk Pomerania. In 1961 the city limits were expanded by including the settlement of Kluczewo as a new district.

In 1979 the city suffered a flood.

In 1993 the city celebrated the 750th anniversary of receiving city rights.

In 2004 a north-western part of the town was made into an industrial park - Stargardzki Park Przemysłowy. Another industrial park is located in the south - Park Przemysłowy Wysokich Technologii.

On January 1, 2016, the town was renamed back to &quot;Stargard&quot;.

==Landmarks and monuments==
Heavy bombing during World War II devastated most of Stargard&#x27;s fine historical sites and destroyed over 75% of the city.

<text>Nowogard () (; ) is a town in northwestern Poland, in the West Pomeranian Voivodeship. it had a population of 16,733.

==Name==
&quot;Nowogard&quot; is a combination of two Slavic terms: novi (new) and gard, which is Pomeranian for &quot;town&quot;, &quot;city&quot;, or &quot;fortified settlement&quot;. In this capacity, the term gard (or gôrd) is still being used in the only surviving variation of the Pomeranian language, Kashubian.

==Location==
Nowogard has been situated in Goleniow County of West Pomeranian Voivodship since 1999, but formerly in Szczecin Voivodship from 1975 to 1998. It is located northeast of Szczecin and south of the Baltic coast

==History==

In the 10th century the area became part of Poland. Probably then the first Catholic chapel was established in present-day Nowogard. The town&#x27;s origins go back to a fortified Slavic settlement which was the seat of the local castellan. The settlement was first mentioned in 1268 as &quot;Nogart&quot; when Barnim I, the Duke of Pomerania granted it as a fief to the Bishopric of Cammin (Kamień Pomorski). The bishops erected a castle in the city. In 1274, the town and its surrounding area was administered by Otto von Eberstein, it remained in the possession of the von Eberstein family until 1663. They were a collateral branch of the Counts of Everstein (sometimes also called Eberstein) from Lower Saxony with their ancestral home Everstein Castle on the Burgberg (ridge).

In 1309 the town adopted German municipal law. In the first half of the 14th century, new fortifications were erected with an oblong market square in the center of the town. This is where the town hall and St. Mary&#x27;s Church were erected.
In 1663, after the death of the last Eberstein, Naugard became property of Ernst Bogislaw von Croÿ and in 1684, property of the electors of Brandenburg. During the Napoleonic Wars, in 1807, the town was captured by allied Polish-French-Italian forces. In the 18th century, the town became part of Prussia, and from 1871 it was also part of Germany. During World War II many forced labourers of different nationalities were brought to the town by the Germans, and there was also a Nazi German prison for youth in the town.

Throughout the Soviet East Pomeranian Offensive operation of World War II up to 60 percent of the town was destroyed. On the 5 March 1945, the town was taken by the Red Army, and the population fled or was expelled in accordance to the Potsdam Agreement. Following the war, Nowogard became again part of Poland, although with a Soviet-installed communist regime, which stayed in power until the Fall of Communism in the 1980s. It was resettled with Poles. The first new Polish settlers were the freed forced labourers.

In 2016, town limits were slightly expanded by including a part of the village of Miętno.

==Sights==

The city&#x27;s main tourist attraction is a large lake which extends to the center of Nowogard. Its surface covers with a length of and a width of . Surrounding forests have mushrooms, berries and game. Historic heritage sights include the Gothic Church of the Assumption and medieval town walls.

==Population==


==Transport==
The Polish S6 highway acts as a bypass of the town, and the Voivodeship roads (roads of regional importance) 106 and 144 pass through the town. There is also a train station in Nowogard.

== Notable residents==
* Friedrich Michael Ziegenhagen (1694–1776), German clergyman, court preacher of George I of Great Britain
* Paul Manasse (1866 in Naugard – 1927) a German physician, who specialized in the field of otology
* Zbigniew Szczepkowski (born 1952) a Polish former cyclist, competed in the team pursuit at the 1976 Summer Olympics
* Ewa Durska (born 1977) a two time Paralympic gold medalist, competing mainly in category T20 shot put

==International relations==
===Twin towns — sister cities===
Nowogard is twinned with:
* Gützkow, Germany
* Heide, Germany
* Kävlinge, Sweden
* Veles, North Macedonia

In 1963 West Germany (&quot;FRG&quot;) town of Heide took over a partnership for the expelled populace of Naugard. In 1996 this led to the signing of a contract of partnership between Heide and Nowogard in which the former populace is regarded &quot;constitutive partners&quot;.

<text>Sylvester James Jr. (September 6, 1947December 16, 1988), known simply as Sylvester, was an American singer-songwriter. Primarily active in the genres of disco, rhythm and blues, and soul, he was known for his flamboyant and androgynous appearance, falsetto singing voice, and hit disco singles in the late 1970s and 1980s.
Born in Watts, Los Angeles, to a middle-class African-American family, Sylvester developed a love of singing through the gospel choir of his Pentecostal church. Leaving the church after the congregation expressed disapproval of his homosexuality, he found friendship among a group of Black cross-dressers and transgender women who called themselves the Disquotays. Moving to San Francisco in 1970 at the age of 22, Sylvester embraced the counterculture and joined the avant-garde drag troupe the Cockettes, producing solo segments of their shows, which were heavily influenced by female blues and jazz singers such as Billie Holiday and Josephine Baker. During the Cockettes&#x27; critically panned tour of New York City, Sylvester left them to pursue his career elsewhere. He came to front Sylvester and his Hot Band, a rock act that released two commercially unsuccessful albums on Blue Thumb Records in 1973 before disbanding.
Focusing on a solo career, Sylvester signed a recording contract with Harvey Fuqua of Fantasy Records and obtained three new backing singers in the form of Martha Wash and Izora Rhodes – the &quot;Two Tons O&#x27; Fun&quot; – as well as Jeanie Tracy. His first solo album, &quot;Sylvester&quot; (1977), was a moderate success. This was followed with the acclaimed disco album &quot;Step II&quot; (1978), which spawned the singles &quot;You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)&quot; and &quot;Dance (Disco Heat)&quot;, both of which were hits in the US and Europe. Distancing himself from the disco genre, he recorded four more albums – including a live album – with Fantasy Records. After leaving this label, he signed to Megatone Records, the dance-oriented company founded by friend and collaborator Patrick Cowley, where he recorded four more albums, including the Cowley penned hit Hi-NRG track &quot;Do Ya Wanna Funk&quot;. Sylvester was an activist who campaigned against the spread of HIV/AIDS. He died from complications arising from the virus in 1988, leaving all future royalties from his work to San Francisco-based HIV/AIDS charities.
During the late 1970s, Sylvester gained the nickname of the &quot;Queen of Disco&quot; and during his life he attained particular recognition in San Francisco, where he was awarded the key to the city. In 2005, he was posthumously inducted into the Dance Music Hall of Fame, while his life has been recorded in a biography and made the subject of both a documentary and a musical.

==Early life==

===1947–1960: Childhood===
Sylvester James was born on September 6, 1947, in the Watts district of Los Angeles, California, into a middle-class family. His mother, Letha Weaver, had been raised near Palestine, Arkansas, into a relatively wealthy African-American family, who owned their own farmland. Letha&#x27;s biological mother, Gertha Weaver, was unmarried and too sickly to care for her child, so Gertha&#x27;s sister Julia, known to the family as JuJu, became Letha&#x27;s adoptive mother. In the late 1930s, Letha, Julia, and Julia&#x27;s husband took part in the Great Migration of African-Americans out of the Southern United States, relocating to Watts, where Letha married her first husband, Sylvester &quot;Sweet&quot; James. The couple moved into a small cottage owned by Letha&#x27;s parents. Their first child, named Sylvester after his father, was followed by the birth of John Wesley in 1948 and Larry in 1950. Sylvester and his brothers became better known in their predominantly African-American community by their nicknames, with Sylvester&#x27;s being &quot;Dooni&quot;. Sylvester considered his father to be a &quot;lowlife&quot; because he was an adulterer and left his wife and children when the boys were still young. Letha and her three sons moved to a downtown housing project at Aliso Village before moving back into her parental home at 114th Street in Watts.

Letha was a devout adherent of the Pentecostal denomination of Christianity, regularly attending the Palm Lane Church of God in Christ in South Los Angeles. Sylvester and his brothers accompanied her to the church&#x27;s services, where he developed a particular interest in gospel music. Having been an avid singer since the age of three, Sylvester regularly joined in with gospel performances. He sang the song &quot;My Buddy&quot; at the funeral of one of the other children in the Park Lane congregation.

The women at his church described him as &quot;feminine&quot; and as &quot;pretty as he could be, just like his mother&quot;. He wasn&#x27;t rough like the other boys. He was prim and proper. We were always hugging on him and kissing on him, because he was so cute.&quot; Family members also described him as &quot;his own kind of boy—&#x27;born funny&#x27;&quot;—preferring the company of girls and women like his grandmother to that of other boys. &quot;He stayed inside a lot, reading encyclopedias, listening to music, and playing his grandmother&#x27;s piano.&quot; When Sylvester would turn down the boys&#x27; invitations to play with them, they would say things like, &quot;He act like a girl!&quot; or &quot;He&#x27;s going to be a girl.&quot; But his mother would defend him, including his joy at dressing up in her and his grandmother&#x27;s clothes, saying that he was not a girl, just a different kind of boy, and a valued part of their family.

At the age of eight, he was sexually molested by a man at the church—at the time rumored to be the church organist. Although Sylvester would always maintain that this interaction had been consensual and not sexual molestation, Sylvester was only a child at the time of this incident, while the assailant was an adult. Because of the injuries caused by the rape, Sylvester had to be taken to a doctor, who told Sylvester&#x27;s mother that her son was gay. Viewing homosexuality as a perversion and a sin, Letha had a difficulty accepting that. News of Sylvester&#x27;s &quot;homosexual activity&quot; soon spread through the church congregation and, feeling unwelcome, he ceased his attendance at age 13.

During Sylvester&#x27;s childhood, his mother gave birth to three more children by different fathers before marrying Robert &quot;Sonny&quot; Hurd in the early 1960s, with whom she adopted three foster children. A supervisor at aerospace manufacturer North American Rockwell, Hurd&#x27;s job increased the family income and they were able to move into a more expensive, predominantly white neighborhood north of Watts. The relationship between Sylvester and both his mother and stepfather was strained; in the midst of one argument with his mother, Sylvester decided to leave their house permanently.

===1960–1970: The Disquotays===
Now homeless, Sylvester spent much of the next decade staying with friends and relatives, in particular, his grandmother Julia, who expressed no disapproval of his homosexuality, having been a friend of a number of gay men in the 1930s. On occasion, he returned to his mother and step-father&#x27;s house for a few days at a time, particularly to spend time with his younger sisters, Bernadette and Bernadine. Aged 15, he began frequenting local gay clubs and built up a group of friends from the local gay Black community, eventually forming themselves into a group which they called the Disquotays. Sylvester&#x27;s best friend among the Disquotays was a trans woman named Duchess, who earned her money as a prostitute, a job that Sylvester refused to engage in. The group held lavish house parties, sometimes (without permission) at the home of their friend, rhythm and blues singer Etta James, in which they dressed up in female clothing and wigs, constantly trying to outdo one another in appearance.

Sylvester&#x27;s boyfriend during the latter part of the 1960s was a young man named Lonnie Prince; well-built and attractive, many of Sylvester&#x27;s friends described the pair as being &quot;the It couple&quot;. Sylvester often hitchhiked around town while in female dress; such activity carried a risk of arrest and prosecution, for cross-dressing was then illegal in California. Although avoiding imprisonment for this crime, he was arrested for shoplifting on several occasions. He found work in a variety of professions, including cooking in McDonald&#x27;s—where he was fired for refusing to wear a hairnet—cashier at an airport parking garage, working in a hair salon, at a department store, and as a make-up artist at a mortuary, preparing the corpses for their funerals. In the 1960s, the Civil Rights Movement was at its peak, but Sylvester and his friends did not take an active role within it. During the Watts riots between members of the Black community and the predominantly white police force, they joined in with the widespread rioting and looting, stealing wigs, hairspray, and lipstick.

Although he had little interest in formal education and rarely attended classes, Sylvester was enrolled at Jordan High School. He graduated in 1969 at the age of 21; in his graduation photograph, he appeared in drag wearing a blue chiffon prom dress and beehive hairstyle. By the end of the decade, the Disquotays had begun to drift apart, with a number of them abandoning cross-dressing and others recognizing that they were trans women and undergoing sex reassignment surgery. Sylvester always considered himself male and began to tone down the feminine nature of his clothing, aiming for a more androgynous look which combined male and female styles and which was influenced by the fashions of the hippie movement.

===1970–1972: The Cockettes===
At Los Angeles&#x27; Whisky a Go Go bar, Sylvester met Reggie Dunnigan, who invited him to move to the city of San Francisco in Northern California to join the &quot;Chocolate Cockettes&quot;—Black members of an &quot;avant-garde&quot; performance art drag troupe known as the Cockettes. Founded by drag queen Hibiscus in 1970, the Cockettes parodied popular culture, were involved in the Gay Liberation movement, and were influenced by the ethos of the hippie movement, living communally, embracing free love, and consuming mind-altering substances such as marijuana and LSD. With the Disquotays disbanded, Sylvester had tired of Los Angeles, and was attracted by San Francisco&#x27;s reputation as a gay and counter-cultural haven. Arriving in the city, he stayed in the Cockettes&#x27; communal home for several days. They were impressed with his falsetto singing voice and his ability to play the piano, asking him to appear in an upcoming show, &quot;Radio Rodeo&quot;. Sylvester agreed, and one of his first performances involved singing the theme song of &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot; while dressed in a cowgirl skirt. Moving into the Cockettes&#x27; communal residence, he soon found the flat too crowded and had difficulty with the lack of privacy; after a year he moved into a new house on Market Street with two fellow Cockettes.

Although a significant member of the troupe, Sylvester remained a relatively isolated figure; not only was he one of very few African-American members, he eschewed the group&#x27;s more surrealist activities for what he saw as classier, more glamorous performances onstage. In the Cockettes&#x27; performances, he was usually given an entire scene to himself, often with little relevance to the narrative and theme of the rest of the show, although through doing so, he gained his own following. With a piano player named Peter Mintun, Sylvester worked on solo scenes in which he exhibited his interest in blues and jazz by imitating several of his musical idols such as Billie Holiday and Josephine Baker. Adding to his image, Sylvester used the pseudonym &quot;Ruby Blue&quot; and described himself as &quot;Billie Holiday&#x27;s cousin once removed&quot;. Fascinated by Black musical heritage, he read up on the subject and became a collector of &quot;negrobilia&quot;; in some of his Cockette performances, he played up to racial stereotypes of African-Americans to ridicule the stereotypes themselves.

In 1970, Sylvester entered into an open relationship with Michael Lyons, a young white man, and soon proposed marriage to him. Although same-sex marriage was not legally recognized in the US, the couple held a wedding in the Shakespeare Garden of Golden Gate Park. At the invitation of the manager of the Palace Theater, Sylvester appeared in a spoof film, &quot;Tricia&#x27;s Wedding&quot;, which parodied the marriage of Tricia Nixon Cox, daughter of President Richard Nixon. In the film, Sylvester played the role of both Coretta Scott King and the African ambassador Uma King. In 1971, Sylvester was given a one-man show, &quot;Sylvester Sings&quot;, at the Palace Theater, for which he was accompanied by Peter Mintun. He nevertheless remained a part of the Cockette troupe during their divisive split, in which Hibiscus and his followers left to form the Angels of Light. Following Hibiscus&#x27; departure, the Cockettes began to gain increasing media attention, with celebrities such as Rex Reed, Truman Capote, and Gloria Vanderbilt enthusing about their performances. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine singled out Sylvester&#x27;s performances for particular praise, describing him as &quot;a beautiful Black androgyne who has a gospel sound with the heat and shimmer of Aretha&quot;.

The success led the troupe to take their show to New York City, a city with a long history of drag culture. Arriving in November 1971, they immersed themselves in the city&#x27;s &quot;avant-garde&quot;, attending parties held by Andy Warhol and &quot;Screw&quot; magazine. Spending so much of their time partying, most of the Cockettes did not rehearse, the exception being Sylvester, who wanted to perfect his act. Although the Cockettes&#x27; performance at the Anderson Theater was panned by critics, Sylvester&#x27;s act was widely praised as a highlight of the show. Realizing that he had far better prospects as a solo artist, on the second New York performance he opened his act by telling the audience, &quot;I apologize for this travesty that I&#x27;m associated with&quot;, while on the seventh he announced that he would be leaving the Cockettes altogether.

==Emerging solo career==
===1972–1974: Sylvester and his Hot Band===
Returning to San Francisco, Sylvester was offered the opportunity to record a demo album by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; editor Jann Wenner. Financed by A&amp;M Records, the album featured a cover of Bonnie Bramlett and Leon Russell&#x27;s song &quot;Superstar&quot;, which had been a recent hit single for the Carpenters. Nevertheless, A&amp;M felt that the work was not commercially viable and declined to release the album. For the album, Sylvester and his manager Dennis Lopez had assembled a group of heterosexual white males—Bobby Blood on trumpet, Chris Mostert on saxophone, James Q. Smith on guitar, Travis Fullerton on drums, and Kerry Hatch on bass—whom he named the Hot Band. After A&amp;M&#x27;s initial rejection, the band provided two songs for &quot;Lights Out San Francisco,&quot; an album compiled by San Francisco&#x27;s KSAN radio and released on the Blue Thumb label. Gaining a number of local gigs, they were eventually asked to open for English glam rock star David Bowie at the Winterland Ballroom. The gig did not sell particularly well, and Bowie later commented that San Francisco did not need him, because &quot;They&#x27;ve got Sylvester&quot;, referring to their shared preference for androgyny.

In early 1973, Sylvester and the Hot Band were signed by Bob Krasnow to Blue Thumb. On this label, they produced their first album, in which they switched their sound from blues to the more commercially viable rock, while the Pointer Sisters were employed as backing singers. Sylvester named this first album &quot;Scratch My Flower&quot; due to a gardenia-shaped scratch-and-sniff sticker adhered to the cover, although it was instead released under the title of &quot;Sylvester and his Hot Band&quot;. The album consisted primarily of covers of songs by artists such as James Taylor, Ray Charles, Neil Young, and Leiber and Stoller. Described by one of Sylvester&#x27;s biographers as lacking in &quot;the fire and focus of the live shows&quot;, it sold poorly on release.

Sylvester and his Hot Band toured the United States, receiving threats of violence in several Southern states, where widespread conservative and racist attitudes led to antagonism between the band and locals. In late 1973, the band recorded their second album, &quot;Bazaar&quot;, which included both cover songs and original compositions by bassist Kerry Hatch. Hatch later commented that the Hot Band found the album more satisfactory than its predecessor, but nevertheless it again sold poorly. The music journalist Peter Shapiro believed that on these Blue Thumb albums, Sylvester&#x27;s &quot;cottony falsetto was an uncomfortable match with guitars&quot; and that they both had &quot;an unpleasantly astringent quality&quot;.
Finding Sylvester difficult to work with, and frustrated by his lack of commercial success, the Hot Band left Sylvester in late 1974, after which Krasnow canceled his recording contract. At the same time, Sylvester&#x27;s relationship with Lyons ended, with Lyons himself moving to Hawaii.

===1974–1977: Two Tons O&#x27; Fun and &quot;Sylvester&quot;===

Now without the Hot Band or a recording contract, Sylvester set himself up with a new band, the Four As, and a new set of backing singers, two Black drag queens named Gerry Kirby and Lady Bianca. With this new entourage, he continued to perform at a number of local venues including Jewel&#x27;s Catch One, a predominantly Black gay dance club on West Pico Avenue in Los Angeles, but reviewers were unimpressed with the new line-up, most of whom abandoned Sylvester in December 1974. After a brief sojourn in England, Sylvester returned to San Francisco and assembled three young drag queens to be backing singers: Arnold Elzie, Leroy Davis, and Gerry Kirby. Nevertheless, although he performed at such events as the 1975 Castro Street Fair, success continued to elude him, and he eventually fired Elzie, Davis, and Kirby.

Sylvester employed Brent Thomson as his new manager; she suggested that he rid himself of his androgynous image and wear more masculine clothing to gain a recording contract; as she put it, &quot;nobody is giving out recording contracts to drag queens&quot;. Thomson opened auditions for new backing singers, with Sylvester being captivated by one of those auditioning, Martha Wash. Sylvester asked her if she had another large Black friend who could sing, after which she introduced him to Izora Rhodes. Although he referred to them simply as &quot;the girls&quot;, Wash and Rhodes named themselves the Two Tons O&#x27; Fun (and much later, when they achieved mainstream success, as the Weather Girls), and continued to work with Sylvester intermittently until his death, developing a close friendship with him. They were soon joined by bassist John Dunstan and keyboard player Dan Reich.

Playing gay bars such as The Stud and The EndUp, in September 1976 Sylvester and his band gained a regular weekend job at The Palms nightclub on Polk Street, performing two or three sets a night; most of these were covers, but some were original compositions by Sylvester and his then-guitarist Tip Wirrick. It was through this show that Sylvester came to the attention of Motown producer Harvey Fuqua, and Fuqua subsequently signed Sylvester onto a solo deal with Fantasy Records in 1977.

In the middle of that year, he recorded his third album, the self-titled &quot;Sylvester&quot;, which featured a cover design depicting Sylvester in male attire. The songs included on the album were influenced by dance music, and included Sylvester&#x27;s own compositions, such as &quot;Never Too Late&quot;, as well as covers of hits such as Ashford &amp; Simpson&#x27;s &quot;Over and Over&quot;. Many reviewers noted that Sylvester&#x27;s image had been altered since his early career, moving him away from the glittery androgynous appearance to that of a more conventional rhythm-and-blues singer which would have wider commercial appeal. Released as a single, Sylvester&#x27;s &quot;Over and Over&quot; proved a minor hit in the US, but was more successful in Mexico and Europe. Building on the album&#x27;s release, Sylvester toured Louisiana and then Mexico City.

===1978: &quot;Step II&quot; and disco success===
Sylvester&#x27;s fame increased following the release of his solo album, and he was employed to perform regularly at The Elephant Walk gay bar in the Castro, an area of San Francisco known as a gay village. He became a friend of Harvey Milk—known locally as the &quot;Mayor of Castro Street&quot;—who was the first openly gay man to be elected to public office in California, and performed at Milk&#x27;s birthday party that year. In the spring of 1978, Sylvester successfully auditioned for a cameo appearance in the film &quot;The Rose&quot; starring gay icon Bette Midler. In the film, he plays one of the drag queens singing along to Bob Seger&#x27;s &quot;Fire Down Below&quot;, in a single scene that was filmed in a run-down bar in downtown Los Angeles.

Sylvester released his second solo album, &quot;Step II&quot;, in September 1978. For this release, he was particularly influenced by the genre of dance music known as disco which was then becoming increasingly popular across the Western world. Disco was closely associated with the gay, Black, and Latino communities in the US and dominated by Black female artists such as Donna Summer, Gloria Gaynor, and Grace Jones, with Sylvester initially being unsure that it was a suitable genre for him to work in; he nevertheless recognized its increasing commercial potential. During production of the album, Sylvester invited the musician Patrick Cowley to join his studio band, being impressed by Cowley&#x27;s innovative techniques using synthesizers. The album landed Cowley a job as a back-up musician on Sylvester&#x27;s subsequent worldwide tours, and the two started a close friendship and collaboration. Once again co-produced by Harvey Fuqua and released on Fuqua&#x27;s Fantasy label, &quot;Step II&quot; contained two disco songs that were subsequently released as singles, &quot;You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)&quot;, written by James Wirrick, and &quot;Dance (Disco Heat)&quot;, written by Eric Robinson.

Both singles proved commercial hits both domestically and abroad, topping the American dance chart and breaking into the US pop charts. The album itself was also a success, being certified gold, and was described by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine as being &quot;as good as disco gets&quot;. In his history of disco, Shapiro described &quot;You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)&quot; as Sylvester&#x27;s &quot;greatest record&quot;, &quot;the cornerstone of gay disco&quot;, and &quot;an epochal record in disco history&quot;. Shapiro noted that Sylvester&#x27;s work brought together elements from both of the main strands of disco; the &quot;gospel/R&amp;B tradition&quot; and the &quot;mechanical, piston-pumping beats&quot; tradition, but that in doing so he went &quot;way beyond either&quot;. Shapiro expressed the view that &quot;Sylvester propelled his falsetto far above his natural range into the ether and rode machine rhythms that raced toward escape velocity, creating a new sonic lexicon powerful, camp, and otherworldly enough to articulate the exquisite bliss of disco&#x27;s dance floor utopia&quot;.

In both August and December 1978, Sylvester visited London, England to promote his music; he proved hugely popular in the city, performing at a number of different nightclubs and being mobbed by fans. It was while in the city that he filmed the music video for &quot;You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)&quot;. Back in the US, Sylvester began to appear on television shows to advertise his music, appearing on &quot;Dinah Shore&quot;, &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, &quot;Rock Concert&quot;, and &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot;. He also undertook a series of tours across the country, opening for both the Commodores and Chaka Khan, and performing alongside the O&#x27;Jays, War, and L.T.D. As a result, he earned a number of awards and performed at several award ceremonies. Through this developing public presence, Sylvester, alongside other visibly queer performers such as the Village People, helped to solidify the connection between disco and homosexuality within the public imagination; this however furthered the anti-disco sentiment among rock music fans which would emerge as the Disco Sucks movement.

==Later life==

===1979–1981: &quot;Stars&quot;, &quot;Sell My Soul&quot;, and &quot;Too Hot To Sleep&quot;===
Sylvester followed the success of &quot;Step II&quot; with an album entitled &quot;Stars&quot;. Consisting of four love songs, the title track – released as a single in January 1979 – had been written by Cowley, and Sylvester would proceed to tell the press that it was his first completely disco album, but that it would also probably be his last. He premiered the album&#x27;s four tracks on March 11, 1979, at a sold-out show in the San Francisco War Memorial Opera House. The performance was attended by a number of senior figures in local government, and halfway through, Mayor Dianne Feinstein sent her aide, Harry Britt, to award Sylvester with the key to the city and proclaim March 11 to be &quot;Sylvester Day&quot;. The Opera House gig was recorded, and subsequently released as a live album, &quot;Living Proof&quot;. Sylvester thought very highly of the album, but it did not sell well. A single released from this album, &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop Dancing&quot;, was a hit in the disco clubs but not in the pop music charts.

Despite increasing mainstream success, Sylvester continued to reaffirm his connection to the gay community of San Francisco, performing at the main stage at the 1979 Gay Freedom Day parade. Further, during his summer 1979 tour of the UK, he performed at the London Gay Pride Festival in Hyde Park. That same year, Sylvester met the singer Jeanie Tracy through Harvey Fuqua, and they immediately became friends. A large Black woman, Sylvester felt that Tracy would work well with his Two Tons O&#x27; Fun, and invited her to join his backing singers, which she proceeded to do. Subsequently, befriending the Tons, she would work for Sylvester for the rest of his life. The Tons themselves were convinced by Fuqua to produce their own self-titled album, from which came two dance chart hits, &quot;Earth Can Be Just Like Heaven&quot; and &quot;Just Us&quot;; as a result, they began to work less and less with Sylvester, only joining him on occasion for his live shows. In some interviews he would express bitterness at their departure, while in others he stressed that he had no bad feelings toward them.

In 1980, Sylvester also reached tabloid headlines after he was arrested on a visit to New York City, accused of being involved in the robbery of several rare coins. After three days of incarceration, he was released on a police bail of $30,000. Sylvester was never charged, and police later admitted their mistake after it was revealed that the real culprit had posed as Sylvester by signing cheques in his name.
Returning to San Francisco after this event, it was here that Sylvester produced his next album for Fantasy Records, &quot;Sell My Soul&quot;. Largely avoiding disco after the genre had become unpopular following the much publicized Disco Sucks movement, &quot;Sell My Soul&quot; instead represented a selection of soul-inspired dance tracks. Recorded in two weeks, Sylvester worked largely with backing singers and musicians whom he was unfamiliar with, and regular collaborators Rhodes and Cowley were entirely absent. Reviews were generally poor, describing the album as being average in quality. The only disco song on the album, &quot;I Need You&quot;, was released as a single, but fared poorly.

Sylvester&#x27;s fifth and final album for Fantasy Records was &quot;Too Hot to Sleep&quot;, in which he once again eschewed disco for a series of groove soul tunes, ballads, and gospel-style tracks. Missing the Two Tons entirely, Tracy was instead accompanied by a new backing singer, Maurice &quot;Mo&quot; Long, and because the three of them had all grown up in the Church of God in Christ, they decided to refer to themselves as the &quot;C.O.G.I.C. Singers&quot;. The album also featured a number of tracks in which Sylvester avoided his usual falsetto tones to sing in a baritone voice. The album sold poorly.

===1982–1986: Megatone Records===

Both the Two Tons and Sylvester came to suspect that Fantasy Records had failed to pay them all of the money that they were owed from the sale of their records. Sylvester left Fantasy and in November 1982 he filed a lawsuit against them; it ultimately proved successful in establishing that the company had been withholding money from him totaling $218,112.50. Nevertheless, Fuqua proved unable to pay anything more than $20,000, meaning that Sylvester never saw the majority of the money that was legally owed to him. Sylvester grew to despise Fuqua, and forbade his friends from ever mentioning his name.

Closely associated with the now unpopular disco and having had no hit singles in the preceding few years, after leaving Fantasy, Sylvester was not a particular draw for major record labels. Recognizing this state of affairs, in 1982 Sylvester commented that &quot;there&#x27;s nothing worse than a fallen star&quot; who still has &quot;illusions&quot; of their continuing fame. Rather than chasing major chart success, Sylvester wanted to focus on retaining creative control over his music. Hiring his former tour manager and longstanding friend Tim McKenna as his new manager, Sylvester decided to produce his next album with Megatone Records, a small San Francisco company that had been founded in 1981 by Patrick Cowley and Marty Blecman and which catered largely to the gay club scene. The result was &quot;All I Need&quot; (1982), on which James Wirrick had written most of the songs, which were dance-orientated and influenced by the new wave music then in vogue. Sylvester insisted that he include several ballads on the album, which featured cover art by Mark Amerika depicting Sylvester in ancient Egyptian garb.

One of the best known Sylvester songs of this period was &quot;Do Ya Wanna Funk&quot;, a Hi-NRG dance track co-written with Cowley which was released as a single in July 1982, topping the US dance charts and entering the pop charts in a number of countries across the world. Although he had continued working, Cowley was suffering from the recently discovered HIV/AIDS virus – at the time still referred to as &quot;gay-related immune deficiency&quot; (GRID) by American doctors – and was in a deteriorating physical condition. Sylvester continued touring, and it was while in London, preparing to perform at the Heaven superclub, that he learned of Cowley&#x27;s death on November 12, 1982. He went onstage, informing the crowd of Cowley&#x27;s passing and then sang &quot;Do Ya Wanna Funk&quot; in memory of him.

In 1983, Sylvester became a partner of Megatone Records. That year he also brought out his second album with the company, &quot;Call Me&quot;, but it was not a commercial success. Four songs from the album were released as singles, although only &quot;Trouble in Paradise&quot; entered the top 20 of the US dance charts; Sylvester later related that the song was his &quot;AIDS message to San Francisco&quot;. Sylvester was emotionally moved by the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and began helping out at the Rita Rockett Lounge for patients of the disease at the San Francisco General Hospital as well as performing at various benefit concerts to raise money and awareness to combat the spread of the disease. In February 1984 he also performed a &quot;One Night Only&quot; retrospective of his work at the prestigious Castro Theatre. Sylvester still toured both domestically and in Europe, although he found that demand for his performances was decreasing, and that he was now playing to smaller venues and singing to a pre-recorded tape rather than to a live band as he had in the late 1970s.

His next album, entitled &quot;M-1015&quot; (1984), was more frenetic and pumping than his previous releases, having embraced the recently developed genre of Hi-NRG, but it also included elements of electro and rap. The major figures behind the album had been Kessie and Morey Goldstein, and Sylvester himself had not written any of the tracks. The album also contained increasingly sexually explicit lyrics, in particular in the songs &quot;How Do You Like Your Love&quot; and &quot;Sex&quot;. That year, he also entered into a relationship with an architect named Rick Cranmer, and together they moved into a new apartment in the hills, where Sylvester decorated his powder room with posters and memorabilia of Divine, the drag queen, actor and singer whom he had briefly known when they were in the Cockettes. In 1985, he fulfilled a lifelong ambition by working with the singer Aretha Franklin; he and Jeanie had been invited to provide backing vocals on Franklin&#x27;s album &quot;Who&#x27;s Zoomin&#x27; Who?&quot;.

Sylvester&#x27;s final album, &quot;Mutual Attraction&quot; (1986), was produced by Megatone but licensed and released by Warner Bros. On the album, Sylvester had worked with a wide number of collaborators, and included new tracks alongside covers of songs by Stevie Wonder and George Gershwin. Reviews of the album were mixed, with many claiming that it was a poor release. One of the album&#x27;s singles, &quot;Someone Like You&quot;, proved more successful, reaching number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; dance charts. Warner Bros booked him to appear on the New Year&#x27;s Eve edition of &quot;The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers&quot;, during which Joan Rivers described him as a drag queen; visibly annoyed, he corrected her by stating that he was not a drag queen, proclaiming simply &quot;I&#x27;m Sylvester!&quot; The appearance was also notable for Sylvester publicly declaring his relationship with Rick Cranmer despite the fact that Cranmer&#x27;s family were largely unaware of either the liaison or his sexuality.

===1986–1988: Final years and death===
In 1985, Sylvester&#x27;s boyfriend, Rick Cranmer, became aware that he had become infected with HIV. With no known medical cure, his health deteriorated rapidly and he died September 7, 1987. Sylvester was devastated, and although recognizing that he too was probably infected, he refused to have his blood tested, only noticing the virus&#x27; first symptoms when he developed a persistent cough. Beginning work on an album that would remain unfinished, he moved into a new apartment on Collingwood Street in the Castro, and tried his best to continue performing in the Bay Area, even though he became too ill to undertake a full tour. Eventually diagnosed with AIDS, he was hospitalized for sinus surgery in late 1987, and upon returning to his apartment, he began to be cared for by his mother and Tracy, before being hospitalized again in May 1988, this time with pneumocystis pneumonia. Returning to his flat, he gave away many of his treasured possessions and wrote his will.

Having lost a lot of weight and unable to walk easily, he attended the Castro&#x27;s 1988 Gay Freedom Parade in a wheelchair, being pushed along by McKenna in front of the People with AIDS banner; along Market Street, assembled crowds shouted out his name as he passed. The subsequent 1988 Castro Street Fair was named &quot;A Tribute to Sylvester&quot;, and although he was too ill to attend, crowds chanted his name to such an extent that he was able to hear them from his bedroom. He appeared at the Dreamland nightclub (now The Vendry), watching the dancers from the second floor balcony, and DJ Steve Fabus put together an impromptu set of Sylvester songs. When he waved weakly goodbye, the dance floor erupted in stomping and shouting &quot;We love you!&quot; He continued to give interviews to the media, being open about the fact that he was dying of AIDS, and sought in particular to highlight the impact that the disease was having in the African-American community. In an interview with the &quot;NME&quot;, he stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t believe that AIDS is the wrath of God. People have a tendency to blame everything on God.&quot;

For Thanksgiving 1988, his family spent the holiday with him, although he had developed neuropathy and was increasingly bed-ridden and reliant on morphine. He died in his bed on December 16, 1988, at the age of 41. Sylvester had planned his own funeral, insisting that he be dressed in a red kimono and placed in an open-top coffin for the mourners to see, with his friend Yvette Flunder doing his corpse&#x27;s makeup. He wanted Tracy to sing at his funeral, accompanied by choirs and many flowers. The whole affair took place in his church, the Love Center, with a sermon being provided by Rev. Walter Hawkins. The event was packed, with standing room only, and the coffin was subsequently taken and buried at his family&#x27;s plot in Inglewood Park Cemetery. An album titled &quot;Immortal&quot; was posthumously released; it contained Sylvester&#x27;s final studio recordings and was compiled by Marty Blecman.

==Personal life==
Sylvester has been described as having a &quot;flamboyant and colourful&quot; public persona, wearing both male and female gendered clothes as part of his attire, with his biographer Joshua Gamson opining that for Sylvester, &quot;gender was an everyday choice&quot;. Sylvester described his public persona as &quot;an extension of me, the real me&quot;.
Sylvester&#x27;s friend and publicist Sharon Davis described him as &quot;a quiet, often thoughtful, caring guy, who put others before himself, and was generous to a fault, having little regard for money. His policy was you only live once, so enjoy!&quot; She also noted that he could be &quot;unpredictable&quot;, being &quot;stubborn as a mule&quot; and &quot;always speak[ing] his mind&quot;.
Sylvester was considered to be a prima donna by members of the Hot Band and could be temperamental and difficult with those with whom he worked. He found it difficult saving the money that he earned, instead spending it as soon as he obtained it, both on himself and on his lovers, friends, and family.

Sylvester was openly gay, with Gamson noting that he tended to enter into relationships with men who were &quot;white, self-doubting and effeminate&quot;. In 1978, he entered into a relationship with a young white model named John Maley; Sylvester later devoted the song &quot;Can&#x27;t Forget the Love&quot; from his &quot;Too Hot to Sleep&quot; album to his young lover. Maley ended the relationship to move to Los Angeles, later recollecting that Sylvester &quot;was a lovely man, and I owe him a lot&quot;. In 1981, Sylvester entered into a relationship with a slim brunette from Deep River, Connecticut, named Michael Rayner, but unlike his predecessors, he did not move into Sylvester&#x27;s house. Their partnership ended when Rayner admitted that he had not fallen completely in love with Sylvester. Sylvester&#x27;s next major relationship was with Tom Daniels, a hairdresser whom he met in 1982, but their romance ended after six months when Daniels discovered that Sylvester had been having sex with other men while on tour. The singer&#x27;s final partner, the architect Rick Cranmer, was a six-foot two blond, and the duo moved into a house together in the hills. Cranmer died of AIDS-related complications in 1987, the year before Sylvester succumbed to the virus.

As an openly gay man throughout his career, Sylvester came to be seen as a spokesman for the gay community. He informed a journalist that &quot;I realize that gay people have put me on a pedestal and I love it. After all, of all the oppressed minorities, they just have to be the most oppressed. They have all the hassles of finding something or someone to identify with – and they chose me. I like being around gay people and they&#x27;ve proven to be some of my closest friends and most loyal audiences.&quot; Elsewhere, he nevertheless remarked that he felt his career had &quot;transcended the gay movement. I mean, my sexuality has nothing to do with my music. When I&#x27;m fucking I&#x27;m not thinking about singing and vice versa.&quot; He was openly critical of what he perceived as divisive tendencies within the gay community itself, noting that &quot;I get this conformist shit from queens all the time. They always want to read me. They always want me to do it their way. I am not going to conform to the gay lifestyle as they see it and that&#x27;s for sure&quot;. He was particularly critical of &quot;clones&quot; – gay men who dressed alike with boots, boot-cut jeans, checked shirts and handlebar mustaches – stating that all too often they judged those gay people who were flamboyant or extravagant.

Davis characterized Sylvester as an &quot;absolute perfectionist&quot;. He was very self-conscious about his physical appearance, and when he obtained enough money from the successful &quot;Step II&quot; album, he spent part of it on cosmetic surgery to remove a bump on his nose, inject silicone into his cheeks, and have cosmetic work done on his teeth. He would also insist that all pictures of himself were meticulously airbrushed.

Sylvester was born into and raised in the Pentecostal denomination of Christianity and attended church throughout his life. He often compared the ecstatic feelings that accompanied his onstage performances with the feelings experienced in a gospel choir in a Pentecostal church. When performances reached a certain level of heightened emotion, he would comment that &quot;we had service&quot;. In later life, he joined the Love Center Church in East Oakland, a ministry founded by the preacher and former gospel singer Walter Hawkins in the 1970s. He had been introduced to the church by Jeanie Tracy in the 1980s and would soon become a regular churchgoer, enjoying the place&#x27;s welcoming attitude towards societal outcasts. Sylvester requested that his funeral be undertaken by the ministry at the Love Center.

==Legacy==
During the late 1970s, Sylvester gained the moniker of the &quot;Queen of Disco&quot;, a term that continued to be given to the singer into the 21st century. The English journalist Stephen Brogan later described him as &quot;a star who shined brightly. He only happened once. He was a radical and a visionary in terms of queerness, music and race.&quot; Reynaldo Anderson of Harris-Stowe State University described Sylvester&#x27;s influence upon disco and subsequent electronic dance music as &quot;incalculable&quot;. He added that Sylvester&#x27;s songs &quot;Dance (Disco Heat)&quot;, &quot;You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)&quot;, and &quot;Do You Wanna Funk&quot; represented &quot;anthems of disco aficionados for a generation&quot;, while also expressing the view that Sylvester himself &quot;personified the excesses of the 1970s and the experimentation that characterized [the decade&#x27;s] changing social norms&quot; within the United States.

Shapiro cited Sylvester alongside other artists such as Wendy Carlos, Throbbing Gristle, and Terre Thaemlitz as an individual who used electronic music as &quot;a vehicle to express sexual transgression&quot;, while in her study of the use of falsetto in disco, Anne-Lise François believed that Sylvester&#x27;s style of singing &quot;makes the point most obviously about falsetto as a gender-bending device&quot;. The cultural studies scholar Tim Lawrence stated that Sylvester embodied &quot;the [disco] movement&#x27;s gay roots&quot;, and in doing could be contrasted with John Travolta, who embodied &quot;its commercialization and suburbanization&quot;. The two figures thus reflected a divide between the gay and straight interpretations and presentations of disco music. Layli Philips and Marla R. Stewart compared Sylvester to both Willi Ninja and RuPaul as pop icons who exhibited &quot;male femininity&quot; within the &quot;Black male diva (or &#x27;queen&#x27;) tradition&quot;.

In his will, Sylvester had declared that royalties from the future sale of this music be devoted to two HIV/AIDS charities, Project Open Hand and the AIDS Emergency Fund. Although Sylvester died deeply in debt as a result of taking advances on his royalties, by the early 1990s this debt had been paid off, and a balance had begun to build up. Roger Gross, the attorney to Sylvester&#x27;s manager and the openly gay lawyer who helped him draw up his will, petitioned the probate court to designate the charities as the beneficiaries of Sylvester&#x27;s will. The proceeds of $140,000 in accrued royalties were split between the two groups, and they will continue to be paid the royalties in the future.

On September 19, 2005, Sylvester was one of three artists inducted into the Dance Music Hall of Fame, alongside Chic and Gloria Gaynor. In December 2016, &quot;Billboard magazine&quot; ranked him as the 59th most successful dance artist of all-time. In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Sylvester at number 169 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

In 2019, &quot;You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)&quot; was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

===Biographies, documentaries, and musicals===
A biography of Sylvester was authored by Gamson and published in 2005. Writing for the London-based LGBT magazine &quot;Beige: The Provocative Cultural Quarterly&quot;, Stephen Brogan expressed his opinion that while Gamson&#x27;s biography was well researched, it had a fragmented structure and as such was &quot;not a joy to read&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called the book &quot;playful and furious&quot; and awarded it a B+ rating, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; suggested that it was &quot;as engaging as the times it so energetically resurrects&quot;, and &quot;The San Francisco Chronicle&quot; reported that the author &quot;carefully paints the shifting social tapestry into his subject&#x27;s life story without ever taking Sylvester out of the foreground&quot;. &quot;The Fabulous Sylvester&quot; won the 2006 Stonewall Book Award for nonfiction. In 2015, Sylvester&#x27;s publicist Sharon Davis published memoirs of the time that she spent with Sylvester, noting that she planned for it to appear in 2013 to mark the 25th anniversary of Sylvester&#x27;s death.

In 2010, the TV series &quot;Unsung&quot; aired an episode on Sylvester, that was later made available through YouTube. &quot;Sylvester: Mighty Real&quot;, an official feature-length documentary on the life and career of Sylvester, entered production; it featured interviews with members of Sylvester&#x27;s family and other artists and musicians who have been inspired by, but by 2012 the film&#x27;s progress had halted.

In August 2014, an Off-Broadway musical titled &quot;Mighty Real: A Fabulous Sylvester Musical&quot; opened at Theatre At St. Clement&#x27;s in New York City. It was co-directed by Kendrell Bowman and Anthony Wayne, the latter of whom also performed as the titular character. Wayne stated that he discovered Sylvester&#x27;s story through a television documentary, and was subsequently &quot;inspired by his drive to be who he was regardless of what he went through&quot;, performing a concert of Sylvester&#x27;s songs with friends Anastacia McCleskey and Jacqueline B. Arnold as the Two Tons o&#x27; Fun before deciding to begin work on the musical. A laudatory review of the musical from &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that Wayne &quot;certainly has the bravado, the androgynous sex appeal and the piercing voice to emulate the original convincingly&quot;. &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; review noted that the musical largely avoided dealing with the decline in Sylvester&#x27;s musical success during the 1980s, and that although &quot; anyone seeking an exhaustively researched play-by-play of the star&#x27;s life would be better off waiting for a documentary&quot;, the musical &quot;succeeds as a collection of infectious performances by a truly gifted cast&quot;.

In 2014 Sylvester was one of the inaugural honorees in the Rainbow Honor Walk, a walk of fame in San Francisco&#x27;s Castro neighborhood noting LGBTQ people who have &quot;made significant contributions in their fields&quot;.

In 2022 Sylvester was the subject of the first nine episodes of Sound Barrier, a podcast documentary series produced and hosted by music journalist and NYU professor Jason King.

<text>Hugh de Grandmesnil (c. 1032 – 22 February 1098), (known in French as &quot;Hugues&quot; and Latinised as &quot;Hugo de Grentmesnil&quot;, aliter &quot;Grentemesnil&quot;, etc.), is one of the proven companions of William the Conqueror known to have fought at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Subsequently, he became a great landowner in England.

He was the elder son of Robert I of Grandmesnil by his wife Hawise d&#x27;Echaffour, a daughter of Giroie, Lord of Échauffour. His younger brother was Robert II of Grandmesnil.

Following the Norman Conquest, King William the Conqueror gave Hugh 100 manors in recompense for his service, sixty-five of them in Leicestershire, in the Midlands. He was appointed Sheriff of Leicestershire and Governor of Hampshire. Hugh&#x27;s landholdings are listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 ( p 652-6).

==Origins==

The Grandmesnil family achieved prominence in about 1050 in central Normandy, where the family became famous for breeding and training war horses. The family had made a fortune from a string of stud farms they owned on the plains of Ouche, but during the minority of William, Duke of Normandy, the stability of Normandy began to break down. Old scores were settled as the barons seized each other&#x27;s territories.

Roger de Beaumont brought savage warfare to the lands of Roger de Tosny, as he tried to grasp control of the Risle Valley, in 1041. De Tosny was joined by his ally Robert de Grandmesnil, but in June their forces were shattered in a surprise attack by the Beaumont clan. In the savage fight, de Tosny and two of his sons were killed. Robert de Grandmesnil fared little better. He was carried from the field mortally wounded and died from his wounds three weeks later. His two sons, Robert and Hugh, divided his property between them; Robert entered the Church, becoming a priest, while Hugh took on his father&#x27;s mantle of warrior politician.

Hugh de Grandmesnil wielded power at the court of William Duke of Normandy, but the paranoid Duke banished Hugh in 1058. For five years Hugh was out of favour at court. In 1063 he was reinstated as Captain of the castle of Neuf-Marché en Lyons. Hugh was made a cavalry commander for the invasion of England in 1066.

There is a popular story that Hugh de Grandmesnil was almost killed at the Battle of Hastings. As fierce battle raged, Hugh&#x27;s horse leapt a bush during a cavalry charge and his bridle broke. Barely able to keep upright in the saddle, and with no control over his horse, Hugh saw to his dismay that he was all alone, and careering towards a band of Englishmen. Just as his enemies leaped in for the kill and as Hugh was preparing to die, the English gave out a great shout in triumph. Hugh&#x27;s horse immediately shied in fear and bolted in the opposite direction and carried its helpless master away from the English and back to the safety of his own lines. This depiction is attributed to Wace, writing a hundred years after the battle, with Hugh as &quot;a vassal from Grente-mesnil&quot;.

==Leicester==

Hugh had become one of William the Conqueror&#x27;s main men in England. In 1067 he joined with William FitzOsbern, 1st Earl of Hereford and Bishop Odo of Bayeux in the government of England, during the king&#x27;s absence in Normandy. He also was one of the Norman nobles who interceded with the Conqueror in favour of William&#x27;s son Robert Curthose, and effected a temporary reconciliation.

Following the Conquest William, so far as is known, did not destroy or terrorise Leicester in the same way as he did places further north. By 1086 he had built a castle there with a wooden tower on a mound and an outer bailey. William later handed the castle over to Hugh de Grandmesnil. The Domesday Survey (of 1086) recorded Hugh as owning 190 of the 322 houses in the borough. The king himself owned 39. He also gave De Grandmesnil 100 manors for his service, sixty-five of them in Leicestershire. He was appointed Sheriff of Leicestershire and Governor of Hampshire. According to a historian writing in 1906 Hugh rebuilt the castle in stone and repaired &quot;the rude Saxon church.&quot; He ruled the people of the borough as a despot and abolished many of their ancient rights. Among other things he instituted trial by combat instead of trial by 24 burgesses. He married the beautiful Adeliza, daughter of Ivo, Count of Beaumont-sur-l&#x27;Oise, from whom he gained several manors in Herefordshire, and three more in Warwickshire.
==Death of Adelize==

Adelize, the wife of Hugh de Grandmesnil, died at Rouen in 1087, and was buried in the Chapter House of St. Evroult. They had five sons and as many daughters, namely, Robert, William, Hugh, Ivo de Grandmesnil, and Aubrey; and daughters Adeline, Hawise, Rohais, Matilda, and Agnes.

On the death of William the Conqueror, also in 1087, the Grandmesnils, like most of the Norman barons, were caught up in the civil war raging between his three surviving sons. Now lands in Normandy and England had two different masters, as Robert Curthose became Duke of Normandy and William Rufus became king of England as William II. Royal family squabbles put fortunes at risk if barons took the wrong side, and ultimately this was the fate of the Grandmesnil family which tended to support the fickle Duke of Normandy against the English king, although allegiances changed continually. Duke Robert did not always support his barons&#x27; loyalty, which is illustrated in Hugh&#x27;s later struggles. 

==Old age==
By 1090 Hugh de Grandmesnil was still defending his lands in Normandy. Hugh made a stand along with his friend Richard de Courci at the Castle of Château de Courcy, as Robert de Belesme laid siege to them. Belesme had driven his army into the lands along the river Orne. Other barons had joined the fight. This led to an extended siege at Courcy, Calvados in 1091, of three weeks.

Robert de Belesme did not have enough troops to surround the castle of Courci. He set about building a wooden siege engine, the Belfry, a great tower, that could be rolled up to the castle walls. Every time the Belfry was rolled forward, Grandmesnil sallied from the castle and attacked a different part of the line. Soldiers manning the Belfry were urgently needed elsewhere to beat back Grandmesnil&#x27;s attack. These skirmishes were frequent, savage and bloody. On one occasion William, son of Henry de Ferrers (another Leicestershire landowner, whose family would become Earls of Derby), and William de Rupiere were captured by de Grandmesnil and ransomed for a small fortune. However, Ivo de Grandmesnil, Hugh&#x27;s son, and Richard fitz Gilbert were seized by the attackers. Ivo was later released, but de Clare did not survive Belesme&#x27;s dungeon (Planche).

As the siege continued a deadly ritual was played out. The inhabitants of Courci had built their oven outside the castle&#x27;s fortifications, and it now lay midway between the main gate and the enemy&#x27;s Belfry. The men of Courci therefore, would stand to arms and rush from the castle to surround the oven, so that the baker could work. Here they would defend their bread, as the attackers would attempt to carry it off. This would often lead to a general engagement as each side poured more troops into the fray. On one occasion Grandmesnil&#x27;s charge was so ferocious that De Belesme&#x27;s men were scattered. The men of Courci overran the great siege engine and burned it. However this success was short-lived, as Duke Robert of Normandy took sides with De Belesme. It now looked all over for De Grandmesnil and De Courci. Then William Rufus arrived with a fleet in arms against his brother, and so Duke Robert and De Belesme simply retreated home.

In William avenged Hugh&#x27;s rebellion against him by having Leicester Castle, the church and part of the town destroyed. This is according to Agnes Fielding Johnson. She does not give a date for this but says Hugh made amends and was restored to his position. 

==Hugh&#x27;s death==
In 1098, Hugh de Grandmesnil was again in England, worn out with age and infirmity. Feeling his end approaching, in accordance with the common practice of the period, he took the habit of a monk, and died six days after he had taken to his bed on 22 February 1098 at Leicester. His body, preserved in salt and sewn up in the hide of an ox, was conveyed to the valley of the Ouche in Normandy by two monks. He was laid to rest at the Abbey of St. Evroult, and buried by the Abbot Roger on the south side of the Chapter House, near the tomb of Abbot Mainer.

==Issue==
Hugh&#x27;s eldest son, Robert III de Grandmesnil (d.1126), inherited his Norman lands in the Ouch valley, while Ivo de Grandmesnil became Sheriff of Leicester, and master of Earl Shilton manor.

William&#x27;s uncle Odo and many others, who had rebelled against William Rufus in 1088, felt that the First Crusade was a good way to avoid the English king&#x27;s wrath. On the third day of the siege of Antioch, after a terrible battle on the walls, William Grandmesnil, his brother Aubrey and Ivo of Grandmesnil, banded together with Count Stephen of Blois, father of the future king of England, and several other knights, to let themselves down from the wall on ropes under the cover of darkness. They fled on foot to the coast and the port of St. Simeon where they were transported away by ships. The papacy referred to this retreat as an act of cowardice.

In 1102 Stephen of Blois returned to Jerusalem under a cloud of shame, and died in a battle charge.

Henry I of England had moved swiftly to take the English throne, in Robert Curthose&#x27;s absence. It appears that Ivo de Grandmesnil was influenced by his brother Robert, who held the family lands in Normandy, and joined the faction fighting against Henry of England. War quickly followed.

Duke Robert set sail for England in 1101 and his army caught up with Henry at Alton, on the Winchester road. A peace was quickly negotiated and Robert went back to Normandy with promises of English gold. Unfortunately, this left the Duke&#x27;s supporters high and dry and King Henry, &#x27;a famously unpleasant individual&#x27; took note of his enemies, including the Grandmesnils (Morris).

King Henry bestowed the manors of Barwell, Burbage, Aston, Sketchley and Dadlington on Hugh de Hastings, as he set about getting rid of any baronial opposition. Thus, Ivo, Sheriff of Leicester, found that he was in disgrace at court, and also besieged with lawsuits and delayed judgements by the king. The cronies of the king&#x27;s court treated Ivo contemptuously, and courtiers openly called him &#x27;ropedancer&#x27;, a reference to his escape from Antioch. When he over-reacted to the jibes, Ivo was fined for turbulent conduct at court. To escape his situation, Ivo financed another trip to the Holy Land, where he could regain his honour fighting on crusade.

Ivo approached Robert de Beaumont, Count of Meulan, to procure a reconciliation with the king, and to advance him 500 silver marks for his expedition. For this service the whole of Ivo&#x27;s domains were pledged to Beaumont as a security for fifteen years. Beaumont was also to give the daughter of his brother Henry, Earl of Warwick, in marriage to Ivo&#x27;s son, Baron Hinckley, who was still in his infancy, and to restore to him his father&#x27;s inheritance. This contract was confirmed by oath, and ratified by the King. However Ivo died on his crusade to Jerusalem, and when he did not return Robert de Beaumont broke his oaths and took control of the whole of Leicester. He dispossessed Ivo&#x27;s children, disregarded the marriage, and added all the Grandmesnil estates to his own. By sleight of hand, Earl Shilton manor was now held by Robert de Beaumont, who was created the first Earl of Leicester by the king.

Ivo&#x27;s nephew and heir, Hugh de Grandmesnil, Baron Hinckley, never recovered the honour of Leicester. The eventual heiress, Pernel, daughter of William de Grandmesnil, married Robert de Beaumont, 3rd Earl of Leicester.

Hugh&#x27;s daughter Adeline married Roger d&#x27;Ivry, who was the sworn brother-in-arms of Robert D&#x27;Oyly.

Hugh&#x27;s daughter Rohais married Robert de Courcy, son of Hugh&#x27;s friend Richard de Courcy.

<doc id="353233" wikidata="Q937842" url="?curid=353233" title="The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews">
<text>The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews is one of the oldest golf clubs in the world. It is a private members-only club based in St Andrews in Scotland. It was previously known colloquially as &quot;The R&amp;A&quot;, but in 2004, a new organisation known as The R&amp;A was spun off, assuming the club&#x27;s functions as one of the governing authorities of the game and organiser of tournaments such as The Open Championship. Despite this legal separation, one of the club&#x27;s objectives remains to contribute, through its members, to the governance, championship organisation, and golf development roles now carried out by The R&amp;A.

The club does not own any of the St Andrews Links courses, including the Old Course, which are golf courses owned by the local authority through the St Andrews Links Trust, and open to the general public.

==History==

The organisation was founded in 1754 as the &quot;Society of St Andrews Golfers&quot;, a local golf club playing at St Andrews Links. The club quickly grew in importance. In 1834, King William IV recognized St Andrews as Royal and Ancient and &quot;The Royal Society of St Andrews Golfers&quot; grandly proclaimed it the &quot;Home of Golf&quot;. 

Later it was referred to as &quot;The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews&quot;. In 1897, the Society codified the rules of golf. Gradually over the next 30 years, it was invited to take control of the running of golf tournaments at other courses.

==Golf club==
The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews itself is now simply a golf club although membership is by invitation only. It has 2,400 members from all over the world. Although the clubhouse is situated just behind the first tee of the Old Course, the club does not own any of the St Andrews courses. 

St Andrews Links are public golf courses, and must share the tee times with members of other local clubs, residents and visitors alike. Responsibility for the management of the courses is undertaken by the St Andrews Links Trust, a charitable organisation that owns and runs seven golf courses at St Andrews.

==Membership policy==
The Royal and Ancient Golf Club (but not The R&amp;A) once had a male-only membership policy. In 2012, former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown called on the club to abandon this in favour of a non-discriminatory policy, as did Louise Richardson, the Principal and Vice-Chancellor of the University of St Andrews.

On 18 September 2014, the club voted in favour of admitting female members. In February 2015 the club&#x27;s first female honorary members were announced – Anne, Princess Royal; Laura Davies; Renee Powell; Belle Robertson; Lally Segard; Annika Sörenstam; and Louise Suggs. At that time the club also announced, &quot;In addition to the honorary members, a number of women have been admitted as members of the club with more set to follow in the coming months.&quot; Also in 2015, Lady Bonallack became the first woman to take part in a match as a member of the club; specifically, she was the first woman to play in the club&#x27;s annual match against the Links Trust.

==Championships==
Until 2004, when the R&amp;A took over responsibility from the Royal and Ancient Golf Club, the club had organised 21 championships and international matches including:

*The Open Championship: one of the four major championships in men&#x27;s golf.
*The Amateur Championship: which was one of the four major championships before the professional game became dominant and is still one of the most prestigious amateur tournaments in the world.
*Boys Amateur Championship: for boys under the age of 18 at midnight on 1 January of the relevant year.
*Boys Home Internationals: a team competition for boys from England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland, with the Irish team selected on an All-Ireland basis.
*Coronation Foursomes: a team competition for women&#x27;s club golfers in Great Britain &amp; Ireland, open to any (female) member of an affiliated golf club with an official handicap of 36 or under.
*Seniors Open Amateur Championship: for male amateurs aged 55 or over on the first day of competition.
*Senior Open Championship: for men aged 50 and above. A major championship on PGA Tour Champions and the European Senior Tour.
*Walker Cup: a biennial men&#x27;s amateur team competition contested by Great Britain &amp; Ireland and the United States (co-organised with the United States Golf Association).
*Curtis Cup: a biennial women&#x27;s amateur team competition contested by Great Britain &amp; Ireland and the United States (also co-organised with the United States Golf Association).
*Junior Open Championship: for boys and girls under the age of 16 at 00.00 hours on 1 January of the relevant year.
*St Andrews Trophy: a biennial men&#x27;s amateur team competition contested by Great Britain &amp; Ireland and the Continent of Europe.
*Vagliano Trophy: a biennial women&#x27;s amateur team competition contested by Great Britain &amp; Ireland and the Continent of Europe.
*Jacques Léglise Trophy: an annual boys&#x27; amateur team competition contested by Great Britain &amp; Ireland and the Continent of Europe. In years when the St Andrews Trophy is held, the Léglise Trophy is held in conjunction with it at the same venue.

<text>Złocieniec (; ) is a town in northwestern Poland. Located in West Pomeranian Voivodeship&#x27;s Drawsko County since 1999, it was previously a part of Koszalin Voivodeship (1950–1998). The population of Złocieniec is around 12,000 - it is therefore the biggest town in the county (powiat).

==History==
The official town webpage states that between the 7th and 6th century BC the area of the town was the site of a village and that the area of Western Pomerania was settled by Slavs in the 6th-8th centuries. The area was part of Poland during the reign of the first Polish rulers Mieszko I and Bolesław I the Brave. In the 13th century it was the northernmost area of the Duchy of Greater Poland, a province of fragmented Poland. When the town rights were granted it&#x27;s highly probable that among German inhabitants of the town were also Slavs from Budów and Strzebłów-villages that were disbanded. Town rights were granted by the brothers von Wedel on 13 December 1333. From 1373 Złocieniec was one of the northernmost towns of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown (or &quot;Czech Lands&quot;), ruled by the Luxembourg dynasty. In 1402, the Luxembourgs reached an agreement with Poland in Kraków. Poland was to buy and re-incorporate Złocieniec and its surroundings, but eventually the Luxembourgs sold the city to the Teutonic Order. During the Polish–Teutonic War (1431–35) Złocieniec rebelled against the Order to join Poland and recognized the Polish King as rightful ruler, but after the Peace of Brześć Kujawski, the town, after receiving a guarantee of impunity for siding with Poland, returned to the rule of the Teutonic Knights, although, as it turned out, for a short time - only until 1454.

In 1668 the town was almost completely destroyed by a fire. In the 18th century it became part of Prussia and subsequently it was part of Germany from 1871 to 1945. During the era of Nazi Germany the Ordensburg Krössinsee was built near the town in 1934. The SA attacked the Jewish population here during Kristallnacht, later, during the Second World War a forced labour camp was established near the town, from which 31 Poles managed to escape. During World War II, in view of the inevitable defeat of Nazi Germany, on March 2, 1945, the evacuation of people who were unable to fight was ordered. On March 5, the town was captured by the First Polish Army. After World War II the town was handed over to Poland by the Allies per the Potsdam Conference, with Poles being transferred from the East while remaining Germans were expelled to the west. On May 13, 1945 the first transport of Poles expelled from former Eastern Poland, annexed by the Soviet Union, arrived to Złocieniec from the Baranowicze region.

<text>Darłowo ( ; ; ), is a seaside town in the West Pomeranian Region, at the south coast of the Baltic Sea, north-western Poland, with 13,324 inhabitants as of December 2021. It is located in Sławno County in West Pomeranian Voivodeship on the Slovincian Coast.

The earliest archaeological signs of a settlement in the area occurred when Roman merchants travelled along the Amber Road in the hope of trading precious metals like bronze and silver for amber. By the 11th century the location of the later town was already becoming a significant trading point. The settlement received its town rights in 1312. Over the years Dukes of Pomerania constructed a Ducal Castle called Dirlow on a nearby island and chose it as their seat.

It was here that the largest artillery piece in the world, Schwerer Gustav, was constructed and tested by Nazi Germany during World War II.

The original medieval outline of Darłowo has been preserved to this day. The Old Town, Ducal Castle and local beaches are popular among holidaymakers. Darłowo is also an important historical centre as it is the birthplace and burial site of Eric of Pomerania, King of Denmark, Sweden and Norway.

==History==
After the last Ice-age had ended at about 8000 BC, settlers of the Stone Age first populated the region.
Around 100 AD the region of the later town was inhabited by the East Germanic tribe of the Rugii. According to Ptolemy at the site of the later city was a settlement called Rugium.
===Middle Ages===
In the 10th century, the region became part of the emerging country of Poland under its first ruler Mieszko I. By the eleventh century a fortress named Dirlow, (or Dirlovo) existed where the River Wieprza entered the Baltic. From this fortress, the district of Dirlow was administered, which belonged to the castellany of Sławno. A town was later founded in the district of Dirlow, but not at the location of the fortress itself. Following Poland&#x27;s fragmentation, it was at various times part of the western and eastern duchies of Pomerania.

The town was probably founded in 1270 by Vitslav II of the Danish Principality of Rügen, at that time also ruler of the Lands of Sławno and Słupsk. The first mention of the town is in a document of 5 February 1271. The settlement decayed.

The town was destroyed in 1283 during a conflict between Vitslav II and Mestwin II (Polish: Mszczuj or Mściwój). In a chronicle of 1652, Matthäus Merian stated that the town had been destroyed by Bogislaw of Pomerania, when after Mestwin&#x27;s II death in December 1294 the Duke Przemysł II (future king) of Poland acquired the town, as a consequence of Treaty of Kępno.

In 1308, the town along with the coastal region of Poland was invaded and occupied by Brandenburg. The town was rebuilt and on 21 May 1312, it was granted Lübeck law under the administration of the noble brothers John, Peter, and Lawrence of the Swienca family, vassals of the Brandenburg margraves since 1308. The Brandenburg margraves undertook in 1308 a campaign against Gdańsk, Poland.

The town passed to the Duchy of Pomerania in 1347, at that time ruled by the brothers Bogislaw V, Wartislaw V, and Barnim IV of the House of Pomerania dynasty. Bogislaw, son-in-law of king Casimir III of Poland, would become ruler of the area after the partition of Pomerania-Wolgast in 1368. This part duchy was known as Pomerania-Stolp (&quot;Duchy of Słupsk&quot;). Duke Bogislaw VIII, a Polish vassal, tried to direct Polish Baltic trade to the Port of Darłowo, but without success.

===Transition to modern times===

In 1352 the construction of the castle began, and co-operation with the Hanseatic League was initiated, with the town becoming a full member of the organization in 1412. The town had its own trade fleet, larger than in other surrounding towns; it actively traded with Lübeck, while boats and ships owned by local merchants travelled as far as Normandy and Spain. In 1382 Eric of Pomerania, later the king of Norway, Denmark and Sweden, was born in the town. After losing his thrones, he returned to his birthplace and began to expand his duchy. After his death in 1459, he was buried in St. Mary&#x27;s Church. After Eric&#x27;s death, the town was ruled by Duke Eric II of Pomerania-Wolgast.

Another significant ruler was Bogislaw X (1454–1523) under whose administration sea trade with the Hanseatic League and land trade with Poland grew increasing the prosperity of the area.

The town suffered a series of natural disasters. In 1497 and 1552 the harbour of the town, known in German as &quot;Rügenwaldermünde&quot;, and parts of the town were hit by great storms. Ships which broke from their moorings were seen drifting in the vicinity of the town and of the neighbouring village of Suckow. In 1589, 1624, 1648, 1679 and 1722 fires damaged the town.

From 1569 to 1622, it was the capital of a small eponymous duchy, and afterwards it was again part of the Duchy of Pomerania. After the death of the last Pomeranian Duke Bogislaw XIV in 1637, the end of the contemporary Thirty Years&#x27; War in 1648 and the subsequent partition of the Duchy of Pomerania between the Swedish Empire and Brandenburg-Prussia in the Peace of Westphalia and the Treaty of Stettin (1653), Brandenburg included Farther Pomerania with Rügenwalde in her Pomeranian province. Following the annexation by Brandenburg the town entered a period of economic stagnation. The harbour of Rügenwaldermünde was destroyed during the Thirty Years&#x27; War by imperial troops, and was reconstructed by order of King Frederick II of Prussia not before 1772. The first lighthouse was built around the year 1715.

===19th and 20th centuries===

During the Napoleonic Wars some of Rügenwalde&#x27;s inhabitants, in particular ship owners and businessmen, profited from smuggling British goods to the continent. In 1871 the town, along with Prussia, became a part of the German Empire. A railway reached the town in 1878, providing connections with Danzig (Gdańsk) and Stettin (Szczecin). It simultaneously became a popular health resort, mainly due to the exceptional climate. The Royal Swedish Vice Consulate was located in the town in 1859–1901 (Vice Consul Bertold August Riensberg, b. 1823) and in 1914–1936 (Vice Consul Albert Rubensohn, b. 1879).

In 1935 the German Army &quot;&quot;, designed for testing heavy guns, including long-range railway guns such as Krupp K5, was built between Rügenwalde&#x27;s harbour Rügenwaldermünde and the village of Suckow. Some of the largest guns in military history were tested here: Schwerer Gustav and Mörser Karl. Gun barrels with a length of up to were tested. For long-distance tests, target areas within the Baltic Sea North of Großmöllendorf and Henkenhagen (about away from Rügenwaldermünde) and North of Dievenow and Swinemünde ( away) were used. The test site was visited by high-ranking officers of the German Army, Air Force and Navy, including Admiral of the Fleet Erich Raeder and field marshals von Rundstedt, Wilhelm Keitel and Hermann Göring.

During World War II, the Germans operated a forced labour subcamp of the Stalag II-B prisoner-of-war camp for Allied POWs in the town.

===After the end of World War II===

During World War II Rügenwalde was used to house families made homeless after the Allied bombing of Hagen and Bochum in the Ruhr district.
Shortly before the end of World War II, numerous German refugees from the provinces of East Prussia and Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia arrived in the region. In early 1945, about 5,600 people escaped by ships of Operation Hannibal before Soviet Troops reached the town on 7 March 1945. About 3,500 citizens remained in the town or returned again after failing to escape.

Following the defeat of Nazi Germany, border changes promulgated at the Potsdam Conference assigned the town once again to Poland, and its German population was expelled. The first expulsion of the surviving German inhabitants took place on 17 October 1945, followed by a series of further expulsions beginning on 17 August 1946. In 1949 only about 70 Germans were left in the town. In 1946–47, the town was repopulated with Poles and Lemkos, who partly came from what had been eastern Poland but was annexed by the Soviet Union. The town was given the Polish name Dyrłów, and later Darłów, before changing to the current name.

The German name &quot;Rügenwalde&quot; was best known in Germany for the production of the Rügenwalder Teewurst in the town; after World War II the production was restarted in West Germany under the old name.

From 1950 to 1998, it was administratively located in the Koszalin Voivodeship.

Today the Polish Darłowo is a summer resort. A coast aquapark with desalinated seawater is available there, the only one in Poland.

==Main sights==

The entire Old Town area in Darłowo has been entirely preserved. Darłowo has maintained the unique medieval urban planning with the main square in the middle of the town. During medieval times the town was surrounded by walls and had four gates; only one gate, &quot;Brama Wysoka&quot; (High Gate), has survived in a fairly original shape.

===Castle of Pomeranian Dukes===

Although documents directly relating to the construction of the castle in Darłowo have not been found yet, the results of archaeological and architectural and historical premises allow us to date back the creation of the castle to the second half of the fourteenth century. It was during the reign of the prince of the House of Griffins, Boguslaw V and Elizabeth, the daughter of King Casimir the Great. The prince purchased the island with a mill in 1352 from a rich burgher of Darłowo – Elizabeth von Behr – in order to build a fortress on it. Over the decades, a castle had grown on the island, which in its main outlines has survived to this day. The work of Boguslaw V was at that time so representative that so that as early as in 1372 a congress of the Pomeranian princes – brothers and cousins Boguslaw took place within its walls. The first sovereign, who modernised the defence system and extended the castle was Prince Eric the Pomeranian. It took place in the years 1449 to 1459, when after the loss of the throne of Scandinavia, the dethroned king returned to his legacy.

An old king was accompanied by a beautiful and young servant-maid Cecilia, who was the love of his life. Historians still argue about who this mysterious woman really was. Some of them maintain that in the last years of his life, reaching his seventies – she became his wife. One of the contemporary chronicles mention her as &quot;the queen Cecilia&quot;.
Shrouded in mystery, the history of the great love of King Eric and Cecilia became an inspiration for artists. The poem &quot;The Return of the Prince Eric&quot; was created by a poet and writer of Koszalin – Czeslaw Zea, and an American journalist and writer Lucie Lehmann – Barclay has been penetrating the archives of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Germany and the UK for several years in search of traces of Cecilia and Eric. The aim of the writer is to create a love novel of this unique pair based on historical facts.
The initial appearance of a medieval fortress of Darłowo was an inspiration to build a similar but larger Kronborg Castle by King Erik in Denmark, where after years, William Shakespeare placed the action of &quot;Hamlet&quot;.

The castle of Darłowo is also associated with the figure of Eric Pomerania&#x27;s granddaughter – Princess Sophia. Legend attributes to her, apparently contrary to the historical facts, cruelty, for which she lingers as the White Lady after her death, circling the castle. The character of Princess Sophia is also related to a romantic love story. The lady of the Darłowo castle was to bestow John of Maszewo with great reciprocating feeling. His Gothic tenement still stands today on the corner of the streets of Powstańców Warszawskich and Morska. Supposedly, the ducal castle was connected with the house of the knight with a secret underground passage, which the knight used at night to sneak into his Lady&#x27;s...
The historical novel based on the life of Princess Sophia, entitled &quot;Beautiful Princess&quot;, was written by a writer Zbysław Gorecki living in Darłowo for many years. In the Prussian times, the castle served partly as a warehouse and fell into ruin. Only at the end of the 1930s, a regional museum was created there and it is operating. Its founder and first curator was Karl Rosenow.

Today the castle serves as a Polish Museum. The castle is built in gothic style on a base plan resembling a square; its tower is high. This is the only castle of such characteristic on the Polish seacoast.

The peculiarity of Darłowo museum is a two-headed calf, which was probably born in the village Janiewice, district of Sławno in 1919. Another interesting feature of the castle is a cat mummy and a golden sculpture of a dove – a talisman of luck for King Eric and Cecilia. Since the autumn of 2010, a statue of King Eric, showing the &quot;king of exile&quot; has been standing in the courtyard, funded by the Baltic Cooperative Bank in Darłowo.

===Medieval churches===

The main landmark church of Darłowo is the Gothic Our Lady of Częstochowa Church from the 14th century, which contains rich Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque interior and furnishings. It is the burial site of Eric of Pomerania, King of Denmark, Norway and Sweden.

The St. Gertrude&#x27;s Church is a Gothic church dating back to the 15th century. It is Poland&#x27;s only church built in Scandinavian-style Gothic. In connection with the history of the church, a traditional annual procession takes place in Darłowo in September. The church organs serve both worshipers and Polish and international virtuosos during the annual summer organ festivals organised by the Koszalin Philharmonic.

The smallest of the surviving medieval churches in Darłowo is brick, plastered, one-nave church of St. George from the 15th century. This type of hospital churches were built outside the city walls because of the spread of epidemics such as smallpox and leprosy. Two hospitals belonged to this church: the Holy Spirit, where there were the poor and the sick, and the Holy Jurgen, primarily serving the lepers. In 1680 and beyond, the church was surrounded by 30 clay huts, covered with reeds, where the sick and the senility lived. Around the huts, there were small vegetable gardens. People who lived in the huts, often cleaned Darłowo market, or worked as gravediggers and pallbearer. In the late nineteenth century, red-brick hospital in neo-Gothic style was built next to the church. Today it is a residential building.

===The Town Hall===

The old City Hall (&quot;Ratusz&quot;), which stood in the centre of the market, burned down during the great fire in 1722. Then, the municipal government moved to &quot;Cloth Hall&quot; of Darłowo – completely rebuilt halls, located near St. Mary&#x27;s Church, which since 1725 years has been officially the town hall venue. The interior is non-historical. It is worth to notice the Renaissance portal remaining after the previous town hall, which is located above the door. Coat of arms of the city – a griffin with a tail of a fish – and an inscription in Latin, which in translation reads: &quot;The city was founded in the 12th (the last two digits of the date has not been included because they were then known), the AD, was enlarged in 1312. Three times burned: 1589, 1624, 1648. as many times risen from the ashes. Kind to God and the prince, be always fortunate. Grow and flourish. May God make you happy and may Prince protect you for a long time. But the despair, the fire destroyed it again in 1675 and 1722 and the town hall was rebuilt in 1725 and let it be for the last time&quot;.

Dreams of the citizens came true. To this day, the Town Hall is home to the municipal government and the city – untouched – survived the march of the Red Army that won the Western Pomerania in winter of 1945.
===The Fountain – Fisherman Memorial===

It has been located on Darłowo market since 1919. It was made by the sculptor Wilhelm Groß (1883–1974) from Sławno as a monument to honour the people of the sea. The founder of the fountain was the richest Darłowo shipowner – the one from the family of Hemptenmacher, whose house is located at the intersection of ul. Powstańców Warszawskich and ul. Rynkowa. What deserves the attention are four bronze plaques depicting the scenes from the life of the former inhabitants of Darłowo. The board from the side of the Town Hall presents a knight pointing an area where the city was founded. Beside him, there is a scribe and workers digging a ditch, having to circle the fortified castle. From the north, the artist presented the longshoremen working on the loading ship. On the eastern plate, there is koga floating on the waves of the Hanseatic. On the final relief, facing the south, it is shown how a shepherd is guarding a flock of sheep and a woman herding geese.
Goose meat, especially liver were the best export product of the former Darłowo.

===High Gate===

The High Gate (&quot;Brama Wysoka&quot;) is one of the three city gates and the only one that survived until today. The residue of the old city fortifications that surrounded the city with a 1500-meter long wall. It was rebuilt in 1732. It is placed on a square, four-pointed arch crossing, covered with a hipped roof, decorated with pointed-arch blinds. Inside, there are still preserved bullet holes.

===Lighthouse===
Easternmost lighthouse that belongs to the West Coast is the lighthouse in Darłówko, built at the base of the eastern breakwater at the mouth Wieprza flowing into the Baltic Sea. The first mention of Darłowo lighthouse comes from 1715, when the city authorities ordered to set lights on both sides of the mouth of Wieprza.

It is known that it was only in 1885 when a small pilot ship station was built at the base of the eastern breakwater ground floor. It was a relatively tall red brick building, which adjoins a tower built in the square. At the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth century, the lighthouse underwent several upgrades. The lamp lenses were replaced and the power and colour of the light source were increased. In 1927, the tower was raised by one floor. The building is crowned with a white steel dome, where the light source was moved. Since then, the appearance of the whole building to the present day has undergone only cosmetic changes.

Today, the height of the tower is , and the range of light pointing the way to the port is nearly . The lighthouse is open for tourists in summer.

The lighthouse of Darłowo is the only lighthouse in Poland built on a rectangular plan.

==Demographics==
Since the medieval Christianization of the region, the population of the town was Catholic. After the Reformation, the vast majority of the town&#x27;s population was composed of Protestants. Since the end of World War II the population of Darłowo has been Polish-speaking and either Roman Catholic or non-religious.

<text>Świdwin (; ) is a town in West Pomeranian Voivodeship of northwestern Poland. It is the capital of Świdwin County, and the administrative seat - though not part - of the Gmina Świdwin. Świdwin is situated in the historic Pomerania region on the left banks of the Rega river, about east of the regional capital Szczecin and south of the Baltic coast at Kołobrzeg. In 2018 the town had a population of 15,725.

==History==

The area became part of the emerging Polish state under its first historic ruler Mieszko I around 967. In the 12th century there was a gród on the trade route from the coastal city of Kołobrzeg to Greater Poland. Following the fragmentation of Poland, it formed part of the Duchy of Pomerania. Duke Barnim I granted the settlement to the Premonstratensians from Trzebiatów. In 1248 the duke ceded the area to the Bishop of Kamień, who shortly afterwards sold it to the Ascanian margraves of Brandenburg. Schivelbein was incorporated as the northeastern outpost of the Neumark region. It was granted town rights by 1296. From 1373 it was part of the Lands of the Bohemian (Czech) Crown as one of its northernmost towns, in 1384 it was passed to the State of the Teutonic Order, and in 1455 to Brandenburg, which possession it remained until the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806. In the 15th century there were disputes with the nearby town of Białogard, and in 1469 even a battle was fought between the towns. Nowadays, an annual medieval-style competition is organized between the inhabitants of both towns. In 1477 a Carthusian monastery was established, which was secularized in 1539. Brewing developed at that time. In 1550, around 30% of the population died in an epidemic. In the 17th century the town suffered as a result of two fires and the Thirty Years&#x27; War. In 1816 it became part of the Prussian province of Pomerania.

The &quot;Battle of Świdwin&quot; took place south of the town during 6–7 March 1945, in which a German SS corps was encircled and destroyed by two Soviet and one Polish armies. After the town was captured, a Soviet general was killed by a member of the Hitler Youth. The reprisals that followed saw the men shot, and the women and girls raped by Soviet troops.

After World War II Farther Pomerania with Schivelbein became part of Poland under h a Soviet-installed communist regime, which stayed in power until the Fall of Communism in the 1980s. The town&#x27;s name was name changed to Świbowina, which was officially renamed to Świdwin in 1946.

The town&#x27;s populace that had stayed or had fled and returned was expelled in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. Until at least 1947, the Polish operated an internment camp in the town. which became overcrowded. In February 1947, the British administration in occupied Germany refused to accept refugees so that the camp became completely overcrowded. Many Germans died at the dire conditions.

The town&#x27;s first post-war mayor was Jan Górski, and Polish schools, institutions and factories were established, however war damage was not removed until the 1950s. From 1950 to 1998, it was administratively located in the Koszalin Voivodeship.

<text>Białogard (; ; Pomeranian: &quot;Biôłogard&quot;) is a historic town in Middle Pomerania, northwestern Poland, with 23,614 inhabitants as of December 2021. The capital of Białogard County in the West Pomeranian Voivodeship. It is the most important railroad junction of Middle Pomerania, which links Kołobrzeg with Piła and Gdańsk with Stargard.

==History==
According to archaeologists the Białogard stronghold was built in the fork of the Parsęta and Leśnica Rivers as early as the 8th century. In the 10th century it was an important centre of long-range international trade at the crossroads of two important trade routes: a north–south &quot;salt route&quot; from Kołobrzeg to Poznań and Greater Poland, and the west-east Pomeranian route from Szczecin to Gdańsk.

Pomerania was inhabited by several tribes collectively known as Pomeranians, and Białogard was probably the centre of one of them. In the 10th century Pomerania was conquered by Polish duke Mieszko I and included within the emerging Polish state. His son, Duke Bolesław the Brave established a bishopric in nearby Kołobrzeg in 1000, and introduced Christianity.

Białogard is first mentioned in the chronicle of Gallus Anonymous as a rich and populous stronghold in the middle of Pomerania, a famous royal city called white (&quot;Alba Regia&quot;). This city was conquered by Boleslaus III of Poland in 1107. By the invitation of Bolesław III the Wrymouth and his vassal Wartisław I of Pomerania, Bishop Otto of Bamberg came with a mission to Pomerania in 1124; Białogard was one of the places he visited. In the 12th century Białogard was a seat of a regional governor (castellan).

Kashubia was the name of the region around this town. The town developed quickly as one of the more important economic centres of the Duchy of Pomerania, and this was strengthened by the Lübeck law granted to the city by Duke Bogusław IV in 1299. In 1307 the city was granted staple rights. In 1386 it became a member of the Hanseatic League. In the 15th century there were disputes with the nearby town of Świdwin, and in 1469 even a battle was fought between the towns. On the 500-year anniversary of the battle, on the initiative of Polish writer and publisher , in post-World War II Poland, a medieval-style competition was organized between the inhabitants of both towns. As a local tradition, these competitions have been organized annually since. As a result of the feudal fragmentation of Pomerania, Białogard was part of Pomerania-Wolgast from 1295 and Pomerania-Stolp (Duchy of Słupsk), a vassal state of the Polish Crown, from 1368. Duke Wartislaw IV chose the town as his main place of residence in 1315. Pomerania was united under Duke Bogislaw X in 1478, after 1569 the town was part of the Pomerania-Stettin, and later was again in the united Duchy of Pomerania under Bogislaw XIV, the last Pomeranian duke.

Crafts and trade flourished. In 1534 a bakers&#x27; guild was founded, in 1580 also woodcarvers&#x27; and clothiers&#x27; guilds were established. Following the Protestant Reformation, the town became Protestant in 1534. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War the town was plundered by the troops of the Holy Roman Empire and Sweden. After the death of the last Pomeranian Duke in 1637, and as a result of the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the Duchy of Pomerania was divided between Sweden and Brandenburg-Prussia. As Belgard, with all of Farther Pomerania, the town became part of Brandenburg in 1653 and became part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701. In 1724 Belgard was made the capital of a county in the Province of Pomerania, and after the administrative reorganization in 1815, the capital of &quot;Landkreis Belgard&quot; (Belgard county).

The first post office in Belgard was opened in 1825. In 1858 the first railroad connecting Belgard to Köslin (Koszalin) and Schivelbein (Świdwin) was completed; it was extended to Stargard and Neustettin (Szczecinek) in 1878. Belgard became part of the German Empire in 1871.

During World War II, a forced labour subcamp of the Nazi prison in Koszalin was operated by the Germans in the town. In February 1945, German-perpetrated death marches of Allied prisoners of war from the Stalag Luft IV and Stalag XX-B prisoner-of-war camps passed through the town. In the final weeks of the war, the Red Army occupied the town on March 4, 1945. According to the terms of the Potsdam Conference, after the war the town became part of Poland.

Białogard was made a county city in the Szczecin Voivodeship, was later assigned to the Koszalin Voivodeship, and is now located in the West Pomeranian Voivodeship. In 1999 the 700th anniversary of receiving town rights was celebrated with the participation of Polish President Aleksander Kwaśniewski, who was born in Białogard.

==Demographics==

Since the medieval Christianization of the area, the majority of the population was composed of Catholics. After the Reformation, the town&#x27;s inhabitants were predominantly Protestant, particularly Lutheran. Since the end of the war the majority of the town&#x27;s population is composed of Catholics, though a significant Lutheran minority remains.

<text>Szczecinek (; ) is a historic city in Middle Pomerania, northwestern Poland, capital of Szczecinek County in the West Pomeranian Voivodeship, with a population of more than 40,000 (2011). It is an important railroad junction, located along the main Poznań - Kołobrzeg line, which crosses less important lines to Chojnice and Słupsk. The town&#x27;s total area is .

The turbulent history of Szczecinek reaches back to the High Middle Ages, when the area was ruled by Pomeranian dukes and princes. The majority of the city&#x27;s architecture survived World War II and, subsequently, its entire Old Town was proclaimed a national heritage monument of Poland.

== Location ==
Szczecinek lies in eastern part of West Pomeranian Voivodeship. Historically, it was included within Western Pomerania. In 2010, the city boundaries were expanded as the town merged with the following villages in Gmina Szczecinek: Gałowo, Marcelin, Godzimierz, Turowo, Parsęcko, Buczek and Żółtnica.
== History and etymology ==
===Middle Ages===

In the Middle Ages a Slavic stronghold existed in present-day Szczecinek. It was part of the early Polish state in the 10th century, and as a result of the 12th-century fragmentation of Poland, it became part of the separate Duchy of Pomerania.

In 1310, the castle at the site of a former stronghold, and town were founded under Lübeck law by Duke Wartislaw IV of Pomerania and modelled after Szczecin () which is situated about to the west. The initial name was &quot;Neustettin&quot; (, , ). It was also known as &quot;Klein Stettin&quot; (, ). In 1707 the town was known in Polish as &quot;Nowoszczecin&quot;, while the &quot;Mały Szczecin&quot; name gradually developed into the modern name &quot;Szczecinek&quot;.

The town was fortified to face the Brandenburgers, with a wall and palisades. In 1356 it was hit by the plague. Thankful for their survival, the Dukes Bogislaw V, Barnim IV and Wartislaw V founded the Augustine monastery Marientron, on the hill on the southern bank of the Lake. It was plundered by Brandenburgers in 1470. From 1368 to 1390 it was the seat of an eponymous duchy under its only historic ruler Wartislaw V. Afterwards, it was ruled by Pomeranian duchies: Darłowo (Rügenwalde) (until 1418), Słupsk (until 1474, fief of Poland) and the united Duchy of Pomerania (until 1618).

On 15 September 1423, the &quot;great day of Neustettin&quot;, the Pomeranian dukes, the Grand Master of the Teutonic Order and Nordic king Eric VII of Denmark, Norway and Sweden met to discuss defense against the union of Brandenburg and Poland. During the Thirteen Years&#x27; War, local dukes changed alliances several times. As a result, in 1455 several surrounding villages were looted by Teutonic Knights and in 1461 the town was sacked, looted and burned by Polish troops and Tatars because King Casimir IV Jagiellon wanted to take revenge on Eric II of Pomerania who supported the Teutonic Knights.

===Modern period===

In 1601 a Polish school was established, and in 1640 a gymnasium was founded, which as today&#x27;s &quot;I Liceum Ogólnokształcące&quot; is one of the oldest high schools in Pomerania. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War it was captured and plundered by the Swedes and Austrians. After the war, from 1653, the town was part of Brandenburg, from 1701 of Prussia and from 1871 to 1945 of Germany. During the Seven Years&#x27; War, in 1759 it was plundered by the Russians. In 1807, during the Napoleonic Wars and Polish national liberation fights, the town was captured by Poles led by Tomasz Łubieński.

In 1881 Abraham Springer, great-grandfather of TV presenter Jerry Springer and a prominent member of the town&#x27;s Jewish community launched an unsuccessful attempt to sue agitator Dr Ernst Henrici, claiming that an inflammatory anti-semitic speech in the town led directly to the burning down of the synagogue on 18 February of that year.

In 1914 the Regional Museum was established. In 1923 the Catholic Church of the Holy Spirit was built, then called the &quot;Polish Church&quot;, as it was co-financed by local Poles.

After the Nazis took power in Germany in the 1930s, new military barracks were built, and the invasion of Poland was carried out from the town at the beginning of World War II in 1939. During the war, three forced labour camps were established and operated by the Germans in the town, and its prisoners were mostly Poles and Russians. In September 1944, the Germans made the first arrests of local members of the Polish underground organization &quot;Odra&quot;, ultimately crushing it in the following weeks. In February 1945, the town was captured by the Red Army, and the local agricultural machinery factory, which used forced labour during the war, was plundered by occupying Russian forces. The town then passed to Poland, although with a Soviet-installed communist regime, which remained in power until the Fall of Communism in the 1980s. The town&#x27;s German population was expelled in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, and it was repopulated with Poles, expellees from former eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union and settlers from central Poland. The plundered agricultural machinery factory was relaunched by Poles in July 1945. The Polish anti-communist resistance (&quot;cursed soldiers&quot;) was active in the town, and many of its members were arrested and sentenced to prison by the communists. The last &quot;cursed soldier&quot; of Szczecinek, Maria Sosnowska, died in 2018.

From 1950 to 1998, it was administratively located in the Koszalin Voivodeship.

In 2009 the town limits were expanded by including the neighbouring villages of Świątki and Trzesieka as new districts.

In 2018, a khachkar was unveiled in Szczecinek to commemorate Armenian-Polish friendship.

<doc id="353253" wikidata="Q717294" url="?curid=353253" title="Krystyna Skarbek">
<text>Maria Krystyna Janina Skarbek, (, ; 1 May 1908 – 15 June 1952), also known as Christine Granville, was a Polish agent of the British Special Operations Executive (SOE) during the Second World War. She became celebrated for her daring exploits in intelligence and irregular-warfare missions in Nazi-occupied Poland and France. Journalist Alistair Horne, who described himself in 2012 as one of the few people still alive who had known Skarbek, called her the &quot;bravest of the brave.&quot; Spymaster Vera Atkins of the SOE described Skarbek as &quot;very brave, very attractive, but a loner and a law unto herself.&quot;

She became a British agent months before the SOE was founded in July 1940. She was the first female agent of the British to serve in the field and the longest-serving of all Britain&#x27;s wartime women agents. Her resourcefulness and success have been credited with influencing the organisation&#x27;s decision to recruit more women as agents in Nazi-occupied countries. In 1941 she began using the alias Christine Granville, a name she legally adopted upon naturalisation as a British subject in December 1946.

Skarbek&#x27;s most famous exploit was securing the release of SOE agents Francis Cammaerts and Xan Fielding from a German prison hours before they were to be executed. She did so by meeting (at great personal risk) with the Gestapo commander in Digne-les-Bains, France, telling him she was a British agent, and persuading him with threats, lies, and a two million franc bribe to release the SOE agents. The event is fictionalised in the last episode of the British television show &quot;Wish Me Luck.&quot;

Skarbek is often characterised in terms such as Britain&#x27;s &quot;most glamorous spy&quot; or &quot;Churchill&#x27;s favourite spy&quot;. She was stabbed to death in 1952 in London by an obsessed and spurned suitor who was subsequently hanged.

==Early life==

Krystyna Skarbek was born in 1908 in Warsaw, the second child of Count Jerzy Skarbek, a Roman Catholic, and Stefania (née Goldfeder), the daughter of a wealthy assimilated Jewish family. Marrying Stefania in late December 1899, Jerzy Skarbek used his wife&#x27;s dowry (her father was a banker) to pay his debts and continue his lavish lifestyle.

Notable relations included Fryderyk Skarbek, prison reformer, and Włodzimierz Krzyżanowski, United States Union general. Skarbek was distantly related to the Hungarian regent, Admiral Miklós Horthy, as a cousin from the Lwów side of the family had married a relative of Horthy.

Krystyna took after her father and his liking for riding horses, which she sat astride rather than side-saddle as was usual for women. She also became an expert skier during visits to Zakopane in the Tatra mountains of southern Poland. At the family stables, she met Andrzej Kowerski, whose father had brought him over to play with ten-year-old Krystyna while he and her father discussed agricultural matters.

The 1920s left the family in straitened financial circumstances, and they had to give up their country estate and move to Warsaw. In 1930, when she was 22, Count Jerzy died. The Goldfeder financial empire had almost completely collapsed, and there was barely enough money to support the widowed Countess Stefania. Krystyna, not wishing to be a burden to her mother, worked at a Fiat car dealership, but soon became ill from automobile fumes and had to give up the job. At first she was thought, on the basis of shadows on her chest x-rays, to be suffering from tuberculosis, which had killed her father. She received compensation from her employer&#x27;s insurance company and took her physicians&#x27; advice to lead as much of an open-air life as she could. She began spending a great deal of time hiking and skiing the Tatra Mountains. In 1930, she was a runner up in the &quot;Miss Poland&quot; beauty contest.

On 21 April 1930, she married a young businessman, Gustaw Gettlich, at the Spiritual Seminary Church in Warsaw. They proved incompatible, and the marriage soon ended without rancour. A subsequent love affair came to naught when the young man&#x27;s mother refused to consider the penniless divorcée as a potential daughter-in-law.

One day, she lost control on a Zakopane ski slope and was saved by Jerzy Giżycki, who stepped into her path and stopped her descent. Giżycki came from a wealthy family in Kamieniec Podolski (formerly Poland, at the time the Soviet Union). At fourteen, he had quarrelled with his father, run away from home, and worked in the United States as a cowboy and gold prospector. He eventually became an author and travelled the world in search of material for his books and articles. He knew Africa well and hoped one day to return there. The two were married on 2 November 1938 at the Evangelical Reformed Church in Warsaw. Soon after, he accepted a diplomatic posting to Ethiopia, where he served as Poland&#x27;s consul general until September 1939, when Germany invaded Poland. She later said of Giżycki: &quot;He was my Svengali for so many years that he would never believe that I could ever leave him for good.&quot;

==World War II==

===London===

Upon the outbreak of World War II, the couple sailed for London, arriving 6 October 1939, where Skarbek sought to offer her services in the struggle against the common enemy. The British authorities showed little interest but were eventually convinced by her acquaintances, including journalist Frederick Augustus Voigt, who introduced her to the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS). The first SIS mention of her was in December 1939. She was described as a &quot;flaming Polish patriot, expert skier, and great adventuress&quot; and &quot;absolutely fearless&quot;.

===Hungary and Poland===
From London Skarbek, now a British agent, journeyed to Budapest, Hungary, arriving on 21 December 1939. Hungary was not yet a participant in World War II, but was leaning toward Nazi Germany. Skarbek&#x27;s cover story for her presence in Hungary was that she was a journalist.

She persuaded Polish Olympic skier Jan Marusarz, brother of Nordic skier Stanisław Marusarz, to escort her across the snow-covered Tatra Mountains into Nazi-occupied Poland. Arriving in Warsaw, she pleaded vainly with her mother to leave Poland. Stefania Skarbek refused; she was determined to stay in Warsaw to continue teaching French to small children. In January 1942, Stefania was arrested by the Germans as a Jew and disappeared into Warsaw&#x27;s Pawiak prison. The prison had been designed in the mid-19th century by Skarbek&#x27;s great-great-uncle Fryderyk Skarbek, a prison reformer and Frédéric Chopin&#x27;s godfather, who had been tutored in the French language by Chopin&#x27;s father.

An incident that probably dates to Skarbek&#x27;s first visit back to Poland in February 1940 illustrates the hazards she faced while working in her occupied homeland. At a Warsaw café, she was hailed by a woman acquaintance: &quot;Krystyna! Krystyna Skarbek! What are you doing here? We heard that you&#x27;d gone abroad!&quot; When Skarbek denied that was her name, the woman found her denial hard to believe. To minimise suspicion, Skarbek tarried a while before leaving the café.

In Hungary, Skarbek encountered Andrzej Kowerski (1912–1988), now a Polish army officer, who later used the British &quot;nom de guerre&quot; &quot;Andrew Kennedy&quot;. Skarbek had first met him as a child and briefly encountered him again before the war at Zakopane. Kowerski, who had lost part of his leg in a pre-war hunting accident, was now exfiltrating Polish and other Allied military personnel and collecting intelligence.

Skarbek helped organise a system of Polish couriers who brought intelligence reports from Warsaw to Budapest. Kowerski (Kennedy)&#x27;s cousin, Ludwik Popiel, managed to smuggle out a unique Polish anti-tank rifle, model 35, with the stock and barrel sawn off for easier transport. Skarbek, for a time, concealed it in her Budapest apartment. However, it never saw wartime service with the Allies, as the designs and specifications had deliberately been destroyed upon the outbreak of war and there was no time for reverse engineering. Captured stocks of the rifle were, however, used by the Germans and the Italians.

At the request of MI6, she and Kowerski organised surveillance of all the rail, road and river traffic on the borders with Romania and Germany. She is credited with providing intelligence on oil transports to Germany from Romania&#x27;s Ploiesti oilfields.

Skarbek spent 1940 travelling back and forth between Poland and Hungary. In Budapest, in January 1941, she showed her penchant for stratagem when she and Kowerski were arrested by the Hungarian police and imprisoned and questioned by the Gestapo. She feigned symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis by biting her tongue until it bled and a doctor diagnosed her incorrectly with terminal tuberculosis. The Germans released them, but the couple was followed by the police afterwards and they decided to flee Hungary, a German ally.

===Car journey===
The British Ambassador in Hungary, Owen O&#x27;Malley, and his wife, the novelist Ann Bridge, undertook to help Skarbek and Kowerski escape Hungary. O&#x27;Malley issued British passports to them. Kowerski became &quot;Anthony Kennedy&quot;, and Skarbek became &quot;Christine Granville&quot;, a name she used for the rest of her life. She also shaved seven years off her age; her passport gave her birth date as 1915. A British Embassy driver smuggled Skarbek out of Hungary and into Yugoslavia in the trunk of O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s Chrysler. Kowerski, a.k.a. Kennedy, drove his Opel across the border. The couple reunited in Yugoslavia and O&#x27;Malley joined them later in Belgrade, where they enjoyed a few days of &quot;drinking champagne in ... nightclubs and belly-dancing bars&quot;. In late February, Skarbek and Kowerski continued their journey in the Opel, first to Sofia, Bulgaria. Sofia&#x27;s best hotel &quot;was full of Nazis&quot;. Skarbek and Kowerski called at the British Legation, meeting with air attaché Aidan Crawley. The couple gave Crawley rolls of microfilm which they had received from a Polish intelligence organisation called the &quot;Musketeers&quot;. The microfilm contained photos of a German military buildup near the border with the Soviet Union, indicating that a German invasion of the Soviet Union was being planned. The microfilm was sent to Prime Minister Winston Churchill in London, who could scarcely believe it; but by March, with information from other sources, the Prime Minister was persuaded that Skarbek and Kowerski&#x27;s intelligence was accurate. The Germans invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941.

Leaving Bulgaria, Kowerski and Skarbek continued on to Turkey. In Istanbul, they met with exiled Poles, and Skarbek tried to ensure that the courier routes from Istanbul to Poland remained functional. Skarbek&#x27;s husband, Jerzy Giżycki, met them in Istanbul on 17 March 1941. Apparently no fireworks ensued when he met Kowerski, and they persuaded him to go to Budapest to take over Skarbek&#x27;s previous role as the contact point for the British with the Polish resistance. The couple&#x27;s next destinations in the Opel were Syria and Lebanon, which were under the control of Vichy France. Skarbek obtained visas from reluctant Vichy officials and they continued their journey. They then entered Mandatory Palestine and proceeded onward to Cairo, Egypt, arriving in May 1941. Skarbek and Kowerski &quot;had driven fairly blithely across hundreds of miles of Nazi-sympathizing territory, often carrying incriminating letters and sometimes microfilm and just weeks or at times days ahead of the Nazi advance.&quot;

===Cairo===
Upon their arrival at SOE offices in Cairo, Kowerski and Skarbek learned they were under suspicion because of Skarbek&#x27;s contacts with the Polish intelligence organisation, the Musketeers. This group had been formed in October 1939 by engineer-inventor . Another source of suspicion was the ease with which she had obtained transit visas through French-mandated Syria and Lebanon from the pro-Vichy French consul in Istanbul. Only German spies, some Polish intelligence officers believed, could have obtained the visas.

There were also specific suspicions about Kowerski. These were addressed in London by General Colin Gubbinsto be, from September 1943, head of SOEin a letter of 17 June 1941 to Polish Commander-in-Chief and the Prime Minister of Poland Władysław Sikorski:

In June 1941, Peter Wilkinson of SOE came to Cairo and officially dismissed Skarbek and Kowerski, although keeping them on the SOE payroll with a small retainer that forced them to live in near poverty. Kowerski, who was under less suspicion than Skarbek, eventually cleared up any misunderstandings with General Kopański and was able to resume intelligence work.

When Skarbek&#x27;s husband, Jerzy Giżycki, was informed that Skarbek and Kowerski&#x27;s services were being dispensed with, he took umbrage and abruptly bowed out of his own career as a British intelligence agent. When Skarbek told her husband that she loved Kowerski, Giżycki left for London, eventually emigrating to Canada. (The couple were formally divorced at the Polish consulate in Berlin on 1 August 1946.)

A week after the dismissal of Skarbek and Kowerski, on 22 June 1941 Germany began its Operation Barbarossa invasion of the Soviet Union, predicted by the intelligence the couple had passed along to the British from the Musketeers. It is now known that advance information about Operation Barbarossa had also been provided by a number of other sources, including Ultra.

During the remainder of 1941, 1942, and 1943, Skarbek was given several small tasks by SOE, such as intelligence gathering in Syria and Cairo, including passing along information to the British on Polish intelligence and resistance agencies. She turned down offers of office work and continued to be sidelined from the kind of dangerous and difficult work she desired. Both she and Kowerski continued to be under suspicion by the British and resented by the Polish government-in-exile because they worked for Britain.

===Training===
Skarbek&#x27;s route back to active service with SOE began with her joining the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry (FANY), an all-woman charity organisation with military-style uniforms that was used as a cover for many women in the SOE. The SOE officer who recruited her, Patrick Howarth, later said jokingly that &quot;the most useful thing I did in World War II was to reinstate Christine Granville&quot;. Her briefing officer in FANY, Gwendolin Lees, was so impressed by Skarbek (now more commonly known as Granville) that she later named a daughter after her. Despite Skarbek&#x27;s experience in clandestine work, she was given SOE training for prospective agents. She proved to be very bad at wireless transmitting and hated firearms training, but she loved parachuting.

SOE&#x27;s original plan to parachute Skarbek into Hungary was cancelled because the mission was deemed &quot;little short of homicide.&quot; The continued suspicions about her by the Polish government-in-exile precluded a return to Poland. Thus, SOE decided to infiltrate her into southern France. Her French was good and she took a course to improve her English. She moved to Algeria in preparation for a mission to France, but she was not immediately dispatched because SOE believed she was &quot;too flamboyant to work undercover effectively&quot;.

===France===
The SOE had several branches working in France. Though most of the women in France answered to F Section in London, Skarbek&#x27;s mission was launched from Algiers, the base of AMF Section. This section was only set up in the wake of Operation Torch, the Allied landings in North Africa, partly with staff from London (F Section) and partly with staff from Cairo (MO.4). AMF Section served three purposes: it was simpler and safer to run the resupply operations from Allied North Africa than from London, across German-occupied France; the South of France was to be liberated by separate Allied landings there (Operation Dragoon), so SOE units in the area needed be supplied by their headquarters in Algiers, not by London; and AMF Section tapped into the skills of the French living in North Africa. With the two invasions in Normandy and southern France in late spring and summer 1944, these distinctions became irrelevant, and almost all the SOE Sections in France were united with the Maquis into the &quot;Forces Francaises de l&#x27;Interieur&quot; (&quot;FFI&quot;). (There was one exception: The EU/P Section, which was formed by Poles in France and remained part of the trans-European Polish Resistance movement, under Polish command.)

Skarbek, now more commonly known as Christine Granville, parachuted into France on the night of 6/7 July 1944. She became part of the Jockey network headed by Francis Cammaerts, Belgian-British in nationality and a former pacifist. The job of Cammaerts and his team was to organise the French resistance fighters, the maquis, in southeastern France to weaken the German occupiers prior to the Allied invasion of southern France, Operation Dragoon, which would take place on 15 August. Skarbek was Cammaerts&#x27; courier, replacing Cecily Lefort, who had been captured by the Germans and would be executed. She was also given the task of attempting to subvert the Polish conscripts in the German army who were stationed along the Franco-Italian border.

Vercors Plateau. Cammaerts was based in the hamlet of Saint-Julien-en-Vercors on the remote Vercors Plateau. Skarbek arrived in the midst of a large operation headed by British major Desmond Longe of supplying by parachute the local maquis with arms and supplies. She was out every moonlit night organising a reception committee to collect the canisters dropped by Allied aeroplanes on the plateau. On the morning of 14 July came a daylight drop of light arms and supplies from 72 American B-17s, the largest single-day airdrop to the maquis during World War II. Encouraged by a speech from the head of the provisional government, Charles de Gaulle, (but discouraged by Cammaerts who opposed large-scale guerrilla operations and pleaded unsuccessfully for artillery and anti-tank weapons for the maquis), a full-scale rebellion against the German occupiers broke out. The rebellion was premature and quickly crushed by German troops. On 22 July and under fire, Cammaerts and Skarbek escaped from the plateau, setting up a new base at Seyne-les-Alpes.

In the Alps. After the flight from the Vercors, Skarbek embarked on a journey of three weeks through the Alps, mostly on foot (she disliked bicycles). She carried a rucksack filled with food and hand grenades. She made contact with two prominent leaders of the French Resistance, Gilbert Galletti and Paul Hérault (soon to be killed by the Germans), and greeted the arrival of an &quot;Operation Toplink&quot; team which included her friends John Roper, Paddy O&#x27;Regan, and Harvard Gunn. Their job was to organise and supply both the French and Italian resistance along the border. On 13 August, she subverted some of the Polish soldiers among the German units in the Alps. After a two-day hike to the Col de Larche, a prominent mountain pass on the Franco-Italian border, she approached a formidable fortress, manned by 150 soldiers, at the head of the pass. Speaking in Polish and revealing her identity, she talked to the 63 Polish soldiers - &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot;, i.e., Poles who had signed the Nazi &quot;Volksliste&quot; as those whose language and culture had German origins but who did not hold German citizenship - among the defenders, and told them, when the order was given by resistance forces, to desert and destroy the fortress, giving them specific instructions on how that was to be done. Six days later a small force of maquis and two Operation Toplink officers, John Roper and John Halsey, approached the garrison and the German commander surrendered the fortress and his mutinous soldiers. The Poles in the garrison joined the French resistance as Skarbek had told them to do.

Rescuing Cammaerts. On 13 August 1944, at Digne, two days before the Allied Operation Dragoon landings in southern France, Cammaerts, Xan Fieldinganother SOE agent, who had previously operated in Creteand a French officer, Christian Sorensen, were arrested at a roadblock by the Gestapo. Skarbek rushed back from the Col de Larche, halting briefly along the way to meet a recently arrived 10-man allied military mission. She told them that, in Cammaerts&#x27; absence, she was in charge and arranged transportation for them. She also tried without success to persuade French resistance leaders to storm the prison in Digne and rescue Cammaerts and the others. She then put aside her aversion to bicycles, and cycled to Digne.

In Digne on 15 August, Skarbek circled the walls of the prison humming &quot;Frankie and Johnny&quot;, a favourite tune of hers and Cammaerts. He responded in kind, confirming that he was within. Skarbek managed to meet with Captain Albert Schenck, an Alsatian who acted as liaison officer between the local French prefecture and the Gestapo. She introduced herself as Cammaerts&#x27; wife and a niece of British General Bernard Montgomery and threatened Schenck with terrible retribution if harm came to the prisoners. She reinforced the threat with a mercenary appeal – an offer of two million francs for the men&#x27;s release.

Skarbek informed SOE in London and two million francs were air-dropped to her. On 17 August she was back in Schenck&#x27;s office, money in hand. The Allied invasion of southern France had occurred on 15 August, and Allied soldiers were distant and advancing rapidly toward Digne, a fact that was apparent to the Germans and their French collaborators. Schenck introduced her to a Gestapo officer, Max Waem, a Belgian, with the authority to order the release of the SOE agents. She met him in Schenck&#x27;s apartment at four in the afternoon.

That evening, Cammaerts, Fielding, and Sorensen were marched out of the prison by Waem, dressed in his SS uniform. They anticipated they were on the way to their execution, but instead Waem led them to an automobile and they were driven to the outskirts of Digne where Skarbek was waiting for them. She got into the automobile without a nod of recognition and they thought that she too was a prisoner. They drove to the bank of a river where Fielding helped Waem bury his SS tunic. It was only then that he realised that they were being released, not executed. Several years later, Skarbek told another Pole and fellow World War II veteran that, during her negotiations with the Gestapo, she had been unaware of any danger to herself. Only after she and her comrades had made good their escape did it hit home: &quot;What have I done! They could have shot me as well.&quot;

After Cammaerts and the other two men were released, Schenck was advised to leave Digne. He did not and was subsequently murdered by a person or persons unknown. His wife kept the bribe money and, after the war, attempted to exchange it for new francs. She was arrested but was released after the authorities investigated her story. She was able to exchange the money for only a tiny portion of its value. Cammaerts and Skarbek helped her return to her home. Skarbek had promised Waem he would not be arrested by the British, and battled with SOE leaders with some success to protect him. He survived the war and returned to Belgium.

Cammaerts named his daughter Christine (born 1948) after her. The story of Skarbeks&#x27;s bribe is fictionalised in the last episode of the television series &quot;Wish Me Luck.&quot;

Operation Dragoon. Digne was liberated by the American army two days after Skarbek rescued Cammaerts, Fielding, and Sorensen. The maquis had cleared the way for the Americans and there was little opposition. Cammaerts and Skarbek met the American commander, Brigadier General Frederic B. Butler, at Sisteron on 20 August. They offered their help but he dismissed them as &quot;bandits.&quot; No respecter of rank, Skarbek was furious and had to be calmed down by an aide to the general. Leaving the American army behind, the two proceeded to Gap where the maquis had captured the German garrison. Several hundred Poles, conscripted soldiers in the German army, were among the captured Germans. Skarbek addressed the Poles with a megaphone and secured their agreement to join the Allied forces, provided that they shed their German uniforms. The Poles stripped off their uniforms. General Butler arrived and disapproved of the proceedings, threatening Skarbek and Cammaerts with arrest and court martial if they did not leave. Later, they had a better reception from Butler&#x27;s superior officer, General Alexander Patch, who appointed them as the liaison for the Americans with the maquis. The couple continued northward to Lyon and Paris. In September Skarbek took a military flight to London.

===Conclusion of duties===

When the SOE teams returned from France (or in some cases, were given 24 hours to depart by de Gaulle) in autumn 1944, some of the British women sought new missions in the Pacific War, where the war with the Empire of Japan continued; but Skarbek, as a Pole, was ideally placed to serve as a courier for missions to her homeland. As the Red Army advanced across Poland, the British government and Polish government-in-exile worked together to leave a network in place that would report on events in the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland. Kowerski and Skarbek were now fully reconciled with the Polish forces and were preparing to be dropped into Poland in early 1945. However, the mission, called Operation Freston, was cancelled because the first party to enter Poland were captured by the Red Army (they were released in February 1945).

The women of SOE were all given military rank, with honorary commissions in either the Women&#x27;s Transport Service, the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry (FANY), officially part of the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) though a very elite and autonomous part, or the Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF). In preparation for her service in France, she had been a member of the FANY. On her return, she transferred to the WAAF as a flight officer until the end of the war in Europe: 21 November 1944 to 14 May 1945.

==Honours and awards==
Skarbek&#x27;s exploits were recognised with award of the George Medal.

For her work in conjunction with the British authorities, in May 1947 she was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), an award normally associated with officers of the equivalent military rank of lieutenant colonel, and a level above the most usual award of Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) given to other women agents of SOE. Despite her problems with the Poles during the war, in 1945 when Skarbek visited Polish military headquarters in her British WAAF uniform, she was treated by the Polish military chiefs with the highest respect.

French recognition of Skarbek&#x27;s contribution to the liberation of France came with the award of the Croix de Guerre.


==Postwar life==
After the war, Skarbek was left without financial reserves or a native country to return to. Xan Fielding, whom she had saved from execution by the Gestapo, wrote in his 1954 book, &quot;Hide and Seek&quot;, dedicated &quot;To the memory of Christine Granville&quot;:
 She was ultimately naturalised in December 1946 after returning to Britain and threatening to refuse her George Medal and OBE.

Unable to find work, Skarbek went to Nairobi, Kenya Colony to join Michael Dunford, an old lover, but the British colonial government turned down her application for a work permit. She returned to London where she became in turn a telephone operator, a salesperson, a waitress, and a cabin steward on ocean liners. On one of the passenger ships, the &quot;Ruahine&quot;, the crew, including Skarbek, were required to wear any medals they had been awarded during the war. Skarbek&#x27;s &quot;impressive line of ribbons, enough to flatter a general&quot;, led to resentment among the crew and accusations of lying. A fellow steward, Dennis George Muldowney, defended her, and the two probably were lovers. Muldowney became obsessed with her, and she broke off with him, saying he was &quot;obstinate and terrifying&quot;.

==Death and legacy==
Christine Granville was stabbed to death in the Shellbourne Hotel, 1 Lexham Gardens, Earls Court, in London, on 15 June 1952. She had begun work as a steward some six weeks earlier with the Union-Castle Line and had booked into the hotel on 14 June, having returned from a working voyage out of Durban, South Africa, on &quot;Winchester Castle&quot;. Her body was identified by her cousin Andrzej Skarbek. When her death was recorded at the Royal Borough of Kensington&#x27;s register office, her age was given as 37, the age she claimed on her British passport. Her assailant was Dennis Muldowney, the obsessed man who had worked with her as a steward on &quot;Ruahine&quot; and was at the time of her murder a Reform Club porter. After being convicted of her murder, Muldowney was hanged at HMP Pentonville on 30 September 1952.

Granville was interred in St Mary&#x27;s Catholic Cemetery, Kensal Green, northwest London. In 2013, a ceremony marked the renovation of her grave by the Polish Heritage Society.

Following Granville&#x27;s death, Andrzej Kowerski (Andrew Kennedy) led a group of men, especially Cammaerts, Roper, and Patrick Howarth, dedicated to ensuring that her name not be &quot;sullied&quot; and successfully prevented publication in newspapers and books of &quot;rubbish&quot; about her, which biographer Madeleine Masson interpreted as meaning stories of her sex life. Masson eventually received the support of the group to publish a &quot;scrubbed&quot; version of Granville&#x27;s life. Kowerski/Kennedy died of cancer in Munich, Germany in December 1988. His ashes were flown to London and interred at the foot of Skarbek&#x27;s grave.

In 1971, the Shellbourne Hotel was bought by a Polish group; in a storeroom, they found Skarbek&#x27;s trunk, containing her clothes, papers, and SOE issue dagger. This dagger, her medals, and some of her papers are now held in the Polish Institute and Sikorski Museum at 20 Prince&#x27;s Gate, Kensington, London.

In May 2017, a bronze bust by Ian Wolter was unveiled at the Polish Hearth Club (&quot;Ognisko Polskie&quot;) in Kensington, London.

In 2020, English Heritage announced that it would place a blue plaque honouring Skarbek at the site of the former Shellbourne Hotel. The plaque was unveiled in September 2020, six years after Granville&#x27;s biographer Clare Mulley had proposed the plaque to English Heritage.

In 2023, the newly opened Raffles Hotel in London named one of its most lavish suites The Granville Suite as a tribute to her.

==Popular culture and biographies==

As Skarbek&#x27;s life became so wildly reported, Kowerski/Kennedy asked their mutual friend W. Stanley Moss to write something definitive; a series of four illustrated articles by Moss were published in &quot;Picture Post&quot; in 1952.

There have been four published biographies of Skarbek:
* Madeleine Masson, &quot;Christine: a Search for Christine Granville, OBE, GM, Croix de Guerre&quot;, 1975; republished 2005, 
* Jan Larecki, &quot;Krystyna Skarbek, Agentka o wielu twarzach&quot; (Krystyna Skarbek, Agent of Many Faces), 2008, .
* Clare Mulley, &quot;The Spy Who Loved: The Secrets and Lives of Christine Granville, Britain&#x27;s first female special agent of the Second World War&quot;, Macmillan, 2012, 
* Ronald Nowicki, &quot;The Elusive Madame G&quot;, 2013, 

On 3 May 2016 BBC Radio 4 broadcast an episode of &quot;Great Lives&quot; in which Krystyna Skarbek&#x27;s life was proposed by Lt General Sir Graeme Lamb, with Clare Mulley as the expert witness.

Michael Morpurgo&#x27;s 2018 book &quot;In the Mouth of the Wolf&quot; centres on Skarbek&#x27;s World War II Resistance work with Morpurgo&#x27;s uncle, Francis Cammaerts.

On 16 March 2021 author Dana Schwartz released a podcast episode about the life of Krystyna Skarbek, &quot;From Poland With Love&quot;.

Mike Palmer&#x27;s short story &quot;Crissie - A Last Hurrah&quot; was published by Palmridge Publishing in 2022 ().

In 1999, Polish writer Maria Nurowska published a novel, &quot;Miłośnica&quot; (&quot;The Lover&quot;) – an account of a fictional female journalist&#x27;s attempt to probe Skarbek&#x27;s story.

Author William F. Nolan claimed that Ian Fleming, in his first James Bond novel, &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (1953), modelled Vesper Lynd on Christine Granville. According to Nolan, Fleming also based Tatiana Romanova, in his 1957 novel &quot;From Russia, with Love&quot;, on Skarbek. Skarbek biographer Clare Mulley, however, wrote that, &quot;if Christine was immortalised as the carelessly beautiful double agent Vesper Lynd, Fleming is more likely to have been inspired by the stories he heard than the woman in person... [H]e never claimed to have met her, even in passing.&quot;

==Film==
Krystyna is portrayed by Morgane Polanski in the upcoming film &quot;The Partisan&quot;. As of April 2024, the film is still in production.

<text>Llandudno (, ) is a seaside resort, town and community in Conwy County Borough, Wales, located on the Creuddyn peninsula, which protrudes into the Irish Sea. In the 2021 UK census, the community – which includes Gogarth, Penrhyn Bay, Craigside, Glanwydden, Penrhynside, and Bryn Pydew – had a population of 19,700 (rounded to the nearest 100). The town&#x27;s name means &quot;Church of Saint Tudno&quot;.

Llandudno is a major seaside resort in Wales, and as early as 1861 was being called &#x27;the Queen of the Welsh Watering Places&#x27; (a phrase later also used in connection with Tenby and Aberystwyth; the word &#x27;resort&#x27; came a little later). Historically a part of Caernarfonshire, Llandudno was formerly in the district of Aberconwy within Gwynedd until 1996.

==History==

The town of Llandudno developed from Stone Age, Bronze Age and Iron Age settlements over many hundreds of years on the slopes of the limestone headland, known to seafarers as the Great Orme and to landsmen as the Creuddyn Peninsula. The origins in recorded history are with the Manor of Gogarth conveyed by King Edward I to Annan, Bishop of Bangor in 1284. The manor comprised three townships, &quot;Y Gogarth&quot; in the south-west, &quot;Y Cyngreawdr&quot; in the north (with the parish church of St Tudno) and &quot;Yr Wyddfid&quot; in the south-east.

Modern Llandudno takes its name from the ancient parish of Saint Tudno. The modern town has grown beyond the ancient parish boundaries to encompass several neighbouring area, including Craig-y-Don and Penrhyn Bay, which were in the parish of Llanrhos (or Eglwys Rhos), which also included Llanrhos village and Deganwy. The ancient parishes of Llandudno, Llanrhos and Llangystennin were in the medieval commote of Creuddyn in the Kingdom of Gwynedd, which was made part of the new county of Caernarfonshire under the Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284.

===Great Orme===
Mostly owned by Mostyn Estates, the Great Orme is home to several large herds of wild Kashmiri goats originally descended from a pair presented by the Shah of Persia to Queen Victoria and subsequently given to Lord Mostyn. These goats are also known to frequently roam the main streets of Llandudno. The summit of the Great Orme stands at 679 feet (207 m). The Summit Hotel, now a tourist attraction, was once the home of world middleweight champion boxer Randolph Turpin.

The limestone headland is a haven for flora and fauna, with some rare species such as peregrine falcons and a species of wild cotoneaster (&quot;cambricus&quot;) which can only be found on the Great Orme. The sheer limestone cliffs provide ideal nesting conditions for a wide variety of sea birds, including cormorants, shags, guillemots, razorbills, puffins, kittiwakes, fulmars and numerous gulls.

There are several attractions including the Great Orme Tramway and the Llandudno Cable Car that takes tourists to the summit. The Great Orme also has the longest toboggan run in Britain at 750m long.

===Development===

By 1847 the town had grown to a thousand people, served by the new church of St George, built in 1840. The great majority of the men worked in the copper mines, with others employed in fishing and subsistence agriculture.

In 1848, Owen Williams, an architect and surveyor from Liverpool, presented Lord Mostyn with plans to develop the marshlands behind Llandudno Bay as a holiday resort. These were enthusiastically pursued by Lord Mostyn. The influence of the Mostyn Estate and its agents over the years was paramount in the development of Llandudno, especially after the appointment of George Felton as surveyor and architect in 1857. Between 1857 and 1877 much of central Llandudno was developed under Felton&#x27;s supervision. Felton also undertook architectural design work, including the design and execution of Holy Trinity Church in Mostyn Street.

==Transport==
===Railway===
The town is served by Llandudno railway station, which is the northern terminus of a long branch line from Llandudno Junction. There are generally half-hourly services between the two stations; some trains continue to Blaenau Ffestiniog or to Manchester Airport.

Llandudno Junction station is sited on the North Wales Coast railway line, which was opened as the Chester and Holyhead Railway in 1848. It became part of the London and North Western Railway in 1859 and part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1923. Llandudno was specifically built as a mid-Victorian era holiday destination and the branch line opened in 1858, with an intermediate station at Deganwy.

===Buses===
The town is served by Arriva Buses Wales, with services to Rhyl, Bangor, Caernarfon and the Great Orme summit. In addition, Llew Jones provides services to Betws-y-coed and Llanrwst.

===Trams===
The Great Orme Tramway runs from the centre of the town to the summit of the Great Orme and is Great Britain&#x27;s only remaining cable-operated street tramway.

The former Llandudno and Colwyn Bay Electric Railway operated an electric tramway service between Llandudno and Rhos-on-Sea from 1907; this was extended to Colwyn Bay in 1908. The service closed in 1956. In Llandudno, the original tramway went up the middle of Gloddaeth Street, down Mostyn Street, through Penrhyn Bay and across to Colwyn Bay.

==Attractions==
===Llandudno Bay and the North Shore===

For most of the length of Llandudno&#x27;s &quot;North Shore&quot; there is a wide curving Victorian promenade. The road, collectively known as The Parade, has a different name for each block and it is on these parades and crescents that many of Llandudno&#x27;s hotels are built. The &quot;North Wales Theatre, Arena and Conference Centre&quot;, built in 1994, and extended in 2006 and renamed &quot;Venue Cymru&quot; is located near the centre of the bay.

===Llandudno Pier===

The Llandudno Pier is on the &quot;North Shore&quot;. Built in 1877, it is a Grade II listed building. The pier was extended in 1884 in a landward direction along the side of what was the Baths Hotel (where the Grand Hotel now stands).

===Happy Valley and Haulfre Gardens===
The Happy Valley, a former quarry, was the gift of Lord Mostyn to the town in celebration of the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1887. The area was landscaped and developed as gardens, two miniature golf courses, a putting green, a popular open-air theatre and extensive lawns. The ceremonies connected with the Welsh National Eisteddfod were held there in 1896 and again in 1963. The gardens are listed at Grade II on the Cadw/ICOMOS Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in Wales.

Haulfre Gardens were developed as the private gardens to a house, Sunny Hill, in the north-west of the town. Later acquired by the council, they were opened as a public park in 1929, the opening ceremony being conducted by David Lloyd George. The gardens are listed Grade II on the Cadw/ICOMOS register.

===Marine Drive===
The first route round the perimeter of the Great Orme was a footpath constructed in 1858 by Reginald Cust, a trustee of the Mostyn Estate. In 1872 the Great Ormes Head Marine Drive Co. Ltd. was formed to turn the path into a carriage road. Following bankruptcy, a second company completed the road in 1878. The contractors for the scheme were Messrs Hughes, Morris, Davies, a consortium led by Richard Hughes of Madoc Street, Llandudno. The road was bought by Llandudno Urban District Council in 1897. The one-way drive starts at the foot of the Happy Valley. After about a side road leads to St. Tudno&#x27;s Church, the Great Orme Bronze Age Copper Mine and the summit of the Great Orme. Continuing on the Marine Drive the Great Orme Lighthouse (now a small hotel) is passed, and, shortly afterwards on the right, the Rest and Be Thankful Cafe and information centre. Below the Marine Drive at its western end is the site of the wartime Coast Artillery School (1940–1945), now a scheduled ancient monument.

===West Shore===
The West Shore is a quiet beach on the estuary of the River Conwy. It was here at Pen Morfa that Alice Liddell (of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; fame) spent the long summer holidays of her childhood.

===Mostyn Street===
Running behind the promenade is Mostyn Street leading to Mostyn Broadway and then Mostyn Avenue. These are the main shopping streets of Llandudno and Craig-y-Don. Mostyn Street accommodates the high street shops, the major high street banks and building societies, two churches, amusement arcades and the town&#x27;s public library. The last is the starting point for the Llandudno Town Trail.

===Victorian Extravaganza===

Every year in May bank holiday weekend, Llandudno has a three-day Victorian Carnival and Mostyn Street becomes a funfair. Madoc Street and Gloddaeth Street and the Promenade become part of the route each day of a mid-day carnival parade. The Bodafon Farm fields become the location of a Festival of Transport.

==Llandudno Lifeboat==
Until 2017, Llandudno was unique within the United Kingdom in that its lifeboat station was located inland, allowing it to launch with equal facility from either the West Shore or the North Shore as needed. In 2017, a new lifeboat station was completed, and new, high-speed, offshore and inshore lifeboats, and a modern launching system, were acquired. This station is close to the paddling pool on North Shore.
Llandudno&#x27;s active volunteer crews are called out more than ever with the rapidly increasing numbers of small pleasure craft sailing in coastal waters. The Llandudno Lifeboat is normally on display on the promenade every Sunday and bank holiday Monday from May until October.

==Places of worship==
The ancient parish church dedicated to Saint Tudno stands in a hollow near the northern point of the Great Orme and two miles (3 km) from the present town. It was established as an oratory by Tudno, a 6th-century monk, but the present church dates from the 12th century and it is still used on summer Sunday mornings. It was the Anglican parish church of Llandudno until that status was transferred first to St George&#x27;s (now closed) and later to Holy Trinity Church in Mostyn Street.

The principal Christian Churches of Llandudno are members of Cytûn (churches together) and include the Church in Wales (Holy Trinity and also Saint Paul&#x27;s at Craig-y-Don), the Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady Star of the Sea, Saint John&#x27;s Methodist Church, Gloddaeth United Church (Presbyterian), Assemblies of God (Pentecostal), Llandudno Baptist Church, St. David&#x27;s Methodist Church at Craig-y-Don, the Coptic Orthodox Church of Saint Mary and Saint Abasikhiron, and Eglwys Unedig Gymraeg Llandudno (the United Welsh Church of Llandudno). There is also a Christadelphian meeting hall in the town.

A member of the local Methodist community is Roger Roberts, now Lord Roberts of Llandudno, Liberal Democrat Spokesman for International Development in the House of Lords.

Llandudno is home to a Jewish centre in Church Walks, which serves local and visiting Jews – one of few in North Wales. There is also a Buddhist centre, Kalpa Bhadra, on Mostyn Avenue in Craig-y-Don.

==Sport==
The town is host to Llandudno F.C., who currently compete in Cymru North, the second tier of Welsh football; the team have competed previously in the top level Cymru Premier division. The club plays its home matches at Maesdu Park and competed in the Europa League in 2016. Llandudno Albion currently play in the third tier of Welsh football and Llandudno Amateurs play in the fourth tier.

A football club is mentioned in Llandudno as far back as 1865. Gloddaeth Rovers dated back to 1878 and played for a decade; they were then replaced by Llandudno Swifts as the town&#x27;s main club. Following the demise of Swifts in 1901, a new club called Llandudno Amateurs were formed; a different team to that which exists now.

Llandudno Rugby Club plays in the town and was established in 1952. It is a member of the Welsh Rugby Union.

There are also local pool, snooker and dominoes tournaments.

== Demographics ==
The 2011 census counted 20,701 usual residents of which 50.8% were born in Wales and 40.7% in England.

The population in 2021, according to the census, decreased to 19,700. 30% of the population are aged 65+, higher than the national average of 21.3%. The largest ethnic group is White with 95.9% of the population, higher than the national average of 93.8%, with the second largest being Asian/Asian British at 1.8%, lower than the national average of 2.9%. The largest religious group is Christianity who make up 52.6% of the population, higher than the national average of 43.6%, with the second largest being No religion who make up 38.4% of the population, lower than the national average of 46.5%.

==Governance==
There are two tiers of local government covering Llandudno, at community (town) level and principal area (county borough) level: Llandudno Town Council and Conwy County Borough Council. The town council is based at Llandudno Town Hall on Lloyd Street. Llandudno is now divided into five electoral wards: Craig-y-Don, Gogarth, Mostyn, Penrhyn and Tudno. The wards elect county councillors to Conwy County Borough Council and four community councillors each to Llandudno Town Council.

===Administrative history===
Llandudno was an ancient parish. In 1854 Llandudno was made an Improvement Commissioners District. The district covered part of the parish of Llandudno and part of the neighbouring parish of Eglwys Rhos.

Improvement commissioners districts such as Llandudno were converted into urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894. The 1894 Act also directed that parishes could no longer straddle district boundaries; the parishes of Llandudno and Eglwys Rhos were therefore both reduced to just cover the parts within the urban district; the parts outside the urban district made a separate parish called Penrhyn. A single parish called &#x27;Llandudno-cum-Eglwysrhos&#x27; was created in 1905 covering the same area as the urban district. The urban district&#x27;s name remained &#x27;Llandudno&#x27;, with &#x27;Llandudno-cum-Eglwysrhos&#x27; being the name of the single civil parish the district contained. The urban district and parish were enlarged in 1934 to absorb the Penhryn and part of the abolished parish of Llangystennin (the rest of which, around Llandudno Junction, went to the borough of Conwy).

The urban district council built Llandudno Town Hall to serve as its headquarters in 1902. In 1974 the urban district was abolished, with the area becoming a community within the Aberconwy district in the new county of Gwynedd. Further local government reform in 1996 saw the area become part of the principal area of Conwy County Borough.

Llandudno falls under the UK parliamentary constituency of Bangor Aberconwy, whose is represented by the Labour MP Claire Hughes, and the Senedd constituency of Aberconwy, whose MS is the Conservative Janet Finch-Saunders. It falls under the North Wales electoral region.

==Links with Wormhout and Mametz==

Llandudno is twinned with the Flemish town of Wormhout from Dunkirk. It was there that many members of the Llandudno-based 69th Territorial Regiment were ambushed and taken prisoner. Later, at nearby Esquelbecq on 28 May 1940, the prisoners were shot.

The 1st (North Wales) Brigade was headquartered in Llandudno in December 1914 and included a battalion of the Royal Welch Fusiliers, which had been raised and trained in Llandudno. During the 1914–18 war this Brigade, a major part of the 38th Welsh Division, took part in the Battle of the Somme and the Brigade was ordered to take Mametz Wood. Two days of fighting brought about the total destruction of Mametz village by shelling. After the war, the people of Llandudno (including returning survivors from the 38th Welsh Division) contributed generously to the fund for the reconstruction of the village of Mametz.

Llandudno is also twinned with Champery, Switzerland since August 2022.

==Cultural connections==

Llandudno hosted the Welsh National Eisteddfod in 1864, 1896 and 1963, and in 2008 welcomed the Urdd National Eisteddfod to Gloddaeth Isaf Farm, Penrhyn Bay. The town also hosted the Liverpool Olympic Festival in 1865 and 1866.

Matthew Arnold gives a vivid and lengthy description of 1860s Llandudno – and of the ancient tales of Taliesin and Maelgwn Gwynedd that are associated with the local landscape – in the first sections of the preface to &quot;On the Study of Celtic Literature&quot; (1867). It is also used as a location for dramatic scenes in the stage play and film &quot;Hindle Wakes&quot; by Stanley Houghton, and the 1911 novel, &quot;The Card&quot;, by Arnold Bennett, and its subsequent film version.

Elisabeth of Wied, the Queen Consort of Romania and also known as writer Carmen Sylva, stayed in Llandudno for five weeks in 1890. On leaving, she described Wales as &quot;a beautiful haven of peace&quot;. Translated into Welsh as &quot;&quot;hardd&quot;, &quot;hafan&quot;, &quot;hedd&quot;&quot;, it became the town&#x27;s official motto.

Other famous people with links to Llandudno include the Victorian statesman John Bright and multi-capped Welsh international footballers Neville Southall, Neil Eardley, Chris Maxwell and Joey Jones. Australia&#x27;s 7th Prime Minister Billy Hughes attended school in Llandudno. Gordon Borrie QC (Baron Borrie), Director General of the Office of Fair Trading from 1976 to 1992, was educated at the town&#x27;s John Bright Grammar School when he lived there as a wartime evacuee.

The international art gallery &quot;Oriel Mostyn&quot; is in Vaughan Street next to the post office. It was built in 1901 to house the art collection of Lady Augusta Mostyn. It was requisitioned in 1914 for use as an army drill hall and later became a warehouse, before being returned to use as an art gallery in 1979. Following a major revamp the gallery was renamed simply &#x27;Mostyn&#x27; in 2010.

Llandudno has its own mini arts festival &quot;&#x27;LL&quot;AWN&#x27; (Llandudno Arts Weekend) which has been running for the past three years (&quot;LL&quot;AWN&quot;01&quot; −2013, &quot;LL&quot;AWN&quot;02 – 2014&quot;, &quot;LL&quot;AWN&quot;03 – 2015&quot;). &quot;LLAWN&quot; is a mini festival that rediscovers and celebrates Llandudno&#x27;s past in rather a unique way; via art, architecture, artefact, sound, performance, and participation. The festival takes place over three days of the weekend in late September, originally conceived as a way to promote what those in the hospitality sector refer to as the ‘shoulder season’, which means a lull in the tourist calendar. The festival is supported by Arts Council Wales, Mostyn Estates, Conwy County Borough Council, MOSTYN and Llandudno Town Council.

<text>Conwy County Borough () is a county borough in the north of Wales. It borders Gwynedd to the west and south and Denbighshire to the east. The largest settlement is Colwyn Bay, and Conwy is the administrative centre.

Conwy has an area of and a population of in , making it sparsely populated. The population is concentrated along the coast, along which are several seaside resorts and the county&#x27;s largest towns: Colwyn Bay (34,284), Llandudno (20,701), and Conwy (14,753). Inland is much less populous, and the only town is Llanrwst (3,323).

The geography of Conwy is shaped by the River Conwy, which forms a wide valley down the western half of the county, bordered by the Denbigh Moors to the east and the mountains of Snowdonia National Park to the west. The River Elwy, a tributary of the Clwyd, drains the eastern half of the moors. The Conwy forms a wide estuary as it reaches the coast, which has by wide, sandy beaches and the limestone headlands of the Great Orme and the Little Orme. The highest peak within the county is Carnedd Llewelyn, at , which is on the boundary with Gwynedd and is the third-highest summit in Wales. Around Betws-y-Coed is the Gwydir Forest, which is mainly given over to plantations. There are several reservoirs in the valleys, the largest of which is Llyn Brenig, which has an area of and extends into Denbighshire.

==Geography==
The River Conwy, after which the county borough is named, lies wholly within the area: rising in Snowdonia and flowing through Llanrwst and Trefriw en route to the Irish Sea by Conwy. The river here marks the border between the historic counties of Caernarfonshire and Denbighshire.

One third of the land area of the county borough lies in the Snowdonia National Park, and the council appoint three of the 18 members of the Snowdonia National Park Authority. Its total area is , making it slightly larger than Hong Kong. The eastern part includes the larger section of Denbigh Moors.

The vast majority of the population live on the coast; the only settlement of any size inland is Llanrwst.

==Welsh language==
According to the 2001 census 39.7% of the population of the county borough have &quot;one or more skills&quot; in Welsh.
In 2021 census 25.9% reported being able to speak Welsh, which ranks Conwy 5th out of 22 principal areas in Wales.
The amount of Welsh spoken in the county borough greatly varies from location to location, with generally the least being spoken on the coastal fringe, in which English is mainly spoken.

Examples of the percentage of people age 3+ speaking Welsh by electoral ward, as of the 2011 census:
==Government==

The county borough was formed on 1 April 1996 by merging the districts of Aberconwy and Colwyn. It was originally named Aberconwy and Colwyn, but its council renamed the district a day later, on 2 April 1996, to Conwy.

===Politics===
Conwy is represented in the UK Parliament by Labour Party politicians Gill German and Claire Hughes since the 2024 election. This election implemented new boundaries, making Conwy County Borough be in the Bangor Aberconwy and Clwyd North UK Parliament constituencies. In the Senedd, it is represented by Conservative Party politicians Janet Finch-Saunders and Darren Millar.
===Coat of arms===

Conwy County Borough Council was granted a coat of arms by the College of Arms in 2001. The new arms recall those of both Aberconwy and Colwyn Borough Councils. The main part of the shield depicts blue and silver waves for the river from which the county borough takes its name, and also recalls the gold and blue wavy field of Colwyn&#x27;s arms. On top of the waves is placed a symbolic red tower, representing Conwy Castle. The &quot;chief&quot; or upper third of the shield is coloured green, the main colour in Aberconwy&#x27;s arms. In the centre of the chief is a severed head from the heraldry of Marchudd ap Cynan, Lord of Abergele and Rhos. On either side are two black spears &quot;embrued&quot;, or having drops of blood on their points. These come from the reputed arms of Nefydd Hardd, associated with the Nant Conwy area. In front of each spear is a golden &quot;garb&quot; or wheatsheaf, for the rural areas of the county borough.

Above the shield, placed on the steel helm usual in British civic arms, is the &quot;crest&quot;. This takes the form of the Welsh red dragon supporting a Bible, rising from a wreath of oak leaves and acorns. The Bible is to commemorate the first Welsh language translation of the book, which originated in the area, while the oak circlet recalls that an oak tree formed the main charge in the arms of Colwyn Borough Council, and its predecessor the municipal borough of Colwyn Bay.

The motto adopted is &quot;Tegwch i Bawb&quot;, meaning &quot;Fairness to All&quot;.

==Railway==
The Conwy Valley Line, from Llandudno Junction to Blaenau Ffestiniog, runs through the borough.

<text>Bridgend (; or just , meaning &quot;the end of the bridge on the Ogmore&quot;) is a town in the Bridgend County Borough of Wales, west of Cardiff and east of Swansea. The town is named after the medieval bridge over the River Ogmore. The River Ewenny also flows through the town. The population was 49,597 in 2021. Bridgend is within the Cardiff Capital Region which in 2019 had a population of approximately 1.54 million.

Historically a part of Glamorgan, Bridgend has greatly expanded in size since the early 1980s – the 2001 census recorded a population of 39,429 for the town.

==History==
===Prehistoric and Roman===

Several prehistoric burial mounds have been found in the vicinity of Bridgend, suggesting that the area was settled before Roman times. The A48 between Bridgend and Cowbridge has a portion, known locally as &quot;Crack Hill&quot;, a Roman road and the &#x27;Golden Mile&#x27; where it is believed Roman soldiers were lined up to be paid. The Vale of Glamorgan would have been a natural low-level route west to the Roman fort and harbour at Neath (&quot;Nidum&quot;) from settlements in the east like Cardiff and Caerleon (&quot;Isca&quot;).

===Norman invasion===

In the decades after the Norman conquest of Anglo-Saxon England in 1066, the Normans looked westwards to create new seats for lords loyal to William the Conqueror. Groups of Norman barons arrived in Wales, and in the south and east created what would later become the Welsh Marches, while the north and west remained largely unconquered.

At Coity, the local Welsh chieftain Morgan Gam already had a stronghold. Sometime in the 11th century, Norman Lord Payn de Turberville approached Morgan to turn over control of Coity Castle to Turberville. Morgan Gam agreed, on condition that Turberville either fought Morgan for the land, or took Gam&#x27;s daughter Sybil&#x27;s hand in marriage. Turberville married Sybil and became Lord of Coity, and rebuilt the castle.

Newcastle Castle (on Newcastle Hill, overlooking the town centre, 1106) and Ogmore Castle (1116) were built by Robert Fitzhamon and William de Londres, respectively. About north-east of Ogmore Castle, Maurice de Londres founded the fortified Benedictine Ewenny Priory in 1141.

These three castles provided a &quot;defensive triangle&quot; for the area – a quadrilateral if Ewenny Priory is included.

===Early development===
Bridgend developed at a ford on the River Ogmore, which was on the main route between east and west Wales. Just north of the town is the confluence of three rivers, the Ogmore, the Llynfi, and the Garw. South of Bridgend, the River Ewenny merges with the River Ogmore and flows into the Bristol Channel. In the 15th century, a stone bridge was built as a permanent connection between the two sides of the Ogmore (and was later rebuilt). Originally, this bridge had four arches, but in the 18th century, a massive flood washed two of them away. The rest of the bridge still stands and remains a focal point of the town: aesthetic restoration took place in 2006.

Bridgend grew rapidly into an agricultural town. It became an important market town, a status it retained until the late 20th century.

===Industrial era===
The discovery of coal in the South Wales Valleys north of Bridgend had a massive impact on the town. The first coal mining operations opened north of Bridgend in the 17th century; the Llynfi Valley was the first to be industrialised. Bridgend itself never had coal deposits and remained a market town for some time, but the valleys of the three rivers grew into an important part of the South Wales coalfields. Ironworks and brickworks (notably at Tondu) were also established in the same period by John Bedford, although the ironworks faltered after his death and ceased operating entirely in 1836.

The Great Western Railway arrived and Bridgend was at the junction between the main London to Fishguard line and the branch to the three valleys. Frequent coal trains took coal down the valleys; and when the Vale of Glamorgan railway opened, coal could be sent directly to port at Barry or via other branch lines to Porthcawl.

Several quarries opened in and around Bridgend town centre; some remnants of these can still be seen today near Brackla. An engine works was opened in the town and a larger farmers&#x27; market also opened in the town centre, where it remained until the 1970s.

In 1801, the population of what is now Bridgend County was around 6000. By the beginning of the 20th century this had risen to 61,000. By this time Bridgend was a bustling market town with prosperous valleys to the north, a thriving community and good links to other towns and cities.

===Second World War===
In the Second World War, Bridgend had a prisoner of war (POW) camp at Island Farm and a large munitions factory (ROF Bridgend – known as the &quot;Admiralty&quot;) at Waterton, as well as a large underground munitions storage base at Brackla (known as the 8Xs). This was an overspill of the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich.

At its peak, the arsenal had 40,000 workers, many of them women. Large numbers of them were transported by bus from the Rhondda and the valleys.

The factory complex had three sites in Bridgend, all linked together by a large network of railways. Many reminders of the factory sites remain to this day.

In March 1945, 87 POWs from Island Farm escaped through a tunnel, but all were recaptured. While Bridgend was as important during the war as any other part of Wales, and although it was photographed by the Luftwaffe, it was never blitzed, although the area immediately around Bridgend did suffer bombing raids. 
The admiralty ceased full-scale production in December 1945 after five years. Two of the munitions-storage magazines in the Brackla ROF site were converted to a regional government headquarters during the Cold War as part of the UK continuity of government plans. It is now in the hands of a private company.

===After the war===
Bridgend remained a solid market town after the war. In 1948, Newbridge Fields (a short distance from the town centre) hosted the 1948 National Eisteddfod.

In 1960, the River Ogmore burst its banks and flooded the town centre. Subsequent floods and extreme weather led the Welsh Water Authority to develop concrete flood defence walls along the banks of the River Ogmore in the town centre. The town centre has not been flooded since. During this time, Bridgend was chosen to become the headquarters for South Wales Police. This action was ideal as geographically, Bridgend stands equidistantly between Swansea to the west and Cardiff to the east.

The Beeching cuts of the 1960s had the loss of passenger rail links in the Vale of Glamorgan and to the northern valleys. The Vale of Glamorgan link to Barry via Rhoose was reinstated in June 2005.

In the 1970s, Bridgend began to see the catalyst of arguably its biggest growth period. The &quot;missing section&quot; of the M4 motorway was constructed around the town, plans were afoot to change the Waterton Admiralty into an industrial estate, and the water supply was improved including new sewage treatment works near Ogmore. Two major multinational corporations, the Ford Motor Company and Sony, set up factories in or on the outskirts of the new Bridgend Industrial Estate (former Waterton Arsenal).

The development of the Brackla Housing Estate in the 1980s, housing developments at Broadlands to the south-west of the town centre and the continuing expansion of Brackla to the north-east have caused Bridgend&#x27;s population to swell dramatically. Due to this, traffic congestion and a lack of parking facilities within the town have become important issues in the area. In 1997, a new link road/bypass was built to link the town centre directly to the M4 motorway, as well as redirect traffic around the town centre.

A new Securicor-operated prison (HM Parc Prison) was built near Coity in the late 1990s. The prison opened in November 1997.

The McArthur Glen Designer Outlet opened in 1998.

===New millennium===

Objective 1 investment in regeneration and public realm improvements has led to the pedestrianisation of the town centre and the restoration of some buildings. Some local traders have argued that this has damaged trade due to a lack of access by taxis and the disabled. Car parking provision and pricing have also been a concern to retailers with calls for free or reduced-price parking to increase town centre visits.

To counteract the dominance of Tesco in the area, Asda were granted planning permission for a new superstore near the town centre. The store was opened on 31 March 2008 by the local MP, and players from Bridgend Ravens. Over 1500 customers were thought to have walked through the new doors to take a look around the new store.

In 2004, an award-winning new bus station was constructed and traffic movements around the town centre were altered. Local committees, together with the council, started to use the pedestrianisation of the town centre to its advantage, culminating in several fairs including Continental Markets, Celtic Festivals, a small Mardi-Gras, and seasonal markets and events. Bridgend Council estimated in 2009 that these events have brought 900,000 visitors to the town and generated around £53 million for the local economy.
About £2.5 million of European funding was used to create a &quot;riverside café culture&quot; by constructing a walkway along the River Ogmore, which was completed in March 2009.

===Future developments===
Construction on a 1500-home sustainable &quot;village&quot; at Parc Derwen near Coity began in 2011. The scheme was a collaboration between several house-builders and public bodies including the National Assembly, and was planned with strict guidelines regarding architecture and the environment. Concerns exist from Coity in particular that this development may impact on their village&#x27;s identity.

Studies were carried out by the local council with a view to improving retail provision in the town centre. Attracting bigger high-street chains to the town, such as Marks &amp; Spencer, Next, and Debenhams is seen as key to this.

At Elder Yard, a derelict Grade II-listed building in the heart of the town centre is due to be converted to a restaurant and provide the impetus for other improvements there, including a public courtyard and extra retail and leisure provision.

==Politics==

As of July 2024, the local Member of Parliament is Chris Elmore (Welsh Labour), the Member of the Senedd for Bridgend is Sarah Murphy (Labour) along with the regional members for the South Wales West region: Luke Fletcher (Plaid Cymru), Thomas Giffard (Conservative), Altaf Hussain (Conservative) and Sioned Williams (Plaid Cymru).
===Local government===
Bridgend County Borough Council is led by the Welsh Labour Party, which has been running a majority administration since the May 2022 local elections, where the Labour party gained ten seats to finish on 27 out of a possible 51 seats. At those elections Independents won 21 seats, Plaid Cymru 2 and the Conservatives 1. A few weeks after the elections Labour lost the ward of Bridgend Central in a by-election to an independent candidate reducing the Labour group to 26 and increasing the independent group to 22.

After the 2012 election, the council was made up of 39 Labour councillors, 10 Independents, 3 Liberal Democrats, 1 Conservative and 1 Plaid Cymru. The Youth Mayor of Bridgend County Borough as of 2017 is Niamh Gwilym, and the Deputy Youth Mayor is Leigh Williams.

Bridgend was an electoral ward to Glamorgan County Council from 1889 to 1974, electing the Earl of Dunraven as its first representative. Since 1995 the town has been covered by three wards to Bridgend County Borough Council, Morfa, Oldcastle and Newcastle, which each elect two councillors.

At the Town Council level, Bridgend is represented by nineteen town councillors on Bridgend Town Council, elected from the three town wards of Morfa, Oldcastle and Newcastle.

==Demography==
According to the 2021 Census, the population of the town and its urban area was 51,785. Of those residents, the demographics of the town were recorded as:

===Ethnicity===
*94.9% White
*2.5% Asian
*1.7% Mixed
*0.5% Black

==Economy==

Bridgend&#x27;s travel to work area has expanded since 1991 and the 2001-based area now incorporates the western part of the Vale of Glamorgan.

Bridgend recovered quickly from the decline of traditional industries, particularly coal-mining due to other alternative forms of employment. Wages are generally higher here than in other parts of the South Wales valleys. There are large industrial estates at Bridgend and Waterton (formerly Waterton Admiralty) which host a number of small-scale and multi-national companies, mainly manufacturing.

Ford&#x27;s engine plant near Waterton used to employ around 2,000 workers and was one of the area&#x27;s largest employers, working on range of low carbon &quot;EcoBoost&quot; engines. The plant won praise from Peter Mandelson in January 2009 who described it as &quot;a top-of-the-class, world-beating engine production plant.&quot; Ford invested £315million in the Bridgend plant between 2004 and 2009. The Ford plant closed in September 2020.

IT Consultancy Group CGI have an office in Bridgend, and Lidl has also set up its Welsh headquarters and distribution site at Waterton. Zoobiotic, a company specialising in maggot therapy, has its facility near Bridgend town centre. Also, since 1983, famous dart board producer Winmau has based its global headquarters in Bridgend.

Others include Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Staedtler, engineering consultancy Skanska, aeronautic maintenance and project management company TES Aviation and home accessories manufacturer Dekor plc. The Semiconductor Photomask Company, Photronics Inc, has had a manufacturing operation for the last 20 years at the Ewenny Science Park.

However, there have been significant economic blows to Bridgend including Sony&#x27;s closure of the Bridgend plant and downsizing of the Pencoed plant. The plant is still Sony&#x27;s biggest in the UK despite this. Other manufacturers to have pulled out of the area include Wrigley Company and Dairy Farmers of Britain which went into receivership in June 2009.

Bridgend has a lack of high-wage service jobs; however the retail sector in particular provides a large proportion of employment in the town and borough. In 2008, there were 13,100 people in Bridgend County working in construction and manufacturing, while 42,900 were working in the service sector.

Sub-regional GVA for the Bridgend &amp; Neath Port Talbot NUTS3 region stood at £12,402 per capita in 2006 ($23,191 at June 2006 values). This figure represents 65% of the UK GVA per capita, 87% of Welsh GVA per capita (£14,226) and 103% of West Wales &amp; The Valleys GVA per capita (£12,071).

Gross disposable income for Bridgend &amp; Neath Port Talbot in 2006 stood at £3,338 million or £12,379 per head. This was 88% of UK per head figure (£14,053) and slightly above the Welsh per head figure (£12,366).

In 2008, the average full-time gross weekly earnings in Swansea, Bridgend &amp; Neath Port Talbot was £484.20 (£531.70 for men, £426.10 for women). This was 97% of the Welsh average (£498.10).

In the first half of 2009, unemployment in Bridgend County Borough stood at 8.9% and economic inactivity stood at 21.4%.

The percentage of workless households in December 2008 stood at 20.6% compared to the UK average of 16% and the Welsh average of 18.8%.

===Shopping===

In the town centre the main retail shopping areas are the Rhiw Shopping Centre (containing Bridgend Market), Adare Street, Caroline Street, Derwen Road, Nolton Street, Queen Street, Dunraven Place, Market Street and Cheapside (home of the Brackla Street Centre and Asda store). These are near the bus and railway stations and pay and display car parks.

There are out-of-town shopping areas at Waterton, near the A473, on Cowbridge Road and at The Derwen, Junction 36 of the M4, home to the Bridgend Designer Outlet.

==Transport==

Bridgend railway station has regular services to Cardiff Central, Bristol Parkway and London Paddington to the east; Port Talbot Parkway, Neath, Swansea and the West Wales Line to the west; and Maesteg to the north. There are also services to Manchester Piccadilly. Bridgend is the western terminus of the Vale of Glamorgan Line which reopened to passenger traffic in 2005.

Wildmill railway station, about north of Bridgend railway station, serves the estates of Wildmill, Pendre and Litchard and is on the Bridgend-Maesteg branch line. A park and ride station at Brackla, about south-east of Bridgend railway station is planned and is due to be constructed once capacity improvements have been made to the South Wales Main Line. Services to a new railway station in Llanharan began in December 2007.

Bridgend bus station has services to urban and rural areas in South Wales. Most services are operated by First Cymru under the &quot;Bridgend &amp; County&quot; livery.

An east–west cycle route has been constructed from Brackla through to Broadlands and into Cefn Glas. Bridgend is on the National Cycle Route and there are off-road spurs from the Celtic Trail to the town centre and a community route in the Ogmore Valley. Glyncorrwg and the Afan Valley about north of Bridgend near Maesteg is famed for its mountain bike trails, considered amongst the best in Europe.

For scheduled and chartered air travel, Bridgend is served by Cardiff International Airport, to which there are direct rail and bus services.

==Education==
Bridgend town has four comprehensive schools: Coleg Cymunedol Y Dderwen Archbishop McGrath Catholic Comprehensive, Brynteg Comprehensive School, Bryntirion Comprehensive School, and pencoed comprehensive school. Brynteg generally serves the area east of the River Ogmore, while Bryntirion serves the areas west of the river. Brynteg is renowned for its rugby alumni, including J.P.R. Williams, Rob Howley, Gavin Henson, Mike Hall and Dafydd James; many talented athletes at other local schools join Brynteg to play for the school in the Welsh School Rugby Union leagues. The school has produced several Welsh rugby union internationals, and prominent athletes in other sports have also attended, including top female cyclist Nicole Cooke. Bryntirion has also produced its fair share of sporting talent, notably Gareth Llewellyn and triathlete Marc Jenkins. Archbishop McGrath School covers the whole of the county, and moved to a new campus at Brackla in 2011.

At least nine primary, junior schools, and infant schools are in the town, though several of the junior and infant schools have merged to form single primary schools in recent years.

Also, two special-educational needs schools are there: Heronsbridge School which is linked with Brynteg Comprehensive School and at the back of Bridgend College. It is for students of primary and secondary school ages with severe learning disabilities. Another school, Ysgol Bryn Castell, offers education for Key Stage 1–4 students with moderate to severe learning disabilities; it is linked with Bryntirion Comprehensive School and has opened up a satellite unit at Cynffig Comprehensive School, a few miles west of Bridgend.

Bridgend College is the town&#x27;s further education and higher education provider; it primarily offers vocational courses and GCSEs. It attracts school-leavers from as far as Swansea and Cardiff. It offers a range of higher-education courses such as Postgraduate Certificate in Education, Higher National Certificate, and Higher National Diploma in various subjects and master&#x27;s programmes at its Queens Road campus on Bridgend Industrial Estate. These are mainly franchised from the University of South Wales. The Pencoed Campus has a focus on sport, animal care, and horticulture, and Maesteg Campus offers more community-based programmes.

Bridgend College has its own residence for students aged 16+ with learning difficulties and physical disabilities who come to the college from all over Wales.

==Health==
Since the closure and redevelopment of Bridgend General Hospital in the 1990s, acute-care and accident and emergency services have been provided by the Princess of Wales Hospital. GP&#x27;s surgeries are scattered throughout the town, as are dentists. There is also a large psychiatric hospital, Glanrhyd Hospital, near Pen-y-fai.

==Culture==

===Nightlife===

Several pubs, restaurants and a nightclub are located within the town centre.

In December 2008, Bridgend Council introduced its first alcohol-free zone, restricting the consumption of alcohol to pubs, clubs, and other licensed premises in the town centre to help address alcohol-related issues. CCTV is in operation throughout the town centre, and usually police have a presence of some form. Since July 2007, the streets of Bridgend are also patrolled on Friday and Saturday evenings by Street Pastors, an inter-denominational church response to urban problems, engaging with people on the streets.

===Music===

Funeral for a Friend and Jayce Lewis have both received mainstream and commercial recognition, while rock/metal act Bullet for My Valentine contributed to the meteoric uprising in the mid-2000s metal music industry. Along with Those Damn Crows, they have all received national and international chart success. Several smaller venues in and around the town centre, including The New Angel Inn, The Railway Inn, Barracudas and Sapphires, host a number of open-mic nights. Bryan Adams played to a 15,000 crowd at Brewery Field stadium in the town in 2006. The Recreation Centre has hosted acts such as Fall Out Boy and Bring Me the Horizon. 

===Eisteddfodau===

Bridgend hosted the National Eisteddfod in 1948. Bridgend County hosted the Urdd Gobaith Cymru National Eisteddfod in 2017.

===Media===
Television signals are received from the Wenvoe TV transmitter and the local relay transmitter situated in Llangeinor. 
Bridgend is served by several Independent Local Radio stations: Bridge FM, Heart South Wales, Nation Radio Wales and Celtica radio. The main local newspaper is &quot;The Glamorgan Gazette&quot;, although a free newspaper, &quot;The Recorder&quot;, has increased its circulation in recent times. &quot;Around Town&quot; magazine is the free local lifestyle magazine for Bridgend.

===Twinning===
Bridgend has twinning arrangements with:
* Langenau, Germany
* Villenave-d&#x27;Ornon, France

Talks held to twin Bridgend with the city of Tripoli in Libya between 2004 and 2009 sparked debate.

==Sport==
===Rugby union===
Bridgend Ravens
Bridgend Ravens (formally Bridgend RFC) are a semi-professional rugby union which formed in 1878 and play in the Welsh Premier Division. They play their home matches at the Brewery Field, which has been their home on and off since 1920. The club have been Welsh champions five times and have won the WRU Challenge Cup on two occasions, whilst also winning the WRU Division One West league in 2011 and numerous sevens competitions over the course of their existence. They have also played against international teams, New Zealand won on their visit in 1978, but Bridgend have beaten Italy, Western Samoa and Australia. The club has also hosted international matches at women and age grade.

Bridgend Athletic
Bridgend Athletic RFC was reformed in 1972, after the Bridgend Youth team members in that year wanted to form a senior team so they didn&#x27;t have to go their separate ways into senior rugby, hence the formation of the club which had previously existed up to 1939. The club become full members of the Welsh Rugby Union in 1983. The club were promoted from Division 5 Central in 2001, were WRU Division Four East Champions in 2002, were then promoted from Division 3 to WRU Division Two West in 2003 through the league organisation and were promoted to Division 1 in 2004. They have suffered relegation from that league once, but bounced back in 2009, winning WRU Division Two West. They play in WRU Division One West.

Bridgend Sports
Bridgend Sports Rugby Football Club is a Welsh rugby union team based in Bridgend. Formed in 1938 by Victor Blick, the team survived the cessation of club rugby in Wales between 1939 and 1945, during the Second World War. There have been in existence at least two other clubs in Bridgend throughout the club&#x27;s history providing local competition. The club is a member of the Welsh Rugby Union and play in the WRU Division Four South East. They won the Glamorgan County Silver Ball Trophy on three successive years between 1979 and 1981, and were champions of WRU Division Five South Central in 2010.

Celtic Warriors

The Celtic Warriors, formed in 2003, are a defunct regional rugby union team that was mainly based at the Brewery Field in Bridgend. When regional rugby was enforced by the Welsh Rugby Union, Bridgend RFC and Pontypridd RFC, who were both professional clubs at the time, merged to create the Celtic Warriors as one of the five new regional rugby teams in Wales. However, they were dissolved after one season due to financial problems that had plagued the club. Pontypridd RFC had sold their share of the region early on due to their own financial difficulties, with the remaining share which had been owned by Bridgend RFC, being sold off to the Welsh Rugby Union at the end of the season. This led to the winding up of the Celtic Warriors region by the WRU, as there was not enough money to keep the region afloat. There were high points for the region: 10,000 turned up to watch them face European champions-in-waiting London Wasps and even beat the Wasps 9–14 at Adam&#x27;s Park a week earlier. The team finished 4th out of 12 in the Celtic League in their only season of existence.

Ospreys Rugby

The Ospreys were formed in 2003 after the merger of Neath RFC and Swansea RFC, which took place after the Welsh Rugby Union forced through regional rugby as the top level of Welsh rugby. Bridgend became part of this region following the demise of the Celtic Warriors. Although the Ospreys play their home matches at the Liberty Stadium in Swansea, since 2010 they have played their home Anglo-Welsh Cup home games at the Brewery Field, which is normally two games a season.

===Football===

Bridgend had two football teams, Bridgend Town A.F.C., and a Bridgend suburb side Bryntirion Athletic F.C. that played in the Welsh Football League First Division. Bridgend Town AFC from 2009 played at The Brewery Field (The Football Club purchased The Brewery Field in 2009) as the club sold its ground at Coychurch Road ground due to works in conjunction with the new Asda store. In 2013, the two clubs joined to form Pen-y-Bont F.C. who, following promotion in 2019, play in the Cymru Premier, the top level of Welsh football. They are currently managed by Rhys Griffiths. Schools football in Bridgend is governed by the Bridgend Schools FA.

Bridgend&#x27;s geographical position means South Wales rivals Cardiff City and Swansea City pick up support from the town.

===Rugby league===
Bridgend was home to Super League rugby league team the Crusaders, who were based at the Brewery Field, home of rugby union club, Bridgend RFC. This side was considered by a few to be a replacement for the Celtic Warriors rugby union side after their controversial disbanding in 2004 but also built up a loyal following in their own right. The Crusaders&#x27; application for a Super League licence was granted by the Rugby Football League on 22 July 2008. The decision elevated the club from National League One to compete in Super League XIV from 2009.

For the 2010 Super League season, Crusaders initially announced they would play at Newport&#x27;s Rodney Parade ground for two seasons. However, in the run up to the new season the Celtic Crusaders franchise was sold by owner Leighton Samuel to Wrexham Football Club parent company, Wrexham Village Ltd and the side moved to Wrexham, playing home fixtures at The Racecourse Ground.

Bridgend&#x27;s second rugby league side is the Bridgend Blue Bulls, one of the UK&#x27;s most successful amateur clubs having won two UK national amateur titles in four years and Welsh Champions five years in succession. The Bulls played at Coychurch Road but following the announcement about the setting up of the Celtic Crusaders they were invited to play at the Brewery Field by the owner Leighton Samuel. One year on they were refused permission to continue playing at the Brewery Field in the middle of the season. They were then aided by Porthcawl RFC and staged the remaining 2006 home games at the Porthcawl ground. Subsequently, Porthcawl RFC have become their regular home and have even staged an amateur rugby league international there during 2008 (Wales v Ireland).

===Other sports===
Bridgend has local cricket clubs including Bridgend Town CC and Great Western CC, a men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s hockey club, golf courses, and tennis and bowls facilities at the local club, the Bridgend Lawn Tennis and Bowls Association.
