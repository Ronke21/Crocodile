<text>The Boxcar Children is a children&#x27;s book series originally created and written by the American first-grade school teacher Gertrude Chandler Warner and currently published by Penguin Random House. It was previously published through Albert, Whitman and Company until 2023. Today, the series includes more than 160 titles, with more being released every year. The series is aimed at readers in grades 2–6.

Originally published in 1924 by Rand McNally (as &quot;The Box-Car Children&quot;) and reissued in a shorter revised form in 1942 by Albert Whitman &amp; Company, &quot;The Boxcar Children&quot; tells the story of four orphaned children, Henry, Jessie, Violet, and Benny Alden. They create a home for themselves in an abandoned boxcar in the forest. They eventually meet their grandfather, who is a wealthy and kind man (although the children had believed him to be cruel). The children decide to live with the grandfather, who moves the beloved boxcar to his backyard so the children can use it as a playhouse. The book was adapted as the film &quot;The Boxcar Children&quot; in 2014 and the sequel novel &quot;Surprise Island&quot; was released as a film in 2018. Based on a 2007 online poll, the National Education Association listed the original book as one of its &quot;Teachers&#x27; Top 100 Books for Children&quot;. In 2012 the original novel was ranked among the all-time &quot;Top 100 Chapter Books&quot;, or children&#x27;s novels, in a survey published by &quot;School Library Journal&quot;.

In the subsequent books, the children encounter many adventures and mysteries in their neighborhood or at the locations they visit with their grandfather. The majority of the books are set in locations the children are visiting over school holidays such as summer vacation or Christmas break. Only the first 19 stories were written by creator Warner. Other books in the series have been written by other writers, but always feature the byline &quot;Created by Gertrude Chandler Warner&quot;. While the Alden children age in Warner&#x27;s books, they remain younger in the ones published after her death, with each book set around its publication date.

==Plot summary of the original novel==
The original &quot;Boxcar Children&quot; novel tells a story of four orphaned Alden children, Henry, Jessie, Violet, and Benny. Not wishing to live with their hard-hearted grandfather, whom they have never met because of his disapproval of their parents&#x27; marriage, the children strike out on their own following their parents&#x27; death. On a warm night, the children stop at a bakery to ask for food, where they are invited to stay for the night. When they overhear the baker and his wife are planning to keep the three older children as labor and send Benny to an orphanage, the children decide to escape and flee to the woods instead.

There they sleep on some pine needles. Jessie then sees it is about to rain, and frantically searches for some shelter. At that point, she finds an abandoned boxcar and takes her siblings to it. They all renovate it into their new home. They find useful items such as kitchenware at the junkyard, use a stream for water, and collect blueberries for their meals. They also adopt a stray dog that they name Watch. Realizing they cannot live on water and blueberries, Henry walks to a nearby town called Silver City for work. He meets a young doctor, Dr. Moore, who hires Henry for odd jobs, often paying him in spare food and clothing as well as money. Suspecting that Henry is not telling the full truth about himself, Dr. Moore follows Henry home in secret and sees the children&#x27;s living conditions. He decides that they are safe for now and that he should allow Henry to tell the truth when he feels comfortable. Dr. Moore gifts Henry a hammer and Henry also takes a few nails from the doctor. With the tools, he and his siblings create a swimming pool and a dam in the stream. Henry also makes a cart for Benny.

While Henry was working at Dr. Moore&#x27;s house, Dr. Moore invites Henry to see the Field Day competition. He does not tell Henry that it is conducted by James Henry Alden, the grandfather of the boxcar children. There, Henry hears about a free-for-all race and takes part. Running at his fastest pace, Henry wins the race. He is awarded a silver cup and 25 dollars by James Henry Alden, his grandfather, neither of them recognizing that they are family. Once Henry returns back to his boxcar, his siblings are very glad for him.

At some point, Benny&#x27;s hair begins to grow, so Jessie cuts it with Violet&#x27;s scissors. Benny in turn cuts Watch&#x27;s hair and tries to make a &#x27;J&#x27; symbol. This makes Jessie and Violet laugh very hard. However, Violet falls seriously ill. The siblings don&#x27;t want to go to the hospital because they don’t want to reveal their identity and because they don&#x27;t have enough money to pay at the hospital. Henry runs to Dr. Moore who takes Violet to his own house instead of the hospital. He and Mrs. Moore invite Henry, Jessie and Benny, along with Watch, to stay there as guests.

Meanwhile, the children&#x27;s grandfather, James Henry Alden, has been offering a reward for news of his missing grandchildren. The doctor connects the missing grandchildren with the ones in his care and goes to speak to Alden, warning him that his grandchildren are afraid of him and encouraging him to befriend the children before revealing who he is. Alden is introduced to the children as a friend of the doctor&#x27;s. The children find him warm and friendly; by the time they learn the truth, they are surprised to learn that he is really their &quot;cruel&quot; grandfather and are more than willing to come live with him.

At their grandfather&#x27;s house, the children are happy and well-cared for, but speak fondly of their days in the boxcar. They all miss the boxcar too, especially Benny, who wants his cracked, pink cup. So, as a surprise, Mr. Alden arranges to have the boxcar completely restored, repainted, and moved into his backyard where the children can visit it whenever they like. Mr. Alden gets every single piece, even the old, dead stump that the children used to climb inside. At the end of the novel, the children are very glad and make the boxcar their clubhouse and happily live with their grandfather.

==Characters==
=== Main characters ===
(The characters are named here as they are in the revised edition of the original book, and its sequels. The family name in the 1924 original edition is Cordyce rather than Alden.)

Henry James Alden: is the eldest of the Alden children; in most books of the series, Henry is 14 years old (13 in the 1924 edition). He is shown to be calm, hardworking, rational, humble and very protective of his younger siblings. Henry also shows a knack for repairing things and is a natural athlete. In Warner&#x27;s original books, Henry ages and eventually goes off to college in &quot;The Lighthouse Mystery&quot;.

Jessie Alden: (&quot;Jess&quot; in the 1924 original edition) is usually 12 years old and is the older sister. She often acts motherly towards Benny and Violet and even Henry. She is often responsible for cooking. Jessie is described as being very tidy and organized. She is sometimes called Jess, but is mostly referred to as Jessie. She is not afraid of anything, adores the color blue, and is very strong.

Violet Alden: is 10 years old in most of the books. She is the most sensitive of the children and is skillful at painting and sewing. She can frequently win over grouchy characters and is good with animals. Violet is often very shy and loves playing the violin. Her favorite color is violet or purple and she often wears one of those colors. She is the shyest of all the children, and sometimes helps Jessie take care of Benny.

Benjamin &quot;Benny&quot; Alden: is the youngest child at 6 years old (5 in the original 1924 edition). He celebrates his seventh birthday in &quot;Surprise Island&quot; and continues to age throughout the original series, until he is old enough for a department store job in the last original book, &quot;Benny Uncovers a Mystery.&quot; Benny is known for his love of all food and the cracked pink cup he found in the dump. His endearingly childish qualities and comments along with his enthusiasm make him a favorite among young readers. He loves Watch dearly and Benny was the one who named Watch.

Watch: is the dog of the Boxcar children. He acted as a &quot;watchdog&quot; when they lived in the boxcar and protected them. Watch was originally owned by a wealthy lady but ran away and was adopted by the Alden children. The lady was so charmed by the children that she permitted them to keep him. Watch is a Wire Fox Terrier (an Airedale in the 1924 edition), and the children found him while Henry was away at work. He had a thorn in his paw, and Jessie removed it. Because of this, he became known as her dog. In subsequent books, Watch&#x27;s bed is in Jessie&#x27;s bedroom.

James Henry Alden: is the wealthy and kind grandfather of the Alden children, allowing them a lot of freedom and always offering them advice. He takes care of the kids after the death of their parents. At first, the kids thought their grandfather was mean, and so they ran away from him, but later on, they realized the goodness of their grandfather and came to live with him. James Henry Alden also organizes the Field Day competitions.

Dr. Moore: (Dr. McAllister in the original 1924 edition) is the man who gave Henry a job and checked Violet when she was ill. He is the very same person who connected Henry, Jessie, Violet, Benny and Watch with their grandfather.

===Secondary characters===
Mrs. McGregor: The Alden&#x27;s&#x27; housekeeper. Her husband was first seen in the third book of the series.

Mr. McGregor: He mows the lawn and he is Mr. Alden&#x27;s conductor. He is also married to Mrs. McGregor.

Mike: Mike is Benny&#x27;s best friend and appeared on Surprise Island.

John Joseph &quot;Joe&quot; Alden and Alice: The children&#x27;s cousins/aunt and uncle. (Called both, but mostly cousins) Joe was first seen in the second book of the series, &quot;Surprise Island&quot;. Alice was first introduced in &quot;The Yellow House Mystery&quot;; she also married Joe in the same book. They moved to a new house in &quot;The Mystery of the Singing Ghost&quot;. They adopted Soo Lee from Korea.

Aunt Jane and Uncle Andy: The children&#x27;s great aunt (Grandfather Alden&#x27;s sister) and her husband. Aunt Jane was once unkind, but was changed in &quot;Mystery Ranch&quot;, the fourth book of the series.

John Carter: An employee of the children&#x27;s grandfather. Does investigation and carries out the children&#x27;s grandfather&#x27;s wishes &quot;off camera&quot;. Has a secret soft-spot for Jessie.

Lars Larson: A fun middle-aged man, a friend of Grandfathers, Lars was first seen in (Blue Bay Mystery)

==Animated film==
In April 2014, the animated film &quot;The Boxcar Children&quot; was released. The voice of Grandfather Alden is played by Martin Sheen, and Dr. Moore is voiced by J. K. Simmons. Zachary Gordon, Joey King, Mackenzie Foy, and Jadon Sand voiced Henry, Jessie, Violet, and Benny respectively. The film is also available on DVD.

The film debuted at the Toronto International Film Festival / Kids (TiFF/Kids) in April 2014 and went on to play at 15 more festivals including Woods Hole International Film Festival, St. Louis International Film Festival and the Gijón International Film Festival in Spain. The film won Best Animated Feature Film at the 2015 St. Tropez International Film Festival.

The film was released by Entertainment One. It had a limited theatrical run in North America, came out on DVD and VOD on August 19, 2014. Streaming and TV rights were sold exclusively to Netflix on October 4, 2014. The film was directed and produced by Daniel Chuba and Mark A.Z. Dippe. The executive producer was Maureen Sargent Gorman.

The sequel film, &quot;The Boxcar Children: Surprise Island,&quot; was originally planned to be released in the fall 2017. However, Fathom Events released the film in select theaters starting May 8, 2018, followed by a DVD release on August 14, 2018.

==Series==

After the first novel, the children become amateur sleuths, and the subsequent series involves the children solving various mysteries and occasionally traveling to other locations as they do so. They stumble across a mystery no matter where they are, whether on vacation or in their own backyard. They usually solve the mystery with very little adult intervention, although adults are present in the novel (the author said she wrote about mostly-unsupervised children because that would appeal to children). Some of the mysteries border on the supernatural, although the practical Henry and Jessie always find the sensible reason for anything that appears other-worldly. Most of the mysteries involve thefts and usually involve the Alden children helping someone they know.

The series are divided into mysteries and specials; all of the specials were written after Warner&#x27;s death. , there are 159 mysteries and 21 specials in the series. In 2017, the first Boxcar Children miniseries was published (&quot;Great Adventure&quot;), and since 2021 three more have been written. (&quot;Creatures of Legend&quot;, &quot;Endangered Animals&quot;, and &quot;Summer of Adventure&quot;) In addition, two spin-off series have been released. The first, &quot;The Adventures of Benny and Watch&quot; was published from 1998-2004, and the second, &quot;The Jessie Files&quot;, began in 2022.

In May 2023, original publisher Albert, Whitman and Company sold the rights to the Boxcar Children series to Penguin Random House.

==About the author==
Warner&#x27;s life was chronicled in the biography &quot;Gertrude Chandler Warner and the Boxcar Children&quot; by Mary Ellen Ellsworth, illustrated by Marie DeJohn, which tells the story of Warner&#x27;s childhood living across the street from the railroad tracks, her bouts with poor health, her teaching career, her earliest attempts at writing, and her inspiration for &quot;The Boxcar Children&quot;.

In July 2004, a museum in Putnam, Connecticut, was opened in a red boxcar to honor Gertrude Warner and the Boxcar Children series.

As she wrote the story, Warner read it to her classes and rewrote it many times so the words were easy to understand. Some of her pupils spoke other languages at home and were just learning English, so The Boxcar Children gave them a fun story that was easy to read. Warner once wrote that the original book &quot;raised a storm of protest from librarians who thought the children were having too good a time without any parental control! That is exactly why children like it!&quot;

<doc id="344899" wikidata="Q156137" url="?curid=344899" title="Quercus suber">
<text>Quercus suber, commonly called the cork oak, is a medium-sized, evergreen oak tree in the section &quot;Quercus&quot; sect. &quot;Cerris&quot;. It is the primary source of cork for wine bottle stoppers and other uses, such as cork flooring and as the cores of cricket balls. It is native to southwest Europe and northwest Africa. In the Mediterranean basin the tree is an ancient species with fossil remnants dating back to the Tertiary period. It can survive for as long as two centuries. Typically, once it reaches 25 years old, its thick bark can be harvested for cork every 9 to 12 years without causing harm to the tree.

It endures drought and makes little demand on the soil quality and is regarded as a defence against desertification. Cork oak woodlands are home to a multitude of animal and plant species. Since cork for sealing bottles is increasingly being displaced by other materials, these forests are at risk as part of the cultural landscape and as a result animal species such as the Iberian lynx and imperial eagles are threatened with extinction.

==Description==
===General appearance and bark===
The cork oak grows as an evergreen tree, reaching an average height of or in rare cases up to 25 m and a trunk diameter (DBH) of . It forms a dense and asymmetrical crown that starts at a height of and spreads widely in free-standing trees. The crown can be divided into several separate, rounded partial crowns.

The young twigs are densely hairy light gray or whitish. Older branches are strong and knotty. Older trees only form short shoots between in length.

The thick, longitudinally cracked cork layers of the gray-brown trunk bark are characteristic of the cork oak. The cambium of the smooth bark of young trees forms a cork layer very early on, which can be thick. The light and spongy cork fabric shows vertical cracks and is white on the outside and red to red-brown on the inside. After the cork has been harvested, the trunk appears reddish brown, but later it is significantly darker. The wood is ring-pored, has a brown heartwood and a light reddish sapwood. The cork oak develops a taproot that reaches a depth of and from which several meters long, horizontally running side roots extend. The trees can live over 400 years, and harvested specimens can be 150 to 200 years old.

===Leaves===
The leathery leaves are alternate and are long and wide. The shape varies between round, oval and lanceolate-oval. The leaf blade has five to seven sharp teeth on both edges and a pointed vegetation cone (apex). The midrib stands out clearly on the underside of the leaf, the first-order lateral nerves usually lead to the teeth of the leaf margin. The upper side of the leaf is light green, the underside of the leaf whitish and densely hairy. There is no hair on young trees. The leaf stalks are long and are also hairy. At the base of the petiole are two narrow, lanceolate, long and bright red stipules that fall off in the first year. The new leaves appear in April and May, when older leaves are also shed. They usually stay on the tree for two to three years, less often only one year, the latter especially in severe environmental conditions and on the northern border of the distribution area. Extremely cold winters can also lead to complete defoliation.

===Inflorescence and flower===
The cork oak is single sexed (monoecious), with both female and male flowers on one specimen. The female flowers form upright inflorescences in the leaf axils of young branches. These are formed from a hairy axis long with two to five separate flowers. The female flowers contain a small, hairy, four- to six-lobed flower envelope and three to four styles. The male catkins also arise on the leaf axils of young branches. They are bright red at the beginning and stand upright, older catkins are yellow and pendulous, long and have a whitish hairy axis. The single flowers are sessile and have a densely hairy flower cover that is colored red when opened. The four to six stamens are whitish with yellow, egg-shaped anthers. They are longer than the bracts.

===Infructescence, fruit and seed===
The fruit clusters are long and carry two to eight acorns. About half of the fruits are enclosed in the fruit cup (cupule); the fruit cups are in diameter. The upper scales of the cupula are gray and hairy, in the subspecies &quot;Quercus suber occidentalis&quot; the scales are close together or are fused. The size of the acorns varies between lengths of and diameters of . The fruit casing (pericarp) is bare, smooth and shiny brownish red. The hilum (the starting point of the seed) is convex and has a diameter of .

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Quercus suber&quot; is a species of the section &quot;Cerris&quot; to which, for example, the following species also belong:
*Valonia oak (&quot;Quercus macrolepis&quot;)
*Turkey oak (&quot;Quercus cerris&quot;)
*&quot;Quercus × crenata&quot;
*Macedonian oak (&quot;Quercus trojana&quot;)

Characteristic for the section are the hairless pericarp and the usually two-year ripening time of the fruits. The cork oak is an exception because the fruits can ripen in both the first and the second year.

In the species &quot;Quercus suber&quot; two subspecies are distinguished:

*&quot;Quercus suber&quot; subsp. &quot;suber&quot;: Nominal taxon
*&quot;Quercus suber&quot; subsp. &quot;occidentalis&quot;: It differs from the nominate form in the shape of the cupula scales, the longer development time of the fruits and the semi-evergreen foliage. The distribution area of the subspecies is the Portuguese Atlantic coast.

Together with the Turkey oak (&quot;Quercus cerris&quot;) and the holm oak (&quot;Quercus ilex&quot;), the cork oak forms hybrids.

The scientific name &quot;Quercus suber&quot; is derived from the Latin word &quot;quercus&quot;, which the Romans used to describe the pedunculate oak (&quot;Quercus robur&quot;). The specific epithet &quot;suber&quot; means in Latin cork oak and also cork.

==Distribution and habitat==

The cork oak occupies the area around the western Mediterranean basin. In Portugal, natural and cultivated stands cover an area of 750,000 hectares. There are natural populations of the nominate form at altitudes between above sea level, the subspecies &quot;occidentalis&quot; is found along the Atlantic coast. In Spain the occurrences remain mostly below , but rarely reach heights of . In Spain, cork oaks are common in the southern half of the country, as well as in the western and northeastern areas, but rare in central Spain. In Italy one finds natural occurrences along the Tyrrhenian Sea and in eastern Apulia on the Adriatic Sea. Also on the Adriatic is the cork oak on the Dalmatian coast. It is one of the most common forest trees in Sardinia. Natural and man-made occurrences exist in Africa on the Mediterranean coast of Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco and at altitudes up to , on the High Atlas up to . In its native range, cork oak forests cover approximately . Outside of its natural range, the cork oak is cultivated in the Crimea, the Caucasus, India and the Southwestern United States. The subspecies &quot;Quercus suber occidentalis&quot; also thrives in mild areas of England.

The species needs very little light and cannot survive in dense populations. It loves warmth, grows at annual mean temperatures of and can withstand maximum temperatures of up to . In the area of distribution, the temperature rarely falls below freezing point, but temperatures down to without damage and down to without major damage can be tolerated. The cork oak is not hardy in Central Europe. It endures drought and survives dry periods in summer by reducing its metabolism. An annual rainfall of is considered optimal, in cooler locations can be sufficient with enough humidity. Cork oaks have low soil demands and also grow in poor, dry or rocky locations. They rarely thrive on calcareous soils, but they are often found on crystalline slates, on gneiss, granite and sands. The acidity of the soil should be between pH 4.5 and 7.

The cork oak is considered a pyrophyte because it recovers quickly after forest fires as it is protected by the cork.

The cork oak forest is one of the major plant communities of the Mediterranean woodlands and forests ecoregion. In natural populations, the cork oak grows together with the holm oaks (&quot;Quercus ilex&quot;, &quot;Quercus rotundifolia&quot;), the Portuguese oak (Quercus faginea), the Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica), Mirbeck&#x27;s oak (Quercus canariensis), the maritime pine (&quot;Pinus pinaster&quot;), the stone pine (&quot;Pinus pinea&quot;), the strawberry tree (&quot;Arbutus unedo&quot;) and the olive tree (&quot;Olea europaea&quot;), in cooler locations also with the sweet chestnut (&quot;Castanea sativa&quot;). In addition to these tree species, the shrub-forming species include the Kermes oak (&quot;Quercus coccifera&quot;), the Lusitanian oak (Quercus lusitanica) the holly buckthorn (&quot;Rhamnus alaternus&quot;), species of the genus &quot;Phillyrea&quot;, the myrtle (&quot;Myrtus communis&quot;), the green heather (&quot;Erica scoparia&quot;), the common smilax (&quot;Smilax aspera&quot;) and the Montpellier cistus (&quot;Cistus monspeliensis&quot;) are often found together with the cork oak.

As a pyrophyte, this tree has a thick, insulating bark that makes it well adapted to forest fires. After a fire, many tree species regenerate from seeds (as, for example, the maritime pine) or re-sprout from the base of the tree (as, for example, the holm oak). The bark of the cork oak allows it to survive fires and then simply regrow branches to fill out the canopy. The quick regeneration of this oak makes it successful in the fire-adapted ecosystems of the Mediterranean biome.

=== Symbiosis ===

The cork oak enters into a mycorrhizal symbiosis with several types of fungus. The fine root system of the oak is in close contact with the mycelium of the fungus. The oak receives water and nutrient salts from the fungus in exchange for products of photosynthesis. Such a symbiosis exists among others with the following species:

*Caesar&#x27;s mushroom (&quot;Amanita caesarea&quot;)
*Death cap (&quot;Amanita phalloides&quot;)
*Panther cap (&quot;Amanita pantherina&quot;)
*Gilbert&#x27;s limbed lepidella (&quot;Amanita gilbertii&quot;)
*Cep (&quot;Boletus edulis&quot;)
*&quot;Russula rubra&quot;

=== Diseases and predators ===

Cork oak is relatively resistant to pathogens, but some diseases occur in the species. Leaf spot can be caused by the fungus &quot;Apiognomonia errabunda&quot;. Other fungi can cause leaf scorching, powdery mildew, rust, and cankers.

The most virulent cork oak pathogen may be &quot;Diplodia corticola&quot;, a sac fungus which causes sap-bleeding sunken canker wounds in the wood, withering of the leaves, and lesions on the acorns. The fungus &quot;Biscogniauxia mediterranea&quot; is becoming more common in cork oak forests. Its fruiting bodies appear as charcoal-black cankers. Both of these fungi are transmitted by the oak pinhole borer (&quot;Platypus cylindrus&quot;), a species of weevil.

The common water mould &quot;Phytophthora cinnamomi&quot; grows in the roots of the tree and has been known to devastate cork oak woodlands.

Several species of butterflies damage the cork oak, the most important being the spongy moth (&quot;Lymantria dispar&quot;). The species lays its eggs in the bark of the branches and trunks, and the caterpillars that hatch in spring are distributed in the crown and eat them bare. The bacterial species &quot;Bacillus thuringiensis&quot; is used as a biological plant protection agent against the spongy moth. Another pest is the green oak tortrix (&quot;Tortrix viridana&quot;), whose caterpillars eat flowers and young leaves and roll them up with thread to form typical coils. The lackey moth (&quot;Malacosoma neustria&quot;) also causes damage to the leaves, sticking its eggs to the bark of thin twigs in multiple rows, and also the brown-tail moth (&quot;Euproctis chrysorrhoea&quot;), whose caterpillars skeletonize the leaves and further damage the tree after overwintering in spring. A special cork pest is the jewel beetle &quot;Coraebus undatus&quot;, which lays its eggs in the cork tissue. Another harmful species of beetle is the great capricorn beetle (&quot;Cerambyx cerdo&quot;), whose larvae eat long corridors in the oak wood.

Unfavorable climatic conditions and fungal attack are made responsible for the weakening of trees and for crown damage. Such fungal parasites of weakness are &quot;Botryosphaeria stevensii&quot;, &quot;Biscogniauxia mediterranea&quot;, &quot;Endothiella gyrosa&quot; and representatives of the mold genus &quot;Fusarium&quot;. Drought and parasite infestation are also considered to be the cause of the weakness syndrome in parts of Spain and Portugal.

==Uses==

The cork oak is grown for the production of cork in several Mediterranean countries. The centers of cork production are in southern Portugal (accounting for 50% of the total production) and southern Spain, where low trees with large crowns and strong branches are grown in large areas, which provide the highest yield of cork. These mostly extensively managed habitats are called &quot;montados&quot; in Portugal and &quot;dehesas&quot; in Spain. They are considered to be extremely valuable from the point of view of biodiversity and cultural heritage.

The cork consists of dead, air-filled, thin-walled cells and contains cellulose and suberin. Cork is heat and sound insulating, the suberine gives it water-repellent properties. The cork layer is replicated by the cork-producing phellogen and can therefore be harvested repeatedly without damaging the tree too much. The first harvest usually takes place after about 25 years with a trunk diameter (DBH) of , though new techniques (such as better irrigation systems) could shorten it to only 8 to 10 years. The first cork layer is called &quot;male cork&quot; or &quot;virgin cork&quot;, is still not very elastic and cracked and is only used for insulating mats. The second harvested cork (known as &quot;secundeira&quot;), has a more regular structure and is softer, but is still only used for insulation and in decorative objects. Only the following cork harvests deliver a higher quality cork, the &quot;female cork&quot;, which can be used commercially in full. The best quality cork is obtained from the third and fourth harvest. Cork harvesting takes place every nine to twelve years when a layer thickness of is reached. Under favorable (warm) conditions, the harvest can take place every eight years, in North Africa every seven years. A cork oak can be harvested five to seventeen times in total. In order to minimize the damage to the trunk surface, harvesting can be carried out every three years, whereby only a third of the usable surface is removed. An important maintenance measure is pruning, which begins around the age of ten at a height of about . Some sources say an oak can provide around of cork over its lifespan, and one hectare around per year while others suggest a single tree can produce on average of cork per harvest, a comparatively higher value, as cork oaks can live more than 200 years in good conditions.

The cork is mainly used for the production of stoppers and corks, as well as for heat and sound insulation, cork
paper, badminton shuttlecocks, cricket balls, handles of fishing rods and hand tools, special devices for the space industry and for other technical applications (including composite materials, shoe soles, floor coverings). Bottle cork production accounts for around 70% of the added value in cork cultivation. Since natural corks are increasingly being replaced by plastic or sheet metal closures, there could be a significant decline in the cork oak population in southwestern Europe, which endangers the biodiversity in these areas.

The bark, which contains around twelve percent extractable tannin, is also used. In addition, the acorns are used as feed in extensive pig fattening (acorn fattening), such as for Iberian ham production; although the Holm Oak (Quercus ilex), is preferred for this due to its sweeter fruits. One cork oak tree can provide of acorns per year.

Cork oaks cannot legally be cut down in Portugal, except for forest management felling of old, unproductive trees, and, even in those cases, farmers need special permission from the Ministry of Agriculture.

Cork harvesting is done entirely without machinery, being dependent solely on human labour. Usually five people are required to harvest the tree&#x27;s bark, using a small axe. The process mandates specialized training due to the skill required to harvest bark without inflicting too much damage to the tree.

The European cork industry produces 300,000 tonnes of cork a year, with a value of €1.5 billion and employing 30,000 people. Wine corks represent 15% of cork usage by weight but 66% of revenues.

Cork oaks are sometimes planted as individual trees, providing a minor income to their owners. The tree is also sometimes cultivated for ornament. Hybrids with Turkey oak (&quot;Quercus cerris&quot;) are not uncommon, both where their ranges overlap in the wild in southwest Europe and in cultivation; the hybrid &quot;Quercus&quot; × &quot;hispanica&quot; is known as Lucombe oak, for William Lucombe, who first identified it.

Some cork is also produced in eastern Asia from the related Chinese cork oak (&quot;Quercus variabilis&quot;).

==Culture==
The cork oak is featured in the city arms of several cities in Portugal, such as the city of Reguengos de Monsaraz, which shows a freshly harvested cork tree.

In 2007, a 2 euro commemorative coin with the motif of a cork oak was issued in Portugal in memory of the Portuguese Presidency of the European Union.

=== Notable trees ===
In the Portuguese town of Águas de Moura lies the Sobreiro Monumental (&quot;Monumental Cork Oak&quot;), also known as &#x27;The Whistler Tree&#x27;, a tree 236 years old (planted in 1783/1784), over tall and with a trunk that requires at least three people to embrace it. It has been considered a National Monument since 1988, and Guinness World Records lists it as the largest cork tree in the world.

<doc id="344902" wikidata="Q2000136" url="?curid=344902" title="Softcore pornography">
<text>Softcore pornography or softcore porn is commercial still photography, film, imagery, or even audio that has a pornographic or erotic component but is less sexually graphic or intrusive than hardcore pornography, defined by a lack of sexual penetration or other sexual activity. It typically contains nude or semi-nude actors involved in suggestive poses or scenes, and is intended to be sexually arousing and aesthetically beautiful.

The distinction between softcore pornography and erotic photography, or erotic art such as Vargas girl pin-ups, is largely a matter of debate. When the subject is naked, the image must be differentiated from nude art, and photos belong within the broader category of nude photography.

==Components==
Softcore pornography may include sexual activity between two people or masturbation. It does not contain explicit depictions of sexual penetration, cunnilingus, fellatio, fingering, handjobs, or ejaculation. Depictions of erections of the penis may not be allowed, although attitudes towards this are ever-changing. Commercial pornography can be differentiated from erotica, which has high-art aspirations.

Portions of images that are considered too graphic and may be hidden in a variation of ways, such as the use of covered hair or clothing, particularly positioned hands or other body parts, carefully positioned foreground elements in the scene (often plants, pillows, furniture, or drapery) or carefully chosen camera angles.

Pornographic filmmakers sometimes make both hardcore and softcore types of a films, with the softcore version using less explicit angles of sex scenes or using the other techniques to &quot;tone down&quot; any objectionable feature. The softcore version may, for example, be edited for the in-house hotel pay-per-view market.

Total nudity is commonplace in several magazines, as well as in photography and on the Internet.

==Regulation and censorship==
Softcore films are commonly less regulated and restricted than hardcore pornography, and cater to a different market. In most countries, softcore films are eligible for movie ratings, usually on a restricted rating, though many such films are also released unrated. As with hardcore films, availability of softcore films varies depending on local laws. Also, the exhibition of such films may be restricted to those above a certain age, typically 18. At least one country, Germany, has different age limits for hardcore and softcore pornography, softcore material usually receives a FSK-16 rating (no one under 16 is allowed to buy) and hardcore material receiving a FSK-18 (no one under 18 allowed to buy). In some countries, broadcasting of softcore films is widespread on cable television networks, with some such as Cinemax producing their own in-house softcore films and television series.

In some countries, images of women&#x27;s genitals are digitally manipulated so that they are not too &quot;detailed&quot;. An Australian pornographic actress says that images of her own genitals sold to pornographic magazines in different countries are digitally manipulated to change the size and shape of the labia according to censorship standards in different countries.

==History==
Originally, softcore pornography was presented mainly in the form of men&#x27;s magazines, in both still photos and art drawings (such as Vargas girls), when it was barely acceptable to show a glimpse of a woman&#x27;s nipple in the 1950s. By the 1970s, mainstream magazines such as &quot;Playboy&quot;, &quot;Penthouse&quot;, and especially &quot;Hustler&quot; showcased nudity.

After the formation of the MPAA rating system in the United States and prior to the 1980s, numerous softcore films, with a wide range of production costs, were released to mainstream movie theatres, especially drive-ins. &quot;Emmanuelle&quot; and &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; received positive reviews from noted critics such as Roger Ebert.

<doc id="344903" wikidata="Q5531480" url="?curid=344903" title="Gene Stratton-Porter">
<text>Gene Stratton-Porter (August 17, 1863 – December 6, 1924), born Geneva Grace Stratton, was an American writer, nature photographer, and naturalist from Wabash County, Indiana. In 1917 Stratton-Porter urged legislative support for the conservation of Limberlost Swamp and other wetlands in Indiana. She was also a silent film-era producer who founded her own production company, Gene Stratton Porter Productions, in 1924.

Stratton-Porter wrote several best-selling novels in addition to columns for national magazines, such as &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot;, among others. Her novels have been translated into more than twenty languages, including Braille, and at their peak in the 1910s attracted an estimated 50 million readers. Eight of her novels, including &quot;A Girl of the Limberlost,&quot; were adapted into moving pictures. Stratton-Porter was also the subject of a one-woman play, &quot;A Song of the Wilderness&quot;. Two of her former homes in Indiana are state historic sites, the Limberlost State Historical Site in Geneva and the Gene Stratton-Porter State Historic Site on Sylvan Lake, near Rome City, Indiana.

==Early life and education==
Geneva Grace Stratton, the twelfth and last child of Mary (Shallenberger) and Mark Stratton, was born at the family&#x27;s Hopewell Farm on August 17, 1863, near Lagro in Wabash County, Indiana. Mark Stratton, a Methodist minister and farmer of English descent, and Mary Stratton, a homemaker of German-Swiss ancestry, were married in Ohio on December 24, 1835, relocated to Wabash County, Indiana, in 1838, and settled at Hopewell Farm in 1848. Geneva&#x27;s eleven siblings included Catherine, Mary Ann, Anastasia, Florence, Ada, Jerome, Irvin, Leander, and Lemon, in addition to two sisters, Samira and Louisa Jane, who died at a young age. Geneva&#x27;s married sister, Mary Ann, died in an accident in February 1872; her teenaged brother, Leander, whom Geneva called Laddie, drowned in the Wabash River on July 6, 1872.

In 1874 twelve-year-old Geneva moved to Wabash, Indiana, with her parents and three unmarried siblings. They initially lived in the home of Geneva&#x27;s married sister, Anastasia, and her husband, Alvah Taylor, a lawyer. Geneva&#x27;s mother died on February 3, 1875, less than four months after the move to Wabash. Thereafter, Geneva boarded with various relatives in Wabash until her marriage to Charles Porter in 1886. Geneva, who was also called Geneve during her youth, shortened her name to Gene during her courtship with Porter.
Gene received little formal schooling early in life; however, she developed a strong interest in nature, especially birds. As a young girl, Gene&#x27;s father and her brother, Leander, taught her to appreciate nature as she roamed freely around the family farm, observing animals in their natural habitats and caring for various pets.

When her father shot a red-tailed hawk, she rescued it and nursed it back to health. Her family nicknamed her “Little Bird Woman&quot; and her father gave her “the personal and indisputable ownership of each bird of every description that made its home on his land.”

It was said of Stratton-Porter&#x27;s childhood that she had been &quot;reared by people who constantly pointed out every natural beauty, using it wherever possible to drive home a precept, the child [Stratton-Porter] lived out-of-doors with the wild almost entirely.&quot; After the family moved to Wabash in 1874, Gene attended school on a regular basis and became an avid reader. She also began music lessons in banjo, violin, and piano from her sister, Florence, and received private art lessons from a local instructor. Gene finished all but the final term of her senior year at Wabash High School. Because she was failing her classes, she made the decision on her own to quit, later claiming that she had left school to care for Anastasia, who was terminally ill with cancer and receiving treatment in Illinois.

==Marriage and family==
In 1884 thirty-four-year-old Charles Dorwin Porter saw Gene Stratton during her trip to Sylvan Lake, Indiana, where she was attending the Island Park Assembly, a Chautauqua gathering. Porter, a druggist, was thirteen years older than Stratton, who was not yet twenty-one. After ten months of regularly exchanging letters, the couple met at another gathering at Sylvan Lake, during the summer of 1885. They became engaged in October 1885 and were married on August 21, 1886. Gene Stratton-Porter kept her family surname and added her husband&#x27;s after her marriage.

Charles Porter, who had numerous business interests, became a wealthy and successful businessman. Of Scots-Irish descent, he was the son and oldest child of Elizabeth and John P. Porter, a doctor. Charles owned an interest in a drugstore in Fort Wayne, Indiana, which he sold soon after his marriage, and also owned drugstores in Decatur and Geneva. He also owned and operated farms, a hotel, and a restaurant. Porter and other investors organized the Bank of Geneva in 1895. He also became a Trenton Oil Company investor. At one time he had more than sixty oil wells drilled on his land.

Gene and Charles Porter&#x27;s only child, a daughter, named Jeannette, was born on August 27, 1887, when the Porters were living in Decatur, Indiana. The family moved to Geneva, in Adams County, Indiana, in 1888. Charles pursued various business interests and traveled extensively, while Gene stayed at home. Gene took pride in her family and maintaining a home, but she opposed the restrictive, traditional marriages of her era and grew bored and restless. She maintained her independence through the pursuit of her lifelong interests in nature and birdlife, and began by writing about these subjects to earn her own income. In time, she became an independently wealthy novelist, nonfiction writer, and film producer.

Stratton-Porter had four grandchildren, two granddaughters, and two grandsons. The Porters&#x27; daughter, Jeannette, married G. Blaine Monroe in 1909 and had two daughters: Jeannette Helen Monroe was born on November 27, 1911; Gene Stratton Monroe was born on March 22, 1914, and became a film actor under the stage name Gene Stratton, starring in silent films based on three of her grandmother&#x27;s books. The Monroes divorced in 1920, and then Jeannette and her two daughters moved to Los Angeles, California, to live with Stratton-Porter, who had moved there in 1919. On June 6, 1923, Jeannette married James Leo Meehan, a film producer, who was Stratton-Porter&#x27;s business associate. Meehan attempted to help the daughter Gene Stratton Monroe find work in talking pictures by encouraging her to act on stage at Harold Lloyd&#x27;s showcase, Beverly Hills Little Theatre for Professionals, and naming her in his column for the Motion Picture Herald called &quot;From Hollywood,&quot; saying she wanted more film work, particularly in new films based on her grandmother&#x27;s books.

After the death of her brother, Lemon Stratton, in late 1915, Stratton-Porter became the guardian of his daughter, Leah Mary Stratton. Leah lived with Stratton-Porter for several years after Leah&#x27;s father&#x27;s death.

==Major residences==
In 1888 Stratton-Porter persuaded her husband, Charles, to move their family from Decatur to Geneva in Adams County, Indiana, where he would be closer to his businesses. He initially purchased a small home within walking distance of his drugstore; however, when oil was discovered on his land, it provided the financial resources needed to build a larger home. The Limberlost Cabin at Geneva served as Stratton-Porter&#x27;s home from 1895 to 1913. In 1912, with the profits she made from her best-selling novels and successful writing career, Stratton-Porter purchased property along Sylvan Lake, near Rome City in Noble County, Indiana, and built the Cabin at Wildflower Woods estate, which eventually encompassed . Both of these properties are preserved as state historic sites.

Stratton-Porter moved to southern California in 1919 and made it her year-round residence. She purchased homes in Hollywood and built a vacation home that she named Singing Water on her property on Catalina Island. Floraves, her lavish mountaintop estate in Bel Air, was nearly completed at the time of her death in 1924, but she never lived in it.

===Limberlost Cabin (Geneva, Indiana)===

Construction on a two-story, 14-room, cedar-log Queen Anne style rustic home in Geneva began in 1894 and was completed in 1895. The Porters named their new home the Limberlost Cabin in reference to its location near the Limberlost Swamp, where Stratton-Porter liked to explore and found the inspiration for her writing. Stratton-Porter lived in the cabin until 1913.

While residing in Geneva, Stratton-Porter spent much time exploring, observing nature, sketching, and making photographs at the Limberlost Swamp. She also began writing nature stories and books. The nearby swamp was the setting for two of her most popular novels, &quot;Freckles&quot; (1904) and &quot;A Girl of the Limberlost&quot; (1909). In addition, the swamp was the locale for many of her works of natural history. Stratton-Porter became known as &quot;The Bird Lady&quot; and &quot;The Lady of the Limberlost&quot; to friends and readers.

Between 1888 and 1910, the area&#x27;s wetlands around Stratton-Porter&#x27;s home were drained to reclaim the land for agricultural development and the Limberlost Swamp, along with the flora and fauna that Stratton-Porter documented in her books, was destroyed. In 1912 she purchased property for a new home at Sylvan Lake in Noble County, Indiana. The Porters sold the Limberlost Cabin in 1923. In 1947 the Limberlost Conservation Association of Geneva donated it to the State of Indiana. Designated as the Limberlost State Historic Site, the Indiana State Museum and Historic Sites operates the site as a house museum. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.

===Cabin at Wildflower Woods===


After the Limberlost Swamp was drained and its natural resources developed for commercial purposes, Stratton-Porter sought alternate locations for inspiration. She initially purchased a small home on the north side of Sylvan Lake, near Rome City, in Noble County, Indiana, as a summer home while she looked for property to build a new residence. In 1912 she purchased lakeside property using her own funds and designed and had a new home built there in 1913. Stratton-Porter named her new home the Cabin at Wildflower Woods, which she also called Limberlost Cabin because of its similarity to the Porters&#x27; home in Geneva. While her Sylvan Lake home was under construction, Stratton-Porter found time to write &quot;Laddie&quot; (1913), her sixth novel. She moved into the large, two-story, cedar-log cabin in February 1914; her husband, Charles, who remained at their home in Geneva, commuted to the lakeside property on weekends.

Stratton-Porter assisted in developing the grounds of Wildflower Woods into her private wildlife sanctuary. Its natural setting provided her with the privacy she desired, at least initially; however, her fame attracted too many unwanted visitors and trespassers. The property&#x27;s increasing lack of privacy was one of the reasons that caused her move to California in 1919. Stratton-Porter offered to sell her property to the State of Indiana in 1923 to establish a state nature preserve, but representatives of the state government did not respond. She retained ownership of Wildflower Woods for the remainder of her life. Scenes from a movie based on Stratton-Porter&#x27;s book, &quot;The Harvester&quot;, were filmed there in 1927.

In 1940 the Gene Stratton-Porter Association purchased Wildflower Woods from Stratton-Porter&#x27;s daughter, Jeannette Porter Meehan; in 1946 the association donated the property to the State of Indiana, including the cabin, its formal gardens, orchard, and pond. Designated as the Gene Stratton-Porter State Historic Site, the present-day property, including that were part of her original purchase, is operated by the Indiana State Museum and Historic Sites and open to the public. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. In addition to the cabin, guests can explore a one-acre formal garden, wooded paths, and a wetland and prairie that is undergoing restoration. The Gene Stratton-Porter State Historic Site is supported by the Gene Stratton-Porter Memorial Society, Inc.

===California homes===

Lack of privacy at her home on Sylvan Lake in Indiana was among the reasons for Stratton-Porter&#x27;s move to California. She arrived in southern California in the fall of 1919, intending to spend the winter months there, but enjoyed it so much that she decided to make it her year-round home. Stratton-Porter enjoyed an active social life in the Los Angeles area, made new friends, began to publish her poetry, and continued to write novels and magazine articles. In 1924 she also established her own film production company.

Stratton-Porter initially purchased a small home between Second and Third Streets in Hollywood, not far from where her Stratton relatives lived. (Stratton-Porter&#x27;s sister, Catherine, and two of Stratton-Porter&#x27;s nieces were already living in southern California when she moved there. Her brother, Jerome, and his wife later retired nearby.) In 1920, when Stratton-Porter&#x27;s recently divorced daughter, Jeannette, and Stratton-Porter&#x27;s two granddaughters relocated to California to live with her, she purchased a larger home at the corner of Serrano and Fourth Street, while Charles remained at Geneva, still active in the town&#x27;s bank. After the Porters sold the Limberlost Cabin in 1923, he stayed at a Geneva boardinghouse when he was not traveling. 
In early 1924 Stratton-Porter purchased two lots on Catalina Island to build a 14-room vacation retreat. The grounds of the property included a fountain constructed of local stone and seashells. Stratton-Porter moved into the wildlife haven in June 1924 and named it Singing Water because of the sounds emitting from the elaborate fountain. She completed her last novel, &quot;The Keeper of the Bees&quot; (1925) at Catalina Island in 1924.
By March 1924 Stratton-Porter had selected a site for an estate home in southern California in an undeveloped area west of present-day Beverly Hills that became Bel Air. Stratton-Porter was the first to build a residence there. The 22-room, English Tudor-style mansion included approximately of living space and was set on a small mountaintop. The property also included a 4-car garage with servants&#x27; quarters above it, a greenhouse, outdoor ponds, and a tennis court. Stratton-Porter named her estate Floraves for flora (meaning flowers) and aves (meaning birds). She died on December 6, 1924, a few weeks before the home was completed. Her daughter, Jeannette, was the sole heir of her mother&#x27;s estate.

==Job/Career==
While her marriage to Charles Porter provided financial security and personal independence, Gene sought additional roles beyond those of wife and mother. She took up writing in 1895 as an outlet for self-expression and as a means to earn her own income. Stratton-Porter felt that as long as her work did not interfere with the needs of her family, she was free to pursue her own interests. She began her literary career by observing and writing about birdlife of the upper Wabash River valley and the nature she had seen during visits to the Limberlost Swamp, less than a mile from her home in Geneva, Indiana. The Limberlost Swamp, the Limberlost Cabin at Geneva, and after 1913, the Cabin at Wildflower Woods at Sylvan Lake in northeastern Indiana became the laboratories for her nature studies and the inspiration for her short stories, novels, essays, photography, and movies.

Stratton-Porter wrote twenty-six books that included twelve novels, eight nature studies, two books of poetry, and four collections of stories and children&#x27;s books. Of the fifty-five books selling one million or more copies between 1895 and 1945, five of them were novels written by Stratton-Porter. Among Stratton-Porter&#x27;s best-selling novels were &quot;Freckles&quot; (1904), &quot;A Girl of the Limberlost&quot; (1909), &quot;The Harvester&quot; (1911), &quot;Laddie&quot; (1913), and &quot;Michael O&#x27;Halloran&quot; (1915). Stratton-Porter incorporated everyday occurrences and acquaintances into her works of fiction. Many of her works delve into difficult subject matter such as themes of abuse, prostitution, and abandonment. In the case of &quot;Her Father&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1921), the anti-Asian sentiment that her writing reflected was prevalent in the United States during that era. Her other writing also introduced the concept of land and wildlife conservation to her readers.

Although Stratton-Porter preferred to focus on nature books, it was her romantic novels that gained her fame and wealth. Although, she often did create an irrefutable link between nature and romance in her plotlines; nature often represents a comfort for her characters, as she felt it was for her as a child. These romantic novels generated the income that allowed her to pursue her nature studies. Her novels have been translated into twenty-three languages, as well as Braille. At its peak in the early 1910s, her readership was estimated at 50 million, with earnings from her literary works estimated at $2 million.

===Author===
====Early years====
Stratton-Porter began her career in 1895, when she sent nature photographs that she had made to &quot;Recreation&quot; magazine. Her first published article, &quot;A New Experience in Millinery,&quot; appeared in the publication&#x27;s February 1900 issue. The article described her concerns about harming birds in order to use their feathers as hat trims. At the magazine&#x27;s request, Stratton-Porter also wrote a photography column called &quot;Camera Notes.&quot; In July 1901 she switched to doing similar work for &quot;Outing&quot;, a natural history magazine. Stratton-Porter was soon submitting short stories and nature-related material to magazines on a regular basis with increasing success. Her first short story, &quot;Laddie, the Princess, and the Pie,&quot; was published in &quot;Metropolitan&quot; magazine in September 1901. To attract a wider audience Stratton Porter decided to include fictional elements in her nature writing and began writing novels. Stratton-Porter&#x27;s writing also included poetry and children&#x27;s stories, in addition to essays and editorials that were published in magazines with nationwide circulation such as &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot;.

====Novels====
Although it was published anonymously in 1893, circumstantial evidence suggests that Stratton-Porter&#x27;s first book was &quot;The Strike at Shane&#x27;s.&quot; However, Stratton-Porter never acknowledged that she had written it and its author was never revealed.

Bobbs-Merrill published her first, full-length attributed novel, &quot;The Song of the Cardinal&quot; (1903), about a red bird living along the Wabash River. The book explained how birds lived in the wild and also included her photographs. Although the novel was a modest commercial success and was warmly received by literary critics, Stratton-Porter&#x27;s publisher believed that nature stories would not become as popular as romance novels. For her second novel, Stratton-Porter decided to combine nature and romance. &quot;Freckles&quot; (1904), which was published by Doubleday, Page and Company, became a bestseller. The book&#x27;s popularity among readers helped to launch her career as a successful novelist, despite its lackluster reviews from critics.
&quot;A Girl of the Limberlost&quot; (1909), which was highly successful and her best-known work, brought her worldwide recognition. Its central character, Elnora Comstock, a lonely, poverty-stricken girl living on a farm in Adams County, goes to the Limberlost Swamp to escape from her troubles and earns money to pay for her education by collecting and selling moth specimens. The main character&#x27;s strong, individualistic nature are similar to Stratton-Porter&#x27;s. Literary critics called the novel a &quot;well written&quot; and &quot;wholesome story.&quot; Initial sales of her third novel, &quot;At the Foot of the Rainbow&quot; (1907), about two friends who enjoy fishing and trapping, were &quot;disappointing,&quot; but Stratton-Porter reached the peak of her popularity with the publication of her next novel, &quot;The Harvester&quot; (1911), which centers around David Langston, who harvests and in turn sells medicinal herbs, and his love interest, Ruth Jameson, who embodies his ideal partner. It reached number one on the best-seller list in 1912.

&quot;Freckles&quot; (1904), &quot;A Girl of the Limberlost&quot; (1909), and &quot;The Harvester&quot; (1911) are set in the wooded wetlands and swamps of northeast Indiana. Stratton-Porter loved the area and its wildlife and had documented them extensively. Inexpensive reprints of &quot;Freckles&quot; and &quot;A Girl of the Limberlost&quot; brought Stratton-Porter to the public&#x27;s attention in the United States as well as abroad. Translations of her book into other languages also increased her international audience. In 1910, when Stratton-Porter reached a long-term agreement with Doubleday, Page and Company to publish her books, she agreed to provide one manuscript each year, alternating between novels and nonfiction nature books.

Stratton-Porter&#x27;s next novel, &quot;Laddie: A True Blue Story&quot; (1913), another of her best-selling novels, included elements that corresponded to her early life. It was written while she supervised construction of her home at Sylvan Lake in Noble County, Indiana, and she described it as her most autobiographical novel. The narrative is told in the first person by the twelfth child of the &quot;Stanton&quot; family. The title character is modeled after Stratton-Porter&#x27;s deceased older brother, Leander, whom Stratton-Porter nicknamed Laddie. As in Stratton-Porter&#x27;s own family, Laddie is connected with the land and identifies with their father&#x27;s vocation of farming.

&quot;Michael O&#x27;Halloran&quot; (1915), her seventh novel, was inspired by a newsboy she had encountered in Philadelphia, while visiting her daughter, Jeannette, and her family. &quot;A Daughter of the Land&quot; (1918), her next novel, did not sell as well as her earlier works. Over time, sales of Stratton-Porter&#x27;s novels had slowly declined and by 1919 her status as a best-selling author began to fade. Undeterred, she continued to write until her death in 1924.

&quot;Her Father&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1921), one of Stratton-Porter&#x27;s last novels, was set in southern California, outside Los Angeles, where she had moved around 1920. The novel is especially biased against immigrants of Asian descent. Judith Reick Long, one of Stratton-Porter&#x27;s biographers, stated that World War I-era racial prejudice and nativism were prevalent in the United States and it was not unusual to be anti-Asian in southern California at that time. Barbara Olenyik Morrow, another of her biographers, explained that the book was intentionally playing to the era&#x27;s ethnic prejudices. &quot;The Literary Review&quot;, ignoring its anti-Asian content, noted its &quot;wholesome charm.&quot;

&quot;The White Flag&quot; (1923), criticized as an old-fashioned melodrama, failed to make the bestseller list; however, the story was serialized in &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot; magazine beginning in 1923, in advance of the book&#x27;s release. By the time of its publication, Stratton-Porter&#x27;s interests had shifted toward filmmaking.

&quot;The Keeper of the Bees&quot; (1925) and &quot;The Magic Garden&quot; (1927) were the last of Stratton-Porter&#x27;s novels completed before her death. Both of them were written at her home on Catalina Island and published posthumously. &quot;The Keeper of the Bees&quot; is a story about a World War I veteran who regains his heath through the restorative &quot;power and beauty of nature.&quot; The story was serialized in &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot; magazine from February through September 1925 and was published in book form later that year. &quot;The Magic Garden&quot;, about a girl of divorced parents, was written for her two granddaughters, whose parents divorced when they were young. Filmmaker James Leo Meehan, Stratton-Porter&#x27;s business partner and son-in-law, wrote a screenplay of the novel shortly after Stratton-Porter had completed the manuscript.

Millions of copies of Stratton-Porter&#x27;s novels were sold and most of them became best sellers, but the literary establishment criticized them as &quot;unrealistic,&quot; &quot;too virtuous,&quot; and &quot;idealistic.&quot; Despite the criticisms, she was popular among readers of her novels. Stratton-Porter once claimed, &quot;Time, the hearts of my readers, and the files of my publisher will find me my ultimate place.&quot;

====Nature books====

Stratton-Porter, a keen observer of nature, wrote eight nonfiction nature books that were moderate sellers compared to her novels. &quot;What I Have Done With Birds&quot; (1907) first appeared as a six-month illustrated series for the &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot; from April to August 1906. The Bobbs-Merrill Company published the material in book format that also includes Stratton-Porter&#x27;s photographs. &quot;Birds of the Bible&quot; (1909), an illustrated reference book published by Jennings and Graham of Cincinnati, included eighty-one of Stratton-Porter&#x27;s photographs. Both of these nature books were slow sellers. &quot;Music of the Wild&quot; (1910), also published by Jennings and Graham, warned of the adverse effects that the destruction of trees and swamps would have on rainfall. Her warnings appeared nearly two decades before the Dust Bowl of the 1930s and well in advance of present-day environmental concerns about climate change.

&quot;Moths of the Limberlost&quot; (1912), the nature book of which Stratton-Porter was &quot;most proud,&quot; was dedicated to Neltje Blanchan, a fellow nature writer and the wife of her publisher, Frank Nelson Doubleday. Prior to her move to California in 1919, Stratton-Porter completed the manuscript for &quot;Homing with the Birds&quot; (1919). Praised for its content, it described birdlife using easy-to-understand language for the general public. &quot;Wings&quot; (1923) was published a year before her death; &quot;Tales You Won&#x27;t Believe&quot; (1925) was published posthumously.

While literary critics called her novels overly sentimental, academics dismissed her nature writing because they felt that her research methods were unscientific. Stratton-Porter, who was not a trained scientist, centered her field research on her own interests in observing the domestic behavior of wild birds, such as their nest-building, diets, and social behavior. Her writing tried to explain nature in ways that her readers could understand and avoided scientific jargon and tedious, dry statistics.

====Magazine articles====
Stratton-Porter regularly contributed articles and photographs to magazines that included &quot;Metropolitan&quot;, &quot;Recreation&quot;, &quot;Outing&quot;, &quot;Country Life in America&quot;, and &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot;. After her move to California in 1919, Stratton-Porter wrote articles for the Izaak Walton League&#x27;s publication, &quot;Outdoor America&quot;, and a thirteen-part series of nature articles for &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot;. She also agreed to write a series of editorials for &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot; magazine in a monthly column called the &quot;Gene Stratton-Porter&#x27;s Page,&quot; beginning in January 1922. &quot;Tales You Won&#x27;t Believe&quot; (1925), a collection of articles that Stratton-Porter had written for &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot;, and &quot;Let Us Highly Resolve&quot; (1927), a collection of essays that had appeared in &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot; magazine, were published after her death.

====Children&#x27;s stories and poetry====
&quot;Morning Face&quot; (1916), a collection of children&#x27;s stories that also included her photographs, was dedicated to her granddaughter, Jeannette Monroe, whom Stratton-Porter had nicknamed &quot;Morning Face.&quot; &quot;Symbols,&quot; her first poem to appear in a national magazine, was published in &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot; in January 1921. &quot;The Fire Bird&quot; (1922), a Native American tragedy, was the first of her long narrative poems to be published in book form. Its sales were weak and it was not well received by literary critics. In 1922 &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot; published Stratton-Porter&#x27;s poem, &quot;Euphorbia,&quot; in three installments and paid her $12,500, &quot;the most she had ever received for her poetry.&quot; &quot;Jesus of the Emerald&quot; (1923), another of her long narrative poems, describes Tiberius Caesar&#x27;s search for details of Jesus&#x27;s works and appearance. Stratton-Porter explains her religious beliefs in the afterword of the book.

===Nature photographer===
In addition to writing, Stratton-Porter was an accomplished artist and wildlife photographer, specializing in the birds and moths that lived in the Limberlost Swamp, one of the last of the wetlands of the lower Great Lakes Basin. She also made sketches of her observations as part of her fieldwork. Stratton-Porter was especially noted for her close-up photographs of wildlife in their natural habitat. In one of her early photographic studies, she documented the development of a black vulture over a period of three months. Stratton-Porter reported in &quot;What I Have Done with Birds&quot; (1907) that the effort &quot;yielded me the only complete series of Vulture studies ever made.&quot;

Stratton-Porter began photographing birds in the Limberlost Swamp and along the Wabash River near her home in Geneva, Indiana, after her husband, Charles, and daughter, Jeannette, presented her with a camera as a Christmas gift in 1895. She submitted some of her early photographs to &quot;Recreation&quot; magazine in the late 1890s and wrote a regular camera column for the publication in 1901. &quot;Outing&quot; magazine hired her to do similar work in 1902. Unhappy with images the magazine editors suggested to accompany her writing, she began to submit her own photographs as illustrations for her articles. She also preferred to use her own photographs to illustrate her nature books. Thirteen of her wildlife photographs were published in 1900 in the &quot;American Annual of Photography&quot;, which also included her views on her fieldwork. Many of the photographs in &quot;Music of the Wild&quot; (1910) were taken at her Sylvan Lake home in northeastern Indiana.

Stratton-Porter preferred to photograph wildlife in their natural environment. Although she hired men to help transport her cumbersome camera equipment into the field for photo shoots, she preferred to work alone. Occasionally, her husband accompanied her into the field. As Stratton-Porter gained more experience, she acquired better camera equipment, including a custom-made camera that used eight-by-ten-inch glass photographic plates. Stratton-Porter believed that the larger plates provided her with more detailed photographs of her subjects. She also developed her photographic plates in a darkroom she set up in the bathroom at Limberlost Cabin, her family&#x27;s home in Geneva, Indiana, and later in her darkroom at the Cabin at Wildflower Woods along Sylvan Lake.

===Naturalist and conservationist===
Through her writing and photography, Stratton-Porter demonstrated &quot;her strong desire to instill her love of nature in others in order to improve their lives and preserve the natural world.&quot; She also opposed the destruction of wetlands developed for commercial use. After the turn of the twentieth century, when the Limberlost Swamp&#x27;s trees were cut for timber and its shrubs and vines were killed, the resulting commercial development, which included oil drilling, destroyed its wildlife. The swamp was drained into the Wabash River.

In 1917 Stratton-Porter became more active in the conservation movement when the Indiana General Assembly passed legislation to allow drainage of state-owned swamps in Noble and LaGrange Counties. She joined with others to urge the state legislature to repeal the law that would lead to the destruction of wetlands in northeastern Indiana. Although the law was repealed in 1920, the area&#x27;s swamps were eventually drained.

In 1922 Stratton-Porter became a founding member of the Izaak Walton League, a national conservation group, and joined its efforts to save the wild elk at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, from extinction. Stratton-Porter called on the readers of &quot;Outdoor America&quot;, the league&#x27;s publication, to take prompt action. She was also a strong advocate of land and wetland conservation. As she wrote in an essay, &quot;All Together, Heave,&quot; for &quot;Outdoor America&quot; in 1922, &quot;If we do not want our land to dry up and blow away, we must replace at least part of our trees&quot; and urged conservation of American waterways.

===Movie producer===
Stratton-Porter, a &quot;pioneer&quot; in the Hollywood film industry, was dissatisfied with the movie adaptation of her novels by movie studios. Because she wanted more control over the production work, Stratton-Porter expanded her business ventures to include her own production studio to make moving pictures based on her novels. Eight of her novels have been made into movies.

Paramount Pictures produced &quot;Freckles&quot;, the first film based on her novels in 1917, but Stratton-Porter was unhappy with the movie because it did not closely follow her novel and decided to make her own. Stratton-Porter&#x27;s first filmmaking effort was made with Thomas H. Ince on &quot;Michael O&#x27;Halloran&quot; (1923). Stratton-Porter supervised the filming and assisted the principal director, James Leo Meehan. Her daughter, Jeannette, wrote the screenplay. 
In 1924 Stratton-Porter formed her own movie studio and production company. Gene Stratton-Porter Productions created moving pictures that were closely based on her novels. Before her death in December 1924, Stratton-Porter&#x27;s production company had produced two films, &quot;Michael O&#x27;Halloran&quot; (1923) and &quot;A Girl of the Limberlost&quot; (1924), and she had completed her novel &quot;The Keeper of the Bees&quot; for a third film. Stratton-Porter&#x27;s studio filmed &quot;The Harvester&quot; (1927) at her Wildflower Woods estate in northeastern Indiana. Film Booking Offices of America released the movies produced by Stratton-Porter&#x27;s studio. None of these FBO-released films are known to survive.

Stratton-Porter&#x27;s stories remained popular among filmmakers after her death. RKO Pictures, a successor to Film Booking Offices, made &quot;Freckles&quot; and &quot;Laddie&quot; in 1935. Monogram Pictures made &quot;A Girl of the Limberlost&quot; (1934), &quot;Keeper of the Bees&quot; (1935), and &quot;Romance of the Limberlost&quot; (1938). Republic Pictures released &quot;The Harvester&quot; (1936) and &quot;Michael O&#x27;Halloran&quot; (1937). The original negatives and 35mm prints of these early films are unlikely to have survived; however, some 16mm versions created for television have been acquired by private collectors.

&quot;A Girl of the Limberlost&quot; was adapted four times for film. First, as a silent film produced by Stratton-Porter&#x27;s production company in 1924 with Gloria Grey in the title role. The 1934 version was directed by W. Christy Cabanne and its cast included Marian Marsh in the starring role and silent-era film stars Henry B. Walthall, Betty Blythe, and Louise Dresser, an Indiana native. The 1945 version included Ruth Nelson. The 1990, made-for-television movie starred Joanna Cassidy as Stratton-Porter. &quot;Romance of the Limberlost&quot; (1938), directed by William Nigh, featured Indiana actress Marjorie Main in the role of the mean stepmother.

&quot;The Keeper of the Bees&quot; was adapted four times as a movie. It was first released a silent film in 1925, starring Robert Frazer; in 1935 as a Monogram film starring Neil Hamilton; in 1942 for Columbia Pictures; and as &quot;Keeper of the Bees&quot; in a 1947 adaptation that was loosely based on the original novel. Stratton-Porter&#x27;s granddaughter, Gene Stratton Monroe, appeared 1925 version in the role of Little Scout.

==Later years==
In later 1918, after years of years of strenuous work outdoors, battling with the Indiana state government to protect the state&#x27;s wetlands, and worrying over the events of World War I, fifty-four-year-old Stratton-Porter checked into Clifton Springs Sanitarium and Clinic, a health retreat for the famous in New York. She recuperated at the resort for a month before returning to her home at Wildflower Woods and taking up new challenges as a poet, filmmaker, and editorialist. In 1919, after recovering from a serious bout of influenza and completing &quot;Homing with the Birds&quot; (1919), she decided to move to Los Angeles, California. Southern California&#x27;s more temperate climate and increased social activities appealed to her. From her California home, Stratton-Porter continued to write novels and poetry, in addition a series of articles for &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot; magazine. In 1924 she founded Gene Stratton-Porter Productions, Inc., one of the first female-owned studios, and worked with film director James Leo Meehan to create films based on her novels.

With increased business dealings and enjoying the company of many writers, artists, sculptors, and musicians, Stratton-Porter decided to establish her permanent residence in southern California. Although she retained her home at Sylvan Lake in Indiana, the Porters sold the Limberlost Cabin in Geneva, Indiana, in 1923. At the time of her death in 1924, Stratton-Porter owned Wildflower Woods in Indiana, a year-round home in Los Angeles, a vacation home on Catalina Island, and was constructing a mansion in Bel Air, California.

==Death and legacy==
Stratton-Porter died on December 6, 1924, at the age of sixty-one, in Los Angeles, California, of injuries received in a traffic accident. Her car, driven by her chauffeur, collided with a streetcar while she was en route to visit her brother, Jerome. Stratton-Porter was thrown from the vehicle and died at a nearby hospital less than two hours later of a fractured pelvis and crushed chest. Her private funeral was held on December 11 at her South Serrano Street home in Hollywood, California. Stratton-Porter&#x27;s remains were held in a temporary burial vault until 1934 and then interred at Hollywood Memorial Park Cemetery.

Stratton-Porter&#x27;s husband, Charles Porter, died in 1926 and was buried in his hometown of Decatur, Indiana; their daughter, Jeannette Porter Meehan, died in California in 1977. In 1999 Stratton-Porter&#x27;s two grandsons, James and John Meehan, arranged to move Stratton-Porter&#x27;s remains, along with those of their mother, Jeannette Porter Meehan, to Indiana. The women&#x27;s remains are interred on the grounds of the Gene Stratton-Porter State Historic Site at Sylvan Lake.

Stratton-Porter&#x27;s two former residences in Indiana, the Limberlost Cabin
in Geneva and the Cabin at Wildflower Woods near Rome City, have been acquired by the State of Indiana and designated as state historic sites to honor her work and relate the story of her life. The Indiana State Museum and Historic Sites operates the two properties as house museums; both of them are open to the public.

Because Stratton-Porter wrote in advance of her publishing deadlines, &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot; magazine had enough of her material to continue publishing her monthly column, the &quot;Gene Stratton-Porter Page,&quot; in its magazine until December 1927, three years after her death. &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot; and &quot;American Magazine&quot; also published posthumously other articles that Stratton-Porter had written. In addition, four of her books were published posthumously: two novels, &quot;The Keeper of the Bees&quot; (1925) and &quot;The Magic Garden&quot; (1927), and two collections of her articles and essays, &quot;Tales you Won&#x27;t Believe&quot; (1925) and &quot;Let Us Highly Resolve&quot; (1927). More recently, Indiana University Press reissued eight of Stratton-Porter&#x27;s novels in the 1980s and 1990s, including &quot;A Girl of the Limberlost&quot;, which remains &quot;among her best-loved novels&quot;; Kent State University Press published a compilation of Stratton-Porter&#x27;s poetry, &quot;Field o’ My Dreams: The Poetry of Gene-Stratton Porter&quot; (2007).

Stratton-Porter&#x27;s nature photographs, correspondence, books, and magazine articles, among other materials, are housed at several repositories, including the Indiana State Library, the Indiana State Museum, and the Indiana Historical Society in Indianapolis; the Lilly Library at Indiana University in Bloomington; the Bracken Library at Ball State University in Muncie; and the Geneva branch of the Adams Public Library in Geneva, Indiana, and elsewhere.

Bertrand F. Richards, a Stratton-Porter biographer, called her &quot;one of the best-selling writers of the first quarter of the twentieth century.&quot; She is best known for her novels and nature books; however, her poetry, children&#x27;s books, and numerous essays, editorials, and monthly columns for magazines such as &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot; are not well known today. After her move to southern California in 1919, Stratton-Porter also became one of Hollywood&#x27;s first female producers and in 1924 was among the first women to form her own production company.

Stratton-Porter, who is remembered for her ambition and individualism, was also a passionate nature lover who encouraged people to explore nature and the outdoors. She especially loved birds and did extensive studies of moths. Among her lasting legacies is her early and outspoken advocacy for nature conservation. Stratton-Porter supported efforts to preserve wetlands, such as the Limberlost Swamp, and saving the wild elk at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, from extinction. She also recognized the impact that cutting down trees would have on climate change and encouraged Americans to preserve the environment. As the Izaak Walton League paid tribute to her work in its publication, &quot;Outdoor America&quot;, following her death, &quot;if we can write her epitaph in terms of clean rivers, clean outdoor playgrounds, and clean young hearts, we shall have done what she would have asked.&quot;

==Biographical play==
&quot;A Song in the Wilderness&quot;, a one-woman show written by Larry Gard and first performed in 1993, offers a dramatic exploration of Stratton-Porter&#x27;s life and experiences. The 40-45 minute play was written for Gard&#x27;s wife, actress Marcia Quick Gard, and financed by an Indiana Humanities Council grant. The play toured Indiana each spring from 1993 through 1997 and was performed in numerous Indiana towns. In March 2002 the Carpenter Science Theatre Company produced a production of the play at the Eureka Theatre in Richmond, Virginia, directed by Gard and featuring Quick in the title role.

A spring 2017 performance of the play had been scheduled in the Rhoda B. Thalhimer Theater at the Science Museum of Virginia in Richmond, but Quick died December 16, 2016. Kerrigan Sullivan, a Richmond-based actress, was cast to play the role of Stratton-Porter. Playwright Gard, director Jones, and actress Sullivan dedicated the subsequent performances to Quick&#x27;s memory. The play was also performed at the Cat Theater at St. Catherine&#x27;s School for Girls in Richmond and TheaterLab, also in Richmond. In addition, the play was performed at the University of Notre Dame&#x27;s DeBartolo Performing Arts Center in conjunction with the Notre Dame Shakespeare Festival and the Limberlost Theatre Company in 2017. The Friends of the Limberlost presented the play in Fort Wayne, Indiana, also in 2017.

<doc id="344907" wikidata="Q1571679" url="?curid=344907" title="Halley Research Station">
<text>Halley Research Station is a research facility in Antarctica on the Brunt Ice Shelf operated by the British Antarctic Survey (BAS). The base was established in 1956 to study the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Measurements from Halley led to the discovery of the ozone hole in 1985.
The current base is the sixth in a line of structures and includes design elements intended to overcome the challenge of building on a floating ice shelf without being buried and crushed by snow. , the base has been left unstaffed through winter since 2017, due to concerns over the propagation of an ice crack and how this might cut off the evacuation route in an emergency. 

The Halley Bay Important Bird Area with its emperor penguin colony lies in the vicinity of the base.

==History==
Halley Bay base was founded in 1956, for the International Geophysical Year of 1957–1958, by an expedition from the Royal Society. The bay where the expedition decided to set up their base was named after the astronomer Edmond Halley. Taken over by FIDS (subsequently BAS), it was designated as Base Z. The name was changed to Halley in 1977 as the original bay had disappeared because of changes in the ice shelf.

In 2002, BAS realised that a calving event was possible which could destroy Halley V, so a competition was undertaken to design a replacement station. The current base, Halley VI, officially opened in February 2013 after a test winter. It is the world&#x27;s first fully relocatable terrestrial research station.

On 30 July 2014, the station lost its electrical and heating supply during record low temperatures (as low as -55°C), due to coolant leakage. Plans were made to evacuate some of the eight modules and to shelter in the remaining few that still had heat. Power was partially restored 19 hours later, but all science activities, apart from meteorological observations essential for weather forecasting, were suspended for the season.

==The buildings==

As with the German Neumayer Station III, the base floats on an ice shelf in the Weddell Sea rather than being built on solid land of the continent of Antarctica. This ice shelf is slowly moving towards the open ocean and, if not relocated, each base would eventually calve off into a drifting iceberg.

There have been five previous bases called Halley. Various construction methods have been tried, from unprotected wooden huts to buildings within steel tunnels. The first four all became buried by snow accumulation and crushed until they were uninhabitable.

===Halley I===
* Built: 1956
** 1956: Main structure
** 1961: Main living hut
** 1964: Office block on surface
* Abandoned: 1968
* Structure: Timber hut

===Halley II===
* Built: 1967
* Abandoned: 1973
* Structure: A series of wooden huts
** The roofs were reinforced with steel supports to help support the weight of the snow but the station still had to be abandoned in 1973, after just six years.

===Halley III===
* Built: 1973
* Abandoned: 1983
** In 10 years the base was buried below the surface and access and ventilation problems led to its abandonment. Years later it emerged from the ice cliff at the sea.
* Structure: Built inside Armco steel tubing designed to take the snow loadings building up over it

===Halley IV===
* Built: 1983
* Abandoned: 1994
* Structure: 
** Two-storey buildings constructed inside four interconnected plywood tubes with access shafts to the surface. The tubes were in diameter and consisted of insulated reinforced panels designed to withstand the pressures of being buried in snow and ice.

===Halley V===

* Built: completed 1990, operational 1989
* Demolished: late 2012
** Once its successor, Halley VI, was operational, Halley V was demolished.
* Structure: 
** Main buildings were built on steel platforms that were raised annually to keep them above the snow surface.
** Stilts were fixed on the flowing ice shelf so it eventually became too close to the calving edge.
** Lawes platform: Main platform
** Drewry summer accommodation: Two-storey building was on skis and could be dragged to a new higher location each year.
*** The Drewry block was later moved to join the Halley VI base
** Simpson Building (Ice and Climate Building) (ICB): On stilts and was raised each year to counteract the buildup of snow
*** It housed the Dobson ozone spectrophotometer used to discover the hole in the ozone layer.
** Piggott platform (Space Science Building): Used for upper atmosphere research.

=== Halley VI ===
* Built: Over four summers, first operational data 28 February 2012, officially opened 2013.
* Structure: Modular
* Cost: Approximately £26 million
Halley VI is a string of eight modules which, like Halley V, are jacked up on hydraulic legs to keep it above the accumulation of snow. Unlike most of Halley V, there are retractable giant skis on the bottom of these legs, which allow the building to be relocated periodically.

The Drewry summer accommodation building and the garage from Halley V were dragged to the Halley VI location and continue to be used. The Workshop and Storage Platform (WASP) provides storage for field equipment and a workshop for technical services. There are six external science cabooses which house scientific equipment for each experiment spread across the site and the Clean Air Sector Laboratory (CASLab) from the station.

==== Design competition ====
An architectural design competition was launched by RIBA Competitions and the British Antarctic Survey in June 2004 to provide a new design for Halley VI. The competition was entered by a number of architectural and engineering firms. The winning design, by Faber Maunsell and Hugh Broughton Architects was chosen in July 2005.

Halley VI was built in Cape Town, South Africa. The first sections were shipped to Antarctica in December 2007. They were assembled next to Halley V, then dragged one-by-one to the intended final location and connected.

Halley VI was officially opened in Antarctica on 5 February 2013. Kirk Watson, a filmmaker from Scotland, recorded the building of the station over a four-year period for a short film. A description of the engineering challenges and the creation of the consortium was provided by Adam Rutherford to coincide with an exhibition in Glasgow.

==== Design elements ====
A focus of the new architecture was the desire to improve the living conditions of the scientists and staff on the station. Solutions included consulting a colour psychologist to create a special colour palette to offset the more than 100 days of darkness each year, daylight simulation lamp alarm clocks to address biorhythm issues, the use of special wood veneers to imbue the scent of nature and address the lack of green growth, as well as lighting design and space planning to address social interaction needs and issues of living and working in isolation.

Another priority of the construction was to have as little environmental impact on the ice as possible.

==== Relocation ====
The BAS announced that it intended to move Halley VI to a new site in summer 2016–2017, prompted by a large crack that had been propagating through the ice and which threatened to cut the station off from the main body of the ice shelf. The station was shifted from its previous site, the only time the station has been moved since it became operational. &quot;Horizon&quot;, the long-running BBC documentary series, sent film-maker Natalie Hewit to Antarctica for three months to document the move. Relocation was completed in February 2017.

Whilst the station was being relocated, concerns over another crack (dubbed the &quot;Halloween Crack&quot;) emerged. This crack had been discovered on 31 October 2016, and the BAS realised that it too could cut off the station, and possibly make it drift out to sea. Since evacuating the crew is all but impossible during winter, the BAS announced in March 2017 it would withdraw its staff from the base from March to October. Staff returned after the Antarctic winter in November 2017 and found the station in very good condition. The staff have been removed every winter since.

==Climate==
==Inhabitants==
In the peak summer period, from late December to late February, staff numbers count about 52.

=== Winter crew ===
Before BAS shut down winter operations, there were around 13 overwintering staff. Most were the technical specialists required to keep the station and the scientific experiments running. The 2016 wintering team at Halley included a chef, a doctor, a communications manager, a vehicle mechanic, a generator mechanic, an electrician, a plumber, a field assistant, two electronics engineers, a meteorologist and a data manager. In addition there was a winter station leader who was sworn in as a magistrate prior to deployment and whose main role was to oversee the day-to-day management of the station.

1996 saw the first female winterers at Halley. In 2006, five out of sixteen winterers were women.

==Base life==

Life in Antarctica is dominated by the seasons, with a short, hectic summer and a long winter. In bases such as Halley that are resupplied by sea, the most significant event of the year is the arrival of the resupply ship (planned , until 2020 , before 1999, ) in late December. This is followed by intense activity to unload all supplies before the ship has to leave again; typically, this is done in less than two weeks.

The Halley summer season runs from as early as mid-October when the first plane lands, until early March when the ship has left and the last aircraft leaves, visiting Rothera Research Station before heading to South America.

Significant dates in the winter are sundown (last day when the Sun can be seen) on April 29, midwinter on June 21 and sunrise (first day when the Sun rises after winter) on August 13. Traditionally, the oldest person on base lowers the tattered flag on sundown and the youngest raises a new one on sunrise.

== In popular culture ==
The 2019 movie &quot;Where&#x27;d You Go, Bernadette&quot; ends with footage and animated renderings of Halley VI.

<doc id="344908" wikidata="Q5760022" url="?curid=344908" title="Ontario Provincial Highway Network">
<text>The Ontario Provincial Highway Network consists of all the roads in Ontario maintained by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO), including those designated as part of the King&#x27;s Highway, secondary highways, and tertiary roads. Components of the system—comprising of roads and 2,880 bridges
—range in scale from Highway 401, the busiest highway in North America, to unpaved forestry and mining access roads. The longest highway is nearly long, while the shortest is less than a kilometre. Some roads are unsigned highways, lacking signage to indicate their maintenance by the MTO; these may be remnants of highways that are still under provincial control whose designations were decommissioned, roadway segments left over from realignment projects, or proposed highway corridors.

Predecessors to today&#x27;s modern highways include the foot trails and portages used by indigenous peoples in the time before European settlement. Shortly after the creation of the Province of Upper Canada in 1791, the new government under John Graves Simcoe built overland military roads to supplement water-based transportation, including Yonge Street and Dundas Street. At the time, road construction was under the control of the township and county governments. Local township roads were financed and constructed through a statute labour system that required landowners to make improvements in lieu of taxes. Private companies constructed corduroy and later plank roads and charged tolls in the second half of the 19th century. The rising popularity of the bicycle led to the formation of the Ontario Good Roads Association, which advocated for the improvement of roads and recreation as the automobile rose to prominence.

By the early 20th century, the province had taken interest in road improvement and began funding it through counties. The increasing adoption of the automobile resulted in the formation of the Department of Public Highways of Ontario (DPHO) in 1916. The passing of the Canada Highways Act in 1919 resulted in the establishment of a provincial network of highways. The DPHO assigned internal highway numbers to roads in the system, and in 1925, the numbers were signposted along the roads and marked on maps. In 1930, provincial highways were renamed &quot;King&#x27;s Highways&quot; and the familiar crown route markers created. The DPHO was also renamed the Department of Highways (DHO).

The 1930s saw several major depression relief projects built by manual labour, including the first inter-city divided highway in North America along the Middle Road, which would become the Queen Elizabeth Way in 1939. In 1937, the DHO merged with the Department of Northern Development, extending the highway network into the Canadian Shield and Northern Ontario. Significant traffic engineering and surveying through the war years, during which construction came to a near standstill, led to the planning and initial construction of controlled-access highways. The 400-series highways were built beginning in the late 1940s and numbered in 1952.

The vast majority of modern road infrastructure in Ontario was built throughout the 1950s, 1960s, and early 1970s. The cancellation of the Spadina Expressway and the introduction of the Environmental Assessment Act in the 1970s resulted in a decline in new highway construction in the decades since. In the late 1990s, nearly of provincial highways were transferred, or &quot;downloaded&quot; back to lower levels of government. Few new provincial highways have been built in the early years of the 21st century, although several major infrastructure projects including the Herb Gray Parkway and expansion of Highway 69 have proceeded. Recent construction has included the controversial Bradford Bypass and Highway 413.

== Naming, signage and regulations ==

In Ontario, all public roads are legally considered highways under the Highway Traffic Act (HTA), which sets forth regulations for traffic, or the rules of the road.
The Public Transportation and Highway Improvement Act (PTHIA) sets forth the regulations concerning roads that are under the authority of the Province of Ontario. The act distinguishes and sets out the applicability of the HTA to provincial highways, which are designated as part of The King&#x27;s Highway (primary), a secondary highway, or a tertiary road. Tertiary roads may also be designated as a resource road, allowing for vehicles otherwise prohibited from public roads. Industrial roads are privately owned routes with which the MTO has entered an agreement to improve or allow public access, and are not considered part of the provincial highway network.
The 407 ETR is likewise not considered part of the provincial highway network. While it is still subject to the rules set forth by the HTA, it is otherwise governed independently under the legislation of the Highway 407 Act.

Speed limits on provincial highways are legislated by sections of the road, and vary between and . Freeways, including the 400-series highways, are generally signed at , although sections exist that are signed lower.
Three segments of freeway are part of an ongoing pilot project to test speed limits of 110km/h in rural areas that are not subject to congestion. A fourth segment, located in Northern Ontario, was set to be announced in 2020, but has been delayed since.

=== Marker design ===

Ontario uses two distinct shapes of signage to mark the King&#x27;s Highways. Confirmation markers, or reassurance markers, are utilized along the designated road to confirm (near intersections) or reassure (elsewhere) drivers that they are on the correct route. The markers, known as &quot;shields&quot;, feature the route number within an outline in the shape of a shield, topped by a St Edward&#x27;s Crown. In other cases, particularly when approaching the junction of another highway, a square &quot;crown&quot; marker is used, featuring the route number within an outline of the St Edward&#x27;s Crown, paired with an arrow plate; exit signs on freeways and at major junctions also use this crown symbol. For secondary highways, the route number is within an outline of an isosceles trapezoid, while tertiary roads place the number within an outline of a rectangle. When these markers appear along or at an intersection with the indicated highway, they feature black text on a reflective white background. There are two exceptions to this: The QEW, which features blue text on a yellow background; and the provincially-maintained section of the tolled Highway 407, which feature white text on a blue background, with an orange plate with &quot;TOLL&quot; below in black.
Signs prior to 1993 had the words &quot;The King&#x27;s Highway&quot; below the crown, but current versions do not have the words.

In addition to regular highway markers, there are trailblazers, which indicate a route &quot;towards&quot; that highway. These are the same shape as their corresponding highway marker. Trailblazers for the King&#x27;s Highway, which can be shields or crowns, feature white text on a reflective green background, with the exception of trailblazers for the QEW, which feature yellow text on a reflective blue background. For secondary highways, trailblazers simply add the word &quot;TO&quot; above the route number.

Since August 2004, &quot;Highway of Heroes&quot; shields featuring a diagram of a poppy have been posted along Highway401 between Toronto and CFB Trenton. These were erected to honour fallen Canadian soldiers, whose bodies were repatriated from Afghanistan in funeral convoys along that stretch of the highway.

== Classification ==
Ontario has several distinct classes of highways:
=== The King&#x27;s Highway ===

The King&#x27;s Highway is the primary highway network of Ontario, and constitutes the majority of the principal inter-urban roadways in the province. As a whole, it is referred to in the singular form as opposed to as a group of its parts (i.e. &quot;the King&#x27;s Highway&quot;, not &quot;the King&#x27;s Highways&quot;).
Individual highways are known as &quot;part of the King&#x27;s Highway&quot; or &quot;the King&#x27;s Highway known as &quot;n&quot;&quot;.
However, in common parlance they are simply referred to as &quot;Highway &quot;n&quot;&quot;. Ontario highways rank second safest in North America for fatality rates, with 0.55 fatalities per 10000 licensed drivers in 2019. The phrase &quot;King&#x27;s Highway&quot; is used regardless of the gender of the monarch.

The 400-series highways and the QEW form the backbone of the King&#x27;s Highway, with other routes numbered from 2 to 148. The Ministry of Transportation never designated a Highway 1.
Some highway numbers are suffixed with a letter &quot;A&quot; (&quot;alternate route&quot;),
&quot;B&quot; (&quot;business route&quot;),
or &quot;N&quot; (&quot;new route&quot;).
In the past, there have also been routes with &quot;C&quot; and &quot;S&quot; (&quot;scenic route&quot;) suffixes.
The entire King&#x27;s Highway network is fully paved.
The term &quot;the King&#x27;s Highway&quot; was first adopted in place of &quot;provincial highway&quot; in 1930, and signs similar to the current design replaced the previous triangular signs at that time.
Some legislative acts refer to roads that are under the jurisdiction of the province as &quot;provincial highways&quot;.

==== 400-series ====

The 400-series highways are a network of controlled-access highways throughout the southern portion of Ontario, forming a special subset of the provincial highway network. They are analogous to the Interstate Highway System in the United States or the Autoroute system of neighbouring Quebec, and are regulated by the MTO.
The 400-series designations were introduced in 1952, although Ontario had been constructing divided highways for two decades prior.
Initially, only Highways400, 401 and 402 were numbered; other designations followed in the subsequent decades.

While older freeways have some lapses in safety features, contemporary 400-series highways have design speeds of , speed limits of , various collision avoidance and traffic management systems, and several design standards adopted throughout North America.
Of note are the Ontario Tall Wall median barrier and the Parclo A-4 interchange design, the latter which became standard in the design for the widening of Highway 401 through Toronto in 1962. The Institute of Traffic Engineers subsequently recommended this design to replace the cloverleaf interchange throughout North America.

=== Secondary ===

Secondary highways exist solely within the districts of Northern Ontario that lack a county road system, to which they are analogous. The sole exception to this is Highway 537 in Greater Sudbury. They generally serve to connect remote communities to the King&#x27;s Highway, or to interconnect the King&#x27;s Highway. A few secondary highways remain gravel-surfaced, although most have been paved.
The speed limit on nearly all of these routes is , although Highway 655 is posted at .

The Secondary Highway system was introduced in 1956 to service regions in Northern and Central Ontario, though it once included a route as far south as Lake Ontario. Many routes that would become secondary highways were already maintained by the province as development roads prior to being designated.
Since 1998, none have existed south of the districts of Parry Sound and Nipissing.
Secondary highways are numbered in the 500s and 600s, with existing highways numbered between 502 and 673.

=== Tertiary ===
Tertiary roads are remote routes entirely within Northern Ontario that provide access to resources (e.g. mining and forestry). Tertiary roads are numbered in the 800s, with the five existing highways numbered between 802 and 811. Most of these roads are gravel-surfaced and of low-standard. The speed limit on these routes is , although design standards generally prevent such.
Unlike other roads in the Provincial Highway Network, the MTO is not responsible for winter maintenance nor liable for damage incurred as a result of using these routes.
The MTO introduced the Tertiary Road system in 1962.
With the exception of Highway 802, none end in settlements.

=== Trans-Canada ===

The Trans-Canada Highway (TCH) forms several major routes across Canada. The provincial governments are entirely responsible for signage and maintenance of the routes, except through National Parks. It is signed with distinctive green markers with a white maple leaf on them throughout Canada. While other provinces generally place a highway number within the maple leaf of the TCH marker (with a shared &quot;Highway 1&quot; designation across the western provinces), Ontario places them below or beside provincial shields and either leaves them blank or inserts a name instead; these are the &quot;Central Ontario Route&quot;, &quot;Georgian Bay Route&quot;, &quot;Lake Superior Route&quot;, &quot;Northern Ontario Route&quot; and &quot;Ottawa Valley Route&quot;.

Several portions of the King&#x27;s Highway are designated as part of the Trans-Canada Highway system within Ontario, with the TCH having a main route and several branches, often only following sections of any given provincial highway. They are: 


=== Others ===
In addition to these classes of highways, the MTO maintains other roads, such as resource roads or industrial roads, that are of strategic importance to the provincial government. These roads are designated with 7000-series numbers for internal inventory purposes, though they are not publicly marked as such. They are often, but not always, former highway segments which were decommissioned as a King&#x27;s Highway, but remain important as connecting routes to communities or other highways in areas without municipal governance.
There were formerly several designated Ontario Tourist Routes that were located throughout the entire province.
However, beginning in February 1997, Tourism-Oriented Directional Signs (TODS) began to appear on highways.
Tourist Routes no longer appeared on maps after 1998.

== History ==

=== Before 1791: Native footpaths ===
Prior to the arrival of Europeans in the 17th century, transportation across what became Ontario was generally via the thousands of lakes and rivers. Short trails existed between bodies of water, known as a portage or carrying place, as well as along the shorelines of the larger lakes.
In 1615, French explorer Samuel de Champlain was the first European to pass through the lands between the Great Lakes, accompanied by Huron and Iroquois guides. His emissary Étienne Brûlé as well as Franciscan Récollets such as Joseph Le Caron and Joseph de La Roche Daillon were the first to explore various lands of the area, all with the assistance of the local First Nations.
For the next 150years, France and Britain wrestled for control of the colony of Canada while simultaneously exploiting the land for the fur trade of North America.
This culminated in the global Seven Years&#x27; War that ended with the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1763, which ceded Canada to the British.

The colony of Canada was renamed the Province of Quebec until 1791, when it was divided into Upper Canada (modern Southern Ontario) and Lower Canada (modern Southern Quebec) by the Constitutional Act.
This was done to provide a British-style governance to the United Empire Loyalists fleeing north following the American Revolution.
In addition to the native portages and lake shore trails, routes developed alongside significant rivers such as the St. Lawrence, Ottawa, Humber and Grand Rivers. These meandering trails followed the lay of the land, as opposed to the straight tangents of the surveyed roads yet to come. Some roads in Ontario still closely follow these early Native and European trails,
including the Kente Portage Trail (Old Portage Road) in Carrying Place, the oldest continuously used road in the province.

=== 1792–1849: Settlement of Upper Canada ===

John Graves Simcoe, the first Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada, landed at Niagara on July26, 1792, after overwintering in Quebec City,
from England and set forth to colonize the province in the image of Britain.
The ambitious abolitionist statesman, whom served the British during the American Revolutionary War, was appointed to lead the new colony on September12, 1791.
Although Niagara-on-the-Lake (then known as Newark) served as the capital for a year, Simcoe moved it to what is now Toronto after July30, 1793, at the behest of French merchant Philippe de Rocheblave, following the arrival of news in May of France&#x27;s declaration of war against Britain.

Having reformed the Queen&#x27;s Rangers, whom he fought alongside during the American War, Simcoe set out to establish military roads to connect his new capital with the Upper Great Lakes and other strategic points.
The first road he ordered built was Dundas Street, from the head of Lake Ontario near present-day Dundas to the forks of the Thames River in present-day London. His Rangers began work on this route on September10, 1793.
Between September25 and October14, Simcoe travelled with native guides to Penetanguishene and back. Following the advice of an Ojibwa named Old Sail, the return voyage followed the east branch of the Holland River and thence south to Toronto (known as York from 1793 to 1834); this would become the route of Yonge Street.

Simcoe&#x27;s Rangers would commence &quot;run[ning] the line of the new road&quot; with Surveyor General Augustus Jones in February 1794.
By mid-May, the Rangers had cleared and marked 14lots from Eglinton Avenue to just north of Sheppard Avenue before being redirected to defend Fort Miami. William Berczy — and the nearly 200 Pennsylvania Dutch settlers whom accompanied him from the US into Upper Canada in July 1794 — would complete the opening of the route to Bond Lake by the end of 1794. The remainder to Holland Landing was opened by the Rangers, under the supervision of Augustus Jones, between December28, 1795, and February16, 1796.
In 1798, Asa Danforth was hired by the government of Upper Canada to build a road to the Trent River, in what in now Trenton, by July1 of the following year. He began at the Don River, where Queen Street crosses it today, on June5 of that year, and proceeded east.
Danforth was paid $90 per mile to cut a road wide, of which the middle half was cut to the level of the ground. He was also to build -wide causeways &quot;wherever necessary&quot; and ensure that slopes were gradual enough for a sleigh or carriage to pass. He completed the first to Port Hope by December.
The government ultimately decided that his road was unacceptable, and reportedly paid him less than owed. Portions of Danforth&#x27;s road were later incorporated into Highway 2, as well as several local roads in Scarborough.

The majority of settlers up to this point were United Empire Loyalists — settlers of the Thirteen Colonies loyal to Britain who fled north to the new colony. These pioneers endured starting anew in untamed wilderness, with little provisions beyond what they could carry.
Many were strategically placed along Yonge Street and Dundas Street, and given the duty of clearing half the width of a road along the front of their property lot. Settlers were responsible for the upkeep, and often the building of roads in this period, with each male over 21years of age required to perform three or more days of statute labour per year, based on the value of their land. The intention was for settlers throughout the length of the roads to work on the portion fronting their lot, which was generally twenty chains, or long.
However, many lots were given to absent clergymen and English nobles, resulting in these &quot;roads&quot; being poorly-maintained quagmires of mud.

During the early 1800s, the government of Upper Canada appropriated settlers to various lots which had been surveyed along the lake shores of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. The townships established along these fronts contained generally fertile land composed of glacial till and clay-rich loam. As these townships filled up, business opportunities presented themselves for investors to purchase native lands and open them to settlement. The Canada Company was the most successful of these ventures and brought settlers to vast areas of land in what would become Southwestern Ontario by building routes such as Huron Road and Toronto–Sydenham Road during the 1830s and 1840s.

=== 1850–1893: Colonization roads and the railway ===

As the second township frontage along Lake Ontario also filled, the government came under pressure to open up the unforgiving terrain of the Canadian Shield to settlement and sought to establish a network of east–west and north–south roads between the Ottawa Valley and Georgian Bay. This area was known as the Ottawa–Huron Tract.
In 1847, an exploration survey was carried out by Robert Bell to lay out the lines that would become the Opeongo, Hastings, and Addington colonization roads. The Public Lands Act, passed in 1853, permitted the granting of land to settlers who were at least 18. Those settlers who cleared at least within four years, built a house within a year, and resided on the grant for at least five years would receive the title to that land. The government subsequently built over of roads over the following 20years to provide access to these grants, although the roads were often little more than a trail cut through the forest wide enough for a wagon.

Like the lands to the south, statute labour was responsible for the majority of road development and maintenance. However, by 1860, due to the unsuitability of much of the land for any kind of settlement or agriculture, the roads were almost impassable in many places, except when frozen in winter or dry in summer. The large timber drive that was clearing the forests of the Ottawa–Huron Tract in this period contributed somewhat to road construction and maintenance, but the settlers themselves were largely left to their own resolve.
Statute labour was gradually abolished around the turn of the 20th century. Malden Township was the first to do so in 1890,
and a majority of other municipalities followed suit by the 1920s. However, the law remained in place provincially until being officially repealed on January1, 2022.

Beginning in 1852, the Grand Trunk Railway gradually assembled together many of the various shortline railroads in what was soon to become Ontario to form a single route across the province, connecting Sarnia with Montreal via Toronto, by 1884. Simultaneously, the Canadian Pacific Railway constructed a route across northern Ontario, connecting Thunder Bay with Ottawa by 1880.
The government largely subsidized these endeavours, and funding for road construction fell to the wayside, despite the pleas of townships, villages and settlers.
In 1896, the provincial Instructor in Road Making reported &quot;It is doubtful if there is a mile of true macadam road in Ontario outside of a few towns or cities... by far the greatest part of the milage of the province is mud, ruts and pitch-holes...&quot;

=== 1894–1915: The Good Roads Movement ===

The cries of municipalities went unanswered, but it would not stop their ambition. Coupled with the increasing adoption of the bicycle as a means of transport, and the desire of farmers to get their goods to market quicker, the Ontario Good Roads Association was formed in 1894 by representatives from numerous townships, villages and cities. The Good Roads Movement encouraged education on the building of proper roads, and later equipment to aid in the improvement of roads, as well as lobbying the various levels of government to fund road development and maintenance. Members would travel from town to town and across the countryside, espousing the value of properly built roads to communities.

Two of the most influential members in its early days were Archibald William Campbell and Dr. Perry Doolittle.
&quot;Good Roads&quot; Campbell would become the province&#x27;s first Instructor in Roadmaking when the position was established on April15, 1896, under the Department of Agriculture. Doolittle, a Toronto physician, became one of the earliest automobile owners in Canada, and spurred the good roads movement. He became the first person to drive across Canada in 1925, utilizing the railways around Lake Superior where no roads existed, and is known as the &quot;Father of the Trans-Canada Highway&quot;.

The arrival of automobiles rapidly changed the approach to roads and roadbuilding in the first years of the 20th century. In 1900, the provincial Instructor in Roadmaking was renamed as the Commissioner of Public Highways in 1900, as well as the Deputy Minister in the new Department of Public Works in 1905. The first legislation on driving was introduced in 1903, and included the first speed limits (). The first license plates were created that year, the first highway patrol established in 1907, licences for chauffeurs in 1909 (regular drivers did not require a licence until 1927), and safety requirements such as headlights. These laws culminated in the creation of the Highway Traffic Act in 1923.

Roadbuilding advanced considerably, with the most notable project of the period being the Toronto–Hamilton Highway, the first paved intercity road in Ontario. The highway was chosen to run along the macadamized old Lake Shore Road between the two cities, instead of Dundas Street to the north, because of the numerous hills encountered along Dundas.
In November 1914, the proposed highway was approved,
and work began quickly to construct the road known today as Lake Shore Boulevard and Lakeshore Road from Toronto to Hamilton. The road was finished in November 1917, wide and nearly long, becoming the first concrete road in Ontario.
The highway became the favourite drive of many motorists, and it quickly became a tradition for many families to drive it every Sunday.

=== 1916–1933: The first provincial highways ===
Roads and highways in Ontario were given their first serious consideration by the provincial government when the Department of Public Highways (DPHO), predecessor to the modern Ministry of Transportation of Ontario, was established on January 17, 1916. Until then, the majority of the primary roads through southern Ontario formed part of the county road systems. The Department of Public Works paid up to 60% of the construction and maintenance costs for these roads, while the counties were responsible for the remaining 40%.
The Ontario government passed an act in 1917 to permit the newly formed Department of Public Highways (DPHO) to take over (or assume) responsibility and upkeep of a provincial highway system. The initial system, between Windsor and Quebec, was bookended by branches to Niagara and Ottawa.
In 1919, the federal government passed the Canada Highways Act, which provided $20,000,000 to provinces under the condition that they establish an official highway network; up to 40% of construction costs would be subsidized. The first network plan was approved on February 26, 1920. At this time, Campbell was now the Federal Commissioner of Highways.

Until the summer of 1925, Ontario highways were named rather than numbered. When route numbering was introduced, the following numbers were allotted:

*Highway 2 (Windsor–Quebec, )
*Highway 3 (Windsor–Niagara Falls, )
*Highway 4 (St. Thomas–Elginfield, )
*Highway 5 (Jarvis–Toronto, )
*Highway 6 (Hamilton–Owen Sound, )
*Highway 7 (Sarnia–Brampton, )

*Highway 8 (Goderich–Niagara Falls, )
*Highway 9 (Kincardine–Arthur, )
*Highway 10 (Port Credit–Owen Sound, )
*Highway 11 (Toronto–Severn River, )
*Highway 12 (Whitby–Lindsay, )
*Highway 12A (Port Hope–Peterborough, )

*Highway 14 (Picton–Foxboro, )
*Highway 15 (Kingston–Ottawa, )
*Highway 16 (Prescott–Ottawa, )
*Highway 17 (Pembroke–Quebec boundary, )
The number of Provincial Highways—as they were initially known—expanded quickly from there. The provincial highway network did not extend into the Canadian Shield nor Northern Ontario initially, and &quot;Trunk Roads&quot; in the north were instead under the mandate of the Department of Northern Development. The two primary trunk routes were extensions of Highway 11 and Highway 17, to North Bay and Sault Ste. Marie, respectively.
Seeking to open the far north, construction of a road to connect North Bay and Cochrane began in 1925,
The new gravel highway was officially opened on July2, 1927, by Minister of Lands and Forests William Finlayson. He suggested at the opening that the road be named the Ferguson Highway in honour of premier Ferguson. The name was originally suggested by North Bay mayor Dan Barker.
Despite the official opening, a section between Swastika and Ramore wasn&#x27;t opened until August.
The Ferguson Highway name was also applied to the Muskoka Road between Severn Bridge and North Bay.

During the 1920s, the DPHO began to examine possible remedies to chronic congestion on along Highway2, particularly between Toronto and Hamilton (Lakeshore Road), eventually deciding upon widening the roadway midway between Lakeshore Road and Highway 5 (Dundas Street), or the Middle Road. It was to be more than twice the width of Lakeshore Road at and would carry two lanes of traffic in either direction.
Construction on what was then known as the &quot;Queen Street Extension&quot; west of Toronto began in early 1931.
Before the highway could be completed, Thomas McQuesten was appointed the new minister of the renamed DHO, with Robert Melville Smith as deputy minister, following the 1934 provincial elections.

=== 1934–1948: Dual highways and the Queen Elizabeth Way ===
Smith, inspired by the German autobahns—new &quot;dual-lane divided highways&quot;—modified the design for Ontario roads,
and McQuesten ordered the Middle Road be converted into this new form of highway.
A right-of-way was purchased along the Middle Road and construction began to convert the existing sections to a divided highway. Work also began on Canada&#x27;s first interchange at Highway 10.
The Middle Road was ceremoniously renamed the Queen Elizabeth Way during the 1939 royal tour of Canada, taking its name from Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, and was completed between Toronto and Niagara Falls on August26, 1940.

Beginning in 1935, McQuesten applied the concept of a dual-highway to several projects along Highway2, including along Kingston Road in Scarborough Township.
When widening in Scarborough reached the Highland Creek ravine in 1936, the Department of Highways began construction on a new bridge over the large valley, bypassing the former alignment around West Hill.
From here the highway was constructed on a new alignment to Oshawa, avoiding construction on the congested Highway 2. As grading and bridge construction neared completion on the new highway between West Hill and Oshawa in September 1939, World War II broke out and gradually tax revenues were re-allocated from highway construction to the war effort.

As the war came to a close, planning began in 1945 on the Toronto–Barrie Highway to ease the congestion on the parallel routes of Highway 11 and Highway 27. The highway followed a completely new alignment, and featured interchanges at nearly all crossroads. Construction of an extension around Barrie began in 1950, and the completed freeway was opened on July1, 1952. The expressway between Highland Creek and Oshawa was also completed in this period, and opened as far as Ritson Road in December 1947, becoming the progenitor to Highway401.

=== 1950–1971: The freeway age and the Trans-Canada Highway ===

When Ontario signed the Trans-Canada Highway Agreement on April25, 1950, it had already chosen a Central Ontario routing via Highway7, Highway12, Highway 103 and Highway69;
Highway17 through the Ottawa Valley was announced as a provincially-funded secondary route of the Trans-Canada the following day.
Amongst some of the most difficult terrain encountered in Canada, the of wilderness known as &quot;the Gap&quot; was a missing link in the Trans-Canada Highway between Nipigon and Sault Ste. Marie. Construction began in 1956,
and it was completed and ceremoniously opened to traffic on September17, 1960, uniting the two segments and completing the route of Highway17 from the Manitoba border to the Quebec border.

The construction boom following the war resulted in many new freeway construction projects in the province. The Toronto–Barrie Highway (Highway400), Trans-Provincial Highway (Highway401),
a short expansion of Highway7 approaching the Blue Water Bridge in Sarnia (Highway 402),
and an expansion of Highway27 (eventually designated as Highway 427 by the mid-1970s) into part of the Toronto Bypass were all underway or completed by the early 1950s. Seeking a way to distinguish the controlled-access freeways from the existing two-lane King&#x27;s Highways, the Department of Highways created the 400-series designations in 1952. By the end of the year, Highway400, 401, and 402 were numbered, although they were only short stubs of their current lengths.
Highway401 was assembled across the province in a patchwork fashion,
becoming fully navigable between Windsor and the Quebec border on November10, 1964;
Highway400 was extended north to Coldwater on Christmas Eve 1959;
Highway402 was extended to London between 1972 and 1982.

In addition to this network backbone, plans for additional 400-series highways were initiated by the late 1950s, comprising the Chedoke Expressway (Highway 403) through Hamilton;
the Don Valley Parkway Extension (Highway 404) northward from the soon-to-be constructed Toronto expressway;
Highway 405 to connect with the American border near St. Catharines;
Highway 406 south from St. Catharines to Welland;
Highway407 encircling the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), though not built for another 40 years;
Highway 409 to connect Highway401 with Toronto International Airport;
and The Queensway (Highway 417) through Ottawa.
The first sections of these freeways were opened in 1963,
1977,
1963, 1965,
1997,
1974,
and 1960,
respectively. In 1963, transportation minister Charles MacNaughton announced the widening of Highway401 in Toronto from four to a minimum of 12lanes between Islington Avenue and Markham Road. Construction began immediately; while the plan initially called for construction to end in 1967, it continued for nearly a decade. At least four lanes were always open during the large reconstruction project, which included complex new interchanges at Highway27, Highway400, the planned Spadina Expressway and the Don Valley Parkway.

Throughout the mid-to-late 1960s, the provincial government also funded numerous urban expressways, including the Conestoga Parkway in Kitchener–Waterloo, the Thunder Bay Expressway in Thunder Bay, Highbury Avenue in London, the Hanlon Expressway into Guelph and most infamously the Spadina Expressway into Downtown Toronto. While the others were built, the Spadina became a heated debate in the late 1960s between Metropolitan Toronto and urban activists including Jane Jacobs. The battle culminated when premier Bill Davis rose in the legislature and declared &quot;If we are building a transportation system to serve the automobile, the Spadina Expressway would be a good place to start. But if we are building a transportation system to serve people, the Spadina Expressway is a good place to stop.&quot;

=== 1972–1995: Growth of public transit ===
The cancellation of the Spadina Expressway led to the demise of other proposed expressways in Toronto and elsewhere in the province, as well as a decline in new road building proposals.
It remains, to this day, a controversial decision.
The Environmental Assessment Act, introduced in 1975, further restricted new highway building, and as a result the 1970s and 1980s saw less new highway construction compared to prior decades.

Despite this, several existing freeways were extended or expanded, including Highway402 from Sarnia to London between 1972 and 1982,
Highway403 through Mississauga between 1978 and late 1982,
the Don Valley Parkway as Highway404 north from Toronto to Newmarket between 1976 and 1989,
Highway406 through St. Catharines between 1977 and 1984,
Highway417 from Ottawa to the Quebec boundary between 1970 and late 1975,
and the expansion of Highway27 into Highway427 between 1968 and late 1971,
as well as its extension from Highway401 to Highway7 between 1976 and 1991.
Highway 410 was also built, initially as a two lane road, between 1975 and late 1978.

=== 1996–1999: Highway Transfers ===
As part of a series of budget cuts initiated by premier Mike Harris under his Common Sense Revolution platform in 1995, numerous highways deemed to no longer be of significance to the provincial network were decommissioned and responsibility for the routes transferred to lower levels of government, a process referred to as &quot;downloading&quot;. Several thousand kilometres of provincially maintained highways were transferred to the various municipalities in which they are located. These transfers were performed under the reasoning that they served a mostly local function, as a cost-saving measure and as part of a broader exchange of responsibilities between the province and its municipalities.
On April1, 1997, of highways were removed from the King&#x27;s Highway system.
This was followed by the removal of on January 1, 1998,
for a total of ; the move was criticized by the media.

In the 1980s and 1990s, Highway 416 was constructed through a process known as twinning in which a second carriageway is built parallel to the existing road. In addition, existing intersections were rebuilt as grade-separated interchanges.
Highway 16 New was built during the 1960s and 1970s, establishing the right-of-way and alignment of a future freeway as a two-lane highway.
Planning for a connection to Highway 417 began in 1987,
and was completed on July31, 1997.
Work to twin Highway16 New began in mid-1996,
and was completed in sections between June 1997,
and September 1999, after which nearly the entire length of Highway16 was redesignated as Highway416.

=== 2000–2023: Recent history ===

In recent years, highway construction has generally been limited to the expansion of existing highways, principal among them Highway11, Highway400/69, and the Herb Gray Parkway extension of Highway401 into Windsor. The four-laning of of Highway11 between Barrie and North Bay was a long-term expansion that was completed August8, 2012, having been worked on since 1955.
The four-laning of Highway69, which will be replaced by Highway400, has progressed northward from Waubaushene since 1991,
reaching as far as Nobel on October26, 2010.
Work has also progressed south from Sudbury since 2005,
and as of 2022 has reached the French River, leaving a gap of two-lane highway between Toronto and Sudbury.

Construction began in 2012 on a provincially operated long extension to the 407ETR, known as Highway407 East (or 407E) during planning, with the project undertaken in two separate phases. Phase1 was opened on June20, 2016, consisting of a extension to Harmony Road in Oshawa, as well as the Highway412. The extension was free of tolls until February1, 2017.
Phase2A, which opened on January2, 2018, added a extension to Taunton Road at the future Highway418 interchange. Phase2B, which opened on December9, 2019, added a extension to Highway35 and Highway115, as well as the Highway418.

In 2004, a joint announcement by the federal government of the United States and Government of Canada confirmed a new Canada–U.S. border crossing would be constructed between Detroit and Windsor. The MTO took advantage of this opportunity to extend Highway 401 to the Canada–US border and began an environmental impact assessment on the entire project in late 2005.
Despite protest from area residents,
as well as a dismissed lawsuit from Ambassador Bridge owner Matty Moroun,
it was announced on May1, 2008, that a preferred route had been selected and the new route would be named the &quot;Windsor–Essex Parkway&quot;.
The below-grade route has six through-lanes and follows Huron Church Road from the former end of Highway401 to the E.C. Row Expressway, which it then follows alongside to near the border.
Construction began in August 2011,
It was partially opened on June28, 2015,
and completed to the Ojibway Parkway on November21,
The Gordie Howe International Bridge is scheduled for completion , and will tie Highway401 in with Interstate 75 in Detroit.

== Future ==

The current proposals by the consist of two new freeways in the and continued widening and four-laning of existing highways. Highway 413 is a proposed four-to-six lane freeway bypass of the GTA around Brampton, connecting Highway401 and Highway407 with Highway400 north of Vaughan. The route would include extensions of Highway410 and Highway427 as well as a right-of-way for a transitway; the highway has attracted considerable attention, with opinions divided over the benefits of shorter travel times versus irreversible environmental impacts and urban sprawl.
The Bradford Bypass is a proposed four lane rural freeway connecting Highway400 and Highway404 north of Bradford and Newmarket.
Like Highway413, it has attracted criticism for its environmental impact,
though it has the support of adjacent municipalities.
Preliminary construction works for the route are underway as of 2022.

While planning for the twinning of Highway11/17 between Thunder Bay and Nipigon began in 1989,
construction did not begin until 2009.
As of 2022, of two-laned highway remains to be twinned or bypassed, almost all of which is in the engineering phase.
The four-laning of the remaining gap of Highway69 has been promised by multiple governments, but no timeline for completion has been announced as of 2022.

<doc id="344909" wikidata="Q1412101" url="?curid=344909" title="Traveller (nautical fitting)">
<text>A traveller is a part of the rigging of a boat or ship that provides a moving attachment point for a rope, sail or yard to a fixed part of the vessel. It may take the form of anything from a simple ring on a metal bar or a spar to, especially in a modern yacht, a more complex &quot;car&quot; – a component with bearing-mounted wheels running on a shaped aluminium extrusion.

There are three common examples of the use of a traveller. The sheet of a sail is attached to a traveller on the horse, allowing the sail&#x27;s clew to be positioned to leeward on each tack, thereby giving a more aerodynamically efficient position of the sail. A jib may be attached to a bowsprit with a traveller. This allows the sail to be set and handed without having to go out onto the bowsprit. Lastly, the yard of a lugsail is usually attached to the mast using a traveller. This often consists of a metal ring around the mast with a hook above and below the ring for, respectively, the halyard and the yard to fasten.
A traveller is used to modify the location at which lines used to control sails (such as sheets) are attached to the vessel. The attachment is often by means of a block through which the line runs; the block can move along the traveller. This allows independent control of the direction and tension of the line running through the block, which allows the sailor to position the block in the optimal location for the wind conditions and desired sail trim. This kind of traveller is often a metal track, which is attached to the deck of the boat. The block is attached to a &quot;car&quot;, which much like a miniature railroad car, attaches to the track and slides along it in either direction. A traveller on a smaller craft (such as the popular single-handed &quot;Laser&quot; sailboat) might simply be a line attached to two points on the deck, along which another block runs. The term &quot;traveller&quot; can also be applied to the specialized lines used to control the location of the block.

The block used to support a load on a jackstay is referred to as a traveller or traveller block. It works in much the same way as a sheet traveller, in that it supports the load to be transported along the jackstay and is slid along the jackstay by control lines attached to both sides.

<doc id="344912" wikidata="Q1020380" url="?curid=344912" title="Büchi automaton">
<text>In computer science and automata theory, a deterministic Büchi automaton is a theoretical machine which either accepts or rejects infinite inputs. Such a machine has a set of states and a transition function, which determines which state the machine should move to from its current state when it reads the next input character. Some states are accepting states and one state is the start state. The machine accepts an input if and only if it will pass through an accepting state infinitely many times as it reads the input.

A non-deterministic Büchi automaton, later referred to just as a Büchi automaton, has a transition function which may have multiple outputs, leading to many possible paths for the same input; it accepts an infinite input if and only if some possible path is accepting. Deterministic and non-deterministic Büchi automata generalize deterministic finite automata and nondeterministic finite automata to infinite inputs. Each are types of ω-automata. Büchi automata recognize the ω-regular languages, the infinite word version of regular languages. They are named after the Swiss mathematician Julius Richard Büchi, who invented them in 1962.

Büchi automata are often used in model checking as an automata-theoretic version of a formula in linear temporal logic.

== Formal definition ==
Formally, a deterministic Büchi automaton is a tuple &quot;A&quot; = (&quot;Q&quot;,Σ,δ,&quot;q&quot;0,F) that consists of the following components:

* &quot;Q&quot; is a finite set. The elements of &quot;Q&quot; are called the &quot;states&quot; of &quot;A&quot;.
* Σ is a finite set called the &quot;alphabet&quot; of &quot;A&quot;.
* δ: &quot;Q&quot; × Σ → &quot;Q&quot; is a function, called the &quot;transition function&quot; of &quot;A&quot;.
* &quot;q&quot;0 is an element of &quot;Q&quot;, called the &quot;initial state&quot; of &quot;A&quot;.
* F⊆&quot;Q&quot; is the &quot;acceptance condition&quot;. &quot;A&quot; accepts exactly those runs in which at least one of the infinitely often occurring states is in F.

In a (non-deterministic) Büchi automaton, the transition function δ is replaced with a transition relation Δ that returns a set of states, and the single initial state &quot;q&quot;0 is replaced by a set &quot;I&quot; of initial states. Generally, the term Büchi automaton without qualifier refers to non-deterministic Büchi automata.

For more comprehensive formalism see also ω-automaton.

== Closure properties ==
The set of Büchi automata is closed under the following operations.

Let formula_1 and formula_2 be Büchi automata and formula_3 be a finite automaton.

* Union: &quot;There is a Büchi automaton that recognizes the language formula_4&quot;
: Proof: If we assume, &quot;w.l.o.g.&quot;, formula_5 is empty then formula_6 is recognized by the Büchi automaton formula_7
* Intersection: &quot;There is a Büchi automaton that recognizes the language formula_8&quot;
: Proof: The Büchi automaton formula_9 recognizes formula_10 where
:* formula_11
:* formula_12
:** formula_13

== Recognizable languages ==
Büchi automata recognize the ω-regular languages. Using the definition of ω-regular language and the above closure properties of Büchi automata, it can be easily shown that a Büchi automaton can be constructed such that it recognizes any given ω-regular language. For converse, see construction of a ω-regular language for a Büchi automaton.

=== Deterministic versus non-deterministic Büchi automata ===

The class of deterministic Büchi automata does not suffice to encompass all omega-regular languages. In particular, there is no deterministic Büchi automaton that recognizes the language , which contains exactly words in which 1 occurs only finitely many times. We can demonstrate it by contradiction that no such deterministic Büchi automaton exists. Let us suppose &quot;A&quot; is a deterministic Büchi automaton that recognizes with final state set &quot;F&quot;. &quot;A&quot; accepts . So, &quot;A&quot; will visit some state in &quot;F&quot; after reading some finite prefix of , say after the th letter. &quot;A&quot; also accepts the ω-word formula_40 Therefore, for some , after the prefix formula_41 the automaton will visit some state in &quot;F&quot;. Continuing with this construction the ω-word formula_42 is generated which causes A to visit some state in &quot;F&quot; infinitely often and the word is not in Contradiction.

The class of languages recognizable by deterministic Büchi automata is characterized by the following lemma.

: Lemma: &quot;An ω-language is recognizable by a deterministic Büchi automaton if it is the limit language of some regular language.&quot;
: Proof: Any deterministic Büchi automaton can be viewed as a deterministic finite automaton and vice versa, since both types of automaton are defined as 5-tuple of the same components, only the interpretation of acceptance condition is different. We will show that is the limit language of . An ω-word is accepted by if it will force to visit final states infinitely often. Thus, infinitely many finite prefixes of this ω-word will be accepted by . Hence, is a limit language of .

== Algorithms ==
Model checking of finite state systems can often be translated into various operations on Büchi automata.
In addition to the closure operations presented above,
the following are some useful operations for the applications of Büchi automata.

; Determinization

Since deterministic Büchi automata are strictly less expressive than non-deterministic automata, there can not be an algorithm for determinization of Büchi automata.
But, McNaughton&#x27;s Theorem and Safra&#x27;s construction provide algorithms that can translate a Büchi automaton into a deterministic Muller automaton or deterministic Rabin automaton.

; Emptiness checking

The language recognized by a Büchi automaton is non-empty if and only if there is a final state that is both reachable from the initial state, and lies on a cycle.

An effective algorithm that can check emptiness of a Büchi automaton:

# Consider the automaton as a directed graph and decompose it into strongly connected components (SCCs).
# Run a search (e.g., the depth-first search) to find which SCCs are reachable from the initial state.
# Check whether there is a non-trivial SCC that is reachable and contains a final state.

Each of the steps of this algorithm can be done in time linear in the automaton size, hence the algorithm is clearly optimal.

; Minimization

Minimizing deterministic Büchi automata (i.e., given a deterministic Büchi automaton, finding a deterministic Büchi automaton recognizing the same language with a minimal number of states) is an NP-complete problem. This is in contrast to DFA minimization, which can be done in polynomial time.

== Variants ==
* Co-Büchi automaton
* Weak Büchi automaton
* Semi-deterministic Büchi automaton
* Generalized Büchi automaton

== Transforming from other models of description to non-deterministic Büchi automata ==
=== From generalized Büchi automata (GBA) ===

: Multiple sets of states in acceptance condition can be translated into one set of states by an automata construction, which is known as &quot;counting construction&quot;. Let&#x27;s say &quot;A&quot; = (Q,Σ,∆,q0,{F1...,Fn}) is a GBA, where F1...,Fn are sets of accepting states then the equivalent Büchi automaton is &quot;A&quot;&#x27; = (Q&#x27;, Σ, ∆&#x27;,q&#x27;0,F&#x27;), where
:* Q&#x27; = Q × {1...,n}
:* q&#x27;0 = ( q0,1 )
:* ∆&#x27; = { ( (q,i), a, (q&#x27;,j) ) | (q,a,q&#x27;) ∈ ∆ and if q ∈ Fi then j=((i+1) mod n) else j=i }
:* F&#x27;=F1× {1}

=== From Linear temporal logic formula ===
: A translation from a Linear temporal logic formula to a generalized Büchi automaton is given here. And, a translation from a generalized Büchi automaton to a Büchi automaton is presented above.

=== From Muller automata ===
: A given Muller automaton can be transformed into an equivalent Büchi automaton with the following automata construction. Let&#x27;s suppose &quot;A&quot; = (Q,Σ,∆,Q0,{F0...,Fn}) is a Muller automaton, where F0...,Fn are sets of accepting states. An equivalent Büchi automaton is &quot;A&quot;&#x27; = (Q&#x27;, Σ, ∆&#x27;,Q0,F&#x27;), where
:* Q&#x27; = Q ∪  ∪ni=0 {i} × Fi × 2Fi
:* ∆&#x27;= ∆ ∪ ∆1 ∪ ∆2, where
:** ∆1 ={ ( q, a, (i,q&#x27;,∅) ) | (q, a, q&#x27;) ∈ ∆ and q&#x27; ∈ Fi }
:** ∆2={ ( (i,q,R), a, (i,q&#x27;,R&#x27;) ) | (q,a,q&#x27;)∈∆ and q,q&#x27; ∈ Fi and if R=Fi then R&#x27;= ∅ otherwise R&#x27;=R∪{q} }
:* F&#x27;=∪ni=0 {i} × Fi × {Fi}
: &quot;A&#x27; &quot; keeps original set of states from &quot;A&quot; and adds extra states on them. The Büchi automaton &quot;A&#x27; &quot; simulates the Muller automaton &quot;A&quot; as follows: At the beginning of the input word, the execution of &quot;A&quot;&#x27; follows the execution of &quot;A&quot;, since initial states are same and ∆&#x27; contains ∆. At some non-deterministically chosen position in the input word, &quot;A&#x27; &quot; decides of jump into newly added states via a transition in ∆1. Then, the transitions in ∆2 try to visit all the states of &quot;Fi&quot; and keep growing &quot;R&quot;. Once &quot;R&quot; becomes equal to &quot;Fi&quot; then it is reset to the empty set and ∆2 try to visit all the states of &quot;Fi&quot; states again and again. So, if the states &quot;R&quot;=&quot;Fi&quot; are visited infinitely often then &quot;A&#x27; &quot; accepts corresponding input and so does &quot;A&quot;. This construction closely follows the first part of the proof of McNaughton&#x27;s Theorem.

=== From Kripke structures ===
: Let the given Kripke structure be defined by where &quot;Q&quot; is the set of states, is the set of initial states, &quot;R&quot; is a relation between two states also interpreted as an edge, &quot;L&quot; is the label for the state and &quot;AP&quot; are the set of atomic propositions that form &quot;L&quot;.

: The Büchi automaton will have the following characteristics:
:: formula_43
:: formula_44
:: formula_45
:: formula_46
:: formula_47 if belongs to &quot;R&quot; and &quot;L&quot;(&quot;p&quot;) = &quot;a&quot;

: and init formula_48 &quot;q&quot; if &quot;q&quot; belongs to and .

: Note however that there is a difference in the interpretation between Kripke structures and Büchi automata. While the former explicitly names every state variable&#x27;s polarity for every state, the latter just declares the current set of variables holding or not holding true. It says absolutely nothing about the other variables that could be present in the model.

==Complementation==
In automata theory, complementation of a Büchi automaton is the task of complementing a Büchi automaton, i.e., constructing another automaton that recognizes the complement of the ω-regular language recognized by the given Büchi automaton. Existence of algorithms for this construction proves that the set of ω-regular languages is closed under complementation.

This construction is particularly hard relative to the constructions for the other closure properties of Büchi automata. The first construction was presented by Büchi in 1962. Later, other constructions were developed that enabled efficient and optimal complementation.

===Büchi&#x27;s construction===
Büchi presented a doubly exponential complement construction in a logical form. Here, we have his construction in the modern notation used in automata theory.
Let &quot;A&quot; = (&quot;Q&quot;,Σ,Δ,&quot;Q&quot;0,F) be a Büchi automaton.
Let ~&quot;A&quot; be an equivalence relation over elements of Σ+ such that
for each &quot;v,w&quot; ∈ Σ+,
&quot;v&quot; ~&quot;A&quot; &quot;w&quot; if and only if for all &quot;p,q&quot; ∈ &quot;Q&quot;, 
&quot;A&quot; has a run from &quot;p&quot; to &quot;q&quot; over &quot;v&quot; if and only if this is possible over &quot;w&quot; 
and furthermore
&quot;A&quot; has a run via F from &quot;p&quot; to &quot;q&quot; over &quot;v&quot; if and only if this is possible over &quot;w&quot;.
Each class of ~&quot;A&quot; defines a map &quot;f&quot;:&quot;Q&quot; → 2&quot;Q&quot; × 2&quot;Q&quot;
in the following way:
for each state &quot;p&quot; ∈ &quot;Q&quot;, we have (&quot;Q&quot;1,&quot;Q&quot;2)= &quot;f&quot;(&quot;p&quot;), where
&quot;Q&quot;1 = {&quot;q&quot; ∈ &quot;Q&quot; | &quot;w&quot; can move automaton &quot;A&quot; from &quot;p&quot;
to &quot;q&quot;} and &quot;Q&quot;2 = {&quot;q&quot; ∈ &quot;Q&quot; | &quot;w&quot; can move automaton &quot;A&quot; from &quot;p&quot;
to &quot;q&quot; via a state 
in F}.
Note that &quot;Q&quot;2 ⊆ &quot;Q&quot;1.
If &quot;f&quot; is a map definable in this way, we denote the (unique) class defining &quot;f&quot; by &quot;L&quot;&quot;f&quot;.

The following three theorems provide a construction of the complement of &quot;A&quot; 
using the equivalence classes of ~&quot;A&quot;.

Theorem 1: ~&quot;A&quot; has finitely many equivalent classes and each class is a regular language.&lt;br&gt;
Proof:
Since there are finitely many &quot;f&quot;:&quot;Q&quot; → 2&quot;Q&quot; × 2&quot;Q&quot;, the relation ~&quot;A&quot; has finitely many equivalence classes.
Now we show that &quot;L&quot;&quot;f&quot; is a regular language.
For &quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot; ∈ &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;i&quot; ∈ {0,1}, 
let &quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot;,&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot; = ( {0,1}×&quot;Q&quot;, Σ, Δ1∪Δ2, {(0,&quot;p&quot;)}, {(&quot;i&quot;,&quot;q&quot;)} )
be a nondeterministic finite automaton,
where 
Δ1 =
{ ((0,&quot;q&quot;1),(0,&quot;q&quot;2)) | (&quot;q&quot;1,&quot;q&quot;2) ∈ Δ} ∪ 
{ ((1,&quot;q&quot;1),(1,&quot;q&quot;2)) | (&quot;q&quot;1,&quot;q&quot;2) ∈ Δ},
and
Δ2 = 
{ ((0,&quot;q&quot;1),(1,&quot;q&quot;2)) |
&quot;q&quot;1 ∈ F ∧ (&quot;q&quot;1,&quot;q&quot;2) ∈ Δ
Let Q&#x27; ⊆ &quot;Q&quot;.
Let α&quot;p&quot;,Q&#x27; = ∩{ &quot;L&quot;(&quot;A&quot;1,&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;) | &quot;q&quot; ∈ Q&#x27;}, 
which is the set of words that can move &quot;A&quot; from &quot;p&quot; to all the states in Q&#x27; 
via some state in F.
Let β&quot;p&quot;,Q&#x27; = ∩{ &quot;L&quot;(&quot;A&quot;0,&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;)-&quot;L&quot;(&quot;A&quot;1,&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;)-{ε} | &quot;q&quot; ∈ Q&#x27;},
which is the set of non-empty words that can move &quot;A&quot; from &quot;p&quot; to all the states in Q&#x27;
and does not have a run that passes through any state in F.
Let γ&quot;p&quot;,Q&#x27; = ∩{ Σ+-&quot;L&quot;(&quot;A&quot;0,&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;) | &quot;q&quot; ∈ Q&#x27;}, 
which is the set of non-empty words that cannot move &quot;A&quot; from &quot;p&quot; to any of the 
states in Q&#x27;. Since the regular languages are closed under finite intersections and under relative complements, every α&quot;p&quot;,Q&#x27;, β&quot;p&quot;,Q&#x27;, and γ&quot;p&quot;,Q&#x27; is regular.
By definitions, 
&quot;L&quot;&quot;f&quot; = ∩{ α&quot;p&quot;,&quot;Q&quot;2∩
β&quot;p&quot;,&quot;Q&quot;1-&quot;Q&quot;2∩
γ&quot;p&quot;,&quot;Q&quot;-&quot;Q&quot;1
| (&quot;Q&quot;1,&quot;Q&quot;2)=&quot;f&quot;(&quot;p&quot;) ∧ &quot;p&quot; ∈ &quot;Q&quot;}.

Theorem 2: For each &quot;w&quot; ∈ Σω,
there are ~&quot;A&quot; classes &quot;L&quot;&quot;f&quot; and &quot;L&quot;&quot;g&quot; such that
&quot;w&quot; ∈ &quot;L&quot;&quot;f&quot;(&quot;L&quot;&quot;g&quot;)ω.
&lt;br&gt;
Proof: 
We will use the infinite Ramsey theorem 
to prove this theorem.
Let &quot;w&quot; =&quot;a&quot;0&quot;a&quot;1... and &quot;w&quot;(&quot;i&quot;,&quot;j&quot;) = &quot;a&quot;&quot;i&quot;...&quot;a&quot;&quot;j&quot;-1.
Consider the set of natural numbers N.
Let equivalence classes of ~&quot;A&quot; be the colors of subsets of N 
of size 2.
We assign the colors as follows.
For each &quot;i&quot; &lt; &quot;j&quot;,
let the color of {&quot;i&quot;,&quot;j&quot;} be the equivalence class in which &quot;w&quot;(&quot;i&quot;,&quot;j&quot;) occurs.
By the infinite Ramsey theorem, we can find an infinite set &quot;X&quot; ⊆ N
such that each subset of &quot;X&quot; of size 2 has same color.
Let 0 &lt; &quot;i&quot;0 &lt; &quot;i&quot;1 &lt; &quot;i&quot;2 ... ∈ &quot;X&quot;.
Let &quot;f&quot; be a defining map of an equivalence class such that 
&quot;w&quot;(0,&quot;i&quot;0) ∈ &quot;L&quot;&quot;f&quot;.
Let &quot;g&quot; be a defining map of an equivalence class such that 
for each &quot;j&quot;&gt;0,&quot;w&quot;(&quot;i&quot;&quot;j&quot;-1,&quot;i&quot;&quot;j&quot;) ∈ &quot;L&quot;&quot;g&quot;.
Then &quot;w&quot; ∈ &quot;L&quot;&quot;f&quot;(&quot;L&quot;&quot;g&quot;)ω.

Theorem 3: Let &quot;L&quot;&quot;f&quot; and &quot;L&quot;&quot;g&quot; be equivalence classes 
of ~&quot;A&quot;.
Then &quot;L&quot;&quot;f&quot;(&quot;L&quot;&quot;g&quot;)ω is either a subset of &quot;L&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) or 
disjoint from &quot;L&quot;(&quot;A&quot;). &lt;br&gt;
Proof: 
Suppose there is a word &quot;w&quot; ∈ &quot;L&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) ∩ &quot;L&quot;&quot;f&quot;(&quot;L&quot;&quot;g&quot;)ω, otherwise the theorem holds trivially.
Let &quot;r&quot; be an accepting run of &quot;A&quot; over input &quot;w&quot;.
We need to show that each word w&#x27; ∈ &quot;L&quot;&quot;f&quot;(&quot;L&quot;&quot;g&quot;)ω
is also in &quot;L&quot;(&quot;A&quot;), i.e., there exists a run r&#x27; of &quot;A&quot; over input w&#x27; such that
a state in F occurs in r&#x27; infinitely often.
Since &quot;w&quot; ∈ &quot;L&quot;&quot;f&quot;(&quot;L&quot;&quot;g&quot;)ω,
let &quot;w&quot;0w1&quot;w&quot;2... = &quot;w&quot; such that &quot;w&quot;0 ∈ &quot;L&quot;&quot;f&quot; and for each &quot;i&quot; &gt; 0, &quot;w&quot;&quot;i&quot; ∈ &quot;L&quot;&quot;g&quot;.
Let &quot;s&quot;&quot;i&quot; be the state in &quot;r&quot; after consuming &quot;w&quot;0...&quot;w&quot;&quot;i&quot;.
Let &quot;I&quot; be a set of indices such that &quot;i&quot; ∈ &quot;I&quot; if and only if the run segment in &quot;r&quot; 
from &quot;s&quot;&quot;i&quot; to &quot;s&quot;&quot;i&quot;+1 contains a state from F.
&quot;I&quot; must be an infinite set.
Similarly, we can split the word w&#x27;.
Let w&#x27;0w&#x27;1w&#x27;2... = w&#x27; such that w&#x27;0 ∈ &quot;L&quot;&quot;f&quot; and for each &quot;i&quot; &gt; 0, w&#x27;&quot;i&quot; ∈ &quot;L&quot;&quot;g&quot;.
We construct r&#x27; inductively in the following way.
Let the first state of r&#x27; be same as &quot;r&quot;. By definition of &quot;L&quot;&quot;f&quot;, 
we can choose a run segment on word w&#x27;0 to reach &quot;s&quot;0.
By induction hypothesis,
we have a run on w&#x27;0...w&#x27;&quot;i&quot; that reaches to &quot;s&quot;&quot;i&quot;.
By definition of &quot;L&quot;&quot;g&quot;,
we can extend the run along the word segment w&#x27;&quot;i&quot;+1 such that 
the extension reaches si+1 and visits a state in F if &quot;i&quot; ∈ &quot;I&quot;.
The r&#x27; obtained from this process will have infinitely many run segments 
containing states from F, since &quot;I&quot; is infinite.
Therefore, r&#x27; is an accepting run and w&#x27; ∈ &quot;L&quot;(&quot;A&quot;).

By the above theorems, we can represent Σω-&quot;L&quot;(&quot;A&quot;)
as finite union of ω-regular languages of the form &quot;L&quot;&quot;f&quot;(&quot;L&quot;&quot;g&quot;)ω, where &quot;L&quot;&quot;f&quot; and &quot;L&quot;&quot;g&quot; are equivalence classes of ~&quot;A&quot;.
Therefore, Σω-&quot;L&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) is an ω-regular language.
We can translate the language into a Büchi automaton. This construction is doubly exponential in terms of size of &quot;A&quot;.

<text>Asymmetry is the absence of, or a violation of, symmetry (the property of an object being invariant to a transformation, such as reflection). Symmetry is an important property of both physical and abstract systems and it may be displayed in precise terms or in more aesthetic terms. The absence of or violation of symmetry that are either expected or desired can have important consequences for a system.

== In organisms ==
Due to how cells divide in organisms, asymmetry in organisms is fairly usual in at least one dimension, with biological symmetry also being common in at least one dimension.

Louis Pasteur proposed that biological molecules are asymmetric because the cosmic [i.e. physical] forces that preside over their formation are themselves asymmetric. While at his time, and even now, the symmetry of physical processes are highlighted, it is known that there are fundamental physical asymmetries, starting with time.

=== Asymmetry in biology ===

Asymmetry is an important and widespread trait, having evolved numerous times in many organisms and at many levels of organisation (ranging from individual cells, through organs, to entire body-shapes). Benefits of asymmetry sometimes have to do with improved spatial arrangements, such as the left human lung being smaller, and having one fewer lobes than the right lung to make room for the asymmetrical heart. In other examples, division of function between the right and left half may have been beneficial and has driven the asymmetry to become stronger. Such an explanation is usually given for mammal hand or paw preference (handedness), an asymmetry in skill development in mammals. Training the neural pathways in a skill with one hand (or paw) may take less effort than doing the same with both hands.

Nature also provides several examples of handedness in traits that are usually symmetric. The following are examples of animals with obvious left-right asymmetries:

* Most snails, because of torsion during development, show remarkable asymmetry in the shell and in the internal organs.
* Male fiddler crabs have one big claw and one small claw.
* The narwhal&#x27;s tusk is a left incisor which can grow up to 10 feet in length and forms a left-handed helix.
* Flatfish have evolved to swim with one side upward, and as a result have both eyes on one side of their heads.
* Several species of owls exhibit asymmetries in the size and positioning of their ears, which is thought to help locate prey.
* Many animals (ranging from insects to mammals) have asymmetric male genitalia. The evolutionary cause behind this is, in most cases, still a mystery.

=== As an indicator of unfitness ===
* Certain disturbances during the development of the organism, resulting in birth defects.
* Injuries after cell division that cannot be biologically repaired, such as a lost limb from an accident.

Since birth defects and injuries are likely to indicate poor health of the organism, defects resulting in asymmetry often put an animal at a disadvantage when it comes to finding a mate. For example, a greater degree of facial symmetry is seen as more attractive in humans, especially in the context of mate selection. In general, there is a correlation between symmetry and fitness-related traits such as growth rate, fecundity and survivability for many species. This means that, through sexual selection, individuals with greater symmetry (and therefore fitness) tend to be preferred as mates, as they are more likely to produce healthy offspring.

== In structures ==
Pre-modern architectural styles tended to place an emphasis on symmetry, except where extreme site conditions or historical developments lead away from this classical ideal. To the contrary, modernist and postmodern architects became much more free to use asymmetry as a design element.

While most bridges employ a symmetrical form due to intrinsic simplicities of design, analysis and fabrication and economical use of materials, a number of modern bridges have deliberately departed from this, either in response to site-specific considerations or to create a dramatic design statement.

Some asymmetrical structures
=== In fire protection ===
In fire-resistance rated wall assemblies, used in passive fire protection, including, but not limited to, high-voltage transformer fire barriers, asymmetry is a crucial aspect of design. When designing a facility, it is not always certain, that in the event of fire, which &quot;side&quot; a fire may come from. Therefore, many building codes and fire test standards outline, that a symmetrical assembly, need only be tested from one side, because both sides are the same. However, as soon as an assembly is asymmetrical, both sides must be tested and the test report is required to state the results for each side. In practical use, the lowest result achieved is the one that turns up in certification listings. Neither the test sponsor, nor the laboratory can go by an opinion or deduction as to which side was in more peril as a result of contemplated testing and then test only one side. Both must be tested in order to be compliant with test standards and building codes.

== In mathematics ==

In mathematics, asymmetry can arise in various ways. Examples include asymmetric relations, asymmetry of shapes in geometry, asymmetric graphs et cetera.

=== Lines of symmetry ===
When determining whether an object is asymmetrical, look for lines of symmetry. For instance, a square has four lines of symmetry, while a circle has infinite. If a shape has no lines of symmetry, then it is asymmetrical, but if an object has any lines of symmetry, it is symmetrical.

===Asymmetric Relation===

An asymmetric relation is a binary relation formula_1 defined on a set of elements such that if formula_2 holds for elements formula_3 and formula_4, then formula_5 must be false. Stated differently, an asymmetric relation is characterized by a necessary absence of symmetry of the relation in the opposite direction.

Inequalities exemplify asymmetric relations. Consider elements formula_3 and formula_4. If formula_3 is less than formula_4 (formula_10), then formula_3 cannot be greater than formula_4 (formula_13). This highlights how the relations &quot;less than&quot;, and similarly &quot;greater than&quot;, are not symmetric.

In contrast, if formula_3 is equal to formula_4 (formula_16), then formula_4 is also equal to formula_3 (formula_19). Thus the binary relation &quot;equal to&quot; is a symmetric one.

===Asymmetric Tensors===
In general an Asymmetric tensor is defined by the change of signsformula_20 of its solution under the interchange of two indexes.

The Epsilon-tensor is an example of an asymmetric tensor. It is defined as: formula_21

,with formula_22. For even or uneven permutations of the indexes the tensor is either 1 or -1.

== In chemistry ==
Certain molecules are chiral; that is, they cannot be superposed upon their mirror image. Chemically identical molecules with different chirality are called &quot;enantiomers&quot;; this difference in orientation can lead to different properties in the way they react with biological systems.

== In physics ==

Asymmetry arises in physics in a number of different realms.

=== Thermodynamics ===

The original non-statistical formulation of thermodynamics was asymmetrical in time: it claimed that the entropy in a closed system can only increase with time. This was derived from the Second Law (any of the two, Clausius&#x27; or Lord Kelvin&#x27;s statement can be used since they are equivalent) and using the Clausius&#x27; Theorem (see Kerson Huang ). The later theory of statistical mechanics, however, is symmetric in time. Although it states that a system significantly below maximum entropy is very likely to evolve &quot;towards&quot; higher entropy, it also states that such a system is very likely to have evolved &quot;from&quot; higher entropy.

=== Particle physics ===

Symmetry is one of the most powerful tools in particle physics, because it has become evident that practically all laws of nature originate in symmetries. Violations of symmetry therefore present theoretical and experimental puzzles that lead to a deeper understanding of nature. Asymmetries in experimental measurements also provide powerful handles that are often relatively free from background or systematic uncertainties.

==== Parity violation ====
Until the 1950s, it was believed that fundamental physics was left-right symmetric; i.e., that interactions were invariant under parity. Although parity is conserved in electromagnetism, strong interactions and gravity, it turns out to be violated in weak interactions. The Standard Model incorporates parity violation by expressing the weak interaction as a chiral gauge interaction. Only the left-handed components of particles and right-handed components of antiparticles participate in weak interactions in the Standard Model. A consequence of parity violation in particle physics is that neutrinos have only been observed as left-handed particles (and antineutrinos as right-handed particles).

In 1956–1957 Chien-Shiung Wu, E. Ambler, R. W. Hayward, D. D. Hoppes, and R. P. Hudson found a clear violation of parity conservation in the beta decay of cobalt-60. Simultaneously, R. L. Garwin, Leon Lederman, and R. Weinrich modified an existing cyclotron experiment and immediately verified parity violation.

==== CP violation ====
After the discovery of the violation of parity in 1956–57, it was believed that the combined symmetry of parity (P) and simultaneous charge conjugation (C), called &quot;CP&quot;, was preserved. For example, CP transforms a left-handed neutrino into a right-handed antineutrino. In 1964, however, James Cronin and Val Fitch provided clear evidence that CP symmetry was also violated in an experiment with neutral kaons.

CP violation is one of the necessary conditions for the generation of a baryon asymmetry in the early universe.

Combining the CP symmetry with simultaneous time reversal (T) produces a combined symmetry called CPT symmetry. CPT symmetry must be preserved in any Lorentz invariant local quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian. As of 2006, no violations of CPT symmetry have been observed.

==== Baryon asymmetry of the universe ====
The baryons (i.e., the protons and neutrons and the atoms that they comprise) observed so far in the universe are overwhelmingly matter as opposed to anti-matter. This asymmetry is called the baryon asymmetry of the universe.

==== Isospin violation ====

Isospin is the symmetry transformation of the weak interactions. The concept was first introduced by Werner Heisenberg in nuclear physics based on the observations that the masses of the neutron and the proton are almost identical and that the strength of the strong interaction between any pair of nucleons is the same, independent of whether they are protons or neutrons. This symmetry arises at a more fundamental level as a symmetry between up-type and down-type quarks. Isospin symmetry in the strong interactions can be considered as a subset of a larger flavor symmetry group, in which the strong interactions are invariant under interchange of different types of quarks. Including the strange quark in this scheme gives rise to the Eightfold Way scheme for classifying mesons and baryons.

Isospin is violated by the fact that the masses of the up and down quarks are different, as well as by their different electric charges. Because this violation is only a small effect in most processes that involve the strong interactions, isospin symmetry remains a useful calculational tool, and its violation introduces corrections to the isospin-symmetric results.

==== In collider experiments ====

Because the weak interactions violate parity, collider processes that can involve the weak interactions typically exhibit asymmetries in the distributions of the final-state particles. These asymmetries are typically sensitive to the &quot;difference&quot; in the interaction between particles and antiparticles, or between left-handed and right-handed particles. They can thus be used as a sensitive measurement of differences in interaction strength and/or to distinguish a small asymmetric signal from a large but symmetric background.
* A forward-backward asymmetry is defined as AFB=(NF-NB)/(NF+NB), where NF is the number of events in which some particular final-state particle is moving &quot;forward&quot; with respect to some chosen direction (e.g., a final-state electron moving in the same direction as the initial-state electron beam in electron-positron collisions), while NB is the number of events with the final-state particle moving &quot;backward&quot;. Forward-backward asymmetries were used by the LEP experiments to measure the difference in the interaction strength of the Z boson between left-handed and right-handed fermions, which provides a precision measurement of the weak mixing angle.
* A left-right asymmetry is defined as ALR=(NL-NR)/(NL+NR), where NL is the number of events in which some initial- or final-state particle is left-polarized, while NR is the corresponding number of right-polarized events. Left-right asymmetries in Z boson production and decay were measured at the Stanford Linear Collider using the event rates obtained with left-polarized versus right-polarized initial electron beams. Left-right asymmetries can also be defined as asymmetries in the polarization of final-state particles whose polarizations can be measured; e.g., tau leptons.
* A charge asymmetry or particle-antiparticle asymmetry is defined in a similar way. This type of asymmetry has been used to constrain the parton distribution functions of protons at the Tevatron from events in which a produced W boson decays to a charged lepton. The asymmetry between positively and negatively charged leptons as a function of the direction of the W boson relative to the proton beam provides information on the relative distributions of up and down quarks in the proton. Particle-antiparticle asymmetries are also used to extract measurements of CP violation from B meson and anti-B meson production at the BaBar and Belle experiments.

<text>Julio César González Ibarra (July 30, 1976 – March 10, 2012) was a Mexican professional boxer who competed from 1997 to 2011, and held the WBO and lineal light heavyweight titles from 2003 to 2004.

==Amateur career==
Gonzalez was a member of the 1996 Mexican Olympic team, boxing as a light heavyweight. He was eliminated in the 1st round by eventual gold medalist Vasili Jirov of Kazakhstan.

==Professional career==
He entered the professional boxing ranks in 1997 after a moderately successful amateur career and gradually worked his way through the ranks of the light heavyweight journeymen. He had won his first 21 fights by the time he got his first chance at a boxing title, the regional WBC Fecarbox belt, on May 5, 2000. He defeated unbeaten fellow Mexican Jesus Ruiz on a ninth round technical knockout in Commerce, California.

Gonzalez followed that victory up with five more wins, including a 12-round unanimous decision over Julian Letterlough on February 2, 2001, that won him the regional NABO light heavyweight title - and propelled him into the No. 1 contender&#x27;s position in several sanctioning bodies&#x27; ratings.

As the top contender, he earned a fight with WBC, WBA (Super), &amp; IBF champion Roy Jones Jr. in July 2001, in Los Angeles. Gonzalez went the distance with Jones, but lost a unanimous decision for his first career setback.

He took seven months off after the loss to Jones before resuming his career and running off seven straight wins without a loss. Most notable in his comeback streak was a 10-round majority decision over former world champion Glen Johnson on January 24, 2003.

===WBO and lineal light heavyweight champion===
Gonzalez earned his second shot at a world title on October 18, 2003, when he flew to Hamburg, Germany for a showdown with undefeated Dariusz Michalczewski for the Lineal &amp; WBO light heavyweight championship. Going into the fight, Michalczewski was positioned to tie Rocky Marciano&#x27;s all-time record of 49 wins and no losses. He also was looking to extend his own world record of 23 straight successful defenses of the light heavyweight title.

In the fight, Gonzalez seemed to take control of the action in the middle rounds, and fought back strongly when Michalczewski, a knockout artist, got him in trouble a few times. When the fight was over, Gonzalez got the verdict on a 12-round split decision; the judge from Germany was the lone dissenter.

Gonzalez lost his title to Zsolt Erdei on January 17, 2004, by unanimous decision.

He challenged Clinton Woods for the IBF light heavyweight title on September 9, 2005, losing by unanimous decision. He met Woods again in a title fight rematch on September 29, 2007. Woods again won the fight by unanimous decision.

In 2008 he was stopped by undefeated prospect Tavoris Cloud.

== Death ==
On March 10, 2012, Gonzalez was killed on impact in a motorcycle accident when he was hit by a drunk driver in B.C. Sur, Mexico. The Julio Gonzalez Memorial Foundation was started in his memory.

<text>Richard Alexander Burns (17 January 1971 – 25 November 2005) was an English rally driver who won the 2001 World Rally Championship, having previously finished runner-up in the series in 1999 and 2000. He also helped Mitsubishi to the world manufacturers&#x27; title in 1998, and Peugeot in 2002. His co-driver in his whole career was Robert Reid. He is the only Englishman to have won the World Rally Championship as a driver.

==Career==

===Pre-WRC===
Richard Burns was born in Reading, Berkshire, and grew up in Checkendon, Oxfordshire. At the age of eight he first started driving his father&#x27;s old Triumph 2000 in a field near their house. At eleven Burns joined the Under 17 Car Club, where he became driver of the year in 1984. Just two years later his father arranged a trip to Jan Churchill&#x27;s Welsh Forest Rally School near Newtown, Powys, where Burns drove a Ford Escort for the day, and from that moment on he knew what he wanted to do. Richard badgered his father into letting him join the Craven Motor Club, in his home town of Reading, where his talent was quickly spotted by David Williams, a rally enthusiast who would play a major role in Burns&#x27;s early career. In 1988 he entered his first rallies in his own Talbot Sunbeam, but the car was too basic and slow to make much of an impression, so in 1989 he borrowed other competitors&#x27; machines to progress. To this end he rallied the stages of Panaround, Bagshot, Mid-Wales, Millbrook, Severn Valley, Kayel Graphics, and the Cambrian Rally as these were all rallies which included stages used on more prestigious events.

In 1990 he joined the Peugeot Challenge after David Williams bought Burns a Peugeot 205 GTI. Upon winning that series, Richard&#x27;s prize was a chance to drive a World Rally Championship event in Great Britain that same year. Then in 1991 Burns met Robert Reid, the man who was to become his co-driver for the rest of his career, finishing 16th in their first WRC rally together. For 1992 Williams purchased a Group N Subaru Legacy for Burns; with support from Prodrive, they won the National Championship. This year also saw Burns help Colin McRae with his gravel notes as Prodrive viewed Richard as a promising talent for the future. Burns won that year&#x27;s Severn Valley Rally outright despite being in a slower car.

In 1993 he joined the Subaru Rally Team for the British Rally Championship alongside Alister McRae in another Subaru Legacy. He won four rounds that year at the Vauxhall Sport, Pirelli, Scottish, and Manx International to become BRC&#x27;s youngest champion. In the wake of his domestic success, plus a commendable seventh-place finish at a very snowy British WRC round, Burns remained with Subaru for the 1994 and 1995 seasons. He then competed in the Asia Pacific Rally Championship, which included rallies in New Zealand and Australia, but it also allowed him chances at his home event. At the end of 1995, Burns scored an impressive third place in the RAC Rally behind his Subaru teammates fighting for the overall championship, with Carlos Sainz (already a double world champion) finishing second, and Colin McRae winning his first and only WRC title.

===WRC===

====1996–1998: Mitsubishi====
1996 saw an opening with Mitsubishi Ralliart at international level, seized upon with sufficient vigour to guide Burns to victory on that year&#x27;s Rally New Zealand – albeit then, only a fixture within the Asia-Pacific Rally Championship and the FIA 2-Litre World Rally Cup. Even so, the fending off of such calibre competition as works-backed Subaru heavyweights Kenneth Eriksson and Piero Liatti only added gloss to an increasingly favoured reputation. In 1997 he was driving a same car as his team-mate Tommi Makinen had, Group A Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution III, IV, V; however it was re-badged as Carisma GT. His results continued to improve in 1997, from the 8 rallies he participated in, he finished in 4th place five separate times, and was 2nd at the Safari Rally, placing him seventh overall in the championship.

Come 1998, he had won his maiden World Rally Championship event on the Safari, which was known as the most challenging and difficult rally. He then added a second career victory on his swansong outing for Mitsubishi on that year&#x27;s Rally GB, the event where Toyota&#x27;s Carlos Sainz had a dramatic late retirement from fourth that secured the drivers&#x27; title for his team-mate, Tommi Makinen (who retired early in the event), as well as confirming the constructors&#x27; accolade for Mitsubishi.

====1999–2001: Return to Subaru====

Burns returned to the Prodrive-run Subaru World Rally Team under David Richards for the 1999 season, joining Juha Kankkunen and Bruno Thiry as part of the factory team driving Subaru Impreza WRCs, replacing Ford-bound fellow Briton, Colin McRae. Burns worked his way to a career high of second place in the drivers&#x27; standings, adding to his win tally. He also led Subaru to second in the constructors&#x27; series behind the Formula One departing Toyota Team Europe. On that year&#x27;s Rally Argentina, he was upstaged for victory by virtue of a team order mix-up by veteran team-mate Kankkunen. Burns again finished second behind Kankkunen at the 1000 Lakes Rally, which was considered to be impressive given it was only his second start on a rally known for favouring experienced drivers. He was a long-time contender for the title in 2000, but crashed out on the Rally Finland in mid-season handing the momentum to eventual champion, and future team-mate, the Peugeot driver Marcus Grönholm who had been competing in his first year as a full-time factory driver. Even so, a stirling comeback from the lower reaches of the top thirty to win on the season-ending Rally of Great Britain kept the Burns name well entrenched within public consciousness.
The 2001 rally season began inauspiciously for Burns – neither of the season curtain raisers, the Monte Carlo Rally or the Swedish Rally, yielded points scores, placing in peril before it had begun, the Englishman&#x27;s title bid. Fourth place in a rain-drenched Portugal kicked his campaign into action prior to second-place finishes on the gravel rallies of Argentina and Cyprus, on both occasions to Ford&#x27;s Colin McRae. Nonetheless, both the Scotsman and Monte Carlo victor Tommi Mäkinen were later to hit upon snags of their own, while Burns&#x27;s own consistent points scoring culminated in a first and only individual rally victory of the season in New Zealand, with McRae beaten into second. Burns then finished second on the Rally Australia to close within two points of new standalone series leader McRae, although the Scotsman and Mäkinen were to struggle to fifth and sixth respectively on this event (and the last of the drivers&#x27; points-scoring positions) amid controversy over McRae arriving to time control too late at the end of the first leg of the event to be able to choose a favourable running order on the ball-bearing gravel for day two. Meanwhile, the Finn, for his part, continued to struggle with a newly homologated version of the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution World Rally Car he had been entrusted with, which had only been introduced by his team a few rounds earlier in San Remo. A four-way title decider, also including nine-point adrift outsider, Ford driver Carlos Sainz, thus beckoned on the final round of the series in Great Britain.

There, all three of Burns&#x27;s rivals were to have suffered retirement from the event by the end of the second leg proceedings on Saturday. On Sunday, 25 November 2001, therefore, Burns&#x27;s third-place finish behind Peugeot duo Gronholm and Harri Rovanpera enabled him to become the first Englishman to win the World Rally Championship, with 44 points, he was world champion with the lowest points total since the Formula 1-styled point system was introduced in 1997. When Burns passed the finishing line at the final stage of the final rally in 2001, he uttered words thought to be paying tribute to his codriver Robert Reid: &quot;You&#x27;re the best in the world&quot;. To commemorate the title success, Subaru produced a special edition of the Subaru Impreza in the UK called the RB5. A messy legal battle ensued for the Englishman&#x27;s services for the following 2002 season, from which fresh suitors, 2000 and 2001 manufacturers&#x27; champions Peugeot emerged victorious.

====2002–2003: Return to Peugeot====

Burns returned to the Peugeot for the 2002 season. Although Peugeot were the pacesetting team of the period, Burns had difficulty matching the pace of team-mates Marcus Grönholm (on gravel) and Gilles Panizzi (on tarmac). Therefore, the existing tally of ten WRC triumphs were not to be added to, with the quest for a second world title proving equally fruitless for Burns. He won the Rally Argentina, but soon he was disqualified as his 206 was found underweight, handing the victory to Sainz, and in Rally New Zealand he was leading until towards the end of day 2 when he rolled his car, forcing him to retire. He cobbled together a title challenge, albeit founded more on regular podium finishes than on victories, for much of the 2003 season – a feat which did not convince him to remain at the wheel of the 206 WRC.

In the 2003 season he was still winless, although seven podiums means he led the championship at most of the season. The gloomy prospect of a continued winning drought with the French team left Burns poised to rejoin Subaru, having signed for them for the second time beginning with the 2004 season, the ploy being to couple him with the eventual 2003 title winner, Norway&#x27;s Petter Solberg. In November 2003, however, with the Englishman heading to the season-ending Wales Rally GB still with a chance of winning the title, Burns suffered a blackout while driving with Ford driver Markko Märtin to the rally. He was withdrawn from the event, and thus the title fight, and was later diagnosed with an astrocytoma, a type of malignant brain tumour. Treatment during 2004 was followed by surgery in April 2005 that was described as &quot;very successful&quot;. But the diagnosis, that this type of brain tumor was malignant, was only soon realised. In August 2005 a fan day was made in which Burns&#x27;s supporters were invited to see his private car collection, but he was unable to drive so his co-driver Robert Reid took the seat on his private cars.

==Personal life==
In 2001, Burns emigrated from Britain to Andorra, reportedly for tax purposes.

==Death==
Late on Friday, 25 November 2005, four years to the day after winning the 2001 World Rally Championship, Burns died at the Wellington Hospital in St John’s Wood, London, aged 34, after having been in a coma for some days as a result of a brain tumour. A memorial service was held at St Luke&#x27;s Church, Chelsea on Thursday 22 December 2005, with readings from BBC TV&#x27;s Jeremy Clarkson and Steve Rider, and a tribute paid by one of his closest friends, photographer Colin McMaster. He was buried at St Peter and St Paul, Checkendon.

British television show &quot;Top Gear&quot; aired a tribute to Burns. The host, Jeremy Clarkson, said that &quot;the news has been completely dominated, as far as we&#x27;re concerned, by the sad death of Richard Burns.&quot; No other motoring news was announced in that episode. Burns had previously appeared on &quot;Top Gear&quot; twice, once touting rallying as more interesting and influential than Formula One, and then test-driving the Peugeot RC.
Subaru paid tribute to Burns at Castle Combe in 2006, when over fifty Subaru Impreza RB5s took to the track, including the RB5 No. 001 driven by Alex Burns, Richard&#x27;s father. They also released a special edition Impreza WRX STI in 2007 – the RB320 – in memory of Burns. It features a 320 bhp (240 kW) Prodrive Performance Pack, &quot;Prodrive&quot; developed suspension, sports spring kit and is available only in &quot;obsidian black&quot; colour. Proceeds went to the RB Foundation.

During the 2006 Goodwood Festival of Speed, the RB foundation, named for Burns&#x27;s initials, was inaugurated, with its stated aim being to &quot;inspire and support people with serious injury and illness.&quot; The foundation also raises money for the Michael Park Fund, which deals with improving safety in motorsport events. British band Travis dedicated their album &quot;The Boy with No Name&quot; (2007) to Burns&#x27;s memory.

===Richard Burns Trophy===
In 2006, the young driver&#x27;s award in the Wales Rally GB was renamed the Richard Burns Trophy in his honour. It is awarded to the highest placed, non-priority driver who is 25 years old or younger.

<text>In mathematics, the Leech lattice is an even unimodular lattice Λ24 in 24-dimensional Euclidean space, which is one of the best models for the kissing number problem. It was discovered by . It may also have been discovered (but not published) by Ernst Witt in 1940.

==Characterization==

The Leech lattice Λ24 is the unique lattice in 24-dimensional Euclidean space, E24, with the following list of properties:

*It is unimodular; i.e., it can be generated by the columns of a certain 24×24 matrix with determinant 1.
*It is even; i.e., the square of the length of each vector in Λ24 is an even integer.
*The length of every non-zero vector in Λ24 is at least 2.

The last condition is equivalent to the condition that unit balls centered at the points of Λ24 do not overlap. Each is tangent to 196,560 neighbors, and this is known to be the largest number of non-overlapping 24-dimensional unit balls that can simultaneously touch a single unit ball. This arrangement of 196,560 unit balls centred about another unit ball is so efficient that there is no room to move any of the balls; this configuration, together with its mirror-image, is the &quot;only&quot; 24-dimensional arrangement where 196,560 unit balls simultaneously touch another. This property is also true in 1, 2 and 8 dimensions, with 2, 6 and 240 unit balls, respectively, based on the integer lattice, hexagonal tiling and E8 lattice, respectively.

It has no root system and in fact is the first unimodular lattice with no &quot;roots&quot; (vectors of norm less than 4), and therefore has a centre density of 1. By multiplying this value by the volume of a unit ball in 24 dimensions, formula_1, one can derive its absolute density.

 showed that the Leech lattice is isometric to the set of simple roots (or the Dynkin diagram) of the reflection group of the 26-dimensional even Lorentzian unimodular lattice II25,1. By comparison, the Dynkin diagrams of II9,1 and II17,1 are finite.

==Applications==

The binary Golay code, independently developed in 1949, is an application in coding theory. More specifically, it is an error-correcting code capable of correcting up to three errors in each 24-bit word, and detecting up to four. It was used to communicate with the Voyager probes, as it is much more compact than the previously-used Hadamard code.

Quantizers, or analog-to-digital converters, can use lattices to minimise the average root-mean-square error. Most quantizers are based on the one-dimensional integer lattice, but using multi-dimensional lattices reduces the RMS error. The Leech lattice is a good solution to this problem, as the Voronoi cells have a low second moment.

The vertex algebra of the two-dimensional conformal field theory describing bosonic string theory, compactified on the 24-dimensional quotient torus R24/Λ24 and orbifolded by a two-element reflection group, provides an explicit construction of the Griess algebra that has the monster group as its automorphism group. This monster vertex algebra was also used to prove the monstrous moonshine conjectures.

==Constructions==

The Leech lattice can be constructed in a variety of ways. Like all lattices, it can be constructed by taking the integral span of the columns of its generator matrix, a 24×24 matrix with determinant 1.

===Using the binary Golay code===

The Leech lattice can be explicitly constructed as the set of vectors of the form 2−3/2(&quot;a&quot;1, &quot;a&quot;2, ..., &quot;a&quot;24) where the &quot;a&quot;&quot;i&quot; are integers such that

:formula_2

and for each fixed residue class modulo 4, the 24 bit word, whose 1s correspond to the coordinates &quot;i&quot; such that &quot;a&quot;&quot;i&quot; belongs to this residue class, is a word in the binary Golay code. The Golay code, together with the related Witt design, features in a construction for the 196560 minimal vectors in the Leech lattice.

Leech lattice (L mod 8) can be directly constructed by combination of the 3 following sets,

formula_3 , (formula_4 is a ones vector of size n),
* G - 24-bit Golay code
* B - Binary integer sequence
* C - Thue-Morse Sequence or integer bit parity sum (that give chirality of the lattice)

===Using the Lorentzian lattice II25,1===

The Leech lattice can also be constructed as formula_5 where &quot;w&quot; is the Weyl vector:

:formula_6

in the 26-dimensional even Lorentzian unimodular lattice II25,1. The existence of such an integral vector of Lorentzian norm zero relies on the fact that 12 + 22 + ... + 242 is a perfect square (in fact 702); the number 24 is the only integer bigger than 1 with this property (see cannonball problem). This was conjectured by Édouard Lucas, but the proof came much later, based on elliptic functions.

The vector
formula_7
in this construction is really the Weyl vector of the even sublattice &quot;D&quot;24 of the odd unimodular lattice &quot;I&quot;25. More generally, if &quot;L&quot; is any positive definite unimodular lattice of dimension 25 with at least 4 vectors of norm 1, then the Weyl vector of its norm 2 roots has integral length, and there is a similar construction of the Leech lattice using &quot;L&quot; and this Weyl vector.

===Based on other lattices===

 described another 23 constructions for the Leech lattice, each based on a Niemeier lattice. It can also be constructed by using three copies of the E8 lattice, in the same way that the binary Golay code can be constructed using three copies of the extended Hamming code, H8. This construction is known as the Turyn construction of the Leech lattice.

===As a laminated lattice===

Starting with a single point, Λ0, one can stack copies of the lattice Λn to form an (&quot;n&quot; + 1)-dimensional lattice, Λ&quot;n&quot;+1, without reducing the minimal distance between points. Λ1 corresponds to the integer lattice, Λ2 is to the hexagonal lattice, and Λ3 is the face-centered cubic packing. showed that the Leech lattice is the unique laminated lattice in 24 dimensions.

===As a complex lattice===

The Leech lattice is also a 12-dimensional lattice over the Eisenstein integers. This is known as the complex Leech lattice, and is isomorphic to the 24-dimensional real Leech lattice. In the complex construction of the Leech lattice, the binary Golay code is replaced with the ternary Golay code, and the Mathieu group &quot;M&quot;24 is replaced with the Mathieu group &quot;M&quot;12. The &quot;E&quot;6 lattice, &quot;E&quot;8 lattice and Coxeter–Todd lattice also have constructions as complex lattices, over either the Eisenstein or Gaussian integers.

===Using the icosian ring===

The Leech lattice can also be constructed using the ring of icosians. The icosian ring is abstractly isomorphic to the E8 lattice, three copies of which can be used to construct the Leech lattice using the Turyn construction.

===Witt&#x27;s construction===

In 1972 Witt gave the following construction, which he said he found in 1940, on January 28. Suppose that &quot;H&quot; is an &quot;n&quot; by &quot;n&quot; Hadamard matrix, where &quot;n&quot;=4&quot;ab&quot;. Then the matrix formula_8 defines a bilinear form in 2&quot;n&quot; dimensions, whose kernel has &quot;n&quot; dimensions. The quotient by this kernel is a nonsingular bilinear form taking values in (1/2)Z. It has 3 sublattices of index 2 that are integral bilinear forms. Witt obtained the Leech lattice as one of these three sublattices by taking &quot;a&quot;=2, &quot;b&quot;=3, and taking &quot;H&quot; to be the 24 by 24 matrix (indexed by Z/23Z ∪ ∞) with entries Χ(&quot;m&quot;+&quot;n&quot;) where Χ(∞)=1, Χ(0)=−1, Χ(&quot;n&quot;)=is the quadratic residue symbol mod 23 for nonzero &quot;n&quot;. This matrix &quot;H&quot; is a Paley matrix with some insignificant sign changes.

===Using a Paley matrix===

 described a construction using a
skew Hadamard matrix of Paley type.
The Niemeier lattice with root system formula_9 can be made into a module
for the ring of integers of the field formula_10. Multiplying this
Niemeier lattice by a non-principal ideal of the ring of integers gives the Leech lattice.

===Using higher power residue codes===
 constructed the Leech lattice using higher power residue codes over the ring formula_11. A similar construction is used to construct some of the other lattices of rank 24.

===Using octonions===
If &quot;L&quot; is the set of octonions with coordinates on the formula_12 lattice, then the Leech lattice is the set of triplets formula_13 such that

:formula_14

:formula_15

:formula_16

where formula_17. This construction is due to .

==Symmetries==

The Leech lattice is highly symmetrical. Its automorphism group is the Conway group Co0, which is of order 8 315 553 613 086 720 000. The center of Co0 has two elements, and the quotient of Co0 by this center is the Conway group Co1, a finite simple group. Many other sporadic groups, such as the remaining Conway groups and Mathieu groups, can be constructed as the stabilizers of various configurations of vectors in the Leech lattice.

Despite having such a high &quot;rotational&quot; symmetry group, the Leech lattice does not possess any hyperplanes of reflection symmetry. In other words, the Leech lattice is chiral. It also has far fewer symmetries than the 24-dimensional hypercube and simplex, or even the Cartesian product of three copies of the E8 lattice.

The automorphism group was first described by John Conway. The 398034000 vectors of norm 8 fall into 8292375 &#x27;crosses&#x27; of 48 vectors. Each cross contains 24 mutually orthogonal vectors and their negatives, and thus describe the vertices of a 24-dimensional orthoplex. Each of these crosses can be taken to be the coordinate system of the lattice, and has the same symmetry of the Golay code, namely 212 × |M24|. Hence the full automorphism group of the Leech lattice has order 8292375 × 4096 × 244823040, or 8 315 553 613 086 720 000.

==Geometry==

 showed that the covering radius of the Leech lattice is formula_18; in other words, if we put a closed ball of this radius around each lattice point, then these just cover Euclidean space. The points at distance at least formula_18 from all lattice points are called the deep holes of the Leech lattice. There are 23 orbits of them under the automorphism group of the Leech lattice, and these orbits correspond to the 23 Niemeier lattices other than the Leech lattice: the set of vertices of deep hole is isometric to the affine Dynkin diagram of the corresponding Niemeier lattice.

The Leech lattice has a density of formula_20. showed that it gives the densest lattice packing of balls in 24-dimensional space. improved this by showing that it is the densest sphere packing, even among non-lattice packings.

The 196560 minimal vectors are of three different varieties, known as &quot;shapes&quot;:

* formula_21 vectors of shape (42,022), for all permutations and sign choices;
* formula_22 vectors of shape (28,016), where the &#x27;2&#x27;s correspond to an octad in the Golay code, and there are any even number of minus signs;
* formula_23 vectors of shape (∓3,±123), where the lower sign is used for the &#x27;1&#x27;s of any codeword of the Golay code, and the &#x27;∓3&#x27; can appear in any position.

The ternary Golay code, binary Golay code and Leech lattice give very efficient 24-dimensional spherical codes of 729, 4096 and 196560 points, respectively. Spherical codes are higher-dimensional analogues of Tammes problem, which arose as an attempt to explain the distribution of pores on pollen grains. These are distributed as to maximise the minimal angle between them. In two dimensions, the problem is trivial, but in three dimensions and higher it is not. An example of a spherical code in three dimensions is the set of the 12 vertices of the regular icosahedron.

==Theta series==

One can associate to any (positive-definite) lattice Λ a theta function given by

:formula_24

The theta function of a lattice is then a holomorphic function on the upper half-plane. Furthermore, the theta function of an even unimodular lattice of rank &quot;n&quot; is actually a modular form of weight &quot;n&quot;/2 for the full modular group PSL(2,Z). The theta function of an integral lattice is often written as a power series in formula_25 so that the coefficient of &quot;q&quot;&quot;n&quot; gives the number of lattice vectors of squared norm 2&quot;n&quot;. In the Leech lattice, there are 196560 vectors of squared norm 4, 16773120 vectors of squared norm 6, 398034000 vectors of squared norm 8 and so on. The theta series of the Leech lattice is

: formula_26

where formula_27 is the normalized Eisenstein series of weight 12, formula_28 is the modular discriminant, formula_29 is the divisor function for exponent 11, and formula_30 is the Ramanujan tau function. It follows that for &quot;m&quot;≥1 the number of vectors of squared norm 2&quot;m&quot; is

: formula_31

==History==
Many of the cross-sections of the Leech lattice, including the Coxeter–Todd lattice and Barnes–Wall lattice, in 12 and 16 dimensions, were found much earlier than the Leech lattice. discovered a related odd unimodular lattice in 24 dimensions, now called the &quot;odd Leech lattice&quot;, one of whose two even neighbors is the Leech lattice. The Leech lattice was discovered in 1965 by , by improving some earlier sphere packings he found .

 calculated the order of the automorphism group of the Leech lattice, and, working with John G. Thompson, discovered three new sporadic groups as a by-product: the Conway groups, Co1, Co2, Co3. They also showed that four other (then) recently announced sporadic groups, namely, Higman-Sims, Suzuki, McLaughlin, and the Janko group J2 could be found inside the Conway groups using the geometry of the Leech lattice. (Ronan, p. 155)
, has a single rather cryptic sentence mentioning that he found more than 10 even unimodular lattices in 24 dimensions without giving further details. stated that he found 9 of these lattices earlier in 1938, and found two more, the Niemeier lattice with A root system and the Leech lattice (and also the odd Leech lattice), in 1940.

<doc id="344922" wikidata="Q7002196" url="?curid=344922" title="Neuroevolution of augmenting topologies">
<text>NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) is a genetic algorithm (GA) for the generation of evolving artificial neural networks (a neuroevolution technique) developed by Kenneth Stanley and Risto Miikkulainen in 2002 while at The University of Texas at Austin. It alters both the weighting parameters and structures of networks, attempting to find a balance between the fitness of evolved solutions and their diversity. It is based on applying three key techniques: tracking genes with history markers to allow crossover among topologies, applying speciation (the evolution of species) to preserve innovations, and developing topologies incrementally from simple initial structures (&quot;complexifying&quot;).

== Performance ==
On simple control tasks, the NEAT algorithm often arrives at effective networks more quickly than other contemporary neuro-evolutionary techniques and reinforcement learning methods, as of 2006.

== Algorithm ==
Traditionally, a neural network topology is chosen by a human experimenter, and effective connection weight values are learned through a training procedure. This yields a situation whereby a trial and error process may be necessary in order to determine an appropriate topology. NEAT is an example of a topology and weight evolving artificial neural network (TWEANN) which attempts to simultaneously learn weight values and an appropriate topology for a neural network.

In order to encode the network into a phenotype for the GA, NEAT uses a direct encoding scheme which means every connection and neuron is explicitly represented. This is in contrast to indirect encoding schemes which define rules that allow the network to be constructed without explicitly representing every connection and neuron, allowing for more compact representation.

The NEAT approach begins with a perceptron-like feed-forward network of only input neurons and output neurons. As evolution progresses through discrete steps, the complexity of the network&#x27;s topology may grow, either by inserting a new neuron into a connection path, or by creating a new connection between (formerly unconnected) neurons.

=== Competing conventions ===
The competing conventions problem arises when there is more than one way of representing information in a phenotype. For example, if a genome contains neurons &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; and is represented by [A B C], if this genome is crossed with an identical genome (in terms of functionality) but ordered [C B A] crossover will yield children that are missing information ([A B A] or [C B C]), in fact 1/3 of the information has been lost in this example. NEAT solves this problem by tracking the history of genes by the use of a global innovation number which increases as new genes are added. When adding a new gene the global innovation number is incremented and assigned to that gene. Thus the higher the number the more recently the gene was added. For a particular generation if an identical mutation occurs in more than one genome they are both given the same number, beyond that however the mutation number will remain unchanged indefinitely.

These innovation numbers allow NEAT to match up genes which can be crossed with each other.

== Implementation ==
The original implementation by Ken Stanley is published under the GPL. It integrates with Guile, a GNU scheme interpreter. This implementation of NEAT is considered the conventional basic starting point for implementations of the NEAT algorithm.

== Extensions ==

=== rtNEAT ===
In 2003, Stanley devised an extension to NEAT that allows evolution to occur in real time rather than through the iteration of generations as used by most genetic algorithms. The basic idea is to put the population under constant evaluation with a &quot;lifetime&quot; timer on each individual in the population. When a network&#x27;s timer expires, its current fitness measure is examined to see whether it falls near the bottom of the population, and if so, it is discarded and replaced by a new network bred from two high-fitness parents. A timer is set for the new network and it is placed in the population to participate in the ongoing evaluations.

The first application of rtNEAT is a video game called Neuro-Evolving Robotic Operatives, or NERO. In the first phase of the game, individual players deploy robots in a &#x27;sandbox&#x27; and train them to some desired tactical doctrine. Once a collection of robots has been trained, a second phase of play allows players to pit their robots in a battle against robots trained by some other player, to see how well their training regimens prepared their robots for battle.

=== Phased pruning ===
An extension of Ken Stanley&#x27;s NEAT, developed by Colin Green, adds periodic pruning of the network topologies of candidate solutions during the evolution process. This addition addressed concern that unbounded automated growth would generate unnecessary structure.

=== HyperNEAT ===

HyperNEAT is specialized to evolve large scale structures. It was originally based on the CPPN theory and is an active field of research.

=== cgNEAT ===

Content-Generating NEAT (cgNEAT) evolves custom video game content based on user preferences. The first video game to implement cgNEAT is Galactic Arms Race, a space-shooter game in which unique particle system weapons are evolved based on player usage statistics. Each particle system weapon in the game is controlled by an evolved CPPN, similarly to the evolution technique in the NEAT Particles interactive art program.

=== odNEAT ===
odNEAT is an online and decentralized version of NEAT designed for multi-robot systems. odNEAT is executed onboard robots themselves during task execution to continuously optimize the parameters and the topology of the artificial neural network-based controllers. In this way, robots executing odNEAT have the potential to adapt to changing conditions and learn new behaviors as they carry out their tasks. The online evolutionary process is implemented according to a physically distributed island model. Each robot optimizes an internal population of candidate solutions (intra-island variation), and two or more robots exchange candidate solutions when they meet (inter-island migration). In this way, each robot is potentially self-sufficient and the evolutionary process capitalizes on the exchange of controllers between multiple robots for faster synthesis of effective controllers.

<text>HMS &quot;Enterprise (historically spelled Enterprize&quot;) was a 28-gun sixth-rate &quot;Enterprise&quot;-class frigate of the Royal Navy. She was the name ship of her class of twenty-seven ships.

==Construction==
&quot;Enterprise&quot; was built at Deptford Royal Dockyard, England, launched in August 1774, and was commissioned in April 1775 under the command of Captain Sir Thomas Rich. During her construction she was also the subject of a pair of oil paintings by Joseph Marshall, simulating her ship model but actually drawn from her designs - these were completed in 1777 as part of a series of such paintings commissioned by George III of the United Kingdom. The pair showing &quot;Enterprise&quot; are now split between the National Maritime Museum and the Science Museum.

==Career==
&quot;Enterprise&quot; served throughout the American Revolutionary War as cruiser and convoy escort. She captured a prize off Cape Henry on 19 July 1778. On 7 June 1780, &quot;Enterprise&quot;, under command of Captain Patrick Leslie (not to be confused with Patrick Leslie), was at anchor in the Bay of Gibraltar with other ships of the Royal Navy. At about 1:30am, &quot;Enterprise&quot; saw some vessels drifting toward the harbour. When they came within hailing distance, the seaman on watch called a challenge. The six drifting vessels were set afire by their crews, who made their escape in small boats, leaving the flaming hulks drifting toward the British ships. Captain Leslie fired a three-gun salvo to warn the other ships, cut his anchor lines to let &quot;Enterprise&quot; drift away from the hulks, and then opened fire on the hulks in an attempt to sink them. With the Spanish fleet waiting just outside the harbour for any British ships trying to escape, the British seamen took to small boats and, at great peril to their lives, boarded the flaming hulks to attach lines to pull them away from their own ships and burn themselves out.

After this action and continued service in the Mediterranean, she sailed under the command of Captain John Payne on 27 April 1782, for the Leeward Islands in the Caribbean. In October 1782, now under the command of Captain William Carnegie, she captured the 22-gun American privateer &quot;Mohawk&quot;, which the Royal Navy took into service under her existing name, before selling her in 1783.

==Fate==

&quot;Enterprise&quot; was decommissioned in May 1784. From 1790 she was stationed in port in British home waters as a receiving ship, monitoring the arrival of foreign vessels. In 1791, during the war scare known as the Spanish Armament, she was hulked as a receiving ship for impressed men at the Tower of London. In 1806 she was taken to Deptford and broken up in 1807.

In April 1806, another &quot;Enterprise&quot;-class frigate, (built at Rotherhithe in 1777–78) joined her sister ship at the Tower as another receiving ship to accommodate men taken up by another press at the end of the Peace of Amiens and the outbreak of the Napoleonic War. &quot;Resource&quot; was renamed &quot;Enterprise&quot;; she was broken up in 1816.

<text>Carpatair [[S.A. (corporation)|S.A.]] is a privately-owned Romanian charter and former regional airline headquartered in Timișoara.

== History ==
Carpatair was established in 1999 and started operations in February 1999 in Cluj-Napoca. The present title was adopted in December 1999 when Swiss and Swedish investors took a 49% stake in the company. The airline is owned by Romanian shareholders (51%) and Swiss and Swedish shareholders (49%) The airline is an IATA member since 2006, and has recently successfully received its 5th IOSA (IATA Operational Safety Audit) registration. Carpatair employed 450 staff at March 2007. The current President and Chief Executive of Carpatair is Nicolae Petrov.

Carpatair emerged from the status of insolvency into the one &quot;in reorganization&quot;, having continued to offer charter &amp; ACMI solutions. The carrier had filed for Insolvency on 23 January 2014. The statute used was Romanian Law 85/2006, which is very similar to the Chapter 11 status known in the USA, providing the company a special legal status.

==Destinations==
As of May 2014, Carpatair dissolved most of its route network; it no longer operates in Romania or Moldova. Carpatair operations now consists of ad-hoc and ACMI charters.

From December 2015, Carpatair operated for Adria Airways between Örebro in Sweden and Copenhagen in Denmark, and also under an NJ flight code route between Stockholm Arlanda Airport and Arvidsjaur/Gällivare in Sweden. From March 2016 until June of the same year, they flew under the Adria Airways call sign from Tallinn. During spring and summer 2016 one aircraft flew under contract for Volotea in France and Italy. From July 2016 they operated the route Stavanger - Oslo under contract for Norwegian Air Shuttle, and a number of routes from Brussels Airport on contract from Brussels Airlines. In summer 2016 Carpatair operated one aircraft on a wet-lease for LOT Polish Airlines on routes from Warsaw to Amsterdam and Gdańsk. Between April and May 2017, Carpatair operated services between Berlin-Tegel and Prague on behalf of now defunct Air Berlin. During the 2018 summer schedule, one aircraft was wet-leased to KLM to operate a couple of European routes from Amsterdam.

==Fleet==


===Current fleet===
As of January 2024, the Carpatair fleet consists of the following aircraft:

===Retired fleet===
Carpatair previously also operated the following types of aircraft:


==Incidents and accidents==
* On 2 February 2013, a Carpatair ATR 72–212A operating on behalf of Alitalia experienced a hard landing because of strong gusty wind at Leonardo da Vinci–Fiumicino Airport in Rome while arriving from Pisa. Sixteen people were injured, two seriously, of which one was the co-pilot.

<text>HMS &quot;Enterprise&quot; was an Arctic discovery ship laid down as a merchant vessel and purchased in 1848 before launch to search for Sir John Franklin&#x27;s lost expedition. She made two Arctic voyages before becoming a coal depot, and was finally sold in 1903. She was the tenth &quot;Enterprise&quot; (or &quot;Enterprize&quot;) to serve in the Royal Navy.

==Construction==
She was laid down as a merchant vessel at the Blackwall yard on the River Thames of Money Wigram and Sons, but purchased by the Admiralty in February 1848 and fitted for Arctic exploration. She was launched on 5 April 1848.

==Career==
&quot;Enterprise&quot; made two voyages to the Arctic, the first via the Atlantic in 1848-1849 under James Clark Ross, then in 1850-1854 via the Pacific and the Bering Strait in an expedition led by Richard Collinson. From 1860 she was lent to the Commissioners of Northern Lights for use as a coal hulk at Oban, and from 1889 she was lent to the Board of Trade. She was sold in 1903.

<text>Optics is the branch of physics which involves the behavior and properties of light, including its interactions with matter and the construction of instruments that use or detect it. Optics usually describes the behavior of visible, ultraviolet, and infrared light. Because light is an electromagnetic wave, other forms of electromagnetic radiation such as X-rays, microwaves, and radio waves exhibit similar properties.

<text>The seventh HMS &quot;Enterprise&quot; of the Royal Navy was an armoured sloop launched in 1864 at Deptford Dockyard. Originally laid down as a wooden screw sloop of the &quot;Camelion&quot; class, she was redesigned by Edward Reed and completed as a central battery ironclad. The ship spent the bulk of her career assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet before returning to England in 1871 where she was paid off. &quot;Enterprise&quot; was sold for scrap in 1885.

==Design and description==
The ship had a length between perpendiculars of , a beam of , and a draught of at deep load. She displaced . Her crew consisted of 130 officers and men.

&quot;Enterprise&quot;″s wooden hull was remodeled shortly after she was laid down; she was given a plough-shaped ram bow and a semi-circular stern. The ship had only two decks: the main deck, very close to the ship&#x27;s waterline, and the upper deck which carried her armament, about above the waterline. She was the first ship of composite construction in the Royal Navy, with iron upperworks.

===Propulsion===
&quot;Enterprise&quot; had a Ravenhill, Salkeld &amp; Co. direct-acting horizontal single-expansion 2-cylinder direct acting steam engine driving a single propeller. Steam was provided by a pair of tubular boilers. The engine produced which gave the ship a maximum speed around . &quot;Enterprise&quot; carried of coal. As built, her funnel was mounted in the middle of the battery for protection, which impaired the working of her guns until it was relocated forward of the battery in November 1864. She was barque-rigged with three masts and had a sail area of . Her best speed under sail and steam was .

===Armament===
&quot;Enterprise&quot; was armed with two 100-pounder smoothbore, muzzle-loading Somerset cannon and two rifled 110-pounder breech-loading guns. The breech-loading guns were of a new design from Armstrong and much was hoped for them. Firing tests carried out in September 1861 against an armoured target, however, proved that the 110-pounder was inferior to the 68-pounder smoothbore gun in armour penetration, and repeated incidents of breech explosions during the Battles for Shimonoseki and the Bombardment of Kagoshima in 1863–64 caused the navy to withdraw the guns from service shortly afterwards.

In an attempt to provide axial fire the sides of the hull at the upper deck level were cut away in front and behind the battery and covered by a . The bulwark hinged inwards and covered a gun port though which a gun could traverse and fire. While providing better coverage than the traditional broadside layout this still left a 120° arc forward and another aft on which no gun could bear.

The solid shot of the Somerset gun weighed approximately while the gun itself weighed . The gun had a velocity of at and had a range of . The shell of the 110-pounder Armstrong breech-loader weighed . It had a muzzle velocity of and, at an elevation of 11.25°, a maximum range of . The 110-pounder gun weighed . All of the guns could fire both solid shot and explosive shells. Both guns were mounted on wooden gun carriages with slides &quot;which were difficult to traverse even on an even keel; in a seaway few captains would have run the risk of casting them loose.&quot;

&quot;Enterprise&quot; was rearmed during her 1868 refit with four rifled muzzle-loading guns. The 16-calibre 7-inch gun weighed and fired a shell. It was credited with the ability to penetrate armour.

===Armour===
&quot;Enterprise&quot; had a complete waterline belt of wrought iron that was thick. It protected only the main deck and was shallow, reaching just below the waterline. The guns were protected by a section of 4.5-inch armour, long, and by 4.5-inch transverse bulkheads. The armour was backed by of teak wood. The total weight of her armour was .

==Service==
The ship was laid down on 5 May 1862 at the Royal Dockyard in Deptford, England, as the 17-gun sloop &quot;Circassian&quot;. She was renamed &quot;Enterprise&quot; in July 1862 and reclassified as an armoured corvette. Construction had barely begun before she was redesigned with an iron upper hull as well as armoured sides and battery. The ship was launched on 9 February 1864, commissioned on 5 May 1864 and completed on 3 June 1864. She cost £62,474 to build. &quot;Enterprise&quot; initially served with the Channel Fleet. On 13 August, she ran aground. Repairs cost £4. She was subsequently transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet where she remained until 1871 when she returned to England. She was refitted and rearmed at Malta in 1868. Upon her return the ship was paid off into 4th Class Reserve in August 1871 at Sheerness. &quot;Enterprise&quot; was sold for scrap in 1885 for £2,072. On 6 October 1889, &quot;Enterprise&quot; was being towed from Plymouth, Devon to Liverpool, Lancashire, when she was caught in a gale off the coast of Anglesey. She was driven ashore and wrecked at Aberffraw.

<text>HMS &quot;Enterprise&quot; was one of two light cruisers built for the Royal Navy. She was built by John Brown &amp; Company, with the keel being laid down on 28 June 1918. She was launched on 23 December 1919, and commissioned on 7 April 1926. She was the 14th ship to serve with the Royal Navy to carry the name &quot;Enterprise&quot;, a name which is still used in the Royal Navy today.

&quot;Enterprise&quot; was completed with a prototype twin 6&quot; turret in place of the original design two forward single mounts; and with the trials proving successful it was retained for the rest of her service career. This turret was later worked into the design of the , &quot;Amphion&quot; and classes. The turret installation occupied less space than the superimposed &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;B&#x27; guns of &quot;Emerald&quot;, therefore the bridge was placed further forward. The bridge was of a new design, being a single block topped by a director tower, rather than the traditional platforms built around the foremast and wheelhouse topped with a spotting top. This design of bridge would appear in the s.

==Service history==

===Pre-war===
After several months in home waters, &quot;Enterprise&quot; served with the 4th Cruiser Squadron in the East Indies her first commission ending in December 1928. Her first commission was remarkable mostly for its culmination and the events that took place between 19 September and 10 December 1928 which are outlined under the history of the Enterprise Cup, a rugby union trophy that is still contested to this day in Kenya. &quot;Enterprise&quot; undertook several subsequent commissions on the East Indies Station, until she returned home and was reduced to care and maintenance on 4 July 1934, followed by a major refit. She returned to the East Indies in January 1936.

On the afternoon of 4 May 1936, &quot;Enterprise&quot; departed Djibouti in French Somaliland carrying the Emperor of Ethiopia, Haile Selassie – who had fled there as Italy completed its conquest of Ethiopia in the Second Italo-Ethiopian War – and transported him to Haifa in the British Mandate of Palestine, beginning his five-year period in exile in England at Fairfield House, Bath before he returned to Ethiopia in 1941.

The cruiser relieved &quot;Enterprise&quot; on the East Indies Station at the end of 1937, and &quot;Enterprise&quot; came home. In February 1938, she was tasked with transporting Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone and her husband The Earl of Athlone to Saudi Arabia - the first visit by a member of the British Royal Family. Later that year, she was employed to take crews to the China Station, returning home to pay off on 30 September 1938, when she was reduced to the Reserve Fleet.

===Second World War===
====Initial stages====
At the start of the Second World War in September 1939, &quot;Enterprise&quot; was recommissioned and joined Atlantic patrols with the 4th Cruiser Squadron. She later joined the North America and West Indies Squadron. &quot;Enterprise&quot; was employed on Atlantic escort duties with the Halifax Escort Force in 1939–1940. In October 1939, she oversaw the transfer of £10 million (£ in today&#x27;s currency) in gold bullion to Canada during Operation Fish.

In April 1940, she was transferred to the Home Fleet for the Norwegian Campaign. In April–May, she supported the British Army ashore by bombardments in and around Narvik, Norway, and on 19 April was attacked unsuccessfully by the . On 25 May, she left Harstad with a third of the Norwegian National Treasury bound for Britain. She sailed first to Scapa Flow, surviving two German air attacks on the way, then proceeded to Greenock, where the gold was taken ashore.

After some repairs, &quot;Enterprise&quot; joined the newly formed Force H in June 1940 and set sail for the Mediterranean Sea where, in July, she participated in negotiations with the French Navy regarding the future of the French fleet in the war. Following the unsatisfactory outcome of the negotiations, she participated in Operation Catapult at Mers-El-Kébir. She also participated in the delivery of aircraft to Malta in late July.

====Outside home waters====
Force H was then re-organised and &quot;Enterprise&quot; was sent to Cape Town after which she became the flagship for operations in South America, primarily involved in trade defence and interception duties. In December 1940, she was deployed with the cruisers and in an unsuccessful search for the German auxiliary cruiser which had attacked and damaged the armed merchant cruiser .

In early 1941, she was redeployed to the Indian Ocean where, accompanied by a sizeable fleet of Royal Navy and Royal Australian Navy ships led by the aircraft carrier , she participated in a search for the German cruiser . After the search was abandoned, &quot;Enterprise&quot; took up convoy escort duty before being sent to Basra after a pro-German revolt by Rashid Ali al-Gaylani started the Anglo-Iraqi War. The war was won by the end of May, after which &quot;Enterprise&quot; was released back into convoy escort duty in the Indian Ocean.
In November, she was under refit and repair in Colombo, which was finished just in time for the start of the War with Japan in December 1941. She escorted troop ships to Singapore and Rangoon, Burma, and then joined the Eastern Fleet under Admiral Sir James Somerville, taking part in protection of trade for the next year. On 6 April 1942, together with the destroyers and , she picked up some of the 1,120 survivors of the cruisers and , which had been sunk by the Japanese in their Easter Sunday Raid. The Easter Sunday Raid was part of the larger Japanese Indian Ocean raid, which threatened British Ceylon. &quot;Enterprise&quot; participated in yet another fruitless search for enemy ships during this period, when it was believed the Japanese were preparing to strike and possibly invade the Indian Ocean island.

====Home waters====
On 25 December 1942, she returned to Clyde for extensive refit and modernisation works, which were completed only in October 1943. Trials and tests continued throughout November.

In late December 1943, she was deployed with the cruisers and for Operation Stonewall.

On 28 December, she engaged a force of 11 German destroyers and torpedo boats, the tardy escort for their blockade runner &quot;Alsterufer&quot; (which had been sunk the previous day by air attack). &quot;Enterprise&quot; sank the torpedo boat with a torpedo, while and were also sunk. Four other German ships were damaged in the engagement.

From 3–29 February 1944, &quot;Enterprise&quot; was docked at Devonport for refit, and from 27–31 March she was fitted for missile jamming gear at Devonport.

====The invasion of Normandy====
In May, &quot;Enterprise&quot; was then assigned to Bombardment Force &quot;A&quot; with British ships , , , Netherlands ship , and US ships , , and . She was in sub-group Assault Force &quot;U&quot; (for Utah Beach), of which she was the lead ship.

When the Normandy Landings started on 6 June 1944, Bombardment Force &quot;A&quot; bombarded St. Martin de Varreville. &quot;Enterprise&quot; engaged the coastal defences of Cherbourg; in the ensuing action, her Captain and her Commander were both wounded, and the ship was brought back to Portland by the First Lieutenant, Lieutenant Commander Brown. Twenty days later, she was also involved in the bombardment of Querqueville, silencing the German guns there. German shore batteries opened fire, but caused no significant damage to &quot;Enterprise&quot;. During the D-day operations, &quot;Enterprise&quot; fired about 9,000 6-inch shells and required two overnight gun changes at Portsmouth.

In July, she was deployed off the French coast in support of British operations, and on 17 July, she provided naval gunfire for two days in support for British attacks near Caen with the cruiser and the monitor . In September, she was deployed in a similar capacity off the Dutch coast in support of the Second Army; however, she was not required to support the troops.

In October, after a contemplated transfer to the Royal Canadian Navy was not implemented, &quot;Enterprise&quot; was taken out of active service and placed in reserve at Rosyth.

===Post-war===
Starting in May 1945, &quot;Enterprise&quot; helped return British troops from Asia and Africa. On 13 January 1946, she returned to the United Kingdom for the final time. She was handed over to BISCO for scrapping on 11 April, arriving at J Cashmore in Newport, Wales, on 21 April for breaking-up.

==Armament refits==

Throughout her service, &quot;Enterprise&quot; was refitted with a slightly differing array of weaponry. Below is a table of the new armament after her first refit:

==Battle honours==
For her service in the Second World War, &quot;Enterprise&quot; was awarded four battle honours:
*Atlantic (1939–40)
*Norway (1940)
*Biscay (1943)
*Normandy (1944)

In addition, the ship inherited a battle honour from the fourth-rate ship of the line , which fought against Bourbon Spain in the Seven Years&#x27; War:
*Havana (1762)

<doc id="344944" wikidata="Q437001" url="?curid=344944" title="Ernest Augustus, Crown Prince of Hanover">
<text>Ernest Augustus, Crown Prince of Hanover, 3rd Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale (; 21 September 1845 – 14 November 1923), was the eldest child and only son of George V of Hanover and his wife, Marie of Saxe-Altenburg. Ernest Augustus was deprived of the throne of Hanover upon its annexation by Prussia in 1866 and later the Duchy of Brunswick in 1884. Ernest Augustus was deprived of his British peerages and honours for having sided with Germany in World War I.

==Early life==
Prince Ernest Augustus of Hanover, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, Prince of Great Britain and Ireland, was born at Hanover during the reign of his paternal grandfather, Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover. He became the crown prince of Hanover upon his father&#x27;s accession as George V in November 1851.

In 1866, William I of Prussia and his minister-president Otto von Bismarck deposed George V and annexed Hanover after George V sided with the defeated Austria in the 1866 Austro-Prussian War. During that war, the Crown Prince saw action at the Battle of Langensalza.

==Exile==
After the war, the exiled Hanoverian royal family took up residence in Hietzing, near Vienna, but spent a good deal of time in Paris. George V never abandoned his claim to the Hanoverian throne and maintained the Guelphic Legion at his own expense. The former Crown Prince travelled during this early period of exile, and ultimately accepted a commission in the Imperial and Royal Army of Austria-Hungary. The Guelph Party, or the German-Hanoverian Party, as a minor party in the legislature of the North German Federation and then the German Empire continued to protest the annexation of Hanover and advocated for the restoration of the state of Hanover with a Guelph at its head.

==Succession==
When King George V died in Paris on 12 June 1878, Prince Ernest Augustus succeeded him as Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale in the Peerage of Great Britain and Earl of Armagh in the Peerage of Ireland. Queen Victoria created him a Knight of the Garter on 20 July 1878. Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria appointed him to succeed his father as colonel and proprietor of the Austrian 42nd Regiment of Infantry. The regiment&#x27;s name was changed to honour him, and he served as its honorary colonel from 1879 to the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, in 1918.

==Marriage==

While visiting his second cousin Albert Edward, Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII) at Sandringham in 1875, he met Princess Thyra of Denmark (29 September 1853 – 26 February 1933), the youngest daughter of King Christian IX and a sister of the Princess of Wales (later Queen Alexandra).

On 21/22 December 1878, he and Princess Thyra married at Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen.

==Duchy of Brunswick==
Queen Victoria appointed the Duke of Cumberland a colonel in the British Army in 1876 and promoted him to major general in 1886, lieutenant general in 1892 and general in 1898. Although he was a British peer and a prince of Great Britain and Ireland, he continued to consider himself an exiled monarch of a German realm and refused to disclaim his succession rights to Hanover, making his home in Gmunden, Upper Austria.

The Duke of Cumberland was also first in the line of succession to the Duchy of Brunswick after his distant cousin, Duke William. In 1879, when it became apparent that the senior line of the House of Welf would die with William, the Brunswick parliament created a council of regency to take over administration of the duchy upon William&#x27;s death. This council would appoint a regent if the Duke of Cumberland could not ascend the throne. When William died in 1884, the Duke of Cumberland proclaimed himself Duke of Brunswick. However, since he still claimed to be the legitimate King of Hanover as well, the German Bundesrat declared that he would disturb the peace of the empire if he ascended the ducal throne. Under Prussian pressure, the council of regency ignored his claim and appointed Prince Albert of Prussia as regent.

Negotiations between Ernest Augustus and the German government continued for almost three decades, to no avail. During this time, Regent Albert died and Duke John Albert of Mecklenburg was appointed as regent.

==Reconciliation==
The Duke of Cumberland was partially reconciled with the Hohenzollern dynasty in 1913, when his surviving son, Prince Ernest Augustus, married the only daughter of Kaiser Wilhelm II, the grandson of the Prussian king who had deposed his father. On 24 October 1913, he renounced his succession rights to the Brunswick duchy (which had belonged to the Guelph dynasty since 1235) in favour of his son. The younger Ernest Augustus thus became the reigning Duke of Brunswick on 1 November 1913 and married the Kaiser&#x27;s daughter. As a mark of regard for his daughter&#x27;s father-in-law, Kaiser Wilhelm II created the elder Ernest Augustus a Knight of the Order of the Black Eagle.

In 1918, the younger Duke Ernest Augustus abdicated his throne along with the other German princes when all the German dynasties were disestablished by the successor German provisional Government which was established when the Emperor himself abdicated and fled Germany in exile to the Netherlands.

==War==
The outbreak of World War I created a breach between the British royal family and its Hanoverian cousins. On 13 May 1915, King George V ordered the removal of the Duke of Cumberland from the Roll of the Order of the Garter. According to the letters patent on 30 November 1917, he lost the status of a British prince and the style of Highness. Under the terms of the Titles Deprivation Act 1917, on 28 March 1919 his name was removed from the roll of Peers of Great Britain and of Ireland by Order of the King in Council for &quot;bearing arms against Great Britain.&quot;

==Later life==
Prince Ernest Augustus, the former Crown Prince of Hanover and former Duke of Cumberland, died of a stroke on his estate at Gmunden in November 1923. He is interred, next to his wife and his mother, in a mausoleum which he had built adjacent to Cumberland Castle.

==Issue==

The Duke and Duchess of Cumberland and Teviotdale had six children:

==Ancestry==

Patrilineal descent, descent from father to son, is the principle behind membership in royal houses, as it can be traced back through the generations - which means that the &quot;historically accurate&quot; royal house of monarchs of the House of Hanover was the House of Lucca (or Este, or Welf).

This is the descent of the primary male heir. For the complete expanded family tree, see List of members of the House of Hanover.

<text>The ninth HMS &quot;Enterprise&quot; (A 71) of the Royal Navy was an inshore survey ship built by M.W. Blackmore &amp; Sons of Bideford and commissioned in 1959.

With her sister ships and , &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s career was spent in hydrographic surveys of the seas, sandbanks, and coastlines of the East Coast and Eastern English Channel. She was well-known around the harbours of Eastern England, and showed the flag on many official visits to Belgian, Dutch, and German ports on the North Sea coast, and as far up the Rhine as Cologne. After the American television series &quot;Star Trek&quot; became popular, &quot;Enterprise&quot; inevitably became known throughout the Navy as &quot;the Starship.&quot; She was put up for disposal by sale in 1985. In 2023 she was scrapped in killkeel harbour after sinking in shallow water

<text>Kim Ji-won (; born 6 August 1959 in Seoul) is a former South Korean boxer who was an unbeaten world champion in the super bantamweight division. He is one of just fifteen world boxing champions to retire without a loss.

==Amateur career==
Kim began garnering attention in 1978 when he won the flyweight (-51 kg) gold medal at the Asian Junior Amateur Boxing Championships in Karachi, Pakistan.

In 1979, Kim won the gold medal in the flyweight division at the CISM Amateur Boxing Championships in Caracas, Venezuela, beating Oudahi Mohammad Amin of Algeria via first-round knockout in the final bout.

In February 1980, Kim participated in the Asian Amateur Boxing Championships held in Bombay, India. There he captured the gold medal in the flyweight division. In April 1980, Kim won the flyweight gold medal at the King&#x27;s Cup Boxing, beating future World Amateur Boxing Championship bronze medalist Constantin Titoiu of Romania in the final bout.

In 1981, Kim won the bantamweight gold medal at the King&#x27;s Cup Boxing, defeating future Commonwealth Games gold medalist Hussein Khalili of Kenya in the final.

==Pro career==
On 17 May 1983 the southpaw defeated Chun Chan-jung for the Korean super bantamweight title. Four months later he fought Little Bangoyan for the vacant Oriental and Pacific Boxing Federation (OPBF) title, capturing it with a twelve-round decision. For the next year Kim made five defenses of his OPBF title against the likes of Lito Cortez (KO 2), Rolando Navarro (PTS 12), and Fel Malatag (TKO 6).

On 3 January 1985, he fought countryman and reigning International Boxing Federation super bantamweight champion Suh Sung-in. Kim won via a tenth round stoppage. Kim would make four successful defenses of his title against future WBO featherweight champion Ruben Dario Palacios (W15, 30 March 1985), former IBF super bantamweight champions Bobby Berna (KO 4, 28 June 1985) and Suh Sung-in (KO 1, 9 October 1985), and Rudy Casicas (KO 2, 2 May 1986).

In December 1986, he retired from boxing in order to become a theatrical actor and singer, finishing with a record of 16 wins, no losses, and two draws, both draws coming from the same boxer. He would become one of the few world champions to retire undefeated.

==Personal life==
Kim has one sister, Ji-Sook, the Grand Bell Award winning actress, and one brother, Ji-Woon who is a world-acclaimed filmmaker.

<doc id="344948" wikidata="Q901147" url="?curid=344948" title="Partial charge">
<text>In atomic physics, a partial charge (or net atomic charge) is a non-integer charge value when measured in elementary charge units. It is represented by the Greek lowercase delta (𝛿), namely 𝛿− or 𝛿+.

Partial charges are created due to the asymmetric distribution of electrons in chemical bonds. For example, in a polar covalent bond like HCl, the shared electron oscillates between the bonded atoms. The resulting partial charges are a property only of zones within the distribution, and not the assemblage as a whole. For example, chemists often choose to look at a small space surrounding the nucleus of an atom: When an electrically neutral atom bonds chemically to another neutral atom that is more electronegative, its electrons are partially drawn away. This leaves the region about that atom&#x27;s nucleus with a partial positive charge, and it creates a partial negative charge on the atom to which it is bonded.
In such a situation, the distributed charges taken as a group always carries a whole number of elementary charge units. Yet one can point to zones within the assemblage where less than a full charge resides, such as the area around an atom&#x27;s nucleus. This is possible in part because particles are not like mathematical points—which must be either inside a zone or outside it—but are smeared out by the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics. Because of this smearing effect, if one defines a sufficiently small zone, a fundamental particle may be both partly inside and partly outside it.

==Uses==

Partial atomic charges are used in molecular mechanics force fields to compute the electrostatic interaction energy using Coulomb&#x27;s law, even though this leads to substantial failures for anisotropic charge distributions. Partial charges are also often used for a qualitative understanding of the structure and reactivity of molecules.

Occasionally, δδ+ is used to indicate a partial charge that is less positively charged than δ+ (likewise for δδ-) in cases where it is relevant to do so. This can be extended to δδδ+ to indicate even weaker partial charges as well. Generally, a single δ+ (or δ-) is sufficient for most discussions of partial charge in organic chemistry.

==Determining partial atomic charges==

Partial atomic charges can be used to quantify the degree of ionic versus covalent bonding of any compound across the periodic table. The necessity for such quantities arises, for example, in molecular simulations to compute bulk and surface properties in agreement with experiment. Evidence for chemically different compounds shows that available experimental data and chemical understanding lead to justified atomic charges. Atomic charges for a given compound can be derived in multiple ways, such as:
# extracted from electron densities measured using high resolution x-ray, gamma ray, or electron beam diffraction experiments
# measured dipole moments
# the Extended Born thermodynamic cycle, including an analysis of covalent and ionic bonding contributions
# spectroscopically measured properties, such as core-electron binding energy shifts
# the relationship of atomic charges to melting points, solubility, and cleavage energies for a set of similar compounds with similar degree of covalent bonding
# the relationship of atomic charges to chemical reactivity and reaction mechanisms for similar compounds reported in the literature.

The discussion of individual compounds in prior work has shown convergence in atomic charges, i.e., a high level of consistency between the assigned degree of polarity and the physical-chemical properties mentioned above. The resulting uncertainty in atomic charges is ±0.1e to ±0.2e for highly charged compounds, and often &lt;0.1e for compounds with atomic charges below ±1.0e. Often, the application of one or two of the above concepts already leads to very good values, especially taking into account a growing library of experimental benchmark compounds and compounds with tested force fields.

The published research literature on partial atomic charges varies in quality from extremely poor to extremely well-done. Although a large number of different methods for assigning partial atomic charges from quantum chemistry calculations have been proposed over many decades, the vast majority of proposed methods do not work well across a wide variety of material types. Only as recently as 2016 was a method for theoretically computing partial atomic charges developed that performs consistently well across an extremely wide variety of material types. All of the earlier methods had fundamental deficiencies that prevented them from assigning accurate partial atomic charges in many materials. Mulliken and Löwdin partial charges are physically unreasonable, because they do not have a mathematical limit as the basis set is improved towards completeness. Hirshfeld partial charges are usually too low in magnitude. Some methods for assigning partial atomic charges do not converge to a unique solution. In some materials, atoms in molecules analysis yields non-nuclear attractors describing electron density partitions that cannot be assigned to any atom in the material; in such cases, atoms in molecules analysis cannot assign partial atomic charges.

According to Cramer (2002), partial charge methods can be divided into four classes:

*&quot;Class I charges&quot; are those that are not determined from quantum mechanics, but from some intuitive or arbitrary approach. These approaches can be based on experimental data such as dipoles and electronegativities.
*&quot;Class II charges&quot; are derived from partitioning the molecular wave function using some arbitrary, orbital based scheme.
*&quot;Class III charges&quot; are based on a partitioning of a physical observable derived from the wave function, such as electron density.
*&quot;Class IV charges&quot; are derived from a semiempirical mapping of a precursor charge of type II or III to reproduce experimentally determined observables such as dipole moments.

The following is a detailed list of methods, partly based on Meister and Schwarz (1994).

* Population analysis of wavefunctions
** Mulliken population analysis

* Charges derived from dipole-dependent properties
** Dipole charges
** Dipole derivative charges, also called atomic polar tensor (APT) derived charges, or Born, Callen, or Szigeti effective charges 
* Charges derived from electrostatic potential

<text>Eliahu Inbal (born 16 February 1936, Jerusalem) is an Israeli conductor. Inbal has enjoyed a career of international renown, conducting leading orchestras around the world. He has conducted a wide variety of works. He is best known for his interpretations of late-Romantic works, but is also noted as an opera conductor, and has given the premieres of a number of modern works. 

Inbal is an officer of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (1990) in France and of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany (2006).

==Early life and education==
Inbal studied violin at the Israeli Academy of Music and took composition lessons with Paul Ben-Haim. Upon hearing him there, Leonard Bernstein endorsed a scholarship for Inbal to study conducting at the Conservatoire de Paris, and he also took courses with Sergiu Celibidache and Franco Ferrara in Hilversum, Netherlands. At Novara, he won first prize at the 1963 Guido Cantelli conducting competition at the age of 26. 

Inbal made most of his early appearances in Italy, but a successful British debut in 1965 with the London Philharmonic led to a number of other engagements with British orchestras. He subsequently worked with a number of orchestras throughout Europe and in America, and eventually took joint British citizenship.
==Conductor of the Frankfurt Radio Symphony==
From 1974 to 1990, he was the principal conductor of the Frankfurt Radio Symphony. With them, he was the first to record the original versions of several of Anton Bruckner&#x27;s symphonies, for which he won the &quot;Jahrespreis der deutschen Schallplatten-Kritik&quot;. He also has recorded two complete cycles each of the symphonies of Gustav Mahler and Dmitri Shostakovich. From 1984 to 1989, he was chief conductor at La Fenice in Venice. From 2003 to 2011, he conducted a series of the complete symphonies of Bruckner at the Rheingau Musik Festival with the WDR Symphony Orchestra Cologne, concluding with the unfinished Ninth Symphony. He was appointed music director of La Fenice in January, 2007.

==Chief Conductor of the Czech Philharmonic==
From 2009 to 2012, Inbal served as the chief conductor of the Czech Philharmonic. Inbal also served as the principal conductor of the Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra from 2008 to 2014, and currently is the Conductor Laureate of the orchestra.

==2014 and 2016==
In 2014, Inbal was named as Conductor Laureate of the Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra. In 2016, he was a guest conductor with the Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra. In 2017, he conducted at the Philharmonie de Paris.

==Chief conductor of the Taipei Symphony Orchestra==
In August 2019, Inbal began his tenure as the chief conductor of the Taipei Symphony Orchestra with a contract of three years. His contract was extended in April 2022, although he decided in June to leave the orchestra when his original term expired.

Following his retirement as chief conductor of the Taipei Symphony Orchestra, Inbal became Conductor Laureate of the Orchestra in 2023.

<text>Air Moldova was the flag carrier airline for The Republic of Moldova, headquartered in the country&#x27;s capital Chișinău. It mainly operated scheduled and charter services to destinations within Europe from its base at Chișinău International Airport. Air Moldova suspended all operations on 3 May 2023.

==History==
===The roots of Moldavian civil aviation===
The origin of Air Moldova can be traced to 19 September 1944, when the first unit of Po-2 transport aircraft arrived in Chișinău and the Moldavian Independent Squadron was established. Aside from fifteen aircraft Po-2 biplanes operating domestic flights and serving in the agricultural role, there were also two Li-2 aircraft, used on flights to Moscow, some Ukrainian cities and to Black Sea and Caucasus summer resorts.

In the 1960s, considerable steps were made in the development of the local Moldavian airline industry. A new airport in Chișinău able to accommodate gas turbine aircraft was opened early in the decade. The enterprise received status of Ministry of Civil Aviation in 1965 and new Antonov An-10, An-12 and An-24 aircraft expanded its fleet. Regular flights to many cities in the USSR were begun, and the transportation of fruits and vegetables grown in Moldova to the largest industrial centers of the USSR was established.

The beginning of the 1970s was marked by the appearance of jet aircraft on Moldova&#x27;s main air routes. The first Tupolev Tu-134 twin-jet airliner began service in Moldova in 1971 and became the main aircraft type of the enterprise, increasing in number until at one point 26 of them were in use. In Chișinău there was even an all-union test basis for aircraft of this type.

The fleet was further enlarged in 1972 with the Yakovlev Yak-42 tri-jet regional aircraft and in 1974 with the An-26 turboprop cargo aircraft. The route map kept expanding and the flow of traffic kept growing throughout the decade. In the middle of the 1980s, Moldavian operations received ten larger Tupolev Tu-154 tri-jet airliners, furthering the development of Moldavian aviation. At that time Moldavian aircraft flew to 73 cities in the USSR and carried over 1,000,000 passengers per year. In 1990 the first international route between Chișinău and Frankfurt was opened.

===Creation of Air Moldova===
The airline was created in 1993 on the basis of the local Aeroflot unit. Since the very start, the company&#x27;s efforts were targeted at integration to the international market and compliance with the modern standards and requirements to high-end airlines. Air Moldova joined the management team improvement program in 1999.

On 13 July 2004, Air Moldova became an International Air Transport Association member. Air Moldova had also passed the operation safety audit and received the IOSA operator certificate. In May 2006, Air Moldova implemented e-ticketing on all its flights. The Air Moldova air operators certificate permitted the transport of passengers, goods and mail as of July 2007.

In 2012, Air Moldova transported 506,000 passengers, which increased in 2013 to 527,000 passengers. Further expansion occurred in February 2015 as Air Moldova ceased three routes to Bucharest, Kyiv and Sochi, as the contract with Tandem Aero, which operated them on behalf of Air Moldova, was discontinued. All these factors lead to, Air Moldova transporting 1,000,000 passengers for the first time.

In October 2018, it was announced that the process of privatising Air Moldova had been completed successfully, with Civil Aviation Group (a joint venture between two Moldovan business men and the Romanian airline Blue Air) becoming its owner for the sum of 50 million MDL (2.56 million EUR). The new owners also bought the airline&#x27;s debts of 1.2 billion MDL (61 million EUR).

====Suspension of operations====
Air Moldova stated it would suspend all flight operations between 21 and 25 April 2023, citing ongoing financial issues. This also caused a dispute with the Moldovan aviation authorities which had mandated the airline restructure measures as well as an involved bank.

On 2 May 2023, Air Moldova announced the suspension of all operations due to financial constrains, planning restructuring measures and filing for creditor protection.

On 29 May 2023, The director and deputy director of the airline were summoned to court for exceeding their duties. Air Moldova&#x27;s A320 navigability certificate expired on 21 August 2023; Due to the expiration of Air Moldova&#x27;s air operator certificate, the airline&#x27;s service will remain suspended.

==Destinations==

Air Moldova operated flights to several European, Asian, and Middle Eastern metropolitan destinations from its base at Chișinău International Airport, as well as additional seasonal and charter flights to Greece, Montenegro, Spain, and Turkey.

===Codeshare agreements===
At the time of suspension, codeshare agreements were in operation with Air Moldova with the following airlines:
* flydubai
* Turkish Airlines
* Ukraine International Airlines
* Utair

==Fleet==
===Final fleet===
In May 2023, when operations were suspended, the fleet of Air Moldova consisted of the following aircraft:
===Former fleet===

The Air Moldova fleet previously included the following aircraft types:

===Fleet development===
The Tupolev Tu-134 operated the Moscow and Istanbul flights more often when the second Airbus left the fleet. In the past Air Moldova chartered a Cirrus Airlines Boeing 737-500, the Moldavian Airlines Fokker 100, a Bulgarian Air VIA A320, Jet Tran Air MD81/82s and a Khors Air MD82 as a replacement. The Yak-40 replaced the Embraer EMB-120 (e.g. to Prague or Vienna) when that aircraft was in maintenance. The two Yakovlev Yak-42s went back to Russia in late 2003 and 2004.

The first Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia was part of the fleet from 12 October 2001 until 28 September 2006 when it was transferred to Tandem Aero. The second Embraer 120RT flew between 23 April 2004 and 26 March 2005 for Air Moldova. The second Embraer EMB120 Brasilia was bought in 2006. In February 2015, Air Moldova phased out their remaining single Embraer EMB-120 which was operated on lease by Tandem Aero.

The last Tupolev Tu-154B (ER-85285) was destroyed on July 5, 2006.

In November 2006, 93.1 million Moldovan lei (about €6 million) were transferred from the 2006 state budget to Air Moldova. With another 9 million lei taken from a bank, one of the six Airbus A320 has been bought. The political opposition at that time had doubts about the transparency of this deal. In June 2007, Air Moldova gave back an Airbus A320 to the lessor after 38 months of service.

An McDonnell Douglas MD-82 (SX-BSQ) from SkyWings was leased for 5 months from 15 May until October 2007.

Embraer signed a firm order with Air Moldova for 2 one-class Embraer 190 regional jets. The contract included purchase rights for another aircraft. Delivery was on 10 May 2010. A third Embraer 190 (manufactured in 2009 and previously operated by Lufthansa and Borajet) joined the fleet in 2016. All have since left the fleet.

Air Moldova medium-term leased an Airbus A321, which previously operated for Small Planet Airlines in 2019. The A321 had been painted in the airline&#x27;s livery and was delivered to Chișinău on 10 May 2019. It was the second Airbus A321 in the fleet, the previous one was phased-out in 2017.

<text>Latvians () are a Baltic ethnic group and nation native to Latvia and the immediate geographical region, the Baltics. They are occasionally also referred to as Letts, especially in older bibliography. Latvians share a common Latvian language, culture, history and ancestry.

==History==
A Balto-Finnic-speaking tribe known as the Livs settled among the northern coast of modern day Latvia. The Germanic settlers derived their name for the natives from the term Liv. They referred to all the natives as &quot;Letts&quot; and the nation as &quot;Lettland&quot;, naming their colony Livonia or Livland.

The Latin form, &quot;Livonia&quot;, gradually referred to the whole territory of modern-day Latvia as well as southern Estonia, which had fallen under Germanic influence. Latvians and Lithuanians are the only surviving members of the Baltic branch of the Indo-European family.

==Culture==
===Influences===
Latvians share a common language and have a unique culture with traditions, holidays, customs and arts. The culture and religious traditions have been somewhat influenced by Germanic, Scandinavian, and Russian traditions. Latvians have an ancient culture that has been archaeologically dated back to 3000 BC. Latvians maintained a considerable connection and trade with their neighbors. The first indications of human inhabitants on the lands of modern Latvia date archaeologically to 9000 BC, suggesting that the first settlers were hunters that stayed almost immediately following the end of the last ice age. Colonizers from the south arrived quickly, driving many of the hunters northward as polar ice caps melted further, or east, into modern-day Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine. The Roman author Tacitus remarked upon the &quot;Aestii&quot; peoples, thought to be inhabitants of the modern Baltic lands, suggesting that they were abound with formidable, yet peaceful and hospitable people. The Latvian peoples remained relatively undisturbed until Papal intervention via the Germanic, Teutonic Order colonized Kurzeme (Courland in English, Kurland in German), beginning in the first half of the 13th century. Papal decrees ordered the Teutonic Order to spread the &quot;Word of the Lord&quot; and the Gospel of Christianity throughout &quot;uncivilized&quot;, &quot;Pagan lands&quot;. Though these attempts to Christianize the population failed, and the Teutonic Order eventually redeployed southward, to the region of what was once known as East Prussia.

===Religion===

Baltic ethnic religion was followed in Latvia before it was invaded by the Christian Teutonic Order (see: Latvian mythology). Latvians still celebrate traditional feasts (Jāņi). Dievturība is a modern revival of the ethnic religion of the Latvians before Christianization in the 13th century CE.

Most of the Christian Latvians claim to belong to the Evangelical Lutheran Church, but in Latgale and Alsunga Municipality the Roman Catholic Church is predominant, a small minority of Latvians belong to the Latvian Orthodox Church and other religious congregations. In the late 18th century, a small but vibrant Herrnhutist movement played a significant part in the development of Latvian literary culture before it was absorbed into the mainstream Lutheran denomination.

===Language===
Latvians&#x27; ancestral language, Latvian, has been recorded since at least the 16th century. It developed into a distinct language by the 9th century. It is part of a distinct linguistic branch of Indo-European languages: the Baltic languages.

Another notable language of Latvia is the nearly extinct Livonian language, a member of the Baltic-Finnic sub-branch of the Uralic language family, which enjoys protection by law. The Latgalian language (a dialect of Latvian) is also protected by Latvian law as a historical variation of the Latvian language.

==Genetics==
Paternal haplogroups R1a and N1a1-Tat are the two most frequent, reaching 39.9% each among ethnic Latvians. R1a is associated with spread of Indo-European languages. R1a of Latvians is predominantly M558, and compared to other populations like South Slavs and West Slavs, Latvians also have the highest concentration of M558 among R1a. N1a1-Tat mutation originated in Northeast Asia and had spread throughout the Urals into Europe, where it is currently most common among Finno-Ugric, Baltic and East Slavic peoples. Latvians and Lithuanians have a predominance of the L550 branch of N1a1-Tat.

N1c1a was present in 41.5%, R1a1a-M558 in 35.2% and I1 (M253) in 6.3% of the samples analyzed. In lower levels, 2.5% of I2b (M223) and 0.6% I2a (P37.2) – haplogroups historically associated with western hunter-gatherers – were found as well.

Genetically, Latvians cluster closest with neighboring Lithuanians and Estonians; to a lesser extent with Poles, Czechs, Scandinavians, Germans, and Belarusians.

<text>Moldavian Airlines was an airline with its head office on the property of Chişinău International Airport in Chişinău in Moldova. It operated scheduled international services from Chişinău to destinations in Romania and Italy. Its main base was Chişinău International Airport.

== History ==

Moldavian Airlines was established on 26 July 1994 and started operations on 19 August 1994. It was the first private airline in Moldova.

<text>Count Hubert James Marcel Taffin de Givenchy (; 20 February 1927 – 10 March 2018) was a French aristocrat and fashion designer who founded the luxury fashion and perfume house of Givenchy in 1952. He is famous for having designed much of the personal and professional wardrobe of Audrey Hepburn and clothing for Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy. He was named to the International Best Dressed List Hall of Fame in 1970.

==Early life==
Hubert James Taffin de Givenchy was born on 20 February 1927 in Beauvais, Oise, into a Protestant noble family. He was the younger son of Lucien Taffin de Givenchy, Marquis of Givenchy (1888–1930), and his wife, the former Béatrice (&quot;Sissi&quot;) Badin (1888–1976). The Taffin family was ennobled in 1713, at which time the head of the family became Marquis of Givenchy. His elder brother, Jean-Claude de Givenchy (1925–2009), inherited the family&#x27;s marquessate and eventually became the president of Parfums Givenchy. A third sibling, Beatrice, was born in 1928 but died shortly after birth.

After his father&#x27;s death from influenza in 1930, he was raised by his mother and maternal grandmother, Marguerite Dieterle Badin (1853–1940), the widow of Jules Badin (1843–1919), an artist who was the owner and director of the historic Gobelins Manufactory and Beauvais tapestry factories. Artistic professions ran in the extended Badin family. Givenchy&#x27;s maternal great-grandfather, Jules Dieterle, was a set designer who also created designs for the Beauvais factory, including a set of 13 designs for the Elysée Palace. One of his great-great-grandfathers designed sets for the Paris Opera.

He moved to Paris at the age of 17, and he studied at the École des Beaux-Arts.

==Career==

Givenchy&#x27;s first designs were done for Jacques Fath in 1945. Later he did designs for Robert Piguet and Lucien Lelong (1946) – working alongside the still-unknown Pierre Balmain and Christian Dior. From 1947 to 1951 he worked for the avantgarde designer Elsa Schiaparelli.
In 1952, he opened his own design house at the &quot;Plaine Monceau&quot; in Paris, concentrating on versatile separates in shirting cotton. Later, he named his first collection &quot;Bettina Graziani&quot; for Paris&#x27;s top model at the time, who had provided indispensable support and publicity for him. His style was marked by innovation, contrary to the more conservative designs by Dior. At 25, he was the youngest designer of the progressive Paris fashion scene. His first collections were characterized by the use of rather cheap fabrics for financial reasons, but they always piqued curiosity through their design.

Audrey Hepburn, later the most prominent proponent of Givenchy&#x27;s fashion, and Givenchy first met in 1953 during the shoot of &quot;Sabrina&quot;. He went on to design the black dress she wore in &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot;. He also developed his first perfume collection for her (L&#x27;Interdit and Le de Givenchy). Hepburn was the face of that fragrance. This was the first time a star was the face of a fragrance&#x27;s advertising campaign.

At that time, he met his idol, Cristóbal Balenciaga. Givenchy sought inspiration not only from the lofty settings of haute couture but also in such avant-garde environments as Limbo, the store in Manhattan&#x27;s East Village.

Givenchy&#x27;s notable clients also included Donna Marella Agnelli, Lauren Bacall, Ingrid Bergman, Countess Mona von Bismarck, Countess Cristiana Brandolini d&#x27;Adda, Sunny von Bülow, Renata Tebaldi, Maria Callas, Capucine, Marlene Dietrich, Daisy Fellowes, Greta Garbo, Gloria Guinness, Dolores Guinness, Aimee de Heeren, Jane Holzer, Grace Kelly, Princess Salimah Aga Khan, Rachel Lambert Mellon, Sophia Loren, Jeanne Moreau, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Empress Farah Pahlavi, Babe Paley, Lee Radziwill, Hope Portocarrero, Comtesse Jacqueline de Ribes, Nona Hendryx, Baroness Pauline de Rothschild, Frederica von Stade, Baroness Gaby Van Zuylen van Nijevelt, Diana Vreeland, Betsey Whitney, Baroness Sylvia de Waldner, the Duchess of Windsor, Haitian first lady Michèle Duvalier and Jayne Wrightsman.

During the 1950s and early 1960s, he was considered one of the top couturiers. He debuted his prêt-à-porter collection in 1954, at which time his designs were considered to be both comfortably wearable and well-shaped enough to have &quot;hanger appeal&quot;. In 1955, he gained acclaim with an easy-fitting sweater style, a sleek, open-sided pump, and diminutive millinery. His most prophetic 1955 contribution was the shift dress, which he would alter in 1957 to produce the fuller but tapering &quot;sack/sac dress,&quot; also called the chemise dress, soon copied by Christian Dior for his 1957 Fuseau/Spindle line. The same year, he felt confident enough with his stature to present his collections weeks after almost all other designers showed theirs, requiring a second trip to Paris for the press. He created the iconic &#x27;balloon coat&#x27; and the &#x27;baby doll&#x27; dress in 1958, making innovative contributions to the geometric seaming and experimental construction becoming prevalent at the time. His princess line of 1959 was also very influential. In 1969, a men&#x27;s line was created.

While his premiere collection in the early 1950s had consisted of separates, they had still conformed to the rather dressy norms of the day. In the second half of the 1960s and into the 1970s, with the rise of much more casual styles like miniskirts and jeans, a societal rejection of materialism, and the decline in importance of haute couture, Givenchy&#x27;s designs remained rather formal and dressy and he became much less influential, seen by some as a behind-the-times designer for wealthy women &quot;of a certain age.&quot; There were signs of this change in position as early as 1963, when he rejected the fashion world&#x27;s adoption of multiple heights of women&#x27;s boots, sticking instead to staid pumps, and attempted to reintroduce a fitted princess silhouette when waistless shift and trapeze shapes were the strongest trend. During the miniskirt era, his hems remained longer than most, only rising to micromini length in the early seventies, when short lengths had come to seem the conservative position. He also joined 1971&#x27;s brief vogue for hot pants and showed fabrics inspired by Mark Rothko.

With the return to dresses that accompanied 1974&#x27;s Big Look trend, he began to be taken a little more seriously again, and with the return to formality and conspicuous-consumption, hats-gloves-suits-and-big-shoulders glamour reintroduced for fall of 1978 and continuing into the 1980s, Givenchy entered the upper echelons of fashion&#x27;s status quo once again, joining designers like Valentino, Yves Saint Laurent, and Oscar de la Renta in showing shoulder-padded versions of the chemise dress, sharply tailored suits, grand entrance ballgowns, and cocktail dresses revived from the 1940s and 1950s. While no longer the innovator he was in the 1950s, his work was very popular and perfectly in line with the mood of the era&#x27;s wealthy. He even joined other cocktail-set designers in showing the occasional above-the-knee skirt, newly acceptable to him now that it was dressy-looking instead of 1960s-casual, a tendency that increased during the eighties.

From 1976 through 1987 in the US, the Lincoln division of Ford Motor Company offered a Givenchy Edition of its Continental Mark series (1976 to 1982) and Lincoln Continental (1982 to 1987) automobiles, beginning with the 1976 Continental Mark IV coupe, continuing with the 1977-79 Mark V coupe, and ending with the 1982 Lincoln Mark VI and the 1987 Lincoln Continental sedan.

The House of Givenchy was split in 1981; the perfume line went to Veuve Clicquot, and the fashion branch was acquired by LVMH in 1989. As of today, LVMH owns Parfums Givenchy as well.

In 1988, he organized a retrospective of his work at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills, California.

==Later life==

Givenchy retired from fashion design in 1995.

Givenchy resided at the Château du Jonchet, a listed historic castle in Romilly-sur-Aigre, Eure-et-Loir, near Paris. In his retirement, he focused on collecting 17th and 18th-century bronze and marble sculptures. In July 2010, he spoke at the Oxford Union. From 8 to 14 September 2014, during the Biennale des Antiquaires, he organized a private sale exhibition at Christie&#x27;s in Paris featuring, artwork by Jean-Baptiste-Claude Odiot, the Manufacture nationale de Sèvres, Jacques-Louis David, and Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson, etc.

In January 2007, the French Post Office issued postage stamps for Valentine&#x27;s Day designed by Givenchy. In October 2014, a retrospective exhibition featuring ninety-five of his designed pieces took place at the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum in Madrid, Spain.

His longtime partner was fashion designer Philippe Venet.

Hubert de Givenchy died in his sleep at the Renaissance chateau near Paris on Saturday 10 March 2018. He was 91 and was buried in Passy Cemetery in Paris.

<text>In law enforcement jargon, a suspect is a known person accused or suspected of committing a crime. Police and reporters in the United States often use the word suspect as a jargon when referring to the perpetrator of the offense (perp in dated U.S. slang). However, in official definition, the perpetrator is the robber, assailant, counterfeiter, etc.—the person who committed the crime. The distinction between suspect and perpetrator recognizes that the suspect is not &quot;known&quot; to have committed the offense, while the perpetrator—who may not yet have been suspected of the crime, and is thus not necessarily a suspect—is the one who did. The suspect may be a different person from the perpetrator, or there may have been no actual crime, which would mean there is no perpetrator.

A common error in police reports is a witness description of the suspect (as a witness generally describes a perpetrator, while a mug shot is of a suspect). Frequently it is stated that police are looking for the suspect, when there is no suspect; the police &quot;could&quot; be looking for a suspect, but they are surely looking for the perpetrator, and very often it is impossible to tell from such a police report whether there is a suspect or not.

Possibly because of the misuse of &quot;suspect&quot; to mean &quot;perpetrator&quot;, police in the late 20th and early 21st century began to use [[person of interest]], possible suspect, and even possible person of interest, to mean suspect.

Under the judicial systems of the U.S., once a decision is approved to arrest a suspect, or bind him over for trial, either by a prosecutor issuing an information, a grand jury issuing a true bill or indictment, or a judge issuing an arrest warrant, the suspect can then be properly called a defendant, or the accused. Only after being convicted is the suspect properly called the perpetrator.

<text>Charles Bradlaugh (; 26 September 1833 – 30 January 1891) was an English political activist and atheist. He founded the National Secular Society in 1866, 15 years after George Holyoake had coined the term &quot;secularism&quot; in 1851.

In 1880, Bradlaugh was elected as the Liberal MP for Northampton. His attempt to affirm as an atheist ultimately led to his temporary imprisonment, fines for voting in the House of Commons illegally, and a number of by-elections at which Bradlaugh regained his seat on each occasion. He was finally allowed to take an oath in 1886. Eventually, a parliamentary bill which he proposed became law in 1888, which allowed members of both Houses of Parliament to affirm, if they so wished, when being sworn in. The new law resolved the issue for witnesses in civil and criminal court cases.

==Early life==
Born in Hoxton (an area in the East End of London), Bradlaugh was the son of a solicitor&#x27;s clerk. He left school at the age of eleven and then worked as an office errand-boy and later as a clerk to a coal merchant. After a brief spell as a Sunday school teacher, he became disturbed by discrepancies between the Thirty-nine Articles of the Anglican Church and the Bible. When he expressed his concerns, the local vicar, John Graham Packer, accused him of atheism and suspended him from teaching. He was thrown out of the family home and was taken in by Eliza Sharples Carlile, the widow of Richard Carlile, who had been imprisoned for printing Thomas Paine&#x27;s &quot;The Age of Reason&quot;. Soon Bradlaugh was introduced to George Holyoake, who organised Bradlaugh&#x27;s first public lecture as an atheist.

At the age of 17, he published his first pamphlet, &quot;A Few Words on the Christian&#x27;s Creed&quot;. However, refusing financial support from fellow freethinkers, he enlisted as a soldier with the Seventh Dragoon Guards hoping to serve in India and make his fortune. Instead he was stationed in Dublin. In 1853, he was left a legacy by a great-aunt and used it to purchase his discharge from the army.

==Activism and journalism==

Bradlaugh returned to London in 1853 and took a post as a solicitor&#x27;s clerk. By this time he was a convinced freethinker and in his free time he became a pamphleteer and writer about &quot;secularist&quot; ideas, adopting the pseudonym &quot;Iconoclast&quot; to protect his employer&#x27;s reputation. He gradually attained prominence in a number of liberal or radical political groups or societies, including the Reform League, Land Law Reformers, and Secularists.

He was President of the London Secular Society from 1858. In 1860 he became editor of the secularist newspaper, the &quot;National Reformer&quot;, and in 1866 co-founded the National Secular Society, in which Annie Besant who joined in 1874 later became his close associate. In 1868, the &quot;Reformer&quot; was prosecuted by the British Government for blasphemy and sedition. Bradlaugh was eventually acquitted on all charges, but fierce controversy continued both in the courts and in the press.

A decade later (1877), Bradlaugh and Besant set up the Freethought Publishing Company and decided to republish the American Charles Knowlton&#x27;s pamphlet advocating birth control, &quot;The Fruits of Philosophy, or the Private Companion of Young Married People&quot;, whose previous British publisher, Charles Watts, had already been successfully prosecuted for obscenity. The two activists were both tried in 1877, and Charles Darwin refused to give evidence in their defence, pleading ill-health, but at the time writing to Bradlaugh that his testimony would have been of little use to them because he opposed birth control. They were sentenced to heavy fines and six months&#x27; imprisonment, but their conviction was overturned by the Court of Appeal on the basis that the prosecution had not set out the precise words which were alleged to be obscene in the indictment. The Malthusian League was founded as a result of the trial to promote birth control. He was a member of a Masonic lodge in Bolton, although he was later to resign due to the nomination of the Prince of Wales as Grand Master.

On 6 March 1881 he spoke at the opening of Leicester Secular Society&#x27;s new Secular Hall in Humberstone Gate, Leicester. The other speakers were George Jacob Holyoake, Annie Besant and Harriet Law.

Charles Bradlaugh challenged Hugh Price Hughes, a leading Methodist minister, to a debate on the merits of Christianity. Hughes accepted, on condition that each of them bring 100 individuals whose lives had been changed by their teaching. The debate was never held.

==Politics==
Bradlaugh was an advocate of trade unionism, republicanism, universal suffrage, but opposed socialism. His anti-socialism was divisive and many secularists who became socialists left the secularist movement because of its identification with Bradlaugh&#x27;s liberal individualism. He was a supporter of Irish Home Rule and backed France during the Franco-Prussian War. He took a strong interest in India.

==Parliament==

After defeats in 1868 and 1874, Bradlaugh was elected Member of Parliament for Northampton in 1880. To take his seat and become an active Parliamentarian, he needed to signify his allegiance to the Crown and on 3 May Bradlaugh came to the Table of the House of Commons, bearing a letter to the Speaker &quot;begging respectfully to claim to be allowed to affirm&quot; instead of taking the religious Oath of Allegiance, citing the Evidence Amendment Acts of 1869 and 1870. Speaker Brand declared that he had &quot;grave doubts&quot; and asked the House for its judgment. Lord Frederick Cavendish, for the Government, moved that a Select Committee be set up to decide whether persons entitled to make a solemn affirmation in court were also allowed to affirm instead of taking the Parliamentary oath.

===First Select Committee===
This Select Committee held only one brief meeting on 12 May 1880. The Attorney General, Sir Henry James, moved that anyone entitled to affirm to give evidence in court was also entitled to affirm instead of taking the Oath in Parliament. Sir John Holker, Conservative MP for Preston, moved an amendment to reverse this finding, and the committee split down the middle with eight members (seven Conservatives and Charles Henry Hopwood, Liberal MP for Stockport) supporting the amendment and eight (all Liberals) opposing it; on the casting vote of the chairman Spencer Horatio Walpole the amendment was carried. Bradlaugh was not surprised that the Committee had gone against him, and notified the Speaker that he would attend to take the Oath on 21 May.

===Attempts to take the Oath===
To explain his actions, Bradlaugh wrote an open letter to &quot;The Times&quot; which was published on the morning of 21 May. He said it would have been hypocritical to voluntarily take the oath &quot;including words of idle and meaningless character&quot; without protest when another form of words was available, but now that the Select Committee had ruled he must, he would do so and &quot;regard myself as bound not by the letter of its words, but by the spirit which the affirmation would have conveyed had I been permitted to use it.&quot;

Bradlaugh&#x27;s letter was regarded as a direct provocation by his opponents, and when he came to the table, Sir Henry Drummond Wolff rose to object to the administration of the Oath to Bradlaugh. Speaker Brand allowed him to object, and Wolff argued that the Evidence Amendment Acts referred to by Bradlaugh only allowed an affirmation to one who regarded the oath as meaningless, so the House should not allow Bradlaugh to take it. Prime Minister William Gladstone, alerted to the fact that a protest was possible, moved to set up a second Select Committee to examine whether it was possible to interfere with a Member wishing to take the oath. Gladstone&#x27;s amendment was carried by 289 to 214.

===Second Select Committee===

The Select Committee began deliberating on 1 June 1880, when it considered a paper put in by Sir Thomas Erskine May, the Clerk of the House. Sir Thomas found several precedents for Members disabled to sit for refusing to take the Oath, together with Quaker MP Joseph Pease who was permitted to affirm, and Jewish MPs Baron Lionel de Rothschild and David Salomons who were eventually allowed to take the Oath while omitting the words &quot;on the true faith of a Christian&quot;.

On the following day, Erskine May and Bradlaugh himself were questioned by the Committee, with Bradlaugh arguing that, should the Committee decide he had no right to affirm, he would take the oath and regard it as binding on his conscience. When the Committee decided its report, it agreed by one vote an amendment declaring that the House could &quot;and, in the opinion of your Committee, ought to&quot; prevent Bradlaugh from taking the Oath. It also added (by 12 votes to 9) that it would be possible for an action in the High Court of Justice to test whether an affirmation was lawful, and therefore recommended that if Bradlaugh sought to affirm, he should be allowed to do so in order that such an action be brought to clarify the law. The second Select Committee had effectively reversed the outcome of the first.

When it was known that this was the likely outcome of the Select Committee, Bradlaugh&#x27;s fellow Northampton MP Henry Labouchère initiated a debate on a motion to allow Bradlaugh to affirm. Sir Hardinge Giffard moved an amendment that Bradlaugh be not permitted to take either the Oath or make an affirmation. After two days of debate, Giffard&#x27;s amendment was carried by 275 to 230, a defeat which surprised Gladstone. The majority comprised 210 Conservatives, 34 Liberals and 31 Irish Home Rulers; supporting Bradlaugh were 218 Liberals, 10 Home Rulers and 2 Conservatives. On the next day, Bradlaugh came to the Table claiming to take the Oath; in consequence of the previous night&#x27;s vote the Speaker ordered him to withdraw.

Bradlaugh was permitted to address the House from behind the Bar (which was technically outside the Chamber), and treated the occasion as his maiden speech. He based his argument on law, contending that he was not legally disqualified, and asking &quot;as one man against six hundred&quot; for the same justice he would receive in the Courts. Although well received, the speech was too late to reverse the decision, and Henry Labouchère was forced to withdraw a motion to rescind it.

===Imprisonment===
At that point Bradlaugh was summoned back to the table to be told the outcome of the debate; having relayed it, the Speaker then ordered him to withdraw. Bradlaugh &quot;respectfully refused&quot; to obey an order of the House which was &quot;against the law&quot;. The Conservative leader Sir Stafford Northcote successfully moved a motion that Bradlaugh be required to withdraw (agreed on a division by 326 to 38, Liberal MPs being unwilling to challenge a motion which sustained the House&#x27;s legal authority) but Bradlaugh &quot;positively refused to obey&quot;. David Erskine, the Serjeant-at-arms, was sent for and led Bradlaugh out to the Bar of the House, but Bradlaugh then immediately returned to the table claiming to take the Oath. At this Sir Stafford Northcote moved that Bradlaugh be taken into custody. The House agreed, on a division by 274 votes to 7 and Bradlaugh was taken to the small prison cell located under Big Ben in the Clock Tower.

Lord Randolph Churchill roused the Conservatives by leading resistance to Bradlaugh.

Bradlaugh later returned to the House, but because Members had to take the oath before being allowed to take their seats, he effectively forfeited his seat in Parliament once he cast a vote in early 1881. His seat fell vacant and a by-election was declared. Bradlaugh was re-elected by Northampton four times in succession as the dispute continued. Supporting Bradlaugh were William Ewart Gladstone, T. P. O&#x27;Connor and George Bernard Shaw as well as hundreds of thousands of people who signed a public petition. Opposing his right to sit were the Conservative Party, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and other leading figures in the Church of England and Roman Catholic Church.

On at least one occasion, Bradlaugh was escorted from the House by police officers. In 1883 he took his seat and voted three times before being fined £1,500 for voting illegally. A bill allowing him to affirm was defeated in Parliament.

In 1886 Bradlaugh was finally allowed to take the oath, and did so at the risk of prosecution under the Parliamentary Oaths Act. Two years later, in 1888, he secured passage of a new Oaths Act, which enshrined into law the right of affirmation for members of both Houses, as well as extending and clarifying the law as it related to witnesses in civil and criminal trials (the Evidence Amendment Acts of 1869 and 1870 had proved unsatisfactory, though they had given relief to many who would otherwise have been disadvantaged). Bradlaugh spoke in Parliament about the London matchgirls strike of 1888.

==Personal life==
On 5 June 1855, at St Philip&#x27;s, Stepney, Bradlaugh married Susannah Lamb Hooper
(1831–1877), daughter of Abraham Hooper, a plasterer. Their daughter Alice was born in 1856. A second daughter, Hypatia Bradlaugh Bonner (1858–1935), was named after Hypatia, the Greek philosopher, mathematician, astronomer and teacher. In 1859 they had a son, Charles Bradlaugh, who died in July 1870, aged ten, some two months after his parents had separated.

A longstanding friendship between Bradlaugh and Elizabeth Holyoake (died 1865) led to rumours that Bradlaugh, not William Bottomley, Elizabeth&#x27;s husband, was the biological father of Horatio Bottomley (1860-1933)—a suggestion that Bottomley, in later life, was prone to encourage. The evidence is circumstantial, mainly based on the marked facial resemblance between Bradlaugh and Bottomley.

==Death==
Bradlaugh died on 30 January 1891. His funeral was attended by 3,000 mourners, including a 21-year-old Mohandas Gandhi. He is buried in Brookwood Cemetery in Surrey.
In 1898, Bradlaugh&#x27;s daughter Hypatia Bradlaugh Bonner wrote a pamphlet in answer to the question that was often addressed to her: whether her father &quot;changed his opinions and became a Christian&quot; before he died. Bonner laid out all the evidence and concluded that her father gave no indication that his opinions had changed in the &quot;smallest&quot; way.

==Commemoration==
A statue of Bradlaugh is located on a traffic island at Abington Square, Northampton. The statue points west towards the centre of Northampton, the accusing finger periodically missing due to vandalism. In 2014 the statue was cleaned and returned to the stonework. New signs are to be installed in 2015 on the roundabout reading &quot;Charles Bradlaugh MP&quot;.

Since 2002, an &quot;Annual Commemoration&quot; has taken place beneath the statue at 3 pm on the Sunday closest to his birthday, organised by the Charles Bradlaugh Society. Attendees are invited to speak about Charles Bradlaugh. 2014 saw the addition of the inaugural Bradlaugh Talk with speakers on issues relevant to Bradlaugh. The first speaker was Graham Smith, CEO of Republic.

Bradlaugh Fields, a community wildlife park situated to the north of Northampton, was named after Charles Bradlaugh when it opened in 1998. Other landmarks bearing his name include &quot;The Charles Bradlaugh&quot; pub, Charles Bradlaugh Hall at the University of Northampton, and Bradlaugh Hall in Lahore, Pakistan.

In November 2016 a portrait bust of Charles Bradlaugh was added to the Parliamentary Art Collection. Displayed in the Palace of Westminster, the sculpture was designed by Suzie Zamit (who is the fourth female sculptor to have work represented in the Parliamentary Art Collection) and was donated by the National Secular Society as part of its 150th anniversary celebrations.

<text>In mathematics and electronics engineering, a binary Golay code is a type of linear error-correcting code used in digital communications. The binary Golay code, along with the ternary Golay code, has a particularly deep and interesting connection to the theory of finite sporadic groups in mathematics. These codes are named in honor of Marcel J. E. Golay whose 1949 paper introducing them has been called, by E. R. Berlekamp, the &quot;best single published page&quot; in coding theory.

There are two closely related binary Golay codes. The extended binary Golay code, &quot;G&quot;24 (sometimes just called the &quot;Golay code&quot; in finite group theory) encodes 12 bits of data in a 24-bit word in such a way that any 3-bit errors can be corrected or any 4-bit errors can be detected. 
The other, the perfect binary Golay code, &quot;G&quot;23, has codewords of length 23 and is obtained from the extended binary Golay code by deleting one coordinate position (conversely, the extended binary Golay code is obtained from the perfect binary Golay code by adding a parity bit). In standard coding notation, the codes have parameters [24, 12, 8] and [23, 12, 7], corresponding to the length of the codewords, the dimension of the code, and the minimum Hamming distance between two codewords, respectively.

== Mathematical definition ==
In mathematical terms, the extended binary Golay code &quot;G&quot;24 consists of a 12-dimensional linear subspace &quot;W&quot; of the space of 24-bit words such that any two distinct elements of &quot;W&quot; differ in at least 8 coordinates. &quot;W&quot; is called a linear code because it is a vector space. In all, &quot;W&quot; comprises elements.
* The elements of &quot;W&quot; are called &quot;code words&quot;. They can also be described as subsets of a set of 24 elements, where addition is defined as taking the symmetric difference of the subsets.
* In the extended binary Golay code, all code words have Hamming weights of 0, 8, 12, 16, or 24. Code words of weight 8 are called octads and code words of weight 12 are called dodecads.
* Octads of the code &quot;G&quot;24 are elements of the S(5,8,24) Steiner system. There are octads and 759 complements thereof. It follows that there are dodecads.
* Two octads intersect (have 1&#x27;s in common) in 0, 2, or 4 coordinates in the binary vector representation (these are the possible intersection sizes in the subset representation). An octad and a dodecad intersect at 2, 4, or 6 coordinates.
* Up to relabeling coordinates, &quot;W&quot; is unique.

The binary Golay code, &quot;G&quot;23 is a perfect code. That is, the spheres of radius three around code words form a partition of the vector space. &quot;G&quot;23 is a 12-dimensional subspace of the space F.

The automorphism group of the perfect binary Golay code &quot;G&quot;23 (meaning the subgroup of the group &quot;S23&quot; of permutations of the coordinates of F which leave &quot;G&quot;23 invariant), is the Mathieu group formula_1. The automorphism group of the extended binary Golay code is the Mathieu group formula_2, of order . formula_2 is transitive on octads and on dodecads. The other Mathieu groups occur as stabilizers of one or several elements of &quot;W&quot;.

There is a single word of weight 24, which is a 1-dimensional invariant subspace. formula_2 therefore has an 11-dimensional irreducible representation on the field with 2 elements. In addition, since the binary golay code is a 12-dimensional subspace of a 24-dimensional space, formula_2 also acts on the 12-dimensional quotient space, called the &quot;binary Golay cocode&quot;. A word in the cocode is in the same coset as a word of length 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. In the last case, 6 (disjoint) cocode words all lie in the same coset. There is an 11-dimensional invariant subspace, consisting of cocode words with odd weight, which gives formula_2 a second 11-dimensional representation on the field with 2 elements.

== Constructions ==
* Lexicographic code: Order the vectors in &quot;V&quot; lexicographically (i.e., interpret them as unsigned 24-bit binary integers and take the usual ordering). Starting with &quot;w&quot;0 = 0, define &quot;w&quot;1, &quot;w&quot;2, ..., &quot;w&quot;12 by the rule that &quot;w&quot;&quot;n&quot; is the smallest integer which differs from all linear combinations of previous elements in at least eight coordinates. Then &quot;W&quot; can be defined as the span of &quot;w&quot;1, ..., &quot;w&quot;12.
* Mathieu group: Witt in 1938 published a construction of the largest Mathieu group that can be used to construct the extended binary Golay code.
* Quadratic residue code: Consider the set &quot;N&quot; of quadratic non-residues (mod 23). This is an 11-element subset of the cyclic group Z/23Z. Consider the translates &quot;t&quot;+&quot;N&quot; of this subset. Augment each translate to a 12-element set &quot;S&quot;&quot;t&quot; by adding an element ∞. Then labeling the basis elements of &quot;V&quot; by 0, 1, 2, ..., 22, ∞, &quot;W&quot; can be defined as the span of the words &quot;S&quot;&quot;t&quot; together with the word consisting of all basis vectors. (The perfect code is obtained by leaving out ∞.)
* As a cyclic code: The perfect G23 code can be constructed via the factorization of formula_7 over the binary field GF(2): formula_8 It is the code generated by formula_9. Either of degree 11 irreducible factors can be used to generate the code.
* Turyn&#x27;s construction of 1967, &quot;A Simple Construction of the Binary Golay Code,&quot; that starts from the Hamming code of length 8 and does not use the quadratic residues mod 23.
* From the Steiner System S(5,8,24), consisting of 759 subsets of a 24-set. If one interprets the support of each subset as a 0-1-codeword of length 24 (with Hamming-weight 8), these are the &quot;octads&quot; in the binary Golay code. The entire Golay code can be obtained by repeatedly taking the symmetric differences of subsets, i.e. binary addition. An easier way to write down the Steiner system resp. the octads is the Miracle Octad Generator of R. T. Curtis, that uses a particular 1:1-correspondence between the 35 partitions of an 8-set into two 4-sets and the 35 partitions of the finite vector space formula_10 into 4 planes. Nowadays often the compact approach of Conway&#x27;s hexacode, that uses a 4×6 array of square cells, is used. 
* Winning positions in the mathematical game of Mogul: a position in Mogul is a row of 24 coins. Each turn consists of flipping from one to seven coins such that the leftmost of the flipped coins goes from head to tail. The losing positions are those with no legal move. If heads are interpreted as 1 and tails as 0 then moving to a codeword from the extended binary Golay code guarantees it will be possible to force a win.
* A generator matrix for the binary Golay code is I A, where I is the 12×12 identity matrix, and A is the complement of the adjacency matrix of the icosahedron.

===A convenient representation===
It is convenient to use the &quot;Miracle Octad Generator&quot; format, with coordinates in an array of 4 rows, 6 columns. Addition is taking the symmetric difference. All 6 columns have the same parity, which equals that of the top row.

A partition of the 6 columns into 3 pairs of adjacent ones constitutes a trio. This is a partition into 3 octad sets. A subgroup, the projective special linear group PSL(2,7) x S3 of a trio subgroup of M24 is useful for generating a basis. PSL(2,7) permutes the octads internally, in parallel. S3 permutes the 3 octads bodily.

The basis begins with octad T:
 0 1 1 1 1 1
 1 0 0 0 0 0
 1 0 0 0 0 0
 1 0 0 0 0 0

and 5 similar octads. The sum N of all 6 of these code words consists of all 1&#x27;s. Adding N to a code word produces its complement.

Griess (p. 59) uses the labeling:
 ∞ 0 | ∞ 0 | ∞ 0
 3 2 | 3 2 | 3 2
 5 1 | 5 1 | 5 1
 6 4 | 6 4 | 6 4

PSL(2,7) is naturally the linear fractional group generated by (0123456) and (0∞)(16)(23)(45). The 7-cycle acts on T to give a subspace including also the basis elements
 0 1 1 0 1 0 
 0 0 0 0 0 0
 0 1 0 1 0 1
 1 1 0 0 0 0

and
 0 1 1 0 1 0
 0 1 0 1 0 1
 1 1 0 0 0 0
 0 0 0 0 0 0

The resulting 7-dimensional subspace has a 3-dimensional quotient space upon ignoring the latter 2 octads.

There are 4 other code words of similar structure that complete the basis of 12 code words for this representation of W.

W has a subspace of dimension 4, symmetric under PSL(2,7) x S3, spanned by N and 3 dodecads formed of subsets {0,3,5,6}, {0,1,4,6}, and {0,1,2,5}.

== Practical applications of Golay codes ==
=== NASA deep space missions ===
Error correction was vital to data transmission in the Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft particularly because memory constraints dictated offloading data virtually instantly leaving no second chances. Hundreds of color pictures of Jupiter and Saturn in their 1979, 1980, and 1981 fly-bys would be transmitted within a constrained telecommunications bandwidth. Color image transmission required three times as much data as black and white images, so the 7-error correcting Reed–Muller code that had been used to transmit the black and white Mariner images was replaced with the much higher data rate Golay (24,12,8) code.

=== Radio communications ===
The MIL-STD-188 American military standards for automatic link establishment in high frequency radio systems specify the use of an extended (24,12) Golay code for forward error correction.

In two-way radio communication digital-coded squelch (DCS, CDCSS) system uses 23-bit Golay (23,12) code word which has the ability to detect and correct errors of 3 or fewer bits.

<doc id="344974" wikidata="Q332410" url="?curid=344974" title="Chemosynthesis">
<text>In biochemistry, chemosynthesis is the biological conversion of one or more carbon-containing molecules (usually carbon dioxide or methane) and nutrients into organic matter using the oxidation of inorganic compounds (e.g., hydrogen gas, hydrogen sulfide) or ferrous ions as a source of energy, rather than sunlight, as in photosynthesis. Chemoautotrophs, organisms that obtain carbon from carbon dioxide through chemosynthesis, are phylogenetically diverse. Groups that include conspicuous or biogeochemically important taxa include the sulfur-oxidizing Gammaproteobacteria, the Campylobacterota, the Aquificota, the methanogenic archaea, and the neutrophilic iron-oxidizing bacteria.

Many microorganisms in dark regions of the oceans use chemosynthesis to produce biomass from single-carbon molecules. Two categories can be distinguished. In the rare sites where hydrogen molecules (H2) are available, the energy available from the reaction between CO2 and H2 (leading to production of methane, CH4) can be large enough to drive the production of biomass. Alternatively, in most oceanic environments, energy for chemosynthesis derives from reactions in which substances such as hydrogen sulfide or ammonia are oxidized. This may occur with or without the presence of oxygen.

Many chemosynthetic microorganisms are consumed by other organisms in the ocean, and symbiotic associations between chemosynthesizers and respiring heterotrophs are quite common. Large populations of animals can be supported by chemosynthetic secondary production at hydrothermal vents, methane clathrates, cold seeps, whale falls, and isolated cave water.

It has been hypothesized that anaerobic chemosynthesis may support life below the surface of Mars, Jupiter&#x27;s moon Europa, and other planets. Chemosynthesis may have also been the first type of metabolism that evolved on Earth, leading the way for cellular respiration and photosynthesis to develop later.

==Hydrogen sulfide chemosynthesis process==

Giant tube worms use bacteria in their trophosome to fix carbon dioxide (using hydrogen sulfide as their energy source) and produce sugars and amino acids.
Some reactions produce sulfur:
:hydrogen sulfide chemosynthesis:
::18H2S + 6CO2 + 3O2 → C6H12O6 (carbohydrate) + 12H2O + 18S

Instead of releasing oxygen gas while fixing carbon dioxide as in photosynthesis, hydrogen sulfide chemosynthesis produces solid globules of sulfur in the process. In bacteria capable of chemoautotrophy (a form of chemosynthesis), such as purple sulfur bacteria, yellow globules of sulfur are present and visible in the cytoplasm.

==Discovery==

In 1890, Sergei Winogradsky proposed a novel type of life process called &quot;anorgoxydant&quot;. His discovery suggested that some microbes could live solely on inorganic matter and emerged during his physiological research in the 1880s in Strasbourg and Zürich on sulfur, iron, and nitrogen bacteria.

In 1897, Wilhelm Pfeffer coined the term &quot;chemosynthesis&quot; for the energy production by oxidation of inorganic substances, in association with autotrophic carbon dioxide assimilation—what would be named today as chemolithoautotrophy. Later, the term would be expanded to include also chemoorganoautotrophs, which are organisms that use organic energy substrates in order to assimilate carbon dioxide. Thus, chemosynthesis can be seen as a synonym of chemoautotrophy.

The term &quot;chemotrophy&quot;, less restrictive, was introduced in the 1940s by André Lwoff for the production of energy by the oxidation of electron donors, organic or not, associated with auto- or heterotrophy.

===Hydrothermal vents===


Winogradsky&#x27;s suggestion was confirmed nearly 90 years later, when hydrothermal ocean vents were discovered in the 1970s. The hot springs and strange creatures were discovered by &quot;Alvin&quot;, the world&#x27;s first deep-sea submersible, in 1977 at the Galapagos Rift. At about the same time, then-graduate student Colleen Cavanaugh proposed chemosynthetic bacteria that oxidize sulfides or elemental sulfur as a mechanism by which tube worms could survive near hydrothermal vents. Cavanaugh later managed to confirm that this was indeed the method by which the worms could thrive, and is generally credited with the discovery of chemosynthesis.

A 2004 television series hosted by Bill Nye named chemosynthesis as one of the 100 greatest scientific discoveries of all time.

===Oceanic crust===
In 2013, researchers reported their discovery of bacteria living in the rock of the oceanic crust below the thick layers of sediment, and apart from the hydrothermal vents that form along the edges of the tectonic plates. Preliminary findings are that these bacteria subsist on the hydrogen produced by chemical reduction of olivine by seawater circulating in the small veins that permeate the basalt that comprises oceanic crust. The bacteria synthesize methane by combining hydrogen and carbon dioxide.

=== Chemosynthesis as an innovative area for continuing research ===
Despite the fact that the process of chemosynthesis has been known for more than a hundred years, its significance and importance are still relevant today in the transformation of chemical elements in biogeochemical cycles. Today, the vital processes of nitrifying bacteria, which lead to the oxidation of ammonia to nitric acid, require scientific substantiation and additional research. The ability of bacteria to convert inorganic substances into organic ones suggests that chemosynthetics can accumulate valuable resources for human needs.

Chemosynthetic communities in different environments are important biological systems in terms of their ecology, evolution and biogeography, as well as their potential as indicators of the availability of permanent hydrocarbon- based energy sources. In the process of chemosynthesis, bacteria produce organic matter where photosynthesis is impossible. Isolation of thermophilic sulfate-reducing bacteria &quot;Thermodesulfovibrio yellowstonii&quot; and other types of chemosynthetics provides prospects for further research. Thus, the importance of chemosynthesis remains relevant for use in innovative technologies, conservation of ecosystems, human life in general. Sergey Winogradsky helped discover the phenomenon of chemosynthesis.

<doc id="344976" wikidata="Q1520005" url="?curid=344976" title="Little Barford">
<text>Little Barford is a hamlet and civil parish in the Borough of Bedford in Bedfordshire, England about northeast of the county town of Bedford.

The 2011 census combines other data for Little Barford with Wyboston, Chawston and Colesden civil parish but its population is separately shown as 44.

Little Barford Power Station is in the north of the village.

==History==

The manor of Barford was held by the de Leyham family from about 1194, and then passed by inheritance into the de la Dale family in about 1316: the de la Dales owned Barford for two centuries, after which it passed by inheritance to the Fettiplace family, and subsequently to the Brownes.

A deserted medieval settlement in fields near to St Deny&#x27;s Church is visible as earthworks on historic aerial photographs.

The parish church is dedicated to Saint Denys. The church became redundant in 1972 and is now in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust.

A school was built in 1872. It became a council school in 1914 and closed in 1932, but reopened from 1939 to 1945. The building still stands.

The coal fired Little Barford Power Station was opened in 1939, closed in 1981 and demolished in 1989. A new gas fired plant was built in 1994–96.

==Geography==
Little Barford is south of St Neots, west of Cambridge and north of Central London.

The East Coast Mainline railway runs north–south through the parish.

===Area===
The civil parish covers an area of about .

The parish&#x27;s northern boundary is the A428 road, Cambridgeshire is to the east and Central Bedfordshire to the south. The River Great Ouse forms its western boundary.

===Landscape===
The hamlet lies within the Bedfordshire and Cambridgeshire Claylands as designated by Natural England. Bedford Borough Council classifies the local landscape as the Great Ouse Clay Valley around and west of the village, and the eastern part of the parish as within the Biggin Wood Clay Vale that extends northwards from Central Bedfordshire. The surrounding area is mostly arable farmland. The northernmost part of the parish between the railway and the Great Ouse is taken up by the power station and industrial units.

===Cottages===

A row of four Grade II listed 18th century rough cast, thatched cottages stand by the roadside. One is detached, the remainder are terraced. At the northern end of the hamlet are four pairs of late 19th century semi-detached estate cottages having yellow brickwork with red brick dressings.

===Elevation===
The hamlet is above sea level. The whole parish is mainly low lying and flat, although the land does rise to in the southeast corner of the parish.

===Geology and soil type===
The hamlet lies mainly on first and second terrace river gravel and glacial gravel. Boulder clay is to the east. Alluvium borders the Great Ouse. Underlying these superficial deposits and also in part at the surface is Oxford clay and Kellaways beds.

Around the hamlet the soil has low fertility, is freely draining and slightly acid with a loamy texture. The eastern part of the parish has highly fertile, lime-rich loamy and clayey soils with impeded drainage. By the Great Ouse are loamy and clayey floodplain soils with naturally high groundwater.

===Night sky and light pollution===
Light pollution is the level of radiance (night lights) shining up into the night sky. The Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) divides the level of night sky brightness into 9 bands with band 1 being the darkest i.e. with the lowest level of light pollution and band 9 the brightest and most polluted. Little Barford in bands 6 and 7 is adversely affected by lighting at the power station and Arlington Road Industrial Estate. The night sky is darker looking southeast.

===Public footpaths===
The sole public footpath runs from opposite the last cottage at the northern end of the hamlet to the Ouse and onwards to link with the Ouse Valley Way.

==Businesses==
The Alington Road estate has an office centre, units for a number of service companies, and a Marshall Motor Group dealership. Laing O&#x27;Rourke has premises on Barford Road including land for storing cranes. Waste disposal company Biffa also has a depot.

==Notable residents==
*Thomas de la Dale, Lord Chief Justice of Ireland — born in Little Barford in about 1317
*Nicholas Rowe — dramatic poet, born in &quot;Rowe&#x27;s Cottage&quot; in 1674
*Artist Mike Chaplin — known to many as resident art expert on Watercolour Challenge was born in Little Barford in 1943

<text>Swingers is a 1996 American buddy comedy film about the lives of single, unemployed actors living on the &#x27;eastside&#x27; of Hollywood, California, during the 1990s swing revival. Written by Jon Favreau and directed by Doug Liman, the film starred Favreau alongside Vince Vaughn, Ron Livingston, Patrick Van Horn, Alex Désert, and Heather Graham.

A critical and commercial hit, the film helped propel Favreau, Vaughn, Graham, and Livingston to stardom, while also launching Liman&#x27;s directing career as he won the award for Best New Filmmaker at the 1997 MTV Movie Awards.

This film was rated #58 on Bravo&#x27;s &quot;100 Funniest Movies&quot;. The film was honored on the 2007 Spike TV Guys&#x27; Choice Awards. In 2011, &quot;Empire&quot; magazine listed the film as #49 on its &quot;50 Greatest American Independent Films&quot; list.

==Plot==

Mike Peters is a struggling comedian who left New York to find success in Los Angeles and is still upset over his girlfriend of six years, Michelle, breaking up with him six months prior. To help Mike with his depression, his womanizing friend Trent and some other aspiring actor friends try to get him back into the social scene.

The movie opens with Mike telling his friend Rob about how desperately he misses Michelle and that she has not called him. Rob explains that &quot;somehow&quot; women &quot;know&quot; not to call their ex-boyfriends until they have completely moved on from them.

To help Mike recover, Trent coaxes him into an impromptu trip to Las Vegas. Trent succeeds in picking up two waitresses, but Mike&#x27;s obsession with Michelle ruins Trent&#x27;s plans. The women seem interested, but Mike spoils the mood, telling his date about her.

Back in Los Angeles, Mike, Rob and other friends golf, play video games, and go out. All of them are trying to make it in the entertainment industry. Then they go bar hopping, stopping at a party, and later an after-hours spot, where Trent demonstrates his prowess in handling the opposite sex. Inspired by this, Mike meets a woman named Nikki and gets her phone number. His friends insist he wait two days minimum before calling. In the parking lot, some thugs accost Sue who retaliates by drawing a gun, scaring the thugs and his friends. Sue upsets Mike ridiculing his unhealthy obsession with his ex prompting Mike to reconsider his behaviour and try to move on.

Back at his apartment, however, he leaves a series of increasingly desperate messages on Nikki&#x27;s answering machine in the middle of the night, before she firmly states that he must never call her again. Missing Michelle more than ever, he contemplates moving back to New York until Rob comes over and consoles him.

Out again for swing night at The Derby, Mike spots a woman named Lorraine. He summons all his courage to approach and connect with her. They both recently broke off relationships and moved to LA, and dance well together.

The following morning, Mike receives a call from Michelle, and finds that he no longer misses her. When Lorraine calls him, Mike cuts off his call with Michelle mid-sentence while she is saying she loves him, to further things with Lorraine. Like him, Lorraine had disregarded friends&#x27; advice to wait days before calling.

The next day, the buddies meet at a coffee shop. Trent makes a fool of himself over a pretty redhead in a case of mistaken identity. Mike smirks, knowing that his life is moving forward while Trent is stuck in the past.

==Production==
===Development===
Favreau wrote the screenplay for &quot;Swingers&quot; in about two weeks. His father had given him a screenwriting program on a computer and he wanted to see if he could make a screenplay &quot;just as an exercise&quot;. He had moved from Chicago and had also broken up with his girlfriend there, but the stories and events he wrote in were fictional. He had characters that he loosely based on friends, and used fellow actors for the key parts. He had become friends with Vaughn from the 1993 film &quot;Rudy&quot;, a movie they had acted in together. He had known Livingston from Chicago and their work at ImprovOlympic, and that they moved to Los Angeles around the same time.

During the time Favreau was trying to raise production money, some of the producers wanted to change the character of Trent to a woman, to not go to Vegas, and to make it darker and more violent. Others wanted to cast more notable actors like Johnny Depp or Chris O&#x27;Donnell, but Favreau declined those ideas. Favreau and his friends gave reader&#x27;s theater performances of the script to drum up interest in and capital for the movie. Nicole LaLoggia, who knew of Favreau when the latter read for the film &quot;Getting In&quot;, agreed to work on the film. Her roommate, Doug Liman, secured production money from his father&#x27;s business associate on the condition that Liman direct the film.

The title of the film was partly inspired by the Swingers Diner on Beverly Boulevard, a coffee shop that Liman and Favreau frequented. The &quot;you&#x27;re so money&quot; catchphrase that the film popularized originated from a television commercial with Spike Lee and Michael Jordan in which Lee called Jordan &quot;money&quot;. The phone call answering machine scene originated from a comedy bit by Jeff Garlin.

===Filming===
With the small budget, Favreau agreed to cast himself in the movie. Liman planned to shoot about 18 days with about 12 pages per day. They auditioned and cast Vaughn after considering some other bigger names. Many of the supporting and minor roles were filled from casual auditions and from cast and crew acquaintances. More money was spent on music licensing than for the film itself. Much of the film was shot using short ends, which meant many of the scenes could be filmed for about 60 seconds.

Mikey&#x27;s apartment is located in the Franklin Village area of Los Angeles, a few miles from the Dresden Room. It was Favreau&#x27;s real-life apartment at the time. Favreau also used his 1964 Mercury Comet Caliente convertible, which he had bought after his previous car had been stolen and stripped.

&quot;Swingers&quot; was filmed on location at several Los Angeles nightclubs, particularly in the hip Los Feliz neighborhood, including the Dresden Lounge and the Derby. Some of the shots were filmed documentary style with actual bar patrons as the crew could not afford to rent the places outright or hire a number of extras. The additional lighting was kept to a minimum as whenever the lights were brightened, the guests would scatter. The house party scene was filmed at the producers&#x27; friends&#x27; residences under the guise of a real house party.

The Las Vegas scenes were filmed primarily in two locations, with the exterior casino shots taking place at the Stardust Resort &amp; Casino and all the subsequent interior shots being filmed at the Fremont Hotel and Casino, farther north in downtown Las Vegas.

===Notable locations===
The Dresden Room is a popular classic bar and club in the Los Feliz neighborhood, located at 1760 N. Vermont Ave. The music duo Marty and Elayne have been performing at the Dresden in real life several nights a week for over 35 years. Vaughn was a frequent visitor.

The cafe where various factions of the crew meet and eat was the Hollywood Hills Coffee Shop (now the 101 Coffee Shop) a few blocks from the Franklin Village apartments. According to Liman, the shop let the cast and crew film for only one night while under renovation. The scene involving peekaboo with the baby originated from Vaughn&#x27;s experience with a similar person at an airport. It was added as an epilogue scene for the film, which would have ended with Favreau&#x27;s character finishing the phone calls with the two women. The 101 Coffee Shop ultimately closed its doors for good in January 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The bar where the characters dance is The Derby in Los Feliz, on the corner of Hillhurst and Los Feliz Boulevard, a club inspired by the original 1920s&#x27; Brown Derby Club on the same spot. Favreau had frequented there while he was raising money for the film, and even took swing dancing lessons. Big Bad Voodoo Daddy was a regular act there, so Favreau became friends with the band. The filming took place during one of their regular performances along with the swing dancers. In January 2009, the nightclub closed permanently. The property was bought and occupied by a bank.

===Cameos===
In addition to casting their friends in key roles, Favreau and Vaughn gave cameo roles to their family members. Vaughn&#x27;s father, Vernon Vaughn, plays the lucky gambler at the $100-minimum blackjack table, while Favreau&#x27;s grandmother, Joan Favreau, is the lucky gambler at the $5-minimum blackjack table. Actor Adam Scott, who had lived in the downstairs apartment from Favreau, appeared in the house party scene. Nicole LaLoggia, who was the line producer for the film, cameoed as the voice of Michelle towards the end of the film.

==Reception==
===Release and box office===
Originally, the producers thought about entering &quot;Swingers&quot; into the film festival circuit, but it was not thought serious enough to be considered for Sundance. They then opted to release it commercially, with a preliminary screening at a Fairfax Cinema filled with the cast and crew&#x27;s friends and some prospective buyers. After some negotiations, they sold the film to Miramax for $5 million (Liman recalls it was $5.5 million). It premiered at the Vista Theatre. &quot;Swingers&quot; had a domestic theatrical gross of $4,555,020.

&quot;Swingers&quot; would later get a distribution by Buena Vista Home Video.

===Critical reception===
On review website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 88% based on 56 reviews, with an average rating of 7.7/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Funny, heartfelt, and effortlessly cool, &quot;Swingers&quot; made stars out of Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau, and established Doug Liman as a director to watch.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 71 out of 100, based on 25 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave &quot;Swingers&quot; three out of a possible four stars, writing: &quot;It&#x27;s not a terribly original idea, [yet] the movie is sweet, funny [and] observant.&quot; Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film an “A”, especially praising Favreau for his &quot;exuberantly witty script&quot;. Kenneth Turan of &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that the film “knows how to breathe life into its people, and hooking audiences is its reward.” Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; praised the film&#x27;s engaging tone, writing that it&#x27;s “refreshingly human in its humor.”

==Legacy==
It served as a breakthrough for Vaughn, who gained public exposure and critical acclaim for his performance. In particular, he caught the eye of Steven Spielberg when a copy of the film was sent to the director so they could clear the rights for the &quot;Jaws&quot; music. Spielberg then cast Vaughn in &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot;. Director Liman also used the film to help launch a successful career in Hollywood (he would later be known for &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot;), and it was the first major film for Livingston.

The release of the film coincided with the swing revival of the 1990s. It increased interest in 1940s culture, Hollywood nightlife, and swing music. Some of the slang used in the film became popular in the years following its release, especially the use of the word &quot;money&quot; as a catch-all term of approval or quality. The exclamation &quot;Vegas, baby!&quot; also became a common quote when referencing the city. Big Bad Voodoo Daddy credits much of their later music success to their appearance in the film.

In 2008 the film was voted as the fourteenth best film set in Los Angeles in the previous 25 years by a group of &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; writers and editors with two criteria: &quot;The movie had to communicate some inherent truth about the L.A. experience, and only one film per director was allowed on the list&quot;.

==Soundtrack==

There are two collections from the film; the first soundtrack, &quot;Swingers: Music From The Miramax Motion Picture&quot;, was released in 1996 and contained original music by composer Justin Reinhardt under the name &quot;The Jazz Jury&quot; as well as music by various artists included in the film. The soundtrack was certified gold by the RIAA on September 10, 2019. The second, &quot;Swingers Too!: More Music From... &quot;Swingers&quot;&quot;, was released in 1999.

<text>William Temple (15 October 1881 – 26 October 1944) was an English Anglican priest who served as Bishop of Manchester (1921–1929), Archbishop of York (1929–1942) and Archbishop of Canterbury (1942–1944).

The son of an Archbishop of Canterbury, Temple had a traditional education after which he was briefly a lecturer at the University of Oxford before becoming headmaster of Repton School from 1910 to 1914. After serving as a parish priest in London from 1914 to 1917 and as a canon of Westminster Abbey, he was appointed Bishop of Manchester in 1921. He worked for improved social conditions for workers and for closer ties with other Christian Churches. Despite being a socialist, he was nominated by the Conservative government for the Archbishopric of York in 1928 and took office the following year. In 1942 he was translated to be Archbishop of Canterbury, and died in post after two and a half years, aged 63.

Temple was admired and respected for his scholarly writing, his inspirational teaching and preaching, for his constant concern for those in need or under persecution, and for his willingness to stand up on their behalf to governments at home and abroad.

==Early years==
Temple was born on 15 October 1881 in Exeter, Devon, the second son of Frederick Temple and his wife Beatrice, &quot;née&quot; Lascelles. Frederick Temple was Bishop of Exeter, and later (1896–1902) Archbishop of Canterbury. Despite the considerable age gap – the bishop was 59 years old when Temple was born (Beatrice Temple was 35) – they had a close relationship. Sixty years later Temple referred to his father as &quot;among men the chief inspiration of my life&quot;. In a centenary appraisal Frederick Dillistone wrote:

After a preparatory school, Colet Court, Temple went to Rugby School (1894–1900), where his godfather, John Percival, was headmaster. Temple later wrote a biography of him. At Rugby, Temple began lifelong friendships with the future historian R. H. Tawney and J. L. Stocks, who became a philosopher and academic. 

In 1900 Temple went up to Balliol College, Oxford, where he obtained a double first in classics and served as president of the Oxford Union. The master of Balliol was the philosopher Edward Caird; the biographer Adrian Hastings comments that Caird&#x27;s neo-Hegelian idealism provided the philosophical inspiration for many of Temple&#x27;s academic writings. Temple learned to search for a synthesis in apparently conflicting theories or ideals, and later wrote of &quot;my habitual tendency to discover that everybody is quite right – but I was brought up by Caird and I can never get out of that habit&quot;. In Dillistone&#x27;s view, Temple did not make &quot;any radical distinction between Christianity and the World, the Church and the State, Theology and Philosophy, Religion and Culture&quot;.

While an undergraduate Temple developed a deep concern for social problems, involving himself in the work of the Oxford and Bermondsey Mission, which brought material and spiritual help to the poor of the East End of London. Another enduring interest that began in this period was his concern to make higher education available to intellectually able students from all social and economic backgrounds.

==Oxford and Repton: 1904–1914==
After taking his degree in 1904 Temple received numerous job offers – one biographer says as many as 30 – and he opted for a fellowship at Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, where he went into residence as fellow and lecturer in philosophy in October 1904, remaining there until 1910. According to Hastings his lectures were ostensibly on Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot; but in reality were on his own mix of Greek and Christian themes. His tutorial duties were light, and he had leisure to visit mainland Europe and meet philosophers and theologians such as Rudolf Christoph Eucken, Hans Hinrich Wendt, Adolf von Harnack and Georg Simmel.

For as long as he could remember, Temple had aimed to be ordained, and in January 1906 he approached the Bishop of Oxford, Francis Paget, seeking admission to the diaconate. Paget declined, expressing regret that he could not ordain anyone with such theological views as those of Temple, who was hesitant about accepting the literal truth of the Virgin birth or the bodily resurrection of Christ. After further study, and guidance from the Oxford theologians Henry Scott Holland and Burnett Hillman Streeter, Temple felt ready to try again and in March 1908 he obtained an interview with his father&#x27;s successor as Archbishop of Canterbury, Randall Davidson. After an exchange of letters between Davidson and Paget, the Archbishop made Temple a deacon on 20 December 1908 in Canterbury Cathedral, and ordained him priest on 19 December 1909.

In 1908 Temple became the first president of the newly formed Workers&#x27; Educational Association, a charity dedicated to making the best educational opportunities available to all. In 1910 he published his first book, &quot;The Faith and Modern Thought&quot;. &quot;The Athenaeum&quot; took issue with some of his contentions, but considered that writers like him demonstrated that &quot;a fresh presentation of doctrine may be helpful to religion, and not injurious&quot;. &quot;The Saturday Review&quot; enjoyed the book&#x27;s &quot;vigorous and exuberant healthiness&quot; and predicted, &quot;Matured experience will enable the author to give the world some remarkable work&quot;. 

In June 1910 Lionel Ford, the headmaster of Repton School, moved to the headship of Harrow, and Temple was appointed to succeed him at Repton. The biographer George Bell quotes a Repton colleague on Temple:

Temple shared his colleague&#x27;s reservations about his suitability for the post; in late 1910, during his first term at Repton, he wrote &quot;I doubt whether headmastering is really my line&quot;. On 1 January 1913 it was announced that he had been appointed vicar of St Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster, a post that carried with it one of the canonries of the adjacent Westminster Abbey, but it then emerged that the Abbey statutes required all canons to have served at least six years in holy orders. Temple remained at Repton for another 18 months, and then accepted the benefice of St James&#x27;s, Piccadilly in the West End of London. He was happy to be succeeded as headmaster by Geoffrey Fisher.

==Piccadilly and Westminster Abbey: 1914–1920==
The Piccadilly parish was undemanding, and left Temple free to write and to work on national issues during the early part of the First World War, especially for the National Mission of Repentance and Hope, an initiative designed to renew Christian faith nationwide. He served as editor of &quot;The Challenge&quot;, a non-party Church newspaper, which foundered after two and a half years. He was more successful with the Life and Liberty Movement, a campaign for a measure of independence for the Church of England, which was at that time wholly under the control of Parliament for its laws and rules. In 1916 he married Frances Gertrude Acland Anson (1890–1984). They had no children. The following year Temple gave up the rectorship of St James&#x27;s to make himself free to tour the country campaigning for Life and Liberty. In the same year he completed his largest philosophical work, &quot;Mens Creatrix&quot; (The Creative Mind). In 1918 he joined the Labour Party, and remained a member for eight years.

Temple&#x27;s appointment as a canon of Westminster in June 1919 further raised his public profile. The Abbey was crowded whenever he preached. Hastings writes that it was clear to Archbishop Davidson that so able and influential a man as Temple should be found a suitably important role. Towards the end of 1920, when Temple was 39, the Prime Minister, David Lloyd George, offered him the post of Bishop of Manchester.

==Bishop of Manchester: 1921–1929==
Temple was consecrated bishop at York Minster on 25 January 1921 and enthroned at Manchester Cathedral on 15 February. &quot;The Church Times&quot; later commented, &quot;None of his friends doubted that if he would stick to his new job, and not be lured into a hundred-and-one other activities, he would make a big success&quot;. In the view of the same writer&#x27;:

Temple came as a sharp contrast with his predecessor, Edmund Knox. Knox had been staunchly evangelical and autocratic. He had refused to countenance the division of his over-large diocese; Temple saw that division was essential and founded the separate Diocese of Blackburn in 1926. Hastings comments that while &quot;showing himself a thoroughly pastoral bishop, for whom parish visiting had a high priority&quot;, Temple had wider social and ecumenical agendas. Manchester was a better fit than Piccadilly for his social concerns. It gave him scope for his interest in industrial relations and how Christian philosophy could help improve them. In 1926, after the BBC vetoed Davidson&#x27;s proposed broadcast to help mediate in the General Strike, Temple took a leading part with other bishops in trying to bridge the gulf between the miners and coal owners. He co-operated with other Christian bodies, and as a member of the Council of Christian Congregations in his diocese he took an active part in promoting measures of social improvement. He pursued a policy of inclusiveness among Christians, and invited several nonconformist ministers to preach in the Manchester diocese, which prompted the anti-ecumenical Bishop Weston of Zanzibar to withdraw in protest from the Lambeth Conference.

As well as social concerns, Temple played a role in humanitarian and religious concerns. He was a leading figure in missionary conferences, led missions to undergraduates at Cambridge, Oxford and Dublin, and revitalised the annual Blackpool sands mission. In retrospect (1944) &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; expressed reservations about Temple as a diocesan bishop: &quot;he was doing too many things outside his diocese … he was not really interested in humdrum details of administration&quot;. Nonetheless, &quot;The Church Times&quot; said, &quot;No aspect of life in his diocese was without his touch, whether it were in college, factory, conference hall or theatre. And all the time the flow of books from his pen continued, most of the work being done in the odd snatches of time between interviews and engagements, which lesser men fritter away with a cigarette&quot;.

==Archbishop of York: 1929–1942==
In 1928 Davidson retired, succeeded at Canterbury by Lang, to whom Temple was widely seen as one of six likely successors. He had support from all sections of the Church although there was some concern that the Prime Minister, Stanley Baldwin, a Conservative, would not nominate a prominent Labour supporter. Temple was appointed, and was enthroned at York Minster on 10 January 1929.

Hastings writes that Temple&#x27;s thirteen years at York were &quot;by far the most important and effective in his life&quot;. As Archbishop, Temple was in a position to exercise &quot;the sort of national and international leadership for which he was naturally suited&quot;. Hastings gives examples ranging from local and national – preaching, lecturing, presiding in parishes, university missions, ecumenical gatherings and chairing the General Advisory Council of the BBC – to international – lecturing in American universities, speaking at the 1932 disarmament conference in Geneva and becoming the recognised leader of the international ecumenical movement. He was one of the instigators of the World Council of Churches as well as the British Council of Churches.

While Archbishop of York, in addition to his pastoral work Temple wrote what Hastings regards as his three most enduringly important books: &quot;Nature, Man and God&quot; (1934), &quot;Readings in St John&#x27;s Gospel&quot; (1939 and 1940), and &quot;Christianity and Social Order&quot; (1942). The first of these was compiled from his Gifford lectures given in Glasgow between November 1932 and March 1934; &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; called it &quot;a fine example of [Temple&#x27;s] astonishing vigour and versatility&quot; and quoted Dean Inge&#x27;s comment, &quot;It would be a great achievement for a university professor; for a ruler of the Church it is astonishing&quot;. &quot;Christianity and Social Order&quot; sought to marry faith and socialism and rapidly sold around 140,000 copies.

Temple&#x27;s contributions in the social field during his time as Archbishop of York included working with a specialist committee and the Pilgrim Trust to produce a report on unemployment, &quot;Men without Work&quot; (1938), and convening and chairing the Malvern conference (1941) on church and society. The latter proposed six requisites for a society based on Christianity: every child should find itself a member of a family housed with decency and dignity; every child should have an opportunity for education up to maturity; every citizen should have sufficient income to make a home and bring up his children properly; every worker should have a voice in the conduct of the business or industry in which he works; every citizen should have sufficient leisure – two days&#x27; rest in seven and annual holiday with pay; every citizen should be guaranteed freedom of worship, speech, assembly, and association.

==Archbishop of Canterbury: 1942–1944==

Lang retired as archbishop in March 1942. There had been right-wing political attempts to block Temple&#x27;s succession; he was well aware of this: &quot;some of my recent utterances have not been liked in political circles&quot;. But the overwhelming expectation and desire that Temple should succeed Lang prevailed. His biographer Frederic Iremonger cites Lang&#x27;s strong recommendation together with Temple&#x27;s &quot;reputation at home, in the Anglican communion overseas, and in the continental Churches; his prophetic leadership; his wide and massive knowledge … his immense powers of concentration; the personal devotion of his life&quot;. The Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, who was responsible for nominating the new archbishop, was well aware of Temple&#x27;s political views, but accepted that he was the outstanding candidate: &quot;the only half a crown article in the sixpenny bazaar&quot;. Temple was enthroned in Canterbury Cathedral on 23 April 1942.

In March 1943, Temple addressed the House of Lords, urging action to be taken on the atrocities being carried out by Nazi Germany. He drew criticism in 1944 from his numerous Quaker connections for writing an introduction to Stephen Hobhouse&#x27;s book &quot;Christ and our Enemies&quot; that did not condemn the Allied carpet bombing of Germany; he said that he was &quot;not only non-pacifist but anti-pacifist&quot;. He did not deny pacifists&#x27; right to refuse to fight, but maintained that they must take responsibility for their renunciation of the use of force. He said that people are responsible not only for what they intend, but for the foreseen results of their activity: if Adolf Hitler remained unopposed and conquered Europe, pacifists had to be willing to accept responsibility for this, in that they had not opposed him.

Temple was able to complete the work of Davidson, who had striven unsuccessfully for reform of Britain&#x27;s fragmented and inadequate primary education systems. Davidson had been impeded by nonconformists&#x27; resistance in defence of their own church schools, but by the 1940s the sectarian divide was less rigid, and nonconformist leaders trusted Temple&#x27;s sense of justice and honesty so that he was able to help negotiate the place of all church schools within the system agreed in the Education Act 1944.

In the war years Temple travelled continually around England, often speaking several times in a single day. He suffered all his life from gout, which under the burdens of his workload grew steadily worse and early in October 1944 he was taken by ambulance from Canterbury to rest at a hotel in Westgate-on-Sea, where he died of a heart attack on 26 October. His funeral service was held in Canterbury Cathedral on 31 October and was led by Lang, together with Cyril Garbett, Archbishop of York, and Hewlett Johnson, Dean of Canterbury. Temple was the first Archbishop of Canterbury to be cremated. His ashes were buried in the cloister at Canterbury Cathedral, next to the grave of his father.

==Reputation and legacy==
Temple&#x27;s death was followed by tributes not only from within the Church of England but also from the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Westminster, Bernard Griffin, from nonconformist leaders, and from the Chief Rabbi, Joseph Hertz, who said, &quot;Dr Temple was a great power for good far beyond the borders of the national church. Israel has lost a true friend and humanity a valiant champion. We shall all bitterly miss him.&quot; President Roosevelt wrote to George VI on Temple&#x27;s death expressing the sympathy of the American people, saying, &quot;As an ardent advocate of international co-operation based on Christian principles he exerted a profound influence throughout the world&quot;. Lang was greatly distressed by his successor&#x27;s death. He wrote, &quot;I don&#x27;t like to think of the loss to the Church and Nation... But &#x27;God knows and God reigns&#x27;&quot;.

In a biographical essay, Bishop George Bell wrote:
Among several enduring memorials to Temple is the William Temple Foundation (formerly the William Temple College) in Manchester, a research and resource centre for those developing discipleship and ministry in an urban industrial society.

William Temple is honoured in the Church of England and in the Episcopal Church on 6 November.

<doc id="344987" wikidata="Q858464" url="?curid=344987" title="Big Bad Voodoo Daddy">
<text>Big Bad Voodoo Daddy is a contemporary swing revival band from Southern California. Their notable singles include &quot;Go Daddy-O&quot;, &quot;You &amp; Me &amp; the Bottle Makes 3 Tonight (Baby)&quot;, and &quot;Mr. Pinstripe Suit&quot;. The band played at the Super Bowl XXXIII halftime show in 1999.

The band was originally formed in Ventura, California, in 1989 by leader Scotty Morris (guitar and vocals). The band was named Big Bad Voodoo Daddy after Scotty Morris met blues guitar legend Albert Collins at one of the latter&#x27;s concerts. &quot;He signed my poster &#x27;To Scotty, the big bad voodoo daddy&#x27;,&quot; Morris explains. &quot;I thought it was the coolest name I ever heard on one of the coolest musical nights I ever had. So when it came time to name this band, I didn&#x27;t really have a choice. I felt like it was handed down to me.&quot;

Morris and drummer Kurt Sodergren are the two original members who have appeared in every incarnation of the band. Big Bad Voodoo Daddy has concentrated on performing their own interpretations of swing music of the 1940s and 1950s and original songs in a similar style, regularly touring and performing worldwide.

== History ==
=== Early career: 1989–1996 ===
After playing in punk and alternative rock bands during the 1980s, including False Confession, part of the Oxnard, California Nardcore scene, Scotty Morris founded Big Bad Voodoo Daddy with Kurt Sodergren. The band launched two CDs, &quot;Big Bad Voodoo Daddy&quot; and &quot;Watchu&#x27; Want for Christmas?&quot; under their own label (Big Bad Records) before getting their big break when their songs &quot;You &amp; Me &amp; the Bottle Makes 3 Tonight (Baby)&quot;, &quot;I Wan&#x27;na Be Like You&quot; and &quot;Go Daddy-O&quot; were featured in the soundtrack of the 1996 comedy-drama &quot;Swingers&quot;.

The band was also the house band for the television game show &quot;Big Deal&quot;, a partial remake of &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot;.

=== Commercial success: 1997–2004 ===
From there, they were signed by Interscope Records. With Interscope, the band released &quot;Americana Deluxe&quot;, &quot;This Beautiful Life&quot;, and &quot;Save My Soul&quot;. The band has continued their tours, performances and album releases. The band appeared at the half-time show of Super Bowl XXXIII (January 31, 1999) and the 2006 Capital One Bowl, and also served as the house band for ESPN&#x27;s ESPY Awards for a few years. The band created a version of the opening theme for the sitcom &quot;3rd Rock from the Sun&quot;, which was used for the 1998–1999 and 1999–2000 seasons.

=== Live performances and return: 2005–present ===
They created a new song for the movie &quot;The Wild&quot;, &quot;Big Time Toppin&#x27; (Go Man Go)&quot;, and recorded a song for Disney&#x27;s &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot; &quot;Christmas Vacation&quot; special. Big Bad Voodoo Daddy also performed on the hit television show &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, and &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; to promote their album &quot;How Big Can You Get?: The Music of Cab Calloway&quot;, a collection of their renditions of Cab Calloway songs that was released in April 2009. They also have been performing at EPCOT for the annual Food and Wine Festival since 2008. They performed at Kahilu Theatre, Waimea, Hawaii and while Sodergren was there, he spoke of going to Morris&#x27;s house in Ventura and working on a new album beginning February 2019. He also mentioned that the band had played at one of Donald Trump&#x27;s birthday parties. Their website was updated for their 30th anniversary, which took place in 2023, and mentions upcoming releases.

<text>Sayeret Matkal () (formerly Unit 269 or Unit 262) (English: General Staff Reconnaissance Unit), is the special reconnaissance unit (&quot;sayeret&quot;) of Israel&#x27;s General Staff (&quot;matkal&quot;). It is considered one of the premier special forces units of Israel.

First and foremost a field intelligence-gathering unit, conducting deep reconnaissance behind enemy lines to obtain strategic intelligence, Sayeret Matkal is also tasked with a wide variety of special operations, including black operations; as well as combat search and rescue, counterterrorism, hostage rescue, HUMINT, irregular warfare, long-range penetration, conducting manhunts, and reconnaissance beyond Israel&#x27;s borders. The unit is modeled after the British Army&#x27;s Special Air Service (SAS), taking the unit&#x27;s motto &quot;Who Dares Wins&quot;. The unit is the Israeli equivalent of the SAS. It is directly subordinate to the Special Operations Division of the IDF&#x27;s Military Intelligence Directorate.

== History ==
In 1954, Israel&#x27;s first special operations unit—Unit 101—was disbanded following the outcry provoked by the Qibya massacre. This left the IDF without a dedicated special-forces unit other than the Navy&#x27;s Shayetet 13, a naval commando unit that could not fully replace Unit 101. In 1957, Major Avraham Arnan, a former yeshiva student and Palmach fighter, petitioned the IDF General Staff to create a unit that could be dispatched to enemy-held territory to carry out top secret intelligence-gathering missions. Arnan&#x27;s idea (backed by David Ben-Gurion and Yitzhak Rabin) was to create a unit that would recruit only the best and the brightest of Israeli youth. Prospective fighters were to be hand-picked, being physically and intellectually the best soldiers available. Originally part of Aman&#x27;s Unit 504, Sayeret Matkal began to operate independently a year later as the General Staff&#x27;s special operations force, modeled after the British Special Air Service. Members of the unit were trained by Bedouin trackers to obtain a better understanding of their adversaries. Established a year after the formation of Israel&#x27;s first helicopter squadron, the close co-operation between the two units allowed Sayeret Matkal to deploy longer and deeper inside Arab territory than its predecessor. Arnan&#x27;s vision for Sayeret Matkal (of which he was the first commander) was of a unit that would carry out strategic intelligence-gathering and other operations; as such it would receive its missions only from the General Staff. Sayeret Matkal would also evaluate new weapons and doctrines that could influence the entire IDF.

In the first years of the unit, it was manned by Palmach veterans, veterans of the intelligence corps, veterans of Unit 101 and the paratroopers unit. Among them Isaac Shoshan, Yair Harari, Eli Gil (&quot;Daud&quot;), Sami Nachmias, Charles Levy (&quot;Salem&quot;), Moshe Levin (Kukala), Shmuel Ben Zvi (Shemil), Yitzhak Ghibli (&quot;The Little One&quot;), Yehiel Amsalem – the commander of the first team in the unit, Meir Har-Zion, Avshalom Adam, Aharon Eshel, Micah Kapusta, Rami Kafkafi and many other young people from kibbutzim.

Its first operational activity was carried out in a dedicated assignment in Lebanon in May 1962. The success of this mission paved the way for the unit&#x27;s second operation five months later in Syria. In the early 1960s, Sayeret Matkal conducted several intelligence-gathering operations in the Sinai Peninsula—the last of which was launched just four months before the outbreak of the Six-Day War. But, due to the extensive training, planning and preparation that had to be undertaken before its missions, Sayeret Matkal ended up not seeing any action during the war itself. It was however engaged extensively in the following War of Attrition. After 1967, with the rise of Arab terrorism perpetrated by groups such as the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), Sayeret Matkal began developing the first counterterrorism and hostage rescue techniques in the world. Beginning with Operation Isotope, the unit carried out several high-profile operations that thrust it into the limelight as an &quot;elite paratroopers&quot; unit (Sayeret Matkal&#x27;s existence was classified at the time). In 1972, during the Munich Olympic hostage crisis, it was reported that Mossad head Zvi Zamir offered the assistance of Sayeret Matkal for the hostage rescue. However, the West German government rejected the offer, insisting that the Bavarian State Police would handle the crisis. In the subsequent Mossad assassinations following the Munich massacre, Sayeret Matkal struck the PLO in Beirut.

The Yom Kippur War in 1973 brought a profound change to the unit. With Israel fighting on two fronts and the General Staff busy with managing the war, Sayeret Matkal found itself without missions to perform. Sayeret Matkal officers then split into two camps: those who believed that the unit should be kept in reserve and not be lightly sent to missions where it could endure heavy casualties, and those that wanted to go into action, even if that meant missions with little planning and more akin to a commando force than to the strategic-oriented Sayeret Matkal. The latter prevailed and Sayeret Matkal was tasked with operations on both fronts. After the war, Sayeret Matkal began developing plans for wartime in advance, so that when war came, the unit could go into action immediately, without waiting for the General Staff&#x27;s orders and missions. A reserve company of Sayeret Matkal was also designated specifically for cooperation with the Israeli Air Force, shown by the war to be lacking. This would later evolve into the Shaldag Unit.

In 1974, Sayeret Matkal suffered a heavy blow when a failed rescue attempt resulted in the Ma&#x27;alot massacre. The debacle led to the creation of the Yamam to deal with domestic counter-terrorism/hostage-rescue missions, while Sayeret Matkal would focus on foreign counter-terrorism/hostage-rescue. Two years later, on 4 July 1976, came the unit&#x27;s most famous mission when it spearheaded Operation Entebbe to rescue hostages held in Uganda by at least six Palestinians and two German terrorists supported by regular Ugandan soldiers. The mission was a resounding success, although there were three hostages killed, as well as the commander of the unit, Lieutenant Colonel Yonatan Netanyahu.

Although a top-secret unit, Sayeret Matkal had tremendous influence on the IDF. It was the original developer of helicopter infiltration techniques in Israel. In addition, their extensive use of the Uzi led them to convince Israel Military Industries to produce an Uzi with a folding stock for increased accuracy while maintaining its small frame. In 2015, the unit received an honorable mention for its activities during Operation Protective Edge. In September 2023, the IDF announced a new pilot program that will allow women to join the unit for the first time, set to start in November 2024.

In the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, the unit had reportedly lost at least 11 soldiers and was preparing to liberate hostages captured by Hamas.

In September 2024, the unit raided an underground Iranian-built precision missile factory near the Syrian city of Masyaf – around 25 miles (40km) north of the Lebanese border. Operators roped down from hovering helicopters before engaging in a firefight with Syrian guards at the facility, killing around 18 people. The commandos then used explosives to blow up the underground facility – including sophisticated machinery. Commandos removed some equipment and documents during the raid. 

== Recruitment and training ==

The unit was kept top-secret during its initial years and its very existence was never officially acknowledged until the 1980s. Most of its operations and capabilities are considered classified to this day. Fighters and commanders were selectively hand-picked, based on personal acquaintances and referrals. Since the 1970s, while still secretive, the unit opened to voluntary recruits. Twice a year it holds a notoriously gruelling selection camp (&quot;Gibbush&quot;) for potential recruits lasting several sleepless days. The recruits are constantly monitored by doctors and psychologists. Those who make it through with a passing grade are admitted. During the 1990s, this selection practice was picked up by other IDF special forces (Sayeret).

The basic requirements for being considered to serve in the unit are a medical profile of 97 (with no disqualifying clauses), a quality category (&quot;kaba&quot;) of 52 or more, and an initial psychotechnic grading (&quot;dapar&quot;) of 50 or more. Once admitted to the unit, the recruits&#x27; training lasts for about two years, with heavy emphasis on camouflage, combat and patrolling techniques in urban areas, defusing disposal of bombs and land mines, fast tactical shooting, living off the desert and mountain, martial arts, navigation, reconnaissance tactics, small unit tactics, tactical driving, tactical emergency medical, tracking tactics, unconventional raid tactics, navigational skills, small arms and light weapons, and other skills required for survival behind enemy lines. They must also complete the Beret March in the final four days to receive their red beret.
The training regime consists of the following:

* Four months of basic infantry training, held in the Paratroopers basic training base; it is part of the regular Paratroopers basic training routine.
* Two months advanced infantry training, within the unit.
* Three weeks parachuting course in the IDF Parachuting School.
* Five weeks counter-terror (CT) course in the IDF Counter-Terror Warfare School, followed by more inner-unit CT training.
* The rest of the training is dedicated to long-range reconnaissance patrol training, and especially to navigation/orienteering, which is of vast importance in the unit. While most of the orienteering training is done in pairs for safety reasons, as in every other unit in the IDF, Sayeret Matkal is one of the handful of IDF units which conducts long-range solo navigation exercises.

Toward the end of their training, Sayeret Matkal recruits, along with recruits for other special forces units and pilot cadets, undergo a two-week course in enduring captivity. After a surprise mock kidnapping, they are held in prison-like conditions and subjected to interrogation, threats, and physical violence, and forced to perform demeaning activities.

Today, all the soldiers in the unit undergo officer&#x27;s course at the end of their training and move on to hold positions in the unit as well as other IDF units. The combat soldiers are required to sign on for an additional 36 months in addition to their mandatory service term. Most of the combat soldiers will commence an undergraduate university degree towards the end of their service.

Although Sayeret Matkal has its own insignia, it is also one of only two units in the IDF, the other being Duvdevan, whose soldiers are not allowed to wear it in public due to its classified nature. This lack of insignia often leads to Sayeret Matkal operators being recognized as such, as the fact that Matkal troopers don&#x27;t wear insignia is well known.

== Notable members ==

Sayeret Matkal veterans have gone on to achieve high positions in Israel&#x27;s military and political echelons. Several have become IDF Generals and members of the Knesset. Ehud Barak&#x27;s career is an example: a draftee in 1959, he later succeeded Unit 101 commando Lt. Meir Har-Zion in becoming Israel&#x27;s most decorated soldier. While with Sayeret Matkal, Barak led operations &quot;Isotope&quot; in 1972 and &quot;Spring of Youth&quot; in 1973. He later advanced in his military career to become the IDF Chief of Staff between 1991 and 1995. In 1999 he became the 10th Prime Minister of Israel.
* Nadav Argaman – team leader, later director of the Shin Bet.
* Doron Avital – commander 1992–1994. Member of 18th Knesset for Kadima.
* Shay Avital – unit commander during the 1982 Lebanon War, later first commander of the Depth Corps.
* Naftali Bennett – former Israeli Prime Minister, Defense Minister and leader of Yamina party.
* Muki Betser – second in command of Operation Entebbe. Founder of the Shaldag Unit.
* Nechemya Cohen – the Unit&#x27;s and the IDF&#x27;s most decorated soldier (with Barak). Killed in action. Beit Nechemya was built in his memory by &quot;the Unit&quot;.
* Avi Dichter – unit fighter, later head of Israel&#x27;s General Security Service (Shin Bet), later the minister of internal security.
* Daniel M. Lewin – co-founder of Akamai Technologies. He was the first victim of the September 11 attacks.
* Shaul Mofaz – unit deputy commander, later IDF Chief of Staff and former Defense Minister of Israel.
* Benjamin Netanyahu – unit team leader, current Prime Minister of Israel.
* Iddo Netanyahu – writer and radiologist. Benjamin Netanyahu&#x27;s younger brother.
* Yonatan Netanyahu – unit commander, killed in Operation Entebbe. Benjamin Netanyahu and Iddo Netanyahu&#x27;s older brother.
* Moshe Yaalon – unit commander, later IDF Chief of Staff, Strategic Affairs Minister of Israel and Defense Minister of Israel.
* Uzi Yairi – unit commander, formerly head of the IDF Paratroopers Brigade, killed in action while off-duty during Savoy Operation.
* Danny Yatom – unit deputy commander, later a General, head of Mossad and a Knesset member.
* Doron Kempel – unit deputy commander, called to lead the planning and preparation of Operation Bramble Bush.

There is a widely held misconception that former Israeli major general and former prime minister Ariel Sharon served in Sayeret Matkal. Although as a major, Sharon founded the IDF&#x27;s first special-forces unit (Unit 101) in 1953, he never served in Sayeret Matkal.

<doc id="345005" wikidata="Q1190888" url="?curid=345005" title="The Mote in God's Eye">
<text>The Mote in God&#x27;s Eye is a science fiction novel by American writers Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle, first published in 1974. The story is set in the distant future of Pournelle&#x27;s CoDominium universe, and charts the first contact between humanity and an alien species. The title of the novel is a reference to the Biblical &quot;The Mote and the Beam&quot; parable and is the nickname of a star. &quot;The Mote in God&#x27;s Eye&quot; was nominated for the Hugo, Nebula and Locus Awards in 1975.

==Setting==
&quot;The Mote in God&#x27;s Eye&quot; (originally titled &quot;Motelight&quot;) is set in Pournelle&#x27;s CoDominium universe, where a union of the United States and the Soviet Union produced a world government and a number of colonies in other star systems, followed by nuclear war on Earth and the rise of the First Empire based on the planet Sparta several centuries before the events of the novel. There is a reference to these events in Pournelle&#x27;s novel &quot;King David&#x27;s Spaceship&quot;.

Many, but not all, humans are part of the Second Empire, held together by an interstellar navy modeled on 19th century British lines, with all-male crews, a highly competent officer corps grown from midshipmen recruited in their teens and trained on the job, and well-armed, well-organized Marines to carry out ground missions. Those who prove themselves worthy can be promoted into the aristocracy. The aristocrats themselves tend more towards duty than privilege. The Empire is predominantly Christian, but other religions are more or less tolerated. The people of the planet Dayan are Jewish, while Horace Bury is a Muslim business magnate from Levant. An upstart religion, the &quot;Church of Him&quot;, which was founded when the Mote became intensely bright and was regarded as part of the Face of God, is shown in decline, its founder having committed suicide when the light from the Mote went out.

The Second Empire sees its mission as uniting humanity into one government to prevent war. But in service of this mission, the empire is capable of extreme brutality; it has sterilized a planet to prevent rebellion.

==Plot summary==
In the year 3017, humanity is slowly recovering from an interstellar civil war that tore apart the first Empire of Man. The Second Empire is busy establishing control over the remnants left by its predecessor, by force if necessary. The Alderson Drive enables ships to travel instantaneously between &quot;Alderson points&quot; in specific star systems.

After a rebellion on the planet New Chicago is quashed, Captain Bruno Cziller of the Imperial battlecruiser INSS &quot;MacArthur&quot; remains behind as Chief of Staff to the new governor, while Commander Roderick Blaine is given temporary command of the ship, along with secret orders to take Horace Hussein Bury, a powerful interstellar merchant suspected of instigating the revolt, to the Imperial capital, Sparta. Another passenger is Lady Sandra &quot;Sally&quot; Bright Fowler, the niece of an Imperial senator and a traumatized former prisoner of the rebels.

New Caledonia is the capital of the Trans-Coalsack sector, on the opposite side of the Coalsack Nebula from Earth. Also in the sector is a red supergiant star known as Murcheson&#x27;s Eye. Associated with it is a yellow Sun-like star, which from New Caledonia appears in front of the Eye. Since some see the Eye and the Coalsack as the face of God, the yellow star is known as the Mote in God&#x27;s Eye.

Approaching New Caledonia, &quot;MacArthur&quot; is ordered to investigate when an alien spacecraft, propelled by a solar sail, is detected. After the spacecraft fires upon &quot;MacArthur&quot;, Blaine has its main capsule detached from the sail and taken aboard at great risk to his ship and crew. Its sole occupant, a brown and white furred creature, is found dead.

After much debate, &quot;MacArthur&quot; and the battleship &quot;Lenin&quot; are sent to the star from which the alien ship came, the Mote. &quot;MacArthur&quot; carries civilian researchers to make first contact with the aliens, quickly nicknamed &quot;Moties&quot;. Admiral Kutuzov, aboard &quot;Lenin&quot;, has strict orders to avoid all contact with the aliens and ensure that human technology does not fall into their hands. The Moties seem friendly and have advanced technology that they are willing to trade, much to Bury&#x27;s delight. Although they also possess the Alderson Drive, none of their ships have ever returned. This is because, unknown to the Moties, the Mote&#x27;s only Alderson exit point lies within the outer layers of the star Murcheson&#x27;s Eye. Human warships can survive there for a limited time because of their protective Langston Fields, which the Moties do not have.

The Moties are an old species, native to a planet that the humans label Mote Prime, that has evolved into many specialized subspecies. The first taken aboard &quot;MacArthur&quot; is an &quot;Engineer&quot;, possessing amazing technical abilities, but limited speech and free will. It brings along a pair of tiny &quot;Watchmakers&quot; as helpers. Some days later, a delegation of &quot;Mediators&quot; (like the dead pilot of the probe ship) arrive. Their specialty is communication and negotiation. The Mediators invite the humans to send a party to Mote Prime. After some debate, the invitation is accepted. Each person in this group acquires a &quot;Fyunch(click)&quot;, a Mediator who studies their human subject and tries to learn how to think like them.

Back on &quot;MacArthur&quot;, the Watchmakers escape, and although it is assumed they have died, they have actually been breeding furiously out of sight. Undetected by the crew, they modify parts of &quot;MacArthur&quot; to suit their needs. When they are discovered, a battle for control of the ship erupts. The crew is eventually forced to abandon ship after suffering casualties. The party on Mote Prime is quickly recalled without explanation and told to rendezvous with &quot;Lenin&quot;. Once &quot;MacArthur&quot; is evacuated, &quot;Lenin&quot; fires on and destroys her to prevent the potential capture of human technology.

During the evacuation, &quot;MacArthur&quot; midshipmen Staley, Whitbread and Potter are cut off and forced to escape in Watchmaker-modified lifeboats. The lifeboats automatically land in a sparsely populated area of Mote Prime. There the midshipmen find a fortified museum. It provides evidence of a very long and violent history, though the Moties had carefully portrayed themselves as completely peaceful. Following this discovery, the midshipmen are tracked down by Whitbread&#x27;s Mediator Fyunch(click), who reveals that Moties (other than the short-lived, sterile Mediators) must become pregnant periodically or die. This inevitably results in overpopulation ... and civilization-ending wars. The Masters, whom the Mediators obey, have also concealed the existence of one Motie subspecies from the humans: Warriors more deadly than any human, even Sauron supersoldiers.

The museums exist to help restore civilization after a collapse. The &quot;Cycles&quot; of civilization, war, and collapse have gone on for hundreds of thousands of years, leaving the Moties fatalistically resigned to their destiny. Only a mythical character called &quot;Crazy Eddie&quot; believes there is a way to change this, and any Motie who comes to believe a solution is possible is labeled a &quot;Crazy Eddie&quot; and deemed insane.

The current civilization is governed by a type of industrial feudalism, with coalitions of Masters in control of the planet. One faction, led by &quot;King Peter&quot;, wanted to reveal the truth to the humans, but was overruled. Colonization of other planets would inexorably bring about conflict with humans, as the inevitable Motie population explosion would force them to seek to take over human worlds. Nonetheless, the more powerful coalition sees this temporary solution as preferable to the impending collapse. Both factions send Warriors after the midshipmen, one to capture them, the other to rescue them. The stronger group&#x27;s Warriors trap the midshipmen, but the trio refuse to surrender and die as a result.

Unaware of the midshipmen&#x27;s fate, &quot;Lenin&quot; leaves the Mote system, taking with it three ambassadors, a sterile Master and two Mediators, whose mission is to open the galaxy to their species while concealing their terrible secrets.

An Imperial Commission is on the verge of granting colonies to the Moties, but &quot;MacArthur&quot; Sailing Master/Lieutenant Kevin Renner figures out the truth just in time. It is the passengers on the original probe, deliberately ejected into space, that give the game away. Not only is there a Warrior among the group, but several are visibly pregnant, demolishing any argument about them being statues or religious icons.

The decision is made to gather a battle fleet to either disarm or try to annihilate the Moties. The ambassadors are faced with the extinction of their species, knowing that the Masters would never submit. However, a Mediator comes up with a third option: a blockade of the system&#x27;s only Alderson exit point. This plan is adopted, over the strenuous opposition of Bury, who views the Moties as the greatest threat humanity has ever faced.

==Characters==
; Commander Roderick &quot;Rod&quot; Blaine: A navy officer and member of an influential aristocratic family, Blaine is promoted to captain of the Imperial battlecruiser INSS &quot;MacArthur&quot;. On return to New Scotland from the Mote, he is retired from active service and appointed to the Commission charged with negotiating with the Moties.
; Lady Sandra &quot;Sally&quot; Bright Fowler: After leaving the Imperial University at Sparta with a master&#x27;s degree in anthropology, she and a classmate named Dorothy embarked on a trip to study primitive cultures (such as human colonies isolated by the civil war) first hand. They became caught up in the revolution on New Chicago. Dorothy disappeared and Sally was imprisoned in a concentration camp, where she took on a leadership role. Months later, she and her two retainers were rescued by Imperial forces. The niece of an Imperial senator, she is sent home aboard &quot;MacArthur&quot;, but talks herself onto the expedition to the Mote based on her skills.
; His Excellency Horace Hussein Chamoun al Shamlan Bury: An Imperial magnate, Chairman of the Board of Imperial Autonetics, and a leading member of the Imperial Traders Association, Bury instigates the rebellion on New Chicago. The Navy suspects his involvement, so he is made a virtual, though unofficial, prisoner aboard &quot;MacArthur&quot;, with the intent of sending him to New Sparta to face the judgement of the Imperial Court. Although rich, he is not in a position to bribe Blaine, whose family is even richer. His experiences during the evacuation of &quot;MacArthur&quot; turn him into an advocate for isolating or even destroying the Moties.
; Nabil: Bury&#x27;s servant, skilled with dagger and poison. Travels with Bury to New Scotland, the Mote, and eventually to Sparta. At Bury&#x27;s command, he captures two &quot;Watchmaker&quot; Moties and places them in a spacesuit&#x27;s air tank in suspended animation. Later Bury throws the tank away, having become intensely fearful of Moties.
; Commander Jack Cargill: First lieutenant of &quot;MacArthur&quot;, promoted to executive officer after the battle of New Chicago.
; Commander Jock (Sandy) Sinclair: &quot;MacArthur&quot;″s chief engineer. Born in New Scotland.
; Jonathon Whitbread: A &quot;MacArthur&quot; midshipman, he becomes the first man to make contact with a living Motie. He has an easygoing personality in contrast to his shipmate Horst Staley. Whitbread is described as being &quot;17 standard years old&quot;, slightly younger than the more senior Staley.
; Horst Staley: A &quot;MacArthur&quot; midshipman. Born on the former rebel planet &quot;Sauron&quot;, he adheres rigidly to naval regulations and the chain of command, and displays no sense of humor. Like the other midshipman, Staley is still in his teens. Despite this, he is put in command of a boarding party of marines ordered to rescue trapped passengers and retrieve Motie technology during the evacuation of &quot;MacArthur&quot;.
; Gavin Potter: A &quot;MacArthur&quot; midshipman. Born on New Scotland, he joins the crew when &quot;MacArthur&quot; refuels at a moon of one of the outer planets in the New Caledonia system. Potter serves as the guide to New Scot culture for other characters, particularly the cult known as the Church of Him. He describes the intense light seen coming from the Mote a century earlier, convincing the crew that the incoming probe from there was launched using lasers.
; Kevin Renner: The sailing master of &quot;MacArthur&quot; and former merchant navy officer does not regard himself as a permanent Navy officer. He displays a somewhat irreverent attitude towards the Navy and its traditions while supporting the Imperial Aristocracy style of government.
; Admiral Lavrenti Kutuzov: Kutuzov is chosen to command the mission to the Mote because of his ruthless devotion to duty by whatever means are necessary: He once reduced a populated planet to ashes in order to stop a dangerous rebellion against the Empire of Man.
; Senator Benjamin Bright Fowler: Sally&#x27;s uncle, dispatched to New Scotland to meet &quot;Lenin&quot; on return from the Mote, and head of the Commission to negotiate with Moties.
; Father David Hardy: The ship&#x27;s chaplain aboard MacArthur and an expert linguist, he becomes part of the team that meets the first Motie delegation. Incorrectly regarded as &quot;unworldly&quot;, he does not believe everything the Moties say, observing that &quot;priests hear a lot of lies&quot;. He is also the first to interpret some Motie communication.
; Dr. Anthony Horvath: Minister of Science for Trans-Coalsack sector. Leader of the New Scotland science delegation to the Mote. He advocates for open contact with the Moties, ignorant of any threat they represent.
; Dr. Jacob Buckman: An astrophysicist whom Bury cultivates as a source of information about the activities of the rest of MacArthur&#x27;s crew.
; Admiral Plekhanov: Fleet Commander in the Battle of New Chicago, then Acting Governor-General of the recaptured colony.
; Bruno Cziller: Captain commanding &quot;MacArthur&quot;, then Rear-Admiral on Plekhanov&#x27;s staff on New Chicago, ceding command of his ship to Blaine.

===Moties===
Moties are described as bipeds, about tall, covered with fur whose color depends on the subspecies. Their most obvious feature is the asymmetric arrangement of arms, with two dexterous right arms and one heavily muscled left arm whose musculature attaches to the head, so that Moties have no left ear to match the large, membrane-like right ear. The backbone is jointed rather than flexible and the entire upper body swivels to turn the head. The face is simple and incapable of expression. Gestures replace facial expression.

Masters have all-white fur, described as silky. Engineers have brown fur, while Mediators, bred of Masters and Engineers, have patchy fur in brown and white and are sterile. Siblings tend to have identical patterns of patches. Masters are obeyed by all other Motie subspecies, though Mediators have some independence to negotiate between Masters. Other Motie subspecies include Warriors, Doctors with extra dexterity, and semi-sentient Farmers who raise crops. Watchmakers are small and have four arms in a symmetrical arrangement.

Moties alternate between sexes as part of their reproductive cycle, except for Mediators who cannot reproduce and have shorter lives. Masters may become sterile males with hormone treatment, at which point they can become Keepers, who preserve resources considered too essential to be fought over.

; The Asteroid Miner: After &quot;MacArthur&quot; appears in the system, the first ship to rendezvous comes from a group of Trojan asteroids related to the only gas giant planet. The pilot is an Engineer. Whitbread boards the Miner&#x27;s ship and finds it occupied by the Miner and dozens of Watchmakers. The Miner accompanies Whitbread back to &quot;MacArthur&quot;, bringing two Watchmakers and killing the rest by evacuating her ship&#x27;s air. The humans are unable to communicate with the Miner, not realizing her status, but discover her ability to improve gadgets. Before the next delegation of Moties arrives, the Miner dies from failing to become pregnant in time. The Watchmakers reproduce in vast numbers and re-make &quot;MacArthur&quot; under the humans&#x27; noses, eventually leading to the ship&#x27;s evacuation and destruction.
; Whitbread&#x27;s Motie: When the midshipmen land on Mote Prime, Whitbread&#x27;s Fyunch(click) arrives in an aircraft with Charlie, another Mediator, and an Engineer. Whitbread&#x27;s Motie serves a Master who was given jurisdiction over interaction with humans, but will kill the midshipmen rather than expose the truth about Moties. At this point all the other Fyunch(click) Mediators are either &quot;Crazy Eddie&quot; or helping their Master. She is instrumental in helping the midshipmen get away from the Museum, explaining their peril to them, and instructing the Brown to work on weapons and transport for them. She kills Whitbread to save him from capture, Whitbread doing the same for Potter while Staley dies fighting. She is later executed in shame for killing her Fyunch(click).
; &quot;Charlie&quot;: Charlie is a Mediator whose Master, &quot;King Peter&quot;, is willing to protect the midshipmen and send them home. Charlie regards Whitbread&#x27;s Motie as Crazy Eddie but is willing to work with her to prevent a war. Later Charlie is one of the three Moties sent to negotiate with the humans. It is Charlie who suggests the blockade of the Motie system to prevent the annihilation of her species.
; &quot;Ivan&quot;: Ivan is a Keeper, a sterile Master in the male phase who cannot have children and theoretically has no interest in dynastic conflict. Keepers have jurisdiction over vital resources, such as the Museums, used to help rebuild civilization after the inevitable collapse. Ivan is the official ambassador to the Empire.
; &quot;Jock&quot;: Jock is a Mediator, the third member of the Motie negotiation team. She is in the first delegation of Moties that meets &quot;MacArthur&quot; but does not become a Fyunch(click). She serves the same Master as Whitbread&#x27;s Motie. Her job is to study Kutuzov, the commander of the expedition, but has to do so only indirectly, as Kutuzov is under strict orders to not communicate with the Moties.

==Crazy Eddie==
The Moties frequently refer to the mythical character they call &quot;Crazy Eddie&quot; when talking to humans. There are many Crazy Eddie stories, but all revolve around the inevitability of repeated cycles of collapse of Motie civilization and the pointlessness of trying to prevent them. The drive that humans call the Alderson Drive, which allows human ships to travel between star systems, is called by Moties the Crazy Eddie Drive, because although it is founded in sound science and has been reinvented many times by Motie civilizations, ships that attempt to use it disappear and are never seen again. The Moties do not know that the ships they send emerge inside the hot photosphere of Murcheson&#x27;s Eye and are destroyed. Human ships survive this because they are equipped with the energy-absorbing Langston Field. The point in space where the Alderson Drive operates is known to the Moties as the Crazy Eddie Point. This is the title of the second part of the novel. The other parts are titled &quot;The Crazy Eddie Probe&quot;, &quot;Meet Crazy Eddie&quot;, and &quot;Crazy Eddie&#x27;s Answer&quot;. From the Moties point of view, humans are Crazy Eddie. Several Moties, including Rod Blaine&#x27;s Fyunch(click), become Crazy Eddie after exposure to human attitudes.

==Reception==
Robert A. Heinlein, while giving the authors extensive advice on a draft manuscript, described it as &quot;a very important novel, possibly the best contact-with-aliens story ever written&quot;. Theodore Sturgeon, writing in &quot;Galaxy,&quot; described &quot;The Mote in God&#x27;s Eye&quot; as &quot;one of the most engrossing tales I have encountered in years&quot;, stating that &quot;the overall pace of the book [and] the sheer solid &quot;story&quot; of it&quot; excuse whatever flaws might remain, with the one complaint being that he found it unlikely the Moties would not have used genetic engineering at some point to curb their population growth. Don Hawthorne, one of the creators of the related &quot;War World Series&quot; and creator of the Saurons in those books, has stated, &quot;This, of course, is the &#x27;beam&#x27; in the Moties&#x27; own &#x27;eye&#x27;; their inability to see a solution to their problem because of a lack of objective understanding of their situation, a result of cultural and environmental pressures which have shaped their own personal prejudices.&quot;

&quot;Portsmouth Times&quot; reviewer Terry McLaughlin found the novel &quot;a superior tale, told without the pseudo-psychology background that seems to mar many a new science fiction novel.&quot;

Brian W. Aldiss and David Wingrove wrote that while the imagined aliens were &quot;fascinating creations&quot;, the &quot;style and characterization [emphasize] the weaknesses of both Niven and Pournelle.&quot;

==Awards and nominations==
* Nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1975.
* Nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1975.
* Nominated for the Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel in 1975.

==Sequels==
Pournelle and Niven followed up with the sequel &quot;The Gripping Hand&quot; and in 2010 Pournelle&#x27;s daughter, Jennifer, published an authorized sequel entitled &quot;Outies&quot;.

==Other related works==

60,000 words were cut from the novel before publication.

The short story &quot;Reflex&quot; was instead published in 1983 in the first &quot;There Will Be War&quot; collection, edited by Pournelle and John F. Carr. It details an early phase of the battle for New Chicago, told from the rebels&#x27; point of view. &quot;MacArthur&quot;, with Captain Cziller in command and Blaine as executive officer, engages and defeats a rebel ship, but because of the technology, particularly the Langston Field, the ship is still deadly and surrender is a complex matter. Midshipman Horst Staley is sent to board and disable the ship while carrying a suicide bomb to prevent interference. He makes a mistake, allowing the &quot;political officer&quot; aboard the ship to snatch away the bomb, but the crew who are sick of the revolt overpower the officer. This preys on his mind during the events of the main novel. The rebel ship is taken as a prize, renamed &quot;Defiant&quot;, and commanded by Blaine during the final battle.

&quot;Motelight&quot; was also originally written as part of the novel, but was never published except as part of the non-fiction piece &quot;Building &#x27;The Mote in God&#x27;s Eye&#x27;&quot; that appeared in Pournelle&#x27;s collection &quot;A Step Farther Out&quot;. It describes how two astronomers on the planet New Scotland try to continue their work during the war with neighboring New Ireland, and are thus the first to see the sudden brightening of the Mote due to the laser launch system being activated. The rest of the population are hiding under the Langston Fields protecting their cities from bombardment, until one day the field fails and they see the Coal Sack with a glowing green Eye. The story also mentions &quot;Howard Grote Littlemead&quot;, who believes that the bright Mote is really the Eye of God, and founds the Church of Him. It is in one of the churches that Potter shows Renner and Staley a holographic picture of the Coal Sack showing the intense green glow of the Mote.

Larry Niven also wrote a poem, &quot;In Memoriam: Howard Grote Littlemead&quot;, that was published much later.

<doc id="345008" wikidata="Q579035" url="?curid=345008" title="Araucana">
<text>The Araucana () is a breed of domestic chicken from Chile. The name derives from the historic Araucanía region where it is believed to have originated. It lays blue-shelled eggs, one of very few breeds that do so.

Breed standards for the Araucana vary from country to country. It may have unusual tufts of feathers on the ears, and may be rumpless, without a tail and tail-bone; in the United States it may for this reason be known as the South American Rumpless. Both ear-tufts and rumplessness are caused by lethal genes, so not all birds display these traits. The Ameraucana breed and &quot;Easter egger&quot; hybrids of the United States, which also lay blue or green eggs, both derive from the Araucana.

== History ==

The early history of the Araucana is not documented. The birds were commonly seen in South America in the early twentieth century. The Spanish aviculturist Salvador Castelló, who visited Chile in 1914, saw them and named them &quot;Gallina Araucana&quot;, as many were found among the Mapuche people of the Araucanía region of Chile, whom the Spanish called &quot;Araucanos&quot;. Castelló believed the birds to belong to a new species, and reported his observations at the First World&#x27;s Poultry Congress in The Hague in 1921. The systematic name &quot;Gallus inauris&quot; was proposed for them, and adopted at the Second World&#x27;s Poultry Congress in Barcelona in 1924. It was later established that the Araucana belongs to the same species as other domestic chickens, &quot;Gallus gallus domesticus&quot;.

The blue egg of the Araucana was at this time thought to be unique among chickens. In 1933 Reginald Punnett showed that the blue egg (&quot;oocyan&quot;) gene in chickens is dominant with respect to white, while in combination with genes for brown eggs, various shades of green and olive are produced. In modern times, the Ameraucana breed, a derivative of the Araucana, also lays blue eggs, while hybrid birds carrying the dominant oocyan gene may in the United States be called &quot;Easter eggers&quot;.

Several theories have been advanced to explain the origin of the blue egg characteristic. It has been variously attributed to hybridisation with &quot;Tinamus solitarius&quot;, a species of tinamou (dismissed as &quot;erroneous&quot; by Helmut Sick); to genetic mutation; and to the action of a retrovirus soon after the domestication of the chicken.

Blue Araucana eggs were taken to Australia from New Zealand in the 1930s. The breed was standardised in the 1980s.

Blue-egg chickens from South America were introduced to the British Isles at various times in the early twentieth century. The modern British-type Araucana derives from birds from a Chilean ship that was wrecked in the Hebrides. The British Araucana was developed mainly by George Malcolm in Scotland in the 1930s.. He introduced the lavender plumage variety, and bred the bantam Araucana in the 1940s. The British-type Araucana was standardised in 1969 or 1974.

In the United States, two breeds were established: the Araucana, which has ear-tufts and is rumpless, was standardised in 1976; and the Ameraucana, which is bearded, muffed and tailed (and thus similar to the tailed British type), and was added to the &quot;Standard of Perfection&quot; in 1984.

There has been a long and inconclusive debate about the origin of the Araucana and whether it derives from chickens brought by Europeans after Columbus reached the Americas in 1492, or if it was already present. A report published in 2007 on chicken bones found on the Arauco Peninsula in south-central Chile suggested pre-Columbian, possibly Polynesian, origin. A report published in 2008 found no evidence of pre-Columbian introduction from Polynesia.

The world-wide conservation status of the Araucana is &quot;not at risk&quot;; population data for Chile is not reported.

== Characteristics ==

There are both full-sized and bantam Araucanas. They may be either normally tailed or rumpless. The Araucana has a pea comb and lays approximately 250 blue or green eggs per year.

In Australia, only the tailed Araucana is recognised in the Australian Poultry Standards; both tailed and rumpless may be exhibited.

The British standard accepts both tailed and rumpless; they may be treated as separate breeds. The British type of Araucana has a beard and muffs which conceal the earlobes.

In North America, Araucanas have long ear-tufts and are rumpless. As both ear-tufts and rumplessness are caused by autosomal dominant lethal alleles, not all of the birds can display these traits.

A total of twenty plumage varieties are listed for the Araucana by the Entente Européenne d’Aviculture et de Cuniculture. Of these, five are recognised by the American Poultry Association for large fowl: black, black breasted red, silver duckwing, golden duckwing, and white; for bantams, buff is added to these. The &quot;Australian Poultry Standard&quot; recognises black, cuckoo, lavender, splash, white and any colour which is standard in Old English Game. The Poultry Club of Great Britain recognises twelve colours: black, black-red, blue, blue-red, crele, cuckoo, golden duckwing, lavender, pile, silver duckwing, spangled, and white.

<text>Rumpless chickens are characterised by caudal dysplasia, the absence of the pygostyle or caudal appendage – the &quot;parson&#x27;s nose&quot;. This is the result of inheritance of an autosomal dominant trait. The mutation which causes it is unknown; two candidates have been proposed.

== History ==
Rumplessness in chickens has been documented for centuries. An early description is that of the Bolognese ornithologist Ulisse Aldrovandi in his &quot;Ornithologiae Tomus Alter&quot; of 1600.

== Rumpless breeds ==

Rumpless breeds of chicken include: the Araucana or Rumpless Araucana of South America, both large fowl and bantam; the Belgian Barbu de Boitsfort, Barbu de Grubbe and Barbu d&#x27;Everberg bantams; the Japanese Uzurao, a rumpless equivalent of the Tosa-Kojidori bantam, and Ingie (large fowl) from Kagoshima Prefecture; the Rumpless Game of the United Kingdom (both large fowl and bantam), sometimes called the Manx Rumpy or Persian Rumpless; and the German Ruhlaer Zwerg-Kaulhühner or Rumpless Booted Bantam.

<text>Silesian (Silesian: &#x27;, ),Silesian GermanorLower Silesian is a nearly extinct German dialect spoken in Silesia. It is part of the East Central German language area with some West Slavic and Lechitic influences. Silesian German emerged as the result of Late Medieval German migration to Silesia, which had been inhabited by Lechitic or West Slavic peoples in the Early Middle Ages.

Until 1945, variations of the dialect were spoken by about seven million people in Silesia and neighboring regions of Bohemia and Moravia. After World War II, when the province of Silesia was incorporated into Poland, with small portions remaining in northeastern Czech Republic and in former central Germany, which henceforth became eastern Germany, the local communist authorities expelled the German-speaking population and forbade the use of the language.

Silesian German continued to be spoken only by individual families, only few of them remaining in their home region, but most of them expelled to the remaining territory of Germany. Most descendants of the Silesian Germans expelled to West and East Germany no longer learned the dialect, and the cultural gatherings were less and less frequented.

A remaining German minority in Opole Voivodeship continues use of German in Upper Silesia, but only the older generation speaks the Upper Silesian dialect of Silesian German in today&#x27;s Poland.

== History ==

In origin, Silesian German appears to derive from 12th-century dialects of Middle High German, including medieval forms of Upper Saxon German, East Franconian German and Thuringian. The German-speaking inhabitants of Silesia are thought to be descendants of settlers from Upper Lusatia, Saxony, Thuringia and Franconia who first arrived in Silesia (back then part of Piast Poland) in the 13th century.

By migration over the Sudetes, the language spread to neighboring regions of Bohemia. In the 13th century, German-speaking settlers from Silesia arrived at the region around Trautenau (Trutnov), and the region around Freiwaldau (Jeseník), often founding settlements in previously uninhabited mountainous areas.

After World War II, local communist authorities forbade the use of the language. After the forcible expulsion of the Germans from Silesia, German Silesian culture and language nearly died out when most of Silesia became part of Poland in 1945. Polish authorities banned the use of the German language. There are still unresolved feelings on the sides of both Poles and Germans, largely because of Nazi Germany&#x27;s war crimes on Poles and the forced expulsion and ethnic cleansing of native Germans from former German territories that were transferred to Poland in the wake of the Potsdam Agreement.

The German Silesian dialect is not recognized by the Polish State in any way, although the status of the German minority in Poland has improved much since the 1991 communist collapse and Polish entry into the European Union.

Silesian can be grouped like this:
* (East Central German or East Middle German)
** (Silesian)
*** (Mountain Silesian)
**** 
*** (South-East Silesian)
**** 
*** (Middle or Central Silesian)
*** (West Silesian)
A rough division can be made into: and (influenced by Central Bavarian).

Silesian German was the language in which the poetry of Karl von Holtei and Gerhart Hauptmann was written, during the 19th century.

<text>The finite volume method (FVM) is a method for representing and evaluating partial differential equations in the form of algebraic equations.
In the finite volume method, volume integrals in a partial differential equation that contain a divergence term are converted to surface integrals, using the divergence theorem. 
These terms are then evaluated as fluxes at the surfaces of each finite volume. Because the flux entering a given volume is identical to that leaving the adjacent volume, these methods are conservative. Another advantage of the finite volume method is that it is easily formulated to allow for unstructured meshes. The method is used in many computational fluid dynamics packages.
&quot;Finite volume&quot; refers to the small volume surrounding each node point on a mesh.

Finite volume methods can be compared and contrasted with the finite difference methods, which approximate derivatives using nodal values, or finite element methods, which create local approximations of a solution using local data, and construct a global approximation by stitching them together. In contrast a finite volume method evaluates exact expressions for the &quot;average&quot; value of the solution over some volume, and uses this data to construct approximations of the solution within cells.

==Example==

Consider a simple 1D advection problem:

Here, formula_1 represents the state variable and formula_2 represents the flux or flow of formula_3. Conventionally, positive formula_4 represents flow to the right while negative formula_4 represents flow to the left. If we assume that equation () represents a flowing medium of constant area, we can sub-divide the spatial domain, formula_6, into &quot;finite volumes&quot; or &quot;cells&quot; with cell centers indexed as formula_7. For a particular cell, formula_7, we can define the &quot;volume average&quot; value of formula_9 at time formula_10 and formula_11, as

 \int_{x_{i-1/2}}^{x_{i+1/2}} \rho \left(x,t_1 \right)\, dx ,&lt;/math&gt;|}}

and at time formula_12 as,

 \int_{x_{i-1/2}}^{x_{i+1/2}} \rho \left(x,t_2 \right)\, dx ,&lt;/math&gt;|}}

where formula_13 and formula_14 represent locations of the upstream and downstream faces or edges respectively of the formula_15 cell.

Integrating equation () in time, we have:

where formula_16.

To obtain the volume average of formula_17 at time formula_18, we integrate formula_19 over the cell volume, formula_20 and divide the result by formula_21, i.e.

^{x_{i+1/2}}\left\{ \rho\left( x,t_{1}\right) - \int_{t_{1}}^{t_2} f_{x} \left( x,t \right) dt \right\} dx.&lt;/math&gt;|}}

We assume that formula_22 is well behaved and that we can reverse the order of integration. Also, recall that flow is normal to the unit area of the cell. Now, since in one dimension formula_23, we can apply the divergence theorem, i.e. formula_24, and substitute for the volume integral of the divergence with the values of formula_25 evaluated at the cell surface (edges formula_26 and formula_14) of the finite volume as follows:
 \left( \int_{t_1}^{t_2} f_{i + 1/2} dt
- \int_{t_1}^{t_2} f_{i - 1/2} dt
\right) .&lt;/math&gt;|}}

where formula_28.

We can therefore derive a &quot;semi-discrete&quot; numerical scheme for the above problem with cell centers indexed as formula_7, and with cell edge fluxes indexed as formula_30, by differentiating () with respect to time to obtain:

where values for the edge fluxes, formula_31, can be reconstructed by interpolation or extrapolation of the cell averages. Equation () is &quot;exact&quot; for the volume averages; i.e., no approximations have been made during its derivation.

This method can also be applied to a 2D situation by considering the north and south faces along with the east and west faces around a node.

== General conservation law ==

We can also consider the general conservation law problem, represented by the following PDE,

Here, formula_32 represents a vector of states and formula_33 represents the corresponding flux tensor. Again we can sub-divide the spatial domain into finite volumes or cells. For a particular cell, formula_34, we take the volume integral over the total volume of the cell, formula_35, which gives,

 \frac{\partial \mathbf u}{\partial t}\, dv 
+ \int _{v_{i}} \nabla \cdot {\mathbf f}\left( {\mathbf u } \right)\, dv = {\mathbf 0} .&lt;/math&gt;|}}

On integrating the first term to get the &quot;volume average&quot; and applying the &quot;divergence theorem&quot; to the second, this yields

{{NumBlk|:|formula_36|{{EquationRef|10}}}}

where formula_37 represents the total surface area of the cell and formula_38 is a unit vector normal to the surface and pointing outward. So, finally, we are able to present the general result equivalent to ({{EquationNote|8}}), i.e.

{{NumBlk|:|formula_39|{{EquationRef|11}}}}

Again, values for the edge fluxes can be reconstructed by interpolation or extrapolation of the cell averages. The actual numerical scheme will depend upon problem geometry and mesh construction. MUSCL reconstruction is often used in high resolution schemes where shocks or discontinuities are present in the solution.

Finite volume schemes are conservative as cell averages change through the edge fluxes. In other words, &quot;one cell&#x27;s loss is always another cell&#x27;s gain&quot;!

<doc id="345023" wikidata="Q6059147" url="?curid=345023" title="Intuitionistic type theory">
<text>Intuitionistic type theory (also known as constructive type theory, or Martin-Löf type theory (MLTT)) is a type theory and an alternative foundation of mathematics.
Intuitionistic type theory was created by Per Martin-Löf, a Swedish mathematician and philosopher, who first published it in 1972. There are multiple versions of the type theory: Martin-Löf proposed both intensional and extensional variants of the theory and early impredicative versions, shown to be inconsistent by Girard&#x27;s paradox, gave way to predicative versions. However, all versions keep the core design of constructive logic using dependent types.

==Design==
Martin-Löf designed the type theory on the principles of mathematical constructivism. Constructivism requires any existence proof to contain a &quot;witness&quot;. So, any proof of &quot;there exists a prime greater than 1000&quot; must identify a specific number that is both prime and greater than 1000. Intuitionistic type theory accomplished this design goal by internalizing the BHK interpretation. A useful consequence is that proofs become mathematical objects that can be examined, compared, and manipulated.

Intuitionistic type theory&#x27;s type constructors were built to follow a one-to-one correspondence with logical connectives. For example, the logical connective called implication (formula_1) corresponds to the type of a function (formula_2). This correspondence is called the Curry–Howard isomorphism. Prior type theories had also followed this isomorphism, but Martin-Löf&#x27;s was the first to extend it to predicate logic by introducing dependent types.

==Type theory==
Intuitionistic type theory has three finite types, which are then composed using five different type constructors. Unlike set theories, type theories are not built on top of a logic like Frege&#x27;s. So, each feature of the type theory does double duty as a feature of both math and logic.

&quot;If you are unfamiliar with type theory and know set theory, a quick summary is: Types contain terms just like sets contain elements. Terms belong to one and only one type. Terms like formula_3 and formula_4 compute (&quot;reduce&quot;) down to canonical terms like 4. For more, see the article on type theory.&quot;

===0 type, 1 type and 2 type ===
There are three finite types: The 0 type contains 0 terms. The 1 type contains 1 canonical term. And the 2 type contains 2 canonical terms.

Because the 0 type contains 0 terms, it is also called the empty type. It is used to represent anything that cannot exist. It is also written formula_5 and represents anything unprovable. (That is, a proof of it cannot exist.) As a result, negation is defined as a function to it: formula_6.

Likewise, the 1 type contains 1 canonical term and represents existence. It also is called the unit type.

Finally, the 2 type contains 2 canonical terms. It represents a definite choice between two values. It is used for Boolean values but &quot;not&quot; propositions.

Propositions are instead represented by particular types. For instance, a true proposition can be represented by the 1 type, while a false proposition can be represented by the 0 type. But we cannot assert that these are the only propositions, i.e. the law of excluded middle does not hold for propositions in intuitionistic type theory.

===Σ type constructor===
Σ-types contain ordered pairs. As with typical ordered pair (or 2-tuple) types, a Σ-type can describe the Cartesian product, formula_7, of two other types, formula_8 and formula_9. Logically, such an ordered pair would hold a proof of formula_8 and a proof of formula_9, so one may see such a type written as formula_12.

Σ-types are more powerful than typical ordered pair types because of dependent typing. In the ordered pair, the type of the second term can depend on the value of the first term. For example, the first term of the pair might be a natural number and the second term&#x27;s type might be a sequence of reals of length equal to the first term. Such a type would be written:

:formula_13

Using set-theory terminology, this is similar to an indexed disjoint union of sets. In the case of the usual cartesian product, the type of the second term does not depend on the value of the first term. Thus the type describing the cartesian product formula_14 is written:

:formula_15

It is important to note here that the value of the first term, formula_16, is not depended on by the type of the second term, formula_17.

Σ-types can be used to build up longer dependently-typed tuples used in mathematics and the records or structs used in most programming languages. An example of a dependently-typed 3-tuple is two integers and a proof that the first integer is smaller than the second integer, described by the type:

:formula_18

Dependent typing allows Σ-types to serve the role of existential quantifier. The statement &quot;there exists an formula_16 of type formula_20, such that formula_21 is proven&quot; becomes the type of ordered pairs where the first item is the value formula_16 of type formula_20 and the second item is a proof of formula_21. Notice that the type of the second item (proofs of formula_21) depends on the value in the first part of the ordered pair (formula_16). Its type would be:

:formula_27

===Π type constructor===
Π-types contain functions. As with typical function types, they consist of an input type and an output type. They are more powerful than typical function types however, in that the return type can depend on the input value. Functions in type theory are different from set theory. In set theory, you look up the argument&#x27;s value in a set of ordered pairs. In type theory, the argument is substituted into a term and then computation (&quot;reduction&quot;) is applied to the term.

As an example, the type of a function that, given a natural number formula_16, returns a vector containing formula_16 real numbers is written:

:formula_30

When the output type does not depend on the input value, the function type is often simply written with a formula_31. Thus, formula_32 is the type of functions from natural numbers to real numbers. Such Π-types correspond to logical implication. The logical proposition formula_1 corresponds to the type formula_2, containing functions that take proofs-of-A and return proofs-of-B. This type could be written more consistently as:

:formula_35

Π-types are also used in logic for universal quantification. The statement &quot;for every formula_16 of type formula_20, formula_21 is proven&quot; becomes a function from formula_16 of type formula_20 to proofs of formula_21. Thus, given the value for formula_16 the function generates a proof that formula_43 holds for that value. The type would be

:formula_44

=== = type constructor ===
=-types are created from two terms. Given two terms like formula_3 and formula_46, you can create a new type formula_47. The terms of that new type represent proofs that the pair reduce to the same canonical term. Thus, since both formula_3 and formula_4 compute to the canonical term formula_50, there will be a term of the type formula_47. In intuitionistic type theory, there is a single way to introduce =-types and that is by reflexivity:

:formula_52

It is possible to create =-types such as formula_53 where the terms do not reduce to the same canonical term, but you will be unable to create terms of that new type. In fact, if you were able to create a term of formula_53, you could create a term of formula_5. Putting that into a function would generate a function of type formula_56. Since formula_57 is how intuitionistic type theory defines negation, you would have formula_58 or, finally, formula_59.

Equality of proofs is an area of active research in proof theory and has led to the development of homotopy type theory and other type theories.

===Inductive types===

Inductive types allow the creation of complex, self-referential types. For example, a linked list of natural numbers is either an empty list or a pair of a natural number and another linked list. Inductive types can be used to define unbounded mathematical structures like trees, graphs, etc.. In fact, the natural numbers type may be defined as an inductive type, either being formula_60 or the successor of another natural number.

Inductive types define new constants, such as zero formula_61 and the successor function formula_62. Since formula_63 does not have a definition and cannot be evaluated using substitution, terms like formula_64 and formula_65 become the canonical terms of the natural numbers.

Proofs on inductive types are made possible by induction. Each new inductive type comes with its own inductive rule. To prove a predicate formula_43 for every natural number, you use the following rule:

:formula_67

Inductive types in intuitionistic type theory are defined in terms of W-types, the type of well-founded trees. Later work in type theory generated coinductive types, induction-recursion, and induction-induction for working on types with more obscure kinds of self-referentiality. Higher inductive types allow equality to be defined between terms.

===Universe types===
The universe types allow proofs to be written about all the types created with the other type constructors. Every term in the universe type formula_68 can be mapped to a type created with any combination of formula_69 and the inductive type constructor. However, to avoid paradoxes, there is no term in formula_70 that maps to formula_70 for any formula_72.

To write proofs about all &quot;the small types&quot; and formula_68, you must use formula_74, which does contain a term for formula_68, but not for itself formula_74. Similarly, for formula_77. There is a predicative hierarchy of universes, so to quantify a proof over any fixed constant formula_78 universes, you can use formula_79.

Universe types are a tricky feature of type theories. Martin-Löf&#x27;s original type theory had to be changed to account for Girard&#x27;s paradox. Later research covered topics such as &quot;super universes&quot;, &quot;Mahlo universes&quot;, and impredicative universes.

==Judgements==
The formal definition of intuitionistic type theory is written using judgements. For example, in the statement &quot;if formula_8 is a type and formula_9 is a type then formula_82 is a type&quot; there are judgements of &quot;is a type&quot;, &quot;and&quot;, and &quot;if ... then ...&quot;. The expression formula_82 is not a judgement; it is the type being defined.

This second level of the type theory can be confusing, particularly where it comes to equality. There is a judgement of term equality, which might say formula_84. It is a statement that two terms reduce to the same canonical term. There is also a judgement of type equality, say that formula_85, which means every element of formula_8 is an element of the type formula_9 and vice versa. At the type level, there is a type formula_84 and it contains terms if there is a proof that formula_50 and formula_3 reduce to the same value. (Terms of this type are generated using the term-equality judgement.) Lastly, there is an English-language level of equality, because we use the word &quot;four&quot; and symbol &quot;formula_50&quot; to refer to the canonical term formula_92. Synonyms like these are called &quot;definitionally equal&quot; by Martin-Löf.

The description of judgements below is based on the discussion in Nordström, Petersson, and Smith.

The formal theory works with &quot;types&quot; and &quot;objects&quot;.

A type is declared by:
* formula_93
An object exists and is in a type if:
* formula_94
Objects can be equal
* formula_95
and types can be equal
* formula_96
A type that depends on an object from another type is declared
* formula_97
and removed by substitution
* formula_98, replacing the variable formula_99 with the object formula_100 in formula_9.
An object that depends on an object from another type can be done two ways.
If the object is &quot;abstracted&quot;, then it is written
* formula_102
and removed by substitution
* formula_103, replacing the variable formula_99 with the object formula_100 in formula_106.
The object-depending-on-object can also be declared as a constant as part of a recursive type. An example of a recursive type is:
* formula_107
* formula_108
Here, formula_63 is a constant object-depending-on-object. It is not associated with an abstraction. Constants like formula_63 can be removed by defining equality. Here the relationship with addition is defined using equality and using pattern matching to handle the recursive aspect of formula_63:
: formula_112
formula_63 is manipulated as an opaque constant - it has no internal structure for substitution.

So, objects and types and these relations are used to express formulae in the theory. The following styles of judgements are used to create new objects, types and relations from existing ones:

By convention, there is a type that represents all other types. It is called formula_114 (or formula_115). Since formula_114 is a type, the members of it are objects. There is a dependent type formula_117 that maps each object to its corresponding type. &quot;In most texts formula_117 is never written.&quot; From the context of the statement, a reader can almost always tell whether formula_8 refers to a type, or whether it refers to the object in formula_114 that corresponds to the type.

This is the complete foundation of the theory. Everything else is derived.

To implement logic, each proposition is given its own type. The objects in those types represent the different possible ways to prove the proposition. If there is no proof for the proposition, then the type has no objects in it. Operators like &quot;and&quot; and &quot;or&quot; that work on propositions introduce new types and new objects. So formula_121 is a type that depends on the type formula_8 and the type formula_9. The objects in that dependent type are defined to exist for every pair of objects in formula_8 and formula_9. If formula_8 or formula_9 has no proof and is an empty type, then the new type representing formula_128 is also empty.

This can be done for other types (booleans, natural numbers, etc.) and their operators.

==Categorical models of type theory==
Using the language of category theory, R. A. G. Seely introduced the notion of a locally cartesian closed category (LCCC) as the basic model of type theory. This has been refined by Hofmann and Dybjer to &quot;Categories with Families&quot; or &quot;Categories with Attributes&quot; based on earlier work by Cartmell.

A category with families is a category &quot;C&quot; of contexts (in which the objects are contexts, and the context morphisms are substitutions), together with a functor &quot;T&quot; : &quot;C&quot;op → &quot;Fam&quot;(&quot;Set&quot;).

&quot;Fam&quot;(&quot;Set&quot;) is the category of families of Sets, in which objects are pairs of an &quot;index set&quot; &quot;A&quot; and a function &quot;B&quot;: &quot;X&quot; → &quot;A&quot;, and morphisms are pairs of functions &quot;f&quot; : &quot;A&quot; → &quot;A&#x27; &quot; and &quot;g&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;X&#x27; &quot;, such that &quot;B&#x27; &quot; ° &quot;g&quot; = &quot;f&quot; ° &quot;B&quot; – in other words, &quot;f&quot; maps &quot;Ba&quot; to &quot;B&quot;&quot;g&quot;(&quot;a&quot;).

The functor &quot;T&quot; assigns to a context &quot;G&quot; a set of types, and for each , a set of terms. The axioms for a functor require that these play harmoniously with substitution. Substitution is usually written in the form &quot;Af&quot; or &quot;af&quot;, where &quot;A&quot; is a type in and &quot;a&quot; is a term in , and &quot;f&quot; is a substitution from &quot;D&quot; to &quot;G&quot;. Here and .

The category &quot;C&quot; must contain a terminal object (the empty context), and a final object for a form of product called comprehension, or context extension, in which the right element is a type in the context of the left element. If &quot;G&quot; is a context, and , then there should be an object final among contexts &quot;D&quot; with mappings &quot;p&quot; : &quot;D&quot; → &quot;G&quot;, &quot;q&quot; : &quot;Tm&quot;(&quot;D,Ap&quot;).

A logical framework, such as Martin-Löf&#x27;s, takes the form of closure conditions on the context-dependent sets of types and terms: that there should be a type called Set, and for each set a type, that the types should be closed under forms of dependent sum and product, and so forth.

A theory such as that of predicative set theory expresses closure conditions on the types of sets and their elements: that they should be closed under operations that reflect dependent sum and product, and under various forms of inductive definition.

==Extensional versus intensional==
A fundamental distinction is extensional vs intensional type theory. In extensional type theory, definitional (i.e., computational) equality is not distinguished from propositional equality, which requires proof. As a consequence type checking becomes undecidable in extensional type theory because programs in the theory might not terminate. For example, such a theory allows one to give a type to the Y-combinator; a detailed example of this can be found in Nordstöm and Petersson &quot;Programming in Martin-Löf&#x27;s Type Theory&quot;. However, this does not prevent extensional type theory from being a basis for a practical tool; for example, Nuprl is based on extensional type theory.

In contrast, in intensional type theory type checking is decidable, but the representation of standard mathematical concepts is somewhat more cumbersome, since intensional reasoning requires using setoids or similar constructions. There are many common mathematical objects that are hard to work with or cannot be represented without this, for example, integer numbers, rational numbers, and real numbers. Integers and rational numbers can be represented without setoids, but this representation is difficult to work with. Cauchy real numbers cannot be represented without this.

Homotopy type theory works on resolving this problem. It allows one to define higher inductive types, which not only define first-order constructors (values or points), but higher-order constructors, i.e. equalities between elements (paths), equalities between equalities (homotopies), &quot;ad infinitum&quot;.

==Implementations of type theory==
Different forms of type theory have been implemented as the formal systems underlying a number of proof assistants. While many are based on Per Martin-Löf&#x27;s ideas, many have added features, more axioms, or a different philosophical background. For instance, the Nuprl system is based on computational type theory and Coq is based on the calculus of (co)inductive constructions. Dependent types also feature in the design of programming languages such as ATS, Cayenne, Epigram, Agda, and Idris.

==Martin-Löf type theories==
Per Martin-Löf constructed several type theories that were published at various times, some of them much later than when the preprints with their description became accessible to specialists (among others Jean-Yves Girard and Giovanni Sambin). The list below attempts to list all the theories that have been described in a printed form and to sketch the key features that distinguished them from each other. All of these theories had dependent products, dependent sums, disjoint unions, finite types and natural numbers. All the theories had the same reduction rules that did not include η-reduction either for dependent products or for dependent sums, except for MLTT79 where the η-reduction for dependent products is added.

MLTT71 was the first type theory created by Per Martin-Löf. It appeared in a preprint in 1971. It had one universe, but this universe had a name in itself, i.e., it was a type theory with, as it is called today, &quot;Type in Type&quot;. Jean-Yves Girard has shown that this system was inconsistent, and the preprint was never published.

MLTT72 was presented in a 1972 preprint that has now been published. That theory had one universe V and no identity types (=-types). The universe was &quot;predicative&quot; in the sense that the dependent product of a family of objects from V over an object that was not in V such as, for example, V itself, was not assumed to be in V. The universe was à la Russell&#x27;s &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot;, i.e., one would write directly &quot;T∈V&quot; and &quot;t∈T&quot; (Martin-Löf uses the sign &quot;∈&quot; instead of modern &quot;:&quot;) without an added constructor such as &quot;El&quot;.

MLTT73 was the first definition of a type theory that Per Martin-Löf published (it was presented at the Logic Colloquium &#x27;73 and published in 1975). There are identity types, which he describes as &quot;propositions&quot;, but since no real distinction between propositions and the rest of the types is introduced the meaning of this is unclear. There is what later acquires the name of J-eliminator but yet without a name (see pp. 94–95). There is in this theory an infinite sequence of universes V0, ..., V&quot;n&quot;, ... . The universes are predicative, à la Russell and &quot;non-cumulative&quot;. In fact, Corollary 3.10 on p. 115 says that if A∈V&quot;m&quot; and B∈V&quot;n&quot; are such that A and B are convertible then &quot;m&quot; = &quot;n&quot;. This means, for example, that it would be difficult to formulate univalence axiom in this theory—there are contractible types in each of the V&quot;i&quot;, but it is unclear how to declare them to be equal since there are no identity types connecting V&quot;i&quot; and V&quot;j&quot; for &quot;i&quot; ≠ &quot;j&quot;.

MLTT79 was presented in 1979 and published in 1982. In this paper, Martin-Löf introduced the four basic types of judgement for the dependent type theory that has since become fundamental in the study of the meta-theory of such systems. He also introduced contexts as a separate concept in it (see p. 161). There are identity types with the J-eliminator (which already appeared in MLTT73 but did not have this name there) but also with the rule that makes the theory &quot;extensional&quot; (p. 169). There are W-types. There is an infinite sequence of predicative universes that &quot;are cumulative&quot;.

Bibliopolis: there is a discussion of a type theory in the &quot;Bibliopolis&quot; book from 1984, but it is somewhat open-ended and does not seem to represent a particular set of choices and so there is no specific type theory associated with it.

<doc id="345025" wikidata="Q3007890" url="?curid=345025" title="List of Doctor Who supporting characters">
<text>Over the course of its many years on television, the long-running British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; has not only seen changes in the actors to play the Doctor, but in the supporting cast as well.

==Companions==

The Doctor is usually accompanied in his travels by one to three companions (sometimes called assistants). These characters provide a surrogate with whom the audience can identify, and further the story by asking questions and getting into trouble, (similar to Dr. Watson in the Sherlock Holmes mysteries.) The Doctor regularly gains new companions and loses old ones; sometimes they return home, or find new causes on worlds they have visited. A few of the companions have died during the course of the series.

==Recurring characters==

Many characters have appeared in multiple stories; some of which can also dubiously be considered companions, having travelled on the TARDIS, but not as a main character.

==Recurring alien species, monsters, or robots==
=== Major ===
*Daleks
*Cybermen 
*Time Lords

=== Secondary ===
*Autons (of the Nestene Consciousness)
*Cybermats and Cybermites
*Zygons
*Sontarans
*Ice Warriors
*Weeping Angels
*Ood 
*The Silence
*Yeti (of the Great Intelligence)
*Raxacoricofallapatorians (the Slitheen family&#x27;s species) 
*Judoon 
*Ogrons
*Macra
*Silurians and Sea Devils 
*Weevils
*Thals

==Characters from spin-off media==

The &quot;Doctor Who&quot; comics, novels and audio dramas have created companions, villains and supporting characters of their own. Some of these originated in one medium and later appeared in another. The lists below indicate where a character has appeared.

<doc id="345026" wikidata="Q5325646" url="?curid=345026" title="Ear tuft">
<text>Ear tufts are a collection of fur or feathers found on animals which can resemble an animal&#x27;s ear or is near the animal&#x27;s ear.

==Cats==
Ear tufts are not found on all cat breeds. The ear tufts are located on the tips of cat ears and are also known as lynx tipping. Cat ear tufts are often confused with cat ear furnishings which is the fur that comes out of the opening of the ear. Cat ear tufts assist with keeping debris out of the ear and guides sound into the ear canal. 

==Birds==
Bird ear tufts are skin projections covered in feathers found in some bird species, most notably various species of owl, vaguely resembling mammalian ears, but unrelated to the animal&#x27;s hearing. Theories about their function range from improved ability to camouflage, aiding in finding a suitable mate, to giving a more threatening appearance to discourage predators.
===In Araucana chicken===
In the Araucana chicken breed, ear tufts are a mutation. It causes a skin projection covered in feathers to appear on the sides of the head near the ears. This mutation is dominant semi-lethal. Consequently, ear tufts are very unusual and difficult to breed, as most Araucanas are hatched without tufts.
===Lethal gene===
Ear tufts in the Araucana breed of chicken are associated with a lethal gene: An ear tufted hen mated with an ear tufted cock produce chicks with deformed ears and mouth that die before hatching. Also, the rumplessness of the breed makes breeding Araucanas together have very short backs. In any other chicken breed, ear tufts are undesirable.

<doc id="345032" wikidata="Q727946" url="?curid=345032" title="Sacred Love">
<text>Sacred Love is the seventh studio album by the English musician Sting. The album was released on 29 September 2003. The album featured smoother, R&amp;B-style beats and experiments collaborating with hip-hop artist Mary J. Blige and sitar player Anoushka Shankar. Some songs like &quot;Inside&quot; and &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Rope&quot; were well received; and Sting had experimented with new sounds, in particular the more rock-influenced &quot;This War&quot;.

==Background==
Sting adapted the first quatrain of William Blake&#x27;s &quot;Auguries of Innocence&quot; for the first four sung lines of &quot;Send Your Love&quot;.

Sting&#x27;s collaboration with Blige, &quot;Whenever I Say Your Name&quot;, won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals at the 46th Grammy Awards in 2004. The first single &quot;Send Your Love&quot; was also nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance, but it lost to &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; by Justin Timberlake.

In August 2015, Mylène Farmer and Sting duetted on &quot;Stolen Car (Take Me Dancing)&quot; and released it as the lead single from Farmer&#x27;s tenth studio album, &quot;Interstellaires&quot;; the track is produced by The Avener.

==Track listing==
All tracks written by Sting. All tracks produced by Sting and Kipper; co-production on &quot;Send Your Love&quot; by Victor Calderone, and &quot;Never Coming Home&quot; by BT.
===Bonus tracks===
There have been multiple editions of this album. Some of them, such as the Japanese edition, feature various extra songs and remixes. Although the track list on the official Sting website includes a remix of &quot;Send Your Love&quot; and a live version of &quot;Shape of My Heart&quot;, these are not always available.

<doc id="345034" wikidata="Q1476258" url="?curid=345034" title="Pinyon pine">
<text>The pinyon or piñon pine group grows in southwestern North America, especially in New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona, and Utah, with the single-leaf pinyon pine just reaching into southern Idaho. The trees yield edible nuts, which are a staple food of Native Americans, and widely eaten as a snack and as an ingredient in New Mexican cuisine. The name comes from the Spanish &quot;pino piñonero&quot;, a name used for both the American varieties and the stone pine common in Spain, which also produces edible nuts typical of Mediterranean cuisine. Harvesting techniques of the prehistoric American Indians are still used today to collect the pinyon seeds for personal use or for commercialization. The pinyon nut or seed is high in fats and calories. In the western United States, pinyon pines are often found in pinyon–juniper woodlands.

Pinyon wood, especially when burned, has a distinctive fragrance, making it a common wood to burn in chimeneas. Pinyon pine trees are also known to influence the soil in which they grow by increasing concentrations of both macronutrients and micronutrients.

Some of the species are known to hybridize, the most notable ones being &quot;P. quadrifolia&quot; with &quot;P. monophylla&quot;, and &quot;P. edulis&quot; with &quot;P. monophylla&quot;.

The two-needle piñon (&quot;Pinus edulis&quot;) is the official state tree of New Mexico.

==Evolutionary history==
The evolutionary origins of the piñons appear to coincide with the Laramide Orogeny.

== Species ==

Genetic differentiation in the pinyon pine has been observed associated to insect herbivory and environmental stress. There are eight species of true pinyon (&quot;Pinus&quot; subsection &quot;Cembroides&quot;):

* &quot;Pinus cembroides&quot; – Mexican pinyon
* &quot;Pinus orizabensis&quot; – Orizaba pinyon
* &quot;Pinus johannis&quot; – Johann&#x27;s pinyon (includes &quot;P. discolor&quot; – border pinyon)
* &quot;Pinus culminicola&quot; – Potosi pinyon
* &quot;Pinus remota&quot; – Texas pinyon or papershell pinyon
* &quot;Pinus edulis&quot; – two-needle piñon or Colorado pinyon
* &quot;Pinus monophylla&quot; – single-leaf pinyon
* &quot;Pinus quadrifolia&quot; – Parry pinyon (includes &quot;P. juarezensis&quot;).

These additional Mexican species are also related, and mostly called pinyons:

* &quot;Pinus rzedowskii&quot; – Rzedowski&#x27;s pine
* &quot;Pinus pinceana&quot; – weeping pinyon
* &quot;Pinus maximartinezii&quot; – big-cone pinyon
* &quot;Pinus nelsonii&quot; – Nelson&#x27;s pinyon

The three bristlecone pine species of the high mountains of the southwestern United States, and the lacebark pines of Asia are closely related to the pinyon pines.

== Piñon seeds in Native American cuisine ==
The seeds of the pinyon pine, known as &quot;pine nuts&quot; or &quot;piñóns&quot;, are an important food for American Indians living in the mountains of the North American Southwest. All species of pine produce edible seeds, but in North America only pinyon produces seeds large enough to be a major source of food.

The pinyon has likely been a source of food since the arrival of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; in the Great Basin and American Southwest (Oasisamerica). In the Great Basin, archaeological evidence indicates that the range of the pinyon pine expanded northward after the Ice Age, reaching its northernmost (and present) limit in southern Idaho about 4000 BCE. Early Native Americans undoubtedly collected the edible seeds, but, at least in some areas, evidence of large quantities of pinyon nut harvesting does not appear until about 600 CE. Increased use of pinyon nuts was possibly related to a population increase of humans and a decline in the number of game animals, thereby forcing the Great Basin inhabitants to seek additional sources of food.

The suitability of pinyon seeds as a staple food is reduced because of the unreliability of the harvest. Abundant crops of cones and seeds occur only every two to seven years, averaging a good crop every four years. Years of high production of seed tend to be the same over wide areas of the pinyon range.

== Traditional method of harvesting ==
In 1878, naturalist John Muir described the Indian method of harvesting pinyon seeds in Nevada. In September and October, the harvesters knocked the cones off the pinyon trees with poles, stacked the cones into a pile, put brushwood on top, lit it, and lightly scorched the pinyon cones with fire. The scorching burned off the sticky resin coating the cones and loosened the seeds. The cones were then dried in the sun until the seeds could be easily extracted. Muir said the Indians closely watched the pinyon trees year-round and could predict the scarcity or abundance of the crop months before harvest time. In 1891, naturalist B. H. Dutcher observed the harvesting of pinyon seeds by the Panamint Indians (Timbisha people) in the Panamint Range overlooking Death Valley, California. The harvesting method was similar to that observed by Muir in Nevada, except that the pinyon seeds were extracted immediately after the cones had been scorched in the brushwood fire.

Both the above accounts described a method of extracting the seeds from the green cones. Another method is to leave the cones on the trees until they are dry and brown, then beat the cones with a stick, knocking the cones loose or the seeds loose from the cones which then fall to the ground where they can be collected. The nomadic hunter-gathering people of the Great Basin usually consumed their pinyon seeds during the winter following harvest; the agricultural Pueblo people of the Rio Grande valley of New Mexico could store them for two or three years in pits.

Each pinyon cone produces 10 to 30 seeds and a productive stand of pinyon trees in a good year can produce on of land. An average worker can collect about of unshelled pinyon seed in a day&#x27;s work. Production per worker of 22 pounds of unshelled pinyon seeds—more than one-half that in shelled seeds—amounts to nearly 30,000 calories of nutrition. That is a high yield for the effort expended by hunter-gatherers. Moreover, the pinyon seeds are high in fat, often in short supply for hunter-gatherers.

==Relationship with wildlife==

The pinyon jay (&quot;Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus&quot;) takes its name from the tree, and pinyon nuts form an important part of its diet. It is very important for regeneration of pinyon woods, as it stores large numbers of the seeds in the ground for later use, and excess seeds not used are in an ideal position to grow into new trees. The Mexican jay is also important for the dispersal of some pinyon species, as, less often, is the Clark&#x27;s nutcracker. Many other species of animal also eat pinyon nuts, without dispersing them.

&quot;Ips confusus&quot;, known as the pinyon ips, is a bark beetle that kills weak or damaged pinyon pine trees. The beetles feed on the xylem and phloem of the trees. As a defense, the trees flood the holes produced by the beetles with sap.

<doc id="345035" wikidata="Q186310" url="?curid=345035" title="Halo (optical phenomenon)">
<text>A halo () is an optical phenomenon produced by light (typically from the Sun or Moon) interacting with ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere. Halos can have many forms, ranging from colored or white rings to arcs and spots in the sky. Many of these appear near the Sun or Moon, but others occur elsewhere or even in the opposite part of the sky. Among the best known halo types are the circular halo (properly called the 22° halo), light pillars, and sun dogs, but many others occur; some are fairly common while others are extremely rare.

The ice crystals responsible for halos are typically suspended in cirrus or cirrostratus clouds in the upper troposphere (), but in cold weather they can also float near the ground, in which case they are referred to as diamond dust. The particular shape and orientation of the crystals are responsible for the type of halo observed. Light is reflected and refracted by the ice crystals and may split into colors because of dispersion. The crystals behave like prisms and mirrors, refracting and reflecting light between their faces, sending shafts of light in particular directions.

Atmospheric optical phenomena like halos were part of weather lore, which was an empirical means of weather forecasting before meteorology was developed. They often do indicate that rain will fall within the next 24 hours, since the cirrostratus clouds that cause them can signify an approaching frontal system.

Other common types of optical phenomena involving water droplets rather than ice crystals include the glory and the rainbow.

==History==
While Aristotle had mentioned halos and parhelia, in antiquity, the first European descriptions of complex displays were those of Christoph Scheiner in Rome (), Johannes Hevelius in Danzig (1661), and Tobias Lowitz in St Petersburg ().
Chinese observers had recorded these for centuries, the first reference being a section of the &quot;Official History of the Chin Dynasty&quot; (&quot;Chin Shu&quot;) in 637, on the &quot;Ten Haloes&quot;, giving technical terms for 26 solar halo phenomena.

===Vädersolstavlan===

While mostly known and often quoted for being the oldest color depiction of the city of Stockholm, &quot;Vädersolstavlan&quot; (Swedish; &quot;The Sundog Painting&quot;, literally &quot;The Weather Sun Painting&quot;) is arguably also one of the oldest known depictions of a halo display, including a pair of sun dogs. For two hours in the morning of 20 April 1535, the skies over the city were filled with white circles and arcs crossing the sky, while additional suns (i.e., sun dogs) appeared around the Sun.

==Light pillar==

A light pillar, or sun pillar, appears as a vertical pillar or column of light rising from the Sun near sunset or sunrise, though it can appear below the Sun, particularly if the observer is at a high elevation or altitude. Hexagonal plate- and column-shaped ice crystals cause the phenomenon. Plate crystals generally cause pillars only when the Sun is within 6 degrees of the horizon; column crystals can cause a pillar when the Sun is as high as 20 degrees above the horizon. The crystals tend to orient themselves near-horizontally as they fall or float through the air, and the width and visibility of a sun pillar depend on crystal alignment.

Light pillars can also form around the Moon, and around street lights or other bright lights. Pillars forming from ground-based light sources may appear much taller than those associated with the Sun or Moon. Since the observer is closer to the light source, crystal orientation matters less in the formation of these pillars.

==Circular halo==
Among the best-known halos is the 22° halo, often just called &quot;halo&quot;, which appears as a large ring around the Sun or Moon with a radius of about 22° (roughly the width of an outstretched hand at arm&#x27;s length). The ice crystals that cause the 22° halo are oriented semi-randomly in the atmosphere, in contrast to the horizontal orientation required for some other halos such as sun dogs and light pillars. As a result of the optical properties of the ice crystals involved, no light is reflected towards the inside of the ring, leaving the sky noticeably darker than the sky around it, and giving it the impression of a &quot;hole in the sky&quot;. The 22° halo is not to be confused with the corona, which is a different optical phenomenon caused by water droplets rather than ice crystals, and which has the appearance of a multicolored disk rather than a ring.

Other halos can form at 46° to the Sun, or at the horizon, or around the zenith, and can appear as full halos or incomplete arcs.

==Bottlinger&#x27;s ring==
A &quot;Bottlinger&#x27;s ring&quot; is a rare type of halo that is elliptical instead of circular. It has a small diameter, which makes it very difficult to see in the Sun&#x27;s glare and more likely to be noticed around the dimmer subsun, often seen from mountain tops or airplanes. Bottlinger&#x27;s rings are not well understood yet. It is suggested that they are formed by very flat pyramidal ice crystals with faces at uncommonly low angles, suspended horizontally in the atmosphere. These precise and physically problematic requirements would explain why the halo is very rare.

==Other names==
In the Cornish dialect of English, a halo around the sun or the moon is called a &quot;cock&#x27;s eye&quot; and is an omen of bad weather. The term is related to the Breton word &quot;kog-heol&quot; (sun cock) which has the same meaning. In Nepal, the halo round the sun is called &quot;Indrasabha&quot; with a connotation of the assembly court of Lord Indra – the Hindu god of lightning, thunder, and rain.

==Artificial halos==
The natural phenomena may be reproduced artificially by several means. Firstly, by computer simulations, or secondly by experimental means. Regarding the latter, this occurs when a single crystal is rotated around the appropriate axis/axes, or a chemical approach. A still further and more indirect experimental approach is to find analogous refraction geometries.

===Analogous refraction approach===
 This approach employs the fact that in some cases the average geometry of refraction through an ice crystal may be imitated / mimicked via the refraction through another geometrical object. In this way, the circumzenithal arc, the circumhorizontal arc, and the suncave Parry arcs may be recreated by refraction through rotationally symmetric (i.e. non-prismatic) static bodies. A particularly simple table-top experiment reproduces artificially the colorful circumzenithal and circumhorizontal arcs using a water glass only. The refraction through the cylinder of water turns out to be (almost) identical to the rotationally averaged refraction through an upright hexagonal ice crystal / plate-oriented crystals, thereby creating vividly colored circumzenithal and the circumhorizontal arcs. In fact, the water glass experiment is often confused as representing a rainbow and has been around at least since 1920.

Following Huygens&#x27; idea of the (false) mechanism of the 22° parhelia, one may also illuminate (from the side) a water-filled cylindrical glass with an inner central obstruction of half the glasses&#x27; diameter to achieve upon projection on a screen an appearance which closely resembles parhelia (cf. footnote [39] in Ref., or see here), an inner red edge transitioning into a white band at larger angles on both sides of the direct transmission direction. However, while the visual match is close, this particular experiment does not involve a fake caustic mechanism and is thus no real analogue.

===Chemical approaches===
The earliest chemical recipes to generate artificial halos has been put forward by Brewster and studied further by A. Cornu in 1889. The idea was to generate crystals by precipitation of a salt solution. The innumerable small crystals hereby generated will then, upon illumination with light, cause halos corresponding to the particular crystal geometry and the orientation / alignment. Several recipes exist and continue to be discovered. Rings are a common outcome of such experiments. But also Parry arcs have been artificially produced in this way.

===Mechanical approaches===

====Single axis====
The earliest experimental studies on halo phenomena have been attributed to Auguste Bravais in 1847. Bravais used an equilateral glass prism which he spun around its vertical axis. When illuminated by parallel white light, this produced an artificial parhelic circle and many of the embedded parhelia. Similarly, A. Wegener used hexagonal rotating crystals to produce artificial subparhelia. In a more recent version of this experiment, many more embedded parhelia have been found using commercially available hexagonal BK7 glass crystals. Simple experiments like these can be used for educational purposes and demonstration experiments. Unfortunately, using glass crystals one cannot reproduce the circumzenithal arc or the circumhorizontal arc due to total internal reflections preventing the required ray-paths when formula_1.

Even earlier than Bravais, the Italian scientist F. Venturi experimented with pointed water-filled prisms to demonstrate the circumzenithal arc. However, this explanation was replaced later by the CZA&#x27;s correct explanation by Bravais.

 Artificial ice crystals have been employed to create halos which are otherwise unattainable in the mechanical approach via the use of glass crystals, e.g. circumzenithal and circumhorizontal arcs. The use of ice crystals ensures that the generated halos have the same angular coordinates as the natural phenomena. Other crystals such as sodium fluoride (NaF) also have a refractive index close to ice and have been used in the past.

====Two axes====
In order to produce artificial halos such as the tangent arcs or the circumscribed halo one should rotate a single columnar hexagonal crystal about 2 axes. Similarly, the Lowitz arcs can be created by rotating a single plate crystal about two axes. This can be done by engineered halo machines. The first such machine was constructed in 2003; several more followed. Putting such machines inside spherical projection screens, and by the principle of the so-called sky transform, the analogy is nearly perfect. A realization using micro-versions of the aforementioned machines produces authentic distortion-free projections of such complex artificial halos. Finally, superposition of several images and projections produced by such halo machines may be combined to create a single image. The resulting superposition image is then a representation of complex natural halo displays containing many different orientation sets of ice prisms.

====Three axes====
The experimental reproduction of circular halos is the most difficult using a single crystal only, while it is the simplest and typically achieved one using chemical recipes. Using a single crystal, one needs to realize all possible 3D orientations of the crystal. This has recently been achieved by two approaches. The first one using pneumatics and a sophisticated rigging, and a second one using an Arduino-based random walk machine which stochastically reorients a crystal embedded in a transparent thin-walled sphere.

<text>The Gefion Fountain () is a large fountain on the harbour front in Copenhagen, Denmark. It features a large-scale group of oxen pulling a plow and being driven by the Norse goddess Gefjon. It is located in Nordre Toldbod area next to Kastellet and immediately south of Langelinie.

==History==

The fountain was donated to the city of Copenhagen by the Carlsberg Foundation on the occasion of the brewery&#x27;s 50-year anniversary. It was originally supposed to be located in the main town square outside city hall, but it was decided instead to build it near the Øresund in its current location near Kastellet (&quot;The Citadel&quot;).
It was designed by Danish artist Anders Bundgaard, who sculpted the naturalistic figures 1897–99. The basins and decorations were completed in 1908. The fountain was first activated on July 14, 1908.

The fountain underwent extensive renovations starting in 1999. The fountain was out of commission for many years, and was re-inaugurated in September 2004.

==Iconography==
The fountain depicts the mythical story of the creation of the island of Zealand on which Copenhagen is located. The legend appears in &quot;Ragnarsdrápa&quot;, a 9th-century Skaldic poem recorded in the 13th century Prose Edda, and in &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; as recorded in Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s 13th century &quot;Heimskringla&quot;.

According to &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;, the Swedish king Gylfi promised Gefjun the territory she could plow in a night. She turned her four sons into oxen, and the territory they plowed out of the earth was then thrown into the Danish sea between Scania and the island of Fyn. The hole became a lake called &quot;Lögrinn&quot; and &quot;Leginum&quot; (locative). Snorri identifies the lake &quot;Löginn&quot;, as the lake of Old Sigtuna west of Stockholm, i.e., Lake Mälaren, an identification that he returns to later in the &quot;Saga of Olaf the Holy&quot;. The same identification of &quot;Löginn&quot;/&quot;Leginum&quot; as Mälaren appears in &quot;Ásmundar saga kappabana&quot;, where it is the lake by Agnafit (modern Stockholm), and also in &quot;Knýtlinga saga&quot;.

In spite of Snorri&#x27;s identification, tourist information about the fountain identifies the resultant lake as Vänern
, Sweden&#x27;s largest lake, citing the fact that modern maps show that Zealand and the lake resemble each other in size and shape.

Snorri, however, was well acquainted with Vänern as he had visited Västergötland in 1219. When he referred to this lake he called it &quot;Vænir.&quot;

==Cultural references==
The Gefion Fountain is seen at 0:48:47 in the 1972 &quot;Olsen-banden&quot; film &quot;The Olsen Gang&#x27;s Big Score&quot;. It is also seen in the feature films &quot;Jeg elsker en anden&quot; (1946), &quot;Mor bag rattet&quot; (1965), and &quot;Min søsters børn vælter byen&quot; (1968).

==Reception==
Scholar Hilda Ellis Davidson comments that &quot;some of the power of the old tale of Gefjon, creator of the islands, has been superbly expressed in the great fountain at the water&#x27;s edge in Copenhagen, depicting her ploughing through the sea in a cloud of rising spray with her giant beasts.&quot;

<text>The Kushan Empire (– CE) was a syncretic empire formed by the Yuezhi in the Bactrian territories in the early 1st century. It spread to encompass much of what is now Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Eastern Iran and Northern India, at least as far as Saketa and Sarnath, near Varanasi, where inscriptions have been found dating to the era of the Kushan emperor Kanishka the Great.

The Kushans were most probably one of five branches of the Yuezhi confederation, an Indo-European nomadic people of possible Tocharian origin, who migrated from northwestern China (Xinjiang and Gansu) and settled in ancient Bactria. The founder of the dynasty, Kujula Kadphises, followed Iranian and Greek cultural ideas and iconography after the Greco-Bactrian tradition and was a follower of the Shaivite sect of Hinduism. Two later Kushan kings, Vima Kadphises and Vasudeva II, were also patrons of Hinduism. The Kushans in general were also great patrons of Buddhism, and, starting with Emperor Kanishka, they employed elements of Zoroastrianism in their pantheon. They played an important role in the spread of Buddhism to Central Asia and China, ushering in a period of relative peace for 200 years, sometimes described as &quot;Pax Kushana&quot;.

The Kushans possibly used the Greek language initially for administrative purposes but soon began to use the Eastern Iranian Bactrian language. Kanishka sent his armies north of the Karakoram mountains. A direct road from Gandhara to China remained under Kushan control for more than a century, encouraged travel across the Karakoram, and facilitated the spread of Mahayana Buddhism to China. The Kushan dynasty had diplomatic contacts with the Roman Empire, Sasanian Persia, the Aksumite Empire, and the Han dynasty of China. The Kushan Empire was at the center of trade relations between the Roman Empire and China: according to Alain Daniélou, &quot;for a time, the Kushana Empire was the centerpoint of the major civilizations&quot;. While much philosophy, art, and science was created within its borders, the only textual record of the empire&#x27;s history today comes from inscriptions and accounts in other languages, particularly Chinese.

The Kushan Empire fragmented into semi-independent kingdoms in the 3rd century AD, which fell to the Sasanians invading from the west and establishing the Kushano-Sasanian Kingdom in the areas of Sogdiana, Bactria, and Gandhara. In the 4th century, the Guptas, another Indian dynasty, also pressed from the east. The last of the Kushan and Kushano-Sasanian kingdoms were eventually overwhelmed by invaders from the north, known as the Kidarites, and later the Hephthalites.

==Origins==

Chinese sources describe the &quot;Guìshuāng&quot; (, Old Chinese: &quot;*kuj-s [s]raŋ&quot;), &quot;i.e.&quot; the Kushans, as one of the five aristocratic tribes of the Yuezhi. Many scholars believe that the Yuezhi were a people of Indo-European origin. A specifically Tocharian origin of the Yuezhi is often suggested. An Iranian, specifically Saka origin, has also been suggested by some scholars.

The Yuezhi were described in the &quot;Records of the Great Historian&quot; and the &quot;Book of Han&quot; as living in the grasslands of eastern Xinjiang and northwestern part of Gansu, in the northwest of modern-day China, until their King was beheaded by the Xiongnu (匈奴) who were also at war with China, which eventually forced them to migrate west in 176–160 BC. The five tribes constituting the Yuezhi are known in Chinese history as &quot;Xiūmì&quot; (休密), &quot;Guìshuāng&quot; (貴霜), &quot;Shuāngmǐ&quot; (雙靡), &quot;Xìdùn&quot; (肸頓), and &quot;Dūmì&quot; (都密).
The Yuezhi reached the Hellenic kingdom of Greco-Bactria (in northern Afghanistan and Uzbekistan) around 135 BC. The displaced Greek dynasties resettled to the southeast in areas of the Hindu Kush (in present-day Afghanistan and Pakistan) and the Indus basin (in present-day Pakistan and India), occupying the western part of the Indo-Greek Kingdom.

In South Asia, Kushan emperors regularly used the dynastic name &quot;ΚΟϷΑΝΟ&quot; (&quot;Koshano&quot;) on their coinage. Several inscriptions in Sanskrit in the Brahmi script, such as the Mathura inscription of the statue of Vima Kadphises, refer to the Kushan Emperor as , &quot;Ku-ṣā-ṇa&quot; (&quot;Kushana&quot;). Some later Indian literary sources referred to the Kushans as &quot;Turushka&quot;, a name which in later Sanskrit sources was confused with Turk, &quot;probably due to the fact that Tukharistan passed into the hands of the western Turks in the seventh century&quot;. According to John M. Rosenfield, &quot;Turushka&quot;, &quot;Tukhāra&quot; or &quot;Tukhāra&quot; are variations of the word &quot;Tokhari&quot; in Indian writings. Yet, according to Wink, &quot;nowadays no historian considers them to be Turkish-Mongoloid or &quot;Hun&quot;, although there is no doubt about their Central-Asian origin.&quot;

==Early Kushans==

Some traces remain of the presence of the Kushans in the area of Bactria and Sogdiana in the 2nd-1st century BC, where they had displaced the Sakas, who moved further south. Archaeological structures are known in Takht-i Sangin, Surkh Kotal (a monumental temple), and in the palace of Khalchayan. On the ruins of ancient Hellenistic cities such as Ai-Khanoum, the Kushans are known to have built fortresses. Various sculptures and friezes from this period are known, representing horse-riding archers, and, significantly, men such as the Kushan prince of Khalchayan with artificially deformed skulls, a practice well attested in nomadic Central Asia. Some of the Khalchayan sculptural scenes are also thought to depict the Kushans fighting against the Sakas. In these portrayals, the Yuezhis are shown with a majestic demeanour, whereas the Sakas are typically represented with side-whiskers, and more or less grotesque facial expressions.

The Chinese first referred to these people as the Yuezhi and said they established the Kushan Empire, although the relationship between the Yuezhi and the Kushans is still unclear. Ban Gu&#x27;s &quot;Book of Han&quot; tells us the Kushans (Kuei-shuang) divided up Bactria in 128 BC. Fan Ye&#x27;s &quot;Book of Later Han&quot; &quot;relates how the chief of the Kushans, Ch&#x27;iu-shiu-ch&#x27;ueh (the Kujula Kadphises of coins), founded by means of the submission of the other Yueh-chih clans the Kushan Empire.&quot;

The earliest documented ruler, and the first one to proclaim himself as a Kushan ruler, was Heraios. He calls himself a &quot;tyrant&quot; in Greek on his coins, and also exhibits skull deformation. He may have been an ally of the Greeks, and he shared the same style of coinage. Heraios may have been the father of the first Kushan emperor Kujula Kadphises.

The Chinese &quot;Book of Later Han&quot; chronicles then gives an account of the formation of the Kushan empire based on a report made by the Chinese general Ban Yong to the Chinese Emperor :

==Diverse cultural influences==
In the 1st century BC, the &quot;Guishuang&quot; (Ch: 貴霜) gained prominence over the other Yuezhi tribes, and welded them into a tight confederation under commander Kujula Kadphises. The name &quot;Guishuang&quot; was adopted in the West and modified into &quot;Kushan&quot; to designate the confederation, although the Chinese continued to call them &quot;Yuezhi&quot;.

Gradually wresting control of the area from the Scythian tribes, the Kushans expanded south into the region traditionally known as Gandhara (an area primarily in Pakistan&#x27;s Pothowar and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region) and established twin capitals in Kapisa (near modern Bagram) and Pushkalavati (later Charsadda).
The Kushans adopted elements of the Hellenistic culture of Bactria. They adopted the Greek alphabet to suit their own language (with the additional development of the letter Þ &quot;sh&quot;, as in &quot;Kushan&quot;) and soon began minting coinage on the Greek model. On their coins they used Greek language legends combined with Pali legends (in the Kharoshthi script), until the first few years of the reign of Kanishka. After the middle of Kanishka&#x27;s reign, they used Kushan language legends (in an adapted Greek script), combined with legends in Greek (Greek script) and legends in Prakrit (Kharoshthi script). 

Interestingly there is evidence for the collaboration between Greek populations and the Kushans in the 2nd century AD. Apparently the main architect of the Kushan temple at Surkh Kotal was a Greek named Palamedes. A Greek inscription has been found which could be read as: ΔΙΑ ΠΑΛΑΜΕΔΟΥΣ, i.e. &quot;dia Palamedous&quot;, meaning &quot;through or by Palamedes&quot;. This proves that Hellenistic populations still remained in Bactria up into the Kushan era, and also explains how the Greek alphabet could have been applied to the Bactrian language.
The Kushans &quot;adopted many local beliefs and customs, including Zoroastrianism and the two rising religions in the region, the Greek cults and Buddhism&quot;. From the time of Vima Takto, many Kushans started adopting aspects of Buddhist culture, and like the Egyptians, they absorbed the strong remnants of the Greek culture of the Hellenistic Kingdoms, becoming at least partly Hellenised. The great Kushan emperor Vima Kadphises, father of Kanishka, embraced Shaivism, a sect of Hinduism, as surmised by coins minted during the period. The following Kushan emperors represented a wide variety of faiths including Buddhism, Zoroastrianism and Hindu Shaivism.

The rule of the Kushans linked the seagoing trade of the Indian Ocean with the commerce of the Silk Road through the long-civilized Indus Valley. At the height of the dynasty, the Kushans loosely ruled a territory that extended to the Aral Sea through present-day Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and northern India.

The loose unity and comparative peace of such a vast expanse encouraged long-distance trade, brought Chinese silks to Rome, and created strings of flourishing urban centers.

==Territorial expansion==

Rosenfield notes that archaeological evidence of a Kushan rule of long duration is present in an area stretching from Surkh Kotal, Kapisa, the summer capital of the Kushans, Purushapura (modern Peshawar), the capital under Kanishka I, Taxila, and Mathura, the winter capital of the Kushans. The Kushans introduced for the first time a form of governance which consisted of &quot;Kshatrapas&quot; (Brahmi:, &quot;Kṣatrapa&quot;, &quot;Satraps&quot;) and &quot;Mahakshatrapa&quot; (Brahmi: , &quot;Mahakṣatrapa&quot;, &quot;Great Satraps&quot;).

Other areas of probable rule include Khwarezm and its capital city of Toprak-Kala, Kausambi (excavations of Allahabad University), Sanchi and Sarnath (inscriptions with names and dates of Kushan kings), Malwa and Maharashtra, and Odisha (imitation of Kushan coins, and large Kushan hoards).
 Lines 4 to 7 of the inscription describe the cities which were under the rule of Kanishka, among which six names are identifiable: Ujjain, Kundina, Saketa, Kausambi, Pataliputra, and Champa (although the text is not clear whether Champa was a possession of Kanishka or just beyond it). The Buddhist text &quot;Śrīdharmapiṭakanidānasūtra&quot;—known via a Chinese translation made in AD 472—refers to the conquest of Pataliputra by Kanishka. A 2nd century stone inscription by a Great Satrap named Rupiamma was discovered in Pauni, south of the Narmada river, suggesting that Kushan control extended this far south, although this could alternatively have been controlled by the Western Satraps.
In the East, as late as the 3rd century AD, decorated coins of Huvishka were dedicated at Bodh Gaya together with other gold offerings under the &quot;Enlightenment Throne&quot; of the Buddha, suggesting direct Kushan influence in the area during that period. Coins of the Kushans are found in abundance as far as Bengal, and the ancient Bengali state of Samatata issued coins copied from the coinage of Kanishka I, although probably only as a result of commercial influence. Coins in imitation of Kushan coinage have also been found abundantly in the eastern state of Orissa.

In the West, the Kushan state covered the Pārata state of Balochistan, western Pakistan, Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan. Turkmenistan was known for the Kushan Buddhist city of Merv.

Northward, in the 1st century AD, the Kujula Kadphises sent an army to the Tarim Basin to support the city-state of Kucha, which had been resisting the Chinese invasion of the region, but they retreated after minor encounters. In the 2nd century AD, the Kushans under Kanishka made various forays into the Tarim Basin, where they had various contacts with the Chinese. Kanishka held areas of the Tarim Basin apparently corresponding to the ancient regions held by the Yüeh-zhi, the possible ancestors of the Kushan. There was Kushan influence on coinage in Kashgar, Yarkand, and Khotan. According to Chinese chronicles, the Kushans (referred to as Da Yuezhi in Chinese sources) requested, but were denied, a Han princess, even though they had sent presents to the Chinese court. In retaliation, they marched on Ban Chao in AD 90 with a force of 70,000 but were defeated by the smaller Chinese force. Chinese chronicles relate battles between the Kushans and the Chinese general Ban Chao. The Yuezhi retreated and paid tribute to the Chinese Empire. The regions of the Tarim Basin were all ultimately conquered by Ban Chao. Later, during the Yuánchū period (AD 114–120), the Kushans sent a military force to install Chenpan, who had been a hostage among them, as king of Kashgar.

===Kushan fortresses===
Several Kushan fortresses are known, particularly in Bactria, which were often rebuilt on top of Hellenistic fortifications, as in Kampir Tepe. They are often characterised by arrow-shaped loopholes for archers.

== History ==
Kushan rulers are recorded for a period of about three centuries, from circa 30 CE to circa 375 CE, until the invasions of the Kidarites. They ruled around the same time as the Western Satraps, the Satavahanas, and the first Gupta Empire rulers.

=== Kujula Kadphises (c. 25 – c. 85) ===


These conquests by Kujula Kadphises probably took place sometime between AD 45 and 60 and laid the basis for the Kushan Empire which was rapidly expanded by his descendants.

Kujula issued an extensive series of coins and fathered at least two sons, Sadaṣkaṇa (who is known from only two inscriptions, especially the Rabatak inscription, and apparently never ruled), and seemingly Vima Takto.

Kujula Kadphises was the great-grandfather of Kanishka.

===Vima Taktu or Sadashkana (c. 80 – c. 95)===

Vima Takto (Ancient Chinese: 閻膏珍 &quot;Yangaozhen&quot;) is mentioned in the Rabatak inscription (another son, Sadashkana, is mentioned in an inscription of Senavarman, the King of Odi). He was the predecessor of Vima Kadphises, and Kanishka I. He expanded the Kushan Empire into the northwest of South Asia. The Hou Hanshu says:

===Vima Kadphises (c. 95 – c. 127)===

Vima Kadphises (Kushan language: Οοημο Καδφισης) was a Kushan emperor from around AD 95–127, the son of Sadashkana and the grandson of Kujula Kadphises, and the father of Kanishka I, as detailed by the Rabatak inscription.

Vima Kadphises added to the Kushan territory by his conquests in Bactria. He issued an extensive series of coins and inscriptions. He issued gold coins in addition to the existing copper and silver coinage.

===Kanishka I (c. 127 – c. 150)===
The rule of Kanishka the Great, fourth Kushan king, lasted for about 23 years from c. AD 127. Upon his accession, Kanishka ruled a huge territory (virtually all of northern India), south to Ujjain and Kundina and east beyond Pataliputra, according to the Rabatak inscription:
His territory was administered from two capitals: Purushapura (now Peshawar in northwestern Pakistan) and Mathura, in northern India. He is also credited (along with Raja Dab) for building the massive, ancient Fort at Bathinda (Qila Mubarak), in the modern city of Bathinda, Indian Punjab.

The Kushans also had a summer capital in Kapisa (near modern Bagram), where the &quot;Begram Treasure&quot;, comprising works of art from Greece to China, has been found. According to the Rabatak inscription, Kanishka was the son of Vima Kadphises, the grandson of Sadashkana, and the great-grandson of Kujula Kadphises. Kanishka&#x27;s era is now generally accepted to have begun in 127 on the basis of Harry Falk&#x27;s ground-breaking research. Kanishka&#x27;s era was used as a calendar reference by the Kushans for about a century, until the decline of the Kushan realm.

===Huvishka (c. 150 – c. 190)===

Huvishka (Kushan: Οοηϸκι, &quot;Ooishki&quot;) was a Kushan emperor from the death of Kanishka (assumed on the best evidence available to be in 150) until the succession of Vasudeva I about thirty years later. His rule was a period of retrenchment and consolidation for the Empire. In particular he devoted time and effort early in his reign to the exertion of greater control over the city of Mathura.

===Vasudeva I (c. 190 – c. 230)===

Vasudeva I (Kushan: Βαζοδηο &quot;Bazodeo&quot;, Chinese: 波調 &quot;Bodiao&quot;) was the last of the &quot;Great Kushans&quot;. Named inscriptions dating from year 64 to 98 of Kanishka&#x27;s era suggest his reign extended from at least AD 191 to 225. He was the last great Kushan emperor, and the end of his rule coincides with the invasion of the Sasanians as far as northwestern India, and the establishment of the Indo-Sasanians or &quot;Kushanshahs&quot; in what is nowadays Afghanistan, Pakistan and northwestern India from around AD 240.

===Vāsishka (c. 247 – c. 267)===

Vāsishka was a Kushan emperor who seems to have had a 20-year reign following Kanishka II. His rule is recorded at Mathura, in Gandhara and as far south as Sanchi (near Vidisa), where several inscriptions in his name have been found, dated to the year 22 (the Sanchi inscription of &quot;Vaksushana&quot; – i.e., Vasishka Kushana) and year 28 (the Sanchi inscription of Vasaska – i.e., Vasishka) of a possible second Kanishka era.

=== Little Kushans (AD 270 – 350) ===
Following territorial losses in the west (Bactria lost to the Kushano-Sasanians), and in the east (loss of Mathura to the Gupta Empire), several &quot;Little Kushans&quot; are known, who ruled locally in the area of Punjab with their capital at Taxila: Vasudeva II (270 – 300), Mahi (300 – 305), Shaka (305 – 335) and Kipunada (335 – 350). They probably were vassals of the Gupta Empire, until the invasion of the Kidarites destroyed the last remains of Kushan rule.

==Kushan deities==

The Kushan religious pantheon is extremely varied, as revealed by their coins that were made in gold, silver, and copper. These coins contained more than thirty different gods, belonging mainly to their own Iranian, as well as Greek and Indian worlds as well. Kushan coins had images of Kushan Kings, Buddha, and figures from the Indo-Aryan and Iranian pantheons. Greek deities, with Greek names are represented on early coins. During Kanishka&#x27;s reign, the language of the coinage changes to Bactrian (though it remained in Greek script for all kings). After Huvishka, only two divinities appear on the coins: &quot;Ardoxsho&quot; and &quot;Oesho&quot; (see details below).

The Iranian entities depicted on coinage include:
* &quot;Ardoxsho&quot; (Αρδοχþο): Ashi Vanghuhi 
* &quot;Ashaeixsho&quot; (Aþαειχþo, &quot;Best righteousness&quot;): Asha Vahishta 
* &quot;Athsho&quot; (Αθþο, &quot;The Royal fire&quot;): Atar 
* &quot;Pharro&quot; (Φαρρο, &quot;Royal splendour&quot;): Khwarenah 
* &quot;Lrooaspa&quot; (Λροοασπο): Drvaspa 
* &quot;Manaobago&quot; (Μαναοβαγο): Vohu Manah 
* &quot;Mao&quot; (Μαο, the Lunar deity): Mah 
* &quot;Mithro&quot; and variants (Μιθρο, Μιιρο, Μιορο, Μιυρο): Mithra 
* &quot;Mozdooano&quot; (Μοζδοοανο, &quot;Mazda the victorious?&quot;): Mazda *vana 
* &quot;Nana&quot; (Νανα, Ναναια, Ναναϸαο): variations of pan-Asiatic &quot;Nana&quot;, Sogdian &quot;Nny&quot; 
* &quot;Oado&quot; (Οαδο): Vata 
* &quot;Oaxsho&quot; (Oαxþo): &quot;Oxus&quot;
* &quot;Ooromozdo&quot; (Οορομοζδο): Ahura Mazda 
* &quot;Ořlagno&quot; (Οραλαγνο): Verethragna, the Iranian god of war 
* &quot;Rishti&quot; (Ριϸτι, &quot;Uprightness&quot;): Arshtat 
* &quot;Shaoreoro&quot; (Ϸαορηορο, &quot;Best royal power&quot;, Archetypal ruler): Khshathra Vairya 
* &quot;Tiero&quot; (Τιερο): Tir

Representation of entities from Greek mythology and Hellenistic syncretism are:
* &quot;Zaoou&quot; (Ζαοου): Zeus 
* &quot;Ēlios&quot; (Ηλιος): Helios 
* &quot;Ēphaēstos&quot; (Ηφαηστος): Hephaistos
* &quot;Oa nēndo&quot; (Οα νηνδο): Nike 
* &quot;Salēnē&quot; (Ϲαληνη): Selene 
* &quot;Anēmos&quot; (Ανημος): Anemos 
* &quot;Ērakilo&quot; (Ηρακιλο): Heracles 
* &quot;Sarapo&quot; (Ϲαραπο): the Greco-Egyptian god Sarapis 

The Indic entities represented on coinage include:
* &quot;Boddo&quot; (Βοδδο): the Buddha 
* &quot;Shakamano Boddho&quot; (Ϸακαμανο Βοδδο): Shakyamuni Buddha 
* &quot;Metrago Boddo&quot; (Μετραγο Βοδδο): the bodhisattava Maitreya 
* &quot;Maaseno&quot; (Μαασηνο): Mahāsena 
* &quot;Skando-Komaro&quot; (Σκανδο-kομαρο): Skanda-Kumara 
* &quot;Bizago&quot;: Viśākha 
* &quot;Ommo&quot;: Umā, the consort of Siva. 
* &quot;Oesho&quot; (Οηϸο): long considered to represent Indic Shiva, but also identified as Avestan Vayu conflated with Shiva. 
* Two copper coins of Huvishka bear a &quot;Ganesa&quot; legend, but instead of depicting the typical theriomorphic figure of Ganesha, have a figure of an archer holding a full-length bow with string inwards and an arrow. This is typically a depiction of Rudra, but in the case of these two coins is generally assumed to represent Shiva.


==Kushans and Buddhism==

The Kushans inherited the Greco-Buddhist traditions of the Indo-Greek Kingdom they replaced, and their patronage of Buddhist institutions allowed them to grow as a commercial power. Between the mid-1st century and the mid-3rd century, Buddhism, patronised by the Kushans, extended to China and other Asian countries through the Silk Road.

Kanishka is renowned in Buddhist tradition for having convened a great Buddhist council in Kashmir. Along with his predecessors in the region, the Indo-Greek king Menander I (Milinda) and the Indian emperors Ashoka and Harsha Vardhana, Kanishka is considered by Buddhism as one of its greatest benefactors.

During the 1st century AD, Buddhist books were being produced and carried by monks, and their trader patrons. Also, monasteries were being established along these land routes that went from China and other parts of Asia. With the development of Buddhist books, it caused a new written language called Gandhara. Gandhara consists of eastern Afghanistan and northern Pakistan. Scholars are said to have found many Buddhist scrolls that contained the Gandhari language.

The reign of Huvishka corresponds to the first known epigraphic evidence of the Buddha Amitabha, on the bottom part of a 2nd-century statue which has been found in Govindo-Nagar, and now at the Mathura Museum. The statue is dated to &quot;the 28th year of the reign of Huvishka&quot;, and dedicated to &quot;Amitabha Buddha&quot; by a family of merchants. There is also some evidence that Huvishka himself was a follower of Mahayana Buddhism. A Sanskrit manuscript fragment in the Schøyen Collection describes Huvishka as one who has &quot;set forth in the Mahāyāna.&quot;

The 12th century historical chronicle &quot;Rajatarangini&quot; mentions in detail the rule of the Kushan kings and their benevolence towards Buddhism:

==Kushan art==
The art and culture of Gandhara, at the crossroads of the Kushan hegemony, developed the traditions of Greco-Buddhist art and are the best known expressions of Kushan influences to Westerners. Several direct depictions of Kushans are known from Gandhara, where they are represented with a tunic, belt and trousers and play the role of devotees to the Buddha, as well as the Bodhisattva and future Buddha Maitreya.

According to Benjamin Rowland, the first expression of Kushan art appears at Khalchayan at the end of the 2nd century BC. It is derived from Hellenistic art, and possibly from the art of the cities of Ai-Khanoum and Nysa, and clearly has similarities with the later Art of Gandhara, and may even have been at the origin of its development. Rowland particularly draws attention to the similarity of the ethnic types represented at Khalchayan and in the art of Gandhara, and also in the style of portraiture itself. For example, Rowland find a great proximity between the famous head of a Yuezhi prince from Khalchayan, and the head of Gandharan Bodhisattvas, giving the example of the Gandharan head of a Bodhisattva in the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The similarity of the Gandhara Bodhisattva with the portrait of the Kushan ruler Heraios is also striking. According to Rowland the Bactrian art of Khalchayan thus survived for several centuries through its influence in the art of Gandhara, thanks to the patronage of the Kushans.

During the Kushan Empire, many images of Gandhara share a strong resemblance to the features of Greek, Syrian, Persian and Indian figures. These Western-looking stylistic signatures often include heavy drapery and curly hair, representing a composite (the Greeks, for example, often possessed curly hair).

As the Kushans took control of the area of Mathura as well, the Art of Mathura developed considerably, and free-standing statues of the Buddha came to be mass-produced around this time, possibly encouraged by doctrinal changes in Buddhism allowing to depart from the aniconism that had prevailed in the Buddhist sculptures at Mathura, Bharhut or Sanchi from the end of the 2nd century BC. The artistic cultural influence of kushans declined slowly due to Hellenistic Greek and Indian influences.
===Kushan monetary system===
The Kushans used gold ingots as part of their monetary system, as shown by the gold treasure discovered in 1972 in Dalverzin Tepe. The main objects from the treasure were circular and parallelepipedic ingots, followed by various decorative objects and jewellery items. The circular ingots used to be progressively cut up as needed, depending on the amount required for a transaction. On the contrary, the parallelepipedic ingots were used to stock wealth in a not-divisible form; these ingots bear inscriptions in Kharoshthi mentioning their weight and the god Mitra (protector of contractual relations) These ingots are all attributed to the monetary system of the Kushan Empire.

The coinage of the Kushans was abundant and an important tool of propaganda in promoting each Kushan ruler. One of the names for Kushan coins was &quot;Dinara&quot;, which ultimately came from the Roman name &quot;Denarius aureus&quot;. The coinage of the Kushans was copied as far as the Kushano-Sasanians in the west, and the kingdom of Samatata in Bengal to the east. The coinage of the Gupta Empire was also initially derived from the coinage of the Kushan Empire, adopting its weight standard, techniques and designs, following the conquests of Samudragupta in the northwest. The imagery on Gupta coins then became more Indian in both style and subject matter compared to earlier dynasties, where Greco-Roman and Persian styles were mostly followed.

It has long been suggested that the gold contained in Kushan coins was ultimately of Roman origin, and that Roman coins were imported as a consequence of trade and melted in India to mint Kushan coins. However, a recent archaeometallurgical study of trace elements through proton activation analysis has shown that Kushan gold contains high concentrations of platinum and palladium, which rules out the hypothesis of a Roman provenance. To this day, the origin of Kushan gold remains unknown.

==Contacts with Rome==
Several Roman sources describe the visit of ambassadors from the Kings of Bactria and India during the 2nd century, probably referring to the Kushans.

Historia Augusta, speaking of Emperor Hadrian (117–138) tells:


Also in 138, according to Aurelius Victor (&quot;Epitome&quot;‚ XV, 4), and Appian (&quot;Praef.&quot;, 7), Antoninus Pius, successor to Hadrian, received some Indian, Bactrian, and Hyrcanian ambassadors.

Some Kushan coins have an effigy of &quot;Roma&quot;, suggesting a strong level of awareness and some level of diplomatic relations.

The summer capital of the Kushan Empire in Kapisa has yielded a considerable amount of goods imported from the Roman Empire—in particular, various types of glassware. The Chinese described the presence of Roman goods in the Kushan realm:

Parthamaspates of Parthia, a client of Rome and ruler of the kingdom of Osroene, is known to have traded with the Kushan Empire, goods being sent by sea and through the Indus River.

==Contacts with China==
During the 1st and 2nd century AD, the Kushan Empire expanded militarily to the north, putting them at the center of the profitable Central Asian commerce. They are related to have collaborated militarily with the Chinese against nomadic incursion, particularly when they allied with the Han dynasty general Ban Chao against the Sogdians in 84, when the latter were trying to support a revolt by the king of Kashgar. Around 85, they also assisted the Chinese general in an attack on Turpan, east of the Tarim Basin.
In recognition for their support to the Chinese, the Kushans requested a Han princess, but were denied, even after they had sent presents to the Chinese court. In retaliation, they marched on Ban Chao in 86 with a force of 70,000, but were defeated by a smaller Chinese force. The Yuezhi retreated and paid tribute to the Chinese Empire during the reign of emperor He of Han (89–106).

The Kushans are again recorded to have sent presents to the Chinese court in 158–159 during the reign of Emperor Huan of Han.

Following these interactions, cultural exchanges further increased, and Kushan Buddhist missionaries, such as Lokaksema, became active in the Chinese capital cities of Luoyang and sometimes Nanjing, where they particularly distinguished themselves by their translation work. They were the first recorded promoters of Hinayana and Mahayana scriptures in China, greatly contributing to the Silk Road transmission of Buddhism.

==Decline==
===Kushano-Sassanians===
After the death of Vasudeva I in 225, the Kushan empire split into western and eastern halves. The Western Kushans (in Afghanistan) were soon subjugated by the Persian Sasanian Empire and lost Sogdiana, Bactria, and Gandhara to them. The Sassanian king Shapur I (240–270) claims in his Naqsh-e Rostam inscription possession of the territory of the Kushans (Kūšān šahr) as far as Purushapura (modern Peshawar), suggesting he controlled Bactria and areas as far as the Hindu-Kush or even south of it:

This is also confirmed by the Rag-i-Bibi inscription in modern Afghanistan.

The Sasanians deposed the Western dynasty and replaced them with Persian vassals known as the Kushanshas (in Bactrian on their coinage: KΟÞANΟ ÞAΟ &quot;Koshano Shao&quot;) also called Indo-Sasanians or Kushano-Sasanians. The Kushano-Sasanians ultimately became very powerful under Hormizd I Kushanshah (277–286) and rebelled against the Sasanian Empire, while continuing many aspects of the Kushan culture, visible in particular in their titulature and their coinage.

===&quot;Little Kushans&quot; and Gupta suzerainty===

The Eastern Kushan kingdom, also known as the &quot;Little Kushans&quot;, was based in the Punjab. Around 270 their territories on the Gangetic plain became independent under local dynasties such as the Yaudheyas. Then in the mid-4th century they were subjugated by the Gupta Empire under Samudragupta. In his inscription on the Allahabad pillar Samudragupta proclaims that the &quot;Dēvaputra-Shāhi-Shāhānushāhi&quot; (referring to the last Kushan rulers, being a deformation of the Kushan regnal titles &quot;Devaputra&quot;, &quot;Shao&quot; and &quot;Shaonanoshao&quot;: &quot;Son of God, King, King of Kings&quot;) are now under his dominion, and that they were forced to &quot;self-surrender, offering (their own) daughters in marriage and a request for the administration of their own districts and provinces&quot;. This suggests that by the time of the Allahabad inscription the Kushans still ruled in Punjab, but under the suzerainty of the Gupta Emperor.

Numimastics indicate that the coinage of the Eastern Kushans was much weakened: silver coinage was abandoned altogether, and gold coinage was debased. This suggests that the Eastern Kushans had lost their central trading role on the trade routes that supplied luxury goods and gold. Still, the Buddhist art of Gandhara continued to flourish, and cities such as Sirsukh near Taxila were established.

===Sasanian, Kidarite and Alchon invasions===

In the east around 350, Shapur II regained the upper hand against the Kushano-Sasanian Kingdom and took control of large territories in areas now known as Afghanistan and Pakistan, possibly as a consequence of the destruction of the Kushano-Sasanians by the Chionites. The Kushano-Sasanian still ruled in the north. Important finds of Sasanian coinage beyond the Indus River in the city of Taxila only start with the reigns of Shapur II (r.309-379) and Shapur III (r.383-388), suggesting that the expansion of Sasanian control beyond the Indus was the result of the wars of Shapur II &quot;with the Chionites and Kushans&quot; in 350-358 as described by Ammianus Marcellinus. They probably maintained control until the rise of the Kidarites under their ruler Kidara.

In 360 a Kidarite Hun named Kidara overthrew the Kushano-Sasanians and remnants of the old Kushan dynasty, and established the Kidarite Kingdom. The Kushan style of Kidarite coins indicates they claimed Kushan heritage. The Kidarite seem to have been rather prosperous, although on a smaller scale than their Kushan predecessors. East of the Punjab, the former eastern territories of the Kushans were controlled by the mighty Gupta Empire.

The remnants of Kushan culture under the Kidarites in the northwest were ultimately wiped out in the end of the 5th century by the invasions of the Alchon Huns (sometimes considered as a branch of the Hephthalites), and later the Nezak Huns.

<text>Remagen () is a town in Germany in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, in the district of Ahrweiler. It is about a one-hour drive from Cologne, just south of Bonn, the former West German seat of government. It is situated on the left (western) bank of the river Rhine. There is a ferry across the Rhine from Remagen every 10–15 minutes in the summer. Remagen has many notable and well-maintained buildings, churches, castles and monuments. It also has a sizeable pedestrian zone with plenty of shops.

Overlooking the west bank of the Rhine just north of the city centre is the Apollinariskirche. It has an observation deck that is only open to parishioners on Sundays. Pedestrians reach the church via a dirt trail that passes a series of roadside monuments representing each of the fourteen Stations of the Cross. The church grounds contain an outdoor crypt and an abbey. Further down the river is one of the many castles along the Rhine, perched even higher than the Apollinariskirche.

==History==
The Roman Empire built a border fort at Rigomagus (or Ricomagus), west of the Rhine. This was about 12 miles north of the site of the first bridge ever built across the Rhine (at Neuwied). This bridge fought the river current by being built on timbers which were driven into the bed at a slant. Caesar&#x27;s troops spent nearly three weeks on the east side of the river, then crossed back over, destroying the bridge to prevent its use by German raiders. A second bridge was likewise destroyed by the builders once they were through with it.

The fort was one of a series built by Drusus, commander of the Roman army along the Rhine. Other Roman construction survived the centuries, including a gateway and Remagen became a tourist destination, popular with history buffs. Remagen appears on the 4th century Peutinger Map.

Local legend says that a ship carrying various relics from Milan to Cologne was stopped in the river in 1164, unable to move despite the strong current, until it mysteriously edged in toward the shore. The remains of Saint Apollinaris were put ashore, and the ship was then able to sail onward. These remains were interred in a chapel which had been part of the Roman fort, which became the basis for a church which bore his name, and was rebuilt several times over the years.

===Bridge at Remagen===

The Ludendorff Bridge was originally built during World War I as a means of moving troops and logistics west over the Rhine to reinforce the Western Front. The bridge was designed by Karl Wiener, an architect from Mannheim. It was long, had a clearance of above the normal water level of the Rhine, and its highest point measured . The bridge was designed to be defended by troops with towers on each bank with machine gun slits in the towers. The bridge carried two railway tracks and a pedestrian walkway. During World War II, one track was planked over to allow vehicular traffic.

===Capture of the bridge===
During Operation Lumberjack, on 7 March 1945, troops of the U.S. Army&#x27;s 9th Armored Division reached the Ludendorff Bridge during the closing weeks of World War II and were very surprised to see that the railroad bridge was still standing. German defenders had failed to demolish it, leaving it the only one of the 22 road and railroad bridges over the Rhine still standing. U.S. forces were able to capture the bridge. The unexpected availability of the first major crossing of the Rhine, Germany&#x27;s last major natural barrier and line of defense, caused Allied high commander Dwight Eisenhower to alter his plans to end the war and may have shortened the war in Europe.

The ability to quickly establish a bridgehead on the eastern side of the Rhine and to get forces into the bulk of Germany allowed the U.S. forces to envelop the German industrial area of the Ruhr more quickly than planned. The Allies were able to get six divisions across the bridge before it collapsed on 17 March 1945, ten days after it was captured. The collapse killed 18 U.S. Army Engineers. According to another source, a total of 28 U.S. engineers were killed and 93 were injured.
However, a pontoon bridge had by then been built across the river and the main bridge was out of use for repairs at the time of its collapse.

A large number of books and articles in newspapers and magazines on the battle for the bridge have been published. The best-known work on the battle is 1957&#x27;s &quot;The Bridge at Remagen&quot; by the American author Ken Hechler. In 1968 David L. Wolper produced an American motion picture, &quot;The Bridge at Remagen&quot;. The film depicts historical events, but is fictional in all other aspects.

===Memorial===

Hans Peter Kürten, at that time (1968) Mayor of Remagen, had long considered the idea of constructing a memorial. The negotiations with the German Federal Railways alone lasted seven years before the city could finally acquire the former railway property. Announcements sent to government officials concerning the intended preservation of the bridge towers and the construction of a Memorial to Peace stirred no interest.

In the summer of 1976, it was necessary to remove the still intact bridge support pilings in the river. The mayor had the stones deposited on the Remagen river bank, with the idea in mind of selling small pieces of the bridge stones enclosed in synthetic resin and containing a certificate of authenticity.

On 7 March 1978, he went public with his idea and achieved such an unexpected degree of success, that he had realised more than 100,000 DM (around 50,000 EUR) in sales profits.

There has not been another bridge built across the Rhine here, mainly due to opposition from the people of Remagen (and surrounding areas), contending that a bridge located at this point along the Rhine would spoil the view.

=== Prisoner enclosures ===

In 1945, the U.S. built one of the many enclosures on the west bank of the Rhine—the so-called Rheinwiesenlager—close to Remagen. The camps were used by the Allies to house captured German soldiers. Several thousand prisoners are estimated to have died in the various camps, including 1,212 who are now buried in the Bad Bodendorf Cemetery.

==Geography==

=== City outline===
Remagen is divided into six districts (Ortsbezirk) and eight localities (Ortsteile):


The district of Kripp also belongs to the district of Remagen.

==Sites==
===Apollinariskirche===

The Apollinaris Church was built 1839-1842 on the site of the medieval Church of St. Martin. The frescos on the inside of the neo-Gothic church were painted by members of the artists group called the &quot;Nazarenes&quot;. Three cycles show the life of Jesus, the life of Mary, and the history of Saint Apollinaris, legendary Bishop of Ravenna. In the crypt is a silver bust of the saint, which is raised from the sarcophagus every year at the pilgrimage time at the end of July. From the statue of Saint Francis of Assisi on top of the church, there is a lovely view of Remagen and the romantic Lower Rhine Valley.

===Peace Museum &quot;Remagen Bridge&quot;===

The museum is housed in the towers of the famous bridge built between 1916 and 1918. It opened in 1980 and tells the story of the bridge and the US prisoner of war camp known as the Golden Mile, on the eponymous plain.

===Arp Museum housed in the Bahnhof Rolandseck===
The historic railway station at Rolandseck about 5 km north of Remagen, now houses a museum devoted to the work of Hans Arp. The 19th century railway station - itself a classic example of early German railway architecture - was transformed into a cultural venue for all the arts in the 19th century. Johannes Brahms, Clara Schumann and Franz Liszt gave concerts there. George Bernard Shaw staged his plays there. The young poet Guillaume Apollinaire even fell in love there. Neglected, the building was listed for demolition after World War II, but in 1964 the Bonn art dealer Johannes Wasmuth brought it back to life. Musicians such as Martha Argerich, Stefan Askenase, and Yehudi Menuhin, artists such as Hans Arp, Oskar Kokoschka and Günther Uecker, and performers such as Marcel Marceau have all appeared there.

==Infrastructure==
Remagen station is on the Left Rhine line and the Ahr Valley Railway. It is served by InterCity, Regional-Express (the &quot;Rhein-Express&quot;, at hourly intervals) and Regionalbahn services (&quot;MittelrheinBahn&quot;, at hourly intervals) operating between Cologne and Koblenz. It is also served by &quot;Rhein-Ahr-Bahn&quot; services on the Ahr Valley Railway to Ahrbrück at hourly intervals.

<text>The National Aquarium – also known as National Aquarium in Baltimore and formerly known as Baltimore Aquarium – is a non-profit public aquarium located at 501 East Pratt Street on Pier 3 in the Inner Harbor area of downtown Baltimore, Maryland in the United States. Constructed during a period of urban renewal in Baltimore, the aquarium opened on August 8, 1981. The aquarium has an annual attendance of 1.5 million visitors and is the largest tourism attraction in the State of Maryland. The aquarium holds more than of water, and has more than 17,000 specimens representing over 750 species. The National Aquarium&#x27;s mission is to inspire conservation of the world&#x27;s aquatic treasures. The aquarium&#x27;s stated vision is to confront pressing issues facing global aquatic habitats through pioneering science, conservation, and educational programming.

The National Aquarium houses several exhibits including the Upland Tropical Rain Forest, a multiple-story Atlantic Coral Reef, an open-ocean shark tank, and Australia: Wild Extremes, which won the &quot;Best Exhibit&quot; award from the Association of Zoos and Aquariums in 2008. The aquarium also has a &quot;4D Immersion Theater.&quot; The aquarium opened a marine mammal pavilion on the adjacent south end of Pier 4 in 1990, and currently holds six Atlantic bottlenose dolphins. Of the six, five were born at the National Aquarium, one was born at another American aquarium.

In 2003, the National Aquarium and the much older and independent National Aquarium in Washington, D.C., formed an alliance to operate as a single National Aquarium with two sites. This arrangement continued until 2013, when the Washington location closed permanently.

==History==
The aquarium began in the mid-1970s when then-Mayor William Donald Schaefer, (1921–2011), and the Commissioner of the city Department of Housing and Community Development, Robert C. Embry, inspired by a visit to the two-decade old New England Aquarium on the waterfront of Boston, Massachusetts, conceived and championed the idea of an aquarium as a vital component of Baltimore&#x27;s overall downtown and Inner Harbor redevelopment scheme. In 1976, Baltimore City residents supported the idea of an aquarium by voting for it on a bond loan referendum, and the groundbreaking for the facility took place on old Pier 3 facing East Pratt Street, just east of the newly completed World Trade Center in the city&#x27;s Inner Harbor on August 8, 1978.

Although no federal funds were used for its construction, the United States Congress later designated the facility as the &quot;national aquarium&quot; in 1979. The aquarium opened to the public on August 8, 1981, after three years of construction, and one year after the booming &quot;festival marketplace&quot; of the two Harborplace shopping pavilions further west conceived by nationally famous, local developer James Rouse.

The National Aquarium, Baltimore&#x27;s initial conceptual design, architecture and exhibit design was led by Peter Chermayeff of Peter Chermayeff LLC while he was at Cambridge Seven Associates.

The conceptual, architectural, and exhibit design for the Glass Pavilion expansion was led by Bobby C. Poole while at Chermayeff, Sollogub &amp; Poole. After two decades, construction began on the Glass Pavilion north extension on September 5, 2002, and it opened to the public on December 16, 2005. It measures , and is high at the tallest point.

==Conservation, research, and green practices==
The National Aquarium was selected as the National Wildlife Federation&#x27;s Maryland affiliate in 2011. The aquarium conducts conservation efforts through events to clean up the Chesapeake Bay Wetlands, and the aquarium&#x27;s Marine Animal Rescue Program (MARP), which rescues, rehabilitates, and releases marine mammals. MARP has successfully rescued, treated, and returned seals, dolphins, porpoises, pilot whales, pygmy sperm whales, sea turtles, and a manatee to their natural habitats.

The National Aquarium Conservation Center (est. 2009) leads the aquarium&#x27;s research efforts in resolving critical issues currently impacting coastal ecosystems and watersheds, ocean health, ecological aquaculture, and informs issues of environmental policy and advocacy through conservation research focused on aquatic ecosystems. Some of the center&#x27;s projects include &quot;The Chesapeake Bay Initiative&quot;, tracking mercury levels through the food chain in wild and captive bottlenose dolphins, and assessing chronic natural resource damages from the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.

In 2011, The National Aquarium was honored with the Maryland Green Registry Leadership Award, as an organization that shows “a strong commitment to sustainable practices, measurable results, and continuous improvement” and was recognized by the Baltimore Business Journal and Smart CEO Magazine for exceptional green business practices in 2009.

A 4.3 MW solar farm in Cambridge supplies about 40% of the power for the National Aquarium, and saves about 1,300 metric tons of carbon dioxide during the summer. Energy efficiency upgrades in 2015 saved an additional 3,200 tons of CO2 over the summer.

==Exhibits==
===Pier 3 Pavilion===
This building contains five levels or floors that are accessible via escalator and elevator except to guests with strollers. Guests with toddlers must carry them on their person. Each floor possesses several exhibits that communicate a main theme. This building also houses two large tanks, one of which simulates an Atlantic coral reef, and one of which simulates the open ocean.

====Level 1: Blacktip Reef====
The Central Tray, as it was originally know, has gone through many iterations since the original building opened in 1981. Originally, it was a marine mammal exhibit that had bottlenose dolphins collected from the Gulf of Mexico and eventually, California Sea Lions and beluga whales, but when Pier 4 opened, the animals were moved there. Subsequently, that area became an exhibit called Wings in the Water – which included several species of stingray until 2013, when it became Blacktip Reef. For 30 years, the tray remained the same - a bare concrete bottom, painted a light blue color. The &#x27;pit&#x27; was temporarily covered for a time in 2008-9 after that section of the exhibit began to deteriorate. The exhibit was then lined with sand to disguise the &#x27;pit&#x27; cover. While aesthetically pleasing, the weight of the sand ended up causing the collapse of the cover itself and was then removed. Originally, the bump out window was obviously not present and the underwater viewing area was quite dark. The viewing windows were the same shape and size as the two windows flanking either side of the bump out window today. Above, the guest pathways were the same, minus the glass siding. On the exit side of Blacktip Reef, an entire guest walkway was cut back considerably to create the sandbar section of the exhibit. Also removed was a cylindrical tank which held numerous exhibits over the years.

Renovations to the tray were needed for years even before Blacktip Reef was even conceived. Originally, it was to be renovated and turned back into the same stingray exhibit, but soon evolved into what the Aquarium has today. This habitat, replicating an Indo-Pacific reef landscape (living corals are exhibited elsewhere in the National Aquarium), can be seen from many vantage points, including a new floor-to-ceiling pop-out viewing window. It contains 69 species of fish including blacktip reef sharks, emperor angelfish, harlequin tuskfish, humphead wrasse, reticulate whipray, blotched fantail ray, spotted unicornfish, tasselled wobbegong and zebra shark. One of the largest animals in the exhibit was Calypso, a 500-pound green sea turtle that was rescued off the shore of Long Island in 2000. Her left front flipper had become infected and required amputation in order to save her life. Calypso was introduced to the exhibit in 2002 and died on February 3, 2020.

In October 2020, the National Aquarium announced its acquisition of another green sea turtle, Kai, who had suffered injuries in a collision with a boat that left her unable to dive for food. Kai had been rescued in 2018 and treated at the South Carolina Aquarium, from which she was later transferred to the Animal Care and Rescue Center at the National Aquarium for long-term physical rehabilitation.

====Level 2: Maryland: Mountains to the Sea====
This level features animals that are native to Maryland. The four exhibits create the illusion that the viewer is traveling down a Maryland stream from its source in the Allegheny Mountains, to a tidal marsh, to a coastal beach, and finally ending at the Atlantic shelf. Featured animals include wood turtle, American bullfrog, and rosyside dace in the Allegheny Stream, diamondback terrapin, striped blenny, and sheepshead minnow in the Tidal Marsh, striped burrfish and lookdown in the Coastal Beach, and clearnose skate and summer flounder in the Atlantic Shelf exhibit.

====Level 3: Surviving Through Adaptation, Living Seashore====

This level features fish that possess adaptations that are needed to survive in their various environments. For example, the electric eel has the rare ability to shock its prey with electricity and the peacock mantis shrimp uses its strong claws to punch its predators. Featured animals include electric eel, lined seahorse, longnose gar, peacock mantis shrimp and Spotfin butterflyfish.

Living Seashore is a exhibit on the atlantic seashore featuring two touch pools and a variety of hands-on experiences, giving guests the opportunity to explore the ever-changing Mid-Atlantic shoreline. Animals guests can interact with include little skate, Atlantic stingray, Atlantic horseshoe crab, knobbed whelk, and moon jelly.

====Level 4: North Atlantic to the Pacific, Amazon River Forest====
This level displays several aquatic habitats, including a sea cliffs exhibit, which houses seabirds like Atlantic puffins and black guillemots; a Pacific coral reef exhibit housing Bangaii cardinalfish, percula clownfish and yellow tangs; a kelp forest exhibit with garibaldis, horn shark and several types of starfish; and an Amazon River forest exhibit, in which animals can be seen down in the water and up in the overlying foliage. The exhibit replaced a former touch tank and children’s zone known as Children’s Cove which housed several species of invertebrates from the Pacific Ocean. Animals housed in the Amazon River Forest include reptiles like Arrau turtles, emerald tree boas, smooth-fronted caimans, amphibians such as the giant waxy monkey frog and several types of fish like the blue discus, silver arowana and white-blotched river stingray.

====Level 5: Upland Tropical Rain Forest, Hidden Life====

Formerly known as The South American Rainforest, this level simulates the Amazon rainforest, and includes two elevated platforms for bird-watching and a cave of various glass-enclosed displays of reptiles and amphibians. 
Featured animals include:
*Golden lion tamarin 
*Scarlet ibis 
*Sunbittern 
*Yellow-headed amazon parrot 
*Blue-crowned motmot 
*Turquoise tanager
*Blue poison dart frog 
*Yellow-footed tortoise
*Linnaeus&#x27;s two-toed sloth

====Atlantic Coral Reef====
This large exhibit replicates the Atlantic coral reef, and is filled with more than 100 exotic species that would be found anywhere from closer to shore to out into the trench and open ocean, including a green moray eel, queen triggerfish, black grouper, blacknose shark, southern stingray, Atlantic tarpon, spotfin butterflyfish, spot-fin porcupinefish, and a Kemp&#x27;s ridley sea turtle. Originally the exhibit had several species of other animals like spotted eagle ray, barracuda, and a hawksbill sea turtle.

====Shark Alley: Atlantic Predators====
Originally Known as The Open Ocean, this large, , ring shaped exhibit originally called open ocean replicates the deeper portions of the Atlantic coral reef, and is filled with larger reef animals such as roughtail stingray, sandbar shark, sand tiger shark, nurse shark, crevalle jack and largetooth sawfish. This exhibit formerly held lemon shark and several species of gamefish and rays.

===Pier 4 Pavilion===
This smaller building, opened in December 1990, features the marine mammal exhibit, which is home to Atlantic bottlenose dolphins in a facility. It also holds a temporary exhibit on assorted jellyfish called &quot;Jellies Invasion: Oceans Out of Balance&quot;.

====Dolphin Discovery====
This exhibit currently houses the aquarium&#x27;s six bottlenose dolphins. Guests can watch training, feeding, and play times with the dolphins and interact with dolphin experts.

The dolphin colony consists of two males (Foster, Beau) and four females (Spirit, Chesapeake, Bayley, Jade), the youngest being Bayley, who was born in 2008. Chesapeake was the first dolphin born at the aquarium in 1992 and is the oldest of the colony.

In June 2016, the National Aquarium announced plans to construct a sanctuary in Florida or the Caribbean for its colony of bottlenose dolphins. The new sanctuary would be roughly between 50 and 100 times the size of the current dolphin exhibit. &quot;The sanctuary would be the first of its kind in North America and will provide the dolphins with a protected, seaside habitat, creating a new option for how dolphins can thrive in human care,” according to the Aquarium&#x27;s website. As of late 2023, the Aquarium had narrowed down potential locations for the sanctuary to either the U.S. Virgin Islands or Puerto Rico, and planned to relocate the dolphins there by 2026.

====Jellies Invasion: Oceans Out of Balance====
Opened in 2009, this temporary exhibit in the Pier 4 Pavilion building showcases nine different species of jellyfish, and also illustrates how these animals are important bioindicators, which means that they are sensitive to changes within their environment, and therefore, serve as an early warning sign that changes are occurring within an ecosystem, whether from pollution, invasive species, climate change, or other factors.

Featured animals Include:
*Atlantic sea nettle
*Bay nettle
*Flower hat jelly
*Pacific sea nettle
*Purple-striped jelly 
*Lion&#x27;s mane jellyfish 
*Blue blubber jellyfish
*Upside-down jellyfish

====Proposed master plan====
In 2016, architect Jeanne Gang made a proposal to the National Aquarium to transform Pier 4 into a Chesapeake Bay themed exhibit to replace the Jellyfish and Dolphin exhibits. Even though details are sparse about this potential initiative, the new exhibits would include a waterfall, watershed, Lily pond, salt marsh, freshwater tidal, river and an open bay exhibit. Other parts of this plan include the creation of a &quot;wetland&quot; in between the two buildings and the transformation of Pier 3 into a collection of &quot;hope spots&quot; bringing the aquarium to of space in total.

===Australia: Wild Extremes (Glass Pavilion)===

Like the Upland Tropical Rain Forest exhibit, this exhibit is structured like a large walk-in aviary, and allows many of the flying animals to roam freely throughout the exhibit. The exhibit represents a river gorge in Australia, and contains many pools in which Australian aquatic life can be found. It is designed to show the wild extremes faced by this particular part of Australia: fire, drought and flood. Guests can see more than 1,800 individual native animals including freshwater crocodiles, turtles, free-flying birds, snakes, and lizards.

The Aquarium completed the renovation and a multimillion-dollar expansion on December 16, 2005; the expanded portion is . The exterior of the expansion features an interactive area designed to teach visitors about bayscaping, bird-box building, the National Aquarium&#x27;s nationally recognized Marine Animal Rescue Program, water quality testing, marine debris issues and wetland restoration.

Inside the expanded portion of the Aquarium, directly in the main entrance, is a waterfall that was modeled from an actual waterfall in a Maryland state park. The prominent display is also visible from outside the Aquarium. Also inside the expanded portion is a recreation of an Australian habitat. The Umbrawarra Gorge of Australia is carefully depicted inside the upper portion of the expanded building, and the exhibit depicts lands of fire, drought, and flood. Aboriginal artwork, based on actual work discovered in Australia, is also found in the gorge exhibit. These images depict aboriginal interpretations of the land that they live on.

Featured animals include:
*Laughing kookaburra
*Rainbow lorikeet
*Broad-shelled river turtle 
*Irwin&#x27;s turtle
*Kimberley long-necked turtle
*Pig-nosed turtle
*Northern death adder 
*Spiny-tailed monitor 
*Freshwater crocodile
*Australian lungfish 
*Mouth almighty
*Common archerfish
*Barramundi

==Relationship with the National Aquarium, Washington, D.C.==
The National Aquarium in Washington, D.C., was a separate aquarium housed in the lower level of the United States Department of Commerce Building, renamed the Herbert C. Hoover Building in 1981. Founded in 1873, it originally was distinct from the later National Aquarium in Baltimore, opened 108 years later and to the northeast of Washington. On September 4, 2003, the National Aquarium Society and the Board of Governors for the National Aquarium in Baltimore announced an alliance, in which the National Aquarium in Baltimore would operate the Washington, D.C., aquarium as well. The two aquariums became a single organizational entity known as the National Aquarium with two venues. A signing ceremony formally recognizing the alliance hosted by United States Secretary of Commerce Donald Evans took place at the Herbert C. Hoover Building. However, after only ten years of joint operations, the National Aquarium in Washington permananently closed its doors on September 30, 2013, after 128 years in operation – the first time it had closed since its opening in 1885 – to make room for physical renovations of Herbert C. Hoover Building. Approximately 1,700 animals from the Washington location&#x27;s collection were moved north to the National Aquarium in Baltimore.

==Funding and staffing==

The National Aquarium is a public, nonprofit aquarium. The aquarium building and the land upon which it is built are owned by the City of Baltimore, but the aquarium is managed by the non-profit National Aquarium, Inc. which consists of a volunteer 25-member Board of Governors and larger Advisory Board, plus a full-time paid staff. The National Aquarium is run by CEO John Racanelli, who came into the position on June 20, 2011.

Under the terms of its management agreement with the City, the non-profit corporation strives to remain self-supporting for operations. Details regarding funding, staffing, and programming are made available to the public within each year&#x27;s annual report downloadable on the National Aquarium Institute&#x27;s website.

==Recognition and awards==
In 2012, the National Aquarium was named one of the best aquariums in the United States by the Travel Channel and also received the popular vote as one of the top five best aquariums to visit by the website 10best.com. &quot;Coastal Living&quot; magazine named the National Aquarium the #1 aquarium in the United States in 2009. In November 2006, the National Aquarium won a Best of Baltimore award from the &quot;Baltimore City Paper&quot; as the &quot;Best Over Priced Destination for Families.&quot; In September 2011, the &quot;City Paper&quot; Reader&#x27;s Poll awarded the National Aquarium with the title of &quot;Best Attraction&quot; and the &quot;Best Place to Take Kids&quot;.

<text>Bastyr University is a private alternative medicine university with campuses in Kenmore, Washington, and San Diego, California. Programs include naturopathy, acupuncture, Traditional Asian medicine, nutrition, herbal medicine, ayurvedic medicine, psychology, and midwifery.

Some of Bastyr&#x27;s programs teach and research topics that are considered pseudoscience, quackery, and fake by the scientific and medical communities. Quackwatch, a group against health fraud, put Bastyr University on its list of &quot;questionable organizations&quot; as a school which is &quot;accredited but not recommended&quot;.

Bastyr University and similar naturopathic programs are not accredited as medical schools but as programs that are overseen by a naturopathic council which is not required to be scientific. Bastyr&#x27;s naturopathic program has been accused by critics of misrepresenting its medical rigor and its ability to train primary care clinicians.

A 2024 report found that students in Bastyr&#x27;s alternative medicine doctoral program had the second highest debt-to-income ratio among all US graduate programs, at 688%.

==History==
Bastyr University was established in 1978 as the John Bastyr College of Naturopathic Medicine in Seattle. Four co-founders, Sheila Quinn, Joseph Pizzorno, Les Griffith, and Bill Mitchell, named the institution after John Bastyr, a teacher and advocate of naturopathy in the Seattle area. Baccalaureate, master&#x27;s, and doctoral degree programs are offered. In 1984, the school was renamed Bastyr College; in 1994, it became Bastyr University.

In 1996, Bastyr relocated to its current location in the Saint Thomas Center, formerly St. Edward Seminary, a Catholic seminary building in Kenmore, Washington. Pizzorno served as president until his retirement in June 2000. During his tenure, Bastyr became the first accredited university of natural medicine and the first center for alternative medicine research funded by the National Institutes of Health&#x27;s Office of Alternative Medicine, the predecessor to the controversial National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health.

Its campus is surrounded by Saint Edward State Park&#x27;s fir and hemlock forest. In November, 2005, the university purchased the property, which it had been leasing from the Archdiocese of Seattle. In 2010, Bastyr merged with Seattle Midwifery School to offer a Master of Science degree to become a direct-entry midwife eligible for certification.

In 2024, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported that students who pursued doctorates of naturopathic medicine typically took on high levels of debt. For Bastyr, the median loan was $300,530 and the median earnings were $43,703, resulting in a debt to earnings ratio of 688%. This was the second highest ratio among graduate programs in the US, with only the naturopathic program at National University of Natural Medicine being higher.

==Academics==

Bastyr offers bachelor&#x27;s completion, master&#x27;s, combined undergraduate/masters, doctoral, and certificate programs. Average first-year cost (tuition, fees, and books) not including room and board for undergraduate programs is $26,523, and for the doctorate in naturopathic medicine is $39,589. Bastyr presents itself as the &quot;Harvard of naturopathic medicine.&quot; The Princeton Review reports that the naturopathic medicine program at Bastyr had an acceptance rate of 68%.

===Accreditation===
Bastyr University is accredited by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU) as an institution that can grant undergraduate and postgraduate degrees. Bastyr&#x27;s Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine program is accredited by the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME), which is a naturopathic organization affiliated with the naturopathic profession. The Master of Science in Acupuncture (MSA), the Master of Science in Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (MSAOM), and the Doctor of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (DAOM) are accredited by the Accreditation Commission for Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine (ACAHM).

The Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics, the accrediting agency for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, has accredited Bastyr&#x27;s Bachelor of Science with a major in nutrition with Didactic Program in Dietetics, Master of Science in nutrition with Didactic Program in Dietetics, and Dietetic Internship.

Bastyr University has received approval from the state of Washington as a recognized midwifery training facility and provides education for midwifery students in the articulated Bachelor/Master of Science in Midwifery degree. Both programs are accredited through the Midwifery Education Accreditation Council.

The university is a member of the American Association of Naturopathic Medical Colleges and Council of Colleges of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine.

===Reception===

The Bastyr curriculum has been criticized for teaching pseudoscience and quackery, as its courses in homeopathy, herbalism, acupuncture, and ayurvedic methods lack a compelling evidence basis. Clinical training in the naturopathic medicine program was revealed to be significantly fewer hours than what Bastyr claims to provide its students, focusing on dubious diagnostics to prescribe experimental and pseudoscientific treatments that do not adhere to medical standards of care. Research conducted at Bastyr has been criticized as being a waste of taxpayer dollars by studying implausible treatments inconsistent with the best understandings of science and medicine.

The former president of Bastyr, Joseph Pizzorno, has been criticized for promoting dangerous and ineffective naturopathic treatments. Pizzorno co-authored the &quot;Textbook of Natural Medicine&quot;, which includes recommendations to treat diseases ranging from acne to AIDS using combinations of vitamins, minerals, and herbs at doses that would cause toxicity. Pizzorno is an advocate of the discredited blood type diet, developed by fellow naturopath and Bastyr graduate Peter D&#x27;Adamo. Pizzorno called the diet &quot;the medical breakthrough of the ages&quot; and described D&#x27;Adamo as &quot;the best Bastyr has to offer. The consensus among dietitians, physicians, and scientists is that blood type diets are unsupported by scientific evidence.

Naturopaths trained at Bastyr are required to study various non-medical folk remedies, including homeopathy. David Gorski has been highly critical of this requirement; for him this makes the university fail the &quot;litmus test&quot; of whether it adheres to &quot;science and reality&quot;. In 1998, Bastyr offered an elective course in iridology, a debunked system of diagnosing medical conditions by looking for irregularities in the pigmentation of the iris.

In 2007, Bastyr University was found by the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) to have violated the standards of academic freedom and shared governance for faculty members who were fired without cause of academic due process. Bastyr was placed on the AAUP censure list for violating generally recognized principles of academic freedom and tenure, but that censure was removed in June 2021.

==Main campus==
Bastyr&#x27;s main campus sits on 51 acres (20.5 ha) of forests and athletic fields near Lake Washington. The Saint Edward State Park forest surrounds it on three sides. Housing facilities include a student village of 11 cottage-style buildings designed to blend into the campus&#x27;s natural setting and built to Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) platinum specifications.

The campus includes a renovated chapel, originally built in the 1950s for the St. Edward Seminary, which is now rented for musical performances, weddings, and other events. The chapel is known for its acoustical quality and architectural details, which include stained-glass windows, mosaics, and a box-beam ceiling. Scores for films including &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot;, &quot;About Schmidt&quot;, &quot;Mr. Holland&#x27;s Opus&quot;, and &quot;Mirror Mirror&quot; and for video games have been recorded in the chapel. Dave Matthews used it to record the orchestral track for one of his albums; his wife, Ashley Harper, is a naturopathic doctor who received her degree from Bastyr.

Seattle chef Jim Watkins became director of food services in 2011 and introduced meat dishes to the previously strictly vegetarian menu.

Bastyr operates a naturopathic teaching clinic in the Wallingford neighborhood of Seattle, where they offer consultations to the public.

==California campus==
In September 2012, Bastyr University California opened in a two-story commercial building in San Diego with a small teaching clinic on the ground floor. The program offers the doctor of naturopathic medicine program The first students were expected to graduate in spring 2016.

==Research==
The Tierney Basic Sciences Research Laboratory was the first research laboratory at a natural health university when it opened in 2000. One study, run jointly with Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, was funded by a $3.1 million grant awarded in 2010 from the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), part of the National Institutes of Health.

Despite receiving research funds from NCCAM, Bastyr has been criticized for studying topics that are implausible or impossible for medical effectiveness, which are considered a waste of precious federal research funds. A paranormal study funded by NCCAM and conducted at Bastyr investigated extrasensory perception and &quot;distance healing&quot; of HIV/AIDS patients by psychic methods. Bastyr&#x27;s study was based on earlier work on the topic by Elisabeth Targ, which has been marked as scientific fraud. An unidentified member of the NCCAM office described another of Bastyr&#x27;s AIDS research projects – in which people with AIDS were surveyed as to what alternative therapies they were trying and how effective they were – as a &quot;million-dollar fishing expedition.&quot;

Other pseudoscientific topics researched as Bastyr include homeopathy, energy medicine, and remote viewing. These topics are disproved by numerous rigorous investigations that preceded the studies conducted at Bastyr and have been criticized as serving only to justify NCCAM&#x27;s continued existence.

==Notable alumni==
*Peter J. D&#x27;Adamo, a proponent of dangerous fad diets, and member of Bastyr University&#x27;s first graduating naturopathic class.
*Britt Marie Hermes, a 2011 graduate of the doctorate of naturopathic medicine program who went on to practice for three years in Washington and Arizona before becoming an outspoken critic of homeopathy and naturopathic medicine.

<text>Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB, from the French Temps Dynamique Barycentrique) is a relativistic coordinate time scale, intended for astronomical use as a time standard to take account of time dilation when calculating orbits and astronomical ephemerides of planets, asteroids, comets and interplanetary spacecraft in the Solar System. TDB is now (since 2006) defined as a linear scaling of Barycentric Coordinate Time (TCB). A feature that distinguishes TDB from TCB is that TDB, when observed from the Earth&#x27;s surface, has a difference from Terrestrial Time (TT) that is about as small as can be practically arranged with consistent definition: the differences are mainly periodic, and overall will remain at less than 2 milliseconds for several millennia.

TDB applies to the Solar-System-barycentric reference frame, and was first defined in 1976 as a successor to the (non-relativistic) former standard of ephemeris time (adopted by the IAU in 1952 and superseded 1976). In 2006, after a history of multiple time-scale definitions and deprecations since the 1970s, a redefinition of TDB was approved by the IAU. The 2006 IAU redefinition of TDB as an international standard expressly acknowledged that the long-established JPL ephemeris time argument Teph, as implemented in JPL Development Ephemeris DE405, &quot;is for practical purposes the same as TDB defined in this Resolution&quot;. (By 2006, ephemeris DE405 had already been in use for a few years as the official basis for planetary and lunar ephemerides in the Astronomical Almanac; it was the basis for editions for 2003 through 2014; in the edition for 2015 it was superseded by DE430.)

==Definition==

IAU resolution 3 of 2006 defines TDB as a linear transformation of TCB. TCB diverges from both TDB and TT. TCB progresses faster at a differential rate of about 0.5 second/year, while TDB and TT remain close. As of the beginning of 2011, the difference between TDB and TCB is about 16.6 seconds.

:TDB = TCB − L×(JD − T)×86400 + TDB

where L = 1.550519768, TDB = −6.55 s, T = 2443144.5003725, and JD is the TCB Julian date (that is, a quantity which was equal to T on 1977 January 1 00:00:00 TAI at the geocenter and which increases by one every 86400 seconds of TCB). 

==History==
From the 17th century to the late 19th century, planetary ephemerides were calculated using time scales based on the Earth&#x27;s rotation: usually the mean solar time of one of the principal observatories, such as Paris or Greenwich. After 1884, mean solar time at Greenwich became a standard, later named Universal Time (UT). But in the later 19th and early 20th centuries, with the increasing precision of astronomical measurements, it began to be suspected, and was eventually established, that the rotation of the Earth (i.e. the length of the day) showed irregularities on short time scales, and was slowing down on longer time scales. Ephemeris time was consequently developed as a standard that was free from the irregularities of Earth rotation, by defining the time &quot;as the independent variable of the equations of celestial mechanics&quot;, and it was at first measured astronomically, relying on the existing gravitational theories of the motions of the Earth about the Sun and of the Moon about the Earth.

After the caesium atomic clock was invented, such clocks were used increasingly from the late 1950s as secondary realizations of ephemeris time (ET). These secondary realizations improved on the original ET standard by the improved uniformity of the atomic clocks, and (e.g. in the late 1960s) they were used to provide standard time for planetary ephemeris calculations and in astrodynamics.

But ET in principle did not yet take account of relativity theory. The size of the periodic part of the variations due to time dilation between earth-based atomic clocks and the coordinate time of the Solar-System barycentric reference frame had been estimated at under 2 milliseconds, but in spite of this small size, it was increasingly considered in the early 1970s that time standards should be made suitable for applications in which differences due to relativistic time dilation could no longer be neglected.

In 1976, two new time scales were defined to replace ET (in the ephemerides for 1984 and afterwards) to take account of relativity. ET&#x27;s direct successor for measuring time on a geocentric basis was Terrestrial Dynamical Time (TDT). The new time scale to supersede ET for planetary ephemerides was to be Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB). TDB was to tick uniformly in a reference frame comoving with the barycenter of the Solar System. (As with any coordinate time, a corresponding clock, to coincide in rate, would need not only to be at rest in that reference frame, but also (an unattainable hypothetical condition) to be located outside all of the relevant gravity wells.) In addition, TDB was to have (as observed/evaluated at the Earth&#x27;s surface), over the long term average, the same rate as TDT (now TT). TDT and TDB were defined in a series of resolutions at the same 1976 meeting of the International Astronomical Union.

It was eventually realized that TDB was not well defined because it was not accompanied by a general relativistic metric and because the exact relationship between TDB and TDT had not been specified. (It was also later criticized as being not physically possible in exact accordance with its original definition: among other things the 1976 definition excluded a necessary small offset for the initial epoch of 1977.) After the difficulties were appreciated, in 1991 the IAU refined the official definitions of timescales by creating additional new time scales: Barycentric Coordinate Time (TCB) and Geocentric Coordinate Time (TCG). TCB was intended as a replacement for TDB, and TCG was its equivalent for use in near-Earth space. TDT was also renamed to Terrestrial Time (TT), because of doubts raised about the appropriateness of the word &quot;dynamical&quot; in that connection.

In 2006 TDB was redefined by IAU 2006 resolution 3; the &#x27;new&#x27; TDB was expressly acknowledged as equivalent for practical purposes to JPL ephemeris time argument Teph; the difference between TDB according to the 2006 standard and TT (both as observed from the surface of the Earth), remains under 2 ms for several millennia around the present epoch.

==Use of TDB==

TDB is a successor of Ephemeris Time (ET), in that ET can be seen (within the limits of the lesser accuracy and precision achievable in its time) to be an approximation to TDB as well as to Terrestrial Time (TT) (see Ephemeris time § Implementations). TDB in the form of the very closely analogous, and practically equivalent, time scale Teph continues to be used for the important DE405 planetary and lunar ephemerides from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Arguments have been put forward for the continued practical use of TDB rather than TCB based on the very small size of the difference between TDB and TT, not exceeding 0.002 second, which can be neglected for many applications. It has been argued that the smallness of this difference makes for a lower risk of damage if TDB is ever confused with TT, compared to the possible damage of confusing TCB and TT, which have a relative linear drift of about 0.5 second per year, (the difference was close to zero at the start of 1977, and by 2009 was already over a quarter of a minute and increasing).

<text>New Confucianism () is an intellectual movement of Confucianism that began in the early 20th century in Republican China, and further developed in post-Mao era contemporary China. It primarily developed during the May Fourth Movement. It is deeply influenced by, but not identical with, the neo-Confucianism of the Song and Ming dynasties.

It is a neo-conservative movement of various Chinese traditions and has been regarded as containing religious overtones; it advocates for certain Confucianist elements of society – such as social, ecological, and political harmony – to be applied in a contemporary context in synthesis with Western philosophies such as rationalism and humanism. Its philosophies have emerged as a focal point of discussion between Confucian scholars in mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the United States.

== History ==
The first generation of new Confucians (1921–1949) came about as a response to the May Fourth movement and its iconoclastic stance against Confucianism. Confucianism was attacked as unscientific and contrary to the progress of a modern China. One notable figure during this time was Xiong Shili, who studied Buddhism in depth in his youth but later sought a reformation of the Confucian philosophical framework. 

Borrowing from the school of Wang Yangming, Xiong developed a metaphysical system for the new Confucian movement and believed Chinese learning was superior to Western learning. Another figure, Feng Youlan, following the neo-Confucian school of Zhu Xi, sought a revival of Chinese philosophy as challenged and influenced by the questions and techniques of modern Western philosophy.

With the start of the communist regime in China in 1949, many of the leading intellectuals left the mainland to Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the United States. Notable figures of this second-generation (1950–1979) include individuals like Tang Junyi, Mou Zongsan, and Xu Fuguan; all three are students of Xiong Shili. Mou, in particular, was grounded in classic Chinese philosophical traditions and argued that Immanuel Kant was, in many ways, a Western Confucius. These three worked with the Qian Mu to found New Asia College in Hong Kong. One of New Asia&#x27;s most prominent graduates was Yu Yingshi. Together with Zhang Junmai, in 1958 they issued &quot;New Confucian Manifesto&quot; consolidating their beliefs and drawing attention to their philosophical movement.

In the early 21st century, the most prominent representatives of the new Confucian movement outside of China have been the students of Mou Zongsan. One of the most prominent, Tu Wei-ming, promoted the idea that Confucianism saw three epochs: the classical pre-Han Confucianism, Song-Ming neo-Confucianism, and new Confucianism. This third generation has been instrumental in grounding Confucianism in non-Asian contexts, such as Boston Confucianism and Western scholars such as Wm. Theodore de Bary.

=== Mainland New Confucianism ===

Following the period of reform and opening-up under Deng Xiaoping after 1978, Confucian thought experienced a revival in mainland China. An emerging current of &quot;Mainland New Confucians&quot;, led initially by Jiang Qing, sharply demarcated themselves from the &quot;Overseas New Confucianism&quot; developed by Mou and others. According to Jiang, Confucian thought can be divided into two currents, &quot;Mind Confucianism&quot; and &quot;Political Confucianism&quot;.

Confucianism, he posits, has for over a millennium been confined to Mind Confucianism at the expense of Political Confucianism, leaving the true thought of Confucius &quot;mutilated&quot;. Jiang argues for the restoration of political legitimacy as a core focus of Confucian thought, for renewed attention to Confucian constitutional structures, and for the establishment of Confucianism as an official state religion.

Other Mainland New Confucians debated a more liberal political attitude to Confucianism. Chen Ming, an academic at the Institute for World Religions in Beijing, took a leading role. Chen wrote that Confucianism faced the task of providing solutions to three major problems of contemporary Chinese society: political reconstruction, cultural identity, and religious faith. While agreeing with Jiang&#x27;s rejection of the metaphysical emphasis of &quot;Overseas New Confucianism&quot;, Chen argues that Confucianism is best seen as a civil religion on American lines, compatible with democracy, and that political life can express a religious aspect without a formal state religion.

Chen distanced himself from several rivals: Mou Zongsan&#x27;s Confucianism as the &quot;perfect teaching&quot; seemed too informed by emotion; Jiang Qing&#x27;s notion that China should be a Confucian state that unified the political and religious was too simplistic; Kang Xiaoguang&#x27;s program to transform Confucianism into a state religion was &quot;hardly applicable&quot;.

== Terminology ==
Whereas the English rendering of the movement is generally &quot;new Confucianism&quot;, there is a variety of translations in the Chinese. Many Taiwan-based writers will tend to use the term &quot;contemporary new Confucianism&quot; ( or ) to emphasize the movement&#x27;s continuity with the Song-Ming neo-Confucianism.

Many within Mainland China prefer the term &quot;modern new Confucianism&quot; ( or ) with an emphasis on the period of modernization after May Fourth.

== Philosophy ==

New Confucianism is a school of Chinese philosophy influenced by Confucianism. After the events of the May Fourth Movement in 1919, in which Confucianism was blamed for China’s weakness and decline in the face of Western aggression, a major Chinese philosopher of the time, Xiong Shili (1885–1968), established and re-constructed Confucianism as a response. 

New Confucianism is a political, ethical, and social philosophy using metaphysical ideas from both Western and Eastern philosophy. It is categorized into three generations, starting with Xiong Shili and Feng Youlan as the first generation philosophers who set the basis. The second generation consists of Xiong&#x27;s students, Mou Zongsan, Tang Junyi, and Xu Fuguan. The third generation is not determined via figures unlike previous generations, but new Confucianism from 1980. Xiong and his follower&#x27;s attempts to reconstruct Confucianism gave new Confucianism its Chinese name, xīn rú jiā.

=== First Generation ===

====Xiong Shili ====

Xiong Shili (1885–1968) is widely regarded as the thinker who laid down the basis for the revival of Confucianism as new Confucianism in the twentieth century. Much of the basis of new Confucianism comes from Xiong&#x27;s New Doctrine. Proficient in Buddhist classics, Xiong argued that classics of Eastern Philosophy must be integrated in contemporary Chinese philosophy for more solidity. Xiong recognized Buddhism&#x27;s dark view of human nature, but also recognized that there are brighter sides to human nature. For this reason, he rejected the Buddhist learning of &quot;daily decrease&quot; which dictated that the practice to suppress one&#x27;s dark nature was necessary. 

He arrived at such conclusion after his examination of Classic Confucianism. While Confucianism also examines the negative aspect of human nature, thus the necessity to habituate oneself with ritual, the purpose of the practice of ritual and attainment of &quot;ren&quot; is not focused on restricting the darker aspects of human nature but developing the &quot;fundamental goodness&quot;, i.e., the &quot;duan&quot; of human beings that Mencius writes of.

In order to incorporate Buddhism with Confucianism as a part of his contemporary Chinese philosophy encompassing various Eastern philosophies, Xiong proposed a correction of Buddhist learning of daily decrease. Xiong understood the basis behind &quot;daily decrease&quot; to be Buddhism&#x27;s metaphysical belief of the &quot;unbridgeable split between an absolute unchanging reality (Dharma-nature or fa-xing), and a constantly changing and conditional phenomenal world (Dharma-characters or fa-xing) (Xiong, 1994, pp. 69–77, 84–5, 111–12). 

Jiyuan Yu, in his examination of Xiong, describes this as the &quot;Separation theory&quot;. Meanwhile, Xiong&#x27;s theory behind correcting the &quot;daily decrease&quot; rested heavily upon what Yu describes as the &quot;Sameness Thesis&quot;. Xiong, in his New Doctrine, calls this Dharma-nature &quot;ti&quot; and Dharma-characters &quot;yong&quot;. Xiong argues that unlike how Buddhism perceives these two worlds, these two worlds are a unity. Xiong&#x27;s reasoning is shown in his 1985 version of New Doctrine:

His view on this unity can be seen in his earlier works such as New Treatise on the Uniqueness of Consciousness. In New Treatise, he argues that the Reality is equal to the Mind. This Mind does not refer to one&#x27;s individual mind but the universal presence in which there is a universality of mind amongst all beings, thus being the reality. Xiong incorporates the Confucian and Buddhist concept of self-mastery of one&#x27;s desires, by arguing that failing to control one&#x27;s desires and individual mind, one will be &quot;a heap of dead matter&quot;. Xiong&#x27;s view is that one should perceive objects of the world internally, since what is external is ultimately also internal and that they are one as both Mind and Reality.

=== Second Generation ===

==== Mou Zongsan ====

Mou Zongsan is considered to be one of the more influential second generation philosophers. Mou&#x27;s general philosophy on metaphysics stays in line with Xiong&#x27;s. He embellishes upon Xiong&#x27;s theories on Mind and Reality to apply it to a more socio-political aspect. Mou claims universality exists in all philosophical truth. Which suggests that political and social theories of the world can be connected in essence. Mou argues in his lectures that particularity exists because of the different systems that are established in different cultures. 

These different systems, after a series of philosophical reasoning and interpretation, arrive at a same philosophical truth. He believes that our physical limitations, i.e., our physical being, create these different systems and different cultures. Being that our mind, i.e., form, is still manifested and exists within this physical world, we should not let these limitations prevent us from practicing philosophical reasoning.

Mou&#x27;s political philosophy is more clearly showed as he discusses the historical necessity that follows the particularity of human beings. Different nations and different systems&#x27; existence can be explained mainly because of this historical necessity. Mou asserts that historical necessity exists neither because of logical necessity or metaphysical necessity but because of what he calls a development of the spirit, what he labels as dialectical necessity. 

He claims that history should be perceived and interpreted as something that has both historical necessity i.e., also dialectical necessity, and moral necessity. For there are two types of judgment: moral and historical. Mou states, that Greek or Chinese, these basic necessities behind history and fundamental human character are the same, and therefore universality in philosophical truth exists even behind politics and history.

== New Confucian Manifesto ==
The term itself was first used as early as 1963, in two articles in the Hong Kong journal &quot;Rensheng&quot;. It did not come into common use until the late 1970s. New Confucianism is often associated with the essay, &quot;A Manifesto on Chinese Culture to the World,&quot; which was published in 1958 by Tang Junyi, Mou Zongsan, Xu Fuguan and Zhang Junmai. This work is often referred to as the &quot;New Confucian Manifesto&quot;, although that phrase never occurs in it.

The Manifesto presents a vision of Chinese culture as having a fundamental unity throughout history, of which Confucianism is the highest expression. The particular interpretation of Confucianism given by the Manifesto is deeply influenced by neo-Confucianism, and in particular the version of neo-Confucianism most associated with Lu Xiangshan and Wang Yangming, as opposed to that associated with Zhu Xi. The Manifesto argues that while China must learn from the West modern science and democracy, the West must learn from China, and the Confucian tradition in particular, &quot;a more all-encompassing wisdom.&quot;

== Harmonious Society ==

The concept of a &quot;harmonious society&quot; () dates back to the time of Confucius. As a result, the philosophy has been characterized as deriving from new Confucianism. In modern times, it developed into a key feature of former Communist Party general secretary Hu Jintao&#x27;s signature ideology of the Scientific Development Concept, developed in the mid-2000s, re-introduced by the Hu–Wen Administration during the 2005 National People&#x27;s Congress.

The philosophy is recognized as a response to the increasing social injustice and inequality emerging in mainland Chinese society as a result of unchecked economic growth, which has led to social conflict. The governing philosophy was therefore shifted around economic growth to overall societal balance and harmony. Along with a moderately prosperous society, it was set to be one of the national goals for the ruling communist party.

The promotion of &quot;Harmonious Society&quot; demonstrated that Hu Jintao&#x27;s ruling philosophy had departed from that of his predecessors. Near the end of his tenure in 2011, Hu appeared to extend the ideology to an international dimension, with a focus on the international peace and cooperation, which is said to lead to a &quot;harmonious world&quot;. The administration of Hu&#x27;s successor, Xi Jinping, has used the philosophy more sparingly.

Some scholars, notably Yan Xuetong and Daniel A. Bell, advocate the restoration of meritocratic Confucian institutions such as the censorate in China and elsewhere as part of a new Confucian political program. Others (e.g., Jana S. Rošker) emphasize that Confucianism is by no means a monolithic or static scope of traditional thought, but rather implies different currents that can be used quite arbitrarily and selectively by modern ideologies, which are marked by their function of legitimizing the state power. Considering the historical development of the concept of harmony we need to ask ourselves to what extent are the philosophical traditions based on historic assumptions, and to what extent are they merely a product of the ideological and political demands of the current period.
