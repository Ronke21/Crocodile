<text>Trematoda is a class of flatworms known as flukes or trematodes. They are obligate internal parasites with a complex life cycle requiring at least two hosts. The intermediate host, in which asexual reproduction occurs, is usually a snail. The definitive host, where the flukes sexually reproduce, is a vertebrate. Infection by trematodes can cause disease in all five traditional vertebrate classes: mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and fish.

==Etymology==
Trematodes are commonly referred to as flukes. This term can be traced back to the Old English name for flounder, and refers to the flattened, rhomboidal shape of the organisms.

==Taxonomy==
There are 18,000 to 24,000 known species of trematodes, divided into two subclasses — the Aspidogastrea and the Digenea. Aspidogastrea is the smaller subclass, comprising 61 species. These flukes mainly infect bivalves and bony fishes. Digenea — which comprise the majority of trematodes — are found in certain mollusks and vertebrates.

==Trematodes of medical importance==
Flukes that cause disease in humans are often classified based on the organ system they infect. For example:

* Blood flukes inhabit the blood in some stages of their life cycle. Blood flukes that cause disease in humans include &quot;Trichobilharzia regenti&quot;, which causes swimmer&#x27;s itch, and seven species of genus &quot;Schistosoma&quot; which cause schistosomiasis: &quot;S. guineensis&quot;, &quot;S.haematobium&quot;, &quot;S. intercalatum&quot;, &quot;S. japonicum&quot;, &quot;S. malayensis&quot;, &quot;S. mansoni&quot;, &quot;S. mekongi&quot;. As a definitive host, humans are infected when the cercariae (the larval forms of trematodes) penetrate the skin. Any contact with water containing these cercariae can potentially result in infection. Adult blood flukes can live for years in human or animal reservoir hosts. &quot;S. haematobium&quot; and &quot;S. japonicum&quot; are of particular importance, as these are carcinogenic parasites. &quot;S. haematobium&quot;, which infects the urinary bladder, is among the most important causes of bladder cancer in humans. This organism is classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as a Group 1 (extensively proven) carcinogen. &quot;S. japonicum&quot; is associated with the development of liver cancer, and is classified as a Group 2B (possibly carcinogenic to humans) carcinogen.
* Liver flukes are commonly found within bile ducts, liver, and gallbladder in certain mammalian and avian species. They include &quot;Clonorchis sinensis&quot;, &quot;Dicrocoelium dendriticum&quot;, &quot;Dicrocoelium hospes&quot;, &quot;Fasciola gigantica&quot;, &quot;Fasciola hepatica&quot;, &quot;Opisthorchis felineus&quot;, and &quot;Opisthorchis viverrini&quot;. &quot;Clonorchis&quot; and &quot;Opisthorchis&quot; are carcinogenic parasites that are strongly associated with the development of cancer of the bile ducts.
* Lung flukes: there are ten species of lung flukes that infect humans, causing paragonimiasis. Of these, the most common cause of human paragonimiasis is &quot;Paragonimus westermani&quot;, the oriental lung fluke. Lung flukes require three different hosts in order to complete their life cycle. The first intermediate host is a snail, the second intermediate host is a crab or crayfish, and the definitive host for lung flukes is an animal or human host.
* Intestinal flukes inhabit the epithelium of the small intestine. These include &quot;Fasciolopsis buski&quot; (which causes fasciolopsiasis), &quot;Metagonimus miyatai&quot;, &quot;Metagonimus takahashii&quot;, &quot;Metagonimus yokogawai&quot; (which cause metagonimiasis), and &quot;Heterophyes heterophyes&quot; and &quot;Heterophyes nocens&quot; (which cause heterophyiasis).

==Anatomy==
Trematodes are flattened oval or worm-like animals, usually no more than a few centimeters in length, although species as small as are known. Their most distinctive external feature is the presence of two suckers, one close to the mouth, and the other on the underside of the animal.

The body surface of trematodes comprises a tough syncytial tegument, which helps protect against digestive enzymes in those species that inhabit the gut of larger animals. It is also the surface of gas exchange; there are no respiratory organs.

The mouth is located at the forward end of the animal, and opens into a muscular, pumping pharynx. The pharynx connects, via a short oesophagus, to one or two blind-ending caeca, which occupy most of the length of the body. In some species, the caeca are themselves branched. As in other flatworms, there is no anus, and waste material must be egested through the mouth.

Although the excretion of nitrogenous waste occurs mostly through the tegument, trematodes do possess an excretory system, which is instead mainly concerned with osmoregulation. This consists of two or more protonephridia, with those on each side of the body opening into a collecting duct. The two collecting ducts typically meet up at a single bladder, opening to the exterior through one or two pores near the posterior end of the animal.

The brain consists of a pair of ganglia in the head region, from which two or three pairs of nerve cords run down the length of the body. The nerve cords running along the ventral surface are always the largest, while the dorsal cords are present only in the Aspidogastrea. Trematodes generally lack any specialized sense organs, although some ectoparasitic species do possess one or two pairs of simple ocelli.

Body wall musculature: Formed of three different muscle layers: circular, longitudinal, and diagonal. The outermost layer is formed by the circular muscle fibers, directly behind that are the longitudinal muscle fibers. The inner layer is formed by the diagonal muscle fibers. Together these muscle fibers form the segmented body wall of trematodes.

Oral sucker and acetabulum: In some species of Trematoda, such as T. bragai, there is an acetabulum. This saucer-shaped organ is attached to the oral sucker in some Trematodes and other parasitic worms. This allows for parasitic worms to attach to their host by penetrating the host’s tissue with spines lining the acetabulum organ. In trematodes, the oral sucker is linked to the pharynx via a canal composed of meridional, equatorial, and radial muscle fibers. Together, the mouth, pharynx, and esophagus form the foregut in Trematodes.

===Reproductive system of blood flukes===
Most trematodes are hermaphrodites, as are many internal parasites. Blood flukes (&quot;Schistosoma&quot;) are the only form of trematodes that are dioecious (have both a male and female sex). Blood flukes are unique in the way that they can undergo both asexual and sexual reproduction. Asexual reproduction occurs in the hepatopancreas of a freshwater snail, which serves as an intermediate host. Sexual reproduction occurs later in the life cycle, in the definitive (vertebrate) host.

The male reproductive system usually includes two testes, though some species may have more. The testes are located posterior and dorsal to the ventral sucker. Spermatogenesis produces biflagellate sperm (sperm with two tails). Sperm is stored in the seminal vesicles, which are connected to the testes by the vas deferens. The male reproductive system varies considerably in structure between species; this can be very useful in species identification.

The female reproductive system consists of one ovary connected to an elongated uterus by a ciliated oviduct. The uterus opens to the exterior at the &quot;genital pore&quot; (the common external opening of the male and female reproductive systems). The location of the ovary varies among different species, making the female reproductive system useful in species identification. At the base of the oviduct is a copulatory duct — termed &quot;Laurer&#x27;s canal&quot; — which is analogous to a vagina. Oocytes are released from the ovary into the &quot;oocapt&quot; (the dilated proximal end of the oviduct). Sperm cells travel from the seminal vesicles through the uterus to reach the &quot;ootype&quot; (the dilated distal part of the oviduct), where fertilization occurs. The ootype is connected via a pair of ducts to a number of &quot;vitelline ducts&quot; that produce yolk. After the egg is surrounded by yolk, its shell is formed from the secretions of &quot;Mehlis&#x27; glands&quot;, the ducts of which also open into the ootype. From the ootype, the fertilized egg then travels back into the uterus, and is ultimately released from the &quot;genital atrium&quot;.

==Life cycles==

Trematodes have a very complex life cycle and depending on what taxa they belong to, their life cycles can be completed with as little as one host compared to the typical three hosts.  When there is one host, this is normally a specific species of snail of the family Lymnaeidae. Almost all trematodes infect molluscs as the first host in the life cycle, and most have a complex life cycle involving other hosts. Most trematodes are monoecious and alternately reproduce sexually and asexually. The two main exceptions to this are the Aspidogastrea, which have no asexual reproduction, and the schistosomes, which are dioecious.

In the definitive host, in which sexual reproduction occurs, eggs are commonly shed along with host feces. Eggs shed in water release free-swimming larval forms (Miracidia) that are infective to the intermediate host, in which asexual reproduction occurs.

A species that exemplifies the remarkable life history of the trematodes is the bird fluke, &quot;Leucochloridium paradoxum&quot;. The definitive hosts, in which the parasite reproduces, are various woodland birds, while the hosts in which the parasite multiplies (intermediate host) are various species of snail. The adult parasite in the bird&#x27;s gut produces eggs and these eventually end up on the ground in the bird&#x27;s feces. Some eggs may be swallowed by a snail and hatch into larvae (miracidia). These larvae grow and take on a sac-like appearance. This stage is known as the sporocyst and it forms a central body in the snail&#x27;s digestive gland that extends into a brood sac in the snail&#x27;s head, muscular foot and eye-stalks. It is in the central body of the sporocyst where the parasite replicates itself, producing many tiny embryos (redia). These embryos move to the brood sac and mature into cercaria.

===Life cycle adaptations===
Trematodes have a large variation of forms throughout their life cycles. Individual trematode parasites life cycles may vary from this list. They have five larval stages along with the cystic and fully matured adult phases.
# Trematodes are released from the definitive host as eggs, which have evolved to withstand the harsh environment
# Released from the egg which hatches into the miracidium. This infects the first intermediate host in one of two ways, either active or passive transmission. The first host is normally a mollusk. a) Active transmission has adapted for dispersal in space as a free swimming ciliated miracidium with adaptations for recognizing and penetrating the first intermediate host. b) Passive transmission has adapted for dispersal in time and infects the first intermediate host contained within the egg.
#The sporocyst forms inside the snail first intermediate host and feeds through diffusion across the tegument. 
#The rediae also forms inside the snail first intermediate host and feeds through a developed pharynx. Either the rediae or the sporocyst develops into the cercariae through polyembryony in the snail. 
#The cercariae are adapted for dispersal in space and exhibit a large variety in morphology. They are adapted to recognize and penetrate the second intermediate host, and contain behavioral and physiological adaptations not present in earlier life stages.
#The metacercariae are an adapted cystic form dormant in the secondary intermediate host. 
#The adult is the fully developed form which infects the definitive host.

The first stage is the miracidium that is triangular in shape and covered by a ciliated ectoderm which is the outermost layer of the three germ layers. The epidermis and epidemic tissues of the parasite will develop from the miracidium. They also have an anterior spin which helps them drill into the snail. The miracidium develops into the sporocyst, which is a sac-like structure, and in this sac the larvae begin to develop. The cells multiply. The rediae and cercariae develop from the larvae which are then released and encyst as metacercariae, for instance on aquatic plants. Humans as well as larger sea creatures get infected when they eat these plants.

When they infect humans, it can take 3–4 months for the metacercariae to mature into adult flukes and lay eggs.

==== Example: liver flukes ====
Liver flukes, one of the different species, are responsible for causing liver fluke disease which is also known as fasciolosis. They are hermaphroditic internal parasites. They are caused by the migration of a large number of immature flukes through the liver passageway or by adult flukes that migrate to the bile ducts. Liver flukes infect all grazing animals and infect humans when they eat raw or undercooked fish.

Like other flukes, the liver flukes need intermediate hosts and as a result, the transmission from animals to humans happens in three phases. The first phase is the infection of the snail (the first intermediate host) via feces. They complete their gestation and hatch as cercariae. They leave their snail hosts and infect fish who are their second intermediate host. Lastly, larger animals ingest the metacercariae in raw and undercooked fish. In humans or grazing animals, the metacercariae complete their life cycle and become full grown liver flukes.

=== Eusociality ===
One species of tremtaoda, &quot;Haplorchis pumilio&quot;, has evolved eusociality involving a colony of them creating a class of sterile soldiers. One fluke invades a host and establishes a colony of dozens to thousands of clones that work together to take it over. Since rival trematode species might also invade and replace them, a specialized caste of sterile soldier trematodes protects the colony.

Soldiers are smaller, more mobile, and develop along a different pathway than sexually mature reproductives. One big difference is their mouthparts (pharynx), which are five times as big as those of the reproductives. They make up nearly a quarter of the volume of the soldier. These soldiers don’t have a germinal mass, can’t metamorphose to be reproductive, and are, therefore, obligately sterile.

Soldiers are readily distinguished from the immature and mature reproductive worms. Soldiers are more aggressive than reproductives, attacking heterospecific trematodes that infect their host &quot;in vitro&quot;. Interestingly, &quot;H. pumilio&quot; soldiers do not attack conspecifics from other colonies.

The soldiers are not evenly distributed throughout the host body. They’re found in the highest numbers in the basal visceral mass, where competing trematodes tend to multiply during the early phase of infection. This strategic positioning allows them to effectively defend against invaders, similar to how soldier distribution patterns are seen in other animals with defensive castes.

They &quot;appear to be an obligately sterile physical caste, akin to that of the most advanced social insects&quot;. Reflecting on their use for understanding the evolution of animal social castes, one review commented, &quot;trematodes are a lineage for sociobiologists to keep a careful watch on!&quot;

==Infections==
Trematodes can cause disease in many types of vertebrates, including mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish. Cattle and sheep can become infected by eating contaminated food. These infections lead to a reduction in milk or meat production, which can be of significant economic importance to the livestock industry.

Human trematode infections are most common in Asia, Africa and Latin America. However, trematodes can be found anywhere where untreated human waste is used as fertilizer. Humans can be infected by trematodes by immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water, or by consuming raw or undercooked contaminated animals or plants.

=== Treatment ===
Albendazole can be used to treat clonorchiasis and opisthorchiasis. Triclabendazole is often used to treat fasciolosis, and may also be useful in the treatment of paragonimiasis and dicrocoeliasis. Praziquantel is effective in the treatment of all diseases caused by flukes (clonorchiasis, dicrocoeliasis, echinostomiasis, fasciolopsiasis, fasciolosis, gastrodiscoidiasis, heterophyiasis, metagonimiasis, opisthorchiasis, paragonimiasis, and schistosomiasis).

<text>Lingua Franca Nova (), abbreviated as LFN and known colloquially as Elefen, is a constructed international auxiliary language originally created by C. George Boeree of Shippensburg University, Pennsylvania, and further developed by many of its users. Its vocabulary is based primarily on the Romance languages, namely French, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Catalan. Lingua Franca Nova has phonemic spelling based on 22 letters from the Latin script (a Cyrillic script was co-official until 2021).

The grammar of Lingua Franca Nova is inspired by the Romance creole languages. As most creole languages, Lingua Franca Nova has an extremely simplified grammatical system that is easy to learn.

== History ==
Boeree started to design Lingua Franca Nova in 1965, with the goal of creating an international auxiliary language simple, coherent and easy to learn for international communication. He was inspired by the Mediterranean Lingua Franca or &quot;Sabir&quot;, a Romance pidgin used by European sailors and merchants as a lingua franca in the Mediterranean Basin from the 11–18th century, and by various creoles such as Papiamento and Haitian Creole. He used French, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Catalan as lexifiers.

Lingua Franca Nova was first presented on the internet in 1998. A Yahoo! Group was formed in 2002 by Bjorn Madsen, and reached about 300 members who contributed significantly to the further evolution of the language.

In 2005 Stefan Fisahn created a wiki for the language. The wiki moved to Wikia in 2009, then was hosted directly on the official website in 2019.

In 2007, Igor Vasiljevic created a Facebook group, which now has over 600 members.

LFN was given an ISO 639-3 designation (&quot;lfn&quot;) by SIL in January 2008.

In 2008 Simon Davies started to make important updates to the LFN–English searchable &quot;master&quot; dictionary. The dictionary is being kept up-to-date in the official website, with over 20,000 entries, and was even published in printed form in 2018.

In 2012 a novel entirely translated into Lingua Franca Nova was first published in printed form: &quot;La aventuras de Alisia en la pais de mervelias&quot;, which is Simon Davies&#x27;s translation of Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;.

In 2014 a new official website was launched on the &quot;elefen.org&quot; domain: it offers various teaching supports (such as word lists for travellers, complete grammar guides) available in several languages, and hosts a wiki and the searchable official dictionary. Some literary works entirely translated in Lingua Franca Nova are also publicly available on the official website for reading. The website now contains an example conversational dialog: &quot;La conversa prima&quot; for beginning learners https://www.elefen.org/leteratur/la_conversa_prima.html

On April 18, 2018, Wikipedia in Lingua Franca Nova, called &quot;Vicipedia&quot;, was officially launched as a regular Wikipedia project.

On May 15, 2020 on the Web and on May 10, 2021 in printed form the first original literary novel written in Lingua Franca Nova was published: &quot;La xerca per Pahoa&quot;, by Vicente Costalago.

On January 5, 2021, the language&#x27;s creator, C. George Boeree, died of pancreatic cancer aged 68.

== Pronunciation and spelling ==
=== Phonology ===
==== Vowels ====
Lingua Franca Nova has five vowels like Spanish, Modern Greek, and Modern Hebrew.

==== Consonants ====
=== Orthography ===
LFN is normally written using the Latin alphabet. Its orthography is highly phonemic.

LFN vowels (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;o&quot; and &quot;u&quot;) are pronounced as they are in Spanish or Italian (approximately as in &quot;bar&quot;, &quot;bait&quot; or &quot;bet&quot;, &quot;beet&quot;, &quot;boat&quot; or &quot;ball&quot;, and &quot;boot&quot;). The vowel sounds allow a degree of variation, especially &quot;a&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, and &quot;o.&quot;

Diphthongs are &quot;ai&quot; , &quot;au&quot; , &quot;eu&quot; , and &quot;oi&quot; (approximately as in &quot;my&quot;, &quot;cow&quot;, &quot;eww&quot;, and &quot;boy&quot;).

The letters &quot;i&quot; and &quot;u&quot; are used as semivowels ( and ) at the start of a word before a vowel (e.g. &#x27;), between vowels (e.g. &#x27;), in &quot;li&quot; and &quot;ni&quot; (not in the first syllable of a word) between vowels (e.g. &#x27;), and in &quot;cu&quot; and &quot;gu&quot; before a vowel (e.g. &#x27;). The letter &quot;n&quot; is pronounced as in &quot;think&quot; () before &quot;g&quot; (e.g. &#x27;) and &quot;c&quot; (e.g. &#x27;), and in &quot;-ng&quot; at the end of a syllable (e.g. &quot;&quot;). The letters &quot;a&quot;, &quot;e,&quot; and &quot;o&quot; may vary in pronunciation with possible allophones being , or , and or respectively.

Although stress is &quot;not&quot; phonemic in LFN, most words are stressed on the vowel or diphthong before the last consonant (e.g. &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;). Words with no vowel before the last consonant are accented on the first vowel (e.g. &#x27;). Words ending in a diphthong are accented on the diphthong (e.g. &#x27;). Those ending in the double vowels &quot;ae&quot;, &quot;ao&quot;, &quot;ea&quot;, &quot;eo&quot;, &quot;oa&quot;, &quot;oe&quot;, or &quot;ui&quot; are accented on the first of these vowels (e.g. &#x27;). The addition of &quot;-s&quot; or &quot;-es&quot; for plural nouns does not alter the stress.

The phoneme /h/ is highly marginal and may be silent.

The letters &quot;k&quot;, &quot;q&quot;, &quot;w&quot;, and &quot;y&quot; (&quot;ka&quot;, &quot;qua&quot;, &quot;wa&quot;, and &quot;ya&quot;) are available for words and names from other languages. Variations in pronunciation are acceptable.

== Vocabulary ==

===Sources of lexicon===
The lexicon of Lingua Franca Nova is primarily founded on Italo-Western languages: French, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish and Catalan.

Lingua Franca Nova does not derive the word form in a strictly logical way, but lexicon creators also consider sound beauty and other subjective factors. Generally, if a word is similar in most of source languages, this is adopted.

Of course, each language has spelling and pronunciation variants. Generally, Lingua Franca Nova prefers pronunciation to spelling.

When source languages share a native word from Latin, but they change it in various ways, Lingua Franca Nova prefers the oldest variant, namely a variant similar to Latin. For example:

But when the Latin form does not agree to the phonotactic rules of Lingua Franca Nova, its spelling is adapted (similarly to modern languages, especially Italian):

The lexicon of Lingua Franca Nova can accept foreign words being internationally important (for example names of modern nations, main languages, seas and other international geographic entities, important entities from various world cultures). Generally, words are phonetically transcripted, not orthographically (for example, letter &quot;c&quot; becomes &quot;s&quot; if the source language pronounces it as a sibilant, &quot;tx&quot; in words taken from Italian). A lot of exceptions are possible, especially when the pronunciation is uncertain; in such a case, orthography is preferably followed (for example, word &quot;English&quot; is transcribed as and not to retain a more recognizable form).

== Grammar ==

LFN is an SVO (subject-verb-object) language. Modifiers generally follow what they modify, as do prepositional phrases and subordinate clauses.

Other than the plural in -s or -es, nouns are invariant. A noun&#x27;s role in a sentence is determined by word order and prepositions. There are 22 prepositions, such as a (at, to), de (of, from), en (in, into), and con (with).

Nouns are usually preceded by articles (la or un) or other determiners such as esta (this, these), acel (that, those), alga (some), cada (every, each), multe (many, much), and poca (few, little). Possessive determiners, cardinal numerals, and the adjectives bon and mal (good and bad) also precede the noun; ordinal numerals follow the noun. A variety of pronouns are identical to or derived from determiners.

The personal pronouns do not decline for case:
The third person singular animate pronoun el is used to refer to people of both sexes and animals; the gendered forms elo (he) and ela (she) are rarely used. The singular inanimate pronoun lo is used for things and abstract concepts. In the plural, both animate and inanimate referents use the pronoun los. The indefinite pronoun on is used when the referent is an unspecified person, or concerns people in general, similar to the generic you in English.

For the first and second person pronouns, the reflexives are the same as the regular pronouns, and the possessive determiners are mea, nosa, tua, and vosa. Possessive pronouns are formed by using the article la before possessive determiners, e.g. la mea.

Se is the third-person reflexive, singular and plural. The third person possessive determiner, both singular and plural, is sua, and the possessive pronoun is la sua.

Verbs are invariant. The verb alone represents the present tense and the infinitive. Other tenses and moods are indicated by preceding particles:
Adverbs such as ja (already) and auxiliary verbs such as comensa (begin to) are used to add precision. The active participle ends in -nte and the passive participle in -da. They can be used with es (to be) to form a progressive aspect and a passive voice, respectively.

Adjectives are invariant, and adverbs are not distinguished from adjectives. Adjectives follow nouns and adverbs follow verbs but precede adjectives. The comparative is formed with plu or min, the superlative with la plu or la min.

Questions are formed by preceding the sentence with esce or by using one of several &quot;question words&quot;, such as cual (what, which), ci (who), do (where), cuando (when), and perce (why). These same words are also used to introduce subordinate clauses, as are words such as si (if), ce (that), car (because), and afin (so that).

Prepositions include a (at, to), de (of, from), ante (before, in front of), pos (after, behind), etc.

Conjunctions include e (and), o (or), and ma (but).

== Affixes ==

LFN has a small number of regular affixes that help to create new words.

Three suffixes that create nouns are -or, -ador, and -eria, which refer to a person, a device, and a place respectively. They can be added to any noun, adjective, or verb. For example:
* &quot;carne&quot; (meat) + &quot;-or&quot; &gt; &quot;carnor&quot; (butcher)
* &quot;lava&quot; + &quot;-ador&quot; &gt; &quot;lavador&quot; (washing machine)
* &quot;flor&quot; + -&quot;eria&quot; &gt; &quot;floreria&quot; (florist shop)

Another suffix is -i which, added to an adjective and some nouns, means &quot;to become&quot; or &quot;to cause to become&quot;. It is also used with names for tools, machines, or supplies with the meaning &quot;to use&quot;. For example:
* &quot;calda&quot; (hot) + &quot;-i&quot; &gt; &quot;caldi&quot; (to heat)
* &quot;telefon&quot; (telephone) + &quot;-i&quot; &gt; &quot;telefoni&quot; (to telephone)

Two more suffixes are -eta, which forms a diminutive version of something, and -on, which forms a augmentative version. (They are not, however, simply synonyms for small and large size or itensity but productive affixes which form new vocabulary.) For example:
* &quot;bove&quot; (cow, cattle) + &quot;-eta&quot; &gt; &quot;boveta&quot; (calf)
* &quot;tela&quot; (cloth) + &quot;-on&quot; &gt; &quot;telon&quot; (sheet, tablecloth)

There are also three suffixes that turn nouns into adjectives: -al means &quot;pertaining to...,&quot; -in means &quot;similar to...,&quot; -osa means &quot;full of...&quot; For example:
* &quot;nasion&quot; (nation) + &quot;-al&quot; &gt; &quot;nasional&quot; (national)
* &quot;serpente&quot; (serpent) + &quot;-in&quot; &gt; &quot;serpentin&quot; (serpentine)
* &quot;mofo&quot; (mold) + &quot;-osa&quot; &gt; &quot;mofosa&quot; (moldy)

Other suffixes include -able (-able), -isme (-ism), and -iste (-ist).

There are also several prefixes. Non- means not, re- means again or in the opposite direction, and des- means to undo. For example:
* &quot;non-&quot; + &quot;felis&quot; (happy) &gt; &quot;nonfelis&quot; (unhappy)
* &quot;re-&quot; + &quot;pone&quot; (place) &gt; &quot;repone&quot; (replace)
* &quot;des-&quot; + &quot;infeta&quot; (infect) &gt; &quot;desinfeta&quot; (disinfect)

Other prefixes include pos- (post-), pre- (pre-), supra- (super-), su- (sub-), media- (mid-), vis- (vice-), inter- (inter-), and auto- (auto-, self-)

Compounds of verbs plus objects create nouns:
* &quot;porta&quot; (carry) + &quot;candela&quot; (candle) &gt; &quot;portacandela&quot; (candlestick)
* &quot;pasa&quot; (pass) + &quot;tempo&quot; (time) &gt; &quot;pasatempo&quot; (pastime)
* &quot;para&quot; (stop) + &quot;pluve&quot; (rain) &gt; &quot;parapluve&quot; (umbrella)

Two nouns are rarely joined (as they often are in English), but are linked with de or other prepositions instead:
* &quot;avia de mar&quot; - seabird
* &quot;casa per avias&quot; - birdhouse
* &quot;xef de polisia&quot; - police chief

==Literature==
A rich literature in Lingua Franca Nova with both original and translated texts exists.

The first original literary novel written in Lingua Franca Nova was &quot;La xerca per Pahoa&quot;, by Vicente Costalago, published on May 15, 2020 on the Web and on May 10, 2021 in printed form.

Here are the main literary works translated into Lingua Franca Nova, all publicly available for reading on the official website:
* &quot;Colinas como elefantes blanca&quot; (&quot;Hills Like White Elephants&quot;) by Ernest Hemingway
* &quot;Demandas de un laboror lejente&quot; (&quot;Fragen eines lesenden Arbeiters&quot;) by Bertolt Brecht
* &quot;Frate peti&quot; (&quot;Little Brother&quot;) by Cory Doctorow
* &quot;La alia de capeles roja&quot; (&quot;The Red-Headed League&quot;) by Arthur Conan Doyle
* &quot;La aventuras de Alisia en la pais de mervelias&quot; (&quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;) by Lewis Carroll
* &quot;La cade de la Casa de Usor&quot; (&quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot;) by Edgar Allan Poe
* &quot;La jigante egoiste&quot; (&quot;The Selfish Giant&quot;) by Oscar Wilde
* &quot;La prinse peti&quot; (&quot;The Little Prince&quot;) by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry
* &quot;Leteras de la tera&quot; (&quot;Letters from the Earth&quot;) by Mark Twain
* &quot;Re Lear&quot; (&quot;King Lear&quot;) by William Shakespeare
* &quot;Tra la miror, e lo cual Alisia trova a ultra&quot; (&quot;Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There&quot;) by Lewis Carroll
* &quot;Un canta de natal&quot; (&quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;) by Charles Dickens
* &quot;Wini-la-Pu&quot; (&quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot;) by Alan Alexander Milne

==Flag==
The flag of Lingua Franca Nova, designed in 2004 by Stefan Fisahn and Beate Hornung, is the main symbol of Lingua Franca Nova and Elefenists.

The flag is made up of five color strips (blue, green, yellow, orange and red) starting from the bottom-left angle and extending to top and right borders.

It is similar to the flag of Seychelles, a country that has adopted Seychellois Creole as its official language, but uses the colors of a rainbow symbolizing peace. Its shape is meant to call the sunrise to mind.

In the past other flags existed: the first one, originally designed by Boeree and jokingly called &quot;europijon&quot; from the word pun between &quot;pijon&quot; (dove) and &quot;europijin&quot; (europidgin), was inspired by Pablo Picasso&#x27;s drawing.

<text>Xochicalco () is a pre-Columbian archaeological site in Miacatlán in the western part of the Mexican state of Morelos. The name &quot;Xochicalco&quot; may be translated from Nahuatl as &quot;in the house of Flowers&quot;. The site is located 38 km southwest of Cuernavaca, about 122 km by road from Mexico City. The site is open to visitors all week, from 10 am to 5 pm, although access to the observatory is only allowed after noon. The apogee of Xochicalco came after the fall of Teotihuacan and it has been speculated that Xochicalco may have played a part in the fall of the Teotihuacan empire.

The architecture and iconography of Xochicalco show affinities with Teotihuacan, the Maya area, and the Matlatzinca culture of the Toluca Valley. Today the residents of the nearby village of Cuentepec speak Nahuatl.

The main ceremonial center is atop an artificially leveled hill, with remains of residential structures, mostly unexcavated, on long terraces covering the slopes. The site was first occupied by 200 BC, but did not develop into an urban center until the Epiclassic period (AD 700 – 900). Nearly all the standing architecture at the site was built at this time. At its peak, the city may have had a population of up to 20,000 people.

Xochicalco is an UNESCO World Heritage Site and a tourist destination. The site also has a well-stocked museum.

==Monuments==

Of special interest are sculptured reliefs on the sides of some buildings. The Temple of the Feathered Serpent has fine stylized depictions of that deity in a style which includes apparent influences of Teotihuacan and Maya art. The high taluds of the pyramid bear relief carvings that depict towns that paid tribute to Xochicalco as well as several seated figures that look Mayan. It has been speculated that Xochicalco may have had a community of artists from other parts of Mesoamerica.

Other monuments at the site include several other step-pyramid temples, palaces, three ballcourts, sweat-baths, an unusual row of circular altars, and a cave with steps carved down into it. The site also has some free-standing sculptured stelae; others were removed from their original location and are now on display in the INAH museum in Mexico City and at the site museum.

==History and Exploration==
Xochicalco was founded in about 650 AD by the Olmeca-Xicalanca, which are a Mayan group of traders from Campeche, at a site that gave them an excellent position along several of the major Mesoamerican trade routes. The city-state had a population of 10,000 to 15,000 people, many of whom were engaged in craft production and long-distance trade. It was an important fortressed commercial and religious center following the decline of the great Meso-American city states. The poor farming conditions in the area show that it was likely built for defense purposes and trading. The ruins were first described by explorer Antonio Alzate in 1777. In 1810, Alexander von Humboldt published a description and illustration of Xochicalco, based on Alzate&#x27;s description and an engraving published in Mexico City in 1791. Emperor Maximilian of Mexico visited the ruins. The Temple of the Feathered Serpent was restored by Mexican archaeologist Leopoldo Batres in 1910. Major archaeological excavations and further restorations were done in a project from the 1940s through the 1960s by Eduardo Noguera and César Saenz. Jaime Litvak King also worked at the site. In 1976 archaeologist Kenneth Hirth of Pennsylvania State University began a multi-season fieldwork project in which he mapped the entire site and conducted excavations of houses and obsidian workshops. In 1988 a large-scale program of excavation of monumental architecture was initiated by Norberto González Crespo and Silvia Garza of the INAH. A new museum was built to house the spectacular finds of this project.

A 2009 concession granted to Canadian mining company Esperanza Silver threatens the site, according to archaeologist Silvia Garza Tarazona of the &quot;Centro del Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia&quot; (INAH) Morelos.

==Destruction of the city==

At some point around 900 CE the city of Xochicalco was burned and destroyed. Many of the excavated houses and temples have layers of burning and destruction that cover the deposits from the main Epiclassic occupation. Underneath destruction layers, numerous objects were left in place in the houses, indicating that the site was destroyed and abandoned quickly. A small remnant population lived on, however, on the lower slopes of the hill. Later, around 1200, the site was recolonized by the Nahuatl-speaking Tlahuica peoples, ancestors to the Nahuatl-speaking populations of the modern state of Morelos.

==Astronomical observatory==
The observatory is a cave modified to allow study of the movement of the sun. The cave was covered with stucco and painted black, yellow and red with a chimney that measured from the base to the surface 8.7 meters, and which is hexagonal in the top. The chimney has a slight slope allowing the sun&#x27;s rays to be to projected on the floor of the cave.

In the 105 days running from 30 April to 15 August, the sun shines into the cave. In the sun&#x27;s movement towards the Tropic of Cancer and upon their return, respectively, on 14/15 May and 28/29 July, the sun is at its zenith and the astronomical noon, the beam of light falls directly through the chimney showing the image of the sun on the floor of the cave. Surely, taking advantage of the solar phenomenon, the site was also used for religious ceremonies.

<doc id="355529" wikidata="Q2237537" url="?curid=355529" title="Battle of Fallen Timbers">
<text>The Battle of Fallen Timbers (20 August 1794) was the final battle of the Northwest Indian War, a struggle between Native American tribes affiliated with the Northwestern Confederacy and their British allies, against the nascent United States for control of the Northwest Territory. The battle took place amid trees toppled by a tornado near the Maumee River in northwestern Ohio at the site of the present-day city of Maumee, Ohio.

Major General &quot;Mad Anthony&quot; Wayne&#x27;s Legion of the United States, supported by General Charles Scott&#x27;s Kentucky Militia, were victorious against a combined Native American force of Shawnee under Blue Jacket, Ottawas under Egushawa, and many others. The battle was brief, lasting little more than one hour, but it scattered the confederated Native American forces. The U.S. victory ended major hostilities in the region. The following Treaty of Greenville and Jay Treaty forced Native American displacement from most of modern-day Ohio, opening it to White American settlement, along with withdrawal of the British presence from the southern Great Lakes region of the United States.

==Prelude==
In the 1783 Treaty of Paris, which ended the American Revolutionary War, Great Britain ceded rights to the region northwest of the Ohio River and south of the Great Lakes. Despite the treaty, which ceded the Northwest Territory to the United States, the British maintained a military presence in their forts there and continued policies that supported the Native Americans to slow American expansion. With the encroachment of European-American settlers west of the Appalachians after the War, a Huron-led confederacy formed in 1785 to resist the usurpation of Indian lands, declaring that lands north and west of the Ohio River were Indian territory. The young United States formally organized the region in the Land Ordinance of 1785 and negotiated treaties allowing settlement, but the Western Confederacy of Native American nations were not party to these treaties and refused to acknowledge them. Violence erupted in the area between Native Americans and U.S. settlers in the region and in Kentucky.

In George Washington&#x27;s first term as President of the United States, the U.S. launched two major campaigns to subdue the Western Confederacy and protect American colonizers from Indian attacks. The Harmar campaign in 1790 resulted in a significant victory for the confederacy and a U.S. retreat to Fort Washington. In May 1791, Lieutenant Colonel James Wilkinson launched what he thought was a clever raid at the Battle of Kenapacomaqua, Wilkinson killed 9 Wea and Miami, and captured 34 Miami as prisoners, including a daughter of Miami war chief Little Turtle. Many of the confederation leaders were considering terms of peace to present to the United States, but when they received news of Wilkinson&#x27;s raid, they readied for war. Wilkinson&#x27;s raid thus had the opposite effect, uniting the tribes against St. Clair. In 1791, a follow-up campaign was led by territorial governor Arthur St. Clair, which was decimated by combined native forces.

Following this devastating defeat, the area was now open to attacks from the British and or their allied native tribes in the west. The U.S. quickly appointed envoys to negotiate peace with the Confederacy. Meanwhile, President Washington commissioned Major General &quot;Mad&quot; Anthony Wayne to recruit, and train a more effective, and larger force. If peace negotiations failed, Wayne was to bring U.S. sovereignty to the new borders. Wayne commanded about 2,000 men, with Joseph Bartholomew, Choctaw and Chickasaw men serving as his scouts. In the spring of 1793, Wayne moved the Legion from Pennsylvania downriver to Fort Washington, at a camp Wayne named Hobson&#x27;s Choice because they had no other options.

When Wayne received news that a grand council of the confederacy had not reached a peace agreement with U.S. negotiators, he moved his army north into Indian held territory. In November, the Legion built a new fort north of Fort Jefferson, which Wayne named Fort Greeneville. The Legion wintered here, but Wayne dispatched a detachment of about 300 men on 23 December to quickly build Fort Recovery on the site of St. Clair&#x27;s defeat and recover the cannons lost there in 1791. In response, the British built Fort Miami to block Wayne&#x27;s advance and to protect Fort Lernoult in Detroit. In January 1794, Wayne reported to Knox that 8 companies and a detachment of artillery under Major Henry Burbeck had claimed St. Clair&#x27;s battleground and had already built a small fort. By June, Fort Recovery had been reinforced, and the Legion had recovered four copper cannons (two six-pound and two three-pound), two copper howitzers, and one iron carronade. The fort was attacked that month, and although the Legion suffered heavy casualties, they maintained control of the fort, and the battle exposed divisions within the confederacy.

Before departing Fort Recovery, Wayne sent a final offer of peace with two captured prisoners to the leaders of the confederation at Roche de Bout. The confederacy leaders debated among themselves. Little Turtle declared Wayne as a &quot;the Chief who never sleeps,&quot; and recommended that the confederation should negotiate peace with Wayne. Blue Jacket mocked Little Turtle as a traitor and convinced the others that Wayne would be defeated, just as Harmar and St. Clair had been. Little Turtle then relinquished leadership to Blue Jacket, stating that he would only be a follower. The perceived cracks in the united confederacy concerned the British, who sent reinforcements to Fort Miami on the Maumee River.

Wayne departed Fort Recovery on 17 August and pushed north, buttressed by about 1,000 mounted Kentucky militia under General Charles Scott. Native American scouts noted that the Legion only marched until early afternoon, then stopped to build a fortified encampment, making attack on camps less practical than in previous US campaigns. The Legion constructed Fort Adams and Fort Defiance, so named from a declaration by Charles Scott that &quot;I defy the English, Indians, and all the devils of hell to take it.&quot; Finally, as the Legion approached Fort Miami, Wayne stopped to build Fort Deposit as a baggage camp so that the Legion could go into battle as light infantry.

==Battle==

Captain William Wells, Little Turtle&#x27;s son-in-law and the commander of Wayne&#x27;s intelligence company, was wounded along with some of his spies after they were identified spying in a Native American camp the night of 11 August. The Choctaw and Chickasaw scouts left the Legion at Fort Defiance after seeing how sick Wayne had become on the campaign. Wayne therefore ordered Captain George Shrim, commander of the Legion&#x27;s ranger detachment, to lead a party of mounted scouts. On 18 August, Native American forces captured one of the scouts, William May, from whom they learned that Wayne intended to attack on the 19th, unless he stopped to build a supply depot, in which case he would attack on the 20th. Alexander McKee urged the confederacy to choose a suitable battlefield, since they knew the date of the attack. Suspecting that Wayne would march along the Maumee River, Blue Jacket took a defensive position not far from present-day Toledo, Ohio, where a stand of trees (the &quot;fallen timbers&quot;) had been blown down by a storm. The tangled debris stretched for nearly a mile, and the heavy brush created a natural abatis which would protect the confederate warriors. The Native American forces, numbering about 1,500, comprised Blue Jacket&#x27;s Shawnees, Delawares led by Buckongahelas, Miamis led by Little Turtle, Wyandots led by Tarhe and Roundhead, Ojibwas, Odawa led by Egushawa, Potawatomi led by Little Otter, Mingos, a small detachment of Mohawks, and a British company of Canadian militiamen dressed as Native Americans under Lieutenant Colonel William Caldwell. After taking their positions starting on 17–18 August, the Native forces fasted in preparation for battle.

Brigadier General Wilkinson urged Wayne to attack with haste before the native forces could assemble, but Wayne opted to fortify Fort Deposit. On the 19th, Wayne sent a battalion of mounted scouts under Major William Price to reconnoiter the area. They encountered a number of confederate positions, but no shots were fired. At the end of that day, a confederate council was held, and it was determined that as Wayne might prepare for battle for several days, their warriors would be given permission to eat the next morning.

The Legion advanced early the next morning, 20 August, while the Native Americans were on their 3rd day of fasting. Due to morning rains, many warriors in the confederacy assumed there would be no battle, and retired to Fort Miami to break their fast. Suspecting contact, Wayne ordered the Legion to march in compacted columns, and distributed the dragoons and artillery in the center of the column so that they could respond to an attack from any direction. A battalion of mounted Kentucky militia led the column, and had difficulty with the terrain. The lead scouts were only about 100 yards into the center of the chosen battlefield when the Odawas and Potawatomis under Little Otter and Egushawa fired their first volley, scattering the militia. Behind the militia were two companies of infantry from the 4th Sub-Legion under Captain John Cook, and he directed their initial volley at the Kentuckians, whom he considered to be fleeing the battle. Soon, however, Cook&#x27;s detachment fled the scene as advancing warriors initiated hand-to-hand fighting.

The fleeing U.S. forces ran towards the left wing of the Legion&#x27;s column, where Lieutenant Colonel Jean François Hamtramck commanded the 2nd and 4th sub-legions. They broke through Captain Howell Lewis&#x27; company, which fell back without firing a shot. Hamtramck, meanwhile, formed his wing into two ranks to halt the pursuing warriors, many of whom were armed with only tomahawks and knives, and General Wilkinson formed the 1st and 3rd sub-legions into one extended line covering 800 yards of the right wing. Wayne rushed to the sound of the muskets, and quickly deployed two light infantry companies from the center ahead of each wing, to halt any confederate advances until the lines could be properly formed. Artillery was brought to the front and blasted the Native American line with grapeshot. Blue Jacket&#x27;s well-organized ambush was now in disarray, as the center elements had rushed forward while the wings had remained in position. When asked for orders by his aide-de-camp, Lieutenant William Henry Harrison, Wayne responded &quot;Charge the damned rascals with the bayonet!&quot;

Captain Robert Campbell charged first, leading his company of dragoons across 60–100 yards with sabres drawn. Nearly a dozen of the dragoons were shot in the attack, and Captain Campbell was killed. Wilkinson&#x27;s dismounted infantry made a slow advance to support the dragoons, and the Odawas and Potawatomis ran and fled back to their positions. The pursuit was so lightly challenged that Wilkinson feared they were being led into a trap, and he paused to await instructions from Wayne.

Meanwhile, Lieutenant Colonel Hamtramck advanced at trail arms and encountered the Wyandots, Lenape, and Canadians. A heavy exchange of fire ensued, and the confederate forces attempted to flank the 4th sub-legion. Instead, a brigade of Kentucky militia under Brigadier General Robert Todd moved quickly through the swamp and flanked the Canadians. The 4th sub-legion pursued with fixed bayonets. The confederated forces retreated from their original positions, and were unable to effectively re-form in the rough terrain.

Wilkinson eventually resumed a cautious advance along the ridge high above the Maumee River. On route to Fort Miami, the Native forces had to cross a ravine. The Odawa and Potawatomi attempted to regroup here. Egushawa was in command, but was wounded when he was shot through the eye. Little Otter was severely wounded, and was thrown on the back of a white horse and evacuated so he could not be captured by the Legion. Another Odawa chief, Turkey Foot, stood atop a large rock and urged the warriors to make their stand, but he was shot in the chest and died almost instantly. According to Alexander McKee, the loss of so many confederate leaders made the Native American losses seem greater than they actually were, and many warriors fled to Fort Miami.

Beyond the ravine, the landscape was much more open, allowing the Legion to advance more quickly and giving dragoons a frightening advantage over dismounted warriors. McKee, Matthew Elliot, and Simon Girty tried to rally the retreating forces one last time, but they were largely ignored. The retreat became a disorganized rout, except for the rear guard protection provided by the Canadians and Wyandots.

The entire battle lasted an hour and ten minutes. The Indian warriors fled towards Fort Miami but were surprised to find the gates closed against them. Major William Campbell, the commander of the fort, had closed the gates when the first warriors arrived and the sounds of musket fire came closer. He refused to open the gates now and give refuge to the Indian warriors, unwilling to start a war with the United States. The remnants of the Indian army continued north and reunited near Swan Creek, where their families were encamped. McKee tried to rally them once more, but they refused to fight again, especially after Campbell&#x27;s refusal to let them into Fort Miami.

Wayne&#x27;s army had lost 33 men and had about 100 wounded. They reported that they had found 30–40 dead warriors. Alexander McKee, an official of the British Indian Department, reported that the Indian confederacy lost 19 warriors killed, including Chief Turkey Foot of the Ottawa. Six white men fighting on the Native American side were also killed, and Chiefs Egushawa and Little Otter of the Ottawa were wounded.

===Post hoc===

Wayne&#x27;s army encamped for three days in sight of Fort Miami. When Campbell asked the meaning of the encampment, Wayne replied that the answer had already been given by the sound of their muskets and the retreat of the Indians. General Wayne had already determined that he could not take Fort Miami by force, because his howitzers were underpowered and he did not have enough provisions for an extended siege. Instead, to illustrate that the U.S. controlled the region, he rode alone to the walls of Fort Miami and slowly conducted an inspection of the fort&#x27;s exterior. The British garrison at Fort Miami debated whether or not to engage the Americans, but in the absence of orders and being already at war with France, Campbell declined to fire the first shot at U.S. forces. The Legion, meanwhile, destroyed Indian villages and crops in the region of Fort Deposit, and burned Alexander McKee&#x27;s trading post within sight of Fort Miami. Despite the provocations, the British refused to open the gates to the fort. Wayne was as unwilling to start a war with Britain as Campbell was to start a war with the United States, and so finally, on 26 August, the Legion departed for Fort Recovery.

Wayne expected a new attack, and even hoped for it while the Legion was at full strength. Although the Native Americans did not reform into a large army, small bands continued to harass the Legion&#x27;s perimeter, scouts, and supply trains. Although they resented the assignment, Wayne assigned the mounted militia to carry supplies between the chain of forts. On 12 September, Wayne issued invitations for peace negotiations, but they went unanswered. Finally, on 15 September, Wayne led the Legion from Fort Defiance and marched unopposed for two days to the Miami capital of Kekionga, where they constructed Fort Wayne. Wayne appointed Hamtramck as commandant of Fort Wayne and departed in late October, arriving at Fort Greenville on 2 November. That winter, Wayne also reinforced his line of defensive forts with Fort St. Marys, Fort Loramie, and Fort Piqua.

==Aftermath==

Throughout the campaign, Wayne&#x27;s second in command, General James Wilkinson, secretly tried to undermine him. Wilkinson wrote anonymous negative letters to local newspapers about Wayne and spent years writing negative letters to politicians in Washington, D. C. Wayne was unaware as Wilkinson was recorded as being extremely polite to Wayne in person. Wilkinson was also a Spanish spy at the time and was even hired as an officer. Despite the significant US losses, Wilkinson regarded Fallen Timbers as a mere skirmish, saying the short battle &quot;did not deserve the name of a battle.&quot; Years later, a Native American warrior reflected that Little Turtle had warned that the Great Spirit would hide in a cloud if they did not make peace with Wayne. The rainy start to the day was a sign that they would lose.

Parties began suing for peace in December. Antoine Lasselle arrived at Fort Wayne on 17 December with a group of Native Americans and Canadiens. Within a month, most Miami had returned to Kekionga, and representatives of the Potawatomi, Ojibwe, Odawa, and Wyandotte had sought out the Legion to &quot;bury the hatchet.&quot; During the summer of 1795, the confederacy met with a U.S. delegation led by General Wayne to negotiate the Treaty of Greenville, which was signed on 3 August. This treaty opened most of the modern U.S. state of Ohio to settlement, using the site of St. Clair&#x27;s defeat as a reference point to draw a line near the current border of Ohio and Indiana. The Treaty of Greenville, along with Jay&#x27;s Treaty and Pinckney&#x27;s Treaty, set the terms of the peace and defined post-colonial relations among the U.S., Britain and Spain.

Henry Knox eventually alerted Wayne about Wilkinson&#x27;s letters, and Wayne began an investigation. Wayne&#x27;s suspicions were confirmed when Spanish couriers were intercepted with payments for Wilkinson. He attempted to court martial Wilkinson for his treachery. However, Wayne developed a stomach ulcer, complications from gout, and died on 15 December 1796, at Fort Presque Isle.; there was no court-martial. Instead Wilkinson began his first tenure as Senior Officer of the Army, which lasted for about a year and a half. He continued to pass on intelligence to the Spanish in return for large sums in gold.

For decades following the battle, Odawas visited the battle site and left memorials at Turkey Foot Rock.

The Northwest would remain largely peaceful until the War of 1812. Wayne&#x27;s aide-de-camp, William Henry Harrison, became territorial secretary, then a member of Congress, and was appointed as governor of the Indiana Territory in 1801. He followed Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s policy of incremental land purchases from Native American nations. Tecumseh, a young Shawnee veteran of Fallen Timbers who refused to sign the Greenville Treaty, resisted this gradual removal with a new pan-tribal confederation. Harrison attacked this new confederation in the 1811 Battle of Tippecanoe.

Many veterans of the Battle of Fallen Timbers would become known for their later accomplishments, including William Clark, who co-led the Lewis and Clark Expedition, and William Henry Harrison, the 9th President of the United States. Tecumseh, who watched his older brother Sauwauseekau die in battle, would later organize a new confederacy to oppose American Indian removals.

==Legacy==

On 14 September 1929, the United States Post Office Department issued a stamp commemorating the 135th anniversary of the Battle of Fallen Timbers. The post office issued a series of stamps referred to as the &#x27;Two Cent Reds&#x27; by collectors, issued to commemorate the 150th Anniversaries of the many events that occurred during the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783) and to honor those who were there. The Fallen Timbers stamp features an image of the Battle of Fallen Timbers Monument, which was dedicated that same year.

===National Park===

For 200 years, the site of the Battle of Fallen Timbers was thought to be on the floodplain on the banks of the Maumee River, based upon documentation such as the map above and to the right (location of Fallen Timbers Monument). Dr. G. Michael Pratt, an anthropologist and faculty member at Heidelberg University (Ohio), correctly surmised the battlefield was 1/4 mile above the floodplain after considering documentation that described a ravine. The City of Toledo owned the area which was desirable for development. Although the City of Toledo initially refused archaeological exploration, in 1995 and 2001 Pratt was able to conduct archaeological surveys, which relied primarily on metal detection, which revealed musket balls, pieces of muskets, uniform buttons and a bayonet, confirming that major fighting had taken place at the site.

Because of Pratt&#x27;s archaeological work and advocacy of the Fallen Timbers Preservation Commission, the land was granted National Historic Site status in 1999. A federal grant allowed the Metroparks of the Toledo Area to purchase the land where the artifacts were found in 2001, and the site was developed into a park in affiliation with the National Park Service.
===Fallen Timbers State Monument===
The Ohio Historical Society maintains a small park at the site originally believed to have the main fighting (similar historic picture above and right). This site features the Battle of Fallen Timbers Monument, honoring both Major General Anthony Wayne and his army and Little Turtle and his warriors. Additionally, there are plaques describing the Battle of Fallen Timbers and honoring the several Indian tribes that participated. The main monument has tributes inscribed on each of its four sides honoring in turn, Wayne, the fallen soldiers, Little Turtle, and his Indian warriors. The park is located near Maumee in Lucas County. Turkey Foot Rock, marking the death place of Turkey Foot, is also at the site.

<doc id="355536" wikidata="Q7563131" url="?curid=355536" title="Sophora microphylla">
<text>Sophora microphylla, commonly known as weeping kōwhai and small-leaved kōwhai, is a species of flowering tree in the family Fabaceae native to New Zealand. It is the most widespread of the eight species of kōwhai (the New Zealand &quot;Sophora&quot;). It is also called South Island kōwhai, although this name is misleading as it is widely distributed throughout the main islands of the country.

Growing to tall and broad, it is an evergreen shrub or small tree. Each leaf is long with up to 40 pairs of shiny oval leaflets. It produces many racemes of pea-like yellow flowers from August or as early as May through to October. The specific epithet &quot;microphylla&quot; means &quot;small-leaved&quot;. The plant has smaller leaflets (around 3–6 mm long by 2–5 mm wide) and flowers (1.8-5.0 cm long) than the other well known species, &quot;Sophora tetraptera&quot; (large-leaved kōwhai). When young &quot;S. microphylla&quot; has a divaricating and bushy growth habit with many interlacing branches, which begins to disappear as the tree ages.

It occurs throughout the main islands of New Zealand, though is scarce in parts of Northland and parts of the eastern North Island from East Cape south to northern Wairarapa.

The cultivar &#x27;Hilsop&#x27; has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit. 

==Ecology==

&quot;Sophora microphylla&quot; is one of three known native species that hosts the native longhorn beetle &quot;Coptomma variegatum&quot;.

Its nectar is toxic to the honeybee.

== Pre-human forests ==
Studies of accumulated dried vegetation in the pre-human mid-late Holocene period suggests a low &quot;Sophora microphylla&quot; forest ecosystem in Central Otago that was used and perhaps maintained by giant moa birds, for both nesting material and food. Neither the forests nor moa existed when European settlers came to the area in the 1850s.

<doc id="355539" wikidata="Q15138174" url="?curid=355539" title="Christmas seal">
<text>Christmas seals are adhesive labels that are similar in appearance to postage stamps that are sold then affixed to mail during the Christmas season to raise funds and awareness for charitable programs. Christmas seals have become particularly associated with lung diseases such as tuberculosis, and with child welfare in general. They were first issued in Denmark beginning in 1904, with Sweden and Iceland following with issues that same year. Thereafter the use of Christmas seals proved to be popular and spread quickly around the world, with 130 countries producing their own issues.

Christmas Seals were sometimes mistaken for Christmas stamps used for postage, prompting the US Post Office to adopt a policy requiring seals to be affixed on the reverse side of a postcard or envelope, but the policy was generally unfavorable and often ignored, ultimately resulting in its withdrawal. Christmas seals exist in several varieties, most notably those first issued by the Red Cross and later by the National Tuberculosis Association with its red double barred cross on the face of the seal. Other charitable seals have been issued by state governments, religions and social organizations worldwide. Various governments have issued semi-postal postage stamps to raise funds for the Red Cross or other charitable causes. From the onset Christmas seals received much public acclaim and were soon sought after by collectors and postal historians. Today, as a collectable item, their monetary worth varies considerably.

== Danish origin ==
At the beginning of the 1900s tuberculosis was a greatly feared disease, and its harmful effects on children seemed particularly devastating.
In 1904, Einar Holbøll, a Danish postal clerk, developed the idea of adding an extra charitable stamp on mailed holiday greetings during Christmas. The money raised would be used to help children sick with tuberculosis. The plan was approved by the Postmaster and the King of Denmark (Christian IX). Prior to his death in 1927 Holboell was knighted by the king of Denmark for his contributions in the effort to fight tuberculosis and for associating Christmas with the need to help those afflicted with the disease. He was also honored by a number of other countries, including the United States, for his efforts.

In 1904, the world&#x27;s first Christmas seal was issued in Denmark, bearing the likeness of the Danish Queen (Louise of Hesse-Kassel) and the word &quot;Julen&quot; (Christmas). Over 4 million were sold in the first year at DKK 0.02 per seal, raising more than $18,000, which in 1904 was a considerable sum of money. The following year the sale of Christmas Seals brought even more money to the fight against tuberculosis.

During the first six years, enough funds were raised to build the Christmas Seal Sanatorium in Kolding, which was opened in 1911. The same year the sanatorium was transferred to the administration of the Danish National Association to Combat Tuberculosis as it was considered a waste of resources to have two organizations working towards the same purpose. Fundraising would successfully continue via Christmas Seals for years to come.

The Danish Christmas Seal Committee, today known as Julemærkefonden (the Christmas Seal Fund), decided at that time to put all future collected funds to use in building and operating convalescent homes for children.


In 1958 a controversy over the appearance of Santa Claus on a Danish Christmas seal started when Rev. Paul Nedergad, a Copenhagen clergyman, referred to Santa Claus as a &quot;pagan goblin&quot;. He insisted that people should find another way to help the charitable cause to fight tuberculosis and boycott the Christmas seal in question. Most of the people of Denmark, however, paid little attention to Negerdard&#x27;s comment and continued to buy the Christmas seals that depicted Santa Claus.

== United States ==
At the beginning of the 20th century the United States was also experiencing a tuberculosis outbreak of epidemic proportions. At the time the only practical way to treat the disease was confining those afflicted in a sanatorium. Most of these facilities, however, were in dire need of funding and were faced with closure. One such facility was located in Brandywine, Delaware, and almost at the point of its termination, where a doctor, Joseph Wales, remembered his cousin Emily Bissell who was experienced in fundraising efforts. He subsequently sent her a letter relating the situation his sanatorium was facing. Bissell was touched by his letter and sent out looking for ways to raise the $300 needed for her cousin&#x27;s sanatorium to remain open.

The great success of Christmas seals in Europe prompted Danish born Jacob Riis, a muckraking journalist, photographer and a friend of Theodore Roosevelt, to write an editorial advocating their sale in America. The editorial and the great success Christmas Seals brought to charitable efforts in Europe in 1904 was a great source of inspiration to Emily Bissell who pursued the prospect in the United States and organized the production and sale of Christmas seals in America. Bissell likewise hoped to raise money for her cousin&#x27;s sanatorium on the Brandywine Creek in Delaware. Bissell went on to design a Delaware local Christmas seal, the first to be issued in the United States, in 1907. Christmas seals generated $3000 in the first year. By 1909 sales generated $250,000. It became clear to the Red Cross sales of Christmas seals should continue as an independent enterprise. The Director of the American Red Cross, Ernest P. Bicknell, was a member of the Board of Directors of the National Tuberculosis Association, now in its sixth year of operation. Bicknell along with Dr. Livingston Farrand, a member of the faculty of Columbia University proceeded in the summer of 1910 to arrange a partnership in the sale of Christmas Seals with the Red Cross, which lasted until 1920, when the Red Cross turned over the entire Christmas seal operation to the National Tuberculosis Association. In the succeeding years sales grew continuously, from three thousand dollars in 1907 to 26 million dollars by 1955.

Initially printed by the Lithograph process, the seals were sold in post office lobbies across the United States. The first U.S. Christmas seal of 1907 was initially sold on December 7, 1907 in Wilmington, Delaware by the Delaware Chapter of the American Red Cross, at a penny each. By 1908, Bissell&#x27;s idea grew to a national program administered by the National Association for the Study and Prevention of Tuberculosis (NASPT) Christmas seals issued from 1908 to 1918 were issued nationally by the American National Red Cross. Net proceeds from the sales would be divided equally between the two organizations. Beginning in 1919 when the National Tuberculosis Association assumed operations of Christmas seal production all seals bore the red double-barred cross in the designs.
The Christmas seals issued in 1918 have an unusual history apart from all the others, in that they were not sold to the general public that year. Issued during World War I they were only given to members of the American Red Cross so as not to compete with other fund-raising drives for the war effort. Issued only in booklet panes of ten, there are no known sheets of 100 of this issue.

By 1920, the Red Cross withdrew from the arrangement and sales were conducted exclusively by the NASPT, then known as the National Tuberculosis Association (NTA). Issues from 1920 to 1937; by the National Tuberculosis and Respiratory Disease Association (NTDRA); from 1968 to 1972 and the American Lung Association from 1973 to the present The NTRDA became the American Lung Association in 1973, though the 1974 seals and those issued thereafter continue to show the NTRDA inscription on the sheet margin.
Often times two or more different printers were employed to produce a given Christmas seal, producing a seal that was identical to the other such printings. To distinguish between the various printings the Christmas Seal Society deemed it appropriate that each printer add his own printer&#x27;s mark to one of the seals in a sheet of 100, usually in the middle of the sheet. Printer&#x27;s marks usually consisted of a small letter within the design of the seal. The addition of printer&#x27;s marks was initiated in 1926 and continued until 1997.

Local Christmas seals also began to emerge during this time and have existed alongside national issues in the US since 1907, and are also catalogued by the Christmas Seal &amp; Charity Stamp Society.

The first real-life people were not featured on U.S. Christmas seals until the 1938 seals were issued. They featured notables in the fight against tuberculosis, including Einar Holbøll, Robert Koch, René Laennec and Edward Livingston Trudeau.

With the exception of the 1907 and 1908 issues, US Christmas seals were issued in sheets of 100 up until 1975, thereafter being issued in sheets of 54. Beginning in 1935 US Christmas seals were being printed in se-tenant, where there was more than one design of Christmas seals on a single sheet of one hundred Christmas seals. Beginning in 1970 sheets of Christmas seals sometimes each had an individual seal with its own design or depicted an overall scene, with each seal having a portion of that scene,similar to the way that puzzle pieces together displayed a scene or picture. 
Various promotional schemes were tried: in 1954 the small town of Saranac Lake, New York (home of the Adirondack Cottage Sanitarium) won a nationwide competition selling Christmas seals, the reward for which was hosting the world premiere of the Paul Newman film &quot;The Silver Chalice&quot;; the cast participated in a parade in the town&#x27;s annual winter carnival. Other ideas were employed in the effort to promote Christmas seals, including postmark/cancellations and various forms of advertising, shown in the examples below.
Aside from Christmas seals issued nationally by the Red Cross and the National Tuberculosis Association, various states issued seals of their own. Beginning in 1927 the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, or NAACP, began issuing their own seals to bring awareness to the prejudice and other issues that affected African Americans.

Beginning in 1919 the sale of Christmas seals were sold in a form of a bond in order to accommodate big contributors to the fight against tuberculosis. The range of denominations of the bonds ranged from $5 up to $1000. Variations and changes in the design changed from year to year.

Today the Christmas seals benefit the American Lung Association and other lung related issues. Tuberculosis was declining, but recently has been on the rise. Tuberculosis is still one of the most common major infectious diseases in the world. In 1987 the American Lung Association acquired a trademark for the term &quot;Christmas Seals&quot; to protect their right to be the sole US national fundraising Association to issue them. Of course, this trademark would not apply to Christmas seals issued outside the US or local and regional Christmas seals, used in the US by many organizations since 1907 when the Kensington Dispensary in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, issued their own local Christmas seal.
== Canada ==

By 1908, the campaign had reached Canada. Interested people in Toronto and Hamilton, Ontario began Christmas seal campaigns to build and support sanatoriiums, as tuberculosis hospitals were then called. The &quot;Toronto Globe&quot; came promptly to their aid. Early in December, the &quot;Globe&quot; began running a daily story on the front page giving news of the campaign. The column was bordered by holly so that readers could easily spot it. One story told how the children of 58 Toronto schools had sold 10,000 Christmas seals. Another issue announced that out in Regina, Saskatchewan another paper, the &quot;Regina Leader&quot;, had written to say its staff would sell the seals and send the money back for the sanatorium being built in Muskoka.

From Saint John, New Brunswick, the Rev. G. A. Moore wrote to say that he and other volunteers would sell 8,500 and send the money to Toronto for its sanatorium. That first year, the Toronto campaign brought in $7,358.65 (the equivalent of almost $200,000 today).and Hamilton citizens gave $1,244.40. Year by year, other cities across Canada tried the Christmas seal campaign as a means not only of raising money but of creating the awareness that tuberculosis could be controlled.

Finally, in 1927, it was agreed that the Christmas seal campaign was to be the official method for tuberculosis associations to appeal to the public for funds. A national seal was established. Christmas seal campaigns have played an important role in public health. At first, the money raised was used for the new and badly needed sanatorium. When these were established, Christmas seal funds were used for tuberculosis prevention. The seals have paid for millions of Canadians to have chest X-ray or tuberculin tests. As a result, thousands of tuberculosis cases were discovered before disease spread to others. The Canadian Lung Association&#x27;s Christmas seals continue to symbolize the grassroots support of Canadians that helped win the fight against tuberculosis.

== Europe ==
Soon after Denmark issued the first Christmas seal, Sweden and Iceland followed Seals then spread throughout Scandinavia and every major country in Europe, and are still popular today. Christmas seals have been issued by hundreds of different societies, nationally, and locally in Asia, Africa, North and South America, and Australia. The majority of all tuberculosis seals since then were issued at Christmas time and included the international symbol against tuberculosis, the double barred Cross of Lorraine.
===Semi-postals===
Various governments from around the world have also issued semi-postal postage stamps to help raise funds for the Red Cross and for the fight against tuberculosis, with countries like France, Spain and Belgium having produced hundreds. Beginning in the First World War France issued semi-postal stamps to raise funds for Red Cross who were overwhelmed by the many thousands of people who were wounded during the war. Eventually the French colonies were also producing semi-postals. The idea of semi-postals helping fund the Red Cross soon spread among the countries that were affected by the war, with more than 230 different semi-postals issued by 47 countries. Spain and its colonies rivaled those of France with approximately 150 semi-postals issued.

France began issuing semi-postals to raise funds for the Red Cross in 1918, all of which bear the red cross symbol.

Belgium issued charity stamps in the form of semi-postals, with the denomination on the right going to a charitable cause. The first such issues were released in 1914.
The other European countries that have issued semi-postal stamps for the Red Cross and various tuberculosis foundations include Belgium, Finland, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, among others.

== Other countries ==

Nearly one hundred different lung associations worldwide issue Christmas seals. Many different countries issue their own Christmas seals, as well as cities, states and territories. Green&#x27;s Catalog, considered by many collectors as the bible of US and worldwide tuberculosis Christmas seal collecting would distinguish them as national versus local Christmas seals. Many tuberculosis seal issuing societies are members of the International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease, which holds a Christmas seal contest for best design among their Organizational and Constituent seal issuing members at their annual World Conference on Lung Health.
Korea, after much effort to sell the idea in of raising funds to combat tuberculosis there, issued its first Christmas seal in 1933. Charged with this effort, the Korean Medical Missionary Association formed a committee. All religions and nationalities in Korea were represented, and it received funds and aid from the Church of England, the United Church of Canada as well as various health organizations within Korea itself.

Mexico, through the Comite Nacional de Lucha contra la Tuberculosis, in their effort to fight the dreaded lung disease, issued its first Christmas seals in 1943.
==Usage==

Beginning in 1907 when Christmas seals were first issued the incident of seals used in place of postage stamps became a common problem. Subsequently, by 1911 the U.S. Post Office adopted a policy that prohibited the placement of Christmas Seals on the same side of a postcard or envelope as the address. By 1930 the problem became less prevalent.

Before 1930 nearly all Christmas Seals found on U.S. mail were used on Christmas greetings postcards, as there were no commercial Christmas Cards with envelopes and postage for postcards was only a penny. Today postcards with Christmas seals tied on with a postmark with the same year date as the Christmas seal for that year are not common and often scarce, and in some instances rare.


==Other types==
Many other seals to raise funding for charitable efforts were issued during Christmas season, often with Christmas themes, by religious organizations, civic and fraternal societies, patriotic organizations, etc. Since they were not issued to fight tuberculosis specifically they lack the double barred Cross of Lorraine, the international symbol for the fight against tuberculosis, which was proposed and established in 1902 at the International Conference on Tuberculosis in Berlin Germany, and strictly speaking do not qualify as what is commonly known as Christmas seals.
Between 1937 and 1943 the Danish Nazi Party (DNSAP) issued a variety of seals featuring the Nazi swastika.&gt; These scarce seals contain Christmas themes like holly, but there is no indication on these seals that connect them to the fight against tuberculosis, and for this reason, they are not listed in Green&#x27;s Catalog.

Authorized by the Vatican, The Holy Childhood Association Program was founded in 1843 to be of service to schools and religious education programs. The Association distributes educational and fund-raising programs to school and religious education programs throughout the United States. To help bring recognition and raise funding for the program.the Holy Childhood foundation issues their own type of Christmas seal for sale at various Catholic Churches and other institutions.
History has shown that most dictatorial regimes suspend Christmas seals from being issued. This happened in Korea under the Japanese occupation, China under the communists, and Argentina under Eva Peron.

==Collecting==

When Christmas seals first appeared at the beginning of the 20th century they received much favor and acclaim from the general public, and from stamp and postal history collectors in particular. Prices for the various issues can range from inexpensive, to moderately priced to those of considerable value, depending on availability, type, centering and condition. The catalogue value of a Christmas seal, as with postage stamps and coins, usually increases over time. For example, in 1935 the Scott Catalogue value for a Christmas seal issued in 1915 was 25-cents. In 1983 its catalogue value increased to $4. By 2014 the Scott Catalogue Value was fixed at $9.00. Used seals, and those with no gum and/or have a straight edge on one side, usually command about one-half the price of a seal in unused, (mint) fine to very fine (F-VF) condition.

In cases where a Christmas seal is tied alongside a postage stamp, with a postmark with the same year date in which the given Christmas seal was issued often commands much higher prices than those that have been cancelled and are no longer affixed to a postcard or envelope. As with various postage stamps, Christmas seals that exist in a &#x27;block of four&#x27; are often scarce and can increase the value much higher than what four separate Christmas seals might be worth. On December 4, 2014, a postcard bearing a rare variety of a 1911, type 5, considered the rarest U.S. Christmas seal, sold at auction on eBay for a record amount of $$3,433.83. The postcard was postmarked December 20, 1911, at Station C in Los Angeles and mailed to Fort Wayne, Indiana In another definitive example, a 1919 issue U.S. Christmas seal of a rare type was sold at auction and realized a price of $3,872,533.

In the United States beginning in 1936, the town of Santa Claus, Indiana has often been regarded by many collectors as the &quot;official&quot; First Day City for the initial release of Christmas seal issues in the United States. Special cacheted covers were often prepared in quantities that range from 500 to 2000. The quantities produced were documented for many years by The Christmas Seal and Charity Stamp Society members Joe Wheeler and Jerry Grigaitis. In 1936 the Santa Claus Postmaster would not allow the seals to be tied by a postmark, however, that policy was sometimes overlooked and a few covers received a postmark. Such covers command a substantial premium in the collecting world.

One of the oldest Christmas seal societies of service to collectors of Christmas seals is The Christmas Seal and Charity Stamp Society, founded in 1931, an affiliate of the American Philatelic Society. It functions as a source of information for collectors and publishes a quarterly journal, &quot;Seal News&quot;, and a large catalog of Christmas seal collecting literature. They also conduct auctions through each issue of their journal.

<text>The Treaty of Greenville, also known to Americans as the Treaty with the Wyandots, etc., but formally titled &quot;A treaty of peace between the United States of America, and the tribes of Indians called the Wyandots, Delawares, Shawanees, Ottawas, Chippewas, Pattawatimas, Miamis, Eel Rivers, Weas, Kickapoos, Piankeshaws, and Kaskaskias&quot; was a 1795 treaty between the United States and indigenous nations of the Northwest Territory (now Midwestern United States), including the Wyandot and Delaware peoples, that redefined the boundary between indigenous peoples&#x27; lands and territory for United States community settlement.

It was signed at Fort Greenville, now Greenville, Ohio, on August 3, 1795, following the Native American loss at the Battle of Fallen Timbers a year earlier in August 1794. It ended the Northwest Indian War of 1785-1795 in the Ohio Country of the old Northwest Territory (1787-1803), and limited Indian country to remaining lands of northwestern Ohio, and began the practice of annual payments of goods, supplies and food, following the land concessions. The parties to the treaty were a coalition of Native American tribes known as the Western Confederacy, and the United States government represented by new United States Army General Anthony Wayne (1745-1796), and local frontiersmen.

The treaty became synonymous with the end of the American frontier in the eastern United States, in that part of the old Northwest Territory that would become the new state of Ohio and other adjacent future federal territories and future states around the Great Lakes and further west to the Mississippi River.

==Participants==

General &quot;Mad Anthony&quot; Wayne (1745-1796), who had led the newly-organized United States Army victory at the Battle of Fallen Timbers and led the American federal government delegation. Other members included William Wells (c.1770-1812), William Henry Harrison (1773-1841), (future first Governor of Indiana Territory (1801-1812), U.S. Representative (congressman) and later U.S. Senator from Ohio, and ninth President, served March-April 1841), Caleb Swan (1758-1809), William Clark (1770-1838), and Meriwether Lewis (1774-1809) - the last two to become more famous a decade later (and for the subsequent two and quarter centuries), leading the Lewis and Clark exploring expedition (Corps of Discovery) of 1804-1806, into the new western Louisiana Purchase of 1803, up the Missouri River across the Great Plains, through the passes of the Rocky Mountains, to the Pacific Northwest region and the West Coast of North America on the Pacific Ocean and returning.

Native Americans leaders who signed the Fort Greenville treaty included leaders of these bands and tribes: Wyandot (chiefs Tarhe, Roundhead, and Leatherlips), Delaware (several bands including Chief Buckongahelas). Shawnee (chiefs Blue Jacket and Black Hoof), Ottawa (several bands, including Egushawa), Chippewa, Potawatomi (23 signatories, including Gomo, Siggenauk, Black Partridge, Topinabee, and Five Medals), Miami (including Jean Baptiste Richardville, White Loon, and Little Turtle), Wea, Kickapoo, and Kaskaskia.

Following their defeat at the Battle of Fallen Timbers in August 1794, and subsequent scorched earth tactics, General Wayne had courted the favor of several key leaders within the Western Confederacy. Wayne brought food supplies, and material for crops and promised to continue delivering new supplies. Blue Jacket, the Shawnee war chief who had led the Native American force at Fallen Timbers, encouraged others to accept Wayne&#x27;s offered terms for peace. Tarhe declared that the victory at Fallen Timbers was evidence that the Great Spirit favored the newly-arrived white men from across the mountains to the east and ocean, called Americans. Opposition to the United States was led by Little Turtle who, ironically, had advised against engaging Wayne at Fallen Timbers. For a week, Wayne urged the native tribes to accept peace based on previous terms given at the earlier agreements of the Treaty of Fort McIntosh, Treaty of Fort Finney, and Treaty of Fort Harmar, but Little Turtle countered that the Miami Tribe were not party to these treaties and would not recognize them, and that they were invalid because they were made with people who had no original right to the lands that they had sold.

General Wayne revealed to the chiefs that the U.S. Senate in Washington had recently ratified the Jay Treaty, between the Americans and the British, and what that would mean on the western frontier, 
ensuring that Great Britain in northern Canada (Quebec and Ontario]), would no longer be providing additional aid, supplies, firearms and ammunition to the Native Americans. Tarhe confirmed that previous treaties had been signed by chiefs who were at Greenville and warned his fellow Indigenous tribal leaders that Wayne had the military power to take all of their lands if they did not negotiate. Little Turtle and the Miami remained the lone dissent in the natives&#x27; confederacy. At a private council between Wayne and Little Turtle on August 12, Wayne argued that the Miami chief was standing against the will of the confederacy majority. Little Turtle reluctantly signed, stating that he was the last to sign, and would therefore be the last to break the treaty, even though he disagreed with the terms.

The day after the Treaty of Greenville was signed, Little Turtle&#x27;s wife died in camp. She was carried to a grave by U.S. Army soldiers and given a three-gun salute of typical American military ceremonies.

The treaty was signed back in the temporary United States federal national capital city of Philadelphia, by first President George Washington and submitted and later ratified by the United States Senate on December 22, 1795.

==Terms==
The treaty consisted of ten articles.

===Land for annuity===
The treaty established what became known as the Greenville Treaty Line, as delineated below. For several years, it distinguished Native American territory from lands open to European-American settlers, who, however, continued to encroach. In exchange for goods to the value of $20,000 (such as blankets, utensils, and domestic animals), the Native American tribes ceded to the United States large parts of modern-day Ohio.

The treaty also established the &quot;annuity&quot; system of payment in return for Native American cessions of land east of the treaty line. Yearly grants of federal money and supplies of calico cloth to Native American tribes. That institutionalized continuing government influence in tribal affairs and gave outsiders considerable control over Native American life.

===Treaty line===
The treaty redefined with slight modifications the boundaries in Ohio established previously by the Treaty of Fort McIntosh in 1785 and reasserted in the Treaty of Fort Harmar in 1789. In particular, the western boundary, which formerly ran northwesterly to the Maumee River, now ran southerly to the Ohio River.

Ohio had developed settlements and defined tracts of land prior to 1795, including the Western Reserve, the Seven Ranges survey area, the Virginia Military District, Symmes Purchase, and two Ohio Company purchases, all in eastern and southern Ohio, as well as the line of western forts built by Wayne through Fort Recovery along the Great Miami River valley. The boundary line would need to encompass all those territories, covering about two thirds of Ohio Country.

The treaty line began at the mouth of the Cuyahoga River in present-day Cleveland and ran south along the river to the portage between the Cuyahoga and Tuscarawas Rivers in what is now Akron, then through the Portage Lakes area between Akron and Canton. The line continued down the Tuscarawas to Fort Laurens, near present-day Bolivar. From there, the line ran west-southwest to near present-day Fort Loramie on a branch of the Great Miami River. From there, the line ran west-northwest to Fort Recovery on the Wabash River near the present-day boundary between Ohio and Indiana. From Fort Recovery, the line ran south-southwest to the Ohio River at a point opposite the mouth of the Kentucky River in present-day Carrollton, Kentucky. Rufus Putnam, who had been appointed by George Washington as surveyor general of the United States, surveyed and marked the Treaty Line.

===Other parcels of land===
There were also other forts along the Great Lakes, such as Fort Miamis and other forts in Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio that the British had agreed to cede to the United States in the 1783 Treaty of Paris but had yet to evacuate. In Indiana, there was the Vincennes Tract, Clark&#x27;s Grant, and the settlement at Ouiatenon to protect.

The treaty also permitted established US Army posts and allocated strategic reserved tracts within the Indian Country to the north and the west of the ceded lands, the most important of which was the future site of Fort Dearborn (now Downtown Chicago) on Lake Michigan. Other American lands within Indian Country included Fort Detroit, Ouiatenon, Fort Wayne, Fort Miami, and Fort Sandusky.

The treaty exempted established settlements at St. Vincennes, General Clark&#x27;s grant, various French settlements, and Fort Massac from relinquishment.

===Miscellaneous provisions===
The United States renounced all claims to indigenous peoples&#x27; lands not within the treaty line in Ohio or parcels exempted. The indigenous groups were obliged to recognize the United States as the sole sovereign power in the entire territory, but the local peoples would otherwise have free use of their own lands as long as they were kindly disposed to American settlers. The treaty also arranged for an exchange of prisoners and specified the parties that would be responsible for enforcing the boundary and punishing transgressions.

==Criticism==
After the signing of the treaty, the so-called &quot;peace chiefs&quot;—such as Little Turtle—who advocated for cooperation with the United States, were roundly criticized by Shawnee chief Tecumseh, who stated that the peace chiefs had given away land that they did not own. Tecumseh fought against the Americans during the War of 1812 and was killed in battle in 1813.

==Aftermath==

The negotiated peace was only temporary. Anthony Wayne who promised to protect the treaty would die a year later. A Spanish spy James Wilkinson would take command of his army. Continuing encroachments by settlers on Indian Country north and west of the treaty line (and of future treaty lines established by the Treaty of Vincennes, Treaty of Grouseland, and Treaty of Fort Wayne of 1809), especially in Indiana, would lead a disgruntled Tecumseh, who had not signed the Treaty of Greenville, to reform the Confederacy at Prophetstown over the following decade. Unrest among the tribes culminated in the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811, a major defeat for indigenous nations that may have contributed to their siding with the British in the War of 1812.

The Treaty of Greenville closed the frontier in the Northwest Territory. Thereafter began a series of purchases of indigenous peoples&#x27; lands by treaty and Indigenous tribe removals by law throughout the territory and its successors, interrupted briefly by the War of 1812. Indians were moved west of the Mississippi River to Indian Country reservations in what later became the state of Oklahoma in a process that culminated with the dismantling of the Great Miami Reserve in Indiana by treaties in the 1830s. By 1840, the Old Northwest was essentially clear of indigenous peoples. Future conflicts would all be west of the Mississippi.

The treaty line would become the southwestern boundary of the Northwest Territory at its division in 1800. Upon Ohio statehood in 1803, the western boundary of Ohio ran due north from a place on the Ohio River somewhat east of the south-southwesterly treaty line, leaving a sliver of land called &quot;The Gore&quot; in what is today southeastern Indiana remaining as part of the Northwest Territory. &quot;The Gore&quot; was ceded to Indiana Territory at that time, and became Dearborn County in March 1803.

Meriwether Lewis and William Henry Harrison were both present at the treaty signing. The former would go on to launch the Lewis and Clark Expedition with William Clark in 1804, and the latter would later become the 9th President of the United States in 1841.

Fort Greenville was abandoned in 1796; it would be another 12 years before the settlement of Greenville, Ohio, was founded on the site.

It was the last treaty signed by Gen. Wayne, who died just over a year later, in December 1796.

Vantiva acquired CommScope&#x27;s Home Networks on 2 January 2024.

== History ==
=== 1892: The founding of the General Electric Company ===
Thomson was named after the electrical engineer Elihu Thomson, who was born in Manchester, England, on 26 March 1853. Thomson moved to Philadelphia, USA, at the age of 5, with his family. Thomson formed the Thomson-Houston Electric Company in 1879 with Edwin Houston. The company merged with the Edison General Electric Company to become the General Electric Company in 1892. In 1893, the &quot;Compagnie Française Thomson-Houston&quot; (CFTH) was formed in Paris, a sister company to GE in the United States. It was from this company that the modern Thomson Group would evolve.

In 1966, CFTH merged with Hotchkiss-Brandt to form Thomson-Houston-Hotchkiss-Brandt (soon renamed Thomson-Brandt). In 1968, the electronics business of Thomson-Brandt merged with Compagnie Générale de Télégraphie Sans Fil (CSF) to form Thomson-CSF. Thomson Brandt kept approximately 40% of the company stock.

=== 1982: Thomson SA and its expansion ===

In 1982, both Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF were nationalized due to the efforts of François Mitterrand. Thomson-Brandt was subsequently renamed Thomson SA (Société Anonyme), and soon thereafter merged with Thomson-CSF. The Thomson Group was created, comprising Thompson-CSF, which focused on radio and broadcasting equipment and later electronics for defense and aerospace, and Thomson Multimedia which focused on consumer electronics. In 1988, two years after General Electric acquired the RCA Corporation, GE sold its consumer electronics division to Thomson, in exchange for some of Thomson&#x27;s medical businesses. Thomson Consumer Electronics was formed to market products under the GE and RCA brand names. In 1995, the French government split the consumer electronics from the defense businesses of Thomson Multimedia and Thomson-CSF prior to privatization in 1999. Following privatization, Thomson-CSF went through a series of acquisitions, including with Marconi plc, before becoming Thales in 2000. In 2005, Thomson bought Cirpack and Inventel.

In 2000, Thomson Multimedia purchased Technicolor from Carlton Television (owned by Carlton Communications) in the UK and began a move into the broadcast management, facilities and services market with the purchase of Corinthian Television, becoming Thomson Multimedia. In Q1 of 2001 it purchased the Broadcast Division of Koninklijke Philips (Philips Broadcast) then in 2002 acquired the Grass Valley Group, Inc. from Dr. Terence Gooding of San Diego, CA. Thomson then purchased the Moving Picture Company from ITV and the internet startup Singingfish, but then sold it to AOL in late 2004. In 2004, Thomson increased its stake in the Bangalore, India based company Celstream Technologies, which specializes in product engineering. Cirpack, a softswitch manufacturer, was incorporated and acquired in April 2005. In July 2005, Thomson agreed to purchase PRN Corporation for $285 million. In December 2005, Thomson re-purchased the Broadcast &amp; Multimedia part of Thales Group.

In 2004, Thomson set up a joint venture (TTE) with China&#x27;s TCL, giving to TCL all manufacturing of RCA and Thomson television and DVD products and making TCL the global leader in TV manufacturing (Thomson still controlled the brands themselves and licensed them to TTE). At the time, TCL was hailed as the first Chinese company to compete on the international stage with large international corporations. Thomson initially retained all marketing of TTE&#x27;s products, but transferred that to TTE in 2005. In June 2005, the Videocon Group of India announced that it would acquire the color picture tube manufacturing business from Thomson SA for €240 million. In early 2010, Thomson sold the rights to manufacture RCA branded televisions to ON Corporation.

In September 2005, Thomson first showed its Infinity camcorder. At the April 2006 launch, this was described as &quot;a new line of IT-based acquisition, recording and storage devices.&quot; It was designed to end the stranglehold of proprietary products in this market, and was inspired by a Grass Valley executive&#x27;s trip to Fry&#x27;s Electronics in Burbank to buy a computer backup device. The product failed to take market share from the predominant players in News Acquisition, Sony and Panasonic. It was too heavy and used too much power, which reduced battery life and increased heat. Its production was discontinued in 2010.

Also in 2005, Thomson marketing executive Nicholas de Wolff developed a plan for the creation of interactive Innovation centers, where early research projects could be demonstrated to industry leaders and clients in a close-up format, allowing for more strategic advanced product development. The centers (in Burbank, USA; Rennes, France; Hannover, Germany; and Beijing, China) were so successful, de Wolff and Thomson CTO, Jean-Charles Hourcade subsequently decided to launch the research demos at IBC and NAB trade shows, despite strong opposition from several business units.

In February 2007, Thomson Multimedia&#x27;s Technicolor Content Services division announced that it had invested in Indian animation studio Paprikaas to expand its entertainment services capabilities. In December 2007, Technicolor partnered with DreamWorks Animation to assist Paprikass in the &quot;recruitment, training and development of top-tier animation talent&quot;. By January 2010, Technicolor had raised its ownership in Paprikaas to 100%. Following the acquisition, Technicolor&#x27;s Indian offices in Delhi were merged into Paprikaas, and the resulting studio was rebranded Technicolor India in May 2010.

In December 2007, Thomson SA agreed to sell off its Audio/Video and Accessories businesses (sold under the RCA and Thomson brands) except for communications products such as cordless phones to Audiovox. In October 2007, Thomson SA agreed to sell its consumer electronics audio video business outside Europe including the worldwide rights to the RCA brand.

=== 2009–2010: Rebranding to Technicolor ===
On 29 January 2009, Thomson announced its intention to sell the PRN and Grass Valley businesses to focus on services business and improve its financial position. This was one of the consequences of an enormous financial crisis in 2009, which forced the company to a total financial restructuring to avoid bankruptcy. From 2010 to February 2011, &quot;Technicolor&quot; (having rebranded itself) divested these sub-businesses: Grass Valley and Broadcast to the Francisco Partners in July and December along with the Transmission business to PARTER Capital Group; Head-end to the FCDE (Fonds de Consolidation et de Développement des Entreprises), and reintegration of PRN.

On 20 June 2012, Vector Capital won a competitive bid for a minority stake in Technicolor, beating JP Morgan with a surprise, last-minute bid. With the investment of €167 - 191 million, Vector Capital will retain a minority stake in Technicolor of up to 29.94%. Following the deal, on 21 June 2012, Technicolor named Remy Sautter as Chairman of the Board and appointed two Vector Capital representatives to the board, Alexander Slusky and David Fishman.

On 3 July 2012, the Technicolor broadcast services division was acquired by Ericsson.

=== 2014: Creative studios acquisitions ===
On 10 June 2014, Technicolor announced the acquisition of the Canadian VFX studio Mr. X Inc. The same year the company also shut down its last film lab.

On 25 February 2015, Technicolor acquired the French independent animation producer OuiDo! Productions. On July 23 of the same year, Cisco Systems announced the sale of its television set-top box and cable modem business to Technicolor for $600 million—part of a division originally formed by Cisco&#x27;s $6.9 billion purchase of Scientific Atlanta. The deal was closed on November 20 same year.

On 15 September 2015, Technicolor acquired London-based The Mill for €259 million, or $293.4 million.

On 13 November 2015, Technicolor acquired the North American optical disc manufacturing and distribution assets from Cinram Group, Inc. for approximately €40 million.

In July 2018, Technicolor closed the sale of its Patent Licensing business to InterDigital for $475m and in February 2019, announced it has received a binding offer for its Research &amp; Innovation Activity from the same company.

In December 2019, Technicolor and its former CEO, Frederic Rose, were indicted in France on charges of fraud and breach of trust in connection with their role in the bankruptcy of Tarak Ben Ammar&#x27;s post-production group, Quinta Industries, and its subsequent acquisition of the company in January 2012.

=== 2020–present: COVID-19, restructuring, rebranding to Vantiva and Acquisition of CommScope&#x27;s Home Networks ===
In June 2020, Technicolor filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy due to the COVID-19 pandemic
and went through a restructuring process following the appointment of former Eir CEO Richard Moat. In 2021, the Technicolor post-production brand was sold to LA-based Streamland Media. The sale was part of a strategic decision to focus on visual effects and animation for film, advertising, gaming and live events.

Following the restructuring, Technicolor reported &quot;a positive third quarter 2021, and a significant improvement in profitability, despite supply constraint challenges affecting both Connecting Home and Technicolor Creative Studios.&quot;

Meanwhile, in May 2021, Technicolor launched Technicolor Creative Studios, forming a global structure to drive its family of studios. The studio network included The Mill, MPC (Film, Episodic &amp; Advertising), Mikros Animation and Mr. X. Christian Roberton, President of Technicolor Creative Studios announced that up to 4,000 VFX artists were anticipated to be hired.

In January 2022, The Mill united with MPC Advertising to create one global studio network under The Mill brand. As a global studio The Mill made the decision to scale up for a creative future, investing in new talent, production capabilities, and immersive technologies.

In the same month, Technicolor Creative Studios announced the integration of MPC Film, MPC Episodic and MR. X under Moving Picture Company (MPC), forming the largest suite of VFX studios serving the feature film and episodic market globally.

In February 2022, Technicolor announced the spin-off of its Technicolor Creative Studios division into an independent entity to be listed on Euronext Paris. Technicolor SA was to retain 35% of the new company&#x27;s capital. Technicolor also shared in its annual results that all three divisions of the group were profitable and two thirds of the 2022 pipeline were already booked for Technicolor Creative Studios, evidencing the dynamism of the film sector driven by the demand from streaming services.

Technicolor Creative Studios&#x27; spin-off was completed on 27 September 2022, on the same day Technicolor announced that the company as a whole would be rebranding to Vantiva. As of November 2022, Vantiva still owned 35% of TCS but TCS still operated as an independent entity from Vantiva. 

In October 2023, Vantiva announced its plan to acquire CommScope’s Home Networks division in exchange for a 25% stake in Vantiva. The acquisition of CommScope&#x27;s Home Network was completed on 2 January 2024.

<doc id="355544" wikidata="Q750025" url="?curid=355544" title="Pool Malebo">
<text>The Pool Malebo, formerly Stanley Pool, also known as Mpumbu, Lake Nkunda or Lake Nkuna by local indigenous people in pre-colonial times, is a lake-like widening in the lower reaches of the Congo River. The river serves as the border between the Republic of the Congo to the north and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the south.

The pool&#x27;s former name was in honour of the British explorer and journalist Sir Henry Morton Stanley, who mapped this area.

==History==
In the late 19th century, British colonists named this natural feature Stanley Pool, after British explorer and journalist Henry Morton Stanley, who had mapped and reported on this region. When a railway was constructed nearby, a plaque was installed at Palaba to commemorate the rail line connecting Matadi to Stanley Pool.

==Description==
The Pool Malebo is about long, wide and in surface area. Its central part is occupied by M&#x27;Bamou or Bamu Island (), which is Republic of the Congo territory.

The pool is shallow with depths of 3–10 m. But water levels may vary by as much as 3 m over the course of a year, because of seasonal flooding. The altitude here is an average of .

==Geography==
The capitals of the Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo —Brazzaville and Kinshasa, respectively— are located on opposite shores of the southern part of Pool Malebo. These two capital cities are the closest geographically of any in the world (other than the contiguous Rome, Italy and Vatican City).

The Pool is the beginning of the navigable part of the Congo River upstream to the cities of Mbandaka, Kisangani and Bangui. Downstream, navigation of the river is blocked by its descent through hundreds of meters in a series of rapids known as the Livingstone Falls. The river reaches sea level at the port of Boma, Congo, after a passage of 300 km.

==Ecology==

===Flora===
There are many palm and papyrus swamps along the edges of the river and pool. Floating mats of &quot;Eichhornia&quot; plants move on the river and drift through the pool.

===Fish===
Most fish endemic to the area are catfishes, including the mountain catfish, &quot;L. brieni&quot;, &quot;Leptoglanis mandevillei&quot;, &quot;L. bouilloni&quot; and &quot;Atopochilus chabanaudi&quot;, an upside-down catfish. More than 200 fish species have been documented. Mormyrids are the most common, with over 40 species, and have the highest diversification.

<doc id="355547" wikidata="Q519418" url="?curid=355547" title="London dispersion force">
<text>London dispersion forces (LDF, also known as dispersion forces, London forces, instantaneous dipole–induced dipole forces, fluctuating induced dipole bonds or loosely as van der Waals forces) are a type of intermolecular force acting between atoms and molecules that are normally electrically symmetric; that is, the electrons are symmetrically distributed with respect to the nucleus. They are part of the van der Waals forces. The LDF is named after the German physicist Fritz London. They are the weakest intermolecular force.

== Introduction ==
The electron distribution around an atom or molecule undergoes fluctuations in time. These fluctuations create instantaneous electric fields which are felt by other nearby atoms and molecules, which in turn adjust the spatial distribution of their own electrons. The net effect is that the fluctuations in electron positions in one atom induce a corresponding redistribution of electrons in other atoms, such that the electron motions become correlated. While the detailed theory requires a quantum-mechanical explanation &quot;(see quantum mechanical theory of dispersion forces)&quot;, the effect is frequently described as the formation of &quot;instantaneous dipoles&quot; that (when separated by vacuum) attract each other. The magnitude of the London dispersion force is frequently described in terms of a single parameter called the Hamaker constant, typically symbolized formula_1. For atoms that are located closer together than the wavelength of light, the interaction is essentially instantaneous and is described in terms of a &quot;non-retarded&quot; Hamaker constant. For entities that are farther apart, the finite time required for the fluctuation at one atom to be felt at a second atom (&quot;retardation&quot;) requires use of a &quot;retarded&quot; Hamaker constant.

While the London dispersion force between individual atoms and molecules is quite weak and decreases quickly with separation formula_2 like formula_3, in condensed matter (liquids and solids), the effect is cumulative over the volume of materials, or within and between organic molecules, such that London dispersion forces can be quite strong in bulk solid and liquids and decay much more slowly with distance. For example, the total force per unit area between two bulk solids decreases by formula_4 where formula_2 is the separation between them. The effects of London dispersion forces are most obvious in systems that are very non-polar (e.g., that lack ionic bonds), such as hydrocarbons and highly symmetric molecules like bromine (Br2, a liquid at room temperature) or iodine (I2, a solid at room temperature). In hydrocarbons and waxes, the dispersion forces are sufficient to cause condensation from the gas phase into the liquid or solid phase. Sublimation heats of e.g. hydrocarbon crystals reflect the dispersion interaction. Liquification of oxygen and nitrogen gases into liquid phases is also dominated by attractive London dispersion forces.

When atoms/molecules are separated by a third medium (rather than vacuum), the situation becomes more complex. In aqueous solutions, the effects of dispersion forces between atoms or molecules are frequently less pronounced due to competition with polarizable solvent molecules. That is, the instantaneous fluctuations in one atom or molecule are felt both by the solvent (water) and by other molecules.

Larger and heavier atoms and molecules exhibit stronger dispersion forces than smaller and lighter ones. This is due to the increased polarizability of molecules with larger, more dispersed electron clouds. The polarizability is a measure of how easily electrons can be redistributed; a large polarizability implies that the electrons are more easily redistributed. This trend is exemplified by the halogens (from smallest to largest: F2, Cl2, Br2, I2). The same increase of dispersive attraction occurs within and between organic molecules in the order RF, RCl, RBr, RI (from smallest to largest) or with other more polarizable heteroatoms. Fluorine and chlorine are gases at room temperature, bromine is a liquid, and iodine is a solid. The London forces are thought to arise from the motion of electrons.

== Quantum mechanical theory ==
The first explanation of the attraction between noble gas atoms was given by Fritz London in 1930. He used a quantum-mechanical theory based on second-order perturbation theory. The perturbation is because of the Coulomb interaction between the electrons and nuclei of the two moieties (atoms or molecules). The second-order perturbation expression of the interaction energy contains a sum over states. The states appearing in this sum are simple products of the stimulated electronic states of the monomers. Thus, no intermolecular antisymmetrization of the electronic states is included, and the Pauli exclusion principle is only partially satisfied.

London wrote a Taylor series expansion of the perturbation in formula_6, where formula_2 is the distance between the nuclear centers of mass of the moieties.

This expansion is known as the multipole expansion because the terms in this series can be regarded as energies of two interacting multipoles, one on each monomer. Substitution of the multipole-expanded form of V into the second-order energy yields an expression that resembles an expression describing the interaction between instantaneous multipoles (see the qualitative description above). Additionally, an approximation, named after Albrecht Unsöld, must be introduced in order to obtain a description of London dispersion in terms of polarizability volumes, formula_8, and ionization energies, formula_9, (ancient term: ionization potentials).

In this manner, the following approximation is obtained for the dispersion interaction formula_10 between two atoms formula_1 and formula_12. Here formula_13 and formula_14 are the polarizability volumes of the respective atoms. The quantities formula_15 and formula_16 are the first ionization energies of the atoms, and formula_2 is the intermolecular distance.

:formula_18

Note that this final London equation does not contain instantaneous dipoles (see molecular dipoles). The &quot;explanation&quot; of the dispersion force as the interaction between two such dipoles was invented after London arrived at the proper quantum mechanical theory. The authoritative work contains a criticism of the instantaneous dipole model and a modern and thorough exposition of the theory of intermolecular forces.

The London theory has much similarity to the quantum mechanical theory of light dispersion, which is why London coined the phrase &quot;dispersion effect&quot;. In physics, the term &quot;dispersion&quot; describes the variation of a quantity with frequency, which is the fluctuation of the electrons in the case of the London dispersion.

== Relative magnitude ==
Dispersion forces are usually dominant over the three van der Waals forces (orientation, induction, dispersion) between atoms and molecules, with the exception of molecules that are small and highly polar, such as water. The following contribution of the dispersion to the total intermolecular interaction energy has been given:

<text>Brother Bear is a 2003 American animated musical fantasy comedy-drama film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It was directed by Aaron Blaise and Robert Walker and produced by Chuck Williams, from a screenplay written by Tab Murphy, Lorne Cameron, David Hoselton, and the writing team of Steve Bencich and Ron J. Friedman. The film stars the voices of Joaquin Phoenix, Jeremy Suarez, Rick Moranis, Dave Thomas, Jason Raize (in his only film role), and D.B. Sweeney. &quot;Brother Bear&quot; follows an Alaska native boy named Kenai who kills a grizzly bear as retribution for his older brother&#x27;s death. The Great Spirits, incensed by the unnecessary killing, transform Kenai into a bear himself as punishment. In order to become human again, Kenai travels to a mountain where the Northern lights touch the earth, forging a relationship with a cub named Koda along the way.

The film was the third and final Disney animated feature produced primarily by the Feature Animation studio at Disney-MGM Studios in Orlando, Florida; the studio was shut down in March 2004, not long after the release of this film in favor of computer-animated features. &quot;Brother Bear&quot; was released in the United States on November 1, 2003, to mixed reviews from critics and received a nomination for Best Animated Feature at the 76th Academy Awards, losing to Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;. The film grossed $250 million against a $46 million budget. A direct-to-video sequel, &quot;Brother Bear 2&quot;, was released on August 29, 2006.

==Plot==
In a post-ice age Alaska, the local tribes believe all creatures are created through the Great Spirits, who are said to appear in the form of an aurora. A trio of brothers, Kenai, the youngest; Denahi, the middle; and Sitka, the eldest, return to their tribe for Kenai to receive his totem, necklaces in the shapes of different animals, from Tanana, the shaman of the brothers&#x27; tribe. The particular animals they represent symbolize what they must achieve to call themselves men.

Unlike Sitka, who gained the eagle of guidance, and Denahi, who gained the wolf of wisdom, Kenai receives the bear of love. He objects to his totem, stating that bears are thieves and dumb creatures without feelings, and believes his point is made a fact when a brown bear steals their basket of salmon, which Kenai did not hold properly in a hurry to receive his totem. Kenai searches for the basket and finds it destroyed. He sees the bear, provokes it, his brothers find him, and a fight ends on top of a giant glacier. When the bear gets the upper hand, Sitka gives his life to save his brothers by dislodging the glacier, although the bear survives the fall. After Sitka&#x27;s funeral, an enraged Kenai blames the bear for Sitka&#x27;s death and rejects his totem. He hunts down and chases the bear up onto a rocky cliff, fighting and eventually slaying it. The Spirits, represented by Sitka&#x27;s spirit in the form of a bald eagle, arrive and transform Kenai into a bear after the dead bear&#x27;s body evaporates and joins them. Denahi arrives and falsely believes that Kenai was killed by the bear from earlier. Kenai falls off the cliff and down some rapids, but survives. Denahi vows to avenge Kenai.

Kenai awakens as he is healed by Tanana and discovers to his horror that he has become a bear. Tanana cannot understand Kenai, but advises him to go to the mountain where the lights touch the earth to find Sitka and be turned back into a human, but only when he atones for his actions; she vanishes without an explanation. Kenai quickly discovers that the wildlife can now speak to him, meeting a pair of moose brothers named Rutt and Tuke. He gets caught in a trap but is freed by an outgoing bear cub named Koda. After they evade Denahi, who is still unaware that the bear he&#x27;s pursuing is Kenai, Koda reveals to Kenai that his mother is missing. They make a deal: Kenai will escort Koda to an annual salmon run, and then the cub will lead Kenai to the mountain nearby. Along the way, the two form a brother-like relationship and are joined by Rutt and Tuke and ride on the backs of a woolly mammoth herd. Kenai and Koda eventually continue their journey on foot. As they go through a volcanic field, Kenai and Koda are still hunted by Denahi as he is determined to avenge Kenai.

Kenai and Koda reach the salmon run, where a large number of bears live as a family, including the leader Tug. Kenai accepts his new surroundings and is comfortable living with the other bears. During story time among the bears, Koda tells a story about his mother recently fighting human hunters on a glacier, reminding Kenai of his and his brothers&#x27; fight with the bear that led to Sitka&#x27;s death, making him realize that the bear he killed was Koda&#x27;s mother. Horrified of what he has done, Kenai runs away in a fit of guilt, but Koda soon follows him. Downhearted, Kenai confesses the truth to Koda, who runs away, grief-stricken that Kenai was responsible for his mother&#x27;s death. A remorseful Kenai leaves to go to the mountain.

Meanwhile, Rutt and Tuke, having had a falling out, reconcile in front of Koda, prompting him to forgive Kenai. On the mountain, Kenai is cornered by Denahi, but their battle is interrupted by Koda, who steals Denahi&#x27;s spear. Kenai comes to Koda&#x27;s aid, out of love, prompting Sitka to appear and turn him back into a human, much to Denahi and Koda&#x27;s surprise. However, upon realizing that Koda needs him because of his own mistake, Kenai asks Sitka to transform him back into a bear with Denahi&#x27;s support. Sitka complies, and Kenai is transformed back into a bear. Koda is reunited briefly with the spirit of his mother before she and Sitka return to the spirit world. In the end, Kenai lives with the rest of the bears and gains his title as a man, through being a bear.

==Voice cast==
* Joaquin Phoenix as Kenai, the younger brother of Sitka and Denahi. After he callously kills a bear, Kenai is turned into one himself to teach him to see through another&#x27;s eyes, feel through another&#x27;s heart, and discover the true meaning of brotherhood. John E. Hurst and Byron Howard served as the supervising animators for Kenai in human and bear form respectively.
* Jeremy Suarez as Koda, a cheeky grizzly bear cub who helps Kenai on his journey to &quot;where the lights touch the earth.&quot; Alex Kupershmidt served as the supervising animator for Koda.
* Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas as Rutt and Tuke, a comedic Canadian moose duo. They are based on the comedy duo characters Bob and Doug, which are portrayed by Moranis and Thomas.
* Jason Raize as Denahi, the middle brother. This was Jason Raize&#x27;s first and only film role before his death in 2004. Harold Gould provides narration from an older Denahi&#x27;s point of view. Ruben A. Aquino served as the supervising animator for Denahi.
* D.B. Sweeney as Sitka, the oldest brother.

==Production==
===Development===
Following the critical and commercial success of &quot;The Lion King&quot; (1994), then-Disney chairman and CEO Michael Eisner urged for more animal-centric animated features. He suggested a North American setting, taking particular inspiration from an original landscape painting by Albert Bierstadt that he purchased. For the characters, the hero would be a bear, the king of the forest. At the time, the original idea, which was inspired by &quot;King Lear&quot;, centered around an old blind bear who traveled the forest with his three daughters. In 1997, veteran animator Aaron Blaise joined the project as director because he &quot;wanted to be attached so that [he] could animate bears&quot;, and was soon joined by co-director Robert Walker. Because Blaise desired a more naturalistic story, Blaise and producer Chuck Williams produced a two-page treatment of a father-son story in which the son is transformed into a bear, and in the end, remains a bear. Thomas Schumacher, then-president of Walt Disney Feature Animation, approved the revised story and proclaimed, &quot;This is the idea of the century.&quot; Tab Murphy, who had co-written the screenplays for &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; (1996), &quot;Tarzan&quot; (1999), and &quot;&quot; (2001), came on board to write an early draft of the script.

After the project was green-lit, Blaise, Walker, and the story artists embarked on a research trip in August 1999 to visit Alaska where they traveled on the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes and Kodiak Island. They also traveled through Denali National Park and the Kenai Fjords National Park, where they visited Exit and Holgate Glacier. A year later, the production team took additional research trips through the Yellowstone National Park, Grand Teton National Park, and the Sequoia National Park. Around 2000, the story evolved into a tale in which the transformed Kenai is taken in by an older bear, Grizz, who was to be voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan. However, Blaise explained that &quot;we were struggling [with the story], trying to get some charm into the film. So we turned Grizz into a cub named Koda&quot;, who was voiced by Jeremy Suarez. Because Blaise, Walker, and Williams enjoyed Duncan&#x27;s vocal performance, Tug, the de facto leader of the bears at the salmon run, was written into the film.

===Casting===
In March 2001, Joaquin Phoenix confirmed he was cast in the film, exclaiming, &quot;Oh, but forget the Oscar nomination (for &quot;Gladiator&quot;). The real pinnacle is that I&#x27;m playing an animated character in a Disney film. Isn&#x27;t that the greatest? I play a Native American transformed into a bear. It&#x27;s called &quot;The Bears.&quot; Don&#x27;t call me a leading man. I don&#x27;t care about that. I&#x27;m a leading bear. I am content!&quot; After the filmmakers heard his audition tapes for &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; (2003), Jeremy Suarez was cast as Koda.

As is typical for animation voice acting, Suarez and Phoenix voiced their roles separately, although they both did a recording session together at least two times. Voicing the moose brothers Rutt and Tuke, Dave Thomas and Rick Moranis performed simultaneously throughout the recording process. Angayuqaq Oscar Kawagley, an associate professor who taught courses on Alaska Native philosophy at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, claimed he was never given a script, but was instead given &quot;the dialogue that they had written, which was being told by a Native person&quot;. For his role as the Inuit Narrator, Kawagley translated the dialogue in written form into Yup&#x27;ik and faxed the translation back to the Disney studio. He later recorded his translation at an Anchorage studio while being videotaped for animation reference.

=== Design and animation ===
The film is traditionally animated but includes some CG elements such as &quot;a salmon run and a caribou stampede&quot;. Layout artist Armand Serrano, speaking about the drawing process on the film, said that &quot;we had to do a life drawing session with live bear cubs and also outdoor drawing and painting sessions at Fort Wilderness in Florida three times a week for two months [...]&quot;.. In 2001, Background supervisor Barry Kooser and his team traveled to Jackson Hole, Wyoming and studied with Western landscape painter Scott Christensen, where they learned to: &quot;simplify objects by getting the spatial dimensions to work first and working in the detail later.&quot;

According to Ruben Aquino, supervising animator for the character of Denahi, Denahi was originally meant to be Kenai&#x27;s father; later this was changed to Kenai&#x27;s brother. Byron Howard, supervising animator for Kenai in bear form, said that earlier in production a bear named Grizz (who resembles Tug in the film and is voiced by the same actor) was supposed to have the role of Kenai&#x27;s mentor. Art Director Robh Ruppel stated that the ending of the film originally showed how Kenai and Denahi get together once a year to play when the northern lights are in the sky.

==Music==
Following the success of the &quot;Tarzan&quot; soundtrack, Phil Collins was offered the opportunity to compose songs for &quot;Brother Bear&quot;, as well as let him &quot;co-write the score&quot;. However, Collins explained, &quot;Slowly, the bad news started to trickle down that I wouldn&#x27;t be singing it all. It was a bit of a disappointment, because I [usually] write songs that I sing myself.&quot; While Collins composed six songs for the film, he shared vocal performance duties with Tina Turner, who sang the opening song; the Blind Boys of Alabama; and the Bulgarian Women&#x27;s Choir, who performed the song, &quot;Transformation&quot;. Collins&#x27;s lyrics for the song were first translated into Iñupiaq. The performance was then arranged by score co-composers Collins and Mark Mancina, and vocal arranger Eddie Jobson.

==Release==
&quot;Brother Bear&quot; was originally slated for a spring 2004 release, while &quot;Home on the Range&quot; was scheduled for an autumn 2003 release. However, Disney announced that &quot;Brother Bear&quot; would be released in fall 2003 while &quot;Home on the Range&quot; was pushed back for a spring 2004 release. Contrary to speculation, news writer Jim Hill stated the release date switch was not because &quot;Home on the Range&quot; was suffering from story rewrites, but to promote &quot;Brother Bear&quot; on the Platinum Edition release of &quot;The Lion King&quot;. On July 15, 2003, Disney announced that the release date would be moved up by one weekend from its previously scheduled slot of November 7, 2003. However, instead of opening on Halloween, the film would be released on Saturday, November 1, 2003.

On October 20, 2003, &quot;Brother Bear&quot; premiered at the New Amsterdam Theatre, where fellow attendees included New York Governor George Pataki and cast members Michael Clarke Duncan and Estelle Harris. Following the screening of the film, Collins performed the song &quot;No Way Out&quot; before introducing Tina Turner to the stage where she performed the opening song, &quot;Great Spirits&quot;.

===Home media===
&quot;Brother Bear&quot; was released on VHS and DVD on March 30, 2004. The DVD release consisted of two separate discs, which were both THX-certified. The first disc contained the widescreen version (1.66:1 aspect ratio) and the second disc featured the original theatrical widescreen version (1.66:1 and 2.35:1 aspect ratio). The DVD also included a documentary on the production of the film, an audio commentary track by Rutt and Tuke with an option for visual mode, an artwork gallery narrated by the artists, three deleted scenes, two games called &quot;Find Your Totem&quot; and &quot;Bone Puzzle&quot;, and two music videos with Phil Collins. By January 2005, the film had earned $169 million in home video sales and rentals. In April 2004 alone, 5.51 million DVD copies of the film were sold.

The film was released in a Blu-ray special edition combined with its sequel, &quot;Brother Bear 2&quot;, on March 12, 2013.

===Video game===
&quot;Disney&#x27;s Brother Bear&quot; games were released in November 2003 for Game Boy Advance, PC and mobile phones.

==Reception==

===Critical reaction===
&quot;Brother Bear&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 from top reviews from mainstream critics, calculated a score of 48 based on 28 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

On the syndicated television show &quot;At the Movies&quot;, film critics Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper both gave the film positive reviews. In his print review for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Ebert wrote the film &quot;doesn&#x27;t have the zowie factor of &quot;The Lion King&quot; or &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;, but is sweet rather than exciting. Children and their parents are likely to relate on completely different levels, the adults connecting with the transfer of souls from man to beast, while the kids are excited by the adventure stuff.&quot; &quot;USA Today&quot; film critic Claudia Puig gave the film three out of four stars praising the film for its &quot;message of tolerance and respect for nature rings loud and clear. And family audiences are treated to a vibrantly hued movie with appealing characters.&quot; Kirk Honeycutt of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; called the film &quot;a playful movie that celebrates nature and the spirit world with striking imagery and a smooth blend of drama and comedy.&quot;

Writing for &quot;Variety&quot;, Todd McCarthy summarized that &quot;&quot;Brother Bear&quot; is a very mild animated entry from Disney with a distinctly recycled feel [because] the film&#x27;s characters and narrative simply fail to engage strong interest, and tale is probably too resolutely serious to enchant small fry in the way the better Disney titles always have.&quot; Kenneth Turan, reviewing for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, complimented &quot;the richness and fluidity of its visuals&quot; and the &quot;satisfying ending&quot;, but derided that &quot;&quot;Brother Bear&quot; has an appeal that can&#x27;t be denied. Too often, however, this film&#x27;s lack of a fresh dramatic approach and not its technique makes it difficult to embrace as much as we&#x27;d like to&quot;. Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; felt the film was too similar to &quot;The Lion King&quot;. He later wrote: &quot;This opulent movie, with gorgeous rainbow animation, is heavy on message but light on humor.&quot;

Many critics and audiences also noted the use of the film&#x27;s aspect ratio as a storytelling device. The film begins at a standard widescreen aspect ratio of 1.75:1 (similar to the 1.85:1 ratio common in U.S. cinema or the 1.78:1 ratio of HDTV), while Kenai is a human; in addition, the film&#x27;s art direction and color scheme are grounded in realism. After Kenai transforms into a bear twenty-four minutes into the picture, the film itself transforms as well: to an anamorphic aspect ratio of 2.35:1 and towards brighter, more fanciful colors and slightly more caricatured art direction. &quot;Brother Bear&quot; was the first feature since &quot;The Horse Whisperer&quot; to do a widescreen shift. It was the only animated film to feature this technique, until &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot; and &quot;Enchanted&quot; in 2007.

===Box office===
In its limited release, &quot;Brother Bear&quot; played only in two selected theaters in Los Angeles, California and New York City, grossing $291,940 for a per-screen average of $145,970. The wide release followed on November 1, 2003, expanding to 3,030 theater venues. The film opened second behind &quot;Scary Movie 3&quot; grossing $18.5 million at the box office. On its second wide weekend, the film continued its strong showing grossing $18.6 million against new competing films such as &quot;Elf&quot; and &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot;, collecting $44.1 million in three weeks. The film grossed $85.3 million in the United States and Canada, and $165.1 million in international territories, bringing its worldwide total to $250.4 million.

===Awards and nominations===
==Other media==
The song &quot;Welcome&quot; written by Phil Collins was later used as the theme song for Walt Disney&#x27;s Parade of Dreams during the Happiest Homecoming on Earth, celebrating the 50th anniversary of Disneyland. For the parade, the song had slightly changed lyrics and was performed by an ensemble.

===Cancelled television spin-off===
Disney Television Animation was set to produce a television series titled &quot;Brother Bear: The Series&quot; for Disney Channel. &quot;The Simpsons&quot; veteran Pete Michels was to helm the series and was allowed to watch a copy of the film so that he could construct a pilot. The series would have taken place directly after the events of the film and would have seen Kenai and Koda adopt other orphaned animals into their family. Jeremy Suarez, Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas were to reprise their respective roles while Will Friedle would have replaced Joaquin Phoenix as Kenai. While the pilot tested well, it was not picked up as Disney Channel executives felt that adapting the film as a series was &quot;counterproductive&quot; to their goal of trying to reach a tween audience, combined with the fact that the movie performed below expectations.

===Sequel===
A direct-to-video sequel called &quot;Brother Bear 2&quot; was released on August 29, 2006. It focuses on the continued adventures of bear brothers Kenai and Koda. While the first film dealt with Kenai&#x27;s relationship with Koda, this one focuses more on his bond with a young human of his past, Nita.

===Video game===
A video game of same name was released by Disney as a tie-in to the film. It was released for Game Boy Advance, November 21 for Microsoft Windows, and for mobile phones.

<text>Mobbing, as a sociological term, refers either to bullying in any context, or specifically to that within the workplace, especially when perpetrated by a group rather than an individual.

== Psychological and health effects ==
Victims of workplace mobbing frequently suffer from: adjustment disorders, somatic symptoms, psychological trauma (e.g., trauma tremors or sudden onset selective mutism), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), or major depression.

In mobbing targets with PTSD, Leymann notes that the &quot;mental effects were fully comparable with PTSD from war or prison camp experiences.&quot; Some patients may develop alcoholism or other substance abuse disorders. Family relationships routinely suffer and victims sometimes display acts of aggression towards strangers in the street. Workplace targets and witnesses may even develop brief psychotic episodes , generally with paranoid symptoms. Leymann estimated that 15% of suicides in Sweden could be directly attributed to workplace mobbing.

== Development of the concept ==
Konrad Lorenz, in his book entitled &quot;On Aggression&quot; (1966), first described mobbing among birds and other animals, attributing it to instincts rooted in the Darwinian struggle to thrive (see animal mobbing behavior). In his view, most humans are subject to similar innate impulses but capable of bringing them under rational control. Lorenz&#x27;s explanation for his choice of the English word &quot;mobbing&quot; was omitted in the English translation by Marjorie Kerr Wilson. According to Kenneth Westhues, Lorenz chose the word &quot;mobbing&quot; because he remembered in the collective attack by birds, the old German term &quot;hassen auf&quot;, which means &quot;to hate after&quot; or &quot;to put a hate on&quot; was applied and this emphasised &quot;the depth of antipathy with which the attack is made&quot; rather than the English word &#x27;mobbing&#x27; which emphasised the collective aspect of the attack. 

In the 1970s, the Swedish physician applied Lorenz&#x27;s conceptualization to the collective aggression of children against a targeted child. In the 1980s, professor and practising psychologist Heinz Leymann applied the term to ganging up in the workplace. In 2011, anthropologist Janice Harper suggested that some anti-bullying approaches effectively constitute a form of mobbing by using the label &quot;bully&quot; to dehumanize, encouraging people to shun and avoid people labeled bullies, and in some cases sabotage their work or refuse to work with them, while almost always calling for their exclusion and termination from employment.

== Cause ==
Janice Harper followed her &quot;Huffington Post&quot; essay with a series of essays in both &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; and in her column &quot;Beyond Bullying: Peacebuilding at Work, School and Home&quot; in &quot;Psychology Today&quot; that argued that mobbing is a form of group aggression innate to primates, and that those who engage in mobbing are not necessarily &quot;evil&quot; or &quot;psychopathic&quot;, but responding in a predictable and patterned manner when someone in a position of leadership or influence communicates to the group that someone must go. For that reason, she indicated that anyone can and will engage in mobbing, and that once mobbing gets underway, just as in the animal kingdom it will almost always continue and intensify as long as the target remains with the group. She subsequently published a book on the topic in which she explored animal behavior, organizational cultures and historical forms of group aggression, suggesting that mobbing is a form of group aggression on a continuum of structural violence with genocide as the most extreme form of mob aggression.

== Online ==

Social networking sites and blogs have enabled anonymous groups to coordinate and attack other people. The victims of these groups can be targeted by various attacks and threats, sometimes causing the victims to use pseudonyms or go offline to avoid them.

Herd mentality and cyberbullying are common on social media platforms. The &quot;social media mob&quot; that formed may evolve to &quot;bullying anyone who didn’t align with their beliefs or conclusions&quot;.

== In the workplace ==

British anti-bullying researchers Andrea Adams and Tim Field have used the expression &quot;workplace bullying&quot; instead of what Leymann called &quot;mobbing&quot; in a workplace context. They identify mobbing as a particular type of bullying that is not as apparent as most, defining it as &quot;an emotional assault. It begins when an individual becomes the target of disrespectful and harmful behavior. Through innuendo, rumors, and public discrediting, a hostile environment is created in which one individual gathers others to willingly, or unwillingly, participate in continuous malevolent actions to force a person out of the workplace.&quot;

Adams and Field believe that mobbing is typically found in work environments that have poorly organised production or working methods and incapable or inattentive management and that mobbing victims are usually &quot;exceptional individuals who demonstrated intelligence, competence, creativity, integrity, accomplishment and dedication&quot;.

In contrast, Janice Harper suggests that workplace mobbing is typically found in organizations where there is limited opportunity for employees to exit, whether through tenure systems or contracts that make it difficult to terminate an employee (such as universities or unionized organizations), and/or where finding comparable work in the same community makes it difficult for the employee to voluntarily leave (such as academic positions, religious institutions, or military). In these employments, efforts to eliminate the worker will intensify to push the worker out against his or her will through shunning, sabotage, false accusations and a series of investigations and poor reviews. Another form of employment where workers are mobbed are those that require the use of uniforms or other markers of group inclusion (law enforcement, fire fighting, military), organizations where a single gender has predominated, but another gender is beginning to enter (STEM fields, fire fighting, military, nursing, teaching, and construction). Finally, she suggests that organizations where there are limited opportunities for advancement can be prone to mobbing because those who do advance are more likely to view challenges to their leadership as threats to their precarious positions. Harper further challenges the idea that workers are targeted for their exceptional competence. In some cases, she suggests, exceptional workers are mobbed because they are viewed as threatening to someone, but some workers who are mobbed are not necessarily good workers. Rather, Harper contends, some mobbing targets are outcasts or unproductive workers who cannot easily be terminated, and are thus treated inhumanely to push them out. While Harper emphasizes the cruelty and damaging consequences of mobbing, her organizational analysis focuses on the structural, rather than moral, nature of the organization. Moreover, she views the behavior itself, which she terms workplace aggression, as grounded in group psychology, rather than individual psychosis—even when the mobbing is initiated due to a leader&#x27;s personal psychosis, the dynamics of group aggression will transform the leader&#x27;s bullying into group mobbing—two vastly distinct psychological and social phenomena.

Shallcross, Ramsay and Barker consider workplace &quot;mobbing&quot; to be a generally unfamiliar term in some English speaking countries. Some researchers claim that mobbing is simply another name for bullying. Workplace mobbing can be considered as a &quot;virus&quot; or a &quot;cancer&quot; that spreads throughout the workplace via gossip, rumour and unfounded accusations. It is a deliberate attempt to force a person out of their workplace by humiliation, general harassment, emotional abuse and/or terror. Mobbing can be described as being &quot;ganged up on.&quot; Mobbing is executed by a leader (who can be a manager, a co-worker, or a subordinate). The leader then rallies others into a systematic and frequent &quot;mob-like&quot; behaviour toward the victim.

Mobbing as &quot;downward bullying&quot; by superiors is also known as &quot;bossing&quot;, and &quot;upward bullying&quot; by colleagues as &quot;staffing&quot;, in some European countries, for instance, in German-speaking regions.

== At school ==

Following on from the work of Heinemann, Elliot identifies mobbing as a common phenomenon in the form of group bullying at school. It involves &quot;ganging up&quot; on someone using tactics of rumor, innuendo, discrediting, isolating, intimidating, and above all, making it look as if the targeted person is responsible (victim blaming). It is to be distinguished from normal conflicts (between pupils of similar standing and power), which are an integral part of everyday school life.

== In academia ==

Kenneth Westhues&#x27; study of mobbing in academia found that vulnerability was increased by personal differences such as being a foreigner or of a different sex; by working in fields such as music or literature which have recently come under the sway of less objective and more post-modern scholarship; financial pressure; or having an aggressive superior. Other factors included envy, heresy and campus politics.

== Checklists ==
Sociologists and authors have created checklists and other tools to identify mobbing behaviour. Common approaches to assessing mobbing behavior is through quantifying frequency of mobbing behavior based on a given definition of the behavior or through quantifying what respondents believe encompasses mobbing behavior. These are referred to as &quot;self-labeling&quot; and &quot;behavior experience&quot; methods respectively.

Limitations of some mobbing examination tools are:
* Participant exhaustion due to examination length
* Limited sample exposure resulting in limited result generalizability
* Confounding with constructs that result in the same affect as mobbing but are not purposely harmful

Common Tools used to measure mobbing behavior are:
* Leyman Inventory of Psychological Terror (LIPT)
* Negative Acts Questionnaire – Revised (NAQ-R)
* Luxembourg Workplace Mobbing Scale (LWMS)

== Counteracting ==
From an organizational perspective, it has been suggested that mobbing behavior can be curtailed by acknowledging behaviors as mobbing behaviors and that such behaviors result in harm and/or negative consequences. Precise definitions of such traits are critical due to ambiguity of unacceptable and acceptable behaviors potentially leading to unintentional mobbing behavior. Attenuation of mobbing behavior can further be enhanced by developing policies that explicitly address specific behaviors that are culturally accepted to result in harm or negative affect. This provides a framework from which mobbing victims can respond to mobbing. Lack of such a framework may result in a situation where each instance of mobbing is treated on an individual basis with no recourse of prevention. It may also indicate that such behaviors are warranted and within the realm of acceptable behavior within an organization. Direct responses to grievances related to mobbing that are handled outside of a courtroom and training programs outlining antibully-countermeasures also demonstrate a reduction in mobbing behavior.

<text>Since 1947, the Canadian Armed Forces have completed 72 international missions. More than 3,600 soldiers, sailors and Air Force personnel are deployed overseas on operational missions. On any given day, about 8,000 Canadian Armed Forces members Royal Canadian Air Force, Royal Canadian Navy, and Canadian Army (one-third of the Canadian deployable force) are preparing for, engaged in or are returning from an overseas mission.

Canada&#x27;s peacekeeping role during the 20th century has played a major role in its positive global image. Canada has served in over 50 peacekeeping missions. Canada has long been reluctant to participate in military operations that are not sanctioned by the United Nations (UN), such as the Vietnam War or the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Canada has faced controversy over its operations in some foreign countries, notably the 1993 Somalia affair.

Since the 21st century, Canadian direct participation in UN peacekeeping efforts greatly declined, with its military participation reallocated to UN-sanctioned operations through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). This military reallocation resulted in a shift towards more militarized and deadly missions. Canada&#x27;s participation in the Afghanistan war (2001–2014) saw over 160 Canadian deaths, the largest for any single Canadian military mission since the Korean War in the early 1950s.

Alongside many domestic obligations and a few ongoing peacekeeping missions, the Canadian Armed Forces are currently deployed in multiple foreign military operation. Below is a list of all currently active and past Canadian Armed Forces operations both within Canada&#x27;s borders and internationally.

<doc id="355571" wikidata="Q1041718" url="?curid=355571" title="Villa San Michele">
<text>The Villa San Michele was built about the end of the 19th century on the isle of Capri, Italy, by the Swedish physician and author Axel Munthe.

==Description==
The villa&#x27;s gardens have panoramic views of the town of Capri and its harbour, the Sorrentine Peninsula, and Mount Vesuvius. The villa sits on a ledge at the top of the Phoenician Steps, between Anacapri and Capri, at a height of above sea level.

San Michele&#x27;s gardens are adorned with many relics and works of art dating from ancient Egypt and other periods of classical antiquity. They now form part of the Grandi Giardini Italiani.

In his later years, Axel Munthe wrote his youthful memoir &quot;The Story of San Michele&quot;, which describes how he first visited the island and built the villa, decorated with the remains of palaces built by the Ancient Romans which he found on his land. This colourfully written book was first published in 1929 and became an immediate worldwide success, being translated into many languages. It has been reprinted many times since then.

Between 1919 and 1920, Munthe was an unwilling landlord to the outrageous socialite and muse Luisa Casati, who took possession of Villa San Michele. This was described by the Scottish author Compton Mackenzie in his diaries.

<text>Alberto Aguilera Valadez (; 7 January 1950 – 28 August 2016), known professionally as Juan Gabriel (), was a Mexican singer-songwriter and actor. Colloquially nicknamed Juanga () and El Divo de Juárez, Juan Gabriel was known for his flamboyant style, which broke norms and standards within the Latin music industry. Widely regarded as one of the best and most prolific Mexican composers and singers of all time, he is considered a pop icon.

Having sold an estimated 40 million records worldwide, Juan Gabriel is among Latin America&#x27;s best selling music artists. His nineteenth studio album, &quot;Recuerdos, Vol. II&quot;, is reportedly the best-selling album of all time in Mexico, with over eight million copies sold. During his career, Juan Gabriel wrote around 1,800 songs.

Some of his most popular, signature songs include titles such as &quot;Amor eterno&quot;, &quot;Querida&quot;, &quot;Yo no nací para amar&quot;, &quot;Hasta que te conocí&quot;, &quot;El Noa Noa&quot;, &quot;No tengo dinero&quot;, &quot;Abrázame muy fuerte&quot;, &quot;Te lo pido por favor&quot;, &quot;En esta primavera&quot;, &quot;Pero qué necesidad&quot;, &quot;La Farsante&quot;, &quot;Te sigo amando&quot;, &quot;Con Todo y Mi Tristeza&quot;, &quot;Siempre en mi mente&quot;, &quot;De mí enamórate&quot; and &quot;Lo pasado, pasado&quot;; amongst perhaps his most acclaimed songs are &quot;Se me olvidó otra vez&quot; and the heartbreaking ballad &quot;Así Fue&quot;, popularized by and sung with Isabel Pantoja of Spain. Many of his compositions have been performed by and with other artists.

==Early life==
Alberto Aguilera Valadez was born on 7 January 1950, in Parácuaro, Michoacán, Mexico. The son of Gabriel Aguilera Rodríguez and Victoria Valadez Rojas, of the influential Macias-Valadéz of Jalisco, he was the youngest of ten children. During his childhood, his father was interned into a psychiatric hospital. Because of this, his mother moved the family to Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, and he was put in the El Tribunal boarding school where he remained for eight years. There, he met school director Micaela Alvarado and teacher Juan Contreras, becoming very close with Contreras, He ran-away from the El Tribunal school and lived with Contreras for a year at the age of 13. In the same year, Aguilera composed his first song. At age 14, Aguilera returned to live with his mother in the center of the city. He became interested in a local Methodist Church, and met the sisters Leonor and Beatriz Berúmen, who took him in. There, he sang in the choir and helped by cleaning the church. Nonetheless, Aguilera still identified as a Roman Catholic.

In 1965, at age 15, Aguilera debuted on the Notivisa (now Gala TV Ciudad Juárez) television show &quot;Noches Rancheras&quot;. Host Raúl Loya gave him the pseudonym &quot;Adán Luna&quot;; on the program, he sang the song &quot;María la Bandida&quot; by José Alfredo Jiménez. From 1966 to 1968, until roughly his eighteenth birthday, he would work as a singer at the Noa-Noa bar. During this period, he also wrote the song &quot;El Noa Noa&quot;. He also worked as a singer in other bars around town. Later, Aguilera traveled to Mexico City looking for opportunities at record companies, but he found none. He returned to Juárez, where he continued working as a local singer. The next year, he attempted again to find a recording contract. At RCA Víctor, he was hired by Eduardo Magallanes to work as a backing vocalist, primarily for Roberto Jordan, Angélica María and Estela Núñez. In 1970, he resigned as he had received insufficient payment, and returned to work the bars in Juárez.

With many telling him he would have success if he simply tried again, Aguilera returned to Mexico City a third time in 1971. Not having any money, Aguilera often slept in bus and train stations. At a certain point, he was incorrectly accused of robbery, and was imprisoned in the Palacio de Lecumberri prison for a year and a half. During this time, he wrote several songs, including &quot;Tres Claveles y Un Rosal&quot; and &quot;Me He Quedado Solo&quot;; these compositions attracted the attention of Andrés Puentes Vargas, Lecumberri&#x27;s prison warden, who later introduced him to Mexican singer and actress Enriqueta Jiménez Chabolla, better known as La Prieta Linda, as well as to his wife, Ofelia Urtuzuastegui Ruiz. The latter and her husband greatly helped Aguilera, and with their assistance and a clear lack of any wrongdoing, he was released from prison, living at their home for about two years. Aguilera&#x27;s newfound &quot;parents&quot; provided him shelter, protection and support, and the perfect environment to compose more music with which to launch his professional career, as Juan Gabriel.

==Career==
La Prieta Linda helped Aguilera at RCA Víctor, where he signed a recording contract. He started to use the pseudonym &quot;Juan Gabriel&quot; (Juan, in honor of Juan Contreras; and Gabriel, in honor of his own father). In 1971, Juan Gabriel released his first studio album &quot;El Alma Joven...&quot;, which included the song &quot;No Tengo Dinero&quot;, which became his debut single and his first hit. &quot;El Alma Joven...&quot; was certified as gold by the Asociación Mexicana de Productores de Fonogramas y Videogramas (AMPROFON). In 1972, Juan Gabriel participated at the OTI Festival, where he sang the songs &quot;Será Mañana&quot; and &quot;Uno, Dos y Tres (Y Me Dás un Beso)&quot;. The songs were not qualified to represent Mexico, but they were acclaimed, and later recorded for his second album &quot;El Alma Joven II&quot;. After releasing &quot;El Alma Joven III&quot; (1973), Juan Gabriel released his first mariachi album featuring the group Vargas de Tecalitlán. The album, titled &quot;Juan Gabriel con el Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlán&quot; (1974), includes songs like &quot;Se Me Olvidó Otra Vez&quot; and &quot;Lágrimas y Lluvia&quot;. In 1975, he made his acting debut in the film &quot;Nobleza ranchera&quot;, acting with Sara García and Verónica Castro.

Over fifteen years, Juan Gabriel&#x27;s fame grew as he recorded 15 albums and sold 20 million records. He wrote and recorded over 1000 songs in a variety of music genre. Juan Gabriel established himself as Mexico&#x27;s leading commercial singer-songwriter, penning in many diverse styles such as rancheras with mariachi, ballads, pop, rock, disco, with an incredible string of hits for himself and for leading Latin singers including among many others Lucha Villa, Daniela Romo and Ana Gabriel and international stars Luis Miguel, Rocío Dúrcal and José José who in 1978 achieved international recognition thanks to Aguilera&#x27;s ballad &quot;Lo Pasado, Pasado&quot;. His lyrics dealt with heartbreak and romantic relationships that became hymns throughout Latin America, Spain, and the United States. In 1984, his song &quot;Querida&quot; (Darling) remained at number one for the entire year on the Mexican charts. He also received a Grammy nomination for &quot;Best Latin Pop Album&quot; for Recuerdos, Vol. II, which includes the single.
His work as an arranger, producer and songwriter throughout the subsequent decades brought him into contact with the leading Latin artists of the day, including Rocío Dúrcal and Isabel Pantoja. In addition to recording numerous hits on his own, Juan Gabriel has produced albums for Dúrcal, Lucha Villa, Lola Beltrán and Paul Anka. In 1984, he released &quot;Recuerdos, Vol. II&quot; which one source says is the best-selling album of all time in Mexico with sales of over eight million copies. In 1990 Juan Gabriel became the first non-classical act to perform at the Palacio de Bellas Artes. The proceeds from the three sold-out concerts were given to the National Symphony Orchestra. On 31 July 2000, a telenovela titled &quot;Abrázame Muy Fuerte&quot; began broadcasting in Mexico. Salvador Mejía, the producer, choose to use the song of the same name as its main theme. &quot;Abrázame Muy Fuerte&quot; ended 2001 as the most successful Latin single of the year. For the song, Juan Gabriel won two Billboard Latin Music Awards in 2002 for Hot Latin Track of the Year and Latin Pop Airplay Track of the Year; and also received the Songwriter of the Year award. The song ranked seventh at the Hot Latin Songs 25th Anniversary chart. &quot;Abrázame Muy Fuerte&quot; also was awarded for Pop Song of the Year at the 2002 Lo Nuestro Awards. At the time of his death, Juan Gabriel was touring the United States and was scheduled to perform at a concert in El Paso, Texas, that same day. He also had four albums which reached number one on the Top Latin Albums from 2015 and 2016, including &quot;Vestido de Etiqueta por Eduardo Magallanes&quot;, which reached number one a week before he died. He holds the record for most albums peaking at number one on the Top Latin Albums chart in a short period time.

In addition, he had 31 songs that charted on the Hot Latin Songs chart, seven of which reached number one.

===BMG copyright dispute===

Between 1986 and 1994, Juan Gabriel refused to record any material because of a dispute with BMG over copyrights to his songs. He continued his career in live stage performances, setting attendance records throughout Latin America. By 1994 the copyright dispute reached a resolution under an agreement whereby ownership of the songs reverted to Juan Gabriel over a specified time period. After this dispute, which lasted 8 years, he released an album titled, &quot;Gracias Por Esperar,&quot; which in English, translates to, &quot;Thank You For Waiting&quot;. The record label then selected eleven previously released tracks from Juan Gabriel&#x27;s catalog in order to release &quot;Debo Hacerlo&quot;, the last new song recorded by the artist.

==Personal life==
Juan Gabriel was never married. He had six children, four of them having a version in different languages of the name John. The mother of four of his children (Iván Gabriel, Joan Gabriel, Hans Gabriel and Jean Gabriel) is Laura Salas. Juan Gabriel stated that Salas was &quot;the best friend of my life&quot; (&quot;la mejor amiga de mi vida&quot; in Spanish). Nearly a month after his death, the news program &quot;Primer Impacto&quot; discovered that Juan Gabriel had a fifth child, a son named Luis Alberto Aguilera, living in Las Vegas. The two maintained a long-distance relationship, primarily communicating via e-mail. The mother of his fifth child is Guadalupe Gonzalez, who worked as Juan Gabriel&#x27;s domestic employee. On 26 October 2016, &quot;Primer Impacto&quot; found the sixth child of Juan Gabriel, named Joao Gabriel, living in Los Angeles, California. Joao&#x27;s mother is Consuelo Rosales, who also worked as Juan Gabriel&#x27;s domestic employee. Genetic testing was conducted to assess Juan Gabriel&#x27;s parentage of Luis Alberto and Joao, with genetic material provided by Juan Gabriel&#x27;s brother Pablo Aguilera.

Although he was widely assumed to be gay, Juan Gabriel never explicitly talked about his sexuality. However, as he got older he began to give implicit responses towards questions about his sexuality, saying to interviewers &quot;Lo que se ve no se pregunta&quot; (&quot;what one sees doesn&#x27;t have to be asked about&quot;). Some may interpret this to be an implicit affirmation of homosexuality, while others have interpreted this to be an affirmation of heterosexuality, due to the female romantic partners he had.

On 14 November 2005, Juan Gabriel was injured when he fell from the stage at the Toyota Center in Houston, Texas, and was hospitalized at Texas Medical Center. He sustained a cervical fracture on his neck, forcing him to suspend playing on the tour and resulting in him being bedridden for eight months.

=== Political views ===
Juan Gabriel was a lifelong supporter of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which governed Mexico from 1929 to 2000 and governed Mexico again from 2012 to 2018. In 1994, he stated that &quot;his best friends [were] from the PRI&quot; and he campaigned in support of then-presidential PRI candidate Ernesto Zedillo. In the 2000 election he again campaigned for the PRI candidate, Francisco Labastida (who eventually lost the election). In 2015, he wrote a letter to the then-President of Mexico Enrique Peña Nieto (a member of the PRI), expressing his support for his administration and for the PRI, which he stated, &quot;will never go away&quot;.

==Death==

On 28 August 2016, Juan Gabriel died in Santa Monica, California, reportedly from a heart attack. Gabriel&#x27;s body was cremated; his ashes were returned to a house he owned in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, after receiving tributes from the city and Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City. An autopsy was not performed to determine the cause of death.

==Charitable work==
Juan Gabriel continued to do 10 to 12 performances per year as benefit concerts for his favorite children&#x27;s homes, usually posing for pictures with his fans and forwarding the proceeds from the photo ops to support Mexican orphans. In 1987, he founded Semjase, a house for orphaned and underserved children located in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua. It serves school children between the ages of 6 and 12.

==Legacy and impact==

In 2015, &quot;Billboard&quot; listed Juan Gabriel among their list of the 30 most influential Latino artists in history, citing his &quot;dramatic performance style&quot; and his redefined concept of romantic Latin pop music. The publication noted Gabriel&#x27;s appeal among several generations of Latino Americans and artists. In his list of the most influential Latin music artists in history, Carlos Quintana of About.com, ranked Juan Gabriel number six for shaping &quot;the sounds of Mexican music&quot; and exploring genres from ranchera to Latin pop. In 1986, Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley declared 5 October Juan Gabriel day. He received the Lo Nuestro Excellence Award in 1991. In 1996, he was inducted into the &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Music Hall of Fame, while in 2003 he was inducted into the International Latin Music Hall of Fame, and posthumously inducted into the Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame in October 2016. In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Juan Gabriel at number 172 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.
The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) honored Juan Gabriel the Latin Songwriter of the Year Award in 1995, 1996, and 1998. In 1999, Gabriel received the People&#x27;s Choice Awards for Best Regional Artist. That same year, he received the La Opinión Tributo Nacional for Lifetime Achievement Award. A statue was erected by &quot;Billboard&quot; at Mexico City&#x27;s Plaza Garibaldi in 2001, and remains a popular destination for mariachi performances. In 2009, the singer was honored as the Latin Recording Academy&#x27;s Person of the Year. He also received his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in May 2002.

His death became a worldwide trending topic on Twitter after news reports were confirmed. President of Mexico Enrique Peña Nieto, called him one of Mexico&#x27;s &quot;greatest musical icons&quot;. United States President Barack Obama also commented on Juan Gabriel&#x27;s death and complimented his music for &quot;transcending borders and generations&quot; and that &quot;his spirit will live on in his enduring songs, and in the hearts of the fans who love him&quot;. Gabriel Abaroa, the CEO of the Latin Recording Academy, said his legacy was &quot;much more than one or hundreds of songs; he composed philosophy&quot; and that Juan Gabriel &quot;broke taboos, devoured stages and conquered diverse audiences&quot;. Leila Cobo of &quot;Billboard&quot; proclaimed Juan Gabriel as a &quot;prodigal performer&quot; and noted that his songs were &quot;romantic, colloquial, emotional compositions that sometimes rambled but managed to strike a universal chord with lyrics that could apply to many people and many situations.&quot;
Gabriel&#x27;s songs have been covered by artists such as Rocío Dúrcal, Gloria Trevi, La India, and Marc Anthony, the latter of whom credits his song &quot;Hasta Que Te Conocí&quot; as the inspiration to launch his career in Latin music. Tribute albums to Gabriel have been recorded by several artists including Cristian Castro, Pedro Fernández, Lorenzo Antonio, Álvaro Torres, Los Tri-O, Nydia Rojas, and La India. A television series based on Gabriel&#x27;s life titled &quot;Hasta que te conocí&quot;, began airing on 18 April 2016, and the series ended on 28 August, coincidentally the same day Gabriel died. He was portrayed by Colombian actor Julián Román and Juan Gabriel served as the executive producer.

<text>California State University, Chico (Chico State) is a public university in Chico, California. It was founded in 1887 as one of about 180 &quot;normal schools&quot; founded by state governments in the 19th century to train teachers for the rapidly growing public common schools. Some closed but most steadily expanded their role and became state colleges in the early 20th century and state universities in the late 20th century. It is the second oldest campus in the California State University system. As of the fall 2020 semester, the university had a total enrollment of 16,630 students. The university offers 126 bachelor&#x27;s degree programs, 35 master&#x27;s degree programs, and four types of teaching credentials. Chico is a Hispanic-serving institution (HSI).

On March 12, 1887, a legislative act was enacted to create the Northern Branch of the California State Normal School. Less than a month later, Chico was chosen as the location. In 1887, General John Bidwell donated of land from his cherry orchard. On July 4, 1888, the first cornerstone was laid. On September 3, 1889, doors opened for the 90 enrolled students. The library opened on January 11, 1890, with 350 books. On June 20, 1891, the first graduation took place, a class of 15.

In 1910, Annie Kennedy Bidwell donated an additional of land to be used for work with elementary agriculture. The next year Mrs. Bidwell donated an orange orchard lot 55 × as the children&#x27;s playground, which is connected to the Training School. Twenty years later in 1921, legislation was enacted to change the school&#x27;s name to Chico State Teacher&#x27;s College. In 1922, Chico State Teacher&#x27;s College added a junior college curriculum and awarded a certificate after two years. Also in 1922, Bidwell Mansion was turned into a women&#x27;s dormitory. In 1923 the first college paper, &quot;The Collegian&quot;, was published. In 1924, the state Board of Education allowed the school to grant baccalaureate degrees. Also in 1924, the wildcat was chosen as the mascot. In 1927 a gym was built on the grounds of Bidwell Mansion. In 1929, the cornerstone for the new administration building was laid on top of Normal Building&#x27;s original cornerstone.

In 1935, Bidwell Hall was turned into a recreation and student center—the first student union. Also in 1935 a legislative act changed the college name from Chico State Teachers College to Chico State College. In 1937 evening classes started on campus and athletic fields were purchased from the Chico Board of Education.

In 1948, dorms for 500 male students were set up on west side of Warner Street. The buildings were built during World War II and were used as bachelor quarters for a Marine Hospital in Klamath Falls, Oregon.

In 1950, California&#x27;s governor allowed state colleges to grant Master of Arts degrees. In 1951 the college reorganized from 18 departments into seven divisions with chairmen. Then in 1956 a new flagpost and sign in front of Kendall Hall was donated by the class of 1956. In the following year, 1957, a new cafeteria was built and the rose gardens were planted. In 1958 the first &quot;telecourse&quot; was taught, Psychology 51.

In 1972, Chico State College became California State University, Chico.

In 1975, broadcasts of classes through closed-circuit television were used for the first time by residents in Oroville, Marysville and Colusa. Also in 1975,&quot; The Orion&quot;, the campus student newspaper, published its first issue. In 1977, the other campus paper, &quot;The Wildcat&quot;, changed its name to &quot;Chico News and Review&quot; and moved off campus to become an independent publication. In 1978 bike riding was restricted on campus.

In 1987, Chico State was ranked as the top party school in the nation by &quot;Playboy.&quot;

CSU Chico opened its first sub-campus in Redding, affiliated with Shasta College, in 2007.

In 2005, student Matt Carrington was hazed to death at the Chi Tau (local) house, which had previously been expelled from the university in 2001 due to violations. Carrington died as a result of water intoxication during a hazing session involving the victim being forced to exercise and drink large quantities of water.

In 2010, the President of the Associated Student body, Joseph Igbineweka, was stabbed in a racially motivated attack.

<doc id="355577" wikidata="Q726119" url="?curid=355577" title="Yuji Naka">
<text>, credited in some games as YU2, is a Japanese video game developer. He is the co-creator of the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; series and was the president of Sonic Team at Sega until his departure in 2006.

Naka joined Sega in 1984 and worked on games including &quot;Girl&#x27;s Garden&quot; (1985) and &quot;Phantasy Star II&quot; (1989). He was the lead programmer of the original &quot;Sonic&quot; games on the Mega Drive in the early 1990s, which greatly increased Sega&#x27;s market share. After developing &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; (1991) in Japan, Naka moved to California to develop &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot; (1992), &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&quot; (1994) and &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot; (1994) with Sega Technical Institute.

Naka returned to Japan to lead development on Sonic Team games including &quot;Nights into Dreams&quot; (1996), &quot;Burning Rangers&quot; (1998), &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; (1998) and &quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot; (2000). After Sega left the console market in 2001, Naka remained as an executive officer and oversaw its output for the next five years.

In 2006, Naka left Sega and founded the independent game company Prope. He joined Square Enix to direct the platform game &quot;Balan Wonderworld&quot; (2021), which reunited him with &quot;Sonic&quot; co-creator Naoto Ohshima. Naka said he was removed from the project six months before &quot;Balan Wonderworld&quot; was released, and it underperformed critically and commercially. He left Square Enix in April 2021. In 2023, Naka was found guilty of insider trading at Square Enix.

== Early life ==
Naka was born on September 17, 1965, in Hirakata, Osaka. He learned to program by replicating and debugging video game code printed in magazines. The experience prompted him to study assemblers and practice writing code during his school classes. After graduating, Naka decided not to enroll in university and stayed in Osaka.

== Career ==

=== 1983–1989: Beginnings at Sega ===
Around 1983, Naka saw that the video game company Sega was looking for programming assistants and applied. Following a brief interview, he began working for Sega in April 1984. His first task was designing maps and checking floppy disks for &quot;Lode Runner&quot; for the SG-1000; he could not recall if the game was released. His first major project was &quot;Girl&#x27;s Garden&quot; (1985), which he and the composer Hiroshi Kawaguchi created as part of their training process. Their boss was impressed and decided to publish the game, and it earned them notice among their peers and Japanese gamers. Naka felt embarrassed about his code, and did not want to release the game. He developed games going with the flow, and did not do task management at all. The pace of game development was 1 game every one or two months, and he was essentially living at the company; he recalled bragging with Yu Suzuki on who worked more overtime.

During the Master System era, Naka wanted to develop games that were not possible on Nintendo&#x27;s Famicom. Examples of this include the 3D dungeons of &quot;Phantasy Star&quot; and ports of &quot;Space Harrier&quot; and &quot;OutRun,&quot; which ran on powerful arcade hardware. The Mega Drive was introduced suddenly, much like the Master System. It was only around the 32X&#x27;s release in 1994 that Sega gave Naka information about hardware beforehand. &quot;Super Thunder Blade&quot; was the first game he programmed for the Mega Drive. He requested that sprite-scaling be implemented in future models of the console. However, he was told that it was not possible at the time. He also requested a 6Mbit cartridge for &quot;Phantasy Star II&quot;, which got through. The Mega Drive was Naka&#x27;s favourite hardware, and he said that he could have kept working on it forever just by making the clock speed faster.

During a visit to the 1988 Amusement Machines Show, Naka was impressed by the ability to move diagonally on slopes in a demonstration of Capcom&#x27;s game &quot;Ghouls &#x27;n Ghosts&quot;. Hoping to recreate it, he asked his supervisors at Sega to allow him to port the game to the Mega Drive. Capcom provided him with the source code and ROM data. As he was developing the port, he experimented with aspects such as the speed of the main character to understand how they interacted with the environment. He also altered the slopes and was able to create a functioning 360-degree loop. Sprite-scaling was still a technique that Naka wanted to improve his skill on with a game called &quot;Metal Lancer&quot;, but it was cancelled halfway through development.

=== 1989–1991: &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; ===

Sega&#x27;s president Hayao Nakayama decided that Sega needed a flagship series and mascot to compete with Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Mario&quot; franchise. Of Naka&#x27;s numerous development plans, &quot;a game to beat Super Mario&quot;, caught a superior&#x27;s attention. Naka created a prototype platform game that involved a fast-moving character rolling in a ball through a long winding tube. The idea for a hedgehog that could roll into a ball by jumping and attacking enemies came from his high school notebook, and he was unsure whether to use it. This concept was expanded out with character design by Naoto Ohshima and levels conceived by Hirokazu Yasuhara. Naka hoped to showcase the Mega Drive&#x27;s processing speed through fast and exhilarating gameplay. Part of his approach was based on his experience playing through the original &quot;Super Mario Bros&quot; (1985); he wondered why he could not complete each level faster the better he became at playing the game. The development took longer than any game Naka worked on before, and he worked only on this game for approximately a year and a half.

&quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; was released in 1991 and received acclaim; it greatly increased the popularity of the Sega Genesis in North America, and is credited with helping Sega gain 65% of the market share against Nintendo. Naka was dissatisfied at Sega, feeling he received little credit for the success, and quit.

=== 1991–1994: &quot;Sonic&quot; sequels and time in California ===
Naka rejoined Sega when he was hired by Mark Cerny to work at Sega Technical Institute (STI) in California, with a higher salary and more creative freedom. At STI, Naka led development on &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot;. It was another major success, but its development suffered from the language barrier and cultural differences between the Japanese and American developers. The artist Craig Stitt described Naka as &quot;an arrogant pain in the ass&quot; who was not interested in working with Americans. Another artist, Tim Skelly, said that Naka would have been happier working with an all-Japanese team.

After &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot; was released in 1992, Naka refused to develop another &quot;Sonic&quot; game with the American staff. A Japanese-only team was formed, led by Naka, and developed &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&quot; and &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot;, both released in 1994. Originally, Naka wanted to make &quot;Sonic 3&quot; a 3D game, with the SVP chip that was also used to port &quot;Virtua Racing&quot; to the Genesis. However, it took too long, and a McDonalds Happy Meal promotion was put in place, and to complete the game in time, it was decided that it to make a 2D game again. Once again, Naka had a specific hardware request with the lock-on cartridge technology of &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot;, which when combined would form the complete experience, as &quot;Sonic 3&quot; was rushed to meet a deadline.

=== 1994–1998: Return to Japan and Sega Saturn ===
Following the release of &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot;, Naka returned to Japan, having been offered a role as a producer. As managing director Hisashi Suzuki brought in videotapes of &quot;Virtua Racing&quot; and &quot;Virtua Fighter,&quot; Naka was so impressed that it partly contributed to him going back to Japan. With Naka&#x27;s return, Sonic Team was officially formed as a brand, and began work on a new intellectual property, &quot;Nights into Dreams&quot; (1996), for Sega&#x27;s 32-bit Saturn console. Naka did not have any desire to develop for the 32X, and was disappointed that the Saturn was not true 3D. Observing the development environment he did not want to make a Sonic game right away, and instead created &quot;Nights&quot;. He persuaded his superiors that &quot;Nights&quot; would only take one year and that he would work on a 3D Sonic in 1997. However, the development took longer than expected. Naka regretted that he was not able to deliver a &quot;Sonic&quot; game for the Saturn, as this was often cited as a reason for the console&#x27;s failure.

Meanwhile, in America, STI worked on &quot;Sonic X-treme&quot;, a 3D &quot;Sonic&quot; game. Development was hindered by numerous setbacks, culminating in its cancellation in 1996. Reportedly, Naka contributed to the cancellation by refusing to let STI use the &quot;Nights&quot; game engine and threatening to quit. The &quot;X-treme&quot; developer Chris Senn dismissed the story as speculation but said that, if true, he understood Naka&#x27;s interest in maintaining control over the Sonic Team technology and the &quot;Sonic&quot; franchise. Sonic Team was developing its own 3D &quot;Sonic&quot; game using the &quot;Nights&quot; engine, which could have motivated Naka&#x27;s threat. In July 2022, Naka denied that he had anything to do with &quot;X-treme&quot; use of the &quot;Nights&quot; engine and said it would have been useless because &quot;Nights&quot; was coded in assembly and &quot;X-treme&quot; was in C. He suggested that the developers invented the story to rationalize their failure to finish &quot;X-treme&quot;.

=== 1998–2001: Dreamcast ===
While &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; was in development for the Saturn, Naka was part of the &quot;Dream Team Meetings&quot; which involved talking about plans of what eventually became the Dreamcast as early as 1996. Sonic Team proposed the name &quot;G-Cube&quot;. Naka also proposed a multimedia concept that involved talking to a built in microphone to switch TV channels. This method of communication was then used in &quot;Seaman&quot;.

In 1998, prior to the launch of Dreamcast, Naka and his team visited Sega of America to tour their development offices and observe their work on the game &quot;Geist Force&quot;, a rail shooter for Dreamcast. According to the producer Mark Subotnick, Naka told his team in Japanese which parts they would take to incorporate in &quot;Sonic&quot; games and suggested firing all but one of the engineers. Unbeknownst to Naka, several of the &quot;Geist Force&quot; developers understood Japanese and quit, contributing to the project&#x27;s cancellation.

Shortly after the Japanese launch of the Dreamcast and &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot;, Naka was contacted by Sega Chairman Isao Okawa to develop a flagship online game for the Dreamcast. Originally, Naka was unenthusiastic about the idea given his team&#x27;s inexperience with creating online games. However, the other Sega development studios were preoccupied with their own demanding projects such as &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; series and &quot;Jet Set Radio&quot; (2000). This left Sonic Team as the only other alternative that Okawa could rely on. In addition to their inexperience, Naka and his team saw the creation of an online game for Japan, a nation of console gamers, as a serious challenge, akin to creating a new genre. This was further complicated by the perception of online games in the late 1990s having boring visuals and the per-minute fee for dial-up internet in Japan.

Naka split his team into three groups, all serving different purposes, before rejoining to develop &quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot; (2001). Two groups were focused on discovering the limits of the Dreamcast&#x27;s capabilities, specifically in terms of graphical fidelity and the possibilities of online play on the system. The other group would work on various projects under Naka&#x27;s supervision that would lead them closer to their goal. This would culminate with the release of Sonic Team&#x27;s &quot;Chu Chu Rocket&quot; (1999), an action-puzzle game and the first game for the system to support online console gaming. Additionally, it was the only game directed by Naka at Sega as he would move on to become a producer, overseeing output from Sonic Team. Following &quot;Chu Chu Rocket&quot;&#x27;s release, all three teams collaborated on the development of &quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot;. It is reported that after Okawa became ill in 2000, Naka would send reports to the hospital, updating him on the team&#x27;s progress.

In 2000, Sega began to restructure its development operations as part of the dissolution of Sega Enterprises, transforming its arcade and console studios into semi-autonomous subsidiary companies. While each studio was given an unprecedented amount of creative freedom, Naka felt it important to preserve the Sonic Team brand name, and therefore the legal name of the company was SONICTEAM, Ltd. Naka was installed as the CEO of the new company.

=== 2001–2006: Final years at Sega ===
In March 2001, Sega discontinued the Dreamcast and left the video game hardware market. Sega&#x27;s semiautonomous entities were reabsorbed, including Sonic Team. Naka remained as an executive officer, overseeing all of Sega&#x27;s output until his departure in 2006. According to the former Sega producer Takashi Yuda, senior Sega figures including Toshihiro Nagoshi and Yu Suzuki were reporting to Naka. In late 2001 or early 2002, Peter Moore, the president of Sega of America, arranged focus groups with teenagers and found that Sega&#x27;s reputation was declining. According to Moore, Naka responded angrily and accused Moore of having falsified the findings. 

After Sega left the hardware market, Sonic Team began developing for consoles by other manufacturers; Naka became fond of the Nintendo GameCube. He regretted that he did not bring &quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot; to the PlayStation 2, as &quot;Monster Hunter&quot; came out in 2004 and became popular.
=== 2006–2016: Prope ===
On March 16, 2006, Naka announced that he would leave Sega to create his own game studio, Prope. He said he considered it a benefit to be able to create games other than &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; games. Naka also explained that the video game industry was young, leading to quick promotions; he felt his senior position had given him less time to be close to development. The last &quot;Sonic&quot; game Naka was involved was &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; (2006). He regretted leaving Sega during the middle of its development as it was poorly received.

Naka and Prope developed small games for the Wii and mobile devices, such as &quot;Wii Play: Motion&quot; and &quot;Ivy The Kiwi?&quot;. This included a reunion with Sega as they published &quot;Let&#x27;s Tap&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Catch&quot; for the Wii. Naka explained that while it was uncommon in the west, he always maintained a strong relationship with the company despite his departure. 

The games helped finance their first large-scale production, &quot;Rodea the Sky Soldier&quot;, which finished development in 2011 but was not released until 2015. According to Naka, the publisher, Kadokawa Games, would not release the game until they developed a version for the Nintendo 3DS. Following the launch of the Nintendo Wii U in 2012, Kadakowa opted to create a Wii U version based on the 3DS version, delaying it until 2015. In November 2015, Kadokawa Games released &quot;Rodea the Sky Soldier&quot; on the 3DS and Wii U, while packaging Naka and Prope&#x27;s Wii version as bonus bundled with the initial print of the Wii U version. In response, Naka used his social media following to request people prioritize playing the Wii version. Naka was awarded with the Bizkaia Award at the Fun &amp; Serious Game Festival in 2016.

=== 2016–2022: Square Enix and &quot;Balan Wonderworld&quot; ===

In 2018, Naka joined Square Enix to form the subsidiary developer Balan Company, which aimed to facilitate collaboration between internal and external staff. Naka described Balan Company as a collective of designers and artists focusing on genres outside the norms of Square Enix. Prope remained in business, but with Naka its only employee.

Balan Company&#x27;s first game, &quot;Balan Wonderworld&quot;, was co-developed by Arzest, a company which had previously co-developed multiple projects for Nintendo and Mistwalker. A key staff member at Arzest was Naoto Ohshima, a former Sega artist who created the designs for Sonic the Hedgehog and Doctor Eggman. When Naka joined Square Enix in January 2018, he considered making social mobile games, but was encouraged by Shinji Hashimoto to make action games for the new market, which was seeing a resurgence in classic action and platform games. Naka approached Ohshima about a collaboration, their first since &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; in 1998.

Following disagreements with staff, Naka was removed from the project approximately six months before &quot;Balan Wonderworld&quot; was released. It received generally negative reviews and underperformed commercially. Naka left Square Enix in April 2021. On December 22, 2021, Naka released a free mobile game, &quot;Shot2048,&quot; similar to the games &quot;2048&quot; and &quot;Chain Cube&quot;. 

In April 2022, Naka announced that he had sued Square Enix. He said he had attempted to negotiate to address problems with &quot;Balan Wonderworld&quot;, but was ignored, and said Square Enix and Arzest did not &quot;value games or game fans&quot;. In July, Naka tweeted a photo of the &quot;Nights&quot; team with Ohshima&#x27;s face blacked out, and expressed his anger over &quot;Balan Wonderworld&quot;.

== Insider trading charges ==
On November 17, 2022, Naka was arrested by the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office and charged with violating the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act of 2006. The Public Prosecutors Office accused him of insider trading; Naka bought 10,000 shares of the developer Aiming before its game &quot;Dragon Quest Tact&quot; was announced to the public. Two other former Square Enix employees were also arrested, alleged to have bought 162,000 shares between December 2019 and February 2020 for approximately 47.2 million yen.

On December 7, Naka was arrested again, accused of having purchased 144.7 million yen of shares of the developer ATeam before their game &quot;Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier&quot; was announced. He was later indicted on insider trading charges by the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office. Naka admitted his guilt in March 2023. On June 1, prosecutors asked for a sentence of two and a half years in prison and a combined fine of 172.5 million yen. On July 7, a Tokyo District Court judge gave Naka a sentence of two years and six months in prison, suspended for four years. The judge ordered Naka to forfeit 171 million yen and pay a fine of two million yen.

Following the charges, Naka made no public statements for 16 months. In April 2024, he ended his social media hiatus to respond to the news that Yu Miyake, &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; executive producer, was being reassigned to Square Enix&#x27;s mobile division by accusing him of lying during the trial. Miyake was credited as executive officer on &quot;Balan Wonderworld&quot;.

==Personal life==
Naka is a racer and car enthusiast, having mentioned his Ferrari 360 Spider in multiple interviews. In November 2004, he competed in round six of the Kumho Tyres Lotus Championship in Tasmania. In April 2022, Naka participated in the first round of the Elise Super Tech competition at the Mobility Resort Motegi circuit, finishing seventh place.

<text>San Nicolas Island (Spanish: &quot;Isla de San Nicolás&quot;; Tongva: &quot;Haraasnga&quot;) is the most remote of the Channel Islands, off Southern California, from the nearest point on the mainland coast. It is part of Ventura County. The island is currently controlled by the United States Navy and is used as a weapons testing and training facility, served by Naval Outlying Landing Field San Nicolas Island. The uninhabited island is defined by the United States Census Bureau as Block Group 9, Census Tract 36.04 of Ventura County, California. The Nicoleño Native American tribe inhabited the island until 1835. As of the 2000 U.S. Census, the island has since remained officially uninhabited, though the census estimates that at least 200 military and civilian personnel live on the island at any given time. The island has a small airport, though the runway is the second-longest in Ventura County (slightly behind the one at Naval Air Station Point Mugu). Additionally, there are several buildings including telemetry reception antennas.
==History==
Archaeological evidence suggests that San Nicolas Island has been occupied by humans for at least 10,000 years. For thousands of years, San Nicolas was the home of the Nicoleño people, who were probably related to the Tongva of the mainland and Santa Catalina Island. It was named for Saint Nicholas by Spanish explorer Sebastián Vizcaíno after he sighted the island on the saint&#x27;s feast day (December 6) in 1602. Russians called the island Il&#x27;men, after the name of the maritime fur trade ship that reached it, &quot;Il’mena&quot;. The Nicoleños were forcibly removed in the early 19th century by the padres of the California mission system. Within a few years of their removal from the island, the Nicoleño people and their unique language became extinct.

===Lone Woman of San Nicolas Island===

The most famous resident of San Nicolas Island was the &quot;Lone Woman of San Nicolas Island&quot;, christened Juana Maria; her birth name was never known to anyone on the mainland. She was left behind (explanations for this vary) when the rest of the Nicoleños were moved to the mainland. She resided on the island alone for 18 years before she was found by Captain George Nidever and his crew in 1853 and taken to Santa Barbara. Her story is famously fictionalized in the award-winning children&#x27;s novel &quot;Island of the Blue Dolphins&quot; by Scott O&#x27;Dell.

===Whaling===
The steam-schooner &quot;California&quot; and its two whale catchers &quot;Hawk&quot; and &quot;Port Saunders&quot; operated off San Nicolas in 1932 and 1937, catching about 30 fin whales off the island from October to early December in the former year.

===Munitions testing===

San Nicolas Island was one of eight candidate sites to detonate the first atomic bomb before White Sands Proving Ground was selected for the Trinity nuclear test. Between 1957 and 1973, and in 2004 and again in 2010, U.S. military research rockets were launched from San Nicolas Island. The launchpad was situated at . It remains part of the Pacific Missile Range.

San Nicolas Island currently serves as a detachment of Naval Base Ventura County. In addition to the Port Hueneme and Point Mugu, San Nicolas Island is military-owned and -operated.

The island belongs to the U.S. Navy and is part of the Naval Air Center&#x27;s Sea Test Range associated with the Naval Air Warfare Center, Weapons Division at Point Mugu. The island has a runway, communications and missile tracking equipment, and missile and target launch areas. There are also mock cities used for urban warfare training.

==Geography==
The highest point is Jackson Hill, with an elevation of above sea level.
===Geology===
Composed primarily of Eocene sandstone and shale, much of the island also has marine terrace deposits of Pleistocene age, indicating that it was probably completely submerged at that time. The entire western part of the island is covered with reddish-brown eolian dune deposits laid down during the early Holocene. In some places these deposits are more than deep. Small quantities of volcanic rocks (primarily andesite) exist on the southeast end of the island.

Stone available to natives for tool making on San Nicolas Island was largely limited to metavolcanic (including porphyritic metavolcanic) and metasedimentary (mainly quartzite) rock. The metavolcanics are found in the form of cobbles within conglomerates and cobble-bearing mudstones. This material is dense and not easily workable.

===Climate===
Under the Köppen climate classification, San Nicolas Island features a semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSk&quot;) with mediterranean characteristics. Winters are mild with an average temperature of in February, the coolest month, and is the season where most of the precipitation falls. Summers are dry and warm with an average of in September, indicating a seasonal lag. Temperatures above are rare, occurring on 2 days per summer. The average annual precipitation is , with the wettest month being February and the driest month being August. On average, there are 36 days with measurable precipitation.
===Biota===
==== Flora ====
There is little ecological diversity on San Nicolas Island. The island was heavily grazed by sheep until they were removed in 1943. Overgrazing and erosion have removed much of the topsoil from the island. Despite the degradation, three endemic plants are found on the island: &quot;Astragalus traskiae&quot;, &quot;Eriogonum grande&quot; subspecies &quot;timorum&quot;, and &quot;Lomatium insulare&quot;.

The dominant plant community on the island is coastal bluff scrubland, with giant coreopsis (&quot;Coreopsis gigantea&quot;) and coyote brush (&quot;Baccharis pilularis&quot;) being the most visible components. The few trees present today, including California fan palms (&quot;Washingtonia filifera&quot;), were introduced in modern times. However, early written accounts and the remains of ancient plants in the form of calcareous root casts indicate that, prior to 1860, brush covered a portion of the island.

The absence of grazing animals on San Nicolas Island serves to protect the highly developed biological soil crusts that cover much of the island&#x27;s land area. Although few studies on the island&#x27;s microbial biodiversity have been conducted, preliminary evidence suggests San Nicolas holds significant algal diversity. The island&#x27;s terrestrial cyanobacteria appear to be particularly diverse, and several new endemic species have been recently described.

==== Fauna ====

There are only three species of endemic land vertebrates on the island: the island night lizard (&quot;Xantusia riversiana&quot;), deer mouse (&quot;Peromyscus maniculatus exterus&quot;), and island fox (&quot;Urocyon littoralis dickeyi&quot;). Two other reptiles, the common side-blotched lizard (&quot;Uta stansburiana&quot;) and the southern alligator lizard (&quot;Elgaria multicarinatus&quot;), were at one time thought to be endemic, but an analysis of mitochondrial DNA indicates that both species were most likely introduced in recent times.

More than 10 endemic molluscs are known only from San Nicolas Island. These are &quot;Binneya notabilis&quot;, &quot;Catinella rehderi&quot;, &quot;Haplotrema duranti duranti&quot;, &quot;Micrarionta feralis&quot;, &quot;Micrarionta micromphala&quot;, &quot;M. opuntia&quot;, &quot;M. sodalis&quot;, &quot;Nearctula rowellii longii&quot;, &quot;Sterkia clementina&quot;, and &quot;Xerarionta tryoni&quot; (ssp. &quot;tryoni&quot; and &quot;hemphilli&quot;).

Large numbers of birds can be found on San Nicolas Island. Two species are of particular ecological concern: the western gull (&quot;Larus occidentalis&quot;) and Brandt&#x27;s cormorant (&quot;Phalacrocorax penicillatus&quot;), which are threatened by island foxes.

==Conservation and restoration==

The common housecat was one of the greatest threats to the island&#x27;s wildlife until they were eradicated from the island by the US Navy with the support of Island Conservation and the Humane Society of the United States in 2009. The cats killed cormorants, gulls, and the island night lizard and competed with the endemic Island fox. The cats arrived on the island before 1952, probably brought by navy officers who worked there. All cats were relocated to a specially prepared habitat in Ramona, in San Diego County, with the assistance of the Humane Society of the United States. Cats were officially declared eradicated in 2012. The eradication effort took 18 months and cost $3 million.

Channel Islands Restoration (CIR) works with the U.S. Navy on restoration projects throughout San Nicolas Island. Together they have rebuilt and expanded an old native plant nursery. CIR has been eradicating several invasive species on the island, including Sahara mustard from the habitat of &quot;Cryptantha traskiae&quot;, a threatened plant in the Borage family. CIR has worked to restore San Nicolas Night Lizard (&quot;Xantusia riversiana riversiana&quot;) habitat with extensive plantings of prickly pear cactus (&quot;Opuntia littoralis&quot;). The shelter-providing habitat has helped to increase night lizard populations. This night lizard species is endemic to only three of the eight Channel Islands and was recently removed from the endangered species list due to conservation efforts.

<text>The year 1791 in music involved some significant events.

==Events==
*January 1 – Austrian composer Joseph Haydn arrives in England at the invitation of London resident impresario Johann Peter Salomon; here his concerts are huge successes. On March 11, the first of his London symphonies, Symphony No. 96, is premièred at the Hanover Square Rooms. On July 8 he is awarded an honorary doctorate of music at the University of Oxford and probably conducts his Symphony No. 92 in the Sheldonian Theatre as part of the ceremonials.
*Mid-July – An emissary of Count Franz von Walsegg commissions a &quot;Requiem&quot; for the late Countess Anna from Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
*August 24 – Official opening of the Teatro Riccardi opera house in Bergamo, Lombardy, with a production of Pietro Metastasio&#x27;s &quot;Didone abbandonata&quot; set to music by multiple composers including Ferdinando Bertoni, Giacomo Rampini, Johann Gottlieb Naumann, Giuseppe Gazzaniga and Giovanni Paisiello.
*September 6 – Première of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&#x27;s &quot;opera seria&quot; &quot;La clemenza di Tito&quot; (&quot;The Clemency of Titus&quot;, K. 621, with libretto adapted by Caterino Mazzolà after Metastasio) at the Estates Theatre in Prague with Mozart conducting and the castrato Domenico Bedini playing Sesto. It has been written in around 18 days (after most of &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; has been completed) to a commission by Domenico Guardasoni to mark the coronation of Leopold II as King of Bohemia, after Salieri had declined the commission. 
*September 30 – Première of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Singspiel&quot; opera &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; (&quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot;, K. 620) at the Freihaus-Theater auf der Wieden in suburban Vienna with Mozart conducting, probably from the keyboard, the librettist (and theatre proprietor) Emanuel Schikaneder playing Papageno and Mozart&#x27;s sister-in-law Josepha Hofer playing the Queen of the Night.
*December 5 (01:00) – Death of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, age 35, at his home in Vienna of fever; on a mild and misty December 7, following a funeral service in St. Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral, he is buried in a common grave (as customary at this time) in St. Marx Cemetery in the presence of Salieri, Süssmayr, van Swieten (his patron) and two other musicians.

<doc id="355582" wikidata="Q690464" url="?curid=355582" title="Battle of Mikatagahara">
<text>The  took place during the Sengoku period of Japan between Takeda Shingen and Tokugawa Ieyasu in Mikatagahara, Tōtōmi Province on 25 January 1573. 
Shingen attacked Ieyasu at the plain of Mikatagahara north of Hamamatsu during his campaign against Oda Nobunaga while seeking a route from Kōfu to Kyoto. The Tokugawa-Oda force was almost totally annihilated by the Takeda after being encircled and many of Ieyasu&#x27;s retainers were killed in the battle. Ieyasu and his surviving men were forced to retreat before launching a minor counterattack to delay Shingen&#x27;s march towards Kyoto.

==Background==
In October 1572, after having concluded alliances with his rivals to the east (the Later Hōjō clan of Odawara and the Satomi clan of Awa), and after waiting for the snow to close off the northern mountain passes against his northern rival, Uesugi Kenshin, Takeda Shingen led an army of 30,000 men south from his capital of Kōfu into Tōtōmi Province, while Yamagata Masakage led a second force of 5,000 men into eastern Mikawa Province. They quickly captured Yoshida Castle and Futamata Castle.

Shingen was opposed by Tokugawa Ieyasu, based at Hamamatsu Castle with 8,000 men, plus an additional 3,000 reinforcements received from his ally, Oda Nobunaga. However, Takeda&#x27;s intent was not to attack Ieyasu nor to seize Hamamatsu; rather, he wished to avoid conflict if possible to save his forces to destroy Nobunaga and to march on Kyoto.

Against the advice provided by Sakuma Nobumori and Takigawa Kazumasu, who had been sent by Nobunaga, and by his own generals, Matsudaira Koretada (Fukōzu) and Ishikawa Kazumasa, Ieyasu refused to allow the Takeda to pass through his territory unhindered, and drew up his forces on a high plain called Mikatagahara, at the time located just north of Hamamatsu.

According to the &quot;Kōyō Gunkan&quot;, the contemporary Takeda military history, Shingen outnumbered Ieyasu three-to-one, and organized his men in the &quot;gyorin&quot; (魚鱗, fish-scale) formation, enticing his opponent to attack. Oyamada Nobushige was in Shingen&#x27;s vanguard, followed by Naitō Masatoyo and Yamagata Masakage. The third line was commanded by Katsuyori and Obata Masamori, while Baba Nobuharu was in the fourth. 
Opposing him, Ieyasu had gathered his available forces and arrayed them in a line.

==Takeda&#x27;s first attack==
At around four in the afternoon as snow began to fall, Tokugawa arquebusiers accompanied by a number of peasant stone-throwers opened fire upon the Takeda formation. Firearms, still somewhat new to Japanese warfare, were a known deterrent to cavalry assaults. Ieyasu had expected his superior weaponry to overcome Shingen&#x27;s overwhelming forces and formation, but this assumption was quickly dispelled as Naitō Masatoyo&#x27;s vanguard cavalry attacked and rapidly overran Honda Tadakatsu&#x27;s segment of the Tokugawa right.

Takeda horsemen exploited the opening and rapidly assaulted the accompanying Oda reinforcements before charging the Tokugawa rear. Oda forces were quickly overrun and routed, with officers Hirate Hirohide killed and Sakuma Nobumori and Takigawa Kazumasu fleeing the battle. A similar attack on the left was thwarted as Tokugawa units refused to yield ground and shrugged off the advance of the Takeda right, preventing an encirclement of the Tokugawa center. 

==Takeda&#x27;s second attack==
Shingen then withdrew his vanguard, offering them an opportunity to rest. He brought forward a new set of horsemen from the army&#x27;s main body, ordering Takeda Katsuyori, Obata Masamori, and Saegusa Moritomo to lead a two-pronged cavalry charge into the weakening Tokugawa line. They were closely followed by the footsoldier-heavy main body of the Takeda army, whose combined weight drove the already battered Tokugawa army into a disorderly retreat.

In an effort to reorganize his rapidly dissolving army, Ieyasu ordered his commander Ōkubo Tadayo to plant his golden fan standard (&quot;uma-jirushi&quot;) upon a hill and rally his troops towards the castle town of Saigadake. Ieyasu then sought to personally re-engage the Takeda army to free his trapped general Mizuno Tadashige, but was persuaded by his retainer Natsume Yoshinobu to retreat.

==Tokugawa&#x27;s retreat==
Convinced by his retainers that as head of the Tokugawa clan his life was too important, Ieyasu fled the field. To buy time for the Tokugawa retreat, Natsume Yoshinobu led the few soldiers remaining under his command in a suicide charge against the advancing Takeda, and was killed. Other notable Tokugawa retainers killed in the fighting were Matsudaira Koretada, Naruse Masayoshi, Toyama Kosaku, and Endo Ukon, who all perished as their units were encircled and overrun by the Takeda forces.
When Ieyasu returned to Hamamatsu Castle, he was accompanied by only five men. The town was on the verge of panic as rumor had already reached Hamamatsu that the battle had gone badly.

Nevertheless, Ieyasu commanded that the castle gates remain open and that braziers be lit to guide his retreating army back to safety. Sakai Tadatsugu beat a large war drum, seeking to persuade the returning men of their courageous retreat. When the Takeda vanguard led by Baba Nobuharu and Yamagata Masakage heard the drums and saw the braziers and open gates, they mistakenly assumed that Ieyasu had planned a trap and stopped to made camp for the night at their present position short of Hamamatsu.

==Tokugawa&#x27;s counter attack==
In the night, a small band of about one hundred Tokugawa foot soldiers and 16 matchlock gunners led by Ōkubo Tadayo and Amano Yasukage attacked the Takeda camp, throwing the vanguard of the Takeda army into confusion. Uncertain of the remaining strength of the Tokugawa forces, and worried that reinforcements from Oda Nobunaga or Uesugi Kenshin were on their way, Takeda Shingen decided to withdraw his forces back to his own territories. 

According to the Kansei Chōshū Shokafu, the famous Iga ninja Hattori Hanzō rendered meritorious service during the Battle of Mikatagahara. The genealogy of major samurai complied by the later Tokugawa shogunate records that Hanzo captured a Takeda spy named &quot;Chikuan&quot; and delayed the advancing Takeda at the Tenryū River with an asymmetrical counterattack of only thirty men.

==Aftermath==
The Battle of Mikatagahara was one of the most famous battles of Takeda Shingen&#x27;s campaigns and one of &quot;the most notable demonstrations of cavalry tactics&quot; of the Sengoku period. The battle was also Tokugawa Ieyasu&#x27;s most decisive defeat, featuring the effective annihilation of Ieyasu&#x27;s army and the daimyo himself only narrowly escaping death through a bluff and perilous night attack. According to the Japanese calendar, the battle was fought on the 22nd day of the 12th month of the 3rd year of Genki.

For Shingen, there would be no following attack on Hamamatsu as he would be fatally wounded in February 1573 at the Siege of Noda Castle and die in May 1573.

<doc id="355584" wikidata="Q768158" url="?curid=355584" title="Mikawa Province">
<text>was an old province in the area that today forms the eastern half of Aichi Prefecture. Its abbreviated form name was . Mikawa bordered on Owari, Mino, Shinano, and Tōtōmi Provinces.

Mikawa is classified as one of the provinces of the Tōkaidō. Under the &quot;Engishiki&quot; classification system, Mikawa was ranked as a &quot;superior country&quot; (上国) and a &quot;near country&quot; (近国) in terms of its distance from the capital.

==History==
Mikawa is mentioned in records of the Taika Reform dated 645, as well as various Nara period chronicles, including the Kujiki, although the area has been settled since at least the Japanese Paleolithic period, as evidenced by numerous remains found by archaeologists. Early records mention a &quot;Nishi-Mikawa no kuni&quot; and a &quot;Higashi-Mikawa no kuni&quot;, also known as . Although considered one administrative unit under the &quot;Engishiki&quot; classification system, this division (roughly based at the Yasaku River) persisted informally into the Edo period.

The exact location of the provincial capital is not known. Traditionally considered to have been located in the area of the modern city of Toyokawa because of the place name, archaeological investigations at the Hakuho-machi area of Toyota from 1991 to 1997 have revealed extensive ruins and ceramic shards indicating the possibility that the provincial capital was located there. Furthermore, the ruins of the &quot;Kokubun-ji&quot; of Mikawa Province was located in 1999 a short distance away from the Toyota site. On the other hand, the &quot;Ichinomiya&quot; of the province, Toga jinja is located in what is now part of Toyokawa, as well as a temple which claims to be a successor to the original provincial temple.

During the Heian period, the province was divided into numerous &quot;shōen&quot; controlled by local samurai clans. During the Kamakura period but it came under the control of Adachi Morinaga, followed by the Ashikaga clan. For much of the Muromachi period it was controlled by the Isshiki clan. However, by the Sengoku period, the province had fragmented into many small territories largely dominated by the Matsudaira clan, and contested by the Imagawa clan to the east and the Oda clan to the west. It was united under Tokugawa Ieyasu after the power of the Imagawa had been destroyed at the Battle of Okehazama. After the creation of the Tokugawa shogunate, parts of the province were assigned as feudal domains to trusted hereditary retainers as &quot;fudai daimyōs&quot;, with large portions retained as &quot;shihaisho&quot; territory administered by various &quot;hatamoto&quot; directly under the shogunate. During the Edo period, Mikawa was the only area permitted by the shogunate to produce gunpowder, which led to its modern fireworks industry.

The various domains and &quot;tenryō&quot; territories were transformed into short-lived prefectures in July 1871 by the abolition of the han system, and was organized into ten districts by the early Meiji period cadastral reform of 1869. The entire territory of former Mikawa Province became part of the new Aichi Prefecture in January 1872.

After World War II, the territory of former Mikawa Province prospers as the capital of the Japanese automobile industry.

Mikawa Province consisted of nine districts:

<doc id="355585" wikidata="Q11242477" url="?curid=355585" title="Siege of Miki">
<text>The lasted from 1578 to 1580. Toyotomi Hideyoshi took Miki Castle of Harima Province, located in what is now Miki, Hyōgo, Japan, from Bessho Nagaharu, an ally of the Mōri clan.

==Situation in Harima==
The original Shugo (governor) of the Harima province was the Akamatsu clan, with the &quot;Bessho clan&quot; and &quot;Kodera clan&quot; as Shugodai (deputy governor).

The Akamatsu clan were one of the most powerful shugo of the previous Shogunate having at one point being the shugo of 4 separate provinces. However, by this time they had already greatly decreased in power and only nominal leaders holding together make coalition of collapsing clans in Harima.

When Hashiba Hideyoshi entered the province on the order of Oda Nobunaga in late 1576, the Akamatsu clan leader Akamatsu Norifusa decided to simply surrender to the Oda, while he still had a decent deal on harima coalition, and soon after the Bessho clan and Kodera clan also submitted.

==Bessho rebellion==
Having apparently taken all of Harima without bloodshed, Hideyoshi proceeded to move his base of operations to Himeji, the former residential castle of the Akamatsu, and began preparing for a showdown with the Mōri clan.

However, during this time, Bessho Nagaharu&#x27;s uncle, Bessho Yoshichika, was reported to have felt insulted over having to submit to Hideyoshi, who was born a commoner. He managed to convince his nephew to rebel, and also set up a secret alliance with the Mori clan. Soon, after his rebellion, the Kodera clan joined in.

Once the first shot was fired, Hideyoshi was suddenly in a dangerous position, trapped between the powerful Mori clan in the front and rebelling clans behind him.

Later, Hideyoshi decided to lay siege to Miki castle, hoping to destroy the source of the rebellion.

==Siege==
In 1578, Hideyoshi&#x27;s force gradually took out the Bessho clan&#x27;s outlying castles and eventually surrounded them in Miki Castle.

However, the Bessho held out for an extraordinarily long time, at first due to a large stock of food, and then secret resupply missions by the Mori navy, though these ended long before the siege would. They attempted to break the siege on a few occasions. During one of these attacks on the much larger Oda forces, Bessho Harusada, the younger brother of Nagaharu, was killed. 
After nearly three years since the beginning of the rebellion, Miki castle finally surrendered. Bessho Nagaharu committed seppuku and his uncle Bessho Yoshichika, the instigator of this rebellion, was killed by his own soldiers.

In the meantime, during the siege, Araki Murashige suddenly left the battle front and returned to his home base at Arioka Castle (also known as Itami Castle). This was a rebellion against Oda Nobunaga. The reason for his rebellion may have owed to Nobunaga&#x27;s severe attitude toward his subordinates. Later, Nobunaga launch Siege of Itami (1579) against Murashige.

<doc id="355587" wikidata="Q1266314" url="?curid=355587" title="Individualist feminism">
<text>Individualist feminism, also known as ifeminism, is a libertarian feminist movement that emphasizes individualism, personal autonomy, freedom from state-sanctioned discrimination against women, and gender equality.

== Overview ==

Individualist feminists attempt to change legal systems to eliminate sex and gender privileges, and to ensure that individuals have equal rights. Individualist feminism encourages women to take full responsibility for their own lives and opposes any government interference into choices adults make with their own bodies.

Individualist or libertarian feminism is sometimes grouped as one of many branches of liberal feminism, but it tends to diverge significantly from mainstream liberal feminism of the 21st century. Individualist feminists Wendy McElroy and Christina Hoff Sommers define individualist feminism in opposition to what they call &quot;political&quot; or &quot;gender feminism&quot;.

== Beliefs ==
Libertarian feminists reject gender roles that limit women&#x27;s autonomy and choice, and assert that strict gender roles limit both women and men, especially if they are legally enforced. Libertarian feminists are critical of using institutional power to achieve positive aims, believing that allowing the government to make decisions on behalf of women may limit women&#x27;s individual choices. For instance, banning sex work to &quot;protect&quot; women treats women as a monolithic group, rather than individuals, and takes away economic opportunities for women who want to work in the sex industry by choice.

The Cato Institute, an American libertarian think tank, argues that capitalism has given women a higher standard of living, greater access to resources, greater individual freedoms and more job opportunities outside of physical labor.

Individualist feminism conforms to the theory of natural law, supporting laws that protect the rights of men and women equally. Individual feminists argue that government should not prioritize the needs of women over men, nor should it strive to intervene to create equality in personal relationships, private economic arrangements, entertainment and media representation, or the general sociocultural realm.

== History in the United States ==

According to individualist feminist Joan Kennedy Taylor, early organized feminism in the United States was fundamentally &quot;a classical liberal women&#x27;s movement&quot;. First-wave feminists focused on universal suffrage and the abolition of slavery, along with property rights for women and other forms of equal rights.

During the Victorian era and the early 20th century, individualist feminism fell out of vogue in the US and UK as the progressive, labor, and socialist movements began to hold more sway over politics.

Individualist feminism was revived by anti-authoritarian and individualist second-wave feminists in the mid-20th century. According to Taylor, &quot;the political issues that gained wide adherence were the reproductive rights to birth control and abortion, and the Equal Rights Amendment, which (at least in its initial support) was a classical liberal restraint on government.&quot;

Labels like individualist feminism, libertarian feminism, and classical liberal feminism were explicitly embraced by late 20th century writers and activists such as Taylor, Sharon Presley, Tonie Nathan, and Wendy McElroy. Modern libertarian feminism is a continuation of ideas and work developed by these women and their contemporaries, including Nadine Strossen and Camille Paglia, as well as of the ideas of classical liberal and anarchist writers throughout history.

== Libertarian feminist organizations ==

=== Association of Libertarian Feminists ===
The Association of Libertarian Feminists (ALF) was founded in 1973 by Tonie Nathan and Sharon Presley on Ayn Rand&#x27;s birthday in Eugene, Oregon, at Nathan&#x27;s home. In September 1975 in New York City, ALF became a national organization. , Presley was the executive director of the organization.

The ALF has stated that their purpose is to oppose sexist attitudes, oppose government, and &quot;provide a libertarian alternative to those aspects of the women&#x27;s movement that tend to discourage independence and individuality.&quot; The ALF have opposed the government&#x27;s involvement in childcare centers, including &quot;zoning laws, unnecessary and pointless &quot;health and safety&quot; restrictions, [and] required licensing.&quot; The ALF have also opposed public education, saying that public schools &quot;not only foster the worst of traditionalist sexist values but inculcate docility and obedience to authority with sterile, stifling methods and compulsory programs and regulations.&quot; In 1977, Nathan suggested eliminating parts of the United States Postal Service regulations that obstructed the mailing of birth control samples and information about family planning at the National Women&#x27;s Conference in Houston, Texas.

=== Feminists for Liberty ===
Feminists for Liberty (F4L) is a nonprofit libertarian feminist group founded in 2016. It was founded by Kat Murti and Elizabeth Nolan Brown to promote the values of libertarian feminism. F4L are &quot;anti-sexism and anti-statism, pro-markets and pro-choice&quot; and &quot;classically liberal, anti-carceral, and sex positive&quot;. They are opposed to collectivism and argue that &quot;treating someone as simply a representative of their sex or gender&quot; is collectivist.

=== Ladies of Liberty Alliance (LOLA) ===
The Ladies of Liberty Alliance (LOLA) was established in 2009 as a nonprofit organization. LOLA&#x27;s goal is to engage women in libertarianism through social groups, leadership trainings, and visits from guest speakers.

=== Mothers Institute ===
The Mothers Institute was a non-profit educational and networking organization supporting stay-at-home mothering, homeschooling, civics in the classroom, and an effective networking system for mothers and freedom of choice in health and happiness. It is now defunct.

== Criticism ==
Criticism of individualist feminism ranges from expressing disagreements with the values of individualism as a feminist to expressing the limitations within individualist feminism as an effective activism. Critics have argued that individualist feminism does not sufficiently address structural inequality. In 1995, American radical feminist Catharine MacKinnon criticized the value of individual choice, saying there were still instances where &quot;women are used, abused, bought, sold, and silenced&quot;, especially women of color. In 1999, American feminist Susan Brownmiller suggested that the aversion to collective, &quot;united&quot; feminism was a sign of a &quot;waning&quot; and unhealthy feminist movement.

<doc id="355589" wikidata="Q936036" url="?curid=355589" title="Mimasaka Province">
<text>was a province of Japan in the area that is northern Okayama Prefecture in the Chūgoku region of western Japan. Mimasaka bordered Bitchū, Bizen, Harima, Hōki, and Inaba Provinces. Its abbreviated form name was . In terms of the Gokishichidō system, Mimasaka was one of the provinces of the San&#x27;yō circuit. 

Under the &quot;Engishiki&quot; classification system, Mimasaka was ranked as one of the 35 &quot;superior countries&quot; (上国) in terms of importance, and one of the &quot;near countries&quot; (近国) in terms of distance from the capital. The provincial capital was located in what is now the city of Tsuyama.

==Geography==
Mimasaka was a landlocked province on the southern side of the Chugoku Mountains. The area is very mountainous, and is divided into three major river basins. In the east is the Asahi River which flows through the Maniwa Basin. In the center is the Yoshii River, which flows through the Tsuyama Basin. To the west is the Mimasaka area, which contains three smaller river basins. Due to this geography, the main transportation method in pre-modern times was by boat.

==History==
In 713, at the suggestion of &quot;Bizen-no-kami&quot; Nanten - and &quot;Bizen-no-suke&quot; Kamitsukeno-no-Kenji the Eita, Katsuta, Tomata, Kume, Mashima, and Oba districts of Bizen Province were separated into a new province, and, and Kamitsukeno-no-Kenji was appointed as the first governor of Mimasaka. This separation was the final stage of the disintegration of the former Kingdom of Kibi, and was intended to further weaken the Kibi clan by putting its iron resources directly under the control of the imperial government. 

In Mimasaka, there are many place names that are directly linked to people or places in Yamato. The ruins of the &quot;kokufu&quot; have been located within what is now the city of Tsuyama. The site is now located under the Tsuyama Sōja shrine. The Mimasaka Kokubun-ji and the ruins of the Mimasaka Kokubun-niji as located nearby, The &quot;ichinomiya&quot; of the province is the Nakayama Shrine, also located in Tsuyama.

During the Heian period, the area was part of the holdings of the Heike clan. In the Kamakura period, Kajiwara no Kagetoki followed by Wada Yoshimori served as &quot;shugo&quot; before the province came under the direct control of the Hōjō clan. In the Muromachi period, the Ashikaga clan took over the former Hōjō holdings. No central powerful local clan ever rose to prominence and the province changed hands frequently between warring factions in the Sengoku period.

Control shifted between the Yamana clan, the Akamatsu clan, the Amago clan, the Urakami clan, and the Ukita clan. After the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, it became united again with Bizen Province under Kobayakawa Hideaki. After his death without heir only two years later, the Tokugawa shogunate assigned most of the province to the Mori clan as Tsuyama Domain. The Mori moved the capital of the province from the Innoshō area, to their newly built &quot;jōkamachi&quot; at Tsuyama. 

In 1697, the Mori clan were replaced by a cadet branch of the Echizen-Matsudaira clan. The size of the domain was reduced to only 100,000 &quot;koku&quot;, and later to 50,000 &quot;koku&quot;. In 1767, another domain, Katsuyama Domain, with 23,000 &quot;koku&quot;, was created for the Miura clan. Mimasaka was the home of the samurai Miyamoto Musashi, the author of &quot;The Book of Five Rings&quot;.

In 1871, following the abolition of the han system, Mimasaka was divided into Tsuyama, Mashima, Kurashiki, Tsuruta, Koromo, Koga, Ikuno, Akashi, Numata, and Tatsuno prefectures, which were merged with Okayama Prefecture inI 1876.
Per the early Meiji period , an official government assessment of the nation&#x27;s resources, the province had 766 villages, with a total &quot;kokudaka&quot; of 263,477 &quot;koku&quot;.

<text>The western woolly flying squirrel (Eupetaurus cinereus) is a species of very large flying squirrel in the genus &quot;Eupetaurus&quot;. It is native to northern Pakistan and northwestern India. It was long considered the only species in the genus until the description of two other species in 2021. Until recently, scientific knowledge of this rare species was limited to 11 skins collected in the late nineteenth century. However, recent research has confirmed that it remains in Kashmir. It is among the longest members of the family Sciuridae, and one of the biggest gliding animals known. Observations confirm that despite its size, it does glide effectively, like other flying squirrels.

==Distribution and description==

&quot;E. cinereus&quot; has been recorded in northern Pakistan in the area around Gilgit. These areas include Chitral, Astor and Skardu. Since 1994, specimens have been captured in the Sai Valley, Gorabad, and Balti Gali, all in northern Pakistan. In 2004, the animal was videotaped by Dinets in Raikot Valley near Nanga Parbat, Pakistan. A 2012 study revealed the extension of distributional range of woolly flying squirrel in upper Neelum valley, Azad Jammu &amp; Kashmir. A live specimen captured in this area provided an uncontroversial evidence of its presence in Neelum valley. Sighting and other indirect evidences were also noted at seven different study sites of the area. Neelum valley is adjacent to Northern Areas of Pakistan. It has also been discovered in the Indian state of Uttarakhand and Jigme Dorji National Park in Bhutan, indicating that it may have a wider range than previously thought. The preferred habitat appears to be high elevation conifer forests associated with cliffs and caves. Other specimens have been purchased from a bazaar in Tibet, collected in Tibet, and collected in Yunnan, China, but these are now known to be distinct species from &quot;E. cinereus&quot;. 

Its habitat is mainly characterized by steep slopes, difficult to approach cliffs and mixed vegetation including &quot;Abies pindrow&quot;, &quot;Betula utilis&quot;, &quot;Juniperus macropoda&quot;, &quot;Pinus wallichiana&quot;, &quot;Taxus wallichiana&quot;, &quot;Skimmia laureola&quot;, &quot;Potentilla eriocarpa&quot;, &quot;Poa bactriana&quot;, &quot;Bergenia stracheyi&quot;, &quot;Artemisia vulgaris&quot;, and &quot;Bistorta affinis&quot;. Habitat degradation due to deforestation and livestock grazing may be the major factors adversely affecting the general habitat in the study area and this species might have negative consequences.

This species is one of the largest squirrels with a head-and-body length of , tail length of and a weight of . The only flying squirrels with similar dimensions are a few species in the genera &quot;Biswamoyopterus&quot; and &quot;Petaurista&quot;, and among other tree-living squirrels only the &quot;Ratufa&quot; giant squirrels. It has fur that is long and thick, with a grizzled pattern that gives the appearance of a woolly pelage, thus the name. This distinguishes it from the other two species in the genus &quot;Eupetaurus&quot;, which have a more saturated brown pelage.

==Relationships==
The western woolly flying squirrel is thought to have diverged from the other eastern and central species of &quot;Eupetaurus&quot; between 4.5 and 10.2 million years ago, with the Ganges and Yarlung Tsangpo rivers serving as barriers and allowing for divergence.

==Conservation status==
The western woolly flying squirrel was thought to be extinct for 70 years until being rediscovered in 1994 by Dr. Peter Zahler, of the Wildlife Conservation Society. The species is currently considered &quot;Endangered&quot; by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

<text>The was the Hōjō&#x27;s attack on the Takeda army, which took place at Mimase Pass in 1569, as the forces of Takeda Shingen withdrew after repeated failed sieges of the Hōjō clan&#x27;s Odawara Castle in Kanagawa Prefecture of Japan. 

The Hōjō forces, led by the brothers Ujiteru and Ujikuni, lay in wait for Takeda Shingen in the pass of Mimase. The Takeda vanguard, which included Baba Nobuharu, was hard-pressed. Shingen himself led the Takeda main body.

The battle turned in favor of the Takeda when Yamagata Masakage launched a furious counterattack, inflicting heavy casualties on the Hōjō and forced the Hōjō army to retreat north, allowing the Takeda return to Kai — leaving behind some 900 dead.

<doc id="355594" wikidata="Q217259" url="?curid=355594" title="Seminal vesicles">
<text>The seminal vesicles (also called vesicular glands or seminal glands) are a pair of convoluted tubular accessory glands that lie behind the urinary bladder of male mammals. They secrete fluid that largely composes the semen.

The vesicles are 5–10 cm in size, 3–5 cm in diameter, and are located between the bladder and the rectum. They have multiple outpouchings, which contain secretory glands, which join together with the vasa deferentia at the ejaculatory ducts. They receive blood from the vesiculodeferential artery, and drain into the vesiculodeferential veins. The glands are lined with column-shaped and cuboidal cells. The vesicles are present in many groups of mammals, but not marsupials, monotremes or carnivores.

Inflammation of the seminal vesicles is called seminal vesiculitis and most often is due to bacterial infection as a result of a sexually transmitted infection or following a surgical procedure. Seminal vesiculitis can cause pain in the lower abdomen, scrotum, penis or peritoneum, painful ejaculation, and blood in the semen. It is usually treated with antibiotics, although may require surgical drainage in complicated cases. Other conditions may affect the vesicles, including congenital abnormalities such as failure or incomplete formation, and, uncommonly, tumours.

The seminal vesicles have been described as early as the second century AD by Galen, although the vesicles only received their name much later, as they were initially described using the term from which the word prostate is derived.

==Structure==
The human seminal vesicles are a pair of glands in males that are positioned below the urinary bladder and at the end of the vasa deferentia, where they enter the prostate. Each vesicle is a coiled and folded tube, with occasional outpouchings termed diverticula in its wall. The lower part of the tube ends as a straight tube called the &quot;excretory duct&quot;, which joins with the vas deferens of that side of the body to form an ejaculatory duct. The ejaculatory ducts pass through the prostate gland before opening separately into the verumontanum of the prostatic urethra. The vesicles are between 5–10 cm in size, 3–5 cm in diameter, and have a volume of around 13 mL.

The vesicles receive blood supply from the vesiculodeferential artery, and also from the inferior vesical artery. The vesiculodeferential artery arises from the umbilical arteries, which branch directly from the internal iliac arteries. Blood is drained into the vesiculodeferential veins and the inferior vesical plexus, which drain into the internal iliac veins. Lymphatic drainage occurs along the venous routes, draining into the internal iliac nodes.

The vesicles lie behind the bladder at the end of the vasa deferentia. They lie in the space between the bladder and the rectum; the bladder and prostate lie in front, the tip of the ureter as it enters the bladder above, and Denonvilliers&#x27; fascia and the rectum behind.

===Development===

In the developing embryo, at the hind end lies a cloaca. This, over the fourth to the seventh week, divides into a urogenital sinus and the beginnings of the anal canal, with a wall forming between these two inpouchings called the urorectal septum. Two ducts form next to each other that connect to the urogenital sinus; the mesonephric duct and the paramesonephric duct, which go on to form the reproductive tracts of the male and female respectively.

In the male, under the influence of testosterone, the mesonephric ducts proliferate, forming the epididymis, ductus deferens and, via a small outpouching near the developing prostate, the seminal vesicles. Sertoli cells secrete anti-Müllerian hormone, which causes the paramesonephric ducts to regress.

The development and maintenance of the seminal vesicles, as well as their secretion and size/weight, are highly dependent on androgens. The seminal vesicles contain 5α-reductase, which metabolizes testosterone into its much more potent metabolite, dihydrotestosterone (DHT). The seminal vesicles have also been found to contain luteinizing hormone receptors, and hence may also be regulated by the ligand of this receptor, luteinizing hormone.

===Microanatomy===

The inner lining of the seminal vesicles (the epithelium) is made of a lining of interspersed column-shaped and cube-shaped cells. There are varying descriptions of the lining as being pseudostratified and consisting of column-shaped cells only. When viewed under a microscope, the cells are seen to have large bubbles in their interior. This is because their interior, called cytoplasm, contains lipid droplets involved in secretion during ejaculation. The tissue of the seminal vesicles is full of glands, spaced irregularly. As well as glands, the seminal vesicles contain smooth muscle and connective tissue. This fibrous and muscular tissue surrounds the glands, helping to expel their contents. The outer surface of the glands is covered in peritoneum.

==Function==
The seminal vesicles secrete a significant proportion of the fluid that ultimately becomes semen. Fluid is secreted from the ejaculatory ducts of the vesicles into the vas deferens, where it becomes part of semen. This then passes through the urethra, where it is ejaculated during a male sexual response.

About 70-85% of the seminal fluid in humans originates from the seminal vesicles. The fluid consists of nutrients including fructose and citric acid, prostaglandins, and fibrinogen. Fructose is not produced anywhere else in the body except in the seminal vesicles. It provides a forensic test in rape cases. 

Nutrients help support sperm until fertilisation occurs; prostaglandins may also assist by softening mucus of the cervix, and by causing reverse contractions of parts of the female reproductive tract such as the fallopian tubes, to ensure that sperm are less likely to be expelled.

==Clinical significance==

=== Disease ===
Diseases of the seminal vesicles as opposed to that of prostate gland are extremely rare and are infrequently reported in the medical literature.

Congenital anomalies associated with the seminal vesicles include failure to develop, either completely (agenesis) or partially (hypoplasia), and cysts. Failure of the vesicles to form is often associated with absent vas deferens, or an abnormal connection between the vas deferens and the ureter. The seminal vesicles may also be affected by cysts, amyloidosis, and stones. Stones or cysts that become infected, or obstruct the vas deferens or seminal vesicles, may require surgical intervention.

Seminal vesiculitis (also known as spermatocystitis) is an inflammation of the seminal vesicles, most often caused by bacterial infection. Symptoms can include vague back or lower abdominal pain; pain of the penis, scrotum or peritoneum; painful ejaculation; blood in the semen on ejaculation; irritative and obstructive voiding symptoms; and impotence. Infection may be due to sexually transmitted infections, as a complication of a procedure such as prostate biopsy. It is usually treated with antibiotics. If a person experiences ongoing discomfort, transurethral seminal vesiculoscopy may be considered. Intervention in the form of drainage through the skin or surgery may also be required if the infection becomes an abscess. The seminal vesicles may also be affected by tuberculosis, schistosomiasis and hydatid disease. These diseases are investigated, diagnosed and treated according to the underlying disease.

Benign tumours of the seminal vesicles are rare. When they do occur, they are usually papillary adenomata and cystadenomata. They do not cause elevation of tumour markers and are usually diagnosed based on examination of tissue that has been removed after surgery. Primary adenocarcinoma, although rare, constitutes the most common malignant tumour of the seminal vesicles; that said, malignant involvement of the vesicles is typically the result of local invasion from an extra-vesicular lesion. When adenocarcinoma occurs, it can cause blood in the urine, blood in the semen, painful urination, urinary retention, or even urinary obstruction. Adenocarcinomata are usually diagnosed after they are excised, based on tissue diagnosis. Some produce the tumour marker Ca-125, which can be used to monitor for reoccurence afterwards. Even rarer neoplasms include sarcoma, squamous cell carcinoma, yolk sac tumour, neuroendocrine carcinoma, paraganglioma, epithelial stromal tumours and lymphoma.

=== Investigations ===
Symptoms due to diseases of the seminal vesicles may be vague and not able to be specifically attributable to the vesicles themselves; additionally, some conditions such as tumours or cysts may not cause any symptoms at all. When diseases is suspected, such as due to pain on ejaculation, blood in the urine, infertility, due to urinary tract obstruction, further investigations may be conducted.

A digital rectal examination, which involves a finger inserted by a medical practitioner through the anus, may cause greater than usual tenderness of the prostate gland, or may reveal a large seminal vesicle. Palpation is dependent on the length of index finger as seminal vesicles are located above the prostate gland and retrovesical (behind the bladder).

A urine specimen may be collected, and is likely to demonstrate blood within the urine. Laboratory examination of seminal vesicle fluid requires a semen sample, e.g. for semen culture or semen analysis. Fructose levels provide a measure of seminal vesicle function and, if absent, agenesis or obstruction is suspected.

Imaging of the vesicles is provided by medical imaging; either by transrectal ultrasound, CT or MRI scans. An examination using cystoscopy, where a flexible tube is inserted in the urethra, may show disease of the vesicles because of changes in the normal appearance of the nearby bladder trigone, or prostatic urethra.

==Other animals==
The evolution of seminal vesicles may have been influenced by sexual selection. They occur in birds and reptiles and many groups of mammals, but are absent in marsupials, monotremes, and carnivorans. The function is similar in all mammals they are present in, which is to secrete a fluid as part of semen that is ejaculated during the sexual response. 
==History==
The action of the seminal vesicles has been described as early the second century AD by Galen, as &quot;glandular bodies&quot; that secrete substances alongside semen during reproduction. By the time of Herophilus the presence of the glands and associated ducts had been described. Around the time of the early 17th century the word used to describe the vesicles, parastatai, eventually and unambiguously was used to refer to the prostate gland, rather than the vesicles. The first time the prostate was portrayed in an individual drawing was by Reiner De Graaf in 1678.

The first described use of laparoscopic surgery on the vesicles was described in 1993; this is now the preferred approach because of decreased pain, complications, and a shorter hospital stay.

<text>Dhaulagiri, located in Nepal, is the seventh highest mountain in the world at above sea level, and the highest mountain within the borders of a single country. It was first climbed on 13 May 1960 by a Swiss-Austrian-Nepali expedition.
Annapurna I () is east of Dhaulagiri. The Kali Gandaki River flows between the two in the Kaligandaki Gorge, said to be the world&#x27;s deepest. The town of Pokhara is south of the Annapurnas, an important regional center and the gateway for climbers and trekkers visiting both ranges as well as a tourist destination in its own right.

== Toponymy ==
Dhaulagiri (धौलागिरी) is the Nepali name for the mountain which comes from Sanskrit where धवल (dhawala) means dazzling, white, beautiful and गिरि (giri) means mountain. Dhaulagiri I is also the highest point of the Gandaki river basin.

==Geography==
Looking north from the plains of India, most 8,000-metre peaks are obscured by nearer mountains, but in clear weather, Dhaulagiri is conspicuous from northern Bihar and as far south as Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh. In 1808, survey computations showed it to be the highest mountain yet surveyed. This lasted until 1838 when Kangchenjunga took its place, followed by Mount Everest in 1858.

Dhaulagiri I stands to the east of the range which bears its name. Its sudden rise from lower terrain is almost unequaled—it rises from the Kali Gandaki River 30 km to the southeast, while the South and West faces rise precipitously over . Such is its vertical relief that despite being closer to Cho Oyu and Mount Everest, it is the only one of the Nepali eight-thousanders whose prominence parent is K2, over away. The south face of Gurja Himal in the titular massif is also notably immense.

The rock layers found at the summit of Dhaulagiri, as well as Everest, is made up of limestone and dolomite formed at the bottom of the ocean. The summits of the other Himalayan eight-thousanders are made up of granite that were formed deep underground.

==Climbing history==
Dhaulagiri was the penultimate eight-thousander to be summitted, and the final in Nepal. As its other routes are disproportionately dangerous, most ascents have followed the Northeast Ridge route of the first ascent, but climbs have been made from most directions. As of 2024, the two aspects which have repelled all attempts along their full length are the Northwest Ridge (though it has been climbed to the summit via the so-called &quot;Pear&quot; buttress) and the South Face. The latter is often regarded as one of the greatest remaining challenges in alpinism.

As of 2007, there had been 358 successful ascents and 58 fatalities, which is a summit to a fatality rate of 16.2%. Between 1950 and 2006, 2.88% of 2,016 expedition members and staff going above base camp on Dhaulagiri I died. On all 8,000 metre peaks in Nepal the death rate was 1.63%, ranging from 0.65% on Cho Oyu to 4.04% on Annapurna I and 3.05% on Manaslu.

===Partial timeline===
* 1950 – Dhaulagiri I reconnoitered by a French expedition led by Maurice Herzog. They do not see a feasible route and switch to Annapurna, where they make the first ascent of an 8000 m peak.
* 1953–1958 – Five expeditions attempt the north face, or &quot;Pear Buttress&quot;, route.
* 1959 – Austrian expedition led by Fritz Moravec makes the first attempt on the northeast ridge.
* 1960 – Swiss-Austrian expedition led by Max Eiselin, successful ascent by Kurt Diemberger, Peter Diener, Ernst Forrer, Albin Schelbert, Nyima Dorje Sherpa, Nawang Dorje Sherpa on 13 May. First Himalayan climb supported by the first prototype fixed-wing aircraft, which, after establishing the still standing record for highest fixed wing landing, eventually crashed in &quot;Hidden Valley&quot; north of the mountain during takeoff and was abandoned.
* 1969 – American team led by Boyd Everett attempt southeast ridge; seven team members, including Everett, were killed in an avalanche.
* 1970 – The second ascent, via the northeast ridge by a Japanese expedition led by Tokufu Ohta and Shoji Imanari. Tetsuji Kawada and Lhakpa Tenzing Sherpa reach the summit.
* 1973 – American team led by James D. Morrissey makes the third ascent via the northeast ridge. Summit team: John Roskelley, Louis Reichardt, and Nawang Samden Sherpa.
* 1975 – Japanese team led by Takashi Amemiya attempts southwest ridge (also known as the south pillar). Six are killed in an avalanche, including Norio Suzuki.
* 1976 – Italian expedition makes the fourth ascent.
* 1977 – International team led by Reinhold Messner attempts the south face.
* 1978, spring: Amemiya returns with an expedition that puts five members on the summit via the southwest ridge—the first ascent not using the northeast ridge. One team member dies during the ascent.
* 1978, autumn – Seiko Tanaka of Japan leads successful climb of the very difficult southeast ridge. Four are killed during the ascent. French team attempts the southwest buttress (also called the &quot;south buttress&quot;), only reaches 7,200 m.
* 1980 – A four-man team consisting of Polish climbers Voytek Kurtyka, Ludwik Wiczyczynski, Frenchman René Ghilini, and Scotsman Alex MacIntyre climb the east face, topping out at 7,500 m on the northeast ridge. After a bivouac, they descend back to base camp in a storm. One week later they climb the mountain via the northeast ridge reaching the summit on 18 May.
* 1981 – Yugoslav team reaches 7,950 m after putting up the first route on the true south face of the mountain, on the right side, connecting with the southeast ridge. They climb in alpine style but suffer four days of open bivouacs and six days without food before returning. Hironobu Kamuro of Japan reaches the summit alone, via the normal route.
* 1982, 5 May – Three members – Philip Cornelissen, Rudi Van Snick, and Ang Rita Sherpa – of a Belgian-Nepali team reach the summit via the north-east ridge. A day later, four more climbers – Ang Jangbu Sherpa, Marnix Lefever, Lut Vivijs, and Jan Vanhees – summit also. Vivijs becomes the first woman to reach the summit.
*1982, 13 December – Two members (Akio Koizumi and Wangchu Shelpa) of the Japanese team led by Jun Arima of the Academic Alpine Club of Hokkaido University reach the summit. By the world calendar, winter begins 21 December, so this was not winter but a very-late-autumn-climb. However, the climb was done under a winter climbing permit, which the Nepali government issues for climbs beginning on or after 1 December.
* 1984 – Three members of the Czechoslovakian expedition (Jan Simon, Karel Jakes, Jaromir Stejskal) climb the west face to the summit. Simon died during the descent.
* 1985 – Polish expedition led by Adam Bilczewski set out to conquer Dhaulagiri for the first time in winter. After seven weeks of dramatic struggle against hurricane-force winds and temperatures below −40c°, Andrzej Czok and Jerzy Kukuczka achieve the first winter ascent on 21 January.
* 1986 – A mostly Polish expedition puts up a second south face route, on the left side of the face connecting with the southwest ridge route. They go above 7,500 m but do not reach the summit.
* 1988 – Soviet mountaineers Yuri Moiseev and Kazbek Valiev, in cooperation with Zoltan Demján of Czechoslovakia, succeed in climbing the southwest buttress. This 3,000-metre ascent, with difficult technical climbing at 6,800–7,300 m, was acknowledged as the year&#x27;s best achievement at the UIAA Expedition Commission Conference.
*1993 – Russian-British team puts up the direct north face route.
*1995 — Anatoli Boukreev, speed ascent, record time 17 hours 15 mins, base camp to summit.
* 1998 – French climber Chantal Mauduit and Sherpa Ang Tshering die when an avalanche strikes their tent on the Northeast Ridge. On 1 May the Greek climber Nikolaos Papandreou is killed falling in a gorge. On 2 October, the Greek Babis Tsoupras reaches the summit but does not return. The bodies of the Greek climbers were not found.
* 1999 – On 24 October, British climber Ginette Harrison dies in an avalanche on Dhaulagiri. Days later, Slovenian Tomaž Humar climbs the south face solo but does not reach the summit. His ascent ended at 7,300 m due to a 300 m band of rotten rock. Humar traverses to the dangerous southeast ridge, re-enters the face briefly, and exits at 8000 m for a descent on the northeast ridge.
* 2024 – On 6 October, five Russians, Alexander Dusheiko, Oleg Kruglov, Vladimir Chistikov, Mikhail Nosenko and Dmitry Shpilevoy, went missing while climbing Dhaulagiri. Their bodies were found on 8 October.

<doc id="355597" wikidata="Q964983" url="?curid=355597" title="Battle of Anegawa">
<text>The Sengoku period (30 July 1570) occurred near Lake Biwa in Ōmi Province, Japan, between the allied forces of Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu, against the combined forces of the Azai and Asakura clans. It is notable as the first battle that involved the alliance between Nobunaga and Ieyasu, and it saw Nobunaga&#x27;s prodigious use of firearms.

==Background==
The battle came as an Azai and Asakura reaction to Oda Nobunaga&#x27;s sieges of the castles of Odani and Yokoyama, which belonged to the Azai and Asakura clans. It was also referred to as the Battle of Nomura (野村合戦 &quot;Nomura Kassen&quot;) by the Oda and Azai clans and the Battle of Mitamura (三田村合戦 &quot;Mitamura Kassen&quot;) by the Asakura clan.

The Oda-Tokugawa allies marched on Odani castle, prompting Nagamasa to send for help from Echizen. Asakura Yoshikage sent an army to support him, and the combined Azai-Asakura force marched out to confront Nobunaga in the field. Nobunaga reacted by placing a screen around an Azai fort he had been reducing from Yokoyama castle and advancing to the southern bank of the Anegawa.

==Battle==
The following morning on July 30, 1570 the battle began with the Oda and Azai clashing on the right while Tokugawa and Asakura grappled to the left. The battle turned into a melee fought in the middle of the shallow Ane River. For a time, Nobunaga&#x27;s forces fought the Azai upstream, while the Tokugawa warriors fought the Asakura downstream.

Nobunaga assigned Hashiba Hideyoshi to lead troops into open battle for the first time, Sassa Narimasa led the rear guard, also with support from Hachisuka Masakatsu, Ikoma Ienaga, Kawajiri Hidetaka and Yamauchi Kazutoyo. 

The Tokugawa forces formed the left wing of the Oda and Tokugawa alliance forces facing the Asakura forces, with formation as following: 

* Ishikawa Kazumasa and Sakai Tadatsugu leading the vanguard units.
* Honda Tadakatsu and Sakakibara Yasumasa leading the rearguard units.

In this battle, Stephen Turnbull regarded Kazumasa, Tadatsugu, Yasumasa, and Tadakatsu, as Four Tokugawa Guardians. Ieyasu unleashed his second division under Tadakatsu and Yasumasa onto Asakura&#x27;s left flank, surrounding Asakura Kagetake. It was recorded that at the beginning of this battle, as the Tokugawa army was being steadily pushed back by the Asakura army, Tadakatsu suddenly rode his horse and charged alone against the approaching 10,000-strong Asakura army. Seeing this, the panicked Ieyasu immediately lead his forces to counter the advance of Asakura and to save Tadakatsu. In the end, they manage to defeat the Asakura army. Tadakatsu survived the battle despite the grave danger he faced.

There is also a report of single combat between Honda Tadakatsu against a giant Asakura warrior named Magara Naotaka, also known as Magara Jurozaemon. However, The duel was cut short when the Asakura army started to retreat. Naotaka and his eldest son Magara Jurosaburo (Naomoto) covered the retreat of the Asakura army to the northern bank. Both were eventually killed when confronted by four Mikawa samurai, Kosaka Shikibu, Kosaka Gorojiro, Kosaka Rokurogoro, and Yamada Muneroku, and a fifth samurai named Aoki Jozaemon. 

In another notable engagement, an Azai samurai named Endō Naotsune attempted to take Nobunaga&#x27;s head but was stopped short by Takenaka Kyusaku, younger brother of Takenaka Hanbei. Another Oda samurai, Sakai Masahisa, was under attack from Azai forces under Isono Kazumasa, when he lost his son Sakai Kyūzō. 

After the Tokugawa forces finished off the Asakura, they turned around and attacked the Azai&#x27;s right flank by sending Tadakatsu and Yasumasa&#x27;s units. The troops of Mino Triumvirate, who were under Inaba Ittetsu, were held in reserve, advancing to hit the Azai&#x27;s left flank. They left the task of besieging Yokoyama castle to aid in the battle. The Azai and Asakura&#x27;s forces were immediately defeated.

There is a battlefield memorial marker in Nomura-cho, Nagahama city, in Shiga Prefecture.

==Historical accounts==
No reliable source exists to reconstruct the battle. The Battle of Anegawa is vividly presented in the books compiled in the middle or the end of the Edo period. Many of the stories are pure fiction. The only valuable source is the &quot;Shinchōkō-ki&quot;, describing it very briefly without any notes concerning tactics or details of the battle. The exact number of the casualties in this battle is unknown. However, the &quot;Shinchōkō-ki&quot; mentions 1,100 samurai from the Asakura clan being killed in battle. Yamashina Tokitsugu, who blindly believed in Nobunaga&#x27;s propaganda, recorded clearly absurd numbers in his diary, stating &quot;Azai 9,600, Asakura 5,000.&quot;

The 1901 publication &quot;Japanese Military History: The Battle of Anegawa&quot; estimates that the casualties on the Azai and Asakura side were around 1,700, while those on the Oda and Tokugawa side were around 800. According to A.L. Sadler in &quot;The Life of Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu&quot; there were 3,170 heads collected by the Oda camp. A good portion were taken by Mikawa men, the Tokugawa force. The &quot;Mikawa Fudoki&quot; gives a very real picture of the battle: the retainers fighting in groups and the decapitation of soldiers in the confused mingling of armies among the clouds of smoke and dust. It is often noted that Nobunaga used 500 arquebusiers in this battle. He was famous for his tactical use of firearms but would find himself on the opposite end of skilled arquebus tactics in his Siege of Ishiyama Hongan-ji that year.

==Aftermath==
Later in October 1570, the Asai and Asakura forces led by Asakura Kagetake, launch a counterattack in the &quot;Battle of Shimosakamoto&quot;, and retaliated by defeating an Oda army at the &quot;Usayama castle&quot;, near Otsu, in Ōmi Province. Kagetake&#x27;s troops killed over 750 soldiers in the Oda army including Mori Yoshinari and Oda Nobuharu, one of Nobunaga&#x27;s younger brothers.

==In popular culture==
The battle has been featured in all games of the &quot;Samurai Warriors&quot; series. However, because Azai Nagamasa was made playable in &quot;Samurai Warriors 2&quot;, as opposed to the first game where he was a unique non-playable character, the battle had a larger significance. The battle has also fictionally appeared in revamped form in the &quot;Warriors Orochi&quot; series, in particular &quot;Warriors Orochi 3&quot; where its most famous revamp takes place. It also a playable battle in the video game Kessen III. The battle is also featured in the game &quot;Nioh 2&quot; as one of the pivotal events of the main story, which centers on the protagonist&#x27;s role in the conquests of Oda Nobunaga and the Oda clan. The Battle of Anegawa is also featured in Total War: Shogun 2 as a historical battle, in which the player controls Tokugawa Ieyasu.

<text>The Center for American Progress (CAP) is a public policy research and advocacy organization which presents a liberal viewpoint on economic and social issues. CAP is headquartered in Washington, D.C.

The president and chief executive officer of CAP is Patrick Gaspard, a former diplomat, organizer, and labor leader who served most recently as the president of the Open Society Foundations. Gaspard succeeded Neera Tanden, who was appointed special advisor to President Joe Biden in May 2021. Tanden previously worked for the Obama and Clinton administrations and for Hillary Clinton&#x27;s campaigns running for president. The first president and CEO was John Podesta, who has served as White House Chief of Staff to US President Bill Clinton and as the chairman of the 2016 presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton. Podesta remained with the organization as chairman of the board until he joined the Obama White House staff in December 2013.

The Center for American Progress has a youth-engagement organization, Generation Progress, and a sister advocacy organization, the Center for American Progress Action Fund (CAPAF).

==History and mission==

The Center for American Progress was created in 2003 as a Democratic alternative to conservative think tanks such as The Heritage Foundation and the American Enterprise Institute (AEI).

Citing Podesta&#x27;s influence in the Obama administration, Michael Scherer in a November 2008 article in &quot;Time&quot; stated that &quot;not since the Heritage Foundation helped guide Ronald Reagan&#x27;s transition in 1981 has a single outside group held so much sway&quot;. In 2011, the &quot;Washington Post&#x27;s&quot; Jason Horowitz described the Center for American Progress as &quot;Washington&#x27;s leading liberal think tank&quot;, and &quot;an incessant advocate for a broad progressive agenda and as such, a sharp thorn in President Obama&#x27;s left side.&quot; Sarah Rosen Wartell, a co-founder and former executive vice-president of the CAP, was later named president of the Urban Institute

In 2021, &quot;Politico&quot; described CAP as &quot;the most influential think tank of the Biden era.&quot;

==Activities==
===ThinkProgress===

&quot;ThinkProgress&quot;, active from 2005 to 2019, was an American progressive news website affiliated with the Center for American Progress but with editorial independence. In September 2019, &quot;ThinkProgress&quot; was shut down when CAP could not find a publisher willing to take it over. The news site was then &quot;folded into CAP&#x27;s online presence&quot; to &quot;focus on analysis from CAP scholars and CAP Action staff.&quot;

===Generation Progress===
Generation Progress was launched in February 2005 as &quot;the youth arm of the Center for American Progress&quot;. According to the organization, Generation Progress partners with over a million millennials.

===Center for American Progress Action Fund===
Formerly known simply as the American Progress Action Fund, the Center for American Progress Action Fund (CAP Action) is a &quot;sister advocacy organization&quot; and is organizationally and financially separate from CAP, although they share many staff and a physical address. &quot;Politico&quot; wrote in April 2011 that it &quot;openly runs political advocacy campaigns, and plays a central role in the Democratic Party&#x27;s infrastructure, and the new reporting staff down the hall isn&#x27;t exactly walled off from that message machine, nor does it necessarily keep its distance from liberal groups organizing advocacy campaigns targeting conservatives&quot;. Whereas CAP is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, CAP Action is a 501(c)(4), allowing it to devote more funds to lobbying. In 2003, George Soros promised to financially support the organization by donating up to $3 million. CAP Action is headed by Neera Tanden.

Launched in 2017, &quot;The Moscow Project&quot; is one of its initiatives.

=== Washington Center for Equitable Growth ===
The Washington Center for Equitable Growth, also known simply as &quot;Equitable Growth&quot;, is a grantmaking and research organization founded in 2013 and &quot;housed at the Center for American Progress&quot;. Equitable Growth funds academic research in economics and other social sciences, with a particular interest in government&#x27;s role in the distribution of economic growth and the role of public perceptions of fairness in shaping government policy.

=== &quot;Science Progress&quot; ===
&quot;Science Progress&quot; was an internet publication about progressive science and technology policy. &quot;Science Progress&quot; was a project of the Center for American Progress. Its mission was &quot;to improve the understanding of science among policymakers and other thought leaders and to develop exciting, progressive ideas about innovation in science and technology for the United States in the 21st Century.&quot; It began publication on 4 October 2007, the fiftieth anniversary of the launch of Sputnik 1. Content on the web site included news, in-depth essays, and text- and audio-based interviews. The &quot;Science Progress&quot; staff included Editor-In-Chief Jonathan D. Moreno.

=== Disability Justice Initiative ===
In July 2018, the Center for American Progress recruited former Obama staffer and National Council on Disability executive director Rebecca Cokley to lead its new project focused on disability rights advocacy. Senator Tammy Duckworth spoke at the first event announcing creation of the new project, which is housed within CAP&#x27;s Poverty to Prosperity Program. The Disability Justice Initiative became the first such project at a mainstream public policy advocacy organization not already focused on disability.

=== Project 2025 ===
The Center for American Progress has come out in opposition to the Heritage Foundation&#x27;s &quot;Project 2025,&quot; releasing detailed critiques of the proposed policies.

==Policies==

===Health care===

In 2017, CAP opposed Bernie Sanders&#x27; single-payer health plan. Critics said that this was because of funding from the health care industry, such as the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, the Health Care Service Corporation and America&#x27;s Health Insurance Plans, who would be eliminated under Sanders&#x27; plan. In 2018, the center proposed an alternative to single-payer that would offer patients and employers a choice between government coverage and private insurance.

In 2020, CAP president Neera Tanden came out in support of &quot;universal health care&quot;. The organization has also proposed &quot;Medicare Extra&quot;, which CAP says would add 35 million people to the insurance rolls while cutting U.S. health expenditures by over $300 billion annually.

==Criticism==
===Pro-UAE, pro-Saudi policy===
In October 2016, the &quot;Intercept&quot; reported that United Arab Emirates Ambassador to the US Yousef Al Otaiba praised &quot;a CAP report released [in October 2016] that advocates for continued cooperation with Gulf states like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.&quot;

In January 2019, two CAP staffers were fired after an investigation concerning the leaking of an internal email exchange involving discussions over the phrasing of CAP&#x27;s response to the murder of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi. CAP released a statement noting that while investigating the leaks, this was not the cause for the firings.

===Lack of transparency for funding sources===
Some open government groups, such as the Sunlight Foundation and the Campaign Legal Center, criticized the center&#x27;s failure to disclose its contributors, particularly because it was so influential to the Obama administration. CAP&#x27;s website states that corporate donors are not allowed to remain anonymous. Nathan Robinson, writing in 2018 for &quot;Current Affairs&quot; wrote that CAP &quot;continues to conceal the identities of many of its largest donors.&quot; He also criticized CAP for receiving &quot;shady donations&quot; and for a grant of $200,000 to the American Enterprise Institute in 2018.

CAP has received significant funding from the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, a pro-austerity think tank associated with billionaire investment banker Peter G. Peterson.

===Israel controversies===

====Allegations of antisemitic language====
CAP was criticized in 2012 by several Jewish organizations after its employees, Zaid Jilani and Ali Gharib, &quot;publicly used language that could be construed as anti-Israel or even anti-Semitic&quot;. Bloggers associated with CAP published several posts using phrases such as &quot;apartheid&quot; and &quot;Israel-firsters&quot;, which the American Jewish Committee described as &quot;hateful&quot; and called on CAP to disassociate themselves from these statements. The latter phrase, &quot;Israel-firsters&quot;, which was used in reference to US supporters of Israel, was also criticized by the Anti-Defamation League and described as antisemitic, including by Faiz Shakir, then the vice president of CAP. Officials at CAP said the &quot;inappropriate&quot; language came only in personal tweets—not on CAP&#x27;s website or its ThinkProgress blog. The Tweets were deleted, and the authors apologized.

====Allegations of suppression of criticism of Israel====
In 2015, however, other writers criticized CAP for what they saw as censorship of reasonable comments critical of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and other policies. Based on leaked emails, columnist Glenn Greenwald, for example, wrote that CAP had deleted references to Israeli settlement policies in reports by their staffers.

Greenwald and others also criticized CAP for hosting a meeting with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. At the same time, Netanyahu was hostile to the Obama Administration. Greenwald described CAP&#x27;s positions as &quot;servitude to AIPAC and pandering to Netanyahu.&quot; Eighteen organizations and over one hundred academics signed an open letter, circulated by Jewish Voice for Peace and the Arab American Institute, against the meeting. 26,300 people signed a petition opposing the meeting.

===WikiLeaks 2016 Hillary Clinton campaign controversy===
After the release of the Podesta emails, the Center for American Progress was criticized for emails sent between John Halpin, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, and Jennifer Palmieri, a Hillary Clinton campaign team member. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; characterized the comments as &quot;joking&quot;; Kellyanne Conway and others called them anti-Catholic attacks.

===Handling of sexual harassment accusations===
In April 2018, &quot;BuzzFeed News&quot; reported that female employees of CAP had complained of sexual harassment by CAP employee Benton Strong to human resources and management. Two anonymous employees alleged retaliation for reporting Strong&#x27;s behavior, one of them including her allegations in an exit memo when leaving CAP. However, CAP maintains that no retaliation occurred, and an internal investigation concluded the same. In response to the first complaint, Strong received a warning from CAP management. After the second complaint, he was suspended for three days without pay. He was already resigning to take up a position elsewhere, and these three days coincided with the final three days of his employment with CAP.

After the publication of the &quot;BuzzFeed&quot; story, CAP president Neera Tanden unintentionally used the first name of one of the anonymous women during an all-staff meeting to address their handling of the sexual harassment allegations.

===Michael Bloomberg===

In February 2020, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the center had removed reporting of New York City police surveillance of Muslim communities from a 2015 report, allegedly out of deference to Michael Bloomberg, who had given the center grants worth $1.5 million. Yasmine Taeb, an author of the report, said that they were instructed to remove the chapter or make dramatic revisions, alleging this was &quot;because of how it was going to be perceived by Mayor Bloomberg.&quot; CAP officials disputed her account, characterizing the changes as editorial decisions: detailed discussion of NYC policing was off-topic because the report had been &quot;commissioned to examine right-wing groups targeting Muslims with explicit bigotry and conspiracy theories.&quot; Bloomberg told &quot;The New York Times&quot; reporters he was unaware of any such dispute at CAP; in 2017, he contributed an additional $400,000.

==Funding==
The Center for American Progress is a 501(c)(3) organization under the US Internal Revenue Code. In 2014, CAP received $45 million from a variety of sources, including individuals, foundations, labor unions, and corporations. From 2003 to 2007, CAP received about $15 million in grants from 58 foundations. Major individual donors include George Soros, Peter Lewis, Steve Bing, and Herb and Marion Sandler. The center receives undisclosed sums from corporate donors. In December 2013, the organization released a list of its corporate donors, which include Walmart, CitiGroup, Wells Fargo, defense contractor Northrop Grumman, America&#x27;s Health Insurance Plans, and Eli Lilly and Company.

In 2015, CAP released a partial list of its donors, which included 28 anonymous donors accounting for at least $5 million in contributions. Named donors included the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Embassy of the United Arab Emirates, each giving between $500,000 and $999,999. CAP&#x27;s top donors include Walmart and Citigroup, each of which has given between $100,000 and $499,000. Other large CAP donors include Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Google, Time Warner, and Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America.

As of 2024, corporate donors to CAP included Google, Apple and NBC Universal.

<text>John David Podesta Jr. (born January 8, 1949) is an American political consultant who served as Senior Advisor to the President for International Climate Policy from 2024 to 2025, having previously served as the Senior Advisor to the President for Clean Energy Innovation and Implementation from 2022 to 2024. Podesta previously served as White House chief of staff to President Bill Clinton from 1998 to 2001 and counselor to President Barack Obama from 2014 to 2015. Before that, he served in the Clinton administration as White House staff secretary from 1993 to 1995 and White House deputy chief of staff for operations from 1997 to 1998.

Podesta is the former president and now chair and counselor of the Center for American Progress (CAP), a think tank in Washington, D.C., as well as a visiting professor of law at the Georgetown University Law Center and was chairman of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign. Additionally, he was a co-chairman of the Obama transition team. In his role as senior advisor to President Joe Biden, Podesta oversees the disbursement of $370–783 billion in clean energy tax credits and incentives authorized by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. On January 31, 2024, it was announced that Podesta would succeed John Kerry as top U.S. climate diplomat.

==Early life==
Podesta spent most of his early years in Chicago, where he was born, growing up in the neighborhood of Jefferson Park on the city&#x27;s Northwest Side. His mother, Mary (née Kokoris), was Greek-American, and his father, John David Podesta Sr., was Italian-American. Tony Podesta, a lobbyist, is his brother. Podesta&#x27;s father did not graduate from high school, but encouraged his children to attend college.

In 1967, Podesta graduated from Lane Tech High School in Chicago. Podesta met Bill Clinton in 1970 when they worked in Connecticut for Joseph Duffey, a candidate for the United States Senate. In 1971, he graduated from Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois, where he had served as a volunteer for the presidential candidacy of Eugene McCarthy. He received his J.D. from Georgetown University Law Center in 1976.

Podesta worked as a trial attorney for the Department of Justice&#x27;s Honors Program in the Land and Natural Resources Division (1976–77), and as a Special Assistant to the Director of ACTION, the Federal volunteer agency (1978–79). His political career began in 1972, when he worked for George McGovern&#x27;s unsuccessful presidential campaign.

==Career==
Podesta held positions on Capitol Hill, including Counselor to Democratic Leader Senator Thomas Daschle (1995–96); Chief Counsel for the Senate Agriculture Committee (1987–88); Chief Minority Counsel for the United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Patents, Copyrights, and Trademarks; Security and Terrorism; and Regulatory Reform; and Counsel on the Majority Staff of the Senate Judiciary Committee (1979–81). In 1988, he and his brother Tony co-founded Podesta Associates, Inc., a Washington, D.C., &quot;government relations and public affairs&quot; lobbying firm. Now known as the Podesta Group, the firm &quot;has close ties to the Democratic Party and the Obama administration [and] has been retained by some of the biggest corporations in the country, including Wal-Mart, BP and Lockheed Martin.&quot;

===Clinton administration===

Podesta served as both an assistant to the president and as deputy chief of staff. Earlier, from January 1993 to 1995, he was assistant to the president, staff secretary and a senior policy adviser on government information, privacy, telecommunications security and regulatory policy. Podesta was the first White House staffer to get the news of the Lewinsky scandal and was put in charge of managing the crisis. In 1998, he became President Clinton&#x27;s chief of staff in the second Clinton administration and served in the position until the end of Clinton&#x27;s time in office in January 2001. Podesta encouraged Executive Order 12958, which led to efforts to declassify millions of pages from the U.S. diplomatic and national security history.

===Post-Clinton administration===

In 2003, Podesta founded the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank in Washington, D.C., and served as its president and CEO until he stepped down in 2011. (CAP chief operating officer Neera Tanden succeeded Podesta as president and CEO, taking over day-to-day operations.) Podesta remained chairman of the nonexecutive board of directors for a time, and remains on the board as of August 2020, although not as chairman.

Podesta has taught at his alma mater, Georgetown University Law Center, many times over the years, teaching classes on congressional investigations, law and technology, legislation, copyright and public-interest law. On the Georgetown faculty, Podesta&#x27;s title is Distinguished Visitor from Practice. From 2002 to 2014, Podesta served as a member of the Constitution Project&#x27;s bipartisan Liberty and Security Committee. In 2008, he authored &quot;The Power of Progress: How America&#x27;s Progressives Can (Once Again) Save Our Economy, Our Climate, and Our Country&quot;. In 2009, he accompanied Bill Clinton to North Korea for negotiations securing the release of two American journalists imprisoned on espionage charges. He can be seen in numerous widely circulated photographs of Clinton meeting with Kim Jong-il.
Podesta opposes the excessive use of classification, and in a 2004 speech at Princeton University condemned what he called the U.S.&#x27;s &quot;excessive government secrecy&quot; and &quot;bloated secrecy bureaucracy&quot;. Podesta has called Executive Order 12958, &quot;which set tough standards for classifying documents and led to the unprecedented effort to declassify millions of pages from our nation&#x27;s diplomatic and national security history,&quot; as &quot;perhaps the biggest accomplishment of the Clinton administration.&quot; More than 800 million pages of intelligence documents were declassified as part of the program.

Podesta is described as &quot;a longtime advocate for government disclosure of UFO files&quot;. Podesta has supported petitions by some who believe UFOs are alien spacecraft to the government to release files related to the subject. At a 2002 news conference organized by Coalition for Freedom of Information Podesta stated that, &quot;It is time for the government to declassify records that are more than 25 years old and to provide scientists with data that will assist in determining the real nature of this phenomenon.&quot; Podesta wrote the foreword for a book by Leslie Kean titled &quot;UFOs- Generals, Pilots, and Government Officials Go On The Record&quot;. The book details numerous contact events by these trained personnel.
Podesta became an honorary patron of the University Philosophical Society in March 2006. Podesta is an emeritus member of the Knox College Board of Trustees. Podesta has served on the board of directors of Bedford, Massachusetts–based energy company Joule Unlimited since January 2011. He has also served on the board of the Portland, Oregon-based Equilibrium Capital. In 2013, Podesta earned $90,000 as a consultant to the West Chester, Pennsylvania-based HJW Foundation, a nonprofit group led by Swiss billionaire Hansjörg Wyss. He was the U.S. representative to the UN High-Level Panel on the Post-2015 Development Agenda.

After the 2016 election, Podesta joined &quot;The Washington Post&quot; as a columnist. Podesta also sits on the steering committee of the China–United States Exchange Foundation. On September 2, 2022, President Joe Biden appointed Podesta as senior advisor to the president for clean energy innovation and implementation, heading his own new dedicated White House office. For nearly two years in this role, Podesta oversaw the $370–783 billion climate investment authorized by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which was passed the previous month. He left to succeed John Kerry in the role of U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate in 2024.

==Personal email leak==

On October 7, 2016, WikiLeaks started to publish thousands of emails reportedly retrieved from Podesta&#x27;s private Gmail account, some of which contained controversial material regarding Clinton&#x27;s positions or campaign strategy. Podesta and the Clinton campaign did not confirm or deny the authenticity of the emails. Experts investigating the leak, including a private security firm called Secureworks, claimed that a Russian hacking group named Fancy Bear gained access to Podesta&#x27;s account through phishing. Podesta said that Russian intelligence officials attempting to influence the presidential election in favor of Donald Trump were behind the leak.

The United States Intelligence Community released a statement directly accusing Russian intelligence of involvement. Vice President Joe Biden told NBC News that the United States was &quot;sending a message&quot; to Russian President Vladimir Putin and that a wide-ranging &quot;clandestine&quot; cyber operation would take place in response to the Russians&#x27; activities. When asked about the leaks, Putin replied that claims of Russian involvement were false. &quot;The hysteria is merely caused by the fact that somebody needs to divert the attention of the American people from the essence of what was exposed by the hackers.&quot;

<text>was a Japanese daimyō of the Sengoku period. He was Tokugawa Ieyasu&#x27;s uncle through Matsudaira Hirotada&#x27;s marriage to his sister, Odai no Kata.

== Biography ==
He was a son of Mizuno Tadamasa, and brother of Mizuno Tadashige.

In 1542, Nobumoto sided with Oda Nobuhide, but later served to Tokugawa Ieyasu.

In 1543, he succeeded his father as lord of Kariya Castle.

In 1554, the Imagawa clan came to the west and built the Muraki Castle in the southeast of Owari, besieging Mizuno Nobumoto at his castle of Ogawa. Mizuno Nobumoto informed about the situation to Oda Nobunaga. Later, Nobunaga marched his army north and attacked the Imagawa forces in the Battle of Muraki Castle.

In 1576, under Ieyasu, he was assigned to defend Kariya Castle. However, in that same year, he betrayed Tokugawa Ieyasu and was killed. His brother, Mizuno Tadashige succeeded him and helped Tokugawa Ieyasu during the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600 before getting killed by Kaganoi Shigemochi, ending the family line.

<doc id="355607" wikidata="Q914637" url="?curid=355607" title="Mōri clan">
<text>The Mōri clan (毛利氏 &quot;Mōri-shi&quot;) was a Japanese samurai clan descended from Ōe no Hiromoto. Ōe no Hiromoto was descended from the Fujiwara clan. The family&#x27;s most illustrious member, Mōri Motonari, greatly expanded the clan&#x27;s power in Aki Province. During the Edo period his descendants became &quot;daimyō&quot; of the Chōshū Domain under the Tokugawa shogunate. After the Meiji Restoration with the abolition of the &quot;han&quot; system and &quot;daimyō&quot;, the Mōri clan became part of the new nobility.

==Origins==

The founder of the clan, Mōri Suemitsu, was the fourth son of Ōe no Hiromoto. He founded the clan when he took the name from his &quot;shōen&quot; named &quot;Mōri&quot; in Aikō District, Sagami Province. After the Jōkyū War, Suemitsu was appointed to the jitō office of a &quot;shōen&quot; in Aki Province. He was defeated by Hōjō Tokiyori in 1247 and committed suicide (&quot;seppuku&quot;) at Minamoto no Yoritomo&#x27;s shrine (&quot;hokkedō&quot;) along with his Miura clan allies. The lineage of the Mori clan is well verified because it matches up from several different sources such as the Mōri Family Tree (毛利系図), &quot;Sonpi Bunmyaku&quot; and Ōe Family Tree (大江氏系図).

According to the &quot;Sonpi Bunmyaku&quot; (尊卑分脈) from the late 14th century:
 Ōe no Hiromoto (大江広元, 1148–1225)
 Mōri Suemitsu (毛利季光, 1202–1247)
 Mōri Tsunemitsu (毛利経光, ? – ? )
 Mōri Tokichika (毛利時親, ? –1341)
 Mōri Sadachika (毛利貞親, ? –1351)
 Mōri Chikahira (毛利親衡, ? –1375), moved the family to Aki Province.
 Mōri Motoharu (毛利元春, 1323– ? )

==Kamakura period==
During the Kamakura shogunate the Mōri were a &quot;gokenin&quot; family due to the fame of their ancestor Ōe no Hiromoto. Mōri Suemitsu, the fourth son of Ōe no Hiromoto inherited Mōri-shōen from his father and that is why he began to use the name. It is reasonable to say he is the first head of the Mōri clan but in the Mōri family tradition he is the 39th head of the family as he is the 39th linear descendant of Amenohohi-no-mikoto (天穂日命), an ancient god of Japan. After the third head of the clan, Mōri Tokichika, his son Mōri Sadachika (毛利貞親) was supposed to succeed him but he and his son were both killed by the Hōjō clan and the great-grandson of Tsunemitsu became the next head of the clan.
At the end of the Kamakura shogunate, they became distant from the shogunate and showed a favorable attitude to Ashikaga Takauji.

==Sengoku period==

In the Sengoku period, Mōri Motonari expanded their power to the whole of Aki province and then to other neighboring provinces. In his generation, Mōri became the &quot;daimyō&quot; from a local &quot;jizamurai&quot;.

During the war with the Oda clan and the Ikkō-ikki, the Mōri helped the Ikkō-ikki clans by establishing a naval trade route between each other&#x27;s provincial docks and harbours, the Oda eventually nullified this by laying siege to the trade ships between the two clans and went to further disrupt trade by attempting to destroy the Mōri fleet, failing on their first attempt in 1571. The second battle took place in 1579 with the Oda sending eight Atakebune (heavily armoured ships with iron-clad plating) warships to finally destroy the Mōri naval threat.

After a struggle between Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who led his army as a general of Oda Nobunaga, the two sides made peace and Mōri remained as a daimyō who kept six provinces in Chūgoku.

==Edo period==
In 1600, Mōri Terumoto nominally led the Western Army in the Battle of Sekigahara. The Western Army lost the battle and the Mōri clan lost four eastern provinces and moved their capital from Hiroshima to present-day Hagi, Yamaguchi. The newer fief, Mōri han, consisted of two provinces: Nagato Province and Suō Province. Derived from the former, Mōri han was referred to often as Chōshū han.

==After the Meiji Restoration==
After the Meiji Restoration with the abolition of the &quot;han&quot; system and &quot;daimyō&quot;, the Mōri clan became part of the new nobility. They became a ducal family.

<text>San Juan de Ulúa, now known as Castle of San Juan de Ulúa, is a large complex of fortresses, prisons and one former palace on an island of the same name in the Gulf of Mexico overlooking the seaport of Veracruz, Mexico. Juan de Grijalva&#x27;s 1518 expedition named the island. On March 30, 1519, Hernan Cortés met with Tendile and Pitalpitoque, emissaries from Moctezuma II&#x27;s Aztec Empire.

It was built between 1535 and 1769. There is a local museum of the fortress, inaugurated in 1984.

==History==
The fort was built during the period of Spanish colonial rule, begun in 1535 by the Spanish authorities. The boundaries of the fort were repeatedly expanded during its existence. The fortress saw no action after the 1560s under Spanish control, becoming an isolated outpost of the Spanish Army in New Spain. In the 1580s, Battista Antonelli redesigned the fortress during a stopover en route to the Gulf of Fonseca.

It saw no action during the Mexican War of Independence, being too far away from the main areas of fighting to see any real action.

=== Privateer encounter ===

In 1568, the Spanish forces stationed on the fortress succeeded in trapping a privateer fleet under the command of John Hawkins in the fortress&#x27;s harbor. The commanders under Hawkins included his cousin, the young Francis Drake. Although Hawkins and Drake both managed to escape the organized entrapment on their respective warships, many of the trapped sailors aboard the ships were killed by Spanish cannon fire. Several of the privateer warships present were sunk, and several more were damaged beyond repair, and scuttled along the Mexican coastline. The shipwrecked sailors were abandoned by Hawkins, who chose to cut his losses and venture elsewhere on the Spanish Main. 

Trapped, and with no rescue in sight, these sailors ventured further inland, where they eventually settled among the local population and integrated into the Mexican populace at large, becoming part of the European diaspora in Mexico. Hawkins, along with Drake, continued his attacks on Spanish shipping of valuable cargo such as gold and silver from Spanish colonies in Latin America to Spain. The attack by the Spaniards at San Juan de Ulúa is credited as marking Drake&#x27;s first feelings of intense hatred of both Catholicism and the Spanish, which would both go on to have an influence on his later career.

==The Virgin of the Staircase on top of the Port of Veracruz==

The fort once held the icon of the La Virgen de La Escalera (Virgin of the Staircase), whose little chapel entrance was under the stone staircase leading to the Baluarte de San Crispin fort, near the chancery, ammunition room, and treasury room. Whenever ships arrived into the bay, this Marian icon was raised to the top tower to greet them, and they would fire cannons in her honor. The Virgen de La Escalera was known to these travelers and to the surrounding villages in Veracruz. The original icon has been missing for hundreds of years, its memory lost, ever since Mexico gained independence as this restricted entrance into the walled citadel and broke the Manila galleon trade linking Veracruz with Havana, Puerto Rico, Portobelo, Callao, San Blas, the shipyards of Barra de Navidad, Acapulco, the shipyards of Cavite, and eventually, Manila.

A near replica (some dispute as the true statue) of the Virgen de La Escalera was brought by the Antonio Fernandez de Roxas family (ancestors of the Zobel de Ayala clan also descended from the Zangroniz clan of railroad barons), via the Road of the Viceroys / El Camino de los Virreyes to Mexico City and then down to the Pacific port of Acapulco in Guerrero, and sailed to Manila centuries ago. In the mid-1800s, one of the Roxas descendants of Don Jose Bonifacio Roxas donated the icon from their family farm house in Calatagan where they owned a gigantic encomienda, the Hacienda Bigaa, to the nearby town of Nasugbu in the province of Batangas (they once owned parts of this town as well). The Virgen de Escalera is still venerated, loved, and fiestas are held in her honor, to this day, every year on the 2nd of December. Her feast day is known for the crowds of Filipinos that come to offer thanks and to pray the rosary, as well as watch a bull run called Fiesta De Los Toros, and another one, called Parada de Los Toros, highlighting cows and water buffalo and carromatas (a type of farm buggy or cart) festooned with flowers in a colorful parade, following the blessing of the farm animals.

==Post-Spanish era==
After Mexico&#x27;s independence in 1821, a large body of Spanish troops continued to occupy San Juan de Ulúa as late as 1825. It was the last site in the former Kingdom of New Spain to be held by the Spanish and was surrendered to Mexican General Miguel Barragán in November 1825. The justification for the order of expulsion issued by President Vicente Guerrero was their failed attempt to re-conquer Mexico. Since then, San Juan de Ulúa has served as a military and political symbol of Mexican resistance to foreign invasions and occupations, several of which took place during the 19th century. In 1838 the French bombarded the fortress in the Battle of Veracruz during the Pastry War, a conflict resulting from a French citizen in Mexico seeking reparations for his allegedly damaged pastry shop; during the Mexican–American War, a conflict which resulted from disputes over the nascent Republic of Texas, the United States laid siege to the fortress, and in 1863, the French briefly occupied the city while installing Maximilian I as Emperor of Mexico. For much of the 19th century, the fort served as a prison, especially for political prisoners judged to be opposition to the government. Many prominent Mexican politicians spent time here while they were not in power.

The last foreign incursion came in 1914, on the eve of World War I, when an American expedition captured and occupied Veracruz as a response to the Tampico Affair against the background of the Mexican Revolution; which threatened the regional oil industry in which Americans were heavily invested. After a short but bloody firefight the Americans captured the city, including San Juan de Ulúa. After seven months of U.S. occupation, the Americans departed and handed back the city to the Mexicans. The national legislature awarded the port and city of Veracruz the title of &quot;Heroic&quot; for the fourth time following this incident. A portion of San Juan de Ulúa also served several times as the presidential palace, housing presidents such as Benito Juárez and Venustiano Carranza. The citadel was also used as a prison, especially during the early 20th-century regime of President Porfirio Díaz. It was alleged by some sources that in order to prevent prisoners from escaping, sharks were placed into the waters surrounding the island, so that they would kill anyone attempting to escape.

==Modern times==
The fortress was ultimately closed (decommissioned) when it was no longer required for the defense of Mexico, being too impractical to serve as a modern naval base. After several years of decay, renovations were begun on the complex in the late 20th century. Some of the renovation projects are still under construction today. San Juan de Ulúa has been preserved in a somewhat deteriorated form and has been transformed into a museum open to the public. The prison, along with the remaining fortress complex are all open to the public, with the exception of the former presidential palace, which suffered severe decay and is still undergoing renovations as of 2020. The complex is a very popular tourist attraction among the Mexican public. The fortress has also been featured in Hollywood movies, with San Juan de Ulúa was used to depict the fortress in Cartagena, Colombia, in the climax of the 1984 film &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot;.

<text>was the ninth and last &quot;shōgun&quot; of the Kamakura shogunate of Japan.

He was a son of the eighth &quot;shōgun&quot; Prince Hisaaki and was a grandson of the Emperor Go-Fukakusa. He was also a puppet ruler controlled by Hōjō Takatoki, who was the Kamakura shogunate&#x27;s &quot;shikken&quot; or chief minister and &quot;tokusō of&quot; Hōjō clan (&quot;de facto&quot; ruler of Japan). His mother was daughter of Prince Koreyasu who died in 1306.

After the collapse of the Kamakura bakufu, he became a Buddhist priest. He died shortly afterwards.

The Kamakura shogunate was succeeded by the short-lived Kenmu Restoration.

<doc id="355612" wikidata="Q2288858" url="?curid=355612" title="Prince Moriyoshi">
<text>(1308 – August 12, 1335) was a Japanese prince and monk.

He was the son of Emperor Go-Daigo and his consort Minamoto no Chikako.

Moriyoshi was named by his father as the head abbot of the Enryaku-ji temple on Mount Hiei.

Go-Daigo attempted to seize power in 1331 during the Genkō War. Prince Moriyoshi joined forces with Kusunoki Masashige. Moriyoshi tenaciously defended Mount Yoshino. Masashige&#x27;s heroics defending Chihaya, together with Moriyoshi&#x27;s efforts to rally troops, brought a large number of warriors to the loyalist cause. By 1333, the rival warlords Ashikaga Takauji and Nitta Yoshisada had both joined the cause; Yoshisada would lay siege to Kamakura in the same year. When the city finally fell, Regent Hōjō Takatoki fled to Tōshō temple, where he and his entire family committed suicide. This marked the end of Hōjō power.

Restored to the throne, Go-Daigo started the Kenmu Restoration. After refusing to appoint Ashikaga Takauji to the post of &quot;sei-i taishōgun&quot;, Go-Daigo gave it to Prince Morinaga instead. Go-Daigo made the double mistake of giving the title to his sons Moriyoshi and Norinaga, two civilians, thus alienating Takauji and the warrior class, who felt he, as a military man and a descendant of the Minamoto clan, should have been &quot;shōgun&quot; instead.

Takauji seized Moriyoshi in Yoshino &quot;on imperial warrant&quot;, after rumors attributed to Go-Daigo&#x27;s consort Renshi, that he was preparing an attack. Moriyoshi was then sent to Takauji&#x27;s brother Ashikaga Tadayoshi in Kamakura. Tadayoshi had Moriyoshi beheaded in late August 1335.

Morinaga’s wife Princess Hinaturu and his vassal took back Morinaga&#x27;s head to Yamanashi.
Morinaga&#x27;s head was buried at the base of the katsura tree at Fujisan-Simomiya-Omuro-Sengen-Shrine.

A Shinto shrine, Kamakura-gū, was built around the cave where Prince Moriyoshi was imprisoned. It was dedicated to him by Emperor Meiji in 1869.

<text>Lorenzo Ruiz (; ; ; November 28, 1594 – September 29, 1637), also called Saint Lorenzo of Manila, was a Filipino Catholic layman and a member of the Third Order of Saint Dominic. A Chinese Filipino, he became his country&#x27;s protomartyr after his execution in Japan by the Tokugawa shogunate during its persecution of Japanese Christians in the 17th century. Lorenzo Ruiz is the patron saint of, among others, the Philippines and the Filipino people.

==Early life==

Lorenzo Ruiz was a Filipino born in Binondo, Manila, on 28 November 1594, to a Chinese father and a Tagalog mother who were both Catholic. His father taught him Chinese while his mother taught him Tagalog.

Lorenzo served as an altar boy at the Binondo Church. After being educated by the Dominican friars for a few years, Lorenzo earned the title of &quot;escribano&quot; (scrivener) because of his skillful penmanship. He became a member of the &quot;Cofradía del Santísimo Rosario&quot; (Confraternity of the Most Holy Rosary). He married Rosario, a native, and they had two sons and a daughter. The Ruiz family led a generally peaceful, religious and content life.

In 1636, while working as a clerk for the Binondo Church, Lorenzo was falsely accused of killing a Spaniard. Lorenzo sought asylum on board a ship with three Dominican priests: Antonio Gonzalez, Guillermo Courtet, and Miguel de Aozaraza; a Japanese priest, Vicente Shiwozuka de la Cruz; and a lay leper Lázaro of Kyoto. Lorenzo and his companions sailed for Okinawa on 10 June 1636, with the aid of the Dominican fathers.

==Martyrdom==
The Tokugawa Shogunate was persecuting Christians because they feared that the Spanish invaded the Philippines through using religion by the time Lorenzo had arrived in Japan. The missionaries were arrested and thrown into prison, and after two years, they were transferred to Nagasaki to face trial by torture. The group endured many and various cruel methods of torture.

On 27 September 1637, Lorenzo and his companions were taken to Nishizaka Hill, where they were tortured by being hung upside-down over a pit and bled. He died two days later on 29 September 1637, aged 42. This form of torture was known as &quot;tsurushi&quot; in Japanese or &quot;horca y hoya&quot; (&quot;gallows and pit&quot;) in Spanish. The method, alleged to have been extremely painful, had the victim bound; one hand was always left free so that the individual may signal their desire to recant, leading to their release. Despite his suffering, Lorenzo refused to renounce Christianity and died from eventual blood loss and suffocation. His last words were:

After his death his body was cremated. His ashes were then thrown into the sea of Nagasaki to prevent other Christians from gathering his sacred relics.

==Veneration==
===Beatification process===
The &quot;positio&quot; for the cause of beatification of Lorenzo Ruiz was written by Spanish historian Fidel Villarroel. The central document found to exhibit Ruiz&#x27;s martyrdom was an eyewitness account by two Japanese ex-priests from the Society of Jesus, rediscovered by Villaroel at the Jesuit Generalate archive in Rome, an unlikely location as Ruiz was of the Dominican order. Lorenzo was beatified during Pope John Paul II&#x27;s papal visit to the Philippines in 1981. It was the first ever beatification ceremony to be held outside the Vatican.
===Canonisation===
Lorenzo was canonised by Pope John Paul II on October 18, 1987, among the 16 Martyrs of Japan, making him the first Filipino saint. Ruiz&#x27; canonization was supported by a miracle in October 1983, when Cecilia Alegria Policarpio of Calinog, Iloilo, was cured of brain atrophy (hydrocephalus) at the age of two, after her family and supporters prayed to Lorenzo for his intercession. She was diagnosed with the condition shortly after birth and was treated at University of the East Ramon Magsaysay Memorial Medical Center.

A mosaic of San Lorenzo is found in the Trinity Dome of Mary&#x27;s National Shrine in Washington DC.

On September 28, 2017, the 30th anniversary of Lorenzo&#x27;s canonization was celebrated in the Archdiocese of Manila.

==Other tributes==
Lorenzo Ruiz is included in American painter John Nava&#x27;s &quot;Communion of Saints Tapestries&quot;, a depiction of 135 saints and blessed which hangs inside the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels in Los Angeles, California.

<text>Mōri Terumoto (毛利 輝元, January 22, 1553 – June 2, 1625) was a Japanese &quot;daimyō&quot;. The son of Mōri Takamoto, and grandson and successor of the great warlord Mōri Motonari, he fought against Oda Nobunaga but was eventually overcome. He participated in Toyotomi Hideyoshi&#x27;s Korean Campaign (1592) and built Hiroshima Castle, thus essentially founding Hiroshima.

== Biography ==

Mōri Terumoto was born &#x27;Kotsumaru&#x27; in 1553., as the eldest son of Mōri Takamoto at Aki Yoshida Koriyama Castle, the residence of the Mōri clan. His mother, Ozaki no Tsubone, was a daughter of Naito Okimori, a senior vassal of the Ouchi clan and Nagato Shugodai, and was also the adopted daughter of Ouchi Yoshitaka. From May 1554 until October 1555, the Mōri clan defeated Sue Harukata in the Battle of Itsukushima. After that, the Mōri clan annihilated the Ouchi and Sue clans. Therefore, his father, Takamoto, was constantly on the battlefield and never settled down with Terumoto.

When his father, Mōri Takamoto, suddenly died in 1563, Terumoto was selected as his heir. but his grandfather, Motonari, became his supervisor and the one who actually carried out political and military affairs of the Mōri clan.

In 1564 at what appears to have been an early manhood ceremony, Kotsumaru took the name Terumoto (Teru coming from the shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiteru) and assumed command. the character &quot;Teru&quot; was derived from the name of Ashikaga Yoshiteru, the 13th Shogun of the Muromachi Shogunate.

In 1566, the Mōri&#x27;s traditional rival, the Amago clan, had been destroyed, and Motonari had left instructions that the clan be content with what it had and forego expansionist adventure. To a greater or lesser extent, Terumoto followed his late grandfather&#x27;s instructions. Aside from skirmishes on Kyushu and gradual penetration further east. The first years of Terumoto&#x27;s rule passed quietly.

In 1569, on October, Ōuchi Teruhiro, a remnant of the former lord of the Ōuchi clan, invaded Suō Province with reinforcements from the Ōtomo clan. disrupting the control of the Mōri clan&#x27;s territory. In order to deal with the invasion of the remnants of the Ouchi clan led by Teruhiro, the Mōri clan withdrew their troops deployed in Kyushu and defeated Teruhiro and the remnants of the Ouchi clan that same month. However, this rebellion by Ouchi Teruhiro put Takahashi Akitane in Chikuzen province at a disadvantage, and he was forced to surrender the following year, despite the fact that he had promised in the joint pledge signed by Terumoto, Motonari, Motoharu, and Takakage that &quot;the Mōri clan would not abandon Akitane. The Mōri clan lost its influence in Chikuzen Province and also lost its bases in Buzen Province, leaving only a few castles such as Moji Castle, and the influence of the Mōri clan in Kitakyushu was greatly weakened 。

Later in 1570, Mōri Terumoto along with his generals &#x27;Kobayakawa Takakage&#x27; and Kikkawa Motoharu defeated Amago Katsuhisa at Battle of Fubeyama or Battle of Nunobeyama, and forced Amago Katsuhisa fled to the island of Oki. After Terumoto had put down the rebellion led by Ouchi Teruhiro, he set out with a large army from Yoshida Koriyama Castle together with Motoharu and Takakage to defeat the remnants of the Amago clan forces. 

When Motonari died in 1571, Terumoto inherited an enormous kingdom that stretched from Buzen on Kyushu to the borders of Harima and Bizen, a powerful navy (at the time Japan&#x27;s finest), and the support of two gifted uncles Kobayakawa Takakage and Kikkawa Motoharu.

=== Conflict with Nobunaga ===
Mōri Motonari left a testament saying, &quot;There is no need for further territorial expansion. We must not get entangled in central conflicts&quot;. However, conflict with Oda Nobunaga, who sought to expand his dominion, began, within three years after Motonari&#x27;s death.

In December 1573, Nobunaga acknowledged Uragami Munekage, a key figure in anti-Mōri forces, with control over Bizen, Mimasaka, and Harima. This decision provoked resistance from influential local figures such as Bessho and Kodera. When Munekage&#x27;s vassal, Ukita Naoie took advantage of this situation and initiated a rebellion, the Mōri supported him.

Furthermore, the Mōri clan intervened in the Ishiyama Hongan-ji War and gradually escalated their confrontation with Nobunaga.

Terumoto turned to the vaunted Môri navy. In 1576, First Battle of Kizugawaguchi Nobunaga&#x27;s &#x27;admiral&#x27;, Kuki Yoshitaka, had cut the Honganji&#x27;s sea-lanes and sat in blockade off the coast. Terumoto ordered his fleet, commanded by Murakami Takeyoshi, to make for the waters off Settsu and, once there, the navy inflicted an embarrassing defeat on Kuki and opened the Honganji&#x27;s supply lines.

In 1577, Hideyoshi captured Kozuki Castle in Harima and gave it to Amago Katsuhisa, who, supported by the famed Yamanaka Shikanosuke, hoped to restore the defunct Amago clan to power in Izumo. Perhaps goaded by the mere name of the new defender of Kozuki as much as anything else. In 1578, Terumoto sent his uncles to laid Siege of Kōzuki Castle. This they did, and both Katsuhisa and Shikanosuke were killed.

Later in 1578, Second Battle of Kizugawaguchi, Kûki Yoshitaka defeat Takeyoshi and drove the Mōri away. A further attempt by the Mōri to break the blockade the following year was turned back, and in 1580 the Honganji surrendered.

After Hongan-ji surrender, this allowed Nobunaga to concentrate on the Mōri and he sent two sizable contingents westward into the Chugoku region. Hashiba Hideyoshi was to march along the southern portion of the arm (the Sanyodo) while Akechi Mitsuhide moved into the upper provinces (the Sanindo).

By this time, Ukita Naoie had already defected to the Oda clan, and the Mōri clan found themselves in a difficult military situation.

By 1582 a Mōri defeat seemed inevitable. Hideyoshi had forced his way into Bitchu province and laid siege to Takamatsu Castle. Shimizu Muneharu (a former Mimura retainer) defended Takamatsu stoutly, but its loss would all but open the way into Bingo and Aki, the Mōri homeland. Hideyoshi knew that Takamatsu would be a tough nut to crack and that heavy losses would only benefit the Mōri, so he resorted to a stratagem. Diverting the waters of a nearby river, he flooded the castle grounds, making Takamatsu a soggy island. By now Terumoto had brought up a relief force, but hesitated to attack Hideyoshi directly. Shimizu, for his part, responded to an offer by Hideyoshi that would spare the lives of his men, and committed suicide after ordering his men to surrender.

=== Service Under Hideyoshi ===
After the death of Nobunaga at Honnoji Incident in 1582, and probably most relieved at Hideyoshi&#x27;s evident generosity, Terumoto agreed, to make peace and allowing Hideyoshi to speed home and defeat Akechi Mitsuhide before anyone else was the wiser for it. As frustrated as the Mōri may have been by their discovery of the truth, they did not break the truce, and in time became Hideyoshi&#x27;s closest supporters.

In 1583 he became a vassal of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. Terumoto sent the &#x27;Two Rivers&#x27; (Kobayakawa and Kikkawa) to lead troops for Hideyoshi in his Invasion of Shikoku (1585) and Kyushu Campaign (1587). He sent ships to assist Hideyoshi in his reduction of the Hojo at Siege of Odawara (1590).

When Hideyoshi invaded Korea in 1592, Terumoto himself led the &quot;7th Division&quot; with 30,000 troops there, although much of his time seems to have been taken up fighting Korean partisans at Gyeongsang Province.

In 1599, Terumoto made a Kishômon (blood oath ritual) with Ieyasu to pledge loyalty each others, the content of the oath that both Terumoto and Ieyasu &quot;would never betray each others and act as if they both are biological brothers&quot;.

Terumoto was a member of the council of Five Elders appointed by Hideyoshi. At the height of his power in late 16th century, Terumoto controlled 1.2 million &quot;koku&quot;. This means he could mobilize more than 40,000 men to a battle. He sided on Ishida Mitsunari, one of Hideyoshi&#x27;s Go-Bugyo, to fight against Tokugawa Ieyasu as the &quot;General Commander&quot;, but was not present at the Battle of Sekigahara, the leadership on the battlefield was led by Ishida Mitsunari. Terumoto was at Osaka Castle defending Toyotomi Hideyori at the time and later surrendered to Ieyasu soon after Mitsunari defeat at Sekigahara. Ieyasu reduced Terumoto&#x27;s domains, leaving him only Nagato and Suō Provinces, worth 369,000 koku in total.

=== After Sekigahara ===

In August 1614, tensions between the Edo Shogunate and the Toyotomi clan rose due to the issue of the inscription on the bell of the Great Buddha Hall of the Hokoji Temple. The Toyotomi clan called the Mōri clan join their side. However, Terumoto declined the invitation.

The Toyotomi clan also failed to convince the Mōri clan under the lead of Mōri Terumoto to join their side. Terumoto instead rather supporting the Tokugawa shogunate, as on November 3, Terumoto ordered his vassals Mōri Motochikazu and Motoyuki Sugimori, who were in charge of Mōri Hidemoto&#x27;s absence, to send half of the troops east if Hidemoto asked them to march out to aid the shogunate fought the Toyotomi, while the remaining half, including Sugimori, Motoyoshi Nishi, and Shichirobei Misawa, were to stay in Chofu as caretakers, and to retreat to Hagi if something happened that would make it impossible to maintain Chofu. On November 9, Kikkawa Hiroie, daimyo of Iwakuni, Suō Province, informed Terumoto&#x27;s aide Motoi Ihara of the situation in the Kamigata region and urged Terumoto to march out. The following day, on November 10, Terumoto entrusted the management of his home province to Masuda Motoyoshi and Yamada Motomune,[note 9] and marched out of Hagi on November 11, traveling eastward by sea from Mitajiri, Suo Province. Later, when Tokugawa Hidetada arrived at Fushimi on November 10, Sakai Tadayo, Doi Toshikatsu, and Ando Shigenobu, who were following Hidetada, requested Hidenari and Hidemoto in Edo to march out, and the Mōri clan joined the attack on Osaka Castle from both the home province and Edo.

During the Summer Siege of Osaka, some of the former vassals of the Mōri clan, such as Naito Motomori (Sano Michika), Karasuda Tsuji, Koda Masatane, and Kasai Shigemasa, joined the Toyotomi side. After the Siege of Osaka and the fall of the castle, Motomori was arrested in the outskirts of Kyoto in May. He was interrogated by Yagyū Munenori, an Ometsuke official in charge of the investigation, about the suspicion that Motomori had entered Osaka Castle on Terumoto&#x27;s orders, but Motomori claimed that he had entered the castle on his own initiative, and committed suicide on the 21st, which resulted in the suspicion against the Mōri clan being dropped. After that, Naito Motomori&#x27;s sons Naito Motochika and Awaya Mototoyo met with Ieyasu, and were allowed to return to Japan after explaining that they had no connection with Motomori. However, Terumoto forced the two to commit suicide and imprisoned Naito Motochika&#x27;s son Motonobu.

In 1616, on July 19, Terumoto married his only daughter, Takehime, to Kikkawa Hiromasa. Two days before, on July 17, two days before the wedding of Yoshikawa Hiromasa and Takehime, Terumoto sent a letter with the following contents to Yoshikawa Hiroie, and upon receiving the letter, Hiroie immediately replied to Ihara Motoi and Enomoto Motoyoshi that he accepted the gist of the letter: 

=== Death ===
Finally, his behavior caused resentment among some of his vassals, which led him to retire. He was succeeded by Mōri Hidenari. Terumoto died in June 2, 1625 (aged 72) at Yoshida, Aki Province.

==References in popular culture==
It is mentioned several times in the TV series &quot;Dynasty&quot; as being the favorite song of Blake (John Forsythe) and Alexis (Joan Collins). They dance to it in Season 7 Episode 28, &quot;Shadow Play&quot;, which originally aired on May 6, 1987.

A reference to the song is also made in the title of one episode of &quot;Bewitched&quot; (Season 8 Episode 5), &quot;Bewitched, Bothered and Baldoni&quot;.

The song appeared twice on &quot;The Crown&quot; (episodes &quot;Hyde Park Corner&quot; and &quot;Ritz&quot;, the latter played at the ending credits), it was sung in a duet by King George VI (Jared Harris) and Princess Margaret (Vanessa Kirby). 

The song was featured in both the 2004 play and the 2006 movie, &quot;The History Boys&quot;, as sung by Samuel Barnett’s character, Posner, a young, love-struck Jewish gay boy in reference to his unrequited crush on Dominic Cooper’s character, Dakin.

Walt Kelly created three recurring characters for his comic strip &quot;Pogo&quot;, named Bewitched, Bothered, and Bemildred, who were anthropomorphic bats wearing derby hats.

<doc id="355628" wikidata="Q1048622" url="?curid=355628" title="Murakami Yoshikiyo">
<text>Murakami Yoshikiyo (村上 義清, 1501–1573) was a Japanese samurai from the and retainer of the Uesugi clan during the Sengoku period of the 16th century. Yoshikiyo followed in fighting against both Takeda Nobutora and his son Takeda Shingen. Yoshikiyo was also a very close ally under Uesugi Kenshin and one of Shingen&#x27;s bitterest opponents for his high kill-counts in their conflicts.
Before Murakami came into conflict with Takeda, they had good diplomatic relations as Yoshikiyo had sent back Oi Sadataka, a common enemy of both Murakami and Takeda when he was captured in Murakami&#x27;s domain back to Takeda&#x27;s base city of Kōfu as a prisoner for execution.

In 1542, Murakami joined a coalition with Ogasawara Nagatoki, Suwa Yorishige, and Kiso Yoshiyasu to oppose Takeda Shingen&#x27;s growing forces. The two sides met at the Battle of Sezawa, with the coalition suffering a defeat in the battle.

In 1546, when Shingen and the Takeda forces arrived to attack Toishi Castle. Yoshikiyo came to the rescue commanding 6000 soldiers, crushing Shingen&#x27;s spearhead and claiming the life of some commanders such as Amari Bizen and Yokota Bitchū. He suffered defeat after some of Takeda&#x27;s more brilliant strategists, Yamamoto Kansuke, Sanada Yukitaka and his son Sanada Masayuki join the fray and each score their brilliant strategems to ensure Harunobu&#x27;s series of victories; however, in 1547 Yoshikiyo settled the score with Shingen, who had just enjoyed victory for seizing Shiga castle. Yoshikiyo caught him off guard and attacked him with entire force and routed him. One year later in 1548 he provided more severe defeats for Takeda by killing 3 of Shingen&#x27;s generals Itagaki Nobukata, Amari Torayasu, and Hajikano Den&#x27;emon in Battle of Uedahara in similar full-scale counterattack as before and causing Shingen to retreat into Kai after losing 700 men

In 1550 he held Toishi Castle for 1 year against Sanada Yukitaka and suffered a loss but not before inflicting a loss with the death one of Takeda&#x27;s general, Yokota Takatoshi. Then in 1553, Katsurao happened and Yoshikiyo lost Katsurao Castle.

In 1553 he was forced to abandon Shinano after losing to Takeda in Siege of Kannomine and forced to seek aid to Kenshin and serve as his retainer. Murakami was granted Nechi castle in Echigo for his service at the Battles of Kawanakajima as center division commander of the Uesugi army.

One source says at the fourth battle of Kawanakajima he had killed Takeda Nobushige, Shingen&#x27;s brother and one of his most important generals and strategists although another source was saying it was Kenshin himself who personally slew Nobushige

He was never able to restore his old territory and died in Echigo in 1573, and his son Murakami Kunikiyo (Yamaura Kagekuni) became retainer of Uesugi.

<text>Sir John Desmond Patrick Keegan (15 May 1934 – 2 August 2012) was an English military historian, lecturer, author and journalist. He wrote many published works on the nature of combat between prehistory and the 21st century, covering land, air, maritime, intelligence warfare and the psychology of battle.

==Life and career==
Keegan was born in Clapham to an Irish World War I veteran and was evacuated to Somerset when World War II broke out. At the age of 13, Keegan contracted orthopaedic tuberculosis, which subsequently affected his gait. The long-term effects of this rendered him unfit for military service, and the timing of his birth made him too young for service in the Second World War, facts he mentioned in his works as an ironic observation on his profession and interests. The illness also interrupted his education in his teenage years, although it included a period at King&#x27;s College, Taunton and two years at Wimbledon College, which led to entry to Balliol College, Oxford in 1953, where he read history with an emphasis on war theory. After graduation he worked at the American Embassy in London for three years.

In 1960 Keegan took up a lectureship in military history at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, which trains officers for the British Army. He remained there for 26 years, becoming a senior lecturer in military history during his tenure, during which he also held a visiting professorship at Princeton University and was Delmas Distinguished Professor of History at Vassar College.

Leaving the academy in 1986, Keegan joined &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; as a defence correspondent and stayed with the paper as defence editor until his death. He also wrote for the conservative American publication &quot;National Review Online&quot;. In 1998, he wrote and presented the BBC&#x27;s Reith Lectures, entitling them &quot;War in Our World&quot;.

Keegan died on 2 August 2012 of natural causes at his home in Kilmington, Wiltshire. He was survived by his wife, their two daughters and two sons.

==Published work==
In &quot;A History of Warfare&quot;, Keegan outlined the development and limitations of warfare from prehistory to the modern era. It looked at various topics, including the use of horses, logistics, and &quot;fire&quot;. A key concept put forward was that war is inherently cultural. In the introduction, he vigorously denounced the notion that war is a reasonable tool of statecraft, &quot;simply a continuation of [interstate] politics by other means&quot;, rejecting &quot;Clausewitzian&quot; ideas. However, Keegan&#x27;s discussion of Clausewitz was criticised as uninformed and inaccurate by writers like Peter Paret, Christopher Bassford, and Richard M. Swain.

Other books written by Keegan are: &quot;The Iraq War&quot;, &quot;Intelligence in War&quot;, &quot;The First World War&quot;, &quot;The Second World War&quot;, &quot;The Battle for History&quot;, &quot;The Face of Battle&quot;, &quot;War and Our World&quot;, &quot;The Mask of Command&quot;, and &quot;Fields of Battle&quot;. 

He also contributed to work on historiography in modern conflict. With Richard Holmes he wrote the BBC documentary &quot;&quot;. Frank C. Mahncke wrote that Keegan is seen as &quot;among the most prominent and widely read military historians of the late twentieth century&quot;. In a book-cover blurb extracted from a more complex article, Sir Michael Howard wrote, &quot;at once the most readable and the most original of living historians&quot;.

==Views on contemporary conflicts==
* Keegan stated: &quot;I will never oppose the Vietnam War. Americans were right to do it. I think they fought it in the wrong way. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a war like fighting Hitler, but I think it was a right war, a correct war.&quot;
* Keegan believed that the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999 showed that air power alone could win wars.
* An article in &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; called Keegan a &quot;staunch supporter&quot; of the Iraq War. It quotes him: &quot;Uncomfortable as the &#x27;spectacle of raw military force&#x27; is, he concludes that the Iraq war represents &#x27;a better guide to what needs to be done to secure the safety of our world than any amount of law-making or treaty-writing can offer.

==Criticism==
Keegan was also criticised by peers, including Sir Michael Howard and Christopher Bassford for his critical position on Carl von Clausewitz, a Prussian officer and author of &quot;Vom Kriege&quot; (&quot;On War&quot;), one of the basic texts on warfare and military strategy. Describing Keegan as &quot;profoundly mistaken&quot;, Bassford stated, &quot;Nothing anywhere in Keegan&#x27;s work – despite his many diatribes about Clausewitz and &#x27;the Clausewitzians&#x27; – reflects any reading whatsoever of Clausewitz&#x27;s own writings.&quot; The political scientist Richard Betts criticised Keegan&#x27;s understanding of the political dimensions of war, calling Keegan &quot;a naïf about politics.&quot;

In his 1997 book &quot;Revolutionary Armies in the Modern Era: A Revisionist Approach&quot; (described as &quot;too flawed to be recommended as an undergraduate text&quot;), historian S.P. MacKenzie reports Keegan as saying that the best panzer units of the Waffen SS altered the course of the war and were &quot;faithful unto death and fiercer in combat than any soldiers who fought them on western battlefields&quot;.

Detlef Siebert, a television documentarian, disagreed with Keegan&#x27;s view that the deliberate targeting of civilian populations by aerial bombing &#x27;descended to the enemy&#x27;s level&#x27;, although he did call it a &#x27;moral blemish&#x27;.

==Honours==
On 29 June 1991, as a war correspondent for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Keegan was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) &quot;in recognition of service within the operations in the Gulf&quot;. In the 2000 New Year Honours, he was knighted &quot;for services to Military History&quot;.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature (FRSL) in 1986. In 1993 he won the Duff Cooper Prize.

In 1996, he was awarded the Samuel Eliot Morison Prize for lifetime achievement by the Society for Military History.

The University of Bath awarded him an Honorary Doctor of Letters (DLitt) in 2002.

<doc id="355635" wikidata="Q310126" url="?curid=355635" title="Tomiichi Murayama">
<text>is a Japanese politician who served as prime minister of Japan from 1994 to 1996. He was the country&#x27;s first socialist premier since Tetsu Katayama in 1948, and is best remembered for the Murayama Statement on the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II, in which he officially apologized for Japan&#x27;s past colonial wars and aggression. 

Born in Ōita Prefecture, Murayama graduated from Meiji University in 1946, and became a labor union official in his home prefecture. He was elected to the Ōita City Council in 1955 as a member of the Japan Socialist Party; he was then elected to the Ōita Prefectural Assembly in 1963 and to the National Diet in 1972. After the JSP joined the government following the 1993 election, he became its leader, then became prime minister in 1994 as the head of a new coalition of the JSP, Liberal Democratic Party, and New Party Sakigake. Murayama reversed his party&#x27;s long-standing opposition to the U.S.–Japan Security Treaty, and his government was criticized for its responses to the Great Hanshin earthquake and Tokyo subway sarin attack in 1995. He resigned as prime minister in 1996, and reorganized the JSP as the Social Democratic Party. The new party lost many of its seats in the 1996 election, and he resigned as its leader soon after. 

Murayama is currently the oldest living Japanese prime minister following the death of Yasuhiro Nakasone in 2019.

==Early life and education==

Murayama was born in Ōita Prefecture on 3 March 1924; his father was a fisherman. He was the sixth son of eleven children. His father died when he was fourteen, forcing him to deliver newspapers and work small jobs to help make a living. After graduating from Oita Municipal High School in 1938, he moved to Tokyo, and began working at a printing factory during the day, and studied at the Tokyo Municipal School of Commerce at night.

He entered Meiji University in 1943 as a philosophy student, but was mobilised in 1944 and assigned to work in the Ishikawajima shipyards. Later that year, he was drafted into the Imperial Army and assigned to the 72nd Infantry of the 23rd Brigade of the 23rd Division as a private second class. He was demobilised following Japan&#x27;s surrender with the rank of officer candidate, and finished the war as a cadet with the rank of sergeant. He graduated from Meiji University in 1946, and in 1948, he became the general secretary of the Oita Prefecture Fishing Village Youth League. After the Fishing Village Youth Alliance was disbanded after achieving successes such as establishing a fisheries cooperative, he subsequently worked as the secretary of the Oita Prefectural Employees&#x27; Labor Union.

==Representative and JSP politician==

=== Early career ===
In 1951, he ran for election as a member of the Oita City Council, but was defeated as runner-up. In 1953, he married his wife, Yoshie Murayama. In 1955, he ran for the Oita City Council again, and was elected as a member of the Japan Socialist Party, being elected twice after. After serving for eight years, he ran for the Prefectural Assembly of Oita in 1963, and was elected, there serving for nine years. He then ran in the 1972 Japanese general election for the former Oita&#x27;s 1st, being placed at the top of the list and winning. He was then elected nine more times in the district. In 1973, he joined the &quot;New Flow Association&quot; with Takahiro Yokomichi and Hideo Den.

=== Chairman of Diet Affairs Committee ===
When Makoto Tanabe replaced Takako Doi as Chairman of the JSP, Murayama became chairman of the National Diet Committee. At the so-called &quot;Peacekeeping session&quot; in 1992, where it was debated if the Japan Self-Defense Forces should participate in United Nations peacekeeping work, Murayama took the role of the primary opposition leader to the bill. Nevertheless, it passed with the support of the LDP and other liberal parties. As he was involved with other parties due to his role as Chair of Diet Affairs, he had connections with several other party higher ups, including Seiroku Kajiyama of the LDP and Takeho Kanzaki of Komeito. In January 1993, Sadao Yamahana replaced Makoto Tanabe as chairman of the Socialist Party, but Murayama remained as chairman of the National Diet Committee.

In July, later that year, the 1993 election saw the LDP lose over 50 seats, and the JSP under Sadao Yamahana took a similar tumble, losing seats to new opposition parties such as the Japan Renewal Party or the Japan New Party, both under LDP defectors Tsutomu Hata and Morihiro Hosokawa respectively. In August, the Hosokawa Cabinet - the first non-LDP cabinet since the party&#x27;s formation - was established. The JSP, despite being the biggest party, was not given the Prime Minister spot. Instead, Sadao Yamahana was named Minister in Charge of Political Reform. Yamahana resigned from JSP leadership to take responsibility for the poor showing in the 1993 election. Murayama was elected as leader without much in the way of opposition, appointing Wataru Kubo as General-Secretary. The Hosokawa cabinet survived for a year - it managed to pass the 1994 Japanese electoral reform, before Hosokawa resigned following revelations of a campaign finance scandal.

Following Hosokawa&#x27;s resignation, bickering began over who would succeed him, with every party from the Hosokawa Cabinet eventually picking Tsutomu Hata. The Hata Cabinet was soon after sworn in with a confidence vote; however, just a few days after, the combined forces of the Japan Renewal Party, Kōmeitō, Democratic Socialist Party, Liberal Reform Federation, Japan New Party would form a unified parliamentary group, the &quot;Kaishin&quot;, with the goal of undercutting JSP influence in the Hata Cabinet. The group would go on to form the New Frontier Party soon after. Murayama felt betrayed by the announcement - he announced the JSP would withdrawal from the coalition, leaving it with minority status. An internal battle waged in the JSP, with other leaders, such as Wataru Kubo, believing they should return to the Hata Cabinet.

On 25 June, the Hata Cabinet resigned en masse, believing they would not survive a confidence vote. Yōhei Kōno soon after entered talks with Murayama on the possibility of a grand coalition; they came to an agreement where Murayama would inherit the Prime Ministership from Hata soon after. However, several LDP heavyweights disagreed with the idea, including Yasuhiro Nakasone and Toshiki Kaifu, who stated that &quot;We cannot support the chairman of the Socialist Party as the leader.&quot; A challenged to Murayama then emerged from Kaifu, who was nominated by rebel LDP members for Prime Minister. With no majority in the Japanese House of Representatives, a run-off was held between Kaifu and Murayama, which Murayama then won, making him the first Socialist Prime Minister since the LDP had formed in 1955.

== Administration of the Murayama Cabinet ==

The Murayama Cabinet was a coalition government, sometimes described as a grand coalition, which played a significant part in ending the often explosive LDP-JSP conflict which had dominated every election prior, even with third parties beginning to form in the seventies and eighties.

Tsuneo Watanabe praised Murayama in 2000, stating that &quot;His greatest achievement was that he was a progressive cabinet in the best sense of the word, crushing the Socialist Party&#x27;s anti-security, anti -American, opposition to the national anthem and flag, and greatly expanding the scope of unification of national opinion.&quot;

=== Policy platform ===
The LDP, New Party Sakigake, and the JSP had come to a basic policy agreement prior to the establishment of the cabinet, which served as the basis for it and the First Hashimoto Cabinet which succeeded it. These included:
* Respect for the Constitution of Japan
* Implementation of parallel voting, and the 1994 Japanese electoral reform
* Administrative reform as a prerequisite for tax reform
* Approve the direction of raising the consumption tax with some conditions
* Maintaining the Japan Self-Defense Forces and Japan-U.S Security Treaty
* Actively participate in United Nations peacekeeping operations
* Carefully handle the issue of Japan and Permanent UNSC membership

In his policy speech after taking office as Prime Minister, he stated his wish for &quot;people-friendly politics&quot; and &quot;peace of mind politics&quot; as his administrative policies.

=== Murayama Statement ===

At a ceremony commemorating the 50th end of the Pacific War, Murayama announced the &quot;Occasion of the 50th Anniversary of the War&#x27;s End&quot;, an official apology for the &quot;invasion&quot; and &quot;colonial domination&quot; of Asia that Japan undertook before and during the Pacific War and Second Sino-Japanese War. The Prime Minister issued a statement entitled &quot;On the Commemoration of the End of World War II&quot; after a unified Cabinet meeting. All successive cabinets since Murayama have clearly stated that they will follow the statement. The aptly name &quot;Murayama Statement&quot; has become established, and it is treated as the official position of the Japanese government.

==== Development of the Statement ====
It had been agreed upon by all three parties that with the war&#x27;s end approaching its 50th anniversary, some sort of statement would have to be issued. Shortly After taking office as prime minister, Murayama toured ASEAN countries and said, &quot;Although Asian countries outwardly look nice towards Japan, in reality, countries that have become economic powers may become military powers again. I felt that they hadn&#x27;t cleaned up after themselves, and that I hope they don&#x27;t make the same mistake again.&quot; Later, on 9 June 1995, a plenary session of the House of Representatives agreed to pass the Fusen Ketsugi statement. The struggle of finding a perfect middle ground was difficult, but the results were still promising; while a significant number of members of all parties abstained either out of a wish for a stronger or weaker statement, only 50 members of the LDP had abstained, wishing for a weaker statement. Somewhat frustrated by being unable to find the votes necessary to pass it unanimously, Murayama turned towards drawing up a separate statement.

Several scholars, led by Chief Cabinet Secretary Kozo Igarashi drafted the statement by incorporating things that Murayama had said in past speeches. After Murayama completed the text of the statement, he showed it to Ryutaro Hashimoto and the Chairman of the Japan War-Bereaved Families Association. They had initial conflict over the &quot;end of the war&quot; and &quot;defeat&quot; in the text, but came to the agreement that defeat was the basis of the unification that came after of the people.

On 15 August 1995, the 50th anniversary of the end of the war, Murayama declared, &quot;Now that the chairman of the Socialist Party has become prime minister, it is meaningless if he cannot issue a statement of this level.&quot; If there are any objections, Murayama swore to resign as prime minister. Koken Nosaka, who was appointed as the new Chief Cabinet Secretary in the cabinet reshuffle, was prepared to immediately dismiss any cabinet member who objected to the statement. At the cabinet meeting, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Teijirō Furukawa read out the statement, and Nosaka asked, &quot;Do you have any objections?&quot; All the cabinet members (including Murayama&#x27;s reshuffle) signed the statement without raising a single objection, and it was unanimously approved by the Cabinet, the Murayama Statement being released soon after.

==== Reactions to the Murayama Statement ====
At the time of his statement, Murayama said he was just &quot;stating the obvious thing&quot;. He did not expect that his successor, Ryutaro Hashimoto, would fully respect the statement. All cabinets since have clearly stated their intention to respect the statement.

The Murayama Statement is considered to be the official historical understanding taken by the Japanese government. Junichiro Koizumi also issued the Koizumi Statement on the 60th anniversary of the war&#x27;s end in 2005, which followed the Murayama Statement.

Conservative politicians and others have made comments which often differ from the Statement with denial for crimes committed by Japan, and for this, they are usually criticized heavily by the governments of China and South Korea. Most undertake the purview that &quot;Japan has officially apologized and compensated the countries concerned for the acts of aggression it allegedly committed during the war, there is no need for further apologies.&quot; Others have also stated that the Murayama Statement was pointless, with the fact that Japan committed the acts being something that can not be helped.

In November 2008, Chief of the Air Staff Toshio Tamogami published a paper titled &quot;Was Japan an aggressive nation?&quot;. He was heavily criticized by incumbent Prime Minister Tarō Asō for straying from the view established by the Murayama Statement, and was fired, with Tamogami going on to become a significant figure for the far-right in Japan, as displayed by his run in the 2014 Tokyo gubernatorial election.

Before taking office as prime minister, Shinzo Abe had made statements critical of the Murayama Statement, and attention was being drawn both domestically and internationally to see what kind of statement Shinzo Abe will issue in 2015 on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the end of the war. But on 5 January of the same year, At the New Year&#x27;s press conference, he stated, &quot;The Abe Cabinet has inherited the positions of previous cabinets, including the Murayama Statement. On that basis, I would like to announce a new, future-oriented statement&quot;, making it clear that the Abe Cabinet would at-least somewhat respect the Murayama Statement.

=== Establishment of Asian Women&#x27;s Fund ===
In August 1994, a plan was announced to provide condolence money through private funds to women and families who were forced by Japanese soldiers in World War 2 to work as comfort women. In July 1995, the Asian Women&#x27;s Fund was established under the jurisdiction of the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Murayama encouraged this. In January 1997, the fund began distributing yen to former Korean comfort women.

Before the establishment of the Murayama Cabinet, lawsuits were filed by former comfort women in various locations demanding state-funded damage compensation and an apology from the Japanese government for its actions. However, the Japanese government took the position that these issues had been resolved when treaties were concluded with other countries, and it was considered impossible to compensate former comfort women through the use of state funds. Under the concept presented by Murayama, the government would establish a fund and the funds would be donated by the private sector, thereby avoiding direct investment of national funds and conveying the sincere feelings of the people who responded to the donations. The aim was to solve the problem, not through the government, but through private organizations. Regarding the background to its establishment, Murayama himself said, &quot;There are those who say, &#x27;There should be government compensation&#x27;, while others say, &#x27;All wartime reparations have been legally resolved. There is no need to revisit them now.&#x27; There is a wide gap in opinion both domestically and internationally, with some saying, &#x27;I paid my dues properly.&#x27; we found common ground and managed to launch the fund. As the former comfort women continue to age, we have managed to convey the feelings of apology from the Japanese people while they were still alive, and those who went through heartbreaking experiences. Despite various criticisms, this was the only option available under the pressing circumstances of the time.&quot;

Fumibei Hara became the first president of the organization, and Murayama, after retiring as Prime Minister, became the second acting president. He has been developing projects related to the honor and dignity of women in general. Murayama, the chairman of the board, announced that the group will disband in March 2007, when it is scheduled to develop support projects in the Philippines, the Republic of Korea, and the Republic of China, and conclude its Indonesia operations.

On 1 September 2000, during the Second Mori Cabinet, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hidenao Nakagawa held a press conference regarding the National Fund for Asian Peace for Women and reiterated the Japanese government&#x27;s recognition of the fund. On 6 March 2007, Murayama held a press conference and stated that a resolution calling for Japan&#x27;s apology over the comfort women issue was being considered in the U.S. House of Representatives, saying, &quot;[Through the Women&#x27;s National Fund for Asia Peace] It is extremely unfortunate that people do not understand that the Prime Minister sent a letter of apology to the comfort women.&quot;

=== Disasters and controversies ===
==== Great Hanshin Earthquake ====

On 17 January 1995, the Great Hanshin Earthquake occurred, with the Japanese government being heavily criticized for its delayed response to the Hyōgo Prefecture.

==== Crisis response ====
When asked about the reason for the delay in dispatching the Japan Self-Defense Forces to the sight of the earthquake, Murayama, who had been relatively popular as a Prime Minister, received strong criticism from the Japanese opposition and his cabinet approval ratings took a downturn. Eventually, as the full extent of the delayed response became clear, the inadequacies of the Japanese government&#x27;s crisis management system at the time, including the legal system, were exposed.

The earthquake occurred at around 5:46 a.m., but there was no crisis management employee at the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office at the time. Furthermore, the , which had jurisdiction over disaster countermeasures, did not have a person on duty. The low loyalty of the Cabinet Secretariat and bureaucrats to the coalition cabinet was pointed out as a problem. After the earthquake, , instructed by Masaharu Gotōda, gave a lecture on crisis management to the cabinet. Sasa wrote that Murayama was the only one of the cabinet members who paid attention the entire time, and Sasa reprimanded the cabinet for its distracted behavior. Sasa also wrote about an anecdote where Murayama attempted to hold a press conference immediately after the earthquake, but was halted by Cabinet Secretariat bureaucrats.

Murayama himself said &quot;I think the initial response could have been done more quickly if we had the current crisis management system in place. I cannot bear the shame that so many people died. Every year on the morning of the 7th, I hold a silent prayer at my home.&quot; He also said that &quot;There was no crisis management response function at all. There is no excuse for the delay in launching the initial response. Yes, I am truly sorry.&quot; He stated further that there was no argument or excuse for the failure in response.

At the time, , who held a role in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office as the longest serving Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary in Japanese history, said &quot;In this unprecedented and unprecedented disaster, and with an underdeveloped legal system, who else but Murayama could become the Prime Minister? Even so, it was impossible to respond quickly.&quot; On the other hand, he also said that &quot;If you look far enough, the cause (of the lack of a system in which the Cabinet could take immediate action) was the Socialist Party. The Socialist Party continued to oppose strengthening the Cabinet&#x27;s authority.&quot; Ironically, when a Prime Minister finally originated from the Socialist Party, a situation occurred where they had to manage the crisis. This was a very difficult situation. It&#x27;s a story.&quot;

==== Legal system issues ====
Due to the legal system, the Japan Self-Defense Forces could not be dispatched without a local request from the Governor of Hyōgo Prefecture, Toshitami Kaihara. At 8:10 AM that day, the Ministry of Defense and Ground Self-Defense Force Himeji Garrison contacted the Hyogo Prefectural Office to request dispatch. Before 10 A.M, JSDF helicopters were sent out to collect information from the disaster area. However, Kaihara only joined the Defense Agency after that, and more time was wasted trying to understand the current situation. Finally, without waiting for Kaihara&#x27;s orders, the Hyogo Prefectural Counselor (in charge of disaster prevention) issued a dispatch request at 10:10 AM, and the Self-Defense Forces were dispatched four minutes later at 10:14 AM.

In 2007, Governor of Tokyo Shintaro Ishihara claimed that &quot;During the [Hanshin] earthquake, an additional 2,000 people died because leaders were slow in making decisions (about JSDF deployment).&quot; In response, Kaihara said &quot;Mr. Ishihara misunderstood. There is certainly some remorse in terms of crisis management, but the death toll did not increase because the request was delayed. More than 80% of victims were crushed to death near immediately.&quot; He argued there was no immediate relation between wait in dispatch and increase in the number of victims. Additionally, Tomio Saito, who took office as the Hyogo Prefectural Disaster Prevention Supervisor after the earthquake, claims that Ishihara&#x27;s comments are &quot;totally baseless statements and are truly regrettable.&quot;

==== Internal conflict in the JSP ====
The coalition formed by Murayama was intensely controversial. A movement began inside the party urging supporters of the Hata Cabinet, including former Chairman Sadao Yamahana. At a meeting on 16 January, Banri Kaieda and others from the splinter Democratic New Party Club joined the promoters to form a new party. He was scheduled to submit a notification of withdrawal from the group on 17 January. It was thought that the event would be canceled due to the earthquake that occurred that early morning, but Yamahana and others submitted a notice of withdrawal from the group in the morning of the same day. The following day, 18 January, the formation of a new party was postponed, and Yamaka left the Socialist Party on 10 May.

==== Tokyo subway sarin attack ====

On 20 March 1995, the Tokyo subway sarin attack occurred, the deadliest terrorist attack in Japan as defined by modern standards. Murayama directed an investigation through relevant ministers, including Minister of Justice Isao Maeda, Chair of the National Public Safety Commission Hiromu Nonaka, Commissioner of the National Police Agency Koji Kunimatsu, and Cabinet Secretary Kozo Igarashi. Murayama himself took the lead in the investigation.

Aum Shinrikyo, which had been responsible for a series of incidents including the Tokyo subway sarin attack, was considered to be subject to the Subversive Activities Prevention Act, and the Public Security Intelligence Agency filed a request for disciplinary action against the doomsday cult. The Public Safety Review Committee judged that the requirements for applying the Subversive Activities Prevention Act were not met, and the application was postponed.

The Subversive Activities Prevention Act, promulgated in 1952, stipulates regulatory measures against organizations that engage in violent subversive activities. Initially, the purpose of the act was to prevent far-left forces such as the Japanese Communist Party and Japanese Red Army from continuing to attempt to overthrow the liberal democratic norm through proletarian revolution. The Socialist Party and other opposition parties instead emerged as the biggest opposition under the 1955 System, so the government took a cautious stance in applying the law. The application of the Subversive Activities Prevention Law to Aum Shinrikyo was controversial, with opposition from Masaharu Gotōda, a former police bureaucrat, and other influential law enforcement figures. Murayama met with Minister of Justice Hiroshi Miyazawa and Hiromu Nanaka again, who both decided decided to respect the investigation by the Public Security Intelligence Agency, paving the way for a request for punishment to the Public Safety Review Commission. Regarding the investigation into the subway sarin gas attack, his comments encouraging arrests via separate cases received mixed reviews, including a strong backlash from human rights lawyers.

On 12 March 2007, he contributed a memo to &quot;My Story of the Subway Sarin Incident&quot;, which was compiled by the &quot;Subway Sarin Incident Victims Association&quot;. Haruki Murakami, who wrote a book about the attack named Underground, also contributed to the book.

==== All Nippon Airways Flight hijacking ====
On 21 June 1995, the All Nippon Airways Flight 857 from Haneda to Hakodate was hijacked. The culprit demanded that the government release Aum Shinrikyo cult leader Shoko Asahara, who had been arrested and detained the month before.

Murayama consulted with Chair of the National Public Safety Commission Hiromu Nonaka and Minister of Transport Shizuka Kamei, and decided that he would not engage in any negotiations with the hijacker. He then decided to call the Special Armed Police of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department&#x27;s 6th Riot Police Department, instructing they take the plane by force. Murayama said after the order that 
If there are any casualties, I am prepared to go to the bereaved family in white clothes to apologize.&quot; Nonaka responded that &quot;In that case, I will accompany you.&quot;

However, based on information gathered about the situation of the place, the culprit was not an actual Aum Shinrikyo follower. The Riot Police, deployed by the TMPD, did not participate in the invasion of the plane; instead, it provided logistical support to Hokkaido Riot Police. The culprit was arrested; one person had minor injuries.

The substance believed to be sarin was just water, and the hijacker was an employee of Toyo Trust and Banking (currently Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking) who was on leave due to mental illness that had nothing to do with Aum Shinrikyo. At the time, the National Police Agency kept the very existence of the Special Armed Police secret, and its existence was not revealed even after it was put into action. In 1996, National Police Agency established additional units in Hokkaido, Chiba, Kanagawa, Aichi, and Fukuoka, and together with the SAP in Tokyo and Osaka, established the Special Assault Team, officially announcing the existence of the unit.

=== Diplomacy ===
Although the transition from the Hata Cabinet to the Murayama Cabinet was a change of government, the foreign policy was essentially inherited that of the previous Japanese government, maintaining administrative continuity.

==== United States ====
When the Murayama Cabinet was formed, then-President of the United States Bill Clinton was wary of a Prime Minister from the Socialist Party. However, at a meeting before the 20th G7 summit in 1994, Murayama spoke in ambiguous terms about his upbringing in a poor fishing village and the process that led him to aspire to become a politician. When Clinton heard this, he was deeply moved, and even at subsequent summits, he supported Murayama even though Murayama was near entirely unfamiliar with state visits beforehand. Murayama had only traveled overseas four times before, and although he was nervous about participating, he was able to get through the event without major incident.

==== Maintaining the Japan-US Security Treaty ====
On 20 July 1994, in his policy speech at the 130th session of the Diet, he declared that the Self-Defense Forces were constitutional and that the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty would be maintained, changing the policies of the Japan Socialist Party up until then and establishing the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty as fundamental policy.

At this time, the manuscript for the speech read, Maintain the Japan-US security arrangement, but in the policy statement, Murayama read it as &quot;We will firmly maintain the Japan-US security arrangement.&quot; This attracted attention.

This was a hard turn for Murayama&#x27;s party, the Socialist Party. Although the decision was criticized as being arbitrary because it was decided from the top down, the party has endorsed it, and the modern day SDP maintains the more moderate outlook than the JSP held.

=== Domestic policy ===
Nobuo Ishihara, who served as Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary, said of the Murayama Cabinet, &quot;It dealt with most of the long-pending issues in national politics. It did a great job. Reform, revision of the Self-Defense Forces Act to rescue Japanese nationals, enactment of Atomic Bomb Survivors Relief Act,and enactment of Administrative Reform Act.&quot;

==== Acceptance of nuclear power ====
In a shift from the party&#x27;s policy, which had led the anti-nuclear power movement up until now, the party stated in its parliamentary response that &quot;Considering electricity demand, it is unavoidable to create a certain amount of nuclear power generation.&quot;

==== Enactment of recycling law ====
Under Murayama, the was passed, mandating separate collection of recyclable goods and trash.

==== Narita Airport struggle ====

By the time the Murayama Cabinet took office, the Sanrizuka Struggle had transitioned from violent to more non-violent resistance, although debate was still fierce on both sides. In response to the conclusions of the &quot;Narita Airport Problem Symposium&quot; held 15 times from November 1991 and the &quot;Narita Airport Problem Round Table Conference&quot; held 12 times from September 1993, Murayama decided on this issue in 1995. He apologized fully to the local community for the circumstances surrounding the airport issue. As a result, some landowners appeared willing to acquire land for the second phase of construction. Later, in 1996, a plan was developed to construct a temporary runway avoiding unpurchased land. In addition to the apology from Murayama and other government officials, the hard-line stance of residents opposed to Narita International Airport gradually softened due to repeated efforts by neutral committee members.

==== Selective surname system ====
Murayama was a strong supporter of the introduction of the selective surname system for married couples, allowing them to keep their surnames from before marriage.

==== Revision of Religious Corporation Law, and fight with Soka Gakkai ====
In response to the Aum Shinrikyo Tokyo subway sarin attack, Murayama instructed Minister of Education Yoshinobu Shimamura to submit a bill to revise the . During the deliberations, the three ruling parties (LDP, JSP, and NPS) demanded that Soka Gakkai Honorary President Daisaku Ikeda and Soka Gakkai President Einosuke Akiya be subpoenaed as witnesses, leading to opposition from the New Frontier Party and ex-members of Kōmeitō who had merged into the NFP. The Diet came to a standstill as Komeito-affiliated members and members of the NFP attempted to block the vote from occurring by locking out Man Sasaki, chairman of the Special Committee on Religious Corporations in the House of Councilors, and picketing in and outside of the National Diet Building. In the end, Akiya was summoned to the Diet as an expert witness, and the revised Religious Corporations Law was enacted.

Furthermore, Murayama was known to be critical of the Soka Gakkai movement as a whole. When Kotaro Tawara launched the &quot;Shigatsu-kai&quot;, which was heavily critical of the Soka Gakkai&#x27;s political activities, Murayama attended with the title of General Secretary of the Japan Socialist Party. When he retired as Prime Minister in January 1996, he told executives of the three ruling parties that &quot;I want the three-party coalition to be preserved. That is my wish. I do not want this country to be under the control of Soka Gakkai. We cannot leave it to one political party to decide.&quot; In addition, the Murayama cabinet contained a significant number of figures who were heavily critical of Komeito and the Soka Gakkai&#x27;s movements goals, including those who advocated to strengthen Article 20 of the Constitution, which maintains strict separation of church and state.

==== Strengthening the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office====
Upon entering the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office, Murayama felt a sense of crisis because, with the exception of the Prime Minister, the Chief Cabinet Secretary, and the Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary, all staff at the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office were career bureaucrats. &quot;The Prime Minister&#x27;s Office is not just an office that conducts administration , but also an office that makes political decisions.&quot; The post of &quot;Assistant to the Prime Minister&quot; was created for this reason. The Prime Minister&#x27;s assistants were chosen from among the Diet members belonging to the three ruling parties, with Hidenao Nakagawa, Masaru Hayakawa, Jun Nishikori, and Saburo Toida all being appointed to the office. The appointed assistant to the Prime Minister was in charge of providing opinions on the Prime Minister&#x27;s speeches and answers, as well as gathering information on political issues. The post of &quot;Aide to the Prime Minister&quot; was considered a personal advisor to the Prime Minister, but the Cabinet Act was later amended and the post of &quot;Aide to the Prime Minister&quot; was legislated to be more political in nature.

==After politics==

In 2000, Murayama retired from politics. He and Mutsuko Miki traveled to North Korea in 2000 to promote better bilateral relations between the two countries.

Murayama became the president of the Asian Women&#x27;s Fund, a quasi-government body that was set up to provide compensation for former comfort women. After providing compensation and working on various projects, the fund was dissolved on 31 March 2007.

Murayama turned 100 on 3 March 2024.

<text>Labna (or Labná in Spanish orthography) is a Mesoamerican archaeological site and ceremonial center of the pre-Columbian Maya civilization, located in the Puuc Hills region of the Yucatán Peninsula. It is situated to the south of the large Maya site of Uxmal, in the southwest of the present-day state of Yucatán, Mexico. Labna, Sayil and Kabah were incorporated with Uxmal as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996.

== History ==
The city existed from 200 to 1000 AD. It reached its peak in the period from 800 to 1000 AD. It undoubtedly had a complex social organization and shares style and decorative elements with other cities in the region (Uxmal, Sayil, Kabah). It is estimated that about 3,000 inhabitants lived in Labna.

The first written report of Labna was by John Lloyd Stephens who visited it with artist Frederick Catherwood in 1842. Thanks to this, drawings illustrating the state of the ruins from that period have also been preserved.

== Archeological Zone ==
The site is a comparatively small and compact one. Among its notable structures is a large two-storey &#x27;palace&#x27; (&quot;El Palacio&quot;), which is one of the longest contiguous structures in the Puuc region at approximately 120 m (393.7 ft) in length. From the palace, a ceremonial road (&quot;sacbe&quot;) extends to an elaborately decorated gateway arch (&quot;El Arco&quot;). This structure is 3 m (9.8 ft) wide and 6 m high, with well-reserved bas-reliefs. The arch is not an entrance to the city, but rather is a passageway between public areas. Next to this gateway stands &quot;El Mirador&quot;, a pyramid-like structure surmounted by a temple. A part of the same site is the Temple of the Columns.

The structural design and motifs of the site&#x27;s buildings are in the Maya architecture regional style known as &quot;Puuc&quot;. This makes extensive use of well-cut stone forming patterns and depictions, including masks of the long-nosed rain-god Chaac.

The site was built in the Late and Terminal Classic era. A date corresponding to AD 862 is inscribed in the palace.

The site is open to visitors.

== References ==
As the relations between India and Mexico are warming up, India has recently unveiled a replica of the Arch at Garden of Five Senses, New Delhi as a goodwill gesture.

<text>Gustavo A. Madero is the northernmost borough (&quot;demarcación territorial&quot;) of Mexico City.

==History==
Founded as &quot;Villa de Guadalupe&quot; in 1563, it became the city of &quot;Villa de Guadalupe Hidalgo&quot; in 1828, and finally a &quot;delegación&quot; in 1931. It was named after Gustavo A. Madero, the brother and fellow revolutionary of President Francisco I. Madero.

The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which ended the Mexican–American War of 1846–1848, was signed in Gustavo A. Madero.

==Points of interest==
The area houses the Basílica de Guadalupe, the shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe at the foot of Tepeyac Hill, where Roman Catholics believe the Virgin Mary appeared to the indigenous Mexican Juan Diego Cuauhtlatoatzin in 1531.

Being the northernmost borough, the Northern Central Bus Station (&quot;Terminal Central del Norte&quot;) is located here, providing constant bus service to all major cities in the northern and western part of the country.

On Sundays, the San Felipe de Jesús Tianguis in the neighborhood of the same name, is Latin America&#x27;s largest tianguis or street market, with 30,000 vendors and stretching seven kilometers.

==Education==
Public high schools of the &quot;Instituto de Educación Media Superior del Distrito Federal&quot; (IEMS) include:
*Escuela Preparatoria Gustavo A. Madero I &quot;Belisario Domínguez&quot;
*Escuela Preparatoria Gustavo A. Madero II &quot;Salvador Allende&quot;

Private schools:
*Multiple campuses of the Sistema Educativo Justo Sierra: Acueducto (Laguna Ticomán), Aragón (San Juan de Aragón), and Insurgentes (Lindavista)
*Colegio Guadalupe in Lindavista
*Escuela Cristóbal Colón de la Salle (three campuses)
*Instituto Ovalle Monday S. C. (preschool through junior high school, including elementary schools in Lindavista)

<doc id="355641" wikidata="Q1073030" url="?curid=355641" title="Sieges of Nagashima">
<text>The , taking place in 1571, 1573, and 1574, were part of Oda Nobunaga&#x27;s campaigns against the Ikkō-ikki, arguably among his greatest enemies. Nagashima, in Owari Province along Japan&#x27;s Pacific coast, was the location of a string of river island fortresses and defensive works controlled by the Ikkō-ikki, which surrounded their Ganshō-ji monastery. This string of defenses included Nagashima Castle, which they had captured previously. Oda Nobunaga attacked three times over the course of four years, before finally destroying the entire Nagashima complex. These sieges were executed concurrently with Nobunaga&#x27;s eleven-year siege against the Ikki&#x27;s primary fortress of Ishiyama Hongan-ji.

==First Siege of Nagashima (1571)==
Nobunaga&#x27;s troops made camp at Tsushima, to the northeast of Nagashima, on 16 May 1571. Separated from the Ikki&#x27;s fortresses by a shallow but broad river, Nobunaga&#x27;s commanders, Sakuma Nobumori and Shibata Katsuie, planned their attack upon the nearby wajū, small island communities from which attacks on Ganshōji could be launched. These islands were defended from flooding by a complex series of levees.

Nobunaga&#x27;s forces attacked across the river, but their horses became stuck in the soft mud of the river bottom. The samurai that managed to drag themselves to shore while being fired on were further slowed by ropes stretched across stakes, which tripped up their horses further. Many were then drowned when the defenders opened a dike and flooded the area. Katsuie was injured, Ujiie Naotomo was killed, and many samurai were lost; this first attempt was a definite failure for Nobunaga. His men did manage to set a few villages aflame, however, as they withdrew.

==Second Siege of Nagashima (1573)==
Nobunaga returned to the matter of Nagashima in July 1573 with a sizable force, largely recruited from Ise Province and containing a good number of arquebusiers. His fervor had been renewed by a successful campaign against the warrior monks of Mount Hiei. His commanders Sakuma Nobumori and Hashiba Hideyoshi (later to be known as Toyotomi Hideyoshi) led a diversionary force attacking from the west, while Nobunaga hoped for his own force to charge forward behind the gunners.

Unfortunately, despite the fame Nobunaga would later receive for his expert firearms tactics, this battle would turn out to be one of his more famous failures in that field. A rainstorm hit just as he was about to open the battle. The rain rendered 90% of the arquebuses useless and left his men in a terribly weak defensive position. The Ikkō-ikki troops immediately counter-attacked. They too are now known for their expertise with firearms, and their arquebuses were covered during the storm. The Ikki began firing as soon as the rain let up, and even came quite close to killing Nobunaga. Nobunaga fell back, attempting to bring his own gunners to bear once more but was forced to retreat.

Another diversionary force, led by Takigawa Kazumasu, captured Yata castle, at the southern tip of the Nagashima complex. They too, however, were forced to withdraw after a successful Ikki counterattack.

==Third Siege of Nagashima (1574)==

In 1574, Oda Nobunaga finally succeeded in destroying Nagashima, one of the primary fortresses of the Ikkō-ikki, who numbered among his most bitter enemies.

A fleet of ships led by Kuki Yoshitaka blockaded and bombarded the area, using cannon and fire arrows against the Ikki&#x27;s wooden watchtowers. This blockade and naval support allowed Nobunaga to seize the outer forts of Nakae and Yanagashima, which in turn allowed him to control access to the west of the complex for the first time.

Eventually, the defenders were forced back by a three-pronged attack, into the fortified monasteries of Ganshōji and Nagashima. The Ikkō-ikki present numbered around 20,000 and they were now completely cut off from outside sources of food, water, and other supplies. As their situation worsened in July and August 1574, the Ikki&#x27;s allies saw the prospects of relieving the siege worsen as well.

Nobunaga&#x27;s men built a wooden wall from one outer fort to another, cutting the Ikkō-ikki off from the outside completely. A large wooden palisade was constructed and then set aflame, resulting in the complete destruction of the entire fortress complex; no one escaped or survived.

<text>Al-Andalus () was the Muslim-ruled area of the Iberian Peninsula. The name refers to the different Muslim states that controlled these territories at various times between 711 and 1492. At its greatest geographical extent, it occupied most of the peninsula as well as Septimania under Umayyad rule. These boundaries changed constantly through a series of conquests Western historiography has traditionally characterized as the &quot;Reconquista&quot;, eventually shrinking to the south and finally to the Emirate of Granada.

As a political domain, it successively constituted a province of the Umayyad Caliphate, initiated by the Caliph al-Walid I (711–750); the Emirate of Córdoba (–929); the Caliphate of Córdoba (929–1031); the first &quot;taifa&quot; kingdoms (1009–1110); the Almoravid Empire (1085–1145); the second &quot;taifa&quot; period (1140–1203); the Almohad Caliphate (1147–1238); the third &quot;taifa&quot; period (1232–1287); and ultimately the Nasrid Emirate of Granada (1238–1492). Under the Caliphate of Córdoba, the city of Córdoba became one of the leading cultural and economic centres throughout the Mediterranean Basin, Europe, and the Islamic world. Achievements that advanced Islamic and Western science came from al-Andalus, including major advances in trigonometry (Jabir ibn Aflah), astronomy (al-Zarqali), surgery (al-Zahrawi), pharmacology (Ibn Zuhr), and agronomy (Ibn Bassal and Abu&#x27;l-Khayr al-Ishbili). Al-Andalus became a conduit for cultural and scientific exchange between the Islamic and Christian worlds.

For much of its history, al-Andalus existed in conflict with Christian kingdoms to the north. After the fall of the Umayyad caliphate, al-Andalus was fragmented into &quot;taifa&quot; states and principalities, some of which (such as the Taifa of Toledo, the Taifa of Zaragoza, the Taifa of Seville and the Taifa of Badajoz) reached considerable territorial extent. After the Christian capture of Toledo in 1085, the Almoravid empire intervened and repelled attacks on the region, then brought al-Andalus under direct Almoravid rule. For the next century and a half, al-Andalus became a province of the Muslim empires of the Almoravids and their successors, the Almohads, both based in Marrakesh.

Ultimately, the northern Christian kingdoms overpowered the Muslim states to the south. In the 13th century, most of the south quickly fell under Christian rule, with Gharb al-Andalus, the Guadalquivir Valley and Eastern al-Andalus falling to Portuguese, Castilian, and Aragonese conquests. This left the Emirate of Granada, that was to become a tributary state of the Crown of Castile, as the remaining Muslim state on the Iberian Peninsula, and was surrendered in 1492 to the Catholic Monarchs.

==Etymology==
The toponym &quot;al-Andalus&quot; is first attested by inscriptions on coins minted in 716 by the new Muslim government of Iberia. These coins, called &quot;dinars&quot;, were inscribed in both Latin and Arabic. The etymology of the name &quot;al-Andalus&quot; has traditionally been derived from the name of the Vandals (&quot;vándalos&quot; in Spanish, &quot;vândalos&quot; in Portuguese).

Since the 1980s, several alternative etymologies have challenged this tradition. In 1986, Joaquín Vallvé proposed that &quot;al-Andalus&quot; was a corruption of the name &quot;Atlantis&quot;. Heinz Halm in 1989 derived the name from a Gothic term, &quot;*landahlauts&quot;, and in 2002, Georg Bossong suggested its derivation from a pre-Roman substrate.

==History==
===Province of the Umayyad Caliphate===

During the caliphate of the Umayyad Caliph Al-Walid I, the commander Tariq ibn-Ziyad led an army of 7,000 that landed at Gibraltar on April 30, 711, ostensibly to intervene in a Visigothic civil war. After a decisive victory over King Roderic at the Battle of Guadalete on July 19, 711, Tariq, accompanied by his &quot;mawla&quot;, governor Musa ibn Nusayr of Ifriqiya, brought most of the Visigothic Kingdom under Muslim rule in a seven-year campaign. They crossed the Pyrenees and occupied Visigothic Septimania in southern France.

Most of the Iberian peninsula became part of the expanding Umayyad Empire, under the name of &quot;al-Andalus&quot;. It was organized as a province subordinate to Ifriqiya, so, for the first few decades, the governors of al-Andalus were appointed by the emir of Kairouan, rather than the Caliph in Damascus. The regional capital was set at Córdoba, and the first influx of Muslim settlers was widely distributed.

Following the Muslim conquest of Spain, al-Andalus, then at its greatest extent, was divided into five administrative units, corresponding very roughly to: modern Andalusia; Castile and León; Navarre, Aragon, and Catalonia; Portugal and Galicia; and the Languedoc-Roussillon area of Occitania.

The small army Tariq led in the initial conquest consisted mostly of Berbers, while Musa&#x27;s largely Arab force of over 12,000 soldiers was accompanied by a group of &quot;mawālī&quot; (Arabic, موالي), that is, non-Arab Muslims, who were clients of the Arabs. The Berber soldiers accompanying Tariq were garrisoned in the centre and the north of the peninsula, as well as in the Pyrenees, while the Berber colonists who followed settled in all parts of the country north, east, south and west. Visigothic lords who agreed to recognize Muslim suzerainty were allowed to retain their fiefs (notably, in Murcia, Galicia, and the Ebro valley). Resistant Visigoths took refuge in the Cantabrian highlands, where they carved out a rump state, the Kingdom of Asturias.

In the 720s, the al-Andalus governors launched several &quot;sa&#x27;ifa&quot; raids into Aquitaine but were decisively defeated by Duke Odo the Great of Aquitaine at the Battle of Toulouse (721). However, after crushing Odo&#x27;s Berber ally Uthman ibn Naissa on the eastern Pyrenees, Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi led an expedition north across the western Pyrenees and defeated the Aquitanian duke, who in turn appealed to the Frankish leader Charles Martel for assistance, offering to place himself under Carolingian sovereignty. At the Battle of Poitiers in 732, the al-Andalus raiding army was defeated by Charles Martel and Al Ghafiqi was killed. In 734, the Andalusi launched raids to the east, capturing Avignon and Arles and overran much of Provence. In 737, they traveled up the Rhône valley, reaching as far north as Burgundy. Charles Martel of the Franks, with the assistance of Liutprand of the Lombards, invaded Burgundy and Provence and expelled the raiders by 739.

In 740, a Berber Revolt erupted in the Maghreb (North Africa). To put down the rebellion, the Umayyad Caliph Hisham dispatched a large Arab army, composed of regiments (&quot;Junds&quot;) of Bilad Ash-Sham, to North Africa. But the great Umayyad army was crushed by the Berber rebels at the Battle of Bagdoura (in Morocco). Heartened by the victories of their North African brethren, the Berbers of al-Andalus quickly raised their own revolt. Berber garrisons in the north of the Iberian Peninsula mutinied, deposed their Arab commanders, and organized a large rebel army to march against the strongholds of Toledo, Córdoba, and Algeciras.

In 741, Balj b. Bishr led a detachment of some 10,000 Arab troops across the straits. The Arab governor of al-Andalus, joined by this force, crushed the Berber rebels in a series of ferocious battles in 742. However, a quarrel immediately erupted between the Syrian commanders and the Andalusi, the so-called &quot;original Arabs&quot; of the earlier contingents. The Syrians defeated them at the hard-fought Battle of Aqua Portora in August 742 but were too few to impose themselves on the province.

The quarrel was settled in 743 when Abū l-Khaṭṭār al-Ḥusām, the new governor of al-Andalus, assigned the Syrians to regimental fiefs across al-Andalus the Damascus jund was established in Elvira (Granada), the Jordan jund in Rayyu (Málaga and Archidona), the Jund Filastin in Medina-Sidonia and Jerez, the Emesa (Hims) jund in Seville and Niebla, and the Qinnasrin jund in Jaén. The Egypt jund was divided between Beja (Alentejo) in the west and Tudmir (Murcia) in the east. The arrival of the Syrians substantially increased the Arab element in the Iberian peninsula and helped strengthen the Muslim hold on the south. However, at the same time, unwilling to be governed, the Syrian &quot;junds&quot; carried on an existence of autonomous feudal anarchy, severely destabilizing the authority of the governor of al-Andalus.

A second significant consequence of the revolt was the expansion of the Kingdom of the Asturias, hitherto confined to enclaves in the Cantabrian highlands. After the rebellious Berber garrisons evacuated the northern frontier fortresses, the Christian king Alfonso I of Asturias set about immediately seizing the empty forts for himself, quickly adding the northwestern provinces of Galicia and León to his fledgling kingdom. The Asturians evacuated the Christian populations from the towns and villages of the Galician-Leonese lowlands, creating an empty buffer zone in the Douro River valley (the &quot;Desert of the Duero&quot;). This newly emptied frontier remained roughly in place for the next few centuries as the boundary between the Christian north and the Islamic south. Between this frontier and its heartland in the south, the al-Andalus state had three large march territories (&quot;thughur&quot;): the Lower March (capital initially at Mérida, later Badajoz), the Middle March (centred at Toledo), and the Upper March (centred at Zaragoza).

These disturbances and disorder also allowed the Franks, now under the leadership of Pepin the Short, to invade the strategic strip of Septimania in 752, hoping to deprive al-Andalus of an easy launching pad for raids into Francia. After a lengthy siege, the last Arab stronghold, the citadel of Narbonne, finally fell to the Franks in 759. Al-Andalus was sealed off at the Pyrenees.

The third consequence of the Berber revolt was the collapse of the authority of the Damascus Caliphate over the western provinces. With the Umayyad Caliphs distracted by the challenge of the Abbasids in the east, the western provinces of the Maghreb and al-Andalus spun out of their control. From around 745, the Fihrids, an illustrious local Arab clan descended from Oqba ibn Nafi al-Fihri, seized power in the western provinces and ruled them almost as a private family empire of their own Abd al-Rahman ibn Habib al-Fihri in Ifriqiya and Yūsuf al-Fihri in al-Andalus. The Fihrids welcomed the fall of the Umayyads in the east, in 750, and sought to reach an understanding with the Abbasids, hoping they might be allowed to continue their autonomous existence. But when the Abbasids rejected the offer and demanded submission, the Fihrids declared independence and, probably out of spite, invited the deposed remnants of the Umayyad clan to take refuge in their dominions. It was a fateful decision that they soon regretted, for the Umayyads, the sons and grandsons of caliphs, had a more legitimate claim to rule than the Fihrids themselves. Rebellious-minded local lords, disenchanted with the autocratic rule of the Fihrids, conspired with the arriving Umayyad exiles.

=== Umayyad Emirate of Córdoba ===
==== Establishment ====

In 755, the exiled Umayyad prince Abd al-Rahman I (also called &quot;al-Dākhil&quot;, the &#x27;Immigrant&#x27;) arrived on the coast of Spain. He had fled the Abbasids, who had overthrown the Umayyads in Damascus and were slaughtering members of that family, and then he spent four years in exile in North Africa, assessing the political situation in al-Andalus across the Straits of Gibraltar, before he landed at Almuñécar.

News of his arrival spread across al-Andalus, and when word reached its governor, Yūsuf al-Fihri, he was not pleased. During this time, Abd al-Rahman and his supporters quickly conquered Málaga and then Seville, finally besieging the capital of al-Andalus, Córdoba. Abd al-Rahman&#x27;s army was exhausted after their conquest, meanwhile Governor Yūsuf al-Fihri had returned from quashing another rebellion with his army. The siege of Córdoba began, and noticing the starving state of Abd al-Rahman&#x27;s army, al-Fihri began throwing lavish feasts every day as the siege went on, to tempt Abd al Rahman&#x27;s supporters to defect to his side. However, Abd al-Rahman persisted, even rejecting a truce that would have allowed Abd al-Rahman to marry al-Fihri&#x27;s daughter. After decisively defeating Yūsuf al-Fihri&#x27;s army, Abd al-Rahman was able to conquer Córdoba, where he proclaimed himself emir in 756. The rest of Iberia was easily conquered, and Abd al-Rahman soon had control of all of Iberia.

==== Rule ====
Abd al Rahman&#x27;s rule was stable in the years after his conquest – he built major public works, most famously the Mosque of Córdoba, and helped urbanize the emirate while defending it from invaders, including the quashing of numerous rebellions, and decisively repelling the invasion by Charlemagne (which would later inspire the epic, Chanson de Roland). By far the most important of these invasions was the attempted reconquest by the Abbasid Caliphate. In 763 Caliph Al-Mansur of the Abbasids installed al-Ala ibn-Mugith as governor of Africa (whose title gave him dominion over the province of al-Andalus). He planned to invade and destroy the Emirate of Córdoba, so in response Abd al Rahman fortified himself within the fortress of Carmona with a tenth as many soldiers as al-Ala ibn-Mugith. After a long siege, it appeared that Abd al Rahman would be defeated, but in a last stand Abd al Rahman with his outnumbered forces opened the gates of the fortress and charged at the resting Abbasid army, and decisively defeated them. After being sent the embalmed head of al-Ala ibn-Mugith, it is said Al Mansur exclaimed &quot;Praise be to God who has put the sea between me and this devil!&quot;.
Abd al Rahman I died in 788 after a lengthy and prosperous reign. He was succeeded by his son, Hisham I, who secured power by exiling his brother who had tried to rebel against him. Hisham enjoyed a stable reign of eight years and was succeeded by his son Al-Hakam I. The next few decades were relatively uneventful, with only occasional minor rebellions, and saw the rise of the emirate. In 822 Al Hakam died and was succeeded by Abd al-Rahman II, the first great emir of Córdoba. He rose to power with no opposition and sought to reform the emirate. He quickly reorganized the bureaucracy to be more efficient and built many mosques across the emirate. During his reign science and art flourished, as many scholars fled the Abbasid caliphate due to the disastrous Fourth Fitna. The scholar Abbas ibn Firnas made an attempt to fly, though accounts vary on his success. In 852 Abd al Rahman II died, leaving behind him a powerful and well-established state that had become one of the most powerful in the Mediterranean.

Abd al Rahman was succeeded by Muhammad I of Córdoba, who according to legend had to wear women&#x27;s clothing to sneak into the imperial palace and be crowned, since he was not the heir apparent. His reign marked a decline in the emirate, which was ended by Abd al-Rahman III. His reign was marked by multiple rebellions, which were dealt with poorly and weakened the emirate, most disastrously following the rebellion of Umar ibn Hafsun. When Muhammad died, he was succeeded by emir Abdullah ibn Muhammad al-Umawi whose power barely reached outside of the city of Córdoba. As Ibn Hafsun ravaged the south, Abdullah did almost nothing, and slowly became more and more isolated, barely speaking to anyone. Abdullah purged his administration of his brothers, which lessened the bureaucracy&#x27;s loyalty towards him. Around this time several local Arab lords began to revolt, including one Kurayb ibn Khaldun, who was able to conquer Seville. Some loyalists tried to quell the rebellion, but without proper material support, their efforts were in vain.

He declared that the next emir would be his grandson Abd al-Rahman III, ignoring the claims of his four living children. Abdullah died in 912, and the throne passed to Abd al Rahman III. Through force of arms and diplomacy, he put down the rebellions that had disrupted his grandfather&#x27;s reign, obliterating Ibn Hafsun and hunting down his sons. After this he led several sieges against the Christians, sacking the city of Pamplona, and restoring some prestige to the emirate. Meanwhile, across the sea the Fatimids had risen up in force, ousted the Abbasid government in North Africa, and declared themselves a caliphate. Inspired by this action, Abd al Rahman joined the rebellion and declared himself caliph in 929.

For nearly 100 years under the Córdoban Umayyad period, from the 9th century to the 10th, al-Andalus also extended its presence from Fraxinetum into the Alps with a series of organized raids.

=== Umayyad Caliphate of Córdoba ===

 The period of the Caliphate is seen as the golden age of al-Andalus. Córdoba under the Caliphate, with a population of more than half a million, eventually overtook Constantinople as the largest and most prosperous city in Europe. Al-Andalus became a centre for the arts, medicine, science, music, literature and philosophy. The work of its most important philosophers and scientists, such as Abulcasis and Averroes, had a major influence on the intellectual life of medieval Europe. Muslims and non-Muslims often came from abroad to study at the libraries and universities of al-Andalus, and after the reconquest of Toledo, several translation institutions such as the Toledo School of Translators were established for translating books and texts from Arabic into Latin. The most noted figures in this being Gerard of Cremona and Michael Scot, who took these works to Italy. The transmission of ideas significantly affected the formation of the European Renaissance.

The Caliphate of Córdoba also had extensive trade with other parts of the Mediterranean, including Christian parts. Trade goods included luxury items (silk, ceramics, gold), essential foodstuffs (grain, olive oil, wine), and containers (such as ceramics for storing perishables). In the tenth century, Amalfitans were already trading Fatimid and Byzantine silks in Córdoba. Later references to Amalfitan merchants were sometimes used to emphasize the previous golden age of Córdoba. Fatimid Egypt was a supplier of many luxury goods, including elephant tusks, and raw or carved crystals. The Fatimids were traditionally thought to be the only supplier of such goods, and control over these trade routes would be a cause for conflict between the Umayyads and Fatimids.

===&quot;Taifas&quot; period===

The Caliphate of Córdoba effectively collapsed during a ruinous civil war between 1009 and 1013, although it was not finally abolished until 1031 when &quot;al-Andalus&quot; broke up into a number of mostly independent mini-states and principalities called &quot;taifas&quot;. In 1013, invading Berbers sacked Córdoba, massacring its inhabitants, pillaging the city, and burning the palace complex to the ground. The largest of the taifas to emerge were Badajoz (&quot;Batalyaws&quot;), Toledo (&quot;Ṭulayṭulah&quot;), Zaragoza (&quot;Saraqusta&quot;), and Granada (&quot;Ġarnāṭah&quot;). After 1031, the &quot;taifas&quot; were generally too weak to defend themselves against repeated raids and demands for tribute from the Christian states to the north and west, which were known to the Muslims as &quot;the Galician nations&quot;, and which had spread from their initial strongholds in Galicia, Asturias, Cantabria, the Basque country, and the Carolingian &quot;Marca Hispanica&quot; to become the Kingdoms of Navarre, León, Portugal, Castile and Aragon, and the County of Barcelona. During the eleventh century several centres of power existed among the taifas, and the political situation shifted rapidly. Before the rise of the Almoravids from Africa or the Christians from the north, the Abbadid-ruled Taifa of Seville succeeded in conquering a dozen lesser kingdoms, becoming the most powerful and renowned of the taifas, such that it could have laid claim to be the true heir to the Caliphate of Córdoba. The taifas were vulnerable and divided but had immense wealth. During its prominence the Taifa of Seville produced technically complex lusterware and exerted significant influence on ceramic production across al-Andalus.

In the 1080s, the &quot;taifa&quot; kingdoms began to face an existential threat from the Christian kingdoms to the north, as Alfonso VI of Castile escalated attacks against them. In 1083, he led a punitive expedition against Seville that reached all the way to Tarifa at the southern tip of al-Andalus. In 1085, he annexed Toledo, a turning point which galvanized the remaining &quot;taifa&quot; leaders into seeking outside help.

===Almoravids and Almohads===
After the fall of Toledo, most of the major &quot;taifa&quot; rulers agreed to request the intervention of the Almoravids, a Berber empire based in Marrakesh that had conquered much of northwest Africa. The Almoravid leader, Yusuf Ibn Tashfin, led several campaigns into al-Andalus, initially in defense of the &quot;taifa&quot; kingdoms. At the Battle of Sagrajas (or Battle of Zallaqa in Arabic), a Muslim army led by the Almoravids soundly defeated Alfonso VI. By 1090, however, Yusuf ibn Tashfin was disillusioned with the disunity of the &quot;taifa&quot; leaders and he returned on a campaign to conquer al-Andalus instead. Most of the &quot;taifas&quot;, except for Zaragoza, were annexed by 1094. Valencia, which had come under the control of El Cid at the end of its taifa period, was eventually occupied in 1102, after El Cid&#x27;s death. Zaragoza was annexed in 1110.

Modern scholarship has sometimes admitted originality in North African architecture, but according to Yasser Tabbaa, historian of Islamic art and architecture, the Iberocentric viewpoint is anachronistic when considering the political and cultural environment during the rule of the Almoravid dynasty. The rise and fall of the Almoravids is sometimes seen as an expression of Ibn Khaldun&#x27;s asabiyyah paradigm.
By 1147, the Almoravids were overthrown in North Africa by the Almohads, another Berber dynasty, under the leadership of Abd al-Mu&#x27;min. As Almoravid rule collapsed, another brief period of &quot;taifa&quot; kingdoms followed in al-Andalus, during which the Christian kingdoms expanded southward again. From 1146 onward, the Almohads intervened and took control of al-Andalus. One of Abd al-Mu&#x27;min&#x27;s successors, Ya&#x27;qub al-Mansur, won a major victory over the Castilian Alfonso VIII at the Battle of Alarcos in 1195.

In 1212, a coalition of Christian kings under the leadership of Alfonso VIII defeated the Almohads at the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa. Almohad rule was diminished in prestige and in 1228 the Almohad caliph al-Ma&#x27;mun withdrew from al-Andalus altogether. In this political vacuum, a new wave of &quot;taifa&quot; kingdoms emerged, which were progressively conquered by Portugal, Castile, and Aragon. Córdoba was conquered in 1236 and Seville was conquered in 1248. Some Muslim city-states, such as Murcia and Niebla, survived as vassal kingdoms of Castile until the 1260s. Only the region of Granada remained unconquered.

===Emirate of Granada, its fall, and aftermath===
From the mid 13th to the late 15th century, the only remaining domain of al-Andalus was the Emirate of Granada, the last Muslim stronghold in the Iberian Peninsula. The emirate was established by Muhammad ibn al-Ahmar in 1230 and was ruled by the Nasrid dynasty, the longest reigning dynasty in the history of al-Andalus. Although surrounded by Castilian lands, the emirate was wealthy through being tightly integrated in Mediterranean trade networks and enjoyed a period of considerable cultural and economic prosperity.
Despite internal conflicts, the Nasrids of Granada were able to survive in part by playing the Christian kingdoms of the north against each other, while at other times soliciting aid from the Marinids, a new Berber dynasty ruling in North Africa from their capital in Fez. For much of its existence, Granada paid tribute to the Castilian kings. Along with this political status, its favorable geographic location, with the Sierra Nevada as a natural barrier, helped to prolong Nasrid rule.

Granada also accommodated a large number of Muslim refugees fleeing the &quot;Reconquista&quot; or expelled from Christian-controlled territories, which grew the city and the emirate&#x27;s population. The city even became one of the largest in Europe throughout the 15th century in terms of population. The most visible legacy of the Nasrids is the Alhambra, their fortified palace complex, partly preserved today. The independent Nasrid kingdom was also a trade hub between the Atlantic and Mediterranean, and was frequented especially by Genoese merchants.

The Marinids intervened in the south of the Iberian Peninsula multiple times up until their defeat at the Battle of Río Salado in 1340. After this, they ceased to play a major role. The subsequent internal turmoil within Castile, however, helped Nasrid Granada to enjoy a period of relative external peace and internal prosperity until the end of the 14th century, under the reigns of Yusuf I () and Muhammad V (). Important cultural figures, such as Ibn al-Khatib, Ibn Zamrak, and Ibn Khaldun all served in the Nasrid court during this period.

In 1468, Isabella, the only child of Henry IV of Castile, married Ferdinand, the son of John II of Aragon, and by 1479 they were rulers of a united Castile and Aragon. This development meant that Granada could no longer exploit divisions between the two kingdoms and the new royal couple, also known as the Catholic Monarchs, were united in their intention to conquer it. The final war to conquer Granada began in earnest in 1482. Year by year, the Christian advance captured new cities and fortresses until the last Nasrid ruler, Muhammad XII (known as Boabdil to the Christians), formally surrendered Granada to the Catholic Monarchs on 2 January 1492.

By this time Muslims in Castile numbered half a million. After the fall, &quot;100,000 had died or been enslaved, 200,000 emigrated, and 200,000 remained as the residual population. Many of the Muslim elite, including Muhammad XII, who had been given the area of the Alpujarras mountains as a principality, found life under Christian rule intolerable and passed over into North Africa.&quot; Under the conditions of the Capitulations of 1492, the Muslims in Granada were to be allowed to continue to practice their religion.

Mass forced conversions of Muslims in 1499 led to a revolt that spread to Alpujarras and the mountains of Ronda; after this uprising the capitulations were revoked. In 1502 the Catholic Monarchs decreed the forced conversion of all Muslims living under the rule of the Crown of Castile, although in the kingdoms of Aragon and Valencia (both now part of Spain) the open practice of Islam was allowed until 1526. Descendants of the Muslims were subject to expulsions from Spain between 1609 and 1614 (see Expulsion of the Moriscos). The last mass prosecution against Moriscos for crypto-Islamic practices occurred in Granada in 1727, with most of those convicted receiving relatively light sentences. The Morisco community including these final convicts kept their identity alive at least through the late eighteenth century.

== Science ==
There was much scientific activity in Al-Andalus, especially in the fields of medicine, astronomy, mathematics, and agronomy. At the same time, Andalusi scholars were also highly active in philosophy (see below), especially in the field of logic. The earliest evidence of such activities in al-Andalus dates to the reign of Abd ar-Rahman II (), when developments were spurred by exposure to older works translated from, Greek, Persian and other languages. Scientific studies continued to be pursued in the following centuries, though certain fields and subjects thrived more depending on the period. Scholars often worked in many different and overlapping subjects, so it is difficult to place those discussed here into a single scientific field each.

=== Medicine ===

There were many notable surgeons, physicians, and medical scholars from al-Andalus including Ibn al-Baytar (d. 1248), Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (Albucasis; d. 1013), Muhammad al-Shafrah (d. 1360), Abu Marwan &#x27;Abd al-Malik ibn Habib (d. 853), and Abu Marwan ibn Zuhr (Avenzoar; d. 1162). And of particular note is al-Zahrawi, who is considered by many to be &quot;probably the greatest physician in the entire history of Western Islam.&quot; Around the year 1000 C.E, he wrote a book with a title that roughly translates to &quot;The Arrangement of Medical Knowledge for One Who is Not Able to Compile a Book for Himself&quot; (&quot;Kitab al-tasrif li-man &#x27;ajiza &#x27;an al-ta&#x27;alif&quot;)—a comprehensive medical encyclopedia with the goal of summarizing all existing medical knowledge and eliminating the need for students and practitioners to rely on multiple medical texts. The book is renowned for its chapter on surgery which included important illustrations of surgical instruments, as well as sections &quot;on cauterization, on incisions, venesection and wounds, and on bone-setting.&quot; For hundreds of years after its publication it was one of the most widely used medical texts for students and medical practitioners and was translated into Hebrew, Latin, and Castilian. This encyclopedia is also significant for its inclusion of al-Zahrawi&#x27;s personal experiences as a surgeon, which provided important case studies for aspiring surgeons. This distinguishes it from other strictly factual medical works of the time, most notably Ibn Sina&#x27;s &quot;Canon of Medicine&quot;.

Other important medical texts include al-Baytar&#x27;s &quot;Comprehensive Book on Simple Drugs and Foodstuffs&quot;—an encyclopedia with descriptions of the medical uses of over 1400 plants and other types of medicine—and ibn Habib&#x27;s &quot;Book of the Medicine of the Arabs&quot; (&quot;Kitab tibb al-&#x27;arab&quot;)—a historical summary of Arabic medicine until the 9th century. Ibn Habib&#x27;s work is significant because it is one of the oldest known writings in the field of prophetic medicine, which uses hadiths to create Islamic-based medicinal guidelines. His book is also significant because it uses principles of Galenic medicine, such as humorism and the theory of four temperaments, as the basis of its medical recommendations.

The ibn Zuhr family played a very important role in the production of Andalusi medical knowledge, as they produced five generations of medical experts, particularly in the fields of dietary sciences and medicaments. Abu Marwan ibn Zuhr (d. 1162) is particularly notable, as he wrote the &quot;Book of Moderation&quot; (&quot;Kitab al-Iqtisad&quot;)—a treatise on general therapy; the &quot;Book of Foods&quot; (&quot;Kitab al-Aghdhiya&quot;)—a manual on foods and regimen which contains guidelines for a healthy life; and the &quot;Kitab al-Taysir&quot;—a book written to act as a compendium to Ibn Rushd&#x27;s Colliget. In &quot;Kitab al-Taysir&quot; he provides one of the earliest clinical descriptions of the scabies mite.

=== Astronomy ===
Three of the most notable Andalusi astronomers were Ibn Tufail (d. 1185), Ibn Rushd (Averroes; d. 1198), and Nur ad-Din al-Bitruji (Alpetragius; d. 1204). All lived around the same time and focused their astronomical works on critiquing and revising Ptolemaic astronomy and the problem of the equant in his astronomical model. Instead, they accepted Aristotle&#x27;s model and promoted the theory of homocentric spheres.

Al-Bitruji is believed to have studied under Ibn Tufail and Bitruji&#x27;s &quot;Book on Cosmology&quot; (&quot;Kitab fi al-hay&#x27;a&quot;) built on Ibn Tufail&#x27;s work, as well as that of Ibn Rushd, Ibn Bajja, and Maimonides. The book&#x27;s goal was &quot;to overcome the physical difficulties inherent in the geometrical models of Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot; and to describe the cosmos in agreement with Aristotelian or Neoplatonic physics,&quot; which it succeeded in doing to an extent. Bitruji&#x27;s book set a precedent of criticizing the &quot;Almagest&quot; in future works in the field of astronomy.

Although Ibn Rushd originally trained and practiced as a jurist, he was exposed to astronomy—possibly through Ibn Tufail—and became a renowned scientist in the field. His most popular work was his &quot;Summary of the Almagest&quot;, but he also published shorter works discussing Aristotle&#x27;s planetary theories&quot;. Ibn Rushd published writings on philosophy, theology, and medicine throughout his life too, including commentaries on the works of Ibn Sina.

In addition to writing the important &quot;Book of the Medicine of the Arabs&quot;, Ibn Habib also wrote the &quot;Book on Stars&quot; (&quot;Kirab fi l-nujim&quot;). This book included important &quot;teachings on the lunar mansions, the signs of the zodiac, [and] the division of the seasons.&quot; In these teachings, Ibn-Habib calculated the phases of the moon and dates of the annual solstices and equinoxes with relative accuracy.

Another important astronomer from al-Andalus was Maslama al-Majriti (d. 1007), who played a role in translating and writing about Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Planisphaerium&quot; and &quot;Almagest&quot;. He built on the work of older astronomers, like Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi, whose astronomical tables he wrote a discussion on and subsequently improved.

Abu Ishaq Ibrahim al-Zarqali (d. 1087) had many influential astronomical successes, as shown by Copernicus&#x27;s recognition of him in his &quot;On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres&quot; five centuries later. Along with other astronomers, he undertook extensive work to edit the Toledan Zij astronomical tables. He also accurately calculated the motion of the solar apogee to be 12.04 seconds per year, which is relatively close to today&#x27;s calculation of 11.8 seconds per year.

=== Agronomy ===
Other important scientific advances in al-Andalus occurred in the field of agronomy. These advances were in part facilitated by technological innovations in irrigation systems. State organized, large-scale irrigation projects provided water to city baths, mosques, gardens, residential homes, and governing palaces, such as the al-Hambra and its gardens in Granada. Collective, peasant-built irrigation infrastructure also played an important role, especially in agriculture. Many of these irrigation techniques, especially those utilized by peasants, were brought to al-Andalus by migrating Berber and Arab tribes. Although some irrigation projects built on existing Roman infrastructure, most of al-Andalus&#x27;s irrigation systems were new projects built separate from old Roman aqueducts. However, there is some debate about this among scholars.

One notable agriculturalist was Ibn al-&#x27;Awwam, who wrote the &quot;Book of Agriculture&quot;. This book contains 34 chapters about various aspects of agriculture and animal husbandry, including discussions of over 580 different types of plants and how to treat plant diseases.

Other agronomic innovations in al-Andalus include the cultivation of the pomegranate from Syria, which has since become the namesake and ubiquitous symbol of the city of Granada, as well as the first attempt to create a botanical garden near Córdoba by &#x27;Abd al-Rahman I.

==Culture==

=== Society ===

The society of al-Andalus was made up of three main religious groups: Muslims, Christians, and Jews. The Muslims, although united on the religious level, had several ethnic divisions, the main being the distinction between the Arabs and the Berbers. The Arab elite regarded non-Arab Muslims as second-class citizens; and they were particularly scornful of the Berbers.

The ethnic structure of al-Andalus consisted of Arabs at the top of the social scale followed by, in descending order, Berbers, Muladies, Mozarabes, and Jews. Each of these communities inhabited distinct neighborhoods in the cities. In the 10th century a massive conversion of Christians took place, and &quot;muladies&quot; (Muslims of native Iberian origin), formed the majority of Muslims. The Muwalladun had spoken in the local Romance dialects of Latin collectively called Andalusi Romance or &quot;Mozarabic&quot; while increasingly adopting the Arabic language, which eventually evolved into the Andalusi Arabic in which Muslims, Jews, and Christians became monolingual in the last surviving Muslim state in the Iberian Peninsula, the Emirate of Granada (1230–1492). Eventually, the Muladies, and later the Berber tribes, adopted an Arabic identity like the majority of subject people in Egypt, the Levant, Mesopotamia, and North Africa. Muladies, together with other Muslims, comprised eighty per cent of the population of al-Andalus by 1100. Mozarabs were Christians who had long lived under Muslim and Arab rule, adopting many Arab customs, art and architecture, and words, while still maintaining their Christian and Latin rituals and their own Romance languages.

The Jewish population worked mainly as tax collectors, in trade, or as doctors or ambassadors. At the end of the 15th century there were about 50,000 Jews in Granada and roughly 100,000 in the whole of Islamic Iberia.
Non-Muslims were given the status of &quot;ahl al-dhimma&quot; (people under protection), with adult men paying a &quot;Jizya&quot; tax equal to one dinar per year with exemptions for the elderly and the disabled. Those who were neither Christians nor Jews, such as pagans, were given the status of &quot;Majus&quot;. The treatment of non-Muslims in the Caliphate has been a subject of considerable debate among scholars and commentators, especially those interested in drawing parallels to the co-existence of Muslims and non-Muslims in the modern world.
Jews constituted more than five per cent of the population. Al-Andalus was a key centre of Jewish life during the early Middle Ages, produced important scholars and was one of the most stable and wealthy Jewish communities.

The longest period of relative tolerance began after 912, with the reign of Abd-ar-Rahman III and his son, Al-Hakam II, and the Jews of al-Andalus prospered by devoting themselves to the service of the Caliphate of Córdoba, the study of the sciences, and to commerce and industry, especially by trading in silk and slaves, which thus promoted the prosperity of the country. Southern Iberia became an asylum for the oppressed Jews of other countries.

Under the Almoravids and the Almohads, there may have been intermittent persecution of Jews, but sources are extremely scarce and do not give a clear picture though the situation appears to have deteriorated after 1160. Muslim pogroms against Jews in al-Andalus occurred in Córdoba (1011) and in Granada (1066). However, massacres of &quot;dhimmis&quot; are believed to be rare in Islamic history.

The Almohads, who had taken control of the Almoravids&#x27; Maghribi and Andalusi territories by 1147, far surpassed the Almoravides in fundamentalist outlook, and treated the non-Muslims harshly. Faced with the choice of either death or conversion, many Jews and Christians emigrated. Some, such as the family of Maimonides, fled east to more tolerant Muslim lands.

Many ethnicities and religions co-existed in al-Andalus, each of which contributed to its intellectual prosperity. Literacy in Islamic Iberia was far more widespread than in many other nations in the West of the time.

In the 11th century, the Hindu-Arabic numeral system (base 10) had reached Europe via Al-Andalus through Spanish Muslims, together with knowledge of astronomy and instruments like the astrolabe, which was first imported by Gerbert of Aurillac. For that reason, the numerals came to be known in Europe as Arabic numerals despite their origins in India.

From the earliest days, the Umayyads wanted to be seen as intellectual rivals to the Abbasids and for Córdoba to have libraries and educational institutions to that of their rival, Baghdad. Although there was a clear rivalry between the two powers, there was freedom to travel between the two caliphates, which helped spread new ideas and innovations over time.

===Language===
Multilingualism, language contact, and code-switching were important features of the shifting linguistic landscape in al-Andalus, which included Arabic, in vernacular Andalusi Arabic and formal Classical Arabic registers, vernacular Andalusi Romance and formal Latin, Hebrew, and or Berber. Multilingual households were an attested phenomenon.

Initially, most of the population spoke Romance dialects. The dialects of Iberian Romance that were spoken in al-Andalus are collectively referred to as Andalusi Romance or Mozarabic. What is hypothesized about these dialects is based on sparse evidence, including Romance topographical and personal names and the &quot;kharjas&quot; of some &quot;&quot; poetry. 

Arabic arrived with the Umayyad conquest of Hispania in 711 and spread gradually over the following centuries, primarily through conversion to Islam. Arabic in al-Andalus became the language of administration and of literature and a &quot;vehicle for a higher culture, a literate and literary civilization.&quot; It was widely adopted by the end of the 9th century, even among Andalusi Christians and Jews, who wrote Arabic in Hebrew but did not have a distinct dialect. The vernacular varieties of Arabic spoken in al-Andalus, referred to as Andalusi Arabic, were Maghrebi Arabic dialects influenced by their contact with Romance, just as Arabic influenced Spanish. By about 1260, following the Almohad period, most Christians had migrated to the north and Muslim territories in Iberia were reduced to the Emirate of Granada, in which more than 90% of the population had converted to Islam and Arabic-Romance bilingualism seems to have largely disappeared.

The literary traditions of Hebrew—which was used for prayer and ceremonial writings, but not for oral communication—experienced a revolution through contact with Arabic and its literary traditions. Consuelo López Morillas writes that Jews in al-Andalus &quot;wrote Hebrew poetry using Arabic prosodic models and adopted nearly the entire range of Arabic poetic genres and stylistic devices in Hebrew,&quot; looking to Biblical Hebrew as a source for literary expression as Muslims looked to Quranic Arabic.

Berber languages, referred to in contemporary sources as (, Arabic for &#x27;the western tongue&#x27;), were especially present in periods of Berber rule, particularly under the Almoravids and Almohads. Under Almohad rule, it was compulsory to deliver the &quot;khuṭba&quot; (sermon) at Friday prayer in Arabic and .

===Literature and poetry===
In al-Andalus, there are 11,831 known scholars who were active and 13,730 known works that were written or transmitted from the eighth to fifteenth centuries. Of these scholars, those who are well known and remembered in the West, such as Ibn Rushd, Ibn Hazm, or Ibn Arabi, are not necessarily the same scholars that are remembered in Islamic culture, such as Abū ʿUmar b. ʿAbd al-Barr, Abū l-Walīd al-Bājī, Ibn ʿAtịyya, Ibn al-ʿArīf, or Abū Isḥāq aš-Šāṭibī.

Poetry was considered the prime literary genre in Arabic. Traditional forms of Arabic poetry from the Mashriq, or Muslim East, especially the monometer, monorhyme &quot;qaṣīda&quot; and the prosimetric &quot;maqāma&quot;, were adopted in al-Andalus. The major Andalusi innovation in poetry was the &#x27;rhyme revolution&#x27; embodied in the 10th-11th century strophic song form called the &quot;muwaššaḥ&quot; (&#x27;girdled&#x27;; pl. &quot;muwaššaḥāt&quot;). The &quot;muwaššaḥ&quot; features a complex rhyme scheme usually containing five &quot;aghsān&quot; (&#x27;branches&#x27;; sing. &quot;ghusn&quot;), with uniform rhyme within each strophe, interspersed with &quot;asmāṭ&quot; (&#x27;threads for stringing pearls&#x27;; sing. &quot;simṭ&quot;) with common rhyme throughout the song, as well as a terminal &quot;kharja&quot;, the song&#x27;s final &quot;simṭ&quot;, which could be in a different language. Andalusi &quot;zajal&quot; was strophic poetry in Andalusi vernacular Arabic, usually associated with Ibn Quzman. Andalusi strophic poetry had an impact on poetic expression in Western Europe, especially the Old Occitan/Provençal lyric of the troubadours, and in the wider Muslim world.&quot;Rithā&#x27; al-Andalus&quot; is considered the most significant of a series of poems that were written in the classical tradition of &quot;rithā&#x27;&quot; (which denotes both lamentation and a literary genre in itself) by Andalusi poets who had taken inspiration from the fall of Andalusi cities and territories. Jewish poetry from Al-Andalus also developed, mostly but not exclusively in Hebrew, with significant consonance with Arabic poetry in both theme and form.

One specialist of Al-Andalus&#x27; intellectual history, Maria Luisa Avila, says that &quot;biographical dictionaries have recorded information about thousands of distinguished people in every period from al-Andalus, who were “cultivators of knowledge”&quot;,&quot; particularly in the legal-religious sciences as well as authors&quot;, and that &quot;the exact number of scholars which appears in the biographical sources has not been established yet, but it surely exceeds six thousand.&quot; It has been estimated that in the 10th century between 70,000 and 80,000 manuscripts were copied on a yearly basis in Córdoba alone.

=== Music ===
The music of al-Andalus is part of an influential musical tradition. Ziryab, a poet and musician, who came from the Abbasid Caliphate and arrived in Córdoba in 822, played a role in Andalusi music as well as other aspects of Andalusi culture. Poetic forms such as the &quot;muwashshah&quot;, the &quot;kharja&quot;, the &quot;nawba&quot;, and the &quot;zajal&quot; are prominent in Andalusi music.

===Philosophy===
====Al-Andalus philosophy====
The historian Said al-Andalus wrote that Caliph Abd-ar-Rahman III had collected libraries of books and granted patronage to scholars of medicine and &quot;ancient sciences&quot;. Later, &quot;al-Mustansir&quot; (Al-Hakam II) went yet further, building a university and libraries in Córdoba. Córdoba became one of the world&#x27;s leading centres of medicine and philosophical debate.

When Al-Hakam&#x27;s son Hisham II took over, real power was ceded to the &quot;hajib&quot;, al-Mansur Ibn Abi Aamir. Al-Mansur was a distinctly religious man and disapproved of the sciences of astronomy, logic, and especially of astrology, so much so that many books on these subjects, which had been preserved and collected at great expense by Al-Hakam II, were burned publicly. With Al-Mansur&#x27;s death in 1002, interest in philosophy revived. Numerous scholars emerged, including Abu Uthman Ibn Fathun, whose masterwork was the philosophical treatise &quot;Tree of Wisdom&quot;. Maslamah Ibn Ahmad al-Majriti (died 1008) was an outstanding scholar in astronomy and astrology; he was an intrepid traveller who journeyed all over the Islamic world and beyond and kept in touch with the Brethren of Purity. He is said to have brought the 51 &quot;Epistles of the Brethren of Purity&quot; to &quot;al-Andalus&quot; and added the compendium to this work, although it is quite possible that it was added later by another scholar with the name al-Majriti. Another book attributed to al-Majriti is the &quot;Ghayat al-Hakim&quot;, &quot;The Aim of the Sage&quot;, which explored a synthesis of Platonism with Hermetic philosophy. Its use of incantations led the book to be widely dismissed in later years, although the Sufi communities continued to study it.

A prominent follower of al-Majriti was the philosopher and geometer Abu al-Hakam al-Kirmani who was followed, in turn, by Abu Bakr Ibn al-Sayigh, usually known in the Arab world as Ibn Bajjah, &quot;Avempace&quot;.

The al-Andalus philosopher Averroes (1126–1198) was the founder of the Averroism school of philosophy, and his works and commentaries influenced medieval thought in Western Europe. Another influential al-Andalus philosopher was Ibn Tufail.

====Jewish philosophy and culture====
As Jewish thought in Babylonia declined, the tolerance of &quot;al-Andalus&quot; made it the new centre of Jewish intellectual endeavours. Poets and commentators like Judah Halevi (1086–1145) and Dunash ben Labrat (920–990) contributed to the cultural life of &quot;al-Andalus&quot;, but the area was even more important to the development of Jewish philosophy. A stream of Jewish philosophers, cross-fertilizing with Muslim philosophers (see joint Jewish and Islamic philosophies), culminated with the widely celebrated Jewish thinker of the Middle Ages, Maimonides (1135–1205), though he did not actually do any of his work in &quot;al-Andalus&quot;, his family having fled persecution by the Almohads around 1159.

=== Art and architecture ===
In Córdoba, Abd ar-Rahman I built the Great Mosque of Córdoba in 785. It was expanded multiple times up until the 10th century, and after the Reconquista it was converted into a Catholic cathedral. Its key features include a hypostyle hall with marble columns supporting two-tiered arches, a horseshoe-arch mihrab, ribbed domes, a courtyard (&quot;sahn&quot;) with gardens, and a minaret (later converted into a bell tower). Abd ar-Rahman III, at the height of his power, began construction of Madinat al-Zahra, a luxurious palace-city to serve as a new capital. The Umayyads also reconstructed the Roman-era bridge over the Guadalquivir River in Córdoba, while the Almohads later added the Calahorra Tower to the bridge. The Bab al-Mardum Mosque (later converted to a church) in Toledo is a well-preserved example of a small neighbourhood mosque built at the end of the Caliphate period.

The official workshops of the Caliphate, such as those at Madinat al-Zahra, produced luxury goods for use at court or as gifts for guests, allies, and diplomats, which stimulated artistic production. Many objects produced in the caliph&#x27;s workshops later made their way into the collections of museums and Christian cathedrals in Europe. Among the most famous objects of this period are ivory boxes which are carved with vegetal, figurative, and epigraphic motifs. Notable surviving examples include the Pyxis of al-Mughira, the Pyxis of Zamora, and the Leyre Casket.

During the Taifas period, art and culture continued to flourish despite the political fragmentation of Al-Andalus. The Aljaferia Palace of Zaragoza is the most significant palace preserved from this period, featuring complex ornamental arcades and stucco decoration. In other cities, a number of important palaces or fortresses were begun or expanded by local dynasties such as the Alcazaba of Málaga and the Alcazaba of Almería. Other examples of architecture from around this period include the Bañuelo of Granada, an Islamic bathhouse.In Seville, Almohad rulers built the Great Mosque of Seville (later transformed into the Cathedral of Seville), which consisted of a hypostyle prayer hall, a courtyard (now known as the &quot;Patio de los Naranjos&quot; or Court of Oranges), and a massive minaret tower now known as the Giralda. The minaret was later expanded after being converted into a bell tower for the current cathedral. Almohad architecture promoted new forms and decorative designs such as the multifoil arch and the sebka motif, probably influenced by the Caliphate-period architecture of Córdoba.

Artists and intellectuals took refuge at Granada after the Christian kingdoms expanded significantly in the 13th century. The palaces of the Alhambra and the Generalife in Granada reflect the culture and art of the last centuries of Muslim rule of Al-Andalus. The complex was begun by Ibn al-Ahmar, the first Nasrid emir, and the last major additions were made during the reigns of Yusuf I (1333–1353) and Muhammad V (1353–1391). It integrates buildings and gardens with the natural qualities of the site and is a testament to Andalusi culture and to the skills of the Muslim artisans, craftsmen, and builders of their era. Nasrid architecture continued the earlier traditions of Andalusi architecture while also synthesizing them into its own distinctive style, which had many similarities with contemporary Marinid architecture in North Africa. It is characterized by the use of the courtyard as a central space and basic unit around which other halls and rooms were organized. Courtyards typically had water features at their centre, such as a reflective pool or a fountain. Decoration was focused on the inside of buildings and was executed primarily with tile mosaics on lower walls and carved stucco on the upper walls. Geometric patterns, vegetal motifs, and calligraphy were the main types of decorative motifs. Additionally, &quot;stalactite&quot;-like sculpting, known as muqarnas, was used for three-dimensional features like vaulted ceilings, particularly during the reign of Muhammad V and after.

Even after Muslim territories were conquered by the Christian kingdoms, Andalusi art and architecture continued to appear for many centuries as a prestigious style under new Christian patrons employing Muslim craftsmen, originating the Mozarabic art in the Kingdom of Leon during the 10th century and becoming what is known as the Mudéjar style (named after the Mudéjars or Muslims under Christian rule). Numerous examples are found in the early churches of Toledo (e.g. the Church of San Román, 13th century) and in the cities of Aragon such as Zaragoza and Teruel. Among the most famous examples is the Alcázar of Seville, the former Abbadid and Almohad palace redeveloped by Christian rulers such as Peter of Castile, who in 1364 started adding new Moorish-style sections with the help of Muslim craftsmen from Granada and Toledo. Some surviving 13th and 14th-century Jewish synagogues were also built (or rebuilt) in Mudéjar style under Christian rule, such as the Synagogue of Santa Maria la Blanca in Toledo (rebuilt in its current form circa 1250), the Synagogue of Córdoba (1315), and the Synagogue of El Tránsito (1355–1357).
=== Food and agriculture ===
Crops produced using irrigation, along with food imported from the Middle East, provided areas around &quot;Andalusī&quot; cities with an agricultural economic sector that was the most advanced in Europe by far, sparking the Arab Agricultural Revolution. A variety of foodstuffs, spices and crops were introduced to Spain and Sicily during Arab rule, via the commercial networks of the Islamic world. These include sugarcane, rice, cotton, alfalfa, oranges, lemons, apricots, spinach, eggplants, carrots, saffron and bananas. The Arabs also continued extensive cultivation and production of olive oil (the Spanish words for &#x27;oil&#x27; and &#x27;olive&#x27;—&quot;aceite&quot; and &quot;aceituna&quot;, respectively—are derived from the Arabic &quot;al-zait&quot;, meaning &#x27;olive juice&#x27;), and pomegranates (the heraldic symbol of Granada) from classical Greco-Roman times.

Arabic influence still lingers on in Spanish cuisine through these fruits, vegetables, spices and cooking and agricultural techniques. One of the largest palm groves in the world, called the Palmeral of Elche, was established by the Arabs between the 7th–10th centuries to facilitate fruit (including pomegranate and date crops) and vegetable growth underneath the cool shade of palm trees and irrigation channels, and is cited by UNESCO as an example of the transfer of agricultural practices from one continent (North Africa) to another (Iberian Peninsula of Europe).

The period of Arab rule also involved the extension of Roman irrigation channels as well as the introduction of novel irrigation techniques from the Persianate world, such as the &quot;acequia&quot; (deriving from the classical Arabic &quot;as-sāqiya&quot;) – subterranean channels used to transport water from highland aquifers to lowland fields in arid environments –first originating in either the Arabian Peninsula or the Persian Empire (referred to as &quot;qanat&quot; or &quot;karez&quot; in the Middle East). These structures are still found in Andalusia province, particularly in Granada.

The confection &quot;alfajor&quot; (supposedly from ) has its origins in al-Andalus.

===Homosexuality and pederasty===
The &quot;Encyclopedia of Homosexuality&quot; states that &quot;Al-Andalus had many links to Hellenistic culture, and except for the Almoravid and Almohadic periods (1086–1212), it was hedonistic and tolerant of homosexuality, indeed one of the times in world history in which sensuality of all sorts has been most openly enjoyed. Important rulers such as Abd al-Rahman III, al-Hakam II, Hisham II, and al-Mu-tamid openly chose boys as sexual partners, and kept catamites. Homosexual prostitution was widespread, and its customers came from higher levels of society than those of heterosexual prostitutes.&quot; The verses of Ibn Quzman describe an openly bisexual lifestyle. Andalusi anthologies of poetry such as the &quot;Rāyāt al-mubarrizīn wa-ghāyāt al-mumayyazīn&quot; are known in part for their homoerotic and &quot;abundant pederastic poetry&quot;. Such themes were also found in the Sephardic Jewish poetry of the time.

In the book &quot;Medieval Iberia: An Encyclopedia&quot;, Daniel Eisenberg describes homosexuality as &quot;a key symbolic issue throughout the Middle Ages in Iberia&quot;, stating that &quot;in al-Andalus homosexual pleasures were much indulged in by the intellectual and political elite. Evidence includes the behaviour of rulers, such as Abd al-Rahmn III, Al-Hakam II, Hisham II, and Al Mu&#x27;tamid, who openly kept male harems; the memoirs of Abdallah ibn Buluggin, last Zirid king of Granada, makes references to male prostitutes, who charged higher fees and had a higher class of clientele than did their female counterparts: the repeated criticisms of Christians; and especially the abundant poetry. Both pederasty and love between adult males are found. Although homosexual practices were never officially condoned, prohibitions against them were rarely enforced, and usually there was not even a pretense of doing so.&quot; Male homosexual relations allowed nonprocreative sexual practices and were not seen as a form of identity. Very little is known about the homosexual behaviour of women.

===Slavery===

Slavery existed in Muslim al-Andalus as well as in the Christian kingdoms, and both sides of the religious border followed the custom of not enslaving people of their own religion. Consequently, Muslims were enslaved in Christian lands, while Christians and other non-Muslims were enslaved in al-Andalus.

The Moors imported white Christian slaves from the 8th century until the end of the Reconquista in the late 15th century. The slaves were exported from the Christian section of Spain, as well as Eastern Europe (&quot;Saqaliba&quot;). Saqaliba slavery in al-Andalus was especially prominent in the Caliphate of Córdoba where white slaves constituted most of the administrative personnel in the courts and palaces.

The slaves of the Caliph were often European saqaliba slaves trafficked from Northern or Eastern Europe. While male saqaliba could be given work in a number of tasks, such as offices in the kitchen, falconry, mint, textile workshops, the administration or the royal guard (in the case of harem guards, they were castrated), female saqaliba were placed in the harem.

The harem could contain thousands of slave concubines; the harem of Abd al-Rahman I consisted of 6,300 women. They were appreciated for their light skin. The concubines (jawaris) were educated in accomplishments to please their master, and many became known and respected for their knowledge in a variety of subjects from music to medicine. Jawaris concubines who gave birth to a child attained the status of an &quot;umm walad&quot;, which meant that they could no longer be sold and were to be set free after the death of her master.

== Legacy ==
As Andalusi cities were conquered by Leon, Castile, and other Christian Spanish kingdoms, Christian monarchs such as Alfonso X of Castile started translating the mountainous libraries of al-Andalus into Latin. These libraries contained translations of Ancient Greek texts, as well as new ones made by Muslims in the Islamic Golden Age. That, combined with the interaction with Muslims during the Crusades, and the Fall of Constantinople introducing Greek scholars to the west, helped launch the Renaissance. Scientists and philosophers such as Averroes and Al-Zahrawi (fathers of rationalism and surgery, respectively) heavily inspired the Renaissance, and their ideas are still world renowned to this day. Al Andalus has also left art and architecture and has some of the best preserved Islamic Golden Age architecture in the world, with examples including the Cathedral of Córdoba, the Alhambra, the Giralda and many more.

As a result of the Reconquista and fall of many important Andalusi cities, substantial numbers of Andalusi migrated to the Maghreb where they found place at the courts of Maghrebi rulers. Many of the elite Andalusi immigrants were Arabs. For a variety of reasons, &quot;Andalusi&quot; came to be almost synonymous with &quot;Arab&quot; in the Maghreb.

<doc id="355644" wikidata="Q910160" url="?curid=355644" title="Shigeo Nagashima">
<text>nicknamed &quot;Mr. Giants&quot; is a Japanese former professional baseball player and manager.

==Biography==
Nagashima played baseball at his local high school, and on the Rikkyo University baseball team from 1954–1957. He joined the Yomiuri Giants in 1958. His jersey number (3) is now a retired number for the Yomiuri Giants.

After retiring, he became manager of the Yomiuri Giants from 1975–1980, and again from 1993–2001. He was scheduled to manage the Japanese national team for the 2004 Athens Olympics, but he suffered a stroke shortly before and was hospitalized. He recovered from his stroke, appearing at a baseball game in the Tokyo Dome in 2005, and in a television commercial in 2006, with his son, Kazushige.

Nagashima has four children. His eldest son, Kazushige Nagashima, is a former professional baseball player, and currently works as a sportscaster. Kazushige was not as successful as his father on the field, but he played on the Yomiuri Giants when his father was manager, and has since launched a successful career as an actor and TV personality. His eldest daughter works as a businesswoman, and his younger daughter was a newscaster for TV Asahi. His youngest son is a professional race-car driver. Kazushige had twin daughters in 2004, making Nagashima a grandfather. Shigeo lost his wife, Akiko, on September 18, 2007.

==Amateur career==
Nagashima was actually a fan of the Hanshin Tigers, the rival of the Yomiuri Giants, during his childhood. After graduating from his local high school in Chiba, he entered Rikkyo University, and became the team&#x27;s regular third baseman. He won the batting title for two consecutive years in the Tokyo Big6 Baseball League, and was given the Best Nine Award five seasons in a row at third base. By his senior year, scouts from every professional team wanted to sign Nagashima, and the Nankai Hawks and Hiroshima Carp were particularly active in recruiting Nagashima. It was almost decided that he would sign with the Hawks, but he ended up joining the Yomiuri Giants in November, 1957. He signed with the Giants for 18,000,000 yen; the highest salary for a baseball player at the time.

==Professional career==
Nagashima made his professional debut in April 1958, and struck out in all four of his at-bats against Masaichi Kaneda (coincidentally, Sadaharu Oh also struck out in all of his at-bats in his debut game against Kaneda). Regardless, Nagashima became the team&#x27;s clean-up hitter by mid-season, and the Giants won the league championship. Nagashima led the league in HRs (29) and RBIs (92), and was awarded the rookie of the year award. He would have hit .300 with over 30 home runs and 30 steals in his rookie year, but he had one home run scratched off his record because he forgot to step on first base while rounding the bases after hitting a home run.

Nagashima played perhaps his most well-known game on June 25, 1959, when the Japanese emperor attended a baseball game for the first time. Nagashima hit the game-winning home run off Minoru Murayama, and rookie Sadaharu Oh also had a home run in the game.

The Yomiuri Giants cleanup consisting of Sadaharu Oh batting third, and Nagashima batting fourth, were nicknamed the ON Hou (translated to: Oh-Nagashima Cannon) as Nagashima continued his hitting prowess, and Oh emerged as the best hitter in the league. The Giants won the league championship nine years in a row from 1965–1973, and Oh and Nagashima dominated the batting titles during this period. Nagashima won the season MVP award five times, and the Best Nine Award every single year of his career (a total 17 times).

Nagashima won only two Golden Glove awards, because the title was established in Japan late during his career, in 1972. Nagashima was a flashy fielder, making extravagant leaps and dashes to field even the most routine ground ball. Giants fans were delighted by Nagashima&#x27;s fielding, even when he made careless errors.

After winning his sixth batting title in 1971, Nagashima suddenly fell into a hitting slump. The team attempted to revive him by giving him more at-bats, but Nagashima no longer had the success he had shown during his younger years. The team wanted Nagashima to take over as manager after Tetsuharu Kawakami, who had led the team for 14 years, and Nagashima doubled as a player and a coach in his final seasons. In 1974, the Chunichi Dragons won the league championship, breaking the nine-year streak held by the Giants, and Nagashima played his final game on October 14 against the Dragons, grounding out to short for a double-play in his final at-bat. The game was followed by an elaborate retirement ceremony.

==Managerial career==
Nagashima&#x27;s appointment as manager of the Yomiuri Giants was announced almost immediately after his retirement. Nagashima was given control of the team in November 1974, and he immediately rid the Giants of the tactical, small ball style left by his predecessor Tetsuharu Kawakami, relying instead on superior hitting and pitching to carry the team. He also recruited third baseman Davey Johnson from the majors, who became the first ever non-Japanese player to play for the Giants. The changes did not turn out well in the 1975 season, as the Giants ended the season in last place for the first time in the team&#x27;s history. However, the Giants recruited star players during the off-seasons, while Nagashima made further changes (including converting a lifelong outfielder to third base) and the Giants quickly re-assumed their dominant position in the Central League, winning league championships in 1976 and 1977.

The Giants lost the pennant to the Yakult Swallows in 1978, and on October 1, former Giants manager Shigeru Mizuhara made an appearance on TV Asahi&#x27;s news program, criticizing Nagashima&#x27;s handling of the team. In the off-season of the same year, Nagashima and the Giants were involved in a huge controversy concerning the drafting of pitcher Suguru Egawa. The Giants ended in fifth place in 1979, and Nagashima&#x27;s head coach was fired mid-season in yet another controversy. Criticism towards Nagashima greatly increased, and the team&#x27;s owners decided to fire Nagashima during the 1980 season. Nagashima&#x27;s immense popularity made it difficult for fans to stomach the firing, and some fans even attempted to boycott the &quot;Yomiuri&quot; newspaper in protest.

The Giants won five league championships and two championship series after Nagashima&#x27;s departure, but many people felt that the sport&#x27;s popularity in Japan was fading away, and called for Nagashima to be reinstated to revive Japanese baseball. Several teams sought Nagashima to become their manager, but he either refused or ignored their calls. Nagashima returned to the Yomiuri Giants in 1992, when Tsuneo Watanabe became the new owner of the team (Watanabe had a long-lasting affiliation with Nagashima). In the 1992 draft, he won the lottery to sign Hideki Matsui, who would become the new star of the Giants during Nagashima&#x27;s second run as manager.

Nagashima&#x27;s Giants won the Central League Pennant in 1994, 1996 and 2000, winning the Japan Series in 1994 and 2000, and he managed the team until 2001. For the 2000 Japan Series, Nagashima was managing against his former teammate, Sadaharu Oh, who was the manager for the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks. The press called it the O-N Series. In 2002, it was announced that he would lead the Japanese Olympic baseball team. The team (consisting entirely of players from the Japanese professional leagues) beat China, Taiwan, and Korea to win the Asia tournament in November 2003, but Nagashima suffered a stroke in March 2004, and was unable to travel to the Athens Olympics. The team ended up with a bronze medal in the Olympics after losing to Australia.

He was awarded People&#x27;s Honour Award on May 5, 2013, for his achievement. And more coincidentally, Hideki Matsui who he had picked in draft was also awarded at the same time.

In 2021, he received the Order of Culture for the first time as a former professional baseball player.

==Post-career==
Nagashima was one of the torchbearers in the 2020 Summer Olympics.

On September 7, 2022, Nagashima was hospitalized after suffering a brain hemorrhage.

<doc id="355645" wikidata="Q428369" url="?curid=355645" title="Battle of Nagashino">
<text>The was a famous battle in Japanese history, fought in 1575 at Nagashino in Mikawa Province (present-day Nagashino, Shinshiro, Aichi Prefecture). The allied forces of Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu (38,000) fought against Takeda Katsuyori&#x27;s forces (15,000) and the allied forces won a crushing victory over the Takeda clan. As a result, Oda Nobunaga&#x27;s unification of Japan was seen as certain.

In recent years, the battle has increasingly been referred to as the . The battle started with an offensive over Nagashino Castle, followed by a battle at Shitaragahara, about 4 km to the west of the castle. Traditionally, the siege of Nagashino Castle by the Takeda forces and the decisive battle between the two main armies were regarded as a series of manoeuvres, and the battle was called the &quot;Battle of Nagashino&quot; after Nagashino, the name of a wide area in the region. However, if the emphasis is on the actual location of the battle (where the final battle took place), it is more appropriate to use &quot;Battle of Shitara-gahara&quot;. Therefore, both place names are now listed together.

The battle is often cited as a turning point in Japanese warfare and as the first &quot;modern&quot; battle in Japan, as it was the battle in which Oda Nobunaga defeated the cavalry of the Takeda army with his powerful arquebusiers, using tanegashima.

The causes of victory for the allied forces used to be cited as the horse defensive fence (stockade) that prevented the advance of the Takeda cavalry, the three-stage shooting of 3,000 guns that fired in rapid succession in shifts of 1,000 guns each, and Katsuyori&#x27;s reckless orders for a charge. However, recent research has led to the theory that the real cause of victory was something else.
However, there is no doubt that matchlock guns played an active role, including in the sniping death of Yamagata Masakage, who was a famous general in the Takeda Army.

==Background==
The trigger for the battle was the offensive between Tokugawa Ieyasu and Takeda Katsuyori over the North Mikawa region. The Takeda and Tokugawa clans had been at war with each other since the lifetime of Takeda Shingen. Nevertheless, the Takeda forces were overwhelmingly superior in terms of strength, and the Okudaira clan and other Okumikawa provincial leaders in the north-eastern part of the Mikawa region sought to prolong their lives by joining the Takeda side. On the other hand, Tokugawa Ieyasu had a powerful ally in Oda Nobunaga, but Nobunaga, who held the capital and was rapidly increasing his power, was by no means an equal ally. Ieyasu&#x27;s position was that of a subcontractor who could not complain, although he called himself a cooperative company, and was used by Nobunaga as a good bulwark against the powerful Takeda forces. Takeda&#x27;s forces had overrun Tokugawa territory on numerous occasions, but when Shingen fell ill during a campaign in Mikawa in May 1573, Takeda&#x27;s forces retreated to Kai Province and worked to transfer power to Katsuyori while concealing Shingen&#x27;s death. Ieyasu, sensing something unusual in the movements of the Takeda forces, shrewdly set out to rewind the situation. He maneuvered the kunishū (powerful families) of Okumikawa to regain the Northern Mikawa area from the Takeda clan.

Tokugawa forces sent Honda Tadakatsu and Sakakibara Yasumasa to capture the Nagashino Castle. Both of them managed to defeat the Takeda clan armies which guarded the castle and completed their mission to capture it. By recapturing Nagashino Castle, Ieyasu gained a strategic transport point, and made it his base in the region. In response, Takeda Katsuyori, who had finished his succession of power, led the main force of the Takeda army into the Okumikawa region. He then moved south along the Toyokawa River and ravaged the entire East Mikawa region, launching raids throughout the Tokugawa vassals&#x27; estates. Aside from that, Tadakatsu also captured many other castles in Tōtōmi Province from the Takeda clan.

In 1575, during the conflict between Oda-Tokugawa alliance against Takeda Katsuyori, when the latter invaded Enshū province, Tadakatsu and Sakakibara fought under the Tokugawa forces against Katsuyori, where they captured the Komyo castle in June.

==Battle==

===Siege of Nagashino Castle===
In June 1575, Takeda Katsuyori invaded Mikawa Province. Katsuyori surrounded Nagashino Castle, which had only 500 defenders, with a large army of 15,000 men and launched an onslaught to make it a bridgehead for the Mikawa invasion. Tokugawa Ieyasu, in a difficult situation, decided that the Tokugawa army, which could mobilise only about 8,000 troops, could not stand against the Takeda army alone, and requested support from his ally Oda Nobunaga. At the time, Nobunaga had been engaged in battles with the Hongan-ji and Miyoshi clan for several years and was not normally in a position to go to Mikawa. However, he had just rested his soldiers after the battle had been brought to a halt when he attacked a castle built by the Hongan-ji and the Miyoshi clan offered to surrender. Nobunaga decided to throw the main Oda forces into Nagashino at once and left Gifu on 21 June. He led an Oda force of about 30,000 troops to Mikawa with his heir, Oda Nobutada, and joined Ieyasu at Okazaki on 22 June. Arriving at Shitaragahara on 26 June, he halted his march without going to the relief of Nagashino Castle and set up camp there. Nobunaga set up his main camp on Mount Gokurakuji, west of Shitaragahara, while Nobutada set up his camp on Mount Shinmido. Nobunaga set up camp on Shitaragahara because it was a depression. Taking advantage of the terrain, he positioned his 30,000-strong army so that it did not look like a large force from the Takeda side. Ieyasu set up camp on Mount Takamatsu in the front facing the Rengo River.

According to the &quot;Shinchō Kōki&quot;, the Oda-Tokugawa allied forces steadily built positions with horse defence fences and earthworks in preparation for the onslaught of the Takeda forces.

Meanwhile, at Nagashino Castle, which was on the verge of falling under the onslaught of the Takeda forces, Torii Suneemon was sent as a messenger to Ieyasu in Okazaki to ask for reinforcements. Informed that Ieyasu was marching on Nagashino with the Oda forces, Torii returned to the castle to deliver the good news. However, he was captured by the Takeda forces. He was persuaded that his life would be spared and his reward would be as he wished if he shouted to the castle that &#x27;reinforcements would not come&#x27;, but Torii shouted to the castle that &#x27;reinforcements would definitely come&#x27; and was crucified.
When Takeda&#x27;s vassals learnt of the arrival of Oda&#x27;s army, they advised Katsuyori to retreat to Kai, but he decided to go ahead with the decisive battle. Katsuyori had received information of Nobunaga&#x27;s departure, but was unable to gauge the strength of Oda&#x27;s forces or Nobunaga&#x27;s true intentions. However, when he saw that Nobunaga and Ieyasu&#x27;s forces did not immediately come to the relief of Nagashino Castle and began to fortify the defence, he underestimated the number of allied forces as Nobunaga had planned and judged that the enemy was weak. And he seemed to have decided that Nobunaga would not seriously help Ieyasu as he had done before, so he could strike the enemy forces down before their fighting spirit increased and he decided to go ahead with the decisive battle.
===Main Battle of Nagashino===
On 28 June, Takeda Katsuyori marched to the east of Shitaragahara with his main force of 12,000, leaving 3,000 men to maintain the siege around Nagashino Castle. Seeing this, Oda Nobunaga also advanced the Oda-Tokugawa forces, and the two sides faced each other across the Rengo River. Nobunaga moved his headquarters from Gokuraku-ji to Ishiza-yama (Chausu-yama) and took command. Nobunaga adopted a suggestion from Sakai Tadatsugu, a Tokugawa vassal, and ordered a surprise attack on Mount Tobigasu. Sakai set out in the middle of the night with a flying column of about 4,000 men. On the early morning of 29 June, Tadatsugu launched an attack against the Takeda forces defending the fort from behind Mount Tobigasu. As Takeda&#x27;s soldiers in the fort were defeated, the detachment entered the castle in cooperation with the soldiers of Nagashino Castle, driving off the Takeda forces. This left Takeda&#x27;s main army with its retreat cut off and the enemy behind it, and it had no choice but to charge at the Oda-Tokugawa force. With nowhere to go, the Takeda army began to attack the Tokugawa and Oda camps in front of it, one after the other.

After receiving the report about the battle&#x27;s development, Nobunaga personally came to Mount Takamatsu, Ieyasu&#x27;s main camp, to inspect the war situation and took command of the entire army there. He then deployed a matchlock corps led by five bugyō to the front line. Takeda&#x27;s forces repeatedly charged, but each time they were blocked by matchlock guns and horse defense fences, and retreated. By midday, victory and defeat became increasingly clear and the Takeda forces began their rout. According to &quot;Shinchō Kōki&quot;, the battle began early in the morning and lasted until around 2 pm. With many of their troops killed, Takeda&#x27;s army began to retreat, but Nobunaga pounced on them when their ranks gave way, inflicting even more casualties.

==Aftermath==
The battle ended in an overwhelming victory for the allied forces, with the Takeda side losing a number of well-known commanders.According to &quot;Shinchō Kōki&quot;, Takeda suffered a loss of 10,000 men, two-thirds of his original besieging force. Several of the Twenty-Four Generals of Takeda Shingen were killed in this battle, including Baba Nobuharu, Hara Masatane, Sanada Nobutsuna with his younger brother Sanada Masateru, Yamagata Masakage, Saegusa Moritomo, Tsuchiya Masatsugu, Naitō Masatoyo, and Obata Masamori who received a mortal wound.This defeat was too painful for Takeda Katsuyori. He could no longer afford to conquer other territories and was forced to retreat back to his stronghold of Kai.

Meanwhile, Tokugawa Ieyasu hurried to recover lost territory. In early July, immediately after the victory, he led his army to recapture one castle after another that had been captured by the Takeda forces by then.

Nevertheless, Katsuyori was a stubborn competitor and continued to torment Ieyasu by regrouping and regrouping while retreating. In the end, the Takeda clan was not destroyed until 1582, seven years after the defeat at Nagashino and Shitaragahara.

==Analysis==
The Battle of Nagashino is remembered as the battle in which Takeda Katsuyori recklessly drove his cavalry into the long horse defense fences where Oda Nobunaga was waiting with his new weapon of 3,000 matchlock guns, losing many officers and men in the process. Moreover, a myth was created that Nobunaga was a military genius who devised a new battle strategy called &#x27;three-stage shooting&#x27;, in which the shooters took turns one after the other. The three-stage shooting refers to the tactic of organising matchlock guns units into three lines, each line firing constantly in rotation. It has been claimed that Nobunaga invented this tactic to compensate for the shortcomings of matchlock guns, which takes time to reload, and enabled uninterrupted, continuous firing. Specifically, the matchlock corps, divided into three stages, fire at the front line, then fall back to the rear, clean the barrels, load bullets and then move back up to the front line to fire again. The original source for this theory was &quot;Nihon Senshi Nagashino no Eki&quot; (Japanese Military History: Battle of Nagashino, 1903), compiled by the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff Office based on the war tales &quot;Shinchōki&quot; written by Oze Hoan, a Confucian scholar of the Edo period. According to &quot;Shinchōki&quot;, Nobunaga divided the 3,000 matchlock guns into 1,000 each and instructed them to fire one stage at a time, switching from one to the other. After that book, most of the war epics that devoted a lot of paper to the Battle of Nagashino incorporated the three-stage shooting, and the content of those Edo period books was carried over into &quot;Nihon Senshi Nagashino no Eki&quot;.

Journalist Tokutomi Sohō&#x27;s &quot;Kinsei Nihon Kokuminshi&quot; (National History of Japan in Early modern period, 1918–1952) follows the account in &quot;Nihon Senshi Nagashino no Eki&quot; completely. Sohō praises the &#x27;horse defense fence&#x27; and &#x27;three-stage shooting&#x27; and states that the Shingen style of warfare is regrettable because it is outdated compared to Nobunaga&#x27;s innovative tactics. The assessment of the historical community at the time was similar, and this view was held long after the World War II. As a result, this became the prevailing view, and such scenes have been repeatedly depicted in films, TV dramas and other fictions.

However, basic problems were pointed out early on with this common theory. Subsequently, doubts were raised and research was reviewed, resulting in the prevailing opinion that the three-stage shooting by the Oda-Tokugawa allied forces with 3,000 matchlock guns was a later invention. The three-stage shooting was first questioned by amateur historical researcher Fujimoto Masayuki in his 1980 essay &quot;Nagashino no Teppō Senjutsu wa Kyokō da&quot; (Nagashino&#x27;s gun tactics are fiction). Using his rich knowledge of war and military history, and emphasising the complete absence of any mention of three-stage shooting in the highly reliable &quot;Shinchō Kōki&quot;, he continued to thoroughly criticise three-stage shooting as a fiction. According to &quot;Shinchō Kōki&quot;, Nobunaga deployed about 1,000 matchlock guns between five commanders – Sassa Narimasa, Maeda Toshiie, Nonomura Masanari, Fukuzumi Hidekatsu and Ban Naomasa – and had the ashigaru press the enemy close. Regarding the number of matchlock guns, the original entry in the &quot;Shinchō Kōki&quot; states 1,000 guns. However, some manuscripts have been rewritten as 3,000 guns, although it is unclear whether this was done by Oda himself or others. During the attack on the Mount Tobigasu fort, Nobunaga sent 500 guns with Sakai Tadatsugu&#x27;s detachment, so it seems that there were at least 1,500 guns in total. Of course, other units would have had guns, so in reality more than 1,500 would have been brought to Nagashino. However, there was no mention of three-stage shooting by the Oda side. In &quot;Mikawa Monogatari&quot;, written by Ōkubo Tadataka, a vassal of Ieyasu, even the number of guns is not mentioned. It is also known from military registers and other sources that Takeda&#x27;s army also held approximately 1,000–1,500 guns, so there was no difference between the two armies in terms of the number of guns they had.

In the 2010s, research on the Battle of Nagashino progressed dramatically with the publication of numerous new case findings and new interpretations. This has overturned the common belief that Oda Nobunaga overwhelmed the Takeda forces with his new battle strategy, and Takeda Katsuyori, who is said to have suffered a heavy defeat due to a reckless charge by his cavalry, is being re-evaluated.

The cause of the defeat of the Takeda forces in the battle can perhaps be found in the Oda-Tokugawa allied forces&#x27;s overwhelming superiority in terms of firepower and troop strength, Nobunaga&#x27;s clever placement of his forces, and the fact that the Takeda misjudged their opponents&#x27; strength and attacked them head on. Nobunaga led a large army of 30,000, twice the size of the Takeda forces, but he caught Katsuyori off guard by stopping his advance in front of Nagashino Castle when he was supposed to be on his way to rescue it, and by placing his main camp in a hollow which made it difficult to see from the Takeda side making it look like he had fewer troops. Katsuyori therefore underestimated the enemy and watched from the sidelines as the allied forces steadily built up their positions. Nobunaga then organised a detachment to occupy Nagashino Castle behind the Takeda forces, forcing the main Takeda army, fearing a pincer attack, to charge into the robust positions of the Oda-Tokugawa allied forces, protected by matchlock guns and horse defence fences. However, Katsuyori&#x27;s strategy was not necessarily reckless, as it was often seen in battles of the time to charge at the enemy lines. In fact, the battle was not settled until afternoon, and most of the Takeda warlords&#x27; deaths occurred during the retreat, not during the fighting.

It was also found that the expression &quot;Takeda cavalry&quot; was inappropriate, and that the Takeda forces did not disregard matchlock guns, but were rather less keen to introduce them in large numbers.

Traditionally, the rivalry between Oda&#x27;s matchlock guns unit and Takeda&#x27;s cavalry has been emphasised, but there was no clear qualitative difference between the Oda/Tokugawa and Takeda armies, and both had a commonplace Sengoku daimyō military unit structure. During this period, the vassals of the Sengoku daimyō assembled a number of soldiers, such as cavalry, spears, and bows, according to their territory and assets, and these types of soldiers acted in groups on the battlefield. This was also true of the Takeda forces, which had no units formed entirely of men on horseback and could be called cavalry units. Katsuyori also prepared a large number of matchlock guns, and Takeda&#x27;s military service registration and descriptions in &quot;Shinchō Kōki&quot; reveal that the percentage of matchlock guns equipped was not much different between the allied forces and Takeda forces.

The Takeda clan had promoted the equipping of matchlock guns since the time of Shingen. but had difficulty in securing large quantities of guns and obtaining nitrates, the main raw material of gunpowder, and lead, the raw material of ball shot.
On the other hand, Nobunaga, who took Sakai under his control, which had the largest trading port in Japan and was a hub for overseas trade, and who controlled distribution in Kyoto and the Kinai region, was able to easily obtain domestically produced guns and to purchase raw materials for shot and powder in large quantities from overseas in a stable manner through the Namban trade. This was evident from the results of scientific analysis of shot found at the Nagashino battlefield site. The lead in the shot of the Oda-Tokugawa allied forces was classified into three types: domestic, South China and Korea, and Thailand. In contrast, Takeda&#x27;s shot are nearly identical in composition to coins imported from China, indicating that they were manufactured by melting copper coins due to a shortage of lead. Katsuyori then instructed his troops to prepare ammunition of 200–300 rounds per gun after the Battle of Nagashino. From these facts, it can be inferred that the Takeda forces were overwhelmed by the Oda forces not only in the number of guns but also in the quantity of ammunition, and were defeated by a completely uninterrupted enemy barrage.

As seen above, the Battle of Nagashino was a battle between the Oda clan, which boasted abundant logistics and supplies in the west and the Kinai region, and the Takeda clan, which lacked such resources, in the east.

Meanwhile on more global perspective, professor Tatsuo Fujita viewed the Nagashino battle was an indicator of the Portuguese Empire ambition to make Japan as their colony through their Jesuit missionaries and merchant to gain favor of the prospective future benefactor, Oda Nobunaga. Fujita argued the indication were apparent in this battle by the fact that the rifle bullets which used by Takeda forces were only local manufacture product, while the Oda forces used imported bullets. Aside from that, Fujita also considered the close relationship between Nobunaga with the representative Catholic missionaries in the same time with the conflict between Oda clan with Takeda clan.

<text>The southern flying squirrel or the assapan (Glaucomys volans) is one of three species of flying squirrels found in North America. It is found in deciduous and mixed woods in the eastern half of North America, from southeastern Canada to Florida. Disjunct populations of this species have been recorded in the highlands of Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras.

==Description and ecology==

Southern flying squirrels have grey-brown fur on top with darker flanks and are a cream colored underneath. They have large dark eyes and flattened tails. They have a furry membrane called a patagium that extends from the front to the rear legs and is used to glide through the air. Total length (including tail) is . The tail can be .

s are nocturnal. They feed on fruits and nuts from trees such as red and white oak, hickory, and beech. They store food, especially acorns, for winter consumption. They also dine on insects, buds, mushrooms, mycorrhizal fungi, carrion, bird eggs, nestlings, and flowers. Their predators include snakes, owls, hawks, and raccoons. Domestic cats can also be potential predators.
Both in the wild and in captivity, they can produce two litters of young each year (with 2–7 young per litter). The gestation period is approximately 40 days. Young are born without fur or any capabilities of their own. Their ears open at 2 to 6 days old, and fur grows in by 7 days. Their eyes do not open until they are 24–30 days old. Mothers wean their young 65 days after they are born. The young then become fully independent at around 120 days of age.

Southern flying squirrels show substantial homing abilities and can return to their nests if artificially removed to distances of up to a kilometer. Their home ranges may be up to 40,000 square meters for females and double that for males, tending to be larger at the northern extreme of their range.

Exposure to southern flying squirrels has been linked to cases of epidemic typhus in humans. Typhus spread by flying squirrels is known as &quot;sylvatic typhus&quot; and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has documented a total of 39 such cases in the U.S. from 1976 to 2001. The squirrel acts as host to the &quot;Rickettsia prowazekii&quot; bacteria and transmission to humans is hypothesized to occur via aerosolized feces of the fleas and lice associated with &quot;G. volans&quot;.

==Gliding==

Flying squirrels do not actually fly, but rather glide using a membrane called a patagium. From atop trees, flying squirrels can initiate glides from a running start or from a stationary position by bringing their limbs under the body, retracting their heads, and then propelling themselves off the tree. It is believed that they use triangulation to estimate the distance of the landing area as they often lean out and pivot from side to side before jumping. Once in the air, they spread their long arms forward and out and their long legs backward and out, causing their membrane to stretch into a square-like shape and glide down at angles of 30 to 40 degrees. They maneuver with great efficiency in the air, making 90-degree turns around obstacles if needed. Just before reaching a tree, they raise their flattened tails that abruptly changes their trajectory upwards, and point all of their limbs forward to create a parachute effect with the membrane in order to reduce the shock of landing. The limbs absorb the remainder of the impact, and the squirrels immediately run to the other side of the trunk or to the top of the tree in order to avoid any potential predators. Although graceful in flight, they are very clumsy walkers, and if they happen to be on the ground in the presence of danger, they will prefer to hide rather than attempt to escape.

==Habitat==

The southern flying squirrel is found in eastern deciduous forests or mixed forests of North America. Large hickory and beech trees are more abundant in intensively used areas of their home ranges. Also, maple and poplar, as well as oak trees, make favorable habitats. Although southern flying squirrels may be present in heavily wooded suburban regions, they never occur in large numbers in these areas.

The size of the home range of southern flying squirrels varies greatly. Average home range estimates are 2.45 hectares, 9.0 hectares, and 16.0 hectares for adult males, 1.95 hectares, 3.9 hectares, and 7.2 hectares for adult females, and 0.61 hectares for juveniles. Significant overlap exists among the home ranges. Near the northern limit of the southern flying squirrels distribution, home range increases in size as mast-producing trees become more dispersed. This trend is also observed in fragmented forests where nesting and foraging areas become widely spaced.

Home range is larger in males than females possibly to increase the chance of encountering potential mates. Although males have a larger home range, female home ranges have been shown to increase by as much as 70 percent following the departure of the offspring.

Number of nesting sites does not influence the total number of flying squirrels but may influence which sex will be present. Male home ranges contain more food as they have been associated with a higher than expected number of large red oaks and white oaks, whereas female home ranges contain lower food resources and more abundant nesting sites possibly to avoid contact with other squirrels while raising the young.

Southern flying squirrels nest in natural cavities and woodpecker holes, or build nest out of leaves and twigs. Leaf nests are used as a refuge or a resting site and are used primarily in summer, whereas cavities are used for breeding and more intensively during winter. Cavities used by southern flying squirrels are found in small snags, average in diameter at breast height, or large living trees, average dbh, with entrances that average in width by in height, which are an average of above the ground.

Dens tend to be on the perimeter of the home range and situated away from clearings. To cross disturbances such as plantations and logged areas, southern flying squirrels prefer to use mature forest corridors over younger ones, suggesting that they are more sensitive to forest disturbances than previously believed.

==Behavior==

Southern flying squirrels are highly social mammals and have been observed flying and foraging together in large groups. Additionally, they often aggregate together in dens, especially as seasonal temperatures decline in order to conserve energy. Compared to individuals who nest alone in winter, squirrels in aggregates can save 30 percent more energy. Although southern flying squirrels do show a preference for relatedness, they are tolerant of nonrelated but familiar individuals, possibly because in addition to providing heat energy for the aggregation, outsiders will promote outbreeding. However, in the summer months, they tend to forage and cache alone in their home range. 

Muul stated that communal nesting may be detrimental during warm weather and is unnecessary in the southern parts of the species range. However, Layne and Raymond observed nest boxes in Florida and discovered that the southern populations also nest in large groups (up to 25 individuals) and that, compared to northern populations, the period of elevated communal nesting extended later in the spring. In this study, nest temperatures occasionally exceeded 38°C while the normal body temperature of southern flying squirrels varies between 36.3 and 38.9°C. Since southern populations breed later in the spring than northern populations, these findings suggests that communal nesting serves more than a thermoregulatory function and may actually play a role in the social organization of populations. Proposed advantages of aggregation include increased likelihood of mating, increased defense against predators, or increased foraging success.

Populations which nest together were found to be more highly related than expected by chance and it is believed that this could be a form of kin selection since an individual&#x27;s stored food may be beneficial for the survival of its relatives in the event of death.

Winterrowd and Weigl performed experiments in controlled conditions to determine whether memory, smell, random searching, or problem solving played a major role in retrieving hidden food. When burying dry nuts in dry substrate, no odors are present and spatial memory is the most effective retrieval mechanism, suggesting that there is no inclusive fitness involved in the hoarding behavior. However, once placed in a wet environment, smell becomes an effective means to retrieve the food and decreases the individuals&#x27; advantage over the other members of the group. Experiments to determine whether a squirrel would steal from others in the group revealed that no particular pattern exists and that the hidden food is recovered according to its availability.

<doc id="355647" wikidata="Q961882" url="?curid=355647" title="Nagashino Castle">
<text>was a Sengoku period Japanese castle located in what is now Shinshiro, eastern Aichi Prefecture, Japan. It is noteworthy as the site of the crucial Battle of Nagashino between the combined forces of Tokugawa Ieyasu and Oda Nobunaga against Takeda Katsuyori in 1575. The ruins have been protected as a National Historic Site since 1929, the first time a former castle site had received such protection.

==Background==
Nagashino Castle is placed on a cliff overlooking the confluence of the Kansagawa River (Toyokawa River) and the Uregawa River, in the northeastern portion of what is now the city of Shinshiro. All that remains of the castle today are remnants of moats and some stonework. This location commanded the crossing of the road connecting eastern Mikawa Province with southern Shinano Province and the road connecting Tōtōmi Province with eastern Mino Province.

== History ==
In the Muromachi period, this area of Mikawa Province was controlled by small, petty warlords, which included the Okudaira clan and the Suganuma clan. In 1508, Imagawa Ujichika, ruler of Suruga and Totomi Provinces, ordered his vassal Suganuma Motonari to build a castle at this location Shitara County, Mikawa Province to guard the western approaches to his domains. After the fall of the Imagawa clan at the Battle of Okehazama in 1560, the Suganuma pledged fealty to Tokugawa Ieyasu. However, when Takeda Shingen conquered the Ina region of Shinano Province and threatened northern Mikawa, the Suganuma defected to the Takeda clan.

After Takeda Shingen died in 1573, Tokugawa Ieyasu recovered Nagashino Castle and dispossessed the Suganuma, placing Okudaira Nobumasa as castellan instead. Okudaira Sadamasa had been a vassal of the Takeda, but had defected to the Tokugawa, resulting in the death of his wife and brother, who had been kept hostage by the Takeda to prevent just such an action. Anticipating that Takeda Katsuyori would attack at Nagashino, the Tokugawa and Okudaira strengthened the castle&#x27;s defenses. The anticipated attack came in May 1575, when the Takeda attacked with an army of 15,000 man and laid siege to Nagashino. Okudaira had a force of only 500 men, and managed to send a messenger to Tokugawa Ieyasu. In the subsequent Battle of Nagashino, the combined forces of Tokugawa Ieyasu and Oda Nobunaga brought a total force of 38,000 men to relieve the siege. Seeking to protect his arquebusiers from the Takeda cavalry, Nobunaga built a number of wooden stockades, behind which his gunners attacked in volleys. By mid-afternoon on the day of the battle, the Takeda broke and fled, after losing a great number of men, including eight the famous &#x27;Twenty-Four Generals&#x27; Katsuyori had inherited from Takeda Shingen. This use of gunfire was a turning point in the history of samurai warfare and the beginning of the end of the Takeda clan.

After the battle, the castle was allowed to fall into ruin. Okudaira Nobumasa received a large territory from Ieyasu and built Shinshiro Castle some distance away from Nagashino. Most of the site has disappeared under modern development; however, a huge clay wall ten meters high and wide moats which surrounded the inner bailey still exist. There is also the museum on site. The ruins are a 15-minute walk from JR Central Iida Line Nagashinojō Station.

In 2006, the site of Nagashino Castle was listed as No. 46 of the 100 Fine Castles of Japan by the Japan Castle Foundation.
