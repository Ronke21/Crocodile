<text>Trafalgar Castle School in Whitby, Ontario is an internationally known, independent day and boarding school for girls and young women in grades 4 through 12. Boarding at the school begins in grade 7. Founded in 1874 as &quot;Ontario Ladies&#x27; College&quot;, Trafalgar Castle School is one of the oldest independent schools in Canada and the second-oldest girls&#x27; school in Ontario.

==History==
The castle was built by Nelson Gilbert Reynolds, Sheriff of Ontario County, as a private residence in 1859. Reynolds was named after Lord Nelson and named his castle Trafalgar in honour of the Battle of Trafalgar.

The castle was the largest private dwelling in Canada until Casa Loma was built. It cost Reynolds $70,000, which was an exorbitant sum; a home at that time was built for $2,000, and a bank complete with vault could be built for $5,000 to $7,000. Reynolds was a colourful character and a gambling man, and indeed it was gambling losses that reportedly forced him to sell his beloved home to the Methodists in 1874 for the sum of $30,000.

The Methodists of that day were very interested in establishing higher learning institutions for young women. Rev. J. E. Sanderson convinced the Town of Whitby that this would be beneficial to its economy. James Holden, Esq. founder of the Dominion Bank, a local politician and businessman (with 5 daughters of his own) supported this idea. Sanderson and Holden were instrumental in raising the money and shares for the purchase of the castle and the establishment of Ontario Ladies&#x27; College.

Trafalgar Castle hosted its share of royalty and dignitaries through the years; both as Reynolds&#x27; residence, then as Ontario Ladies&#x27; College and now as Trafalgar Castle School.

Exterior shots of the building were used as &quot;Collinwood&quot; in the 2012 film &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;. The building has also appeared in other films such as &quot;The Vow&quot;, starring Channing Tatum, &quot;Detroit Rock City&quot;, Strike!, &quot;The Skulls&quot;, and &quot;I Shall Never Forget&quot;.

==Student life==

The school has approximately 240 day and boarding students, all girls from grade 4 to grade 12. While many boarders are international students, there are also domestic boarders from across Canada. The boarding program starts in grade 7. While the school was historically Methodist, students today are from all faiths and the school is considered non-denominational.

The current and 12th Head of School is Melissa Knight-Johnson. Knight-Johnson assumed the role as Head of School in July of 2023. Prior to this, Knight-Johnson was a teacher, Deputy Head and Director of Athletics for the school since 2007.

==Athletics==
Trafalgar has teams of various age levels in the following sports:
* Basketball 
* Cross Country
* Field hockey 
* Soccer
* Rowing
* Swimming
* Archery
* Softball

<doc id="348050" wikidata="Q3644065" url="?curid=348050" title="Stephen Watson (poet)">
<text>Stephen Watson (6 November 1954 – 10 April 2011) was a South African poet.

Most of his poetry is about the city of Cape Town, where he lived most of his life. His schooling was at Bishops (Diocesan College) in Rondebosch. He was a professor in English at the University of Cape Town. He was also the Director of the Writing Centre there, and one of the founders of the Creative Writing Program.

Creatively, he believed that poetry and literature can stand on their own and need not refer to politics, or the struggle for liberation, in order to be valid. He took a strong stand on poetic relativism, believing it was possible and desirable to differentiate between &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; poetry - a stance that has drawn criticism.

As a literary critic, Watson suggested that &quot;South Africa is held together by a nexus of peoples &#x27;dreaming&#x27; each other in terms of the myths that the distance between them creates.&quot;

Watson was anchored at the University of Cape Town for most of his career. In his poetry, he was best known as a lyrical chronicler of the Cape&#x27;s natural beauty, documenting the response of the soul when surrounded by it. His intertwinedness with the landscape spilled into his prose, too: he memorably wrote about his &quot;love affair&quot; with the city&#x27;s mountains last year, in what might be cast as a follow-up essay to his landmark 1990 piece, &quot;In These Mountains&quot;. Although poetry was Watson&#x27;s chief metier, he distinguished himself as an essayist, writing on subjects near and far, as diverse as South African &quot;black&quot; poetry and Leonard Cohen.

In February 2006, the normally reclusive Watson made the mainstream news when, writing in &quot;New Contrast&quot;, he launched an attack on Antjie Krog, accusing her of plagiarism. He claimed that she &quot;lifted the entire conception of her book [&quot;the stars say &#x27;tsau&#x27; &quot;] from [his] &quot;Return of the Moon&quot;&quot;, and that she also plagiarised from the work of Ted Hughes. Krog strongly denied the claims.

In January 2011, Watson received the English Academy&#x27;s Thomas Pringle Award for a short story, &quot;Buiten Street&quot;, published in &quot;New Contrast&quot;. His poetry featured in the most recent edition of &quot;Poetry International – South Africa&quot;, where further biographical information is available.

Stephen Watson died on 10 April 2011 after suffering from cancer.

<doc id="348052" wikidata="Q18369770" url="?curid=348052" title="Camp X">
<text>Camp X was the unofficial name of the secret Special Training School No. 103, a Second World War British paramilitary installation for training covert agents in the methods required for success in clandestine operations. It was located on the northwestern shore of Lake Ontario between Whitby and Oshawa in Ontario, Canada. The area is known today as Intrepid Park, after the code name for Sir William Stephenson, Director of British Security Co-ordination (BSC), who established the program to create the training facility.

The facility was jointly operated by the Canadian military, with help from Foreign Affairs and the RCMP but commanded by the BSC; it also had close ties with MI6. In addition to the training program, the Camp had a communications tower that could send and transmit radio and telegraph communications, called Hydra.

Established December 6, 1941, the training facility closed before the end of 1944; the buildings were removed in 1969 and a monument was erected at the site.

Historian Bruce Forsyth summarized the purpose of the facility: &quot;Trainees at the camp learned sabotage techniques, subversion, intelligence gathering, lock picking, explosives training, radio communications, encode/decode, recruiting techniques for partisans, the art of silent killing and unarmed combat.&quot; Communication training, including Morse code, was also provided. The existence of the camp was kept such a secret that even Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King was unaware of its full purpose.

== Overview ==
Camp X was established December 6, 1941, by the chief of British Security Co-ordination (BSC), Sir William Stephenson, a Canadian from Winnipeg, Manitoba and a close confidant of Winston Churchill and Franklin Delano Roosevelt. The camp was originally designed to link Britain and the US at a time when the US was forbidden by the Neutrality Act to be directly involved in World War II.

On the day before the attack on Pearl Harbor and America&#x27;s entry into the war, Camp X had opened for the purpose of training Allied agents from the Special Operations Executive (SOE), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and American Office of Strategic Services (OSS) intended to be dropped behind enemy lines for clandestine missions as saboteurs and spies.

However, even before the United States entered the war on December 8, 1941, agents from America&#x27;s intelligence services expressed an interest in sending personnel for training at the soon to be opened Camp X. Agents from the FBI and the OSS (forerunner of the Central Intelligence Agency, or CIA) secretly attended Camp X in early 1942; at least a dozen attended at least some training.

After Stephenson established the facility and acted as the Camp&#x27;s first head, the first commandant was Lt. Col. Arthur Terence Roper-Caldbeck. Colonel William &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Donovan, war-time head of the OSS, credited Stephenson with teaching Americans about foreign intelligence gathering. The CIA even named their recruit training facility &quot;The Farm&quot;, a nod to the original farm that existed at the Camp X site.

Camp X was jointly operated by the BSC and the Government of Canada. There were several names for the school: S 25-1-1 by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), Project-J by the Canadian military, and Special Training School No. 103. The latter was set by the Special Operations Executive, administered under the cover of the Ministry of Economic Warfare (MEW) which operated the facility. In 1942 the Commandant of the camp was Lieutenant Colonel R. M. Brooker of the British Army.

In addition to operating an excellent document forging facility, Camp X trained numerous Allied covert operatives. An estimate published by the CBC states that &quot;By war&#x27;s end, between 500 and 2,000 Allied agents had been trained (figures vary) and sent abroad...&quot; behind enemy lines.

Reports indicate that graduates worked as &quot;secret agents, security personnel, intelligence officers, or psychological warfare experts, serving in clandestine operations&quot;. Many were captured, tortured, and executed; survivors received no individual recognition for their efforts.&quot;

The predominant close-combat trainer for the British Special Operations Executive was William E. Fairbairn, called &quot;Dangerous Dan&quot;. With instructor Eric A. Sykes, they trained numerous agents for the SOE and OSS. Fairbairn&#x27;s technique was &quot;Get down in the gutter, and win at all costs ... no more playing fair ... to kill or be killed.&quot; Another group operated Station M for developing and making covert devices for the British Security Co-ordination. Casa Loma in Toronto is often stated as the location of this station, claiming that the book &quot;Inside Camp X&quot; is the source. In 2015, however, author Lynn Philip Hodgson rejected this in an interview with the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;. &quot;Nobody knows where Station M was. You won&#x27;t read where it was in any book.&quot; It is more likely, though not certain, that the Casa Loma stables housed the development and production of ASDIC sonar devices for U-boat detection.

Gustave Biéler, a Montrealer of Swiss origin, worked with SOE agents and French Resistance in Northern France before the D-Day invasion. &quot;The group destroyed railways, bridges, troop transports and gasoline stores and hampering enemy movement and supplies,&quot; according to a CBC report. He was captured and executed by the Nazis in 1944.

After the US entered the war, the OSS operated an &quot;assassination and elimination&quot; training program that was dubbed &quot;the school of mayhem and murder&quot; by George Hunter White. William Donovan later started similar programs in Maryland and Virginia, as well as in Cairo, Egypt. The Virginia Quantico training center was initially based on Camp X programs.

== Hydra ==
One of the unique features of Camp X was Hydra, a highly sophisticated telecommunications relay station established in May 1942 by engineer Benjamin deForest Bayly. Bayly was the assistant director, with British army rank of lieutenant colonel. He also invented a very fast offline, one-time tape cipher machine for coding/decoding telegraph transmissions labelled the Rockex or &quot;Telekrypton&quot;.

The book &quot;Inside Camp X&quot; indicates that the facility was located on Lake Ontario, 30 miles across from the U.S., because it was an ideal location for receiving radio communications from Europe and South America via the U.S. The camp was an appropriate location for the safe transfer of code due to the topography of the land; it was also an excellent site for picking up radio signals from the United Kingdom. A news article also indicates that &quot;HAM Operators at Camp X used transmitters to send and receive coded messages from Britain behind enemy lines&quot;.

Hydra sent and received Allied radio (including telegraph) signals from around the world. The Government of Canada later stated that Hydra provided &quot;an essential tactical and strategic component of the larger Allied radio network, secret information was transmitted securely to and from Canada, Great Britain, other Commonwealth countries and the United States&quot;.

The Hydra station was valuable for both coding and decoding information in relative safety from the prying ears of German radio observers and Nazi detection. Hydra also had direct access via land lines to Ottawa, New York City and Washington, D.C. for telegraph and telephone communications. The main transmitter was previously used as that of American AM station WCAU&#x27;s shortwave sibling W3XAU, and upon severance of W3XAU in 1941, the transmitter was refurbished and became the transmitter for Hydra. Other radio apparatus was purchased discreetly from amateur radio enthusiasts, brought to the building in pieces and assembled on site.

After use by the Canadian Forces during the Cold War, the transmitter was scrapped in 1969.

== Post-war use ==
One of the trainees, or at least a visitor, may have been Ian Fleming, later famous for his James Bond books, according to the book &quot;Inside Camp X&quot; by Lynn Philip Hodgson. (While in Toronto, Fleming stayed at a hotel near St. James-Bond United Church, but many believe the name was borrowed from a noted American ornithologist.) There is however evidence against this claim. The character of James Bond was &quot;a highly romanticised version of the true spy&quot; William Stephenson, and what Fleming once learned from him.

Children&#x27;s book writer Roald Dahl and British screenwriter Paul Dehn also trained at the camp.

After it had closed in the fall of 1945, Camp X was used by the RCMP as a secure location for interviewing Soviet embassy cypher-clerk Igor Gouzenko, who had defected to Canada on 5 September and revealed an extensive Soviet espionage operation in the country. Gouzenko and his family spent two years at the facility.

Later, until the buildings were destroyed in 1969, the camp became the &quot;Oshawa Wireless Station&quot; under operation by the Royal Canadian Corps of Signals as a secret listening location. Any records not previously destroyed were stored under the Official Secrets Act. The site, located on Boundary Road in Whitby, Ontario, is now a passive park named &quot;Intrepid Park&quot;. In recent years, the park has been the site of annual Remembrance Day ceremonies hosted by 2 Intelligence Company, a military intelligence unit based in Toronto, Ontario.

A damaged building from Camp X had been found and was being restored in 2016. Artifacts from the spy camp are still occasionally found in the park. In August 2016, a hobbyist with a metal detector uncovered a rusty World War II smoke mortar round, triggering a visit from Canadian Forces Base Trenton&#x27;s bomb disposal team.

=== Memorial ===
The historic plaque erected at Intrepid Park commemorates the school, which taught the techniques of secret warfare, and Hydra, which became an essential communications centre. An adjacent plaque is dedicated to the memory of Sir William Stephenson.

== In the media ==
Camp X has been featured in movies and television programs, including the CBC series of &quot;X Company&quot;, three seasons, 2015 to 2017, and the History Channel&#x27;s documentary &quot;Camp X: Secret Agent School&quot;, July 2014, by Toronto&#x27;s Yap Films. The latter included recreations of scenes and featured interviews with actual individuals who had been associated with the camp.

<text>The London Naval Conference (1908–09) was a continuation of the debates of the 2nd Hague Conference, with the United Kingdom hoping for the formation of an International Prize Court. Ten nations sent representatives, the main naval powers of Europe and the United States and Japan. The conference met from December 4, 1908 to February 26, 1909. The agreements were issued as the Declaration of London, containing seventy-one articles it restated much existing international maritime law.

The signatories&#x27; governments did not all ratify the Declaration and it never went into effect. During the First World War the neutral United States under President Wilson pushed for the major antagonists to respect the treaty, hoping that the good protection in the Declaration for neutral vessels would be enforced.

The most influential figures at the conference were Renault of France, Kriege of Germany, and Crowe of Great Britain.

<doc id="348054" wikidata="Q1430154" url="?curid=348054" title="Cloister">
<text>A cloister (from Latin , &quot;enclosure&quot;) is a covered walk, open gallery, or open arcade running along the walls of buildings and forming a quadrangle or garth. The attachment of a cloister to a cathedral or church, commonly against a warm southern flank, usually indicates that it is (or once was) part of a monastic foundation, &quot;forming a continuous and solid architectural barrier... that effectively separates the world of the monks from that of the serfs and workmen, whose lives and works went forward outside and around the cloister.&quot;

Cloistered (or claustral) life is also another name for the monastic life of a monk or nun. The English term &quot;enclosure&quot; is used in contemporary Catholic church law translations to mean cloistered, and some form of the Latin parent word &quot;claustrum&quot; is frequently used as a metonymic name for &quot;monastery&quot; in languages such as German. Cloistered clergy refers to monastic orders that strictly separate themselves from the affairs of the external world.

==History of the cloister==
The early medieval cloister had several antecedents: the peristyle court of the Greco-Roman &quot;domus&quot;, the atrium and its expanded version that served as forecourt to early Christian basilicas, and certain semi-galleried courts attached to the flanks of early Syrian churches. Walter Horn suggests that the earliest coenobitic communities, which were established in Egypt by Saint Pachomius , did not result in cloister construction, as there were no lay serfs attached to the community of monks, and thus no need for separation within the walled community.

Horn finds the earliest prototypical cloisters in some exceptional late fifth-century monastic churches in southern Syria, such as the Convent of Saints Sergius and Bacchus, at Umm-is-Surab (AD 489), and the colonnaded forecourt of the convent of Id-Dêr, but nothing similar appeared in the semi-eremitic Irish monasteries&#x27; clustered roundhouses nor in the earliest Benedictine collective communities of the West.

In the time of Charlemagne () the requirements of a separate monastic community within an extended and scattered manorial estate led to the development of a &quot;monastery within a monastery&quot; in the form of the locked cloister, an architectural solution allowing the monks to perform their sacred tasks apart from the distractions of laymen and servants. Horn offers as early examples Abbot Gundeland&#x27;s &quot;Altenmünster&quot; of Lorsch abbey (765–774), as revealed in the excavations by Frederich Behn. Lorsch was adapted without substantial alteration from a Frankish nobleman&#x27;s &quot;villa rustica&quot;, in a tradition unbroken from late Roman times.

Another early cloister, in the abbey of Saint-Riquier (790–799), took a triangular shape, with chapels at the corners, in conscious representation of the Trinity. A square cloister sited against the flank of the abbey church was built at Inden (816) and the abbey of St. Wandrille at Fontenelle (823–833). At Fulda, a new cloister (819) was sited to the liturgical west of the church &quot;in the Roman manner&quot; familiar from the forecourt of Old St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica because it would be closer to the relics. More recently, John D. Rockefeller Jr. commissioned the construction of The Cloisters museum and gardens in medieval style in Manhattan in 1930–1938.

<doc id="348075" wikidata="Q796593" url="?curid=348075" title="President of Malta">
<text>The president of Malta () is the constitutional head of state of Malta. The president is indirectly elected by the House of Representatives of Malta, which appoints the president for a five-year term and requires them to swear an oath to &quot;preserve, protect and defend&quot; the Constitution. The president of Malta also resides directly or indirectly in all three branches of the state. They are part of Parliament and responsible for the appointment of the judiciary. Executive authority is nominally vested in the president, but is in practice exercised by the prime minister.

==Establishment of office==
The office of the president of Malta () came into being on 13 December 1974, when Malta became a republic within the Commonwealth of Nations. Queen Elizabeth II ceased to be head of state and Queen of Malta (), and the last governor-general, Sir Anthony Mamo, became the first president of Malta.

==Qualifications==

A person shall not be qualified to be appointed president if:

* They are not a citizen of Malta;
* They hold or have held the office of chief justice or other judge of the Superior Courts;
* They are not eligible for appointment to or to act in any public office in accordance with articles 109, 118 and 120 of the Constitution.

==Assumption of office==
Before assuming office the nominee must take the oath of office before the House of Representatives of Malta.

The oath reads: &quot;I, (name of nominee), solemnly swear/affirm that I will faithfully execute the office of President (perform the functions of the President) of Malta, and will, to the best of my ability preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of Malta. (So help me God).&quot;

==Temporary vacancy==

Whenever the holder of the office is absent from Malta, on vacation, or is for any reason unable to perform the functions conferred upon them by the Constitution, those functions are performed by an individual appointed by the prime minister, after consultation with the leader of the opposition. If such individual has not yet been appointed, the speaker of the House of Representatives performs the duties of the president.

Notwithstanding the above, on the expiration of five years from the date of the appointment to the office of President, the office does not become automatically vacant. The Constitution states that until a two-third majority resolution is achieved in the House of Representatives, the person occupying the office of the President of Malta, shall, in any circumstance, remain in office until the resolution is achieved. With no anti-deadlock provision, it will need to be seen how this provision will be applied in practice.

==Role of the president==

Among the powers of the president:

* The president promulgates laws.
* The president may dissolve the House of Representatives of Malta acting on the request of the prime minister of Malta or following the passage of a no confidence motion in the Government.
* The president names the prime minister with the president making his or her decision based on the situation within the Maltese parliament.
* The president names most members of constitutional bodies (with the assent of the prime minister).
* The president receives foreign ambassadors.
* The president may grant a pardon (but not an amnesty) to convicted criminals; the president can also lessen or suppress criminal sentences, acting on the advice of Cabinet or the minister delegated by Cabinet with such responsibility.
* The president is &quot;ex officio&quot; chairman of the Commission for the Administration of Justice of Malta.
* The president is &quot;ex officio&quot; head of the Maltese honours.
* The president is &quot;ex officio&quot; chairman of the Malta Community Chest Fund, a charitable non-governmental institution aimed to help philanthropic institutions and individuals. The president&#x27;s spouse is the deputy chairperson.
* The president authorises recognition in Malta of honours, awards and decorations. No title of nobility, honour, award, decoration, membership or office may be used in Malta unless it is authorised by the president. The names of those persons so authorized are published in the &quot;Government Gazette&quot;.

The role of the president is detailed in a publication (in Maltese) called &quot;Il-Manwal tal-President tar-Repubblika&quot; written by former president Ugo Mifsud Bonnici.

==Official residences==

The official office of the president is the Grandmaster&#x27;s Palace in Valletta. Other presidential residences include:

* San Anton Palace at Attard – official residence and &quot;de facto&quot; official office.
* Verdala Palace at Buskett – summer residence.

==President&#x27;s flag==

The presidents of Malta used the national flag as their presidential standard prior to 12 December 1988, when a proclamation established the presidential flag of Malta. The flag is flown on the president&#x27;s official residences and offices and on all occasions at which they are present.

==Termination of appointment==

The office of president shall become vacant:
* If the president resigns his/her office;
* On the expiration of five years from the date of the appointment to that office;
* If the holder of the office is removed from office by Resolution of not less than two-thirds of the House of Representatives of Malta on the ground of inability to perform the functions of their office (whether arising from infirmity of body or mind or any other cause) or misbehaviour;
* If the president dies in office.

==The veto anomaly==

The Constitution of Malta nominally does not accord any legislative veto powers to the president. In fact, the Constitution states that when a bill is presented to the president for assent, he shall without delay signify that he assents. The Constitution nominally therefore ensures that the legislative programme of a democratically elected Government of Malta is not shackled by a president without a democratic mandate. The Constitutional law creates this narrative that the president is distinguished from the individual office-holder and the office-holder should set aside his personal opinions in exercise of his/her duties as president. In practice, sitting presidents have nevertheless deviated from this duty and have in instances threatened to resign from their office if presented with certain bills for assent contrary to their personal opinions or have privately lobbied for changes. Furthermore, in view that an incumbent Government of Malta which does not wield a two-thirds majority in Parliament would not be in a position to remove the president of Malta if he refuses to signify that he assents to a bill, the president may in practice be afforded a legislative veto. This would be a constitutional crisis as a president without a democratic mandate would effectively exercise higher political power than the democratically mandated Government of Malta. It would not be clear whether this anomaly would be subject to judicial review by the Courts of Constitutional Jurisdiction in Malta both because of the immunities of the president of Malta and also because of the judicial interest of the sitting Government of Malta in the matter.

<text>Air Transat is a Canadian airline based in Montreal, Quebec. Founded in 1986, it operates scheduled and charter flights serving 60 destinations in 25 countries. Air Transat is owned and operated by Transat A.T. Inc., with 37 aircraft registered with Transport Canada as of September 2023.

==History==
===Early years (1986–1999)===
François Legault founded Air Transat with other business partners such as Jean-Marc Eustache, Philippe Sureau, Lina de Cesare, Yvon Lecavalier, and Pierre Ménard. Legault left the company in 1997 with no forewarning after a dispute with business partners, who only found out after the fact.

Air Transat made its inaugural flight on 14 November 1987, travelling from Montreal to Acapulco. Six years later, Air Transat assumed defunct Nationair&#x27;s maintenance base and aircraft. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Transat A.T. Inc.

===Expansion (2000–2018)===
On 13 February 2009, Transat A.T. announced a five-year partnership with CanJet. Since 1 May 2009, Transat Tours Canada has chartered CanJet&#x27;s Boeing 737 aircraft flying from Canadian cities to various destinations. This replaced an agreement with Calgary-based WestJet.

On 13 February 2011, Air Transat Flight TS163 operated with the airline&#x27;s first all-female flight crew from Cancun to Vancouver. The airline has won many awards, including the 2012, 2018, and 2019 Skytrax World&#x27;s Best Leisure Airline Awards.

On 12 September 2013, Air Transat struck a seasonal lease deal with Air France-KLM leisure carrier Transavia France, covering the lease of up to nine Boeing 737-800s by 2019. The deal, which extends a 2010 winter capacity agreement, called for Transavia France to lease four 737-800s to Air Transat during winter 2014, five in 2016, six in 2017, seven in 2018, and eight in 2019.

Although the first two groups of refugees from Syria arrived in Canada on government aircraft in December 2015, the next two groups were on Air Transat aircraft; the first was Flight TS8500 from Amman, Jordan to Toronto, which departed on 20 December. Air Transat was unlikely to be the exclusive airline chartered by the Canadian government, especially if more than 35,000 refugees would arrive in 2016. A spokesman advised the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; that the company had been confirmed as the airline that would bring the second group to Canada on 21 December. In an Air Transat press release, Jean-François Lemay, the carrier&#x27;s general manager made this statement: &quot;We are very pleased to be the first Canadian airline company to engage in this major humanitarian effort, and to be assisting the Canadian government and international authorities in this way.&quot;

In March 2016, Air Transat&#x27;s head office in Saint-Laurent, Montreal was named among the greenest head offices in North America according to &quot;Corporate Responsibility&quot; magazine.

In May 2017, Air Transat and Flair Airlines were accused by a CBC News story of misleading customers and regulators in Canada and Mexico by marketing and selling nonstop tickets between Edmonton and Cancun. CBC uncovered a letter in which the airlines admitted that they would frequently divert for a technical stop to refuel.

===Recent developments (2019–present)===
In January 2020, &quot;Forbes&quot; Canada named Air Transat in its list of best employers, to eighth place nationally.

====Proposed acquisition by Air Canada====
On 16 May 2019, Transat AT, the company that owns Air Transat, announced it was in exclusive talks to be purchased by Air Canada. An offer was subsequently made by the latter at C$13 per share and another company, Group Mach, offered C$14.
On 27 June 2019, the board of Transat AT accepted Air Canada&#x27;s all-cash bid of C$520 million and did not comment on the C$527.6 proposal from Group Mach because the talks with Air Canada were still exclusive. The deal required approval by two-thirds of shareholders; some major investors and some financial analysts stated that the offer is below the true value of the company. Regulatory and governmental approval would be required for the sale of Transat AT. A May report by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation stated, &quot;regulatory approvals are no sure thing&quot;. If the Air Canada purchase were successful, Air Transat would continue to operate as a separate brand.

By 12 August 2019, Air Canada had increased its offer by nearly 40% to C$18 per share from $13, valuing the acquisition at $720 million (US$544 million), to obtain backing from Letko Brosseau, Transat AT&#x27;s largest shareholder with 19% of the company. The same day, the Quebec Administrative Court of Financial Markets rejected the rival bid from Groupe Mach; on 23 August, a 95% majority of Transat&#x27;s voting shareholders approved the $18 per share Air Canada proposal. The proposed transaction was to be publicly assessed by Transport Canada until 2 May 2020, with the buyout to close after that date.

The buyout was delayed by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the share price of Transat AT fell to $5.16 by July 2020. The buyout had not closed by 13 October 2020, when the two parties agreed to a revised offer of $5 per share, reducing the total value of the acquisition to $180 million.

On 2 April 2021, the deal was dropped following a failure to secure European Commission approval.

==== COVID-19 pandemic ====
On 23 July 2020, Air Transat announced that it would resume its service following a COVID-19 pandemic-induced interruption of 112 days. In January 2021, as the pandemic continued, Air Transat announced it was again suspending its regular operations from 29 January to 30 April 2021 and all operations from 14 February to 30 April 2021.

British consumer site MoneySavingExpert named Air Transat as one of the worst-performing travel firms for refunding passengers whose flights or trips were cancelled. The United Kingdom&#x27;s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), in a report examining the impact of COVID-19 on airline carriers&#x27; treatment of passengers to and from the UK during the pandemic, found that Air Transat was one of the airlines failing to provide cash refunds to passengers whose flights had been cancelled by the airline, in breach of the Flight Compensation Regulation. The regulation requires airlines to refund passengers whose flights are cancelled under any circumstances, including the COVID-19 pandemic; the report also noted that CAA&#x27;s inquiries, while preparing the report, had resulted in Air Transat assuring it that all cash payments would henceforth be handled properly.

==Destinations==
Air Transat specializes in charter flights from 19 Canadian cities to vacation destinations, mainly to 15 countries in the south during winter and in 11 European countries during summer. Also, some destinations are provided all year round by the airline. During the summer season, its main destinations are Europe and in the winter season, the Caribbean, Mexico, the United States, and Central America, though the airline operates many year-round flights to Europe from their Toronto and Montreal bases. Its main Canadian gateways are Montréal–Trudeau International Airport and Toronto Pearson International Airport. The airline also has operations at Halifax Stanfield International Airport, Ottawa Macdonald–Cartier International Airport, and Québec City Jean Lesage International Airport, among others.
===Codeshare agreements===
* Porter Airlines (joint-venture partner)
* WestJet

===Interline agreements===
* Pegasus Airlines
* Volotea

==Magazine==
&quot;Atmosphere&quot; is the semi-annual inflight magazine of Air Transat. It was founded in 2006 and the first issue was published in March 2006. The magazine is published in English and in French. The publisher is Business Class Media. Formerly it was published on a quarterly basis, but then was published semi-annually.

==Fleet==

===Current fleet===
, Air Transat operates an all-Airbus fleet composed of the following aircraft:

===Previously operated===
Air Transat has operated several other aircraft types in the past, including:

==Accidents and incidents==
* On 6 July 2001, Air Transat Flight 906, a Lockheed L-1011 TriStar, made a return to Lyon–Saint-Exupéry Airport after encountering severe hail. The plane returned safely, but was written off. It is still used today for emergency training at Lyon Airport near Lufthansa Cargo.
* On 24 August 2001, Air Transat Flight 236, an Airbus A330-200, en route from Toronto to Lisbon with 306 crew and passengers, piloted by Captain Robert Piché and First Officer Dirk DeJager, made an emergency landing in the Azores without engine power due to fuel starvation over the Atlantic Ocean. The aircraft safely landed at Lajes Air Base, on Terceira Island. The aircraft was evacuated in 90 seconds. All 306 passengers on board survived. An investigation revealed that the cause of the accident was a fuel leak in the number-two engine, which was caused by an incorrect part installed in the hydraulics system by Air Transat maintenance staff. The part did not maintain adequate clearance between the hydraulic lines and the fuel line, allowing vibration in the hydraulic lines to degrade the fuel line and cause the leak. The aircraft involved in the incident was repaired and remained in service with Air Transat until March 2020. The incident went down in history as the longest non-powered flight and landing by a commercial airliner.
* On 6 March 2005, Air Transat Flight 961, an Airbus A310-308, experienced a structural failure in which the rudder detached in flight. The flight crew were able to regain enough control of the aircraft to return safely to Varadero. The investigation that followed determined that the manufacturer&#x27;s inspection procedure for the composite rudder was not adequate. Inspection procedures for composite structures on airliners were changed because of this accident.
* On 18 July 2016, Air Transat Flight 725, an Airbus A310-300, en route from Glasgow to Toronto with 250 passengers, was grounded overnight following the arrest of pilots Captain Jean-François Perreault and Imran Zafar Syed for allegedly preparing to fly under the influence of alcohol. The flight eventually flew under new crew and arrived in Toronto at noon the following day. Both pilots were cleared of all charges in April 2018.
* On 31 July 2017, Air Transat Flight 157, an Airbus A330-200, en route from Brussels to Montréal–Trudeau, was diverted to Ottawa due to a chain of storms passing through the Montreal area. More than 300 passengers were kept on the plane without water, electricity, or air conditioning and rationed food for 6 hours. A passenger called 9-1-1 due to the deteriorating situation, with some passengers complaining of suffocation. Airport authorities responded by delivering water and disembarking passengers, including those complaining of suffocation injuries. Air Transat blamed congestion at Ottawa&#x27;s airport for the situation, where airport administration stated that the pilots asked for no help during the situation. The event enraged Canadian lawmakers pushing to improve Canada&#x27;s passenger bill of rights.

<text>In differential geometry, given a spin structure on an formula_1-dimensional orientable Riemannian manifold formula_2 one defines the spinor bundle to be the complex vector bundle formula_3 associated to the corresponding principal bundle formula_4 of spin frames over formula_5 and the spin representation of its structure group formula_6 on the space of spinors formula_7.

A section of the spinor bundle formula_8 is called a spinor field.

==Formal definition==

Let formula_9 be a spin structure on a Riemannian manifold formula_2that is, an equivariant lift of the oriented orthonormal frame bundle formula_11 with respect to the double covering formula_12 of the special orthogonal group by the spin group.

The spinor bundle formula_8 is defined to be the complex vector bundle
formula_14
associated to the spin structure formula_15 via the spin representation formula_16 where formula_17 denotes the group of unitary operators acting on a Hilbert space formula_18 The spin representation formula_19 is a faithful and unitary representation of the group formula_20

<text>In mathematics, a double cover or double covering may refer to:
* Double cover (topology), a two-to-one mapping from one topological space to another. Frequently occurring special cases include
** The orientable double cover of a non-orientable manifold
** The bipartite double cover of an undirected graph &quot;G&quot;, formed by the graph tensor product &quot;G&quot; × &quot;K&quot;2
** A double covering group of a topological group such as a Lie group, a group extension of index two formed by a topological double cover. A double cover may also be used to refer to non-topological group extensions of index two, for instance extensions of finite groups.
* Doubling space, a possible property of a metric space.
* Cycle double cover, a collection of cycles in a graph that together include each edge twice. The cycle double cover conjecture is the unproven assertion that every bridgeless graph has a cycle double cover.

Double coverage may also refer to:
* Double coverage, a defensive strategy in American football, basketball, and other sports
* Being covered by more than one health insurance plan
* A type of Asphalt roll roofing.</text><links>

<doc id="348092" wikidata="Q5323474" url="?curid=348092" title="EMD SD80MAC">
<text>The SD80MAC was a C-C diesel-electric locomotive. It was powered by a 20-cylinder version of EMD&#x27;s 710G prime mover, and was the second diesel locomotive by GM-EMD to use a V20 engine, since EMD&#x27;s SD45 series. It introduced a wide radiator housing similar to GE Transportation locomotives and the placement of dynamic brakes at the rear of the locomotive, which is a quieter location, features that were incorporated into the SD90MAC and SD70ACe models. Key spotting differences between the SD80MAC and SD90MAC include no external rear sandbox on the SD90MAC, no rear lighted number boards on the SD90MAC, and the placement of the front numberboards (above the cab windows on the SD80MAC, on the nose on most SD90MACs). The SD80MAC also had recessed red marker lights in the nose, an identifying feature unique to Conrail (CR) locomotives, although Norfolk Southern (NS) had removed the lights on most of their former Conrail engines.

All 30 SD80MAC units built were delivered to Conrail, and the 28 production units were completed, tested, and painted at the former Pennsylvania Railroad shops in Altoona, Pennsylvania.
Prior to the 1995 merger with Union Pacific, Chicago and North Western Railway placed an order of 15 locomotives. Canadian Pacific placed an order as well but it was changed to SD90MACs. Conrail planned a second order of SD80MACs, but its new owners changed the order to SD70s and SD70MACs, all of which would be built at the Juniata Shops in Altoona.

Vale Mining of Brazil ordered a set of seven updated locomotives designated as the SD80ACe model. These locomotives feature Tier 1 compliant 20-710G3C-ES engines, with 5,300 HP (3.9MW) @ 950 RPM. The design is currently for export only, and these specific locomotives will run on Vale Mining&#x27;s broad gauge trackage.

Another broad gauge variant also came in 2012 only, that is, the [[Indian locomotive class WDG-5|EMD GT50AC]], also known as the Indian locomotive class WDG-5, a smaller and lighter 135-ton variant, with an up-tweaked EMD 20N-710G3B-EC engine, capable of producing 5,500 HP (4.1MW) @ 910 RPM, to serve the Indian Railways, whose current tracks are weak to handle very heavy locomotives, just like how EMD GT46MAC WDG-4 was developed from SD70MAC by reducing the weight. The seven locomotives of the class were developed indigenously by Banaras Locomotive Works (BLW) of India. The locomotives are not a part of the SD80 series, but are completely based on it, making it the second International application of the V20-710 prime mover, after the Brazilian SD80ACe.

After the split of Conrail in 1999, the SD80MACs were split up between the Norfolk Southern Railway and CSX Transportation. Norfolk Southern received 17 units (numbered 7200–7216) while CSX got 13 (800–812, being renumbered to 4590–4602). The former Conrail units were the first AC traction locomotives owned by Norfolk Southern, with the railroad not ordering more until late 2008 with an order of General Electric&#x27;s ES44AC. In late 2014, Norfolk Southern announced that they had reached an agreement with CSX Transportation to trade 12 EMD SD40-2 units (NS 3425–3447) for CSX&#x27;s remaining 12 SD80MACs, leaving NS as the model&#x27;s sole operator. They were delivered to the NS in April 2015.

In February 2020, following the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic, Norfolk Southern retired all 29 of its remaining SD80MACs, owing to their operational costs. Six units were sold to Canadian Pacific Kansas City (then Canadian Pacific Railway) as parts sources for their recent EMD SD70ACU rebuilds. The remainder of the NS fleet went to Progress Rail and were scrapped. As of January 2022, the Conrail Historical Society was in contact with Canadian Pacific Kansas City Limited hoping to have one SD80MAC set aside for preservation, after failing to make an agreement with Progress Rail.

CSX 4594, formerly CSX 804, and built as CR 4110, was scrapped in January 2014 after being used as a parts donor following a derailment in early 2009.

==Incident==
An NS South Fork crew was securing their engines for the night on Friday, 18 November 2016 when an electrical fire broke out in the cab of NS 7210 (CR 4118). There were no injuries, but the SD80MAC’s cab interior was completely destroyed. The unit was hauled to the Juniata Shops in Altoona where it was buried in a deadline until it was among the units that were sold off to Progress Rail. The unit met its end in December 2021.

<doc id="348095" wikidata="Q3107413" url="?curid=348095" title="Jemima (Bible)">
<text>== Jemimah (Bible) The Eldest Daughter of Job ==
Jemimah or Jemima ( ; ) was the oldest of the three beautiful daughters of Job, named in the Bible as given to him in the later part of his life, after God made Job prosperous again. Jemimah&#x27;s sisters are named Keziah and Keren-Happuch. Job&#x27;s sons, in contrast, are not named.

Job treated his daughters better after his suffering due to gaining the perspective that his daughters were receiving unjust suffering at his own hands, like Job was experiencing with Satan. First, Job&#x27;s sons only received birthday feasts, with an extension to attend for the sisters (Job 1:4). This social inequality may be attributed to the larger patriarchal narrative of the time. Second, Job&#x27;s social status lowered significantly as he suffered, as there was a societal assumption that Job had sinned and was receiving justice from God. As a result, Job gains empathy for his daughters &quot;for being excluded through no fault of one&#x27;s own&quot;. 

With the prologue and epilogue of Job, the ethical evolution of Job can be experienced through his evolving relationship with his daughters. As a natural narrative and ethical conclusion to personal and societal injustices, Jemimah and her sisters were granted inheritances by her father, Job, and described as the most beautiful women in the land (). Apart from these brief references at the end of the Book of Job, Jemimah is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible.

The name Jemimah means &quot;dove&quot;.

In Job 42:14 (ESV):

And he called the name of the first daughter Jemimah, and the name of the second Keziah, and the name of the third Keren-Happuch.

<doc id="348097" wikidata="Q272588" url="?curid=348097" title="Abdullah Ahmad Badawi">
<text>Abdullah bin Ahmad Badawi (, ; born 26 November 1939) is a Malaysian retired politician who served as the fifth Prime Minister of Malaysia from 2003 to 2009. He was also the sixth president of the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), the largest political party (at the time) in Malaysia, and led the governing Barisan Nasional (BN) parliamentary coalition. He is informally known as Pak Lah, &quot;Pak&quot; meaning &#x27;Uncle&#x27; or &#x27;Sir&#x27;, while &quot;Lah&quot; is taken from his name &#x27;Abdullah&#x27;. He was also a Member of Parliament (MP) for Kepala Batas for eight consecutive terms, from 1978 to 2013. During the later part of Abdullah&#x27;s administration, his government faced criticism for economic policies and performance, including concerns about inflation and the rising cost of living.

== Background, early life and education ==
Abdullah was born in Bayan Lepas, Penang to a prominent religious family. Badawi&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Syeikh Abdullah Badawi Fahim, was of Hadrami descent. Syeikh Abdullah was a well-respected religious leader and nationalist, was one of the founding members of Hizbul Muslimin, later known as PAS. After independence, Syeikh Abdullah became the first mufti of Penang after Independence. His father, Ahmad Badawi, was a prominent religious figure and UMNO member. His mother, Kailan Haji Hassan died in Kuala Lumpur at the age of 80 on 2 February 2004. His maternal grandfather, Ha Su-chiang () (also known as Hassan Salleh), was an Utsul Muslim who came from Sanya in Hainan.

Abdullah is a former student of Bukit Mertajam High School. He studied at MBS (Methodist Boys&#x27; School) Penang for his 6th form. Abdullah obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in Islamic Studies from the University of Malaya in 1964.

==Political career==
After graduating from the University of Malaya, he joined the Malaysian Administrative and Diplomatic Corps (the formal term for civil service). He served as Director of Youth at the Ministry of Youth and Sport as well as Secretary of the National Operations Council (MAGERAN). He resigned in 1978 to become a member of parliament for his constituency of Kepala Batas in northern Seberang Perai (which had also been represented by his father).

Early during Mahathir&#x27;s tenure as prime minister, a bitter dispute erupted within the ruling UMNO party and it was divided into two camps, which were colloquially known as &#x27;Team A&#x27;, comprising Mahathir loyalists, and &#x27;Team B&#x27;, which supported former Minister of Finance Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah and former deputy prime minister Musa Hitam. Mahathir prevailed, leading to the exclusion of Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah from the newly established UMNO (Baru) or New UMNO. Abdullah was a close supporter of his political mentor Musa Hitam in Team B and as a result, he was sacked from his post of Minister of Defence in the Cabinet. He did not join the Semangat 46 (Spirit 46) party which was set up by Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah. Semangat 46 is now defunct.

When UMNO (Baru) was formed in February 1988, Mahathir, the UMNO president and prime minister, brought Abdullah into the pro tem committee of UMNO (Baru) as the vice-president. In 1990, Abdullah retained his seat as vice president. During the Cabinet reshuffle in 1991, Mahathir brought him back into the Cabinet as foreign minister. He held this post until November 1999, when Syed Hamid Albar succeeded him. Even though he lost his vice presidency in the 1993 UMNO elections, he remained in the Cabinet and was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs. Prior to 1998, he also served as Minister in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Department, Minister of Education, Minister of Defence, and Minister of Foreign Affairs. On 7 January 1999, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad appointed him as deputy prime minister. Abdullah went on to succeed Mahathir as prime minister in 2003.

== Prime Minister ==

=== First term ===

Upon coming into power as prime minister, Abdullah Badawi promised to clamp down on corruption, thus empowering anti-corruption agencies and providing more avenues for the public to expose corrupt practices. He advocated an interpretation of Islam known as Islam Hadhari, which advocates the intercompatibility between Islam and economic and technological development.

In the 2004 general election, Abdullah scored a significant victory. In the 11th General Election, Abdullah Badawi&#x27;s first as Prime Minister of Malaysia, he delivered a landslide victory for his party&#x27;s coalition Barisan Nasional (of which UMNO is the dominant party) by winning 198 out of 220 seats in parliament and wresting control of the Terengganu state government from the Islamist opposition Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS), as well as coming close to capturing the traditional PAS stronghold of Kelantan. The victory was widely regarded as an approval of his vision of moderate Islam over religious fundamentalism as well as support for his anti-corruption policies.

=== Economic policies ===

Under the Abdullah administration, the country was moving down to a value-chain economy by developing its inherent strengths in agriculture without losing its existing manufacturing base. However, Abdullah was criticized for his handling of the sudden hikes in petrol and electricity prices due to the restructuring of government subsidies, especially as it was detrimental to Malaysia&#x27;s position as a traditional exporter.

=== 50 years of nationhood ===
On 31 August 2007, Abdullah Badawi shouted &#x27;Merdeka!&#x27; during the midnight celebrations of Malaysia&#x27;s 50 years of nationhood. The celebrations were held at Merdeka Square, Kuala Lumpur, where thousands of people had congregated. This was a symbolic gesture which emulated the actions of Malaya&#x27;s first prime minister, the late Tunku Abdul Rahman when the latter declared independence from the British in 1957.

=== Second term ===
Abdullah won a second term as prime minister by winning the 2008 general election, held in March 2008, with a reduced majority. In the 12th General Election, Barisan Nasional won a slim majority of seats but lost its two-thirds majority and also lost 5 states to Opposition Pact. He also lost four additional states to the opposition (Kedah, Penang, Perak and Selangor). Although his party, Barisan Nasional, suffered a major setback, Abdullah vowed to fulfil the promises in his manifesto amid calls from Mahathir, the opposition and even among UMNO members for him to resign. However, his deputy, Najib Razak, and others in his party voiced unreserved support for his leadership. It took a while before open dissent started brewing at grassroots levels, with petitions and campaigns being launched to ask for his resignation.

He was sworn in for a second term as prime minister on 10 March 2008. Abdullah unveiled a streamlined 68-member Cabinet on 18 March 2008, dropping half the ministers in his previous administration and keeping the crucial finance portfolio for himself.

Abdullah faced a political crisis not only from the onslaught of the Opposition which gained much ground by taking the richest and most important states (Selangor and Penang, which incidentally is the hometown of Abdullah Badawi). He also faced growing discontent from within his own ranks in the UMNO party. Mukhriz Mahathir, the son of the former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad, openly called for him to step down. The UMNO Youth chief, Hishammuddin Hussein, did not take any action against Mukhriz and dismissed it as a personal opinion.

On 19 May 2008, the dispute between Mahathir and Abdullah reached a critical stage when Mahathir, who had served as UMNO President for 22 years, announced that he was quitting the party after having lost confidence in Abdullah Badawi&#x27;s leadership, and that he would only rejoin the party after Abdullah had stepped down as UMNO president and prime minister.

On 15 September 2008, Abdullah&#x27;s cabinet Minister in the Prime Minister Department Senator Zaid Ibrahim submitted his resignation letter to the prime minister. He tendered his resignation as a protest to the government&#x27;s action in detaining a blogger, a member of parliament and a reporter under the Internal Security Act. Abdullah later accepted his resignation.

===Retirement and transfer of power===
Abdullah was under heavy pressure to step down after many within his UMNO party including former prime minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad openly asked him to take full responsibility for the dismal performance during the 12th General Election in March 2008. On 10 July 2008, Abdullah announced he would step down as UMNO president and prime minister in mid-2009. He stepped down in favour of his successor, Najib Razak, during the UMNO General Assembly held on 1 April 2009. Nevertheless, shortly before he resigned, Najib gave promises to Abdullah that his constituency in Kepala Batas would continue to receive development funds, where he would continue to serve as its MP.

Abdullah Badawi handed his resignation letter to the Yang di-Pertuan Agong on 2 April 2009. On 3 April 2009, he was succeeded by Najib Razak as prime minister. The Deputy Prime Minister, Najib, was sworn in as the new prime minister the following day. Abdullah was then conferred with a &quot;Tun&quot; title by King Mizan Zainal Abidin for his service to the nation.

== Controversies and issues ==

=== Anti-Corruption ===
Abdullah Badawi&#x27;s administration has been criticised for failing to assert its anti-corruption credentials. After moves to charge prominent figures such as Eric Chia and the then Land and Co-operative Development Minister, Kasitah Gaddam, with corruption, Abdullah Badawi&#x27;s administration&#x27;s efforts to combat corruption allegedly became less transparent. It was noted by the Economist that little progress has been made on curbing corruption.

===Traffic offences===
In 2006, Abdullah was reported to have been charged with 11 traffic offences. Five of the summons were issued for speeding, four for traffic obstruction and two for parking on the wrong side of the road. Abdullah said he was unaware that he had 11 unpaid traffic summonses.

=== Malaysia as an Islamic State ===
In 2007, Abdullah first called Malaysia an Islamic state. Earlier that month he had made another statement, saying Malaysia was neither a theocratic or secular state. A similar statement was made by the Prime Minister on 12 March 2009, where he stated Malaysia was a &quot;negara Islam&quot;. The Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA), a political group representing Malaysian Chinese, expressed reservations over this announcement. The MCA&#x27;s position is that Malaysia is a fully secular state, and that the law transcends religion.

=== Iraq Oil-for-Food scandal ===
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi has been criticised for endorsing his relatives who were involved in abuses related to the Iraqi Oil-for-Food Programme.

=== Nuclear proliferation ===

Abdullah Ahmad Badawi has been criticised after one of his son&#x27;s companies was found to be producing components for centrifuges purported to be intended for use in Libya&#x27;s secret uranium enrichment program.

=== Concerns and disputes by Mahathir Mohamad and UMNO ===
In 2005, it was alleged that under Abdullah Badawi&#x27;s administration, there had been a significant increase in cases of cronyism regarding the distribution of import permits for foreign-manufactured vehicles. Former prime minister Mahathir had called for an investigation of the issue. Later, Mahathir Mohamad criticised Abdullah for cancelling a number of development projects that the former had started, such as the construction of a bridge to replace the causeway linking Malaysia and Singapore.

=== Vote of no confidence to Abdullah Badawi in Parliament ===
On 18 June 2008, the Sabah Progressive Party, a member of the 14-party ruling Barisan Nasional coalition, said its two legislators in the federal parliament will move or back a motion of no-confidence against Abdullah.

Malaysia has never experienced a serious no-confidence vote before and it is unclear what is the next step if, in the unlikely event, Abdullah loses the vote; whether a snap election is held, or whether the King dissolves parliament, or whether a new leader is given the opportunity to form a new government. No Malaysian Prime Minister has ever faced a vote of no-confidence presented by a member of his own coalition before. The Barisan Nasional has 140 lawmakers in the 222-member Parliament, enough to defeat any vote against Abdullah who is also president of the UMNO.

Nevertheless, the motion was rejected by the Speaker on the basis that there were no grounds for the motion to be put forward.

== Personal life ==

On 20 October 2005, Abdullah Badawi&#x27;s wife, Endon Mahmood, died of breast cancer. Endon discovered the disease in 2003 while her twin sister Noraini, who had earlier been diagnosed with the same illness, died in January 2003. She received treatment in the United States and returned to Malaysia 18 days before her death. She is buried at a Muslim cemetery, at Taman Selatan, Precinct 20, Putrajaya.

On 6 June 2007, the Prime Minister&#x27;s office announced Abdullah Badawi&#x27;s marriage to Jeanne Abdullah. On 9 June, a private ceremony was conducted at the Prime Minister&#x27;s residence, Seri Perdana, and attended by close relatives. Jeanne was formerly married to the younger brother of Abdullah Badawi&#x27;s late wife. She was also a manager at the Seri Perdana residential complex and has two children from her previous marriage.

Abdullah has been criticised for allowing his son-in-law, Khairy Jamaluddin, to become unduly influential in UMNO politics.

Abdullah also has been criticised for allowing his brother Fahim Ibrahim Badawi to buy 51 percent of the government-controlled MAS Catering Sdn Bhd. Fahim later sold this stake to Lufthansa&#x27;s LSG Skychef at a huge profit.

He is known also as a poet. His poem I Seek Eternal Peace was translated into more than 80 languages and published as a book.

On 11 September 2022, Khairy said that Abdullah was suffering from dementia, unable to recognize or remember family members, and requires the use of a wheelchair.

<doc id="348100" wikidata="Q3376946" url="?curid=348100" title="Peter W. Barlow">
<text>Peter William Barlow (1 February 1809 – 19 May 1885) was an English civil engineer, particularly associated with railways, bridges (he designed the first Lambeth Bridge, a crossing of the River Thames in London), the design of tunnels and the development of tunnelling techniques. In 1864 he patented a design for a cylindrical tunnelling shield, and obtained a provisional patent in 1868 for an improved design.

==Early life==
Barlow as born at Woolwich, the son of an engineer and mathematician, professor Peter Barlow of the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. Privately educated, winning a Royal Society of Arts medal in 1824 for his drawing of a transit theodolite; he then became a pupil of the civil engineer, Henry Robinson Palmer whom was a founder member of the Institution of Civil Engineers – of which Barlow became an Associate Member in 1826. Under Palmer, Barlow worked on the Liverpool and Birmingham Canal and the new London Docks.

Barlow contributed to the ICE journal, writing on &quot;The strain to which lock gates are subjected&quot; in 1836. He also contributed learned papers to the Royal Society.

His brother William Henry Barlow was a noted 19th-century railway engineer.

==Professional career==
From 1836, Peter Barlow was the resident civil engineer under Sir William Cubitt on parts of the South Eastern Railway, London to Dover line, before taking responsibility for the whole line in 1840, and later becoming Engineer-in-Chief. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in November 1845 as someone who was &quot;Distinguished for his acquaintance with the science of Mathematics as applied to Engineering Subjects&quot;. From the 1850s to the 1870s, Barlow was engineer-in-chief to the Newtown and Oswestry, Londonderry and Enniskillen and Londonderry and Coleraine railways; in the mid-1860s he was also consultant engineer to the Finn Valley Railway.

He investigated construction of long-span bridges, writing a paper on the Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge, before becoming the engineer for the first Lambeth Bridge (1860–1862). While designing the piers for this suspension bridge (since replaced by the current structure), Barlow experimented with driving iron cylinders into the shallow London Clay upon which much of central and north London sits.

This experience led him to look at use of cylindrical devices for tunnelling work and in September 1864 he patented a cylindrical tunnelling shield which offered significant differences to the shield used by Marc Isambard Brunel in constructing the Thames Tunnel (1825–1843).

While Barlow held one patent and one pending, he never actually built any of his own shields. James Henry Greathead (Barlow&#x27;s pupil), independently designed, patented and built the first cylindrical tunnelling shield used on the 11-month construction of the Tower Subway in 1869 and 1870 - the second tunnel under the Thames. Barlow was the engineer with Greathead as the contractor, according to W. C. Copperthwaite in his 1906 book on subaqueous tunnelling. While Greathead built the first European tunnelling shield, Alfred Ely Beach designed and built his own design of shield in New York which closely resembled Barlow&#x27;s 1864 idea but again, independently. All these men were well acquainted with the Brunels&#x27; rectangular shield patent of 1818 and each improved upon the rectangular design in their own ways; in 1869, both Greathead and Beach were the first people to build a cylindrical design for tunnelling shields. The Greathead patent design was a major advance for tunnelling and was different from Barlow&#x27;s 1864 design; the change from a rectangular to a cylindrical design was an obvious advantage, and &quot;the reduction of the multiplicity of parts in the ... shield to a single rigid unit was of immense advantage and an advance perhaps equal to the shield concept of tunneling itself.&quot;

From 1859 to 1867, Barlow lived at No 8 The Paragon, Blackheath, London.

He died at 56 Lansdowne Road, Notting Hill, and is buried in the Kensal Green Cemetery, London. At the time of his death he was the oldest member of the Institution of Civil Engineers.

==Family==
In 1836, on 5 July, Peter Barlow married Bethia Crawford Caffin; they had two daughters, and one son, also called Peter William Barlow (who also became a civil engineer and who emigrated to New Zealand in the 1880s).

<text>Jarvis Branson Cocker (born 19 September 1963) is an English musician. As the founder, frontman, lyricist and only consistent member of the band Pulp, he became a figurehead of the Britpop genre of the mid-1990s. Cocker has also pursued a solo career, and for seven years he presented the BBC Radio 6 Music show &quot;Jarvis Cocker&#x27;s Sunday Service&quot;.

==Early life==
Born in Sheffield, Cocker grew up in the Intake area of the city and attended City School. His father, Mac Cocker, a DJ and actor, left the family and moved to Sydney when Cocker was seven, and had no contact with his son or daughter, Saskia, until Jarvis was in his thirties. Following their father&#x27;s departure, both children were brought up by their mother, Christine Connolly, who later became a Conservative councillor.

Cocker credits his upbringing, almost exclusively in female company, for his interest in how women think and what they have to say. He wrote a song (&quot;A Little Soul&quot; on &quot;This Is Hardcore&quot;) about being abandoned by his father and working briefly as a butler; in 1998, Cocker and his sister travelled to Australia to meet their father for the first time in nearly 30 years.

Mac Cocker was a radio DJ in Sydney, with Double J (later renamed Triple J) in the 1970s and 1980s. By the time of his son&#x27;s visit, Mac Cocker had moved to a hippie commune in Darwin, Northern Territory. Cocker said he forgave his father (who died in 2016) for abandoning them, saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t feel any bitterness towards him at all. I feel sorry for him.&quot; 

For much of the 1980s, Cocker lived on unemployment benefits in a derelict factory. In his twenties, Cocker squatted in London.

==Career==
===Pulp===

Cocker founded the band Pulp originally under the name Arabacus Pulp (named after a tradable commodity he learned about in an economics class) at the age of 15 while he was a pupil at City School. After numerous line-up changes, and shortening the name to &quot;Pulp&quot;, the band eventually found fame in the 1990s with the success of the albums &quot;His &#x27;n&#x27; Hers&quot; (1994) and &quot;Different Class&quot; (1995). Cocker was Pulp&#x27;s frontman, and part of his trademark image was his glasses, which seemed to &quot;stay magically on his face&quot; no matter what antics he performed. This feat was achieved using &quot;a huge rubber band round the back&quot; of his glasses.

Pulp released two more albums (&quot;This Is Hardcore&quot; and &quot;We Love Life&quot;) to critical acclaim, though neither achieved the commercial success of &quot;Different Class&quot;. After releasing a greatest hits album, the band went on hiatus from 2003 to 2010, then returned to activity in 2011.

Cocker is also renowned for his wit and observations of the cultural scene. He was a frequent guest on TV shows in the 1990s, and hosted an art series for Channel 4&quot;Journeys into the Outside&quot;. In the series, he took a trip across the globe, meeting so-called &quot;outsider artists&quot;, people who create wacky and wonderful works of art, trying to understand what compelled them to do so. Cocker&#x27;s penchant for TV appearances was reflected in a parody of &quot;Common People&quot; (&quot;Showbiz People&quot;) which was featured on the satirical comedy show &quot;Spitting Image&quot; in 1996.

====Brit Awards incident====

While attending the 1996 Brit Awards, Cocker and Peter Mansell (a former Pulp member) invaded the stage in a spur-of-the-moment protest against Michael Jackson&#x27;s performance. Jackson was performing his hit &quot;Earth Song&quot; while surrounded by children and a rabbi. Cocker was detained and interviewed by the police on suspicion of assault. He was accompanied by the comedian Bob Mortimer, who was attending the Brit Awards; Mortimer is a former solicitor and represented him in that capacity. Cocker was released without charge.

Opinions in the press on Cocker&#x27;s actions were mixed. Blur frontman Damon Albarn did not approve of Cocker&#x27;s actions, saying he had found them &quot;really disturbing&quot;: &quot;He&#x27;s got some very odd ideas about reality. [...] I think it&#x27;s a collective responsibility to say &#x27;No you can&#x27;t go and do what you&#x27;re doing&#x27;, not just to ridicule him.&quot; &quot;Melody Maker&quot;&#x27;s edition of 2 March 1996 suggested Cocker should be knighted, and Noel Gallagher of Oasis said that &quot;Jarvis Cocker is a star&quot; and should be awarded an MBE. Though a number of people described Cocker&#x27;s stunt as &quot;mooning Jackson&quot;, Cocker denied it, saying that he merely waved his (clothed) bottom. Jackson said about the incident, &quot;I&#x27;m sickened, saddened, shocked, upset, cheated and angry, but immensely proud that the cast remained professional and the show went on.&quot; Cocker said, &quot;My actions were a form of protest at the way Michael Jackson sees himself as some kind of Christ-like figure with the power of healing. I just ran on the stage. I didn&#x27;t make any contact with anyone as far as I recall.&quot; He also clarified that his actions were nothing personal against Jackson and he was even a fan of his music.

On 2 July 2009, soon after Jackson&#x27;s death, Cocker appeared as a panellist on the BBC discussion program &quot;Question Time&quot;. He said that Jackson&#x27;s death had been over-hyped by the media, adding that, &quot;If there&#x27;s a tragedy about the whole thing, I would say [...] if he had kept making great records like he did in the mid-80s up to now that would have been great but for some reason for the last 20 years he didn&#x27;t do that.&quot; When asked what he objected to about Jackson at the time of the Brit Awards incident, he reiterated his earlier comments about Jackson and Christ. When asked, &quot;Otherwise as a performer you thought he was a genius?&quot; Cocker replied, &quot;Yeah, he invented the moonwalk.&quot;

===Solo career===
====&quot;Jarvis&quot;: 2006–2008====

Cocker&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;Jarvis&quot;, was released in the UK on 13 November 2006. At the 2006 Reading festival, the video for &quot;Running the World&quot; was played on the main video screens of the main stage throughout the day, including just before the headline act, Muse, performed. This video contained a karaoke-like presentation of the song&#x27;s lyrics to encourage the crowd to sing along.

In March 2008, Cocker made a short tour of Latin America (Mexico, Argentina and Chile), where he presented a new song called &quot;Girls Like It Too&quot;.

====&quot;Further Complications&quot;: 2008–2009====
Cocker said that he had written &quot;Girls Like It Too&quot; and &quot;The Usual&quot;, and hoped to have enough material to record the follow-up to his solo debut album. He said of the forthcoming studio album: &quot;I&#x27;ve got vague ideas. I&#x27;d like to do another album before the end of the year.&quot;

Cocker debuted a new song, &quot;Angela&quot;, on BBC2&#x27;s &quot;The Summer Exhibition: A Culture Show Special&quot;, on 13 June 2008. On 6 March 2009, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; revealed the cover art and album title for &quot;Further Complications&quot;, which was recorded by Steve Albini and released on 18 May 2009. Drowned in Sound stated that the album was &quot;a huge leap forward&quot; for Cocker.

In October 2011, Faber and Faber published a collection of his lyrics entitled &quot;Mother, Brother, Lover: Selected Lyrics&quot;.

====&quot;Room 29&quot;: 2017====
In March 2017, he released &quot;Room 29&quot;, a collaboration with musician Chilly Gonzales. It was Cocker&#x27;s first album in 8 years. &quot;Room 29&quot; is a concept album about the Hollywood hotel the Chateau Marmont. Cocker stayed in room 29 at the hotel during a Pulp tour in 2012. The room contained a baby grand piano and inspired Cocker to wonder if the piano, possibly having been there for decades, could tell the stories of previous tenants. Each song on the album is a different story of a potential guest. The songs aren&#x27;t all about the glamour of Hollywood, but the potential illusions and disappointments of the industry as well. It was performed as part of the Edinburgh International Festival in August 2017.

====&quot;JARV IS...&quot;: 2017–present====
In late 2017, Cocker formed a new band under the name &quot;Jarv Is&quot;. Along with Cocker himself, the band comprises Serafina Steer (harp/keys), Emma Smith (violin), Andrew McKinney (bass), Jason Buckle and Adam Betts (drums). Primarily a live outfit, the band debuted a range of new material in intimate concerts at festivals in 2017, 2018 and 2019. On 15 May 2019, the band released their debut single &quot;Must I Evolve?&quot;. The band played at Leith Theatre on 22 August 2019 as part of the Edinburgh International Festival&#x27;s contemporary music programme. On 2 March 2020, Jarvis announced the band&#x27;s debut album &quot;Beyond the Pale&quot; on Steve Lamacq&#x27;s BBC Radio 6 show and released the single &quot;House Music All Night Long&quot;. The album was scheduled to be released on 1 May 2020 on Rough Trade Records but this was later changed to 4 September 2020 and eventually the release date was brought forward to 17 July.

On 21 March 2022, Jarv Is released their original soundtrack to the BBC medical comedy-drama series &quot;This Is Going to Hurt&quot;.

===Side projects===
====Musical====
Cocker sang a duet, &quot;Ciao!&quot;, with Miki Berenyi on Lush&#x27;s 1996 album &quot;Lovelife&quot;. In 1997, he collaborated with David Arnold on a cover of &quot;All Time High&quot; by Rita Coolidge, the theme from &quot;Octopussy&quot;. Furthermore, he gained co-writing credits for several songs (&quot;Walk Like a Panther&quot;, &quot;1st Man in Space&quot;, &quot;Drive Safely Darlin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Stars on Sunday&quot;, and &quot;Happy Birthday Nicola&quot;) on The All Seeing I&#x27;s album &quot;Pickled Eggs &amp; Sherbet&quot;, released in 1999. He contributed lead vocals to &quot;Drive Safely Darlin&#x27;&quot;. He also performed live with The All Seeing I on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, singing &quot;Walk Like a Panther&quot; in place of Tony Christie, who sang on the recorded version.

In 2001, he contributed &quot;Everybody Loves the Underdog&quot; to the soundtrack for &quot;Mike Bassett: England Manager&quot;. He re-emerged in 2003 to promote a new album, under the pseudonym &quot;Darren Spooner&quot;, for his new band Relaxed Muscle. The same year, he appeared on the Richard X album &quot;Richard X Presents His X-Factor Vol. 1&quot;. In 2004, Cocker collaborated with Nancy Sinatra on her new album, as well as with Marianne Faithfull on her album &quot;Kissin Time&quot;, with the song &quot;Sliding through Life on Charm.&quot;

In 2005, Cocker co-wrote three tracks (&quot;La Degustation&quot;, &quot;Basque Country&quot; and &quot;Fred de Fred&quot;) on Sheffield-based electronica duo The Lovers&#x27; self-titled debut album. That same year he also covered &quot;I Can&#x27;t Forget&quot; by Leonard Cohen as part of the tribute show for the film &quot;Leonard Cohen: I&#x27;m Your Man&quot;. Cocker also contributed to the soundtrack for &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot;, writing and performing three tracks: &quot;This Is the Night&quot;, &quot;Do the Hippogriff&quot; and &quot;Magic Works&quot;. He appeared briefly in the film as lead singer of the band the Weird Sisters. The fictitious group also featured Jonny Greenwood and Phil Selway from Radiohead, Steve Mackey from Pulp, Jason Buckle from Relaxed Muscle and Steven Claydon from Add N to (X).

In 2006, Cocker appeared on albums &quot;Monsieur Gainsbourg Revisited&quot; (song &quot;I Just Came to Tell You That I&#x27;m Going&quot;, co-performed with Kid Loco) and &quot;Rogue&#x27;s Gallery: Pirate Ballads, Sea Songs, and Chanteys&quot; (song &quot;A Drop of Nelson&#x27;s Blood&quot;). His song &quot;Running the World&quot; appeared over the closing credits of the film &quot;Children of Men&quot;. Also in 2006, along with Steve Mackey, he &#x27;curated&#x27; the two-CD compilation, &quot;The Trip&quot;, which featured a wide selection of tracks by artists as varied as The Fall, Gene Pitney, The Beach Boys, and The Polecats. He also co-wrote lyrics on the Charlotte Gainsbourg album &quot;5:55&quot;, with Neil Hannon and members of Air. 

In 2007 Cocker and Beth Ditto (The Gossip) collaborated on a cover version of Heaven 17&#x27;s &quot;Temptation&quot; at the NME Awards in London. That same year, Cocker contributed to two songs on French electronica group Air&#x27;s album &quot;Pocket Symphony&quot; – performing on &quot;One Hell of a Party&quot; and (with Charlotte Gainsbourg) &quot;The Duelist&quot;. He curated the 2007 Meltdown Festival at the South Bank Centre in London, UK. The line-up he chose included Motörhead, Roky Erickson and the Explosives with Clinic, Devo with Drumsize, Iggy &amp; The Stooges, Cornershop, and The Jesus and Mary Chain.

In 2008, Cocker contributed &quot;Born to Cry&quot;, (originally a Pulp song released on the &quot;Notting Hill&quot; soundtrack CD – though not featured in the film and co-written by Richard Hawley) to Tony Christie&#x27;s album of songs by Sheffield-based songwriters, &quot;Made in Sheffield&quot;. Around 2008, Cocker also participated in a project that tackled the question, &quot;What is Music?&quot;, designed to enter into the debate over the future of the music industry. Cocker asked: &quot;Does this mean that music can now go back to being an art form again? Also, what happens if you get a band to rehearse in an art gallery instead of a rehearsal space?&quot; Consequently, Cocker and his band installed themselves in an art gallery in Paris for five days. Each day, Cocker and his musicians performed a variety of different tasks. These included sound-tracking a relaxation class, inviting local musicians to join them in a jam and arranging activities with local school-children. Films of the exhibition remain accessible online in 2014.

In 2009, he was featured in the animated film &quot;Fantastic Mr. Fox&quot; and sang an original song, &quot;Fantastic Mr. Fox AKA Petey&#x27;s Song&quot;. In 2010, he worked with the National Trust to produce an album of sounds recorded at 11 of Britain&#x27;s historically significant sites. In 2010 he also narrated Prokofiev&#x27;s Peter and the Wolf at the Royal Festival Hall. Cocker sang vocals on the single &quot;Synchronize&quot; by Discodeine, a French production duo. The song appeared on the duo&#x27;s first studio album, released through the on Dirty and Pschent labels on 14 February 2011.

Cocker performed the song &quot;I&#x27;m Still Here&quot; from &quot;Follies&quot; in the HBO documentary &quot;Six By Sondheim&quot;, in a segment directed by Todd Haynes. Cocker, alongside Jason Buckle, wrote, produced and sang backing vocals for the track &quot;Worship Me now&quot; on Marc Almond&#x27;s album &quot;The Dancing Marquis&quot; (2014). &quot;Jarvis is in there whispering over my shoulder like the Devil. It&#x27;s very electro old school&quot; states Almond in an interview with the &quot;Liverpool Echo&quot;. In November 2021, he teamed up with Gucci Soundsystem (a dance music project featuring Riton and Ben Rhymer) for the climate change-inspired &quot;Let&#x27;s Stick Around&quot;, which came with a video filmed in Glasgow around the time of the COP26 conference.

====Music videos====
Cocker has also directed music videos for, among others, Warp Records, including On by Aphex Twin, Sudden Rush by Erlend Øye and Aftermath by Nightmares on Wax (all three were co-directed with Martin Wallace). He also made brief appearances in the music videos for &quot;A Little More for Little You&quot; by Swedish rockers The Hives and &quot;Fifteen Feet of Pure White Snow&quot; by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds.

====&quot;Journeys into the Outside with Jarvis Cocker&quot;====
&quot;Journeys into the Outside with Jarvis Cocker&quot;, a three-episode series, was broadcast in 1999 on Channel 4 and featured Cocker travelling the world to look at various forms of outsider art. Among the many locations he visited were:

*Simon Rodia&#x27;s Watts Towers in Los Angeles, US
*The Rock Garden of Chandigarh by Nek Chand
*The Garden of Eden by Samuel P. Dinsmoor
*The sculpture garden of Las Pozas, Mexico by Edward James
*The land of Pasaquan, created by Eddie Owens Martin aka St. EOM
*Ferdinand Cheval&#x27;s &quot;Le Palais idéal&quot;

The series was directed by longtime collaborator Martin Wallace.

===Broadcasting===

On 3 October 1996, Cocker co-hosted the Australian Saturday morning programme &quot;Recovery&quot; with regular co host (and radio personality) Jane Gazzo.

On 12 October 2006, a fictional version of Cocker was a lead character in a drama on BBC Radio 2, as part of their &quot;Imagine&quot; competition. On 31 December 2008, Cocker guest edited the &quot;Today&quot; programme on BBC Radio 4. He also guested as a panellist on BBC&#x27;s &quot;Question Time&quot; in July 2009.

In October 2009, BBC Radio 6 Music announced Cocker was set to take over the Sunday afternoon slot from 10 January 2010 onwards, with &quot;Jarvis Cocker&#x27;s Sunday Service&quot;. He was quoted as saying &quot;Sunday doesn&#x27;t feel that different to the other days of the week any more. Although there was something weird about when everything seemed to stop on a Sunday, it kind of marked out the week. I am going to put the boringness back into Sunday. That&#x27;s my mission.&quot; Cocker won the Sony DAB Rising Star Award 2010, voted for by listeners, for his BBC Radio 6 Music Show.

In January 2011 he appeared with fellow musician Richard Hawley and DJ Marc Riley on a Radio 4 programme, entitled &quot;In Search of the Holy Whale&quot;, in which the trio embarked on a whale-watching expedition in the sea off Cork, Ireland. Then in 2012, Cocker began &#x27;exploring the human condition after dark with tales of night people&#x27; in the award-winning Radio 4 programme, &quot;Wireless Nights&quot;. As of January 2019, 24 episodes of the programme have been broadcast. The first episode of the series, &quot;Overnight Delivery&quot;, won the 2012 Prix Italia prize for &#x27;extraordinary originality and / or innovation in a radio documentary&#x27;.

Cocker arranged for Iggy Pop to host the Radio 6 Music show in 2014, while he undertook a hiatus that involved Editor-at-Large duties for publisher Faber and Faber. Cocker explained in December 2013:

In 2015, Cocker appeared as part of that year&#x27;s Proms, presenting the &quot;Wireless Nights Prom&quot; from the Royal Albert Hall with the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra.

In December 2017, Cocker presented his last &quot;Sunday Service&quot; programme for the BBC. Announcing the news, he said: &quot;It&#x27;s not goodbye, it&#x27;s just farewell. We wanted to say farewell properly and so we&#x27;re going to do a run of five extra-special shows throughout December, starting this Sunday. Let&#x27;s keep warm together.&quot;

===Acting===
He appears in &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; (2005) as Myron Wagtail, lead singer of the Weird Sisters. His original scene was cut short, but most of the Blu-ray and DVD releases hold the original scene in full-length with the whole 3:30-minute song in bonus features. He also played himself in the 2007 romantic comedy, &quot;The Good Night&quot;. American director Wes Anderson is an admirer of Cocker&#x27;s work. This led to Anderson giving Cocker a role in the 2009 stop-animation movie &quot;Fantastic Mr. Fox&quot; as the voice of Petey, who sings an original song, and whose appearance is based on Cocker himself. He also voices a French pop singer in Anderson&#x27;s 2021 film &quot;The French Dispatch&quot;. 2022 saw Cocker once again doing voice work on a stop-animation film, playing &quot;Developer&quot;, a rat in &quot;The House&quot;, for which he wrote and performed the closing song &quot;This House&quot;. In 2023 he made an on screen appearance as a musical cowboy in Wes Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Asteroid City&quot; and in multiple roles in Anderson&#x27;s &quot;The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar&quot;.

===Journalism and writing===
In June 2011, Cocker was chosen as poetry guest editor for &quot;The Mays&quot; Anthology, a collection of new writing from students at Oxford and Cambridge.

In 2014, he was the Editor-at-Large for Faber and Faber, and &quot;Singing from the Floor&quot; by JP Bean is his first acquisition. Cocker explained to &quot;NME&quot;: &quot;Singing from the Floor portrays an important movement in vernacular culture in the voices of the people who made it happen – and that&#x27;s not an easy task ... JP Bean has captured this moment before it is lost forever, and has made it live again on the page. He&#x27;s a very clever chap. Let&#x27;s raise a glass to him.&quot; Cocker says he writes about &#x27;the little things that stick in your mind&#x27; because most of them are &#x27;eternal&#x27;.

Cocker has also written for &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

In 2022, Cocker published a memoir-cum-&quot;inventory&quot; entitled &quot;Good Pop, Bad Pop&quot;, revisiting his formative years through clearing out his attic; Caroline Sullivan of &quot;The Guardian&quot; described the book as &quot;terrific.&quot;

==Personal life==
Soon after signing to Fire, in November 1985, Cocker fell out of a window while trying to impress a girl with a Spider-Man impression and ended up in hospital, temporarily requiring the use of a wheelchair, in which he appeared during concerts.

In 1988, at age 25, Cocker took a sabbatical from Pulp to study Fine Art and Film at Saint Martin&#x27;s School of Art, where he was tutored by Vera Neubauer and Malcolm Le Grice. He graduated in 1991.

In the late 1990s, Cocker dated Chloë Sevigny. She later said in a 2009 interview:

Cocker lived in Paris from 2003 with his wife Camille Bidault-Waddington and their son. In April 2009 he announced that they were divorcing &quot;on amicable terms&quot;, but that he was staying in Paris to remain in his son&#x27;s life. Cocker had previously lived in Paris in the early 1990s, writing lyrics for Pulp&#x27;s breakthrough album &quot;His &#x27;n&#x27; Hers&quot; there, but he never learned to speak French, according to Bidault-Waddington.

Cocker currently lives in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, with his wife, creative consultant Kim Sion. The pair began dating in 2009 and were married on June 14, 2024, during a performance at Giffords Circus in Chiswick.

Cocker is a supporter of Sheffield Wednesday.

==Activism==
In 2010, Cocker was named Cultural Ambassador for Eurostar. He has been an ambassador for the Edinburgh-based charity Scottish Love in Action (SLA) since 2010. He has also played on the band Everything Is New&#x27;s debut CD. The CD was made to raise money for SLA.

In 2015, Cocker was among the signatories of a pledge committing to Artists For Palestine. In 2016, Cocker voiced his support for Remain in the EU referendum.

<text>The year 1899 in [[science]] involved some significant events, listed below.

==Astronomy and space sciences==
* March 18 – Phoebe, the ninth-known moon of the planet Saturn is discovered by U.S. astronomer William H. Pickering from analysis of photographic plates made by a Peruvian observatory seven months earlier, the first discovery of a satellite photographically.
* April 21 – The nova V606 Aquilae is first observed from Earth as seen within the constellation Aquila. It fades within six months.
* October 19 – 17-year-old Robert H. Goddard in Worcester, Massachusetts, receives his inspiration to develop a rocket capable of reaching outer space, after viewing his yard from high in a tree and imagining &quot;how wonderful it would be to make some device which had even the possibility of ascending to Mars, and how it would look on a small scale, if sent up from the meadow at my feet.&quot;
* December 2 – During the new moon, a near-grand conjunction of the classical planets and several binocular Solar System bodies occur. The Sun, Moon, Mercury, Mars and Saturn are all within 15° of each other, with Venus 5° ahead of this conjunction and Jupiter 15° behind. Accompanying the classical planets in this grand conjunction are Uranus (technically visible unaided in pollution-free skies), Ceres and Pallas.
* The 80 cm refracting telescope is completed at Potsdam Observatory.

==Biology==
* May 1 – The National Trust in the United Kingdom acquires its first part of Wicken Fen, making it the country&#x27;s oldest wetland nature reserve.
* November 8 – The New York Zoological Society opens the Bronx Zoological Park to the public in New York City under the direction of William Temple Hornaday.

==Chemistry==
* Actinium is discovered by André-Louis Debierne.
* International Committee on Atomic Weights established.

==Computing==
* December 31 – Retrospectively, day zero for dates in Microsoft Excel. This is to ensure backwards compatibility with Lotus 1-2-3, which had a bug misinterpreting 1900 as a leap year.

==Exploration==
* January 23 – The British Southern Cross Expedition crosses the Antarctic Circle.
* July 31 – The Southern Cross Expedition and explorer Carsten Borchgrevink first chart Duke of York Island.

==Mathematics==
* June 17 – David Hilbert creates the modern concept of geometry, with the publication of his book &quot;Grundlagen der Geometrie&quot; at Göttingen, proposing a formal set, Hilbert&#x27;s axioms, to replace Euclid&#x27;s elements.
* Élie Cartan first defines the exterior derivative in its modern form.
* Georg Alexander Pick publishes his theorem on the area of simple polygons.

==Medicine==
* Bubonic plague enters Brazil through the seaport of Santos.
* March 6 – Felix Hoffmann patents Aspirin and Bayer registers its name as a trademark in Berlin.
* July 1 – The International Council of Nurses is founded in London, at a meeting of the Matron&#x27;s Council of Great Britain and Ireland.
* October 2 – The London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine is established by Patrick Manson at the Albert Dock Seamen&#x27;s Hospital.

==Paleontology==
* July 4 – The most famous skeleton of a dinosaur ever found intact, a Diplodocus, is discovered at the Sheep Creek Quarry in the western United States near Medicine Bow, Wyoming. The expedition team, financed by Andrew Carnegie for the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh and led by William Harlow Reed, bestows the name &quot;Dippy&quot; on the &quot;Diplodocus carnegii&quot;, which becomes well known after Carnegie has plaster cast replicas made for donation to museums all over the world. These dinosaurs are estimated to have roamed in North America more than 152,000,000 years ago.

==Physics==
* March 3 – Guglielmo Marconi conducts radio beacon experiments on Salisbury Plain in England and notices that radio waves are being reflected back to the transmitter by objects they encounter, one of the early steps in the potential for developing radar. 
* May 8 – Ernest Rutherford publishes his discovery of two different types of radiation, alpha rays and beta rays.
* May 20 – The American Physical Society is founded at a meeting at Columbia University by 36 physicists, with a mission &quot;to advance and diffuse the knowledge of physics.&quot;
* Henri Becquerel discovers that radiation from uranium consists of charged particles and can be deflected by magnetic fields.

<text>Lambeth Bridge is a road traffic and footbridge crossing the River Thames in an east–west direction in central London. The river flows north at the crossing point. Downstream, the next bridge is Westminster Bridge; upstream, the next bridge is Vauxhall Bridge.

The most conspicuous colour in the bridge&#x27;s paint scheme is red, the same colour as the leather benches in the House of Lords, which is at the southern end of the Palace of Westminster nearest the bridge. This is in contrast to Westminster Bridge, which is predominantly green, the same colour as the benches in the House of Commons at the northern end of the Houses of Parliament.

On the east side, in Lambeth, are Lambeth Palace, the Albert Embankment, St. Thomas&#x27; Hospital, and the International Maritime Organization. On the west side, in Westminster, are Thames House (the headquarters of MI5), behind which is Horseferry House (the National Probation Service headquarters), and Clelland House and Abell House (the headquarters of HM Prison Service), and the Millbank Tower and Tate Britain. The Palace of Westminster is a short walk downstream to the north through the Victoria Tower Garden.

==History==


Lambeth Bridge is on the site of a horse ferry between the Palace of Westminster and Lambeth Palace on the south bank. Its name lives on in Horseferry Road, which forms the approach to the bridge on the north bank.

The first modern bridge was a suspension bridge, long, designed by Peter W. Barlow. Sanctioned by an Act of Parliament in 1860, it opened as a toll bridge on 10 November 1862. Doubts about its safety, coupled with its awkwardly steep approaches deterring horse-drawn traffic, meant it soon became used almost solely as a pedestrian crossing. It ceased to be a toll bridge in 1879 when the Metropolitan Board of Works assumed responsibility for its upkeep — it was by then severely corroded, and by 1910 it was closed to vehicular traffic.

The London County Council prepared a masterplan for the area, including a replacement road bridge linking to a widened Horseferry Road, which was authorised by &quot;London County Council (Lambeth Bridge) Act 1924&quot;. Before work had started on the project, the 1928 Thames flood caused extensive destruction of property in the Millbank area. Following the flood the Chelsea Embankment was rebuilt and raised, resulting in some minor redesign of the approaches, and creating the open space to the north of Lambeth Bridge now known as Victoria Tower Gardens South. During the period of delay, the bridge was also redesigned to be able to cope with a higher weight of motorised traffic.

The current structure, a five-span steel arch, designed by engineer Sir George Humphreys and architects Sir Reginald Blomfield and G. Topham Forrest, was built by Dorman Long and opened on 19 July 1932 by King George V. It formerly carried four lanes of road traffic (now reduced to three lanes, one of which is a buses-only lane flowing eastbound) from a roundabout junction by the Lambeth Palace northwards to another roundabout, where the Millbank road meets Horseferry Road .

The bridge is notable at road level for the pairs of obelisks at either end of the bridge, which are surmounted by stone pinecones. However, there is a popular urban legend that they are pineapples, as a tribute to Lambeth resident John Tradescant the younger, who is said to have grown the first pineapple in Britain.

The bridge was declared a Grade II listed structure in 2008, providing protection to preserve its special character from unsympathetic development. The listing designation includes the parapets, lamps, obelisks and the approach walls.

<doc id="348111" wikidata="Q5148591" url="?curid=348111" title="Racial color blindness">
<text>Racial color blindness refers to the belief that a person&#x27;s race or ethnicity should not influence their legal or social treatment in society. 

The multicultural psychology field generates four beliefs that constitute the racial color-blindness approach. The four beliefs are as follows: (1) skin color is superficial and irrelevant to the quality of a person&#x27;s character, ability or worthiness, (2) in a merit-based society, skin color is irrelevant to merit judgments and calculation of fairness, (3) as a corollary, in a merit-based society, merit and fairness are flawed if skin color is taken into the calculation, (4) ignoring skin color when interacting with people is the best way to avoid racial discrimination.

The term metaphorically references the medical phenomenon of color blindness. Psychologists and sociologists also study racial color blindness. This is further divided into two dimensions, color evasion and power evasion. Color evasion is the belief that people should not be treated differently on the basis of their color. Power evasion posits that systemic advantage based on color should have no influence on what people can accomplish, and accomplishments are instead based solely on one&#x27;s own work performance.

At various times in Western history, this term has been used to signal a desired or allegedly achieved state of freedom from racial prejudice or a desire that policies and laws should not consider race. Proponents of racial color blindness often assert that policies that differentiate by racial classification could tend to create, perpetuate or exacerbate racial divisiveness. Critics often believe it fails to address systemic discrimination. 

It has been used by justices of the United States Supreme Court in several opinions relating to racial equality and social equity, particularly in public education. 

==Outline==

A color-blind society, in sociology, is one in which racial classification does not affect a person&#x27;s socially created opportunities. A racially color blind society is or would be free from differential legal or social treatment based on race or color. A color-blind society would have race-neutral governmental policies and would reject all racial discrimination.

Racial color blindness reflects a societal ideal that skin color is insignificant. The ideal was most articulated &quot;along with the emergence of the Civil Rights Movement in the US and anti-racist movements abroad&quot;. Color-blind ideology is based on tenets of non-discrimination, due process of law, equal protection under the law, and equal opportunities regardless of race, ideas which have strongly influenced Western liberalism in the post-World War II period.

Proponents of &quot;color-blind&quot; practices largely believe that treating people equally as individuals leads to a more equal society or that racism and race privilege no longer exercise the power they once did, rendering the need for policies such as race-based affirmative action obsolete.

==Support==

Professor William Julius Wilson of Harvard University has argued that &quot;class was becoming more important than race&quot; in determining life prospects within the black community. 
Wilson has published several works including &quot;The Declining Significance of Race&quot; (1978) and &quot;The Truly Dis-advantaged&quot; (1987) explaining his views on black poverty and racial inequality. He believes that affirmative action primarily benefits the most privileged individuals within the black community. This is because strictly race-based programs disregard a candidate&#x27;s socioeconomic background and therefore fail to help the poorer portion of the black community that actually needs the assistance. He claims that in a society where millions of black people live in the middle and upper classes and millions of white people live in poverty, race is no longer an accurate indication of privilege. Recognizing someone&#x27;s social class is more important than recognizing someone&#x27;s race, indicating that society should be class-conscious, not race-conscious, Wilson argues.

In his famous 1963 speech &quot;I Have a Dream&quot;, Martin Luther King Jr. proclaimed, &quot;I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.&quot; This statement was widely interpreted as an endorsement of color-blind racial ideology. Roger Clegg, the President of the Center for Equal Opportunity, felt that this quotation supported the idea that race-conscious and equal opportunity should not exist, as he believes people should not be treated differently based on the color of their skin. However, not all agreed with this interpretation. American author Michael Eric Dyson felt that Dr. King only believed in the possibility of a color-blind society under the condition that racism and oppression were ultimately destroyed.

Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has supported color-blind policies. He believes the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment forbids consideration of race, such as race-based affirmative action or preferential treatment. He believes that race-oriented programs create &quot;a cult of victimization&quot; and imply black people require &quot;special treatment in order to succeed&quot;.

When defending new voting rights bills in 2020, Republican Texas legislators claimed that since the process they wanted to establish for voter registration did not involve different processes for people of different races and did not involve collecting information about race or ethnicity, their new requirements for eligibility to vote were &quot;color blind&quot; and should not be considered racially discriminatory.

Some argue that the existence of majority-majority and majority-minority areas are not the result of racial discrimination and that this viewpoint ignores the possibility of other factors underlying residential segregation such as the attitude of realtors, bankers, and sellers.

While the field of whiteness studies often discusses alleged failures of racial color blindness, it has been criticized for its focus on reprimanding the white population, whereas similar fields such as black studies, women&#x27;s studies, and Chicano studies celebrate the contributions of the eponymous group.

Among conservative presidents, color blindness as an idea has increased in the late 20th century as well as in the 21st century.

Where racial disparities were once explained in terms of biology, they are now being discussed in terms of culture. &quot;Culture&quot; in this framework is seen as something fixed and hard to change. One example form of rhetoric used in this framework is the argument, &quot;if Irish, Jews (or other ethnic groups) have &#x27;made it&#x27;, how come black people have not?&quot;

Some supporters of racial color blindness argue racial inequality can be supported by relying on cultural, rather than biological, explanations such as &quot;this race has too many babies&quot;. Some no longer view racism as a problem under this belief and see government programs targeting race as no longer necessary due to the avoidance of racism. Bonilla-Silva describes &quot;naturalization&quot; as a frame that portrays racism as a natural outcome of individuals&#x27; choices, and &quot;just the way things are&quot;. While Bonna-Silva himself disagrees with these as &quot;minimization of racism&quot;, these are views common among supporters of racial color blindness.

In response to the global Black Lives Matter movement, the phrase All Lives Matter came into being as a term for racial color blindness. Several notable individuals have supported All Lives Matter, such as NFL cornerback Richard Sherman who said, &quot;I stand by what I said that All Lives Matter and that we are human beings.&quot; A 2015 telephone poll in the US found that 78% of respondents said that &quot;all lives matter&quot; was closest to their own personal views. Despite this, the term was criticized by professor David Theo Goldberg as reflecting a view of &quot;racial dismissal, ignoring, and denial.&quot;

==Criticism==

In 1997, Leslie G. Carr published &quot;Color-Blind Racism&quot; which reviewed the history of racist ideologies in America. He saw &quot;color-blindness&quot; as an ideology that undercuts the legal and political foundation of racial integration and affirmative action. 

Stephanie M. Wildman&#x27;s &quot;Privilege Revealed: How Invisible Preference Undermines America&quot;, writes that advocates of a meritocratic, race-free worldview do not acknowledge the systems of privilege which benefit them, such as social and financial inheritance. She argues that this inheritance privileges &quot;whiteness&quot;, &quot;maleness&quot;, and heterosexuality while disadvantaging descendants of slaves.

Sociologist Eduardo Bonilla-Silva writes that majority groups use color-blindness to avoid discussing racism and discrimination. Color-blindness can be seen as a way to undermine minority hardships, as it used to argue that the United States is a meritocracy, in which people succeed only because they work hard and not their privilege. John R. Logan has disagreed with this notion of meritocracy, as the average black or Hispanic household earning more than $75,000 still live in a less affluent neighborhood than a white household earning less than $40,000 and poverty rates are higher for minorities.

Amy Ansell of Bard College argues that color-blindness operates under the assumption that we are living in a world that is &quot;post-race&quot;, where race no longer matters. She argues this is not true and if it was that race would not be taken into consideration even when trying to address inequality or remedy past wrongs.

Abstract liberalism utilizes themes from political and economic liberalism, such as meritocracy and the free market, to argue against the strong presence of racism. Some suggest it results in people being for equality in principle but against government action to implement equality, described by some sociologists as laissez-faire racism.

Robert D. Reason and Nancy J. Evans outline a similar description of color-blindness, which is based on four beliefs: 1. Privilege is based on merit. 2. Most do not care about a person&#x27;s race. 3. Social inequality is due to &quot;cultural deficits&quot; of individual people. 4. Given the previous three beliefs, there is no need to pay &quot;systematic attention&quot; to any current inequities. They argue the prevalence of color-blindness is attributed to lack of knowledge or lack of exposure. They argue that due to racial separation in housing and education many Americans lack direct contact with present racism.

In &quot;Social Inequality and Social Stratification in US Society&quot;, Christopher Doob argues that racial color blindness&#x27;s proponents &quot;assert...that they are living in a world where racial privilege no longer exists, but their behavior &#x27;supports&#x27; racialized structures and practices&quot;.

Eduardo Bonilla-Silva has argued racial color blindness is insufficient to address racial inequality. He argues it involves egalitarianism while opposing concrete proposals to reduce inequality. He has argued it ignores the under-representation of minorities in prestigious institutions, along with institutional practices that encourage segregation. 

Eberhardt, Davies, Purdie-Vaughns, and Johnson studied implicit racial biases, suggesting people react differently to faces of members of their race compared to members of other races. They found a correlation between race and judicial outcomes and suggest a color blind approach may not actually be possible.

==Research==
Fryer et al. argued that color-blind affirmative action is about as efficient as race-conscious affirmative action in the short run but is less profitable in the long term.

In 2010, Apfelbaum et al. exposed elementary school students to color-blind ideology and found that those students were less likely to detect or report overt racial discrimination. The authors argued racial color blindness allows overt racism to persist.&quot;

Amy Ansell, a sociologist at Bard College, has compared and contrasted the development of the color-blindness in the United States and South Africa. Given that white people are a minority population in South Africa and a majority population in the United States, Ansell expected to see a significant difference in the manifestation of color-blindness in both countries. The thirty-year time difference between the departure from Jim Crow and cessation of apartheid and differences in racial stratification and levels of poverty also led Ansell to expect a clear difference between the colorblindness ideology in the United States and South Africa. However, she concludes contemporary color-blindness in the two countries is nearly identical.

Vorauer, Gagnon, and Sasaki examined the effect that messages with a color-blind ideology had on white Canadians entering one-on-one interactions with Aboriginal Canadians. White Canadians who heard messages emphasizing color-blind ideology were much more likely to be concerned with ensuring the subsequent interaction did not go badly and were more likely hostile, uncomfortable, and uncertain. White participants who heard messages emphasizing multicultural ideology, or the valuing of people&#x27;s differences, asked more positive questions focused on the other person more relaxedly.

==Alternatives==

Researchers also offer alternatives to the color-blindness discourse. Reason and Evans call for people to become &quot;racially cognizant&quot; and continuously acknowledge the role that race plays in their lives. They argue it is important to balance personal identity and a person&#x27;s race.

Researcher Jennifer Simpson argued that &quot;in setting aside color blindness, White [people] must learn to see, accept...the possibility that some of the good, ease, or rewards they have experienced have not been solely the result of hard work&quot; but from &quot;a system biased in their favor.&quot; This conscious exploration of whiteness as a racial and social identity and the acknowledgment of the role of whiteness is connected to modern whiteness studies.

In a recent publication of the academic journal &quot;Communication Theory&quot;, Jennifer Simpson proposed a &quot;more productive dialogue about race&quot;. New dialogue must take a more complex look at race, openly looking at different perspectives on race. Simpson argues white people must engage with other races in discussing the ongoing effects of racism, requiring white people to participate in &quot;communicative behavior that may threaten simultaneously their sense of self and their material power in the social order&quot;.

==In education==
A multisite case study of Atlantic State University, a primarily white institution, and Mid-Atlantic State University, a historically black college, explored color-blind ideologies among the institutions&#x27; white faculty members at the undergraduate and graduate level. In interviews with white faculty members at both institutions, researchers found the faculty often engaged with students from a color-blind perspective, avoiding racial terms but implying them allowed white faculty to label minority students &quot;as academically inferior, less prepared, and less interested in pursuing research and graduate studies while potentially ignoring structural causes&quot; of inequity. The study concludes that color-blind ideology held by school faculty can reduce a student of color&#x27;s perception of their academic abilities and potential to achieve success in STEM disciplines and in graduate school.

A case study of a suburban, mixed-race high school examined the trend toward color-blind ideology in schools among white faculty. It argued white schoolteachers&#x27;s color-blind ideology often masks their fears of being accused of racism and prevents a deeper examination of race.

Case studies of three large school districts, (Boston, Massachusetts; Wake County, North Carolina; and Jefferson County, Louisville) found that the districts&#x27; race-neutral, or color-blind, policies to combat school segregation may disadvantage minorities and &quot;reframe privilege as common sense&quot; while ignoring structural inequalities.

== In U.S. Supreme Court opinions ==

In his dissenting opinion to &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot; (1896), Justice John Marshall Harlan wrote that &quot;Our Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens. In respect of civil rights, all citizens are equal before the law. The humblest is the peer of the most powerful. The law regards man as man, and takes no account of his surroundings or of his color when his civil rights as guaranteed by the supreme law of the land are involved.&quot; His opinion could thus be interpreted as saying that laws should not differentiate between people of different races. His opinion was not the majority-supported decision, which at the time was that laws requiring racial segregation were allowable, establishing the idea that &quot;separate but equal&quot; treatment was constitutionally acceptable.

More recently, the term &quot;color blind&quot; has appeared in United States Supreme Court opinions involving affirmative action, in opinions that support consideration of race when evaluating laws and their effects:
* In a concurring opinion of &quot;Regents v. Bakke&quot; (1978), Justices William J. Brennan Jr., Byron White, Thurgood Marshall, and Harry Blackmun objected to the &quot;color blind&quot; term, writing that &quot;we cannot ... let color blindness become myopia which masks the reality that many &#x27;created equal&#x27; have been treated within our lifetimes as inferior both by the law and by their fellow citizens.&quot;
*In her dissenting opinion to &quot;Gratz v. Bollinger&quot; (2003), Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg quoted from a 1966 5th Circuit decision: The Constitution is both color blind and color conscious. To avoid conflict with the equal protection clause, a classification that denies a benefit, causes harm, or imposes a burden must not be based on race. In that sense, the Constitution is color blind. But the Constitution is color conscious to prevent discrimination being perpetuated and to undo the effects of past discrimination.
*In his concurring opinion to &quot;PICS v. Seattle&quot; (2007), Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that &quot;the color-blind Constitution does not bar the government from taking measures to remedy past state-sponsored discrimination indeed, it requires that such measures be taken in certain circumstances.&quot;
In Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard (2023), the Supreme Court ruled against affirmative action in college admissions, effectively overruling &quot;Grutter v. Bollinger&quot; (2003) and &quot;Regents v. Bakke&quot; (1978). In his concurring opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas affirmed his &quot;defense of the colorblind Constitution&quot; and argued that &quot;all forms of discrimination based on race — including so-called affirmative action — are prohibited under the Constitution&quot;.

<text>Kastro-Kyllini () is a former municipality in Elis, West Greece, Greece. Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Andravida-Kyllini, of which it is a municipal unit. The municipal unit has an area of 49.322 km2. The population was 3,272 in 2021. The municipality Kastro-Kyllini was created in 1999 as part of the Kapodistrias reform from the formerly independent communities Kyllini, Kato Panagia, Kastro and Neochori, that became municipal districts. After the 2011 Kallikratis reform, these municipal districts became (dependent) communities. Its seat of administration was the small port town of Kyllini.

==Geography==

Kastro-Kyllini is situated in the westernmost part of Elis and the Peloponnese, west of Andravida and about northwest of Pyrgos. It covers the northern part of the Kyllini peninsula, which juts into the Ionian Sea. The peninsula is covered with hills, but the area to the east of the peninsula is very flat. The Crusader fortress of Chlemoutsi is situated on the highest point of the peninsula, about above sea level. Between the northernmost point, Cape Kyllini, and the town Kyllini the ruins of the medieval town of Glarentza have been excavated. There are forests and olive groves in the hills. Agriculture is the dominant land use in the plains.

There are several popular beaches on the coast. The thermal springs of Kyllini (&quot;Loutra Kyllinis&quot;) are the largest beach facility in the western Peloponnese. There is a monastery, the Monastery of Blachernae, southeast of Kato Panagia. The small island Kafkalida, near Cape Kyllini, is uninhabited. It carries a lighthouse.

=== Transportation ===
There were two railway lines in Kastro-Kyllini. The Kavasila – Vartholomio – Kyllini railway branched off the Patras – Pyrgos railway at Kavasila, and ran to Kyllini via Vartholomio. A branch line ran from Vartholomio to Loutra Kyllinis. Both lines have been abandoned. Several secondary roads connect the villages.

==Subdivisions==
The municipal unit Kastro-Kyllini is subdivided into the following communities (constituent villages in brackets):
===Kyllini===
===Kato Panagia===
The community of Kato Panagia () consists of the villages Kato Panagia, Ikaros and Moni Vlachernon. The village Kato Panagia is directly adjacent to Kyllini, on the road to Lechaina. The village Ikaros is further east, also on the coast. Refugees from Asia Minor settled in Kato Panagia as a result of the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922).

===Kastro===

The community of Kastro () consists of the town Kastro and the small villages Analipsi, Kalamia, Karavaki, Loutra Kyllinis and Psili Rachi. Kastro is south of Kyllini and northwest of Vartholomio. It is situated in the hills, and is dominated by the Chlemoutsi fortress. The name &quot;Kastro&quot; means &quot;castle&quot;, and refers to Chlemoutsi. The fortress was built by prince Geoffrey I Villehardouin of the Principality of Achaea in 1220-1223, who called it &quot;Clairmont&quot; (from which &quot;Chlemoutsi&quot; is a derivation ). After the decline of the Principality the castle gradually lost its importance. Today it is as a monument and is sometimes used for concerts.

The thermal springs of Kyllini (Loutra Kyllinis) are southwest of Kastro, near the coast. It is a beach resort, surrounded by forests. The most famous baths also offers inhalation therapy, said to assist in asthma and skin problems. It is situated next to Roman ruins.

===Neochori===
The community of Neochori () consists of the villages Neochori and Vytinaiika. Neochori is on the road from Kyllini to Lechaina, southeast of Kyllini and southwest of Lechaina. It is southwest of Myrsini and north of Machos. Neochori is in a flat, rural area.

<text>Athole Dane Shearer Hawks (November 20, 1900 – March 17, 1985) was a Canadian-American actress and socialite, who was the sister of motion picture star Norma Shearer and MGM film sound engineer Douglas Shearer.

== Early life ==
Athole Dane Shearer was born in 1900 in Montreal, Quebec. Her parents divorced when she was a teenager, her brother Douglas remained with their father Andrew in Canada, and she and her sister Norma moved to New York City with their mother Edith. The latter hoped to get her daughters into show business.

== Film career ==
In 1920, the sisters appeared as extras and in bit parts in productions filmed in New York, New Jersey, and Florida, but Edith moved with them to California with the intention of securing contracts with one of the studios in Hollywood.

Shearer&#x27;s appearances in productions in the eastern United States consisted of only small uncredited roles in three films, the first being as a schoolgirl in &quot;The Flapper&quot;, a silent comedy released by Selznick Pictures Corporation. In California, Athole&#x27;s acting career essentially ended, never achieving the success experienced by Norma at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

== Bipolar disorder ==
A contributing factor to Shearer&#x27;s limited work in motion pictures was her persistent medical issues, most notably her long struggle with bipolar disorder, from which her father most likely also suffered. Her condition and personal problems associated with the illness proved to be detrimental to her film career. Ultimately, Shearer spent many years in mental institutions until her disorder was diagnosed.

== Personal life ==
In 1923, Shearer married John Ward, with whom she had a son, Peter. The couple divorced in 1928; and on May 30 that year she married again, this time to film director Howard Hawks, with whom she had two more children: David, born in 1929, and Barbara, born in 1935. She and Hawks divorced in 1940, reportedly due to Hawks&#x27; affair with New York and Hollywood socialite Nancy &quot;Slim&quot; Gross, whom he later married.

== Death ==
Shearer died in 1985 in Los Angeles, and she was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.

== Filmography ==
* &quot;The Flapper&quot; (1920)
* &quot;Way Down East&quot; (1920)
* &quot;The Restless Sex&quot; (1920)

<text>Eric Honeywood Partridge (6 February 1894 – 1 June 1979) was a New Zealand–British lexicographer of the English language, particularly of its slang. His writing career was interrupted only by his service in the Army Education Corps and the RAF correspondence department during World War II.

==Early life==
Partridge was born in the Waimata Valley, near Gisborne, on the North Island of New Zealand to John Thomas Partridge, a grazier, and his wife Ethel Annabella Norris. In 1908 the family moved to Queensland, Australia, where he was educated at the Toowoomba Grammar School. He studied classics and then French and English at the University of Queensland.

During this time Partridge also worked for three years as a schoolteacher before enrolling in the Australian Imperial Force in April 1915 and serving in the Australian infantry during the First World War, in Egypt, Gallipoli and on the Western Front, before being wounded in the Battle of Pozières. His interest in slang and the &quot;underside&quot; of language is said to date from his wartime experience. Partridge returned to university between 1919 and 1921, when he received his BA.

==Career==
After receiving his degree, Partridge became Queensland Travelling Fellow at Balliol College, Oxford, where he worked on both an MA on eighteenth-century English romantic poetry, and a B.Litt in comparative literature. He subsequently taught in a grammar school in Lancashire for a brief interval, then in the two years beginning September 1925, took lecturing positions at the Universities of Manchester and London. From 1923, he &quot;found a second home&quot;, occupying the same desk (K1) in the British Museum Library (as it was then known) for the next fifty years. In 1925 he married Agnes Dora Vye-Parminter, who in 1933 bore a daughter, Rosemary Ethel Honeywood Mann. In 1927 he founded the Scholartis Press, which he managed until it closed in 1931.

During the twenties he wrote fiction under the pseudonym &#x27;Corrie Denison&#x27;; &quot;Glimpses&quot;, a book of stories and sketches, was published by the Scholartis Press in 1928. The Scholartis Press published more than 60 books in these four years, including &quot;Songs and Slang of the British Soldier 1914-1918&quot;, which Partridge co-authored with John Brophy. From 1932 he commenced writing in earnest. His next major work on slang, &quot;Slang Today and Yesterday&quot;, appeared in 1933, and his well-known &quot;Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English&quot; followed in 1937.

During the Second World War, Partridge served in the Army Education Corps, later transferring to the RAF&#x27;s correspondence department, before returning to his British Museum desk in 1945.

Partridge wrote more than forty books on the English language, including well-known works on etymology and slang. He also wrote books on tennis, which he played well. His papers are archived at the University of Birmingham, British Library, King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, the Royal Institute of British Architects, the University of Exeter, the University of San Francisco, Warwickshire Record Office, and William Salt Library.

He died in Moretonhampstead, Devon, in 1979, aged 85.

<text>In microeconomics and consumer theory, a Giffen good is a product that people consume more of as the price rises and vice versa, violating the law of demand. 

For ordinary goods, as the price of the good rises, the substitution effect makes consumers purchase less of it, and more of substitute goods; the income effect can either reinforce or weaken this decline in demand, but for an ordinary good never outweighs it. By contrast, a Giffen good is so strongly an inferior good (in higher demand at lower incomes) that the contrary income effect more than offsets the substitution effect, and the net effect of the good&#x27;s price rise is to increase demand for it. This phenomenon is known as the Giffen paradox.

==Background==

Giffen goods are named after Scottish economist Sir Robert Giffen, to whom Alfred Marshall attributed this idea in his book &quot;Principles of Economics&quot;, first published in 1890. Giffen first proposed the paradox from his observations of the purchasing habits of the Victorian era poor.

It has been suggested by Etsusuke Masuda and Peter Newman that Simon Gray described &quot;Gray goods&quot; in his 1815 text entitled &quot;The Happiness of States: Or An Inquiry Concerning Population, The Modes of Subsisting and Employing It, and the Effects of All on Human Happiness&quot;. The chapter entitled &quot;A Rise in the Price of Bread Corn, beyond a certain Pitch, tends to increase the Consumption of it,&quot; contains a detailed account of what have come to be called Giffen goods, and which might better be called Gray goods. They also note that George Stigler corrected Marshall&#x27;s misattribution in a 1947 journal article on the history.

==Analysis==

For almost all products, the demand curve has a negative slope: as the price increases, quantity demanded for the good decreases.

Giffen goods are the exception to this general rule. Unlike other goods or services, the price point at which supply and demand meet results in higher prices and greater demand whenever market forces recognize a change in supply and demand for Giffen goods. As a result, when price goes up, the quantity demanded also goes up. To be a true Giffen good, the good&#x27;s price must be the only thing that changes to produce a change in quantity demanded. 

Giffen goods should not be confused with Veblen goods: Veblen goods are products whose demand increases if their price increases because the price is seen as an indicator of &quot;quality&quot; or &quot;status.&quot;

The classic example given by Marshall is of inferior quality staple foods, whose demand is driven by poverty that makes their purchasers unable to afford superior foodstuffs. As the price of the cheap staple rises, they can no longer afford to supplement their diet with better foods, and must consume more of the staple food.

There are three necessary conditions for this situation to arise:
# the good in question must be an inferior good,
# there must be a lack of close substitute goods, and
# the goods must constitute a substantial percentage of the buyer&#x27;s income, but not such a substantial percentage of the buyer&#x27;s income that none of the associated normal goods are consumed.

If precondition #1 is changed to &quot;The goods in question must be so inferior that the income effect is greater than the substitution effect&quot; then this list defines necessary and sufficient conditions. The last condition is a condition on the buyer rather than the goods itself, and thus the phenomenon is also called a &quot;Giffen behavior&quot;.

==Examples==
Suppose a consumer has a budget of $6 per day that they spend on food. They must eat three meals a day, and there are only two options for them: the inferior good, bread, which costs $1 per meal, and the superior good, cake, which costs $4 per meal. Cake is always preferable to bread. At present, the consumer would purchase 2 loaves of bread and one cake, completely exhausting their budget to fill 3 meals each day. Now, if the price of bread were to rise from $1 to $2, then the consumer would have no choice but to give up cake, and spend their entire budget on 3 loaves of bread, in order to eat three meals a day. In this situation, their consumption of bread would have actually increased as a result of the price increase. Thus bread would be a Giffen good in this example.

Investor Rob Arnott said in 2021 that the stock market is a Giffen good. Widespread interest in the market tends to increase during periods of rising prices for stocks and decrease during market crashes, which is contrary to ideal investing practices.

==Empirical evidence==
Evidence for the existence of Giffen goods has generally been limited. A 2008 paper by Robert Jensen and Nolan Miller argued rice and wheat noodles were Giffen goods in parts of China. Another 2008 paper by the same authors experimentally demonstrated the existence of Giffen goods among people at the household level by directly subsidizing purchases of rice and wheat flour for extremely poor families. In this paper, the field experiment conducted in 2007 consisted of the province of Hunan, where rice is a dietary staple, and the province of Gansu, where wheat is a staple. In both provinces, random households were selected and were offered their dietary staple at subsidized rates. After the completion of the project, it could be found that the demands from Hunan households who were offered the rice fell drastically. Meanwhile, the demands of wheat in Gansu implies weak evidence of the Giffen paradox.

In 1991, Battalio, Kagel, and Kogut published an article arguing that quinine water is a Giffen good for some lab rats. However, they were only able to show the existence of a Giffen good at an individual level and not the market level.

Giffen goods are difficult to study because the definition requires a number of observable conditions. One reason for the difficulty in studying market demand for Giffen goods is that Giffen originally envisioned a specific situation faced by individuals in poverty. Modern consumer behaviour research methods often deal in aggregates that average out income levels, and are too blunt an instrument to capture these specific situations. Complicating the matter are the requirements that availability of substitutes be limited and that consumers be not so poor that they can only afford the inferior good. For this reason, many text books use the term &quot;Giffen paradox&quot; rather than &quot;Giffen good.&quot;

Some types of premium goods (such as expensive French wines, or celebrity-endorsed perfumes) are sometimes called Giffen goods via the claim that lowering the price of these high-status goods decreases demand because they are no longer perceived as exclusive or high-status products. However, to the extent that the perceived nature of such high-status goods actually changes significantly with a substantial price drop, this behavior disqualifies them from being considered Giffen goods, because the Giffen goods analysis assumes that only the consumer&#x27;s income or the relative price level changes, not the nature of the good itself. If a price change modifies consumers&#x27; perception of the good, they should be analysed as Veblen goods. Some economists question the empirical validity of the distinction between Giffen and Veblen goods, arguing that whenever there is a substantial change in the price of a good its perceived nature also changes, since price is a large part of what constitutes a product. However, the theoretical distinction between the two types of analysis remains clear, and which one should apply to any actual case is an empirical matter. Based on microeconomic consumer theory, it assumes that the consumer could value a good without knowing the price. However, when the consumers who were constrained by income and price need to choose the optimal goods, the goods must be valued with available prices. Because, in some degrees, the higher price indicates higher values of goods offering to the consumers.

===Great Famine in Ireland===
Potatoes during the Irish Great Famine were once considered to be an example of a Giffen good. Along with the Famine, the price of potatoes and meat increased subsequently. Compared to meat, it is obvious that potatoes could be much cheaper as a staple food. Due to poverty, individuals could not afford meat anymore; therefore, demand for potatoes increased. Under such a situation, the supply curve will increase with the rise in potatoes’ price, which is consistent with the definition of Giffen good. However, Gerald P. Dwyer and Cotton M. Lindsey challenged this idea in their 1984 article &quot;Robert Giffen and the Irish Potato&quot;, where they showed the contradicting nature of the Giffen &quot;legend&quot; with respect to historical evidence.

The Giffen nature of the Irish potato was also later discredited by Sherwin Rosen of the University of Chicago in his 1999 paper &quot;Potato Paradoxes&quot;. Rosen showed that the phenomenon could be explained by a normal demand model.

Charles Read has shown with quantitative evidence that bacon pigs showed Giffen-style behaviour during the Irish Famine, but that potatoes did not.

===Other proposed examples===
Anthony Bopp (1983) proposed that kerosene, a low-quality fuel used in home heating, was a Giffen good. Schmuel Baruch and Yakar Kanai (2001) suggested that &quot;shochu&quot;, a Japanese distilled beverage, could be a Giffen good. In both cases, the authors offered supporting econometric evidence. However, this evidence is considered incomplete.

A good may be a Giffen good at the individual level but not at the aggregate level (or vice-versa). As shown by Hildenbrand&#x27;s model, aggregate demand will not necessarily exhibit any Giffen behavior even when we assume the same preferences for each consumer, whose nominal wealth is uniformly distributed on an interval containing zero. This could explain the presence of Giffen behavior for individual consumers but the absence in aggregate data.

<doc id="348130" wikidata="Q2296479" url="?curid=348130" title="Super Dave Osborne">
<text>Super Dave Osborne is a character created and played by comedian Bob Einstein. Einstein&#x27;s comedic depiction was of a naive, although always optimistic, stuntman who was frequently, comically injured when his stunts went spectacularly wrong.

==Character sketch==
Super Dave is billed as an &quot;accomplished&quot; stuntman, although he rarely succeeded when performing his elaborate stunts. Typically, the character would perform outrageous daredevil stunts, which often went disastrously awry resulting in the appearance of grievous bodily injury. These included such mishaps as being knocked off the top of the enormously high CN Tower, in Toronto, after determining it was too windy to do a cabled jump or being run over by a steamroller after failing to escape from inside a locked trunk. After such a mishap, Super Dave would usually appear torn apart, stretched, or otherwise injured. Although Super Dave initially exhibited and was injured during wild stunts, in later appearances, he would often be injured in mishaps during much more mundane events during which danger was not anticipated.

His signature logo, a caricature of his head inside a crash helmet directly atop a pair of crushed silver boots with no visible body, was from an iconic early sketch, &quot;Balloon Ball&quot;, a &quot;stunt&quot; consisting of his standing in a hole in the ground reciting &quot;Balloon Ball&quot; as a which was supposed to imbue him with the ability to not be harmed by anything, as a mobile pile driver rammed the top of his head a number of times. When pulled out of the hole, he then appeared as his eventual logo depicted: his helmeted head sitting directly atop his smashed down silver boots, the whole of his body supposedly compressed between boots and neck.

Super Dave is often accompanied on his various exploits by a loyal friend, sidekick, and assistant stunt coordinator Fuji Hakayito (played by comedian Art Irizawa), and his segments are introduced and commentated on by former sportscaster/actor Mike Walden. Fuji typically initiates whatever stunt Dave is performing.

Super Dave operated his fictional &quot;Super Dave Compound&quot;, a combination resort, theme park, learning center, and anything else needed for the plot-line of a particular episode. Many of his misadventures were based on demonstrating various aspects of the compound. Another characteristic was the utterance of the phrase &quot;Holy Chim&quot; (a bowdlerized version of &quot;holy shit&quot;), usually when the stunt was ongoing and he realized he was in over his head, notably his barefoot fire-walker stunt. When reflecting on the failed stunt, Super Dave would, in annoyance, call Walden a putz.

Trademark components of the Super Dave character include his frequent thumbs-ups and his many jump suit uniforms — most of which include red, white and blue, yellow stars, and stripes — which are reminiscent of those worn by daredevil Evel Knievel. It was often specified that Osborne&#x27;s safety harnesses or seatbelts were made of &quot;genuine Saskatchewan sealskin bindings&quot;. Seals are not indigenous to the landlocked province of Saskatchewan, and are therefore part of the comedic juxtaposition predicated on the eventual failure of the stunt by being both &quot;genuine sealskin&quot; and from Saskatchewan.

* Super Dave was featured in Nike commercials in 1990, comparing his latest dunking contraptions to the Nike Air Flight basketball shoe, and appearing with such NBA stars as Reggie Miller, Kenny Smith, and Gerald Wilkins (whom he called Roger, Bennie, and Harold, respectively, and was then corrected by Mike Walden). When his contraption went wrong, he either went through the wall, the ceiling, or into a backboard, then he would say he hurt or broke an unusual part of his body, to which Walden would confirm, &quot;Well, of course you did!&quot;
* On several occasions in the late 1990s, Super Dave appeared in commercials for Haggar Clothing. Some notable stunts: going through an extreme car wash, and falling off a motor home with much heavy debris landing on him to show that Haggar&#x27;s cotton-based clothing will never wrinkle.

Since there is no time wasted in cuing, the needle drop allows faster movements by the DJ. The needle drop method was developed in the 1970s by Grand Wizzard Theodore at around the same time that he and Grandmaster Flash were pioneering scratching.

==Sticker method==
In the sticker method of locating the sample or break, a DJ uses a colored &quot;dot&quot; label to mark the sample to be used. Marking a record involves several steps. The first step is to locate the desired sample. The second step is much more critical; the sample is located, then the record is brought about an inch or two backwards from the beginning of the sample. The dot is carefully placed up against the stylus (needle) and a feather touch is applied to keep the label in place. Too hard of an application may lead to the needle being misplaced on the record, slipping to the next several grooves, an undesired result. After the needle is removed from the dot, the label can be pressed into place more permanently. If the DJ ever wishes to remove the dot, residue can be removed from the record with a record cleaner solution.

<text>Borehamwood (, historically also Boreham Wood) is a town in southern Hertfordshire, England, from Charing Cross. Borehamwood has a population of 36,322, and is within the London commuter belt. The town&#x27;s film and TV studios are commonly known as Elstree Studios.

==History==
One of the earliest mentions of Bosci de Boreham (Wood of Boreham), is in 1188:
:&quot;In 1188 Pope Clement granted to the kitchen of the monastery the whole land of Elstree. He also gave to the Abbey the wood of Boreham for the feeding of the swine.&quot;

In 1776, the House of Lords granted:
:&quot;An Act for dividing and closing the Common or Waste Ground, called Boreham Wood Common, in the Parish of Elstree otherwise Idletree, in the County of Hertford.&quot;

Borehamwood was historically part of the parish of Elstree. A separate ecclesiastical parish of &quot;All Saints, Boreham Wood&quot; was created on 26 February 1909, covering the part of Elstree parish east of the Midland Railway. Despite this change to the ecclesiastical boundaries, Borehamwood remained part of the civil parish of Elstree. The name of the civil parish was changed to Elstree and Borehamwood on 24 February 1982. The ecclesiastical parishes of Borehamwood and Elstree were reunited on 1 April 2005, also under the name &quot;Elstree and Borehamwood&quot;.

From the 1920s onwards, the town became known as one of the main centres of the UK film, and later television, industries due to the presence of production studios.

Following the Second World War, the town&#x27;s population greatly increased, with large areas of council housing set up for displaced Londoners, many of which are now in private ownership. Fast train connections to central London have resulted in the town becoming a primarily residential suburb. In 1946, the Admiralty started to build highly secret high-performance electronic digital computers at Borehamwood in a redundant wartime factory, firstly for the purpose of real-time gunnery control, and later for surface-to-air guided weapons and missiles, and for specialist cryptography and code-breaking computers for GCHQ.

Borehamwood is currently undergoing a substantial housing transformation which has seen hundreds of new homes built over the last five years. Two further developments are being built and more are expected.

In addition to the studios, the town is home to many retail shops, hotels, restaurants, offices and light industry. The hotels cater mainly to tourists visiting the Elstree Studios, attendees of the television shows being recorded in the Elstree Studios, and London visitors due to the proximity to London and the considerable lower accommodation rates.

There is one weekly newspaper, the &quot;Borehamwood &amp; Elstree Times&quot;.

==Transport==
On the west side of Borehamwood is Elstree &amp; Borehamwood railway station (TfL Zone 6) served by trains operated by Govia Thameslink Railway on the Thameslink route.

Metroline for London buses runs its number 107 service through the town from New Barnet to Edgware and back. Metroline for London buses also operate Number 292 which goes to Colindale and Rossington Avenue. Uno (Bus Company) run a bus service that stops at Borehamwood (route 601) going to Welwyn Garden City via St Albans and back. The 644 service also runs from Hatfield to Queensbury via Borehamwood. Intalink operate a bus service to other parts of Hertfordshire.

The A1 road passes just to the east of the town, and the M25 motorway passes about north of it.

==Demographics==

In the 2011 census, the population was 31,955; this rose to 36,322 in 2021, an increase of 13.67%. Borehamwood is the most populated town in Hertsmere, ahead of Bushey. The Jewish community numbers in excess of 6,100, up from just 3,900 in 2011; combined with neighbouring Elstree, the community counts around 8,000 individuals.

==Film industry==


Since the 1914, the town has been home to several film studios and many shots of its streets are included in final cuts of 20th century British films. This earned it the nickname of the &quot;British Hollywood&quot;. Whilst most of these studios, collectively known as &quot;Elstree Studios&quot;, have now closed, two still remain.

Many films were shot at the studios on Shenley Road including &quot;The Dam Busters&quot; (1955), &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977, and subsequent films in the franchise), &quot;Moby Dick&quot; (1956), &quot;Summer Holiday&quot; (1963), and &quot;The Shining&quot; (1980) starring Jack Nicholson, some of the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; films. The facility was partly demolished in the 1980s to make way for a Tesco Extra supermarket on one side and an office block complex on the other.

The area between the supermarket and the office blocks is all that remains of the original studio, which has been much reduced in size and usefulness to production companies as a result. The Shenley Road Studios were later used for the TV series &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; and &quot;Big Brother&quot;, as well as several major feature films. The &quot;Inspector Morse&quot; TV series&#x27; production offices were based in the studios and, although the series was set in Oxford, several exterior locations (banks, shops etc.) were filmed in the streets of Borehamwood.

The former British National Studios off Clarendon Road, referred to locally as &quot;The Douglas Fairbanks studios&quot; (which were bought by Lew Grade&#x27;s ATV in May 1958), are now the BBC Elstree Centre. The studios have, over the years, been home to Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s film &quot;Blackmail&quot;, Jim Henson&#x27;s TV series &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; was also produced there, and now BBC&#x27;s popular soap, &quot;EastEnders&quot; and their medical drama &quot;Holby City&quot;. An episode of &quot;Judge John Deed&quot; included scenes of the Tesco Extra, but with Borehamwood crossed out and Lewes written in its place.

Several other studios including the Gate Studios and the Danziger Studios at nearby Elstree have been demolished. The Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer British Studios complex (demolished in the early 1970s) saw the production of many films, including &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968), &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot; (1968) and &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot; (1969), as well as ITV television series such as &quot;The Prisoner&quot; (1967–68).

The newer Millennium Studios were situated on Elstree Way, Borehamwood.

==Notable companies==
The UK headquarters of Pizza Hut restaurants is based in the town, the head office of the delivery portion having moved to nearby St Albans in 2015; and, until 2003, so were the headquarters of the United Kingdom subsidiary of T-Mobile, with both being based in the office blocks standing on part of what used to be the old Elstree Studios. Regent Inns has its head office on Elstree Way. George Wimpey also has offices within the town. The takeaway delivery company Just Eat also has an office in the town in the same complex as Pizza Hut. Since 2015, Borehamwood has also been home to the UK subsidiary of the olive oil brand, Filippo Berio.

<doc id="348138" wikidata="Q5599826" url="?curid=348138" title="Great Raft">
<text>The Great Raft was an enormous log jam or series of &quot;rafts&quot; that clogged the Red and Atchafalaya rivers in North America from perhaps the 12th century until its removal in the 1830s. It was unique in North America in terms of its scale.

==Origin==
The Great Raft possibly began forming in the 12th century, or earlier. It grew from its upper end, while decaying or washing out at the lower end. By the early 1830s, it spanned more than . The raft, at one point, extended for from Loggy Bayou to Carolina Bluffs.

Because of its scale, the Great Raft became incorporated in the mythology of the regional Caddo tribe, which had been in the area for thousands of years. They credited it with protecting them from competing tribes, as well as intermittently causing floods on the land and making it fertile for agriculture.

Harrelson et al. describe the origins of the raft:

This ecosystem of entangled logs, vegetation and sediments remained in place for almost two millennia, altering the flow regime of the Red River and causing a complete change in its geomorphic character from a single channel to a series of anastomosing channels. It is believed that the initial formation of the Great Raft was triggered by catastrophic flooding as the Red River was going through some major geomorphic threshold, such as a major avulsion. The main contributors to the development of the Great Raft are believed to be the shifting geomorphic conditions in conjunction with extensive precipitation, river bank rotational slips and slab failure, rapid lateral migration, copious, rapidly growing riparian vegetation, exceeding a geomorphic threshold, a flashy hydrograph and a very heavy sediment load.

==Characteristics==
At the beginning of the 19th century, the raft extended from Campti, Louisiana, to around Shreveport, Louisiana. The raft blocked the mouth of Twelve Mile Bayou, impeding settlement in the area west of Shreveport. There were many smaller logjams on the Red River.

The raft raised the banks of the river, creating bayous and several lakes. Called the Great Raft Lakes, these included Caddo and Cross Lakes, along the lower reaches of the Red River&#x27;s tributaries. Ports developed along these lakes, and Jefferson, Texas, on Caddo Lake became the second-largest inland port in the United States during this period. The city thrived and was considered a major gateway to East Texas. It was important for shipping out area commodity crops, such as cotton.

==Removal==

In 1829, the US Army Corps of Engineers hired steamboat builder and river captain Henry Miller Shreve (1785–1851), Superintendent of Western River Improvement, to remove the Great Raft to improve the river&#x27;s navigation. Harrelson et al. describes this effort:
Captain Shreve was a steamboat entrepreneur who had successfully invested in the new steam-power technology by developing the snag boat, a steam-powered boat used for raft removal. He had already used this technology to clear navigational paths in the Ohio and Mississippi rivers in 1827. Captain Shreve arrived at the toe of the Great Raft in April 1833 with four snag boats and a force of 159 men. His group began clearing a navigational path through 115 km of the Great Raft and, finally, by the spring of 1838, a path had been cleared; however, the remnants of the Great Raft along the river banks were not cleared and the Great Raft immediately began to reform

When Shreve began work, the raft blocked a distance from directly below to directly above Shreveport. By April 1835, Shreve had removed the raft up to the mouth of Twelvemile Bayou. He concluded this work in 1838, having removed the last impediment to navigation on the Red River. This task was continued by others until the latter part of the 19th century. For his efforts, the city of Shreveport was named after him.

==Second Great Raft==
Although Shreve had completely removed the original raft, another soon formed farther up the river. The new foot was at the head of the old raft, near today&#x27;s Belcher, Louisiana. This second raft gradually extended until it reached the Arkansas state line. This was removed in 1873 by Lieutenant Eugene Woodruff.

==Consequences==
When the log jams were removed, the water level in Caddo Lake and others dropped dramatically, reducing their navigability for riverboats. The ports declined, and riverboats ceased to travel in Caddo Lake.

The removal of the massive log jams hastened the capture of the Mississippi River&#x27;s waters in lower Louisiana by the Atchafalaya River, a major distributary emptying separately into the Gulf of Mexico. In the 20th century, to maintain the Mississippi, the US Army Corps of Engineers built the multibillion-dollar Old River Control Structure.

<doc id="348140" wikidata="Q164565" url="?curid=348140" title="Peter Molyneux">
<text>Peter Douglas Molyneux (; born 5 May 1959) is an English video game designer and programmer. He created the god games &quot;Populous&quot;, &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot;, and &quot;Black &amp; White&quot;, as well as &quot;Theme Park&quot;, the &quot;Fable&quot; series, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Godus&quot;. In 2012 he founded and currently runs 22cans, a video game development studio.

In 2009, he was chosen by &quot;IGN&quot; as one of the top 100 game creators of all time.

==Career==

===Early career===
Peter Molyneux began his career in 1982 by distributing and selling floppy disks which contained video games for Atari and the Commodore 64. He believed that including games on the disks would improve sales, and later concluded that the games were the main selling point.

He created &quot;The Entrepreneur&quot;, a text-based business simulation game about running a fledgling company. &quot;In those days you could literally call a game &#x27;Space Blob Attacks Mars&#x27; and sell about 50 million copies. So what did I do? I did a business simulation&quot;, Molyneux later said. Molyneux published the game himself in 1984 by duplicating hundreds of tapes on two Tandy Corporation recorders. After taking an advertising space in a game magazine, he prepared for the game&#x27;s success; he later stated in an interview, &quot;I was utterly convinced that this game would sell tons. I thought, &#x27;You know, this letter box is just not big enough. It&#x27;s just not going to fit all the envelopes.&#x27; So I cut – and this is no joke – I cut a bigger letter box&quot;. However, the game received only two orders, one of which Molyneux speculated was from his mother. In 2007, a GameSpy reviewer commented that the economic gameplay mechanics in Molyneux&#x27;s &quot;Fable II&quot; may have been a descendant of &quot;The Entrepreneur&quot;, stating, &quot;I&#x27;m a little concerned that it&#x27;s Molyneux sneaking in a remix of his first game, &quot;Entrepreneur&quot;&quot;.

Due to the game&#x27;s failure, Molyneux retreated from game design, and started Taurus Impex Limited—a company that exported baked beans to the Middle East—with his business partner Les Edgar. Commodore International mistook it for &quot;Torus&quot;, a more established company that produced networking software, and offered to provide Molyneux with ten free Amiga systems to help in porting &quot;his&quot; networking software. Molyneux later said &quot;it suddenly dawned on me that this guy didn&#x27;t know who we were. I suddenly had this crisis of conscience. I thought, &#x27;If this guy finds out, there go my free computers down the drain.&#x27; So I just shook his hand and ran out of that office.&quot; Taurus designed a database system for the Amiga called &quot;Acquisition – The Ultimate Database for The Amiga&quot; and, after clearing up the misunderstanding with Commodore, released the program to moderate success.

===Bullfrog Productions and Electronic Arts===
Using money earned from the database program, Molyneux and Les Edgar founded Bullfrog Productions in 1987. The company&#x27;s first game was a conversion of &quot;Druid II: Enlightenment&quot;. Molyneux recalled, &quot;I got in touch with a software company called Firebird and told them that I could program games. Of course I was bullshitting, but they gave me &quot;Druid 2&quot; to convert to the Amiga. You&#x27;re very unlikely to get that kind of break today.&quot; Molyneux provided the original concept for &quot;Populous&quot;, the first god game for the personal computer. Released in 1989, &quot;Populous&quot; was a major success for Bullfrog and went on to sell over 4 million copies.

Electronic Arts (EA), Bullfrog&#x27;s publisher, acquired the studio in January 1995. Molyneux had become an Electronic Arts vice-president and consultant in 1994, after EA purchased a significant share of Bullfrog.

Molyneux left Bullfrog in July 1997 to found Lionhead Studios, shortly after the release of &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot;. According to Molyneux, his choice to leave the company was a result of a chain of events from a night of drinking with his friend Tim Rance (who would later co-found Lionhead) around 1997. Molyneux had already been contemplating his departure (in 1996 the gaming news media reported &quot;rumors&quot; that he was unhappy at EA and would be leaving once &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot; was completed), and, while discussing this with Rance, Rance suggested he write out his resignation letter to EA. Molyneux typed out an email to EA&#x27;s CEO Larry Probst, and before Molyneux could stop him, Rance had sent the email. Though he quickly explained the situation to EA, the event caused tension in his relationship with EA, with EA asking him not to come into the office any more; according to Molyneux, EA feared that he would pull many of the other developers at Bullfrog along with him should he be present. EA threatened to pull support for &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot;, which was still in progress, but Molyneux insisted they allow him to complete it, most which he did from his own home. A significant innovation of the game was its unique combination of first- and third-person perspectives, in the ability to &quot;possess&quot; any one of the creatures (or &quot;minions&quot;) in the game world, yielding a first-person experience reproducing the physical characteristics, visual perspective, gait, and voice of the minion.

Bullfrog continued to develop games through 2001, and in 2004 EA merged Bullfrog Productions into EA UK.

===Lionhead Studios and Microsoft===
Molyneux came up with the concept for Lionhead Studios&#x27; first game, &quot;Black &amp; White&quot;, and convinced his small staff to take on the task in late 1997. He paid the $6 million in development costs himself. Despite his acrimonious departure from Electronic Arts, he opted to give them the publishing rights, explaining that EA were more reliable and had better worldwide distribution than any other publisher. After three years, in 2001, the game was finally released.

In April 2006, Lionhead Studios was acquired by Microsoft Game Studios. At E3 2006, Peter Molyneux gave several interviews in the press, in one of which he stated that &quot;I think you&#x27;re going to see a lot more fantastic games from Lionhead because of that relationship [with Microsoft].&quot; On 4 June 2009, he was promoted to Creative Director of Microsoft Game Studios, Europe, although he continued to produce video games with Lionhead Studios.

On 7 March 2012, Molyneux announced that he would be leaving Lionhead and Microsoft—after the completion of &quot;&quot;—to begin work at a company founded by former Lionhead Studios CTO Tim Rance called 22cans.

===22cans===
To date, 22cans has sold early access on multiple titles including &quot;Godus&quot;, &quot;Godus Wars&quot;, and &quot;The Trail&quot;. Despite years of development and successful Kickstarter financing for Godus, the game never left Steam Early Access. As of December 2023, both &quot;Godus&quot; and &quot;Godus Wars&quot; were removed from the Steam store.

In October 2023, Molyneux announced he was working on a new game, code-named &quot;Project MOAT&quot;, which was to be set in Albion, the setting of the &quot;Fable&quot; games. The project was officially unveiled on 20 August 2024, during Gamescom 2024, as a god game with the official name &quot;Masters of Albion&quot;.

==In the media==
As one of the industry&#x27;s leading and best-known figures, Molyneux has appeared on many television shows and video gaming news discussion or documentaries. He has been repeatedly interviewed for shows such as &quot;GamesMaster&quot;, &quot;Games Wars&quot;, &quot;Gamezville&quot;, &quot;Bad Influence!&quot;, &quot;Gamer.tv&quot;, and &quot;Games World&quot;. He also made an appearance in the Scottish web series &quot;Consolevania&quot;. More recently, Molyneux was featured within an episode of Godus alongside The Yogscast.

An episode of G4&#x27;s games retrospective series &quot;Icons&quot; was devoted to him, during its third season. More recently, a comprehensive two part interview was filmed of him during the 2006 Brighton Games Developer Conference by leading UK website Eurogamer. He was also featured in the fourth episode of the Discovery Channel mini-series &quot;Rise of the Video Game&quot; alongside Will Wright and Sid Meier, fellow developers of simulation titles. Molyneux was accredited in the &quot;Top Ten Game Creators&quot; Countdown by GameTrailers. He has given keynote addresses and spoke extensively at worldwide conferences, including Games Convention, Games Convention Asia, Develop, and the Game Developers Conference.

Despite the success of his games, both critical and financial, Molyneux has acquired a reputation for issuing over-enthusiastic descriptions of games under development, which then struggle to meet expectations. This goes back to &quot;Black &amp; White&quot;, though the most well-known case of this was with &quot;Fable&quot;, released in 2004 without many of the features talked about by Molyneux in press interviews during development. After the release, Molyneux publicly apologized for overhyping the game. In February 2014, he was quoted as being &quot;ashamed of the final product &quot;Fable 3&quot; and I never want to work with Microsoft again.&quot; In February 2015, Peter Molyneux stated during interviews in gaming blog &quot;Rock, Paper, Shotgun&quot; and British newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot; that he will &quot;never speak to the press again&quot;, after being personally attacked for not fulfilling all game promises, which ended in Molyneux announcing that he will not conduct further interviews. At the same time, gamers and game developer veterans began to question the intentions of those publications, such as Tim Schafer calling it &quot;out of proportion&quot; and a media hunt, saying &quot;I&#x27;m not saying that developers like Peter and I shouldn&#x27;t be responsible and accountable to deadlines. I&#x27;m just saying the reaction to recent events and the tone of that reaction is really way out of proportion to the seriousness of the events themselves.&quot;

==Awards and recognition==
Molyneux received an honorary doctorate from Abertay University in 2003. He was inducted into the AIAS Hall of Fame in 2004 and was honoured with an OBE in the New Year&#x27;s Honors list announced on 31 December 2004. He was awarded the title of Chevalier de l&#x27;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French government in March 2007. In July 2007, he was awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Science by the University of Southampton and that same year an honorary doctorate by the University of Surrey. In March 2011, he was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award by the Game Developers Choice Awards and has received a BAFTA Fellowship at the 2011 British Academy Video Games Awards.

<text>The Eloi are one of the two fictional species of post-humans, along with the Morlocks, in H. G. Wells&#x27; 1895 novel &quot;The Time Machine&quot;.

==In H. G. Wells&#x27; &quot;The Time Machine&quot;==
By the year AD 802,701, humanity has diverged into two separate species: the Eloi and the Morlocks. The Eloi live a banal life of ease on the surface of the Earth while the Morlocks live underground, tending machinery and providing food, clothing, and inventory for the Eloi. The narration suggests that the divergence of species may have been the result of a widening separation between social classes. The Eloi are suggested to be the descendants of a privileged, surface-dwelling, upper class, which once dominated the subterranean working class. The Time Traveler, the story&#x27;s protagonist, surmises that the surface-dwelling civilization had reached its zenith and devolved into decadence and indifference. At the same time, the &quot;underworlders&quot;, who supported the surface world, grew accustomed to labor and harsh, underground existence, and degenerated into the Morlocks. At some point, the Morlocks, who had continued providing for the helpless Eloi (the Time Traveler guesses this may at first have been out of tradition or intrinsic habit) began feeding on their above-ground counterparts and now raise them like cattle to serve as their food supply. 

The Eloi are described as anatomically smaller than modern humans (standing roughly four feet tall), with shoulder-length curly hair, pointed chins, large eyes, small ears, small mouths with bright red thin lips, and sub-human intelligence (&quot;on the intellectual level of one of our five-year-old children&quot;). Their bodies are beautiful in appearance but surprisingly feeble. They do not perform much work, except to feed, play, and mate, and are characterized by apathy; when Weena falls into a river, none of the other Eloi move to help her (she is rescued instead by the Time Traveler). They live on a diet of fruits and vegetables, which may be cultivated for them by the Morlocks. Their language is described as &quot;very sweet and liquid.&quot; The Eloi seem to dread only darkness and always sleep in droves within their &quot;palaces&quot;. This is later revealed to be because the Morlocks ascend to harvest them when darkness falls. 

A portion of the book written for the &quot;New Review&quot; version, later published as a separate short story, reveals that a visit by the Time Traveler to the even more distant future results in his encountering rabbit-like hopping herbivores, apparently the descendants of the Eloi. They are described as being plantigrade, with longer hind legs and tailless, being covered with straight greyish hair that &quot;thickened about the head into a Skye terrier&#x27;s mane&quot;, having human-like hands (described as fore feet), and having a roundish head with a projecting forehead and forward-looking eyes that were obscured by lank hair.

==Film adaptations==

In the 1960 film version of the book, the Eloi are depicted as identical to modern humans but small, blond, and blue-eyed. The Morlocks use an air raid siren to put the Eloi into a trance state and lure them into their caves. One of the Eloi is motivated to beat a Morlock to death when it attacks the Time Traveller.

In the 2002 movie adaptation of &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, the Eloi are depicted as identical to modern humans with a hunter-gatherer lifestyle and sport primitive-style clothing and appear to be an ethnic amalgamation of various indigenous races but maintain the English language as an intellectual exercise.

==In Dan Simmons&#x27; &quot;Ilium&quot;==
In Dan Simmons&#x27; &quot;Ilium&quot; novel, &quot;Eloi&quot; is a nickname for the lazy, uneducated, and uncultured descendants of the human race after the post-humans have left Earth. The name is a reference to Wells&#x27; Eloi. Old-style humans and post-humans rule in Simmons&#x27; novel, with the Eloi being kept in &quot;zoos&quot; in restricted areas on Earth. The Eloi are technically adept but do not understand the technology; they regress and unlearn millennia of culture, thought and reason, until they are satisfied with the pleasure of merely existing.

<doc id="348145" wikidata="Q548119" url="?curid=348145" title="Simurgh">
<text>The simurgh (; ; also spelled &quot;senmurv, simorgh, simorg&quot;, &quot;simurg&quot;, &quot;simoorg, simorq&quot; or &quot;simourv&quot;) is a benevolent bird in Persian mythology and literature. It bears some similarities with mythological birds from different origins, such as the phoenix ( &quot;quqnūs&quot;) and the humā (). The figure can be found in all periods of Iranian art and literature and is also evident in the iconography of Georgia, medieval Armenia, the Eastern Roman Empire, and other regions that were within the realm of Persian cultural influence.

==Etymology==
The Persian word &quot;sīmurğ&quot; () derives from Middle Persian &quot;sēnmurw&quot; and earlier &quot;sēnmuruγ&quot;, also attested in Pazend texts as &quot;sīna-mrū&quot;. The Middle Persian word comes from Avestan &quot;mərəγō Saēnō&quot; &quot;the bird Saēna&quot;, originally a raptor, likely an eagle, falcon, or sparrowhawk, as can be deduced from the etymological cognate Sanskrit &quot;śyenaḥ&quot; (श्येनः) raptor, eagle and bird of prey, which also appears as a divine figure. &quot;Saēna&quot; is also a personal name. The word was lent to Armenian as &quot;siramarg&quot; () &#x27;peacock&#x27;.

On the other hand, the phrase &quot;sī murğ&quot; () means &quot;thirty birds&quot; in Persian; this has been used by Attar of Nishapur in his symbolic story of &quot;The Conference of the Birds&quot;, the frame story of which employs a play on the name.

==Mythology==
.

===Form and function===

The Simurgh is depicted in Iranian art as a winged creature in the shape of a bird, gigantic enough to carry off an elephant or a whale. It appears as a peacock with the head of a dog and the claws of a lion – sometimes, however, also with a human face. The Simurgh is inherently benevolent. Being part mammal, they suckle their young. The Simurgh has an enmity towards snakes, and its natural habitat is a place with plenty of water. Its feathers are said to be the colour of copper in some versions, and though it was originally described as being a dog-bird, later it was shown with either the head of a man or a dog.

&quot;Si-&quot;, the first element in the name, has been connected in folk etymology to Modern Persian &quot;si&quot; (&quot;thirty&quot;). Although this prefix is not historically related to the origin of the name &quot;simurgh&quot;, &quot;thirty&quot; has nonetheless been the basis for legends incorporating that number – for instance, that the simurgh was as large as thirty birds or had thirty colours (&quot;siræng&quot;). Other suggested etymologies include Pahlavi &quot;sin murgh&quot; (&quot;eagle bird&quot;) and Avestan &quot;saeno merego&quot; (&quot;eagle&quot;).

Iranian legends consider the bird so old that it had seen the destruction of the world three times over. The simurgh learned so much by living so long that it is thought to possess the knowledge of all the ages. In one legend, the simurgh was said to live 1,700 years before plunging itself into flames (much like the phoenix).

The simurgh was considered to purify the land and waters and hence bestow fertility. The creature represented the union between the Earth and the sky, serving as mediator and messenger between the two. The simurgh roosted in Gaokerena, the Hōm (Avestan: Haoma) Tree of Life, which stands in the middle of the world sea (Vourukasha). The plant is potent medicine and is called all-healing, and the seeds of all plants are deposited on it. When the simurgh took flight, the leaves of the tree of life shook, making all the seeds of every plant fall out. These seeds floated around the world on the winds of Vayu-Vata and the rains of Tishtrya, in cosmology taking root to become every type of plant that ever lived and curing all the illnesses of mankind.

The relationship between the simurgh and Hōm is extremely close. Like the simurgh, Hōm is represented as a bird, a messenger, and the essence of purity that can heal any illness or wound. Hōm – appointed as the first priest – is the essence of divinity, a property it shares with the simurgh. The Hōm is in addition the vehicle of &quot;farr(ah)&quot; (MP: &quot;khwarrah&quot;, Avestan: &quot;khvarenah&quot;, &quot;kavaēm kharēno&quot;) (&quot;divine glory&quot; or &quot;fortune&quot;). &quot;Farrah&quot; in turn represents the divine mandate that was the foundation of a king&#x27;s authority.

It appears as a bird resting on the head or shoulder of would-be kings and clerics, indicating Ormuzd&#x27;s acceptance of that individual as his divine representative on Earth. For the commoner, Bahram wraps fortune/glory &quot;around the house of the worshipper, for wealth in cattle, like the great bird Saena, and as the watery clouds cover the great mountains&quot; (&quot;Yasht&quot; 14.41, cf. the rains of Tishtrya above). Like the simurgh, &quot;farrah&quot; is also associated with the waters of &quot;Vourukasha&quot; (&quot;Yasht&quot; 19.51, 56–57). In Yašt 12.17 Simorgh&#x27;s (Saēna&#x27;s) tree stands in the middle of the sea Vourukaša, it has good and potent medicine and is called all-healing, and the seeds of all plants are deposited on it.

===In the &quot;Shahnameh&quot;===
The simurgh made its most famous appearance in Ferdowsi&#x27;s epic &quot;Shahnameh&quot; (Book of Kings), where its involvement with Prince Zal is described. According to the &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, Zal, the son of Saam, was born albino. When Saam saw his albino son, he assumed that the child was the spawn of devils, and abandoned the infant on the mountain &quot;Alborz&quot;.

The child&#x27;s cries were heard by the tender-hearted simurgh, who lived atop this peak, and she retrieved the child and raised him as her own. Zal was taught much wisdom from the loving simurgh, who has all knowledge, but the time came when he grew into a man and yearned to rejoin the world of men. Though the simurgh was terribly saddened, she gave him three golden feathers which he was to burn if he ever needed her assistance.
Upon returning to his kingdom, Zal fell in love and married the beautiful Rudaba. When it came time for their son to be born, the labor was prolonged and terrible; Zal was certain that his wife would die in labour. Rudaba was near death when Zal decided to summon the simurgh. The simurgh appeared and instructed him upon how to perform a cesarean section thus saving Rudaba and the child, who became one of the greatest Persian heroes, Rostam.

Simurgh also shows up in the story of the Seven Trials of Esfandiyar in the latter&#x27;s 5th labor. After killing the wicked enchantress, Esfandiyar fights a simurgh, and despite the simurgh&#x27;s many powers, Esfandiyar strikes it in the neck, decapitating it. The simurgh&#x27;s offspring then rise to fight Esfandiyar, but they, too, are slain.

===In Persian Sufi poetry===

In classical and modern Persian literature the simorḡ is frequently mentioned, particularly as a metaphor for God in Sufi mysticism. In the 12th century &quot;Conference of the Birds&quot;, Iranian Sufi poet Farid ud-Din Attar wrote of a band of pilgrim birds in search of the simurgh. In the poem, the birds of the world gather to decide who is to be their king, as they have none. The hoopoe, the wisest of them all, suggests that they should find the legendary simorgh, a mythical Persian bird roughly equivalent to the western phoenix. The hoopoe leads the birds, each of whom represent a human fault which prevents man from attaining enlightenment. When the group of thirty birds finally reach the dwelling place of the simorgh, all they find is a lake in which they see their own reflection. This scene employs a pun on the Persian expression for &quot;thirty birds&quot; (&quot;si morgh&quot;).

The phrase also appears three times in Rumi&#x27;s Masnavi, e.g. in Book VI, Story IX: &quot;The nest of the &quot;sī murğ&quot; is beyond Mount Qaf&quot; (as translated by E.H. Whinfield).

Through heavy Persian influence, the simurgh was introduced to the Arabic-speaking world, where the concept was conflated with other Arabic mythical birds such as the ghoghnus, a bird having some mythical relation with the date palm, and further developed as the &quot;rukh&quot; (the origin of the English word &quot;roc&quot;).
Representations of simurgh were adopted in early Umayyad art and coinage.

===In Kurdish folklore===
Simurgh is shortened to &quot;sīmir&quot; in the Kurdish language. The scholar C. V. Trever quotes two Kurdish folktales about the bird. These versions go back to the common stock of Iranian simorḡ stories. In one of the folk tales, a hero rescues simurgh&#x27;s offspring by killing a snake that was crawling up the tree to feed upon them. As a reward, the simurgh gives him three of her feathers which the hero can use to call for her help by burning them. Later, the hero uses the feathers, and the simurgh carries him to a distant land. In the other tale, the simurgh carries the hero out of the netherworld; here the simurgh feeds its young with its teats, a trait which agrees with the description of the simurgh in the Middle Persian book of Zadspram. In another tale, simurgh feeds the hero on the journey while the hero feeds simurgh with pieces of sheep&#x27;s fat.

==In popular culture==
*Ambrose Bierce&#x27;s &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; (1906) characterizes the Simurgh as &quot;omnipotent on condition that it do nothing&quot; and likens it to the role of the rabble in a republic.

<text>On the fly is a phrase used to describe something that is being changed while the process that the change affects is ongoing. It is used in the automotive, computer, and culinary industries. In cars, on the fly can be used to describe the changing of the cars configuration while it is still driving. Processes that can occur while the car is still driving include switching between two wheel drive and four wheel drive on some cars and opening and closing the roof on some convertible cars. In computing, on the fly CD writers can read from one CD and write the data to another without saving it on a computer&#x27;s memory. Switching programs or applications on the fly in multi-tasking operating systems means the ability to switch between native and/or emulated programs or applications that are still running and running in parallel while performing their tasks or processes, but without pausing, freezing, or delaying any, or other unwanted events. Switching computer parts on the fly means computer parts are replaced while the computer is still running. It can also be used in programming to describe changing a program while it is still running. In restaurants and other places involved in the preparation of food, the term is used to indicate that an order needs to be made right away.

==Colloquial usage==
In colloquial use, &quot;on the fly&quot; means something created when needed. The phrase is used to mean:
# something that was not planned ahead
# changes that are made during the execution of same activity: , .

==Automotive usage==
In the automotive industry, the term refers to the circumstance of performing certain operations while a vehicle is driven by the engine and moving. In reference to four-wheel drive vehicles, this term describes the ability to change from two to four-wheel drive while the car is in gear and moving. In some convertible models, the roof can be folded electrically on the fly, whereas in other cases the car must be stopped.
In harvesting machines, newer monitoring systems let the driver track the quality of the grain, while enabling them to adjust the rotor speed on the fly as harvesting progresses.

==Computer usage==
In multitasking computing an operating system can handle several programs, both native applications or emulated software, that are running independent, parallel, together in the same time in the same device, using separated or shared resources and/or data, executing their tasks separately or together, while a user can switch on the fly between them or groups of them to use obtained effects or supervise purposes, without waste of time or waste of performance. In operating systems using GUI very often it is done by switching from an active window (or an object playing similar role) of a particular software piece to another one but of another software. 

A computer can compute results on the fly, or retrieve a previously stored result.

It can mean to make a copy of a removable media (CD-ROM, DVD, etc.) directly, without first saving the source on an intermediate medium (a harddisk); for example, copying a CD-ROM from a CD-ROM drive to a CD-Writer drive. The copy process requires each block of data to be retrieved and immediately written to the destination, so that there is room in the working memory to retrieve the next block of data.

When used for encrypted data storage, &quot;on the fly&quot; the data stream is automatically encrypted as it is written and decrypted when read back again, transparently to software. The acronym OTFE is typically used. 

On-the-fly programming is the technique of modifying a program without stopping it.

A similar concept, hot swapping, refers to on-the-fly replacement of computer hardware.

==On-the-fly computing==
On-the-fly computing (OTF computing) is about automating and customizing software tailored to the needs of a user. According to a requirement specification, this software is composed of basic components, so-called basic services, and a user-specific setting of these basic components is made. Accordingly, the requested services are compiled only at the request of the user and then run in a specially designed data center to make the user the functions of the (on-the-fly) created service accessible.

==Restaurant usage==
In restaurants, cafes, banquet halls, and other places involved in the preparation of food, the term is used to indicate that an order needs to be made right away. This is often because a previously-served dish is inedible, because a waiter has made a mistake or delayed, or because a guest has to leave promptly.

==Usage in sports==
In ice hockey, it is both legal and common for teams to make line changes (player substitutions) when the puck is in play. Such line changes are referred to as being done &quot;on the fly&quot;.

<doc id="348166" wikidata="Q726060" url="?curid=348166" title="Road Warrior Hawk">
<text>Michael James Hegstrand (January 26, 1957 – October 19, 2003) was an American professional wrestler. He was best known as Road Warrior Hawk, one half of the tag team known as the Road Warriors (or the &quot;Legion of Doom&quot;), with Road Warrior Animal. Outside of the Road Warriors, Hawk was a sporadic challenger for world heavyweight championships on pay-per-view from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s. He headlined the inaugural 1993 edition of Extreme Championship Wrestling&#x27;s premier annual event, November to Remember.

==Early life==
While living in Minneapolis, Hegstrand attended Patrick Henry High School where he graduated in 1976. After high school, he had various odd jobs to make ends meet such as a butcher. It was while working as a bouncer at Gramma B&#x27;s in the Twin Cities that he caught the eye of Eddie Sharkey, a well-known wrestling trainer. Sharkey thought that Hegstrand, along with Joe Laurinaitis, Rick Rood and Barry Darsow could make it big in professional wrestling.

==Professional wrestling career==
===Early career (1983–1986)===

Hegstrand started his career as part of the Traveling All-Stars. He was billed as &quot;Crusher Von Haig&quot; and wrestled in Vancouver. Soon growing weary of the road and becoming homesick. Hegstrand traveled back home with Rood. Later in 1983, fate struck again when Laurinaitis&#x27;s partner for the night found himself in legal trouble. Needing a quick replacement, Ole Anderson gave Hegstrand a call, and he accepted the booking to team with Laurinaitis. Neither man knew at the time that they would make wrestling history that day. When Paul Ellering was looking to put together a stable of heels in Georgia Championship Wrestling called The Legion of Doom it was decided to pair Laurinaitis with Hegstrand and change their names to &quot;Animal&quot; and &quot;Hawk&quot; respectively; thus, the Road Warriors were born. To look more intimidating the two shaved their heads into Mohawks and started wearing studded dog collars, leather chaps, and face paint. The look and name was taken from &quot;Mad Max 2: the Road Warrior&quot;, helping to paint the two as no-mercy monsters. Their interview style was vicious, yet charismatic and a bit humorous. Hawk was known for often beginning his promos with his trademark yell of &quot;Wellllllllllllll!...&quot; and ending with his catch phrase of &quot;Oooooooooh, what a ruuuuuuuuuuuush!&quot; The team was an instant hit, revolutionizing the tag-team scene with their power moves, no mercy attitudes, and innovative face paint that would spawn many future imitators in wrestling. In Georgia, they won the NWA National Tag Team Championship four times before moving on to bigger promotions such as the American Wrestling Association in the US and All Japan Pro Wrestling in Japan, winning tag-team titles wherever they went.

===National Wrestling Alliance / World Championship Wrestling (1986–1990)===

Their hard hitting style, no nonsense attitude, and winning ways made the Road Warriors fan favorites wherever they went; even when they were booked as heels, the fans refused to boo them. They were so in demand that they started to split their time between the AWA and the National Wrestling Alliance until finally leaving the AWA for big money contracts with the NWA and a huge push for the monster duo. The move paid off instantly as they won the inaugural Jim Crockett, Sr. Memorial Cup Tag Team Tournament and feuded with the top stars of the NWA such as The Four Horsemen and The Russian Team (which included the Road Warriors’ old training buddy Barry Darsow, then wrestling as Krusher Khrushchev). During their initial run in the Mid-Atlantic region of the NWA, they helped popularize the WarGames match, the Scaffold match, and their trademark Chicago Street Fight.

In 1988, the Road Warriors engaged in a violent feud with the Powers of Pain (The Barbarian and The Warlord), the first team that could truly match the Road Warriors in power (and who were one of the most well known Road Warrior clones). The Powers of Pain even went so far as to injure Animal&#x27;s eye (kayfabe) during a weightlifting competition. When Animal returned, he initially wore a hockey goalie mask to protect his eye. The angle abruptly ended when the Powers of Pain left the NWA after finding out they were booked against the Road Warriors in a series of Scaffold Matches and they did not want to get hurt by falling off the scaffold. Near the end of 1988, the Road Warriors captured the NWA World Tag Team Championship from The Midnight Express whom they mauled in short order to win the titles in New Orleans. Despite being heels at the time and using brutal tactics against Stan Lane and &quot;Beautiful&quot; Bobby Eaton, once again they were cheered by the crowd. After being the &quot;Uncrowned champions&quot; for a long time, the Road Warriors’ run with the tag-team titles was short-lived. Crooked referee Teddy Long used a fast count to cheat the Road Warriors out of their titles. In their last year with the NWA, the Warriors feuded mainly with The Varsity Club, The Samoan Swat Team, and The Skyscrapers before leaving the NWA in the summer of 1990.

===World Wrestling Federation (1990–1992)===
The Road Warriors immediately signed with the World Wrestling Federation and were pushed into a feud with Demolition (which once again included their old training partner Barry Darsow). Due to his health, Ax was replaced by a new member of Demolition, Crush. (Popular rumor at the time cited a heart condition on Bill Eadie&#x27;s part, but this has been discredited in recent years. An allergic reaction to shellfish while in Japan after WrestleMania VI was the real cause of Eadie&#x27;s temporary health problem. He confirmed this in a shoot interview in 2007.) However, fans did not react as strongly to this new Demolition team as they had to the original configuration, and the feud was considered a disappointment. During the early part of the feud, Legion of Doom often teamed with WWF World Heavyweight Champion The Ultimate Warrior in six-man tag matches against all three members of Demolition. Just over a year after signing with the WWF, the Legion of Doom won the WWF World Tag Team Titles from The Nasty Boys at SummerSlam 1991 and held them for about six months. When they lost the titles in February 1992 they were briefly taken off television, only to return with long-time manager Paul Ellering by their side, as well as a wooden dummy called &quot;Rocco&quot;. Both members of the Legion of Doom thought the gimmick was stupid, as did most of the fans and it led to Hawk quitting the WWF, leaving Animal on his own for the first time in nine years. When Animal suffered a severe back injury a short while later, everyone thought it was the end of the legendary team.

===Japan, ECW and Independents (1992–1995)===
Hawk competed as a singles wrestler in Europe, Australia, and Japan and although he won nearly every singles match he competed in, he was usually seen (by North American and Japanese fans at least) as a tag team wrestler. Thus, he always fought either mid-card opponents or made teams with better-known singles stars. When he joined New Japan Pro-Wrestling, he was immediately paired with Kensuke Sasaki, then simply known as a good mid-carder, as the Hell Raisers (Sasaki adopting the face paint and gimmick Power Warrior). The two dominated NJPW&#x27;s tag team ranks for a while through their two wins of the IWGP Tag Team Championship, but no North American promoter thought about bringing them as a team, due to Sasaki&#x27;s affiliation with NJPW. As a singles wrestler, Hawk found success in Europe, winning the CWA World Heavyweight Championship. Hawk also competed in NWA Eastern Championship Wrestling, the progenitor of Extreme Championship Wrestling, in 1993. Hawk left ECW in 1994. Hawk competed in the independent circuit for Pro Wrestling America, Mid Eastern Wrestling Federation, Smokey Mountain Wrestling and Midwest Territorial Wrestling.

===World Championship Wrestling (1993, 1995–1996)===
In August 1993 Hawk made sporadic appearances in World Championship Wrestling as a mystery partner of Dustin Rhodes and later as a replacement partner when Davey Boy Smith left the promotion but nothing permanent ever came of it, and Hawk left after Starrcade in December 1993. In May 1995, he reappeared in WCW. In July 1995, he helped Sting in a feud against Meng and Kurasawa, but a proposed singles feud with Kurasawa fell through due to an arm injury (in kayfabe Kurasawa broke Hawk&#x27;s arm using a cross armbreaker, to let Hawk rest). Hawk returned in January 1996, but this time, he also brought Animal back with him as his back had finally recovered enough for him to return to active competition. During that time, Sting and Lex Luger had won the WCW World Tag Team Championship and the Warriors challenged them, to no success. The rise of the New World Order precluded further challenges, and they headed back to the WWF.

===Return to WWF (1997–1999)===
After leaving WCW they returned to the WWF where the Legion of Doom took part in the feud between &quot;Stone Cold&quot; Steve Austin and the Hart Foundation, siding with Austin. The Legion of Doom also became 2 time tag-team champions on October 7, 1997, when they defeated The Godwinns. In November 1997 the Legion of Doom faced the newly formed New Age Outlaws (Road Dogg and Billy Gunn) and shockingly lost the titles to the upstart team. On an episode of &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;, L.O.D. challenged D-Generation X (DX) in a Tag Match. During the match, The New Age Outlaws attacked L.O.D. and shaved off one of Hawk&#x27;s mohawks, and threw Animal through the announcers table. After several unsuccessful challenges the L.O.D. were repackaged as &quot;Legion of Doom 2000&quot; with manager Sunny, although she did not stay with the team for long.

During the Attitude Era, in which the WWF moved towards a more &quot;adult&quot; product, the Legion of Doom was placed into a storyline incorporating Hegstrand&#x27;s real-life drug addiction and alcoholism, against the wishes of both Hegstrand and Laurinaitis. The storyline found the Legion of Doom crumbling as Hawk repeatedly showed up to matches apparently drunk or under the influence of drugs, and began demonstrating suicidal tendencies. In order to stabilize the team, a third member, Puke, was introduced later known as Droz. This led to the conclusion of the storyline, in which a suicidal Hawk climbed to the top of the TitanTron, the giant television monitor erected during episodes of WWF&#x27;s &quot;Raw Is War&quot; to show match highlights to fans in attendance. Puke, supposedly attempting to rescue Hawk, climbed after him, only to apparently throw Hawk over the side (with a special effect being used to make it appear as though fans could see Hegstrand&#x27;s body plunging a fatal distance behind the screen); Puke then revealed that he had been enabling Hawk&#x27;s drug addiction in order to kill him and take his place in the Legion of Doom. Being forced to act out Hegstrand&#x27;s personal demons onscreen eventually proved too much for both Hegstrand and Laurinaitis, and both men quit the company shortly after the &quot;Puke killed Hawk&quot; incident.

===Late career (1999–2003) ===
While the Road Warriors never officially broke up, Animal started making an increasing number of solo appearances after they left the WWF as Hegstrand struggled with drug and alcohol addiction and generally did not appear at many wrestling shows during this time. In 2000, during a tour in Australia, Hegstrand was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy, a heart condition that stopped him from wrestling for a short while. He was able to overcome its effects and returned to a regular working schedule later on. Laurinaitis and Hegstrand became born-again Christians in 2001 and appeared at a number of Christian wrestling events run by Ted DiBiase and Nikita Koloff hoping to reignite their tag-team career. On June 22, 2002, International Wrestling Superstars, Road Warriors Animal &amp; Hawk defeated the Headshrinkers for the World Tag-Team Championship. That victory also led to Team USA winning the International Tournament held in Atlantic City, New Jersey.

They also appeared in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) in late 2002 and early 2003 as part of a group that opposed Vince Russo’s faction Sports Entertainment Xtreme but only wrestled one actual match for the company. Animal and Hawk made a surprise appearance on &quot;Raw&quot; on May 12, 2003, when they took on Kane and Rob Van Dam for the World Tag Team Championship. Although Hawk and Animal came up short in their attempt to become three-time champions, it was clear that Hawk had defeated the demons that had once kept him from competing, and the Road Warriors had hopes of returning to WWE. Later in 2003, Hawk made an appearance with the All World Wrestling League, a take-off of the &#x27;original&#x27; Big Time Wrestling that was owned by The Original Sheik who died earlier that year; it was run by the sons of The Sheik, Eddie and Tom Farhat. They decided to book Hawk for an event in Holt, Michigan; that event was the second to last time Hawk wrestled. Two weeks before he died, he wrestled his final match with Animal in Oshawa, Ontario, defeating Greg &quot;The Hammer&quot; Valentine and Buff Bagwell.

==Personal Life==
Hegstrand and his tag team partner Lauriniatis owned two gyms in Minneapolis in the late 80’s. The pair, alongside gym employees Bob Truax and Dan Stock, conceptualized the Zubaz workout pants and helped popularize the brand globally. Hegstrand owned 25% of the company until its closure in 1996.

===Death and legacy===
Hegstrand died on October 19, 2003, in the early morning in his home in Indian Rocks Beach, Florida. He was 46 years old. His friends said that he and his wife Dale had recently bought a condominium near their current home and were packing their boxes the night before. Hegstrand said that he felt tired and went to take a nap. When his wife checked on him at about 1:00AM, he had died of a sudden heart attack. At the time of his death, Hawk and Animal were working on a book about their careers; Animal released the book (alongside co-writer Andrew Wright) as &quot;The Road Warriors: Danger, Death and the Rush of Wrestling&quot; () in 2014. Animal returned to WWE in mid-2005 and decided to dedicate his entire run to Hegstrand, including his tag team title victory with Heidenreich at The Great American Bash.

On the March 28, 2011 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, it was announced that the Road Warriors would be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame Class of 2011. On April 2, 2011, the night before WrestleMania XXVII they, along with Paul Ellering, were inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame by Dusty Rhodes.

 The Road Warriors reign with the NWA World Six-Man Tag Team Championship, with Genichiro Tenryu, began December 7, 1988, after Ted Turner&#x27;s purchase of Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling from Jim Crockett, Jr. and having it renamed World Championship Wrestling.

Hawk and Animal&#x27;s reign with this championship also happened after Ted Turner bought and renamed the promotion. However, it took place before the title was renamed the WCW World Tag Team Championship.

<text>Ľudovít Štúr (; 28 October 1815 – 12 January 1856), also known as Ľudovít Velislav Štúr, was a Slovak revolutionary, politician, and writer. As a leader of the Slovak national revival in the 19th century and the codifier of standard Slovak, he is lauded as one of the most important figures in Slovak history.

Štúr was an organizer of the Slovak volunteer campaigns during the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. He was also a politician, poet, journalist, publisher, teacher, philosopher, linguist, and member of the Hungarian Parliament.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===

Ľudovít Štúr was born on 28 October 1815 in Zayugróc, in the Austrian Empire (in the same house where Alexander Dubček was later born) as the second child of Samuel and Anna Štúr. He was baptized in the Evangelical Lutheran church in Uhrovec. He acquired his basic education, including the study of Latin, from his father Samuel, who was a teacher. From 1827 to 1829, he studied in Győr where he attended a lower grammar school. There, he improved his knowledge of history, and the German, Greek, and Hungarian languages. These studies inspired his admiration of Pavel Jozef Šafárik, Ján Kollár and Jiří Dobrovsky. In 1829, he decided to change schools.

From 1829 to 1836, Ľudovít Štúr studied at the prestigious Lutheran &quot;Lýceum&quot; (preparatory high school and college) in Pressburg (modern-day Bratislava) and became a member of the Czech-Slav Society, which stimulated his interest in all Slav nations. The Lýceum boasted a renowned professor, Juraj Palkovič, in the Department of the Czechoslovak Language and Ancient Literature, the only department at a Protestant school of higher education in 19th century Hungary.

In 1831, Ľudovít Štúr wrote his first poems. From January to September 1834, he temporarily interrupted his studies due to a lack of finances, and returned to Uhrovec, where he worked as a scribe for Count Károly Zay. Later that year, he resumed his studies, was active in the historical and literary circle of the Czech-Slav Society, was responsible for correspondence with members of the Society, gave private lessons in the house of a merchant in Pressburg (Bratislava), taught younger students at the Lýceum, and established contacts with important foreign and Czech scholars. On 17 December 1834, he was elected secretary of the Czech-Slav Society at the Lýceum.

=== Slovak national movement ===

In May 1835, Ľudovít Štúr persuaded Jozef Hurban to become involved in the Slovak national movement. Also that year, he was co-editor of the &quot;Plody&quot; (&quot;Fruits&quot;) almanac, a compilation of the best works of the members of the Czech-Slav Society, including poems of Štúr&#x27;s. He became vice-president of the Czech-Slav Society, teaching older students at the Lýceum the history of the Slavs and their literatures.

In 1836, Štúr wrote a letter to Czech historian František Palacký, in which he stated that the Czech language used by the Protestants in Upper Hungary had become incomprehensible for ordinary Slovaks, and proposed the creation of a unified Czechoslovak language, provided that the Czechs would be willing to use some Slovak words – just like Slovaks would officially accept some Czech words. But the Czechs were unwilling to accept this, and so Štúr and his friends decided to introduce a completely new Slovak language standard instead. On 24 April 1836, a trip to Devín Castle (Dévény, now part of Bratislava) by the members of the Slovak national movement took place, led by Štúr as the vice-president of the Czech-Slav Society. The beginning of his group&#x27;s extensive efforts on behalf of national awareness are linked to this visit to the ruins of Devín Castle, woven together with legends and reminders of Great Moravia. The members of the Czech-Slav Society swore here to be true to the national cause, deciding to travel around Upper Hungary to drum up support for their ideas. At the castle, they also adopted additional Slavic names (e.g., Jozef Hurban became Jozef Miloslav Hurban, etc.).

From 1836 to 1838, as deputy (non-stipendiary assistant) for Professor Palkovič, Chair of the Czechoslovak Language and Literature Department at the Lýceum where he was previously a student, he taught History of Slavic Literature. He continued to write poetry and under his leadership, the number of members of the Czech-Slav Society continuously increased. In this year, a poem of Štúr&#x27;s was published in printed form for the first time: &quot;Óda na Hronku&quot; (&quot;An ode to Hronka&quot;). In April 1837, the Czech-Slav Society was banned due to a commotion between students at the Lýceum. One week later, Štúr founded the Institute of the Czechoslovak Language and Literature, within which the activities of the Czech-Slav Society continued. In that year, he continued to write articles for newspapers and journals, including &quot;Tatranka&quot;, &quot;Hronka&quot;, &quot;Květy&quot; (Czech), &quot;Časopis českého musea&quot;, &quot;Danica&quot; (Croatian) and &quot;Tygodnik literacki&quot; (Polish).

=== Travels in Germany and early political works ===
From 1838 to 1840, he attended the (Protestant) University of Halle in Germany, where he studied linguistics, history, and philosophy. He was influenced by the works of the German philosophers Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Johann Gottfried Herder. Also during this period, his poetic cycle &quot;Dumky večerní&quot; (&quot;Evening Thoughts&quot;, written in Czech) was published in the Czech journal &quot;Květy&quot;. He left Pressburg for Halle in September 1838. On his way to Halle, he spent more than a month in Prague, in the company of Czech patriots. In the spring of 1839, Štúr made a long journey to the Upper and Lower Lusatia in Germany (inhabited by Slavs) and got in touch with the Slavs there. He wrote the short travelogue &quot;Cesta do Lužic vykonaná na jar 1839&quot; (&quot;A journey to Lusatia made in the spring of 1839&quot;), written in Czech and published in the Czech journal &quot;Časopis českého musea&quot;.

In 1840, he returned to Bratislava via Prague and Hradec Králové (Königgrätz), where he spent some time in the house of publisher Jan Pospíšil. From October, he was once again working as deputy for Professor Palkovič at the Department of the Czecho-Slav Language and Literature at the Evangelical Lutheran Lýceum, teaching courses of grammar and Slav history, and continuing his activities at the Institute of the Czechoslovak Language.

During 1841–1844, Štúr was co-editor of Palkovič&#x27;s literary magazine, &quot;Tatranka&quot;. In 1841, he started activities aimed at publishing a Slovak political newspaper. He wrote defenses and polemic texts, as well as his &quot;Starý a nový věk Slovákov&quot; (&quot;The old and the new age of the Slovaks&quot;), written in Old Czech and published in 1935 (not in Slovak until 1994). On 16 August 1841, Štúr and his friends ascended Kriváň (a symbolic mountain in Slovak culture), an event that is now commemorated by annual excursions to its summit. In 1842, he initiated the first &quot;Slovenský prestolný prosbopis&quot;, a Slovak petition to the Royal Court in Vienna requiring the government to stop national persecutions by the Hungarians in Upper Hungary. His application for a licence to publish a newspaper was turned down in the same year.

=== Codification of the Slovak language ===
On 2 February 1843, in Pressburg, Štúr and his friends decided to create a new Slovak language standard (later used as a basis for contemporary literary Slovak), based on central Slovak dialects – a common language that would unify all Slovaks speaking many different dialects. From 26 to 29 June 1843, a special committee met to investigate the Institute of Czechoslovak Language at the Lýceum, also interrogating Štúr.

In July 1843, his defense, &quot;Die Beschwerden und Klagen der Slaven in Ungarn über die gesetzwidrigen Übergriffe der Magyaren&quot; (&quot;The complaints and grievances of the Slavs in Hungary about the illegal malfeasances of the Hungarians&quot;), which editorial offices throughout 19th century Hungary had refused to publish, was published in Leipzig, Germany. From 11 to 16 July 1843, at the parish house of J. M. Hurban in Hlboké, the leaders of the Slovak national movement – Štúr, J. M. Hurban, and M.M. Hodža – agreed on how to codify the new Slovak language standard and how to introduce it to the public. On 17 July 1843, they visited Ján Hollý, an important writer and representative of the older Bernolák Slovak language standard, in Dobrá Voda and informed him about their plans. On 11 October 1843, although the committee did not find anything illegal about Štúr&#x27;s activities, Štúr was ordered to stop lecturing and was removed from the function of deputy for Prof. Palkovič. However, Štúr continued to give lectures. On 31 December 1843, he was definitively deprived of the function of deputy for Prof. Palkovič. As a result, in March 1844, 22 students left Pressburg in protest; 13 of them went to study at the Evangelical Lýceum in the town of Levoča (Lőcse). One of the supporting students was Janko Matuška, who took the opportunity to write a hymn, &quot;Nad Tatrou sa blýska&quot;, which later became the official anthem of the Slovak Republic.

From 1843 to 1847, Štúr worked as a private linguist. In 1844, he wrote &quot;Nárečja slovenskuo alebo potreba písaňja v tomto nárečí&quot; (&quot;The Slovak dialect or, the necessity of writing in this dialect&quot;). On 19 May 1844, a second &quot;Slovenský prestolný prosbopis&quot; was sent to Vienna, but had little influence. But in 1844, other Slovak authors (often Štúr&#x27;s students) started to use the new Slovak language standard. On 27 August, he participated in the founding convention of the Slovak association Tatrín, the first nationwide association.

On 1 August 1845, the first issue of &quot;Slovenskje národňje novini&quot; (&quot;Slovak National Newspaper&quot;, published until 9 June 1848) was published. One week later, its literary supplement, &quot;Orol Tatranský&quot; (&quot;The Tatra Eagle&quot;, published until 6 June 1848) was also published. In this newspaper, written in the new Slovak language, he gradually shaped a Slovak political program. He based this on the precept that the Slovaks were one nation, and that they therefore had a right to their own language, culture, schools – and particularly to political autonomy within Hungary. The projected expression of this autonomy was to be a Slovak Diet. Also that year, his brochure &quot;Das neunzehnte Jahrhundert und der Magyarismus&quot; (&quot;The 19th century and Magyarism&quot;), written in German, was published in Vienna.

=== Career in the Hungarian Diet ===

In 1846, Štúr got to know the well-situated noble family Ostrolúcky in Zemianske Podhradie (Nemesváralja), who later helped him to become a deputy in the Diet of Hungary in Pressburg. He also fell in love with Adela Ostrolúcka. In addition, his books &quot;Nárečja Slovenskuo alebo potreba písaňja v tomto nárečí&quot; (1844) and &quot;Nauka reči Slovenskej&quot; (&quot;The Theory of the Slovak language&quot;) were published in Pressburg. In &quot;Nárečia Slovenskuo&quot;, he rebutted Kollár&#x27;s concept of only four Slavic tribes (Russians, Poles, Czechoslovaks and Southern Slavs), and listed reasons for the introduction of the new language, which was based on central Slovak dialects and used phonetic spelling. In &quot;Nauka reči Slovenskej&quot;, he explained the grammar of the new language standard. In the same year, the upset Kollár and his followers published the compilation work &quot;Hlasové o potřebě jednoty spisovného jazyka pro Čechy, Moravany a Slováky&quot; (&quot;Voices in favour of the necessity of a unified literary language of the Czechs, Moravians and Slovaks&quot;), written in Czech.

In August 1847, at the 4th convention of the Tatrín association in Čachtice, Catholics and Protestants proclaimed that they &quot;definitively agree to use only the newly codified Štúr language standard&quot;. On 30 October 1847, he became an ablegate for the town of Zvolen (Zólyom) in the &quot;Parlamentum Publicum&quot; (Diet) in Pressburg. From 17 November 1847 to 13 March 1848, he gave five important speeches at the Diet, in which he demanded the abolition of serfdom in Hungary, the introduction of civil rights, and the use of the Slovak language in elementary schools. The Diet met only until 11 April 1848 due to the 1848 Revolution.

=== 1848/49 Revolution ===
On 1 April 1848 in Vienna, Štúr and his colleagues prepared the Slavic Congress of Prague. On 20 April 1848, he arrived in Prague on the invitation of the Czech J. V. Frič, where he won the support of Czech student members of the association Slávie, regarding his attempts to enforce the Slovak language. On 30 April 1848, he initiated the establishment of &quot;Slovanská lipa&quot; (Slavic linden tree) in Prague – an association aimed at promoting the mutual cooperation of Slavs.

In May 1848, he was a co-author of the official petition, &quot;Žiadosti slovenského národa&quot; (&quot;Requirements of the Slovak Nation&quot;). The &quot;Žiadosti slovenského národa&quot; were publicly declared in Liptovský Svätý Mikuláš, with Ján Francisci-Rimavský as the reader. In it, the Slovaks demanded autonomy within Hungary, proportional representation in the Hungarian Assembly, the creation of a Slovak Diet to administer their own region, for Slovak to become the official language, and for educational institutions at all levels to use Slovak. They also called for universal suffrage and democratic rights – e.g., freedom of the press and public assembly. They requested that peasants be released from serfdom, and that their lands be returned to them. But on 12 May 1848, the Hungarian government issued a warrant for the leaders of the Slovak movement: Štúr, Hurban, and Hodža. The persecuted Štúr arrived in Prague on 31 May 1848. On 2 June 1848, he participated in the Slavic Congress there.

On 19 June 1848, he went to Zagreb, Croatia, because the Slavic Congress was interrupted by fighting in Prague, and became an editor of the Croatian magazine &quot;Slavenski Jug&quot;. With financial support from some Serbs, he and J. M. Hurban started to prepare an uprising against the Hungarian government. The &quot;Slovak Uprising&quot; occurred between September 1848 and November 1849. In September 1848, Štúr travelled to Vienna and participated in preparations for the Slovak armed uprising. On 15–16 September 1848, the Slovak National Council, the supreme Slovak political and military organisation, consisting of Štúr, Hurban, and Hodža (as politicians), and the Czechs B. Bloudek, F. Zach, and B. Janeček (as military experts), was created in Vienna. On 19 September 1848 in Myjava, the Slovak National Council declared independence from the Hungarian government and called on the Slovak nation to start an armed uprising. However, the council only managed to control their local region.

Štúr, Hurban, and others met in Prague on 7 October 1848 to discuss how to proceed with the uprising. Upon his return to Vienna in November, Štúr (with a group of Slovak volunteers, on one of the so-called Volunteer Campaigns) traversed northern Hungary from Čadca (Csaca), arriving in Prešov (Eperjes) in March 1849. On 20 March 1849, he led a delegation to meet with the Austrian king in the Czech town of Olomouc and presented the demands of the Slovak nation. From March until June, Štúr – along with Hurban, Hodža, Bórik, Chalúpka, and others – negotiated in Vienna for a solution to the Slovak demands. But on 21 November 1849, the Slovak volunteer corps was officially demobilized in Pressburg, and the disappointed Štúr retreated to his parents&#x27; home in Uhrovec.

=== Later life ===
The later years of Štúr&#x27;s life saw him engage in further linguistic and literary work. In the autumn of 1850, he attempted but failed to receive a license to publish a Slovak national newspaper. In December of that year, he participated in a delegation to Vienna concerning Slovak schools and the Tatrín association. Several personal tragedies also occurred during his later life. His brother Karol died on 13 January 1851. Štúr moved into the house of Karol&#x27;s family in Modra (near Pressburg) to care for his seven children. He lived there under police supervision. On 27 July 1851, his father died, and his mother moved to Trenčín (Trencsén).

In October 1851, he participated in meetings in Pressburg concerning reforms of the codified Slovak language standard. The reforms, involving mainly a transition from the phonetic spelling to an etymological one, were later introduced by M. M. Hodža and Martin Hattala in 1851–1852, but Štúr, among others, also participated in the preparations. The result of these reforms was the Slovak language standard still in use today, with only some minor changes since then.

In Modra in 1852, Štúr finished his essay &quot;O národních písních a pověstech plemen slovanských&quot; (&quot;On national songs and myths of Slavic kin&quot;), written in Czech and published in Bohemia the next year. In addition, he wrote his important philosophical book, &quot;Das Slawenthum und die Welt der Zukunft&quot; (&quot;Slavdom and the world of the future&quot;), written in German, and published in Russian in 1867 and 1909 (subsequently published in German in 1931, and in Slovak in 1993). Among other things, he recapitulated the events that brought the Slovaks to the desperate situation of that time, and suggested cooperation with Russia as a solution, thus moving away from Slovak nationalism toward pan-Slavism.

In 1853, his platonic female friend, Adela, died in Vienna on 18 March. He also went to Trenčín to help care for his ill mother, until she died on 28 August. The only compilation of his poetry, &quot;Spevy a piesne&quot; (&quot;Singings and songs&quot;), was published in Pressburg that year. On 11 May 1854, he gave a speech at the unveiling of the Ján Hollý monument in Dobrá Voda (Ján Hollý having died in 1849). Štúr had also written a poem in his honour.

== Death ==
On 22 December 1855, Štúr accidentally shot and wounded himself during a hunt near Modra. In the last days of his life, he was mainly supported by his friend . On 12 January 1856, Ľudovít Štúr died in Modra. A national funeral was held there in his honour.

== Legacy ==
Štúr has been featured on Czechoslovak and Slovak banknotes throughout the 20th century. He has appeared on the Czechoslovak 50 Koruna note of 1987 and on the Slovakian 500 Koruna note since 1993.

The town of Parkan (Párkány in Hungarian) on the Hungarian border was renamed in his honour as Štúrovo in 1948.

The asteroid 3393 Štúr, about 9.6 km in diameter and discovered on 28 November by Milan Antal at the Hungarian observatory at Piszkéstető, is named after him.

He was known for opposing Jewish emancipation and promoting the belief that Slovak Jews cannot belong to the Slovak nation.

==Commemoration==
The Ľudovít Štúr Institute of Linguistics is named after Ľudovít Štúr.

<doc id="348177" wikidata="Q12063768" url="?curid=348177" title="Kerry Nettle">
<text>Kerry Michelle Nettle (born 24 December 1973) is a former Australian Senator and member of the Australian Greens in New South Wales. Elected at the 2001 federal election on a primary vote of 4.36 percent with One Nation and micro-party preferences, she failed to gain re-election at the 2007 federal election, despite an increase in the Green primary vote to 8.43 percent, due to insufficient preferences.

== Early life ==
Kerry Nettle was born 24 December 1973, in Sydney, to Edward and Beverley Nettle. She grew up in the suburb of Marsfield, and received her primary education at local government schools, and secondary education at the Presbyterian Ladies&#x27; College, Sydney in Croydon where she was elected school captain in her final year. Following graduation from high school in 1991, Nettle enrolled at the University of New South Wales, where she obtained a degree in environmental science and was active in student politics, caucusing with the group known as the Non-Aligned Left (the predecessor of the Grassroots Left). She worked as office coordinator for The Greens (NSW) and then as a youth worker. She joined the Australian Greens in 1998 and was elected to the Australian Senate for New South Wales in November 2001, joining Senator Bob Brown until her term expired on 30 June 2008.

Nettle is a social liberal and an environmentalist. She believes in Government ownership of essential services, which include banking, airlines, telecommunications, health and education, and other areas privatised in the last two decades in Australia. She argues that private ownership of these assets is &quot;social theft.&quot;

== Policies ==
=== Immigration and human rights ===
Nettle strongly supports the right of political refugees and asylum seekers to have a fair process and hearing in Australia. She visited Christmas Island in January 2006 in opposition to the Australian Government&#x27;s detention of 43 West Papuans that landed on Cape York in January 2006. She has expressed similar concern for the 83 Sri Lankan refugees that are being held in Nauru.

Nettle also fervently campaigned to bring David Hicks back to Australia. For six months, every day that the Australian Senate sat, she filed a motion to bring David Hicks back to Australia.

=== Iraq War ===

When United States President George W. Bush visited Canberra on 23 October 2003, Nettle and Brown took their opposition to the war in Iraq to the point of interjecting during his address to a joint sitting of the two Houses of Parliament. They wore signs referring to David Hicks and Mamdouh Habib, two Australian citizens who were then being held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, following their apprehension by United States forces in either (this is disputed) Afghanistan or Pakistan. Both Habib and Hicks have since been released.

Bush accepted the interjections with good humour, but the Speaker of the House, Neil Andrew, formally &quot;named&quot; Nettle and Brown and they were suspended from the Parliament for 24 hours. Nettle tried to hand Bush a letter from Habib&#x27;s wife but was stopped by Liberal MPs and Senators who jostled her and prevented her from approaching Bush. Liberal Senator Ross Lightfoot allegedly told Nettle to &quot;Fuck off and die.&quot;

=== Israeli-Palestinian conflict ===
Nettle visited Israel and the Palestinian territories in January 2007, where she examined &quot;what impact the construction of the separation wall and the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict has on communities in Palestine and Israel&quot;. Nettle spoke with both Israelis and Palestinians in an effort to understand and ameliorate conflicts between both groups.

=== Education ===
Nettle remains an ardent advocate of increased public education and higher education funding. Specifically, she has also &quot;identified the need for $7 billion in public education spending across the lifelong spectrum of education, from preschool through to university and TAFE tertiary education.&quot;

=== Women&#x27;s rights ===
Nettle supports gender equality, as well as a women&#x27;s reproductive rights. During a debate on the abortion drug RU486 in February 2006, she wore a T-shirt into parliament bearing the slogan &quot;Mr Abbott get your rosaries off my ovaries&quot;, in reference to the Catholic faith of Health Minister Tony Abbott.

<doc id="348200" wikidata="Q1416458" url="?curid=348200" title="Stand on Zanzibar">
<text>Stand on Zanzibar is a dystopian New Wave science fiction novel written by John Brunner and first in part published in &quot;NEW WORLDS&quot; in 1967 and in book form in 1968. The book won a Hugo Award for Best Novel at the 27th World Science Fiction Convention in 1969, as well as the 1969 BSFA Award and the 1973 Prix Tour-Apollo Award.

==Description==
The novel is about overpopulation and its projected consequences. The story is set in 2010, mostly in the United States. The narrative follows the lives of a large cast of characters, chosen to give a broad cross-section of the future world. Some of these interact directly with the central narrative, while others add depth to Brunner&#x27;s world. Brunner appropriated this narrative technique from the &quot;U.S.A.&quot; trilogy, by John Dos Passos.

The main story is about two New York men, Donald Hogan and Norman Niblock House, who share an apartment. House is a rising executive at General Technics, one of the powerful corporations. Using his &quot;Afram&quot; (African American) heritage to advance his position, he has risen to vice-president at age twenty-six.

The two plots concern the fictional African state of Beninia making a deal with General Technics to take over the management of their country, to speed up development from Third World to First World status. A second plot is a breakthrough in genetic engineering in the fictional Southeast Asian nation of Yatakang (an island nation and a former Dutch colony, like Indonesia), to which Hogan is soon sent by the United States government to investigate. The two plots cross, bringing potential implications for the world.

The title &quot;Stand on Zanzibar&quot; is an allusion to a thought experiment in which it was calculated that all the human beings in the world could fit shoulder to shoulder on the Isle of Wight; given population growth, Brunner expanded this to the island of Zanzibar.

==Characters==
* Norman Niblock House, VP of HR at General Technics 
* Donald Hogan, &quot;synthesist&quot; and spy
* Georgette Tallon Buckfast, &quot;Old GT&quot;, founder of General Technics, 91 years old, but looking 60, her body containing many artificial parts.
* Zadkiel F. Obomi, President of Beninia
* Elihu Rodan Masters, US Ambassador to Beninia
* Professor Doctor Sugaiguntung, university department head in Yatakang
* Stallion &quot;Stal&quot; Lucas, a yonderboy
* Olive Almeiro, baby farmer in Puerto Rico
* Jeff Young, vendor of explosives and sabotage equipment
* Henry Butcher
* Chad C. Mulligan, former sociologist
* Jogajong, revolutionary
* Pierre Clodard, Jeannine Clodard, siblings, of pied-noir heritage
* Eric Ellerman, plant geneticist
* Poppy Shelton
* Gerry Lindt, draftee
* Guinevere Steele, née Dwiggins
* Sheena Potter, Frank Potter
* Victor Whatmough, Mary Whatmough, married
* Sasha Peterson, Philip Peterson, mother and son
* Pope Eglantine, Pope Thomas, rival popes
* Grace Rowley, 77, early dementia
* Arthur Golightly
* Bennie Noakes, addict, watches TV
* Mr and Mrs Everywhere, construct identities, like the Joneses

==Critical reception==
Algis Budrys declared that &quot;Stand on Zanzibar&quot; &quot;takes your breath away&quot;, saying that the novel &quot;put[s] itself together seemingly without effort [and] paints a picture of the immediate future as it will, Brunner convinces you, certainly be&quot;. James Blish said &quot;I disliked everybody in it and I was constantly impeded by the suspicion that Brunner was not writing for himself but for a Prize. ...A man of Brunner&#x27;s gifts should have seen &quot;ab initio&quot; that &quot;U.S.A.&quot; was a stillbirth even in its originator&#x27;s hands&quot;.

Thirty years after its publication, Greg Bear praised &quot;Stand on Zanzibar&quot; as a science fiction novel that, unusually, has not become dated. &quot;It&#x27;s not quite the future we imagined it to be, but it still reads as fresh as it did back in 1968, and that&#x27;s an amazing accomplishment!&quot; In a retrospective review for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2010, Sam Jordison found the novel a &quot;skilfully realised future dystopia&quot;, writing that it allowed Brunner &quot;to express his most interesting ideas regarding corporate ethics, free will, the question of whether scientific progress is always good for humanity and the conflict between the individual and the state&quot;. Ursula K. Heise declared that &quot;&quot;Stand on Zanzibar&quot;, to some extent, sets the tone for literary texts from the 1980s and 1990s that re-engage the issue of population growth against the background of a multitude of interacting political, social, economic, ecological, and technological problems&quot;.

In his 2021 book &quot;Doom: The Politics of Catastrophe&quot;, historian Niall Ferguson lauds &quot;Stand on Zanzibar&quot; for foreseeing the future better than more popular novels such as &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;, &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; and &quot;Anthem&quot;.
Yet, on further reflection, none of these authors truly foresaw all the peculiarities of our networked world, which has puzzlingly combined a rising speed and penetration of consumer information technology with a slackening of progress in other areas, such as nuclear energy, and a woeful degeneration of governance. The real prophets turn out, on closer inspection, to be less familiar figures—for example, John Brunner, whose &quot;Stand on Zanzibar&quot; (1968) is set in 2010, at a time when population pressure has led to widening social divisions and political extremism. Despite the threat of terrorism, U.S. corporations like General Technics are booming, thanks to a supercomputer named Shalmaneser. China is America&#x27;s new rival. Europe has united. Brunner also foresees affirmative action, genetic engineering, Viagra, Detroit&#x27;s collapse, satellite TV, in-flight video, gay marriage, laser printing, electric cars, the de-criminalization of marijuana, and the decline of tobacco. There is even a progressive president (albeit of Beninia, not America) named &quot;Obomi&quot;.
In a 2021 article regarding the prognostic ability of novelists, &quot;The Guardian&quot; pointed out that &quot;Stand on Zanzibar&quot; had also accurately predicted the fall of the Detroit auto industry.

Jonathan Nolan was partially inspired by &quot;Stand on Zanzibar&quot; in developing the content for the third season of the television show &quot;Westworld&quot;.

<doc id="348202" wikidata="Q477918" url="?curid=348202" title="Aedes albopictus">
<text>Aedes albopictus (synonym Stegomyia albopicta), from the mosquito (Culicidae) family, also known as the (Asian) tiger mosquito or forest mosquito, is a mosquito native to the tropical and subtropical areas of Southeast Asia. In the past few centuries, however, this species has spread to many countries through the transport of goods and international travel. It is characterized by the white bands on its legs and body.

This mosquito has become a significant pest in many communities because it closely associates with humans (rather than living in wetlands), and typically flies and feeds in the daytime in addition to at dusk and dawn. The insect is called a tiger mosquito as it has stripes, as does a tiger. &quot;Ae. albopictus&quot; is an epidemiologically important vector for the transmission of many viral pathogens, including the yellow fever virus, dengue fever, and Chikungunya fever, as well as several filarial nematodes such as &quot;Dirofilaria immitis&quot;. &quot;Aedes albopictus&quot; is capable of hosting the Zika virus and is considered a potential vector for Zika transmission among humans.

==Description==

===Name and systematics===
In 1894, a British-Australian entomologist, Frederick A. Askew Skuse, was the first to scientifically describe the Asian tiger mosquito, which he named &quot;Culex albopictus&quot; (lat. &#x27; &quot;gnat&quot;, &quot;midge&quot; and &#x27; &quot;white-painted&quot;). Later, the species was assigned to the genus &quot;Aedes&quot; (gr. , &quot;unpleasant&quot;) and referred to as &quot;Aedes albopictus&quot;. Like the yellow fever mosquito, it belongs to the subgenus &quot;Stegomyia&quot; (Gr. , &quot;covered, roofed&quot;, referring to the scales that completely cover the dorsal surface in this subgenus, and , &quot;fly&quot;) within the genus &quot;Aedes&quot;. In 2004, scientists explored higher-level relationships and proposed a new classification within the genus &quot;Aedes&quot; and &quot;Stegomyia&quot; was elevated to the genus level, making &quot;Aedes albopictus&quot; now &quot;Stegomyia albopicta&quot;. This is, however, a controversial matter, and the use of &quot;Stegomyia albopicta&quot; versus &quot;Aedes albopictus&quot; is continually debated.

===Characteristics===
The adult Asian tiger mosquito is less than long from end to end with a striking white and black pattern. The variation of the body size in adult mosquitoes depends on the density of the larval population and food supply within the breeding water. Since these circumstances are seldom optimal, the average body size of adult mosquitoes is considerably smaller than 10 mm. For example, the average length of the abdomen was calculated to be , the wings , and the proboscis .

The males are roughly 20% smaller than the females, but they are morphologically very similar. However, as in all mosquito species, the antennae of the males in comparison to the females are noticeably bushier and contain auditory receptors to detect the characteristic whine, almost inaudible to humans, of the female. The maxillary palps of the males are also longer than their proboscis, whereas the females&#x27; maxillary palps are much shorter. (This is typical for the males of the Culicinae.) In addition, the tarsus of the hind legs of the males is more silvery. Tarsomere IV is roughly 75% silver in the males whereas the females&#x27; is only about 60% silver.

The other characteristics do not differentiate between sexes. A single silvery-white line of tight scales begins between the eyes and continues down the dorsal side of the thorax. This characteristic marking is the easiest and surest way to identify the Asian tiger mosquito.

The proboscis is dark colored, the upper surface of the end segment of the palps is covered in silvery scales, and the labium does not feature a light line on its underside. The compound eyes are distinctly separated from one another. The scute, the dorsal portion of an insect&#x27;s thoracic segment, is black alongside the characteristic white midline. On the side of the thorax, the scutellum, and the abdomen are numerous spots covered in white-silvery scales.

Such white-silvery scales can also be found on the tarsus, particularly on the hind legs that are commonly suspended in the air. The bases of tarsomeres I through IV have a ring of white scales, creating the appearance of white and black rings. On the forelegs and middle legs, only the first three tarsomeres have the ring of white scales, whereas tarsomere V on the hind legs is completely white. The femur of each leg is also black with white scales on the end of the &quot;knee&quot;. The femora of the middle legs do not feature a silver line on the base of the upper side, whereas, the femora on the hind legs have short white lines on base of the upper side. The tibiae are black on the base and have no white scales.

The terga on segments II through VI of the abdomen are dark and have an almost triangular silvery-white marking on the base that is not aligned with the silvery bands of scales on the ventral side of the abdomen. The triangular marking and the silvery band are only aligned on abdominal segment VII. The transparent wings have white spots on the base of the costae. With older mosquito specimens, the scales could be partially worn off, making these characteristics not stand out as much.

As with other members of the mosquito family, the female is equipped with an elongated proboscis that she uses to collect blood to feed her eggs. The Asian tiger mosquito has a rapid bite and an agility that allows it to escape most attempts by people to swat it. By contrast, the male member of the species primarily feeds on nectar and does not bite.

The female lays her eggs near water, not directly into it as other mosquitoes do, but typically near a stagnant pool. However, any open container containing water will suffice for larvae development, even with less than of water. It can also breed in running water, so stagnant pools of water are not its only breeding sites. It is more likely to lay eggs in water sources near flowers than in water sources without flowers. It has a short flight range (less than ), so breeding sites are likely to be close to where this mosquito is found.

Other mosquito species may be visually confused with the tiger mosquito. Comparison with approved pictures is the best way to determine the species with certainty. Behavioral cues like almost-silent flight and difficulty in catching combined with knowledge of the range of local endemic mosquitoes may also aid this process.

===Similar species===
Some mosquitoes in North America, such as &quot;Ochlerotatus canadensis&quot;, have a similar leg pattern. In North and South America, &quot;Ae. albopictus&quot; can be distinguished from &quot;Aedes taeniorhynchus&quot; since only &quot;Ae. albopictus&quot; has back markings.

In Europe, the mosquito &quot;Culiseta annulata&quot;, which is very common, but does not occur in high densities, can be mistaken for an Asian tiger mosquito because of its black-and-white-ringed legs. However, this species is missing the distinctive white line that runs from the middle of its head and down the thorax. It is also considerably larger than &quot;Ae. albopictus&quot;, is not black and white, but rather beige and grey striped, and has wings with noticeable veins and four dark, indistinct spots. The tree hole mosquito or &quot;Aedes geniculatus&quot; – a native to Europe and North Africa – has also been mistaken for &quot;Ae. albopictus.&quot; This is because the tree hole mosquito has very white scales on a very similar body.

In the eastern Mediterranean area, &quot;Ae. albopictus&quot; species can be mistaken for &quot;Aedes cretinus&quot;, which also belongs to the subgenus &quot;Stegomyia&quot; and uses similar breeding waters. &quot;Aedes cretinus&quot; also has a white stripe on the scute, but it ends shortly before the abdomen, and also has two additional stripes to the left and right of the middle stripe. So far &quot;Aedes cretinus&quot; is only located in Cyprus, Greece, North Macedonia, Georgia and Turkey.

In Asia, the Asian tiger mosquito can be mistaken for other members of the subgenus &quot;Stegomyia&quot;, particularly the yellow fever mosquito &quot;Aedes aegypti&quot; (the most prevalent species in the tropics and subtropics), because both species display a similar black and white pattern. It can be hard to distinguish &quot;Ae. albopictus&quot; from the closely related &quot;Aedes scutellaris&quot; (India, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and the Philippines), &quot;Aedes pseudoalbopictus&quot; (India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam) and &quot;Aedes seatoi&quot; (Thailand).

===Diet and host location===
Like other mosquito species, only the females require a blood meal to develop their eggs. Apart from that, they feed on nectar and other sweet plant juices just as the males do. In regards to host location, carbon dioxide and organic substances produced from the host, humidity, and optical recognition play important roles.

The search for a host takes place in two phases. First, the mosquito exhibits a nonspecific searching behavior until it perceives host stimulants, whereupon it secondly takes a targeted approach. For catching tiger mosquitoes with special traps, carbon dioxide and a combination of chemicals that naturally occur in human skin (fatty acids, ammonia, and lactic acid) are the most attractive.

The Asian tiger mosquito particularly bites in forests during the day, so has been known as the forest day mosquito. Depending upon region and biotype, activity peaks differ, but for the most part, they rest during the morning and night hours. They search for their hosts inside and outside human dwellings, but are particularly active outside. The size of the blood meal depends upon the size of the mosquito, but it is usually around 2 μl. Their bites are not necessarily painful, but they are more noticeable than those from other kinds of mosquitoes. Tiger mosquitoes generally tend to bite a human host more than once if they are able to.

&quot;Ae. albopictus&quot; also bites other mammals besides humans, as well as birds. The females are always on the search for a host and are persistent but cautious when it comes to their blood meal and host location. Their blood meal is often broken off before enough blood has been ingested for the development of their eggs, so Asian tiger mosquitoes bite multiple hosts during their development cycle of the egg, making them particularly efficient at transmitting diseases. The mannerism of biting diverse host species enables the Asian tiger mosquito to be a potential bridge vector for certain pathogens that can jump species boundaries, for example the West Nile virus.

===Natural enemies===
Primarily, other mosquito larvae, flatworms, swimming beetles, fungi, ciliates, paramecia, protozoans which act as parasites, predatory copepods, and spiders are natural enemies of the larval stage of Asian tiger mosquitoes.
&quot;Toxorhynchites&quot; larvae, a mosquito genus that does not suck blood, feeds upon other mosquito larvae and are often found with tiger mosquito larvae. Flatworms and small swimming beetles are considered natural predators.

Fungi from the genus &quot;Coelomomyces&quot; (order Blastocladiales) develop inside the visceral cavity of mosquito larvae. The species &quot;Coelomomyces stegomyiae&quot; was first found on the Asian tiger mosquito.

Paramecia, or ciliates, can also affect &quot;Ae. albopictus&quot; larvae, and the first detected species was &quot;Lambornella stegomyiae&quot; (Hymenostomatida: Tetrahymenidae). The virulence, mortality rate, and subsequent possibilities of &quot;Lambornella&quot; being implemented as a biological remedy to control &quot;Ae. albopictus&quot;, however, has conflicting views.

Sporozoans of the genus &quot;Ascogregarina&quot; (Lecudinidae) infect the larval stage of mosquitoes. The species &quot;Ascogregarina taiwanensis&quot; was found in Asian tiger mosquitoes. When the adult mosquitoes emerge from their pupal case, they leave the infectious intermediary stage of parasites in the water and close off the infection cycle. Infected adults are generally smaller than non-infected adults and have an insignificantly higher mortality rate; therefore, food supply and larval density apparently play a role. In competitive situations, an infection with sporozoans can also reduce the biological fitness of other uninfected mosquitoes. However, the use of the parasites as an effective biological remedy to control mosquito populations is implausible because the host must reach the adult stage for the transmission of the parasites.

Though they do not commonly occur in the natural habitats of Asian tiger mosquitoes, predatory copepods from the family Cyclopidae seem to willingly feed on them given the opportunity. Relatives of different genera could therefore present a possibility in the control of tiger mosquitoes.

Predators of adult &quot;Ae. albopictus&quot; in Malaysia include various spider species. Up to 90% of the gathered spiders from rubber plantations and a cemetery fed upon Asian tiger mosquitoes. Whether the spiders would have an effect on the mosquito population is still unclear. Tiger mosquitoes were abundantly present despite the existence of the spiders.

==Distribution==
===Climatic adaptations===

The Asian tiger mosquito originally came from Southeast Asia. In 1966, parts of Asia and the island of India and the Pacific Ocean were denoted as the area of circulation for the Asian tiger mosquito. &quot;Ae. albopictus&quot; as a native to tropical and subtropical regions with warm and humid climate, is active all year long; however, it has been adapting successfully to cooler, temperate regions, where they hibernate over winter. Eggs from strains in the temperate zones are more tolerant to the cold than ones from warmer regions. The species can even tolerate snow and temperatures under freezing. Adult tiger mosquitoes can survive throughout winter in suitable microhabitats.

===Invasive species===
Since the mid-1960s, the tiger mosquito has spread to Europe, the Americas, the Caribbean, Africa, and the Middle East. As of 2008 &quot;Ae. albopictus&quot; was one of the 100 world&#x27;s worst invasive species according to the Global Invasive Species Database.

As of 2006, &quot;Ae. albopictus&quot; was not native to Australia and New Zealand. The species was introduced there multiple times, but has yet to establish itself. This is due to the well-organized entomological surveillance programs in the harbors and airports of these countries. Nevertheless, as of 2006 it has become domestic on the islands in the Torres Strait between Queensland, Australia, and New Guinea.

In Europe, Asian tiger mosquitos first emerged in Albania in 1979, introduced through a shipment of goods from China. In 1990–1991, they were most likely brought to Italy in used tires from Georgia (USA), and since then have spread throughout the entire mainland of Italy, as well as parts of Sicily and Sardinia. Since 1999, they have established themselves on the mainland of France, primarily southern France. In 2002, they were also discovered in a vacation town on the island of Corsica, but did not completely establish themselves there until 2005. In Belgium, they were detected in 2000 and 2013, in 2001 in Montenegro, 2003 in Canton Ticino in southern Switzerland, and Greece, 2004 in Spain and Croatia, 2005 in the Netherlands and Slovenia, 2006 in Bosnia and Herzegovina and 2022 in Cyprus. In the fall of 2007, the first tiger mosquito eggs were discovered in Rastatt (Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany). Shortly before, they were found in the northern Alps of Switzerland in Canton Aargau. Since 2010, it has also been sighted increasingly in Malta during summer. In September 2016, Public Health England found eggs, though no mosquitos, in a lorry park at Folkestone service station on the M20, near Westenhanger, which is 6 miles West of the Eurotunnel. The Swiss Autobahns are especially of concern. Governments and universities in Switzerland cooperate every year to monitor the invasion using traps at Autobahn rest stations, and also at airports and commercial hubs. In Slovakia, two independent observations events have been observed in recent years: first in 2012 near Košice and the second in 2023 in the populated Ružinov borough of Bratislava. The species had failed to settle during the first occurrence but had likely settled in the latter, increasing the risk of concern for public health and safety.

In the United States, this species invaded the Southern United States in the 1980s and rapidly spread northward into novel climate compared to its native range. It was initially found in 1983 in Memphis, Tennessee. then at the Port of Houston in a 1985 shipment of used tires, and spread across the South up the East Coast to become prevalent in the Northeast. It was not discovered in Southern California until 2001, then eradicated for over a decade; however, by 2011, it was again being found in Los Angeles County traps, then over the next two years expanded its range to Kern County and San Diego County.
, North American land favoring the environmental conditions of the Asian tiger mosquito was expected to more than triple in size in the coming 20 years, especially in urban areas. &quot;Aedes albopictus&quot; mosquitoes have been identified in 1,368 counties in 40 U.S states. A 2019 study in Nature Microbiology that modeled expansion of &quot;Aedes albopictus&quot; due to climate change, urbanization, and human movement found that the species would likely continue to spread throughout the coming decades.

In Latin America, the Asian tiger mosquito was first discovered 1986 in Brazil and in 1988 in Argentina and Mexico, as well. Other parts of Latin America where the Asian tiger mosquito was discovered are the Dominican Republic in 1993, Bolivia, Cuba, Honduras, and Guatemala in 1995, El Salvador in 1996, Paraguay in 1999, Panama in 2002, and Uruguay and Nicaragua in 2003.

In Africa, the species was first detected in 1990 in South Africa. In Nigeria, it has been domestic since at least 1991. It spread to Cameroon in 1999/2000, to the Bioko Island of Equatorial Guinea in 2001, and to Gabon in 2006.

In the Middle East, the species was detected in Lebanon in 2003 and in Syria in 2005; the first record in Israel was published in 2003.
===Competition with established species===
&quot;Ae. albopictus&quot; can outcompete and even eradicate other species with similar breeding habitats from the very start of its dispersal to other regions and biotopes. In Kolkata, for example, it was observed in the 1960s that egg depositing containers were being settled by the Asian tiger mosquito in city districts where the malaria mosquito (genus &quot;Anopheles&quot;) and yellow fever mosquito (&quot;Aedes aegypti&quot;) had both been eliminated by the application of DDT. This may be because primarily the inner walls of the houses were treated with DDT to kill the mosquitoes resting there and fight the malaria mosquito. The yellow fever mosquito also lingers particularly in the inside of buildings and would have been also affected. The Asian tiger mosquito rests in the vicinity of human dwellings would therefore have an advantage over the other two species. In other cases where the yellow fever mosquito was repressed by the Asian tiger mosquito, for instance in Florida, this explanation does not fit. Other hypotheses include competition in the larval breeding waters, differences in metabolism and reproductive biology, or a major susceptibility to sporozoans (Apicomplexa).

Another species which was suppressed by the migrating &quot;Ae. albopictus&quot; was &quot;Ae. guamensis&quot; in Guam.

The Asian tiger mosquito is similar, in terms of its close socialization with humans, to the common house mosquito (&quot;Culex pipiens&quot;). Among other differences in their biology, &quot;Culex pipiens&quot; prefers larger breeding waters and is more tolerant to cold. In this respect, no significant competition or suppression between the two species likely occurs.

A possible competition among mosquito species that all lay their eggs in knotholes and other similar places (&quot;Ae. cretinus&quot;, &quot;Ae. geniculatus&quot;, and &quot;Anopheles plumbeus&quot;) has yet to be observed.

In Europe, the Asian tiger mosquito apparently covers an extensive new niche. This means that no native, long-established species conflict with the dispersal of &quot;Ae. albopictus&quot;.

==Role as disease vector==
===For humans===
&quot;Ae. albopictus&quot; is known to transmit pathogens and viruses, such as the yellow fever, dengue fever, Chikungunya fever, and Usutu virus. There is some evidence supporting the role of &quot;Ae. albopictus&quot; in the transmission of Zika virus, which is primarily transmitted by the related &quot;Ae. aegypti&quot;.

The Asian tiger mosquito was responsible for the Chikungunya epidemic on the French Island La Réunion in 2005–2006. By September 2006, an estimated 266,000 people were infected with the virus, and 248 fatalities occurred on the island. The Asian tiger mosquito was also the transmitter of the virus in the first outbreak of Chikungunya fever on the European continent. This outbreak occurred in the Italian province of Ravenna in the summer of 2007, and infected over 200 people. Evidently, mutated strains of the Chikungunya virus are being directly transmitted through &quot;Ae. albopictus&quot; particularly well and in such a way that another dispersal of the disease in regions with the Asian tiger mosquito is feared.

On the basis of experimental evidence and probability estimates, the likelihood of mechanical or biological transmission of HIV by insects is virtually nonexistent.

===For animals===
The tiger mosquito is relevant to veterinary medicine. For example, tiger mosquitoes are transmitters of &quot;Dirofilaria immitis&quot;, a parasitic roundworm that causes heart failure in dogs and cats.

===For arthropods===
&quot;Wolbachia&quot; infection are the most common infection in arthropods today, and over 40% of arthropods have contracted it. &quot;Wolbachia&quot; can be transmitted from parent to offspring or between breeding individuals. &quot;Wolbachia&quot; is easily transmitted within the &quot;Ae. albopictus&quot; mosquito due to the effects it has on fecundity in females. Once female Asian tiger mosquitos have contracted the infection, they produce more eggs, give birth more frequently, and live longer than uninfected females. In this way, &quot;Wolbachia&quot; provides a fitness advantage to the infected females and prevents uninfected females from reproducing. This allows control of the spread of diseases that many species carry by suppressing reproduction of the individuals with the harmful disease, but without the &quot;Wolbachia&quot; infection. &quot;Wolbachia&quot; can also be used to transfer certain genes into the population to further control the spread of diseases.

====Cytoplasmic incompatibility====
In the natural environment, &quot;Wolbachia&quot; and the Asian tiger mosquito are in a symbiotic relationship, so both species benefit from each other and can evolve together. The relationship between &quot;Wolbachia&quot; and its host might not have always been mutualistic, as &quot;Drosophila&quot; populations once experienced decreased fecundity in infected females, suggesting that &quot;Wolbachia&quot; evolved over time so that infected individuals would actually reproduce much more. The mechanism by which &quot;Wolbachia&quot; is inherited through maternal heredity is called cytoplasmic incompatibility. This changes the gamete cells of males and females, making some individuals unable to mate with each other. Although little is known about why cytoplasmic incompatibility exists, &quot;Wolbachia&quot; infection creates a fitness advantage for infected females, as they can mate with either infected or uninfected males. Despite this, infected males cannot reproduce with uninfected females. Therefore, over time, a population exposed to &quot;Wolbachia&quot; transitions from a few infected individuals to all individuals becoming infected, as the males that cannot reproduce successfully do not contribute to future generations. This is called population replacement, where the population&#x27;s overall genotype is replaced by a new genotype. This shows how populations of Asian tiger mosquitoes can vary in number of &quot;Wolbachia&quot;-infected individuals, based on how often the infection is transmitted. Due to &quot;Wolbachia&#x27;s&quot; ability to transmit from one host to the next, it can change the average genotype of a population, potentially reducing the population&#x27;s gene flow with other nearby populations.

====Unidirectional cytoplasmic incompatibility====
This type of cytoplasmic incompatibility where an infected male cannot reproduce successfully with an uninfected female is called unidirectional cytoplasmic incompatibility. It occurs because &quot;Wolbachia&quot; modifies the paternal chromosomes during sperm development, leading to complications for these offspring during embryonic development.

====Bidirectional cytoplasmic incompatibility====
Also, bidirectional cytoplasmic incompatibility occurs when an infected male carrying one strain of &quot;Wolbachia&quot; reproduces with an infected female carrying a different strain of &quot;Wolbachia&quot;. This also results in failed reproduction. Bidirectional cytoplasmic incompatibility also has evolutionary implications for populations of &quot;Ae. albopictus&quot; and other vectors of the infection. This is because bidirectional cytoplasmic incompatibility in &quot;Wolbachia&quot; creates unviable offspring, reducing gene flow between two populations, which can eventually lead to speciation.

==Control and suppression==

&quot;Ae. albopictus&quot; is very difficult to suppress or to control due to its remarkable ability to adapt to various environments, its close contact with humans, and its reproductive biology.

The containment of infestations is generally effected by public health services through area-wide integrated control plans, which aim to reduce the nuisance perceived by populations and the risks of viraemic transmission. Such plans consist of different activities that include entomological surveillance, larvicide treatments in public and private areas, information campaigns, and treatments against adult mosquitoes in the zones affected by suspected cases of transmissible viruses.

Efficient monitoring or surveillance is essential to prevent the spread and establishment of this species. In addition to the monitoring of ports, warehouses with imported plants, and stockpiles of tires, rest areas on highways and train stations should be monitored with appropriate methods.

=== Stagnant water removal ===
The control of Asian tiger mosquitoes begins with destroying the places where they lay their eggs, which are never far from where people are being bitten, since they are weak fliers, with only about a lifetime flying radius. Puddles that last more than three days, sagging or plugged roof gutters, old tires holding water, litter, and any other possible containers or pools of standing water should be drained or removed. Bird baths, inlets to sewers and drainage systems holding stagnant water, flower pots, standing flower vases, knotholes, and other crevices that can collect water should be filled with sand or fine gravel to prevent mosquitoes from laying their eggs in them.

Any standing water in pools, catchment basins, etc., that cannot be drained, or dumped, can be periodically treated with properly labeled insecticides or &quot;Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis&quot; (Bti), often formed into doughnut-shaped &quot;mosquito dunks&quot;. Bti produces toxins which are effective in killing larvae of mosquitoes and certain other dipterans, while having almost no effect on other organisms. Bti preparations are readily available at farm, garden, and pool suppliers.

Flowing water will not be a breeding spot, and water that contains minnows is not usually a problem, because the fish eat the mosquito larvae.

=== Dragonflies ===
Adult and nymphal dragonflies have been proposed as biological control of mosquito species. Dragonfly nymphs eat mosquito larvae, at least in laboratory conditions, though studies of wild dragonfly diets have not shown mosquitoes to be part of dragonfly nymph diets. A study of adult dragonfly diets in Europe showed that adult mosquitoes were not an important food source.


=== Ovitraps ===
In any case, an efficient surveillance is essential to monitor the presence of tiger mosquitoes and the effect of control programs. Ovitraps are normally used for the monitoring of &quot;Ae. albopictus&quot;. They are black water containers with floating Styrofoam blocks or small wooden paddles that are in contact with the surface of the water. Female tiger mosquitoes lay their eggs on these surfaces. Through the identification of these eggs or of the larvae that hatch from these eggs in the laboratory, the presence and abundance of mosquito species can be estimated. Versions of these traps with an adhesive film (sticky traps) that catch the egg-depositing mosquitoes make the analysis much easier and quicker, but are more complicated in terms of handling. The results of ovitraps are often variable and depend on the availability of alternative egg-depositing waters. Due to this, it is best to use them in large numbers and in conjunction with other monitoring methods.

To date, few effective traps for adult Asian tiger mosquitoes are available. Those traps that catch other species of mosquitoes do not catch tiger mosquitoes efficiently. A form of an ovitrap called a lethal ovitrap mimics the breeding site for &quot;Ae. albopictus&quot; just like the monitoring tool, but it has the added benefit of containing chemicals that are toxic to the mosquitoes when they enter, but do not harm humans. These traps have had success in some countries to control &quot;Aedes&quot; mosquito populations. A new trap type has now been shown to catch significant numbers of &quot;Ae. albopictus&quot;. This device, with the help of a ventilator, produces an upward air current of ammonia, fatty acids, and lactic acids that takes a similar form and smell of a human body. With the addition of carbon dioxide, the efficacy of the trap is increased. This means a suitable tool is available for trapping adult tiger mosquitoes, and for example, examining the existence of viruses in the trapped mosquitoes. Previously, the mosquitoes had to be collected from volunteers to be studied, which is ethically questionable, especially during epidemics. Recent research also indicates this trap type may also have a use as a control tool; in a study in Cesena, Italy, the number of biting tiger mosquitoes was reduced in places where traps were installed.

An amino acid substitution mutation –  – is overwhelmingly the most common voltage-gated sodium channel in &quot;A. albopictus&quot; in Singapore. This channel being the target of pyrethroids, this is suspected to be a knockdown resistance (&quot;kdr&quot;) mutation, and that that is the reason for its prevalence.

==Public health benefits==
Although the &quot;Wolbachia&quot; infection is prevalent in arthropod species, especially the Asian tiger mosquito, it is a useful mechanism for inhibiting the spread of dengue. &quot;Ae. aegypti&quot; individuals, a close relative of &quot;Ae. albopictus&quot;, with an artificial &quot;Wolbachia&quot; infection, cannot transmit dengue, an infectious virus, but they can pass on the &quot;Wolbachia&quot; infection to other populations. This could lead to many more discoveries in disease control for &quot;Ae. albopictus&quot; and other mosquito species. In addition, due to the cytoplasmic incompatibility caused by &quot;Wolbachia&quot;, the artificial infection of males can serve as a biological control as they are unable to reproduce successfully with uninfected females (unidirectional CI). When artificially infected males are unable to reproduce, the population size can be controlled, thereby reducing the transmission of the harmful disease of interest. Artificial infection of males is achieved by the removal of cytoplasm from infected oocytes, which is then transferred into embryos prior to the blastoderm stage.

<doc id="348221" wikidata="Q255032" url="?curid=348221" title="Hugo Award for Best Novel">
<text>The Hugo Award for Best Novel is one of the Hugo Awards given each year for science fiction or fantasy stories published in, or translated to, English during the previous calendar year. The novel award is available for works of fiction of 40,000 words or more; awards are also given out in the short story, novelette, and novella categories. The Hugo Awards have been described as &quot;a fine showcase for speculative fiction&quot;, and &quot;the best known literary award for science fiction writing&quot;.

The Hugo Award for Best Novel has been awarded annually by the World Science Fiction Society since 1953, except in 1954 and 1957. In addition, beginning in 1996, Retrospective Hugo Awards or &quot;Retro-Hugos&quot; have been available for works published 50, 75, or 100 years prior. Retro-Hugos may only be awarded for years after 1939 in which no awards were originally given. Retro-Hugo awards have been given for novels for 1939, 1941, 1943–1946, 1951, and 1954.

Hugo Award nominees and winners are chosen by supporting or attending members of the annual World Science Fiction Convention, or &quot;Worldcon&quot;, and the presentation evening constitutes its central event. The final selection process is defined in the World Science Fiction Society Constitution as instant-runoff voting with six nominees, except in the case of a tie. The novels on the ballot are the six most-nominated by members that year, with no limit on the number of stories that can be nominated. The 1953, 1955, and 1958 awards did not include a recognition of runner-up novels, but since 1959 all final candidates have been recorded. Initial nominations are made by members from January through March, while voting on the ballot of six nominations is performed roughly from April through July, subject to change depending on when that year&#x27;s Worldcon is held. Prior to 2017, the final ballot was five works; it was changed that year to six, with each initial nominator limited to five nominations. Worldcons are generally held in August or early September, and are held in a different city around the world each year.

During the 78 nomination years, 169 authors have had works nominated and 54 have won (including co-authors, ties, and Retro-Hugos). Two translators have been noted along with the author of a novel written in a language other than English: Ken Liu, in 2015 and 2017, for translations of two works from Chinese; and Rita Barisse, in 2019, who was retroactively noted as the translator of a 1963 French novel. Robert A. Heinlein has won the most Hugos for Best Novel, and also received the most nominations; he has six wins (four Hugos and two Retro-Hugos) on twelve nominations. Lois McMaster Bujold has received four Hugos on ten nominations. Five authors have won three times: Isaac Asimov and Fritz Leiber (with two Hugos and one Retro-Hugo each), N. K. Jemisin, Connie Willis, and Vernor Vinge. Nine other authors have won the award twice. The next-most nominations by a winning author are held by Robert J. Sawyer and Larry Niven, who have been nominated nine and eight times, respectively, and have each only won once. With nine nominations, Robert Silverberg has the greatest number of nominations without winning any. Three authors have won the award in consecutive years: Orson Scott Card (1986 and 1987), Lois McMaster Bujold (1991 and 1992), and N. K. Jemisin (2016, 2017, and 2018).

==Winners and nominees==
In the following table, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony, rather than when the novel was first published. Each year links to the corresponding &quot;year in literature&quot;. Entries with a yellow background have won the award; those with a grey background are the nominees on the short-list.

=== Retro-Hugos ===
Beginning with the 1996 Worldcon, the World Science Fiction Society created the concept of &quot;Retro-Hugos&quot;, in which the Hugo award could be retroactively awarded for 50, 75, or 100 years prior. Retro-Hugos may only be awarded for years after 1939 (the year of the first Worldcon) in which no Hugos were originally awarded. Retro-Hugos have been awarded eight times, for 1939, 1941, 1943–46, 1951, and 1954.

<doc id="348226" wikidata="Q2505478" url="?curid=348226" title="List of ant genera">
<text>Ants (family Formicidae in the order Hymenoptera) are the most species-rich of all social insects, with more than 12,000 described species and many others awaiting description. Formicidae is divided into 21 subfamilies, of which 17 are extant and four subfamilies are extinct, described from fossils. In total more than 300 genera have been described. Ants have come to occupy virtually all major terrestrial habitats, with the exception of tundra and cold ever-wet forests. They display a wide range of social behaviors, foraging habits and associations with other organisms, which has generated scientific and public interest.

The following is a list of worldwide ant genera organised by subfamily.

==Key==

==Subfamilies==

===Agroecomyrmecinae===
The subfamily Agroecomyrmecinae represents two extinct genera and two fossil genera, once widespread in both hemispheres during the early Tertiary. The subfamily was originally classified as Agroecomyrmecini, a Myrmicinae tribe until English myrmecologist Barry Bolton raised the tribe to subfamily status in 2003. Most specimens collected are from Central America and Mexico, although one type specimen of an Agroecomyrmecinae species was collected from Ghana.

===Amblyoponinae===
The subfamily Amblyoponinae represents nine extant genera and one fossil genus. Established by Swiss myrmecologist Auguste Forel in 1893, these ants are specialist predators, distributed worldwide in the tropics.

===Aneuretinae===
The subfamily Aneuretinae represents one extant genus and eight fossil genera established by Italian entomologist Carlo Emery in 1913. Only a single species of this subfamily is extant, the Sri Lankan relict ant (&quot;Aneuretus simoni&quot;), endemic to Sri Lanka.

===Apomyrminae===
The subfamily Apomyrminae contains the single genus &quot;Apomyrma&quot; which only has one species, the rare subterranean ant &quot;Apomyrma stygia&quot; from West Africa. Several undescribed species are known to exist, all from tropical Africa.

===Brownimeciinae===
The subfamily Brownimeciinae contains the single genus &quot;Brownimecia&quot; which only has one species, &quot;Brownimecia clavata&quot;. It was described in 1997 after a fossilised specimen was collected from Cretaceous amber from New Jersey, and was initially placed in the subfamily Ponerinae. The species was later classified into its own subfamily in 2003 by Barry Bolton.

===Dolichoderinae===
The subfamily Dolichoderinae was established by Forel in 1878, which represents 28 extant genera and 20 fossil genera. The subfamily presents a great diversity of species throughout the world, mainly in the tropics. Most species are generalised scavengers, but some are predacious.

===Dorylinae===
The subfamily Dorylinae was established by Leach in 1815, which represents 27 extant genera and one fossil genus. Many species of ant in this subfamily are known as army ants that are distributed in the Old World and New World.

===Ectatomminae===
The subfamily Ectatomminae represents four extant genera and three fossil genera, established in 1895 by Carlo Emery. They are distributed in tropical and warm climates in the New World and Old World, as well as the Indo-Australian regions.

===Formiciinae===
The subfamily Formiciinae represents one extinct genus of ants dating back to the Eocene. Ants of the genus &quot;Titanomyrma&quot; are the largest ants ever known, with queen specimens the size of small hummingbirds. Fossils have been collected from the state of Wyoming and in Germany.


===Formicinae===
The subfamily Formicinae represents 51 extant genera and 30 fossil genera that are globally distributed. Established by French zoologist Pierre André Latreille in 1809, the subfamily has more than 3,000 described species, placing it as the second largest ant subfamily. Despite this, the hyperdiverse genus &quot;Camponotus&quot; is the most diverse group of ants in the world, with more than 1,100 species described.


===Haidomyrmecinae===
The subfamily Haidomyrmecinae contains 9 fossil genera of specialized ants described from Cretaceous ambers. The Subfamily was previously treated as the tribe Haidomyrmecini and placed within Sphecomyrminae. The tribe was elevated to a subfamily in 2020.

===Heteroponerinae===
The subfamily Heteroponerinae represents three extant genera of ants, established in 2003 when Barry Bolton divided the subfamily Ponerinae into six subfamilies. These ants are known from the Neotropics of Central America and South America while &quot;Aulacopone relicta&quot; is from Azerbaijan.

===Leptanillinae===
The subfamily Leptanillinae represents nine extant genera of ants, established in 1910 by Carlo Emery. They are subterranean ants from Africa, Europe and a single species known from Australia. Studies about their biology is minimal.

===Martialinae===
The subfamily Martialinae contains the single genus &quot;Martialis&quot; which only has one species, &quot;Martialis heureka&quot;. The ant was discovered in 2000 Amazon rainforest near Manaus, Brazil. Described in 2008, the ant belongs to the oldest known distinct lineage to have diverged from the ancestors of all other ants.

===Myrmeciinae===
The subfamily Myrmeciinae represents two extant genera and five fossil genera that were once found worldwide. Established by Carlo Emery in 1877, the extant genera are restricted to Australia, New Caledonia and New Zealand. The notorious ant genus &quot;Myrmecia&quot; is known for their venomous stings and aggression, which has caused several human deaths in sensitive people.

===Myrmicinae===
The subfamily Myrmicinae was established by Lepeletier de Saint-Fargeau in 1835. It represents 142 extant genera and 36 fossil genera that are distributed globally. It is the largest subfamily of the Formicidae, with more than 6,758 species described. The seed-harvesting ants and fungus-growing ants are well known among the Myrmicines.


===Paraponerinae===
The subfamily Paraponerinae contains a single genus &quot;Paraponera&quot;. This genus has two species, one of which was found in Dominican amber from the Miocene. The extant species, &quot;Paraponera clavata&quot;, is found in Central America and South America, and the pain from its sting is said to be greater than any other insect sting on earth.

===Ponerinae===
The subfamily Ponerinae was established by Lepeletier de Saint-Fargeau in 1835, which represents 47 extant genera and 12 fossil genera. The subfamily is among the most diverse in the family Formicidae, with more than 1,000 species described. They are mostly distributed in the tropics and subtropics.

===Proceratiinae===
The subfamily Proceratiinae was established by Italian entomologist Carlo Emery in 1895, which represents three extant genera and one extinct genus. Found worldwide, these ants are mainly encountered in tropical and subtropical areas. Little is known about their biology.

===Pseudomyrmecinae===
The subfamily Pseudomyrmecinae was established by M.R. Smith in 1952, which represents three genera of ants that are primarily arboreal nesting ants in the tropical and subtropical regions. They are found in Africa, Asia, Australia, North America and South America.

===Sphecomyrminae===
The subfamily Sphecomyrminae contains 9 fossil genera of stem ants. Most fossilized ants from Cretaceous amber were placed in this subfamily, however revisions in 2017 and 2020 removed several genera and added former members of the subfamily Armaniinae.

==&quot;Incertae sedis&quot;==
There are several ant genera where their taxonomic placement is uncertain (&quot;incertae sedis&quot;). These genera have not yet been assigned to any subfamily within Formicidae; 16 genera are currently listed as &quot;incertae sedis&quot;.

==Formerly included in Formicidae==
There are several genera which were formerly placed in Formicidae, but have subsequently been removed. These genera are now placed in other families, are considered &quot;incertae sedis&quot; within Hymenoptera taxonomy, or are considered invalid.

<doc id="348227" wikidata="Q146029" url="?curid=348227" title="Ay (pharaoh)">
<text>Ay was the penultimate pharaoh of ancient Egypt&#x27;s 18th Dynasty. He held the throne of Egypt for a brief four-year period in the late 14th century BC. Prior to his rule, he was a close advisor to two, and perhaps three, other pharaohs of the dynasty. It is speculated that he was the power behind the throne during child ruler Tutankhamun&#x27;s reign, although there is no evidence for this aside from Tutankhamun&#x27;s youthfulness. His &quot;prenomen&quot; &quot;Kheperkheperure&quot; means &quot;Everlasting are the Manifestations of Ra&quot;, while his &quot;nomen&quot; &quot;Ay it-netjer&quot; reads as &quot;Ay, Father of the God&quot;. Records and monuments that can be clearly attributed to Ay are rare, both because his reign was short and because his successor, Horemheb, instigated a campaign of &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot; against him and the other pharaohs associated with the unpopular Amarna Period.

==Origins and family==

Ay is believed to have been from Akhmim. During his short reign, he built a rock-cut chapel in Akhmim and dedicated it to the local deity Min. He may have been the son of the courtier Yuya and his wife Thuya, making him a brother of Tiye and Anen. This connection is based on the fact that both Yuya and Ay came from Akhmim and held the titles &#x27;God&#x27;s Father&#x27; and &#x27;Master of Horses&#x27;. A strong physical resemblance has been noted between the mummy of Yuya and surviving statuary depictions of Ay. The mummy of Ay has not been located, although fragmentary skeletal remains recovered from his tomb may represent it, so a more thorough comparison with Yuya cannot be made. Therefore, the theory that he was the son of Yuya rests entirely on circumstantial evidence.

Ay&#x27;s Great Royal Wife was Tey, who was known to be the wet-nurse to Nefertiti. It is often theorised that he was the father of Nefertiti as a way to explain his title &#x27;God&#x27;s Father&#x27; as it has been argued that the term designates a man whose daughter married the king. However, nowhere are Ay and Tey referred to as the parents of Nefertiti.

Nakhtmin, Ay&#x27;s chosen successor, was likely his son or grandson. Nakhtmin&#x27;s mother was Iuy, a priestess of Min and Isis in Akhmim. She may have been Ay&#x27;s first wife.

==Viziership==

Ay served as vizier to at least two pharaohs, Akhenaten, and Tutankhamun. He may have also served as vizier to the pharaohs reigning in-between those two, Smenkhare and Neferneferuaten.

===Reign of Ankhenaten===

All that is known for certain was that by the time he was permitted to build a tomb for himself (Southern Tomb 25) at Amarna during the reign of Akhenaten, he had achieved the title of &quot;Overseer of All the Horses of His Majesty&quot;, the highest rank in the elite charioteering division of the army, which was just below the rank of General. Prior to this promotion he appears to have been first a Troop Commander and then a &quot;regular&quot; Overseer of Horses, titles which were found on a box thought to have been part of the original furnishings for his tomb. Other titles listed in this tomb include &quot;Fan-bearer on the Right Side of the King&quot;, &quot;Acting Scribe of the King, beloved by him&quot;, and &quot;God&#x27;s Father&quot;. The &#x27;Fan-bearer on the Right Side of the King&#x27; was a very important position, and is viewed as showing that the bearer had the &#x27;ear&#x27; of the ruler. The final &quot;God&#x27;s Father&quot; title is the one most associated with Ay, and was later incorporated into his royal name when he became pharaoh.

This title could mean that he was the father-in-law of the pharaoh, suggesting that he was the son of Yuya and Thuya, thus being a brother or half-brother of Tiye, brother-in-law to Amenhotep III and the maternal uncle of Akhenaten. Instead, the title may indicate that Ay was the tutor of Tutankhamun. If Ay was the son of Yuya, who was a senior military officer during the reign of Amenhotep III, then he likely followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps, finally inheriting his father&#x27;s military functions upon his death. Alternatively, it could also mean that he may have had a daughter who married the pharaoh Akhenaten, possibly being the father of Akhenaten&#x27;s chief wife Nefertiti. Ultimately there is no evidence to definitively prove either hypothesis. The two theories are not mutually exclusive, but either relationship would explain the exalted status to which Ay rose during Akhenaten&#x27;s Amarna interlude, when the royal family turned their backs on Egypt&#x27;s traditional gods and experimented, for a dozen years or so, with an early form of monotheism; an experiment that, whether out of conviction or convenience, Ay appears to have followed under the reign of Akhenaten.

The Great Hymn to the Aten is also found in his Amarna tomb which was built during his service under Akhenaten. His wife Tey was born a commoner but was given the title &quot;Nurse of the Pharaoh&#x27;s Great Wife&quot;. If she were the mother of Nefertiti she would be expected to have the royal title &quot;Mother of the Pharaoh&#x27;s Great Wife&quot; instead; had Ay been the father of Nefertiti, then Tey would have been her stepmother. In several Amarna tomb chapels there is a woman whose name begins with &quot;Mut&quot; who had the title &quot;Sister of the Pharaoh&#x27;s Great Wife&quot;. This could also be a daughter of Ay&#x27;s by his wife Tey, and it is known that his successor Horemheb married a woman with the name Mutnodjimet.

===Reign of Smenkhare===

There is no explicit evidence to confirm that Ay was the vizier during the reign of pharaoh Smenkhare. However, there is also no evidence suggesting that Ay was relieved of his viziership position under the immediately previous ruler, Akhenaten.

===Reign of Neferneferuaten ===

It is generally thought that Queen Neferneferuaten ruled independently of a king after the death of her husband Smenkhare. Although there is no explicit evidence to confirm that Ay was the vizier during the reign of pharaoh Neferneferuaten, there is also no evidence suggesting that Ay was relieved of his viziership position under reign of the king before her husband, Akhenaten.

===Reign of Tutankhamun===
It is generally presumable that Ay retained his post as vizier from his original appointment during Akhenaten&#x27;s government, all the way through the reign of Tutankhamun. This reign is most notably marked by the restoration of the original ancient Egyptian religion, especially the restoration of the power of the Amun priesthood, who had lost their influence over Egypt under Akhenaten.

Egyptologist Bob Brier suggested that Ay murdered Tutankhamun in order to usurp the throne, a claim which was based on X-ray examinations of the body done in 1968. He also alleged that Ankhesenamun and the Hittite prince she was about to marry were also murdered at his orders. This murder theory was not accepted by all scholars, and further analysis of the x-rays, along with CT scans taken in 2005, found no evidence to suggest that Tutankhamun died from a blow to the head as Brier had theorized. The cause of Tutankhamun&#x27;s demise is still an open problem in Egyptology, and Bob Brier still maintains the plausibility of Ay&#x27;s treasonous conspiratorial plotting, despite the physical cause of death Brier hypothesized being discounted.

A wall of Tutankhamun&#x27;s burial chamber depict Ay at the burial of Tutankhamun. The explicit depiction of a succeeding king conducting the &quot;Opening of the Mouth&quot; ceremony of another is unique; the depictions are usually more generic.

==Reign==

Depending on the chronology followed, Ay served as pharaoh between 1323 and 1319 BC, 1327–1323 BC, or 1310–1306 BC. Tutankhamun&#x27;s death around the age of 18 or 19, together with the fact he had no living children, left a power vacuum that his Grand Vizier Ay was quick to fill: he is depicted conducting the funerary rites for the deceased monarch and assuming the role of heir. The grounds on which he based his successful claim to power are not entirely clear. The Commander of the Army, Horemheb, had actually been designated as the &quot;idnw&quot; or &quot;Deputy of the Lord of the Two Lands&quot; under Tutankhamun and was presumed to be the boy king&#x27;s heir apparent and successor. It appears that Horemheb was outmaneuvered to the throne by Ay, who legitimized his claim to the throne by burying Tutankhamun, as well as possibly marrying Ankhesenamun, Tutankhamun&#x27;s widow.
Since Ay was already advanced in age upon his accession, he ruled Egypt in his own right for only four years. During this period, he consolidated the return to the old religious ways that he had initiated as senior advisor and constructed a mortuary temple at Medinet Habu for his own use. A stela of Nakhtmin (Berlin 2074), a military officer under Tutankhamun who was Ay&#x27;s chosen successor—is dated to &quot;Year 4, IV Akhet day 1&quot; of Ay&#x27;s reign. Manetho&#x27;s Epitome assigns a reign length of four years and one month to Horemheb, and this was usually assigned to him based on this Year 4 dated stela; however, it is now believed that figure should be raised by a decade to fourteen years and one month and attributed to Horemheb instead, as Manetho intended. Hence, Ay&#x27;s precise reign length is unknown and he could have ruled for as long as seven to nine years, since most of his monuments and his funerary temple at Medinet Habu were either destroyed or usurped by his successor, Horemheb.

==Succession==
Prior to his death, Ay attempted to sideline Horemheb from the royal succession. Horemheb, who was the general in charge of Egypt&#x27;s armies and previously held the title of Iry-pat or &quot;Hereditary Prince&quot; under Tutankhamun, was replaced in the succession by General Nakhtmin under king Ay. In fact, two separate men were designated Iry-pat or &quot;Hereditary Prince&quot; under Ay&#x27;s short reign namely: Nay and Nakhtmin.

=== Nay Iry-pat ===

Nozomu Kawai writes that Nay built his TT271 tomb at the hill of Qurnat Murai, facing Ay&#x27;s mortuary temple at Medinet Habu where he holds the titles of:
:&quot;chief physician&quot;, &quot;chamberlain&quot;, &quot;overseer of the King&#x27;s private apartment&quot;, and &quot;fan bearer on the right of the king&quot;, suggesting that he was the highest palace official under King Ay. Moreover, King Ay promoted Nay not only to &quot;Hereditary Prince&quot;, but also to &quot;great chief in the entire land&quot;, &quot;scribe of the elite troops&quot;, and &quot;chief spokesman in the entire land&quot;, indicating that he [Nay] outranked all other officials under the king. In fact, these titles were previously held by Horemheb during Tutankhamun&#x27;s reign. However, it is not likely that Nay took over Horemheb&#x27;s position. As I have already argued, these titles, including jrj-pꜥt, could have just indicated the heads of the government, not the &quot;designated successor&quot; or &quot;Crown Prince&quot;. In fact, Nay&#x27;s tomb did not suffer from any damnatio memoriae. This suggests that Nay was not the designated successor and he could not have been Horemheb&#x27;s rival.&quot;

=== Nakhtmin Iry-pat ===

In contrast, the case of general Nakhtmin is quite different than that of Nay. As Kawai writes:
: &quot;Nakhtmin was a general, probably a subordinate of Horemheb in the military under Tutankhamun, but he had also a close relation to Ay. He is known to have dedicated five shabtis to Tutankhamun&#x27;s funerary equipment. On these shabtis, he was called &quot;General&quot; and &quot;fan bearer on the right of the king&quot;. Then, he appears to have been promoted by King Ay to not only &quot;Hereditary Prince&quot; and &quot;Generalissimo&quot; but also even &quot;King&#x27;s Son&quot; [()]– namely the &quot;Crown Prince&quot; of Ay who would succeed the throne. This title is undoubtedly superior to Horemheb&#x27;s status. Therefore, King Ay intended to relegate Horemheb to a less important position and replace him with Nakhtmin to carry out his functions. We do not know exactly when Nakhtmin was promoted, but this must have created Horemheb&#x27;s strong hostility against King Ay.&quot;

Ay&#x27;s succession plans went awry, as Horemheb became the last king of Egypt&#x27;s 18th Dynasty instead of Nakhtmin. The fact that Nakhtmin was Ay&#x27;s intended political heir is strongly implied by an inscription carved on a dyad funerary statue of Nakhtmin and his spouse which was presumably made during Ay&#x27;s reign. Nakhtmin is clearly given the titles &quot;Crown Prince&quot; (jrj-pꜥt) and &quot;King&#x27;s Son&quot; (). The only conclusion which can be drawn here is that Nakhtmin was either a son or an adopted son of Ay&#x27;s, and that Ay was grooming Nakhtmin for the royal succession instead of Horemheb. The British Egyptologists Aidan Dodson and Dyan Hilton observe that the aforementioned statue:
==Aftermath==

It appears that one of Horemheb&#x27;s undertakings as Pharaoh was to eliminate all references to the monotheistic experiment, a process that included expunging the name of his immediate predecessors, especially Ay, from the historical record. Horemheb desecrated Ay&#x27;s burial and had most of Ay&#x27;s royal cartouches in his WV23 tomb erased while his sarcophagus was smashed into numerous fragments. However, the intact sarcophagus lid was discovered in 1972 by Otto Schaden. The lid had been buried under debris in this king&#x27;s tomb and still preserved Ay&#x27;s cartouche. Horemheb also usurped Ay&#x27;s mortuary temple at Medinet Habu for his own use. Uvo Hölscher (1878–1963) who excavated the temple in the early 1930s provides these interesting details concerning the state of Ay-Horemheb&#x27;s mortuary temple:
Nozomu Kawai describes Horemheb&#x27;s actions as a damnatio memoriae since once he became king, Horemheb &quot;started erasing all depictions of [king] Ay on the monuments of Tutankhamun, as well as those on Ay&#x27;s royal monuments and those of his entourage. This action must be understood as damnatio memoriae. Horemheb desecrated Ay&#x27;s tomb (KV 23) in the Western Valley of the Kings...and removed all other [visible] inscriptions and images of Ay.&quot; The rivalry which began when Ay attempted to sideline Horemheb from the royal succession ended in Horemheb&#x27;s victory.

==In fiction==
*Ay is a central character in Gwendolyn MacEwen&#x27;s novel &quot;King of Egypt, King of Dreams&quot;, where he is portrayed as one of Akhenaten&#x27;s closest confidants, spiritual antagonists, and supporters.

<text>William Walker (May 8, 1824September 12, 1860) was an American physician, lawyer, journalist, and mercenary. In the era of the expansion of the United States, driven by the doctrine of &quot;manifest destiny&quot;, Walker organized unauthorized military expeditions into Mexico and Central America with the intention of establishing colonies. Such an enterprise was known at the time as &quot;filibustering&quot;.

After settling in California, motivated by an earlier filibustering project of Gaston de Raousset-Boulbon, Walker attempted in 1853–54 to take Baja California and Sonora. He declared those territories to be an independent Republic of Sonora, but he was soon driven back to California by the Mexican forces. Walker then went to Nicaragua in 1855 as leader of a mercenary army employed by the Nicaraguan Democratic Party in its civil war against the Legitimists. He took control of the Nicaraguan government and in July 1856 set himself up as the country&#x27;s president.

Walker&#x27;s regime was recognized as the legitimate government of Nicaragua by US President Franklin Pierce, and it initially enjoyed the support of some important sectors within Nicaraguan society. However, Walker antagonized the powerful Wall Street tycoon Cornelius Vanderbilt by expropriating Vanderbilt&#x27;s Accessory Transit Company, which operated one of the main routes for the transport of passengers going from New York City to San Francisco. The British Empire saw Walker as a threat to its interests in the possible construction of a Nicaragua Canal. As ruler of Nicaragua, Walker re-legalized slavery, although this measure was never enforced, and threatened the independence of neighboring Central American republics. A military coalition led by Costa Rica defeated Walker and forced him to resign the presidency of Nicaragua on May 1, 1857.

Walker then tried to re-launch his filibustering project and in 1860 published a book, &quot;The War in Nicaragua&quot;, which cast his efforts to conquer Central America as tied to the geographical expansion of slavery. In that way, Walker sought to gain renewed support from pro-slavery forces in the Southern United States on the eve of the American Civil War. The same year, Walker returned to Central America but was arrested by the Royal Navy, who handed him over to the Honduran government, which executed him.

==Early life==
William Walker was born in Nashville, Tennessee, in 1824 to James Walker and his wife Mary Norvell. His father was an English settler. His mother was the daughter of Lipscomb Norvell, an American Revolutionary War officer from Virginia. One of Walker&#x27;s maternal uncles was John Norvell, a U.S. Senator from Michigan and founder of &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;. Walker was engaged to Ellen Martin, but she died of yellow fever before they could be married, and he died without children.

Walker graduated &quot;summa cum laude&quot; from the University of Nashville at the age of 14. In 1843, at the age of 19, he received a medical degree from the University of Pennsylvania. Walker then continued his medical studies at Edinburgh and Heidelberg. He practiced medicine briefly in Philadelphia, but soon moved to New Orleans where he studied law privately.

Walker practiced law for a short time, then quit to become co-owner and editor of the &quot;New Orleans Crescent&quot; newspaper. In 1849, he moved to San Francisco, where he worked as editor of the &quot;San Francisco Herald&quot; and fought three duels; he was wounded in two of them. Walker then conceived the idea of conquering vast regions of Central America and creating new slave states to join those already part of the Union. These campaigns were known as filibustering, or freebooting, and were supported by the Southern expansionist secret society, the Knights of the Golden Circle.

===Duel with William Hicks Graham===
Walker gained national attention by dueling with law clerk William Hicks Graham on January 12, 1851. Walker criticized Graham and his colleagues in the &quot;Herald&quot;, which angered Graham and prompted him to challenge Walker to a duel. Graham was a notorious gunman, having taken part in a number of duels and shootouts in the Old West. Walker, on the other hand, had experience dueling with single-shot pistols at one time, but his duel with Graham was fought with revolvers.

The combatants met at Mission Dolores, where each was given a Colt Dragoon with five shots. They stood face to face at ten paces, and each aimed and fired at the signal of a referee. Graham managed to fire two bullets, hitting Walker in his pantaloons and his thigh, seriously wounding him. Walker tried a number of times to shoot his weapon, but he failed to land even a single shot and Graham was left unscathed. The duel ended when Walker conceded. Graham was arrested but was quickly released. The duel was recorded in &quot;The Daily Alta California&quot;.

==Invasion of Mexico==
In the summer of 1853, Walker traveled to Guaymas in Mexico, seeking a grant from the Mexican government to establish a colony. He proposed that his colony would serve as a fortified frontier, protecting U.S. soil from Indian raids. Mexico refused, and Walker returned to San Francisco determined to obtain his colony regardless of Mexico&#x27;s position. He began recruiting American supporters of slavery and of the Manifest Destiny doctrine, mostly inhabitants of Tennessee and Kentucky. Walker&#x27;s plans then expanded from forming a buffer colony to establishing an independent Republic of Sonora, which might eventually take its place as a part of the Union (as the Republic of Texas had done in 1845). He funded his project by &quot;selling scrips which were redeemable in lands of Sonora&quot;.
On October 15, 1853, Walker set out with forty-five men to conquer the Mexican territories of Baja California Territory and Sonora State. He succeeded in capturing La Paz, the capital of sparsely populated Baja California, which he declared the capital of a new &quot;Republic of Lower California&quot; (declared November 3, 1853), with himself as president and his former law partner, Henry P. Watkins, as vice president. Walker then put the region under the laws of the American state of Louisiana, which made slavery legal. Whether Walker at this stage intended to tie his filibustering expedition to the cause of slavery is a matter of dispute.

Fearful of attacks by Mexico, Walker moved his headquarters twice over the next three months, first to Cabo San Lucas, and then further north to Ensenada to maintain a more secure base of operations. Although he never gained control of Sonora, he pronounced Baja California part of the larger Republic of Sonora. Lack of supplies, severe aridity of Baja California and strong resistance by the Mexican government quickly forced Walker to retreat.

Back in California, Walker was indicted by a federal grand jury for waging an illegal war in violation of the Neutrality Act of 1794. However, in the era of Manifest Destiny, Walker&#x27;s filibustering project had popular support in the southern and western U.S. Walker was tried before Judge I. S. K. Ogier in the US District Court for the Southern District of California. Although two of Walker&#x27;s associates had already been convicted of similar charges and Judge Ogier summarized the evidence against Walker for the jury, the jury deliberated for only eight minutes before acquitting Walker.

==Invasion of Nicaragua==


Since there was no inter-oceanic route between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans at the time, and the transcontinental railway did not yet exist, a major trade route between New York City and San Francisco ran through southern Nicaragua. Ships from New York entered the San Juan River from the Atlantic and sailed across Lake Nicaragua. People and goods were then transported by stagecoach across a narrow strip of land near the city of Rivas, before reaching the Pacific and ships to San Francisco. The commercial exploitation of this route had been granted by Nicaragua to the Accessory Transit Company, controlled by shipping magnate Cornelius Vanderbilt.

In 1854, a civil war erupted in Nicaragua between the Legitimist Party (also called the Conservative Party), based in the city of Granada, and the Democratic Party (also called the Liberal Party), based in León. The Democratic Party sought military support from Walker who, to circumvent U.S. neutrality laws, obtained a contract from Democratic president Francisco Castellón to bring as many as three hundred &quot;colonists&quot; to Nicaragua. These mercenaries received the right to bear arms in the service of the Democratic government. Walker sailed from San Francisco on May 3, 1855, with approximately sixty men. Upon landing, the force was reinforced by 110 locals. With Walker&#x27;s expeditionary force was the well-known explorer and journalist Charles Wilkins Webber, as well as Belgian-born adventurer Charles Frederick Henningsen, a veteran of the First Carlist War, the Hungarian Revolution, and the war in Circassia. Besides Henningsen, three members of Walker&#x27;s forces who became Confederate officers were Birkett D. Fry, Robert C. Tyler, and Chatham Roberdeau Wheat.

With Castellón&#x27;s consent, Walker attacked the Legitimists in Rivas, near the trans-isthmian route. He was driven off, but not without inflicting heavy casualties. In this First Battle of Rivas, a schoolteacher called Enmanuel Mongalo y Rubio (1834–1872) burned the Filibuster headquarters. On September 3, during the Battle of La Virgen, Walker defeated the Legitimist army. On October 13, he conquered Granada and took effective control of the country. Initially, as commander of the army, Walker ruled Nicaragua through provisional President Patricio Rivas. U.S. President Franklin Pierce recognized Walker&#x27;s regime as the legitimate government of Nicaragua on May 20, 1856, and on June 3 the Democratic national convention expressed support of the effort to &quot;regenerate&quot; Nicaragua. However, Walker&#x27;s first ambassadorial appointment, Colonel Parker H. French, was refused recognition. On September 22, Walker repealed Nicaraguan laws prohibiting slavery, in an attempt to gain support from the Southern states.

Walker&#x27;s actions in the region caused concern in neighboring countries and potential U.S. and European investors who feared he would pursue further military conquests in Central America. C. K. Garrison and Charles Morgan, subordinates of Vanderbilt&#x27;s Accessory Transit Company, provided financial and logistical support to the Filibusters in exchange for Walker, as ruler of Nicaragua, seizing the company&#x27;s property (on the pretext of a charter violation) and turning it over to Garrison and Morgan. Outraged, Vanderbilt dispatched two secret agents to the Costa Rican government with plans to fight Walker. They would help regain control of Vanderbilt&#x27;s steamboats which had become a logistical lifeline for Walker&#x27;s army.

Concerned about Walker&#x27;s intentions in the region, Costa Rican President Juan Rafael Mora Porras rejected his diplomatic overtures and began preparing the country&#x27;s military for a potential conflict. Walker organized a battalion of four companies, of which one was composed of Germans, a second of Frenchmen, and the other two of Americans, totaling 240 men placed under the command of Colonel Schlessinger to invade Costa Rica in a preemptive action. This advance force was defeated at the Battle of Santa Rosa on March 20, 1856.

The most important strategic defeat of Walker came during the Campaign of 1856–57 when the Costa Rican army, led by Porras, General José Joaquín Mora Porras (the president&#x27;s brother), and General José María Cañas (1809–1860), defeated the Filibusters in Rivas on April 11, 1856 (the Second Battle of Rivas). It was in this battle that the soldier and drummer Juan Santamaría sacrificed himself by setting the Filibuster stronghold on fire. In parallel with Enmanuel Mongalo y Rubio in Nicaragua, Santamaría would become Costa Rica&#x27;s national hero. Walker deliberately contaminated the water wells of Rivas with corpses. Later, a cholera epidemic spread to the Costa Rican troops and the civilian population of Rivas. Within a few months nearly 10,000 civilians had died, almost ten percent of the population of Costa Rica.

From the north, President José Santos Guardiola sent Honduran troops under the leadership of the Xatruch brothers, who joined Salvadoran troops to fight Walker. Florencio Xatruch led his troops against Walker and the filibusters in la Puebla, Rivas. Later, because of the opposition of other Central American armies, José Joaquín Mora Porras was made Commandant General-in-Chief of the Allied Armies of Central America in the Third Battle of Rivas (April 1857).

During this civil war, Honduras and El Salvador recognized Xatruch as brigade and division general. On June 12, 1857, after Walker surrendered, Xatruch made a triumphant entrance to Comayagua, which was then the capital of Honduras. Both the nickname by which Hondurans are known today, Catracho, and the more infamous nickname for Salvadorans, &quot;Salvatrucho&quot;, are derived from Xatruch&#x27;s figure and successful campaign as leader of the allied armies of Central America, as the troops of El Salvador and Honduras were national heroes, fighting side by side as Central American brothers against William Walker&#x27;s troops.

As the general and his soldiers returned from battle, some Nicaraguans affectionately yelled out (&quot;Here come Xatruch&#x27;s boys!&quot;) However, Nicaraguans had trouble pronouncing the general&#x27;s Catalan name, so they altered the phrase to &quot;los catruches&quot; and ultimately to &quot;los catrachos&quot;.

A key role was played by the Costa Rican Army in unifying the other Central American armies to fight against Filibusters. The &quot;Campaign of the Transit&quot; (1857) is the name given by Costa Rican historians to the groups of several battles fought by the Costa Rican Army, supervised by Colonel Salvador Mora, and led by Colonel Blanco and Colonel Salazar at the San Juan River. By establishing control of this bi-national river at its border with Nicaragua, Costa Rica prevented military reinforcements from reaching Walker and his Filibuster troops via the Caribbean Sea. Also, Costa Rican diplomacy neutralized U.S. official support for Walker by taking advantage of the dispute between the magnate Cornelius Vanderbilt and William Walker.

Walker took up residence in Granada and set himself up as President of Nicaragua, after conducting a fraudulent election. He was inaugurated on July 12, 1856, and soon launched an Americanization program, reinstating slavery, declaring English an official language, and reorganizing currency and fiscal policy to encourage emigration from the United States. Realizing that his position was becoming precarious, he sought support from the Southerners in the U.S. by recasting his campaign as a fight to spread the institution of black slavery, which was the basis of the Southern agrarian economy. With this in mind, Walker revoked Nicaragua&#x27;s emancipation edict of 1821. This move increased Walker&#x27;s popularity among Southern whites and attracted the attention of Pierre Soulé, an influential New Orleans politician, who campaigned to raise support for Walker&#x27;s war. Nevertheless, Walker&#x27;s army was weakened by massive defections and an epidemic of cholera and was finally defeated by the Central American coalition led by Costa Rican President Juan Rafael Mora Porras (1814–1860).

On October 12, 1856, Guatemalan Colonel José Víctor Zavala crossed the square of the city to the house where Walker&#x27;s soldiers took shelter. Under heavy fire, he reached the enemy&#x27;s flag and carried it back with him, shouting to his men that the Filibuster bullets did not kill.

On December 14, 1856, as Granada was surrounded by 4,000 troops from Costa Rica, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala, along with independent Nicaraguan allies, Charles Frederick Henningsen, one of Walker&#x27;s generals, ordered his men to set the city ablaze before escaping and fighting their way to Lake Nicaragua. When retreating from Granada, the oldest Spanish colonial city in Nicaragua, he left a detachment with orders to level it in order to instill, as he put it, &quot;a salutary dread of American justice&quot;. It took them over two weeks to smash, burn and flatten the city; all that remained were inscriptions on the ruins that read (&quot;Here was Granada&quot;).

On May 1, 1857, Walker surrendered to Commander Charles Henry Davis of the United States Navy under the pressure of Costa Rica and the Central American armies and was repatriated. Upon disembarking in New York City, he was greeted as a hero, but he alienated public opinion when he blamed his defeat on the U.S. Navy. Within six months, he set off on another expedition, but he was arrested by the U.S. Navy Home Squadron under the command of Commodore Hiram Paulding and once again returned to the U.S. amid considerable public controversy over the legality of the navy&#x27;s actions.

== Conviction and execution ==
After writing an account of his Central American campaign (published in 1860 as &quot;War in Nicaragua&quot;), Walker once again returned to the region. British colonists in Roatán, Bay Islands, fearing that the Honduran government would move to assert its control over them, approached Walker with an offer to help him in establishing an independent, English-speaking administration over the islands. Walker disembarked in the port city of Trujillo but was arrested by Royal Navy officer Nowell Salmon. The British controlled the neighboring regions of Honduras and the Mosquito Coast and had considerable strategic and economic interest in the construction of an inter-oceanic canal through Central America; Britain therefore regarded Walker as a menace to its own affairs in the region.

Rather than return him to the U.S., for reasons that remain unclear, Salmon sailed to Trujillo and handed Walker over to the Honduran government along with his chief of staff, Colonel A. F. Rudler. Both men were tried by a military court on charges of piracy and &quot;filibusterism&quot;. In his defense, Walker argued that piracy could not be committed on land and &quot;filibusterism&quot; wasn&#x27;t a word. Rudler was sentenced to four years of hard labor in Honduran mines, but Walker was sentenced to death, and executed by firing squad, near the site of the present-day hospital, on September 12, 1860. William Walker was 36 years old. He is buried in the &quot;Old Cemetery&quot;, Trujillo, Colón, Honduras.

==Influence and reputation==
William Walker convinced many Southerners of the desirability of creating a slave-holding empire in tropical Latin America. In 1861, when U.S. Senator John J. Crittenden proposed that the 36°30&#x27; parallel north be declared as a line of demarcation between free and slave territories, some Republicans denounced such an arrangement, with New York congressman Roscoe Conkling saying that it &quot;would amount to a perpetual covenant of war against every people, tribe, and State owning a foot of land between here and Tierra del Fuego&quot;.

Before the end of the American Civil War, Walker&#x27;s memory enjoyed great popularity in the southern and western United States, where he was known as &quot;General Walker&quot; and as the &quot;gray-eyed man of destiny&quot;. Northerners, on the other hand, generally regarded him as a pirate. Despite his intelligence and personal charm, Walker consistently proved to be a limited military and political leader. Unlike men of similar ambition, such as Cecil Rhodes, Walker&#x27;s grandiose scheming ultimately failed.

In Central American countries, the successful military campaign of 1856–1857 against William Walker became a source of national pride and identity, and it was later promoted by local historians and politicians as substitute for the war of independence that Central America had not experienced. April 11 is a Costa Rican national holiday in memory of Walker&#x27;s defeat at Rivas. Juan Santamaría, who played a key role in that battle, is honored as one of two Costa Rican national heroes, the other one being Juan Rafael Mora himself. The main airport serving San José (in Alajuela) is named in Santamaría&#x27;s honor.

To this day, a sense of Central American &quot;coalition&quot; among the nations of Costa Rica, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala, along with independent Nicaraguan allies, is remembered and celebrated as a unifying shared history.

==Cultural legacy==

Walker&#x27;s campaigns in Lower California and Nicaragua are the subject of a historical novel by Alfred Neumann, published in German as &quot;Der Pakt&quot; (1949), and translated in English as &quot;Strange Conquest&quot; (a previous UK edition was published as &quot;Look Upon This Man&quot;).
Walker&#x27;s campaign in Nicaragua has inspired two films, both of which take considerable liberties with his story: &quot;Burn!&quot; (1969) directed by Gillo Pontecorvo, starring Marlon Brando, and &quot;Walker&quot; (1987) directed by Alex Cox, starring Ed Harris. Walker&#x27;s name is used for the main character in &quot;Burn!&quot;, though the character is not meant to represent the historical William Walker and is portrayed as British. On the other hand, Alex Cox&#x27;s &quot;Walker&quot; incorporates into its surrealist narrative many of the signposts of William Walker&#x27;s life and exploits, including his original excursions into northern Mexico to his trial and acquittal on breaking the neutrality act to the triumph of his assault on Nicaragua and his execution.

In Part Five, Chapter 48, of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, Margaret Mitchell cites William Walker, &quot;and how he died against a wall in Truxillo&quot;, as a topic of conversation between Rhett Butler and his filibustering acquaintances, while Rhett and Scarlett O&#x27;Hara are on honeymoon in New Orleans.

A poem written by Nicaraguan Catholic priest and minister of culture from 1979 to 1987 during the Sandinista period Ernesto Cardenal, &quot;Con Walker En Nicaragua,&quot; translated as &quot;With Walker in Nicaragua&quot;, gives a historical treatment of the affair from the Nicaraguan perspective.

The villain of the Nantucket series, by science fiction writer S. M. Stirling, is a 20th-century American mercenary named William Walker, who is time-displaced from 1998 CE to 1250 BCE. Walker demonstrates a similar personality to his historical namesake, leading a filibuster force to Mycenaean Greece and initiating a version of the Trojan War with firearms.

John Neal&#x27;s 1859 novel &quot;True Womanhood&quot; includes a character who travels from the US to Nicaragua. When he returns, it turns out he has been involved in Walker&#x27;s campaign there. This may be based on his son James or his friend&#x27;s son, Appleton Oaksmith, both of whom made the trip and were involved with Walker in that country.

<text>Aedes (also known as the tiger mosquito) is a genus of mosquitoes originally found in tropical and subtropical zones, but now found on all continents except Antarctica. Some species have been spread by human activity: &quot;Aedes albopictus&quot;, a particularly invasive species, was spread to the Americas, including the United States, in the 1980s, by the used-tire trade.

First described and named by German entomologist Johann Wilhelm Meigen in 1818, the generic name comes from the Ancient Greek , word meaning &#x27;unpleasant&#x27; or &#x27;odious&#x27;. The type species for &quot;Aedes&quot; is &quot;Aedes cinereus&quot;.

==Systematics and phylogeny==
The genus was named by Johann Wilhelm Meigen in 1818. The generic name comes from the Ancient Greek , , meaning &#x27;unpleasant&#x27; or &#x27;odious&#x27;.

As historically defined, the genus contains more than 950 species (see the list of &quot;Aedes&quot; species). The genus has been divided into several subgenera (&quot;Aedes&quot;, &quot;Diceromyia&quot;, &quot;Finlaya&quot;, &quot;Stegomyia&quot;, etc.), most of which have been recently treated by some authorities as full genera. The classification was revised in 2009.

==Characteristics==
&quot;Aedes&quot; mosquitoes are visually distinctive because they have noticeable black and white markings on their bodies and legs. Unlike most other mosquitoes, they are active and bite only during the daytime. The peak biting periods are early in the morning and in the evening before dusk.
== Direct children of this genus ==
The genus contains 28 species that are not placed in a further subgenus:

*&quot;Aedes tsiliensis&quot; 
*&quot;Aedes versicolor&quot; 
*&quot;Aedes wasselli&quot; 
*&quot;Aedes annuliventris&quot; 

==As disease vectors==
Members of the genus &quot;Aedes&quot; are known vectors for numerous viral infections, including dengue fever, yellow fever, the Zika virus, and chikungunya, which are transmitted by species in the subgenus &quot;Stegomyia&quot; such as &quot;A. aegypti&quot; and &quot;A. albopictus&quot;. Infections with these viruses are typically accompanied by a fever, and in some cases, encephalitis, which can lead to death. A vaccine to provide protection from yellow fever exists, and measures to prevent mosquito bites include insecticides such as DDT, mosquito traps, insect repellents, mosquito nets, and pest control using genetically modified insects. In Polynesia, the species &quot;Aedes polynesiensis&quot; is responsible for the transmission of human lymphatic filariasis. 

&quot;Aedes&quot; can be detected and monitored by ovitraps.

==Sequencing==
The genome of the yellow fever mosquito (&quot;Aedes aegypti&quot;) was sequenced by the Broad Institute and the Institute for Genomic Research. The initial assembly was released in August 2005; a draft sequence of the genome and preliminary analysis was published in June 2007. The annotated genome is available at VectorBase. An updated and improved version of the &quot;Aedes aegypti&quot; genome was released in 2018.

<text>Bacillus thuringiensis serotype israelensis (Bti) is a group of bacteria used as biological control agents for larvae stages of certain dipterans. Bti produces toxins which are effective in killing various species of mosquitoes, fungus gnats, and blackflies, while having almost no effect on other organisms. The major advantage of &quot;B. thuringiensis&quot; products is that they are thought to affect few non-target species. However, even though Bti may have minimal direct effects on non-target organisms, it may potentially be associated with knock-on effects on food webs and other ecosystem properties, including biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.

Bti strains possess the pBtoxis plasmid which encodes numerous Cry (a δ-endotoxin) and Cyt toxins, including Cry4, Cry10, Cry11, Cyt1, and Cyt2. The crystal aggregation which these toxins form contains at least four major toxic components, but the extent to which each Cry and Cyt protein is represented is not known and likely to vary with strain and formulation. Both Cry and Cyt proteins are pore-forming toxins; they lyse midgut epithelial cells by inserting into the target cell membrane and forming pores.

Commercial formulations include &quot;Mosquito Dunks&quot;, &quot;Mosquito Bits&quot;, and &quot;VectoBac&quot;. It is also available in bulk liquid or granular formulations for commercial and public agency use.

==Discovery==
Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti) was discovered in 1976 by Yoel Margalith, a professor at Ben Gurion University in Israel. 

The initial field tests of Bti were conducted in 1978 against the floodwater mosquito species &quot;Aedes vexans&quot; in the River Rhine Valley of Germany. This early experimentation demonstrated the efficacy of Bti in controlling mosquito populations, leading to its widespread adoption. Over the years, Bti has been extensively used by various organizations, including the German Mosquito Control Association, &quot;Kommunale Aktionsgemeinschaft zur Bekämpfung der Schnakenplage e.V.&quot; (KABS), which has utilized Bti for almost four decades without encountering resistance issues.

Today, Bti is utilized globally across all continents to manage mosquito populations, although controlling certain vector species like &quot;Aedes aegypti&quot; and &quot;Aedes albopictus&quot; remains challenging due to their breeding habits in small and hidden containers.

<text>Ronald Newbold Bracewell AO (22 July 1921 – 12 August 2007) was the Lewis M. Terman Professor of Electrical Engineering of the Space, Telecommunications, and Radioscience Laboratory at Stanford University.

== Education ==

Bracewell was born in Sydney, in 1921, and educated at Sydney Boys High School. He graduated from the University of Sydney in 1941 with the BSc degree in mathematics and physics, later receiving the degrees of B.E. (1943), and M.E. (1948) with first class honours, and while working in the Engineering Department became the President of the Oxometrical society. During World War II he designed and developed microwave radar equipment in the Radiophysics Laboratory of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Sydney under the direction of Joseph L. Pawsey and Edward G. Bowen and from 1946 to 1949 was a research student at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, engaged in ionospheric research in the Cavendish Laboratory, where in 1949 he received his PhD degree in physics under J. A. Ratcliffe.

== Career ==

From October 1949 to September 1954, Dr. Bracewell was a senior research officer at the Radiophysics Laboratory of the CSIRO, Sydney, concerned with very-long-wave propagation and radio astronomy. He then lectured in radio astronomy at the Astronomy Department of the University of California, Berkeley, from September 1954 to June 1955 at the invitation of Otto Struve, and at Stanford University during the summer of 1955, and joined the Electrical Engineering faculty at Stanford in December 1955.

In 1974 he was appointed the first Lewis M. Terman Professor and Fellow in Electrical Engineering (1974–1979). Though he retired in 1979, he continued to be active until his death.

== Contributions and honours ==

Professor Bracewell was a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society (1950), Fellow and life member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (1961), Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1989), and was a Fellow with other significant societies and organisations.

For experimental contributions to the study of the ionosphere by means of very low frequency waves, Dr. Bracewell received the Duddell Premium of the Institution of Electrical Engineers, London in 1952. In 1992 he was elected to foreign associate membership of the Institute of Medicine of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences (1992), the first Australian to achieve that distinction, for fundamental contributions to medical imaging. He was one of Sydney University&#x27;s three honourees when alumni awards were instituted in 1992, with a citation for brain scanning, and was the 1994 recipient of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers&#x27; Heinrich Hertz medal for pioneering work in antenna aperture synthesis and image reconstruction as applied to radio astronomy and to computer-assisted tomography. In 1998 Dr. Bracewell was named Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) for service to science in the fields of radio astronomy and image reconstruction.

At CSIRO Radiophysics Laboratory, work that in 1942–1945 was classified appeared in a dozen reports. Activities included design, construction, and demonstration of voice-modulation equipment for a 10 cm magnetron (July 1943), a microwave triode oscillator at 25 cm using cylindrical cavity resonators, equipment designed for microwave radar in field use (wavemeter, echo box, thermistor power meter, etc.) and microwave measurement technique. Experience with numerical computation of fields in cavities led, after the war, to a Master of Engineering degree (1948) and the definitive publication on step discontinuities in radial transmission lines (1954).

While at the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge (1946–1950) Bracewell worked on observation and theory of upper atmospheric ionisation, contributing to experimental technique (1948), explaining solar effects (1949), and distinguishing two layers below the E-layer (1952), work recognised by the Duddell Premium.

While at Stanford, Professor Bracewell constructed a microwave spectroheliograph (1961), a radio telescope comprising 32 10 ft dishes arranged in a cross, which produced daily temperature maps of the Sun reliably for eleven years, the duration of a solar cycle. The first radio telescope to give output automatically in printed form, and therefore capable of worldwide dissemination by teleprinter, its daily solar weather maps received acknowledgement from NASA for support of the first crewed landing on the Moon. Subsequently, five larger 60 ft dishes were built at the same site, and were eventually removed in 2006 after efforts to preserve the site. Bracewell was interviewed during the destruction of the dishes.

Many fundamental papers on restoration (1954–1962), interferometry (1958–1974) and reconstruction (1956–1961) appeared along with instrumental and observational papers. By 1961 the radio-interferometer calibration techniques developed for the spectroheliograph first allowed an antenna system, with 52-inch fan beam, to equal the angular resolution of the human eye in one observation. With this beam the components of Cygnus A, spaced 100-inch, were put directly in evidence without the need for repeated observations with variable spacing aperture synthesis interferometry.

The nucleus of the extragalactic source Centaurus A was resolved into two separate components whose right ascensions were accurately determined with a 2.3-minute fan beam at 9.1 cm. Knowing that Centaurus A was composite, Bracewell used the 6.7-minute beam of the Parkes Observatory 64 m radio telescope at 10 cm to determine the separate declinations of the components and in so doing was the first to observe strong polarisation in an extragalactic source (1962), a discovery of fundamental significance for the structure and role of astrophysical magnetic fields. Subsequent observations made at Parkes by other observers with a 14-minute and wider beams at 21 cm and longer wavelengths, though not resolving the components, were compatible with the formula_1 dependence expected from Faraday rotation if magnetic fields were the polarising agent.

A second major radiotelescope (1971) employing advanced concepts to achieve an angular resolution of 18 seconds of arc was designed and built at Stanford and applied to both solar and galactic studies. The calibration techniques for this leading-edge resolution passed into general use in radio interferometry via the medium of alumni.

Upon the discovery of the cosmic background radiation:
* a remarkable observational limit of 1.7 millikelvins, with considerable theoretical significance for cosmology, was set on the anisotropy in collaboration with PhD student E. K. Conklin (1967), and was not improved on for many years
* the correct theory of a relativistic observer in a blackbody enclosure (1968) was given in the first of several papers by various authors obtaining the same result
* the absolute motion of the Sun at 308 km/s through the cosmic background radiation was measured by Conklin in 1969, some years before independent confirmation.

With the advent of the space age, Bracewell became interested in celestial mechanics, made observations of the radio emission from Sputnik 1, and supplied the press with accurate charts predicting the path of Soviet satellites, which were perfectly visible, if you knew when and where to look. Following the puzzling performance of Explorer I in orbit, he published the first explanation (1958–59) of the observed spin instability of satellites, in terms of the Poinsot motion of a non-rigid body with internal friction. He recorded the signals from Sputniks I, II and III and discussed them in terms of the satellite spin, antenna polarisation, and propagation effects of the ionised medium, especially Faraday effect.

Later (1978, 1979) he invented a spinning, nulling, two-element infrared interferometer suitable for space-shuttle launching into an orbit near Jupiter, with milliarcsecond resolution, that could lead to the discovery of planets around stars other than the Sun. This concept was elaborated in 1995 by Angel and Woolf, whose space-station version with four-element double nulling became the Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF), NASA&#x27;s candidate for imaging planetary configurations of other stars.

Imaging in astronomy led to participation in development of computer assisted x-ray tomography, where commercial scanners reconstruct tomographic images using the algorithm developed by Bracewell for radioastronomical reconstruction from fan-beam scans. This corpus of work has been recognized by the Institute of Medicine, an award by the University of Sydney, and the Heinrich Hertz medal. Service on the founding editorial board of the &quot;Journal for Computer-Assisted Tomography&quot;, to which he also contributed publications, and on the scientific advisory boards of medical instrumentation companies maintained Bracewell&#x27;s interest in medical imaging, which became an important part of his regular graduate lectures on imaging, and forms an important part of his 1995 text on imaging.

Experience with the optics, mechanics and control of radiotelescopes led to involvement with solar thermophotovoltaic energy at the time of the energy crisis, including the fabrication of low-cost solid and perforated paraboloidal reflectors by hydraulic inflation.

Bracewell is also known for being the first to propose the use of autonomous interstellar space probes for communication between alien civilisations as an alternative to radio transmission dialogs. This hypothetical concept has been dubbed the Bracewell probe after its inventor.

=== Fourier analysis ===
As a consequence of relating images to Fourier analysis, in 1983 he discovered a new factorisation of the discrete Fourier transform matrix leading to a fast algorithm for spectral analysis. This method, which has advantages over the fast Fourier algorithm, especially for images, is treated in &quot;The Hartley Transform&quot; (1986), in U.S. Patent 4,646,256 (1987, now in the public domain), and in over 200 technical papers by various authors that were stimulated by the discovery. Analogue methods of creating a Hartley transform plane first with light and later with microwaves were demonstrated in the laboratory and permitted the determination of electromagnetic phase by the use of square-law detectors. A new elementary signal representation, the Chirplet transform, was discovered (1991) that complements the Gabor elementary signal representations used in dynamic spectral analysis (with the property of meeting the bandwidth-duration minimum associated with the uncertainty principle). This advance opened a new field of adaptive dynamic spectra with wide application in information analysis.

=== Other interests ===


Professor Bracewell was interested in conveying an appreciation of the role of science in society to the public, in mitigating the effects of scientific illiteracy on public decision making through contact with alumni groups, and in liberal undergraduate education within the framework of the Astronomy Course Program and the Western Culture program in Values, Technology, Science and Society, in both of which he taught for some years. He gave the 1996 Bunyan Lecture on &quot;The Destiny of Man&quot;.

He was also interested in the trees of Stanford&#x27;s campus and published a book about them. He also taught an undergraduate seminar titled I Dig Trees.

Bracewell was also a designer and builder of sundials. He and his son Mark Bracewell built one on the South side of the Terman Engineering Building; after that building was demolished, a new home for the sundial, at the same orientation, was found on the Jen-Hsun Huang Engineering Center. He built another sundial at the home of his son, and another on the deck of professor John G. Linvill&#x27;s house. The Bracewell Radio Sundial at the Very Large Array was built in his honor.

<doc id="348263" wikidata="Q2702458" url="?curid=348263" title="William Grover-Williams">
<text>William Charles Frederick Grover-Williams (born William Charles Frederick Grover, 16 January 1903 – 18 March 1945 (or shortly thereafter)), also known as &quot;W Williams&quot;, was a British Grand Prix motor racing driver. He is best known for winning the first Monaco Grand Prix. 

During World War II, Grover-Williams, code named Sebastian, worked as an agent in France for the clandestine British Special Operations Executive (SOE) organization. SOE&#x27;s objectives were to conduct espionage, sabotage, and reconnaissance in countries occupied by the Axis powers, especially those occupied by Nazi Germany. SOE agents allied themselves with French resistance groups and supplied them with weapons and equipment. Grover-Williams created, coordinated, and led the SOE&#x27;s Chestnut network which worked near Paris. The Chestnut network organised parachute drops of weapons and equipment from SOE and stockpiled them for the use of the resistance. The German Sicherheitsdienst (SD) captured Grover-Williams in August 1943. He was imprisoned and executed in March 1945. 

==Personal and early life==

Grover-Williams was born in Montrouge, Hauts-de-Seine, France on 16 January 1903 to Frederick and Hermance Grover. Frederick Grover was an English horse breeder who had settled in Montrouge. Frederick met a French woman, Hermance Dagan, and they were soon married. Their first child was Elizabeth, born in 1897. William had two other siblings – Alice and Frédéric. Born to an English father and a French mother, Grover-Williams grew up fluent in both French and English.

When William was eleven, during World War I, his parents sent him to live with relatives in Hertfordshire, in the United Kingdom. After the war, Frederick Grover moved the family to Monte Carlo. It was there that William developed a fascination for automobiles, having been taught to drive a Rolls-Royce by his sister&#x27;s boyfriend. Grover-Williams passed his driving test while in Monaco and was granted a licence. Mechanically inclined and fascinated by motorised vehicles, at the age of 15 Grover-Williams acquired an Indian motorcycle and it became his pride and joy. He would later compete in motorcycle races in the early 1920s, although he kept it secret from his family by adopting the pseudonym, &quot;W Williams&quot;. 

In 1919, the Irish portrait painter, William Orpen became the official artist of the Paris Peace Conference. Orpen bought a Rolls-Royce car and hired Grover-Williams, who had returned to Paris, as his chauffeur. At the time, Orpen had a mistress and model named Yvonne Aupicq. Aupicq and Grover-Williams became good friends and, after the collapse of Aupicq&#x27;s relationship with Orpen, the pair married in November 1929. She was six years older than him.

==Racing career==

By 1926, Grover-Williams had begun racing a Bugatti in races throughout France, using the alias, &quot;W Williams&quot;, entering the &quot;Grand Prix de Provence&quot; at Miramas and the Monte Carlo Rally. In 1928, he won the French Grand Prix, repeating in 1929. That same year, driving a Bugatti 35B, painted in what would become known as &quot;British racing green&quot;, he won the inaugural Monaco Grand Prix beating the heavily favoured Mercedes of the German driver, Rudolf Caracciola.

Successful financially, Grover-Williams and his wife maintained a home in a fashionable district of Paris while owning a large house in the resort town of La Baule, Pays de la Loire, on the Bay of Biscay, which was home to one of the annual Grand Prix races. In 1931, he won the Belgian Grand Prix at Spa-Francorchamps. He also won the Grand Prix de la Baule in three consecutive years (1931 to 1933). He retired from racing in 1933.

==Second World War==
On 28 February 1940, Grover-Williams enlisted in the British Royal Army Service Corps and worked as a driver in France. In June 1940, he was evacuated from Dunkirk to England after the victory by Nazi Germany in the Battle of France. Due to his fluency in both French and English, he was recruited into the Special Operations Executive (SOE) in autumn 1940. SOE trained him to be an agent and promoted him from private to second lieutenant. On 29 May 1942, Grover-Williams and another SOE agent, Christopher Burney, parachuted &quot;blind&quot; (with no reception committee on the ground) into France near Le Mans. Grover-Williams proceeded to Paris where he reunited with his wife, Yvonne, but, for security reasons, he found himself a different place to live and work. Grover-Williams&#x27; work name with SOE was &quot;Sebastian.&quot; His task for SOE was to create a &quot;sleeper&quot; cell called Chestnut which would prepare to take action against the German occupiers when ordered to do so by SOE. 

SOE&#x27;s network in Paris was Autogyro, headed by Pierre de Vomécourt, but in April 1942 the Germans were destroying Autogyro and killing or imprisoning its members. SOE envisioned Chestnut as a replacement for Autogyro, but with the creation of the Prosper network later in 1942, the much smaller Chestnut network became a secondary network in Paris, devoting itself to storing arms for the eventual use of the French resistance against the German occupiers. Grover-Williams recruited two fellow race-car drivers, Robert Benoist and Jean-Pierre Wimille, into his network and the trio used their wives and other women as couriers. The base of their operations was the Benoist family estate near Auffargis about southwest of Paris.

Grover-Williams&#x27; main problem was that SOE did not supply him with a radio operator for communications with SOE headquarters in London. This problem was partially solved in January 1943 when Grover-Williams established contact with Jack Agazarian, the newly arrived radio operator for the Prosper Network. SOE policy dictated that each network should have its own radio operator and that contact between and among networks was forbidden. Contrary to that policy, Agazarian transmitted Chestnut&#x27;s messages to London. Starting in mid-February, Grover-Williams organized with SOE six parachute drops of weapons and other supplies for the French resistance. In March 1943, SOE finally sent Grover-Williams a radio operator of his own, Roland Dowlen. The arms and other supplies the Chestnut network had received were stored for future use. Grover-Williams was also able to organize an effective sabotage effort at the Citroën factory in Paris. 

Grover-Williams&#x27; downfall began 31 July 1943 when a German direction-finding van pinpointed the location of Dowlen and his radio and arrested him. On 1 August, Maurice Benoist, brother of Robert, was arrested. The next day Maurice Benoist led the German &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; (SD) to the Benoist chateau at Auffargis. Grover-Williams was found hiding in a stable and arrested. The Germans recovered many containers of arms and equipment at the chateau. The Germans captured Robert Benoist on 4 August, but he escaped.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grehan/Mace&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; When Grover-William&#x27;s wife, Yvonne, learned of his arrest, she fled Paris and took refuge with friends in the village of Thorenc.

==Imprisonment and death==
After his capture, the Germans took Grover-Williams to SD headquarters at 84 Avenue Foch in Paris for interrogation. In January 1944, he was sent to Berlin and imprisoned at the Reich Security Office, notorious for the tortures committed on prisoners. In March 1944 he was transferred to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. In March 1945, the Nazi government decreed &quot;special treatment&quot; for a list of political prisoners, including Grover-Williams. 

Grover-Williams was executed at Sachsenhausen in the spring of 1945, along with fellow SOE network leader Francis Suttill. The date of death shown on the official War Office casualty lists, originally &quot;On or shortly after 1.2.1945&quot; has been amended to read &quot;On or shortly after 18.3.1945&quot;, while the Commonwealth War Graves Commission records the date simply as 18 March 1945.

After the war, Grover-Williams&#x27; widow, Yvonne, eventually settled in the village of Amfreville-la-Campagne in Normandy where she managed a dog kennel breeding terriers. She died in 1973, age 77. Robert Benoist&#x27;s granddaughter, among others, claimed that William Grover-Williams survived the war and lived with Yvonne from 1948 until her death under the assumed identity of &quot;Georges Tambal.&quot; Tambal was killed by a German driver while riding a bicycle in 1983.

==Legacy and recognition==
Grover-Williams is recorded on the Brookwood Memorial in Surrey, England, and as one of the SOE agents who died for the liberation of France, he is listed on the Valençay SOE Memorial&#x27;s &quot;Roll of Honour&quot; in the French town of Valençay.

Awarded the French Croix de Guerre, Grover-Williams was also recommended for an Order of the British Empire by the head of the SOE, Major-General Colin Gubbins, in September 1945, but when it became clear that he had died the honour was not awarded. 

&quot;The Saboteur&quot;, a 2009 video game, features an Irish protagonist named Sean Devlin who is inspired by Grover-Williams.

A statue of Grover-Williams in his 1929 Monaco Grand Prix-winning Bugatti Type 35 is located at the first corner of the Circuit de Monaco (Sainte-Dévote Chapel).

<text>Crisis management is the process by which an organization deals with a disruptive and unexpected event that threatens to harm the organization or its stakeholders. The study of crisis management originated with large-scale industrial and environmental disasters in the 1980s. It is considered to be the most important process in public relations.
Three elements are common to a crisis: (a) a threat to the organization, (b) the element of surprise, and (c) a short decision time. Venette argues that &quot;crisis is a process of transformation where the old system can no longer be maintained&quot;. Therefore, the fourth defining quality is the need for change. If change is not needed, the event could more accurately be described as a failure or incident.

In contrast to risk management, which involves assessing potential threats and finding the best ways to avoid those threats, crisis management involves dealing with threats before, during, and after they have occurred. It is a discipline within the broader context of management consisting of skills and techniques required to identify, assess, understand, and cope with a serious situation, especially from the moment it first occurs to the point that recovery procedures start.

==Introduction==
Crisis management is a situation-based management system that includes clear roles and responsibilities and processes related organizational requirements company-wide. The response shall include action in the following areas: crisis prevention, crisis assessment, crisis handling, and crisis termination. The aim of crisis management is to be well prepared for crisis, ensure a rapid and adequate response to the crisis, maintaining clear lines of reporting and communication in the event of crisis and agreeing rules for crisis termination.

The techniques of crisis management include a number of consequent steps from the understanding of the influence of the crisis on the corporation to preventing, alleviating, and overcoming the different types of crisis. Crisis management consists of different aspects including: 
* Methods used to respond to both the reality and perception of crisis.
* Establishing metrics to define what scenarios constitute a crisis and should consequently trigger the necessary response mechanisms.
* Communication that occurs within the response phase of emergency-management scenarios.

Crisis-management methods of a business or an organization are called a crisis-management plan. A British Standard BS11200:2014 provides a useful foundation for understanding terminology and frameworks relating to crisis, in this document the focus is on the corporate exposure to risks in particular to the black swan events that result in significant strategic threats to organizations. Currently there is work on-going to develop an International standard.

Crisis management is occasionally referred to as incident management, although several industry specialists such as Peter Power argue that the term &quot;crisis management&quot; is more accurate.

A crises mindset requires the ability to think of the worst-case scenario while simultaneously suggesting numerous solutions. Trial and error is an accepted discipline, as the first line of defense might not work. It is necessary to maintain a list of contingency plans and to be always on alert. Organizations and individuals should always be prepared with a rapid response plan to emergencies which would require analysis, drills and exercises.

The credibility and reputation of organizations is heavily influenced by the perception of their responses during crisis situations. The organization and communication involved in responding to a crisis in a timely fashion makes for a challenge in businesses. There must be open and consistent communication throughout the hierarchy to contribute to a successful crisis-communication process.

The related terms emergency management and business continuity management focus respectively on the prompt but short lived &quot;first aid&quot; type of response (e.g. putting the fire out) and the longer-term recovery and restoration phases (e.g. moving operations to another site). Crisis is also a facet of risk management, although it is probably untrue to say that crisis management represents a failure of risk management, since it will never be possible to totally mitigate the chances of catastrophes&#x27; occurring.

An organizational crisis is described as a rare, high-impact event that jeopardizes the organization&#x27;s survival. It is marked by uncertainty regarding the cause, effects, and solutions, along with the need for rapid decision-making.

==Types of crisis ==
During the crisis management process, it is important to identify types of crises in that different crises necessitate the use of different crisis management strategies. Potential crises are enormous, but crises can be clustered.
Lerbinger categorized eight types of crises
# Natural disaster
# Technological crisis
# Confrontation
# Malevolence
# Organizational Misdeeds
# Workplace Violence
# Rumours
# Terrorist attacks/man-made disasters

===Natural disaster===
Natural disaster related crises, typically natural disasters, are such environmental phenomena as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tornadoes and hurricanes, floods, landslides, tsunamis, storms, and droughts that threaten life, property, and the environment itself.
: Example: 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake (Tsunami)

===Technological crisis===
Technological crises are caused by human application of science and technology. Technological accidents inevitably occur when technology becomes complex and coupled and something goes wrong in the system as a whole (Technological breakdowns). Some technological crises occur when human error causes disruptions (Human breakdowns). People tend to assign blame for a technological disaster because technology is subject to human manipulation. That said, a decent amount of research demonstrates that the remedy or response strategy after a technological crisis (such as a data breach) can contribute significantly to an organization&#x27;s overall reputation. There is also a cross-sectional difference among firms – firms with higher reputations tend to be less impacted by the blame on the technological crisis. In contrast, people do not hold anyone responsible for natural disaster. When an accident creates significant environmental damage, the crisis is categorized as &quot;megadamage&quot;. Samples include software failures, industrial accidents, and oil spills.

: Examples: Chernobyl disaster, Exxon Valdez oil spill, Heartbleed security bug

===Confrontation crisis===
Confrontation crisis occur when discontented individuals and/or groups fight businesses, government, and various interest groups to win acceptance of their demands and expectations. The common type of confrontation crisis is boycotts, and other types are picketing, sit-ins, ultimatums to those in authority, blockade or occupation of buildings, and resisting or disobeying police.

: Example: Rainbow/PUSH&#x27;s (People United to Serve Humanity) boycott of Nike

===Crisis of malevolence===
An organization faces a crisis of malevolence when opponents or miscreant individuals use criminal means or other extreme tactics for the purpose of expressing hostility or anger toward, or seeking gain from, a company, country, or economic system, perhaps with the aim of destabilizing or destroying it. Sample crises include product tampering, kidnapping, malicious rumors, terrorism, cybercrime and espionage.

Example: Chicago Tylenol murders

===Crisis of organizational misdeeds===
Crises occur when management takes actions it knows will harm or place stakeholders at risk for harm without adequate precautions. Lerbinger specified three different types of crises of organizational misdeeds: crises of skewed management values, crises of deception, and crises of management misconduct.

====Crisis of skewed management values====
Crises stemming from skewed management values occur when leaders prioritize short-term financial gains while disregarding broader social responsibilities and key stakeholders beyond investors. This imbalance often originates from the traditional business mindset that prioritizes shareholder interests at the expense of customers, employees, and the community. A structured framework for corporate recovery following ethical failures involves four key actions: Replace, Restructure, Redevelop, Rebrand. These steps help organizations restore integrity, rebuild trust, and realign their values with ethical and sustainable business practices.

: Example: Volkswagen emissions scandal

====Crisis of deception====
Crisis of deception occur when management conceals or misrepresents information about itself and its products in its dealing with consumers and others.

:Example: Dow Corning&#x27;s silicone-gel breast implant

====Crisis of management misconduct====
Some crises are caused not only by skewed values and deception but deliberate amorality and illegality.

===Workplace violence===
Crises occur when an employee or former employee commits violence against other employees on organizational grounds.

: Example: May 4, 2016 at Knight Transportation in Katy, Texas

===Rumors===
False information about an organization or its products creates crisis hurting the organization&#x27;s reputation. Sample is linking the organization to radical groups or stories that their products are contaminated.

: Example: Procter &amp; Gamble logo myth

===Terrorist attacks/man-made disasters===
These occur when the crisis was triggered by people, for example global financial crises, transportation accidents, massive destruction.

==Crisis leadership==

Alan Hilburg, a pioneer in crisis management, defines organizational crises as categorized as either acute crises or chronic crises. Hilburg also created the concept of the Crisis Arc. Erika Hayes James, an organizational psychologist at the University of Virginia&#x27;s Darden Graduate School of Business, identifies two primary types of organizational crisis. James defines organizational crisis as &quot;any emotionally charged situation that, once it becomes public, invites negative stakeholder reaction and thereby has the potential to threaten the financial well-being, reputation, or survival of the firm or some portion thereof&quot;.

# Sudden crisis
# Smoldering crises

===Sudden crisis===
Sudden crises are circumstances that occur without warning and beyond an institution&#x27;s control. Consequently, sudden crises are most often situations for which the institution and its leadership are not blamed.

===Smoldering crisis===
Smoldering crises differ from sudden crises in that they begin as minor internal issues that, due to manager&#x27;s negligence, develop to crisis status. These are situations when leaders are blamed for the crisis and its subsequent effect on the institution in question.

James categorises five phases of crisis that require specific crisis leadership competencies. Each phase contains an obstacle that a leader must overcome to improve the structure and operations of an organization. James&#x27;s case study on crisis in the financial services sector, for example, explores why crisis events erode public trust in leadership. James&#x27;s research demonstrates how leadership competencies of integrity, positive intent, capability, mutual respect, and transparency impact the trust-building process.

# Signal detection
# Preparation and prevention
# Containment and damage control
# Business recovery
# Learning

===Signal detection===
Signal detection is the stage in a crisis in which leaders should, but do not always, sense early warning signals (red flags) that suggest the possibility of a crisis. The detection stages of a crisis include:

*Sense-making: represents an attempt to create order and make sense, retrospectively, of what occurs.
*Perspective-taking: the ability to consider another person&#x27;s or group&#x27;s point of view.

===Preparation and prevention===

It is during this stage that crisis handlers begin preparing for or averting the crisis that had been foreshadowed in the signal detection stage. Hilburg has demonstrated that using an impact/probability model allows organizations to fairly accurately predict crisis scenarios. He&#x27;s recognized the greatest organizational challenge is &#x27;speaking truth to power&#x27; to predict truly worst-case scenarios. Organizations such as the Red Cross&#x27;s primary mission is to prepare for and prevent the escalation of crisis events. Companies like Walmart have been recognized for their role in providing emergency relief after having witnessed the incredibly speedy and well-coordinated effort to get supplies to the Gulf Coast of the United States in anticipation of Hurricane Katrina.

===Containment and damage control===
Usually the most vivid stage, the goal of crisis containment and damage control is to limit the reputational, financial, safety, and other threats to firm survival. Crisis handlers work diligently during this stage to bring the crisis to an end as quickly as possible to limit the negative publicity to the organization, and move into the business recovery phase.

===Business recovery===
When a crisis hits, organizations must be able to carry on with their business in the midst of the crisis while simultaneously planning for how they will recover from the damage the crisis caused. Crisis handlers not only engage in continuity planning (determining the people, financial, and technology resources needed to keep the organization running), but will also actively pursue organizational resilience.

===Learning===
In the wake of a crisis, organizational decision makers adopt a learning orientation and use prior experience to develop new routines and behaviors that ultimately change the way the organization operates. The best leaders recognize this and are purposeful and skillful in finding the learning opportunities inherent in every crisis situation.

===Crisis communication===

The effort taken by an organization to communicate with the public and stakeholders when an unexpected event occurs that could have a negative impact on the organization&#x27;s reputation. This can also refer to the efforts to inform employees or the public of a potential hazard which could have a catastrophic impact. There are 3 essential steps that an organization can take to prepare for and withstand a communications crisis: 1) Define your philosophy; 2) Assess your vulnerabilities; 3) Develop a protocol.

== Models and theories associated with crisis management ==

===Crisis management strategy===

Crisis management strategy (CMS) is corporate development strategy designed primarily to prevent crisis for follow-up company advancement. Thus, CMS is synthesis of strategic management. It includes projection of the future based on ongoing monitoring of business internal and external environment, as well as selection and implementation of crisis prevention strategy and operating management. This is including current status control based on ongoing monitoring of the internal and external environment, as well as crisis-coping strategy selection and implementation.

===Crisis management model===
Successfully managing a crisis requires an understanding of how to handle a crisis – beginning with before they occur. Alan Hilburg speaks about a crisis arc. The arc consists of crisis avoidance, crisis mitigation and crisis recovery. Gonzalez-Herrero and Pratt found the different phases of Crisis Management.

There are 3 phases in any crisis management as shown below

# The diagnosis of the impending trouble or the danger signals.
# Choosing appropriate Turnaround Strategy.
# Implementation of the change process and its monitoring

=== Crisis management planning===
No corporation looks forward to facing a situation that causes a significant disruption to their business, especially one that stimulates extensive media coverage. Public scrutiny can result in a negative financial, political, legal and government impact. Crisis management planning deals with providing the best response to a crisis.

With the growing threat of cyber attacks, &quot;traditional information technology incident response plans often fail to consider the cross-organizational activities that need to be performed to remain resilient when a major cyber crisis occurs, resulting in a delayed, chaotic, unstructured, and fragmented response. A cyber crisis management plan is designed to reduce these risks through careful pre-planning; therefore, developing a cyber crisis management plan requires organizations to take a holistic approach to cyber crisis planning. By proactively acting to build a cyber crisis management plan, a broader, carefully considered, integrated and validated plan can be developed to meet an organization&#x27;s unique demands before the crisis strikes.&quot;

===Contingency planning===
Preparing contingency plans in advance, as part of a crisis-management plan, is the first step to ensuring an organization is appropriately prepared for a crisis. Crisis-management teams can rehearse a crisis plan by developing a simulated scenario to use as a drill. The plan should clearly stipulate that the only people to speak to publicly about the crisis are the designated persons, such as the company spokesperson or crisis team members. Ideally it should be one spokesperson who can be available on call at any time. Cooperation with media is crucial in crisis situation, assure that all questions are answered on time and information on what was done to resolve the situation is provided. The first hours after a crisis breaks are the most crucial, so working with speed and efficiency is important, and the plan should indicate how quickly each function should be performed. When preparing to offer a statement externally as well as internally, information should be accurate and transparent. Providing incorrect or manipulated information has a tendency to backfire and will greatly exacerbate the situation. The contingency plan should contain information and guidance that will help decision makers to consider not only the short-term consequences, but the long-term effects of every decision.

===Business continuity planning===
When a crisis will undoubtedly cause a significant disruption to an organization, a business continuity plan can help minimize the disruption. First, one must identify the critical functions and processes that are necessary to keep the organization running. This part of the planning should be conducted in the earliest stages, and is part of a business impact analysis phase that will signpost &quot;How much does the organization stand to lose?” (Osborne, 2007). Practical Business Continuity Management. Business Management: Top tips for effective, real-world Business Continuity Management).

Each critical function and or/process must have its own contingency plan in the event that one of the functions/processes ceases or fails, then the business/organization is more resilient, which in itself provides a mechanism to lessen the possibility of having to invoke recovery plans (Osborne, 2007). Testing these contingency plans by rehearsing the required actions in a simulation will allow those involved to become more acutely aware of the possibility of a crisis. As a result, and in the event of an actual crisis, the team members will act more quickly and effectively.

A note of caution when planning training scenarios, all too often simulations can lack ingenuity, an appropriate level of realism and as a consequence potentially lose their training value. This part can be improved by employing external exercise designers who are not part of the organisational culture and are able to test an organizations response to crisis, in order to bring about a crisis of confidence for those who manage vital systems.

Following a simulation exercise, a thorough and systematic debriefing must be conducted as a key component of any crisis simulation. The purpose of this is to create a link and draw lessons from the reality of the simulated representation and the reality of the real world.

The whole process relating to business continuity planning should be periodically reviewed to identify any number of changes that may invalidate the current plan.

===Structural-functional systems theory===
Providing information to an organization in a time of crisis is critical to effective crisis management. Structural-functional systems theory addresses the intricacies of information networks and levels of command making up organizational communication. The structural-functional theory identifies information flow in organizations as &quot;networks&quot; made up of members &quot;. Information in organizations flow in patterns called networks.

===Diffusion of innovation theory===
Another theory that can be applied to the sharing of information is diffusion of innovation theory. Developed by Everett Rogers, the theory describes how innovation is disseminated and communicated through certain channels over a period of time. Diffusion of innovation in communication occurs when an individual communicates a new idea to one or several others. At its most elementary form, the process involves: (1) an innovation, (2) an individual or other unit of adoption that has knowledge of or experience with using the innovation, (3) another individual or other unit that does not yet have knowledge of the innovation, and (4) a communication channel connecting the two units. A communication channel is the means by which messages get from one individual to another.

===Role of apologies in crisis management===
There has been debate about the role of apologies in crisis management, and some argue that apology opens an organization up for possible legal consequences. &quot;However some evidence indicates that compensation and sympathy, two less expensive strategies, are as effective as an apology in shaping people&#x27;s perceptions of the organization taking responsibility for the crisis because these strategies focus on the victims&#x27; needs. The sympathy response expresses concern for victims while compensation offers victims something to offset the suffering.&quot;

===Crisis leadership===

James identifies five leadership competencies which facilitate organizational restructuring during and after a crisis. 
#Building an environment of trust
#Reforming the organization&#x27;s mindset
#Identifying obvious and obscure vulnerabilities of the organization
#Making wise and rapid decisions as well as taking courageous action
#Learning from crisis to effect change.

Crisis leadership research concludes that leadership action in crisis reflects the competency of an organization, because the test of crisis demonstrates how well the institution&#x27;s leadership structure serves the organization&#x27;s goals and withstands crisis. 

Developing effective human resources is vital when building organizational capabilities through crisis management executive leadership.

===Unequal human capital theory===

James postulates that organizational crisis can result from discrimination lawsuits. 
 James&#x27;s theory of unequal human capital and social position derives from economic theories of human and social capital concluding that minority employees receive fewer organizational rewards than those with access to executive management. In a recent study of managers in a &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 company, race was found to be a predictor of promotion opportunity or lack thereof. Thus, discrimination lawsuits can invite negative stakeholder reaction, damage the company&#x27;s reputation, and threaten corporate survival.

===Social media and crisis management===

Social media has accelerated the speed that information about a crisis can spread. The viral effect of social networks such as Twitter means that stakeholders can break news faster than traditional media – making managing a crisis harder. This can be mitigated by having the right training and policy in place as well as the right social media monitoring tools to detect signs of a crisis breaking. Social media also gives crisis management teams access to real-time information about how a crisis is impacting stakeholder sentiment and the issues that are of most concern to them.

The advent of social media changed the field of crisis management dramatically, empowering stakeholders and making organisations more accountable for their actions. By creating a platform for two-way symmetrical communication between an organisation and its stakeholders, social media facilitated a rise in organisational crises, allowing for stakeholders anywhere in the world – providing they have an internet connection – to communicate publicly with organisations. The publishing unfavourable behaviour on social media, combined with the immense speed that information can be shared online, created a need for social media strategy to be included within the crisis management planning process. Stakeholders expect organisations to respond quickly and effectively to crises that transpire online.

Organisations should have a planned approach to releasing information to the media in the event of a crisis. A media reaction plan should include a company media representative as part of the Crisis Management Team (CMT). Since there is always a degree of unpredictability during a crisis, it is best that all CMT members understand how to deal with the media and be prepared to do so, should they be thrust into such a situation.

In 2010 Procter &amp; Gamble Co called reports that its new Pampers with Dry Max caused rashes and other skin irritations &quot;completely false&quot; as it aimed to contain a public relations threat to its biggest diaper innovation in 25 years. A Facebook group called &quot;Pampers bring back the OLD CRUISERS/SWADDLERS&quot; rose to over 4,500 members. Pampers denied the allegation and stated that only two complaints had been received for every one million diapers sold. Pampers quickly reached out to people expressing their concerns via social media, Pampers even held a summit with four influential &quot;mommy bloggers&quot;, to help dispel the rumour. Pampers acted quickly and decisively to an emerging crisis, before competitors and critics alike could fuel the fire further.

==Examples of crisis management==

=== Examples of successful crisis management ===

====Tylenol (Johnson and Johnson)====
In the fall of 1982, a murderer added 65 milligrams of cyanide to some Tylenol capsules on store shelves, killing seven people, including three in one family. Johnson &amp; Johnson recalled and destroyed 31 million capsules at a cost of $100 million. The affable CEO, James Burke, appeared in television ads and at news conferences informing consumers of the company&#x27;s actions. Tamper-resistant packaging was rapidly introduced, and Tylenol sales swiftly bounced back to near pre-crisis levels.

When another bottle of tainted Tylenol was discovered in a store, it took only a matter of minutes for the manufacturer to issue a nationwide warning that people should not use the medication in its capsule form.

====Odwalla Foods====
When Odwalla&#x27;s apple juice was thought to be the cause of an outbreak of E. coli infection, the company lost a third of its market value. In October 1996, an outbreak of E. coli bacteria in Washington state, California, Colorado and British Columbia was traced to unpasteurized apple juice manufactured by natural juice maker Odwalla Inc. Forty-nine cases were reported, including the death of a small child. Within 24 hours, Odwalla conferred with the FDA and Washington state health officials; established a schedule of daily press briefings; sent out press releases which announced the recall; expressed remorse, concern and apology, and took responsibility for anyone harmed by their products; detailed symptoms of E. coli poisoning; and explained what consumers should do with any affected products. Odwalla then developed – through the help of consultants – effective thermal processes that would not harm the products&#x27; flavors when production resumed. All of these steps were communicated through close relations with the media and through full-page newspaper ads.

====Mattel====

Mattel Inc., the toy maker, has been plagued with more than 28 product recalls and in the summer of 2007, among problems with exports from China, faced two product recalls in two weeks. The company &quot;did everything it could to get its message out, earning high marks from consumers and retailers. Though upset by the situation, they were appreciative of the company&#x27;s response. At Mattel, just after the 7 a.m. recall announcement by federal officials, a public relations staff of 16 was set to call reporters at the 40 biggest media outlets. They told each to check their e-mail for a news release outlining the recalls, invited them to a teleconference call with executives and scheduled TV appearances or phone conversations with Mattel&#x27;s chief executive. The Mattel CEO Robert Eckert did 14 TV interviews on a Tuesday in August and about 20 calls with individual reporters. By the week&#x27;s end, Mattel had responded to more than 300 media inquiries in the U.S. alone.&quot;

====Pepsi====
The Pepsi Corporation faced a crisis in 1993 which started with claims of syringes being found in cans of diet Pepsi. Pepsi urged stores not to remove the product from shelves while it had the cans and the situation investigated. This led to an arrest, which Pepsi made public and then followed with their first video news release, showing the production process to demonstrate that such tampering was impossible within their factories. A second video news release displayed the man arrested. A third video showed surveillance from a convenience store where a woman was caught inserting a syringe into a can. The company simultaneously publicly worked with the FDA during the crisis. This made public communications effective throughout the crisis. After the crisis had been resolved, the corporation ran a series of special campaigns designed to thank the public for standing by the corporation, along with coupons for further compensation. This case served as a design for how to handle other crisis situations.

===Examples of unsuccessful crisis management===

====Bhopal====

The Bhopal disaster in which poor communication before, during, and after the crisis cost thousands of lives, illustrates the importance of incorporating cross-cultural communication in crisis management plans. According to American University&#x27;s Trade Environmental Database Case Studies (1997), local residents were not sure how to react to warnings of potential threats from the Union Carbide plant. Operating manuals printed only in English is an extreme example of mismanagement but indicative of systemic barriers to information diffusion. According to Union Carbide&#x27;s own chronology of the incident (2006), a day after the crisis Union Carbide&#x27;s upper management arrived in India but was unable to assist in the relief efforts because they were placed under house arrest by the Indian government. Symbolic intervention can be counter productive; a crisis management strategy can help upper management make more calculated decisions in how they should respond to disaster scenarios. The Bhopal incident illustrates the difficulty in consistently applying management standards to multi-national operations and the blame shifting that often results from the lack of a clear management plan.

====Ford and Firestone Tire and Rubber Company====

The Ford-Firestone Tire and Rubber Company dispute transpired in August 2000. In response to claims that their 15-inch Wilderness AT, radial ATX and ATX II tire treads were separating from the tire core—leading to crashes—Bridgestone/Firestone recalled 6.5 million tires. These tires were mostly used on the Ford Explorer, the world&#x27;s top-selling sport utility vehicle (SUV).

The two companies committed three major blunders early on, say crisis experts. First, they blamed consumers for not inflating their tires properly. Then they blamed each other for faulty tires and faulty vehicle design. Then they said very little about what they were doing to solve a problem that had caused more than 100 deaths—until they got called to Washington to testify before Congress.

====Exxon====
On 24 March 1989, a tanker belonging to the Exxon Corporation ran aground in the Prince William Sound in Alaska. The Exxon Valdez spilled millions of gallons of crude oil into the waters off Valdez, killing thousands of fish, fowl, and sea otters. Hundreds of miles of coastline were polluted and salmon spawning runs disrupted; numerous fishermen, especially Native Americans, lost their livelihoods. Exxon, by contrast, did not react quickly in terms of dealing with the media and the public; the CEO, Lawrence Rawl, did not become an active part of the public relations effort and actually shunned public involvement; the company had neither a communication plan nor a communication team in place to handle the event—in fact, the company did not appoint a public relations manager to its management team until 1993, 4 years after the incident; Exxon established its media center in Valdez, a location too small and too remote to handle the onslaught of media attention; and the company acted defensively in its response to its publics, even laying blame, at times, on other groups such as the Coast Guard. These responses also happened within days of the incident.

== Lessons learned in crisis management ==

===Impact of catastrophes on shareholder value===
One of the foremost recognized studies conducted on the impact of a catastrophe on the stock value of an organization was completed by Dr Rory Knight and Dr Deborah Pretty (1996, Templeton College, University of Oxford – commissioned by the Sedgewick Group). This study undertook a detailed analysis of the stock price (post impact) of organizations that had experienced catastrophes. The study identified organizations that recovered and even exceeded pre-catastrophe stock price, (&quot;Recoverers&quot;), and those that did not recover on stock price, (&quot;Non-recoverers&quot;). The average cumulative impact on shareholder value for the recoverers was 5% plus on their original stock value. So the net impact on shareholder value by this stage was actually positive. The non-recoverers remained more or less unchanged between days 5 and 50 after the catastrophe, but suffered a net negative cumulative impact of almost 15% on their stock price up to one year afterwards.

One of the key conclusions of this study is that &quot;Effective management of the consequences of
catastrophes would appear to be a more significant factor than whether catastrophe insurance hedges the economic impact of the catastrophe&quot;.

While there are technical elements to this report it is highly recommended to those who wish to engage their senior management in the value of crisis management.

===Crisis as opportunity===
Hilburg proffers that every crisis is an opportunity to showcase an institution&#x27;s character, its commitment to its brand promise and its institutional values. To address such shareholder impact, management must move from a mindset that manages crisis to one that generates crisis leadership. 
 Research shows that organizational contributory factors affect the tendency of executives to adopt an effective &quot;crisis as opportunity&quot; mindset. Since pressure is both a precipitator and consequence of crisis, leaders who perform well under pressure can effectively guide the organization through such crisis.
James contends that most executives focus on communications and public relations as a reactive strategy. While the company&#x27;s reputation with shareholders, financial well-being, and survival are all at stake, potential damage to reputation can result from the actual management of the crisis issue. Additionally, companies may stagnate as their risk management group identifies whether a crisis is sufficiently &quot;statistically significant&quot;.
Crisis leadership, on the other hand, immediately addresses both the damage and implications for the company&#x27;s present and future conditions, as well as opportunities for improvement.
== Public-sector crisis management ==
Corporate America is not the only community that is vulnerable to the perils of a crisis. Whether a school shooting, a public health crisis or a terrorist attack that leaves the public seeking comfort in the calm, steady leadership of an elected official, no sector of society is immune to crisis. In response to that reality, crisis management policies, strategies and practices have been developed and adapted across multiple disciplines.

===Schools and crisis management===
In the wake of the Columbine High School Massacre, the September 11 attacks in 2001, and shootings on college campuses including the Virginia Tech massacre, educational institutions at all levels are now focused on crisis management.

A national study conducted by the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) and Arkansas Children&#x27;s Hospital Research Institute (ACHRI) has shown that many public school districts have important deficiencies in their emergency and disaster plans (The School Violence Resource Center, 2003). In response the Resource Center has organized a comprehensive set of resources to aid schools is the development of crisis management plans. A study conducted by researchers Min Liu, Isaac Blankson and Laurel Servies Brooks in regards to emergency response plans resulted in many findings including affirmative information that emergency and crisis training in institutions of higher education is lacking. They also found that college and university staff&#x27;s knowledge and self-efficacy are positively correlated, meaning that the more knowledgeable they are, the more confident they feel in responding efficiently to various crisis events, further backing the need for crisis management plans and communication in educational institutions.

Crisis-management plans cover a wide variety of incidents including bomb threats, child abuse, natural disasters, suicide, drug abuse and gang activities – just to list a few. In a similar fashion the plans aim to address all audiences in need of information including parents, the media and law enforcement officials.

===Government and crisis management===
Historically, government at all levels—local, state, and national—has played a large role in crisis management. Indeed, many political philosophers have considered this to be one of the primary roles of government. Emergency services, such as fire and police departments at the local level, and the United States National Guard at the federal level, often play integral roles in crisis situations.

To help coordinate communication during the response phase of a crisis, the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) within the Department of Homeland Security administers the National Response Plan (NRP). This plan is intended to integrate public and private response by providing a common language and outlining a chain-of-command when multiple parties are mobilized. It is based on the premise that incidents should be handled at the lowest organizational level possible. The NRP recognizes the private sector as a key partner in domestic incident management, particularly in the area of critical infrastructure protection and restoration.

The NRP is a companion to the National Incidence Management System, which acts as a more general template for incident management regardless of cause, size, or complexity.

FEMA offers free web-based training on the National Response Plan through the Emergency Management Institute.

Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) is a relatively recent mechanism that facilitates crisis communication across different mediums and systems. CAP helps create a consistent emergency alert format to reach geographically and linguistically diverse audiences through both audio and visual mediums.

=== People and crisis management ===
A group of international psychoanalysts started in 1994 with a project to contribute to crisis management in the sense of managing conflicts between national groups. They called themselves &quot;Partners in confronting collective atrocities&quot;. They began their work with the so-called Nazareth-Conferences – based on the model of &quot;Leicesterconferences&quot; having been developed by the Tavistock Institute.

===Elected officials and crisis management===
Historically, politics and crisis go hand in hand. In describing crisis, President Abraham Lincoln said,
&quot;We live in the midst of alarms, anxiety beclouds the future; we expect some new disaster with each newspaper we read&quot;.

Crisis management has become a defining feature of contemporary governance. In times of crisis, communities and members of organizations expect their public leaders to minimize the impact of the crisis at hand, while critics and bureaucratic competitors try to seize the moment to blame incumbent rulers and their policies. In this extreme environment, policymakers must somehow establish a sense of normality, and foster collective learning from the crisis experience.

In the face of crisis, leaders must deal with the strategic challenges they face, the political risks and opportunities they encounter, the errors they make, the pitfalls they need to avoid, and the paths away from crisis they may pursue. The necessity for management is even more significant with the advent of a 24-hour news cycle and an increasingly internet-savvy audience with ever-changing technology at its fingertips.

Public leaders have a special responsibility to help safeguard society from the adverse consequences of crisis. Experts in crisis management note that leaders who take this responsibility seriously would have to concern themselves with all crisis phases: the incubation stage, the onset, and the aftermath. Crisis leadership then involves five critical tasks: sense making, decision making, meaning making, terminating, and learning.

A brief description of the five facets of crisis leadership includes:

# Sense making may be considered as the classical situation assessment step in decision making.
# Decision making is both the act of coming to a decision as the implementation of that decision.
# Meaning making refers to crisis management as political communication.
# Terminating a crisis is only possible if the public leader correctly handles the accountability question.
# Learning, refers to the actual learning from a crisis is limited. The authors note, a crisis often opens a window of opportunity for reform for better or for worse.

=== Public sector crisis management outside the United States ===
While all countries encounter various crises over the course of their existence, they utilize different strategies that reflect their particular structure and circumstances. Autocratic and more centralized governments may address crises in ways that democratic countries could not. These distinctions present opportunities to compare numerous approaches to similar emergencies.

The COVID-19 crisis has proved to be a useful lens to view how crisis management differs by country. In democratic countries like Italy and Spain for example, health care is more decentralized and management is shared between the central and regional governments. While this decentralization may allow for greater autonomy and flexibility, during a major worldwide crisis, coordinating a response may become difficult. Several institutional challenges and political conflicts emerged because limited communication between agencies and two opposing parties controlling different regions and different levels of government. This was especially true in areas of Northern Italy where the regionalist Lega party had a significant influence. In Spain, basic coordination between different governments was not established until a second COVID wave struck.

Iran, an autocratic country, was able to manage their COVID-19 crisis centrally while allowing for flexibility on the ground. it maintained its system of central control but also utilized behavioral economics to motivate citizen compliance and participation. After years of sanctions, Iran was able to develop a level of self-reliance that proved useful during this public health crisis. The government implemented universal measures that did not vary from region to region and developed a citizen focused approach that encouraged engagement. The Iranians produced their own medical supplies and developed and distributed domestic vaccines. Iran enjoyed a greater degree of success in managing the crisis than in Italy and Spain. However, Iran was not immune to some of the issues occurring elsewhere. The government still struggled to enforce compliance measures and some citizens did engage in activities that were restricted.

One noteworthy challenge in the COVID-19 crisis was the impact of Ideological differences on the decision-making and implementation processes of crisis management. Ideology plays a significant role in how institutions are constructed and in the degree of coordination between rival factions in government. The Western emphasis on decentralization has in some ways hindered the effectiveness of government responses to the spread of COVID-19. By relegating the management of health care to regions, political parties are able to implement conflicting measures that fail to achieve the greater national or international goals.

In 2022, the Scientific Advice Mechanism to the European Commission published a major piece of advice on strategic crisis management in the European Union, which included a detailed survey of existing emergency management institutions and mechanisms in Europe as well as recommendations for updating and improving the Union&#x27;s resilience to and preparedness for emergencies. One of the scientists&#x27; key recommendations was that &quot;existing and future legislation and instruments should be integrated in a framework that is capable of dealing with increasingly systemic and large-scale crises in a structural way&quot;.

=== International cooperation on crisis management ===
Although most studies focus on one or two country-specific examples, it is also important to consider crisis management at a global level. Because each state pursues its own style of crisis management, developing international coordination has proven to be complicated. International organizations and multinational corporations will struggle to adjust their operations to conflicting practices in different countries. Global health organizations have also received scrutiny from around the world for falling short of expectations during previous crises which has deepened the distrust of these international groups. These problems are alarming because global markets continue to integrate and supply chains grow between countries. Crises that impact more than one country will occur more often and will have greater consequences.

<text>Flying Officer Lloyd Allan Trigg VC DFC (5 May 1914 or 5 June 1914 – 11 August 1943), of Houhora, New Zealand, was a pilot in the RNZAF during World War II. He was a posthumous recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy for British and Commonwealth armed forces, and received the award for pressing home an attack on a German U-boat in August 1943. He was killed in the action. His award is unique, as it was awarded on evidence solely provided by the enemy, for an action in which there were no surviving Allied witnesses to corroborate his gallantry.

==Early life==
Lloyd Allan Trigg, the son of Arthur and Cecelia Louisa Trigg (née White), was born at Houhora, Northland, New Zealand on 5 May 1914, or 5 June 1914, and was educated at Whangarei Boys&#x27; High School, where he served in the school cadet force. He later studied at Auckland University College and then took up farming in the Victoria Valley, as well as serving as a non commissioned officer in the part-time North Auckland Rifles prior to World War II.

==Military career==
Trigg joined the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) as a trainee pilot on 15 June 1941. On enlistment, his occupation was recorded as &quot;machinery salesman&quot; and he was married with two sons, having married Nola McGarvey in 1938. After completing basic training at the RNZAF base at Levin, Trigg attended pilot training school at No. 3 EFS in Canada. Noted for his hard work and willingness to learn, he was recommended for a commission. He obtained his pilot&#x27;s wings on 16 January 1942, and was commissioned as a pilot officer. After converting onto the Lockheed Hudson and completing further training at a reconnaissance school, Trigg was promoted to flying officer and embarked for the UK in October 1942, to join Coastal Command.

He was posted to West Africa in November 1942 and joined 200 Squadron RAF in January 1943. As a first pilot he took part in over 46 operational reconnaissance patrols, convoy escort flights and anti-submarine patrols. Having previously operated Hudsons, the squadron later converted to the maritime version of the B-24 Liberator. He was an experienced pilot (he had already been awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross) having been involved in two attacks against U-boats in February 1943.

He was flying his first operational flight in a Liberator V over the Atlantic from his base at Yundumn, West Africa (now Banjul, The Gambia), when on 11 August 1943 he engaged the under the command of &quot;Oberleutnant&quot; Klemens Schamong. His aircraft received several catastrophic hits from the submarine&#x27;s anti-aircraft guns during its approach to the submarine and was on fire as Trigg made his final attack.

After dropping its depth charges, Trigg&#x27;s Liberator crashed 300 yards behind its victim, killing Trigg and his crew. The only surviving witnesses to Trigg&#x27;s actions were the U-boat crew members. The badly damaged U-boat sank soon after the attack but a small group of survivors (including Schamong) were spotted by an RAF Short Sunderland of No. 204 Squadron in the dinghy of the crashed Liberator, drifting off the coast of West Africa. They were rescued by a Royal Navy vessel, , the next day, and the German crew reported the incident, recommending Trigg be decorated for his bravery. On 2 November 1943, Trigg was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions.
The Victoria Cross was presented to Trigg&#x27;s widow, Nola, by the Governor General of New Zealand, Sir Cyril Newall, on 28 May 1944. At his wife&#x27;s request, the presentation took place at the Trigg family home so that family and friends could be present. It was the last Victoria Cross to be won by a New Zealander; the Victoria Cross for New Zealand, established in 1999, is now the highest gallantry award that can be bestowed on a New Zealand serviceman.

Since Trigg has no burial place, he is commemorated on the Malta Memorial to the 2,298 Commonwealth aircrew who lost their lives around the Mediterranean during the Second World War and who have no known grave.

==Citation==
The citation reads as follows:

==Legacy==

In 2007, New Zealand researcher Arthur Arculus tracked down Klemens Schamong near Kiel. The commander said of Trigg&#x27;s effort &quot;such a gallant fighter as Trigg would have been decorated in Germany with the highest medal or order&quot;.

In May 1998, Trigg&#x27;s VC was sold at auction by Spinks of London for £138,000, the highest price ever realised for a VC at that time. The seller was not believed to have been a relative of Trigg and the medals were purchased on behalf of the Michael Ashcroft Trust, the holding institution for Lord Ashcroft&#x27;s VC Collection. The VC is now on display at the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum.

Trigg Avenue, Rotorua is named in his honour.

*Victoria Cross
*Distinguished Flying Cross
*1939–45 Star

<doc id="348273" wikidata="Q6127123" url="?curid=348273" title="Jam sandwich (police car)">
<text>In British slang, a &quot;jam sandwich&quot; or &quot;jam butty&quot; is a police car with a red stripe applied to the side.
==History==

The term &quot;jam sandwich&quot; came into common use in the 1970s, as police cars changed from block colour schemes such as the blue and white &quot;panda car&quot; to broad fluorescent sidestriped liveries on white or grey base paint. A thin amber sidestripe, fitted using fluorescent tape and vinyl sheeting, was first applied to vehicles of the East Sussex Constabulary in 1965, introduced on the recommendation of Chief Constable George Terry. Some forces, such as the Hertfordshire Constabulary, would later introduce a blue border around the sidestripe. This livery scheme was seen as reminiscent of jam sandwiched between two slices of white bread, hence the name. The slang was popularised on TV shows such as &quot;The Bill&quot;, &quot;The Sweeney&quot; and &quot;Minder&quot;; as well as spreading through the use of CB radio. 
The &quot;jam sandwich&quot; first came into use with London&#x27;s Metropolitan Police in 1978, first applied on a fleet of new high-performance Rover SD1 traffic cars. Marked vehicles were initially finished in base white paint with &quot;jam sandwich&quot; livery applied on each side, however the base colour was changed to silver from 2002 to help improve a vehicle&#x27;s resale value when it was retired from police use. 

===Replacement===

The &quot;jam sandwich&quot; livery on police vehicles across the United Kingdom has today been replaced by Battenburg markings, first introduced in 1998 on the recommendation that the livery makes the vehicle easily identifiable by oncoming drivers as a police vehicle from at least . As part of a move to promote &quot;High Visibility Policing&quot; in conjunction with the use of force logos, by 2003, 76% of forces had begun adopting the markings as well as a &quot;half battenburg&quot; variant for urban and suburban patrols. This livery began to be introduced on new vehicles delivered to the Metropolitan Police from November 2012. 

However, a handful of older vehicles are still marked in &quot;jam sandwich&quot; livery in some police forces in the United Kingdom. In the Metropolitan Police, the term &#x27;jam sandwich&#x27; now colloquially refers to the car&#x27;s livery only, as worn by remaining older vehicles and public order carriers that have not yet been replaced.

<text>Anthrax is a genus of bombyliid flies, commonly known as &quot;bee-flies&quot; due to their resemblance to bees. Most are dull black flies, and are usually small to medium in size, , and many species have striking wing patterns.

&quot;Anthrax&quot; is a very large genus. While worldwide in distribution, most species are from the Palaearctic and Afrotropic regions. The genus includes species parasitic on tiger beetles – an unusual trait among the bee-flies. &quot;A. anthrax&quot; larvae parasitize bees. Many North American species parasitize solitary wasps.

The type species is &quot;Musca morio&quot; Linnaeus, 1758, later found to be a misidentification of &quot;Musca anthrax&quot; Schrank, 1781.

<doc id="348276" wikidata="Q323653" url="?curid=348276" title="John Flansburgh">
<text>John Conant Flansburgh (born May 6, 1960) is an American musician. He is half of the long-standing Brooklyn, New York–based alternative rock duo They Might Be Giants with John Linnell, for which he writes, sings, and plays rhythm guitar.

==Early life==
Flansburgh was born in Lexington, Massachusetts. His father, Earl Flansburgh, was a well-known Boston architect. His mother, Polly Flansburgh, is the founder and president of Boston By Foot. Her father, Brigadier General Ralph Hospital, was an artillery commander in the U.S. Army in the Italian Campaign during World War II. His brother, Paxus Calta (born Earl Schuyler Flansburgh), is an anti-nuclear activist and political organizer.

Flansburgh attended the George Washington University, where he learned to play guitar while working as a parking garage attendant, then Antioch College and Pratt Institute, where he graduated with an arts degree.

===Since 1982: They Might Be Giants===
Flansburgh co-founded They Might Be Giants, with longtime friend John Linnell, in 1982 while a student at Pratt Institute. The two share singing and songwriting duties, with Flansburgh on guitar, in addition to performing a variety of instruments when the need arises. In the 2002 documentary &quot;Gigantic (A Tale of Two Johns)&quot;, he was described as holding a leadership role in the group, managing most details of their live act and handling much of the promotion effort.

As a songwriter, Flansburgh enjoys a mix of styles; many of his songs have an absurdist and satirical bent, but he often breaks for more earnest and romantic themes as well. He penned and performed vocals on the group&#x27;s first Grammy Award-winning effort, &quot;Boss of Me&quot;, which charted in Europe and served as theme song to the hit television series &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot;.

==Side projects==

Flansburgh has pursued a number of solo projects during his time with They Might Be Giants. His band Mono Puff recorded two full-length albums and four EPs in the late 1990s and toured occasionally. The band also included bassist Hal Cragin and drummer Steve Calhoon, plus various guest collaborators.

Flansburgh also ran a subscription-based record label called the Hello Recording Club. Flansburgh has also directed music videos for such artists as Soul Coughing, Ben Folds Five, Frank Black and the Catholics, Harvey Danger, and Jonathan Coulton. He also produced Coulton&#x27;s album, &quot;Artificial Heart&quot;. In 2004, as a one-off, Flansburgh produced and starred in the Off-Broadway musical &quot;People Are Wrong!&quot;, which was co-written by his wife, Robin Goldwasser.

In 1998, Flansburgh guest-starred as himself in the season 4 finale of the Cartoon Network animated series &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;. In 2004, Flansburgh created and hosted a series on WNYC entitled &quot;Now Hear This&quot;. The program spotlighted a variety of his musical interests, featuring interviews with artists such as Stephin Merritt, David Byrne, Matt Stone, and The Darkness. While no longer in production, it continues to be archived on the station&#x27;s website. In 2007, Flansburgh played a short role as &quot;Computer&quot; in the Adult Swim comedy series &quot;&quot;.

In 2023, Flansburgh released a solo EP entitled &quot;Forest / Trees&quot;.

==Personal life==
Since 1996, he has been married to musician Robin Goldwasser, with whom he occasionally performs. Flansburgh considers himself politically leftist and has spoken of his support for Bernie Sanders for President. Flansburgh is left-handed.

On June 8, 2022, while in a ride share on his way home from a They Might Be Giants show at the Bowery Ballroom, Flansburgh&#x27;s ride was involved in a collision with a drunk driver. Flansburgh had several broken ribs, many of which had multiple fractures, but no vital organs were damaged.

==Instruments==
Flansburgh frequently plays a red Gibson ES-335, a sonic blue Fender Telecaster, a candy apple red Fender Jazzmaster, and a goldtop Gibson Les Paul. He owns a custom-made gold Mojo guitar, known as the &quot;Chessmaster&quot;. He designed the body himself, taking inspiration from the geometric shapes of old guitar cases.

<text>Formosa Magazine, also known as Mei-li-tao (), was a magazine created by &quot;Tangwai&quot; individuals in Taiwan during the summer of 1979. It opposed the Kuomintang&#x27;s political monopoly in the Republic of China government. A police raid of the &quot;Formosa&quot; Press caused the Kaohsiung Incident in December 1979.

There were 61 participants; less than ten were truly active, namely,
* Huang Hsin-chieh, publisher
* Chang Chun-hung, chief editor
* Shih Ming-teh, general manager
* Hsu Hsin-liang, editor
* Annette Lu, editor
* Lin Yi-hsiung, circulation manager
* Yao Chia-wen, circulation controller

The opening celebration took place in Mandarina Crown Hotel (中泰賓館) in the afternoon of 8 September 1979. A blockade by the military ensued, sometimes known as the Mandarina Crown Hotel Incident. For the next three months until the raid, branches were opened throughout Taiwan. Opening were followed by speeches and conferences.

Formosa Magazine was owned by The Formosa Plastics Group, a group of companies originally founded in 1954 in part funded by an American economic aid mission.

<text>The Kabars (), also known as Qavars (Qabars) or Khavars were Khazar rebels who joined Magyar tribes and the Rus&#x27; Khaganate confederations in the 9th century CE.

== Sources ==

The Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII is the principal source of the Kabars&#x27; history. He dedicated a whole chapterchapter 39to the Kabars (or &quot;Kabaroi&quot;) in his &quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot;, which was completed around 950. The Emperor described the Kabars as &quot;a race of Khazars&quot; who had risen up against the Khagan. The uprising was crushed, and some of them were massacred, but others escaped and joined the Magyars in the Pontic steppes.

== History ==
The Kabars rebelled against the Khazar Khaganate in the early ninth century; the rebellion was notable enough to be described in Constantine Porphyrogenitus&#x27;s work &quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot;. Subsequently the Kabars were expelled from Levedia in the Khazar Khaganate leading the Magyar tribal confederacy called &quot;Hét-Magyar&quot; (meaning &quot;seven Hungarians&quot;) to Etelköz while others under Khan-Tuvan sought refuge by joining the Rus&#x27; people. One of the names on the Kievian Letter is &quot;Kiabar&quot;, showing that some Kabars settled in Kiev with the Rus&#x27; as well. According to Magocsi, &quot;A violent civil war took place during the 820s [...] The losers of the internal political struggle, known as Kabars, fled northward to the Varangian Rus&#x27; in the upper Volga region, near Rostov, and southward to the Magyars, who formerly had been loyal vassals of the Khazars. The presence of Kabar political refugees from Khazaria among the Varangian traders in Rostov helped to raise the latter&#x27;s prestige, with the consequence that by the 830s a new power center known as the Rus&#x27; Khaganate had come into existence.&quot; 

In 894, the Byzantine emperor Leo VI, then at war with Simeon, the Bulgarian czar (893–927), called the Hungarians to his aid. The Magyars, led by Árpád, crossed the Danube and attacked Bulgaria. The Bulgarians, in turn, appealed to the Pechenegs, now masters of the steppe, who attacked the Hungarians in the rear. Toward 850 or 860, driven from Levedia by the Pechenegs, they entered Atelkuzu (Etelköz) taking refuge in the mountains of Transylvania. At that moment, Arnulf, duke of Carinthia, at war with the Slav ruler Svatopluk, prince of Great Moravia (885–894), decided like the Byzantines to appeal to the Hungarians. The Hungarians overcame Svatopluk, who disappeared in the conflict (895). The Magyars reached the Danube river basin around 880. As the vanguard and rearguard, the Kabars, or Cowari as they were known in Latin, assisted in the Magyar invasion of Pannonia and the subsequent formation of the Principality of Hungary in the late 9th century. Great Moravia collapsed, and the Hungarians took up permanent abode in Hungary (907).

The presence of a Turkic aristocracy among the Hungarians could explain the Byzantine protocol by which, in the exchange of ambassadors under Constantine Porphyrogenitus, Hungarian rulers were always referred to as &quot;Princes of the Turks&quot;.

==Archaeological theories on religion==
At least some of the Khazar elite apparently converted to Judaism, but this might not have included Kabars. The conversion did not seem to have impacted most of the population in the Khazar Khaganate: paganism remained as the religion of the majority of the population, and there were also notable Christian and Muslim groups. Since the conversion to Judaism was initiated by the ruler, the theory that the rebels against the ruler would have joined to the conversion has been questioned. There is also debate about the date of Kabars joining to Magyars and it could have happened before the Khazar elite&#x27;s conversion. Still, according to a theory, graves with Jewish symbols found in modern-day Čelarevo, Serbia could be related to Kabars. 

The Kabars supposedly left scattered remains and some cultural and linguistic imprints, but this is debatable.

<text>Norman Russell Young (February 23, 1946 – April 14, 2021) was an American guitarist, vocalist and songwriter, best known as one of the frontmen in the influential country rock and Americana band Poco.

A virtuoso on pedal steel guitar, he was celebrated for the ability to get a Hammond B3 organ sound out of the instrument by playing it through a Leslie speaker cabinet and as an innovator of producing other rock sounds from the instrument.

==Early life==
Young was born in Long Beach, California and raised in Colorado. He began playing lap steel guitar at age 6, and taught guitar and steel guitar lessons during his high school years at Jefferson High School, Lakewood, Colorado with George Grantham. During that time, he also played country music in late night bars. Young played in a well known Denver psychedelic rock band &quot;Boenzee Cryque&quot;.

==Career==
===Poco===
In the late 1960s, an acquaintance of Young&#x27;s, Miles Thomas, became the road manager for Buffalo Springfield. Richie Furay and Jim Messina needed a steel guitarist for the Furay ballad &quot;Kind Woman&quot; on their final album &quot;Last Time Around&quot; and after Thomas told Young about the opportunity, Young was hired. Along with Furay and Messina, Young became a founding member of Poco in 1968 upon the former band&#x27;s demise. Drummer George Grantham and bass player Randy Meisner rounded out the original Poco lineup. The band&#x27;s membership fluctuated over the years. After Furay left the group, Young took on more song writing responsibility, along with Paul Cotton and Timothy B. Schmit. Young is best known for writing the Poco songs &quot;Rose of Cimarron&quot; and &quot;Crazy Love&quot;. In 2013, Young was inducted into the Steel Guitar Hall of Fame. At the end of 2013, Young announced his, what turned out to be a short-lived, retirement.

A few shows were booked into 2014 including three farewell shows in Florida. One of those shows was a performance in a recording studio in front of a live audience for a DVD document of the band&#x27;s live show. Young said there could be some one-offs in the future after that, but the band would not be actively touring as before. Young and Jack Sundrud wrote and recorded music for children&#x27;s story videos as the &quot;Session Cats&quot;. Young continued to do guest performances with former members of Poco and other country rock artists. Young released his first solo album in 2017 on Blue Élan Records,
&quot;Waitin&#x27; For The Sun&quot;. Young released his first new music since &quot;Waitin&#x27; for the Sun&quot; on March 22, 2019. The new tune, &quot;Listen to Your Heart&quot;, was released digitally and benefited a local Steelville, Missouri animal charity, Santana&#x27;s Hope for Paws (Friends of Steelville, MO Pound) Animal Shelter.

==Death==
Young died of a heart attack on April 14, 2021. He was 75 years old.
