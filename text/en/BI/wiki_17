<text>The Iceni ( , ) or Eceni were an ancient Celtic tribe of eastern Britain during the Iron Age and early Roman era. Their territory included present-day Norfolk and parts of Suffolk and Cambridgeshire, and bordered the area of the Corieltauvi to the west, and the Catuvellauni and Trinovantes to the south. In the Roman period, their capital was Venta Icenorum at modern-day Caistor St Edmund.

Julius Caesar does not mention the Iceni in his account of his invasions of Britain in 55 and 54 BC, though they may be related to the Cenimagni, whom Caesar notes as living north of the River Thames at that time. The Iceni were a significant power in eastern Britain during Claudius&#x27; conquest of Britain in AD 43, following which they allied with Rome. Increasing Roman influence on their affairs led to revolt in AD 47, though they remained nominally independent under king Prasutagus until his death around AD 60. Roman encroachment after Prasutagus&#x27; death led his wife Boudica to launch a major revolt from 60–61. Boudica&#x27;s uprising seriously endangered Roman rule in Britain and resulted in the burning of Londinium and other cities. The Romans finally crushed the rebellion, and the Iceni were increasingly incorporated into the Roman province.

==Name==
The meaning of the name &quot;Iceni&quot; () is uncertain and modern suggestions are speculative. 

Icenian coins dating from the 1st century AD use the spelling &quot;ECEN&quot;: an article by D. F. Allen titled &quot;The Coins of the Iceni&quot;, discusses the difference between coins with the inscription &quot;ECE&quot; versus coins with &quot;ECEN&quot;. This difference, Allen posits, tells archaeologists and historians when Prasutagus started his reign because the coins did not start reading the name of the tribe until around AD 47. Allen suggests that when Antedios was king of the Iceni, the coins did not yet have the name of the tribe on them but instead the name of its ruler, stating, &quot;If so, the coins suggest that the Prasutagus era commenced only after the events of 47&quot;.

The word &quot;echen&quot; in Welsh as given by the Owen-Pughe etymological dictionary of 1832, means origin or source; a tribe. The current &quot;Dictionary of the Welsh Language&quot; defines &quot;echen&quot; as &quot;stock, lineage, family, tribe, source, origin, nature&quot;, cognate with Cornish &quot;eghen&quot;.

In his 1658 treatise &quot;Hydriotaphia, Urn Burial&quot;, the English polymath Sir Thomas Browne suggests that &quot;Iken&quot; was the old name for the River Ouse, where the Iceni were said to have originated and from which they might have derived their name. Robert Henry (1771) refers to a suggested naming from the Brittonic word &quot;ychen&quot; meaning oxen. Ych (s.) and Ychen (pl.) are still used in modern Welsh. The final &#x27;-i&#x27; is a Latin nominative plural case ending added to the two-syllable tribal name.

==Archaeology==

Archaeological evidence of the Iceni includes torcs — heavy rings of gold, silver or electrum worn around the neck and shoulders.
The Iceni began producing coins around 10 BC. Their coins were a distinctive adaptation of the Gallo-Belgic &quot;face/horse&quot; design, and in some early issues, most numerous near Norwich, the horse was replaced with a boar. Some coins are inscribed ECENI, making them the only coin-producing group to use their tribal name on coins. The earliest personal name to appear on coins is Antedios (about 10 BC), and other abbreviated names like AESU and SAEMU follow.

It has been discovered that the name of Antedios’ succeeding ruler Prasutagus appears on the coins as well. H. R. Mossop in his article “An Elusive Icenian Legend” discusses coins that were discovered by D. F. Allen in Joist Fen, Suffolk, and states, “It is the coins Nos. 6 and 7 which give an advance in the obverse reading, confirming Allen’s attractive reading PRASTO, with its implied allusion to Prasutagus”.

Sir Thomas Browne, the first English archaeological writer, in 1658 said of the Roman occupation, Boudica and Iceni coins:
 That &quot;Britain&quot; was notably populous is undeniable, from that expression of &quot;Caesar&quot;. That the Romans themselves were early in no small Numbers, Seventy Thousand with their associates slain by &quot;Bouadicea&quot;, affords a sure account... And no small number of silver pieces near Norwich; with a rude head upon the obverse, an ill-formed horse on the reverse, with the Inscriptions &quot;Ic. Duro.T.&quot; whether implying &quot;Iceni, Durotriges, Tascia,&quot; or &quot;Trinobantes&quot;, we leave to higher conjecture. The British Coyns afford conjecture of early habitation in these parts, though the city of Norwich arose from the ruins of &quot;Venta&quot;, and though perhaps not without some habitation before, was enlarged, built, and nominated by the Saxons.

The Icknield Way, an ancient trackway linking East Anglia to the Chilterns, may be named after the Iceni.

John A. Davies and Tony Gregory conducted archaeological surveys of Roman coins that appeared during the period of Roman occupation of Norfolk. Their study showed that the bulk of the coins circulating before AD 60 was Icenian rather than Roman. They speculated that Roman coins were not adapted into the Iceni area until after AD 60. The coin study also showed that there was not a regular supply of Roman coinage from year to year: 
 The predominance of specific issues at sites across the province and relative scarcity of coins of some emperors illustrates the point that supply was sporadic and that there were periods when little or no fresh coinage was sent to Britain from the imperial mints. 
In certain rural regions of Norfolk, Davies and Gregory speculate that the Iceni farmers were impacted very little by the civitas, seeing as there is a scarce presence of coinage and treasures. On the other hand, their surveys found &quot;coin-rich temple sites, which appear to have served as centres for periodic fairs and festivals and provided locations for markets and commercial transactions within their complexes and environs. In such rural areas, producers and consumers would have been attracted to these sites for commerce from afield&quot;

At the Norwich Castle Museum, a dedicated gallery includes a reproduction of an Iceni chariot.

==Roman invasion==
Tacitus records that the Iceni were not conquered in the Claudian invasion of AD 43. It is uncertain whether the Iceni formed part of the British resistance. The war against the Roman landings was led by the Catuvellauni who had themselves not long subdued the Iceni&#x27;s southern neighbours Trinovantes; history does not record whether the Iceni viewed the Romans as a dangerous threat, or perhaps as a welcome counterweight to Catuvellauni expansion. It is likely that the Iceni were among the &#x27;eleven kings&#x27; who surrendered to Claudius at Camulodunum. At that point, the Iceni retained independence as a client kingdom. 

In 47 the Iceni rebelled after the governor, Publius Ostorius Scapula, ordered them and other British client kingdoms to disarm. The Iceni were defeated by Ostorius in a fierce battle at a fortified place, the most obvious known candidate for this battle being at Stonea Camp in Cambridgeshire. Nonetheless, the Iceni were still allowed to retain their independence. 

A second and more serious uprising took place in AD 61. Prasutagus, the wealthy, pro-Roman Icenian king, who, according to a section in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; titled &quot;Roman Britain, British Leaders&quot;, was leader of the Iceni between AD 43 and 50 (Todd 4), had died. It was common practice for a Roman client king to leave his kingdom to Rome on his death, but Prasutagus had attempted to preserve his line by bequeathing his kingdom — which Allen believes was located in Breckland, near Norwich — jointly to the Emperor and his own daughters. The Romans ignored this, and the procurator Catus Decianus seized his entire estate. Prasutagus&#x27;s widow, Boudica, was flogged, and her daughters were raped. At the same time, Roman financiers called in their loans. While the governor, Gaius Suetonius Paulinus, was campaigning in Wales, Boudica led the Iceni and the neighbouring Trinovantes in a large-scale revolt:

...a terrible disaster occurred in Britain. Two cities were sacked, eighty thousand of the Romans and of their allies perished, and the island was lost to Rome. Moreover, all this ruin was brought upon the Romans by a woman, a fact which in itself caused them the greatest shame... But the person who was chiefly instrumental in rousing the natives and persuading them to fight the Romans, the person who was thought worthy to be their leader and who directed the conduct of the entire war, was Buduica, a Briton woman of the royal family and possessed of greater intelligence than often belongs to women... In stature she was very tall, in appearance most terrifying, in the glance of her eye most fierce, and her voice was harsh; a great mass of the tawniest hair fell to her hips; around her neck was a large golden necklace; and she wore a tunic of divers colours over which a thick mantle was fastened with a brooch. This was her invariable attire.

The revolt caused the destruction and looting of Camulodunum (Colchester), Londinium (London), and Verulamium (St Albans) before finally being defeated by Suetonius Paulinus and his legions. Although the Britons outnumbered the Romans greatly, they lacked the superior discipline and tactics that won the Romans a decisive victory. The battle took place at an unknown location, possibly somewhere along Watling Street. Today, a large statue of Boudica wielding a sword and charging upon a chariot, called &quot;Boadicea and Her Daughters&quot;, can be seen in London on the north bank of the Thames by Westminster Bridge.

==After the revolt==

The fate of the Iceni immediately after the rebellion is not clearly recorded. The rebellious Britons were subjected to harsh retaliatory measures by Suetonius Paulinus, until he was recalled and replaced by a governor with a more conciliatory approach. Further, Roman historians note that the British had neglected their fields and crops, leading to famine. 

Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geographia&quot;, at section 2,3,21, names people called Σιμενοι in the original Greek, but usually thought to be a copying error for Ικενοι (Icenoi), as having a town called Venta. Venta, also mentioned in the &quot;Ravenna Cosmography&quot;, and the &quot;Antonine Itinerary&quot;, was a settlement near the village of Caistor St. Edmund, some 8 kilometres (5 mi) south of present-day Norwich, and about 2 kilometres (1.5 mi) from the Bronze Age Henge at Arminghall.

Venta Icenorum may have been the &quot;civitas&quot; capital of the Iceni following the rebellion.

==Post-Roman period==
Ken Dark suggests that there was a period of depopulation of the homelands of the Iceni during the fourth century. This was quickly followed by the settlement of Germanic speakers from the continent, beginning at the start of the fifth century. Toby Martin has identified the region as one in which a mass migration of these incomers likely occurred; there are particularly few Celtic toponyms in most of East Anglia.

Suggestions have been made that the descendants of the Iceni survived longer in the Fens. In the &quot;Life of Saint Guthlac&quot; – a biography of the East Anglian hermit who lived in the Fenland during the early 8th century – it is stated that Saint Guthlac was attacked on several occasions by demons who spoke Brittonic languages living in the Fens at that time. Bertram Colgrave and Lindy Brady have argued that this passage cannot be taken literally, as these &quot;Britons&quot; seem to have been intended to represent figments of Guthlac&#x27;s imagination rather than real people. However, several place names do suggest a longer British presence in the region. These include Chatteris, Chettisham and King&#x27;s Lynn, all of which seem to contain Brittonic elements. A number of lost toponyms (such as &quot;Bretlond&quot; and &quot;Walecroft&quot;) also suggest land held by Britons well into the Anglo-Saxon era.

<doc id="342147" wikidata="Q1136183" url="?curid=342147" title="100-yen shop">
<text>are common Japanese shops in the vein of American dollar stores. Stocking a variety of items such as decorations, stationery, cup noodles, slippers, containers, batteries, spoons and bowls, each item is priced at precisely 100 yen, which is considered attractive to Japanese consumers because it can be paid for with a single 100-yen coin. However, the current Japanese consumption tax of 8% (food and drinks) or 10% (other items) is also added, making a 100-yen purchase actually cost 108 or 110 yen. Larger items, like furniture and tools, may also cost more yet are still relatively affordable, usually costing less than 1000 yen. 

The four major chains are Daiso, Seria, Watts, and Can Do, which combined have over 5,500 locations across Japan as of 2012. A variation of the 100-yen shops are 99-yen shops. Daiei also operates 88-yen stores. Some shops, such as Lawson 100, specialize in certain items, such as groceries or natural goods, but this is less common than the variety store model. 

As of 2018, Daiso has over 2,800 stores throughout Japan, with 20-30 new stores opening every month. One of the largest 100-yen shops is the Daiso in the Tokyo neighborhood of Harajuku. It spans four stories and over .

Similar shops have opened around other parts of Asia as well, some operated by Japanese companies such as Daiso, which now has branches in 25 countries outside of Japan. In Hong Kong, department stores have opened their own 10-dollar-shops (JPY140) to compete in the market, thus there are now &quot;8-dollar-shops&quot; (JPY110) in Hong Kong, in order to compete with those lower prices.

100-yen shops are able to keep prices down by purchasing goods internationally and in bulk. These goods come from countries with lower production costs, namely China and Thailand.

==History==
The concept of stores that sell products at a uniformly low price dates back to the Edo period, when shops selling items for 19 mon and later 38 mon were popular. By the Meiji period, this had expanded to clothing stores and food stands, and stores selling only 1-yen items were not uncommon 

The first 100-yen shop in its modern form was opened in 1985 in Kasugai, Aichi prefecture by Akira Matsubayashi, the founder of the company Life Standard. It was called &#x27;100-yen Shop&#x27; (100円ショップ). This model was eventually adopted by Hirotake Yano, the founder of Daiso Industries Co. Ltd., who opened the first Daiso store in 1991. 

Sales of 100-yen shops were &quot;expected to top more than 100 billion yen&quot; in the 1999 financial year.

<text>The West Midland Bird Club is the UK&#x27;s largest regional ornithological society. It has been serving birdwatchers and ornithologists in the four English counties of Staffordshire, Warwickshire, Worcestershire and (since its separation from the aforesaid counties in 1974) the Metropolitan West Midlands, with lectures, field trips, research, a bulletin and an annual report, since 1929. It is a registered charity in England and Wales, number 213311.

There are branches in Kidderminster, Solihull, and Stafford.

It manages the Belvide Reservoir nature reserve in Staffordshire, the Harborne Reserve in Birmingham, and the Ladywalk Reserve in North Warwickshire, as well as running an access-permit scheme for Blithfield Reservoir and Gailey Reservoir in Staffordshire. The Club sponsors bird feeding stations at Cannock Chase (Staffordshire) and Draycote Water (Warwickshire).

Bill Oddie has been the Club&#x27;s president since 1999.

== History ==

The Club was founded as the Birmingham Bird Club, by W. E. Groves and friends on 1 November 1929. The name changed to Birmingham and District Bird Club in 1945, to The Birmingham and West Midland Bird Club in 1947, and the current name was adopted in 1959.

It co-founded and still helps to manage the Bardsey Bird and Field Observatory and was instrumental in securing Brandon Marsh as a nature reserve.

A successful &quot;West Midland Bird Distribution Survey&quot;, published privately in 1951, led to the club publishing the world&#x27;s first bird atlas, the &quot;Atlas of breeding birds of the West Midlands&quot;, in 1970.

Until 2010, the Club operated an information centre at Kingsbury Water Park (Warwickshire).

== President ==

Bill Oddie has been the Club&#x27;s president since 1999. His first published article on birds appeared in the Club&#x27;s 1962 Annual Report. He is first credited in the 1956 report, in which reports of his bird observations are tagged with his initials &quot;WEO&quot;.

He discussed his membership of the Club in one of his first forays in the world of television natural history, as the subject of a Nature Watch &quot;Special: Bill Oddie - Bird Watcher&quot;, in which he was interviewed by Julian Pettifer, at Bartley Reservoir and the Christopher Cadbury Wetland Reserve.

<doc id="342161" wikidata="Q4581143" url="?curid=342161" title="River Blythe">
<text>The River Blythe flows through the English Midlands from central Warwickshire, through the Borough of Solihull and on to Coleshill in north Warwickshire. It runs along the Meriden Gap in the Midlands Plateau, is fed by the River Cole and is a tributary of the River Tame beside the West Midland Bird Club&#x27;s Ladywalk reserve. This then joins the River Trent, whose waters reach the North Sea via the Humber Estuary.
The river rises at various sources near Earlswood Lakes, but the principal tributary is listed as Spring Brook (; ). From here it winds north east, skirting Cheswick Green, towards Solihull. Here it passes through a local wildlife park, Malvern and Brueton Park and Nature Reserve, where it briefly splits/outpours for approximately 250 metres to form Brueton Park Lake. From here it meanders east, past several old country houses—Old Berry Hall, Ravenshaw Hall and Eastcote Hall—before turning sharply south towards Barston, which is encircled within a large meander of the river. At Temple Balsall the Cuttle Brook feeds the river, which now arcs north, and again close by Barston. Past Hampton in Arden the river is fed by &quot;Shadow Brook&quot;, at &quot;Diddington Hall&quot;. Travelling further north it passes to the east of Coleshill, and is fed by the River Cole, only a few hundred yards before it itself feeds into the River Tame (; ), at Ladywalk Nature Reserve.
The river is &quot;a particularly fine example of a lowland river on clay&quot; according to its Sites of Special Scientific Interest citation. The SSSI was notified in 1989, and includes a stretch of the river from near its source to the point it joins the River Tame. The Blythe has a wide range of natural geographical features such as riffles, pools, small cliffs and meanders, combined with a high diversity of substrate types ranging from fine silt and clay in the lower reaches to sands and gravels in the upper and middle reaches. The structure of this river is very variable and diverse, and is important as a rare example of such in lowland Britain.
The diverse physical features of the Blythe are matched by its diverse plant communities. Botanically, the Blythe is one of the richest rivers in lowland England, with the most species-rich sections containing as many species as the very richest chalk streams. In addition, several damp, unimproved meadows occur along the length of the river; they receive some of their water from annual flooding and are largely dependent upon the river for the maintenance of a high water-table. As well as the rich and diverse flora, the river supports a diverse invertebrate community with a wide range of molluscs, oligochaetes and caddisflies.

However, physical modification to the watercourse and the riparian zone has impacted the functionality of the River Blythe, resulting in the SSSI&#x27;s condition labelled as &quot;unfavourable no change&quot; in 2017. The factors leading to this were mainly due to historic management; many sections of the river have been straightened, and the riparian zone modified and disrupted, upsetting the site&#x27;s ecological health and lowering the overall SSSI status.

The river is popular with anglers along much of its length, although in dry weather it can become shallow in places. Species to be found include perch, chub and dace with occasional summer carp being caught. The river also holds tench, bream and rudd and more recently a small number of barbel have been caught.

<text>Chris Sugden (1952 – 3 April 2024) was a Norfolk humorist, best known for his portrayal of fictional folk singer Sid Kipper, the younger half of the Kipper Family.
==Personal life==

Born in West Runton in 1952, Sugden initially studied pharmacy at Leicester Polytechnic before starting a PhD at the University of East Anglia. He is the author of &quot;Prewd and Prejudice&quot; (1994) in which the heroine Miriam Prewd spends a traumatic year of &#x27;Norfolk exile&#x27;. Written in his characteristic dead-pan style, &quot;Prewd and Prejudice&quot; concerns itself with the Norfolk countryside, misconceptions about Norfolk and its self-deprecating folk. Sugden wrote that &quot;the national papers seemed to think that it took the mickey out of country people, while the Norfolk people thought it ridiculed Londoners&quot;.

Sugden is also the author of &quot;The Cromer-Sheringham Crab Wars&quot; and the song &quot;Like a Rhinestone Ploughboy&quot;. He is the compiler of an (as yet) unpublished rhyming dictionary of Norfolk place-names for song-writing purposes. In 1996 he published &quot;The Ballad of Sid Kipper&quot;.

The &quot;Eastern Daily Press&quot; columnist Keith Skipper claimed that Sugden is &quot;probably the county’s finest ambassador who captures the true spirit of Norfolk, teaches it tricks, then sends it to run riot across the land&quot;.

In 2006, Sugden presented a series of podcasts for Channel 4 radio called &quot;The Kipper Country Code&quot;, as Sid Kipper.

His website no longer exists, but is available via web archive.

On 4 April 2024, friends and family confirmed on social media that he had passed away the previous evening.

<doc id="342166" wikidata="Q243116" url="?curid=342166" title="Nettuno">
<text>Nettuno is a town and &quot;comune&quot; of the Metropolitan City of Rome in the Lazio region of central Italy, south of Rome. A resort city and agricultural center on the Tyrrhenian Sea, it has a population of approximately 50,000.
== Economy ==

It has a touristic harbour hosting about 860 boats and a shopping centre, selling everything for fishing and sailing. There is also a yacht club.

Nettuno is the city of the D.O.C. wine Cacchione.

Nettuno has a large base for the Italian Force, whose territory extends to the Province of Latina, and an Italian Police School, where especially police dogs are trained.

Nettuno is one stop south of Anzio on the local train from Rome and also the last stop of the FL8 line.

== History ==
According to a theory, the town would be a direct survival of the Roman Antium, the territory of which almost entirely corresponded to Nettuno and modern Anzio. Giuseppe Tomassetti considered Nettuno the real heir and continuation of the ancient Antiates. In contrast, Beatrice Cacciotti doubted an ancient origin of the town, and postulated a medieval origin. 

Nettuno was probably the location of the ancient Volscian port town of Caenon, which was the closest port of the town Antium (which did not have a natural harbour of its own). According to a more recent theory, the town Caenon would be located on a hill more east to Nettuno, and the port (similarly to the old theory above), would have been over the mouth of the river Loricina. In 469 BC, the town Caenon was destroyed by the Roman consul Titus Numicius Priscus.

A medieval castle, the &quot;castrum Neptuni&quot;, now known as the Borgo Medievale, most likely arose in the 10th or 11th century. According to local tradition, the name &quot;Neptunus&quot; would derive from a temple to the Roman god Neptune - the symbol of the town - but it has been hypothesized a derivation from the marshes already present in the area in the late ancient era, or from a raptor night bird, the &quot;noctunus&quot;.

Nettuno, which territory practically coincided with that of the Roman Antium, in the Middle Ages had an agricultural evolution. Since 1420 it was a fief of the Colonna family, then in the early 16th century passed to the Borgia nobles, later returned under the control of the Colonna, which kept it until 1594, when passed to the Church. In the 15th and 16th centuries Nettuno was among the major coastal fortified centers in Lazio, of which was considered the important breadbasket: to support the walled and turreted Borgo Medievale, between 1501 and 1503 in the Borgia&#x27;s period, the Forte Sangallo was built by Renaissance architect Antonio da Sangallo the Elder, as it was essential to defend the town against attacks from the sea. 
In 1582 the poet Antonio Ongaro was in Nettuno hosted by the Colonna, and there for the first time he recited his fisherman’s tale entitled &quot;Alceo&quot;.

In 1903 the writer Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio was a guest in the town with the actress Eleonora Duse, and wrote the opera &quot;La figlia di Iorio&quot;.

The scholar Luigi Pirandello wrote a novel, &quot;Va bene&quot;, set in Nettuno in 1904.

In 1925 the &quot;Convenzione di Nettuno&quot;, between Italy and Jugoslavia, was signed in the town to regulate the conditions of the Italian citizens in Dalmatia.

From 1940 to 1945, Nettuno and nearby Anzio were a single municipality (&quot;comune&quot;) called Nettunia.

On January 22, 1944, Anzio and Nettuno were the theatre of an Allied forces landing and the ensuing Battle of Anzio, which began with Operation Shingle during the Second World War. American forces (5th Army) were surrounded by Germans in the caves of Pozzoli in February 1944 for a week, suffering heavy casualties.

== Main sights ==
Nettuno is a popular tourist destination. Sights include a well-preserved old quarter, the Borgo Medievale, with medieval streets and small squares, and the Forte Sangallo mentioned above.

Nettuno is also a centre of pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Maria Goretti, in which a crypt houses the mortal remains of the saint. The church keeps also a valuable polychromed wooden statue of Our Lady of Grace, which is honoured by the town with a procession every year on the first Saturday of May. It was originally Our Lady of Ipswich, although it left England after the Reformation.

The privately-owned Villa Costaguti-Borghese at Nettuno was built in 1648, has gardens in a landscape park designed about 1840, now protected as a nature reserve. The &quot;Borghese Gladiator&quot; was discovered at Nettuno.

At the north edge of town is the Sicily-Rome American Cemetery and Memorial, where over 7,800 US soldiers are buried.

Near the eastern border of Nettuno there is Torre Astura: a fortified coastal tower of medieval origin, which overlooks a point of land; it is built over the ruins of a Roman villa with a fish pond. The area its a pleasant coastal place, also frequented by Cicero.

== Sport ==
Nettuno Baseball Club is one of the most important Italian baseball teams, often the winner of the national championship. Baseball was taught to the local people by American soldiers after their landing in World War II.

<text>Belvide Reservoir is a reservoir in South Staffordshire, England. It was built in 1833 to supply the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal, and has been managed as a nature reserve since 1977. It has been used to study the effect of water level changes on bird populations.

==Details==
Owned by the Canal &amp; River Trust, the reservoir was constructed around 1833 to feed the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal, which became part of the Shropshire Union Canal in 1846. Work began on it in 1832, and the canal opened in early 1835. Traffic levels were high, and the company had to buy 2,000 lockfulls of water in the first year, for which they paid £800 to the Wyrley and Essington Canal. In 1836, there was still pressure on the water supply, and the engineer William Cubitt was instructed to enlarge the reservoir in May. In order to finance the improvements, the Commissioners agreed that they would not be paid until £20,000 had been spent on the improvements. The enlarged reservoir was completed in 1842. The valve gear which controls the flow of water from the reservoir to the canal is believed to be original. It is housed in a circular gear house which stands in front of a concave brick retaining wall. Both were designed by Thomas Telford, and are Grade II* listed structures. The structure has a cast iron dome, and is a rare example of an original valve house. The reservoir covers an area of when water levels are at their highest, but levels fluctuate as water is used for the canal, and the surface area is around half of this figure when the water level is lower. The reservoir is fed by a tributary of the River Penk.

It is the site of a nature reserve, which has been operated by the West Midland Bird Club since January 1977, and is designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). The reserve is not open to the general public, and a permit is required to visit it.

The site has attracted interest from bird-watchers since the 1920s, when the ornithologist Arnold Boyd began visiting it and publishing reports in the magazine &quot;British Birds&quot;, although he did not reveal its location, as he called it &quot;Bellfields&quot; in the articles. The reservoir has been visited by many scarce and rare migrant birds, including white-winged black tern (1970, 1974, 1992, 1999), whiskered tern (1969), Caspian tern (1968, 1992), spotted crake and spotted sandpiper (1982).

Studies of the effects of changes in the water level at the reservoir have resulted in the publishing of an ideal regime for such draw-downs to maximise the benefits to wildlife. As with many such studies, there are conflicting interests, since moulting ducks such as pochard, shoveller and tufted duck thrive in summers when the levels do not fluctuate much, whereas the larger draw-downs create better conditions for wading birds. The shallows are rejuvenated when a large draw-down occurs, and dabbling ducks such as teal are most numerous as the reservoir refills, while the population of diving ducks is at its largest a year after such a draw-down has occurred.

The reservoir is located immediately to the south of the A5 road, which follows the course of the Roman Watling Street at this point. The canal is a little to the east, and crosses the road at Stretton Aqueduct. Surplus water from the reservoir flows under the canal to reach the River Penk, a little further to the east. The nearest village is Brewood, about to the south-east.

<doc id="342173" wikidata="Q257501" url="?curid=342173" title="Sabra liqueur">
<text>Sabra liqueur is a chocolate-orange flavored liqueur produced in Israel.

The primary flavor of Sabra is a rich, bittersweet chocolate. The dense chocolate is cut by the sweet and sour taste of Jaffa oranges. Slightly chilling Sabra liqueur strengthens the chocolate taste, while slightly warming it brings out the citrus taste. Sabra is 30% alcohol by volume.

The Sabra bottle design is based on a 2,000-year-old Phoenician wine flask found in a Tel Aviv museum.

Sabra was developed and introduced in 1963 by Edgar Bronfman, Sr., the head of Seagram, to be an identifiably Israeli liqueur. Its name is a term used affectionately to describe a native-born Israeli Jew, a term derived from the Hebrew name of a prickly pear cactus that grows in Israel. The original liqueur was made from this cactus fruit, but did not succeed and was quickly changed to the successful chocolate-orange product.

There are now two Sabra liqueurs, all produced by Binyamina Winery, and all are kosher and kosher for Passover. The newer products are Sabra Coffee liqueur, launched in 1985, and Grand Sabra, an orange-flavored brandy, launched in 2006.

The product is still produced at Binyamina wines and is available under this name by other manufacturers.

<text>Blithfield Reservoir is a large raw water reservoir in Staffordshire, England, owned by South Staffordshire Water.

Some 800 acres (324 hectares) of reservoir was formed on land sold by Baron Bagot to the South Staffordshire Water Works (SSWW) in the 1940s. Blithfield Reservoir was opened by Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother on Tuesday 27 October 1953.
 The Reservoir is located just north-east of the town of Rugeley and just south of Abbots Bromley
The reservoir is a haven for wildlife, particularly birds, a fact that was recognised in 1988 when the reservoir and most of its surrounding woodland was designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest, (SSSI). Parts of the shoreline and surrounding woodland are only available to birdwatchers under a permit scheme, operated by the West Midland Bird Club, but much of the open water is visible from the road causeway which crosses the reservoir (grid reference SK055235), and there is access to the dam end of the reservoir. There is also an education centre to facilitate visits by school parties.

Blithfield was once a &quot;members only&quot; fly fishing destination, but, in recent years, it has been opened up to day ticket holders. Day tickets are available from the Estate Office.

Blithfield reservoir walks give members of the public the chance to enjoy the area and its wildlife. The reservoir has been visited by many scarce and rare migrant birds, including an inland Arctic warbler (1993), Bonaparte&#x27;s gull (1994 and 1996), blue-winged teal (1996 and 2000) and squacco heron (2004).

<text>&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Arzawa was a region and political entity in Western Anatolia during the Late Bronze Age. In Hittite texts, the term is used to refer both to a particular kingdom and to a loose confederation of states. The chief Arzawan state, whose capital was at Apasa, is often referred to as &quot;Arzawa Minor&quot; or &quot;Arzawa Proper&quot;, while the other Arzawa lands included Mira, Hapalla, Wilusa, and the Seha River Land.

Arzawa is known from contemporary texts documenting its political and military relationships with Egypt and the Hittite Empire. The kingdom had a tumultuous relationship with the Hittites, sometimes allied with them but other times opposing them, in particular in concert with Mycenaean Greece which corresponds to Ahhiyawa of the Hittite sources. During the Amarna Period, Arzawa had achieved sufficient independence that Egypt opened direct diplomatic relations, addressing the Arzawan king Tarhuntaradu as &quot;great king&quot;, a title reserved for peers. However, the kingdom was fully subjugated by Mursili II around 1300 BC.

== Geography ==

The Kingdom of Arzawa was located in Western Anatolia. Its capital was a coastal city called Apasa, which is believed to have been Ayasuluk Hill at the site of later Ephesus. The hill appears to have been fortified during the Late Bronze Age and contemporary graves suggest that it was a locally important center, though much of the potential ruins are obscured by the later Basilica of St. John.

In Hittite texts, the term &quot;Arzawa&quot; is also used more broadly to refer to a group of kingdoms including Arzawa itself. Thus, modern-day scholars sometimes use the terms &quot;Arzawa Minor&quot; or &quot;Arzawa Proper&quot; to designate the main kingdom. The other &quot;Arzawa Lands&quot; included Mira, Hapalla, Seha, and in later periods Wilusa as well. At times, the Arzawa Lands appear to have banded together as a loose military confederation, which may have been led by the Kingdom of Arzawa itself. However, they were never fully united as a single kingdom, and did not always operate in solidarity with one another.

== History ==

The zenith of the kingdom was during the 15th and 14th centuries BC. The Hittites were then weakened, and Arzawa was an ally of Egypt.

=== Early history ===

Around 1650 BC, the Hittite old kingdom ruler Hattusili I raided Arzawan territory. Documents regarding this incident provide the earliest known mention of Arzawa, which in this era was spelled as &quot;Arzawiya&quot;. Around 1550 BC, the Arzawans joined a broader uprising against the Hittite king Ammuna. However, they were subjugated by Tudhaliya I/II around 1400 BC, concurrently with the Assuwa Revolt.

A Hittite text known as the &quot;Indictment of Madduwatta&quot; discusses the exploits of an Anatolian warlord named Madduwatta in and around Arzawa during Tudhaliya&#x27;s reign. The document recounts that Madduwatta launched multiple unsuccessful attacks on Arzawa before seeking a marriage alliance with the Arzawan king Kupanta-Kurunta. Maduwatta then allied with a certain Attarsiya, the man of Ahhiyawa; the latter country being widely accepted as Mycenaean Greece or part of it. In general during the period 1400-1190 BC Hittite records mention that the populations of Arzawa and Ahhiyawa were in close contact.

=== Zenith ===

Around 1370 BC, during the reign of Tudhaliya III, Arzawa conquered a large portion of Western Anatolia. Their army swept across the &quot;Lower Land&quot;, into territories that the Hittites had never lost before, reaching as far as the border as the Hittite homeland.

In response, the Egyptian pharaoh Amenhotep III opened diplomatic relations with the Arzawan king Tarhundaradu, proposing a marriage alliance. In his letter, the pharaoh refers to the Hittite Empire as paralyzed, suggesting that he expected Arzawa to replace it as the major regional power. This correspondence had to be carried out in Hittite, since the Arzawan court did not have scribes capable of writing Akkadian, the contemporary lingua franca for international diplomacy.

Arzawa never achieved political or military supremacy over Anatolia. The territory they had seized was soon recaptured by the Hittite prince Šuppiluliuma I. After coming to the throne around 1350 BC, Šuppiluliuma continued to campaign against Arzawa, even installing pro-Hittite rulers in former Arzawan vassal states such as Mira.

=== Revolt and fragmentation ===

The Arzawa lands were fully subjugated by the Hittites around 1300 BC, after an unsuccessful rebellion. When Mursili II ascended to the Hittite throne, much of Anatolia erupted into rebellion. At this time, Uhha-Ziti ruled Arzawa Minor, the epicenter of the broader Arzawa confederation. Uhha-Ziti provoked the new Hittite king by providing sanctuary to anti-Hittite rebels and refusing to extradite them. In doing so, he was supported by Manapa-Tarhunta of the Arzawan Seha River Land as well as by the king of Ahhiyawa. However, he was also opposed by King Mashuiluwa of Mira, one of the other Arzawan kingdoms.

The Hittites responded with full military force. The &quot;Annals of Mursili&quot; claim that Uhha-Ziti was incapacitated after being struck by lightning and that his capital city of Apasa fell after a short siege. Uhha-Ziti and his family fled to Ahhiyawa (Mycenaean)-controlled islands in the Aegean, while local populations faced further sieges and deportations. Uhha-Zitti died shortly afterwards in exile, and his son Tapalazunawali failed to regain control of the kingdom. As for the deportees around 6,200 of them comprised the royal share who ended up serving the Hittite king.

In the aftermath of the Arzawa defeat the nearby settlement of Miletus (Millawanda in Hittite records) 
was affected and probably burnt by the Hittites due to previous Mycenaean involvement in support of the Arzawan side. Nevertheless Mycenaeans retained control of Miletus.

Hittite records also mention Piyama-Radu a local warlord who was active in Arzawa and fled to Mycenaean controlled territory that time. It is not clear if the Arzawan pockets of resistance were overcome by Hittite forces.

== Society ==

The Arzawa Lands were unusual in Western Anatolia for having a state-level society, being ruled by kings who conducted formal relations with one another and with foreign powers. By contrast, other nearby groups such as the Lukka, Karkiya, and Masa, were stateless societies ruled by councils of elders, and thus had more informal relations with outsiders.

The languages spoken in Arzawa cannot be directly determined due to the paucity of written sources. The primary languages are believed to have been from the Anatolian family, and in particular from the Luwic subgroup. Some scholars such as Ilya Yakubovich argue that Arzawa was predominantly inhabited by speakers of Proto-Lydian and Proto-Carian. Others such as Trevor Bryce regard it as Luwian-speaking.

In its final century of independence, Arzawan culture was influenced by the culture of Mycenaean Greece, which was beginning to expand into Western Anatolia. For instance, Mycenaean-style pottery and architecture are both evidenced at Apasa, which may have even had a Mycenaean cult center at the site of the later Temple of Artemis.

== Amarna letters ==

The Amarna letters include a pair of letters between the Arzawan ruler Tarhundaradu and the Egyptian Pharaoh Amenhotep III. One letter, known to modern scholars as EA 31, was sent from the pharaoh to Arzawa; the other, known as EA 32, contains the Arzawan king&#x27;s reply. While most of the Amarna letters were written in the Akkadian language, these letters were written in Hittite. The Egyptian letter EA 31 was written by a scribe not fully proficient in Hittite, and contains significant grammatical errors.

When these letters were excavated in the 1880s, they were the first Hittite texts to be discovered. Because they were written in the already-deciphered Sumero-Akkadian cuneiform script, scholars were able to pronounce the words, and could often make inferences about their meanings based on the letters&#x27; formulaic rhetorical style and use of sumerograms. Based on these inferences, the scholar Jorgen A. Knudtzon proposed that the language was from the Indo-European family. This hypothesis proved correct after thousands more tablets were discovered at Hattusa.

The letters have also proved relevant in debates about Arzawan geography. While the general consensus suggests that Arzawa&#x27;s capital was at Ephesos, chemical analyses suggest that EA 32 was written on clay from far to the north, near Kyme in the region later known as the Aeolis.

<text>George Lynch (born September 28, 1954) is an American guitarist, best known for his work with the hard rock band Dokken and his post-Dokken solo band Lynch Mob. He is regarded as one of the most renowned and influential rock guitarists of the 1980s, noted for his distinctive playing style and sound.

He is ranked No. 47 on the list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot; by &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine and No. 10 on the &quot;Top 10 Metal Guitarists of All Time&quot; by Gibson.

==Early life==
Lynch was born in Spokane, Washington, and made the small town of Auburn, California his home base between 1971 and 1975.

== Career ==
=== 1970s ===
Lynch auditioned twice for the role of lead guitarist for Ozzy Osbourne — first in 1979, ultimately losing the position to Randy Rhoads. Lynch commented, &quot;I won the consolation prize. Randy got to tour with Ozzy...and I got to teach at his mom&#x27;s school.&quot; He auditioned again in 1982 to replace Brad Gillis. According to Lynch, he was initially hired for three days before Osbourne changed his mind, deciding to go with Jake E. Lee. Lee mentioned that Lynch &quot;got the gig, but only went on the road for two weeks to watch the show and never actually played with Ozzy.&quot; Lynch later explained that he participated in soundchecks at the side of the stage during a European tour with Osbourne and Brad Gillis as part of an extended audition. He also rehearsed with the band in Texas but was dismissed by Osbourne when the band moved its operations to Los Angeles. Jake E. Lee auditioned on the day of Lynch&#x27;s dismissal, and while Lee reportedly didn’t perform his best, his appearance was preferred, securing him the position. Osbourne dismissed Lynch on the spot in front of Lee, whom Lynch had just met. This decision deeply affected Lynch, who was struggling financially at the time and working as a liquor store delivery driver, a job that required him to keep his hair short. Sharon Osbourne favored Lee’s &quot;look&quot; over Lynch’s playing, a preference that likely influenced Osbourne&#x27;s decision.

During the late 1970s, Lynch played with a band called The Boyz, performing on Hollywood’s Sunset Strip alongside Van Halen and Quiet Riot. The Boyz also included future Dokken drummer Mick Brown, bassist Monte Zufelt, and vocalists Lisa Furspanker and Greg Sanford. Their sound, along with Lynch’s playing, resembled Van Halen’s so closely that one of their demos circulated as a purported &quot;pre-Roth Van Halen recording&quot;. The Boyz were scheduled to perform a showcase for Gene Simmons and his startup label, but Van Halen opened the show, prompting Simmons to leave before seeing The Boyz. Lynch subsequently formed Xciter before eventually joining Dokken.

=== Dokken and Lynch Mob ===
Dokken released a series of successful platinum albums that prominently featured Lynch&#x27;s innovative lead guitar work. The instrumental track &quot;Mr. Scary&quot; on &quot;Back for the Attack&quot; increased his popularity among guitarists. The band received a Grammy nomination for Best Metal Performance in 1990.

The group disbanded in March 1989 due to internal conflicts with lead vocalist Don Dokken. Lynch then formed his own hard rock band, Lynch Mob, which differed from Dokken in lyrical and guitar complexity, subject matter, song structure, and tuning. Lynch took a break when his wife, Christy Lynch, gave birth to their daughter, Mariah Lynch.

Lynch released his first solo album, &quot;Sacred Groove,&quot; in 1993.

In 1994, after Don Dokken, Jeff Pilson, and Mick Brown reunited, they decided to bring Lynch back for a full Dokken reunion. The reformed band signed with Columbia/Sony and, following extensive writing sessions, released &quot;Dysfunctional&quot;. The album, however, did not meet expectations, leading to the band being dropped from the label. Dokken subsequently signed with CMC International and released &quot;One Live Night&quot;, an &quot;unplugged&quot; show recorded in late 1994.

In 1996, the band entered the studio with producer Kelly Gray, who aimed to take Dokken in a new direction. The resulting album, &quot;Shadowlife&quot;, marked a shift from their melodic rock roots to a more alternative sound, a change that disappointed vocalist and founder Don Dokken.

Tensions reignited between Don Dokken and Lynch in 1997, resulting in Lynch&#x27;s replacement by former Europe guitarist John Norum. Lynch subsequently reformed Lynch Mob, which recorded and demoed three songs later released as an EP titled &quot;Syzygy&quot;. However, vocalist Logan opted to pursue other projects before a full album could be completed, and Mick Brown chose to remain with Dokken. In 1998, Lynch organized a brief 13-show U.S. tour for Lynch Mob, with Artension frontman John West, bassist Anthony Esposito, and others.

When that lineup disbanded, Lynch chose to take Lynch Mob in a new direction. The band adopted a fresh look, lineup, and musical style that appealed to a younger audience. They released the album &quot;Smoke This&quot; in 1999. After the supporting tour, Lynch decided to put Lynch Mob on hold for a few years, though he toured in late 2001 with the band’s original singer Oni Logan, L.A. Guns bassist Chuck Garric, and BulletBoys drummer Jimmy D&#x27;Anda.

===Post-2001 projects=== 
Lynch began collaborating with producer/engineer Sean Fodor on the ill-fated Microdot project, which featured then-unknown vocalist London LeGrand in early 2002. Only a few songs from that project have been released: &quot;Bulldog Tyranny&quot; on &quot;The Lost Anthology&quot; and three other songs that Lynch later released as &quot;The Lynch That Stole Riffness&quot;, with Robert Mason taking over on vocals.

Lynch reformed Lynch Mob in late 2002, featuring original bassist Anthony Esposito and Robert Mason. Lynch Mob recorded an album of re-recorded classic Lynch songs from Dokken and Lynch Mob, updated to a more contemporary (post-2000) approach and sound.

Lynch formed a project with former Dokken bassist Jeff Pilson, releasing the &quot;Wicked Underground&quot; album in 2003 under the name Lynch/Pilson. That same year, Lynch assembled The George Lynch Group, with which he has continued to record and tour regularly. The George Lynch Group performed a marathon of 26 shows in 30 days, including a much-talked-about feature on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; with Jay Leno. This line-up featured Lynch, vocalist Andrew Freeman, drummer Vinny Appice (Black Sabbath, Dio), and Mårten Andersson (Lizzy Borden, Starwood, Legacy). The 2005 album &quot;Furious George&quot; is a cover album, featuring classic rock tunes from ZZ Top, Jimi Hendrix, The Beatles, AC/DC, and Led Zeppelin.

&quot;Let the Truth Be Known&quot; was released under the band name Souls of We in 2008 and features the line-up of London LeGrand (vocals), Johnny Chow (bass), and Yael (drums), along with a myriad of guest contributions.

Lynch embarked on a tour in early fall 2008 with a reformed Lynch Mob, featuring original singer Oni Logan, bassist Marco Mendoza, and drummer Scot Coogan. A new Lynch Mob album, titled &quot;Smoke and Mirrors&quot;, was released in October 2009, with Logan handling lead vocals.

In 2009, Lynch recorded lead and rhythm guitar tracks for seven songs that appear on the debut album of rock singer Raven Quinn. The self-published album was released on March 4, 2010.

Lynch toured in the spring of 2010 with Souls of We and spent the summer and winter touring with Lynch Mob. In the summer of 2010, Souls of We changed their line-up and were forced to discontinue using the name.

Lynch appeared on the tribute album &quot;Siam Shade Tribute&quot; for the Japanese rock band Siam Shade in 2010.

Lynch currently resides near Los Angeles, where he created an instructional guitar website, The Guitar Dojo.

Lynch produces his own custom hand-built art guitars, marketed under the Mr. Scary Guitars brand, which he crafts himself at the ESP Guitars USA custom shop facility.

===Second Dokken reunion and T&amp;N=== 
George Lynch and Jeff Pilson joined Mick Brown and Don Dokken for two songs during an encore at a Dokken show at The House of Blues in Anaheim on November 29, 2009. Lynch subsequently announced a reunion of Dokken&#x27;s &quot;glory days&quot; line-up, but the announcement was retracted on February 24. Lynch released a statement on his website claiming that Don did not want the reunion to occur.

T&amp;N was formed from three-fourths of the classic Dokken line-up: Lynch, Jeff Pilson, and Mick Brown. They announced plans for a studio album to be released in 2012. The trio&#x27;s original name was Tooth &amp; Nail, but it was shortened to T&amp;N in March 2012. The band released the album Slave to the Empire on October 31, 2012.

===Recent activities=== 
Lynch announced plans for a documentary film titled &quot;Shadowtrain: Under A Crooked Sky&quot; about the destruction of the Native American community in the fall of 2011. A crowdfunding campaign was launched in March 2013 to complete the project. The movie was still a work in progress as of late 2014.

Lynch assembled Shadowtrain, featuring documentary filmmaker and drummer Vincent Nicastro, Pueblo Native American vocalist Gregg Analla (Tribe of Gypsies, Slaviour, Seventhsign), ex-Lynch Mob bassist Gabe Rosales, and keyboardist Donnie Dickman.

Lynch&#x27;s all-star project with vocalist/bassist Doug Pinnick and drummer Ray Luzier, known as KXM, released its debut album in 2014.

Lynch announced another project titled The Infidels, featuring Pancho Tomaselli, Sal Rodriguez, and rapper Sen Dog.

Lynch completed an album with Stryper frontman Michael Sweet, titled &quot;Only to Rise&quot;, which was released on January 27, 2015, on Frontiers Records under the name Sweet &amp; Lynch. The recording lineup features James Lomenzo and Brian Tichy on bass and drums. The duo released a second album, &quot;Unified&quot;, on November 10, 2017.

Lynch teamed up with Living Colour vocalist Corey Glover to form the side project Ultraphonix, releasing the album &quot;Original Human Music&quot; in 2018.

In 2019, Lynch reunited with former Dokken bassist Jeff Pilson in the band The End Machine. The band released their self-titled debut in 2019 and their second album, &quot;The End Machine: Phase 2&quot;, in 2021. According to a 2021 interview with Pariah Burke, the band represents an intentional return to Lynch&#x27;s classic sound. In 2020, the album &quot;Dirty Shirley&quot; was released, preceded by two singles.

In 2023, Lynch released a side project called The Banishment, a collaboration between George Lynch, programmer and multi-instrumentalist Joe Haze, and vocalist Devix Szell. On March 10, The Banishment released their debut album, Machine And Bone. The album features a duet titled &quot;Max Pain&quot; with Szell and Richard Patrick of FILTER, &quot;The Dread&quot; by Jason Charles Miller, and the song &quot;Terror&quot; by Tommy Victor from PRONG. To promote the project, The Banishment recorded an official music video for one of the tracks titled &quot;Got What You Wanted.&quot; The video was directed by Devix Szell and produced by Sabrina Oertle.

==Equipment== 
Lynch used Charvel and Kramer guitars prior to 1986, most notably their tiger stripe guitars. He has endorsed ESP Guitars since then. His unique &quot;Skull and Bones&quot; guitar (affectionately named &quot;Mom&quot;) was designed and hand-crafted by artist John &#x27;J. Frog&#x27; Garcia. Since George was contracted by ESP at the time, an ESP decal was applied to the headstock. Several George Lynch signature guitars have been produced by ESP Japan:

* The ESP Kamikaze model, based on his first ESP guitar
* The Tiger model, a homemade Strat constructed from a stock of parts George bought from Charvel in the 1980s
* The Skull &amp; Snakes, a design later used for the Lynch Mob &quot;Wicked Sensation&quot; album artwork
* The Flame Boy, based on an ESP Forest design
* The New Super V, which includes distressed hardware and features a new &quot;Super V&quot; pickup
* The Ultra Tone, the first ESP guitar that George designed himself
* The Serpent, an ESP model released and used in the 1990s

Lynch briefly endorsed PRS Guitars in the early 1990s. He can be seen using two different colored Custom 24 models. He also endorsed the hand-crafted Yamaha L-Series acoustic guitars and used these on the Asian &#x27;Unplugged&#x27; clinic tour in May/June 2006.

Lynch is currently signed with ESP Guitars, which has resulted in the creation of the Lynch Jumbo acoustic, featuring graphics designed by Stephen Jensen.

Lynch&#x27;s use of Marshall, Soldano, Bogner, and Diezel amps, along with effects units to achieve his famous tone, is well documented in rock guitar circles. His rig changes with each successive tour. Lynch used the Randall Dragon (non-master volume) tube head for the majority of his sound while on tour in 2005. The design was similar to the older Marshall Plexi heads he used early in the Dokken era.

Lynch is a long-time endorser of Randall Amplification and participated in the design of the George Lynch Box for Randall&#x27;s modular amp system.

Seymour Duncan created the Screamin&#x27; Demon guitar pickup (SH-12 and TB-12) for Lynch, which is featured on all the ESP Lynch signature guitars. Seymour Duncan also recently designed the new Super V pickup to be featured in the Super V model.

Lynch also uses a Morley A/B box called the Tripler and a limited edition Robert Keeley GL Time Machine boost.

Zoom released the G2g George Lynch pedal in 2008.

Lynch designed a new high-nickel content string through the Dean Markley company with his name on the packaging. He later switched over to D&#x27;Addario strings.

== Influences == 
Lynch cited several influential guitarists as key inspirations in his musical development, including Jimi Hendrix, Randy Rhoads, Jeff Beck, and Michael Schenker. He also acknowledges the impact of Eddie Van Halen, Allan Holdsworth, Jan Akkerman, Christopher Parkening, Al Di Meola, Roy Buchanan, Albert King, Frank Marino, Muddy Waters, Gary Moore, and Yngwie Malmsteen. These artists have shaped his approach to guitar playing and songwriting throughout his career.

<doc id="342190" wikidata="Q4601865" url="?curid=342190" title="2003 Staten Island Ferry crash">
<text>On October 15, 2003, at 3:21 p.m. EDT, the Staten Island Ferry vessel &quot;Andrew J. Barberi&quot; crashed full-speed into a concrete maintenance pier at the St. George Terminal in Upper New York Bay. Eleven people were killed and 70 injured, some critically. Pilot Richard J. Smith and New York City ferry director Patrick Ryan pleaded guilty and were jailed for seaman&#x27;s manslaughter. Smith was piloting under impairment from painkillers, and Ryan failed to enforce the city rule requiring two pilots in the wheelhouse during docking.

==Crash==
The ferry was at the end of its , 25-minute trip from South Ferry, Manhattan to St. George, Staten Island. On board were approximately 1,500 passengers, one-quarter of the maximum capacity of 6,000. Winds were heavy that afternoon, with gusts of more than . The water in New York Harbor was described as &quot;very choppy&quot;.

Instead of docking, the ferry angled away from its berth and collided with a concrete maintenance pier. The pier ripped into the ferry&#x27;s starboard side and tore into the boat&#x27;s main deck where many passengers were crowding forward to disembark. The collision left a number of victims trapped in a pile of metal, glass, and splintered wood, while other passengers jumped overboard. The ferry&#x27;s hull on the Staten Island end sustained significant damage, including the destruction of bulkheads, support frames and support columns along the starboard side.

==Fatalities and injuries==

Ten people were killed, plus an eleventh person who died two months after the crash from injuries sustained during the collision, and 70 others were injured in the crash, including several who lost limbs. All the fatalities and most of the injuries were to passengers on the main deck; some passengers on the upper decks were injured during the crowd&#x27;s panic, and many were treated for shock. The deaths included a survivor of the September 11 attacks and a woman who was placed in a drug-induced coma for two months after the crash. Paul Esposito, a 24-year-old waiter, had both legs severed below the knee. His life was saved by Kerry Griffiths, a sightseeing 34-year-old pediatric nurse from England, who applied tourniquets.

==Aftermath==
The ferry&#x27;s pilot, Richard J. Smith, fled the scene and was found shortly afterwards at home. Smith had tried to kill himself by cutting his wrists and shooting himself in the chest twice with a pellet gun. He was taken to the same hospital where victims of the crash were being treated.

It was later determined that Smith had lost consciousness while at the ship&#x27;s controls. He had taken the painkillers tramadol and Tylenol PM, both of which can cause drowsiness, blurred vision and seizures, any or all of which may have contributed to the crash. The city rules required two pilots to be present during docking, but this rule had not been enforced by the management of the ferry service, and Smith was the only pilot in the wheelhouse at the time.

A total of five people were charged in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. Smith was charged with eleven counts of seaman&#x27;s manslaughter as well as making false statements in his medical report when applying to the U.S. Coast Guard for a renewal of his pilot&#x27;s license. His doctor, William Tursi, was charged for lying on the same report. The city&#x27;s ferry director, Patrick Ryan, was also charged with seaman&#x27;s manslaughter and making false statements arising from his failure to enforce the two-pilot rule. Michael J. Gansas, the ferry&#x27;s captain, was charged with lying to investigators. John Mauldin, the port captain, was charged with obstruction of justice and lying to investigators; he falsely claimed that information regarding the two-pilot rule had been distributed to employees.

On August 4, 2004, Smith pleaded guilty to seaman&#x27;s manslaughter. He was sentenced to 18 months in prison on January 10, 2006. New York&#x27;s former city ferry director, Patrick Ryan, who had also pleaded guilty to seaman&#x27;s manslaughter, was sentenced to a year and a day.

The crash resulted in 191 civil lawsuits against the City, leading to more than $90 million in settlements to victims and their families. Structural repairs cost $6.9 million for the boat and $1.4 million for the pier.

The crash was at first said by New York City to be an Act of God, with attorneys arguing that the Department of Transportation should not be held responsible for the crash, an argument that disturbed many survivors and New York City residents. City attorneys, citing a 19th-century maritime law, would later argue that the total amount of damages sought against the city should not exceed the $14.4 million value of the ferryboat. On February 26, 2007, U.S. District Judge Edward Korman rejected this argument and held that the city could not cap damages, writing: &quot;The city&#x27;s failure to provide a second pilot or otherwise adopt a reasonable practice that addresses the issue of pilot incapacitation was plainly a substantial factor in causing the disaster.&quot;

Despite these rulings and a similar, independent federal probation report by officer Tony Garoppolo into the culpability of the ferry service&#x27;s upper management, in which he viewed &quot;the lion&#x27;s share of culpability in this case as resting with the high level management of the Ferry Service&quot;, no other employees of the New York City Department of Transportation were prosecuted.

On May 8, 2010, the same boat was involved in another crash, due to a mechanical failure. The impact caused 37 injuries, one of which was serious.

<text>Candaules (died c.687 BC; , &quot;Kandaulēs&quot;), also known as Myrsilos (Μυρσίλος), was a king of the ancient Kingdom of Lydia in the early years of the 7th century BC. According to Herodotus, he succeeded his father Meles as the 22nd and last king of Lydia&#x27;s Heraclid dynasty. He was assassinated and succeeded by Gyges. 

Based on an ambiguous line in the work of the Greek poet Hipponax, it was traditionally assumed that the name &quot;Candaules&quot; meant &quot;hound-choker&quot; among the Lydians. J. B. Bury and Russell Meiggs (1975) say that Candaules is a Maeonian name meaning &quot;hound-choker&quot;. More recently, however, it has been suggested that the name or title &quot;Kandaules&quot; is cognate with the Luwian &quot;hantawatt(i)–&quot; (&quot;king&quot;) and probably has Carian origin. The name or title of Candaules is the origin of the term candaulism, a sexual practice which legend attributed to him.

Several stories of how the Heraclid dynasty of Candaules ended and the Mermnad dynasty of Gyges began have been related by different authors throughout history, mostly in a mythical vein. In Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot;, Gyges used a magical ring to become invisible and usurp the throne, a plot device which has reappeared in numerous myths and works of fiction throughout history. The earliest story, related by Herodotus in the 5th century BC, has Candaules betrayed and executed by his wife.

==Herodotus&#x27; tale of King Candaules, Gyges and the queen==

According to Herodotus in &quot;The Histories&quot;, Candaules believed his wife to be the most beautiful woman on Earth. Herodotus does not name the queen but later artists and writers have called her Nyssia. 

Candaules often told his favourite bodyguard, Gyges, how beautiful the queen was and, thinking Gyges did not believe him, urged Gyges to contrive to see her naked. Gyges initially refused as he did not wish to dishonor the queen. Nevertheless, Candaules was insistent and Gyges had no option but to obey his king. So Gyges hid in Candaules&#x27; bedroom and, when the queen entered, watched her undress. As she was getting into bed, he quietly left the room, but the queen saw him and realised what had happened. Herodotus commented: &quot;For with the Lydians, as with most barbarian (i.e., non-Greek) races, it is thought highly indecent even for a man to be seen naked&quot;. 

The queen silently swore revenge for her shame. Next day, she summoned Gyges to her chamber. Gyges thought it was a routine request, but she confronted him immediately and presented him with two choices. One was to kill Candaules and seize the throne with Nyssia as his wife. The second was to be executed immediately by her trusted servants. Gyges pleaded with her to relent but she would not. He decided to take the first course of action and assassinate the king. The plan was that he should hide in the royal bedroom as before but this time from the king. After Candaules fell asleep, Gyges crept forward and stabbed him to death.

Gyges married the queen as she had insisted but many Lydians did not at first accept him as their ruler. In order to prevent a civil war, Gyges offered to have his position confirmed or refused by the Delphic Oracle. He agreed that he would restore the throne to the Heracleidae if the Oracle declared against him. The Oracle supported him and his dynasty was established. The Priestess of the Shrine did add, however, that the Heraclids would have their revenge on Gyges in the fifth generation of the Mermnadae.

===Modern view of the story===
The story is rejected by Bury and Meiggs, who assert that the family of Candaules, although descended from Heracles himself, had become degenerate. As a result, Candaules was assassinated 687 BC by Gyges, who ushered in a new era for Lydia ruled by his own Mermnadae clan.

Herodotus&#x27; version is included in Michael Ondaatje&#x27;s 1992 novel &quot;The English Patient&quot;. The story also figures prominently in Anthony Powell&#x27;s 1973 novel &quot;Temporary Kings&quot;, the eleventh volume in the series &quot;A Dance to the Music of Time&quot;, in which characters discuss a fictitious portrayal of Candaules and Gyges by Tiepolo.

Alexander von Zemlinsky&#x27;s opera &quot;Der König Kandaules&quot; is based on the play &quot;Le roi Candaule&quot; by André Gide.

<text>Gallia Aquitania (, ), also known as [[Aquitaine]] or Aquitaine Gaul, was a province of the Roman Empire. It lies in present-day southwest France and the comarca of Val d&#x27;Aran in northeast Spain, where it gives its name to the modern region of Aquitaine. It was bordered by the provinces of Gallia Lugdunensis, Gallia Narbonensis, and Hispania Tarraconensis.

==Tribes of Aquitania==
Fourteen Celtic tribes and over twenty Aquitanian tribes occupied the area from the northern slopes of the Pyrenees in the south to the &quot;Liger&quot; (Loire) river in the north. The major tribes are listed at the end of this section. There were more than twenty tribes of Aquitani, but they were small and lacking in repute; the majority of the tribes lived along the ocean, while the others reached up into the interior and to the summits of the Cemmenus Mountains, as far as the Tectosages.

The name &quot;Gallia Comata&quot; was often used to designate the three provinces of Farther Gaul, viz. Gallia Lugdunensis, Gallia Belgica, and Aquitania, literally meaning &quot;long-haired Gaul&quot;, as opposed to &quot;Gallia Bracata&quot; &quot;trousered Gaul&quot;, a term derived from &quot;bracae&quot; (&quot;breeches&quot;, the native costume of the northern &quot;barbarians&quot;) for Gallia Narbonensis.

Most of the Atlantic coast of the Aquitani was sandy and thin-soiled; it grew millet, but was unproductive with respect to other products. Along this coast was also the gulf held by the Tarbelli; in their land, gold mines were abundant. Large quantities of gold could be mined with a minimum of refinement. The interior and mountainous country in this region had better soil. The Petrocorii and the Bituriges Cubi had fine ironworks; the Cadurci had linen factories; the Ruteni and the Gabales had silver mines.

According to Strabo, the Aquitani were a wealthy people. Luerius, the King of the Arverni and the father of Bituitus who warred against Maximus Aemilianus and Dometius, is said to have been so exceptionally rich and extravagant that he once rode on a carriage through a plain, scattering gold and silver coins here and there.

The Romans called the tribal groups &quot;pagi&quot;. These were organized into larger super-tribal groups that the Romans called &quot;civitates&quot;. These administrative groupings were later taken over by the Romans in their system of local control.

Aquitania was inhabited by the following tribes: Ambilatri, Anagnutes, Arverni, Ausci, Basabocates, Belendi, Bercorates, Bergerri, Bituriges Cubi, Bituriges Vivisci, Cadurci, Cambolectri Agesinates, Camponi, Convenae, Cocossati, Consoranni, Elusates, Gabali, Lassunni / Sassumini, Latusates / Tarusates, Lemovices, Monesi, Nitiobroges / Antobroges, Onobrisates, Oscidates montani, Oscidiates campestres, Petrocorii, Pictones, Pindedunni / Pinpedunni, Ruteni, Santones, Sediboniates, Sennates, Sibyllates, Sottiates, Succasses, Tarbelli, Tornates / Toruates, Vassei, Vellates, Vellavi, Venami.

==Gallia Aquitania and Rome==
Gaul as a nation was not a natural unit (Caesar differentiated between proper Gauls (Celtae), Belgae and Aquitani). In order to protect the route to Spain, Rome helped Massalia (Marseille) against bordering tribes. Following this intervention, the Romans conquered what they called &quot;Provincia&quot;, or the &quot;Province&quot; in 121 BC. &quot;Provincia&quot; extended from the Mediterranean to Lake Geneva, and was later known as Narbonensis with its capital at Narbo. Some of the region is now a part of modern Provence, named after the Roman district.

The main struggle against the Romans occurred from 58 to 50 BC when Vercingetorix fought against Julius Caesar at the Battle of Gergovia (a city of the Arverni) and at the Battle of Alesia (a city of the Mandubii). Vercingetorix was captured at the siege of Alesia after which the war ended. Caesar seized the remainder of Gaul, justifying his conquest by playing on Roman memories of savage attacks over the Alps by Celts and Germans. Roman policy henceforth called for Italy to be defended by guarding the distant Rhine River.

Caesar named Aquitania the triangle shaped territory between the Ocean, the Pyrenees and the Garonne river. He fought and almost completely subdued them in 56 BC after Publius Crassus&#x27;s military exploits assisted by Celtic allies. New rebellions ensued anyway up to 28–27 BC, with Agrippa gaining a great victory over the Gauls of Aquitania in 38 BC. It was the smallest region of all three mentioned above. A land extension stretching to the Loire River was added by Augustus, following the census conducted in 27 BC, based on Agrippa&#x27;s observations of language, race and community according to some sources. At that point, Aquitania became an imperial province and it, along with Narbonensis, Lugdunensis and Belgica, made up Gallia. Aquitania lay under the command of a former Praetor, and hosted no legions.

More so than Caesar, Strabo insists that the primeval Aquitani differ from the other Gauls not just in language, institutions and laws (&quot;lingua institutis legibusque discrepantes&quot;) but in body make-up too, deeming them closer to the Iberians. The administrative boundaries set up by Augustus comprising both proper Celtic tribes and primeval Aquitani remained unaltered until Diocletian&#x27;s new administrative reorganization (see below).

The Arverni often warred against the Romans with as many as two to four hundred thousand men. Two hundred thousand fought against Quintus Fabius Maximus Allobrogicus and against Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus. The Arverni not only had extended their empire as far as Narbo and the boundaries of Massiliotis, but they were also masters of the tribes as far as the Pyrenees, and as far as the ocean and the &quot;Rhenus&quot; (Rhine).
==Late Roman Empire and the Visigoths==
Early Roman Gaul came to an end late in the 3rd century. External pressures exacerbated internal weaknesses, and neglect of the Rhine frontier resulted in barbarian invasions and civil war. For a while Gaul, including Spain and Britain, was governed by a separate line of emperors (beginning with Postumus). However, there had still been no move to gain independence. In an attempt to save the Empire, Diocletian reorganized the provinces in 293, with the establishment of the &quot;Diocesis Viennensis&quot; in the south of Gaul, comprising the former Gallia Aquitania and Gallia Narbonensis. At the same time, Aquitania was divided into &quot;Aquitania Prima&quot;, with its see (capital) in &quot;Avaricum Biturigum&quot; (Bourges), &quot;Aquitania Secunda&quot; (see – &quot;Burdigala&quot;; the later Bordeaux) and &quot;Aquitania Tertia&quot;, better known as &quot;Novempopulania&quot; (&quot;land of the nine peoples&quot;), with its see in &quot;Elusa&quot; (Eauze). &quot;Novempopulania&quot; originated in boundaries set up by Caesar for the original Aquitania, who had kept some kind of separate sense of identity (Verus&#x27; mission to Rome aimed at demanding a separate province). After this restructuring, Gaul enjoyed stability and enhanced prestige. After the trans-Rhine invasion December 31 406 by 4 tribes (Alans, Sueves, Asding and Siling Vandals), the offices of the Gallic prefecture were moved from Trier to Arles even though the Rhine frontier was subsequently restored and under Roman control till 459 when Cologne was taken by the Franks. Roman attention had been shifted to the south to try to control the invaders and keep them from the Mediterranean, a policy which failed after the Vandals started to harass the coasts from their bases in southern Spain from the early 420s.

In the early 5th century, Aquitania was invaded by the Germanic Visigoths. The Emperor Flavius Honorius conceded land in Aquitania to the Visigoths . According to some sources the Visigoths were Roman &quot;foederati&quot; and Flavius acted to reward them under the principle of &quot;hospitalitas&quot; (i.e. the Roman legal framework under which civilians were required to provide quarters to soldiers). However, in 418, an independent Visigothic Kingdom was formed from parts of &quot;Novempopulania&quot; and &quot;Aquitania Secunda&quot;. The death of the general Aëtius (454) and a worsening debility on the part of the western government created a power vacuum. During the 460s and 470s, Visigoths encroached on Roman territory to the east, and in 476, the last imperial possessions in the south of Aquitania were ceded to the Visigoths. The Visigothic Kingdom later expanded over the Pyrenees and into the Iberian Peninsula.

From 602, an independent Duchy of Vasconia (or &quot;Wasconia&quot;) was formed, under a Frankish-Roman elite, in the former Visigothic stronghold of south-west Aquitania (i.e. the region known later as Gascony).

<text>Symphony Hall is a 2,262-seat concert venue in Birmingham, England. It was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 12 June 1991, although it had been in use since 15 April 1991. It is home to the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra and hosts around 270 events a year. It was completed at a cost of £30 million. The hall&#x27;s interior is modelled on the Musikverein in Vienna and the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam. The venue, managed alongside Town Hall, presents a programme of jazz, world, folk, rock, pop and classical concerts, organ recitals, spoken word, dance, comedy, educational and community performances, and is also used for conferences and business events as part of the International Convention Centre.

In 2016 the Concert Hall Acoustics expert Leo Beranek ranked Symphony Hall as having the finest acoustics in the United Kingdom, and the seventh best in the world. Proof of these fine acoustics is that a pre-opening acoustic test demonstrated that if a pin was dropped on stage, the sound could be heard from anywhere in the hall.

==Construction==

Symphony Hall was designed by Percy Thomas Partnership and Renton Howard Wood Levin, (who together formed the Convention Centre Partnership for the ICC) with specialist help from Russell Johnson, founder of acoustic consultants Artec. A particularly innovative feature is the hall&#x27;s acoustic flexibility. It has a reverberation chamber behind the stage and extending high along the sides, adding 50% to the hall&#x27;s volume, the doors to which can be remotely opened or closed. The U-shaped reverberation chamber area has a volume of . There is an acoustic canopy which can be raised or lowered above the stage. Dampening panels can be extended or retracted to ensure that the &quot;sound&quot; of the space is perfectly matched to the scale and style of the music to be performed. There are also reverse fan walls at the rear of the hall which provide further reflections of sound. All the walls and the ceiling are thick and are made of concrete.

The hall is built only from a covered railway line. To prevent the transmission of vibrations, the hall is mounted on rubber cushions, as is the railway track. The hall is also shielded from heavy traffic on Broad Street by double skins of concrete. Large, low-speed air ducting cuts the ventilation noise.

In 2001, a 6000-pipe symphony organ was installed, designed and built by Johannes Klais Orgelbau in Bonn and specially tailored to the hall&#x27;s reverberation chambers. This is now the largest mechanical action organ in the UK.

Through its management company B:Music Limited, Symphony Hall alongside Town Hall has charitable status and through an Education/Community department carries out a number of projects for schools, community groups and families, working with around 12,000 young people and 6,000 adults each year.

<text>The International Convention Centre (ICC) is a major conference venue in Birmingham, England. The centre incorporates Symphony Hall and faces Centenary Square, with another entrance leading to the canals of Birmingham. The Westside area, which includes Brindleyplace, is opposite the building on the other side of the canal. The centre is owned and operated by the NEC Group, who is also responsible for the nearby Arena Birmingham, just to the west of the complex.

==History and construction==
The building was designed by Percy Thomas Partnership and Renton Howard Wood Levin. The foundation stone was laid by Jacques Delors.

Construction was carried out by RM Douglas (know today as Tilbury Douglas).

After 4 years and 5 months of construction the project was finished. In all, over 1,500 workers helped construct the building. Over 60,000 cubic metres of concrete were used. The site was opened on 12 June 1991 by Queen Elizabeth II. Funds of £49.7 million were provided by the European Council. The total cost of construction was £200 million.

It is on the site of the Prince of Wales Theatre and Bingley Hall, the world&#x27;s first purpose-built exhibition hall, opened in 1850. Also on the site were numerous houses fronting King Edward&#x27;s Place as well as a brewery and inn. On the eastern side of this was King Alfreds Place which was also fronted by houses and a hotel. A listed Victorian cast iron urinal was removed before construction began, on condition that it be re-erected. Although it was taken to Tyseley Locomotive Works, it has never been restored.

The ICC hosted the 24th G8 summit in May 1998.

On a specified date in August, the building is used by companies, organisations and/ or individuals as part of &quot;Discovery Day&quot; which features events co-ordinated all over the city. In 2004, an area was used as an indoor country fair. The fair featured a Ferris wheel and small rides. In spring 2008, the hall hosted its first-party political conference, for the Labour Party. The venue has since hosted party conferences for all three main political parties over successive years.

==Architecture==
The façade of the building is covered in blue-tinted windows and white stone cladding. The entrance is adorned by a neon sculpture, by Ron Hasledon, named &quot;Birdlife&quot; which hangs above it. The entrance is used as a small performance area and small protests are sometimes held there. The south side of the building features a link bridge to the Hyatt Regency Hotel. When the pre-fabricated connecting bridge was delivered, it was found to be too short, as the plans for the hotel had been modified, moving it away from the ICC slightly, but the bridge makers had not been informed.

Inside the building, numerous connecting bridges and walkways line the atrium overhead connecting the ten halls and ten additional meeting rooms. The ICC has a total capacity of 8,000 delegates. The largest hall, Hall 3, can hold up to 3,000 delegates when fully using its 3,050m2 space.

Within the mall, there are a number of concessions, including a branch of Castle Fine Art which sells original paintings and prints, a WHSmith store, coffee shops including a Starbucks store as well as the box office for tickets for both Symphony Hall and other local theatres. Hotdesking space is also available with computers providing internet access.

<text>Centenary Square is a public square on the north side of Broad Street in Birmingham, England, named in 1989 to commemorate the centenary of Birmingham achieving city status. The square is used as a staging area for many of the city&#x27;s main cultural events including the Frankfurt Christmas Market, Arts Festivals, Remembrance Day Services, New Year&#x27;s Celebrations and during Christmas hosts a temporary ice rink and Ferris wheel. It is also the location of the Library of Birmingham. Paradise and Chamberlain Square are adjacent to it, 

The area was an industrial area of small workshops and canal wharves before it was purchased by the council in the 1920s for the creation of a grand civic centre scheme to include museums, council offices, cathedral and opera house. The scheme was abandoned after the arrival of World War II with only the Hall of Memory and half of the planned Baskerville House complete. After the war the scheme was revived in a simpler form however the council never managed to implement the design.

In 1991 the square was redesigned to complement the new International Convention Centre with new paving, railings and lamps designed by artist Tess Jaray, a fountain and several sculptures. During the construction and opening of the Library of Birmingham on the square in 2013 several of the elements of the 1991 design were removed and a library amphitheatre was built into the square. In 2014 a design competition was held to redesign the square. Construction of the redesigned square began in 2017 and was largely complete in 2019.

==History of the site==
===Early history===
The area where Centenary Square is today was an area of high density housing in the late 18th century. In 1745 John Baskerville built his own home, Easy Hill House in the general area of where now stands Baskerville House. The property comprised a house and outbuildings with formal gardens surrounding it. When John Baskerville died in 1775 he was buried within the grounds of his house. The house passed into the hands of John Ryland in 1788 and in 1791 when it was sacked and burned down by a riotous mob during the Priestley Riots. The house was demolished soon after it was ransacked.

An iron merchant named Gibson purchased the land in 1821 and cut a canal arm through the site in order to increase his mill business on Cambridge Street. The canal was completed in 1825 which in turn encouraged the expansion of other businesses and other canal arms were cut into what is now Centenary Square and the area became one of high density industrial buildings. Baskerville Wharf was cut into the area where the Hall of Memory now stands.

===Civic Centre proposals===

In 1918, William Haywood published the book &quot;The Development of Birmingham&quot; within which he proposed a scheme to create a grand civic centre west of Victoria Square. The original concept had provision for a cathedral, two exhibition halls, Natural History Museum, War Museum and memorial, Opera House, new post office and formal gardens. The area was cleared by the council in the 1920s to form the open space of what is now Centenary Square. The first building to be completed was the Hall of Memory and its associated colonnade in 1925, to facilitate this the southern arm of Baskerville Wharf was infilled. In 1926 a competition assessed by Henry Vaughan Lanchester was won by Maximilian Romanoff of Paris, but his scheme was judged too expensive and a basic plan was made by S. N. Cooke, A.J. Swann and the City Engineer Hubert Humphries. In 1936 after Winfields Rolling Mill ceased operations the Gibsons Arm could be infilled paving way for the construction of Baskerville House which was completed in 1938–40. The Second World War halted any further development of the Civic Centre and it remained unbuilt.

===Post War development===
In 1940-41 William Haywood produced another design for the civic centre, centred on a 42 metre high column topped by a 10 ft statue representing the Spirit of Birmingham. The incomplete Baskerville House would form the east wing of a U-shaped court. The council adopted the design in 1944 and William Bloye produced a maquette on the statue in 1948, but the next year it was abandoned as too expensive. In 1958, Alwyn Sheppard Fidler produced a less formal layout with water features and a line of residential towers linked by a municipal office podium on the north side. The Crescent Wharf tower blocks north of Cambridge Street by the City Architect, Alan Maudsley, in 1968 are a much modified version of its proposed towers.

Bingley Hall which stood at the western end of the square was damaged by fire in 1984. The city council used this as an opportunity to develop the western end of the square into the International Convention Centre and Birmingham Symphony Hall, which opened in 1991 and 1992 respectively.

===Centenary Square===
To complement the International Convention Centre and Symphony Hall the square was redeveloped in 1989 and renamed Centenary Square to commemorate 100 year since Birmingham attained city status. The £3.5 million construction of Centenary Way, a bridge across the Inner Ring Road linking Paradise Circus to Centenary Square was essential in creating an uninterrupted pedestrian route with the city centre, pedestrians previously had to cross beneath the road in an underground subway. The colonnade at the western end of the square was relocated to St. Thomas&#x27; Peace Garden. Artist Tess Jaray designed the railings, street furniture and paving for the square which included 525,000 pavers to be laid out in the design of a Persian Rug. Jaray was assisted by Tom Lomax. It had originally been planned for Jaray to design paving for the interior of the convention centre. Lomax designed the &quot;Spirit of Enterprise&quot; fountain which stood in the centre of the square, David Patten designed &quot;Industry and Genius&quot; an artwork dedicated to John Baskerville, located outside Baskerville House. As the centrepiece to the square was &quot;Forward&quot; an artwork named after the city motto, designed by Raymond Mason the sculpture stood on a podium centrally within the square. The square officially opened in 1991.

As part of the millennium celebrations a beacon named the &quot;Flame of Hope&quot; was erected between The Rep and Baskerville House. Cliff Richard lit the flame during the inaugural ceremony; however funding problems led to the &quot;perpetual&quot; flame being regularly turned off and it was removed for the construction of the Library of Birmingham. The &quot;Forward&quot; statue was removed after being destroyed by arson on 17 April 2003. A statue of King Edward VII by Albert Toft was relocated from Highgate Park to the square in November 2010 where it now stands outside Baskerville House.

During the construction of the Library of Birmingham in 2010–13, the &quot;Spirit of Enterprise&quot; fountain was removed to storage permanently at the Museum&#x27;s Collection Centre. In the place where the fountain once stood an amphitheatre was created as part of the library which is accessed through the library. In the newly created lawns outside the library the statue &quot;A Real Birmingham Family&quot; was unveiled in 2014 designed by Gillian Wearing.

===Redesign===

An international design competition was held through the RIBA and the Landscape Institute on behalf of Birmingham City Council in October 2014 to find a design to transform the square. Funding for the competition and development of the square has come from the GBSLEP.

£5 million for construction costs has been allocated for the scheme with extra funding for design fees. Project Management and Quantity Surveying will be provided by Acivico Ltd and the contractor will be procured through the Constructing West Midlands (CWM) Framework agreement. In stage two, five shortlisted designs will be given a £5,000 honorarium to develop and present their designs to a judging panel and public consultation.

On 13 January 2015 five shortlisted proposals were chosen from 185 entries, these were from Atkins, Barton Willmore, Broadway Malyan, Graeme Massie Architects and Open Studio. The overall winner, Graeme Massie Architects, was announced in June 2015. Construction work on the winning scheme commenced in April 2017, with a planned completion date of late 2018.

Due to the recent terror attacks in Europe new security features are to be incorporated into the design of the square. These features have resulted in the chopping down of a mature 90 year old London Plane tree sited on the edge of the square and Broad Street. A campaign was launched by local supporters of the tree to save it. However the city council insisted it had to go to ensure the security arrangements for the square and the introduction of the metro line to Broad Street could both go ahead. The tree was chopped down in February 2017. on 27 July 2019, The square will be part of the Commonwealth Social festival to mark three years to go for the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, include the launch of the official emblem.

==Surrounding buildings==
The square is bounded to the north by Birmingham Repertory Theatre (1971), Library of Birmingham (2013) and Baskerville House (1938). The western edge of the square is defined by the International Convention Centre (1991), Symphony Hall (1992) and Hyatt Hotel (1990). To the south of the square is Broad Street beyond which are the Birmingham Municipal Bank headquarters (1933), One Centenary Square (2018) and Alpha Tower (1972). The southern side of the square is earmarked for redevelopment as part of the Arena Central scheme. To the east across Centenary Way is the Copthorne Hotel (1987) and One Centenary Way, currently under construction as part of the Paradise development.

==Art and memorials==
All sculptures commissioned for the square in 1989-1991 were paid for by the &quot;Per Cent For Arts&quot; scheme which only pays toward building costs if public sculpture forms at least 1% of the entire building project.

===Current===
*Boulton, Watt and Murdoch – Unveiled on 14 September 1956, the statue was designed by William Bloye at a cost of £15,500. The 4.65m high statue depicting the three men discussing engine plans is sculpted in bronze with a gold leaf finish on a plinth of Portland stone. The statue is located on the south side of Broad Street outside the House of Sport, this location was meant to be temporary as it was originally intended to stand outside a planetarium as part of the Civic Centre but this was never built.
*Industry and Genius – Unveiled in 1990 by artist David Patten as a monument to John Baskerville, eight 1.5m high free standing blocks sculpted from Portland stone with bronze letters embossed on each. The letters spell the word &quot;Virgil&quot; the poet whose work was translated by Baskerville in 1757. Funded by the Public Arts Commissions Agency as part of the Centenary Square scheme. The sculpture is located outside the portico of Baskerville House.
* Hall of Memory
* 1914 statue of King Edward VII by Albert Toft, moved to the square in November 2010.

===Former===
* &quot;Forward&quot;, a sculpture by Raymond Mason which was unveiled in 1991. It cost £275,000. It was destroyed by arson on 17 April 2003. It was locally known as the &quot;Lurpak sculpture&quot;.]
* In 2005 a Ferris wheel known locally as the Birmingham Wheel was constructed in the square to provide views for the public. The wheel finally closed on 5 September 2006 and was sold to a company in Australia.
* &quot;Spirit of Enterprise&quot; (fountain, designed by Tom Lomax) This fountain is currently removed.

==Transport==
Bus services stop frequently at the square, and in December 2019, the West Midlands Metro was extended to terminate at Library of Birmingham. The line has since been extended to Edgbaston Village.

<doc id="342214" wikidata="Q233077" url="?curid=342214" title="Fulvia">
<text>Fulvia (; d. 40 BC) was an aristocratic Roman woman who lived during the late Roman Republic. Fulvia&#x27;s birth into an important political dynasty facilitated her relationships and, later on, marriages to Publius Clodius Pulcher, Gaius Scribonius Curio, and Mark Antony. All of these men would go on to lead increasingly promising political careers as &quot;populares&quot;, tribunes, and supporters of Julius Caesar.

Fulvia remains an important figure in ancient Roman history due to her perseverance as a woman heavily involved in politics, as well as her role in the Perusine War against Caesar Augustus (Octavian, future emperor Augustus). She played an important political role behind the scenes of her three marriages. Though she is most famous for her involvement in Antony&#x27;s career, there are scholarly debates taking place over whether Fulvia was already involved in politics before her husbands or after she married them, as a result of which she developed an increasingly public voice overtime. She is most famous for her activities during her third marriage and her involvement in the Perusine War of 41–40 BC. Though not certain, she was possibly the first Roman non-mythological woman to appear on Roman coins.

==Birth and early life==
Fulvia was born and raised either in Rome or Tusculum. Her date of birth is not known. Fulvia was a member of the Fulvia gens, which hailed from Tusculum. The Fulvii were one of the most distinguished Republican plebeian wealthy families in Rome; various members of the family achieved consulship and became senators, though no member of the Fulvii is on record as a consul after 125 BC. Fulvia was the only child of Marcus Fulvius Bambalio and Sempronia. As a result, Fulvia may have also represented the last of both the Fulvii and the Sempronii families, which meant she was likely an heiress of extreme worth and value. Her father Marcus received the nickname &quot;Bambalio&quot;, from the Latin &quot;to stutter&quot;, because of his hesitancy in speech. Her maternal grandfather was Sempronius Tuditanus, who was described by Cicero as a madman, who liked to throw his money to the people from the Rostra.

==Marriage to Clodius Pulcher==

Her first marriage was to Publius Clodius Pulcher, circa 62 BC. Fulvia and Clodius had two children together, a son also named Publius Clodius Pulcher and a daughter, Claudia. As a couple they went everywhere together. Claudia later married Octavian, who would later become the first Roman emperor.

In 52 BC, Clodius ran for praetor; his political competition with a consular candidate and rival, Titus Annius Milo, escalated to violence. Milo and his gang killed Clodius on January 18 on the Appian Way. Fulvia first appears in the record after his death. Fulvia and her mother Sempronia were present at the trial of Milo, and Fulvia&#x27;s was the last testimony given by the prosecution. Milo was convicted and exiled.

While alive, Clodius had control of many gangs, and Fulvia retained the power and status that came with their loyalty. There is some evidence that she may have been involved in organizing the &quot;collegia&quot;. Even after Clodius&#x27; death, however, the Clodian following remained strong because of Fulvia&#x27;s understanding of her political potential, and Fulvia used this strong political following to avenge his death; she and her mother brought his body to the streets of Rome so the Roman citizens would see his wounds and grow angry towards Milo. Fulvia therefore actively inserted herself into the political atmosphere that followed the death of her first husband, as a &quot;visible symbol and reminder of his presence.&quot;

==Marriage to Scribonius Curio==
With Pompey&#x27;s seizure of power in Rome, he militarily forced out any remaining supporters of the late Clodius, including captains and tribunes; actions that prompted Fulvia to uphold her late husband&#x27;s legacy alone within the city, taking advantage of every opportunity that allowed her to extend her influence and political prestige.

Her widowhood did not last long, as the customary period of mourning for Romans was ten months. Fulvia most likely married her second husband, Gaius Scribonius Curio, soon after his return from Asia and her mourning period had passed. They were married in 52-51 BC, which positioned him as the legitimate &quot;continuator and heir of Clodius&#x27; &quot;popularis&quot; policies,&quot; though he had been an &quot;optimate.&quot; Like Clodius, Curio was very popular with the plebeians. He was from a less distinguished family than Clodius, being from a new consular family, but he may have had more wealth. He soon became important to Gaius Julius Caesar and Clodian supporters, becoming a trusted and valued political ally to these vitally important individuals because of his marriage to Fulvia and her emphasis on promoting the Clodian legacy. In 50 BC, the year after he married Fulvia, Curio won election as a tribune.

Curio died in 49 BC, killed during the Battle of the Bagradas in North Africa, fighting for Julius Caesar against King Juba I of Numidia. During the civil war, Fulvia was most likely in Rome or nearby, because Caesar&#x27;s troops had taken over Italy. At the time, she would have had her two children by Clodius and was either pregnant with Curio&#x27;s son or had already given birth.

==Marriage to Mark Antony==
After Curio&#x27;s death in Africa, the widowed Fulvia was still important in elite circles and her political interests were well known. Marriage to her would provide an important tie to Clodius and his &quot;clientela,&quot; and could offer a husband money and political organization. Also, her next husband would become the stepfather to Clodius&#x27; children, further linking him to the Clodian faction.

As it turned out, Fulvia&#x27;s third and final marriage was to Mark Antony in 47 or 46 BC, a few years after Curio&#x27;s death, although Cicero suggested that Fulvia and Antony had had a relationship since 58 BC. Cicero wrote about their relationship in his &quot;Philippicae&quot; as a way of attacking Antony. According to him, while Fulvia and Clodius were married, Antony once left a military post to sneak back into Rome during the night and personally deliver a love letter to Fulvia describing his love for her and saying he had stopped seeing the famous actress Cytheris. Cicero also suggested that Antony had married Fulvia for her money, though at the time of their marriage, Antony was an established politician. He had already been tribune in 49 BC, commanded armies under Caesar and was the Master of the Horse in 47 BC.

Fulvia played a very influential role in Mark Antony&#x27;s political career. She was involved in his policies, such as the decision to give Sicilians Roman citizenship, as well as to confirm Deiotarus in his kingdom, and she was a very persuasive campaigner for her husband. It is also possible that former Clodian policies were continued through him. They had two sons together, Marcus Antonius Antyllus and Iullus Antonius, and throughout their marriage, Fulvia defended Antony from Cicero&#x27;s attacks, sustained his popularity with his soldiers and hindered Octavian&#x27;s ascension to power. Fulvia still retained the support of gangs formerly ruled by her first husband, Clodius. By publicly associating himself with Clodius&#x27; children, Antony was able to gather that support and, through Fulvia&#x27;s influence, to use what was left of Clodius&#x27; gangs in his own gang wars against Dolabella and his supporters.

Some historians believe she appeared on coins minted during her husband&#x27;s campaign, though others disagree. She demonstrated leadership during the Perusine War and unwavering support for Anthony. She allegedly accompanied Antony to his military camp at Brundisium in 44 BC. Appian wrote that in December 44 and again in 43 BC, while Antony was abroad and Cicero campaigned for Antony to be declared an enemy of the state, Fulvia tried to block such declarations by soliciting support for Antony.

Antony formed the Second Triumvirate with Octavian, the future emperor Augustus, and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus in 43 BC and began to conduct proscriptions. To solidify the political alliance and to advance Clodian interests, Fulvia&#x27;s daughter Claudia was married to the young Octavian. Appian and Cassius Dio describe Fulvia as being involved in the violent proscriptions that were used to destroy enemies and gain badly needed funds to secure control of Rome. Antony pursued his political enemies, especially Cicero, who had openly criticized him for abusing his powers as consul after Caesar&#x27;s assassination. Although many ancient sources wrote that Fulvia was happy to take revenge against Cicero for Antony&#x27;s and Clodius&#x27; sake, Cassius Dio is the only one who describes the joy with which she pierced the tongue of the dead Cicero with her golden hairpins, as a final revenge against Cicero&#x27;s power of speech.

===Perusine War (41 BC to 40 BC) and Fulvia&#x27;s death===
====Background====
In 42 BC, Antony and Octavian left Rome to pursue Julius Caesar&#x27;s assassins, Marcus Junius Brutus and Gaius Cassius Longinus. Fulvia was left behind as the most powerful woman in Rome, seeing as though she had already manifested her political aptitudes throughout the decades. According to Cassius Dio, Fulvia controlled the politics of Rome. Dio wrote that &quot;the following year Publius Servilius and Lucius Antonius nominally became consuls, but in reality it was Antonius and Fulvia. She, the mother-in‑law of Octavian and wife of Antony, had no respect for Lepidus because of his slothfulness, and managed affairs herself, so that neither the senate nor the people transacted any business contrary to her pleasure.&quot;

Shortly afterwards, the triumvirs distributed the provinces among themselves. Lepidus took the west and Antony went to Egypt, where he met Cleopatra VII. Octavian returned to Rome in 41 BC to dispense land to Caesar&#x27;s veterans, divorced Fulvia&#x27;s daughter and accused Fulvia of aiming at supreme power. Fearing that Octavian was gaining the veterans&#x27; loyalty at Antony&#x27;s expense, Fulvia traveled constantly with her children to the new settlements in order to remind the veterans of their debt to Antony. Fulvia also tried to delay the land settlements until Antony returned to Rome, so that the two &quot;triumvirs&quot; could share the credit. With Octavian in Italy and Antony abroad, Fulvia allied with her brother-in-law Lucius Antonius and publicly endorsed Mark Antony in opposition to Octavian.

These actions caused political and social unrest. In 41 BC, tensions between Octavian and Fulvia escalated to war in Italy: the Perusine War of 41-40 BC. According to Appian, Fulvia was a central cause of the war, due to her jealousy of Antony and Cleopatra&#x27;s affair in Egypt; she may have escalated the tensions between Octavian and Lucius in order to draw back Antony&#x27;s attention to Italy. However, Appian also wrote that the other main causes were the selfish ambitions of the commanders and their inability to control their own soldiers.

Together with Lucius Antonius, Fulvia raised eight legions in Italy to fight for Antony&#x27;s rights against Octavian, an event known as the Perusine War. The army occupied Rome for a short time, and Lucius organized his troops at Praeneste, but eventually retreated to Perusia (modern Perugia), where Octavian besieged him. Lucius waited for Antony&#x27;s legions in Gaul to come to his aid. However, unaware of the war, Antony was still in the eastern provinces, and his legions were unsure of his commands and did not assist Lucius. Although during this conflict, Fulvia was at Praeneste, there is evidence she helped Lucius. According to Appian, she &quot;urged Ventidius, Asinius, and Calenus from Gaul to help Lucius, and having gathered another army, she sent it to Lucius under the command of Plancus.&quot;

==== Octavian&#x27;s poem on Fulvia quoted by Martial ====
During the war, Octavian&#x27;s soldiers at Perusia used sling bullets inscribed with insults directed at Fulvia personally and Octavian wrote a vulgar epigram directed at her in 40 BC, referring to Antony&#x27;s affair with the ex-courtesan queen of Cappadocia Glaphyra. It is recorded by Martial within one of his own poems:

The sling bullets are very significant because they demonstrate the gender dynamics of Rome at that time. The sling- bullets are a playful metaphor, aimed at degrading and mocking Fulvia for her masculine tendencies. The bullets were shaped like a penis tips, and they share the same Latin technical term &quot;glans.&quot;. The fact that her name is written on bullets shaped like a penis tip points to the idea that she embodies masculine characteristics and is being thus ridiculed. Her assertiveness and boldness is being vilified and intended to undermine her legitimacy. 

====Fulvia&#x27;s death====
The siege at Perusia lasted two months before Octavian starved Lucius into surrender in February 40 BC. After Lucius&#x27; surrender, Fulvia fled to Greece with her children. Appian writes that she met Antony in Athens, and he was upset with her involvement in the war. Antony then sailed back to Rome to deal with Octavian, and Fulvia died of an unknown illness in exile in Sicyon, near Corinth, Achaea. After her death, Antony and Octavian used it as an opportunity to blame their quarrelling on her. According to Plutarch, &quot;there was even more opportunity for a reconciliation with Caesar. For when Antony reached Italy, and Caesar manifestly intended to make no charges against him, and Antony himself was ready to put upon Fulvia the blame for whatever was charged against himself.&quot;
After Fulvia&#x27;s death, Antony married Octavian&#x27;s sister, Octavia Minor, to publicly demonstrate his reconciliation with Octavian, but Antony never regained his position and influence in Italy.

Once Antony and Octavia were married, she took in and reared all of Fulvia&#x27;s children. The fate of Fulvia&#x27;s daughter, Clodia Pulchra, after her divorce from Octavian is unknown. Her son Marcus Antonius Antyllus was executed by Octavian in Alexandria, Egypt in 30 BC. Her youngest child, Iullus Antonius, was spared by Octavian and raised from 40 BC by Octavia Minor. Iullus married Octavia&#x27;s daughter and Octavian&#x27;s niece Claudia Marcella Major and they had a son Lucius Antonius and possibly a daughter Iulla Antonia.

<doc id="342217" wikidata="Q7705569" url="?curid=342217" title="Tess Jaray">
<text>Tess Jaray (born 1937) is a British painter and printmaker. She taught at The Slade School of Fine Art, UCL from 1968 until 1999. Over the last twenty years Jaray has completed a succession of major public art projects. She was made an Honorary Fellow of RIBA (Royal Institute for British Architects) in 1995 and a Royal Academician in 2010.

== Early life ==
Born in Vienna in 1937, Jaray grew up in rural Worcestershire, England, where her parents emigrated in 1938 after the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany made it unsafe for people of Jewish descent to live there. Jaray&#x27;s father Franz Ferdinand Jaray was a chemical engineer and industrial inventor. Her mother, Pauline Arndt, attended Art School in Vienna. Jaray&#x27;s great aunt was the gallerist Lea Bondi Jaray who was responsible for bringing many of the German Expressionists to London. Noting the influence of Gustav Klimt, leader of the Vienna Secessionists, Jaray has written that ‘He was one of the very first artists I learned about as a teenager.’

== Travel, education and influence ==
Jaray studied at the Saint Martins School of Art and the Slade School of Fine Art. With a guaranteed place at the Slade she took time out to travel to Paris where she stayed at no.16 Rue des Cannettes in the hotel run by Marcel Proust&#x27;s former housekeeper, Céleste Albaret. In Paris Jaray made several formative relationships including with fellow hotel guest Valli Myers and the Slovenian painter Zoran Mušič.
After five months Jaray returned to London to attend the Slade. At that time William Coldstream was Professor of Painting and the art historian E.H. Gombrich was in his last year as Professor of Art History. Both messianic figures influenced the young artist&#x27;s thinking. 
In the few years following art school Jaray was awarded two traveling scholarships. In 1960 she received the Abbey Minor Traveling Scholarship to Italy. Here Jaray experienced for the first time the impact of Italian Architecture, as well as the art she had gone there to see. The following year in 1961 she received the French Government Scholarship, which allowed her to return to France to live and work for some months. While in Paris she worked in the etching studio of Stanley William Hayter at Atelier 17.

== Technique and teaching ==
The impact of Renaissance architectural spaces Jaray encountered on her travels in Italy were formative for the development of her distinctive technique. In these ceilings she saw how simple lines interacted to transform space, powerfully inducing emotional responses. Writing on Jaray&#x27;s paintings of the 60s Jasia Reichardt said they could be called &#x27;&quot;ceiling geography&quot; because they suggest views of an interior seen from below... Her paintings suggest some underlying mystery through the suggestion of architectural perspective.&#x27; Much of her career as a painter has been spent investigating the quality of effects geometry, pattern, repetition and colour have on space. The patterns she creates evoke spatial ambiguities and shifting structures which work on the viewer&#x27;s perceptions in subtle ways. According to the critic Terry Pitts, her work ‘sense(s) the way in which history of decoration and patterning is embedded with elemental human experiences and impulses’.
At this time of significant development, in 1964 Jaray began teaching. For four years she taught at Hornsey College of Art, before becoming the first female teacher at the Slade in 1968. In 1999 Jaray became Reader Emeritus in Fine Art at the Slade.

== Public commissions ==

Between 1985 and 2000 Jaray devoted much of her time to working on public commissions, applying her understanding of architectural space and pattern to large-scale projects in public spaces. Her significant work of the eighties was a terrazzo pattern design for London Victoria train station. In the nineties she completed further large-scale public projects including paving, lamps and railings in Centenary Square, Birmingham (torn up in 2018); Wakefield Cathedral Precinct; Jubilee Square at Leeds General Infirmary; and the forecourt for the new British Embassy in Moscow.

== Exhibtions ==
Jaray&#x27;s work was included in the 2021 exhibition &quot;Women in Abstraction&quot; at the Centre Pompidou.

== Writing ==
Throughout her career Jaray has used writing as a way to reflect upon her work. However, from the mid-nineties Jaray started increasingly to write about other artists’ work. Several of these pieces have appeared as catalogue essays for exhibitions and on BBC Radio 3&#x27;s The Essay. In 2001 Jaray collaborated with the German writer W.G. Sebald to realise an exhibition and book. FROM THE RINGS OF SATURN AND VERTIGO at Purdy Hicks Gallery, London presented sixteen pairings of Jaray&#x27;s visual response to fragments from Sebald&#x27;s novels &quot;The Rings of Saturn&quot; and &quot;Vertigo&quot;. Later that year twenty-three of the writer&#x27;s micropoems were brought together with Jaray&#x27;s paintings in For Years Now. It was published by Short Books in London shortly before Sebald&#x27;s death in December that year. A selection of Jaray&#x27;s essays and reflections on art and life were collected in Painting: Mysteries &amp; Confessions published in 2010 by Lenz Books. In 1995 Jaray was made Honorary Fellow of the RIBA (Royal Institute for British Architects) for her contribution to urban design. In 2010 Jaray was elected Royal Academician. She lives and works in London.

<doc id="342222" wikidata="Q7713332" url="?curid=342222" title="The Amazing Pudding">
<text>The Amazing Pudding (1983–1993) was a British fan magazine devoted to Pink Floyd, Roger Waters, and the solo careers of other Pink Floyd band members, including Syd Barrett. It was seen as being the main fanzine of Pink Floyd during the time of its publication. Journalist Stuart Maconie wrote about &quot;The Amazing Pudding&quot; as part of a feature in the April 1993 issue of &quot;Q&quot;.

== History ==
The title, &quot;The Amazing Pudding&quot;, was originally a working title for Pink Floyd&#x27;s 1970 &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot; suite.

The magazine was established by Ivor Trueman and was co-edited and published, variously, by Trueman (issues 1–17, 1983–), Andy Mabbett (issues 2–60, 1983–1993), Bruno MacDonald (issues 24–60, 1987–1993), and Dave Walker (issues 13–60, –1993), for ten years and 60 issues.

MacDonald, who started writing for the magazine starting with issue 15, described the self-published and self-distributed publication – available in the United Kingdom at large record stores like HMV, Tower Records, and Virgin among others – as being purely independent, illustrated by its irreverent take on the band and its members.

== Associated publications ==
Trueman went on to publish the Syd Barrett fanzine called &quot;Opel&quot; before co-founding Delerium Records in 1991.

Mabbett wrote three books on Pink Floyd: &quot;Pink Floyd: The Visual Documentary&quot; (1994, with Miles), &quot;The Complete Guide to the Music of Pink Floyd&quot; (1995), and &quot;Pink Floyd: The Music and the Mystery&quot; (2010). Mabbett also wrote the section on Pink Floyd in the official program for the band&#x27;s 1996 induction into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Mabbett appears as a Pink Floyd expert in the documentary &quot;Whatever Happened to Pink Floyd?&quot;

MacDonald also edited a Sidgwick &amp; Jackson book (later republished by Da Capo Press) that was an anthology of collected writings about the band called &quot;Pink Floyd: Through the Eyes of... the Band, Its Fans, Friends, and Foes&quot; (1996).

<doc id="342230" wikidata="Q77608" url="?curid=342230" title="Edith Hamilton">
<text>Edith Hamilton (August 12, 1867 – May 31, 1963) was an American educator and internationally known author who was one of the most renowned classicists of her era in the United States. A graduate of Bryn Mawr College, she also studied in Germany at the University of Leipzig and the University of Munich. Hamilton began her career as an educator and head of the Bryn Mawr School, a private college preparatory school for girls in Baltimore, Maryland; however, Hamilton is best known for her essays and best-selling books on ancient Greek and Roman civilizations.

Hamilton&#x27;s second career as an author began after she retired from the Bryn Mawr School in 1922. She was sixty-two years old when her first book, &quot;The Greek Way,&quot; was published in 1930. It was an immediate success and a featured selection by the Book-of-the-Month Club in 1957. Hamilton&#x27;s other notable works include &quot;The Roman Way&quot; (1932), &quot;The Prophets of Israel&quot; (1936), &quot;Mythology&quot; (1942), and &quot;The Echo of Greece&quot; (1957).

Critics have acclaimed Hamilton&#x27;s books for their lively interpretations of ancient cultures. She is described as the classical scholar who &quot;brought into clear and brilliant focus the Golden Age of Greek life and thought ... with Homeric power and simplicity in her style of writing&quot;. Her works are said to influence modern lives through a &quot;realization of the refuge and strength in the past&quot; to those &quot;in the troubled present.&quot; Hamilton&#x27;s younger sister was Alice Hamilton, an expert in industrial toxicology and the first woman appointed to the faculty of Harvard University.

==Early life and education==
===Childhood and family===

Edith Hamilton, the eldest child of American parents Gertrude Pond (1840–1917) and Montgomery Hamilton (1843–1909), was born on August 12, 1867, in Dresden, Germany. Shortly after her birth, the Hamilton family returned to the United States and made their home in Fort Wayne, Indiana, where Edith&#x27;s grandfather, Allen Hamilton, had settled in the early 1820s. Edith spent her youth among her extended family in Fort Wayne.

Edith&#x27;s grandfather, Allen Hamilton, was an Irish immigrant who came to Indiana in 1823 by way of Canada and settled in Fort Wayne. In 1828 he married Emerine Holman, the daughter of Indiana Supreme Court Justice Jesse Lynch Holman. Allen Hamilton became a successful Fort Wayne businessman and a land speculator. Much of the city of Fort Wayne was built on land he once owned. The Hamilton family&#x27;s large estate on a three-block area of downtown Fort Wayne included three homes. The family also built a home at Mackinac Island, Michigan, where they spent many of their summers. For the most part, the second and third generations of the extended Hamilton family, which included Edith&#x27;s family, as well as her uncles, aunts, and cousins, lived on inherited wealth.

Montgomery Hamilton, a scholarly man of leisure, was one of Allen and Emerine (Holman) Hamilton&#x27;s eleven children; however, only five of the siblings lived. Her father attended Princeton University and Harvard Law School and also studied in Germany. Montgomery met Gertrude Pond, the daughter of a wealthy Wall Street broker and sugar importer, while living in Germany. They were married in 1866. Montgomery Hamilton became a partner in a wholesale grocery business in Fort Wayne, but the partnership dissolved in 1885 and the business failure caused a financial loss for the family. Afterwards, Montgomery Hamilton retreated from public life. Edith&#x27;s mother, Gertrude, who loved modern literature and spoke several languages, remained socially active in the community and had &quot;wide cultural and intellectual interests.&quot; After her father&#x27;s business failed, Edith realized that she would need to provide a livelihood for herself and decided to become an educator.

Edith was the oldest of five siblings that included three sisters (Alice (1869–1970), Margaret (1871–1969), and Norah (1873–1945)) and a brother (Arthur &quot;Quint&quot; (1886–1967)), all of whom were accomplished in their respective fields. Edith became an educator and renowned author; Alice became a founder of industrial medicine; Margaret, like her older sister, Edith, became an educator and headmistress at Bryn Mawr School; and Norah was an artist. Hamilton&#x27;s youngest sibling, Arthur, was nineteen years her junior. He became a writer, professor of Spanish, and assistant dean for foreign students at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Arthur was the only sibling to marry; he and his wife, Mary Neal (d. 1965), had no children.

===Education===

Because Edith&#x27;s parents disliked the public school system&#x27;s curriculum, they taught their children at home. As she once described him, &quot;My father was well-to-do, but he wasn&#x27;t interested in making money; he was interested in making people use their minds.&quot; Edith, who learned to read at an early age, became an excellent storyteller. Hamilton credited her father for guiding her towards studies of the classics; he began teaching her Latin when she was seven years old. Her father also introduced her to Greek language and literature, where her mother taught the Hamilton children French and had them tutored in German.

In 1884 Edith began two years of study at Miss Porter&#x27;s Finishing School for Young Ladies (now known as Miss Porter&#x27;s School) in Farmington, Connecticut, where attendance was a family tradition for the Hamilton women. Three of Hamilton&#x27;s aunts, three cousins, and her three sisters attended the school.

Hamilton returned to Indiana in 1886 and began four years of preparation prior to her acceptance at Bryn Mawr College near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1891. She majored in Greek and Latin and was awarded a Bachelor of Arts and a Master of Arts degree in 1894. Hamilton spent the year after her graduation as a fellow in Latin at Bryn Mawr College and was awarded the Mary E. Garrett European Fellowship, the college&#x27;s highest honor. The cash award from Bryn Mawr provided funds to enable Edith and Alice, who had completed her medical degree at the University of Michigan in 1893, to pursue further studies in Germany for an academic year. Hamilton became the first woman to enroll at the University of Munich.

====Studies in Germany====
In the fall of 1895 the Hamilton sisters departed for Germany, where Alice intended to continue her studies in pathology at the University of Leipzig and Edith planned to study the classics and attend lectures. At that time, most North American women, including Edith and Alice, registered as auditors for their classes. When the sisters arrived in Leipzig, they found a fair number of foreign women studying at the university. They were informed that women could attend lectures, but they were expected to remain &quot;invisible&quot; and would not be allowed to participate in discussions.

According to Alice, &quot;Edith was extremely disappointed with the lectures she attended.&quot; Although they were thorough, the lectures &quot;lost sight of the beauty of literature by focusing on obscure grammatical points.&quot; As a result, they decided to enroll at the University of Munich, but it was not much of an improvement. Initially, it was uncertain whether Edith would be allowed to audit lectures, but she was granted permission to do so, albeit under trying conditions. According to Alice, when Edith arrived at her first class, she was escorted to the lecture platform and seated in a chair beside the lecturer, facing the audience, &quot;so that nobody would be contaminated by contact with her.&quot; Edith is quoted as saying, &quot;the head of the University used to stare at me, then shake his head and say sadly to a colleague, &#x27;There now, you see what&#x27;s happened? We&#x27;re right in the midst of the woman question.&#x27;&quot;

==Career==
===Educator===
Hamilton intended to remain in Munich, Germany, to earn a doctoral degree, but her plans changed after Martha Carey Thomas, president of Bryn Mawr College, persuaded Hamilton to return to the United States. In 1896 Hamilton became head administrator of Bryn Mawr School. Founded in 1885 as a college preparatory school for girls in Baltimore, Maryland, Bryn Mawr School was the country&#x27;s only private high school for women that prepared all of its students for collegiate coursework. The school&#x27;s students were required to pass Bryn Mawr College&#x27;s entrance exam as a requirement for graduation.

Although Hamilton never completed her doctorate, she did become an &quot;inspiring and respected head of the school&quot; and was revered as an outstanding teacher of the classics, along with being an effective and successful administrator. She enhanced student life, maintained its high academic standards, and offered new ideas. Hamilton was unafraid to suggest new initiatives such as having her school&#x27;s basketball team compete against another girls&#x27; team from a nearby boarding school. The proposed athletic competition was considered a scandalous suggestion for the time because news coverage would include the names of the participants. After Hamilton convinced the local press not to cover the event, the games proceeded and it became an annual tradition.

In 1906, Hamilton&#x27;s accomplishments as an educator and administrator were recognized when she was named the first headmistress in the school&#x27;s history. Hamilton, who believed in providing students with a &quot;rigorous&quot; curriculum, successfully transitioned the girls school from its &quot;mediocre beginnings into one of the foremost preparatory institutions in the country.&quot; Her insistence on offering challenging standards to the students and different options on school policies led to confrontations with Dean Thomas. As Hamilton became increasingly frustrated with the situation at the school, her health also declined. She retired in 1922 at the age of fifty-four, after twenty-six years of service to the school.

===Classicist and author===
After retiring as an educator in 1922 and moving to New York City in 1924, Hamilton began a second career as an author of essays and best-selling books on ancient Greek and Roman civilizations. She had studied Greek and Latin from her youth and it remained her lifelong interest. &quot;I came to the Greeks early,&quot; Hamilton told an interviewer when she was ninety-one, &quot;and I found answers in them. Greece&#x27;s great men let all their acts turn on the immortality of the soul. We don&#x27;t really act as if we believed in the soul&#x27;s immortality and that&#x27;s why we are where we are today.&quot;

For more than fifty years her &quot;love affair with Greece had smoldered without literary outlet&quot;. At the suggestion of Rosamund Gilder, editor of &quot;Theater Arts Monthly,&quot; Hamilton began by writing essays about Greek drama and comedies. Several of her early articles were published in &quot;Theater Arts Monthly&quot; before she began writing the series of books on ancient Greek and Roman life for which she is most noted. Hamilton went on to become America&#x27;s most renowned classicist of her era.

According to her biographer, Barbara Sicherman, Hamilton&#x27;s life was &quot;ruled by a passionately nonconformist vision&quot; that was also the source of her &quot;strength and vitality&quot; as well as her &quot;appeal as public figure and author.&quot; However, Hamilton was not, and did not claim to be, a scholar. She did not attempt to present excessive detailed facts from the past. Instead, Hamilton focused on readability and uncovering &quot;truths of the spirit,&quot; which she found from ancient writers. Drawing from Greek, Roman, Hebrew, and early Christian writings, Hamilton put into words what ancient people were like by concentrating on what they wrote about their own lives. Using the qualities and styles of the ancient writers, she emulated their directness, strived for perfection, and did not include footnotes.

;&quot;The Greek Way&quot;
Hamilton was sixty-two when her first book, &quot;The Greek Way&quot;, was published in 1930 and is considered by some as her most honored work. The successful book, which Hamilton wrote at the urging of Elling Annestad, an editor at W. W. Norton Company, made her a well-known author in the United States. The bestseller drew comparisons between ancient Greece and modern-day life with essays about some of the great figures of Athenian history and literature. Critically praised for its &quot;vivid and graceful prose,&quot; the book brought Hamilton immediate acclaim and established her reputation as a scholar. Biographer Robert Kanigel states that &quot;&quot;The Greek Way&quot; renders the ancient Greek mind accessible to the modern reader. It serves up a delectable appetizer of Greek civilization that leaves you begging for the rest of the meal. It is a work of popularization of the highest order.&quot;

In Hamilton&#x27;s view, Greek civilization at its peak represented a &quot;flowering of the mind&quot; that has yet to be equaled in the history of the world. &quot;The Greek Way&quot; showed that the Greeks recognized and appreciated such things as love, athletic games, love of knowledge, fine arts, and intelligent conversation. In &quot;East and West,&quot; the first of the book&#x27;s twelve chapters, Hamilton described the differences between the West and the Eastern nations which preceded it. One book reviewer noted that the Greeks, which Hamilton considered the first Westerners, challenged Eastern ways that &quot;remained the same throughout the ages, forever remote from all that is modern.&quot; Hamilton further suggested that the modern spirit of the West was &quot;a Greek discovery, and the place of the Greeks is in the modern world.&quot;

More recent writers have used Hamilton&#x27;s observations in contrasting the civilizations and cultures of the East with that of the West. In comparing ancient Egypt with Greece, for instance, Hamilton&#x27;s writing describes the unique geography, climate, agriculture, and government. Historian James Golden cites from &quot;The Greek Way&quot; that &quot;Egyptian society was preoccupied with death.&quot; Its pharaohs erected giant monuments to themselves to impress future generations and its priests advised the slaves to &quot;look forward to an afterlife.&quot; Golden used Hamilton&#x27;s research to contrast these differences with the Greeks, especially the Athenians. Hamilton argued that individual &quot;perfection of mind and body&quot; dominated Greek thought and as a result, the Greeks &quot;excelled at philosophy and sports&quot; and that life &quot;in all its exuberant potential&quot; was the hallmark of Greek civilization.

;&quot;The Roman Way&quot;
&quot;The Roman Way&quot; (1932), her second book, provided similar contrasts between ancient Rome and present-day life. It was also a Book-of-the-Month Club selection in 1957. Hamilton described life as it existed according to ancient Roman poets such as Plautus, Virgil and Juvenal, interpreted Roman thought and manners, and compared them to people&#x27;s lives in the twentieth century. She also suggested how Roman ideas applied to the modern world.

Although her books were successful and popular among readers, she conceded &quot;that it was hopeless to persuade Americans to be Greeks&quot; and that &quot;life had become far too complex since the age of Pericles to recapture the simple directness of Greek life ... the calm lucidity of the Greek mind, which convinced the great thinkers of Athens of their mastery of truth and enlightenment.&quot;

;&quot;The Prophets of Israel&quot;
Her books later covered other areas of interest, especially from the Bible. In 1936, Hamilton wrote &quot;The Prophets of Israel&quot; (Norton, 1936), which interpreted the beliefs of the &quot;spokesmen for God&quot; in the Old Testament. With no knowledge of the Hebrew language, she relied on English language versions of the Bible to similarly compare the achievements and personal lives of the prophets with those of twentieth-century readers. She concludes that the prophets were practical and their political views reflected their time, but their ideals were modern.

Hamilton also summarized the importance of that connection to people in modern times: &quot;Love and grief and joy remain the same forever beautiful&quot; and &quot;poetic truth is always true&quot; as are truths of the spirit. &quot;The prophets understand them as no men have more, and in their pages we can find ourselves. Our aspirations are there, our desires for humanity.&quot; American historian Bruce Catton noted the prophets, whose &quot;religion was an affair of the workaday world,&quot; and their messages that Hamilton described in her &quot;excellent book&quot; are still as relevant today. A subsequent edition of the book, &quot;Spokesmen for God: The Great Teachers of the Old Testament&quot; (Norton, 1949), supplied additional commentary on the first five books of the Old Testament. Christian Science historian Robert Peel described it as &quot;a work of sheer delight.&quot;
;&quot;Mythology&quot;
John Mason Brown, American drama critic, praised Hamilton&#x27;s &quot;The Greek Way&quot;, placing it at the top among modern-day written about ancient Greece,&quot; and &quot;Mythology&quot; as &quot;incomparably superior to Thomas Bulfinch&#x27;s work on the subject. Hamilton&#x27;s &quot;Mythology&quot; (1942), recounts the stories of classical mythology and ancient fables. She used an approach to mythology that was entirely through the literature of the classics. (She had not traveled to Greece until 1929 and was not an archaeologist.) The book received favorable reviews, was another Book-of-the-Month Club selection, and had sold more than four and a half million copies by 1957.

;Later works
In 1942, after moving to Washington, D.C., Hamilton continued to write. At the age of eighty-two she offered new perspectives on the New Testament in &quot;Witness to the Truth: Christ and His Interpreters&quot; (1948) and produced a sequel to &quot;The Greek Way&quot;, titled &quot;The Echo of Greece&quot; (1957). The sequel to her first book discusses the political ideas of such teachers and leaders as Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Demosthenes, and Alexander the Great.

Hamilton continued traveling and lecturing in her eighties, and wrote articles, reviews, and translations of Greek plays, including &quot;The Trojan Women,&quot; &quot;Prometheus Bound,&quot; and &quot;Agamemnon.&quot; She also edited, with Huntington Cairns, &quot;The Collected Dialogues of Plato&quot; (1961).

==Companion Doris Reid==
Doris Fielding Reid (1895–1973) was an American stockbroker. She was the daughter of Harry Fielding Reid, an American geophysicist, and Edith Gittings Reid, biographer of Doctor William Osler and President Woodrow Wilson. She was a student of Edith Hamilton. Reid was employed by Loomis, Sayles and Company beginning in 1929. Reid and Hamilton became lifelong companions. They lived together in Gramercy Park, Manhattan and Sea Wall, Maine, during which time they raised and home-schooled Reid&#x27;s nephew, Francis Dorian Fielding Reid (1917–2008). After Hamilton&#x27;s death, Reid published the book &quot;Edith Hamilton: An Intimate Portrait&quot; (1967). Reid died on January 15, 1973, in Manhattan. Both women are buried at Cove Cemetery in Hadlyme, Connecticut.

==Later years==
Hamilton and Doris Reid remained in New York City until 1943, then moved to Washington, D.C., and spent their summers in Maine. In Washington, Reid was in charge of the local offices of Loomis, Sayles and Company, an investment firm that had been her employer since 1929; Hamilton continued to write and frequently entertained friends, fellow writers, government representatives, and other dignitaries at her home. Among the eminent and famous were Isak Dinesen, Robert Frost, Harvard classicist Werner Jaeger and labor leader John L. Lewis.

After her move to Washington, Hamilton became a commentator on education projects and began to receive honors for her work. Hamilton also recorded programs for television programs and Voice of America, traveled to Europe, and continued to write books, articles, essays, and book reviews.
Hamilton considered the high point of her life to be a trip to Greece at age 90 in 1957, where, in Athens, she saw her translation of Aeschylus&#x27;s &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot; performed at the ancient Odeon theater of Herodes Atticus. As part of the evening&#x27;s ceremonies, King Paul of Greece awarded the Golden Cross of the Order of Benefaction—one of Greece&#x27;s highest honors—to her. The mayor of Athens made her an honorary citizen of the city. The US news media, including &quot;Time&quot; magazine, covered the event. An article in &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; described the event in Hamilton&#x27;s honor: floodlights illuminated the Parthenon, the Temple of Zeus and, for the first time in history, the Stoa. Hamilton called the ceremony &quot;the proudest moment of my life.&quot;

==Modern influences==
Many of the facts in &quot;The Greek Way&quot; (1930) have surprised modern readers. One reviewer in Australia explained Hamilton&#x27;s view &quot;that the spirit of our age is a Greek discovery, and that the Greeks were really the first Westerners, and the first intellectualists.&quot; The same reviewer also credited the book with noting that modern concepts of play and sport were actually common activities to the Greeks, who engaged in exercise and athletic events, including games, races, and music, dancing, and wrestling competitions, among others.

Among those whose lives were influenced by Hamilton&#x27;s writings was U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy. In the months after his brother, President John F. Kennedy, was assassinated, Robert was consumed with grief. Former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy gave him a copy of &quot;The Greek Way,&quot; which she felt was certain to help him. Political commentator David Brooks reported that Hamilton&#x27;s essays helped him better understand and then recover from his brother&#x27;s tragic death. Hamilton&#x27;s writings remained important to him over time, as Brooks explains, and changed Kennedy&#x27;s life. &quot;He carried his beaten, underlined and annotated copy around with him for years, reading sections aloud to audiences in a flat, unrhythmic voice with a mournful edge&quot; and could recite from memory various passages of Aeschylus that Hamilton had translated.

According to reviewers, Hamilton&#x27;s &quot;The Prophets of Israel&quot; (1936) had similarities to her earlier books about Greeks and Romans by making the prophets&#x27; messages relevant to contemporary readers. She accomplishes this, according to one writer, by showing that &quot;behind all great thought stands an individual mind, fired by passion and possessed of an eye that sees deeply into humanity.&quot; The views of the prophets, it adds, are very similar to those in modern times: &quot;The prophets were forerunners of three genuinely American movementshumanism, pragmatism and the philosophy of common sense.&quot;

==Death==
Hamilton died in Washington, D.C. on May 31, 1963, at the age of nearly 96. Four years after her death, Doris Fielding Reid published &quot;Edith Hamilton: An Intimate Portrait.&quot; 

Reid died on January 15, 1973. Both women are buried at Cove Cemetery in Hadlyme, Connecticut, where Hamilton&#x27;s sisters had retired, in the same cemetery as Hamilton&#x27;s mother (Gertrude), sisters (Alice, Norah, and Margaret), and Margaret&#x27;s life partner, Clara Landsberg. Hamilton&#x27;s adopted son, Dorian, who had earned a degree in chemistry at Amherst College, died at West Lafayette, Indiana, in January 2008, aged 90.

==Legacy==
Hamilton was long recognized as a great classicist of her era. Her best-selling books were especially noteworthy for their accessibility to a wide readership and for &quot;representing the Greeks in particular as a prestigious source of cultural inspiration for American society during the decade before and the two decades after World War II.&quot;

Although Hamilton&#x27;s reputation as an author is closely tied to her writings about Greece, much of her professional life focused on Latin. Hamilton &quot;claimed special expertise in Greek,&quot; but after her graduation from Bryn Mawr College, where she majored in Greek and Latin, she spent another year at the college as a fellow in Latin and another year studying Latin in Germany. Hamilton also taught Latin to girls in the senior class during her 26-year career at Bryn Mawr School in Baltimore. However, with the exception of &quot;The Roman Way&quot;, Hamilton&#x27;s written works primarily focused on fourth and fifth century BC Athens. Hamilton&#x27;s correspondence and papers are held at the Schlesinger Library at Radcliffe College.

==Honors and recognition==
In 1906 Hamilton became the first headmistress of the Bryn Mawr School in Baltimore, Maryland.

In 1950 Hamilton received an honorary degrees of Doctor of Letters from the University of Rochester and the University of Pennsylvania. She was also the recipient of an honorary degree from Yale University in 1960. In addition, Hamilton was elected to the American Institute of Arts and Letters in 1955 and the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1957.

Hamilton received the National Achievement Award in 1951 as a distinguished classical scholar and author. She received the award along with Anna M. Rosenberg, Assistant Secretary of Defense. The award was created in 1930 to honor women of accomplishment and inspire others.

Hamilton was awarded the Golden Cross of the Order of Benefaction, Greece&#x27;s highest honor, and became an honorary citizen of the city in 1957.

In 1957 and 1958 she was interviewed by NBC television, and in 1957 &quot;The Greek Way&quot; and &quot;The Roman Way&quot; were selected by the Book of the Month Club as summer readings. John F. Kennedy invited her to his inauguration, which she declined. He also sent an emissary to her home asking for advice about a new cultural center.

In 1958 the Women&#x27;s National Book Association awarded her for her contribution to American culture through books. George V. Allen, director of the United States Information Agency (USIA) and one of the speakers at the award ceremony, remarked that her interpretation of the democratic spirit of ancient Greece, defined &quot;the fundamental of the democratic ideal itself.&quot; He also noted that USIA included seven of her books in its overseas libraries in order to help people of other countries interpret American ideals.

She is the subject of a biography by Doris Fielding Reid, &quot;Edith Hamilton: An Intimate Portrait&quot;.

Robert F. Kennedy quoted from Hamilton&#x27;s translated works, &quot;in what is perhaps his most memorable speech&quot;, during a campaign rally on April 4, 1968, in Indianapolis, Indiana, as the news of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. spread. Kennedy quoted from memory several lines from Hamilton&#x27;s translation of Aeschylus&#x27;s tragedy, &quot;Agamemnon&quot;, telling the grief-stricken crowd: &quot;In our sleep, pain which cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart until, in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom through the awful grace of God.&quot; Kennedy also incorporated another line from Hamilton&#x27;s writing, &quot;her representation of an ancient Greek inscription&quot; in his closing remarks to the crowd: &quot;Let us dedicate ourselves to what the Greeks wrote so many years ago––to tame the savageness of man and make gentle the life of this world.&quot; According to classicist Joseph Casazza, that line about &quot;taming the savageness of man&quot; was created by Hamilton herself and has no direct relation to a single ancient text. Based on his research, Casazza believes that the phrase is a combination of a line from a 125 B.C. decree about Athens by Delphi and another line from &quot;On the Character of Thucydides&quot; by Dionysius of Halicarnassus.

In 2000 the city of Fort Wayne, Indiana, erected statues of two Hamilton sisters, Edith and Alice, along with their cousin, Agnes, in the city&#x27;s Headwaters Park.

<text>Olivier Jean Marie Fernand Gendebien (; 12 January 1924 – 2 October 1998) was a Belgian racing driver, who competed in Formula One from to . Widely regarded as one of the greatest drivers in the history of sportscar racing, Gendebien was a four-time winner of the 24 Hours of Le Mans with Ferrari, a three-time winner of the 12 Hours of Sebring, and a three-time winner of the Targa Florio. 

Born and raised in Brussels, Gendebien was initially a forester in the Belgian Congo before moving back to Europe in 1952, where he began his career in rallying. He won his first event driving an Alfa Romeo 1900 TI at the Tulip Rally in 1954. Gendebien added to his successes by winning the Liège–Rome–Liège Rally, Dolomites Gold Cup Race and Rally Stella Alpina in 1955, driving a Mercedes-Benz 300 SL. Attracting the attention of Enzo Ferrari, Gendebien signed for Ferrari in to compete in Formula One and sportscars, making his debut in the former at the .

Gendebien was appointed to the Order of the Crown of Belgium by Albert II in 1998.

==Rally racer==
Gendebien spent some years in the Belgian Congo. On his return to Europe he teamed up with Fraikin to compete in the 1952 Liège–Rome–Liège Rally using a Jaguar Mk VII saloon car. Together with Pierre Stasse, Gendebien won the sixth running of the Tulip Rally in Zandvoort in April 1954. Their car was an Alfa Romeo 1900 TI. The Gendebien and Fraiken partnership gained the nickname &quot;the eternal bridesmaids&quot;, owing to their number of second-place finishes, but after two previous attempts they triumphed in the Liège–Rome–Liège Rally, the Coppa d&#x27;Oro delle Dolomiti and Rally Stella Alpina in 1955, driving a Mercedes-Benz 300SL. In 1956 Olivier Gendebien and Pierre Stasse finished in third place driving a Ferrari 250 GT Europa (Nr 0373).

==Formula One driver==
Gendebien&#x27;s success in rally competitions brought him to the attention of Enzo Ferrari, who offered him a contract to drive a Ferrari in sports car events and selected Grands Prix. Much respected as a true gentleman by everyone who knew him, he remained a member of the Ferrari team until he retired from racing. Enzo Ferrari summed him up as &quot;&quot;a gentleman who never forgets that noblesse oblige and, when he is at the wheel, he translates this code of behaviour into an elegant and discerning forcefulness&quot;.&quot;

During his career he competed in only 15 Formula One races as most of the time he was Ferrari&#x27;s spare driver, filling in only occasionally. He nonetheless scored points in five races, and was only one place away from a points-scoring finish on a further two occasions.

He made his début at the 1956 Argentine Grand Prix, with the Ferrari team, but it was during a stint driving for the British Racing Partnership&#x27;s &quot;Yeoman Credit Racing&quot; team in that Gendebien scored his best finishes; he took second in the 1960 French Grand Prix and third in front of a home crowd at the 1960 Belgian Grand Prix.

The second of these was a somewhat bitter-sweet success, as Gendebien&#x27;s team-mate at the time, Chris Bristow, was killed in an accident during the race. Gendebien himself walked away with slight injuries in October 1961 after his Lotus-Climax failed to negotiate a turn during practice for the 1961 United States Grand Prix at Watkins Glen, New York. The car flipped over and Gendebien&#x27;s shoes were torn off by the impact.

==Sports car competition==
However, it was in sports car racing, particularly the long distance and endurance events, where Gendebien excelled. Piloting a 2.5-litre Ferrari, Gendebien teamed up with Maurice Trintignant to place third in the 1956 24 Hours of Le Mans. They were seven laps behind the winners, privateer Ecurie Ecosse Jaguar drivers Ron Flockhart and Ninian Sanderson. The 1958 Grand Prix of Buenos Aires was a 1,000 kilometre event in which Gendebien paired with Wolfgang von Trips. They finished second to a fellow Ferrari pairing Phil Hill and Peter Collins. In the race Argentine Maserati driver, Jorge Magnasco, died after his car skidded and turned over.

The same year he partnered Hill and won the prestigious 24 Hours of Le Mans. Their victory came in a 3-litre Ferrari and secured the World Sportscar Championship for the Ferrari factory. They covered 2,511 miles with an average speed of 107 miles per hour. Hill became the first American to win the event and their Ferrari was the sole factory-sponsored car running at the end. Ferrari drivers took the first three positions at the conclusion of the 1961 24 Hours of Le Mans and, as they were to be again the following year, Hill and Gendebien were first, averaging 115.89 miles per hour, and establishing a race record. The duo were a natural fit and together they won the Le Mans race three times in total, with Gendebien winning it a fourth time, partnered by fellow Belgian Paul Frère in . Gendebien&#x27;s record number of Le Mans victories was not exceeded until , when fellow-Belgian Jacky Ickx won for the fifth time.

Away from Circuit de la Sarthe, Gendebien also triumphed in the Targa Florio (1958, &#x27;61, &#x27;62), the 12 Hours of Sebring (1959, &#x27;60, &#x27;61), the 12 Hours of Reims (1957, &#x27;58) and the 1000 km Nürburgring (1962). When asked about the key to winning as a race car driver, Gendebien responded: &quot;It is a matter of taking the corners a little faster than one would want.&quot; In honour of Gendebien&#x27;s three wins at the 12 Hours of Sebring, turn 15 just before the final corner, onto the Ullman straight is named after him. He also won the Dolomites Cup, a one-lap sportscar race that took place on a 188-mile circuit in the Dolomite Mountains in Italy.

==Post race life==
Married with three children, Gendebien&#x27;s wife pressured him to get out of the dangerous sport of automobile racing where more than two dozen of his competitors had died at the wheel. At 38 years of age, in 1962 Olivier Gendebien retired following his fourth victory at Le Mans. Independently wealthy, and an avid skier, tennis player, and equestrian rider, he devoted the rest of his life to running a variety of businesses. In 1998 King Albert II awarded him the Belgian Order of the Crown.

Olivier Gendebien died in 1998 at his home in Les Baux-de-Provence in southern France.

<text>A crag (sometimes spelled cragg, or in Scotland craig) is a rocky hill or mountain, generally isolated from other high ground. 

== Origin ==
Crags are formed when a glacier or ice sheet passes over an area that contains a particularly resistant rock formation (often granite, a volcanic plug or some other volcanic structure). The force of the glacier erodes the surrounding softer material, leaving the rocky block protruding from the surrounding terrain. Frequently the crag serves as a partial shelter to softer material in the wake of the glacier, which remains as a gradual fan or ridge forming a tapered ramp (called the tail) up the leeward side of the crag.

In older examples, or those latterly surrounded by the sea, the tail is often missing, having been removed by post-glacial erosion.

== Examples ==
Examples of crag and tail formations include:
* Castle Rock (the crag, site of Edinburgh Castle) and the Royal Mile (the tail), in Edinburgh, Scotland
* Salisbury Crags and Arthur&#x27;s Seat, in Edinburgh
* North Berwick Law, in North Berwick, Scotland
* Three in or near Stirling, Scotland, including the rock on which Stirling Castle stands
* &quot;Scrabo Hill&quot; in Newtownards, Northern Ireland, site of the Scrabo Tower
* Ailsa Craig, famous for curling stone mining
* Crag and tail features have been identified on the Amundsen Sea continental shelf off West Antarctica.

<text>Arkansas is a state in the Southern United States. According to the 2020 United States census, it is the 33rd most populous state with inhabitants and the 27th largest by land area spanning of land.
Arkansas is divided into 75 counties and contains 500 municipalities consisting of cities and towns as of the 2020 United States census.

Arkansas municipalities are divided into three categories based on population. Cities of the first class have or have had a population over 2,500, cities of the second class have between 500 and 2,499 people, and incorporated towns have 499 or fewer people; state law, however, provides mechanisms for a municipality to increase or decrease its classification despite not meeting the usual population requirement. Several classes of municipalities in Arkansas have different obligations, with incorporated towns often having less.

The largest municipality by population is the state capital of Little Rock with 202,591 residents while the smallest by population is Victoria with 20 residents. The largest municipality by land area is Little Rock, which spans , while the smallest is Oakhaven at .

==Classification of municipalities==
Arkansas municipalities are divided into three categories based on population according to the laws in the 2020 Arkansas Code Title 14. The state does not use villages or civil townships as possible designations for its minor civil divisions.

===City (first class)===
Cities of the first class have a population over 2,500 and elect two council members per ward (elected at-large or by ward, or both). Any municipal expense over $20,000 goes to bidding by default in cities of the first class only. Only cities of the first class must hold elections for vacant mayoralty lasting more than one year, and must elect a city attorney to a four-year term. Cities of the first class must have a city clerk and may have a treasurer elected for a four-year term (or the role combined with city clerk). Cities of the first class must create a planning commission with at least five members and may have a police department superintended by a mayor. There are retirement benefits available if certain conditions are met for mayors and city clerks or treasurers.

===City (second class)===
Cities of the second class have a population between 500 and 2,499 people and elect two council members per ward (elected at-large or by ward, or both). A city of the second class must have a recorder and may have a treasurer elected for a four-year term (or the role combined with city clerk). Cities of the second class do not need to create a separate planning commission and may allow city councilors to serve as the planning commission. Cities of the second class may have a police department, a marshal or a department of public safety. There are retirement benefits available if certain conditions are met for mayors and city clerks or treasurers.

===Town===
Towns have a population of 499 or fewer people and elect five council members at-large with no wards. Towns must have a treasurer-recorder as a single position. Towns may have a police department, a marshal or a department of public safety. No prescribed retirement benefits are available for mayors and clerks or treasurers of towns.

<doc id="342243" wikidata="Q334111" url="?curid=342243" title="Sunjong of Korea">
<text>Sunjong (; 25 March 1874 – 24 April 1926), personal name Yi Cheok (), also known as the Yunghui Emperor (), was the last Korean monarch. He ruled from 1907 to 1910 as the second and last emperor of the Korean Empire. Sunjong was elevated to the throne after his predecessor and father, Gojong, was forced to abdicate by the Empire of Japan. Hence, Sunjong has been characterized by historians as being a powerless puppet ruler of the Japanese, reigning for just three years before Korea was officially annexed in 1910.

==Biography==

=== Crown Prince of Korea ===
Sunjong was the second son of Emperor Gojong and Empress Myeongseong. When he turned two years old in 1876, Sunjong was proclaimed the Crown Prince of Joseon. He was intellectually disabled and described as &quot;mentally retarded&quot;. In 1882, he married a woman of the Yeoheung Min clan (later Empress Sunmyeonghyo). She died at the age of 31 on 5 November 1904 due to a severe depression, after trying to protect her mother-in-law (Empress Myeongseong, also a member of the Yeoheung Min clan) from her assassination on 8 October 1895 by the Japanese military.

When his father proclaimed Korea as an Empire in 1897, Sunjong was appointed as the Crown Prince of Imperial Korea on 12 October 1897. On 29 June 1898, he was appointed as the Field Marshal of the Imperial Korean Army. Sunjong remarried again 3 years later to the daughter of Yoon Taek-young, Yun Jeung-sun of the Haepyeong Yun clan, who was 20 years younger than him, on 11 December 1906, and she became Crown Princess Consort Yun (later Empress Sunjeong).

=== Emperor of Korea ===
On 19 July 1907, Gojong was deposed as a result of Japanese coercion, and Sunjong was made the Emperor of Korea. His coronation was proceeded in Don-doek-jeon. He was proclaimed heir to the throne of Prince Imperial Yeong, the younger half-brother of Sunjong, and moved from Deoksugung Palace to the imperial residence at Changdeokgung Palace.

Sunjong&#x27;s reign was limited by the gradually increasing armed intervention of the Japanese government in Korea. In July 1907, he was proclaimed emperor of Korea but was immediately forced to enter into the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1907. This treaty allowed the Japanese government to supervise and intervene in the administration and governance of Korea, which also allowed for the appointment of Japanese ministers within the government.

While under Japanese supervision, the Korean army was dismissed on the pretext of a lack of public finance regulations. In 1909, Japan implemented the , which effectively removed Korea&#x27;s judicial power. Meanwhile, Japan dispatched Itō Hirobumi, Japanese Resident-General of Korea, to negotiate with Russia over problems involving Korea and Manchuria. However, Itō was assassinated by Ahn Jung-geun at Harbin, which led to the Japanese annexation of Korea in 1910. Pro-Japanese politicians, such as Song Byung-jun and Lee Wan-yong, defected, merging Korea with Japan by fabricating Korea&#x27;s willingness and establishing the Japan–Korea Annexation Treaty on 29 August 1910.

Although still existent &quot;de jure&quot;, the intervention by the Japanese government effectively ended Sunjong&#x27;s reign over the Korean Empire &quot;de facto&quot; and he became essentially powerless within three years of ruling. Japan, in effect, officially abolished the Korean Empire on 29 August 1910, ending 519 years of the Joseon dynasty.

===Post-abdication===

After the annexation treaty, the former Emperor Sunjong and his wife, Empress Sunjeong, lived the rest of their lives virtually imprisoned in Changdeokgung Palace (in present-day Seoul). Sunjong could not exercise any power as emperor because there were only pro-Japanese politicians in the government. After the Korean Empire collapsed, Sunjong was demoted from emperor to king. Japan allowed him the title of &quot;King Yi of Changdeok Palace&quot; () and allowed for the title to be inherited.

Sunjong died on 24 April 1926, in Changdeokgung and is buried with his two wives at the imperial tomb of Yureung () in the city of Namyangju. His state funeral on 10 June 1926, was a catalyst for the June 10th Movement against Japanese rule; He had no children.

<text>Samantha Brown (born 7 October 1964) is an English singer, songwriter and musician.

Brown is a blue-eyed soul and jazz singer, and ukulele and piano player. She came to prominence in the late 1980s as a solo artist and released eight singles that entered the UK Singles Chart during the 1980s and 1990s. Her solo singles, sometimes dealing with lost love, include &quot;Stop!&quot;, &quot;This Feeling&quot;, &quot;Can I Get a Witness&quot;, &quot;Kissing Gate&quot;, &quot;With a Little Love&quot; and &quot;Just Good Friends&quot;. She worked as a session backing vocalist, working with artists such as Gary Moore, George Harrison, Small Faces, Spandau Ballet, Adam Ant, Jon Lord (of Deep Purple), Pink Floyd, David Gilmour, The Firm, Dodgy and Nick Cave.

Brown released her debut album &quot;Stop!&quot; in 1988 and in total has released seven studio albums, one live album, one EP, and three compilation albums, as well as three albums as part of the group Homespun. She developed serious problems with her singing voice in 2007 after which she stopped recording and singing live until 2023 when she released the album &quot;Number 8&quot;.

==Early years==
Samantha Brown was born on 7 October 1964, in Stratford, east London, England. She is the daughter of musician Joe Brown and session singer Vicki Brown. Brown&#x27;s first work in the music industry was in 1978 aged 14, when she sang backing vocals on the final studio album by the Small Faces, &quot;78 in the Shade&quot;. She also worked as a backing vocalist with several other bands, including Spandau Ballet, and with her mother on former Deep Purple keyboardist Jon Lord&#x27;s third solo album &quot;Before I Forget&quot;.

==Career==
Brown signed a recording contract with A&amp;M in 1986. Her most successful song with A&amp;M was &quot;Stop!&quot;, released as a single in 1988. She issued an album of the same name that same year. Other singles taken from the album included &quot;Walking Back to Me&quot;, &quot;This Feeling&quot; and her cover version of &quot;Can I Get a Witness&quot;. The album &quot;Stop!&quot; has sold over two-and-a-half million copies worldwide, doing particularly well in the UK and Australia. Brown&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;April Moon&quot; (1990), included two hit singles, &quot;Kissing Gate&quot; and &quot;With a Little Love&quot;. Three further singles were released from the album: &quot;Mindworks&quot;, &quot;Once in Your Life&quot; and &quot;As One&quot;.

Brown&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;43 Minutes...&quot;, was made around the same time that her mother was dying from breast cancer. A&amp;M, Brown&#x27;s record label at the time, were not satisfied with the album and wanted some potential hit singles recorded and added to the track listing. Brown, unwilling to compromise and after a protracted legal battle, bought back the master recordings of the album and released them in 1992 on her own label Pod Music, a year after the death of her mother. Few copies were initially released, but it was reissued in 2004.

Brown provided backing vocals for Pink Floyd on their 14th studio album, &quot;The Division Bell&quot;, released in 1994, and accompanied them on their tour to promote the release. Her involvement was documented on the following year&#x27;s Pink Floyd release, &quot;Pulse&quot;, in which she sang backing vocals and was the first lead vocalist on the song &quot;The Great Gig in the Sky&quot;. In 1995, she had a minor chart hit with a duet with fellow singer-songwriter Fish, entitled &quot;Just Good Friends&quot;. In 1997, Brown returned with her fourth studio album &quot;Box&quot;, released via the independent record label Demon Music Group. Tracks on this album included &quot;Embrace the Darkness&quot;, &quot;Whisper&quot; and &quot;I Forgive You&quot; which was co-written with Maria McKee. McKee&#x27;s version of the song originally appeared on her second album, &quot;You Gotta Sin to Get Saved&quot;.

In 2000, her fifth studio album, &quot;ReBoot&quot;, was released via another independent label, Mud Hut, as was the single &quot;In Light of All That&#x27;s Gone Before.&quot; In 2003, Brown formed the band Homespun with Dave Rotheray. The group has released three albums. Brown also released several solo recordings in this period, including an EP, &quot;Ukulele and Voice&quot;. In 2004, Jon Lord released &quot;Beyond the Notes&quot;, for which she wrote almost all the lyrics. In late 2006, she undertook an extensive UK tour as special guest of her father, Joe Brown. The shows also included appearances by her brother, Pete Brown.

In 2007, seven years after her last album, Brown released &quot;Of the Moment&quot;. She also returned to the Top 10 of the UK Albums Chart in October 2007, when &quot;Valentine Moon&quot; was included on Jools Holland&#x27;s hit album &quot;Best of Friends&quot;.

That same year she developed problems with her singing voice, and for unknown reasons has not been able to sing consistently since. In an interview in 2013 she explained that &quot;I can&#x27;t get vocal cord closure and achieve the proper pitch simultaneously. It feels like there are some muscles that aren&#x27;t working.&quot; After a cyst was found on her vocal cords, she had the cyst successfully removed, but problems with her voice persisted, leaving her unable to hold a note.

Seeking alternative musical occupation, Brown started a ukulele club in 2010 and expanded to several clubs in Oxfordshire, Dorset, London and online which have continued to thrive.

In 2021 she released her only live album, &quot;Wednesday The Something of April&quot;, a recording of a one-woman show from 2004 featuring songs from across her career.
Brown&#x27;s first studio album in fifteen years, &quot;Number 8&quot;, was released in January 2023. It was written and recorded with long-time collaborator Danny Schogger and makes use of Melodyne software to help Brown&#x27;s vocals.

=== Backing and guest vocalist ===
As well as her solo career, Brown has had a successful career as a backing vocalist and collaborator with other artists. She has worked with the band Barclay James Harvest (1984), David Gilmour (&quot;David Gilmour in Concert&quot;) and Pink Floyd, Deep Purple (&quot;In Concert with The London Symphony Orchestra&quot;), Jon Lord, The Firm, Gary Moore, George Harrison and Nick Cave. She has often appeared as a member of Jools Holland&#x27;s Rhythm and Blues Orchestra and achieved further prominence with her 2002 performance at the Concert for George, which was a memorial to George Harrison on the first anniversary of his death, where she sang &quot;Horse to the Water&quot;. This song is included in the film of the concert and in the 2018 digital album release, but not on the original 2003 album. In 2002, she was a backing vocalist at Buckingham Palace at the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II&#x27;s concert, Party at the Palace.

In 2015, Brown started teaching backing vocals classes at the Academy of Contemporary Music (ACM) in Guildford, Surrey, a school for rock and pop musicians.

==Personal life==
Brown has two children, born 1993 and 1995, with her ex-husband, producer and musician Robin Evans.

On 16 June 1991, Brown&#x27;s mother Vicki Brown died aged 50 from breast cancer.

==Album titles==

Taken in order of release, the initial letters of the titles of Brown&#x27;s seven solo studio albums and one live album spell out her name:

* &quot;Stop!&quot;
* &quot;April Moon&quot;
* &quot;(43) Minutes...&quot;
* &quot;Box&quot;
* &quot;ReBoot&quot;
* &quot;Of the Moment&quot;
* &quot;Wednesday the Something of April&quot;
* &quot;Number 8&quot;

Brown said that she was unaware of the pattern until it was pointed out after the release of &quot;ReBoot&quot; in 2000. Once it was brought to her attention she vowed to continue the trend, asking fans to submit suggestions for the next title beginning with &#x27;O&#x27;. &quot;Of the Moment&quot; was released in September 2007: its title was suggested by a fan via Brown&#x27;s website.

<doc id="342248" wikidata="Q1123697" url="?curid=342248" title="Jebusites">
<text>The Jebusites (; ) were, according to the books of Joshua and Samuel from the Hebrew Bible, a Canaanite tribe that inhabited Jerusalem, called Jebus () before the conquest initiated by Joshua (, ) and completed by King David (), although a majority of scholars agree that the Book of Joshua holds little historical value for early Israel and most likely reflects a much later period. states that Jerusalem was known as Jebus before this event. The identification of Jebus with Jerusalem is sometimes disputed by scholars. According to some biblical chronologies, the city was conquered by King David in 1003 BC.

==Identification of Jebus==
The identification of Jebus with Jerusalem has been disputed, principally by Niels Peter Lemche. Supporting his case, every non-biblical mention of Jerusalem found in the ancient Near East refers to the city as &quot;Jerusalem&quot;. An example of these records are the Amarna letters, several of which were written by the chieftain of Jerusalem Abdi-Heba and call Jerusalem either () or () (1330s BC). Also in the Amarna letters, it is called Beth-Shalem, the house of Shalem.

The Sumero-Akkadian name for Jerusalem, &quot;uru-salim&quot;, is variously etymologised to mean &quot;foundation of [or: by] the god Shalim&quot;: from Semitic &quot;yry,&quot; &quot;to found, to lay a cornerstone&quot;, and Shalim, the Canaanite god of the setting sun and the nether world, as well as of health and perfection.

Lemche states:
There is no evidence of Jebus and the Jebusites outside of the Old Testament. Some scholars reckon Jebus to be a different place from Jerusalem; other scholars prefer to see the name of Jebus as a kind of pseudo-ethnic name.

Theophilus G. Pinches has noted a reference to &quot;Yabusu&quot;, which he interprets as an old form of Jebus, on a contract tablet that dates from 2200 BC.

==Ethnic origin==
The Hebrew Bible contains the only surviving ancient text known to use the term &quot;Jebusite&quot; to describe the inhabitants of Jerusalem; according to the Generations of Noah (), the Jebusites are identified as Canaanites, listed in third place among the Canaanite groups between the biblical Hittites and the Amorites.

Before modern archaeological studies, most biblical scholars held the opinion that the Jebusites were identical to the Hittites, which continues to be the case, though less so. However, an increasingly popular view, first put forward by Edward Lipiński, professor of Oriental and Slavonic studies at KU Leuven, is that the Jebusites were most likely an Amorite tribe; Lipiński identifies them with the group referred to as &quot;Yabusi&#x27;um&quot; in a cuneiform letter found in the archive of Mari, Syria. Lipinski also suggests that more than one clan or tribe bore similar names and thus the Jebusites and Yabusi&#x27;um may have been separate people altogether.

In the Amarna letters, mention is made that the contemporaneous king of Jerusalem was named &quot;Abdi-Heba&quot;, which is a theophoric name invoking a Hurrian goddess named Ḫepat. This implies that the Jebusites were either Hurrians, were heavily influenced by Hurrian culture, or were dominated by the maryannu (a warrior-class elite). Moreover, the last Jebusite king, Araunah, mentioned in 1 Chronicles 21:15, bore a name generally understood as based on the Hurrian honorific &quot;ewir&quot;.

Richard Hess shows four Hurrian names in the Bible&#x27;s conquest narrative: Piram, king of Jarmuth and Hoham, king of Hebron (), and Sheshai and Talmai, sons of Anak () with Hurrian-based names. Zev Farber believes that the Jebusites were unrecognized Israelites. According to Farber, it explains why the Judahites were confident in delivering the corpse of Adoni-Bezek, a foreign enemy king, to Jebus in Judges 1:7. A similar incident occurred in 1 Samuel 17:54, where David delivers Goliath&#x27;s head to Jebus, which occurs before the city&#x27;s conquest. In addition, the Jebusites are portrayed in a more positive light than the residents of Gibeah in the Levite&#x27;s concubine narrative. Farber believes this was anti-Saul propaganda, with Gibeah being the city of Saul and Jebus being the city of David.

==Biblical narrative==
The Hebrew Bible describes the Jebusites as dwelling in the mountains beside Jerusalem in Numbers 13:29 and Joshua 11:3. In the narration of the burning bush in Exodus 3:18, the &quot;good and large land, flowing with milk and honey&quot; that was promised to Moses as the future home of the oppressed Hebrews included the land of the Jebusites. According to Joshua 10, Adonizedek led a confederation of Jebusites and the tribes from the neighbouring cities of Jarmuth, Lachish, Eglon and Hebron against Joshua but was soundly defeated and killed. However, Joshua 15:63 states the Judahites could not dislodge the Jebusites, who were living in Jerusalem (&quot;to this day the Jebusites live there with the people of Judah&quot;). portrays the Jebusites as continuing to dwell at Jerusalem, within the territory otherwise occupied by the Tribe of Benjamin. 

According to the 2 Samuel, the Jebusites still had control of Jerusalem at the time of King David, but David wished to take control of the city. Understandably the Jebusites contest his attempt to do this, and since Jebus was the strongest fortress in Canaan they gloat that even the &quot;blind and lame&quot; could withstand David&#x27;s siege. According to the version of the story in the Masoretic Text, David manages to conquer the city by a surprise attack, led by Joab, through the water supply tunnels (Jerusalem has no natural water supply except for the Gihon Spring). Ever since its discovery in the 19th century, Warren&#x27;s Shaft, part of a system which connects the spring to the city, has been cited as evidence for the plausibility of such a line of attack. The account in 1 Chronicles 11:5 mentions the advantage of a speedy attack but does not mention use of the water shafts, and according to many textual scholars the claim in the Masoretic Text could simply be a scribal error; the Septuagint version of the passage states that the Israelites had to attack the Jebusites &quot;with their dagger[s]&quot; rather than &quot;through the water shaft&quot;. The First Book of Chronicles states that the inhabitants of Jebus forbade King David from coming to Jerusalem shortly after he was made king. Joab went up first and took the city and became chief and captain of David&#x27;s armed forces. The Books of Kings state that once Jerusalem had become an Israelite city, the surviving Jebusites are forced by Solomon to become serfs.

Another Jebusite, Araunah (referred to as &quot;Ornan&quot; by the Books of Chronicles) is described by the Books of Samuel as having sold his threshing floor to King David, which David then constructed an altar on, the implication being that the altar became the core of the Temple of Solomon. &quot;Araunah&quot; means &quot;the lord&quot; in Hittite, and so most scholars, since they consider the Jebusites to have been Hittite, have argued that Araunah may have been another king of Jerusalem; some scholars additionally believe that Adonijah is actually a disguised reference to Araunah, the ר (&quot;r&quot;) having been corrupted to ד (&quot;d&quot;). The argument originated from Cheyne, who, prior to knowledge of the Hittite language, proposed the reverse. The narrative is considered by some scholars to be aetiological and of dubious historicity.

It is unknown what ultimately became of these &quot;Jebusites&quot;.
According to the &quot;Jebusite hypothesis&quot;, however, the Jebusites persisted as inhabitants of Jerusalem and comprised an important faction in the Kingdom of Judah, including such notables as Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Bathsheba, the queen and mother of the next monarch, Solomon. According to this hypothesis, after the disgrace of a rival Elide faction of priests in the struggle for succession to David, the family of Zadok became the sole authorized Jerusalem clergy, so that a Jebusite family monopolized the Jerusalem clergy for many centuries before becoming sufficiently attenuated to be indistinguishable from other Judeans or Judahites. 

Elsewhere in the Bible, the Jebusites are described in a manner that suggests that they worshipped the same God (El Elyon—Ēl ‘Elyōn) as the Israelites (e.g., Melchizedek). Further support for this theory comes from the fact that other Jebusites resident in pre-Israelite Jerusalem bore names invoking the principle or god Zedek (Tzedek) (e.g., Melchizedek and Adonizedek). Under this theory the Aaronic lineage ascribed to Zadok is a later, anachronistic interpolation. A Jebusite is mentioned in the Acts of Barnabas as accompanying his martyrdom.

==Classical rabbinical perspectives==
According to classical rabbinical literature, the Jebusites derived their name from the city of Jebus, the ancient Jerusalem, which they inhabited. These rabbinical sources also argue that as part of the price of Abraham&#x27;s purchase of the Cave of the Patriarchs (Cave of Machpelah), which lay in the territory of the Jebusites, the Jebusites made Abraham grant them a covenant that his descendants would not take control of Jebus against the will of the Jebusites, and then the Jebusites engraved the covenant into bronze; the sources state that the presence of the bronze statues are why the Israelites were not able to conquer the city during Joshua&#x27;s campaign.

The rabbis of the classical era go on to state that King David was prevented from entering the city of Jebus for the same reason, and so he promised the reward of captaincy to anyone who destroyed the bronzes – Joab performing the task and so gaining the prize. The covenant is dismissed by the rabbis as having been invalidated due to the war the Jebusites fought against Joshua, but nevertheless David (according to the rabbis) paid the Jebusites the full value of the city, collecting the money from among all the Israelite tribes, so that the city became their common property.

In reference to 2 Samuel 5:6, which refers to a saying about the blind and the lame, Rashi quotes a midrash which argues that the Jebusites had two statues in their city, with their mouths containing the words of the covenant between Abraham and the Jebusites; one figure, depicting a blind person, represented Isaac, and the other, depicting a lame person, representing Jacob.

==Modern usage==
The politicians Yasser Arafat and Faisal Husseini, among others, have claimed that Palestinian Arabs are descended from the Jebusites, in an attempt to argue that the Palestinians have a historic claim to Jerusalem that precedes the Jewish one. Professor Eric H. Cline of the George Washington University Anthropology Department asserts that a general consensus exists among historians and archeologists that modern Palestinians are &quot;more closely related to the Arabs of Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Jordan, and other countries&quot; than to the Jebusites, and that they lack any significant connection to them. Johns Hopkins University Professor William F. Albright questioned &quot;the surprising tenacity&quot; of &quot;the myth of the unchanging East&quot; and rejected any assertion of continuity between the &quot;folk beliefs and practices of the modern peasants and nomads&quot; and &quot;pre-Arab times.&quot;

<text>Nangura spinosa, the Nangur spiny skink or Nangur skink, is a lizard known from two patches of dry-rainforest in South East Queensland, Australia. It was formerly placed in the monotypic genus Nangura but was moved to &quot;Concinnia&quot; following the molecular phylogenetic studies of O&#x27;Connor &amp; Moritz (2003) and Skinner and co-authors (2013). It was returned to &quot;Nangura&quot; in 2018. This species is known only from two localities; the type locality, now in Nangura National Park, and a much smaller isolated population in Oakview National Park and adjacent Oakview State Forest. The total distribution spans just 42 square kilometers, within which this species occupies less than 4 square kilometers, with an estimated population size of less than 200 individuals. It is threatened by invasive species including cats, pigs, dogs, foxes and cane toads, by the invasive plant species Lantana camara, which increases fire risk and changes forest structure, and in some sites by logging and road maintenance. Consequently, it is listed as critically endangered under the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 It resembles &quot;Gnypetoscincus queenslandiae&quot; in its spiny scales and like that species it is live bearing. Along with minor differences in scalation, the Nangur spiny skink differs from other Australian Sphenomorphid skinks in its karyotype of 2n=28 chromosomes, where most others have 2n=30. It is also unlike related species in that it lives in burrows, which occur in small colonies through the dry rainforest habitat. There is some indication of parental care in this species, with adults sharing burrows with juveniles.

<text>The Florida sand skink (Plestiodon reynoldsi) is a species of lizard in the family Scincidae, the skinks. It is endemic to Florida in the United States.

==Taxonomy and etymology==
It was described as a new genus and new species by Leonhard Stejneger in 1910 and named in honor of a certain Mr. A.G. Reynolds of Gulfport, Florida, who had collected the holotype.

==Description==

A unique lizard adapted to an underground existence, the Florida sand skink measures in total length and is a gray to tan color. Its forelegs are tiny and bear only one toe each; its hindlegs are small and have two toes. The tail comprises about half of the animal&#x27;s total length. The sand skink has a wedge-shaped head, a partially countersunk lower jaw, body grooves into which the forelegs can be folded, and small eyes which have transparent windows in the lower lids. These features enable the lizard to move through loose sand.

==Diet==
The diet consists of surface-dwelling invertebrates, including termites, spiders, and the larvae of antlions and beetles.

==Reproduction==
Florida sand skinks are most active in spring, during their mating season. They reach sexual maturity after one to two years and remain reproductively active for two to three years. About 55 days after mating, the female lays about two eggs, which hatch in June or July.

==Geographic range==
It only occurs in Central Florida—115 known sites were recorded in 1999. The species is difficult to detect and may be found elsewhere during more intensive searches. It is present on the Lake Wales Ridge, the Winter Haven Ridge in Polk County, and the Mount Dora Ridge.

==Habitat==
The Florida sand skink lives in areas vegetated with sand pine–Florida rosemary scrub and the longleaf pine–American turkey oak association, including Florida scrub habitat. Food supply and moisture levels are important factors in the species&#x27; tolerance of habitat. Florida sand skinks are most frequently found in the ecotone between Florida rosemary scrub and palmetto-pine flatwoods where moisture is present beneath the surface litter and in the sand.

==Behavior==
It usually remains underground and burrows beneath the soil to find food.

==Conservation status==
The Florida sand skink was classified as a threatened species by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service in 1987. As of 2016 it is classified as vulnerable by the IUCN due to ongoing habitat destruction for the purpose of building developments, citrus plantations, phosphate mining, and wildfires.

<text>Carinascincus is a genus of skinks (family Scincidae), commonly called snow skinks or cool-skinks and residing mainly in Tasmania or Victoria, Australia. Then recognised as the genus &quot;Niveoscincus&quot;, it was found to belong to a clade with the genera &quot;Carlia&quot;, &quot;Lampropholis&quot; and others of the &quot;Eugongylus&quot; group within Lygosominae. Cogger has rejected the use of the junior name &quot;Niveoscincus&quot; and recognizes the valid senior generic name &quot;Carinascincus&quot; for the group. For similar skinks see genera &quot;Pseudemoia&quot;, &quot;Lampropholis&quot;, and &quot;Bassiana&quot;. These skinks have adapted to the cooler weather of southern Australia and particularly Tasmania, hence the common names.

==Species==
*&quot;Carinascincus coventryi&quot; – southern forest cool-skink
*&quot;Carinascincus greeni&quot; – alpine cool-skink or northern snow skink
*&quot;Carinascincus metallicus&quot; – metallic skink or metallic cool-skink
*&quot;Carinascincus microlepidotus&quot; – boulder cool-skink or southern snow skink
*&quot;Carinascincus ocellatus&quot; – spotted skink, ocellated cool-skink, or ocellated skink
*&quot;Carinascincus orocryptus&quot; – Tasmanian mountain skink, heath cool-skink, or mountain skink
*&quot;Carinascincus palfreymani&quot; – Pedra Branca skink, Pedra Branca cool-skink, or red-throated skink
*&quot;Carinascincus pretiosus&quot; – Tasmanian tree skink or agile cool-skink

Starting in 1963, he was best known as the game show host and producer of &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot;. He had a conundrum with game theory and psychology aspects named after him: the Monty Hall problem. Behind the scenes, Hall also carried on an active life of philanthropy.

==Early life==

Hall was born as Monte Halparin in Winnipeg, Manitoba, on August 25, 1921, to Orthodox Jewish parents Maurice Harvey Halparin, who owned a slaughterhouse, and Rose (née Rusen). He was raised in Winnipeg&#x27;s north end, where he attended Lord Selkirk School (Elmwood, Winnipeg), and, later St. John&#x27;s High School. Hall graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Manitoba, where he majored in chemistry and zoology. He was sponsored through university by Max Freed, a local businessman who was a customer of his father. Originally though, Hall had hoped to go to medical school but was not admitted due to secret quotas restricting the number of Jewish students admitted.

==Career==
Hall&#x27;s first radio job was working for CKRC radio in Winnipeg while still a student. He briefly worked for the Canadian Wheat Board after graduating before deciding to pursue a full-time career in broadcasting. He moved to Toronto in 1946 and found a job with radio station CHUM, where management shortened his name to Hall and misspelled his first name as &quot;Monty&quot; on billboards, giving him the stage name &quot;Monty Hall&quot;. For the next decade he hosted and produced a number of programs for radio stations in Toronto, as well as &quot;Who Am I?&quot; on CFRB, which was distributed nationally in Canada through private syndication until 1959. He also had several short-lived programmes on CBC Television after it was launched in 1952, but when they were cancelled and another program he had conceived was taken away from him, Hall decided he had no future in Canadian television.

Hall moved to New York City in 1955, attempting to break into American broadcasting, but commuted to Toronto several times a month to record episode blocks of &quot;Who Am I?&quot; In New York, Hall hosted game shows such as &quot;Bingo at Home&quot; on WABD-TV and guest-hosted more established game shows such as &quot;Strike It Rich&quot; on CBS and &quot;Twenty-One&quot; on NBC. On September 15, 1956, Hall began a seven-month stint hosting the Saturday afternoon series &quot;Cowboy Theater,&quot; broadcast nationally on the NBC network. Hall&#x27;s segments were performed live from NBC&#x27;s New York studio, and the films were Columbia Pictures&#x27; 1935-42 westerns starring Charles Starrett.

Hall later hosted the children&#x27;s program &quot;Fun in the Morning&quot; for WNEW-TV (Ch. 5) in the early 1960s. From 1956 to 1960, along with NBC Radio newsman Morgan Beatty, Hall co-hosted the Saturday night segment of the NBC Radio Network weekend program &quot;Monitor&quot; from 8 p.m. until midnight (EST). At least two recordings of Hall on &quot;Monitor&quot; are known to exist.

Hall was a radio analyst for the New York Rangers of the National Hockey League during the 1959–1960 season.

He succeeded Jack Narz as host of a game show called &quot;Video Village&quot;, which ran from 1960 to 1962 on CBS. From 1961 to 1962, Hall hosted its spinoff, &quot;Video Village Junior&quot;, which featured children. After moving to Southern California, Hall became the host of the game show &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot;, which he developed and produced with partner Stefan Hatos. 

&quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; aired on NBC daytime from December 30, 1963, to December 27, 1968, and on ABC daytime from December 30, 1968, until July 9, 1976, along with two prime time runs. It aired in syndication from 1971 to 1977, from 1980 to 1981, from 1984 to 1986, and again on NBC briefly from 1990 to 1991, with Hall replacing Bob Hilton, who had been dismissed. He was the producer or executive producer of the show through most of its runs. During the show&#x27;s initial run, Hall appeared alongside model Carol Merrill and announcer Jay Stewart. In 1969, he guest-starred on season 4, episode 5, of &quot;That Girl&quot;, playing Dr. Pellman, a dentist.

Besides &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal,&quot; the game show &quot;Split Second,&quot; which originally ran on ABC from 1972 to 1975 with Tom Kennedy as host, and again in syndication in 1986 with Hall hosting that version, was the only other successful program from Hatos-Hall Productions. In 1975, he published his autobiography, co-authored with Bill Libby, called &quot;Emcee Monty Hall&quot;. Other game shows from Hatos&#x27; and Hall&#x27;s production company included &quot;Chain Letter&quot; in 1966; a revival of the venerable 1950s-era panel quiz &quot;Masquerade Party&quot; in 1974; &quot;Three for the Money&quot; in 1975; &quot;It&#x27;s Anybody&#x27;s Guess&quot; in 1977, which reunited &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; announcer Jay Stewart with Hall, who also hosted the show; and the Canadian-based &quot;The Joke&#x27;s on Us&quot; in 1983. Hall filled in as guest host on several daytime game shows while &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; was on NBC, most notably &quot;What&#x27;s This Song?&quot; and &quot;PDQ&quot;.

In 1979, Hall hosted the only game show since &quot;Video Village&quot; which he did not produce, Goodson-Todman&#x27;s &quot;All-New Beat the Clock&quot;. Also, in 1979, Hall made an appearance on the game show &quot;Password Plus&quot; as a game show contestant, followed by another week of appearances in August 1980 (just before the launch of the upcoming Canadian-produced &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; revival, which he took the opportunity to plug). He appeared as himself on &quot;The Promise Ring&quot; episode of &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot; in 2001. He played the host of a beauty pageant who schemed to become &quot;the world&#x27;s most powerful game show host&quot; in the Disney animated series &quot;American Dragon: Jake Long&quot;. He appeared on &quot;GSN Live&quot; on March 14, 2008, and hosted a game of &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; for &quot;Good Morning America&quot; on August 18, 2008, as part of Game Show Reunion week.

In summer 2009, CBS announced that it was reviving &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; on its daytime schedule. The show premiered on October 5, 2009, with Wayne Brady as host. Hall was credited as &quot;Creative Consultant&quot; until he died in 2017, and remains credited as co-creator of the format (with Stefan Hatos), as per many international versions of the show, with Hatos/Hall Productions being credited as co-production company (with Fremantle). Hall made appearances in 2010 and 2013 during the Brady run, and had been part of publicity photos in early 2017 to promote season nine.

==Philanthropy==
Hall spent much of his off time involved in philanthropic work. His family says he was always going to telethons and helped raise close to $1 billion for charity in his lifetime. Hall was repeatedly honored for his charitable efforts. Wards at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto and Hahnemann University Hospital in Philadelphia are named in his honor.

Hall, who said that charitable work was the driving force in his life, even went so far as to conceive a television series where he would assist people who were having troubles through various connections he had made through his philanthropic efforts. Partnering with Worldvision Enterprises, Hall&#x27;s series was titled &quot;For the People&quot; and a pilot was shot for the 1986 NATPE convention; he would be devoting himself full-time to the new series, thus stepping down from &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; at the end of the 1985-86 season regardless of whether or not it was renewed for a third season (it would not be). However, the pilot did not receive enough interest in the crowded syndication market at the time and the concept never made it to television.

==Honours==

Hall received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on August 24, 1973, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars in 2000, and in 2002, he was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame.

Hall is one of three game show hosts—along with Alex Trebek and Howie Mandel—on both Hollywood&#x27;s and Canada&#x27;s Walks of Fame. In May 1988, Her Excellency Jeanne Sauvé, Governor General of Canada, appointed him an Officer of the prestigious Order of Canada for his humanitarian work in Canada and other nations of the world. In 2003, His Honour the Honourable Peter Liba, Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba, appointed him a Member of the Order of Manitoba.

He was the recipient of the 2005 Ralph Edwards Service Award from the Game Show Congress, in recognition of all the work the emcee-producer has done for charity through the years. On October 13, 2007, Hall was one of the first inductees into the American TV Game Show Hall of Fame in Las Vegas, Nevada. Hall received the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2013 Daytime Emmy Awards.

==Personal life==
On September 28, 1947, Hall married Marilyn Doreen Plottel (May 17, 1927 – June 5, 2017); the two had been introduced by a mutual cousin, Norman Shnier, the previous year. They later became United States citizens. They had three children: Tony Award–winning actress Joanna Gleason; Sharon Hall Kessler, a former producer and now an executive at Marcus/Glass Entertainment, which acquired Hatos-Hall Productions in 2021, including &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot;, allowing the show to return to family control; and Richard Hall, an Emmy Award–winning television producer. Monty and Marilyn lived in Beverly Hills, California, from 1962 until their deaths; Marilyn died four months before her husband.

===Death===
Hall died from heart failure on September 30, 2017, at his home in Beverly Hills a little over a month after his 96th birthday. He was interred at Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery on October 3.

==Monty Hall Problem==

Hall&#x27;s name is used in a probability puzzle known as the &quot;Monty Hall problem&quot;. The name was conceived by statistician Steve Selvin who used the title in describing a probability problem to &quot;Scientific American&quot; in 1975 based on one of the games on &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot;, and more popularized when it was presented in a weekly national newspaper column by Marilyn vos Savant in 1990.

A host (&quot;Monty&quot;) provides a player with three doors, one containing a valuable prize and the other two containing a &quot;gag&quot;, valueless prize. The contestant is offered a choice of one of the doors without knowledge of the content behind them. &quot;Monty&quot;, who knows which door has the prize, opens a door that the player did not select that has a gag prize, and then offers the player the option to switch from their choice to the other remaining unopened door. The probability problem arises from asking if the player should switch to the unrevealed door.

Mathematically, the problem shows that a player switching to the other door has a chance of winning under standard conditions, but this is a counterintuitive effect of switching one&#x27;s choice of doors, and the problem gained wide attention due to conflicting views following vos Savant&#x27;s publication, with many asserting that the probability of winning had dropped to if one switched. A number of other solutions become possible if the problem setup is outside of the &quot;standard conditions&quot; defined by vos Savant: that the host equally selects one of the two gag prize doors if the player had first picked the winning prize, and the offer to switch is always presented.

Hall explained the solution to that problem in an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot; reporter John Tierney in 1991. In the article, Hall pointed out that because he had control over the way the game progressed, playing on the psychology of the contestant, the theoretical solution did not apply to the show&#x27;s actual gameplay. He said he was not surprised at the experts&#x27; insistence that the probability was 1 out of 2. &quot;That&#x27;s the same assumption contestants would make on the show after I showed them there was nothing behind one door,&quot; he said. &quot;They&#x27;d think the odds on their door had now gone up to 1 in 2, so they hated to give up the door no matter how much money I offered. By opening that door we were applying pressure. We called it the Henry James treatment. It was &#x27;The Turn of the Screw. Hall clarified that as a game show host, he was not required to follow the rules of the puzzle as Marilyn vos Savant often explains in her weekly column in &quot;Parade&quot;, and did not always allow a person the opportunity to switch. For example, he might open their door immediately if it was a losing door, might offer them money to not switch from a losing door to a winning door, or might only allow them the opportunity to switch if they had a winning door. &quot;If the host is required to open a door all the time and offer you a switch, then you should take the switch,&quot; he said. &quot;But if he has the choice whether to allow a switch or not, beware. Caveat emptor. It all depends on his mood.&quot;

A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than &quot;Oligosoma&quot;.

Numerous undescribed species also exist within the genus, including the cobble skink and tātahi skink.

===Merger of &quot;Oligosoma&quot; and &quot;Cyclodina&quot;===
A molecular phylogenetic analysis has merged the genus &quot;Cyclodina&quot; with &quot;Oligosoma,&quot; rendering &quot;Cyclodina&quot; an obsolete taxon.

<text>Paracontias is a genus of skinks, lizards in the family Scincidae. The genus is endemic to Madagascar.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
&quot;Paracontias&quot; is usually placed in the subfamily Scincinae, which seems to be paraphyletic however. Probably quite close to &quot;Amphiglossus&quot; and possibly &quot;Androngo trivittatus&quot;, it belongs to a major clade which does not seem to include the type genus &quot;Scincus&quot;. Thus, it will probably be eventually assigned to a new, yet-to-be-named subfamily. (Austin &amp; Arnold 2006)

==Species==
The following 14 species are recognized as being valid.
*&quot;Paracontias ampijoroensis&quot; 
*&quot;Paracontias brocchii&quot; – stone skink
*&quot;Paracontias fasika&quot;

<doc id="342268" wikidata="Q28233" url="?curid=342268" title="Korean Empire">
<text>The Korean Empire, officially the Empire of Korea or Imperial Korea, was a Korean monarchical state proclaimed in October 1897 by King Gojong of the Joseon dynasty. The empire lasted until Japan&#x27;s annexation of Korea in August 1910.

During this period, Emperor Gojong oversaw the Gwangmu Reform, a partial modernization and westernization of Korea&#x27;s military, economy, land system, education system, and various industries. In 1905, the Korean Empire became a protectorate of the Empire of Japan. After the Japanese annexation in 1910, the Korean Empire ceased to exist.

== History ==

=== Formation ===
Resistance against Korea having a tributary relationship with China increased in the 17th century. As the Ming dynasty was replaced by Qing dynasty, Western ideas entering Korea had caused anti-tributary sentiments to rise in Korea. Moreover, after the opening of Korea, members of the Gaehwa Party often declared independence from China, but China increased its interference in Korean affairs after the Imo Incident and Gapsin Coup.

However, following the Japanese victory in the First Sino-Japanese War, Joseon won independence from the Qing dynasty. Proclaiming an empire was seen by many politicians as a good way to maintain independence. After Gojong of Korea returned from his exile in the Russian legation, many officials requested Gojong to proclaim an empire to strengthen the country, and build a firm framework as an independent state. Moreover, Gojong realized that Korea needed a new constitution to gain public support, and an opportunity to start drastic reforms. He established Gyo Junso () to manage the reformed constitution. The Gyo Junso included all factions of Korean, which impeded it from making notable achievements. The main conflict between the members was about the authority of the king. The Gyo Junso was dissolved in 1899, without having achieved success.

In October 1897, Gojong was crowned in Hwangudan. The coronation included both Western style coronation and a traditional Asian one. Gojong named the new empire &quot;Daehan&quot; and changed the regnal year to &quot;Gwangmu&quot;, with 1897 being the first year of &quot;Gwangmu&quot;. Gojong implemented the constitution of the country in 1898, which gave the whole authority to the emperor.

At first, most nations did not accept the proclamation of the empire. The negative foreign response to the new empire was due to the independence of Korea from foreign influence, which had dominated its political and economic landscape. Among foreign nations, Qing showed their opposition most explicitly. They regarded the formation of the Korean Empire as a more embarrassing event than the loss of the First Sino-Japanese War. Eventually foreign monarchs acknowledged Gojong as an emperor.

=== Reforms ===

==== Gwangmu Reform ====

==== Rise of civil rights and the Independence Club ====
Even though all authority resided with the emperor, popular influence in politics increased from the Joseon era. Many newspapers such as &quot;Tongnip sinmun&quot; were established, promoting political awareness. Many organizations were established, including the Independence Club. Moreover, protests were not banned and people protested for reforms in Seoul. The Independence Club tried to bring many reforms to the country to improve civil rights. The club established the &quot;Junchuwon&quot;, which was a westernized senate of the Korean Empire. In October 1898, the Independence Club made six requests to the emperor:

# Neither officials nor people shall depend upon foreign aid, but shall do their best to strengthen and uphold the imperial power.
# All documents pertaining to foreign loans, the hiring of foreign soldiers, the granting of concessions, etc., in fact every document drawn up between the Korean government and a foreign party or firm, shall be signed and sealed by all the Ministers of State and the President of the Privy Council.
# Important offenders shall be punished only after they have been given a public trial and ample opportunity to defend themselves.
# To his Majesty shall belong the power to appoint Ministers, but in case a majority of the Cabinet disapproves of the Emperor&#x27;s nominee he shall not be appointed.
# All sources of revenue and methods of raising taxes shall be placed under the control of the Finance Department, no other department, officer or corporation being allowed to interfere therewith; and the annual estimates and balances shall be made public.
# The existing laws and regulations shall be enforced without fear or favour.

However, the Sugu Party, which was in opposition to the Independence Party, spread false rumors that the club was attempting to depose the Emperor, establish a republic, and make Bak Jeongyang President with Yun Chi-ho as Vice President. Upon hearing this rumor, Gojong ordered the immediate apprehension of members of the Independence Club. Among the 20 leaders of the club, 17 were arrested. Members of the Sugu Party wanted to execute these leaders, but the exile of President Yun Chi-ho led the party to focus on arresting Yun. On November 5, 1898, Gojong banned the club through an imperial decree. Moreover, he replaced ministers who had signed the six requests of the Independence Club. The new cabinet was formed with many politicians who were more conservative compared to the members of the Independence Club.

Another part of reform under Korean Empire was military reform. Both conservatives and the progressives agreed with strengthening military. However, they faced obstacles as the Gabo Reform seriously weakened Korean armed forces.

=== 1898–1904 ===

Right after dissolving the Independence Club and People&#x27;s Joint Association by force, Gojong sought to design his new cabinet with conservative politicians. Liberal officials, such as Min Young-hwan, Han Kyu-seol, Yi Hak-gyun, and Yi Jong-geon, received their dismissal, while conservative counterparts experienced rise to the power: Shim Sang-hun as the Uijeongbu Chanjung, Yu Gi-hwan as the Minister, Min Young-gi as the Minister of Economy, Shin Gi-sun as the Minister of Education, Min Byeong-seok as the Minister of Military, and Yi Gi-dong as the 1st Siwi Regiment 1st Battalion commander. Furthermore, many Bobusangs were integrated into the officialdom, that 46 Bobusangs received position in the officialdom; this rise of Bobusangs was a torment for commoners who suffered from their tyranny as local officials.

Even though the Independence Club was banned, reforms were not stopped and the Gwangmu Reform continued. Conservative or left of center Politicians such as Min Young-hwan, Han Kyu-seol, Yi Yong-ik, Shim Soon-taek, Yun Ung-nyeol, and Shim Sang-hun led the reforms. Among these ministers, Yun Ung-nyeol. Yi Yong-ik and Shim Sang-hun were hated by the former members of the Independence Club. These officials tried to reform the country conservatively. The new cabinet formed with conservative politicians wanted to strengthen the power of the emperor. This required more taxes from the citizens. As a result, many minor taxes that were abolished by Gabo Reform were revived. These increased taxes enabled the Imperial Government to be rich enough to perform reform.

The new cabinet also emphasized the independence of the country, leading to the enlargement of the Imperial Korean Army. Colonel Dmitry Putyata and some officers were sent from Russia to Korea. However, Putyata had conflicts with Min Young-hwan, who was the former ambassador to Russia. He returned to Russia on 26 November 1897 after assisting in the modernizing of the army. In 1898, 10 more battalions were formed. By sending troops, the empire tried to protect its people. Jinwidae forces were deployed in Jiandao, where many Koreans lived. The new cabinet also wanted to establish a modern navy by buying ships with KIS &quot;Yangmu&quot; being the first ship to be bought, for only 451,605 won.

The government tried to industrialize the country by sending many students abroad to learn modern skills. Many new technologies were brought in to Korea and many companies were established. Formalizing land ownership records also enabled better land tax collection. These reforms were able to bring changes to the Korean Empire that made the country richer and stronger.

Moreover, land system reforms were initiated to establish a proper land ownership. Under the leadership of Minister of Interior Bak Jeongyang, and Minister of Agriculture and Industry Yi Do-jae, land system reforms were purposed in June 1898. The new system not only included the land or house itself but also the surroundings of the land. This proposal was denied as only 4 out of 10 ministers assented with the proposal. However, when Gojong reviewed this cabinet conference, he ordered to proceed the land system reform just as the proposal.

==== Foreign affairs ====
One of the key problems of the Korean Empire was its foreign affairs. Despite its official neutrality, the country had many policies that favored the Russian Empire. Russia frequently intervened in Korea and many of Korea&#x27;s natural resources were sent to Russia.

Historians are still unsure what Russia&#x27;s real intentions were for Korea at the time. According to a dispatch sent from Shanghai, Russia tried to make the Korean Empire a protectorate of the Russian Empire. But Czar Nicholas II himself did not desire colonizing Korea. In 1901, Nicholas told Prince Henry of Prussia, &quot;I do not want to seize Korea but under no circumstances can I allow Japan to become firmly established there. That would be a casus belli.&quot;

=== Taft-Katsura Agreement and the Russo-Japanese War ===
Before the Russo-Japanese War, Korea tried to show its neutrality to different Western countries. On 27 January 1904, Russia, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom formally commended Korea&#x27;s declaration of neutrality.

Later that year on August 22, the first treaty between Japan and Korea, known as the First Japan–Korea Convention, was signed. This allowed the creation of a Japanese garrison in Korea, the Japanese Korean Army. The Taft–Katsura Agreement (more appropriately known as the &quot;Taft–Katsura Memorandum&quot;) was issued on July 17, 1905. It was not actually a secret pact or agreement between the United States and Japan, but rather a set of notes regarding discussions on U.S.-Japanese relations between members of the governments of both countries, hence its more appropriate name memorandum. The Japanese Prime Minister Taro Katsura used the opportunity presented by Secretary of War William Howard Taft&#x27;s stopover in Tokyo to extract a statement from Taft on the Korean question, in his capacity as a representative of the Roosevelt Administration. Taft expressed in the memorandum that a suzerain relationship with Japan guiding Korea would &quot;contribute to permanent peace in the Far East.&quot;

In September 1905, Russia and Japan signed the Treaty of Portsmouth, ending the Russo-Japanese War and firmly establishing Japan&#x27;s influence in Korea. Secret diplomatic contacts were sent by the Gwangmu Emperor in the fall of 1905 to entities outside of Korea presenting Korea&#x27;s desperate case to preserve their sovereignty, as normal diplomatic channels were no longer an option, due to the constant surveillance by the Japanese.

=== Eulsa Treaty ===

Until 1905, the Korean Empire was advancing due to reforms. However, things changed after the Eulsa Treaty. Through numerous treaties, Japan isolated Korea. Emperor Gojong was opposed to the Eulsa Treaty, but negotiations proceeded without him. There were eight ministers in the conference room. Prime Minister Han Kyu-seol, Minister of the Army Yi Geun-taek, Minister of the Interior Yi Ji-yong, Minister of Foreign Affairs Park Je-sun, Minister of Agriculture, Commerce, and Industry Gwon Jung-hyeon, Minister of Finance Min Yeong-gi, and Minister of Justice Yi Ha-yeong were the Korean ministers in the conference room. Except for Han Kyu-seol, Min Yeoung-gi, and Yi Ha-yeong, all the ministers agreed with the treaty, which established a Japanese protectorate over Korea. After the treaty was signed, the &quot;Waebu&quot;, which was the ministry of foreign affairs, was dissolved. All of Korea&#x27;s foreign affairs were now handled by Tokyo. Many embassies were recalled from Korea due to the treaty. On February 1, 1906, Itō Hirobumi, who led the Japanese treaty negotiations, became the first Japanese Resident-General of Korea.

=== Korean resistance ===
In order to manifest the invalidity of the Eulsa Treaty, Gojong sent several secret embassies to plea for support. Korean secret diplomacy&#x27;s first target was Russia. Koreans believed that Russia would help the Korean independence as several Koreans who fled to Shanghai after Japan–Korea Treaty of 1904, such as Yi Hak-gyun, had sent letters from former Russian minister to Korea Pavlov, which said that Japan would be withdrawn by Russian forces, and Russia would ensure Korean independence.

Another response to Eulsa Treaty was committing suicide. Yi Han-eung and Min Young-hwan are examples for such resistance. Many joined the righteous armies and some even attempted to assassinate the five Korean ministers who consented to the treaty also known as the Five Eulsa Traitors.

Often the Gojong of Korea himself led the resistance. He sent many messages to European monarchs such as Wilhelm II, George V, or Nicholas II. He sent Homer Hulbert, an American missionary and journalist, to the United States as an emissary in order to repudiate the treaty. In June 1906, Nicholas II secretly sent Gojong an invitation for the Hague Convention of 1907. He sent emissaries to the Hague in order to repudiate the Eulsa Treaty. However, the emissaries were not accorded recognition. The houses of Ye Wanyong were burned by the people and the Japanese Korean Army intervened to suppress public discontent. These acts against the terms of the treaty led to the abdication of Gojong, who was succeeded by Sunjong on 19 July 1907.

=== Japanese protectorate and annexation ===
After Sunjong became emperor, the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1907 was signed. Under the treaty, more Japanese were employed in the Korean government and started to intervene closely in Korean affairs. Forces of General Hasegawa garrisoned the palace. Some regiments of the Imperial Korean Army were disarmed. The Pyongyang &quot;Jinwidae&quot;, which was the elite unit of the Imperial Korean Army, was disarmed. Starting this reduction of Jinwidae, many regiments of the Imperial Korean Army were dissolved starting from 31 July 1907. These Japanese interventions fueled the righteous armies and various local peasant militias to fight against the Japanese, but with little success. From 1909, the Japanese suppressed all of the righteous armies. Many of their members fled to Manchuria or other parts of China to join the Independence Army.

Japanese officials were implanted into the Korean officialdom. According to the Japan-Korea Treaty of 1907, Japanese who served as advisors for Korea were incorporated to the Korean central government. By 31 December 1908, 40.7 percent of all officials and 36.9 percent of high-ranking officials were Japanese, with the result of many Korean officials losing their jobs.

Under Terauchi Masatake, Japan prepared to annex Korea. After the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1910 was signed on 22 August 1910, the Korean Empire was annexed. The annexation was announced on 29 August 1910.

==Military==

The Imperial Armed Forces () was the military of the Korean Empire.
=== Composition ===
The Imperial Armed Forces were composed of the Imperial Korean Army and the Imperial Korean Navy. With the central and provincial armies, the Korean Imperial grew immensely to 28,000 before 1907.

=== Organization ===
Succeeding the former Joseon Army and Navy, the Gwangmu Reform reorganized the military into a modern, Western-style one. Unlike in the Joseon dynasty, service was voluntary. It had a size of about 30,000, including soldiers and cadets.

=== Dissolution ===
The military disbanded on August 1, 1907, due to the Japan-Korea Treaty of 1907. Major Park Seung-hwan protested by committing suicide, sparking a revolt led by former imperial soldiers leading to the battle at Namdaemun Gate. Emperor Sunjong incorporated the remaining soldiers into the Imperial Guards until 1910, while others formed the foundations of the Righteous armies.

== Economy ==
Some modern enterprises emerged in the Korean Empire, including some hand-operated machinery. These enterprises faced a crisis when Japanese products were imported into the country and the enterprises lacked capital intensity. Although limited banking infrastructure existed, it was not able to adequately support economic development. Large Korean (South Korean) companies existing to this day such as Doosan and Korea Electric Power Corporation originated during the Imperial period.

Nonetheless, the Korean Empire was able to have good economic growth. The GDP per capita of the Korean Empire was $850 in 1900, which was 26th highest in the world and 2nd highest in Asia.

The economic progress of the Korean Empire was reflected in a secret report that Hayashi Gonsuke sent to Aoki Shūzō, indicating that the Korean Empire was becoming an economic participant on the global stage.

Era of Korean Empire was a period when modern companies were established. At the dawn of the Korean Empire, officials from Gaehwa Party such as Ahn Gyeong-su, Yun Chi-ho, and Yi Chae-yeon led the establishments of companies. However, as the absolute government of Gojong was established, those who were close to the Emperor including Yi Yong-ik, Min Young-hwan, and Yi Yun-yong were highly interested in the establishments of companies.

<text>Prasinohaema (Greek: &quot;green blood&quot;) is a genus of skinks characterized by having green blood. This condition is caused by an excess buildup of the bile pigment biliverdin.
 &quot;Prasinohaema&quot; species have plasma biliverdin concentrations approximately 1.5-30 times greater than fish species with green blood plasma and 40 times greater than humans with green jaundice. The benefit provided by the high pigment concentration is unknown, but one possibility is that it protects against malaria.

==Geographic range==
Species in the genus &quot;Prasinohaema&quot; are endemic to New Guinea and the Solomon Islands.

==Species==
Species in the genus include:
*&quot;Prasinohaema flavipes&quot; – common green tree skink
*&quot;Prasinohaema parkeri&quot; – Parker&#x27;s green tree skink
*&quot;Prasinohaema prehensicauda&quot; – prehensile green tree skink
*&quot;Prasinohaema semoni&quot; – Semon&#x27;s green tree skink
*&quot;Prasinohaema virens&quot; - green-blooded skink, green tree skink

&quot;Nota bene&quot;: A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than &quot;Prasinohaema&quot;.

==Etymology==
The specific names, &quot;parkeri&quot; and &quot;semoni&quot;, are in honor of English herpetologist Hampton Wildman Parker and German zoologist Richard Wolfgang Semon, respectively.

<text>Riopa is a genus of skinks. It is easy to tell the species apart from most other skinks by bright red coloring on their sides from which they get their name. They also have a bule that runs down the side of their tail.

==Diet==
The riopas are omnivore reptiles, they usually eat insects like crickets or worms, but sometimes, they can eat little pieces of meat (usually little mice)

==Species==

The following species are recognized.

*&quot;Riopa albopunctata&quot; – white-spotted supple skink
*&quot;Riopa anguina&quot; 
*&quot;Riopa goaensis&quot; – Goan supple skink

<text>Ristella is a genus of skinks, lizards in the family Scincidae. The genus is endemic to the Western Ghats of southwestern India. Member species are commonly known as cat skinks because of their retractile claws. This genus can be instantly identified by the presence of only four fingers in forelimbs in all the species (instead of the usual five). All the members look more or less similar, and are drab dark brown to blackish in colouration, with paler undersides. This poorly known group of lizards is diurnal, insectivorous, terrestrial to semi-fossorial in habits. They inhabit deep leaf-litter and grasslands in montane forests and rainforests.

==Description==
Lizards of the genus &quot;Ristella&quot; share the following characters. The palatine and pterygoid bones are in contact on the median line of the palate, which is toothless. The palatine notch is small, far behind, corresponding to the posterior notch of the tongue. The teeth are conical. The eyelids are well developed, and are scaly. The ear-opening is distinct. The nostril is pierced in a single nasal scale. There are no supranasals. The prefrontals are small or coalesced. The frontoparietals and the interparietal are distinct. The limbs are well developed. The anterior limbs have four digits, and the posterior have five. The claws are completely retractile, each into a large compressed sheath formed of one large scale cleft beneath.

==Geographic range==
All species in the genus &quot;Ristella&quot; are endemic to the Western Ghats hill-tracts of southwestern India. Currently these skinks have been recorded from the southern and central Western Ghats of Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka states. Hill ranges such as Travancore hills, High Ranges, Anaimalai, Nilgiris, Palni Hills, Coorg, Canara and Goa Ghats have been known to harbour these lizards.

==Key to species==
*A. A pair of small prefrontals; frontonasal forming a suture with frontal.
**a. Ear-opening much larger than nostril; dorsal scales feebly bi- or tricarinate.
***&quot;R. rurkii&quot;
**b. Ear-opening not, or but slightly, larger than nostril; dorsal scales sharply bicarinate.
***&quot;R. travancorica&quot;
*B. Two azygous shields between rostral and frontal.
**a. 22 to 24 scales round middle of body; adpressed limbs not meeting.
***&quot;R. guentheri&quot;
**b 26 scales round body; adpressed limbs meeting or overlapping.
***&quot;R. beddomii&quot; 

==Species==
The following four species are recognized as being valid:

*&quot;Ristella beddomii&quot; – Beddome&#x27;s cat skink
*&quot;Ristella guentheri&quot; – Günther&#x27;s ristella
*&quot;Ristella rurkii&quot; – Rurk&#x27;s ristella
*&quot;Ristella travancorica&quot; – Travancore cat skink, Travancore ristella

&quot;Nota bene&quot;: A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than &quot;Ristella&quot;.

<text>Peters&#x27; banded skink (Scincopus fasciatus) is a species of skink belonging to the monotypic genus Scincopus.
These skinks are primarily found in the arid and rocky deserts of North Africa, with their range extending across regions such as Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, and Egypt.

== Habitat ==
Peter&#x27;s banded skink is a secretive and primarily terrestrial species. The habitats consisted of sandy areas covered with low discontinuous shrubs and scattered annual herbaceous plants (&quot;Cenchrus ciliaris&quot;). Shrubs consisted mainly in &quot;Rhantheruim suaveolens&quot;, &quot;Haloxylon scoparium&quot; and &quot;H. schmittianum&quot;.

== Reproduction ==
This species is oviparous. Females lay a clutch of eggs in burrows, providing protection from potential predators and temperature extremes. In captivity, clutch sizes of 4-5 eggs have been recorded.

<doc id="342291" wikidata="Q724121" url="?curid=342291" title="Pat Brown">
<text>Edmund Gerald &quot;Pat&quot; Brown (April 21, 1905 – February 16, 1996) was an American lawyer and politician who served as the 32nd governor of California from 1959 to 1967. His first elected office was as district attorney for San Francisco, and he was later elected attorney general of California in 1950, before becoming the state&#x27;s governor after the 1958 election.

Born in San Francisco, Brown had an early interest in speaking and politics. He skipped college and he earned an LL.B. law degree in 1927. In his first term as governor, Brown delivered on major legislation, including a tax increase and the California Master Plan for Higher Education. The California State Water Project was a major and highly complex achievement. He also pushed through civil-rights legislation. In a second term, troubles mounted, including the defeat of a fair housing law (1964 California Proposition 14), the 1960s Berkeley protests, the Watts riots, and internal battles among Democrats over support or opposition to the Vietnam War. He lost the 1966 California gubernatorial election for a third term to future president Ronald Reagan; his legacy has since earned him regard as the builder of modern California.

His son Jerry Brown was the 34th and 39th governor of California, as well as the 31st attorney general of California, holding two offices he once held. His daughter, Kathleen Brown, was the 29th California state treasurer.

==Background==
Brown was born in 1905 in San Francisco, California, one of four children of Ida (née Schuckman) and Edmund Joseph Brown. His father came from an Irish Catholic family, with his grandfather Joseph immigrating from County Tipperary, Ireland. His mother Ida was from a German Protestant family. He acquired the nickname &quot;Pat&quot; during his school years; the nickname was a reference to his Patrick Henry–like oratory. When he was 12 and selling Liberty Bonds on street corners, he would end his spiel with, &quot;Give me liberty, or give me death.&quot;

Brown was a debate champion as a member of the Lowell Forensic Society at San Francisco&#x27;s Lowell High School, where he held twelve offices of student government; he graduated from Lowell in 1923. Rather than pursue an undergraduate degree, he instead worked in his father&#x27;s cigar store, which doubled as a gambling shop. He studied law at night, while working part-time for attorney Milton Schmitt, receiving an LL.B. degree from San Francisco Law School in spring 1927. After passing the California bar exam the following fall, he began full-time employment in Schmitt&#x27;s office.

Brown ran as a Republican Party candidate for the State Assembly in 1928, but lost badly; he moved to the Democratic Party in 1934, as the Great Depression had made him lose confidence in the pro-business Republican Party. He quickly became a New Dealer, and an active party participant. His second attempt at election to public office came in 1939, running for district attorney of San Francisco against Matthew Brady, an incumbent of twenty-two years, who beat him handily.

==District attorney==

Four years after his defeat, Brown ran for district attorney again in 1943 with the slogan &quot;Crack down on crime, elect Brown this time.&quot; His victory over Brady was decisive, coming to the surprise of San Francisco politicians, as well as bookmakers who had put 5 to 1 odds against his election. He was reelected to the office in 1947, and after seven years in office, received the support of Republican Governor Earl Warren. He emulated the course followed by Warren when the Governor himself was the Alameda County district attorney. His actions against gambling, corruption, and juvenile delinquency brought attention to his office.

In 1946, as the Democratic nominee, Brown lost the race for attorney general of California to Los Angeles County District Attorney Frederick N. Howser. Running again in 1950, he won election as Attorney General and was re-elected in 1954. As Attorney General, he was the only Democrat to win statewide election in California.

== First term as governor, 1959–1963 ==
In the 1958 California gubernatorial election, he was the Democratic nominee for governor, running on a campaign of &quot;responsible liberalism,&quot; with support for labor, and forcing the ballot name change of Proposition 18 from &quot;Right-to-Work&quot; to &quot;Employer and Employee Relations,&quot; whereas Brown&#x27;s opponent campaigned for such right-to-work laws as Proposition 18 provided. In the general election, Brown defeated Republican U.S. Senator William F. Knowland by 1,029,165 votes (60% to 40%) , Proposition 18 and other anti-labor ballot measures were voted down, and Democrats were elected to a majority in both houses of the legislature, and to all statewide offices, excepting Secretary of State.

Brown was known for his cheerful personality, and his championing of building an infrastructure to meet the needs of the rapidly growing state. As journalist Adam Nagourney reports: &quot;With a jubilant Mr. Brown officiating, California commemorated the moment it became the nation&#x27;s largest state, in 1962, with a church-bell-ringing, four-day celebration. He was the boom-boom governor for a boom-boom time: championing highways, universities and, most consequential, a sprawling water network to feed the explosion of agriculture and development in the dry reaches of central and Southern California.&quot; Brown appointed Fred Dutton as chief of staff as a reward for his enormously energetic and effective row last campaign manager. Bert Levitt, a Republican friend, was named director of finance to draw up a state budget. The role of press secretary went to reporter Hale Champion. Further down the ladder, Brown cleaned house, replacing all of Knight&#x27;s political appointees. His team worked hard in preparation for the governor&#x27;s inauguration. Although he was basically a moderate, Brown reached out to the powerful left wing in his party by emphasizing the word “liberal” repeatedly, He proclaimed: &quot;Offered government by retreat, the people preferred progress.&quot; Newcomers were arriving at 500,000 a year, and there was no time to be lost in responding to the needs they created.

He set up a Fair Employment Practices Commission that helped African Americans break through the informal barriers that it kept them out of white collar positions. Numerous other reforms were passed, largely thanks to cooperation with the Democratic leaders in the state legislature, including George Miller Jr. in the Senate, and Bill Munnell and Jesse Unruh in the assembly.

=== Tax increase ===
Brown wanted to expand state services but first had to end the deficit and obtain enough revenue for his plans. Tax increases were headed by the personal income tax, where the top rate went from 6% to 7%, with new exemptions for the poor. There was an increase in the profits taxes paid by banks and corporations, a tax on cigarettes, beer, and betting, as well as a severance tax on oil and natural gas. A few compromises were made, but in the end, Brown got his money for expansion of the state budget. 
=== California State Water Project ===

With his administration beginning in 1959, Brown set in motion a series of actions whose magnitude was unseen since the governorship of Hiram Johnson. The post–World War II economic expansion brought millions of newcomers to the state which, along with the state&#x27;s cyclical droughts, severely strained California&#x27;s water resources, especially in dry Southern California. This began the California State Water Project, whose objective was to address the fact that one half of the state&#x27;s people lived in a region containing one percent of the state&#x27;s natural supply of water. Much of the state&#x27;s extant water was controlled by regional bodies, and the federal government. These federally controlled areas were under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Reclamation, which was considering the implementation of a &quot;160-acre principle&quot;, a policy contained within the Newlands Reclamation Act of 1902, limiting delivery of federally subsidized water to parcels equal to the size of a homestead, which was 160 acres. This brought strong opposition from the agricultural industry, and as such would require significant splintering of existent land holdings. To relieve this threat to the agricultural economy, Brown and other state leaders began the State Water Project, whose master plan included a vast system of reservoirs, aqueducts, and pipelines powered by pump stations and electrical generating plants to transport the water statewide. This included the capture of the Sacramento River runoff, redirecting the seabound water through the San Joaquin Valley, not only irrigating the arid desert regions, but also providing Southern California, particularly Los Angeles County, with the water required to sustain expansions in population and industry. The entire project was projected to take sixty years, costing $13 billion, nearly $104 billion in 2015 dollars.

Opposition to the State Water Project was immediate, especially with Sacramento River Delta users worrying about saltwater intrusion which had already been a concern without factoring in redirection of outward freshwater flow. Residents of the Bay Area and elsewhere in Northern California were concerned about the increase in water draw the South might demand as populations expanded. While Southern support for the project was clear, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California worried that the project did not ensure permanent rights to Northern water. This led the legislature to amend the plan, prohibiting the state&#x27;s southern water rights from being rescinded, clearing any remaining reservations from the state&#x27;s southern water authorities. Governor Brown was a staunch supporter of the plan, energetically opposing critics and seeking solutions. He lobbied Congress to exempt California from the 160-acre rule, lauding the benefit of employment and progress to the state&#x27;s northern and southern residents, calling for an end to the north–south rivalry. Brown also reduced his introductory bond issuance from $11 billion to $1.75 billion, beginning a television campaign to appeal to residents. Governor Brown insisted on the Burns-Porter Act which sent the bond issue to a referendum; the 1960 vote saw Butte County as the sole Northern California county not voting against the measure. However, the growth in Southern California&#x27;s population led to the plan&#x27;s adoption.
=== Political reforms ===

The first year of Brown&#x27;s administration saw the abolition of the cross-filing system that had enabled candidates to file with multiple political parties at once while running for office. The 1964 U.S. Supreme Court decision &quot;Reynolds v. Sims&quot; declared unconstitutional California&#x27;s &quot;federal plan&quot;, which had allocated the apportionment of state senators along county lines, as opposed to population-based districts. Now, while the City and County of San Francisco had one state senator, Los Angeles County received thirteen; this massive shift in the legislature&#x27;s composition led Brown, along with Assembly Speaker Jesse M. Unruh, to change the way California government operated.

In 1962, the Constitutional Revision Commission was established. It operated until 1974, proposing changes to the state&#x27;s 1879 constitution, decreasing length and complexity by nearly fifty percent through ballot propositions recommended by the commission, of which seventy-five percent were approved by voters. Among the enacted reforms were removal of the 120-day limit on legislative sessions, increased legislators&#x27; salaries, and a reduction in the percentage of signatures required to place propositions on the ballot. Governor Brown insisted on Unruh&#x27;s reforms that abolished various government agencies and consolidated others.

=== Structural reform of the executive branch ===

Upon taking office, Brown realized that the state executive branch had grown to an unmanageable level of complexity because of the legislature&#x27;s unfortunate habit of solving problems by creating new boards and commissions directly responsible to the governor—approximately 360 boards, commissions, and agencies all reported directly to the governor. In February 1961, Brown proposed a massive reorganization plan for the state government, which included the creation of several so-called &quot;super-agencies&quot; (originally spelled with a hyphen) to greatly reduce the number of direct reports to the governor. In September 1961, Brown appointed the secretaries of the first four superagencies (of eight then planned). The superagencies continue to exist today as part of the long-term legacy of the Brown administration, although there are currently only seven, and there are several Cabinet-level departments outside of them.

=== Education ===

Californians were energized by the need to catch up with the Soviet Union, which had taken the lead in technology by launching the world&#x27;s first space satellite Sputnik 1. Brown signed the California Master Plan for Higher Education in 1960. This new system defined the roles of the University of California, the California State University, and California Community College systems, each with different goals, objectives, offerings, and student composition. It provided a model for other states to develop their own similar systems. Governor Brown sought free higher education for California students, which the Master Plan provided. His successor, Ronald Reagan, would change this policy, insisting on student tuition. With the passage of Proposition 13 in 1978, state education funding fell further, straining Brown&#x27;s Master Plan due to lack of property tax funds.

=== Re-election of 1962 against Richard Nixon ===
Brown&#x27;s first term as governor was very successful, but failings on important matters to him were costly. Agriculture and special interests defeated his best efforts to pass a $1.25 per hour minimum wage, and Brown&#x27;s opposition to capital punishment was overruled by the practice being supported statewide. Brown was a supporter of Senator John F. Kennedy in the 1960 presidential election, but Brown&#x27;s California delegation to the Democratic National Convention did not abide by his support for Kennedy, which nearly cost Kennedy the nomination. Brown&#x27;s opponent in 1962 was former Vice President Richard Nixon. Having narrowly lost the presidency to Kennedy in 1960, Nixon was not interested in the governorship of his native California other than as a path to the White House. Unfamiliar with California politics and matters, Nixon resorted to accusing Brown of &#x27;softness&#x27; against communism, which was not a successful platform. In the November 1962 election, Brown was reelected, by 296,758 votes, whereupon Nixon famously held his self-proclaimed &quot;last press conference&quot; (he would eventually become president in 1969).

== Second term as governor, 1963–1967 ==

The legislature passed the Rumford Fair Housing Act, which provided that landlords could not deny people housing because of ethnicity, religion, sex, marital status, physical handicap, or familial status. This new law brought a slew of lawsuits against the state government, and led to California Proposition 14 (1964), which overturned the Rumford Act with nearly two-thirds in favor. The U.S. Supreme Court decision of &quot;Reitman v. Mulkey&quot; (387 U.S. 369) upheld the California Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling that the proposition overturning the Rumford Act was unconstitutional.

Brown&#x27;s terms in office were marked by a dramatic increase in water-resources development. The California Aqueduct, built as part of the program, was named for him. He also presided over the implementation of the California Master Plan for Higher Education, fair employment legislation, a state economic development commission, and a consumers&#x27; council. He sponsored some 40 major proposals, gaining passage of 35.

=== Watts riots ===
On August 11, 1965, the Watts riots erupted in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles, lasting for a week. On the evening of the same day, Marquette Frye was pulled over on suspicion of driving while under the influence; a field sobriety test was administered, he was arrested, and the police officer called for the impounding of his vehicle. When his mother, Rena Price, was brought to the scene by his brother, a scuffle began, and soon crowds built, snowballing the incident into full-blown riots. By August 13, the third day of riots, Governor Brown ordered 2,300 National Guardsmen to Watts, which increased to 3,900 by the night&#x27;s end. By the conflict&#x27;s end, 1,000 people were wounded and 34 died, $40 million worth of damage was inflicted, and 1,000 buildings destroyed. This incident began massive protests and riots throughout the state which, along with developments of the Vietnam War, began Brown&#x27;s decline in popularity.

=== Capital punishment ===
During both terms in office, Brown commuted 23 death sentences, signing the first commutation on his second day in office. One of his more notable commutations was the death sentence of Erwin &quot;Machine-Gun&quot; Walker, whose execution in the gas chamber for first-degree murder had been postponed because of an attempted suicide some hours before it was scheduled to take place. After Walker recovered, his execution was postponed while he was being restored to mental competency. After Walker was declared sane in 1961, Brown commuted Walker&#x27;s death sentence to life without the possibility of parole. Walker was later paroled after the California Supreme Court held that the governor could not legally deny a prisoner the right to parole in a death-sentence commutation. Another prisoner whose death sentence was commuted by Brown committed at least one murder after being paroled.

While governor, Brown&#x27;s attitude toward capital punishment was often ambivalent, if not arbitrary. An ardent supporter of gun control, he was more inclined to let convicts go to the gas chamber if they had killed with guns than with other weapons. He later admitted that he denied clemency in one capital case principally since the legislator who represented the district in which the murder occurred held a swing vote on farmworker legislation supported by Brown, and had told Brown that his district &quot;would go up in smoke&quot; if the governor commuted the man&#x27;s sentence.

In contrast, Governor Brown approved 36 executions, including the highly controversial cases of Caryl Chessman in 1960 and Elizabeth Duncan in 1962; she was the last female put to death before a national moratorium was instituted. Though he had supported capital punishment while serving as district attorney, as attorney general, and when first elected governor, he later became an opponent of it.

During the Chessman case, Brown proposed that capital punishment be abolished, but the proposal failed. His Republican successor, Ronald Reagan, was a firm supporter of capital punishment and oversaw, in 1967, the last execution in California prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that it was unconstitutional in &quot;Furman v. Georgia&quot; (1972).

===Campaign for third term===
Brown&#x27;s decision to seek a third term as governor, violating an earlier promise not to do so, hurt his popularity. His sagging popularity was evidenced by a tough battle in the Democratic primary, normally not a concern for an incumbent. Los Angeles Mayor Sam Yorty received nearly forty percent of the primary vote while Brown only received fifty-two, a very low number for an incumbent in a primary election.

The California Republican Party seized upon Brown&#x27;s increasing unpopularity by nominating a well-known and charismatic political outsider, actor and union leader Ronald Reagan. With Richard Nixon and William Knowland working tirelessly behind the scenes and Reagan trumpeting his law-and-order campaign message, Reagan received almost two thirds of the primary vote over George Christopher, the moderate Republican former mayor of San Francisco; his push towards the general election held great momentum. At first, Brown ran a low-key campaign, stating that running the state was his biggest priority, but later began campaigning on the record of his eight years as governor. As Reagan&#x27;s lead in the polls increased, Brown began to panic and made a serious gaffe when he ran a television commercial in which he told a group of schoolchildren that his opponent was an actor, and reminded them &quot;it was an actor who shot Abraham Lincoln. The comparison of Reagan to John Wilkes Booth did not go over well, furthering the decline of Brown&#x27;s campaign.

On election day, Reagan was ahead in the polls and favored to win a relatively close election. Brown lost the 1966 election to Ronald Reagan in his second consecutive race against a future Republican President. Reagan won in a landslide; his 993,739 vote plurality surprised even his staunchest supporters. Reagan&#x27;s victory against an incumbent was a dramatic upheaval. His majority of nearly fifty-eight percent nearly matched that of Brown&#x27;s own victory in 1958, and Reagan garnered some 990,000 new votes from the larger electorate.

=== Legacy ===
Although he left office defeated, Brown&#x27;s time in office is one which has fared well. Brown was a relatively popular Democrat in what was, at the time, a Republican-leaning state. After his reelection victory over Richard Nixon in 1962, he was strongly considered for Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s running mate in the 1964 presidential election, a position that eventually went to Hubert Humphrey. However, Brown&#x27;s popularity began to sag amidst the civil disorders of the Watts riots and the early anti–Vietnam War demonstrations at U.C. Berkeley. His monumental infrastructure projects, building aqueducts, canals, and pump stations, established new fertile lands in the Central Valley; the Governor Edmund G. Brown California Aqueduct was named after him. During his term, four new University of California campuses were built, as well as seven new California State University campuses, making the Master Plan&#x27;s higher education system the largest in the world. During the Watergate scandal President Richard Nixon considered appointing Brown as special counsel, but the choice was rejected by Attorney General Elliot Richardson.

While no person elected Governor of California has been denied a second term since Earl Warren defeated Culbert Olson in 1942, Brown&#x27;s losing bid for a third term to Ronald Reagan was the last time, as of 2022, an incumbent governor lost in the general election (Gray Davis&#x27; loss in the 2003 recall was a non-quadrennial election). Today, Governor Brown is widely credited with the creation of modern California.

== Personal life ==
Brown&#x27;s wife, Bernice Layne, was a fellow student at Lowell High School, but it was not until the completion of his law degree, and her teaching credential, that they began a courtship. Following his loss in the Assembly election, he and Bernice eloped in 1930. They had four children, who were all born in San Francisco:

* Barbara Layne Brown (born July 13, 1931)
* Cynthia Arden Brown (born October 19, 1933 – died March 29, 2015)
* Edmund Gerald &quot;Jerry&quot; Brown Jr. (born April 7, 1938)
* Kathleen Lynn Brown (born September 25, 1945)

In 1958, as governor-elect, Brown appeared as a guest challenger on the TV panel show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;

After leaving office, Brown returned to the practice of law and also experienced success in business, investing in a company involved with the Indonesian petroleum industry.

Brown died from a heart attack at his home in the Beverly Canyon section of Los Angeles on February 16, 1996, at the age of 90. He is interred at Holy Cross Cemetery in Colma.

== Presidential and vice presidential candidate ==
Unlike his son Jerry Brown, Pat himself never seriously ran for President of the United States, but was frequently California&#x27;s &quot;favorite son.&quot; During the 1952 Democratic primaries, Brown placed distant second to Estes Kefauver in total votes (65.04% to 9.97%), losing California to Kefauver. During Governor Brown&#x27;s first term, the national census confirmed that California would become the nation&#x27;s most populous state. This, along with Brown&#x27;s political popularity, would contribute to two national presidential victories, when he pledged his votes to the national candidates, John F. Kennedy in 1960, and Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964, at the Democratic conventions. As governor, Brown was again California&#x27;s favorite son in 1960, winning his home state with a large margin to his only opponent, George H. McLain. Running only in the California primary, the state&#x27;s sheer population size placed him second, behind the eventual nominee, John F. Kennedy, thus repeating his 1952 state and national rankings. However, only one delegate cast his vote for Brown at the 1960 Democratic National Convention.

During the 1964 primaries, by running again only in California, the nation&#x27;s largest state electorate vote, Brown placed first this time in both the California and the Democratic national primary total, besting the eventual nominee. However, along with over a dozen other candidates, aside from George Wallace, Brown was a stalking horse for incumbent Lyndon B. Johnson, whose nomination was assured.

Brown also briefly sought the vice presidential nomination at the 1956 Democratic National Convention, winning one vote.

<text>Scincus is a genus of skinks, lizards in the family Scincidae. The genus contains four or five species, all of which are typical desert inhabitants, living in sandy and dune-like areas with a hot and dry climate. Species in the genus &quot;Scincus&quot; can be found from Arabia to the Sahara desert.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Scincus&quot; is the type genus of the subfamily Scincinae. As the subfamily Scincinae appears to be paraphyletic and is in need of revision, it is as yet undetermined which skink genera are closely enough related to &quot;Scincus&quot; to be retained in the Scincinae. (Austin &amp; Arnold 2006).

==Species==
The genus &quot;Scincus&quot; contains five species which are recognized as being valid.
&quot;Nota bene&quot;: A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than &quot;Scincus&quot;.

<text>Sepsina is a genus of skinks (family Scincidae). The genus is endemic to southern Africa.

==Taxonomy==
This genus is presently placed in the subfamily Scincinae, a subfamily which seems to be paraphyletic however. &quot;Sepsina&quot; belongs to a major clade of this group which does not seem to include the type genus &quot;Scincus&quot;. Thus, it will probably be eventually assigned to a new, yet-to-be-named subfamily.

==Species==
The following five species are recognized:

*&quot;Sepsina alberti&quot; – Albert&#x27;s skink, Albert&#x27;s burrowing skink 
*&quot;Sepsina angolensis&quot; – Angola skink
*&quot;Sepsina bayonii&quot; – Bayon&#x27;s skink

<text>Sigaloseps is a genus of skinks which inhabit the moist, closed forest of southern New Caledonia.

==Conservation status==
There is some conservation concern for &quot;Sigaloseps&quot; because of mining activity taking place in the region.

==Species==
The following 6 species are recognized as being valid.

*&quot;Sigaloseps balios&quot; 
*&quot;Sigaloseps conditus&quot; 
*&quot;Sigaloseps deplanchei&quot; - Deplanche&#x27;s shiny skink
*&quot;Sigaloseps ferrugicauda&quot; 
*&quot;Sigaloseps pisinnus&quot; 
*&quot;Sigaloseps ruficauda&quot; 

&quot;Nota bene&quot;: A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than &quot;Sigaloseps&quot;.

==Etymology==
The specific name, &quot;deplanchei&quot;, is in honor of French naturalist Émile Deplanche.

<text>Lumbar puncture (LP), also known as a spinal tap, is a medical procedure in which a needle is inserted into the spinal canal, most commonly to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for diagnostic testing. The main reason for a lumbar puncture is to help diagnose diseases of the central nervous system, including the brain and spine. Examples of these conditions include meningitis and subarachnoid hemorrhage. It may also be used therapeutically in some conditions. Increased intracranial pressure (pressure in the skull) is a contraindication, due to risk of brain matter being compressed and pushed toward the spine. Sometimes, lumbar puncture cannot be performed safely (for example due to a severe bleeding tendency). It is regarded as a safe procedure, but post-dural-puncture headache is a common side effect if a small atraumatic needle is not used.

The procedure is typically performed under local anesthesia using a sterile technique. A hypodermic needle is used to access the subarachnoid space and collect fluid. Fluid may be sent for biochemical, microbiological, and cytological analysis. Using ultrasound to landmark may increase success.

Lumbar puncture was first introduced in 1891 by the German physician Heinrich Quincke.

==Medical uses==
The reason for a lumbar puncture may be to make a diagnosis or to treat a disease, as outlined below.

===Diagnosis===
The chief diagnostic indications of lumbar puncture are for collection of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Analysis of CSF may exclude infectious, inflammatory, and neoplastic diseases affecting the central nervous system. The most common purpose is in suspected meningitis, since there is no other reliable tool with which meningitis, a life-threatening but highly treatable condition, can be excluded. A lumbar puncture can also be used to detect whether someone has Stage 1 or Stage 2 &quot;Trypanosoma brucei&quot;. Young infants commonly require lumbar puncture as a part of the routine workup for fever without a source. This is due to higher rates of meningitis than in older persons. Infants also do not reliably show classic symptoms of meningeal irritation (meningismus) like neck stiffness and headache the way adults do. In any age group, subarachnoid hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, benign intracranial hypertension, and many other diagnoses may be supported or excluded with this test. It may also be used to detect the presence of malignant cells in the CSF, as in carcinomatous meningitis or medulloblastoma. CSF containing less than 10 red blood cells (RBCs)/mm3 constitutes a &quot;negative&quot; tap in the context of a workup for subarachnoid hemorrhage, for example. Taps that are &quot;positive&quot; have an RBC count of 100/mm3 or more.

===Treatment===
Lumbar punctures may also be done to inject medications into the cerebrospinal fluid (&quot;intrathecally&quot;), particularly for spinal anesthesia or chemotherapy.

Serial lumbar punctures may be useful in temporary treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). This disease is characterized by increased pressure of CSF which may cause headache and permanent loss of vision. While mainstays of treatment are medication, in some cases lumbar puncture performed multiple times may improve symptoms. It is not recommended as a staple of treatment due to discomfort and risk of the procedure, and the short duration of its efficacy.

Additionally, some people with normal pressure hydrocephalus (characterized by urinary incontinence, a changed ability to walk properly, and dementia) receive some relief of symptoms after removal of CSF.

==Contraindications==
Lumbar puncture should not be performed in the following situations:
* Idiopathic (unidentified cause) increased intracranial pressure (ICP)
** Rationale: lumbar puncture in the presence of raised ICP may cause uncal herniation
** Exception: therapeutic use of lumbar puncture to reduce ICP, but only if obstruction (for example in the third ventricle of the brain) has been ruled out
** Precaution
*** CT brain, especially in the following situations
**** Age &gt;65
**** Reduced GCS
**** Recent history of seizure
**** Focal neurological signs
**** Abnormal respiratory pattern
**** Hypertension with bradycardia and deteriorating consciousness
*** Ophthalmoscopy for papilledema
* Bleeding diathesis (relative)
** Coagulopathy
** Decreased platelet count (&lt;50 x 109/L)
* Infections
** Skin infection at puncture site
* Vertebral deformities (scoliosis or kyphosis), in hands of an inexperienced physician.

==Adverse effects==
===Headache===
Post-dural-puncture headache with nausea is the most common complication; it often responds to pain medications and infusion of fluids. It was long taught that this complication can be prevented by strict maintenance of a supine posture for two hours after the successful puncture; this has not been borne out in modern studies involving large numbers of people. Doing the procedure with the person on their side might decrease the risk. Intravenous caffeine injection is often quite effective in aborting these spinal headaches. A headache that is persistent despite a long period of bedrest and occurs only when sitting up may be indicative of a CSF leak from the lumbar puncture site. It can be treated by more bedrest, or by an epidural blood patch, where the person&#x27;s own blood is injected back into the site of leakage to cause a clot to form and seal off the leak.

The risk of headache and need for analgesia and blood patch is much reduced if &quot;atraumatic&quot; needles are used. This does not affect the success rate of the procedure in other ways. Although the cost and difficulty are similar, adoption remains low, at only 16% .

The headaches may be caused by inadvertent puncture of the dura mater.

===Other===
Contact between the side of the lumbar puncture needle and a spinal nerve root can result in anomalous sensations (paresthesia) in a leg during the procedure; this is harmless and people can be warned about it in advance to minimize their anxiety if it should occur.

Serious complications of a properly performed lumbar puncture are extremely rare. They include spinal or epidural bleeding, adhesive arachnoiditis and trauma to the spinal cord or spinal nerve roots resulting in weakness or loss of sensation, or even paraplegia. The latter is exceedingly rare, since the level at which the spinal cord ends (normally the inferior border of L1, although it is slightly lower in infants) is several vertebral spaces above the proper location for a lumbar puncture (L3/L4). There are case reports of lumbar puncture resulting in perforation of abnormal dural arterio-venous malformations, resulting in catastrophic epidural hemorrhage; this is exceedingly rare.

The procedure is not recommended when epidural infection is present or suspected, when topical infections or dermatological conditions pose a risk of infection at the puncture site or in patients with severe psychosis or neurosis with back pain. Some authorities believe that withdrawal of fluid when initial pressures are abnormal could result in spinal cord compression or cerebral herniation; others believe that such events are merely coincidental in time, occurring independently as a result of the same pathology that the lumbar puncture was performed to diagnose. In any case, computed tomography of the brain is often performed prior to lumbar puncture if an intracranial mass is suspected.

CSF leaks can result from a lumbar puncture procedure.

==Technique==

===Mechanism===

The brain and spinal cord are enveloped by a layer of cerebrospinal fluid, 125–150 mL in total (in adults) which acts as a shock absorber and provides a medium for the transfer of nutrients and waste products. The majority is produced by the choroid plexus in the brain and circulates from there to other areas, before being reabsorbed into the circulation (predominantly by the arachnoid granulations).

The cerebrospinal fluid can be accessed most safely in the lumbar cistern. Below the first or second lumbar vertebrae (L1 or L2) the spinal cord terminates (conus medullaris). Nerves continue down the spine below this, but in a loose bundle of nerve fibers called the cauda equina. There is lower risk with inserting a needle into the spine at the level of the cauda equina because these loose fibers move out of the way of the needle without being damaged. The lumbar cistern extends into the sacrum up to the S2 vertebra.

===Procedure===

The person is usually placed on their side (left more commonly than right). The patient bends the neck so the chin is close to the chest, hunches the back, and brings knees toward the chest. This approximates a fetal position as much as possible. Patients may also sit on a stool and bend their head and shoulders forward. The area around the lower back is prepared using aseptic technique. Once the appropriate location is palpated, local anaesthetic is infiltrated under the skin and then injected along the intended path of the spinal needle. A spinal needle is inserted between the lumbar vertebrae L3/L4, L4/L5 or L5/S1 and pushed in until there is a &quot;give&quot; as it enters the lumbar cistern wherein the ligamentum flavum is housed. The needle is again pushed until there is a second &#x27;give&#x27; that indicates the needle is now past the dura mater. The arachnoid membrane and the dura mater exist in flush contact with one another in the living person&#x27;s spine due to fluid pressure from CSF in the subarachnoid space pushing the arachnoid membrane out towards the dura. Therefore, once the needle has pierced the dura mater it has also traversed the thinner arachnoid membrane. The needle is then in the subarachnoid space. The from the spinal needle is then withdrawn and drops of cerebrospinal fluid are collected. The opening pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid may be taken during this collection by using a simple column manometer. The procedure is ended by withdrawing the needle while placing pressure on the puncture site. The spinal level is so selected to avoid spinal injuries. In the past, the patient would lie on their back for at least six hours and be monitored for signs of neurological problems. There is no scientific evidence that this provides any benefit. The technique described is almost identical to that used in spinal anesthesia, except that spinal anesthesia is more often done with the patient in a seated position.

The upright seated position is advantageous in that there is less distortion of spinal anatomy which allows for easier withdrawal of fluid. Some practitioners prefer it for lumbar puncture in obese patients, where lying on their side would cause a scoliosis and unreliable anatomical landmarks. However, opening pressures are notoriously unreliable when measured in the seated position. Therefore, patients will ideally lie on their side if practitioners need to measure opening pressure.

Reinsertion of the stylet may decrease the rate of post lumbar puncture headaches.

Although not available in all clinical settings, use of ultrasound is helpful for visualizing the interspinous space and assessing the depth of the spine from the skin. Use of ultrasound reduces the number of needle insertions and redirections, and results in higher rates of successful lumbar puncture. If the procedure is difficult, such as in people with spinal deformities such as scoliosis, it can also be performed under fluoroscopy (under continuous X-ray imaging).

===Children===
In children, a sitting flexed position was as successful as lying on the side with respect to obtaining non-traumatic CSF, CSF for culture, and cell count. There was a higher success rate in obtaining CSF in the first attempt in infants younger than 12 months in the sitting flexed position.

The spine of an infant at the time of birth differs from the adult spine. The &quot;conus medullaris&quot; (bottom of the spinal cord) terminates at the level of L1 in adults, but may range in term neonates (newly born babies) from L1–L3 levels. It is important to insert the spinal needle below the conus medullaris at the L3/L4 or L4/L5 interspinous levels. With growth of the spine, the conus typically reaches the adult level (L1) by 2 years of age.

The &quot;ligamentum flavum&quot; and &quot;dura mater&quot; are not as thick in infants and children as they are in adults. Therefore, it is difficult to assess when the needle passes through them into the subarachnoid space because the characteristic &quot;pop&quot; or &quot;give&quot; may be subtle or nonexistent in the pediatric lumbar puncture. To decrease the chances of inserting the spinal needle too far, some clinicians use the &quot;Cincinnati&quot; method. This method involves removing the stylet of the spinal needle once the needle has advanced through the dermis. After removal of the stylet, the needle is inserted until CSF starts to come out of the needle. Once all of the CSF is collected, the stylet is then reinserted before removal of the needle.

=== Newborn infants ===
Lumbar punctures are often used to diagnose or verify an infection in very young babies and can cause quite a bit of pain unless appropriate pain control is used (analgesia). Managing pain is important for infants undergoing this procedure. Approaches for pain control include topical pain medications (anaesthetics such as lidocaine). The most effective approach for pain control in infants who require a lumbar puncture is not clear.

==Interpretation==
Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid generally includes a cell count and determination of the glucose and protein concentrations. The other analytical studies of cerebrospinal fluid are conducted according to the diagnostic suspicion.

===Pressure determination===

Increased CSF pressure can indicate congestive heart failure, cerebral edema, subarachnoid hemorrhage, hypo-osmolality resulting from hemodialysis, meningeal inflammation, purulent meningitis or tuberculous meningitis, hydrocephalus, or pseudotumor cerebri. In the setting of raised pressure (or normal pressure hydrocephalus, where the pressure is normal but there is excessive CSF), lumbar puncture may be therapeutic.

Decreased CSF pressure can indicate complete subarachnoid blockage, leakage of spinal fluid, severe dehydration, hyperosmolality, or circulatory collapse. Significant changes in pressure during the procedure can indicate tumors or spinal blockage resulting in a large pool of CSF, or hydrocephalus associated with large volumes of CSF.

===Cell count===
The presence of white blood cells in cerebrospinal fluid is called pleocytosis. A small number of monocytes can be normal; the presence of granulocytes is always an abnormal finding. A large number of granulocytes often heralds bacterial meningitis. White cells can also indicate reaction to repeated lumbar punctures, reactions to prior injections of medicines or dyes, central nervous system hemorrhage, leukemia, recent epileptic seizure, or a metastatic tumor. When peripheral blood contaminates the withdrawn CSF, a common procedural complication, white blood cells will be present along with erythrocytes, and their ratio will be the same as that in the peripheral blood.

The finding of erythrophagocytosis, where phagocytosed erythrocytes are observed, signifies haemorrhage into the CSF that preceded the lumbar puncture. Therefore, when erythrocytes are detected in the CSF sample, erythrophagocytosis suggests causes other than a traumatic tap, such as intracranial haemorrhage and haemorrhagic herpetic encephalitis. In which case, further investigations are warranted, including imaging and viral culture.

===Microbiology===
CSF can be sent to the microbiology lab for various types of smears and cultures to diagnose infections.
* Gram staining may demonstrate gram positive bacteria in bacterial meningitis.
* Microbiological culture is the gold standard for detecting bacterial meningitis. Bacteria, fungi, and viruses can all be cultured by using different techniques.
* Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been a great advance in the diagnosis of some types of meningitis, such as meningitis from herpesvirus and enterovirus. It has high sensitivity and specificity for many infections of the CNS, is fast, and can be done with small volumes of CSF. Even though testing is expensive, cost analyses of PCR testing in neonatal patients demonstrated savings via reduced cost of hospitalization.
* Numerous antibody-mediated tests for CSF are available in some countries: these include rapid tests for antigens of common bacterial pathogens, treponemal titers for the diagnosis of neurosyphilis and Lyme disease, &quot;Coccidioides&quot; antibody, and others.
* The India ink test is still used for detection of meningitis caused by &quot;Cryptococcus neoformans&quot;, but the cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) test has a higher sensitivity.

===Chemistry===
Several substances found in cerebrospinal fluid are available for diagnostic measurement.
* Glucose is present in the CSF; the level is usually about 60% that in the peripheral circulation. A fingerstick or venipuncture at the time of lumbar puncture may therefore be performed to assess peripheral glucose levels and determine a predicted CSF glucose value. Decreased glucose levels can indicate fungal, tuberculous or pyogenic infections; lymphomas; leukemia spreading to the meninges; meningoencephalitic mumps; or hypoglycemia. A glucose level of less than one third of blood glucose levels in association with low CSF lactate levels is typical in hereditary CSF glucose transporter deficiency also known as De Vivo disease.
* Increased glucose levels in the fluid can indicate diabetes, although the 60% rule still applies.
* Increased levels of glutamine are often involved with hepatic encephalopathies, Reye&#x27;s syndrome, hepatic coma, cirrhosis, hypercapnia and depression.
* Increased levels of lactate can occur the presence of cancer of the CNS, multiple sclerosis, heritable mitochondrial disease, low blood pressure, low serum phosphorus, respiratory alkalosis, idiopathic seizures, traumatic brain injury, cerebral ischemia, brain abscess, hydrocephalus, hypocapnia or bacterial meningitis.
* The enzyme lactate dehydrogenase can be measured to help distinguish meningitides of bacterial origin, which are often associated with high levels of the enzyme, from those of viral origin in which the enzyme is low or absent.
* Changes in total protein content of cerebrospinal fluid can result from pathologically increased permeability of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, obstructions of CSF circulation, meningitis, neurosyphilis, brain abscesses, subarachnoid hemorrhage, polio, collagen disease or Guillain–Barré syndrome, leakage of CSF, increases in intracranial pressure, or hyperthyroidism. Very high levels of protein may indicate tuberculous meningitis or spinal block.
* IgG synthetic rate is calculated from measured IgG and total protein levels; it is elevated in immune disorders such as multiple sclerosis, transverse myelitis, and neuromyelitis optica of Devic. Oligoclonal bands may be detected in CSF but not in serum, suggesting intrathecal antibody production.

==History==

The first technique for accessing the dural space was described by the London physician Walter Essex Wynter. In 1889 he developed a crude cut down with cannulation in four patients with tuberculous meningitis. The main purpose was the treatment of raised intracranial pressure rather than for diagnosis. The technique for needle lumbar puncture was then introduced by the German physician Heinrich Quincke, who credits Wynter with the earlier discovery; he first reported his experiences at an internal medicine conference in Wiesbaden, Germany, in 1891. He subsequently published a book on the subject.

The lumbar puncture procedure was taken to the United States by Arthur H. Wentworth an assistant professor at the Harvard Medical School, based at Children&#x27;s Hospital. In 1893 he published a long paper on diagnosing cerebrospinal meningitis by examining spinal fluid. However, he was criticized by antivivisectionists for having obtained spinal fluid from children. He was acquitted, but, nevertheless, he was uninvited from the then forming Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, where he would have been the first professor of pediatrics.

Historically lumbar punctures were also employed in the process of performing a pneumoencephalography, a nowadays obsolete X-ray imaging study of the brain that was performed extensively from the 1920s until the advent of modern non-invasive neuroimaging techniques such as MRI and CT in the 1970s. During this quite painful procedure, CSF was replaced with air or some other gas via the lumbar puncture in order to enhance the appearance of certain areas of the brain on plain radiographs.

<text>Parole, also known as provisional release, supervised release, or being on paper, is a form of early release of a prison inmate where the prisoner agrees to abide by behavioral conditions, including checking-in with their designated parole officers, or else they may be rearrested and returned to prison. 

Originating from the French word (&#x27;speech, spoken words&#x27; but also &#x27;promise&#x27;), the term became associated during the Middle Ages with the release of prisoners who gave their word. This differs greatly from pardon, amnesty or commutation of sentence in that parolees are still considered to be serving their sentences, and may be returned to prison if they violate the conditions of their parole. It is similar to probation, the key difference being that parole takes place after a prison sentence, while probation can be granted in lieu of a prison sentence.

==Modern development==
Alexander Maconochie, a Scottish geographer and captain in the Royal Navy, introduced the modern idea of parole when, in 1840, he was appointed superintendent of the British penal colonies in Norfolk Island, Australia. He developed a plan to prepare them for eventual return to society that involved three grades. The first two consisted of promotions earned through good behaviour, labour, and study. The third grade in the system involved conditional liberty outside of prison while obeying rules. A violation would return them to prison and they would start all over again through the ranks of the three-grade process. He reformed its ticket of leave system, instituting what many consider to be the world&#x27;s first parole system. Prisoners served indeterminate sentences from which they could be released early if they showed evidence of rehabilitation through participation in a graded classification system based on a unit of exchange called a mark. Prisoners earned marks through good behavior, lost them through bad behavior, and could spend them on passage to higher classification statuses ultimately conveying freedom.

In an instance of multiple discovery, in 1846, Arnould Bonneville de Marsangy proposed the idea of parole (which he termed &quot;preparatory liberations&quot;) to the Civil Tribunal at Reims.

==Canada==
In general, in Canada, prisoners are eligible to apply for full parole after serving one-third of their sentences. Prisoners are also eligible to apply for day parole, and can do this before being eligible to apply for full parole.

Any prisoner whose sentence is less than two years is sent to a correctional facility in the province or territory where they were convicted, whilst anyone sentenced to serve no less than two years will be sent to a federal correctional facility and will thus have to deal with the Parole Board of Canada.

Parole is an option for most prisoners. However, parole is not guaranteed, particularly for prisoners serving life or indeterminate sentences. In cases of first-degree murder, one can apply for parole after 25 years if convicted of a single murder. However, if convicted of multiple murders, either of the first or second-degree, the sentencing judge previously had the discretion to make parole ineligibility periods consecutive - thereby extending parole ineligibility beyond 25 years and, in rare cases, beyond a normal life-span. On May 27, 2022, the Supreme Court of Canada unanimously ruled that extending parole ineligibility beyond the statutorily mandated 25 years was unconstitutional for being &quot;cruel and unusual&quot; punishment.

==China==
In China, prisoners are often granted medical parole or compassionate release, which releases them on the grounds that they must receive medical treatment which cannot be provided for in prison. Occasionally, medical parole is used as a less public way of releasing a wrongly convicted prisoner.

The Chinese legal code has no explicit provision for exile, but often dissidents are released on the grounds that they need to be treated for a medical condition in another country, and with the understanding that they will be reincarcerated if they return to China. Dissidents who have been released on medical parole include Ngawang Chophel, Ngawang Sangdrol, Phuntsog Nyidron, Takna Jigme Zangpo, Wang Dan, Wei Jingsheng, Gao Zhan and Fang Lizhi.

== Israel ==
Until 2001, parole in Israel was possible only after the prisoner had served two thirds of their sentence. On 13 February 2001, the Knesset passed a bill, brought forward by Reuven Rivlin and David Libai, which allowed the early release of prisoners who had served half of their prison term (the so-called &quot;Deri Law&quot;). The law was originally intended to help ease overcrowding in prisons.

==Italy==

&quot;Libertà condizionata&quot; is covered by Article 176 of the Italian Penal Code. A prisoner is eligible if he has served at least 30 months (or 26 years for life sentences), and the time remaining on his sentence is less than half the total (normally), a quarter of the total (if previously convicted or never convicted) or five years (for sentences greater than 7.5 years). In 2006, 21 inmates were granted &quot;libertà condizionata&quot;.

==New Zealand==

In New Zealand, inmates serving a short sentence (up to two years) are automatically released after serving half their sentence, without a parole hearing. Inmates serving sentences of more than two years are normally seen by the New Zealand Parole Board after serving one-third of the sentence, although the judge at sentencing can make an order for a minimum non-parole period of up to two-thirds of the sentence. Inmates serving life sentences usually serve a minimum of 10 years, or longer depending on the minimum non-parole period, before being eligible for parole. Parole is not an automatic right and it was declined in 71 percent of hearings in the year ending 30 June 2010. Life imprisonment without the possibility of parole has been given only once, to Brenton Tarrant for the 2019 Christchurch mosque shootings.

==United Kingdom==

The Parole Boards in the UK are only involved in the release of prisoners with specific sentences. Indeterminate sentences (life imprisonment and imprisonment for public protection) are always handled by the Parole Board because they have no fixed release date. Some determinate or &quot;fixed&quot; sentences, such as extended determinate sentences, are also handled by the Parole Board, but for the majority of prisoners the Parole Board will not be involved in their release.

The conditions of release are called a licence, and parole is called &quot;release on licence&quot;. There are seven standard licence conditions for all prisoners:
# Be of good behaviour and not behave in a way which undermines the purpose of the licence period;
# Not commit any offence;
# Keep in touch with the supervising officer in accordance with instructions given by the supervising officer;
# Receive visits from the supervising officer in accordance with instructions given by the supervising officer;
# Reside permanently at an address approved by the supervising officer and obtain the prior permission of the supervising officer for any stay of one or more nights at a different address;
# Not undertake work, or a particular type of work, unless it is approved by the supervising officer and notify the supervising officer in advance of any proposal to undertake work or a particular type of work;
# Not travel outside the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, except with the prior permission of your supervising officer or for the purposes of immigration deportation or removal.

When a prisoner does not have to have their release approved by the Parole Board, further &quot;additional licence conditions&quot; may be suggested by the Probation Service and set by prison governors. When the Parole Board is involved, the Probation Service may suggest additional conditions, but the Parole Board is responsible for determining which additional conditions will be added to the licence. If an offender breaks any of these conditions, they can be &quot;recalled&quot; or returned to prison.

Since 2014 many of the probation and license monitoring functions have been carried out by private-sector &quot;community rehabilitation companies&quot; (CRCs) as well as the National Probation Service. In May 2019 the government announced that supervision of offenders, including supervision of offenders released on licence, would be re-nationalised. The decision was made following multiple criticisms of the system which led Chief probation inspector Dame Glenys Stacey to describe the system as &quot;irredeemably flawed&quot;.

==United States==
===Early history===
Penologist Zebulon Brockway introduced parole when he became superintendent of Elmira Reformatory in Elmira, New York. To manage prison populations and rehabilitate those incarcerated, he instituted a two-part strategy that consisted of indeterminate sentences and parole releases. This was significant in prison reform due to its implication that prisoners began their rehabilitation during incarceration, which would be recognizable by a parole board. It also provided newfound emphasis on prisoners&#x27; protection from cruel and unusual punishment.

===Modern history===
In some jurisdictions in the United States, courts may specify in a sentence how much time must be served before a prisoner is eligible for parole. This is often done by specifying an indeterminate sentence such as &quot;5 to 15 years&quot;, or &quot;15 years to life&quot;. The latter type is known as an indeterminate life sentence; in contrast, a sentence of &quot;life without the possibility of parole&quot; is known as a determinate life sentence.

On the federal level, Congress abolished parole in the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 (Pub. L. No. 98-473 § 218(a)(5), 98 Stat. 1837, 2027 [repealing 18 U.S.C.A. § 4201 et seq.]). Federal prisoners may, however, earn a maximum of 54 days good time credit per year against their sentence (18 U.S.C.A. § 3624(b)). At the time of sentencing, the federal judge may also specify a post-imprisonment period of supervised release. The U.S. Parole Commission still has jurisdiction over parole for those prisoners convicted of felonies in the District of Columbia and who are serving their sentences there, as well as over certain federally incarcerated military and international prisoners.

In most states, the decision of whether an inmate is paroled is vested in a paroling authority such as a parole board. Mere good conduct while incarcerated in and of itself does not necessarily guarantee that an inmate will be paroled. Other factors may enter into the decision to grant or deny parole, most commonly the establishment of a permanent residence and immediate, gainful employment or some other clearly visible means of self-support upon release (such as Social Security if the prisoner is old enough to qualify). Depending upon the jurisdiction, the parole board may look at various factors such as the inmate&#x27;s criminal history, participation in rehabilitation, education, or vocational programs, expressions of remorse, admissions of guilt, and insight (in the psychiatric sense) into the factors driving the inmate&#x27;s decision to commit the crimes at issue (in order to estimate the likelihood that the inmate may reoffend upon encountering similar factors in the outside world after release). Many states now permit sentences of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole (such as for murder and espionage), but any prisoner not sentenced to such sentences or the death penalty will eventually have the right to petition for release (one stateAlaskamaintains neither the death penalty nor life imprisonment without parole as sentencing options).

Before being granted the privilege of parole, the inmate meets with members of the parole board and is interviewed. The parolee also has a psychological examination. If parole is granted, the inmate must first agree to abide by the conditions of parole set by the paroling authority. While in prison, the inmate signs a parole certificate or contract. On this contract are the conditions that the inmate must follow. These conditions usually require the parolee to meet regularly with his or her parole officer or community corrections agent, who assesses the behavior and adjustment of the parolee and determines whether the parolee is violating any of his or her terms of release (typically these include being at home during certain hours which is called a curfew, maintaining steady employment, not , refraining from illicit drug use and, sometimes, abstaining from alcohol, attending addiction treatment or counseling, and having no contact with their victim). The inmate gives an address which is verified by parole officers as valid before the inmate is released to parole supervision.

Upon release, the parolee goes to a parole office and is assigned a parole officer. Parole officers make unannounced visits to parolees&#x27; houses or apartments to check on them. During these home visits officers look for signs of drug or alcohol use, guns or illegal weapons, and other illegal activities. Should parolees start to use drugs or alcohol, they are told to go to drug or alcohol counseling and Narcotics Anonymous or Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Should they not comply with conditions on the parole certificate (including abstention from voting) a warrant is issued for their arrest. Their parole time is stopped when the warrant is issued and starts only after they are arrested. They have a parole violation hearing within a specified time, and then a decision is made by the parole board to revoke their parole or continue the parolee on parole. In some cases, a parolee may be discharged from parole before the time called for in the original sentence if it is determined that the parole restrictions are no longer necessary for the protection of society (this most frequently occurs when elderly parolees are involved).

Service members who commit crimes while in the U.S. military may be subject to court martial proceedings under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). If found guilty, they may be sent to federal or military prisons and upon release may be supervised by U.S. Federal Probation officers.

Parole in the United States has proven to be politically divisive. Beginning from the initiation of the war on drugs in the 1970s, politicians began to advertise their &quot;tough on crime&quot; stances, encouraging a tightening of penal policy and resulting in longer sentences for what were previously referred to as minor drug violations. During elections, politicians whose administrations parole any large number of prisoners (or, perhaps, one notorious criminal) are typically attacked by their opponents as being &quot;soft on crime&quot;. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, at least sixteen states have removed the option of parole entirely, and four more have abolished parole for certain violent offenders. However, during the rise of mass incarceration in the 1970s, the states that continued to use parole and indeterminate sentencing contributed more to rising incarceration rates than those without parole boards. Said states implemented a dramatic decrease of parole releases, which inevitably resulted in longer sentences for more prisoners. From 1980 to 2009, indeterminate sentencing states made up nine of the ten states with the highest incarceration rate.

Starting in the 1980s, parole was revisited as a method once again to manage prison populations and as financial motivation to prevent further budget straining. The new approach to parole release was accompanied with the growth of a mass surveillance state. The supervision practices of increased drug testing, intensive supervision, unannounced visits and home confinement are widely used today. Additionally, a growing condition of parole was to assume the role of informant towards frequently surveilled communities.

The Great Recession of 2008 coupled with the Twin Towers attack on September 11, 2001 contributed to the public emphasis on the war on terror and eventually led to a trend of lowering incarceration. In fact, presidential politics between 2001 and 2012 were, for the first time in ten years, not focused on domestic crime control and even saw the promotion of the Second Chance Act by George W. Bush, who used the act to pledge federal money for reentry as a symbol of his &quot;compassionate conservatism&quot;.

=== Debates and reform efforts ===
Since the 1990s, parole and indeterminate sentencing have been the focus of debate in the United States with some emphasizing reform of the parole system and others calling for its abolishment altogether. These debates are fueled by a growing scholarship that criticizes U.S. parole boards and also the parole system more broadly.

Parole boards are seen as lacking in efficient qualifications and too politicized in the appointment process. The decision for granting parole has been criticized for neglecting the due process of prisoners on a case-by-case basis. Additionally, the process for being granted a commutation has been criticized, as many prisoners have been denied a commutation for not showing the right amount of &quot;remorse&quot; or proving substantially that they were ready to contribute again, which are aspects that many argue are too normative and subjective.

Most agree that, as was originally intended, the parole system puts a necessary focus on rehabilitation, despite its current problems which are widely debated. Critics note that it is becoming more and more expensive to the taxpayer, with little evidence of successful rehabilitation for prisoners. The conditions of parole themselves are often attacked as well, critiqued for being overwhelmingly criminogenic and perpetuating mass surveillance and a permanent state of imprisonment that does little to ensure a smooth reentry into society. Critics note that greater discretion is required to decide which parolees require costly supervisory resources and which ones do not, rather than placing digital, physical, and structural restrictions on every parolee.

The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) stated in 2005 that about 45% of parolees completed their sentences successfully, while 38% were returned to prison, and 11% absconded. These statistics, the DOJ says, are relatively unchanged since 1995; even so, some states (including New York) have abolished parole altogether for violent felons, and the federal government abolished it in 1984 for all offenders convicted of a federal crime, whether violent or not. Despite the decline in jurisdictions with a functioning parole system, the average annual growth of parolees was an increase of about 1.6% per year between 1995 and 2002.

A variant of parole is known as &quot;time off for good behavior&quot;, or, colloquially, &quot;good time&quot;. Unlike the traditional form of parolewhich may be granted or denied at the discretion of a parole boardtime off for good behavior is automatic absent a certain number (or gravity) of infractions committed by a convict while incarcerated (in most jurisdictions the released inmate is placed under the supervision of a parole officer for a certain amount of time after being so released). In some cases &quot;good time&quot; can reduce the original sentence by as much as one-half. It is usually not made available to inmates serving life sentences, as there is no release date that can be moved up.

===Difference from mandatory supervision===
Some states in the United States have what is known as &quot;mandatory supervision&quot;, whereby an inmate is released before the completion of their sentence due to legal technicalities which oblige the offender justice system to free them. In the federal prison system, and in some states such as Texas, inmates are compensated with &quot;good time&quot;, which is counted towards time served. For example, if an inmate served five years of a ten-year prison term, and also had five years of &quot;good time&quot;, they will have completed their sentence &quot;on paper&quot;, obliging the state to release them unless deemed a threat to society in writing by the parole board. Where parole is granted or denied at the discretion of a parole board, mandatory supervision does not involve a decision making process: one either qualifies for it or does not. Mandatory supervision tends to involve stipulations that are more lenient than those of parole, and in some cases place no obligations at all on the individual being released.

===Immigration===

In US immigration law, the term &quot;parole&quot; has two meanings related to allowing persons to enter or leave the United States without the normally required documentation.

==Impact==
According to a review of the academic literature by economist Jennifer Doleac, reductions in parole supervision was one of the most cost-effective ways to improve the reintegration and rehabilitation of the formerly-incarcerated.

==Prisoners of war==
Parole is &quot;the agreement of persons who have been taken prisoner by an enemy that they will not again take up arms against those who captured them, either for a limited time or during the continuance of the war.&quot; The US Department of Defense defines parole more broadly: &quot;Parole agreements are promises given the captor by a POW to fulfill stated conditions, such as not to bear arms or not to escape, in consideration of special privileges, such as release from captivity or lessened restraint.&quot;

The practice of paroling enemy troops began thousands of years ago, at least as early as the time of Carthage. Parole allowed the prisoners&#x27; captors to avoid the burdens of having to feed and care for them while still avoiding having the prisoners rejoin their old ranks once released; it could also allow the captors to recover their own men in a prisoner exchange. Hugo Grotius, an early international lawyer, favorably discussed prisoner of war parole. During the American Civil War, both the Dix–Hill Cartel and the Lieber Code set out rules regarding prisoner of war parole. Francis Lieber&#x27;s thoughts on parole later reappeared in the Declaration of Brussels of 1874, the Hague Convention, and the Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War.

In the United States, current policy prohibits US military personnel who are prisoners of war from accepting parole. The Code of the United States Fighting Force states: &quot;I will accept neither parole nor special favors from the enemy.&quot; The position is reiterated by the Department of Defense. &quot;The United States does not authorize any Military Service member to sign or enter into any such parole agreement.&quot;

<doc id="342306" wikidata="Q287817" url="?curid=342306" title="Jason Donovan">
<text>Jason Sean Donovan (born 1 June 1968) is an Australian actor and singer. He initially achieved fame in the Australian soap &quot;Neighbours&quot;, playing Scott Robinson, before beginning a career in music in 1988. In the UK he has sold over 3 million records. His debut album &quot;Ten Good Reasons&quot; was the highest-selling album in the UK in 1989, with sales of over 1.5 million. He has had four UK No. 1 singles. He has also appeared in several stage musicals, most prominently in the lead role of &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot; in the early 1990s.

==Early life==
Jason Donovan was born on Saturday, 1 June 1968 in the Melbourne suburb Malvern, Victoria. He is the son of Australian actress Sue McIntosh (née Menlove) and British-born veteran stage and television actor Terence Donovan (who also appeared in &quot;Neighbours&quot;) who has English and Irish heritage. Following his parents&#x27; separation and divorce, his father was awarded full custody of him in 1973 and brought him up on his own. He attended De La Salle College Malvern.

==Career==
===1980–1989: Television career and &quot;Neighbours&quot;===
Donovan made his first television appearance at age 11 in a guest role on the Australian series &quot;Skyways&quot; in 1980. In the episode, his on-screen sister was played by future &quot;Neighbours&quot; co-star Kylie Minogue. He also appeared in the series &quot;I Can Jump Puddles&quot; (1981) and &quot;Golden Pennies&quot; (1985), before entering the cast of &quot;Neighbours&quot; in 1986 as Scott Robinson (replacing actor Darius Perkins, who had played the role for the first year of the series). His character&#x27;s story arcs included an onscreen romance and wedding to Charlene Mitchell (played by Minogue), and helped boost the show&#x27;s popularity with British as well as Australian audiences.

He won his first Logie Award for &quot;Best New Talent&quot; in 1987 and received a commendation in the category &quot;Performance by a Male Actor In a Series&quot; from the Television Society of Australia&#x27;s Penguin Awards. In 1988 he was awarded the Silver Logie for the &quot;Most Popular Actor&quot; on Australian television.

In addition to his regular role in &quot;Neighbours&quot;, Donovan appeared as &quot;Happy Houston&quot; in the 1988 Australian World War II mini-series &quot;The Heroes&quot;, based on the historical novel by Ronald McKie. He won the 1990 Logie Award for &quot;Most Popular Actor in a Mini-Series&quot;.

Donovan left &quot;Neighbours&quot; in 1989. Twenty years later, he said that he had been asked to return to tie in with the show&#x27;s 25th anniversary in 2010, but was unable to do so due to other work commitments.

===1988–1991: Pop career===
While he was still appearing in &quot;Neighbours&quot;, Donovan followed Minogue (who had already left the series by this point) by pursuing a pop career. His early exploration of music included recording a demo written by pub rock band Noiseworks, and he was offered the chance to record the song &quot;Waiting for a Star To Fall&quot;, later a hit for Boy Meets Girl.

However he followed Minogue by signing a recording contract with Mushroom Records in Australia, and with PWL in the UK. Although the production team of Stock Aitken Waterman (SAW) initially resisted working with Donovan, fearing recording with a second &quot;Neighbours&quot; star would be &quot;too tacky&quot;, the trio quickly warmed to him, recording his first single, &quot;Nothing Can Divide Us&quot;, after it was rejected by Rick Astley. The track was released in 1988, reaching number five in the UK and number three in Australia.

Donovan&#x27;s next single, a duet with Minogue, &quot;Especially for You&quot;, was released in late November 1988. While the idea for a duet was at first rejected by SAW, who felt it too commercial, the producers changed their minds when retail chain Woolworths ordered 250,000 copies of the record. Donovan agreed to the duet with Minogue without reservation, feeling it would be good for his career. After spending four weeks at No. 2 in the UK, it hit No. 1 in January 1989. It was the fourth-highest selling single in the UK in 1988, and 17th in Australia for 1989. The track became SAW&#x27;s biggest ever hit in the UK, ultimately selling in excess of one million copies. The issue of UK pop magazine &quot;Smash Hits&quot; that featured Minogue and Donovan on the cover to promote the release also sold one million copies. The song was accompanied by a widely noted image change for Donovan, who shed his trademark &quot;Neighbours&quot; mullet for a contemporary undercut.

Donovan&#x27;s next single, &quot;Too Many Broken Hearts&quot;, reached number one in the UK in March 1989. The singer said he initially had no idea the song would go on to be so successful, and thought it might just be an album track. He confessed to at first being underwhelmed by the video, and was surprised by the ecstatic response it earned at his label. However, he now regards the track as one of SAW&#x27;s best songs, as well as being his defining hit.

He released his début album, &quot;Ten Good Reasons&quot;, in May 1989, which also reached number one (for three weeks). For two weeks, Donovan held the number one positions in the singles chart and the albums chart simultaneously, when his next single, a cover of Brian Hyland&#x27;s &quot;Sealed With a Kiss&quot;, entered the UK charts at number one.

In December 1989, he took part in Band Aid II&#x27;s version of &quot;Do They Know it&#x27;s Christmas&quot;, which also included Minogue, whose exit from &quot;Neighbours&quot; had by now been shown on screen in both Australia and the UK. His own exit from the show had by this stage been shown on Australian television, although it was not aired on British television until several months later.

Donovan released his second album, &quot;Between The Lines&quot;, in May 1990, again produced by Stock Aitken Waterman. He had greater creative input on the record, asking for more material that was within his range, after he struggled with some of the vocal requirements of certain songs on his debut album. He has stated that he believes the album&#x27;s consistent lyrical themes of heartbreak and relationship breakdowns were references by songwriters SAW to his then recent split from Kylie Minogue.

Although the album reached Platinum status in the UK, it was less successful than his debut a year before, peaking at no. 2 and selling only a fifth as many copies. Assessing the performance of the album, Donovan concluded that while it was artistically a much stronger record than his debut album, he felt it was impossible to match the very high UK sales of &quot;Ten Good Reasons&quot;.

Five singles were released from the second album, and although they all reached the UK Top 30, they also signalled a decline in his popularity. Between 1988 and 1992, Donovan garnered 16 Top 40 hit singles in the UK.

Speaking of the album&#x27;s commercial performance, Donovan said: &quot;&quot;Between the Lines&quot; wasn&#x27;t the successful record that &quot;Ten Good Reasons&quot; was, but how do you match that? &quot;Ten Good Reason&quot;&#x27;s was just a moment in time.&quot; He also added that he accepted at the time that &quot;every bubble has to burst&quot;, and he knew he&#x27;d have to prioritise evolving his career.

Donovan then embarked on an extensive world tour in 1990, The &quot;Doin&#x27; Fine Tour&quot;, against the wishes of his label, which wanted him available for promotional duties. The tour covered the UK, Ireland, mainland Europe, Australia, Singapore and other parts of South East Asia. The Dublin concert was recorded and released on VHS in 1990; and released on DVD in 2010.

While the decision to tour upset Pete Waterman and Donovan&#x27;s record label, the singer credits the live shows with ensuring his longevity as a stage performer, after Andrew Lloyd Webber attended one of the shows and was impressed with his performance.

Donovan continued to act alongside his pop career, and in 1990 he appeared in his first feature film, &quot;Blood Oath&quot; (released in some countries as &quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot;).

===1991–1993: Stage career and &quot;The Face&quot; lawsuit===
With his 1991 single &quot;R.S.V.P.&quot; underperforming on the charts, and his wish to evolve his music towards a more adult, Happy Mondays-inspired sound rejected by Pete Waterman, Donovan was keen to find a new path forward. Donovan&#x27;s management felt a return to acting was a way to transition, as his &quot;shelf life as a pop star was coming to an end.&quot;

He accepted the lead role in the restaged London Palladium version of &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot;, directed by Steven Pimlott. Donovan had his third solo UK No. 1 single with one of its songs, &quot;Any Dream Will Do&quot;. Donovan left the production in early 1992.

In 1992, Donovan launched a libel action against &quot;The Face&quot; magazine which had published allegations that he was homosexual. Donovan won £200,000 in damages and the magazine had to pay a further £100,000 in costs, but the lawsuit created a backlash with people accusing him of being homophobic. Although he had been a mild drug user who had smoked cannabis joints up until this point, in the months after his libel action Donovan began using cocaine. In a 2007 &quot;Marie Claire&quot; interview, and also in his 2007 autobiography &quot;Between The Lines: My Story Uncut&quot;, Donovan stated that suing &quot;The Face&quot; was the biggest mistake of his life.

Donovan moved to Polydor Records and released his third album, &quot;All Around The World&quot; (1993). The recording sessions had been fraught, with the record company unhappy with its initial production style, and Donovan&#x27;s new theatrical singing style, requiring significant re-recording. The album was unsuccessful, failing to reach the UK Top 20 and was not released at all in his native Australia. His contract with Polydor was not extended and it would be Donovan&#x27;s last album for 15 years.

===1995–1999: Drug addiction, &quot;The Last Bullet&quot; and continued musical work===
Donovan later admitted that by 1995 he had a serious drug problem, taking around three grams (1/10 oz) of cocaine a day. In early 1995, he attended model Kate Moss&#x27;s 21st birthday party at The Viper Room in Los Angeles, where he suffered a drug overdose.

Later in 1995, Donovan starred in the Australian TV film &quot;The Last Bullet&quot; with Koji Tamaki, directed by Michael Pattison, which was set in World War II on the Pacific island of Borneo.

In 1998, Donovan took the lead role of Dr. Frank N. Furter in the UK touring production of &quot;The Rocky Horror Show,&quot; where he met stage manager Angela Malloch. After the pair had a brief relationship, Malloch became pregnant and gave Donovan an ultimatum that he had to kick drugs once and for all if he wanted to be part of their child&#x27;s life.

In late 1999, Donovan stated that he still used cocaine, saying: &quot;I still have a joint and I still take coke, but not as much as I did two years ago.&quot; In 2011, he stated that he has been drug-free since 2000, the year his first child was born.

===2000–2006: Fatherhood, &quot;MDA&quot; and participation in &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...&quot;===
Donovan&#x27;s daughter Jemma Donovan was born in March 2000. Since then, with his drug problems now under control, he continued to act on stage and television, and had a role in the medical-legal television drama &quot;MDA&quot; (2003–05), on Australia&#x27;s ABC network. Since 2003, Donovan has also lent his voice to the &quot;Buzz!&quot; series of quiz video games.

In late 2004, he was headlining in the stage musical &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot; at the London Palladium. He finished his original run on 13 March 2005, but was then invited back from June onwards to play in the final two months of the show, until its closure on 4 September 2005. Following this, he has toured the UK performing a few gigs and returned to the stage in January 2006 to star in a UK tour of Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot;. After this, he returned to Melbourne to star in David Eldrige&#x27;s Australian transfer of the London drama &quot;Festen&quot;.

In 2005, Donovan&#x27;s mobile phone number was circulated around the web in Australia, due to an image that was taken in Sydney. It appeared that Donovan was trying to sell his car, and unwittingly released his mobile phone number to the public. From 10 September, his answering machine had a special message on it, because he was frustrated by the number of calls he was receiving. Virgin placed advertisements in several high-profile Australian newspapers, urging people not to call Donovan, one of their customers. Virgin Mobile later admitted that the photos were part of a marketing ploy. Virgin also ran TV advertisements showing Donovan answering prank calls, asking the viewer not to call him, then displaying his number.

Donovan took part in &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!&quot; in 2006 and finished in 3rd place. He took part in many Bushtucker Trials, which included wearing a helmet full of insects and playing a giant game of &quot;Operation&quot;. Donovan lost out on the King of the Jungle Crown to Matt Willis. Despite his loss, during an interview on &quot;The Steve Wright Show&quot; on BBC Radio 2 (January 2008), he said that his appearance on &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...&quot; had revitalised his career.

===2007–2009: Return to music career and soap operas===

Donovan performed a medley of songs from &quot;Joseph&quot; along with other actors who have played the eponymous role (Donny Osmond and Lee Mead) at the Concert for Diana in July 2007.

In early 2008, Donovan had a role in ITV&#x27;s post-watershed soap opera &quot;Echo Beach&quot;; the series was cancelled after 12 episodes. He also presented &quot;Sunday Night with Jason Donovan&quot;, a programme on The One Network of British local radio stations.

On 25 September 2008, Donovan performed in the canteen at the head offices of Tesco in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire. He was promoting his forthcoming album, &quot;Let It Be Me&quot;, which was released on 10 November 2008. The album, his first for 15 years, reached No. 28 in the UK.

In 2009, Donovan performed as Tick (Mitzi) in the London stage musical production of &quot;Priscilla Queen of the Desert&quot; at the Palace Theatre. Also in 2009, Donovan began appearing in television commercials (with Kerry Katona and Coleen Nolan) for the frozen food supermarket chain Iceland in the UK.

===2010–2013: &quot;Soundtrack of the 80s&quot;, &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; and &quot;Sign of Your Love&quot;===
In September 2010, Donovan took part in the BBC television series &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;, tracing his family tree back several generations. Donovan&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Soundtrack of the 80s&quot;, was released in October 2010. The album is composed of cover versions of well known 1980s hits such as &quot;Drive&quot; (The Cars), &quot;(I Just) Died in Your Arms&quot; (Cutting Crew) and &quot;Sign Your Name&quot; (Terence Trent D&#x27;Arby) and several others. The same year, Donovan played the role of The Artilleryman in the 2010–2011 stage show &quot;Jeff Wayne&#x27;s Musical Version of The War of the Worlds&quot;. The show toured the UK and Europe, starting in November 2010 and finished in Germany in January 2011. Donovan also voiced the part of Toby the Kangaroo in the environmental animated film &quot;Animals United&quot;.

In February 2011, Donovan appeared on the BBC series &quot;Ready, Steady, Cook&quot;. Later in 2011, he performed on the Here and Now Tour, and also toured in a production of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; playing Captain Von Trapp. The production co-starred Verity Rushworth as Maria. From September 2011, Donovan took part in the ninth series of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;. He was partnered with dancer Kristina Rihanoff and finished third in the competition. Donovan presented a voice-tracked radio show on Heart each Sunday from 10am to 12noon. Donovan temporarily left the station in 2013 

In March 2012, Donovan released a new album of covers, &quot;Sign Of Your Love&quot;, which peaked at number 36 in the UK Albums Chart. In May 2012, Donovan was interviewed by Piers Morgan on the ITV series &quot;Piers Morgan&#x27;s Life Stories&quot;, in which he talked openly about his career, his past, his former relationship with Kylie Minogue, and his battle with drugs. During the interview, Donovan also admitted that he&#x27;d undergone hair transplantation to counteract his thinning hair. In summer 2012, he appeared as a judge on ITV&#x27;s talent search show &quot;Superstar&quot;. In late 2012, Donovan again toured the UK and Europe in a new version of &quot;Jeff Wayne&#x27;s War of the Worlds&quot;, this time playing Parson Nathaniel.

In 2013, Donovan reprised his role as Tick/Mitzi in the UK national touring production of &quot;Priscilla, Queen of the Desert&quot;. On 5 May 2013, Donovan was heard narrating Pick TV&#x27;s budget version of &quot;Rude Tube&quot;, entitled &quot;Video Surf&quot;. Donovan revealed in January 2015 that he was invited to return to &quot;Neighbours&quot; for the show&#x27;s 30th anniversary celebrations, but he declined the offer, adding &quot;it&#x27;s just not something I want to do&quot;. However, he agreed to take part in the documentary special &quot;Neighbours 30th: The Stars Reunite&quot;, which aired in Australia and the UK in March 2015.

===2015–2019: Radio, Tours and &quot;Joseph&quot; return===
Since 2015, Donovan has presented Jason Donovan&#x27;s 80s Rewind (known as All 80s from 2015 to 2017) on Heart Radio, which airs on Sunday evenings from 7pm until 10pm.

In 2016, Donovan toured the UK with his &quot;Ten Good Reasons and Greatest Hits&quot; Tour.

In 2017, Heart 80s Radio was launched and he began presenting Sunday Mornings from 9am to 12noon in addition to his 80s Rewind Sunday Evening Show on Heart. In December 2017 it was announced that in the new year Donovan would be taking his second break from his radio shows. 

In summer 2019, Donovan returned to the London Palladium in a new production of &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot;, this time playing the Pharaoh alongside Sheridan Smith as the Narrator and Jac Yarrow as Joseph.

===2020–present: &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot; and &quot;Neighbours&quot; finale===
For Christmas 2020, Donovan was due to make his pantomime debut as The Evil Ringmaster in &quot;Goldilocks and the Three Bears&quot; at the Birmingham Hippodrome, however due to the COVID-19 pandemic the panto was postponed to Christmas 2021.

In 2021, Donavan competed in the thirteenth series of &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot;, paired with Alexandra Schauman. However, he withdrew from the competition in week 6 due to a back injury.

In July 2022, Donovan returned as Scott to &quot;Neighbours&quot; for a one-off cameo appearance (alongside Kylie Minogue as Charlene) for what was believed (at the time) to be the show&#x27;s final ever episode. Subsequently, Amazon announced that they had picked up the series for their Freevee streaming service, and Amazon started filming the revived series in April 2023.

From August 2024 Jason Donovan started playing the role of Frank-N-Furter in the touring UK stage show of The Rocky Horror Show. 

==Personal life==
Donovan is married to Angela Malloch, with whom he has three children. They live in West London and Oxfordshire. Donovan&#x27;s half-sister is former &quot;Neighbours&quot; star Stephanie McIntosh. Although he is estranged from his mother, he is close with his maternal grandmother and other relatives.

Donovan was the subject of an episode of the BBC TV series &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; on 30 August 2010 in which he discovered he is a descendant of the pioneer William Cox, who built the first road across Australia&#x27;s Blue Mountains in 1814. Donovan confirmed he is Jewish through his maternal great-grandmother, Eileen Dawson (née Lyons).

Donovan was in a relationship with Kylie Minogue from 1986 to 1989.

<text>Network 10 (commonly known as the 10 Network, Channel 10 or simply 10) is an Australian commercial television network. It is owned by Ten Network Holdings, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Paramount Global&#x27;s UK &amp; Australia division and is one of the five national free-to-air networks in the country.

As of 2024, Network 10 is usually the fourth-rated television network and primary channel in Australia, behind the Seven Network, Nine Network and ABC TV and ahead of SBS.

==History==
===Origins===
From the introduction of TV in 1956 until 1965, there were three television networks in Australia, the National Television Network (now the Nine Network), the Australian Television Network (now the Seven Network), and the public ABC National Television Service (now ABC TV). In the early 1960s, the Australian Government began canvassing the idea of licensing a third commercial television station in each capital city. This decision was seen by some as a way for the government to defuse growing public dissatisfaction with the dominance of imported overseas programming and the paucity of local content. The first of these third licences was granted to United Telecasters (a consortium of Amalgamated Wireless, Colonial Sugar Refining Company, Email, Bank of New South Wales and the NRMA) on 4 April 1963.

Structurally, the Australian television industry was closely modelled on the two-tiered system that had been in place in Australian radio since the late 1930s. One tier consisted of a network of publicly funded television stations run by the ABC, which was funded by government budget allocation and (until 1972) by fees from television viewer licences. The second tier consisted of the commercial networks and independent stations owned by private operators, whose income came from selling advertising time.

===Launch===
The network was launched as ATV-0 in Melbourne opened on 1 August 1964 and was owned by the Ansett Transport Industries, which at the time owned one of Australia&#x27;s two domestic airlines. TEN-10 in Sydney, which opened on 5 April 1965, was originally owned by United Telecasters, which also in July that year opened TVQ-0 in Brisbane. Also opened later that month was SAS-10, serving the city of Adelaide.

The new television network was initially dubbed the Independent Television System or ITS, but in 1970 adopted the title The 0-10 Network, which reflected the channels used by the first two stations launched in the group, ATV and TEN.

Melbourne&#x27;s ATV was the first station of the network to stage colour broadcasts in 1967, the broadcast was that of the horse races in Pakenham, Victoria, which was seen by network and RCA executives and invited members of the media and press. This would be the first of many test colour telecasts for the station, and in tribute to this event, the 0-10 Network adopted the &quot;First in Colour&quot; slogan in 1974, within months before the 1 March 1975 transition to colour broadcasting.

===1970–1988: Expansion and original run===
For its first five years, the 0-10 Network led a hand-to-mouth existence. By the beginning of the 1970s the network was in a precarious financial position and there were predictions that it would fail.

In 1971, the 0-10 Network first aired &quot;Young Talent Time&quot;, which was a huge rating success, and ran for 17 years.

However, the network&#x27;s true financial reprise came about due to the fact that the controversial adult soap opera serial &quot;Number 96&quot; premiered in March 1972 on the night that &quot;Australian TV lost its virginity&quot;. The series broke new ground for Australian television and captured the imagination of viewers like few programs before or since. For the next three years it was consistently Australia&#x27;s top-rating television program and, not surprisingly, its huge popularity attracted advertisers to Ten &quot;en masse&quot;, with the result that its revenue increased significantly from $1 million in 1971 to more than $10 million in 1972.

However, the pattern of rating dominance was already set, and for most of the next five decades from the mid-1960s, there was little deviation from the prevalent rankings, with the Nine Network typically in the first place, the Seven Network second, 0-10 third and ABC TV fourth.

The gradual evolution of Network Ten into its current form has its origins in the ongoing attempts by media mogul Rupert Murdoch to acquire a prized commercial television licence in Australia&#x27;s largest capital city market, Sydney. This began when Murdoch&#x27;s News Limited purchased the Wollongong station WIN-4 in the early 1960s, around the same time he bought Festival Records. In 1977, frustrated by regulatory blocks that prevented him from expanding into the Sydney market, Murdoch sold WIN and purchased a 46% share in Ten Sydney.

In 1979, Murdoch made an unsuccessful takeover bid for the Melbourne-based The Herald and Weekly Times media group, which originally owned HSV-7. Although the bid failed, he gained a 50% stake in Ansett, which thus gave him control of channel 0 in Melbourne.

In 1979, 0-10 first aired the soap opera &quot;Prisoner&quot;, which was a huge rating success.

On 20 January 1980, the 0-10 Network became known as Network Ten to reflect ATV moving from channel 0 to channel 10 – although the Brisbane station continued to broadcast as TVQ-0 until 10 September 1988 when the station changed to TVQ-10. In 1987 Adelaide&#x27;s Network Ten affiliate (SAS-10) and Seven Network affiliate (ADS-7) successfully negotiated to exchange affiliation rights and channel frequencies due to ownership problems. On 27 December 1987, the exchange came into effect and ADS-7, owned by the same owners as the main Network Ten stations, became ADS-10 with SAS-10 converting to SAS-7, operated by TVW-7 in Perth.

When Murdoch became an American citizen in 1985 so that he could expand his media empire in the United States with the Fox network, Australia&#x27;s media ownership laws obliged him to dispose of the flagship television stations, which were sold to The Northern Star, an offshoot of the Westfield Group conglomerate controlled by property tycoon Frank Lowy. However, Westfield was badly hit by the stock market crash of 1987, and in 1989 sold Network Ten to a consortium led by Charles Curran and former television journalist Steve Cosser.

The network became fully national in 1988 with the launch of NEW-10 in Perth after the introduction of satellite facilities made it economical for the network to broadcast to Western Australia. Northern Star officially took hold of TVQ-10 later in the year because of swapping frequencies with neighbouring DDQ-0 in Toowoomba and rebranded CTC Canberra under the network banner in time for aggregation.

===1989–1994: Receivership and relaunch===

In 1989, Ten&#x27;s ratings were in decline, so on 23 July 1989, recently recruited network boss Bob Shanks relaunched the network, re-branding it as 10 TV Australia, and introducing several new programs, including four new prime time game shows. However, by the end of 1989, the ratings failed to improve and most of the new programs were cancelled, except for its &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; bulletins, &quot;Neighbours&quot; and &quot;E Street&quot; (debuting in late 1988).

Meanwhile, Northern Star Holdings were having financial and regulatory problems. The company was subject to an inquiry by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal in relation to media ownership rules and had run into financial difficulties following the 1987 stock market crash two years earlier. On 1 September 1989, Northern Star Holdings announced a major restructuring to pay off debts and help restore profitability. The proposals included selling off the network&#x27;s three smaller stations (ADS in Adelaide, NEW in Perth and CTC in Canberra) to Charles Curran&#x27;s &quot;Capital Television Group&quot;. The sale was completed on 27 October 1989, effectively splitting Northern Star&#x27;s Network Ten in half.

In September 1990, Northern Star went into receivership and on 13 January 1991 at 8:30pm, the network was re-branded back to Network Ten with the first version of its famous &quot;ten&quot; watermark logo. The network was placed into liquidation by the New South Wales Rugby League in May 1991. In 1992, the network&#x27;s flagship stations were sold to the Canadian-based Canwest media group, which held a controlling stake in the network until 2009. Also in 1992, the network commenced a strategy of targeting younger audiences. The Adelaide and Perth stations were re-acquired by the network in 1995.

===1995–2007: Recovery and success===
With the network having financially recovered, Ten Network Holdings floated on the Australian Stock Exchange in 1998. At this time, Ten had affiliate broadcasting agreements with Southern Cross Broadcasting in southern New South Wales, regional Victoria and Tasmania, and with Telecasters Australia in northern New South Wales and regional Queensland.

In 2001, Ten opened the doors to the &quot;Big Brother Australia&quot; house and, with it, reality television. The opening night of &quot;Big Brother&quot; became the most-watched program of the night. &quot;Big Brother&quot; became synonymous with the network in the 2000s, with the series lasting 8 season. Even after iterations on rival networks, &quot;Big Brother&quot; is set to return to 10 in 2025. The trend was then followed by the launching of the Australian version of the reality singing competition format Idols called &quot;Australian Idol&quot; in 2003. &quot;Australian Idol&quot; was a hit for several years, lasting until 2009.

In 2004, Network Ten enjoyed its best year since the 1970s, winning two rating weeks (out of 40) and finishing second nationally only behind the Nine Network and well ahead of the Seven Network. This was a departure from previous years; it has typically placed third behind Nine and Seven in most other rating years since 2000.

In 2005, Canwest was in discussions with newspaper publisher John Fairfax Holdings about a possible sale of the network, after the federal government indicated it may consider relaxing Australia&#x27;s media cross-ownership laws. Previously, newspaper owners could not own television stations in the same city. Fairfax owned the Seven Network until 1988 and had been looking for a way back into television for a long time.

On 21 August 2005, the network celebrated its 40th birthday with a two-hour highlights package called &quot;Ten: Seriously 40&quot;, which was hosted by Bert Newton and Rove McManus.

On 27 October 2005, Network Ten announced that its long-running morning talk-variety program &quot;Good Morning Australia&quot; would be cancelled at the end of the year after a fourteen-year run. This ended host Bert Newtons 14-year association with Network Ten; although he was offered ongoing employment with the network, he announced that he would be returning to the Nine Network. &quot;9am with David &amp; Kim&quot; replaced GMA as Ten&#x27;s national morning program from 2006 to 2009.

From 2006 to 2008, Ten was the official broadcaster of Sydney New Year&#x27;s Eve. The rights returned to the Nine Network from 2009.

On 7 August 2007, Network Ten and Foxtel signed a new agreement allowing Ten&#x27;s digital signal to be transmitted via Foxtel&#x27;s cable and satellite services. Prior to this, Ten was only transmitted via cable on Foxtel in an analogue format and Austar in standard definition digital via Mystar. Similarly in October 2007, Network Ten and Optus announced that Ten&#x27;s digital signal would be available on its cable network from 1 December 2007.

On 16 December 2007, Ten HD was officially launched as a breakaway channel, becoming the first new commercial television channel in metropolitan areas of Australia since 1988. Ten HD ceased broadcasting on 25 March 2009 when it was replaced by what was a sports-only high-definition channel, One HD.

=== 2009–2015: Canwest sale, multichannels launch ===
On 24 September 2009, Canwest announced that it was selling its 50.1% stake in Ten Network Holdings for $680 million, to pay down its significant debt. In late 2009, Canwest filed for creditor bankruptcy protection, due to CA$4 billion mounting debt across radio, television broadcasting and publishing assets in several countries.

On 20 October 2010, four years after he sold his shares in PBL Media to private equity firm CVC Asia Pacific, James Packer purchased 16 per cent of Ten.

Network Ten launched a new digital channel, Eleven, on 11 January 2011. The channel is aimed at a &quot;distinctly youthful&quot; audience between the ages of 13 and 29. &quot;Neighbours&quot; and &quot;The Simpsons&quot; were high-profile programs migrating from Ten to the new channel. The channel was a joint venture with CBS Studios International, which owned a 33% stake.

On 8 May 2011, Ten relaunched its sports-based channel One, with general entertainment programming aimed at males taking over the schedule. It is aimed at a similar audience to 7mate.

In 2012, Ten unsuccessfully launched many new programs. This led to Ten&#x27;s ratings dropping to fourth place behind ABC TV for over thirty straight nights. The poor performance resulted in Chief Programming Officer David Mott&#x27;s resignation.

In September 2012, Ten made a partnership with TVSN, which meant the TVSN channel became available on Ten&#x27;s free-to-air multiplex to metropolitan viewers as a datacast service on LCN 14, on 24 September 2012.

In late 2012, Ten reported a loss of $12.9m as it battled poor advertising markets and failed to hold larger audience numbers. They made positions at the station redundant and said that production may become centralised.

Ten launched Spree TV, an Australian free-to-air datacasting television channel mainly carrying paid programming and home shopping, on 17 September 2013, on LCN 15, with Brand Developers.

Analogue broadcasts ceased in the regions on 10 December 2013.

On 1 August 2014, the network celebrated its 50th anniversary. A television special related to the anniversary called &quot;50 Years Young&quot; aired on 3 August 2014, after being rescheduled from 8 August by the network.

On 15 June 2015, Foxtel (co-owned by News Corp) bought 15% shares in Ten Network Holdings, pending approval from the ACCC. Prior to the acquisition, Discovery backed out from a bidding partnership with Foxtel. In July 2015, Paul Anderson was announced as the new chief executive officer.

===2016–2017: New affiliation and financial troubles===
A high-definition simulcast of 10 was revived on 2 March 2016. As a result, One, now known as 10 Bold, began broadcasting in standard definition only.

On 29 April 2016, the Nine Network pulled its regional affiliation with WIN Television over a lawsuit involving its catch-up service 9Now, and announced a new affiliation agreement with Southern Cross Austereo, Ten&#x27;s then-primary regional affiliate. Ten subsequently negotiated a five-year affiliation deal with WIN; the new affiliations took effect on 1 July, with WIN becoming the carrier of Network Ten programming in regional Queensland, Northern NSW, Southern NSW, Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia, Western Australia, the Australian Capital Territory and the Gold Coast. WIN owner and Ten&#x27;s largest shareholder Bruce Gordon positioned himself to increase his ownership stake in Ten, subject to changes to media ownership laws being passed.

Following Ten Network Holdings reporting a $232 million half year loss, billionaire shareholders Lachlan Murdoch, Bruce Gordon and James Packer withdrew support for $250 million guaranteed loan that would help keep Ten out of receivership. This loan was intended to replace an existing guaranteed $200 million loan that was due to expire in December. On 13 June, Ten asked the Australian Securities Exchange that their stock be placed in a 48-hour trading halt while it assessed its options concerning receivership. It went into voluntary administration the following day.

On 28 August 2017, Ten&#x27;s administrators announced that the U.S. media company CBS Corporation (which had a 33% share in the multichannel Eleven and was Ten&#x27;s largest creditor) had entered into a binding agreement to purchase the company for $123 million. CBS refinanced Ten&#x27;s existing debt including guarantor fees to billionaire shareholders James Packer, Lachlan Murdoch and Bruce Gordon, and existing loans from the Commonwealth Bank. Shareholders in Ten Network Holdings lost their investment.

Gordon and Murdoch had also placed their own joint bid for the company, which was not endorsed by the administrators. At a meeting held on 12 September, Ten&#x27;s creditors overwhelmingly voted in support of CBS&#x27; bid, citing concerns over Murdoch&#x27;s previous management of Ten and talk of mass job cuts in the news department under Murdoch/Gordon ownership.

The CBS acquisition was completed on 16 November 2017, when the shares of Ten Network Holdings were transferred to CBS Network Ten BV, a company registered in the Netherlands.

===2017–2024: CBS ownership and merger with Viacom, rebrand as Paramount Global===
Following the CBS acquisition, the network became a division of CBS Studios International. Ten moved to commission more Australian content. The additional programs were financed by the savings from the dissolution of Ten&#x27;s output agreement with 21st Century Fox. CBS also moved to re-establish an in-house advertising sales department for 2019, bringing to an end Ten&#x27;s four-year period with the Foxtel-affiliated Multi Channel Network (MCN). One reason CBS acquired Ten was to assist the company to launch its CBS All Access streaming service in the Australian market. The service launched in December 2018 and was branded 10 All Access in the local market.

On 31 October 2018, the network unveiled a new logo, replacing the &quot;ten&quot; wordmark used since 1991 with a stylised circle 10, and the network is now referred to in the text as Network 10. The new brand is used across all of Network 10&#x27;s platforms and services, and was intended to reflect the broadcaster&#x27;s positioning as an &quot;adventurous alternative&quot; with a &quot;sense of fun&quot;. 10 also relaunched its multi channels Eleven and One as 10 Peach and 10 Boss, with Boss focusing on dramatic programming and targeting an older adult audience, and Peach continuing to be targeted towards young adults. 10 Boss was forced to change its name to 10 Bold on 10 December 2018 due to trademark conflicts with Fairfax Media.

On 4 December 2019, CBS Corporation completed a re-merger with fellow media conglomerate Viacom as ViacomCBS; the two companies had previously separated in 2005. ViacomCBS subsequently began to integrate the companies&#x27; operations in Australia; in a reorganisation of the ViacomCBS Networks International division, Network 10 would join its new sister network in the United Kingdom, Channel 5 (which was owned by Viacom) as part of ViacomCBS Networks UK &amp; Australia (now Paramount Networks UK &amp; Australia) division in January 2020. The following month, it was announced that the former Viacom channels in Australia would be brought under the Network 10 sales department, moving away from Foxtel Media (formerly MCN) in April. Network 10 also began to co-commission new programmes with Channel 5, including the drama miniseries &quot;Lie With Me&quot; and documentary series &quot;The Royals Revealed&quot;.

On 13 July 2020, it was announced that Network 10 would launch a third digital channel, 10 Shake, on 27 September and on channel 13. The network carries children&#x27;s programmes in the daytime hours (drawing primarily television from Nickelodeon), while evening and primetime hours will feature &quot;edgy&quot; series and films targeting young adults, including television programmes from Comedy Central and MTV, and CBS late-night talk show &quot;The Late Late Show with James Corden&quot;.

On 16 September 2020, in 10&#x27;s metropolitan areas, various Network 10 channels moved channel places due to the launch of Network 10&#x27;s third digital channel &quot;10 Shake&quot;. The channels that moved places include TVSN, which moved to channel 16 from channel 14, 10 HD, which moved to channels 1 and 15 from channel 13 and Spree TV, which moved to channel 17 from channel 15. As a result, 10 Bold is now solely on channel 12. A placeholder for 10 Shake appeared on the same day.

In March 2021, 10 announced that it would return to Southern Cross Austereo as its regional affiliate in most markets beginning on 1 July 2021, in a deal that will last at least two years. The agreement reversed 10&#x27;s 2016 move to WIN, which had announced a long-term agreement to return to the Nine Network.

In February 2022, Network 10 and Paramount+ announced that it had commissioned &quot;&quot;, a spin-off of CBS&#x27;s drama franchise &quot;NCIS&quot;.

On 15 February 2022, it was announced that ViacomCBS would be rebranding as Paramount Global as part of a wide rebrand strategy. Following this announcement, the ViacomCBS Networks International division was rebranded as Paramount Networks International. Network 10 joined Channel 5 as part of the rebrand of its respective division, now going under the name of Paramount Networks UK &amp; Australia.

On 12 August 2022, Spree TV, the network&#x27;s shopping channel, on channel 17, ceased to broadcast. It was replaced by Gecko, a similar shopping channel, on 18 September 2022.

On 22 June 2023, it was announced that 10 Shake would rebrand as Nickelodeon on 1 August, featuring programmes under the Nick Jr., Nickelodeon, and Nick at Nite brands. The Foxtel pay television version of the channel subsequently closed down.

On 5 June 2024, it was announced that 10 Peach and 10 Bold would be rebranded as 10 Peach Comedy and 10 Bold Drama on 12 June.

On 1 August 2024, Network 10 celebrated its 60th anniversary.

===2024–present: Acquisition of regional affiliate stations===

On 17 December 2024, Southern Cross Austereo announced the sale of their regional television licenses in Regional QLD, Southern NSW/ACT and Regional Victoria to Network 10. As part of the sale, SCA will receive a share of profits from the stations for the first 5 years post-completion. The sale was completed on 1 March 2025.

On 13 February 2025, Network 10 announced they are also acquiring their affiliate in Northern NSW/Gold Coast from WIN Television. Following the completion of both SCA and WIN acquisitions, Network 10 will directly own and operate the four main regional licenses across the eastern states of Australia, the second network after the Seven Network to do so.

==Programming==
===Local programs===
Ten&#x27;s current Australian programming line-up includes &quot;Neighbours&quot;, &quot;Gogglebox Australia&quot;, &quot;Australian Survivor&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m A Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;, &quot;The Amazing Race Australia&quot;, &quot;Hunted Australia&quot;, &quot;MasterChef Australia&quot;, &quot;Dessert Masters&quot;, &quot;Shark Tank Australia&quot;, &quot;Bondi Rescue&quot;, &quot;Ambulance Australia&quot;, &quot;Big Brother Australia&quot;, &quot;Talkin&#x27; &#x27;Bout Your Generation&quot;, &quot;Have You Been Paying Attention?&quot;, &quot;Top Gear Australia&quot;, &quot;The Cheap Seats&quot;, &quot;Thank God You&#x27;re Here&quot;, &quot;Taskmaster Australia,&quot; &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot;, &quot;Wheel of Fortune, &quot;Ready Steady Cook Australia&quot; and the &quot;AACTA Awards&quot;.

===International programs===
Current American programming that airs on 10 and its digital multichannels is sourced from 10&#x27;s deals with sister company Paramount Global Content Distribution / Paramount Home Entertainment / Paramount Media Networks and Nickelodeon International, Miramax, United International Pictures, DreamWorks / DreamWorks Animation, Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures / Pixar Animation Studios, Warner Bros. International Television Distribution, Umbrella Entertainment and Transmission Films. When it was independent, 10 had a long-standing relationship with Paramount Global Content Distribution (then CBS Studios International) for the Australian TV rights to its content.

On 30 October 2017, Network 10&#x27;s studio output deal with 20th Century Fox was terminated due to the network&#x27;s bankruptcy and the CBS acquisition of the network in the same year. Consequently, the network lost the TV rights to popular shows such as &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Modern Family&quot;, &quot;Fresh Off the Boat&quot; and &quot;Life in Pieces&quot;, among others.

In 2018 however, 10 would create a newly acquired programming deal with Warner Bros. and Roadshow Entertainment, granting the network programming rights until 2025.

====Shared overseas programs====
Shared American programming which airs on 10 and Seven and its digital multi-channels are sourced from 10 and Seven&#x27;s deals with CBS Studios, DreamWorks / DreamWorks Animation and Warner Bros. International Television Distribution.

Shared American programming which airs on 10 and Nine and its digital multi-channels are sourced from 10 and Nine&#x27;s deals with CBS Studios, United International Pictures, DreamWorks / DreamWorks Animation, Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures / Pixar Animation Studios and Warner Bros. International Television Distribution.

Shared American programming that airs on 10 and ABC and its digital multi-channels are sourced from 10 and ABC&#x27;s deals with Nickelodeon International and Warner Bros. International Television Distribution.

===Former programs===
The network formerly broadcast catalogue movie and television titles from 20th Century Fox from 1980s to 1997 and 2007 to 2017, Regency Enterprises from 2015 to 2017, Sony Pictures produced in the 1990s prior to 2020, NBCUniversal from 1988 to 2016, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer from the late 1990s to 2004, Touchstone from 2017 to 2022, Roadshow from 1980s to 1990s and 2018 to 2024 and Lionsgate Films from 2019 to 2024.

In 2009, Network 10 lost the rights to Universal Pictures after more than 20 years of movies and television broadcasting when the Seven Network won the $500 billion and long-term deal with the movie and television studio broadcast TV rights.

==News and current affairs==
Network 10&#x27;s news service is called &quot;10 News First&quot; (previously &quot;Ten News&quot; &amp; &quot;Ten Eyewitness News&quot;). It produces local bulletins each weeknight and national bulletins on weekday afternoons and weekends.

The news service also produces a nightly panel show &quot;The Project&quot;.

Ten has access to a sister service CBS News for international news coverage.

During weekday overnights and Sunday mornings, Network 10 rebroadcasts American television network CBS&#x27;s (sister network since 2017) morning news program &quot;CBS Mornings&quot;.

In November 2006, Network 10 struck a deal with CBS, reportedly worth A$6 million a year. This allows Network Ten the rights to air all CBS News footage, as well as access to its &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, &quot;Dr. Phil&quot;, &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; and &quot;48 Hours&quot; programs. This deal occurred after CBS&#x27;s talks with the Nine Network broke down, with Nine refusing to pay A$8 million a year to continue its 40-year deal with CBS. Ten in turn struck a cheaper deal and has onsold CBS&#x27;s 60 Minutes stories to Nine.

On 31 July 2012, &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; was picked up by Network 10 after airing since 1982 until 30 June 2012 on the Nine Network following cutbacks on overseas purchases.

In late 2012, 10 reported a loss of $12.9m as it battled poor advertising markets and failed to hold larger audience numbers. They made positions at the station redundant and said that production may become centralised.

In September 2020, a major restructure of the news service saw local bulletins in Brisbane and Adelaide axed, with their bulletins being merged with their Sydney and Melbourne counterparts, respectively, and production of the Perth bulletin once again move to Sydney. Some of these changes would be reverted in 2023, however, with Adelaide returning to a stand-alone bulletin and the Perth bulletin returning to local production.

On 2 September 2024, After 4 years since the bulletin merge between Melbourne and Adelaide, while Sydney, Brisbane and Perth all 5 local bulletins returned separately.

==Sport==

The network is a major player in Australian sports broadcasting. All sports broadcasts on 10 and its multi-channels are labelled under the &quot;10 Sport&quot; brand. Since the Paramount takeover, however, the channel has significantly toned down its commitment to sports programming.

In 2002, 10 combined with the Nine Network and Foxtel to acquire broadcast rights for the Australian Football League, the elite Australian rules competition, displacing the Seven Network which had held the rights for more than 40 years. 10 broadcast Saturday afternoon and Saturday night games and had exclusive rights for all finals games. Along with the Seven Network, 10 placed a successful $780 million bid to jointly broadcast the game from 2007 to 2011. Under this deal, 10 continued to broadcast the Saturday component of the competition. However, unlike the previous deal, 10 did not hold the exclusive rights to the finals series. Instead, the networks shared the broadcasting of the finals series and alternated the broadcast of the grand final. In the years when 10 did not televise the Grand Final (2008 and 2010), it telecast the pre-season Grand Final and the Brownlow Medal presentation. 10 ended AFL broadcasting after 10 years at the conclusion of the 2011 season.

10 broadcast the 2007 Rugby World Cup.

In 2003, 10 started broadcasting the Formula One World Championship after the Nine Network dropped the rights in 2002 after more than twenty years of coverage.

All Big Bash League games were broadcast in Australia by 10. In 2013, 10 paid $100 million for BBL rights over five years, marking the channel&#x27;s first foray in elite domestic cricket coverage. Ten previously held the broadcast rights to the Indian Premier League.

10, in joint partnership with subscription television provider Foxtel, had broadcast rights for the 2010 Commonwealth Games.

10 acquired broadcast rights to the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia for AUD$20 million after all three major commercial networks pulled out of bidding on rights to both the 2014 and 2016 Olympic Games due to cost concerns. The Nine Network had lost AUD$22 million on its joint coverage of the 2012 Games with Foxtel, and the Seven Network&#x27;s bid was rejected for being lower than what Nine/Foxtel had previously paid.

In 2018, 10 signed the rights to the Melbourne Cup Carnival, after the Seven Network ended the rights for 17 years.

In 2019, 10 broadcast the 2019 Rugby World Cup.

In 2021, 10 acquired the rights to a range of football content, most notably both A-League Men and Women competitions as well as Socceroos and Matildas games. The deal also included content from the AFC, which includes the AFC Champions League and other World Cup qualifiers in the AFC region involving non-Australian teams, among others. Football content will be broadcast across both Paramount+ and free-to-air platforms.

==Availability==
Network 10 is available in standard definition and in 1080i high definition. Core programming is fibre fed out of ATV Melbourne to its sister stations and regional affiliates with TEN Sydney providing national news programming. The receiving stations and affiliates then insert their own localised news and advertising which is then broadcast in metropolitan areas and three aggregated regional markets via Network 10&#x27;s owned-and-operated stations TEN Sydney, ATV Melbourne, TVQ Brisbane, ADS Adelaide, NEW Perth, Regional QLD, Southern NSW &amp; ACT and Regional VIC.

The network&#x27;s programming is also carried into regional Australia by various affiliate stations, including Southern Cross 10, WIN Television, Tasmanian Digital Television, Darwin Digital Television, Central Digital Television and West Digital Television.

In addition to this, 10 is retransmitted via Foxtel&#x27;s cable and satellite pay television services.
===10 HD===

The 10 HD multichannel was launched on 16 December 2007 on channels 1 &amp; 14 for 2 years of experience until breakaway programming. until Ten HD ceased broadcasting on 26 March 2009 with the launch of One HD, and later revived on 2 March 2016. It broadcasts identical programming to 10 but in 1080i HD.

From 2002, this was interspersed with a loop of high definition demonstration material during business hours, for viewing in the showrooms of television retailers, at the conclusion of an equivalent service by Network 10.

After the Nine Network restarted broadcasting 9HD in November 2015, 10 confirmed that it was working on rebroadcasting 10 HD. However, they did not put a time frame on it, stating that they are &quot;working through some technical and rights issues&quot;. On 11 February 2016, some smart TVs began receiving notification messages advising of 10HD through a &quot;ghost broadcast&quot; that soon disappeared.

10 later recommenced simulcasting in high definition on 2 March 2016 on channel 13 from 3pm, in time for the 2016 season of the Virgin Australia Supercars Championship. As a result, One was reduced to a standard definition broadcast on both channel 1 and channel 12. Ten uses MPEG-4 technology to broadcast Ten HD.

===10Play===

The network&#x27;s free video on demand and catch up TV service is called 10Play. Launched on 29 September 2013, it replaced the network&#x27;s old website that offered limited catch-up TV services. The service is available on the web and via apps for mobile devices, smart TVs, set-top boxes and video game consoles.

===Paramount+===

10 All Access was launched on 4 December 2018 as an ad-free subscription streaming service. It was a rebranded, localised version of CBS All Access. The service offered programming from 10 and CBS&#x27;s libraries, original programming, a Livestream of CBS News and the ability to watch select CBS programmes prior to their broadcast on 10&#x27;s channels.

In August 2020, following the re-merger of CBS Corporation and Viacom, ViacomCBS revealed plans to launch a new international streaming brand using the CBS All Access infrastructure, which would include CBS All Access and Showtime original programmes, Paramount Pictures films, other ViacomCBS library content, and content contributed from local subsidiaries. It was stated that existing Paramount Plus streaming services in Latin America and Nordic Europe, as well as 10 All Access, would be migrated to the then-unnamed service.

On 16 September 2020, it was officially announced that 10 All Access would be rebranded as Paramount+ in mid-2021. On 7 May 2021, it was announced that Paramount+ would launch on 11 August. ViacomCBS also announced that the second season of &quot;Five Bedrooms&quot; would premiere on Paramount Plus&#x27; launch date and that Australian original series including &quot;Spreadsheet&quot;, &quot;Last King of the Cross&quot; and movie &quot;6 Festivals&quot; were in production for the platform. In 2022, the streaming platform streamed exclusive coverage of the FA Cup in Australia and announced original series &quot;Spreadsheet&quot;, &quot;The Bridge Australia&quot; and &quot;Couples Therapy Australia&quot;. It also released teen drama &quot;More Than This&quot;, lifestyle factual series &quot;Undressed&quot; and documentary series &quot;Sky Blue: Inside Sydney FC&quot;. In 2023, Paramount+ released original series &quot;Last King of the Cross&quot;, &quot;One Night&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Betoota Advocate Presents&quot;, &quot;The Inspired Unemployed (Impractical) Jokers&quot; and movie &quot;The Appleton Ladies&#x27; Potato Race&quot;.

===Pluto TV=== 
At the start of August 2023 it was confirmed that an Australian version of Pluto TV would be launched within 10 Play from the end of the month. The initial tranche of content announced for the new service included &quot;box set&quot; channels for series such as South Park, I Love Lucy and Happy Days, alongside several MTV and Nickelodeon branded streams, such as MTV Reality, Nick Classics and Nicktoons.

==Controversy==
For the 2006 series of &quot;Big Brother&quot;, Ten appointed two censors to review the show instead of one. The Federal Minister for Communications, Senator Helen Coonan, was reported to have said that she would be keeping a &quot;close watch on the show&#x27;s 2006 series&quot;. This controversy resulted in &quot;Big Brother Uncut&quot; being renamed &quot;Big Brother: Adults Only&quot; for the 2006 season of &quot;Big Brother&quot;. In two separate findings, the Australian Communications and Media Authority determined Network Ten breached clause 2.4 of the Commercial Television Industry Code of Practice. These two breaches were in relation to the broadcast of &quot;Big Brother Uncut&quot; on 30 May, 13 June and 4 July 2005. The broadcast material was not classified according to the Television Classification Guidelines.

Despite toning down &quot;Big Brother: Adults Only&quot; significantly in comparison to 2005, the series continued to attract controversy. After &quot;Big Brother: Adults Only&quot; was abruptly cancelled several weeks early, a subsequent incident of alleged sexual assault in the house saw the removal of two housemates and a huge public outcry calling for the series to be cancelled entirely. This incident generated significant publicity for the show, even prompting the Prime Minister of Australia to call on Network Ten to &quot;do a bit of self-regulation and get this stupid program off the air.&quot;

Just prior to the fifth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, Network Ten broadcast &quot;911: In Plane Site&quot;, a documentary that examined conspiracy theories about the terrorist attacks. Federal Labor politician Michael Danby demanded that the programming director of the station be sacked.

On 8 October 2008, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) found Network Ten guilty of breaching the Commercial Television Industry Code of Practice by using subliminal advertising during the broadcast of the 2007 ARIA Music Awards on 28 October 2007. Network Ten had inserted single frames (lasting 1/25th of a second) into the program broadcast. This was exposed on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Media Watch&quot; program.

==Logo and identity history==
From 1964 to 1984 Network Ten&#x27;s four stations – ATV-0/ATV-10 Melbourne, TEN-10 Sydney, TVQ-0 Brisbane and SAS-10 Adelaide – used different logos to identify themselves. There had also been a number of network-wide logos used from the mid-1960s through to the early 1980s.

By late-1985 ATV-10, SAS-10 and TEN-10 were all using the same logo – a circle with &quot;TEN&quot; in the centre, somewhat in the style of a neon sign. This logo had been introduced by TEN-10 on 16 January 1983, was adopted by ATV-10 in June 1984 and by SAS-10 in November 1985. The logo was also similar to the new logo adopted by Brisbane&#x27;s TVQ-0 in April 1983, when that station became branded as TV0 – a neon sign-style circle with &quot;TV&quot; in the centre.

Kicking off several years of branding upheaval, on 24 January 1988 ATV-10, ADS-10 and TEN-10 all adopted the &quot;X TEN&quot; logo, followed by Perth&#x27;s NEW-10 when the station launched in May of that year, and finally TVQ-0 on 10 September, when the station changed frequency and became TVQ-10. On 23 July 1989, the network rebranded again to &quot;10 TV Australia&quot;.

On 13 January 1991, the network introduced a new logo featuring a lowercase &quot;ten&quot; in a circle; four variations of this logo would appear over the next 27 years. The first version consisted of a white, silver or metallic ring enclosing a blue circle with &quot;ten&quot; in yellow lowercase text. A revision of the logo with a yellow ring was introduced with the &quot;Give Me Ten&quot; ident campaign in 1995, but the white/silver/metallic ring was reintroduced with the network&#x27;s 1997 idents. It was not until 1 October 1999 when the &quot;Electric&quot; ident was launched that the ring became yellow permanently.

In January 2008, the logo was enhanced for HD with a glossy &quot;ball&quot; effect similar to the logo of the American network ABC. On 22 June 2013, the logo changed again, when the ring and lettering became blue as well.

On 31 October 2018, Ten unveiled a completely new logo, in its first major rebranding since 1991. The new branding replaced the &quot;ten&quot; wordmark with a numeric 10 in a circle. The &quot;10&quot; used in the logo is similar to those of American local TV stations WBNS-TV and WTSP. Coincidentally, the stations are affiliates of the CBS television network in the U.S., albeit as affiliates owned by Tegna Inc. as opposed to owned-and-operated stations part of CBS Television Stations.

<text>Typhlosaurus is a genus of African lizards, one of a number of genera of limbless lizards in the skink family (Scincidae). In 2010 this group was revised, and most species formerly attributed to &quot;Typhlosaurus&quot; were placed in the genus &quot;Acontias&quot;. As of 2025 the definition of &quot;Typhlosaurus&quot; includes five attenuate body legless lizards from southwestern Africa (South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Angola). This is the sister genus to &quot;Acontias&quot;, which together form the well supported Afrotropical subfamily Acontinae.

==Species==
Five species are recognized as being valid.
*&quot;Typhlosaurus braini&quot; – Haacke&#x27;s legless skink, Brain&#x27;s legless skink, Brain&#x27;s blind legless skink 
*&quot;Typhlosaurus caecus&quot; – southern blind legless skink, Cuvier&#x27;s legless skink 
*&quot;Typhlosaurus lomiae&quot; – Lomi&#x27;s blind legless skink
*&quot;Typhlosaurus meyeri&quot; – Meyer&#x27;s blind legless skink, variable blind legless skink
*&quot;Typhlosaurus vermis&quot; – Boulenger&#x27;s legless skink, pink blind legless skink

<text>In computing, end-of-file (EOF) is a condition in a computer operating system where no more data can be read from a data source. The data source is usually called a file or stream.

==Details==
In the C standard library, the character-reading functions such as getchar return a value equal to the symbolic value (macro) codice_1 to indicate that an end-of-file condition has occurred. The actual value of codice_1 is implementation-dependent and must be negative (it is commonly −1, such as in glibc). Block-reading functions return the number of bytes read, and if this is fewer than asked for, then the end of file was reached or an error occurred (checking of codice_3 or dedicated function, such as codice_4 is required to determine which).

==EOF character==
Input from a terminal never really &quot;ends&quot; (unless the device is disconnected), but it is useful to enter more than one &quot;file&quot; into a terminal, so a key sequence is reserved to indicate end of input. In UNIX, the translation of the keystroke to EOF is performed by the terminal driver, so a program does not need to distinguish terminals from other input files. By default, the driver converts a Control-D character at the start of a line into an end-of-file indicator. To insert an actual Control-D (ASCII 04) character into the input stream, the user precedes it with a &quot;quote&quot; command character (usually Control-V). AmigaDOS is similar but uses Control-\ instead of Control-D.

In DOS and Windows (and in CP/M and many DEC operating systems such as the PDP-6 monitor, RT-11, VMS or TOPS-10), reading from the terminal will never produce an EOF. Instead, programs recognize that the source is a terminal (or other &quot;character device&quot;) and interpret a given reserved character or sequence as an end-of-file indicator; most commonly, this is an ASCII Control-Z, code 26. Some MS-DOS programs, including parts of the Microsoft MS-DOS shell (COMMAND.COM) and operating-system utility programs (such as EDLIN), treat a Control-Z in a text file as marking the end of meaningful data, and/or append a Control-Z to the end when writing a text file. This was done for two reasons:
* Backward compatibility with CP/M. The CP/M file system (and also the original 8-bit FAT implemented in Microsoft BASIC) only recorded the lengths of files in multiples of 128-byte &quot;records&quot;, so, by convention, a Control-Z character was used to mark the end of meaningful data if it ended in the middle of a record. The FAT12 filesystem introduced with 86-DOS and MS-DOS has always recorded the exact byte-length of files, so this was never necessary on DOS.
* It allows programs to use the same code to read input from both a terminal and a text file.

In the ANSI X3.27-1969 magnetic tape standard, the end of file was indicated by a tape mark, which consisted of a gap of approximately 3.5 inches of tape followed by a single byte containing the character codice_5 (hex) for nine-track tapes and codice_6 (octal) for seven-track tapes. The end-of-tape, commonly abbreviated as EOT, was indicated by two tape marks. This was the standard used, for example, on IBM 360. The reflective strip that was used to announce impending physical end of tape was also called an EOT marker.

<doc id="342324" wikidata="Q157171" url="?curid=342324" title="Renting">
<text>Renting, also known as hiring or letting, is an agreement where a payment is made for the use of a good, service or property owned by another over a fixed period of time. To maintain such an agreement, a rental agreement (or lease) is signed to establish the roles and expectations of both the tenant and landlord. There are many different types of leases. The type and terms of a lease are decided by the landlord and agreed upon by the renting tenant.

==History==
Various types of rent are referenced in Roman law: rent (&quot;canon&quot;) under the long leasehold tenure of Emphyteusis; rent (&quot;reditus&quot;) of a farm; ground-rent (&quot;solarium&quot;); rent of state lands (&quot;vectigal&quot;); and the annual rent (&quot;prensio&quot;) payable for the &quot;jus superficiarum&quot; or right to the perpetual enjoyment of anything built on the surface of land.

==Reasons for renting==

There are many possible reasons for renting instead of buying, for example:
*In many jurisdictions (including India, Spain, Australia, United Kingdom and the United States) rent paid in a trade or business is tax-deductible, whereas rent on a dwelling is not tax-deductible in most jurisdictions.
*Financial inadequacy, such as renting a house when one is unable to purchase, i.e &quot;renting by necessity&quot;.
*Reducing financial risk due to depreciation and transaction costs, especially for real estate which might be needed only for a short amount of time.
*When something is needed only temporarily, as in the case of a special tool, a truck or a skip.
*When something is needed that may or may not be already owned but is not in proximity for use, such as renting an automobile or bicycle when away on a trip.
*Needing a cheaper alternative to buying, such as renting a movie: a person is unwilling to pay the full price for a movie, so they rent it for a lesser price but give up the chance to view it again later.
*The tenant may want to leave the burden of upkeep of the property (mowing the lawn, shovelling snow, etc.) to the owner or his agents.
*There is no need to worry about lifespan and maintenance.
*Renting keeps off-balance-sheet the debt that would burden the balance sheet of a company in case the property would have been bought.
*Renting is good for the environment if products are used more efficiently by maximizing utility rather than being disposed of, overproduced and underutilized.
*Risks aside, renting has the potential to generate a regular stream of revenue for the owner. The more the churn (the number of times the item is rented out) the higher the income. Eventually, the rental income crosses the product procurement value and every churn post that becomes a profit for the owner
*Renting often also becomes an alternate revenue pool for idle inventory vs. overly depending on a stagnant / slowing retailing business environment

==Growth of rental industry==
Short-term rental of all sorts of products (excluding real estate and holiday apartments) already represents an estimated €108 billion ($160 billion) annual market in Europe and is expected to grow further as the internet makes it easier to find specific items available for rent. According to a poll by YouGov, 76% of people looking to rent would go to the internet first to find what they need; rising to 88% for those aged 25–34.

The Great Recession may have contributed to the rapid growth of online rental marketplaces, such as erento, since consumers are more likely to consider renting instead of buying in times of financial hardship. Environmental concerns, fast depreciation of goods, and a more transient workforce also mean that consumers are increasingly searching for rentals online.

A 2010 US survey found 27% of renters plan to never buy a home.

===Rental investment===
Net income received, or losses suffered, by an investor from renting of properties is subject to idiosyncratic risk due to the numerous things that can happen to real property and variable behavior of tenants.

==Rental agreements==

There is typically an implied, explicit, or written rental agreement or contract involved to specify the terms of the rental, which are regulated and managed under contract law.

Examples include letting out real estate (real property) for the purpose of housing tenure (where the tenant rents a residence to live in), parking space for a vehicle(s), storage space, whole or portions of properties for business, agricultural, institutional, or government use, or other reasons.

When renting real estate, the person(s) or party who lives in or occupies the real estate is often called a tenant, paying rent to the owner of the property, often called a landlord (or landlady). The real estate rented may be all or part of almost any real estate, such as an apartment, house, building, business office(s) or suite, land, farm, or merely an inside or outside space to park a vehicle, or store things all under Real estate law.

The tenancy agreement for real estate is often called a lease, and usually involves specific property rights in real property, as opposed to chattels.

In India, the rental income on property is taxed under the head &quot;income from house property&quot;. A deduction of 30% is allowed from total rent which is charged to tax.

The time use of a chattel or other so called &quot;personal property&quot; is covered under general contract law, but the term &quot;lease&quot; also nowadays extends to long term &quot;rental contracts&quot; of more expensive non-Real properties such as automobiles, boats, planes, office equipment and so forth. The distinction in that case is long term versus short term rentals. Some non-real properties commonly available for rent or lease are:
*motion pictures on VHS or DVD, of audio CDs, of computer programs on CD-ROM.
*transport equipment, such as an automobile or a bicycle.
*ships and boats, in which case rental is known as chartering, and the rent is known as &quot;hire&quot; or &quot;freight&quot; (depending on the type of charter)
*aircraft, in which case rental is known as chartering, or leasing if the rental is longer term
*specialized tools, such as a chainsaw, laptop, IT equipment or something more substantial, such as a forklift.
*large equipment such as cranes, oil rigs and submarines.
*a deckchair or beach chair and umbrella.
*furniture
*designer handbags, jewelry, sunglasses and watches.
*Home appliances such as washing machines, refrigerators, televisions, microwave ovens, and air-conditioning units

In various degrees, renting can involve buying services for various amounts of time, such as staying in a hotel, using a computer in an Internet cafe, or riding in a taxicab (some forms of English use the term &quot;hiring&quot; for this activity).

As seen from the examples, some rented goods are used on the spot, but usually they are taken along; to help guarantee that they are brought back, one or more of the following applies:

*one shows an identity document
*one signs a contract; any damage already present when renting may be noted down to avoid that the renter is blamed for it when the good is returned
*one pays a damage deposit (a refundable fee that may be used in part to pay for damage caused by the renter)

If the customer has a credit account with the rental company, they may rent over several months (or years) and will receive a recurring or continuation invoice each rental period until they return the equipment. In this case deposits are rarely required.

In certain types of rental (sometimes known as operated or wet rental) the charge may be calculated by the rental charge + timesheets of operators or drivers supplied by the rental company to operate the equipment. This is particularly relevant for crane rental companies.

Sometimes the risk that the good is kept is reduced by it being a special model or having signs on it that cannot easily be removed, making it obvious that it is owned by the rental company; this is especially effective for goods used in public places, but even when used at home it may help due to social control.

Persons and businesses that regularly rent goods from a particular company generally have an account with that company, which reduces the administrative procedure (transaction costs) on each occasion.

Signing out books from a library could be considered renting when there is a fee per book. However the term &quot;lending&quot; is more common.

==Leasing==
Rental of personal property or real property for periods often longer than a year, which is governed by the signing of a lease, is known as leasing. Leasing is usually used for high-value capital equipment, both in business and by consumers. A lease in which the renter benefits from an increase in value of the asset is known as a finance lease. A leasing agreement which is not a finance lease is known as an operating lease. In housing, when a tenant rents an apartment but only pays for their room and the common space is a lease-by-room arrangement.

==Rent to own==
A rental agreement may provide for the renter or lessee to become the owner of the asset at the end of the rental period, usually at the renter&#x27;s option on payment of a nominal fee. Such arrangements may be known as
*Rent-to-own, a term used in the United States for rental of furniture or appliances. The term is also used in the US for real estate transactions, where the tenant has an option to purchase the property at a fixed price at a specified future time. Such arrangements are also known as lease-option, lease-to-own or lease to purchase option.
*Hire purchase, used in the UK and other countries for the purchase of cars, other consumer equipment and business equipment. The term lease-purchase is also used.
*Closed-end leasing, used in the US and Canada for the leasing of cars. Unlike in hire purchase, the asset is sold at its residual value at the end of the term, rather than for a nominal amount.

<text>The Brusilov offensive ( &quot;Brusilovskiĭ proryv&quot;, literally: &quot;Brusilov&#x27;s breakthrough&quot;), also known as the June advance, or Battle of Galicia-Volhynia, of June to September 1916 was the Russian Empire&#x27;s greatest feat of arms during World War I, and among the most lethal offensives in world history. The historian Graydon Tunstall called the Brusilov offensive the worst crisis of World War I for Austria-Hungary and the Triple Entente&#x27;s greatest victory, but it came at a tremendous loss of life. It was arguably the most successful offensive in the entirety of the First World War. The victory contributed to a morale upsurge among the Russian troops. In 1917, Nicholas II planned a general offensive along the entire front in order to end the Central Powers. After the victory, the was held at which the post-war structure of the world was discussed. Even despite the losses, the Russian armies were still being reinforced with new forces, the number of weapons increased, and new railways were being built.
The offensive&#x27;s success led Russia&#x27;s allies to reconsider their positions on postwar territorial concessions, including the status of Anatolia and the Bosphorus Strait.

The offensive involved a major Russian attack against the armies of the Central Powers on the Eastern Front. Launched on 4 June 1916, it lasted until late September. It took place in eastern Galicia (present-day northwestern Ukraine), in the Lviv and Volyn Oblasts. The offensive is named after the commander in charge of the Southwestern Front of the Imperial Russian Army, General Aleksei Brusilov. The largest and most lethal offensive of the war, the effects of the Brusilov offensive were far-reaching. It relieved German pressure on French forces at Verdun, and helped to relieve the Austro-Hungarian pressure on the Italians. It inflicted irreparable losses on the Austro-Hungarian Army, and induced Romania to finally enter the war on the side of the Entente. The human and material losses on the Russian side also greatly contributed to the onset of the Russian Revolution the following year. It was the largest battle in World War I according to the total losses and forces of the parties.

==Background==
Under the terms of the Chantilly Agreement of December 1915, Russia, France, Britain and Italy committed to simultaneous attacks against the Central Powers in the summer of 1916. Russia felt reluctantly obliged to lend troops to fight in France and Salonika, and to attack on the Eastern Front, in the hope of obtaining munitions from Britain and France.

In March 1916 the Russians initiated the disastrous Lake Naroch offensive in the Vilnius area, during which the Germans suffered only one-fifth as many casualties as the Russians. This offensive took place at French request – General Joseph Joffre had hoped that the Imperial German Army would transfer more units to the east after the Battle of Verdun began in February 1916.

Besides the complacency felt by the Germans and Austro-Hungarians after their successful defense of Russian attacks that winter and March, the Austro-Hungarians were in the midst of implementing their plans to knock Italy out of the war. Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf had transferred Kövess&#x27; troops from the Balkans as well as four divisions from the Eastern Front. According to Prit Buttar, &quot;To make matters worse, many of the experienced divisions on the Eastern Front were withdrawn and sent to the Alps, and replaced by formations largely composed of new inexperienced recruits.&quot;

==Prelude==
At a war council held with senior commanders and the tsar in April 1916, General Aleksei Brusilov presented a plan to the Stavka (the Russian high command), proposing a massive offensive by his Southwestern Front against the Austro-Hungarian forces in Galicia. Brusilov&#x27;s plan aimed to take some of the pressure off French and British armies in France and the Royal Italian Army along the Isonzo Front and, if possible, to knock Austria-Hungary out of the war.

General Alexei Evert, commander of the Russian Western Army Group based in Smolensk, favored a defensive strategy and opposed Brusilov&#x27;s proposed offensive. Tsar Nicholas II had taken personal command of the Imperial Russian Army in September 1915. Evert was a strong supporter of Nicholas and the Romanovs, but the emperor approved Brusilov&#x27;s plan. The offensive aimed to capture the cities of Kovel and Lviv (in present-day western Ukraine); the Central Powers had recovered both these cities in 1915. Although the Stavka had approved Brusilov&#x27;s plan, his request for supporting offensives by the neighboring fronts (the Western under Evert and Northern under Aleksey Kuropatkin) was denied.

On 26 May, the tsar issued orders for accelerating the start of the Russian summer offensive, in response to pleas from the Italians facing Conrad&#x27;s offensive. Brusilov would attack on 4 June, and the rest of the Russian army ten days later. Brusilov chose Alexey Kaledin&#x27;s Eighth Army to spearhead the capture of Lutsk and Kovel. Kaledin&#x27;s attacking force included the XXXII Corps in the south, the VIII and XL Corps in the center, and XXXIX Corps in the north. The Russians fielded 148 infantry battalions against the 53 battalions in Archduke Joseph Ferdinand&#x27;s Fourth Army. Further south on the Austro-Hungarian front were Paul Puhallo von Brlog&#x27;s 1st Army, Eduard von Böhm-Ermolli&#x27;s 2nd Army, and Karl von Pflanzer-Baltin&#x27;s 7th Army.

Mounting pressure from the western Allies caused the Russians to hurry their preparations. Brusilov amassed four armies totaling 40 infantry divisions and 15 cavalry divisions. He faced 39 Austro-Hungarian infantry divisions and 10 cavalry divisions, formed in a row of three defensive lines, as well as German reinforcements that were later brought up. Deception efforts on the Russian side were intended to conceal the point of attack. They included false radio traffic, false orders sent by messengers who were intended to be captured, and equipment displays including dummy artillery. Brusilov, knowing he would not receive significant reinforcements, moved his reserves up to the front line. He used them to dig entrenchments about along the front line. These provided shelter for the troops and hindered observation by the Austrians.

Brusilov extended his army&#x27;s trenches forward as far as possible, in some cases to within 100m of the Austro-Hungarian positions. Tunnels were also dug below the Russian barbed wire, allowing the entanglements to remain intact during the Russian attack. By these methods Brusilov hoped to lessen the exposure, and increase the surprise, of his attacking troops. Instead of massed formations, each of Brusilov&#x27;s armies would attack along a 15 km wide sector of their choice, attacking in waves with two reinforced infantry corps.

==Breakthrough==
On 4 June, the Russians opened the offensive with heavy artillery fire. Alexander Winogradsky&#x27;s artillery brigade used 76mm guns to open 24 breaches in the Austro-Hungarian defenses, coordinated in advance with the infantry commanders. Winogradsky wrote, this was followed by a &quot;creeping barrage in front of the assault infantry...while the 152mm howitzers and 122mm guns attacked hard points.&quot; This was followed by attacks by infantry in Kaledin&#x27;s 8th Army, Vladimir Viktorovich Sakharov&#x27;s 11th Army, Dmitry Shcherbachev&#x27;s 7th Army, and Lechitsky&#x27;s 9th Army.

On 5 June, according to Prit Buttar, &quot;...the Russian gunners resumed their careful demolition work of the defences of Joseph Ferdinand&#x27;s 4th Army... After two days of careful artillery fire and infantry attacks, Kaledin was confident their success was close. His troops had overrun both the first and second lines of enemy defences, and had inflicted heavy losses on the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army.&quot; Ferdinand was almost out of artillery ammunition, had used all of his reserves, and was forced to seek help from Linsingen&#x27;s Army of the Bug to the north.

By the end of 6 June, The X and UU Corps, plus Sándor Szurmay&#x27;s Corps, of the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army, had been pushed back to the Styr and beyond, while Kaledin&#x27;s XL and II Corps pushed onward to Lutsk. By the end of 7 June, the 4th Army retreat was unstoppable, with many elements of the X Corps surrendering when caught against the river, or casualties in attempts to cross. 4th Army supplies abandoned in Lutsk went up in flames as the Russians occupied the town. Further south, Pflanzer-Baltin&#x27;s 7th Army was pushed back to the Strypa, as Shcherbachev&#x27;s Seventh Army captured Jazłowiek.

The first major attack was against the 117,800 strong Austro-Hungarian 4th Army, in the northernmost sector of the front. The initial attack was successful, and the Austro-Hungarian lines were broken, enabling three of Brusilov&#x27;s four armies to advance on a wide front (see: Battle of Kostiuchnówka). Within four days of the offensive, the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army saw its strength fall by nearly 70 per cent, from 117,800 men to just 35,000. The southern sector was held by the Austro-Hungarian 7th Army, which by 8 June lost 76,200 of its 194,200 soldiers.

Archduke Joseph Ferdinand was replaced by Karl Tersztyánszky von Nádas as 4th Army commander, and Hugo Martiny was replaced by Smekal as X Corps commander. After four days into the offensive, Buttar states, &quot;Brusilov&#x27;s revolutionary tactics had been stunningly successful: artillery had been used with a precision that was unprecedented; infantry had worked their way close to the defences before launching their attacks; and those attacks had not used the traditional lines of men that were so easy for machineguns and defensive artillery to destroy.&quot; However, Brusilov was informed by Alexeyev that Evert&#x27;s West Front would not be able to commence their attacks before 18 June. Meanwhile, Linsingen ordered Friedrich von Bernhardi to gather German forces for a counterattack.

==Battle==

On 8 June, in response to appeals for help from Conrad, Erich von Falkenhayn organized five German divisions under the command of Linsingen, concentrating them near Kovel for a counterattack. Brusilov moved to protect his northern flank, while all of his armies continued to maintain pressure all along his Southwest Front.

On 9 and 10 June, Lechitsky&#x27;s 9th Army advanced upon Doroschoutz, Okna and Czarny Potok, as Pflanzer-Baltin&#x27;s 7th Army troops retreated. According to Buttar, &quot;It was a graphic demonstration of Brusilov&#x27;s theories. Pressure across a broad front forced the defenders to commit their reserves and left no sectors that could release troops to aid others.&quot; By 11 June, Pflanzer-Baltin&#x27;s &quot;Gruppe Benigni&quot; and XII Corps were forming new defensive lines to the west, as his XI Corps retreated south across the Prut. According to Buttar, adding those killed, wounded, or taken prisoner, &quot;...the Austro-Hungarian 7th Army was a shadow of its former self.&quot;
On 11 June, Felix Graf von Bothmer&#x27;s South Army prepared a counterattack using Arthur Arz von Straußenburg&#x27;s VI Corps. However, Scherbachev was ready and the front line remained unchanged.

On 11 June, while pursuing the Austro-Hungarian Army in Bukovina, Russian forces inadvertently crossed into Romanianterritory, where they overwhelmed the border guard at Mamornița and had a cavalry patrol disarmed and interned at Herța. Having no intention to force the hand of the Romanian government, the Russians quickly left Romanian territory.

Lechitsky kept the XXIII and XLI Corps moving westward, while the XII and XI Corps advanced south to capture Czernowitz, and III Cavalry Corps threatened Kolomea. By 12 June his Russian troops were attacking Austro-Hungarian positions along the Pruth, and crossing that river by 14 June. By then, the Austro-Hungarian losses amounted to 205,000, of which 150,000 were prisoners.

On 17 June, the Russians captured Czernowitz, and Alexeyev transferred the 3rd Army from Evert&#x27;s West Front to Brusilov&#x27;s Southwest Front. Meanwhile, Bothmer&#x27;s South Army prepared to attack southwards, hoping Pflanzer-Baltin&#x27;s Seventh Army could hold its ground.

On 18 June, Lechitsky was able to capture Kolomea. On 19 June, Russian cavalry, led by Mikhail Promtov crossed the Siret, and on 20 June reached the Carpathian Foothills. However, by the end of June, Southwest Front&#x27;s casualties amounted to a costly 285,000.

On 15 June, Linsingen ordered a counterattack, concentrating around the Lutsk salient formed by Kaledin&#x27;s offensive. Attacking forces included Puhallo&#x27;s 1st Army, Tersztyánsky&#x27;s 4th Army, Georg von der Marwitz&#x27;s German X Corps, and &quot;Gruppe Bernhardi&quot;. However, after three days of fighting, little was changed in the position of the front lines, even after the addition of &quot;Gruppe Falkenhayn&quot; on 21 June. Linsingen then decided to reinforce that attack group in a thrust towards Lutsk, but under the command of Marwitz, with the attack to commence on 30 June. Brusilov was preparing his own continued offensive, with Leonid Lesh&#x27;s 3rd Army advancing towards Pinsk, Kaledin&#x27;s 8th Army towards Kovel, the 11th Army towards Brody, while the 7th and 9th Armies continued their advance. Brusilov met the German attacks on the Lutsk salient flanks by attacking in turn the German flanks. However, the Germans achieved only moderate success, pushing back the Russian XLV Corps 5 km.

From 27 June to 3 July 1916, Brusilov carried out, on his own initiative, the deportation of 13,000 German civilians from the Volhynian areas that had been conquered during the offensive.

On 2 July, Evert&#x27;s West Front finally started its offensive, with Alexander Ragoza&#x27;s Fourth army attacking north of Baranovichi. Yet, according to Buttar, &quot;it was in almost every respect a replay of the disastrous attacks of March...an imprecise artillery bombardment, mass infantry attacks that struggled to make progress and lacked sufficient support to sustain early gains...&quot;. On 9 July, Evert suspended the operation, with the 4th Army losing 80,000, having advanced only 5 km. Likewise, Kuropatkin&#x27;s Northern Front offensive in mid-July failed to appreciably change the front line.

On 4 July, attacks by Lesh&#x27;s 3rd Army and Kaledin&#x27;s 8th Army forced Linsingen to withdraw westwards to the Stochod river on 6 July. On 5 July Archduke Karl took command of the new 12th Army, while on 9 July, Kövesz 3rd Army was created from a portion of Pflanzer-Baltin&#x27;s 7th Army that had retreated westward. Pflanzer-Baltin remained in command of the 7th Army that had retreated towards the Carpathians.

Recognizing Southwest Front had the best chance to advance the Russian front lines, Ragoza&#x27;s 4th Army was dispersed into Brusilov&#x27;s 2nd and 10th Armies, and Brusilov was given Bezobrazov&#x27;s Guards Army. Southwest Front now had a force of 700,000 men, compared to an opposition force of 421,000. Brusilov planned to advance towards Kovel on 20 July. Before then, on 16 July, the Siberian Corps forced &quot;Gruppe Marwitz&quot; to retreat back to the River Lipa. In an attempt to strengthen Marwitz, Puhallo&#x27;s 1st Army was disbanded, and redistributed to Marwitz and Böhm-Ermolli&#x27;s 2nd Army.

On 23 July, Sakharov&#x27;s 11th Army attacked towards Brody, capturing it on 28 July, forcing Böhm-Ermolli&#x27;s 2nd Army 7 km to the west. On 28 July, Hindenburg was placed in command of the front up to the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army, with Archduke Karl in command from that point south.

On 24 July, artillery preparations began for the Russian assault in the Battle of Kovel. According to Buttar, &quot;The fighting that extended from 28 July into early August was curiously disjointed...Although Lesh, Bezobrazov and Kaledin all launched their attacks on the same day, none of them were able to maintain their efforts for long...&quot; Lechitsky&#x27;s 9th Army and Shcherbachev&#x27;s 7th Army made simultaneous attacks further south, with Lechitsky able to advance the front line to outside Stanislau, capturing it on 11 August.

On 7 August, Brusilov resumed his offensive to take Kovel. By 8 August, the Germans and Austro-Hungarians had stopped the Russians, and on 9 August, Brusilov halted any further attempt to take Kovel. The offensive was essentially over, according to Buttar, &quot;Attacks continued on until the autumn rains turned the roads to mud, but other than add to the already terrible casualty list, nothing was achieved.&quot;

==Aftermath==
Brusilov&#x27;s operation achieved its original goal of forcing Germany to halt its attack on Verdun and transfer considerable forces to the East. Afterward, the Austro-Hungarian Army increasingly had to rely on the support of the German Army for its military successes. On the other hand, the German Army did not suffer much from the operation and retained most of its offensive power afterward. The early success of the offensive convinced Romania to enter the war on the side of the Entente, which led to the failure of the 1916 campaign. The Brusilov Offensive was the high point of the Russian effort during World War I, and was a manifestation of good leadership and planning on the part of the Imperial Russian Army coupled with great skill of the lower ranks. According to John Keegan, &quot;the Brusilov Offensive was, on the scale by which success was measured in the foot-by-foot fighting of the First World War, the greatest victory seen on any front since the trench lines had been dug on the Aisne two years before&quot;.

The Brusilov offensive commanded by Brusilov himself went very well, but the overall campaign, for which Brusilov&#x27;s part was only supposed to be a distraction, because of Evert&#x27;s failures, became tremendously costly for the imperial army, and after the offensive, it was no longer able to launch another on the same scale. Many historians contend that the casualties that the Russian army suffered in this campaign contributed significantly to its collapse the following year. The operation was marked by a considerable improvement in the quality of Russian tactics. Brusilov used smaller, specialized units to attack weak points in the Austro-Hungarian trench lines and blow open holes for the rest of the army to advance into. These were a remarkable departure from the human wave attacks that had dominated the strategy of all the major armies until that point during World War I. Evert used conventional tactics that were to prove costly and indecisive, thereby costing Russia its chance for a victory in 1916.

The irony was that other Russian commanders did not realize the potential of the tactics that Brusilov had devised. Similar tactics were proposed separately by French, Germans and British on the Western Front and employed at the Battle of Verdun earlier in the year. The tactics would henceforth be used to an even greater degree by the Germans, who used stormtroopers and infiltration tactics to great effect in the 1918 Spring Offensive.

With the benefit of hindsight, it has been stated that Russia was not able to take advantage of its success nor cement it. In Russian society, pessimism regarding Russia&#x27;s prospects in the war and distrust in the competence of its military and political leadership would continue to grow in 1916.
==Casualties and losses==
Russian casualties were considerable, numbering between 500,000 and 1,000,000. Austro-Hungarian losses were around 616,000, while estimates place German losses at between 148,000 and 350,000. The Brusilov offensive is considered one of the most lethal offensives in world history.

However, the figure of 500,000 Russian casualties refers only to the period from May 28 to July 13, 1916, that is, the first stage of the offensive of the Russian Southwestern Front. A calculation from Russian military archives gives the following figure: 62,155 killed, 376,910 wounded and 59,802 missing. Total of 497,967 men for Russian Southwestern Front in just the first 1.5 months of the battle. And the losses of Austria-Hungary and Germany were 1,000,000 to 1,500,000 men for the period from June to December 1916.

<doc id="342329" wikidata="Q15980516" url="?curid=342329" title="Independent Working Class Association">
<text>The Independent Working Class Association (IWCA) is a minor political party in the United Kingdom that aims to promote the political and economic interests of the working class, regardless of the consequences to existing political and economic structures. It has been most successful in the Blackbird Leys and Wood Farm estates of Oxford and had a councillor on Oxford City Council until 2012, but was ultimately deregistered with the Electoral Commission in November 2020.

==Founding==
The IWCA was formed in 1995 by several organisations but primarily Red Action and Anti-Fascist Action. Initial sponsors included Communist Action Group, Colin Roach Centre, Open Polemic, Partisan, Red Action, the Revolutionary Communist Group and Socialist Parent. The founding groups argued that the likely election of a New Labour government would entrench the legacy of Thatcherism and further diminish the political influence of the working class. The IWCA describes its ideology as stemming from the trade union collectivism of the 1970s. It has received support from some anarchists, but it criticises the contemporary socialist movement, describing it as &quot;hopelessly middle class – and obsessed with Identity Politics&quot;.

From 1998, the IWCA formed groups in Birmingham, Oxford, Glasgow, the London boroughs of Islington and Hackney, and a few other areas. In 2003, it launched as a national organisation.

The IWCA slogan is &quot;working class rule in working class areas&quot;, and its policies are based on door-to-door surveying of people and asking them what are the problems where they live, then trying to work out ways of resolving them. In Birmingham and Oxford this meant working with local people on issues of anti-social behaviour, and in Hackney around, for example, school closures.

==Electoral performance==
IWCA got some of the best results ever in UK politics of independent radical candidates, and several elected in Oxford. In the 2002 Oxford City Council elections the IWCA achieved the election of a local councillor, Stuart Craft, with more than 40% of the vote in Northfield Brook ward. Three more candidates received over 20% of the vote in the local elections in London, in Heaton and Gooshays wards in Havering, Clerkenwell ward in Islington and Haggerston ward in Hackney. They won 22% in Bunhill ward in London in a by-election in 2003.

The IWCA was able to raise the £20,000 required for participation in the 2004 London mayoral election and nominated Lorna Reid, a resident and advice worker on the Highbury council estate. Her campaign focused on opposing anti-social behaviour by funding youth facilities and cleaning up estates, establish community restorative justice schemes, local drugs detox centres and progressive local taxation. Reid came ninth with 9,542 (0.5%) of the first preference votes and 39,678 (2.1%) of the second preferences.

In the local elections that took place on the same day, the IWCA picked up two more seats on Oxford City Council. Maurice Leen contested the seat of Oxford East for the IWCA in the 2005 UK general election, receiving 892 votes (2.1%).

At the 2006 local elections, they stood six candidates and gained a further seat from Labour, taking their total to four. However, they lost two of their Oxford council seats to Labour in May 2008. One of their councillors, Jane Lacey, stood down in 2010 to continue as a community campaigner, saying that she was disillusioned by the politics of the council.

In 2008, the Thurrock branch of the IWCA contested the seat of Stanford East and Corringham Town ward and came last with 98 votes, down from last with 144 votes in 2007 and behind the BNP&#x27;s 344 votes.

In March 2012 Stuart Craft, the last remaining IWCA local councillor in Oxford, announced to the &quot;Oxford Mail&quot; that he would not stand again in the May elections, after ten years as an IWCA councillor. He said, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t stand on people&#x27;s doorsteps any more, telling them we were going to change things when that wasn&#x27;t going to happen.&quot;

The party was deregistered with the Electoral Commission in November 2020.

==History==
In summer 2004, the Hackney branch of the IWCA split away to form Hackney Independent.

In 2006, the Oxford branch of the party won a libel action against Bill Baker, Deputy Leader of Oxford City Council, who had posted defamatory material alleging the IWCA had links to violent extremists and Irish Republican groups to homes in Donnington Brook in the run-up to the 2005 local elections. The IWCA, represented in their suit by Carter-Ruck, said it would use the £15,000 it collected in damages to fund their 2006 campaign.

In 2009 the two IWCA Oxford councillors missed a meeting at which an above-inflation rise in council tax of 4.5% was decided, due to work and family commitments. A tied vote was decided by the casting vote of the Labour Lord Mayor.

==Campaigns==
The IWCA has adopted tactics of community action to tackle anti-social behaviour, which has led to it being accused of vigilantism. In contrast to many other left-wing groups, the IWCA actively campaigns on crime affecting working-class people and a lack of services. It campaigns on issues of local concern such as council housing stock transfers, muggings and inner-city regeneration, and against social harm due to drug abuse. The group has also argued that many racial issues are symptoms of the wider issue of social deprivation, and for taking a stance against what it describes as multiculturalism in the belief that it encourages segregation.

== Cultural Impact ==
With its notable electoral results in Oxford in the early to mid-2000s, the IWCA is briefly mentioned in Patrick Keiller&#x27;s 2010 film &quot;Robinson in Ruins,&quot; which explores the social, political and natural history of Oxfordshire and its surrounds.

<text>Red Action was a British leftist political group formed in 1981. It became known for violently confronting groups such as the British National Party on the streets, and for being the main organisational force behind Anti-Fascist Action. In 1995, &quot;The Independent&quot; estimated that it had between 20 and 30 branches with 10–15 activists in each, and the paper stated that the group &quot;enthusiastically espouses the use of violence&quot;; it also set out links between Red Action and the Irish republican movement, and stated that members operated primarily in large cities such as London, Manchester, Leeds and Glasgow.

The group was formed by activists who had been expelled from the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) for their involvement in alleged &quot;squadism&quot; (violent actions against far right racist groups). The expelled activists regrouped around a paper named &quot;Red Action&quot;. After several years, the group became more interested in the electoral process, and it joined the Red Front electoral alliance in 1987 and the Socialist Alliance in England and Wales in 1999. Red Action members then left this organisation, along with the Socialist Party, citing the domination of the SWP over the organisation. Some Red Action members went on to found the Independent Working Class Association.

<doc id="342334" wikidata="Q41482" url="?curid=342334" title="Autopsy">
<text>An autopsy (also referred to as post-mortem examination, obduction, necropsy, or autopsia cadaverum) is a surgical procedure that consists of a thorough examination of a corpse by dissection to determine the cause, mode, and manner of death; or the exam may be performed to evaluate any disease or injury that may be present for research or educational purposes. The term &quot;necropsy&quot; is generally used for non-human animals.

Autopsies are usually performed by a specialized medical doctor called a pathologist. Only a small portion of deaths require an autopsy to be performed, under certain circumstances. In most cases, a medical examiner or coroner can determine the cause of death.

==Purposes of performance==
Autopsies are performed for either legal or medical purposes. Autopsies can be performed when any of the following information is desired:
* Manner of death must be determined
** Determine if death was natural or unnatural
** Injury source and extent on the corpse
* Post mortem interval
* Determining the deceased&#x27;s identity 
* Retain relevant organs
* If it is an infant, determine live birth and viability

For example, a forensic autopsy is carried out when the cause of death may be a criminal matter, while a clinical or academic autopsy is performed to find the medical cause of death and is used in cases of unknown or uncertain death, or for research purposes. Autopsies can be further classified into cases where an external examination suffices, and those where the body is dissected and an internal examination is conducted. Permission from next of kin may be required for internal autopsy in some cases. Once an internal autopsy is complete, the body is reconstituted by sewing it back together.

==Etymology==

===Autopsy===

The term &quot;autopsy&quot; derives from the Ancient Greek αὐτοψία &quot;autopsia&quot;, &quot;to see for oneself&quot;, derived from αὐτός (&quot;autos&quot;, &quot;oneself&quot;) and ὄψις (&quot;opsis&quot;, &quot;sight, view&quot;). The word has been in use since around the 17th century.

===Post-mortem===

The term &quot;post-mortem&quot; derives from the Latin &quot;post&quot;, &#x27;after&#x27;, and &quot;mortem&quot;, &#x27;death&#x27;. It was first recorded in 1734.

===Necropsy===
The term &quot;necropsy&quot; is derived from the Greek νεκρός &#x27;death&#x27; and ὄψις (&quot;opsis&quot;, &#x27;sight, view&#x27;).

==Purpose==
The principal aims of an autopsy are to determine the cause of death, mode of death, manner of death, the state of health of the person before he or she died, and whether any medical diagnosis and treatment before death were appropriate. In most Western countries the number of autopsies performed in hospitals has been decreasing every year since 1955. Critics, including pathologist and former &quot;JAMA&quot; editor George D. Lundberg, have charged that the reduction in autopsies is negatively affecting the care delivered in hospitals, because when mistakes result in death, they are often not investigated and lessons, therefore, remain unlearned. When a person has permitted an autopsy in advance of their death, autopsies may also be carried out for the purposes of teaching or medical research. An autopsy is usually performed in cases of sudden death, where a doctor is not able to write a death certificate, or when death is believed to result from an unnatural cause. These examinations are performed under a legal authority (medical examiner, coroner, or procurator fiscal) and do not require the consent of relatives of the deceased. The most extreme example is the examination of murder victims, especially when medical examiners are looking for signs of death or the murder method, such as bullet wounds and exit points, signs of strangulation, or traces of poison.
Some religions including Judaism and Islam usually discourage the performing of autopsies on their adherents. Organizations such as ZAKA in Israel and Misaskim in the United States generally guide families on how to ensure that an unnecessary autopsy is not made.
Autopsies are used in clinical medicine to identify a medical error or a previously unnoticed condition that may endanger the living, such as infectious diseases or exposure to hazardous materials.
A study that focused on myocardial infarction (heart attack) as a cause of death found significant errors of omission and commission, i.e. a sizable number of cases ascribed to myocardial infarctions (MIs) were not MIs and a significant number of non-MIs were MIs.

A systematic review of studies of the autopsy calculated that in about 25% of autopsies, a major diagnostic error will be revealed. However, this rate has decreased over time and the study projects that in a contemporary US institution, 8.4% to 24.4% of autopsies will detect major diagnostic errors.

A large meta-analysis suggested that approximately one-third of death certificates are incorrect and that half of the autopsies performed produced findings that were not suspected before the person died. Also, it is thought that over one-fifth of unexpected findings can only be diagnosed histologically, &quot;i.e.&quot;, by biopsy or autopsy, and that approximately one-quarter of unexpected findings, or 5% of all findings, are major and can similarly only be diagnosed from tissue.

One study found that (out of 694 diagnoses) &quot;Autopsies revealed 171 missed diagnoses, including 21 cancers, 12 strokes, 11 myocardial infarctions, 10 pulmonary emboli, and 9 endocarditis, among others&quot;.

Focusing on intubated patients, one study found &quot;abdominal pathologic conditions – abscesses, bowel perforations, or infarction – were as frequent as pulmonary emboli as a cause of class I errors. While patients with abdominal pathologic conditions generally complained of abdominal pain, results of an examination of the abdomen were considered unremarkable in most patients, and the symptom was not pursued&quot;.

== Types ==

There are four main types of autopsy:
* Medico-legal or forensic or coroner&#x27;s autopsies seek to find the cause and manner of death and to identify the decedent. They are generally performed, as prescribed by applicable law, in cases of violent, suspicious or sudden deaths, deaths without medical assistance, or during surgical procedures.
* Clinical or pathological autopsies are performed to diagnose a particular disease or for research purposes. They aim to determine, clarify, or confirm medical diagnoses that remained unknown or unclear before the patient&#x27;s death.
* Anatomical or academic autopsies are performed by students of anatomy for study purposes only.
* Virtual or medical imaging autopsies are performed utilizing imaging technology only, primarily magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT).

=== Forensic autopsy ===

A forensic autopsy is used to determine the cause, mode, and manner of death.

Forensic science involves the application of the sciences to answer questions of interest to the legal system.

Medical examiners attempt to determine the time of death, the exact cause of death, and what, if anything, preceded the death, such as a struggle. A forensic autopsy may include obtaining biological specimens from the deceased for toxicological testing, including stomach contents. Toxicology tests may reveal the presence of one or more chemical &quot;poisons&quot; (all chemicals, in sufficient quantities, can be classified as a poison) and their quantity. Because post-mortem deterioration of the body, together with the gravitational pooling of bodily fluids, will necessarily alter the bodily environment, toxicology tests may overestimate, rather than underestimate, the quantity of the suspected chemical.

Following an in-depth examination of all the evidence, a medical examiner or coroner will assign a manner of death from the choices proscribed by the fact-finder&#x27;s jurisdiction and will detail the evidence on the mechanism of the death.

=== Clinical autopsy ===

Clinical autopsies serve two major purposes. They are performed to gain more insight into pathological processes and determine what factors contributed to a patient&#x27;s death. For example, material for infectious disease testing can be collected during an autopsy. Autopsies are also performed to ensure the standard of care at hospitals. Autopsies can yield insight into how patient deaths can be prevented in the future.

Within the United Kingdom, clinical autopsies can be carried out only with the consent of the family of the deceased person, as opposed to a medico-legal autopsy instructed by a Coroner (England &amp; Wales) or Procurator Fiscal (Scotland), to which the family cannot object.

Over time, autopsies have not only been able to determine the cause of death, but have also led to discoveries of various diseases such as fetal alcohol syndrome, Legionnaire&#x27;s disease, and even viral hepatitis.

=== Academic autopsy ===
Academic autopsies are performed by students of anatomy for the purpose of study, giving medical students and residents firsthand experience viewing anatomy and pathology. Postmortem examinations require the skill to connect anatomic and clinical pathology together since they involve organ systems and interruptions from ante-mortem and post-mortem. These academic autopsies allow for students to practice and develop skills in pathology and become meticulous in later case examinations.

=== Virtual autopsy ===
Virtual autopsies are performed using radiographic techniques which can be used in post-mortem examinations for a deceased individual. It is an alternative to medical autopsies, where radiographs are used, for example, Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and Computed tomography (CT scan) which produce radiographic images in order to determine the cause of death, the nature, and the manner of death, without dissecting the deceased. It can also be used in the identification of the deceased. This method is helpful in determining the questions pertaining to an autopsy without putting the examiner at risk of biohazardous materials that can be in an individual&#x27;s body.

== Prevalence ==
In 2004 in England and Wales, there were 514,000 deaths, of which 225,500 were referred to the coroner. Of those, 115,800 (22.5% of all deaths) resulted in post-mortem examinations and there were 28,300 inquests, 570 with a jury.

The rate of consented (hospital) autopsy in the UK and worldwide has declined rapidly over the past 50 years. In the UK in 2013, only 0.7% of inpatient adult deaths were followed by consented autopsy.

The autopsy rate in Germany is below 5% and thus much lower than in other countries in Europe. The governmental reimbursement is hardly sufficient to cover all the costs, so the medical journal &quot;Deutsches Ärzteblatt&quot;, issued by the German Medical Association, makes the effort to raise awareness regarding the underfinancing of autopsies. The same sources stated that autopsy rates in Sweden and Finland reach 20 to 30%.

In the United States, autopsy rates fell from 17% in 1980 to 14% in 1985 and 11.5% in 1989, although the figures vary notably from county to county.

== Process ==

The body is received at a medical examiner&#x27;s office, municipal mortuary, or hospital in a body bag or evidence sheet. A new body bag is used for each body to ensure that only evidence from that body is contained within the bag. Evidence sheets are an alternative way to transport the body. An evidence sheet is a sterile sheet that covers the body when it is moved. If it is believed there may be any significant evidence on the hands, for example, gunshot residue or skin under the fingernails, a separate paper sack is put around each hand and taped shut around the wrist.

There are two parts to the physical examination of the body: the external and internal examination. Toxicology, biochemical tests or genetic testing/molecular autopsy often supplement these and frequently assist the pathologist in assigning the cause or causes of death.

=== External examination ===
At many institutions, the person responsible for handling, cleaning, and moving the body is called a diener, the German word for &quot;servant&quot;. In the UK this role is performed by an Anatomical Pathology Technician (APT), who will also assist the pathologist in eviscerating the body and reconstruction after the autopsy. After the body is received, it is first photographed. The examiner then notes the kind of clothes - if any - and their position on the body before they are removed. Next, any evidence such as residue, flakes of paint, or other material is collected from the external surfaces of the body. Ultraviolet light may also be used to search body surfaces for any evidence not easily visible to the naked eye. Samples of hair, nails, and the like are taken, and the body may also be radiographically imaged. Once the external evidence is collected, the body is removed from the bag, undressed, and any wounds present are examined. The body is then cleaned, weighed, and measured in preparation for the internal examination.

A general description of the body as regards ethnic group, sex, age, hair colour and length, eye colour, and other distinguishing features (birthmarks, old scar tissue, moles, tattoos, etc.) is then made. A voice recorder or a standard examination form is normally used to record this information.

In some countries, &quot;e.g.&quot;, Scotland, France, Germany, Russia, and Canada, an autopsy may comprise an external examination only. This concept is sometimes termed a &quot;view and grant&quot;. The principle behind this is that the medical records, history of the deceased and circumstances of death have all indicated as to the cause and manner of death without the need for an internal examination.

=== Internal examination ===
If not already in place, a plastic or rubber brick called a &quot;head block&quot; is placed under the shoulders of the corpse; hyperflexion of the neck makes the spine arch backward while stretching and pushing the chest upward to make it easier to incise. This gives the APT, or pathologist, maximum exposure to the trunk. After this is done, the internal examination begins. The internal examination consists of inspecting the internal organs of the body by dissection for evidence of trauma or other indications of the cause of death. For the internal examination there are a number of different approaches available:
* a large and deep Y-shaped incision can be made starting at the top of each shoulder and running down the front of the chest, meeting at the lower point of the sternum (breastbone).
* a curved incision made from the tips of each shoulder, in a semi-circular line across the chest/decolletage, to approximately the level of the second rib, curving back up to the opposite shoulder.
* a single vertical incision is made from the sternal notch at the base of the neck.
* a U-shaped incision is made at the tip of both shoulders, down along the side of the chest to the bottom of the rib cage, following it. This is typically used on women and during chest-only autopsies.
There is no need for any incision to be made, which will be visible after completion of the examination when the deceased is dressed in a shroud.
In all of the above cases, the incision then extends all the way down to the pubic bone (making a deviation to either side of the navel) and avoiding, where possible, transecting any scars that may be present.

Bleeding from the cuts is minimal, or non-existent because the pull of gravity is producing the only blood pressure at this point, related directly to the complete lack of cardiac functionality. However, in certain cases, there is anecdotal evidence that bleeding can be quite profuse, especially in cases of drowning.

At this point, shears are used to open the chest cavity. The examiner uses the tool to cut through the ribs on the costal cartilage, to allow the sternum to be removed; this is done so that the heart and lungs can be seen in situ and that the heartin particular, the pericardial sacis not damaged or disturbed from opening. A PM 40 knife is used to remove the sternum from the soft tissue that attaches it to the mediastinum. Now the lungs and the heart are exposed. The sternum is set aside and will eventually be replaced at the end of the autopsy.

At this stage, the organs are exposed. Usually, the organs are removed in a systematic fashion. Making a decision as to what order the organs are to be removed will depend highly on the case in question. Organs can be removed in several ways: The first is the &quot;en masse&quot; technique of Letulle whereby all the organs are removed as one large mass. The second is the en bloc method of Ghon. The most popular in the UK is a modified version of this method, which is divided into four groups of organs. Although these are the two predominant evisceration techniques, in the UK variations on these are widespread.

One method is described here: The pericardial sac is opened to view the heart. Blood for chemical analysis may be removed from the inferior vena cava or the pulmonary veins. Before removing the heart, the pulmonary artery is opened in order to search for a blood clot. The heart can then be removed by cutting the inferior vena cava, the pulmonary veins, the aorta and pulmonary artery, and the superior vena cava. This method leaves the aortic arch intact, which will make things easier for the embalmer. The left lung is then easily accessible and can be removed by cutting the bronchus, artery, and vein at the hilum. The right lung can then be similarly removed. The abdominal organs can be removed one by one after first examining their relationships and vessels.

Most pathologists, however, prefer the organs to be removed all in one &quot;block&quot;. Using dissection of the fascia, blunt dissection; using the fingers or hands and traction; the organs are dissected out in one piece for further inspection and sampling. During autopsies of infants, this method is used almost all of the time. The various organs are examined, weighed and tissue samples in the form of slices are taken. Even major blood vessels are cut open and inspected at this stage. Next, the stomach and intestinal contents are examined and weighed. This could be useful to find the cause and time of death, due to the natural passage of food through the bowel during digestion. The more area empty, the longer the deceased had gone without a meal before death.

The body block that was used earlier to elevate the chest cavity is now used to elevate the head. To examine the brain, an incision is made from behind one ear, over the crown of the head, to a point behind the other ear. When the autopsy is completed, the incision can be neatly sewn up and is not noticed when the head is resting on a pillow in an open casket funeral. The scalp is pulled away from the skull in two flaps with the front flap going over the face and the rear flap over the back of the neck. The skull is then cut with a circular (or semicircular) bladed reciprocating saw to create a &quot;cap&quot; that can be pulled off, exposing the brain. The brain is then observed in situ. Then the brain&#x27;s connections to the cranial nerves and spinal cord are severed, and the brain is lifted out of the skull for further examination. If the brain needs to be preserved before being inspected, it is contained in a large container of formalin (15 percent solution of formaldehyde gas in buffered water) for at least two, but preferably four weeks. This not only preserves the brain, but also makes it firmer, allowing easier handling without corrupting the tissue.

=== Reconstitution of the body ===
An important component of the autopsy is the reconstitution of the body such that it can be viewed, if desired, by relatives of the deceased following the procedure. After the examination, the body has an open and empty thoracic cavity with chest flaps open on both sides; the top of the skull is missing, and the skull flaps are pulled over the face and neck. It is unusual to examine the face, arms, hands or legs internally.

In the UK, following the Human Tissue Act 2004 all organs and tissue must be returned to the body unless permission is given by the family to retain any tissue for further investigation. Normally the internal body cavity is lined with cotton, wool, or a similar material, and the organs are then placed into a plastic bag to prevent leakage and are returned to the body cavity. The chest flaps are then closed and sewn back together and the skull cap is sewed back in place. Then the body may be wrapped in a shroud, and it is common for relatives to not be able to tell the procedure has been done when the body is viewed in a funeral parlor after embalming.

==In stroke==

An autopsy of stroke may be able to establish the time taken from the onset of cerebral infarction to the time of death.

Various microscopic findings are present at times from infarction as follows:


== History ==

Around 3000 BCE, ancient Egyptians were one of the first civilizations to practice the removal and examination of the internal organs of humans in the religious practice of mummification.

Autopsies that opened the body to determine the cause of death were attested at least in the early third millennium BCE, although they were opposed in many ancient societies where it was believed that the outward disfigurement of dead persons prevented them from entering the afterlife (as with the Egyptians, who removed the organs through tiny slits in the body). Notable Greek autopsists were Erasistratus and Herophilus of Chalcedon, who lived in 3rd century BCE Alexandria, but in general, autopsies were rare in ancient Greece. In 44 BCE, Julius Caesar was the subject of an official autopsy after his murder by rival senators, the physician&#x27;s report noting that the second stab wound Caesar received was the fatal one. Julius Caesar had been stabbed a total of 23 times. By around 150 BCE, ancient Roman legal practice had established clear parameters for autopsies. The greatest ancient anatomist was Galen (CE 129– ), whose findings would not be challenged until the Renaissance over a thousand years later.
Ibn Tufail has elaborated on autopsy in his treatise called &quot;Hayy ibn Yaqzan&quot; and Nadia Maftouni, discussing the subject in an extensive article, believes him to be among the early supporters of autopsy and vivisection.

The dissection of human remains for medical or scientific reasons continued to be practiced irregularly after the Romans, for instance by the Arab physicians Avenzoar and Ibn al-Nafis. In Europe they were done with enough regularity to become skilled, as early as 1200, and successful efforts to preserve the body, by filling the veins with wax and metals. Until the 20th century, it was thought that the modern autopsy process derived from the anatomists of the Renaissance. Giovanni Battista Morgagni (1682–1771), celebrated as the father of anatomical pathology, wrote the first exhaustive work on pathology, &quot;De Sedibus et Causis Morborum per Anatomen Indagatis&quot; (The Seats and Causes of Diseases Investigated by Anatomy, 1769).

In 1543, Andreas Vesalius conducted a public dissection of the body of a former criminal. He asserted and articulated the bones, this became the world&#x27;s oldest surviving anatomical preparation. It is still displayed at the Anatomical Museum at the University of Basel.

In the mid-1800s, Carl von Rokitansky and colleagues at the Second Vienna Medical School began to undertake dissections as a means to improve diagnostic medicine.

The 19th-century medical researcher Rudolf Virchow, in response to a lack of standardization of autopsy procedures, established and published specific autopsy protocols (one such protocol still bears his name). He also developed the concept of pathological processes.

During the turn of the 20th century, the Scotland Yard created the Office of the Forensic Pathologist, a medical examiner trained in medicine, charged with investigating the cause of all unnatural deaths, including accidents, homicides, suicides, etc.

==Other animals (necropsy)==
A post-mortem examination, or necropsy, is far more common in veterinary medicine than in human medicine. For many species that exhibit few external symptoms (sheep), or that are not suited to detailed clinical examination (poultry, cage birds, zoo animals), it is a common method used by veterinary physicians to come to a diagnosis. A necropsy is mostly used like an autopsy to determine the cause of death. The entire body is examined at the gross visual level, and samples are collected for additional analyses.

<text>In telecommunications, out-of-band activity is activity outside a defined frequency band, or, metaphorically, outside of any primary communication channel. Protection from falsing is among its purposes.

==Examples==
===General usage===
* Out-of-band agreement, an agreement or understanding between the communicating parties that is not included in any message sent over the channel but which is relevant for the interpretation of such messages
* More broadly, communication by any channel other than the primary channel can be considered &quot;out-of-band&quot;. For example, given a website&#x27;s primary communication method is the internet, out-of-band communication may be an SMS message or even beeps produced by a speaker on the server itself.

===Telecommunications===
* Out-of-band signaling, the exchange of call control information in a separate band from the data or voice stream, or on an entirely separate, dedicated channel

===Computing===
* Out-of-band data, in computer networking, a separate stream of data from the main data stream
* Out-of-band management, in computer administration, system console access, even in the event of primary network subsystem failure
* Out-of-band authentication, user authentication over a network or channel separate from the primary network or channel; used in multi-factor authentication
* Out-of-band software documentation, documentation that is not provided together with the software it documents. This contrasts with Unix and Unix-like systems, for example, where software is documented through the means of &quot;on-line&quot; (meaning &quot;&#x27;on a main computer&#x27;&quot;, not &quot;&#x27;over the internet&quot;&#x27;) man pages provided as a component of the operating system. Out-of-band documentation, whether on web pages or in printed form, can suffer from a mismatch regarding the version and the exact set of features that are being documented.

==See also==
* In-band signaling
* Ident protocol

<text>The University of Geneva (French: &quot;Université de Genève&quot;) is a public research university located in Geneva, Switzerland. It was founded in 1559 by French theologian John Calvin as a theological seminary. It remained focused on theology until the 17th century, when it became a center for enlightenment scholarship. Today, it is the third largest university in Switzerland by number of students.

In 1873, it dropped its religious affiliations and became officially secular. In 2009, the University of Geneva celebrated the 450th anniversary of its founding. Almost 40% of the students come from foreign countries.

The university holds and actively pursues teaching, research, and community service as its primary objectives. UNIGE is a member of the League of European Research Universities (including academic institutions such as Amsterdam, Barcelona, Cambridge, Heidelberg, and Milan) the Coimbra Group and the European University Association.

The university has a diverse student body, with students from over 150 countries. It is also home to numerous research centers and institutes, including the Global Studies Institute, and the Institute of Global Health.

==History==
The university was founded in 1559 as the Academy of Geneva (&quot;Académie de Genève&quot;) by French theologian John Calvin, as a seminary administered by the Company of Pastors, to be the center of public education in Protestant Geneva. With the goal of educating not only pastors but also magistrates for the republic, in 1565 the academy began the teaching of Law.

During the French annexation of Geneva (1798–1813), the school was reorganized into a more universal format, with the introduction of degrees and its division in faculties. This process of modernization continued into the period of national Restoration.

In 1964, Sophie Kanza became the first Congolese woman to graduate from a university when she received her diploma from the University of Geneva with a degree in sociology.

==Location==
The University of Geneva is located in several districts in the eastern part of the city and in the nearby city of Carouge (on the left bank of the Lake Léman and the Rhône), and the different buildings are sometimes very distant from each other (the Battelle buildings are for instance more than three kilometers away from the Bastions). The oldest building (1559) is the Collège Calvin, and is no longer a university building. Lectures are given in six different main locations, &quot;Les Bastions&quot;, &quot;Uni Dufour&quot;, &quot;Sciences&quot; &quot;I&quot;, &quot;II&quot; and &quot;III&quot;, &quot;Uni Mail&quot; and &quot;Uni Pignon&quot;, &quot;Centre Médical Universitaire&quot; (CMU), and &quot;Battelle&quot;; as well as in other less important locations. 

===Uni Bastions===
Built between 1868 and 1871, &quot;Uni Bastions&quot; is the symbol of Geneva&#x27;s academic life. It is located in the middle of a park and is host to the faculty of Protestant Theology and to the Faculty of Arts.

===Uni Dufour===

Its architecture was inspired by Le Corbusier. It hosts the &quot;Rectorat&quot; and the administration of the university.

<doc id="342353" wikidata="Q335324" url="?curid=342353" title="Duff Cooper">
<text>Alfred Duff Cooper, 1st Viscount Norwich, (22 February 1890 – 1 January 1954), known as Duff Cooper, was a British Conservative Party politician and diplomat who was also a military and political historian.

First elected to Parliament in 1924, he lost his seat in 1929 but returned to Parliament in the 1931 Westminster St George&#x27;s by-election, which was seen as a referendum on Stanley Baldwin&#x27;s leadership of the Conservative Party. He later served in the Cabinet as Secretary of State for War and First Lord of the Admiralty. He resigned from the cabinet over the Munich agreement of 1938.

When Winston Churchill became prime minister in May 1940, he named Cooper as Minister of Information. In 1941, as a member of the Cabinet, he served as British Minister in Singapore before its fall to the Japanese. He later served an important role as representative to Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s Free France (1943–44) and ambassador to France from 1944 to 1948.

==Background and education==
Duff Cooper was born at Cavendish Square. He was the only son of society doctor Sir Alfred Cooper (1843–1908), a surgeon who specialised in the sexual diseases of the upper classes (his carriage was humorously known as &quot;Cooper&#x27;s Clap Trap&quot;) and Lady Agnes Duff, daughter of James Duff, 5th Earl Fife and descendant of King William IV. She had already eloped with two husbands, the first of whom she deserted and the second of whom died, before marrying Cooper in 1882. Duff Cooper had three older sisters and one older half sister from his mother&#x27;s first marriage. He attended two prep schools, including Wixenford. He was unhappy at prep school, but was then very happy at Eton College.

==Oxford and early career==
At New College Oxford (1908–11), Cooper&#x27;s Eton friendship with John Neville Manners won him entry into a circle of young aristocrats and intellectuals known as &quot;The Coterie&quot;, including Patrick Shaw-Stewart, Raymond Asquith, Sir Denis Anson, Edward Horner and Lady Diana Manners. Cooper cultivated a reputation for eloquence and fast living and, although he had established a reputation as a poet, he earned an even stronger reputation for gambling, womanising and drinking in his studied emulation of the life of the 18th- and 19th-century Whig statesman Charles James Fox. Cooper&#x27;s memory and gift for writing enabled him to do reasonably well at exams. He obtained a second in Modern History.

Following Oxford, Cooper entered the Foreign Service in October 1913, at the third attempt. During the war he worked in the commercial and the contraband departments. Owing to the national importance of his work at the cipher desk, he was exempted from military service until June 1917, when he joined the Grenadier Guards. He had not actively sought to join the army but was happy to be &quot;released&quot; as a result of the manpower shortage, as he thought joining the Army the decent thing to do. To his surprise, most of his fellow officer cadets were working-class and lower-middle-class men, almost all of whom had already served in the ranks.

Cooper spent six months on the Western Front, during which, Philip Ziegler writes, he proved himself &quot;exceptionally courageous, resourceful, and a natural leader of men&quot;, at a time when the life expectancy of junior officers was very brief. He suffered a minor wound in the advance to the Albert Canal in August 1918, and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for conspicuous gallantry, a rare decoration for a junior officer. The citation for his DSO appeared in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; in November 1918 and reads as follows:

Almost all his closest friends, including Shaw-Stewart, Horner and Asquith were killed in the war, allowing him to draw closer to Lady Diana Manners, a socialite who was known for her eccentricities.

==Post-war and marriage==
After demobilisation, he returned to the Egypt Department, and was then Private Secretary to the Parliamentary Under-Secretary (i.e., assistant to the junior minister). He needed money to enter politics. He played significant roles in the Egyptian and Turkish crises in the early 1920s.

On 2 June 1919, he married Lady Diana Manners, whose family were initially opposed to the match. Diana&#x27;s mother in particular thought Cooper a promiscuous drinker and gambler who was without title, position or wealth. Diana was officially the daughter of the 8th Duke of Rutland, but was widely believed—by herself included—to be the natural daughter of Harry Cust, a Belvoir Castle neighbour, and MP. In 1923, Lady Diana played the Madonna in the Max Reinhardt play &quot;The Miracle&quot;. The money which she earned enabled Cooper to resign from the Foreign Office in July 1924.

Lady Diana tolerated Cooper&#x27;s numerous affairs. These included the Franco-American Singer sewing-machine heiress Daisy Fellowes, the socialite Gloria Guinness, the French novelist Louise Leveque de Vilmorin and the writer Susan Mary Alsop (then an American diplomat&#x27;s wife, by whom he had an illegitimate son, William Patten Jr, who later fathered W. Samuel Patten). The polo player &quot;Boy&quot; Capel&#x27;s wife Diana and the Anglo-Irish socialite and fashion model Maxime de la Falaise were two more, although Lady Diana reportedly did not mind and loved him nonetheless, explaining to their son: &quot;They were the flowers, but I was the tree&quot;.

==Political career, 1924–1939==
===1924–1931: In and out of Parliament===
Within weeks Cooper was selected for the winnable seat of Oldham, where he was elected at the general election in October 1924, with a 13,000 majority over the sitting Labour member. He made a very successful maiden speech on Egypt, which was praised by H. A. L. Fisher who spoke next. The speech was also praised in several newspaper accounts. He was seen as a &quot;coming man&quot; within the party. Cooper was a stalwart supporter of Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, and a friend of Chancellor of the Exchequer, Winston Churchill. In January 1928 he was appointed Financial Secretary to the War Office, not a job he would have chosen. The Secretary of State Sir Laming Worthington-Evans gave him a lot of responsibility. He very likely would have been promoted if the Conservatives had won the election in 1929, but they were defeated and Cooper lost his own seat.

John Julius, his only legitimate child, was born in 1929. Out of Parliament, Cooper wrote a biography of the French statesman Talleyrand. He wrote slowly but seldom needed to revise his drafts. Ziegler writes that &quot;rarely can subject and author have been more satisfactorily matched&quot; as both men were worldly and disliked cant. The book was eventually published in 1932 by his nephew Rupert Hart-Davis to critical praise and lasting success.

===1931–1935: By-election and junior minister===
The March 1931 by-election for the constituency of Westminster St George&#x27;s (caused by the death of Cooper&#x27;s recent boss, Laming Worthington-Evans), saw Beaverbrook&#x27;s Empire Free Trade Crusade party threatening the Conservative position at a time when satisfaction with Baldwin&#x27;s leadership was at a low. When the original Conservative candidate, John Moore-Brabazon, stepped down, Duff Cooper agreed to contest the election in what was regarded as a referendum on Baldwin&#x27;s leadership. He won the seat with a majority of 5,710, thus returning to Parliament and serving until 1945.

In August 1931, on the formation of the National Government, he was appointed Financial Secretary to the War Office under the elderly Lord Crewe, who left Cooper to do a great deal of the work. In June 1934 he was appointed Financial Secretary to the Treasury, a traditional stepping stone to the Cabinet. This brought him close to the Chancellor of the Exchequer Neville Chamberlain, who thought highly of him. He had been to Germany, and had seen and been appalled by a Nuremberg Rally. Chamberlain told him to tone down his criticisms of Hitler. Cooper urged rearmament, not then a fashionable view, and briefed Churchill, then on the backbenches, that Hitler was serious and wanted war.

===Haig biography===
Cooper, keen to make a literary name for himself, was approached by the executors of Field Marshal Haig in March 1933 to write his official biography, after a number of military and literary figures had declined. He insisted on full access to Haig&#x27;s papers and relied heavily on Haig&#x27;s (as yet unpublished) diaries. Haig&#x27;s widow then had second thoughts and wrote a book of her own, &quot;The Man I Knew&quot;, whose publication Faber and Faber delayed with legal action until after Duff Cooper had published his two volumes in 1935 and 1936.

Stephen Heathorn describes Cooper&#x27;s biography as &quot;the apogee of the admiring biography [of Haig]&quot;, following in the tradition of previous works by Dewar &amp; Boraston (1922), George Arthur (1928) and John Charteris (1929). He stressed Haig&#x27;s strong and upright character, as if he were writing about a Victorian hero. He wrote that there was &quot;no room for thoughts of petty malice or of mean revenge in that high and honourable man&quot; (Vol. 2, p. 98) and that &quot;in moral stature Haig was a giant&quot; (pp. 440–1). David Lloyd George&#x27;s memoirs were appearing as Cooper was writing and some of his book was devoted to addressing Lloyd George&#x27;s arguments. Cooper argued that Haig&#x27;s offensive on the Somme saved the French at Verdun, that Haig improved Anglo-French relations and that he defeated the Germans through inflicting attrition on them at the Somme and Third Ypres. The book received many generous reviews and remained the leading biography of Haig until John Terraine&#x27;s &quot;The Educated Soldier&quot; in 1963.

Historians&#x27; view of Haig would be dramatically changed by the 1952 publication of his Private Papers (which revealed his political intrigues, and his private uncharitable view of various British officers and politicians and of the French in general). At that time Cooper admitted to Robert Blake, the editor of that work, that he had been influenced by the politics of the 1930s and the desire to facilitate Anglo-French rapprochement. Modern views of Cooper&#x27;s biography are less favourable: George Egerton writing in &quot;The Journal of Modern History&quot; in 1988 detected a conflict between Cooper the writer, who concealed the degree to which Haig like everybody else was dwarfed by events and the historian who was too honest to pretend he dominated them. Ziegler writes that the book was criticised for pro-Haig bias and what Ziegler calls &quot;lack of consideration&quot;.

===1935–1938: Cabinet and resignation===

In November 1935, after the general election, Cooper was promoted to the Cabinet as Secretary of State for War and appointed to the Privy Council. During the Abdication Crisis he was sympathetic to Edward VIII and to the possibility of a morganatic marriage, and in vain advised him to wait until after his coronation (due in 1937) before picking a fight with the government over his plans to marry Wallis Simpson.

He felt out of kilter with the Conservative leadership and was surprised when the new Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain appointed him First Lord of the Admiralty in May 1937. Ziegler writes that his tenure of office was &quot;an unequivocal success&quot;. He enjoyed high living on board the Admiralty yacht HMS &quot;Enchantress&quot;, but fought Chamberlain and the Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon for more spending on the Royal Navy. Chamberlain saw him as indiscreet and as a firebrand. By the time of the Munich Agreement, Cooper was isolated in the Cabinet as the most public critic of Chamberlain&#x27;s appeasement policy.

On 3 October 1938, a few days after the Munich Agreement, he denounced it and resigned from the Cabinet. On doing so he said, &quot;War with honour or peace with dishonour&quot;, he might have been persuaded to accept, &quot;but war with dishonour—that was too much&quot;. Fellow appeasement-critic and Conservative Party MP Vyvyan Adams described Cooper&#x27;s actions as &quot;the first step in the road back to national sanity&quot;.

As a backbencher, he joined the coterie around Anthony Eden (who had resigned as Foreign Secretary in February 1938), but made only muted criticisms of the Government. His main source of income was writing articles for the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;. He argued for an Anglo-French alliance.

==Second World War: Minister of Information==
By now German propaganda ranked Cooper with Churchill and Eden as Britain&#x27;s most dangerous Conservative warmongers. Unlike the other two, Cooper was not offered a job on the outbreak of war in September 1939. He went on a lecture tour of the US, where he called for the democracies to stand firm against the dictatorships, and predicted that Churchill would become Prime Minister, which seemed an eccentric prediction at the time.

From May 1940 he was Minister of Information under Churchill, but disliked the job. His son John Julius said that his father was &quot;out of sympathy&quot; with the job from the beginning because he was opposed to censorship. The press, led by the newspaper magnate Lord Beaverbrook and his &quot;Daily Express&quot;, portrayed Cooper as a spin doctor and as an enemy of a free press. His Wartime Social Survey inquirers into the state of public morale were known as &quot;Cooper&#x27;s snoopers&quot;. He authorised a strong denunciation of the author P. G. Wodehouse for making an ill-advised humorous broadcast from Berlin. He and Lady Diana sent their eleven-year-old son John Julius to the US in 1940, as they feared that Cooper&#x27;s being on Hitler&#x27;s blacklist might lead to their son being killed or taken as a hostage in the event of a German invasion. Many of Cooper&#x27;s friends and colleagues took a dim view of this, and it earned Cooper further criticism in the press and some hostile questioning from MPs in Parliament. John Julius returned two years later.

==Second World War: Singapore==
In July 1941 Cooper was appointed Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, to his relief. He was one of a number of Churchill&#x27;s proteges promoted in the July 1941 reshuffle: Duncan Sandys became Financial Secretary at the War Office and Brendan Bracken became Minister of Information. Cuthbert Headlam wrote of Cooper at this time that &quot;he has failed in every job he has been given, is clearly incompetent as an administrator, but belongs to the Winston clique.&quot;

Cooper was sent to Singapore as Minister Resident, charged with reporting on the situation in the Far East and the state of British defences. He had the authority to form a War Cabinet there, but both military and civil authorities were reluctant to cooperate with him. To his relief Archibald Wavell was appointed Supreme Commander ABDA. He was—unfairly in Ziegler&#x27;s view—blamed for the fall of Singapore after his return to the UK, and was not given another major post for a year and a half. In the meantime he chaired the Cabinet Committee on Security, and did a lot of writing, spending his weekends at Bognor where his wife had a smallholding.

==Ambassador to France==
In December 1943 Cooper was appointed British Representative on the Free French French Committee of National Liberation. His remit included maintaining a working relationship between Churchill and de Gaulle, two men whom he found equally difficult. Paris was liberated in August 1944 and he moved there in September. On 18 November 1944 he formally presented his credentials as British Ambassador to France. He was to prove a very popular ambassador, with Lady Diana helping to make his term of office a great social success. Some contemporary eyebrows were raised at his willingness to entertain people with dubious records during the recent war, or his lack of interest at entertaining trade unionists. In the words of the British historian P. M. H. Bell, Cooper was such a &quot;devoted Francophile&quot; that during his time as ambassador to Paris he often tried the patience of the Foreign Office by going well beyond his instructions to maintain good relations with France by trying to create an Anglo-French alliance that would dominate post-war Europe.

Despite being a Conservative, Cooper was not replaced as Ambassador when Labour won the 1945 election as Ernest Bevin, the new Foreign Secretary, valued an ambassador who was close friends with so many French politicians and even managed to have a friendship of sorts with de Gaulle. In January 1947, Cooper, acting without orders, began the process that led to the Treaty of Dunkirk when he suggested to the French premier Leon Blum that there should an Anglo-French military alliance, an idea Blum took up thinking this was an offer from London. The Treaty, which fulfilled his long-held desire for an Anglo-French alliance, was signed on 4 March 1947.

Cooper&#x27;s term as ambassador ended at the end of 1947. He bequeathed a large part of his library to the British Embassy in Paris. To the dismay of his successor he remained in Paris, living at the Château Saint-Firmin in the Park of Chantilly.

==Retirement==
Cooper was raised to the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG) in 1948. He took on some company directorships, including that of the Wagons-Lits company, but essentially devoted the rest of his life to writing. During the war he had written a life of the Biblical King David, and in 1949 he published &quot;Sergeant Shakespeare&quot;, a book about Shakespeare&#x27;s early life. The Cabinet Office tried in vain, on security grounds, to block publication of his only novel, &quot;Operation Heartbreak&quot; (1950), as it was based on the real Operation Mincemeat, a successful British deception operation of the Second World War to disguise the 1943 Allied invasion of Sicily. The book was republished by Persephone Books in 2004.

He was created Viscount Norwich of Aldwick in the County of Sussex, in 1952, in recognition of his political and literary career. The title was not popular with some of the local dignitaries. His wife refused to be called Lady Norwich, claiming that it sounded too much like &quot;porridge&quot; and promptly took out a newspaper advertisement declaring that she would retain her previous style of Lady Diana Cooper. Cooper&#x27;s sixth and final book was his acclaimed memoirs, &quot;Old Men Forget&quot;, which appeared on 5 July 1953. &quot;The Duff Cooper Diaries: 1915–1951&quot;, edited by his son John Julius Norwich, appeared posthumously in 2005.

==Death==
Cooper was intemperate in his drinking (and eating) habits throughout his adult life. As a result, in later life he developed cirrhosis of the liver, and œsophageal varices. This resulted in his suffering a fatal gastro-intestinal hæmorrhage on 31 December 1953 when he was on board the French liner &quot;Colombie&quot;. The ship&#x27;s doctor was unable to arrest the bleeding and he died suddenly, from hypovolæmic shock, on 1 January 1954 aged 63. The ship docked at the Spanish port of Vigo so his body could be flown back to England, where he was buried in the mausoleum of the Manners family at Belvoir Castle in the Vale of Belvoir, Leicestershire. His estate was valued for probate at £14,303 7s ().

==Legacy==
After Cooper&#x27;s death, a British literary award, the Duff Cooper Prize, was established in his name. His biographer Ziegler wrote that Cooper was &quot;not totally successful in worldly terms but never dull&quot;, though he was &quot;arrogant, self-indulgent and selfish, and devoted far too much time and energy to wine, women and gambling&quot;. However, he was &quot;never mean or ignoble&quot; and was &quot;a proud patriot&quot; who sometimes had &quot;true nobility&quot;, although he was &quot;too proud to court popularity&quot; and too reserved to attract it readily.

On 28 November 2021, Cooper was posthumously awarded the Order of the White Lion, the highest decoration of Czechoslovakia and the Czech Republic, in recognition of his opposition to the Munich Agreement.

==In popular culture==
H. G. Wells, in &quot;The Shape of Things to Come&quot; which was published in 1934, predicted a Second World War in which Britain would not participate but would vainly try to effect a peaceful compromise. In this vision, Duff Cooper was mentioned as one of several prominent Britons delivering &quot;brilliant pacific speeches&quot; which &quot;echo throughout Europe&quot; but fail to end the war; the other would-be peacemakers, in Wells&#x27; vision, included Leslie Hore Belisha, Ellen Wilkinson and Randolph Churchill.

==Family and ancestry==
Cooper was married to Lady Diana from 1919 to his death and their only child was John Julius Norwich (1929–2018), who became well known as a writer and television presenter. Cooper&#x27;s granddaughter Artemis has published several books, including &quot;A Durable Fire: The Letters of Duff and Diana Cooper, 1913–50&quot;.

One of Cooper&#x27;s maternal great-great-grandfathers was King William IV. He fathered eight illegitimate children with Dorothea Jordan, including Lady Elizabeth FitzClarence. She married William Hay, 18th Earl of Erroll, and one of their children was Lady Agnes Hay, Cooper&#x27;s grandmother. Lady Agnes married James Duff, 5th Earl Fife, and they had five children including Cooper&#x27;s mother, Lady Agnes Duff. Cooper&#x27;s sister Stephanie was the paternal great-grandmother of former prime minister David Cameron.

<doc id="342354" wikidata="Q3153027" url="?curid=342354" title="Intendant of New France">
<text>The Intendant of New France was an administrative position in the French colony of New France. He controlled the colony&#x27;s entire civil administration. He gave particular attention to settlement and economic development, and to the administration of justice. The office of the Intendant of New France was created by Louis XIV. In 1663, Louis and his minister decided to give New France a new constitution. The charter of the One Hundred Associates was cancelled and the old Council of Quebec, which was formed in 1647, reorganized and became the Sovereign Council of New France. The Sovereign Council was composed of the governor, the bishop, the intendant, an attorney-general, a secretary, and five councillors. Because the Intendant of New France managed the financial matters like money and so on, as well as the infrastructure of the colony, he had an enormous amount of influence in the colony&#x27;s government.

==Origin of position==

During the century and a half preceding the French Revolution, the main administrative organization of France was known as the Généralité. At the head of this division was placed the Intendant of Justice, Police and Finance. The intendant was, according to W. B. Munro, &quot;armed with very extensive administrative powers, distinguished by his loyalty to the interests of the king, and in a sense reflecting the absolutism of the monarchy.&quot; The intendant was bound to no authorities, statutes or regulations. He was appointed by, removable by, and responsible to the King alone.

In France, the intendants had an essential role to play in the administrative machinery. According to Pierre Clément, they were required to deal with acts of oppression by officials, to the death penalty. Additionally, they kept watching over provisions, supplies and the condition of the prisons. The attorneys-general informed the intendants of all abuses committed in the province. Furthermore, they reviewed the troops in order to make sure that they were well equipped, and judged soldiers without appeal. Lastly, they were concerned with taxes and infrastructure such as roads, canals, and mines.

Historically, this position had been originally attributed to Cardinal Richelieu. However, this position was actually in existence long before the time of Richelieu. Its powers were so well developed by the first quarter of the seventeenth century that the cardinal-minister could have found little to add to them.

==The power shift==

Prior to the establishment of the Intendant of New France and the Sovereign Council, the Governor shared legislative, executive and judicial powers with the old Council of Quebec, which was established by the royal statues of 1647 and 1648. The council was supposed to keep the power of governor in check; however in reality, the governor held great influence over the Council through practicing the right of veto. The governor and his successors enjoyed their authority in New France without restraint. At the beginning of 1663, the Company of One Hundred Associates (&quot;Compagnie des Cent-Associés&quot;) was dissolved and New France became a royal possession once more.

The appointment of the intendant by Louis XIV and Jean-Baptiste Colbert was an attempt to correct the weakened state of New France and intervene before it was too late. The intendant was to reorganize New France. The governor&#x27;s powers were greatly reduced and many were transferred to the intendant and the Sovereign Council. The intendant became responsible for all the civil administration.

The Sovereign Council was introduced on September 18, 1663, as means to lessen the Governor&#x27;s power. Indeed, it was not uncommon for governors to overstep their boundaries. Under the Sovereign Council, power shifted, or rather, became more divided, so that &quot;what formerly constituted in great measure to the functions of the Governor, was given to the Council.&quot; The Intendant received power to reestablish order and security and to carry out important responsibilities in governing the colony of New France.

==Intendants in New France==

The office of the intendant first made its appearance in connection with the affairs of New France in the spring of 1663. On the advice of Colbert, the king had decided to provide New France with a new framework of government modelled in general upon that of a French province. In April 1663 an edict constituting the new administration was issued. As part of this administration, the intendant, who was trained in Finance, Law and Accounting, would be primarily in charge of the finances of the colony. The king normally appointed intendants from the royal service. These were men who entered the service at an early age and had been promoted as the result of tested fidelity to the interests of the monarchy and of industry shown in office.

The Intendants of New France were not appointed for a fixed number of years. In practice, the terms varied considerably, but according to Munro, &quot;the average term of tenure was about eight and one-half years.&quot; The position was not something that everyone wanted, because it had enormous responsibilities and a heavy workload. In addition, the pay was low for this time in history: twelve thousand livres per year. However, those that did accept the position saw it as a stepping-stone to something greater. Consequently, they strove to conduct themselves so as to win the favour of the crown.

According to Munro, &quot;each intendant received from the king a commission of appointment setting forth his jurisdiction and powers.&quot; These commissions varied but disclosed a broad line of uniformity. These commissions were expressed in such general terms, Munro argued, &quot;that the intendant was the real agent of administration in the colony.&quot; The duties of the intendant were to oversee justice, finances and policing in the colony. He presided over the Sovereign Council and acted as a judge. He was also responsible for establishing regulations relative to the police, commerce, market prices, currency, militia, and seigniorial rights. Nevertheless, the intendant lacked any power over the military. He was answerable only to the Minister of Marine.

<text>Marquis of Baux () is a subsidiary title of the prince of Monaco. When possible, the title passes from the reigning prince to the first male heir apparent or heir presumptive of the Monegasque throne. 

The present bearer of the title is Hereditary Prince Jacques. The marquisate was associated with the town of Les Baux-de-Provence, but later lost its administrative authority when control of the town reverted to France.

The title of &quot;lord of Baux&quot; had been used by other families previously. King Louis XIII of France re-granted the lordship as a marquisate to Prince Honoré II of Monaco by the Treaty of Péronne on 14 September 1641. The new title was first used by Honoré&#x27;s only son, Ercole. Ercole died before his father, and thus the title has been granted for several centuries to the heirs of the prince of Monaco.
