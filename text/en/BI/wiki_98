<text>University of Wales, Lampeter () was a university in Lampeter, Wales. Founded in 1822, and incorporated by royal charter in 1828, it was the oldest degree awarding institution in Wales, with limited degree awarding powers since 1852. It was a self-governing college of the University of Wales from 1972 until its merger (under its 1828 charter) with Trinity University College in 2010 to form the University of Wales Trinity Saint David.

The university was founded as St David&#x27;s College (&quot;Coleg Dewi Sant&quot;), becoming St David&#x27;s University College (&quot;Coleg Prifysgol Dewi Sant&quot;) in 1971, when it became part of the federal University of Wales. With fewer than 2,000 students on campus, it was often claimed to be one of the smallest public universities in Europe.

== History ==
When Thomas Burgess was appointed Bishop of St David&#x27;s in 1803, he saw a need for a college in which Welsh ordinands could receive a higher education. The existing colleges at Oxford and Cambridge were out of the geographical and financial means of most would-be students.

Burgess had no Welsh connections; he was born in Odiham, Hampshire in 1756. After education at Winchester College and Corpus Christi College, Oxford, he had short stays in Salisbury and Durham before being appointed to his first bishopric in Wales in 1803. Burgess intended to build his new college to train priests in Llanddewi Brefi which, at the time, was similar in size to Lampeter but ten kilometres from it and with an honoured place in the Christian history of Wales. When Burgess was staying with his friend the Bishop of Gloucester in 1820, however, he met John Scandrett Harford, a wealthy landowner from Gloucestershire. Harford donated the Castle Field site in Lampeter, named after the Norman castle once contained in the field. This is the site on which the present University stands.

St David&#x27;s College was thus founded just outside Lampeter; the foundation stone was laid in 1822. Burgess left St. David&#x27;s in 1825 to become Bishop of Salisbury but work on the college continued, largely supervised by Harford. The £16,000 required to erect the college had been raised from public donations, a government grant and highly publicised gifts, including one from King George IV. The main college building was completed in 1827 and the college officially opened on St. David&#x27;s Day of that year, welcoming its first 26 students. As such, it was the oldest institution of higher education in Wales, and the third oldest in England and Wales, receiving its first charter in 1828. In 1852, the college gained the right to award the degree of Bachelor of Divinity (BD) and, in 1865, the degree of Bachelor of Arts (BA), long before the other colleges in Wales gained their own degree awarding powers. As early as 1865, when a campaign had commenced to establish a University for Wales, there were suggestions that the college should take on this function. However, they were opposed by those who believed it should retain its original purpose as a theological college.

Although it continued as a centre of clergy training until 1978, there was always a proportion of students who did not intend to be ordained. The 1896 charter specifically stated that the college could accept anyone, regardless of whether they intended to take Holy Orders. Since 1925, it had been possible to study for a BA at the college without studying any theology at all. However, throughout the college&#x27;s history, non-ordinands had been in a minority. In the 1950s the number of ordinands declined sharply and the college faced possible closure unless it could secure government funding. Principal J.R. Lloyd Thomas did not spare himself in the fight for survival and, in 1960, after much negotiation, University College, Cardiff, agreed to sponsor Saint David&#x27;s. Thus the government finally began to assist SDC financially.

Following the appointment of Rowland Williams as vice principal in 1849, and inspired by the &quot;muscular Christianity&quot; movement, the college passed a rule in 1850 stating that students &quot;should spend their spare time in healthful exercise rather than in clownish lounging about the shops or market place&quot;. This led to the formation of a cricket team, which played its first match (against Lampeter Town) in 1852. Williams is thought to have introduced rugby union at Lampeter in the 1850s, where the first recorded rugby game in Wales was played (against Llandovery College) in 1866.

In 1971, the college became a member of the federal University of Wales and suspended its own degree-awarding powers. It became St David&#x27;s University College (SDUC). By this time, the college had begun shifting its specialisms and, whilst theology continued to be a strong point, students could choose from a much wider range of liberal arts subjects. In 1996, the Privy Council—in response to a petition from the university—agreed to change its title again to the University of Wales, Lampeter in line with moves elsewhere in the university and the recognition of its growth and changing status. In September 2007, the University of Wales become confederal rather than federal in nature, effectively giving Lampeter independent university status. Unlike other former Wales colleges however, the institution&#x27;s name remained unchanged.

The university specialised in Theology, Religious Studies, philosophy, Classics, Anthropology, Archaeology, English and History. Prior to the merger, the university was also growing in disciplines from the liberal arts and social sciences such as Film and Media Studies, Information Society Studies, Business Management, Chinese Studies and Voluntary Sector Studies. However, in the last two decades several other departments which taught subjects in their own right closed, notably French, German and Geography.

The university had research and consultancy departments, including the Centre for Beliefs and Values, Centre for Enterprise, European and Extension Services, Archaeological Services and the Centre for the Study of Religion in Celtic Societies.

In the early 1990s, there also existed an influential Human geography department at the college. This was closed in 2001 but the diaspora of the Lampeter Geography School continue to have an influence on their field.

In 2008, the Quality Assurance Agency concluded that, although the quality of Lampeter&#x27;s degrees was satisfactory, they had &#x27;limited confidence&#x27; in the institution&#x27;s quality assurance procedures and systems. Further to this assessment, the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales commissioned a further report which found &quot;very real problems of leadership and management&quot; at the university. As a direct result, on 14 December 2008, the university announced that it was in merger talks with Trinity College, Carmarthen with the intention of forming a new university in Wales. In July 2010, it was announced that the Queen had approved an order granting a supplemental charter to Lampeter which would create the new University of Wales, Trinity Saint David and which would accept its first students in September 2010 at which time the University of Wales, Lampeter would formally cease to exist.

== University buildings ==
=== The Old College ===

C.R. Cockerell designed the original college, now called the Saint David&#x27;s Building (Old Building or OB by students) in the centre of the Campus. It is a Grade II* listed building and contains lecture rooms, common rooms, administrative offices, student residential accommodation and the following three main areas:

The Old Hall was the refectory until the Lloyd Thomas Building came into use in 1969. It fell into disuse; however after much restoration, it re-opened in 1991 as one of the main public rooms for meetings, dinners, conferences and for use by outside organisations. It was also used for some examinations.

The Old Hall also contains paintings of various principals, presidents, benefactors, vice-chancellors &quot;et al.&quot; including Bishop Burgess, Maurice Jones, Thomas Price, Llewelyn Lewellin, Edward Harold Browne, Keith Robbins and Brian Robert Morris.

St David&#x27;s Chapel was consecrated in 1827. In 1879, it was rebuilt according to the specifications of the architect Thomas Graham Jackson of Cambridge. It re-opened on 24 June 1880. It was then refurbished again during the 1930s, mainly through the provision of a new reredos in 1933 and a major overhaul of the organ in 1934. The chapel was provided with a dedicated chaplain and services were held on Sundays and throughout the week as well as on saints&#x27; days and major festivals.

The Founders&#x27; Library housed the main library until the new library opened in 1966. After this time the library housed the university&#x27;s oldest printed books (1470–1850) and manuscripts (the earliest from the thirteenth century), given to Lampeter from 1822 onwards, as well as the archives of the university. It is a priceless collection unique to Lampeter. Named after its foundersThomas Burgess (1756–1837), Thomas Bowdler (1754–1825), and Thomas Phillips (1760–1851)it served as a resource for research and teaching, particularly in English, History and Mediaeval Studies. In 2005, it was announced that a new £700,000 library building was to be built on campus to house the university&#x27;s special collections, as the Founders&#x27; Library was not environmentally suitable for such valuable documents. This extension to the main library was completed in 2008.

=== Later additions ===
The Canterbury Building was built to house a growing number of students at the end of the 19th century. The foundation stone was laid by the Archbishop of Canterbury in 1885 and the building was officially opened on 24 June 1887. It contained a physical science laboratory, two lecture rooms and new accommodation. However, structural problems forced the university to demolish the original building in the summer of 1971. The second Canterbury Building was opened on 20 October 1973 by the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Kent. It was demolished, and replaced with the present Canterbury Building, during the 2012–13 academic year.

The Main Library was opened on 7 July 1966 by the then Chancellor of the University of Wales, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. It was extended and then reopened by Charles, Prince of Wales on 21 June 1984.

The Arts Building was opened by Peter Thomas, Secretary of State for Wales on 4 October 1971, in time for it to house the new Geography department. The Archaeology and Anthropology department has since moved into the ground floor of the building, the first floor being shared by the Department of Film and Media and the Department of Management and I.T. The building now houses the new combined A.H.A (Archaeology, History and Anthropology) department.

The Cliff Tucker Theatre, on the banks of the River Dulas, was opened by Sir Anthony Hopkins in 1996 and contained teaching rooms, lecture theatres and a large computer room. It was named in honour of Cliff Tucker, a former student and benefactor of the university.

The Sheikh Khalifa Building, completed in 1997 and named after Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, a benefactor of the university, was the home of the Department of Theology, Religious Studies and Islamic Studies, one of the largest departments of its kind in the United Kingdom. It was opened by Professor Sir Stewart Sutherland. Behind the departmental building is a small mosque, used by Muslim students and residents of the town.

The Roderic Bowen Research Centre, completed 2007 and named after Roderic Bowen, a former president of the university, houses the Founders&#x27; Library collection and archives and adjoins the main library building. The centre was opened on 17 October 2008, by First Minister for Wales, Rhodri Morgan.

The Confucius Institute opened in 2007, as the home of the university&#x27;s department of Chinese Studies and had direct links to Chinese Cultural institutes.

Archaeology Laboratories provided facilities for environmental archaeology, osteoarchaeology, soil studies and conservation.

The Lloyd Thomas Refectory was the university&#x27;s main dining hall, providing meals to guests and catered students and a regular Sunday carvery.

The Media centre contained studios and recording facilities.

Bishop Burgess Hall formerly housed the departments of Classics and Philosophy. In 2009 it was converted to become a hub for student services.

== Academic dress ==

From 1971, Lampeter awarded University of Wales degrees, and as such, the academic dress was that of the University of Wales – graduates wore a black stuff gown, with bell sleeves for bachelors, and glove sleeve for masters. Hoods were lined with mazarin blue shot green (arts), mazarin blue shot red (divinity), lined yellow shot black (MSc) and yellow shot red, bound light blue (MBA).

The Lampeter academic dress for the degrees it awarded in its own right differed from this as follows:

Undergraduates wore a black stuff gown, with bell-sleeves, with the whole sleeve split open in front. The year-round wearing of undergraduate academic dress ended in 1971 when Lampeter joined the University of Wales. However around 2006–10 there was some support for a resurrection of this tradition by current students.

Bachelor of Divinity. A black gown, of MA pattern (long closed sleeves), with a double crescent cut at the end of each sleeve. A black silk hood, lined with dark violet silk, and bound with 1&quot; white silk. Originally, it could be made in either the Oxford or the Cambridge shape, but Cambridge became the norm.

Bachelor of Arts. A black stuff gown of Cambridge BA pattern. A black silk hood, part-lined and bound with &#x27;miniver&#x27; – white fur with black spots. (Rabbit was usually used, with &#x27;stick-on&#x27; spots, on account of the cost of real miniver!). As with the BD, it could be made in either the Oxford or the Cambridge shape, but Cambridge became the norm.

There was also a two-year course for those who could not afford the full three-year one. From 1884, this was called the Licence in Divinity (LD). Holders wore the undergraduate gown, with a black stuff hood, lined with black stuff, and bound for 1&quot; with white silk. This was always Cambridge shape. The LD was not awarded after about 1940 and, in 1969, the hood was used for the DipTh, which was awarded until the college ceased clergy training in 1978. A degree with a similar title was introduced in 2007, the Licence in Divinity (Doctoral) (LicDD). This however, is a postdoctoral degree in theology or religious studies, the first of its kind in the UK. The academicals prescribed to this degree is non-conventional in that it consists of a scarlet mozzetta trimmed with white fur that is worn over the festal gown and under the hood (of the relevant Wales degree) and worn with a scarlet bonnet with white cord and tassels. The degree was only awarded for a brief time before it was dropped (2007–2011).

The university awarded a number of Licences in Theology (LTh), Religious Studies (LRS), Islamic Studies, Latin, and Classical Greek.

== Sports ==
The university has a sports hall with badminton and squash courts, and a multigym with weight training equipment. For outdoor sports, the university has tennis courts, a cricket field and facilities for football, hockey and rugby. The college cricket pavilion, opened officially on 1 May 1909 is now a listed building.

Lampeter has active fencing, netball, field hockey, football and rugby union teams, all of which played in the college colours of black and gold.

=== Rugby ===
Rugby was introduced to Lampeter by Vice-Principal Rowland Williams around 1850 and, as such, the college can claim to have the oldest Rugby football team in Wales. Despite some debate as to whether this honour belongs to the town team or the university side, the Welsh Rugby Union&#x27;s official history &quot;Fields of Praise: The Official History of the Welsh Rugby Union, 1881–1981&quot; indicates the college team as the first. However, Lampeter Town RFC were the representatives of Lampeter at the formation of the WRU in 1881.

The red strip worn by Wales is one of the university&#x27;s original strips and, as such, the college team is the only other club permitted to wear it. The club was one of the founder members of the Welsh Rugby Union in 1881 but, following trouble at a match against the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth in 1933, was reprimanded by the union.

The club&#x27;s nicknames were &quot;Mad Pilgrims&quot; and &quot;Fighting Parsons&quot;, reflecting Lampeter&#x27;s history of training clergy. A match was played between the student team and an old boys (graduate) team on the first Saturday in December each year. In recent years, the old boys formed a touring side known as Old Parsonians RFC. The old boys have become known for their battle cry &quot;chuff&quot;, which came into common use c. 2001. Old Parsonians play in a sky blue and white kit in recognition of the historical rugby link to Cambridge rugby through Rowland Williams.

== The College Yell ==
Taken from the Student Handbook 1938–39, the College Yell was originally used at sporting and other competitive events. It had largely fallen into obscurity by the twenty-first century, though occasionally resurrected by zealous students.

== Student life ==
Three full-time sabbatical officers and ten non-sabbatical officers oversaw student entertainment, welfare and childcare, as well as ensuring that the views of Lampeter students were represented on a national level, through affiliation with the National Union of Students. However, by 2015, this had been cut to one sabbatical officer and 16 non-sabbatical officers. The Students&#x27; Union also published a popular satirical magazine entitled 1822 which &quot;blends satire, pointlessness and toilet humour&quot;.

The secluded rural location lends the campus a special atmosphere and a very high proportion of the students were involved in clubs, societies and associations. There were over 30 recognised bodies, ranging from the Chinese Society and the International Students&#x27; Association to Medieval Re-enactment, Fencing Club and Organic Gardening Society. Alongside these were student-run bodies not affiliated with the Students&#x27; Union, such as the Christian Union, Conservative Future and Amnesty.

There has been no train service to the town since the local line fell victim to the Beeching Axe in 1965 and only limited bus services remain. However for many who came there, this was a key attraction, with a high proportion of students getting involved with outdoor activities and local environmental projects. Local country towns of Carmarthen and Llandeilo are nearby as well as the coastal resorts of Aberystwyth and New Quay. The union building, on the banks of the &quot;Afon Dulas&quot; and extended in 1998, contains a student bar and small club, known as the Xtension, which hosts parties and live music events; the Union also has a CineClub showing films in the Arts Hall and Cliff Tucker Theatre.

== Lampeter Geography School ==
The Lampeter Geography School was an important collection of academics based at the Geography department of the University of Wales, Lampeter. The department has since closed, but the Lampeter diaspora continues to have a major impact on the academic discipline.

=== Establishment ===
The Robbins Report of 1963 recommended immediate expansion of British universities. In its implementation of these recommendations, Lampeter planned to open new Economics and Geography departments. Economics was taught at first year level only. The groundwork was well in place for the Geography department to open by 1970 or 1971. The new Arts Building of the university was opened by the Secretary of State for Wales on 4 October 1971, which provided the new department with luxurious lecture and teaching rooms in time for its opening. Dr David Thomas (not to be confused with David SG Thomas, Professor at Oxford) became the first Professor of Geography at Lampeter in 1970 and, in 1971, Donald A Davidson and John A Dawson joined the staff as lecturers, ready to welcome the first Geography students to Lampeter in October 1971.

<doc id="355786" wikidata="Q3150152" url="?curid=355786" title="Call signs in North America">
<text>Call signs are frequently still used by North American broadcast stations, in addition to amateur radio and other international radio stations that continue to identify by call signs worldwide. Each country has a different set of patterns for its own call signs. Call signs are allocated to ham radio stations in Barbados, Canada, Mexico and the United States.

Many countries have specific conventions for classifying call signs by transmitter characteristics and location. The call sign format for radio and television call signs follows a number of conventions. All call signs begin with a prefix assigned by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). For example, the United States has been assigned the following prefixes: AAA–ALZ, K, N, W. For a complete list, see international call sign allocations.

==Bermuda, Bahamas, and the Caribbean==
Pertaining to their status as former or current colonies, all of the British West Indies islands shared the VS, ZB–ZJ, and ZN–ZO prefixes. The current, largely post-independence, allocation list is as follows:
* Anguilla (in amateur radio VP2E prefix)
* Antigua and Barbuda (uses V2 prefix)
* Bahamas (has the C6 prefix)
* Barbados (uses 8P)
* Bermuda (also uses VS, in amateur radio normally VP9)
* British Virgin Islands (for amateur radio uses VP2V)
* Cayman Islands (ZF for amateur operation, ZF1 for Grand Cayman, ZF8 for Little Cayman and ZF9 for Cayman Brac islands. Visiting reciprocal for all islands is ZF2) 
* Dominica (Commonwealth of Dominica, uses J7)
* Grenada (uses J3)
* Jamaica (uses 6Y)
* Montserrat (for amateur operation VP2M prefix)
* St. Kitts and Nevis (uses V4)
* St. Lucia (uses J6)
* St. Vincent and the Grenadines (uses J8)
* Turks and Caicos Islands (typically uses VP5)

===Cuba===
Cuba uses the prefixes CL–CM, CO, and T4, with district numbers from 0 to 9 for amateur operations.

===Dominican Republic===
The Dominican Republic uses the prefixes HI–HJ.

===French West Indies===
All of the French possessions share the prefix F. Further divisions that are used by amateur stations are:
* Guadeloupe – uses FG
* Martinique – uses FM
* Saint Martin – uses FS
* Saint-Barthélemy – uses FJ

===Haiti===
Haiti has been assigned the call sign prefixes HH and 4V.

===Netherlands Antilles===
The Kingdom of the Netherlands use the PA–PI prefixes, while the Netherlands Antilles use the PJ prefix. Aruba has been assigned P4 by the ITU.

===Trinidad and Tobago===
The island nation of Trinidad and Tobago use the 9Y–9Z prefixes.

==Canada==

Canadian broadcast stations are assigned a three-, four-, or five-letter base call sign (not including the &quot;-FM&quot;, &quot;-TV&quot; or &quot;-DT&quot; suffix) beginning with CB, CF, CH, CI, CJ, CK, VF, or VO. The &quot;CB&quot; series calls are assigned to Chile by the ITU, but Canada makes de facto use of this series anyway for stations belonging to, but not exclusively broadcasting programs from, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC).

Several other prefixes, including CG, CY-CZ, VA-VE, VG, and the XJ-XO range, are available, but are not used in broadcasting. Conventional radio and television stations almost exclusively use &quot;C&quot; call signs; with the exception of a few commercial radio stations in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador which existed prior to the admission of Newfoundland as a province in 1949, the &quot;V&quot; calls are restricted to specialized uses such as amateur radio.

==Mexico==
Mexican broadcast stations are assigned call signs beginning with &quot;XE&quot; (for mediumwave and shortwave stations) or &quot;XH&quot; (for FM radio and television stations), followed by one and up to five letters and a suffix according to the band in which they broadcast, these suffixes are: &quot;-AM&quot;, &quot;-OC&quot; (shortwave or &quot;Onda Corta&quot;), &quot;-FM&quot; and &quot;-TDT&quot; (Terrestrial Digital Television). The &quot;-OL&quot; (longwave or &quot;Onda Larga&quot;) and &quot;-TV&quot; suffixes are currently phased out as those bands are no longer used. Some FM and television stations have call signs beginning with &quot;XE&quot;, usually reserved for AM radio stations. Most of these &quot;XE&quot; cases in FM and television stations were solicited by the concessionaires themselves so the stations would have the same call sign as an existing AM station (as it is the case of XEW-AM, XEW-TV and XEW-FM, all founded and owned by the Azcárraga family), while others are for disambiguation (like XHTV-TV and XETV-TV or XEIMT-TV and XHIMT-TV). All TV stations originally assigned with the &quot;-TV&quot; suffix, had been given the &quot;-TDT&quot; suffix as they made the digital switchover.

Television stations are required to identify every 30 minutes; there has been no equivalent requirement in radio since 2014. Television rebroadcasters are assigned the call signs of the station they are licensed to retransmit; for instance, XEZ-TDT, located on Cerro El Zamorano in Querétaro, has a repeater on Cerro Culiacán serving Celaya, Guanajuato, which is also XEZ-TV. Digital subchannels are not assigned a distinctive call sign; they keep the call sign of the station. The technical guidelines for digital television stations stipulate the use of PSIP short names matching the parent station (e.g. XHTDMX2, XHTDMX3).

Amateur radio stations in Mexico use &quot;XE1&quot; for the central region, &quot;XE2&quot; for the northern region, and &quot;XE3&quot; for the southern region. &quot;XF&quot; prefixes indicate islands. &quot;XF4&quot; is usually used for the Revillagigedo Islands and nearby islets. Special call signs for contests or celebrations are occasionally issued, often in the 4A and 6D series, although these will follow the usual district numbering system (4A3 for the south, etc.).

==United States==

The earliest identification, used in the 1910s and into the early 1920s, was arbitrary. The U.S. government began requiring stations to use three-letter call signs around 1912, but they could be chosen at random. This system was replaced by the basic form of the current system in the early 1920s. Examples of pre-1920 stations include 8XK in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which became KDKA in November 1920, and Charles Herrold&#x27;s series of identifiers from 1909 in San Jose, California: first &quot;This is the Herrold Station&quot; or &quot;San Jose calling&quot;, then the call signs FN, SJN, 6XF, and 6XE, then, with the advent of modern call signs, KQW in December 1921, and eventually KCBS from 1949 onward.

All broadcast call signs in the United States begin with either K or W, with &quot;K&quot; usually west of the Mississippi River and &quot;W&quot; usually east of it. Initial letters AA through AL, as well as N, are internationally allocated to the United States but are not used for broadcast stations.

In the United States, broadcast stations have call signs of three to seven characters in length, including suffixes for certain types of service, but the minimum length for new stations is four characters, and seven-character call signs result only from rare combinations of suffixes.

* Facility ID, used by the FCC in the United States to distinguish broadcast stations without regard to call sign changes

==References==
The rules governing call signs for stations in the United States are set out in the FCC rules, 47 C.F.R. chapter I. Specific rules for each particular service are set out in the part of the rules dealing with that service. A general overview of call sign formats is found at . Rules for broadcast stations&#x27; call sign are principally defined in .

<text>Police units in the United States tend to use a tactical designator (or tactical callsign) consisting of a letter of the police radio alphabet followed by one or two numbers. For example, &quot;Mary One&quot; might identify the head of a city&#x27;s homicide division. Police and fire department radio systems are assigned official callsigns, however. Examples are KQY672 and KYX556. The official headquarters callsigns are usually announced at least hourly, and more frequently by Morse code.

The United States Army uses tactical designators that change daily. They normally consist of letter-number-letter prefixes identifying a unit, followed by a number-number suffix identifying the role of the person using the callsign.

<doc id="355796" wikidata="Q1429291" url="?curid=355796" title="Flora of New Zealand">
<text>This article relates to the flora of New Zealand, especially indigenous strains. New Zealand&#x27;s geographical isolation has meant the country has developed a unique variety of native flora. However, human migration has led to the importation of many other plants (generally referred to as &#x27;exotics&#x27; in New Zealand) as well as widespread damage to the indigenous flora, especially after the advent of European colonisation, due to the combined efforts of farmers and specialised societies dedicated to importing European plants &amp; animals.

== Characteristics ==
Indigenous New Zealand flora generally has the following characteristics:
* the majority are evergreen.
* few annual herbs.
* few cold-tolerant trees.
* majority are dispersed by birds.
* very few have defences against mammalian browsers.
* few nitrogen fixing plants.
* few fire-adapted species.
* many dioecious species.
* flowers are typically small and white.
* many plants have divaricating growth forms.
* many plants have evolved into larger forms compared with similar plant families in other countries.

===Ferns===

While most of the world&#x27;s ferns grow in tropical climates, New Zealand hosts an unusual number of ferns for a temperate country. These exhibit a variety of forms, from stereotypical feather-shaped tufted ferns and tree ferns to less typical filmy, leafy and climbing ferns. Both the koru, in the shape of an unfurling fern frond, and the silver fern are widely accepted symbols of New Zealand.

New Zealand has ten species of tree ferns, but there are numerous ground, climbing and perching smaller ferns to be found throughout the countries forests, the largest of which is the king fern.

* Silver fern or ponga, &quot;Cyathea dealbata&quot;
* New Zealand tree fern, &quot;Dicksonia squarrosa&quot;
* Black tree fern or mamaku, &quot;Cyathea medullaris&quot;
* Tuokura, &quot;Dicksonia lanata&quot;
* Kuripaka, &quot;Dicksonia fibrosa&quot;
* Mountain tree fern, &quot;Cyathea colensoi&quot;
* Gully tree fern, &quot;Cyathea cunninghamii&quot;
* Soft tree fern, &quot;Cyathea smithii&quot;
* King fern, &quot;Ptisana salicina&quot;

* Mangemange, &quot;Lygodium articulatum&quot;

===Seaweeds===
New Zealand is impacted by a diversity of sea water systems including the ocean fronts the Tasman Front, the Subantartic Front, and the Subtropical Front. These each have different properties have a significant influence on the seaweed flora of the long coastlines of New Zealand. There are around 900 species of seaweed that occur in the New Zealand region but it&#x27;s likely that there are species that have yet to be formally described or discovered. A commonly found seaweed is Neptune&#x27;s necklace.

===Liverworts===
New Zealand has a greater density of liverworts than any other country, due to its cool, wet and temperate climate. About half the species are endemic to New Zealand.

There are 606 species known in New Zealand. While these include some thallose liverworts, with liver-shaped thalli, most are leafy liverworts which can be confused with mosses and filmy ferns. Undescribed species, and those not previously recorded in New Zealand, continue to be found in lowland forests. Ninety species and varieties are listed on the 2001 Department of Conservation threatened plants list, and 157 liverwort species and varieties will be included on the next version of the list as a result of better knowledge of the group.

A three-volume work on liverworts in New Zealand is being written by John Engel and David Glenny, with the first volume published in 2008. The first volume will also be placed online in June 2009 as part of Floraseries.

===Grasses===
There are 187 species of native grasses in New Zealand: 157 endemic and 30 indigenous species.

The grasses belong to the following tribes and genera:

In chickens, it is formed from the layers of secretions of the anterior section of the hen&#x27;s oviduct during the passage of the egg. It forms around fertilized or unfertilized egg yolks. The primary natural purpose of egg white is to protect the yolk and provide additional nutrition for the growth of the embryo (when fertilized).
Egg white consists primarily of about 90% water into which about 10% proteins (including albumins, mucoproteins, and globulins) are dissolved. Unlike the yolk, which is high in lipids (fats), egg white contains almost no fat, and carbohydrate content is less than 1%. Egg whites contain about 56% of the protein in the egg. Egg white has many uses in food (e.g. meringue, mousse) as well as many other uses (e.g. in the preparation of vaccines such as those for influenza).

==Composition==
Egg white makes up around two-thirds of a chicken egg by weight. Water constitutes about 90% of this, with protein, trace minerals, fatty material, vitamins, and glucose contributing the remainder. A raw U.S. large egg contains around 33 grams of egg white with 3.6 grams of protein, 0.24 grams of carbohydrate and 55 milligrams of sodium. It contains no cholesterol and the energy content is about 17 calories. Egg white is an alkaline solution and contains around 149 proteins. The table below lists the major proteins in egg whites by percentage and their natural functions.
Ovalbumin is the most abundant protein in albumen. Classed as phosphoglycoprotein, during storage, it converts into s-ovalbumin (5% at the time of laying) and can reach up to 80% after six months of cold storage. Ovalbumin in solution is heat-resistant. Denaturation temperature is around 84 °C, but it can be easily denatured by physical stresses. Conalbumin/ovotransferrin is a glycoprotein which has the capacity to bind the bi- and trivalent metal cations into a complex and is more heat sensitive than ovalbumin. At its isoelectric pH (6.5), it can bind two cations and assume a red or yellow color. These metal complexes are more heat stable than the native state. Ovomucoid is the major allergen from egg white and is a heat-resistant glycoprotein found to be a trypsin inhibitor. Lysozyme is a holoprotein which can lyse the wall of certain Gram-positive bacteria and is found at high levels in the chalaziferous layer and the chalazae which anchor the yolk towards the middle of the egg. Ovomucin is a glycoprotein which may contribute to the gel-like structure of thick albumen. The amount of ovomucin in the thick albumen is four times as great as in the thin albumen.

==Foam==


The physical stress of beating egg whites can create a foam. Two types of physical stress are caused by beating them with a whisk: denaturation and coagulation.

Denaturation occurs as the whisk drags the liquid through itself, creating a force that unfolds the protein molecules.

Coagulation comes from the mixing of air into the whites, which causes the proteins to come out of their natural state. These denatured proteins gather together where the air and water meet and create multiple bonds with the other unraveled proteins, and thus become a foam, holding the incorporated air in place; because the proteins consist of amino acids, some are hydrophilic (attracted to water) and some are hydrophobic (repelled by water).

When beating egg whites, they are classified in three stages according to the peaks they form when the beater is lifted: soft, firm, and stiff peaks. Overbeaten eggs take on a dry appearance, and eventually collapse. Egg whites do not beat up correctly if they are exposed to any form of fat, such as cooking oils or the fats contained in egg yolk.

Copper bowls have been used in France since the 18th century to stabilize egg foams. The copper in the bowl assists in creating a tighter bond in reactive sulfur items such as egg whites. The bond created is so tight that the sulfurs are prevented from reacting with any other material. A silver-plated bowl has the same result as the copper bowl, as will a pinch of powdered copper supplement from a health store used in a glass bowl. Drawbacks of the copper bowl include the expense of the bowl itself, and that the bowls are difficult to keep clean. Copper contamination from the bowl is minimal, as a cup of foam contains a tenth of a human&#x27;s normal daily intake level.
==Health issues==
Although egg whites are prized as a source of low-fat, high-protein nutrition, a small number of people cannot eat them. Egg allergy is more common among infants than adults, and most children will outgrow it by the age of five. Allergic reactions against egg white are more common than reactions against egg yolks. In addition to true allergic reactions, some people experience a food intolerance to egg whites.

Eggs are susceptible to &quot;Salmonella&quot; contamination. Thorough cooking eliminates the direct threat (i.e. cooked egg whites that are solid and not runny), but the threat of cross-contamination remains if people handle contaminated eggs and then touch other foods or items in the kitchen, thus spreading the bacteria. In August 2010, the FDA ordered the recall of 380 million eggs because of possible &quot;Salmonella&quot; contamination.

Cooked eggs are a good source of biotin. However, daily consumption of raw egg whites for several months may result in biotin deficiency, due to their avidin content, as the avidin tightly binds biotin and prevents its absorption.

==Uses==
Egg white is a fining agent that can be used in the clarification and stabilization of wine. Egg white can also be added to shaken cocktails to create a delicate froth. Some protein powders also use egg whites as a primary source of protein.

The albumen from egg white was used as a binding agent in early photography during an 1855-90 period; such prints were called albumen prints.

In the 1750s, egg whites were believed to prevent swelling, and were used for that purpose. To help soothe areas of skin that were afflicted, egg white mixed with Armenian bole could help restore the fibers. Egg whites are also used in bookbinding during the gilding process, where it is referred to as &#x27;glaire&#x27;, and to give a book cover shine.

<text>Second Skin () is a 1999 Spanish romantic drama film directed by Gerardo Vera, starring Javier Bardem, Jordi Mollà, Ariadna Gil and Cecilia Roth.

==Premise==
Elena and Alberto, a couple from Madrid, have a happy marriage, professional success and a loving son. However, Elena later finds a hotel receipt in Alberto&#x27;s pocket and discovers that he has been unfaithful to her. To her surprise, the one who has been involved is another man, Diego.

==Cast==
== Production ==
&quot;Second Skin&quot; is a Antena 3 Televisión, Lolafilms and production. Filming began in March 1999 in Madrid. Shooting locations also included Benicàssim. The screenplay was penned by Gerardo Vera alongside Ángeles González-Sinde. Other production duties were tasked to Julio Madurga (cinematography) and Roque Baños (score).

== Reception ==
Reviewing for &quot;Miami New Times&quot;, David Ehrenstein compared the film to &quot;Making Love&quot; (1982), considering that the film &quot;is less sexually skittish than its predecessor, and a lot less reassuring about the marital dissolution in the wake of homosexual self-discovery&quot;.
The review in &quot;Fotogramas&quot; scored the film with 3 out of 5 stars, considering the performances by Bardem and Gil to be the best about the film, while citing the &quot;over-emphatic&quot; musical score as a negative point.

<doc id="355810" wikidata="Q4828743" url="?curid=355810" title="Aviator call sign">
<text>An aviator call sign or aviator callsign is a call sign given to a military pilot, flight officer, and even some enlisted aviators. The call sign is a specialized form of nickname that is used as a substitute for the aviator&#x27;s given name. It is used on flight suit and flight jacket name tags, painted/displayed beneath the officer&#x27;s or enlisted aircrewman&#x27;s name on aircraft fuselages or canopy rails, and in radio conversations. They are most commonly used in tactical jet aircraft communities (i.e., fighter, bomber, attack) than in other aircraft communities (i.e., airlift, mobility, maritime patrol), but their use is not totally exclusive to the former. Many NASA Astronauts with military aviator backgrounds are referred to during spaceflights by their call signs rather than their first names.

The origins of aviator call signs are varied. Most call signs play on or reference on variants of the aviator&#x27;s firstname or surname. Other inspirations for call signs may include personality traits, middle name, references to historical figures, or past exploits during the pilot&#x27;s career. Aviator call signs nearly always must come from a member or members of the aviator&#x27;s squadron, training class, or other cohort.

It is considered bad form to try to give oneself a call sign and it is also common for aviators to be given a fairly derogatory call sign, and the more they complain about it, the more likely it is to stick.

Some aviators use the same call sign throughout their careers; in other cases an aviator might have a series of call signs. For example, U.S. Navy Lieutenant Kara Hultgreen was originally given the call sign &quot;Hulk&quot; because of her ability to bench-press 200 pounds. Later, after a television appearance in which she wore noticeable makeup, she received the call sign &quot;Revlon&quot;, and a 1998 biography was entitled &quot;Call Sign Revlon&quot;.

==In fiction==
===Film===
* The 1986 film &quot;Top Gun&quot;, set at the United States Navy Fighter Weapons School, featured several aviators with call signs, including Pete Mitchell (Tom Cruise): &quot;Maverick&quot;; Tom Kasansky (Val Kilmer): &quot;Iceman&quot;; and Nick Bradshaw (Anthony Edwards): &quot;Goose&quot;. In addition, a number of military or former military personnel acted as crew to the film: Rick Moe (F-14 air crew): &quot;Curly&quot;; Ray Seckinger (Top Gun instructor and MiG pilot): &quot;Secks&quot;; Thomas Sobieck (Top Gun instructor and MiG pilot): &quot;Sobs&quot;; Robert Willard (Navy aerial coordinator, Top Gun instructor and MiG pilot): &quot;Rat&quot;; C.J. Heatley (aerial camera operator): &quot;Heater&quot;; and Ricky Hammonds (Top Gun instructor and MiG pilot): &quot;Organ&quot;.
* In the 1991 film &quot;Flight of the Intruder&quot;, new A-6 Intruder pilot LTJG Jack Barlow is given the call sign &quot;Razor&quot; because he didn&#x27;t look old enough to shave. It is later changed to &quot;Straight Razor&quot; at the end of the film because he&#x27;d become &quot;a real weapon&quot; in the eyes of his commanding officer. The book&#x27;s principal character Jake Grafton has the call sign &quot;Cool Hand&quot;.
* The 2019 film &quot;Captain Marvel&quot;, set in 1995, has former ex-U.S. Air Force test pilot and member of an elite Kree military unit, Carol Danvers having &quot;Avenger&quot; as her call sign. This name is later used by Nick Fury to rename the initiative that he had earlier drafted, to locate heroes like Danvers. He renames the initiative &quot;The Avengers&quot; after her Air Force call sign.

===Television===
* Dwight Schultz&#x27;s Captain H.M. &quot;Howling Mad&quot; Murdock, from the 1983 television series &quot;The A-Team&quot; (as well as his counterpart in the 2010 film adaptation, as portrayed by Sharlto Copley) is a gifted, albeit insane, can-fly-anything pilot. Aptly named, Murdock displays symptoms of mental instability, as demonstrated by his weekly obsessions (ranging from inanimate objects to role playing). Whether or not he is in fact insane is often debated, due to demonstrations in his fine tuned skills of acting and mimicry.
* In the 1993 animated television series &quot;SWAT Kats: The Radical Squadron&quot;, the main characters Chance Furlong and Jake Clawson have the call signs &quot;T-Bone,&quot; and &quot;Razor,&quot; respectively. Although their call signs are technically their SwatKAT aliases, they frequently refer to each other by their call sign even when not flying.
* In the 1995 TV series &quot;JAG&quot;, the lead character, Harmon Rabb, is given the name &quot;Pappy&quot; due to the fact that he is the oldest pilot in his squadron. This is later changed to &#x27;Hammer&#x27; which was his father&#x27;s Vietnam War call sign—a mark of respect.
* In the 2004 television series &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;, a number of the &quot;Galactica&quot;&#x27;s crew had call signs. William Adama (portrayed by Edward James Olmos) had &quot;Husker&quot;.Lee Adama (Jamie Bamber) had &quot;Apollo&quot;. Kara Thrace (Katee Sackhoff) had &quot;Starbuck&quot; and Karl Agathon (Tahmoh Penikett) had &quot;Helo.&quot; Sharon Valerii (Grace Park) had two personas and a call sign for each: &quot;Boomer&quot; for Sharon Valerii and &quot;Athena&quot; for Sharon Agathon. In the original 1978 series on which the 2004 series was based, many of these were the characters&#x27; actual names, rather than call signs.
* Payload Specialist Howard Wolowitz from 2007 television series &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; has the unwanted astronaut call sign &quot;Froot Loops&quot; given to him by astronaut Mike Massimino.
* The episode &quot;Newbie Dash&quot; of the 2010 animated TV series &quot;My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic&quot; revolves around Rainbow Dash trying to shake off an embarrassing nickname (&quot;Crash&quot;) given to her upon joining the aerobatic team The Wonderbolts. She ultimately learns that all of her teammates have equally embarrassing nicknames, and embraces it as her callsign for the remainder of the series.

===Print===
* The Hal Jordan version of the DC Comics character Green Lantern, introduced in 1959, was a US Air Force pilot and test pilot with the call sign &quot;Highball&quot;.
* The Marvel Comics character Corsair, space-faring father to X-Men characters Scott Summers and Alex Summers, got his alias from his call sign from his time as a US Air Force pilot.
* In Tom Clancy&#x27;s 1993 novel &quot;Without Remorse,&quot; fictional Vice Admiral Winslow Holland Maxwell, during World War II, received the call sign &quot;Winnie,&quot; which he hated; after a mission in which he shot down three Japanese planes (all confirmed by gunsight cameras), he found a new coffee mug in the wardroom, engraved with the call sign &quot;Dutch.&quot; When he later became an admiral, he displayed the mug—no longer used for coffee or pencils—in a place of honor on his desk.
* A trilogy of novels published 2001-2004 by Ward &quot;Mooch&quot; Carroll, &quot;Punk&#x27;s War&quot;, &quot;Punk&#x27;s Wing&quot;, and &quot;Punk&#x27;s Fight&quot;, featured Rick Reichert, an F-14 pilot with the call sign &quot;Punk&quot; named by his skipper (Commanding Officer) because he was caught listening to punk rock music while he was in the paraloft “walking” (suiting up) for a flight.

==In real life==
* Astronaut Duane Carey used the callsign &quot;Spider&quot; as an A-10 pilot; When he transferred to F-16s, his call sign was changed to &quot;Digger&quot;, because another pilot with that callsign had recently left the group, and the group wanted to continue its use.
*US Navy fighter pilot Dale Snodgrass used the callsign of &quot;Snort&quot; and flew the F-14 Tomcat. He is known for a photo of him in his F-14 doing a knife edge pass off the side of the USS America. After his retirement from the Navy he flew many types of warbirds at airshows across the world, up until his death in mid-2021.

<text>Béatrice et Bénédict (&quot;Beatrice and Benedick&quot;) is an &quot;opéra comique&quot; in two acts by French composer Hector Berlioz. Berlioz wrote the French libretto himself, based in general outline on a subplot in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;.

Berlioz had been interested in setting Shakespeare&#x27;s comedy since his return from Italy in 1833, but only composed the score of &quot;Béatrice et Bénédict&quot; following the completion of &quot;Les Troyens&quot; in 1858. It was first performed at the opening of the Theater Baden-Baden on 9 August 1862. Berlioz conducted the first two performances of a German version in Weimar in 1863, where, as he wrote in his memoirs, he was &quot;overwhelmed by all sorts of kind attention.&quot;

It is the first notable version of Shakespeare&#x27;s play in operatic form, and was followed by works by, among others, Árpád Doppler, Paul Puget, Charles Villiers Stanford, and Reynaldo Hahn.

Berlioz biographer David Cairns has written: &quot;Listening to the score&#x27;s exuberant gaiety, only momentarily touched by sadness, one would never guess that its composer was in pain when he wrote it and impatient for death&quot;.

==Performance history==
Berlioz described the premiere of &quot;Béatrice et Bénédict&quot; as a &quot;great success&quot; in a letter to his son Louis; he was particularly taken with the performance of Charton-Demeur (who would create the role of Didon in &quot;Les Troyens&quot; in Paris a year later) and noted that the duo which closes the first half elicited an &quot;astonishing impact&quot;.

Although it continued to be staged occasionally in German cities in the years after the premiere, the first performance in France only took place on 5 June 1890 at the Théâtre de l&#x27;Odéon, 21 years after its composer’s death, promoted by Élisabeth Greffulhe&#x27;s Société des Grandes auditions musicales de France, conducted by Charles Lamoureux, and with Juliette Bilbaut-Vauchelet and Émile Engel in the lead roles.

Paul Bastide conducted a notable production of &quot;Béatrice et Bénédict&quot; in Strasbourg in the late 1940s. It was produced at the Paris Opéra-Comique in 1966 conducted by Pierre Dervaux but with recitatives by Tony Aubin, and in February 2010 under Emmanuel Krivine.

The UK premiere was on 24 March 1936 in Glasgow under Erik Chisholm. The English National Opera opened a production on 25 January 1990, with wife and husband Ann Murray and Philip Langridge in the title roles. The work was first performed in New York in 1977 as a concert performance at Carnegie Hall, Seiji Ozawa conducting the Boston Symphony Orchestra.

Although rather infrequently performed and not part of the standard operatic repertoire, recent productions have included Amsterdam and Welsh National Opera tour in 2001, Prague State Opera (Státní opera Praha) in 2003, Santa Fe Opera in 1998 and 2004, Opéra du Rhin in Strasbourg in 2005, Chicago Opera Theater in 2007, Houston Grand Opera in 2008 (in English), Opera Boston in 2011, Theater an der Wien in 2013, and Glyndebourne in 2016. The first Swedish production of the opera was at Läckö Castle in 2015, and the first in staging in Italy in late 2022 at the Teatro Carlo Felice in Genoa.

==Music==
The overture (sometimes played and recorded separately) alludes to several parts of the score without becoming a pot-pourri. The opera opens with a rejoicing chorus and Sicilienne. Héro has a two-part air where she looks expectantly to the return of her love, Claudio. The sparring between Béatrice and Bénédict begins in the next musical number, a duo. An allegretto trio of &quot;conspiratorial humour&quot; for Don Pedro, Claudio and Bénédict, consists of the latter expounding his views on marriage to which the others pass comment. After Somarone has rehearsed his Epithalame grotesque (a choral fugue about love), Bénédict&#x27;s fast rondo reveals that he has fallen for the plot and will try to be in love. The act ends with a nocturne for Héro and Ursule – a slow duo in which W. J. Turner described as &quot;a marvel of indescribable lyrical beauty&quot; and which &quot;Grove&quot; compares to &quot;&quot; in &quot;Les Troyens&quot;.

The second act opens with a drinking song for Somarone and chorus with guitar and tambourine prominent. Next, in an extended air across a wide melodic span, Béatrice acknowledges that she too is powerless against love and in the following trio (added after the premiere) Héro and Ursule join her to extol the joys of marriage. There is a &quot;&quot; and the work ends with a brilliant duet marked scherzo-duettino for the title characters whose &quot;sparkle and gaiety&quot; end the comedy perfectly.

==Synopsis==
:Time: The 16th century.
:Place: Messina, Sicily.

===Act 1===
Don Pedro, prince of Aragon, is visiting Messina after a successful military victory over the Moors, which is celebrated by all of Sicily. He is joined by two friends and fellow soldiers, Claudio and Bénédict. They are greeted by Léonato, governor of Messina, together with his daughter, Héro, and niece, Béatrice.

Héro awaits the return of her fiancé, Claudio, unwounded and rewarded for his valour. Béatrice inquires about and scorns Bénédict. They trade insults, as they have in previous meetings, and tease each other. Bénédict swears to his friends that he will never marry. Later, Claudio and Pedro scheme to trick Bénédict into marrying Béatrice. Knowing that he is listening, Léonato assures Pedro that Béatrice loves Bénédict. Upon hearing this, Bénédict resolves that Béatrice&#x27;s love must not go unrequited, and so he decides to pursue her. Meanwhile, elsewhere, Héro and her attendant, Ursule, manage to play a similar trick on Béatrice who now believes that Bénédict is secretly in love with her.

===Act 2===
To celebrate the pending wedding of Claudio and Héro, Léonato hosts a masquerade party. A local music teacher, Somarone, leads the group in song and everybody enjoys themselves except Béatrice who realizes that she has fallen in love with Bénédict. With Héro and Ursule she sings of the happiness of a bride about to be wed. As she turns to leave she is met by Bénédict, prompting an exchange in which they both attempt to conceal their love for each other. A notary solemnizes the marriage of Claudio and Héro, and, as arranged by Léonato, produces a second contract, asking for another couple to come forward. Bénédict summons the courage to declare his love to Beatrice; the two sign the wedding contract, and the work ends with the words &quot;today a truce is signed, we&#x27;ll be enemies again tomorrow&quot;.

<text>[[Discrete mathematics]] is the study of mathematical structures that are fundamentally discrete rather than continuous. In contrast to real numbers that have the property of varying &quot;smoothly&quot;, the objects studied in discrete mathematics – such as integers, graphs, and statements in logic – do not vary smoothly in this way, but have distinct, separated values. Discrete mathematics, therefore, excludes topics in &quot;continuous mathematics&quot; such as calculus and analysis.

Included below are many of the standard terms used routinely in university-level courses and in research papers. This is not, however, intended as a complete list of mathematical terms; just a selection of typical &quot;terms of art&quot; that may be encountered.

<text>Marie-France Pisier (10 May 194424 April 2011) was a French actress, screenwriter, and director. She appeared in numerous films of the French New Wave, and twice earned the national César Award for Best Supporting Actress.

==Early life==
Pisier was born on 10 May 1944 in Dalat (now Vietnam), where her father was serving as a colonial official in French Indochina. Her younger brother, Gilles Pisier, is a mathematician and a member of the French Academy of Sciences. Her sister, political scientist Evelyn, was the first wife of Bernard Kouchner, a French politician and the co-founder of Médecins Sans Frontières. The family moved to Paris when Marie-France was 12 years old.

==Career==
Five years later, Pisier made her screen acting debut for director François Truffaut in his 1962 film &quot;Antoine and Colette&quot;. She had a brief, but incendiary, romance with the older, married Truffaut. Despite its end, she later appeared in Truffaut&#x27;s &quot;Stolen Kisses&quot; (&quot;Baisers volés&quot;, 1968) and &quot;Love on the Run&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;Amour en fuite&quot;, 1979), the fifth and final film in Truffaut&#x27;s series about the character Antoine Doinel. Pisier was credited as a co-writer of the screenplay. In a review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, film critic Vincent Canby praised her &quot;ravishing performance&quot;.

Pisier later collaborated on the screenplay to Jacques Rivette&#x27;s &quot;Celine and Julie Go Boating&quot; (&quot;Céline et Julie vont en bateau&quot;, 1974); she also played a significant supporting role in the film. Later in the same year, she had a role in Luis Buñuel&#x27;s &quot;Phantom of Liberty&quot;.

Pisier gained widespread public recognition in 1975 when she appeared in Jean-Charles Tacchella&#x27;s popular comedy &quot;Cousin Cousine&quot;. Her role as the volatile Karine earned her a César Award for Best Supporting Actress. Her subsequent feature films included three with director André Téchiné: &quot;French Provincial&quot; (&quot;Souvenirs en France&quot;, 1975); &quot;The Bronte Sisters&quot; (&quot;Les sœurs Brontë&quot;, 1979), in which she portrayed Charlotte; and &quot;Barocco&quot; (1976), for which she won a second César for her performance alongside Isabelle Adjani and Gérard Depardieu.

Pisier attempted to crack the American film industry with &quot;The Other Side of Midnight&quot; (1977), adapted from a Sidney Sheldon novel. She appeared on American television in the miniseries &quot;The French Atlantic Affair&quot; (1979), and &quot;Scruples&quot; the next year. She made two more Hollywood films, &quot;French Postcards&quot; (1979) with Debra Winger and &quot;Chanel Solitaire&quot; (1981) with Timothy Dalton.

Returning to France, Pisier made her directorial debut with &quot;The Governor&#x27;s Party&quot; (&quot;Le bal du gouverneur&quot;, 1990), which she adapted from her own novel. She also played Madame Verdurin in Raúl Ruiz&#x27;s adaptation of Marcel Proust, &quot;Time Regained&quot; (&quot;Le temps retrouvé&quot;, 1999). Her final film as director was with Bérénice Bejo (winner of the César Award for Best Actress in &quot;The Artist&quot;) in &quot;Like An Airplane&quot; (&quot;Comme un avion&quot;, 2002).

==Personal life==

Pisier&#x27;s first marriage to Georges Kiejman ended in divorce. She resided in Saint-Cyr-sur-Mer, Var, and was married to Thierry Funck-Brentano. The couple had a son, Mathieu, and a daughter, Iris.

In 1971, Pisier signed the Manifesto of the 343, publicly declaring she had an illegal abortion.

==Death==
Pisier died on 24 April 2011, aged 66. She was found dead in her swimming pool by Funck-Brentano and is believed to have drowned. She was survived by her sister Évelyne, brother Gilles, and both children. The local mayor announced her death to the news media and President Nicolas Sarkozy made a public statement honouring &quot;her supreme elegance born of the most perfect simplicity&quot;.

<text>Terence Chimes (born 5 July 1956, Stepney, London, England) is an English musician, best known as the original drummer of punk rock group the Clash. He played with them from July 1976 to November 1976, January 1977 to April 1977, and again from May 1982 to February 1983 both preceding and succeeding his replacement Topper Headon. Chimes also drummed for Generation X from 1980 to 1981, Hanoi Rocks in 1985, and Black Sabbath from 1987 to 1988. In 2003, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of The Clash.

==Career==

===The Clash===

Terry Chimes met Mick Jones and Paul Simonon through the local music scene, and would team up with Joe Strummer and Keith Levene to form the Clash.

Both Chimes and Levene subsequently left, but Chimes was brought back to record the band&#x27;s self-titled debut album, &quot;The Clash&quot;. On the album sleeve, he was credited as Tory Crimes. After recording the album, Chimes left the band once again and was replaced by Topper Headon.

In 1982, Headon was forced out of the band for his drug addiction, and Chimes was asked to rejoin. He participated in The Casbah Club tours for both the US and the UK, a brief tour supporting the Who, and the following Combat Rock tour back in the USA. He appeared in the music video for the single, &quot;Rock the Casbah.&quot; After the Jamaican World Music Festival of 1982, he left for the third and final time.

===Other bands===
After leaving The Clash, Chimes drummed in bands including Johnny Thunders and the Heartbreakers briefly in 1977 and 1984, Cowboys International in 1979, Gen X from 1980 to 1981, Hanoi Rocks in 1985, the Cherry Bombz in 1986 (with ex Hanoi Rocks members Andy McCoy and Nasty Suicide and ex Sham 69/Wanderers/the Lords of the New Church Dave Tregunna) and Black Sabbath on their Eternal Idol Tour in 1987–88. He also played drums with Billy Idol for a period of time.

===Later years===
In 2003, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of The Clash. At the induction ceremony, he gave an acceptance speech praising Topper Headon&#x27;s work.

He was nominated as a Scouting in London Ambassador for the Scout Association Region for Greater London at an Adult Appreciation ceremony in 2008.

He currently plays drums for the Crunch and the Anita Chellemah Band.

==Personal life==
Chimes is a practising Catholic. Since 1994, he has worked as a chiropractor in Essex at his clinic, Chimes Chiropractic. He also runs chiropractic seminars.

<text>Hansel and Gretel (German: ) is an opera by nineteenth-century composer Engelbert Humperdinck, who described it as a &quot; (fairy-tale opera). The libretto was written by Humperdinck&#x27;s sister, Adelheid Wette, based on the Grimm brothers&#x27; fairy tale of the same name. It is much admired for its folk music-inspired themes, one of the most famous being the &quot; (&quot;Evening Benediction&quot;) from act 2.

The idea for the opera was proposed to Humperdinck by his sister, who approached him about writing music for songs that she had written for her children for Christmas based on &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot;. After several revisions, the musical sketches and the songs were turned into a full-scale opera.

Humperdinck composed &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot; in Frankfurt in 1891 and 1892. The opera was first performed in the Hoftheater in Weimar on 23 December 1893, conducted by Richard Strauss. It has been associated with Christmas since its earliest performances and today it is still most often performed at Christmas time.

==Performance history==
&quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot; was first conducted in Weimar by Richard Strauss in 1893, followed by its Hamburg premiere on 25 September 1894, conducted by Gustav Mahler.

Its first performance outside Germany was in Basel, Switzerland, on 16 November 1894.

The first performance in England was in London on 26 December 1894, at Daly&#x27;s Theatre and its first United States performance was on 8 October 1895 in New York.

The first performance in Australia was on 6 April 1907, at the Princess Theatre, Melbourne.

In English-speaking countries &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot; is most often performed in English. The longtime standard English translation was by Constance Bache. In the United States the opera was often performed in a translation by Norman Kelley written for the Metropolitan Opera&#x27;s 1967 production by Nathaniel Merrill and Robert O&#x27;Hearn. In 1987 a darkly comic new production with English translation by David Pountney was created for the English National Opera in London. Since 2007, the Met has performed the work in a production originally created for the Welsh National Opera using Pountney&#x27;s translation.

==Roles==


==Synopsis==
===Act 1===
&quot;Scene 1: At home&quot;

Gretel stitches a stocking, and Hansel is making a broom. Gretel sings to herself as she works. Hansel mocks her, singing to the same tune a song about how hungry he is. He wishes for mother to come home. Gretel tells him to be quiet and reminds him of what father always says: &quot;When the need is greatest, God the Lord puts out His hand.&quot; Hansel complains that one cannot eat words, and Gretel cheers him up by telling him a secret: A neighbor has given mother a jug of milk, and tonight she will make a rice blancmange for them to eat. Hansel, excited, tastes the cream on the top of the milk. Gretel scolds him and tells him he should get back to work. Hansel says that he does not want to work, he would rather dance. Gretel agrees, and they begin to dance around.

&quot;Scene 2&quot;

Mother enters, and she is furious when she finds that Hansel and Gretel have not been working. As she threatens to beat them with a stick, she knocks over the jug of milk. Mother sends Hansel and Gretel to the haunted Ilsenstein forest to look for strawberries. Alone, she expresses her sorrow that she is unable to feed her children, and asks God for help.

&quot;Scene 3&quot;

From far off, father sings about how hungry he is. He bursts into the house, roaring drunk, and kisses mother roughly. She pushes him away and scolds him for being drunk. He surprises her by taking from his pack a feast: Bacon, butter, flour, sausages, fourteen eggs, beans, onions, and a quarter pound of coffee. He explains to her that beyond the forest, it is almost time for a festival, and everyone is cleaning in preparation. He went from house to house and sold his brooms at the highest prices. As father and mother celebrate, he suddenly stops and asks where the children are. Mother changes the subject to the broken jug, and after she finishes telling him the story, he laughs, then asks again after the children. She tells him that they are in the Ilsenstein forest. Suddenly scared, father tells her that the forest is where the evil Gingerbread Witch (literally, &quot;Nibbling Witch&quot;) dwells. She lures children with cakes and sweets, pushes them into her oven, where they turn to gingerbread, and then eats them. Father and mother rush to the forest to search for their children.

===Act 2===
Here there is a prelude which begins the act, called the &quot;Witch-ride&quot;. Sometimes, the two acts are linked to each other, and the prelude is treated as an interlude.

&quot;Scene 1: In the forest. Sunset.&quot;

Gretel weaves a crown of flowers as she sings to herself. Hansel searches for strawberries. As Gretel finishes her crown, Hansel fills his basket. Gretel tries to put the crown on Hansel, but, saying that boys do not play with things like these, he puts it on her head instead. He tells her that she looks like the Queen of the Wood, and she says that if that&#x27;s so, then he should give her a bouquet, too. He offers her the strawberries. They hear a cuckoo calling, and they begin to eat the strawberries. As the basket empties, they fight for the remaining strawberries, and finally, Hansel grabs the basket and dumps the leftovers in his mouth. Gretel scolds him and tells him that mother will be upset. She tries to look for more, but it is too dark for her to see. Hansel tries to find the way back, but he cannot. As the forest darkens, Hansel and Gretel become scared, and think they see something coming closer. Hansel calls out, &quot;Who&#x27;s there?&quot; and a chorus of echoes calls back, &quot;He&#x27;s there!&quot; Gretel calls, &quot;Is someone there?&quot; and the echoes reply, &quot;There!&quot; Hansel tries to comfort Gretel, but as a little man walks out of the forest, she screams in terror.

&quot;Scene 2&quot;

The little man turns out to be the Sandman. He calms the frightened children down by telling them that he loves them dearly, and that he has come to put them to sleep. He puts grains of sand into their eyes, and as he leaves they can barely keep their eyes open. Gretel reminds Hansel to say their evening prayer, and after they pray, they fall asleep on the forest floor.

&quot;Scene 3&quot;

&quot;Traumpantomime&quot; [dream pantomime]. Fourteen angels come out and arrange themselves around the children to protect them as they sleep. They are presented with a gift. The forest is filled with light as the curtain falls.

===Act 3===
&quot;Scene 1: In the forest.&quot;

The Dew Fairy comes to wake the children. She sprinkles dew on them, sings of how wonderful it is to be alive in the morning with the beauty of the forest surrounding her, and leaves as the children stir. Gretel wakes first, and wakes the sleepy Hansel. They tell each other of their mutual dream, of angels protecting them as they slept.

&quot;Scene 2&quot;

Suddenly they notice behind them a glorious gingerbread house. The roof is slated with cakes, the windows are of licorice, and the walls are decorated with cookies. On the left side is an oven, on the right side is a cage, and around it is a fence of gingerbread children. Unable to resist temptation, they take a little bit of the house and nibble on it.

&quot;Scene 3&quot;

As the children nibble, a voice calls out, &quot;Nibbling, nibbling, little mouse! Who&#x27;s nibbling on my little house?&quot; Hansel and Gretel decide that the voice must have been the wind, and they begin to eat the house. As Hansel breaks off another piece of the house, the voice again calls out, &quot;Nibbling, nibbling, little mouse! Who&#x27;s nibbling on my little house?&quot; Hansel and Gretel ignore the voice, and continue eating. The witch comes out of the house and catches Hansel with a rope, As Hansel tries to escape, the witch explains that she is Rosine Leckermaul (literally, &quot;Rosina Tastymuzzle&quot;), that she likes nothing better than to feed children sweets. She tries to convince Hansel &amp; Gretel to come into her house by offering them Chocolates, Tarts, Marzipans, Turkish Delight, Lollipops, Wedding Cakes, Strawberry Italian Ices, Blancmange, Almonds, Raisins, Peaches &amp; Citrons but Hansel and Gretel are suspicious of the witch, so Hansel frees himself from the rope and he and Gretel begin to run away.

The witch takes out her wand and calls out, &quot;Stop!&quot; Hansel and Gretel are frozen to the spot where they stand. Using the wand, the witch leads Hansel to the cage. The witch leaves him stiff and slow of movement. She tells Gretel to be reasonable, and then the witch goes inside to fetch raisins and almonds with which to fatten Hansel. Hansel whispers to Gretel to pretend to obey the witch. The witch returns, and waving her wand, says, &quot;Hocus pocus, holderbush! Loosen, rigid muscles, hush!&quot; Using the wand, the witch forces Gretel to dance, then tells her to go into the house and set the table. Hansel pretends to be asleep, and the witch, overcome with excitement, describes how she plans to cook and eat Gretel.

The witch wakes up Hansel and has him show her his finger. He puts out a bone instead, and she feels it instead. Disappointed that he is so thin, the witch calls for Gretel to bring out raisins and almonds. As the witch tries to feed Hansel, Gretel steals the wand from the witch&#x27;s pocket. Waving it towards Hansel, Gretel whispers, &quot;Hocus pocus, holderbush! Loosen rigid muscles, hush!&quot; As the witch turns around and wonders at the noise, Hansel discovers that he can move freely again.

The witch tells Gretel to peek inside the oven to see if the gingerbread is done. Hansel softly calls out to her to be careful. Gretel pretends that she does not know what the witch means. The witch tells her to lift herself a little bit and bend her head forward. Gretel says that she is &quot;a goose&quot; and doesn&#x27;t understand, then asks the witch to demonstrate. The witch, frustrated, opens the oven and leans forward. Hansel springs out of the cage, and he and Gretel shove the witch into the oven. They dance. The oven begins to crackle and the flames burn fiercely, and with a loud crash it explodes.

&quot;Scene 4&quot;

Around Hansel and Gretel, the gingerbread children have turned back into humans. They are asleep and unable to move, but they sing to Hansel and Gretel, asking to be touched. Hansel is afraid, but Gretel strokes one on the cheek, and he wakes up, but is still unable to move. Hansel and Gretel touch all the children, then Hansel takes the witch&#x27;s wand and, waving it, calls out the magic words, freeing the children from the spell.

&quot;Scene 5&quot;

Father is heard in the distance, calling for Hansel and Gretel. He and mother enter and embrace Hansel and Gretel. Meanwhile, the gingerbread children pull out from the ruins of the oven the witch, who has turned into gingerbread. Father gathers Hansel, Gretel and the other children around and tells them to look at this miracle. He explains that this is heaven&#x27;s punishment for evil deeds and reminds them, &quot;When the need is greatest, God the Lord puts out His hand.&quot;

==In popular culture==
===Radio and screen===
*1931: &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot; was the first complete Metropolitan Opera radio broadcast performance, on Christmas Day in 1931.
*1943, December 23: &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot; was the first opera to be broadcast in its entirety on television, on WRGB, a local Schenectady, New York, TV station.
*1954: The opera was made into a Technicolor film in English (&quot;Hansel &amp; Gretel&quot;), with so-called &quot;electronic&quot; puppets (actually, a version of stop motion puppets). The screenplay was by Irish author Padraic Colum. Anna Russell provided the voice of Rosina Rubylips, the Witch. Not all of the score was used; the opera was, instead, presented as a sort of operetta, with spoken dialogue between the main numbers. Baritone Frank Rogier sang the role of the Father. Soprano Constance Brigham sang both Hansel and Gretel, but actress Mildred Dunnock, who did not sing her role, provided the voice of the Mother. Franz Allers conducted.
*1970: Canadian Broadcasting Corporation produced a version of the opera directed by Norman Campbell with Maureen Forrester as the Witch.
*1982: Again on Christmas Day, the opera was telecast live on the PBS &quot;Live from the Met&quot; series and sung once again in English. Frederica von Stade and Judith Blegen sang the title roles, with Thomas Fulton conducting. Michael Devlin sang Peter. The performance is available on DVD.
*1998: Maurice Sendak&#x27;s production of the opera, which deliberately strips away all the spectacular fantasy elements in the &quot;Children&#x27;s Prayer&quot; scene, was shown on television, and was directed by Frank Corsaro.
*2008: The Royal Opera House in London recorded a German-language version in association with opera DVD specialist Opus Arte, the BBC and NHK. It was directed by Moshe Leiser and Patrice Caurier and had Diana Damrau as Gretel, Angelika Kirchschlager as Hansel, Thomas Allen as Peter and Anja Silja as Witch.

For other film versions, see: &quot;Hansel and Gretel (film)&quot;

===Literature===

<text>Daniel Ceccaldi (25 July 1927 – 27 March 2003) was a French actor.

He was born in Meaux, Seine-et-Marne, France. The mild-mannered Daniel Ceccaldi is famous as Claude Jade&#x27;s father &quot;Lucien Darbon&quot; in François Truffaut&#x27;s movies &quot;Stolen Kisses&quot; and &quot;Bed and Board&quot;. Note: Christine refers to him twice as &quot;Lucien&quot;, not papa, indicating perhaps that he is not her biological father, echoing Truffaut&#x27;s own experience. The American critic Bob Wade wrote about Ceccaldi in &#x27;Stolen Kisses&#x27;: &quot;Claude Jade&#x27;s parents are memorably played by Daniel Ceccaldi and Claire Duhamel. Ceccaldi’s role may represent the most pleasant and neurosis-free father in any movie of the era. He overflows with Dickensian warmth and geniality.&quot;

<text>John Lincoln Forsythe ( Freund; January 29, 1918 – April 1, 2010) was an American stage, film/television actor, producer, narrator, drama teacher and philanthropist whose career spanned six decades. He also appeared as a guest on several talk and variety shows and as a panelist on numerous game shows.

His acting career began in films in 1943. He signed up with Warner Bros. at age 25 as a minor contract player, but he starred in &quot;The Captive City&quot; (1952) and co-starred opposite Loretta Young in &quot;It Happens Every Thursday&quot; (1953), Edmund Gwenn and Shirley MacLaine in &quot;The Trouble with Harry&quot; (1955), and Olivia de Havilland in &quot;The Ambassador&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1956).

He also enjoyed a long successful television career, starring in three television series in three genres: as the single playboy father Bentley Gregg in the sitcom &quot;Bachelor Father&quot; (1957–1962); as the unseen millionaire Charles Townsend in the crime drama &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; (1976–1981)—a role he reprised in the 2000 and 2003 film adaptations; and as patriarch Blake Carrington in &quot;Dynasty&quot; (1981–1989). He hosted the series &quot;World of Survival&quot; (1971–1977), and was the host of the 38th Miss Universe Pageant, broadcast on CBS in 1989.

==Early life==
The eldest of three children, Forsythe was born John (or Jacob) Lincoln Freund, on January 29, 1918, in Penns Grove, New Jersey, the son of Blanche Forsythe (née Blohm) and Samuel Jeremiah Freund, a stockbroker. Blanche was born in Georgia to David Hyat Blohm, a Russian Jewish immigrant, and Mary S. Materson, who was born in Maryland to Jewish emigrants from Prussia. Forysthe&#x27;s father was born in New York to Polish Jewish immigrants. Forsythe was raised in the Jewish faith.

He was raised in Brooklyn, New York, where his father worked as a Wall Street businessman during the Great Depression of the 1930s. He graduated from Abraham Lincoln High School in Brooklyn at the age of 16, and began attending the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. In 1936, at the age of 18, he took a job as the public address announcer for Brooklyn Dodgers games at Ebbets Field, confirming a childhood love of baseball. He was a lifelong active Democrat.

==Movie career and Army service==

Despite showing initial reluctance, Forsythe began an acting career at the suggestion of his father. He met actress Parker Worthington McCormick (December 29, 1918 – July 22, 1980), and the couple married in 1939; they had a son, Dall (born February 14, 1941), and divorced in 1943. As a bit player for Warner Brothers, Forsythe successfully appeared in several small parts.

As a result, he was given a small role in &quot;Destination Tokyo&quot; (1943). Leaving his movie career for service in the United States Army Air Forces in World War II, he appeared in the USAAF-produced play &quot;Winged Victory&quot;, then worked with injured soldiers who had developed speech problems.

Also in 1943, Forsythe met Julie Warren, initially a theatre companion, but later a successful actress in her own right, landing a role on Broadway in &quot;Around the World&quot;. She became Forsythe&#x27;s second wife, and in the early 1950s they had two daughters.

In 1947, Forsythe joined the initial class of the Actors Studio, where he met Marlon Brando and Julie Harris, among others. During this time he appeared on Broadway in &quot;Mister Roberts&quot; and &quot;The Teahouse of the August Moon&quot;. In 1955, Alfred Hitchcock cast him in the movie &quot;The Trouble with Harry&quot;, with Shirley MacLaine in her first movie appearance, for which she won a Golden Globe. In 1969, Forsythe appeared in another Hitchcock film, &quot;Topaz&quot;.

==Television work==

Throughout the 1950s, Forsythe successfully appeared in the new medium and worked regularly on all the networks, especially as a guest star. He appeared in the &quot;Premonition&quot; episode of the popular anthology &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents,&quot; opposite Cloris Leachman.

Forsythe was cast in a 1957 episode, &quot;Decision at Wilson&#x27;s Creek&quot;, on the CBS anthology series &quot;Dick Powell&#x27;s Zane Grey Theatre.&quot; He played Confederate Lieutenant David Marr who suddenly resigns to return to his wife, only to find that he is scorned by townspeople.

Outdoor location sequences for the episode were shot on the Iverson Movie Ranch in Chatsworth, California, where a number of scenes took place in a group of oak trees that later came to be known as the Midway Oaks. One of those oak trees, a distinctive multi-trunked tree with a characteristic lean, became known as the Forsythe Oak, commemorating John Forsythe&#x27;s appearance at the fabled movie ranch, considered the most widely filmed outdoor location in movie and television history. The Forsythe Oak remains in place today; it is located on a private estate on the former Upper Iverson.

===&quot;Bachelor Father&quot;===
In 1957, he took a leading role in the situation comedy &quot;Bachelor Father&quot; for CBS as Bentley Gregg, a playboy lawyer who has to become a father to his niece Kelly (played by Noreen Corcoran), upon the death of her parents. The show was an immediate ratings hit and moved to NBC the following season and to ABC in the fall of 1961. On various episodes Forsythe worked with such up-and-coming actresses as Mary Tyler Moore, Barbara Eden, Donna Douglas, Sally Kellerman, Sue Ane Langdon, and a teenage Linda Evans. During the 1961–1962 season, &quot;Bachelor Father&quot; was cancelled because of declining ratings.

===After &quot;Bachelor Father&quot;===
During the 1960s, Forsythe returned to acting in movies including &quot;Kitten with a Whip&quot; (1964), &quot;Madame X&quot; (1966) and &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; (1967). In 1964 he starred in &quot;See How They Run&quot; which is notable for being the first film made for television.

He attempted two new television programs: &quot;The John Forsythe Show&quot; on NBC with Guy Marks, Elsa Lanchester, Ann B. Davis, Peggy Lipton, and Forsythe&#x27;s two young daughters, Page and Brooke (1965–1966), and &quot;To Rome with Love&quot; on CBS (1969–1971) with co-star Walter Brennan. Between 1971 and 1977, Forsythe served as narrator on the syndicated nature series, &quot;World of Survival&quot;. He was also the announcer for Michelob beer commercials during the 1970s and 1980s, notably during the &quot;Weekends were made for Michelob&quot; era.

===&quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;===
Forsythe began a 13-year association with Aaron Spelling in 1976, cast in the role of mysterious unseen millionaire private investigator Charles Townsend in the crime drama &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; (1976–1981). The show starred Kate Jackson, Jaclyn Smith and Farrah Fawcett, making stars of all three but especially Fawcett. Forsythe introduces the series&#x27; concept during its opening credits:

Forsythe became the highest-paid actor on television on a per-hour basis: while the show&#x27;s on-camera stars often worked 15-hour days five days a week, with a couple of hours just for hair and makeup, Forsythe&#x27;s lines for an entire episode would be recorded in a sound studio in a matter of minutes, after which he would have lunch in the network&#x27;s commissary and then leave for the track. During this period, Forsythe invested much money in Thoroughbred racing, a personal hobby. Gaining respect with the celebrity Thoroughbred circuit, he served on the board of directors at the Hollywood Park Racetrack starting in 1972, and was on the committee for more than 25 years.

Following heart problems, Forsythe underwent quadruple coronary artery bypass surgery in 1979. This was so successful that he not only returned to work on &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, he also appeared in the two-time Academy Award-nominated motion picture &quot;...And Justice for All&quot; later that year as Judge Henry T. Fleming, the film&#x27;s main antagonist, a corrupt judge who despises Al Pacino&#x27;s lawyer character.

===&quot;Dynasty&quot;===
In 1981, nearing the end of &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, Forsythe was selected as a last-minute replacement for George Peppard in the role of the dedicated and resilient patriarch Blake Carrington in &quot;Dynasty&quot;. Another Spelling production, &quot;Dynasty&quot; was ABC&#x27;s answer to the highly successful CBS series &quot;Dallas&quot;. Between 1985 and 1986, Forsythe also appeared as Blake Carrington in the short-lived spinoff series &quot;The Colbys&quot;.

The series reunited Forsythe with one-time &quot;Bachelor Father&quot; guest star Linda Evans, who would play Blake&#x27;s wife, Krystle. During the run of the series, Forsythe, Evans and co-star Joan Collins, who played Blake&#x27;s ex-wife Alexis, promoted the &quot;Dynasty&quot; line of fragrances. &quot;Dynasty&quot; came to an end in 1989, after nine seasons. Forsythe was the only actor to appear in all 220 episodes.

Forsythe was nominated for Emmy Awards three times between 1982 and 1984 for &quot;Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series&quot; but did not win. He was also nominated six times for Golden Globe Awards, winning twice. He was nominated five times for the &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; Awards, also winning twice. In 1983, Forsythe was presented with the American Academy of Achievement&#x27;s Golden Plate Award at a ceremony in Coronado, California.

===&quot;The Powers That Be&quot;===
In 1992, after a three-year absence, Forsythe returned to series television starring in Norman Lear&#x27;s situation comedy &quot;The Powers That Be&quot; for NBC, co-starring Holland Taylor, Peter MacNicol, Valerie Mahaffey and David Hyde Pierce.

==Post-1990s work and life==

Forsythe&#x27;s wife of 51 years, Julie Warren (October 20, 1919 – August 15, 1994), died at age 74 from cancer in hospital after Forsythe made the decision to disconnect her life-support system. She had been in a coma following severe breathing difficulties.

In July 2002, Forsythe married businesswoman Nicole Carter (May 27, 1941 – May 11, 2010) at Ballard Country Church; they remained married until his death. Nicole Carter Forsythe died five weeks after her husband.

Forsythe reprised his role as the voice of Charlie for the film version of &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; (2000) and its sequel &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels: Full Throttle&quot; (2003); he then retired from acting.

Besides spending time with his family, he enjoyed ownership of an art gallery. In 2005 actor Bartholomew John portrayed Forsythe in &quot;&quot;, a fictionalized television movie based on the creation and production of &quot;Dynasty&quot;.

On May 2, 2006, Forsythe appeared with &quot;Dynasty&quot; co-stars Linda Evans, Joan Collins, Pamela Sue Martin, Al Corley, Gordon Thomson and Catherine Oxenberg in &quot;Dynasty Reunion: Catfights &amp; Caviar&quot;. The one-hour reunion special of the former ABC series aired on CBS. Forsythe appeared each year to read to children during the annual Christmas program near his home at the rural resort community of Solvang, California.

Forsythe was treated for colorectal cancer in the fall of 2006. Surgery was reportedly successful and his cancer was considered to be in remission at the time of his death.

==Death==
Forsythe died on April 1, 2010, from pneumonia in Santa Ynez, California, at the age of 92. He was interred at Oak Hill Cemetery, Ballard, Santa Barbara County, California.

==Thoroughbred racing==
Forsythe owned and bred Thoroughbred racehorses for many years and was a member of the board of directors of Hollywood Park Racetrack. Among his successes, in partnership with film producer Martin Ritt he won the 1976 Longacres Mile with Yu Wipi.

With partner Ken Opstein, he won the 1982 Sixty Sails Handicap with Targa, and the 1993 La Brea Stakes with a daughter of Targa, Mamselle Bebette, which he raced under the name of his Big Train Farm, a stable he named for Hall of Fame baseball pitcher, Walter Johnson.

In the 1980s, Forsythe served as the regular host for the annual Eclipse Awards. He was the recipient of the 1988 Eclipse Award of Merit for his contribution in promoting the sport of Thoroughbred racing.

<text>Helga Ursula &quot;Uschi&quot; Glas (; born 2 March 1944), sometimes credited as Ursula Glas, is a German actress in film, television, and on stage, and a singer.

==Biography==

Born in Landau an der Isar, Bavaria, Glas started appearing in films in 1965. Her breakthrough role was that of Barbara in the unconventional 1968 movie &quot;Go for It, Baby&quot; (&quot;Zur Sache, Schätzchen&quot;), which captured the spirit of the times in that it presented youthful protest against the German establishment and hinted at the loosening of morals in the wake of the sexual revolution. From then on, the tabloid press would refer to Glas frequently as &quot;Schätzchen&quot; ().

In the late &#x27;60s and early &#x27;70s, Glas appeared in many slapstick movies, notably in three films of the seven-part series (1967–72) &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Brats on the Front Bench Row&quot;). She made five comedy films opposite singer Roy Black.

In the 1980s and 1990s Glas concentrated on her television work, appearing in a succession of TV series tailored to her person, playing, among other characters, a veterinarian in &quot;Tierärztin Christine&quot; (1993), an energetic businesswoman in &quot;Anna Maria – Eine Frau geht ihren Weg&quot; (&quot;Anna Maria - A Woman goes her Way&quot;, 1995-1996), and the ideal teacher in &quot;Sylvia – Eine Klasse für sich&quot; (&quot;Sylvia - A Class of her own&quot;, 1998-2000). She also appeared in many feature-length made-for-TV movies. In total, Glas appeared in more than 75 film and TV productions.

Glas was married to the film producer from 1981 until their divorce in 2003; they had three children. In 2005, Glas married the business consultant Dieter Herrmann. She is now the step-mother to Sophie Hermann, a social media influencer and fashion designer who appears in the UK reality TV series Made in Chelsea.

In 2004, Glas published a memoir, &quot;Mit einem Lächeln&quot; (&quot;With a Smile&quot;).

<text>Semele (HWV 58) is a &#x27;musical drama&#x27;, originally presented &quot;after the manner of an oratorio&quot;, in three parts by George Frideric Handel. Based on an existing opera libretto by William Congreve, the work is an opera in all but name but was first presented in concert form at Covent Garden theatre on 10 February 1744. The story comes from Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; and concerns Semele, mother of Bacchus. Handel also referred to the work as &#x27;The Story of Semele&#x27;. The work contains the famous aria &quot;Where&#x27;er you walk&quot;.

The work fuses elements of opera, oratorio and classical drama. &quot;Semele&quot; was presented during Lent, one of Handel&#x27;s regular oratorio seasons. However it was not what London audiences were expecting of an oratorio during the solemn season of Lent. &quot;Semele&quot; has a secular text with a story involving an adulterous sexual relationship. It is distinguished from Handel&#x27;s operas by the large number of polyphonic choruses. &quot;Semele&quot; was performed four times during its original run, and twice again later the same year, but those were the only performances in Handel&#x27;s lifetime. Today &quot;Semele&quot; is frequently fully staged and receives regular performances at many of the world&#x27;s opera houses, as well as performances in concert form.

==Background==
Handel&#x27;s last Italian opera, &quot;Deidamia&quot;, was performed in 1741. After this time, he concentrated on oratorios and musical dramas with English texts. Many of these, including &quot;Semele&quot;, were premiered at the Covent Garden Theatre, beginning with &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Feast&quot; in 1736 and finishing with &quot;The Triumph of Time and Truth&quot; in 1757. As a result, in the early 1740s, oratorios at the Covent Garden Theatre were Handel&#x27;s chief activity. While most of these works had sacred or religious texts, two stand out for being secular: &quot;Hercules&quot; and &quot;Semele&quot;.

The libretto was written by William Congreve around 1705–6 and originally set to music in John Eccles&#x27;s opera &quot;Semele&quot;. The text was adapted for Handel by an unknown collaborator, and he wrote the music in just over a month, from 3 June to 4 July 1743. &quot;Semele&quot; contains self-borrowings from &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; and &quot;Fra pensieri qual pensiero&quot; (HWV 115), as well as borrowings from Alessandro Scarlatti (notably &quot;Il Pompeo&quot;), Porta, Reinhard Keiser, and Telemann. Noteworthy in the score are the number and quality of accompanied recitatives (a characteristic it shares with &quot;Il Pompeo&quot;), and the sheer variety of style and tempo markings (23, with nine unique in English works).

The musical drama takes a similar shape to an opera, but Handel eyed a place for it on the Covent Garden Theatre&#x27;s oratorio-centered Lenten season of public concerts the following February (1744). So he fashioned &quot;Semele&quot; for presentation in the manner of an oratorio – a wolf in sheep&#x27;s clothing to those not already enlightened to Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;. His ploy to bring a powerful story to the theatre met, perhaps predictably, with mixed reactions. Mary Delany called it a &quot;delightful piece of music&quot;, but commented, &quot;&quot;Semele&quot; has a strong party against it, viz. the fine ladies, petit maitres, and &quot;ignoramuses&quot;. All the opera people are enraged at Handel.&quot; This probably related to the supporters of the rival Middlesex Opera Company, for which Handel would not write. Harsh criticism is also known from &quot;Messiah&quot; librettist Charles Jennens, who recorded it was &quot;a baudy Opera&quot;.

The suggestion &quot;Semele&quot; was &quot;profane&quot; and so perhaps not suitable for respectable audiences caused the work to fall from the repertoire; it was revived only once by Handel.

However, &quot;Semele&quot; is still regarded as a work of high quality. As Lord Harewood put it: 

==Performance history==

&quot;Semele&quot; was first performed on 10 February 1744 at the Covent Garden Theatre, London, as part of a concert series held yearly during Lent. The audience naturally expected Bible-based subject matter. But the amorous topic of &quot;Semele&quot;, which is a creation of the late Restoration Period, transparently drew on Greek myths, and so it displeased those attending for a different kind of uplift. Being in English, &quot;Semele&quot; likewise irritated the supporters of true Italian opera, particularly as Handel would also not write for the rival Middlesex Opera Company. Winton Dean writes in his book &quot;Handel&#x27;s Dramatic Oratorios&quot;:

The public [in 1744] found [&quot;Semele&#x27;s&quot;] tone too close to that of the discredited Italian opera and set it down as an oratorio &quot;manqué&quot;; where they expected wholesome Lenten bread, they received a glittering stone dug from the ruins of Greek mythology.

As a result, only four performances took place. The cast at the première included Elisabeth Duparc (&#x27;La Francesina&#x27;) in the title role, Esther Young as Juno (and Ino), and John Beard as Jupiter. Henry Reinhold sang the bass roles. Handel seems to have interchanged some of the music between singers.

Later, on 1 and 8 December 1744, Handel presented a revised version, this time at the King&#x27;s Theatre, after cutting four sections of dialogue containing sexual innuendo and making additions that included interspersed arias in Italian (for the opera crowd) from Arminio and Giustino.

===20th century===

&quot;Semele&quot; fell into prolonged neglect until its first stage performances, in Cambridge, England, in 1925 and in London in 1954. These fueled an enthusiasm for the work that has not since lapsed.

&quot;Semele&quot; was staged on four occasions (1959, 1961, 1964 and 1975) by the Handel Opera Society under Charles Farncombe, and it entered the repertory of the Sadler&#x27;s Wells Opera (now English National Opera) in 1970. The opera returned in 1982—after a 238-year hiatus—to Covent Garden (the Royal Opera House), with Valerie Masterson in the title role and conducted, as at Sadler&#x27;s Wells, by Charles Mackerras.

The American stage première took place at the Ravinia Festival near Chicago in 1959. &quot;Semele&quot; was performed in Washington, DC, in 1980, and at Carnegie Hall, New York, in 1985, on the latter occasion with Kathleen Battle in the title role and John Nelson conducting. (A recording with a similar cast was made in 1990 and issued on the Deutsche Grammophon label.)

In 1999, &quot;Semele&quot; returned to the English National Opera in London in a highly regarded production by Robert Carsen. Rosemary Joshua played Semele, John Mark-Ainsley was Jupiter, Susan Bickley as Juno, and Sarah Connolly the sister Ino. The production was revived in 2004 with Carolyn Sampson (Semele), Ian Bostridge (Jupiter) and Patricia Bardon (Juno).

===21st century===

Pinchgut Opera staged a production in 2002 in the City Recital Hall, Sydney, conducted by Antony Walker and directed by Justin Way. There is a recording of this production.



In September of the same year a new staging by the Chinese artist Zhang Huan, conducted by Rousset, with Les Talens Lyriques, opened at La Monnaie in Brussels. This moved on 24 October 2010 to Beijing&#x27;s Poly Theater as part of the Beijing Music Festival—the first major production of a baroque opera in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. In May 2012 this production moved to the Canadian Opera Company, receiving generally poor reviews for having excised Handel&#x27;s finale and haphazardly introducing Buddhist themes incongruently to the source material.

Among numerous performances worldwide, the piece received a production as a fully staged opera at Opera Philadelphia in 2019.

==Synopsis==

Precis:

Jupiter, king of the gods, takes the mortal Princess Semele to a secret hiding place on a mountain to be his mistress. When Jupiter&#x27;s wife, Juno, hears of her husband&#x27;s adultery she is enraged, and plots to ensure Semele&#x27;s downfall. In disguise, Juno appeals to the girl&#x27;s vanity and persuades her to insist on seeing her lover in his divine form. Jupiter reluctantly agrees but his thunderbolts burn and consume Semele. From her ashes, though, arise her unborn child by Jupiter—Bacchus, god of wine and ecstasy.

===Act 1===

Scene: Greece, in legendary antiquity

&quot;The scene is the temple of Juno. Near the altar is a golden image of the goddess&quot;

In the temple of Juno, Cadmus, King of Thebes, is preparing for the marriage of his daughter Semele to Athamas, Prince of Boeotia. Signs from the goddess indicate she approves of the match (accompanied recitative: &quot;Behold! Auspicious flashes rise&quot; and chorus: &quot;Lucky omens bless our rites&quot;). However, the bride has been inventing one excuse after the other to put off the wedding and her father and would-be bridegroom urge her to hesitate no longer (duet: &quot;Daughter, hear! Hear and obey!&quot;). To herself, Semele reflects on her dilemma—she does not wish to marry Prince Athamas as she is in love with Jove himself and calls on him to assist her (accompanied recitative: &quot;Ah me! What refuge now is left me?&quot;, arioso: &quot;O Jove! In pity teach me which to choose&quot; and aria: &quot;The morning lark&quot;). Athamas, observing her, takes her physical signs of emotional upheaval as evidence she is in love with him (aria: &quot;Hymen, haste, thy torch prepare&quot;). Ino, Semele&#x27;s sister, now appears, also in a state of distress as she is in love with Athamas (quartet: &quot;Why dost thou thus untimely grieve?&quot;) Jupiter has heard Semele&#x27;s prayer and his thunderbolts interrupt the proceedings and alarm the observers (chorus: &quot;Avert these omens, all ye pow&#x27;rs&quot;). The priests of Juno order the wedding abandoned and everyone to leave the temple (chorus: &quot;Cease, cease your vows&quot;), which all do except for Athamas, in despair at his wedding being cancelled, and Ino, hopelessly in love with him (aria: &quot;Turn, hopeless lover&quot;). Athamas can see she is upset, without guessing why, and he can feel for her in her distress because he is upset too (aria: &quot;Your tuneful voice my tale would tell&quot;). Athamas is astonished when she tells him bluntly that she loves him (duet: &quot;You&#x27;ve undone me&quot;). Cadmus interrupts their confusion and describes the extraordinary event he has just witnessed: as they fled the temple Semele was suddenly carried off by an eagle (accompanied recitative: &quot;Wing&#x27;d with our fears&quot;). The priests and augurs identify this eagle as Jupiter himself (chorus: &quot;Hail Cadmus, hail!&quot;). As the act ends, Semele is seen enjoying her role as the god&#x27;s new mistress (aria: &quot;Endless pleasure, endless love&quot;).

===Act 2===
&quot;Scene One&quot;

&quot;A pleasant country, the prospect terminated by a beautiful mountain adorn&#x27;d with woods and waterfalls. Juno and Iris descend in different machines. Juno in a chariot drawn by peacocks; Iris on a rainbow; they alight and meet.&quot;

Juno, suspicious of her husband&#x27;s conduct, has sent her helper Iris to find out what she can. Iris reports that Jove has installed Semele as his mistress in a palace atop a mountain (aria: &quot;There, from mortal cares retiring&quot;). The outraged Juno swears to have revenge (accompanied recitative: &quot;Awake, Saturnia, from thy lethargy!&quot;). Iris warns her it will not be an easy task—the palace is guarded by dragons that never sleep (accompanied recitative: &quot;With adamant the gates are barr&#x27;d&quot;). Juno decides that she and Iris will pay a visit to the god of sleep in his cave, in order to get magical assistance to put the dragons to sleep (aria: &quot;Hence, Iris, hence away&quot;).

&quot;Scene Two&quot;

&quot;An apartment in the palace of Semele. She is sleeping, Loves and Zephyrs waiting.&quot;

Semele awakes and regrets that the dream she was having of being with her lover has ended (aria: &quot;O sleep, why dost thou leave me?&quot;). When Jupiter enters, in the form of a young man, she tells him how difficult it is for her when he is absent. He explains that she is a mortal, unlike him, and needs to rest from their love-making from time to time. He attempts to assure her of his fidelity (aria: &quot;Lay your doubts and fears aside&quot;). Semele sings of her passionate love for him (aria: &quot;With fond desiring&quot;). The chorus of Loves and Zephyrs sing of lovers&#x27; joys (chorus: &quot;How engaging, how endearing&quot;). Semele, however, is beginning to be unhappy that her lover is a god and she a mere mortal. This sign of an ambition to immortality from Semele worries Jupiter who decides he must distract her from such thoughts (aria: &quot;I must with speed amuse her&quot;). The Loves and Zephyrs advise Semele to put aside worries and enjoy the delights of love while she can (chorus: &quot;Now Love that everlasting boy invites&quot;). Jupiter has arranged for Semele&#x27;s sister Ino to be magically transported to the palace, to keep her company, and promises that the gardens and environs will be paradise (aria: &quot;Where&#x27;er you walk&quot;). He leaves, and Ino appears, describing the wondrous experience of being flown there by winged zephyrs (aria: &quot;But hark, the heav&#x27;nly sphere turns round&quot;). The sisters sing of the joy they are experiencing, hearing the music of the spheres (duet: &quot;Prepare then, ye immortal choir&quot;) and nymphs and swains declare that this part of the earth has become a heaven (chorus: &quot;Bless the glad earth&quot;).

===Act 3===
&quot;Scene One&quot;

&quot;The Cave of Sleep. The God of Sleep lying on his bed.&quot;

Juno and Iris arrive and wake Somnus (accompanied recitative: &quot;Somnus, awake&quot;), to his displeasure (aria: &quot;Leave me, loathsome light&quot;). He only gets out of bed when he hears Juno mention the beautiful nymph Pasithea (aria: &quot;More sweet is that name&quot;). Juno promises he will have the nymph if he will lend her magical aid to put the dragons that guard the palace where Semele is ensconced as her husband&#x27;s mistress to sleep and transform her into the likeness of Semele&#x27;s sister Ino. Somnus agrees (duet: &quot;Obey my will&quot;).

&quot;Scene Two&quot;

&quot;An Apartment. Semele alone&quot;

Semele is still feeling rather unhappy about the discrepancy between herself and her lover (aria: &quot;My racking thoughts&quot;). Juno, in the form of Semele&#x27;s sister Ino, enters and feigns astonishment at Semele&#x27;s increased beauty. She exclaims that Semele must have become a goddess herself and gives her a mirror (&quot;Behold in this mirror&quot;). Semele is enraptured by her own beauty (aria: &quot;Myself I shall adore&quot;). &quot;Ino&quot; advises Semele to insist that Jupiter appear to her in his real, godlike form, and that will make her immortal herself (accompanied recitative: &quot;Conjure him by his oath&quot;). Semele is very grateful for this advice (aria: &quot;Thus let my thanks be paid&quot;). &quot;Ino&quot; leaves and Jupiter enters, eager to enjoy Semele (aria: &quot;Come to my arms, my lovely fair&quot;) but she puts him off (aria: &quot;I ever am granting&quot;). He swears to give her whatever she desires (accompanied recitative: &quot;By that tremendous flood, I swear&quot;) and she makes him promise to appear to her in his godlike form (accompanied recitative: &quot;Then cast off this human shape&quot;). He is alarmed and says that would harm her (aria: &quot;Ah, take heed what you press&quot;), but she insists he keep his oath (aria: &quot;No, no, I&#x27;ll take no less&quot;) and leaves. Jupiter knows this will mean her destruction and mourns her impending doom (accompanied recitative: &quot;Ah, whither is she gone&quot;). Juno triumphs in the success of her scheme (aria: &quot;Above measure is the pleasure&quot;).

&quot;Scene Three&quot;

&quot;The scene discovers Semele under a canopy, leaning pensively, while a mournful symphony is playing. She looks up and sees Jupiter descending in a cloud; flashes of lightning issue from either side, and thunder is heard grumbling in the air.&quot;

Semele, granted her wish to see Jupiter in his true godlike form, is consumed by his thunderbolts, and as she dies she regrets her own foolishness and ambition (accompanied recitative: &quot;Ah me! Too late I now repent&quot;). Watching this, the priests of Juno express their amazement (chorus: &quot;Oh, terror and astonishment!&quot;). Athamas is now glad to accept Ino as his bride (aria: &quot;Despair no more shall wound me&quot;). The god Apollo descends on a cloud and announces that the unborn child of Semele and Jupiter will arise from her ashes (accompanied recitative: &quot;Apollo comes, to relieve your care&quot;). The child will be Bacchus, god of wine and ecstasy, a god &quot;more mighty than love&quot;. All celebrate the fortunate outcome (chorus: &quot;Happy, happy shall we be&quot;).

==Musical features==

The pleasure-loving and vain Semele is aptly characterised through Handel&#x27;s music. The work contains one of Handel&#x27;s most famous arias, the lyrical &quot;Where&#x27;er you walk&quot; for the tenor, with words from Alexander Pope&#x27;s &quot;The Pastorals&quot;. Comedy is interwoven into the drama, notably in the scene in the cave of the god of sleep. The monumental chorus &quot;O terror! and astonishment&quot; after Semele&#x27;s death shows the influence of the earlier English composer Henry Purcell.

<text>Semele is an opera by John Eccles, written in about 1706 with a libretto by William Congreve drawing on the &quot;Semele&quot; myth from Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;. It forms part of the English opera tradition of Blow&#x27;s &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot;, but was never staged due to changes in popular taste at the time. Indeed, the opera remained unperformed until the mid twentieth century, eclipsed by George Frideric Handel&#x27;s 1744 secular oratorio of the same name, based on the same libretto.

==Roles==

==Argument==

In his introductory &#x27;argument&#x27;, Congreve briefly summarises the plot, explains why he has modified some of Ovid&#x27;s story, and then goes on to explain for the audience&#x27;s benefit the concept of musical recitative:
==Synopsis==

===Act I===
Semele is about to be married against her will to Prince Athamus, though she loves the god Jupiter. Jupiter&#x27;s thunder interrupts the ceremony, and Athamus finds himself left alone with Ino, Semele&#x27;s sister. Ino is professing her love for Athamus when Cadmus enters to announce that Semele has been carried off to heaven by Jupiter in the form of an eagle.

===Act 2===
Juno, jealous wife of Jupiter, has instructed her handmaid Iris to find out where Semele and her husband are. Iris says that they are in his palace, guarded by dragons. Within the palace, Jupiter and Semele sing of their mutual love but Semele is not satisfied, realising that as a mortal her happiness must be transitory. Jupiter attempts to divert her from such thoughts, and to provide entertainment arranges for Ino to visit her.

===Act 3===
Juno, accompanied by Iris, visit the god Somnus and asks to borrow his magic rod to charm the dragons. She gets Somnus to put Ino to sleep so that she can take her place. Disguised as Ino, Juno falsely tells Semele that she has the opportunity to become immortal if only she can persuade Jupiter to appear before her as he truly is, in his natural godly state. When Semele and Jupiter are alone, Semele first secures from him a vow that he will do whatever she asks, and then she demands that he appear as a god. Jupiter warns her of her folly but is unable to persuade her to change her mind. He carries out the vow, appearing with his most gentle fire and lightning, but is unable to save her from being destroyed. In the final scene, Ino marries Athamus and Apollo prophesies that Bacchus, the unborn child of Jupiter and Semele, will rise from Semele&#x27;s ashes.

==History==

Eccles probably completed the score of &quot;Semele&quot; in late 1706, basing his music on a libretto of 1705–6 by his close friend William Congreve. The opera may have been intended to open John Vanbrugh&#x27;s new Queen&#x27;s Theatre in The Haymarket in 1707, but that became impossible when the Lord Chancellor gave Vanbrugh&#x27;s competitor Christopher Rich at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane a monopoly on opera productions in London. Congreve and Eccles were forced to agree to a production at Drury Lane, but Rich never brought it to the stage. Congreve published his libretto in 1710, but Eccles&#x27;s music remained unheard, with popular fashion turning towards the Italianate style of &quot;opera seria&quot;. Congreve&#x27;s libretto was later re-used, in slightly amended form, by George Frideric Handel for his secular oratorio &quot;Semele&quot;.

Eccles&#x27; &quot;Semele&quot; forms part of the English opera tradition that had begun with Blow&#x27;s &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot; (c1683) and included Purcell&#x27;s &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot; (c. 1685–9). The non-performance of the opera in 1707 confirmed the end of this short-lived tradition. According to the &quot;New Grove Dictionary of Opera&quot;, &quot;Semele&quot; was &#x27;in every way superior&#x27; to the other operas that were being performed in London at the time. The lack of productions in later years may owe something to the fact that modern directors have found Handel&#x27;s setting of the same libretto so easy to turn into an opera.

==Performance==

The earliest known productions of Eccles&#x27; music were:
* Oxford, Wadham College Music Society and Oxford University Opera Club, conducted by John Byrt, 19 August 1964.
* St John&#x27;s, Smith Square, London, 22 April 1972.

On 26 November 2019 Cambridge Handel Opera Company, Academy of Ancient Music and Cambridge Early Music staged a concert performance in Trinity College, Cambridge, conducted by Julian Perkins. On 18 November 2023, American Baroque Opera performed &quot;Semele&quot; in Dallas.

==Recording==

There is a 2004 recording on CD by Florida State University Opera conducted by Anthony Rooley, and a 2019 recording (published in January 2021), by the Academy of Ancient Music in partnership with the Cambridge Handel Opera Company, directed by Julian Perkins.

<doc id="355844" wikidata="Q3521477" url="?curid=355844" title="The Killjoys (Australian band)">
<text>The Killjoys were an Australian pop, folk band formed in 1987. The mainstay members were Anna Burley on lead vocals and guitar and Craig Pilkington on lead guitar and vocals. They attracted a wide following in the vibrant pub scene. Their debut album, &quot;Ruby&quot; won the ARIA Award for Best Independent Release at the ARIA Music Awards of 1991.

== History ==
===1987-1989: Band beginnings and &quot;Audrey&quot;===
The Killjoys were formed in 1987 in Melbourne by Anna Burley on lead vocals and guitar (ex-Wild Science), Jeremy Craigie-Smith on bass guitar; Will Larsen on drums (ex-Michael Angelo and the Ceiling); Craig Pilkington on lead guitar, trumpet and vocals (ex-Wild Science) and Caroline Schwerkolt on vibraphone and keyboards. They were one of the promising bands, which emerged in the late 1980s including Sea Stories, the Fauves, the Hollowmen, the Glory Box, Ripe, Autohaze and Pray TV.

Prior to her time in Wild Science, Anna Burley did a stint in the Melbourne indie band, Blah Zero ... during the early part of the mid-1980s. Four songs were recorded at Richmond Recorders during that period, with Geof Rey Evans on guitar, Zoe Zurbo on bass and Larry Tidswell on drums. Tracks included Insecure, Eastern Zone and Russian Roulette.

Burley and Pilkington&#x27;s previous group, Wild Science, had split into two different outfits, the Killjoys and Violet Town. Violet Town&#x27;s other members were Wayne (Buz) Hissock on guitar and vocals, Warren Pitts on keyboards and vocals, Peter Van on drums, and Luke Blackburn on bass guitar and vocals. According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, the Killjoys&#x27; &quot;sound mixed appealing pop melodies and bittersweet folk harmonies with a jazzy edge.&quot;

In mid-February 1989 the group issued a five-track extended play, &quot;Audrey&quot;, as a mini-album and as a music cassette on their own label, Audrey – it was co-produced by the band with Peter Jackson. They launched the released in Canberra and &quot;The Canberra Times&quot;″ correspondent observed that &quot;the music of the Killjoys has been described as a light blend of jazz, folk and pop.&quot; The EP had been recorded in the previous Easter but its release was delayed as the group gathered funding for its pressing and distribution. The tracks were co-written by Burley and Pilkington. Their debut single, &quot;Fall Around Me&quot;, was released in November 1989. During 1990 they provided a cover version of the Seekers&#x27; 1964 single, &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Find Another You&quot;, for the tribute album, &quot;Used and Recovered&quot;.

===1990-1992: &quot;Ruby&quot; &amp; &quot;Spin&quot;===

In October 1990, The Killjoys released their debut studio album, &quot;Ruby&quot;, which was co-produced by Mark Woods and the group. AllMusic&#x27;s Stewart Mason opined that &quot;Burley has a cool, detached voice that sounds just right over [Pilkington]&#x27;s strummy acoustics and muted trumpet. [Schwerkolt]&#x27;s dreamy vibes are the group&#x27;s other main sonic signature, adding a lovely texture to nearly every song.&quot; At the ARIA Music Awards of 1991 &quot;Ruby&quot; won the ARIA Award for Best Independent Release. As the group celebrated on a Sydney ferry, Schwerkolt accidentally dropped the trophy into Darling Harbour. Burley explained &quot;She was really upset. She&#x27;d actually taken it off Craig because she thought he was too drunk. They hired a diver the next day... he couldn&#x27;t find anything.&quot;

The album provided a single, &quot;Michael Told Me&quot;. In November 1991 they released a four-track EP, &quot;Spin&quot;, which included &quot;Calling Me On&quot;. It was produced by Tony Espie. By that time Craigie-Smith had been replaced on bass guitar by Daniel Palamara (ex-Michael Angelo and the Ceiling) who, in turn, was replaced by Michael Hohnen. The group travelled to the United Kingdom, late in 1992, to record their second album.

===1993-1996: &quot;A Million Suns&quot; and line-up changes===
In March 1993, The Killjoys released their second studio album, &quot;A Million Suns&quot;, with Craig Leon. Burley detailed their choice of Leon, saying &quot;He had such a diverse range. He&#x27;d done so many interesting things. We wanted someone who was into what we were doing...&quot; Nic Haygarth of &quot;The Canberra Times&quot; felt that the album &quot;will go some way to shifting that &#x27;indie pop&#x27; label the band has been carrying. With Anna&#x27;s emotionally taut vocal, agreeable harmonies, and their classy songwriting, it&#x27;s hard to imagine too much going wrong.&quot; It provided two singles, &quot;Beauty + Danger&quot; and &quot;I Lied&quot;.

The band underwent line-up changes with Larsen replaced on drums in 1993 by Dave Folley (ex-the Somerfields); Hohnen was replaced by David Nelson on bass guitar and Schwerkolt left in 1995. Early in that year Gary Aspinall joined on guitar, mandolin and organ (ex-Odolites, the Somerfields).

===1997-2001: &quot;Sun Bright Deep&quot; &amp; &quot;Killjoys Retrospective&quot;===
In November 1997, The Killjoys released a single, &quot;Save Me&quot;, ahead of their third album, &quot;Sun Bright Deep&quot; which was released in March 1998. The album was co-produced by the group and Victor Van Vugt. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1998 the album was nominated for the ARIA Award for Best Adult Contemporary Album. Ed Nimmervoll caught their performance in February 1999 and he described how &quot;Standing barefoot in the centre of the Killjoys spotlight is Anna Burley, the embodiment of the Killjoys music, eyes closed, arms outstretched and emphasising the emotion in the music as she sings songs about relationships and human frailty in the purest of voices. Anna&#x27;s singing better than ever, the Killjoys are as good if not better than ever.&quot;

In 2001, a compilation album, &quot;Killjoys Retrospective&quot; was released.

===2006-present: &quot;Stealing Horses&quot; &amp; &quot;Pearl&quot;===
In 2006 the Killjoys released an album, &quot;Stealing Horses&quot;, the group&#x27;s first in seven years. They released their fifth studio album, &quot;Pearl&quot;, in 2011. It is considered somewhat of a sequel to the band&#x27;s iconic &quot;Ruby&quot; album, which was remastered and re-released alongside &quot;Pearl&quot;.

<doc id="355849" wikidata="Q912512" url="?curid=355849" title="Equal opportunity">
<text>Equal opportunity is a state of fairness in which individuals are treated similarly, unhampered by artificial barriers, prejudices, or preferences, except when particular distinctions can be explicitly justified. For example, the intent of equal employment opportunity is that the important jobs in an organization should go to the people who are most qualified – persons most likely to perform ably in a given task – and not go to persons for reasons deemed arbitrary or irrelevant, such as circumstances of birth, upbringing, having well-connected relatives or friends, religion, sex, ethnicity, race, caste, or involuntary personal attributes such as disability, age.

According to proponents of the concept, chances for advancement should be open to everybody without regard for wealth, status, or membership in a privileged group. The idea is to remove arbitrariness from the selection process and base it on some &quot;pre-agreed basis of fairness, with the assessment process being related to the type of position&quot; and emphasizing procedural and legal means. Individuals should succeed or fail based on their efforts and not extraneous circumstances such as having well-connected parents. It is opposed to nepotism and plays a role in whether a social structure is seen as legitimate.

The concept is applicable in areas of public life in which benefits are earned and received such as employment and education, although it can apply to many other areas as well. Equal opportunity is central to the concept of meritocracy.

There are two major types of equality: &quot;formal equality&quot;, the individual merit-based comparison of opportunity, and &quot;substantive equality&quot;, which moves away from individual merit-based comparison towards group equality of outcomes.

== Differing political viewpoints ==

People with differing political viewpoints often view the concept differently. The meaning of equal opportunity is debated in fields such as political philosophy, sociology and psychology. It is being applied to increasingly wider areas beyond employment, including lending, housing, college admissions, voting rights, and elsewhere. In the classical sense, equality of opportunity is closely aligned with the concept of equality before the law and ideas of meritocracy.

Generally, the terms &quot;equality of opportunity&quot; and &quot;equal opportunity&quot; are interchangeable, with occasional slight variations; the former has more of a sense of being an abstract political concept while &quot;equal opportunity&quot; is sometimes used as an adjective, usually in the context of employment regulations, to identify an employer, a hiring approach, or the law. Equal opportunity provisions have been written into regulations and have been debated in courtrooms. It is sometimes conceived as a legal right against discrimination. It is an ideal which has become increasingly widespread in Western nations during the last several centuries and is intertwined with social mobility, most often with upward mobility and with rags to riches stories: 

== Theory ==
=== Outline of the concept ===

According to the &quot;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot;, the concept assumes that society is stratified with a diverse range of roles, some of which are more desirable than others. The benefit of equality of opportunity is to bring fairness to the selection process for coveted roles in corporations, associations, nonprofits, universities and elsewhere. According to one view, there is no &quot;formal linking&quot; between equality of opportunity and political structure, in the sense that there can be equality of opportunity in democracies, autocracies and in communist nations, although it is primarily associated with a competitive market economy and embedded within the legal frameworks of democratic societies. People with different political perspectives see equality of opportunity differently: liberals disagree about which conditions are needed to ensure it and many &quot;old-style&quot; conservatives see inequality and hierarchy in general as beneficial out of a respect for tradition. It can apply to a specific hiring decision, or to all hiring decisions by a specific company, or rules governing hiring decisions for an entire nation. The scope of equal opportunity has expanded to cover more than issues regarding the rights of minority groups, but covers practices regarding &quot;recruitment, hiring, training, layoffs, discharge, recall, promotions, responsibility, wages, sick leave, vacation, overtime, insurance, retirement, pensions, and various other benefits&quot;.

The concept has been applied to numerous aspects of public life, including accessibility of polling stations, care provided to HIV patients, whether men and women have equal opportunities to travel on a spaceship, bilingual education, skin color of models in Brazil, television time for political candidates, army promotions, admittance to universities and ethnicity in the United States. The term is interrelated with and often contrasted with other conceptions of equality such as equality of outcome and equality of autonomy. Equal opportunity emphasizes the personal ambition and talent and abilities of the individual, rather than his or her qualities based on membership in a group, such as a social class or race or extended family. Further, it is seen as unfair if external factors that are viewed as being beyond the control of a person significantly influence what happens to him or her. Equal opportunity then emphasizes a fair process whereas in contrast equality of outcome emphasizes an equal outcome. In sociological analysis, equal opportunity is seen as a factor correlating positively with social mobility, in the sense that it can benefit society overall by maximizing well-being.

=== Different types ===
There are different concepts lumped under equality of opportunity.

Formal equality of opportunity describes equal opportunities based only on merit but these opportunities should not depend on your identity such as gender or race. Formal equality does not guarantee equal outcomes for groups or equal representation of groups, but requires that deliberate discrimination be only meritocratic. For instance, job interviews should only discriminate against applicants based on job competence. Meritocratic universities should not accept a less-capable applicant instead of a more-capable applicant who cannot pay tuition. Formal equality can be called racial color blindness and gender blindness.

Substantive equality describes equal outcomes for groups or equal representation of identities such as gender or race. Substantive does not guarantee equality of opportunity based only on merit. For instance, substantive equality includes that jobs are distributed according to the race and gender proportions of the whole population.

Equality before the law describes where the law does not discriminate explicitly based on protected identity such as gender or race. Equality before the law does not imply Formal equality of opportunity or substantive equality. If firing any pregnant employee is legal, it would meet Equality before the law but would violate both Formal equality of opportunity and substantive equality.

Formal equality of opportunity is often more difficult to measure. A political party that formally allows anyone to join, but meets in a non-wheelchair-accessible building far from public transit, substantively discriminates against both young and old members as they are less likely to be able-bodied car-owners. However, if the party raises membership dues in order to afford a better building, it discourages poor members instead. A workplace in which it is difficult for persons with special needs and disabilities to perform can considered as a type of substantive inequality, although job restructuring activities can be done to make it easier for disabled persons to succeed. Grade-cutoff university admission is formally fair, but if in practice it overwhelmingly picks women and graduates of expensive user-fee schools, it is substantively unfair to men and the poor. The unfairness has already taken place and the university can choose to try to counterbalance it, but it likely can not single-handedly make pre-university opportunities equal. Social mobility and the Great Gatsby curve are often used as an indicator of substantive equality of opportunity.

Both equality concepts say that it is unfair and inefficient if extraneous factors rule people&#x27;s lives. Both accept as fair inequality based on relevant, meritocratic factors. They differ in the scope of the methods used to promote them. The difference between the two equality concepts is also referred to as &quot;Dilemma of Difference&quot;. 

==== Formal equality of opportunity ====
Formal equality of opportunity is sometimes referred to as the nondiscrimination principle or described as the absence of direct discrimination, or described in the narrow sense as equality of access. It is characterized by:
# Open call. Positions bringing superior advantages should be open to all applicants and job openings should be publicized in advance giving applicants a &quot;reasonable opportunity&quot; to apply. Further, all applications should be accepted.
# Fair judging. Applications should be judged on their merits, with procedures designed to identify those best-qualified. The evaluation of the applicant should be in accord with the duties of the position and for the job opening of choir director, for example, the evaluation may judge applicants based on musical knowledge rather than some arbitrary criterion such as hair color. Blind auditions and blind interviews have been shown to improve equal opportunity.
# An application is chosen. The applicant judged as &quot;most qualified&quot; is offered the position while others are not. There is agreement that the result of the process is again unequal, in the sense that one person has the position while another does not, but that this outcome is deemed fair on procedural grounds.

The formal approach is limited to the public sphere as opposed to private areas such as the family, marriage, or religion. What is considered &quot;fair&quot; and &quot;unfair&quot; is spelled out in advance. An expression of this version appeared in &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;There should be an equal opportunity for all. Each and every person should have as great or as small an opportunity as the next one. There should not be the unfair, unequal, superior opportunity of one individual over another.&quot;
This sense was also expressed by economists Milton and Rose Friedman in their 1980 book &quot;Free to Choose&quot;. The Friedmans explained that equality of opportunity was &quot;not to be interpreted literally&quot; since some children are born blind while others are born sighted, but that &quot;its real meaning is ... a career open to the talents&quot;. This means that there should be &quot;no arbitrary obstacles&quot; blocking a person from realizing their ambitions: &quot;Not birth, nationality, color, religion, sex, nor any other irrelevant characteristic should determine the opportunities that are open to a person – only his abilities&quot;.

It is a relatively straightforward task for legislators to ban blatant efforts to favor one group over another and encourage equality of opportunity as a result. Japan banned gender-specific job descriptions in advertising as well as sexual discrimination in employment as well as other practices deemed unfair, although a subsequent report suggested that the law was having minimal effect in securing Japanese women high positions in management. In the United States, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sued a private test preparation firm, Kaplan, for unfairly using credit histories to discriminate against African Americans in terms of hiring decisions. According to one analysis, it is possible to imagine a democracy which meets the formal criteria (1 through 3), but which still favors wealthy candidates who are selected in free and fair elections.

===== Meritocracy =====

There is some overlap among these different conceptions with the term &quot;meritocracy&quot; which describes an administrative system which rewards such factors as individual intelligence, credentials, education, morality, knowledge or other criteria believed to confer merit. Equality of opportunity is often seen as a major aspect of a meritocracy. One view was that equality of opportunity was more focused on what happens before the race begins while meritocracy is more focused on fairness at the competition stage. The term &quot;meritocracy&quot; can also be used in a negative sense to refer to a system in which an elite hold themselves in power by controlling access to merit (via access to education, experience, or bias in assessment or judgment).

==== Substantive equality ====
Substantive equality of opportunity, sometimes called fair equality of opportunity, is a somewhat broader and more expansive concept than the more limiting formal equality of opportunity and it deals with what is sometimes described as indirect discrimination. It goes farther and is more controversial than the formal variant; and has been described as &quot;unstable&quot;, particularly if the society in question is unequal to begin with in terms of great disparity of wealth. 
The substantive equality embraced by Court of Justice of the European Union focuses on equality of outcomes for group characteristics and group outcomes.
Substantive equality has been identified as more of a left-leaning political position, but this is not a hard-and-fast rule. The substantive model is advocated by people who see limitations in formal equality. In the substantive approach, the starting point before the race begins is unfair since people have had differing experiences before even approaching the competition. The substantive approach examines the applicants themselves before applying for a position and judges whether they have equal abilities or talents; and if not, then it suggests that authorities (usually the government) take steps to make applicants more equal before they get to the point where they compete for a position and fixing the before-the-starting-point issues has sometimes been described as working towards &quot;fair access to qualifications&quot;. The success of this approach is evaluated by equality of outcome for disadvantaged and marginalized people and groups.

According to John Hills, children of wealthy and well-connected parents usually have a decisive advantage over other types of children and he notes that &quot;advantage and disadvantage reinforce themselves over the life cycle, and often on to the next generation&quot; so that successful parents pass along their wealth and education to succeeding generations, making it difficult for others to climb up a social ladder. However, so-called positive action efforts to bring an underprivileged person up to speed before a competition begins are limited to the period of time before the evaluation begins. At that point, the &quot;final selection for posts must be made according to the principle the best person for the job&quot;, that is, a less qualified applicant should not be chosen over a more qualified applicant. Regardless of the nuances, the overall idea is still to give children from less fortunate backgrounds more of a chance, or to achieve at the beginning what some theorists call equality of condition. Writer Ha-Joon Chang expressed this view: 
In a sense, substantive equality of opportunity moves the &quot;starting point&quot; further back in time. Sometimes it entails the use of affirmative action policies to help all contenders become equal before they get to the starting point, perhaps with greater training, or sometimes redistributing resources via restitution or taxation to make the contenders more equal. It holds that all who have a &quot;genuine opportunity to become qualified&quot; be given a chance to do so and it is sometimes based on a recognition that unfairness exists, hindering social mobility, combined with a sense that the unfairness should not exist or should be lessened in some manner. One example postulated was that a warrior society could provide special nutritional supplements to poor children, offer scholarships to military academies and dispatch &quot;warrior skills coaches&quot; to every village as a way to make opportunity substantively more fair. The idea is to give every ambitious and talented youth a chance to compete for prize positions regardless of their circumstances of birth.

The substantive approach tends to have a broader definition of extraneous circumstances which should be kept out of a hiring decision. One editorial writer suggested that among the many types of extraneous circumstances which should be kept out of hiring decisions was personal beauty, sometimes termed &quot;lookism&quot;: 

The substantive position was advocated by Bhikhu Parekh in 2000 in &quot;Rethinking Multiculturalism&quot;, in which he wrote that &quot;all citizens should enjoy equal opportunities to acquire the capacities and skills needed to function in society and to pursue their self-chosen goals equally effectively&quot; and that &quot;equalising measures are justified on grounds of justice as well as social integration and harmony&quot;.

Affirmative action programs usually fall under the substantive category. The idea is to help disadvantaged groups get back to a normal starting position after a long period of discrimination. The programs involve government action, sometimes with resources being transferred from an advantaged group to a disadvantaged one and these programs have been justified on the grounds that imposing quotas counterbalances the past discrimination as well as being a &quot;compelling state interest&quot; in diversity in society. For example, there was a case in São Paulo in Brazil of a quota imposed on the São Paulo Fashion Week to require that &quot;at least 10 percent of the models to be black or indigenous&quot; as a coercive measure to counteract a &quot;longstanding bias towards white models&quot;. It does not have to be accomplished via government action: for example, in the 1980s in the United States, President Ronald Reagan dismantled parts of affirmative action, but one report in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; suggested that companies remained committed to the principle of equal opportunity regardless of government requirements. In another instance, upper-middle-class students taking the Scholastic Aptitude Test in the United States performed better since they had had more &quot;economic and educational resources to prepare for these test than others&quot;. The test itself was seen as fair in a formal sense, but the overall result is seen as unfair in a substantive sense. In India, the Indian Institutes of Technology found that to achieve substantive equality of opportunity the school had to reserve 22.5 percent of seats for applicants from &quot;historically disadvantaged schedule castes and tribes&quot;. Elite universities in France began a special &quot;entrance program&quot; to help applicants from &quot;impoverished suburbs&quot;.

=====Luck egalitarianism=====
Luck egalitarianism views the unequal outcomes that are connected to bad luck of unchosen circumstances as unjust, but just if when connected to circumstances chosen by the individual and that weighing matters such as personal responsibility was important. A somewhat different view was expressed by John Roemer, who used the term &quot;nondiscrimination principle&quot; to mean that &quot;all individuals who possess the attributes relevant for the performance of the duties of the position in question be included in the pool of eligible candidates, and that an individual&#x27;s possible occupancy of the position be judged only with respect to those relevant attributes&quot;. Matt Cavanagh argued that race and sex should not matter when getting a job, but that the sense of equality of opportunity should not extend much further than preventing straightforward discrimination. 

===== Equality of fair opportunity =====
Philosopher John Rawls offered this variant of substantive equality of opportunity and explained that it happens when individuals with the same &quot;native talent and the same ambition&quot; have the same prospects of success in competitions. Gordon Marshall offers a similar view with the words &quot;positions are to be open to all under conditions in which persons of similar abilities have equal access to office&quot;. An example was given that if two persons X and Y have identical talent, but X is from a poor family while Y is from a rich one, then equality of fair opportunity is in effect when both X and Y have the same chance of winning the job. It suggests the ideal society is &quot;classless&quot; without a social hierarchy being passed from generation to generation, although parents can still pass along advantages to their children by genetics and socialization skills. One view suggests that this approach might advocate &quot;invasive interference in family life&quot;. Marshall posed this question: 

Economist Paul Krugman agrees mostly with the Rawlsian approach in that he would like to &quot;create the society each of us would want if we didn&#x27;t know in advance who we&#x27;d be&quot;. Krugman elaborated: &quot;If you admit that life is unfair, and that there&#x27;s only so much you can do about that at the starting line, then you can try to ameliorate the consequences of that unfairness&quot;.

===== Level playing field =====

Some theorists have posed a level playing field conception of equality of opportunity, similar in many respects to the substantive principle (although it has been used in different contexts to describe formal equality of opportunity) and it is a core idea regarding the subject of distributive justice espoused by John Roemer and Ronald Dworkin and others. Like the substantive notion, the level playing field conception goes farther than the usual formal approach. The idea is that initial &quot;unchosen inequalities&quot; – prior circumstances over which an individual had no control, but which impact his or her success in a given competition for a particular post – these unchosen inequalities should be eliminated as much as possible, according to this conception. According to Roemer, society should &quot;do what it can to level the playing field so that all those with relevant potential will eventually be admissible to pools of candidates competing for positions&quot;. Afterwards, when an individual competes for a specific post, he or she might make specific choices which cause future inequalities – and these inequalities are deemed acceptable because of the previous presumption of fairness. This system helps undergird the legitimacy of a society&#x27;s divvying up of roles as a result in the sense that it makes certain achieved inequalities &quot;morally acceptable&quot;, according to persons who advocate this approach. This conception has been contrasted to the substantive version among some thinkers and it usually has ramifications for how society treats young persons in such areas as education and socialization and health care, but this conception has been criticized as well. John Rawls postulated the difference principle which argued that &quot;inequalities are justified only if needed to improve the lot of the worst off, for example by giving the talented an incentive to create wealth&quot;.

=== Moral senses ===
There is general agreement that equality of opportunity is good for society, although there are diverse views about how it is good since it is a value judgement. It is generally viewed as a positive political ideal in the abstract sense. In nations where equality of opportunity is absent, it can negatively impact economic growth, according to some views and one report in Al Jazeera suggested that Egypt, Tunisia and other Middle Eastern nations were stagnating economically in part because of a dearth of equal opportunity.

== Practical considerations ==
=== Difficulties with implementation ===
There is general agreement that programs to bring about certain types of equality of opportunity can be difficult and that efforts to cause one result often have unintended consequences or cause other problems.

A government policy that requires equal treatment can pose problems for lawmakers. A requirement for the government to provide equal health care services for all citizens can be prohibitively expensive. If the government seeks equality of opportunity for citizens to get health care by rationing services using a maximization model to try to save money, new difficulties might emerge. For example, trying to ration health care by maximizing the &quot;quality-adjusted years of life&quot; might steer monies away from disabled persons even though they may be more deserving, according to one analysis. In another instance, BBC News questioned whether it was wise to ask female army recruits to undergo the same strenuous tests as their male counterparts since many women were being injured as a result.

Age discrimination can present vexing challenges for policymakers trying to implement equal opportunity. According to several studies, attempts to be equally fair to both a young and an old person are problematic because the older person has presumably fewer years left to live and it may make more sense for a society to invest greater resources in a younger person&#x27;s health. Treating both persons equally while following the letter of the equality of opportunity seems unfair from a different perspective.

Efforts to achieve equal opportunity along one dimension can exacerbate unfairness in other dimensions. For example, public bathrooms: If for the sake of fairness the physical area of men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s bathrooms is equal, the overall result may be unfair since men can use urinals, which require less physical space. In other words, a more fair arrangement may be to allot more physical space for women&#x27;s restrooms. The sociologist Harvey Molotch explained: &quot;By creating men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s rooms of the same size, society guarantees that individual women will be worse off than individual men.&quot;

Another difficulty is that it is hard for a society to bring substantive equality of opportunity to every type of position or industry. If a nation focuses efforts on some industries or positions, then people with other talents may be left out. For example, in an example in the &quot;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot;, a warrior society might provide equal opportunity for all kinds of people to achieve military success through fair competition, but people with non-military skills such as farming may be left out.

Lawmakers have run into problems trying to implement equality of opportunity. In 2010 in Britain, a legal requirement &quot;forcing public bodies to try to reduce inequalities caused by class disadvantage&quot; was scrapped after much debate and replaced by a hope that organizations would try to focus more on &quot;fairness&quot; than &quot;equality&quot; as fairness is generally seen as a much unclear concept than equality, but easier for politicians to manage if they are seeking to avoid fractious debate. In New York City, mayor Ed Koch tried to find ways to maintain the &quot;principle of equal treatment&quot; while arguing against more substantive and abrupt transfer payments called minority set-asides.

Cultural diversity of lifestyles, value systems, traditions, and beliefs can explain differences in outcomes between subgroups.

=== Measures ===
Many economists measure the degree of equal opportunity with measures of economic mobility. For instance, Joseph Stiglitz asserts that with five economic divisions and full equality of opportunity, &quot;20 percent of those in the bottom fifth would see their children in the bottom fifth. Denmark almost achieves that – 25 percent are stuck there. Britain, supposedly notorious for its class divisions, does only a little worse (30 percent). That means they have a 70 percent chance of moving up. The chances of moving up in America, though, are markedly smaller (only 58 percent of children born to the bottom group make it out), and when they do move up, they tend to move up only a little&quot;. Similar analyses can be performed for each economic division and overall. They all show how far from the ideal all industrialized nations are and how correlated measures of equal opportunity are with income inequality and wealth inequality. Equal opportunity has ramifications beyond income; the American Human Development Index, rooted in the capabilities approach pioneered by Amartya Sen, is used to measure opportunity across geographies in the U.S. using health, education, and standard of living outcomes.
==== Difficulties with measurement ====
The consensus view is that trying to measure equality of opportunity is difficult whether examining a single hiring decision or looking at groups over time.
* Single instance. It is possible to reexamine the procedures governing a specific hiring decision, see if they were followed, and re-evaluate the selection by asking questions such as &quot;Was it fair? Were fair procedures followed? Was the best applicant selected?&quot;. This is a judgment call and biases may enter into the minds of decision-makers. The determination of equality of opportunity in such an instance is based on mathematical probability: if equality of opportunity is in effect, then it is seen as fair if each of two applicants has a 50 percent chance of winning the job, that is, they both have equal chances to succeed (assuming of course that the person making the probability assessment is unaware of all variables – including valid ones such as talent or skill as well as arbitrary ones such as race or gender). However, it is hard to measure whether each applicant had a 50 percent chance based on the outcome.
* Groups. When assessing the equal opportunity for a type of job or company or industry or nation, then statistical analysis is often done by looking at patterns and abnormalities, typically comparing subgroups with larger groups on a percentage basis. Averaging opportunities over subgroups allows to determine if there are statistically significant differences in outcomes between subgroups. For factors where blinded experiments are feasible, the equality or lack of equality of opportunity due to this factor can be determined up to statistical significance. While substantive equality for group outcomes can be measured by comparing statistically significant differences in subgroup outcomes, formal equality of opportunities does not require equal outcomes between groups. If equality of opportunity is violated, perhaps by discrimination which affects a subgroup or population over time, it is possible to make this determination using statistical analysis, but there are numerous difficulties involved. Nevertheless, entities such as city governments and universities have hired full-time professionals with knowledge of statistics to ensure compliance with equal opportunity regulations. For example, Colorado State University requires the director of its Office of Equal Opportunity to maintain extensive statistics on its employees by job category as well as minorities and gender. In Britain, Aberystwyth University collects information including the &quot;representation of women, men, members of racial or ethnic minorities and people with disabilities amongst applicants for posts, candidates interviewed, new appointments, current staff, promotions and holders of discretionary awards&quot; to comply with equal opportunity laws.

It is difficult to prove unequal treatment although statistical analysis can provide indications of problems, it is subject to conflicts over interpretation and methodological issues. For example, a study in 2007 by the University of Washington examined its treatment of women. Researchers collected statistics about female participation in numerous aspects of university life, including percentages of women with full professorships (23 percent), enrollment in programs such as nursing (90 percent), engineering (18 percent). There is wide variation in how these statistics might be interpreted. For example, the 23 percent figure for women with full professorships could be compared to the total population of women (presumably 50 percent) perhaps using census data, or it might be compared to the percentage of women with full professorships at competing universities. It might be used in an analysis of how many women applied for the position of full professor compared to how many women attained this position. Further, the 23 percent figure could be used as a benchmark or baseline figure as part of an ongoing longitudinal analysis to be compared with future surveys to track progress over time. In addition, the strength of the conclusions is subject to statistical issues such as sample size and bias. For reasons such as these, there is considerable difficulty with most forms of statistical interpretation.
Statistical analysis of equal opportunity has been done using sophisticated examinations of computer databases. An analysis in 2011 by University of Chicago researcher Stefano Allesina examined 61,000 names of Italian professors by looking at the &quot;frequency of last names&quot;, doing one million random drawings and he suggested that Italian academia was characterized by violations of equal opportunity practices as a result of these investigations. The last names of Italian professors tended to be similar more often than predicted by random chance. The study suggested that newspaper accounts showing that &quot;nine relatives from three generations of a single-family (were) on the economics faculty&quot; at the University of Bari were not aberrations, but indicated a pattern of nepotism throughout Italian academia.

Substative equality is typically measured by the criteria of equality of outcome for groups, although with difficulty. In one example, an analysis of relative equality of opportunity was done based on outcomes, such as a case to see whether hiring decisions were fair regarding men versus women – the analysis was done using statistics based on average salaries for different groups. In another instance, a cross-sectional statistical analysis was conducted to see whether social class affected participation in the United States Armed Forces during the Vietnam War: a report in &quot;Time&quot; by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology suggested that soldiers came from a variety of social classes and that the principle of equal opportunity had worked, possibly because soldiers had been chosen by a lottery process for conscription. In college admissions, equality of outcome can be measured directly by comparing offers of admission given to different groups of applicants: for example, there have been reports in newspapers of discrimination against Asian Americans regarding college admissions in the United States which suggest that Asian American applicants need higher grades and test scores to win admission to prestigious universities than other ethnic groups.

=== Marketplace considerations ===
Equal opportunity of opportunity has been described as a fundamental basic notion in business and commerce and described by economist Adam Smith as a basic economic precept. There has been research suggesting that &quot;competitive markets will tend to drive out such discrimination&quot; since employers or institutions which hire based on arbitrary criteria will be weaker as a result and not perform as well as firms that embrace equality of opportunity. Firms competing for overseas contracts have sometimes argued in the press for equal chances during the bidding process, such as when American oil corporations wanted equal shots at developing oil fields in Sumatra; and firms, seeing how fairness is beneficial while competing for contracts, can apply the lesson to other areas such as internal hiring and promotion decisions. A report in &quot;USA Today&quot; suggested that the goal of equal opportunity was &quot;being achieved throughout most of the business and government labor markets because major employers pay based on potential and actual productivity&quot;.

Fair opportunity practices include measures taken by an organization to ensure efficiency effectiveness and fairness in the employment process. A basic definition of equality is the idea of equal treatment and respect. In job advertisements and descriptions, the fact that the employer is an equal opportunity employer is sometimes indicated by the abbreviations EOE or MFDV, which stands for Minority, Female, Disabled, Veteran. Analyst Ross Douthat in &quot;The New York Times&quot; suggested that equality of opportunity depends on a rising economy which brings new chances for upward mobility and he suggested that greater equality of opportunity is more easily achieved during &quot;times of plenty&quot;. Efforts to achieve equal opportunity can rise and recede, sometimes as a result of economic conditions or political choices. Empirical evidence from public health research also suggests that equality of opportunity is linked to better health outcomes in the United States and Europe.

=== History ===
According to professor David Christian of Macquarie University, an underlying Big History trend has been a shift from seeing people as resources to exploiting towards a perspective of seeing people as individuals to empower. According to Christian, in many ancient agrarian civilizations, roughly nine of every ten persons was a peasant exploited by a ruling class. In the past thousand years, there has been a gradual movement in the direction of greater respect for equal opportunity as political structures based on generational hierarchies and feudalism broke down during the late Middle Ages and new structures emerged during the Renaissance. Monarchies were replaced by democracies: kings were replaced by parliaments and congresses. Slavery was also abolished generally. The new entity of the nation state emerged with highly specialized parts, including corporations, laws, and new ideas about citizenship as well as values about individual rights found expression in constitutions, laws, and statutes.
In the United States, one legal analyst suggested that the real beginning of the modern sense of equal opportunity was in the Fourteenth Amendment which provided &quot;equal protection under the law&quot;. The amendment did not mention equal opportunity directly, but it helped undergird a series of later rulings which dealt with legal struggles, particularly by African Americans and later women, seeking greater political and economic power in the growing republic. In 1933, a congressional &quot;Unemployment Relief Act&quot; forbade discrimination &quot;based on race, color, or creed&quot;. The Supreme Court&#x27;s 1954 &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; decision furthered government initiatives to end discrimination.

In 1961, President John F. Kennedy signed Executive Order 10925 which enabled a presidential committee on an equal opportunity, which was soon followed by President Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s Executive Order 11246. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 became the legal underpinning of equal opportunity in employment. Businesses and other organizations learned to comply with the rulings by specifying fair hiring and promoting practices and posting these policy notices on bulletin boards, employee handbooks, and manuals as well ain s training sessions and films. Courts dealt with issues about equal opportunities, such as the 1989 Wards Cove decision, the Supreme Court ruled that statistical evidence by itself was insufficient to prove racial discrimination. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission was established, sometimes reviewing charges of discrimination cases which numbered in the tens of thousands annually during the 1990s. Some law practices specialized in employment law. The conflict between formal and substantive approaches manifested itself in backlashes, sometimes described as reverse discrimination, such as the Bakke case when a white male applicant to medical school sued based on being denied admission because of a quota system preferring minority applicants. In 1990, the Americans with Disabilities Act prohibited discrimination against disabled persons, including cases of equal opportunity. In 2008, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act prevents employers from using genetic information when hiring, firing, or promoting employees.
Many countries have specific bodies tasked with looking at equality of opportunity issues. In the United States, for example, it is the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission; in Britain, there is the Equality of Opportunity Committee as well as the Equality and Human Rights Commission; in Canada, the Royal Commission on the Status of Women has &quot;equal opportunity as its precept&quot;; and in China, the Equal Opportunities Commission handles matters regarding ethnic prejudice. In addition, there have been political movements pushing for equal treatment, such as the Women&#x27;s Equal Opportunity League which in the early decades of the twentieth century, pushed for fair treatment by employers in the United States. One of the group&#x27;s members explained: Global initiatives such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 5 and Goal 10 are also aimed at ensuring equal opportunities for women at all levels of decision making, and reducing inequalities of outcome.

== Criticism ==
There is agreement that the concept of equal opportunity lacks a precise definition. While it generally describes &quot;open and fair competition&quot; with equal chances for achieving sought-after jobs or positions as well as an absence of discrimination, the concept is elusive with a &quot;wide range of meanings&quot;. Formal equality is hard to measure, and implementation of substantive equality poses problems as well as disagreements about what to do.

There have been various criticisms directed at both the substantive and formal approaches. One account suggests that left-leaning thinkers who advocate equality of outcome fault even formal equality of opportunity because it &quot;legitimates inequalities of wealth and income&quot;. John W. Gardner suggested several views: (1) that inequalities will always exist regardless of trying to erase them; (2) that bringing everyone &quot;fairly to the starting line&quot; fails to deal with the &quot;destructive competitiveness that follows&quot;; (3) that any equalities achieved will entail future inequalities. Substantive equality of opportunity has led to concerns that efforts to improve fairness &quot;ultimately collapses into the different one of equality of outcome or condition&quot;.

Economist Larry Summers advocated an approach of focusing on equality of opportunity and not equality of outcomes and that the way to strengthen equal opportunity was to bolster public education. A contrasting report in &quot;The Economist&quot; criticized efforts to contrast equality of opportunity and equality of outcome as being opposite poles on a hypothetical ethical scale, such that equality of opportunity should be the &quot;highest ideal&quot; while equality of outcome was &quot;evil&quot;. Rather, the report argued that any difference between the two types of equality was illusory and that both terms were highly interconnected. According to this argument, wealthier people have greater opportunities – wealth itself can be considered as &quot;distilled opportunity&quot; – and children of wealthier parents have access to better schools, health care, nutrition and so forth. Accordingly, people who endorse equality of opportunity may like the idea of it in principle, yet at the same time, they would be unwilling to take the extreme steps or &quot;titanic interventions&quot; necessary to achieve real intergenerational equality. A slightly different view in &quot;The Guardian&quot; suggested that equality of opportunity was merely a &quot;buzzword&quot; to sidestep the thornier political question of income inequality.

There is speculation that since equality of opportunity is only one of sometimes competing &quot;justice norms&quot;, there is a risk that following equality of opportunity too strictly might cause problems in other areas. A hypothetical example was suggested: suppose wealthier people gave excessive amounts of campaign contributions; suppose further that these contributions resulted in better regulations, and then laws limiting such contributions based on equal opportunity for all political participants may have the unintended long term consequence of making political decision-making lackluster and possibly hurting the groups that it was trying to protect. Philosopher John Kekes makes a similar point in his book &quot;The Art of Politics&quot; in which he suggests that there is a danger to elevating any one particular political good – including equality of opportunity – without balancing competing goods such as justice, property rights and others. Kekes advocated having a balanced perspective, including a continuing dialog between cautionary elements and reform elements. A similar view was expressed by Ronald Dworkin in &quot;The Economist&quot;: 

Economist Paul Krugman sees equality of opportunity as a &quot;non-Utopian compromise&quot; which works and is a &quot;pretty decent arrangement&quot; which varies from country to country. However, there are differing views such as by Matt Cavanagh, who criticised equality of opportunity in his 2002 book &quot;Against Equality of Opportunity&quot;. Cavanagh favored a limited approach of opposing specific kinds of discrimination as steps to help people get greater control over their lives.

Conservative thinker Dinesh D&#x27;Souza criticized equality of opportunity on the basis that &quot;it is an ideal that cannot and should not be realized through the actions of the government&quot; and added that &quot;for the state to enforce equal opportunity would be to contravene the true meaning of the Declaration and to subvert the principle of a free society&quot;. D&#x27;Souza described how his parenting undermined equality of opportunity: 
D&#x27;Souza argued that it was wrong for the government to try to bring his daughter down, or to force him to raise other people&#x27;s children, but a counterargument is that there is a benefit to everybody, including D&#x27;Souza&#x27;s daughter, to have a society with less anxiety about downward mobility, less class resentment, and less possible violence.

An argument similar to D&#x27;Souza&#x27;s was raised in &quot;Anarchy, State, and Utopia&quot; by Robert Nozick, who wrote that the only way to achieve equality of opportunity was &quot;directly worsening the situations of those more favored with opportunity, or by improving the situation of those less well-favored&quot;. Nozick gave an argument of two suitors competing to marry one &quot;fair lady&quot;: X was plain while Y was better looking and more intelligent. If Y did not exist, then &quot;fair lady&quot; would have married X, but Y exists and so she marries Y. Nozick asks: &quot;Does suitor X have a legitimate complaint against Y based on unfairness since Y did not earn his good looks or intelligence?&quot;. Nozick suggests that there are no grounds for complaint. Nozick argued against equality of opportunity because it violates the rights of property since the equal opportunity maxim interferes with an owner&#x27;s right to do what he or she pleases with a property.

Property rights were a major component of the philosophy of John Locke and are sometimes referred to as &quot;Lockean rights&quot;. The sense of the argument is along these lines: equal opportunity rules regarding, say, a hiring decision within a factory, made to bring about greater fairness, violate a factory owner&#x27;s rights to run the factory as he or she sees best; it has been argued that a factory owner&#x27;s right to property encompasses all decision-making within the factory as being part of those property rights. That some people&#x27;s &quot;natural assets&quot; were unearned is irrelevant to the equation according to Nozick and he argued that people are nevertheless entitled to enjoy these assets and other things freely given by others.

Friedrich Hayek felt that luck was too much of a variable in economics, such that one can not devise a system with any kind of fairness when many market outcomes are unintended. By sheer chance or random circumstances, a person may become wealthy just by being in the right place and time and Hayek argued that it is impossible to devise a system to make opportunities equal without knowing how such interactions may play out. Hayek saw not only equality of opportunity, but all of social justice as a &quot;mirage&quot;.

Some conceptions of equality of opportunity, particularly the substantive and level playing field variants, have been criticized on the basis that they make assumptions to the effect that people have similar genetic makeups. Other critics have suggested that social justice is more complex than mere equality of opportunity. Nozick made the point that what happens in society can not always be reduced to competition for a coveted position and in 1974 wrote that &quot;life is not a race in which we all compete for a prize which someone has established&quot;, that there is &quot;no unified race&quot; and there is not someone person &quot;judging swiftness&quot;.

<text>The Stridsvagn 103 (Strv 103), also known as the Alternative S and S-tank, is a Swedish Cold War-era main battle tank, designed and manufactured in Sweden. &quot;Strv&quot; is the Swedish military abbreviation of &quot;stridsvagn&quot;, Swedish for tank (literally &quot;combat wagon&quot;, it also is the Swedish word for chariot), while the &quot;103&quot; comes from being the third tank in Swedish service to be equipped with a 10.5 cm gun.

Developed in the 1950s, it was the first main battle tank to use a gas turbine engine and the only mass-produced tank since World War II to not use a turret besides the German Kanonenjagdpanzer, which is not classified as a tank by role, but by design. It has an unconventional design with a unique gun laying process: it is turretless with a fixed gun traversed by engaging the tracks and elevated by adjusting the hull suspension. The result was a very low-profile design with an emphasis on survivability and heightened crew protection level.

Strv 103s formed a major portion of the Swedish armoured forces from the 1960s to the 1990s, when, along with the Centurions, it was replaced by the Leopard 2 variants Stridsvagn 121 and Stridsvagn 122.

While most turretless armoured fighting vehicles are classified as assault guns or tank destroyers, the Strv 103 is considered a tank since its designated combat role matched those of other tanks within contemporary Swedish doctrine.

== History ==
===Concept development===
In the early 1950s, the Royal Swedish Army Materiel Administration&#x27;s Ordnance Department began development of a new tank known as kranvagn, or KRV. The desired features were a weight around 30 tonnes with high gun performance, protection and mobility. The new design emerged with a very low-profile hull with a tall and highly angled turret mounting a large-calibre main gun and autoloader system, reducing the crew to three. 105 to 120 mm guns were initially considered, with the 120 being favoured, and later a 155 mm design was also considered. The overall design is very similar to the French AMX-50.

Around this same time, they also approached the United Kingdom about purchasing the Centurion tank. The Centurion included a gun stabilizer, much better mobility, and a number of other features that made it much more advanced than the KRV. Although the British proved interested, they stated that deliveries could not begin until the 1955 or 56 time-frame, after their own needs were filled. Then, in 1953, due in part to a need for increased foreign currency, the UK offered to deliver the Centurion immediately. This offer was taken up, and KRV work continued only to produce two hulls for study.

While the Centurion was a great advance on the KRV, it was still considered much heavier than ideal given its firepower. In the mid-1950s, the Royal Swedish Army Materiel Administration&#x27;s Ordnance Department put out a contract to find a replacement. Two working groups were formed to consider different approaches. &quot;Alternative A&quot; (for &quot;Anglo-American&quot;) was to purchase a design from either the British or Americans of roughly 50 tons but mounting a more powerful gun than the Ordnance QF 20-pounder of the existing Centurions. &quot;Alternative T&quot; (&quot;Tysk-Fransk&quot;, or &quot;German-French&quot;) was for a lighter tank of around 30 tons with less protection but better mobility. In 1956, Sven Berge of the Swedish Arms Administration proposed &quot;Alternative S&quot; (&quot;S&quot; standing for &quot;Swedish&quot;), a radically different solution.

===Alternative S===
As part of the Centurion purchase, the UK had supplied volumes of data from World War II and Korean War tank engagements. These demonstrated that a full half of all &quot;kills&quot; were due to hits on the turret or the turret ring. Hits on the lower portion of the tank were much more rare. These statistics also suggested that the chance of being hit was strongly related to the overall height of the tank.

In 1943, Berge had read reports of the 1940 French Char B1 design. This featured a large (for the era) gun in the hull that was fixed in azimuth, and required the entire tank to turn to aim it. This was accomplished through the use of a complex transmission system under the gunner&#x27;s control. Berge had also been part of the teams that examined German vehicles after the war, and was aware of the ability for short vehicles to quickly maneuver.

Berge combined these concepts for the S proposal. The suspension would be connected to a stabilizer from Bofors that would keep the entire tank stabilized as opposed to just the gun. He felt the stabilizers of the era did not offer the performance needed for real fire-on-the-move; while a first shot may be made on the move, the tanks generally stopped for follow-up shots. He felt that the advantage offered was limited, and that better protection when stopped would be more useful.

The resulting chassis was quite small, with only four road wheels, and the gun extended through the vehicle to the rear where the autoloader and ammunition was stored outside of the crew compartment. The resulting 30 ton design offered the same level of armour as the heavy tanks, but was better protected overall due to the external ammunition and very low profile.

===Prototypes===

A spring 1957 meeting to consider the various designs resulted in &quot;S&quot; raising enough interest that a demonstration of its design features was needed. A small contract was let to demonstrate that the suspension system could be used for aiming. This led to experiments using a surplus M4 Sherman and Infanterikanonvagn 103 vehicles fit with external systems that moved the suspension. These seemed promising, so one of the test hulls from the earlier KRV program was adapted for more rigorous testing and the first application of the stabilizer. This was later modified to remove the first and sixth road wheels to a make a layout more similar to the S proposal.

As part of the &quot;Försvarsbeslut 1958&quot; (defence plan of 1958) deliberations, the Riksdagen (Swedish parliament) debated the three Alternatives. S would be the most expensive, but it was ultimately selected for the symbolic value of a domestic tank in a neutral country as well as the spin-off effects on Swedish industrial competence. On 4 February 1958, a contract was released for two prototype hulls, S1 and S2. Volvo was selected to build the engine system and AB Landsverk the drive trains. S1 used an electric motor for power, supplied by a generator trailer, and was used to test the suspension system. S2 included the Volvo-designed Diesel-turbine hybrid engine and was used to test the drivetrain and flotation system. These were also successful, and in 1960 an order was placed for ten pre-production vehicles.

By this time, the UK had offered the latest Centurion Mk. 10, which featured the famed Royal Ordnance L7 105 mm gun. The gun had been licensed for production in Sweden and would be available shortly, so the decision was made to replace the much larger guns originally conceived with the 105 in order to save development costs. For the S, it was lengthened to L/62 from the original L/52 to allow more powerful charges to be used. Because the gun was fixed in place, with no recoil movement, the autoloader was able to reach the very high rate of firing every three seconds. This led to the production design being given the name &quot;Stridsvagn 103&quot;, meaning the third design mounting a 10 cm gun.

The first of these &quot;zero series&quot; vehicles arrived in 1963. During testing, it was noticed that while a two-man crew could operate the vehicle successfully, other tasks became more difficult. Notably, it made operating in the field more difficult because a two-man crew was not enough to perform guard duty or easily perform track maintenance or reloading ammunition. The decision was made to add a third member, assigning them to operate the radios as well as having a second set of controls and vision systems to allow them to drive the tank in reverse at high speed.

The vehicle was first shown to the public in the spring of 1963. It was an immediate worldwide sensation. John F Kennedy expressed an interest in the design, leading to a memo by Robert S McNamara noting:

===Into production===
The zero-series success led to a fall 1964 production order for 70 examples. The first production examples began to arrive in 1967. These demonstrated that the original Boeing T50 turbine was underpowered, and a new design from Caterpillar was introduced for the second production batch, the 220 S103B models, which began to arrive in 1970. These engines were retrofit to the earlier examples as well. The production of 290 production models was complete by 1971.

===Later updates===
Plans during the 1970s called for new tanks to be introduced in the 1980s, but these were later pushed back to the 1990s. This led to a round of improvements for the S103&#x27;s in service, producing the S103C. The changes were to replace the Rolls-Royce K60 with the Detroit Diesel Series 92, new tracks from Diehl Aerospace, external fuel tanks along the sides of the vehicle, a laser rangefinder, and the addition of the dozer blades to all of the tanks, instead of every third vehicle. Conversions began in 1986 and were complete by 1988.

There was some development of a S103D model carried out in the 1990s. Yet another turbine was used, along with a nuclear biological chemical filter system, a new ballistic calculator able to fire on moving targets, a muzzle reference system, better damping of the suspension, improved frontal armor and a separate stabilizer for the commander&#x27;s machine gun. By this time the newer foreign tanks were selected for purchase and the D-series modifications were not carried out.

== Design ==

Studies of casualty reports from World War II and the Korean War revealed that the risk of being hit in combat was strongly related to height, with more than half of tank losses being the result of the turret being penetrated. Berge therefore concluded that any new design should be as low as possible. The radical solution was to eliminate the turret, which would also dispose of a vulnerable target area and make the tank much lighter. In terms of absolute height, the final design did not give the Strv 103 any significant advantage over its most likely opponent, the T-62. The latter was just slightly taller with in height with its turret versus the of the Strv 103. On the other hand, the Swedish Centurions towered over both with their – in height. However, the T-62 paid for its low profile with an extremely cramped interior and lack of gun depression. Tanks are often deployed in hull-down firing positions, either behind dug entrenchments or using the crest of a hill, in order to reduce the exposure of the vehicle to enemy fire. In this firing position, the level of exposure is determined by the distance between the bottom of the gun barrel and the top of the turret or vehicle, and the angle to which the vehicle is able to depress the gun barrel. Since the Strv 103 orients the entire tank to depress and elevate the barrel, in a hull down position it has very little apparent height and subsequent visual profile to the enemy. It could also lower the hull a further by adjusting the suspension.
Being familiar with both the French Char B1&#x27;s precision transmission, the exceptional turning performance of the short tracked assault guns, and the combat performance of the German StuG and Jagdpanzer series inspired Berge&#x27;s design to solve the aiming problem through the use of a fully automated transmission and suspension system, which precisely turned and tilted the tank under the gunner&#x27;s control. The gun itself would be fixed to the hull. This made it impossible to use a stabilised gun. As a result, the tank could not accurately move and fire at the same time, but the Swedish experience with Centurions suggested that, in order for tanks to reach acceptable accuracy, they would need to come to a halt anyway, and wrongly estimated that no breakthrough in stabilisation technology was likely within the foreseeable future.

Other features of the tank were also quite radical. The rifled gun, a Bofors 105 mm L74 with a barrel length of 62 Calibers, was able to use the same ammunition as the British Royal Ordnance L7, and would be equipped with an autoloader allowing a rate of fire of one round every three seconds, also allowing the crew to be reduced to two; a gunner/driver and the commander (most designs of the era used a crew of four), with one person being able to handle all functions of the tank from the ordinary position due to duplicate controls. This would of course only be used in emergencies, as the workload would be overwhelming, but apart from providing redundancy it also allowed the crew to shift tasks between them as situation required. The concept went through practical tests, that quickly revealed that a two-man crew would not be self-sufficient when considering the many tasks not directly related to handling the tank: in particular, routine maintenance, bivouacking, track-changes and reloading in field. While the last issue could have been solved by adding staff to the ammunition crews, it was decided that a third crew-member was needed. To enhance combat effectiveness, the third man was to be assigned as a rear driver/radio operator, facing the rear of the tank and equipped with a complete setup for driving. This allowed the tank to be driven backwards at the same speed as forwards, keeping its frontal armour pointed at the enemy, while relieving the commander of routine radio duty. The commander and gunner/driver both had the same set of sights and controls to fire the gun and drive the tank.

The tank was uniquely powered by two different kind of engines, a Rolls-Royce K60 opposed-piston diesel for slow cruising and manoeuvring the tank in aiming, and a Boeing 502 turbine for more power when travelling at higher speed or in severe terrain. The turbine was quickly found to be underpowered, and was replaced by a Caterpillar turbine delivering after no more than 70 tanks had been produced, and retrofitted to all previous vehicles. This was the first use of a turbine engine in a production tank; the Soviet T-80 and US M1 Abrams would later be built with gas turbines for main propulsion. The concept was interesting enough that Bofors was asked to build a prototype of the suspension/drive train, which they completed successfully.

The Strv 103 could be made fully amphibious. A flotation screen could be erected around the upper hull in about 20 minutes, and the tracks would drive the tank at about in water.

One tank in each platoon was fitted with a dozer blade under the front hull, which was from outside the tank manually dropped and locked into working position with pins and support struts. The blade allowed it to do simple engineering tasks, like digging fire pits for the platoon, filling trenches for ease of passage and so forth. Once the task was completed, the blade was again manually returned to the position under the front hull and locked in place. Upon the introduction of the 103C model all tanks had a bulldozer blade fitted, both to speed up operations and for the increased protection of the lower hull.

== Service ==
In preparation for the defence plan of 1958 (&quot;Försvarsbeslut 1958 (FB58)&quot;) in Riksdagen (Swedish parliament), the procurement set &quot;Alternativ S&quot; against the two foreign alternatives &quot;Alternativ A&quot; and &quot;Alternativ T&quot;. While the domestic alternative was going to be more expensive, the defence committee report recommended &quot;S&quot; when weighing in the symbolic value of a domestic tank for a neutral country as well as the spin-off effects on Swedish industrial competence.

Riksdagen made the formal decision regarding FB58 on 4 February 1958, and a follow-on contract called for two production prototypes, which were completed in 1961. By this point, the army was so satisfied with the design that an initial pre-production order for 10 was placed in 1960.

With minor changes, the &quot;Alternativ S&quot; was adopted as the &quot;Stridsvagn 103&quot; (&quot;103&quot; from being the third tank with a 10 cm calibre gun accepted into Swedish service). Full production started in 1967 and ended in 1971 with 290 delivered. The changes included a new gyro-stabilised commander&#x27;s cupola armed with a 7.62 mm KSP 58 machine gun, and upgraded frontal armour. A unique slat armor grid could be mounted at the front to help defeat high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rounds; however, it was kept secret for many years and was to be fitted only in the event of war.

Despite its design, the Strv 103 was intended for offensive operations. The armoured brigades of the Swedish Army, which operated the Strv 103, were designated &quot;anfallsbrigader&quot; (assault brigades) and tasked with launching counter-offensives on enemy beachheads and airborne landings. The stated Swedish armoured doctrine contemporary to the tank describes an aggressive approach to armoured warfare, even in defensive situations. The design of the Strv 103, with its low profile, was based on protection rather than defensive battlefield behaviour.

In 1980, the Swedish Army requested all tanks in the inventory to be scrapped and replaced with an unspecified Stridsvagn 2000 (tank for usage past year 2000). In 1982, the Riksdag decided for severe reduction of the military budget in Defence Act of 1982, and instead decided the tank-fleet should go through a renovation and modification (REMO) to at least somewhat bring them up to standard while within the economic limits imposed.

== Performance ==

The Stridsvagn 103 never saw combat and so its design remains unproven. However, for its intended role in the 1960s, it had numerous advantages. In 1967, Norway carried out a two-week comparative observation test with the Leopard 1 and found that, with closed hatches, the 103 spotted more targets and fired faster than the Leopard while the situation was reversed when operating with hatches open. In April to September 1968, two 103s were tested at the British armour school in Bovington, which reported that &quot;the turretless concept of the &quot;S&quot;-tank holds considerable advantage over turreted tanks&quot;. In 1973, the BAOR tested the 103. British crewmen received six weeks training and the vehicles were serviced by Swedish engineers. Over nine days of manoeuvres alongside the Chieftain tank, availability never fell under 90% and the final report stated, &quot;It has not been possible to prove any disadvantage in the &quot;S&quot; inability to fire on the move.&quot; In 1975, two 103s were tested at the American armour center at Fort Knox. The trial demonstrated that the 103 fired more accurately than the M60A1E3, but on an average of 0.5 seconds slower. In the late 90s, a wargame was held in Kvarn pitting 7 Strv 103s in a defensive position against an equal amount of Strv 121s (Leopard 2). All seven Strv 121s were knocked out while only one 103 was lost.

In comparison with the Centurion, the shorter track of the Strv 103 meant it performed worse on soft ground (mud and snow), and its trench taking and vertical obstacle capabilities were also significantly lower: where the Centurion climbed a 100 cm wall, the 103 was barely able to climb an 80 cm wall. On hard terrain, the 103 on the other hand was far more manoeuvrable.

== Variants ==
; Stridsvagn 103B: As the weight of the Strv 103 had increased compared to the pre-production tanks, the 103 turned out to be under-powered. Hence, a more powerful version of the same gas turbine, manufactured by Caterpillar, was introduced after the first production run of 80 tanks. The early version tanks (retroactively designated Strv 103A) were soon upgraded to B-standard. Adjustments to the hydro-pneumatic suspension increased elevation range from −10 through +12 degrees, to −11 through +16 degrees.
; Stridsvagn 103C: An upgrade programme was started in 1986 to fit all vehicles with improved fire control systems. Also, each Strv 103 was fitted with a dozer blade, rather than just one per platoon. A further upgrade in 1987/88 replaced the Rolls-Royce engine with a newer Detroit Diesel with more fuel cans placed along the sides to function as applique armour, and added a new laser rangefinder.

; Stridsvagn 103D: In the mid-1990s, as the Swedish Armed Forces were looking for a new main battle tank, one Strv 103C was upgraded into the Strv 103D. The major changes were the installation of fire-control computer, thermal viewers for both the gunner and the commander, allowing the crew to fight at night-time and in bad weather conditions, and the installation of passive light enhancers for driving. Some minor changes to the suspension system and engine were also made. There was some consideration of adding both reactive and/or appliqué armour in the early 1990s, but, in the end, the Strv 103 was instead phased out of Swedish service in favour of the Stridsvagn 121 (leased Leopard 2A4s were used as a stop-gap measure), which entered service in 1997 (the last year that the Strv 103 was used to train tank crews). This prototype was used during the trials for the new main battle tank system for the Swedish Armed Forces alongside all the other tanks tested. For a few years this prototype was even tested under remote control. The sole Strv 103D is today on display at the Arsenalen national military vehicle museum, together with some 103C models. They are all still in running order.

; Minvält 103C: The MV 103C Deminer was a minesweeper vehicle based on the 103C tank. The project was discontinued in 1997.

<doc id="355852" wikidata="Q151198" url="?curid=355852" title="Dachau concentration camp">
<text>Dachau (, ; , ; ) was one of the first concentration camps built by Nazi Germany and the longest-running one, opening on 22 March 1933. The camp was initially intended to intern Hitler&#x27;s political opponents, which consisted of communists, social democrats, and other dissidents. It is located on the grounds of an abandoned munitions factory northeast of the medieval town of Dachau, about northwest of Munich in the state of Bavaria, in southern Germany. After its opening by Heinrich Himmler, its purpose was enlarged to include forced labor, and eventually, the imprisonment of Jews, Romani, German and Austrian criminals, and, finally, foreign nationals from countries that Germany occupied or invaded. The Dachau camp system grew to include nearly 100 sub-camps, which were mostly work camps or , and were located throughout southern Germany and Austria. The main camp was liberated by U.S. forces on 29 April 1945.

Prisoners lived in constant fear of brutal treatment and terror detention including standing cells, floggings, the so-called tree or pole hanging, and standing at attention for extremely long periods. There were 32,000 documented deaths at the camp, and thousands that are undocumented. Approximately 10,000 of the 30,000 prisoners were sick at the time of liberation.

In the postwar years, the Dachau facility served to hold SS soldiers awaiting trial. After 1948, it held ethnic Germans who had been expelled from eastern Europe and were awaiting resettlement, and also was used for a time as a United States military base during the occupation. It was finally closed in 1960.

There are several religious memorials within the Memorial Site, which is open to the public.
==General overview==

Dachau served as a prototype and model for the other German concentration camps that followed. Almost every community in Germany had members taken away to these camps. Newspapers continually reported &quot;the removal of the enemies of the Reich to concentration camps.&quot; As early as 1935, a jingle went around: &quot;Lieber Herr Gott, mach mich stumm, dass ich nicht nach Dachau komm&#x27;&quot; (&quot;Dear Lord God, make me dumb [silent], That I may not to Dachau come&quot;).
The camp&#x27;s layout and building plans were developed by Commandant Theodor Eicke and were applied to all later camps. He had a separate, secure camp near the command center, which consisted of living quarters, administration and army camps. Eicke became the chief inspector for all concentration camps, responsible for organizing others according to his model.

The Dachau complex included the prisoners&#x27; camp which occupied approximately 5 acres, and the much larger area of SS training school including barracks, factories plus other facilities of around 20 acres.

The entrance gate used by prisoners carries the phrase &quot;Arbeit macht frei&quot; (, or &quot;Work makes [one] free&quot;; contextual English translation: &quot;Work shall set you free&quot;). This phrase was also used in several other concentration camps such as Theresienstadt, near Prague, and Auschwitz I.
Dachau was the concentration camp that was in operation the longest, from March 1933 to April 1945, nearly all twelve years of the Nazi regime. Dachau&#x27;s close proximity to Munich, where Hitler came to power and where the Nazi Party had its official headquarters, made Dachau a convenient location. From 1933 to 1938, the prisoners were mainly German nationals detained for political reasons. After the &quot;Reichspogromnacht&quot; or &quot;Kristallnacht&quot;, 30,000 male Jewish citizens were deported to concentration camps. More than 10,000 of them were interned in Dachau alone. As the German military occupied other European states, citizens from across Europe were sent to concentration camps. Subsequently, the camp was used for prisoners of all sorts, from every nation occupied by the forces of the Third Reich.

In the postwar years, the camp continued in use. From 1945 through 1948, the camp was used by the Allies as a prison for SS officers awaiting trial. After 1948, when hundreds of thousands of ethnic Germans were expelled from eastern Europe, it held Germans from Czechoslovakia until they could be resettled. It also served as a military base for the United States, which maintained forces in the country. It was closed in 1960. At the insistence of survivors, various memorials have been constructed and installed here.
Demographic statistics vary but they are in the same general range. One source gives a general estimate of over 200,000 prisoners from more than 30 countries during Nazi rule, of whom two-thirds were political prisoners, including many Catholic priests, and nearly one-third were Jews. At least 25,613 prisoners are believed to have been murdered in the camp and almost another 10,000 in its subcamps, primarily from disease, malnutrition and suicide. In late 1944, a typhus epidemic occurred in the camp caused by poor sanitation and overcrowding, which caused more than 15,000 deaths. It was followed by an evacuation, in which large numbers of the prisoners died. Toward the end of the war, death marches to and from the camp caused the deaths of numerous unrecorded prisoners. After liberation, prisoners weakened beyond recovery by the starvation conditions continued to die. Two thousand cases of &quot;the dread black typhus&quot; had already been identified by 3 May, and the U.S. Seventh Army was &quot;working day and night to alleviate the appalling conditions at the camp&quot;. Prisoners with typhus, a louse-borne disease with an incubation period from 12 to 18 days, were treated by the 116th Evacuation Hospital, while the 127th would be the general hospital for the other illnesses. There were 227 documented deaths among the 2,252 patients cared for by the 127th.
Over the 12 years of use as a concentration camp, the Dachau administration recorded the intake of 206,206 prisoners and deaths of 31,951. Crematoria were constructed to dispose of the deceased. Visitors may now walk through the buildings and view the ovens used to cremate bodies, which hid the evidence of many deaths. It is claimed that in 1942, more than 3,166 prisoners in weakened condition were transported to Hartheim Castle near Linz, and were executed by poison gas because they were deemed unfit. Between January and April 1945 11,560 detainees died at KZ Dachau according to a U.S. Army report of 1945, though the Dachau administration registered 12,596 deaths from typhus at the camp over the same period.

Dachau was the third concentration camp to be liberated by British or American Allied forces.

==History==
===Establishment===
After the takeover of Bavaria on 9 March 1933, Heinrich Himmler, then Chief of Police in Munich, began to speak with the administration of an unused gunpowder and munitions factory. He toured the site to see if it could be used for quartering protective-custody prisoners. The concentration camp at Dachau was opened 22 March 1933, with the arrival of about 200 prisoners from Stadelheim Prison in Munich and the Landsberg fortress (where Hitler had written &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; during his imprisonment). Himmler announced in the &quot;Münchner Neueste Nachrichten&quot; newspaper that the camp could hold up to 5,000 people, and described it as &quot;the first concentration camp for political prisoners&quot; to be used to restore calm to Germany. It became the first regular concentration camp established by the coalition government of the National Socialist German Worker&#x27;s Party (Nazi Party) and the German National People&#x27;s Party (dissolved on 6 July 1933).

Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, homosexuals and emigrants were sent to Dachau after the 1935 passage of the Nuremberg Laws which institutionalized racial discrimination. In early 1937, the SS, using prisoner labor, initiated construction of a large complex capable of holding 6,000 prisoners. The construction was officially completed in mid-August 1938. More political opponents, and over 11,000 German and Austrian Jews were sent to the camp after the annexation of Austria and the Sudetenland in 1938. Sinti and Roma in the hundreds were sent to the camp in 1939, and over 13,000 prisoners were sent to the camp from Poland in 1940. Representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross inspected the camp in 1935 and 1938 and documented the harsh conditions.

===First deaths 1933: Investigation===
Shortly after the SS was commissioned to supplement the Bavarian police overseeing the Dachau camp, the first reports of prisoner deaths at Dachau began to emerge. In April 1933, Josef Hartinger, an official from the Bavarian Justice Ministry and physician Moritz Flamm, part-time medical examiner, arrived at the camp to investigate the deaths in accordance with the Bavarian penal code. They noted many inconsistencies between the injuries on the corpses and the camp guards&#x27; accounts of the deaths. Over a number of months, Hartinger and Flamm uncovered clear evidence of murder and compiled a dossier of charges against Hilmar Wäckerle, the SS commandant of Dachau, Werner Nürnbergk, the camp doctor, and Josef Mutzbauer, the camp&#x27;s chief administrator (&quot;Kanzleiobersekretär&quot;). In June 1933, Hartinger presented the case to his superior, Bavarian State Prosecutor Karl Wintersberger. Initially supportive of the investigation, Wintersberger became reluctant to submit the resulting indictment to the Justice Ministry, increasingly under the influence of the SS. Hartinger reduced the scope of the dossier to the four clearest cases and Wintersberger signed it, after first notifying Himmler as a courtesy. The killings at Dachau suddenly stopped (temporarily), Wäckerle was transferred to Stuttgart and replaced by Theodor Eicke. The indictment and related evidence reached the office of Hans Frank, the Bavarian Justice Minister, but was intercepted by Gauleiter Adolf Wagner and locked away in a desk only to be discovered by the US Army.
In 1934, both Hartinger and Wintersberger were transferred to provincial positions. Flamm was no longer employed as a medical examiner and was to survive two attempts on his life before his suspicious death in the same year. Flamm&#x27;s thoroughly gathered and documented evidence within Hartiger&#x27;s indictment ensured that it achieved convictions of senior Nazis at the Nuremberg trials in 1947. Wintersberger&#x27;s complicit behaviour is documented in his own evidence to the Pohl Trial.

===Forced labor===
The prisoners of Dachau concentration camp originally were to serve as forced labor for a munition factory, and to expand the camp. It was used as a training center for the &quot;SS-Totenkopfverbände&quot; guards and was a model for other concentration camps. The camp was about in rectangular shape. The prisoners&#x27; entrance was secured by an iron gate with the motto &quot;Arbeit macht frei&quot; (&quot;Work will make you free&quot;). This reflected Nazi propaganda, which had concentration camps as labor and re-education camps. This was their original purpose, but the focus was soon shifted to using forced labor as a method of torture and murder. The original slogan was left on the gates.

As of 1938, the procedure for new arrivals occurred at the &quot;Schubraum&quot;, where prisoners were to hand over their clothing and possessions. One former Luxembourgish prisoner, Albert Theis, reflected about the room, &quot;There we were stripped of all our clothes. Everything had to be handed over: money, rings, watches. One was now stark naked&quot;.

The camp included an administration building that contained offices for the Gestapo trial commissioner, SS authorities, the camp leader and his deputies. These administration offices consisted of large storage rooms for the personal belongings of prisoners, the bunker, roll-call square where guards would also inflict punishment on prisoners (especially those who tried to escape), the canteen where prisoners served SS men with cigarettes and food, the museum containing plaster images of prisoners who suffered from bodily defects, the camp office, the library, the barracks, and the infirmary, which was staffed by prisoners who had previously held occupations such as physicians or army surgeons.

===Operation Barbarossa===
Over 4,000 Soviet prisoners of war were murdered by the Dachau commandant&#x27;s guard at the SS shooting range located at Hebertshausen, two kilometers from the main camp, in the years 1941/1943. These murders were a clear violation of the provisions laid down in the Geneva Convention for prisoners of war. The SS used the cynical term &quot;Sonderbehandlung&quot; (&quot;special treatment&quot;) for these criminal executions. The first executions of the Soviet prisoners of war at the Hebertshausen shooting range took place on 25 November 1941.

After 1942, the number of prisoners being held at the camp continued to exceed 12,000. Dachau originally held communists, leading socialists and other &quot;enemies of the state&quot; in 1933 but, over time, the Nazis began to send German Jews to the camp. In the early years of imprisonment, Jews were offered permission to emigrate overseas if they &quot;voluntarily&quot; gave their property to enhance Hitler&#x27;s public treasury. Once Austria was annexed and Czechoslovakia was dissolved, the citizens of both countries became the next prisoners at Dachau. In 1940, Dachau became filled with Polish prisoners, who continued to be the majority of the prisoner population until Dachau was officially liberated.

The prisoner enclosure at the camp was heavily guarded to ensure that no prisoners escaped. A no-man&#x27;s land was the first marker of confinement for prisoners; an area which, upon entry, would elicit lethal gunfire from guard towers. Guards are known to have tossed inmates&#x27; caps into this area, resulting in the death of the prisoners when they attempted to retrieve the caps. Despondent prisoners committed suicide by entering the zone. A four-foot-deep and eight-foot-broad (1.2 × 2.4 m) creek, connected with the river Amper, lay on the west side between the &quot;neutral-zone&quot; and the electrically charged, and barbed wire fence which surrounded the entire prisoner enclosure.

In August 1944 a women&#x27;s camp opened inside Dachau. In the last months of the war, the conditions at Dachau deteriorated. As Allied forces advanced toward Germany, the Germans began to move prisoners from concentration camps near the front to more centrally located camps. They hoped to prevent the liberation of large numbers of prisoners. Transports from the evacuated camps arrived continuously at Dachau. After days of travel with little or no food or water, the prisoners arrived weak and exhausted, often near death. Typhus epidemics became a serious problem as a result of overcrowding, poor sanitary conditions, insufficient provisions, and the weakened state of the prisoners.

Owing to repeated transports from the front, the camp was constantly overcrowded and the hygiene conditions were beneath human dignity. Starting from the end of 1944 up to the day of liberation, 15,000 people died, about half of all the prisoners held at KZ Dachau. Five hundred Soviet POWs were executed by firing squad. The first shipment of women came from Auschwitz-Birkenau.

===Final days===
As late as 19 April 1945, prisoners were sent to KZ Dachau; on that date a freight train from Buchenwald with nearly 4,500 was diverted to Nammering. SS troops and police confiscated food and water that local townspeople tried to give to the prisoners. Nearly three hundred dead bodies were ordered removed from the train and carried to a ravine over away. The 524 prisoners who had been forced to carry the dead to this site were then shot by the guards, and buried along with those who had died on the train. Nearly 800 bodies went into this mass grave. The train continued on to KZ Dachau.
During April 1945 as U.S. troops drove deeper into Bavaria, the commander of KZ Dachau suggested to Himmler that the camp be turned over to the Allies. Himmler, in signed correspondence, prohibited such a move, adding that &quot;No prisoners shall be allowed to fall into the hands of the enemy alive.&quot;

On 24 April 1945, just days before the U.S. troops arrived at the camp, the commandant and a strong guard forced between 6,000 and 7,000 surviving inmates on a death march from Dachau south to Eurasburg, then eastwards towards the Tegernsee; liberated two days after Hitler&#x27;s death by a &quot;Nisei&quot;-ethnicity U.S. Army artillery battalion. Any prisoners who could not keep up on the six-day march were shot. Many others died of exhaustion, hunger and exposure. Months later a mass grave containing 1,071 prisoners was found along the route.

Though at the time of liberation the death rate had peaked at 200 per day, after the liberation by U.S. forces the rate eventually fell to between 50 and 80 deaths per day from malnutrition and disease. In addition to the direct abuse of the SS and the harsh conditions, people died from typhus epidemics and starvation. The number of inmates had peaked in 1944 with transports from evacuated camps in the east (such as Auschwitz), and the resulting overcrowding led to an increase in the death rate.

==Main camp==

===Purpose===

Dachau was opened in March 1933. The press statement given at the opening stated:
On Wednesday the first concentration camp is to be opened in Dachau with an accommodation for 5000 people. &#x27;All Communists and—where necessary—Reichsbanner and Social Democratic functionaries who endanger state security are to be concentrated here, as in the long run it is not possible to keep individual functionaries in the state prisons without overburdening these prisons, and on the other hand these people cannot be released because attempts have shown that they persist in their efforts to agitate and organize as soon as they are released.

Whatever the publicly stated purpose of the camp, the SS men who arrived there on 11 May 1933 were left in no illusion as to its real purpose by the speech given on that day by Johann-Erasmus Freiherr von Malsen-Ponickau
Comrades of the SS! You all know what the Fuehrer has called us to do. We have not come here for human encounters with those pigs in there. We do not consider them human beings, as we are, but as second-class people. For years they have been able to continue their criminal existence. But now we are in power. If those pigs had come to power, they would have cut off all our heads. Therefore we have no room for sentimentalism. If anyone here cannot bear to see the blood of comrades, he does not belong and had better leave. The more of these pig dogs we strike down, the fewer we need to feed.

Between the years 1933 and 1945, more than 3.5 million Germans were imprisoned in such concentration camps or prison for political reasons. Approximately 77,000 Germans were killed for one or another form of resistance by Special Courts, courts-martial, and the civil justice system. Many of these Germans had served in government, the military, or in civil positions, which were considered to enable them to engage in subversion and conspiracy against the Nazis.

===Organization===
The camp was divided into two sections: the camp area and the crematorium. The camp area consisted of 32 barracks, including one for clergy imprisoned for opposing the Nazi regime and one reserved for medical experiments. The courtyard between the prison and the central kitchen was used for the summary execution of prisoners. The camp was surrounded by an electrified barbed-wire fence, a ditch, and a wall with seven guard towers.
In early 1937, the SS, using prisoner labor, initiated construction of a large complex of buildings on the grounds of the original camp. The construction was officially completed in mid-August 1938 and the camp remained essentially unchanged and in operation until 1945. A crematorium that was next to, but not directly accessible from within the camp, was erected in 1942. KZ Dachau was therefore the longest running concentration camp of the Third Reich. The Dachau complex included other SS facilities beside the concentration camp—a leader school of the economic and civil service, the medical school of the SS, etc. The camp at that time was called a &quot;protective custody camp,&quot; and occupied less than half of the area of the entire complex.

===Medical experimentation===

Hundreds of prisoners suffered and died, or were executed, in medical experiments conducted at KZ Dachau, of which Sigmund Rascher was in charge. Hypothermia experiments involved exposure to vats of icy water or being strapped down naked outdoors in freezing temperatures. Attempts at reviving the subjects included scalding baths, and forcing naked women to have sexual intercourse with the unconscious victim. Nearly 100 prisoners died during these experiments. The original records of the experiments were destroyed &quot;in an attempt to conceal the atrocities&quot;.

Extensive communication between the investigators and Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS, documents the experiments.

During 1942, &quot;high altitude&quot; experiments were conducted. Victims were subjected to rapid decompression to pressures found at , and experienced spasmodic convulsions, agonal breathing, and eventual death.

===Demographics===
The camp was originally designed for holding German and Austrian political prisoners and Jews, but in 1935 it began to be used also for ordinary criminals. Inside the camp there was a sharp division between the two groups of prisoners; those who were there for political reasons and therefore wore a red tag, and the criminals, who wore a green tag. The political prisoners who were there because they disagreed with Nazi Party policies, or with Hitler, naturally did not consider themselves criminals. Dachau was used as the chief camp for Christian (mainly Catholic) clergy who were imprisoned for not conforming with the Nazi Party line.

During the war, other nationals were transferred to it, including French; in 1940 Poles; in 1941 people from the Balkans, Czechs, Yugoslavs; and in 1942, Russians.

Prisoners were divided into categories. At first, they were classified by the nature of the crime for which they were accused, but eventually were classified by the specific authority-type under whose command a person was sent to camp. Political prisoners who had been arrested by the Gestapo wore a red badge, &quot;professional&quot; criminals sent by the Criminal Courts wore a green badge, Cri-Po prisoners arrested by the criminal police wore a brown badge, &quot;work-shy and asocial&quot; people sent by the welfare authorities or the Gestapo wore a black badge, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses arrested by the Gestapo wore a violet badge, homosexuals sent by the criminal courts wore a pink badge, emigrants arrested by the Gestapo wore a blue badge, &quot;race polluters&quot; arrested by the criminal court or Gestapo wore badges with a black outline, second-termers arrested by the Gestapo wore a bar matching the color of their badge, &quot;idiots&quot; wore a white armband with the label &quot;Blöd&quot; (Stupid), Romani wore a black triangle, and Jews, whose incarceration in the Dachau concentration camp dramatically increased after Kristallnacht, wore a yellow badge, combined with another color.

The average number of Germans in the camp during the war was . Just before the liberation many German prisoners were evacuated, but of these Germans died during the evacuation transport. Evacuated prisoners included such prominent political and religious figures as Martin Niemöller, Kurt von Schuschnigg, Édouard Daladier, Léon Blum, Franz Halder, and Hjalmar Schacht.

====Clergy====

In an effort to counter the strength and influence of spiritual resistance, Nazi security services monitored clergy very closely. Priests were frequently denounced, arrested and sent to concentration camps, often simply on the basis of being &quot;suspected of activities hostile to the State&quot; or that there was reason to &quot;suppose that his dealings might harm society&quot;. Despite SS hostility to religious observance, the Vatican and German bishops successfully lobbied the regime to concentrate clergy at one camp and obtained permission to build a chapel, for the priests to live communally and for time to be allotted to them for their religious and intellectual activity. Priests Barracks at Dachau were established in Blocks 26, 28 and 30, though only temporarily. 26 became the international block and 28 was reserved for Poles—the most numerous group.

Of a total of 2,720 clergy recorded as imprisoned at Dachau, the overwhelming majority, some 2,579 (or 94.88%) were Catholic. Among the other denominations, there were 109 Protestants, 22 Greek Orthodox, 8 Old Catholics and Mariavites and 2 Muslims. In his &quot;Dachau: The Official History 1933–1945&quot;, Paul Berben noted that R. Schnabel&#x27;s 1966 investigation, &quot;Die Frommen in der Hölle&quot; (&quot;The Pious Ones in Hell&quot;) found an alternative total of 2,771 and included the fate all the clergy listed, with 692 noted as deceased and 336 sent out on &quot;invalid trainloads&quot; and therefore presumed dead. Over 400 German priests were sent to Dachau. Total numbers incarcerated are nonetheless difficult to assert, for some clergy were not recognised as such by the camp authorities, and some—particularly Poles—did not wish to be identified as such, fearing they would be mistreated.

The Nazis introduced a racial hierarchy—keeping Poles in harsh conditions, while favoring German priests. 697 Poles arrived in December 1941, and a further 500 of mainly elderly clergy arrived in October the following year. Inadequately clothed for the bitter cold, of this group, only 82 survived. A large number of Polish priests were chosen for Nazi medical experiments. In November 1942, 20 were given phlegmons. 120 were used by Dr Schilling for malaria experiments between July 1942 and May 1944. Several Poles met their deaths with the &quot;invalid trains&quot; sent out from the camp, others were liquidated in the camp and given bogus death certificates. Some died of cruel punishment for misdemeanors—beaten to death or run to exhaustion.

====Staff====

The camp staff consisted mostly of male SS, although 19 female guards served at Dachau as well, most of them until liberation. Sixteen have been identified including Fanny Baur, Leopoldine Bittermann, Ernestine Brenner, Anna Buck, Rosa Dolaschko, Maria Eder, Rosa Grassmann, Betty Hanneschaleger, Ruth Elfriede Hildner, Josefa Keller, Berta Kimplinger, Lieselotte Klaudat, Theresia Kopp, Rosalie Leimboeck, and Thea Miesl. Female guards were also assigned to the Augsburg Michelwerke, Burgau, Kaufering, Mühldorf, and Munich Agfa Camera Werke subcamps. In mid-April 1945, female subcamps at Kaufering, Augsburg, and Munich were closed, and the SS stationed the women at Dachau. Several Norwegians worked as guards at the Dachau camp.

In the major Dachau war crimes case (&quot;United States of America v. Martin Gottfried Weiss et.al.&quot;), forty-two officials of Dachau were tried from November to December 1945. All were found guilty—thirty-six of the defendants were sentenced to death on 13 December 1945, of whom 23 were hanged on 28–29 May 1946, including the commandant, SS-&quot;Obersturmbannführer&quot; Martin Gottfried Weiss, SS-&quot;Obersturmführer&quot; Freidrich Wilhelm Ruppert and camp doctors Karl Schilling and Fritz Hintermeyer. Camp commandant Weiss admitted in affidavit testimony that most of the deaths at Dachau during his administration were due to &quot;typhus, TB, dysentery, pneumonia, pleurisy, and body weakness brought about by lack of food.&quot; His testimony also admitted to deaths by shootings, hangings and medical experiments. Ruppert ordered and supervised the deaths of innumerable prisoners at Dachau main and subcamps, according to the War Crimes Commission official trial transcript. He testified about hangings, shootings and lethal injections, but did not admit to direct responsibility for any individual deaths. An anonymous Dutch prisoner contended that British Special Operations Executive (SOE) agent Noor Inayat Khan was cruelly beaten by SS officer Wilhelm Ruppert before being shot from behind; the beating may have been the actual cause of her death.

==Satellite camps and sub-camps==

Satellite camps under the authority of Dachau were established in the summer and autumn of 1944 near armaments factories throughout southern Germany to increase war production. Dachau alone had more than 30 large subcamps, and hundreds of smaller ones, in which over 30,000 prisoners worked almost exclusively on armaments.

Overall, the Dachau concentration camp system included 123 sub-camps and Kommandos which were set up in 1943 when factories were built near the main camp to make use of forced labor of the Dachau prisoners. Out of the 123 sub-camps, eleven of them were called Kaufering, distinguished by a number at the end of each. All Kaufering sub-camps were set up to specifically build three underground factories (Allied bombing raids made it necessary for them to be underground) for a project called &quot;Ringeltaube&quot; (wood pigeon), which planned to be the location in which the German jet fighter plane, Messerschmitt Me 262, was to be built. In the last days of war, in April 1945, the Kaufering camps were evacuated and around 15,000 prisoners were sent up to the main Dachau camp. Typhus alone was estimated to have caused 15,000 deaths between December 1944 and April 1945. &quot;Within the first month after the arrival of the American troops, 10,000 prisoners were treated for malnutrition and kindred diseases. In spite of this one hundred prisoners died each day during the first month from typhus, dysentery or general weakness&quot;.

As U.S. Army troops neared the Dachau sub-camp at Landsberg on 27 April 1945, the SS officer in charge ordered that 4,000 prisoners be murdered. Windows and doors of their huts were nailed shut. The buildings were then doused with gasoline and set afire. Prisoners who were naked or nearly so were burned to death, while some managed to crawl out of the buildings before dying. Earlier that day, as Wehrmacht troops withdrew from Landsberg am Lech, townspeople hung white sheets from their windows. Infuriated SS troops dragged German civilians from their homes and hanged them from trees.

==Liberation==


===Main camp===

As the Allies began to advance on Nazi Germany, the SS began to evacuate the first concentration camps in summer 1944. Thousands of prisoners were killed before the evacuation due to being ill or unable to walk. At the end of 1944, the overcrowding of camps began to take its toll on the prisoners. The unhygienic conditions and the supplies of food rations became disastrous. In November a typhus fever epidemic broke out that took thousands of lives.

In the second phase of the evacuation, in April 1945, Himmler gave direct evacuation routes for remaining camps. Prisoners who were from the northern part of Germany were to be directed to the Baltic and North Sea coasts to be drowned. The prisoners from the southern part were to be gathered in the Alps, which was the location in which the SS wanted to resist the Allies. On 28 April 1945, an armed revolt took place in the town of Dachau. Both former and escaped concentration camp prisoners and a renegade Volkssturm (civilian militia) company took part. At about 8:30 am the rebels occupied the Town Hall. The SS gruesomely suppressed the revolt within a few hours.

Being fully aware that Germany was about to be defeated in World War II, the SS invested its time in removing evidence of the crimes it committed in the concentration camps. They began destroying incriminating evidence in April 1945 and planned on murdering the prisoners using codenames &quot;Wolke A-I&quot; (Cloud A-1) and &quot;Wolkenbrand&quot; (Cloud fire). However, these plans were not carried out. In mid-April, plans to evacuate the camp started by sending prisoners toward Tyrol. On 26 April, over 10,000 prisoners were forced to leave the Dachau concentration camp on foot, in trains, or in trucks. The largest group of some 7,000 prisoners was driven southward on a foot-march lasting several days. More than 1,000 prisoners did not survive this march. The evacuation transports cost many thousands of prisoners their lives.

On 26 April 1945 prisoner Karl Riemer fled the Dachau concentration camp to get help from American troops and on 28 April Victor Maurer, a representative of the International Red Cross, negotiated an agreement to surrender the camp to U.S. troops. That night a secretly formed International Prisoners Committee took over the control of the camp. Units of 3rd Battalion, 157th Infantry Regiment, 45th Infantry Division, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Felix L. Sparks, were ordered to secure the camp. On 29 April Sparks led part of his battalion as they entered the camp over a side wall. At about the same time, Brigadier General Henning Linden led the 222nd Infantry Regiment of the 42nd (Rainbow) Infantry Division soldiers including his aide, Lieutenant William Cowling, to accept the formal surrender of the camp from German Lieutenant Heinrich Wicker at an entrance between the camp and the compound for the SS garrison. Linden was traveling with Marguerite Higgins and other reporters; as a result, Linden&#x27;s detachment generated international headlines by accepting the surrender of the camp. More than 30,000 Jews and political prisoners were freed, and since 1945 adherents of the 42nd and 45th Division versions of events have argued over which unit was the first to liberate Dachau.

===Satellite camps liberation===
The first Dachau subcamp discovered by advancing Allied forces was Kaufering IV by the 12th Armored Division on 27 April 1945. Subcamps liberated by the 12th Armored Division included: Erpting, Schrobenhausen, Schwabing, Langerringen, Türkheim, Lauingen, Schwabach, Germering.

During the liberation of the sub-camps surrounding Dachau, advance scouts of the U.S. Army&#x27;s 522nd Field Artillery Battalion, a segregated battalion consisting of Nisei, 2nd generation Japanese-Americans, liberated the 3,000 prisoners of the &quot;Kaufering IV Hurlach&quot; slave labor camp. Perisco describes an Office of Strategic Services (OSS) team (code name LUXE) leading Army Intelligence to a &quot;Camp IV&quot; on 29 April. &quot;They found the camp afire and a stack of some four hundred bodies burning ... American soldiers then went into Landsberg and rounded up all the male civilians they could find and marched them out to the camp. The former commandant was forced to lie amidst a pile of corpses. The male population of Landsberg was then ordered to walk by, and ordered to spit on the commandant as they passed. The commandant was then turned over to a group of liberated camp survivors&quot;. The 522nd&#x27;s personnel later discovered the survivors of a death march headed generally southwards from the Dachau main camp to Eurasburg, then eastwards towards the Austrian border on 2 May, just west of the town of Waakirchen.

Weather at the time of liberation was unseasonably cool and temperatures trended down through the first two days of May; on 2 May, the area received a snowstorm with of snow at nearby Munich. Proper clothing was still scarce and film footage from the time (as seen in &quot;The World at War)&quot; shows naked, gaunt people either wandering on snow or dead under it.

Due to the number of sub-camps over a large area that comprised the Dachau concentration camp complex, many Allied units have been officially recognized by the United States Army Center of Military History and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum as liberating units of Dachau, including:
the 4th Infantry Division, 36th Infantry Division, 42nd Infantry Division, 45th Infantry Division, 63rd Infantry Division, 99th Infantry Division, 103rd Infantry Division, 10th Armored Division, 12th Armored Division, 14th Armored Division, 20th Armored Division, and the 101st Airborne Division.

===Killing of camp guards===
American troops and liberated concentration camp prisoners killed some of the camp guards after they had surrendered. The number is disputed, as some were killed in combat, some while attempting to surrender, and others after their surrender was accepted. In 1989, Brigadier General Felix L. Sparks, the Colonel in command of a battalion that was present, stated:

An Inspector General report resulting from a US Army investigation conducted between 3 and 8 May 1945—titled &quot;American Army Investigation of Alleged Mistreatment of German Guards at Dachau&quot;—found that 21 plus &quot;a number&quot; of presumed SS men were killed, with others being wounded after their surrender had been accepted. In addition, 25 to 50 SS guards were estimated to have been killed by the liberated prisoners. Lee Miller visited the camp just after liberation, and photographed several guards who were killed by soldiers or prisoners.

According to Sparks, court-martial charges were drawn up against him and several other men under his command, but General George S. Patton, who had recently been appointed military governor of Bavaria, chose to dismiss the charges.

Colonel Charles L. Decker, an acting deputy judge advocate, concluded in late 1945 that, while war crimes had been committed at Dachau by Germany, &quot;Certainly, there was no such systematic criminality among United States forces as pervaded the Nazi groups in Germany.&quot;

American troops also forced local citizens to the camp to see for themselves the conditions there and to help bury the dead. Many local residents were shocked about the experience and claimed no knowledge of the activities at the camp.

===Post-liberation Easter===
6 May 1945 (23 April on the Orthodox calendar) was the day of Pascha, Orthodox Easter. In a cell block used by Catholic priests to say daily Mass, several Greek, Serbian and Russian priests and one Serbian deacon, wearing makeshift vestments made from towels of the SS guard, gathered with several hundred Greek, Serbian and Russian prisoners to celebrate the Paschal Vigil. A prisoner named Rahr described the scene:

There is a Russian Orthodox chapel at the camp today, and it is well known for its icon of Christ leading the prisoners out of the camp gates.

==After liberation==

Authorities worked night and day to alleviate conditions at the camp immediately following the liberation as an epidemic of black typhus swept through the prisoner population. Two thousand cases had already been reported by 3 May.

By October 1945, the former camp was being used by the U.S. Army as a place of confinement for war criminals, the SS and important witnesses. It was also the site of the Dachau Trials for German war criminals, a site chosen for its symbolism. In 1948, the Bavarian government established housing for refugees on the site, and this remained for many years. Among those held in the Dachau internment camp set up under the U.S. Army were Elsa Ehrich, Maria Mandl, and Elisabeth Ruppert.

The Kaserne quarters and other buildings used by the guards and trainee guards were converted and served as the Eastman Barracks, an American military post. After the closure of the Eastman Barracks in 1974, these areas are now occupied by the Bavarian Bereitschaftspolizei (rapid response police unit).

===Deportation of Soviet nationals===

By January 1946, 18,000 members of the SS were being confined at the camp along with an additional 12,000 persons, including deserters from the Russian army and a number who had been captured in German Army uniform. The occupants of two barracks rioted as 271 of the Russian deserters were to be loaded onto trains that would return them to Russian-controlled lands, as agreed at the Yalta Conference. Inmates barricaded themselves inside two barracks. While the first was able to be cleared without too much trouble, those in the second building set fire to it, tore off their clothing in an effort to frustrate the guards, and linked arms to resist being removed from the building. Tear gas was used by the American soldiers before rushing the barracks, only for them to find that many had killed themselves.
The American services newspaper Stars and Stripes reported:
“The GIs quickly cut down most of those who had hanged themselves from the rafters. Those still conscious were screaming in Russian, pointing first at the guns of the guards, then at themselves, begging to us to shoot.”

Ten of the soldiers killed themselves during the riot while another 21 attempted suicide, apparently with razor blades. Many had &quot;cracked heads&quot; inflicted by 500 American guards, in the attempt to bring the situation under control. One of those injured later died in a hospital. The New York Times reported on the death with the headline, &quot;Russian Traitor Dies of Wounds&quot;.

== Memorial ==

Between 1945 and 1948 when the camp was handed over to the Bavarian authorities, many accused war criminals and members of the SS were imprisoned at the camp. Owing to the severe refugee crisis mainly caused by the expulsions of ethnic Germans, the camp was used from late 1948 to house 2000 Germans from Czechoslovakia (mainly from the Sudetenland). This settlement was called Dachau-East and remained until the mid-1960s. During this time, former prisoners banded together to erect a memorial on the site of the camp. The display, which was reworked in 2003, follows the path of new arrivals to the camp. Two of the barracks have been rebuilt and one shows a cross-section of the entire history of the camp since the original barracks had to be torn down due to their poor condition when the memorial was built. The other 30 barracks are indicated by low cement curbs filled with pebbles.

==In media==
* In his 2013 autobiography, &quot;&quot;, in the chapter entitled, &quot;Dachau&quot;, author Robert B. Sherman chronicles his experiences as an American Army serviceman during the initial hours of Dachau&#x27;s liberation.
* In Lewis Black&#x27;s first book, &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Sacred&quot;, he mentions visiting the camp as part of his tour of Europe and how it looked all cleaned up and spiffy, &quot;like some delightful holiday camp&quot;, and only the crematorium building showed any sign of the horror that went on there.
* In &quot;Maus&quot;, Vladek describes his time interned at Dachau, among his time at other concentration camps. He describes the journey to Dachau in over-crowded trains, trading rations for other goods and favors to stay alive, and contracting typhus.
* &quot;Frontline&quot;: &quot;Memory of the Camps&quot; (7 May 1985, Season 3, Episode 18), is a 56-minute television documentary that addresses Dachau and other Nazi concentration camps

<doc id="355853" wikidata="Q56219" url="?curid=355853" title="Rocco Siffredi">
<text>Rocco Antonio Tano (born 4 May 1964), known professionally as Rocco Siffredi, is an Italian pornographic actor, director, and producer. Known as the &quot;Italian Stallion&quot;, Siffredi has starred in more than 1,300 pornographic films since 1986. 

Siffredi is known for his rough style of pornography, often involving anal sex, spitting, slapping and choking, his collaboration with the pornographic studio Evil Angel, as well as his own productions.

== Pornography career ==
Siffredi first got to the idea to work in the porn business after discovering a pornographic magazine as a teenager. He moved to Paris in his early twenties and attended different sex clubs where he was eventually discovered by French porn actor and director Gabriel Pontello, who introduced him to other producers. Siffredi made his pornographic debut in the 1986 film &quot;Sodopunition pour dépravées sexuelles&quot;. He took his stage name from the character Roch Siffredi played by Alain Delon in the French gangster film &quot;Borsalino&quot; (1970). 

Siffredi briefly stepped away from porn in the late 1980s and worked as a fashion model, but returned to the business with the help of porn actress Teresa Orlowski. Siffredi went on to perform in both plot-based and gonzo-style pornography, with styles of sex ranging from ordinary to extreme. Siffredi&#x27;s performances involving anal sex and anilingus, as well as rough sex and his psychological intensity and athleticism, earned him recognition and ultimately a cult following.

Through his collaboration with John Stagliano&#x27;s Evil Angel studio and his own Budapest-based Rocco Siffredi Produzioni as both a performer and director, Siffredi became one of the most influential and recognizable personalities in pornography. &quot;Rocco has far more power in this industry than any actress&quot;, Stagliano commented in 2001. Siffredi has credited Stagliano with being his mentor through all 30 years of his career. Actress Bobbi Starr noted of Siffredi, &quot;Any girl in the industry who has been with him... will tell you that they have done things with him that they [would] never do with anyone else.&quot; Speaking of his female partners, Siffredi says, &quot;I want to see emotion... fear... excitement... the eyes going up from being surprised.&quot;

=== Retirements and comebacks ===

In June 2004, Siffredi declared that he would retire from performing in porn for the sake of his children, and instead focus on direction and production. &quot;My children are growing up&quot;, he said, &quot;and I can no longer just say &#x27;Dad is going to work to make money for the family&#x27;. They want to know more.&quot; Regarding Siffredi&#x27;s long career, Axel Braun commented, &quot;The problem is that he&#x27;s been trying for years to find an &#x27;heir to the throne&#x27;, but it&#x27;s no easy task. He thought he found him in Nacho Vidal, but then Nacho went his own way.&quot;

Siffredi, while continuing to direct, was largely absent as an on-screen performer for nearly five years. However, sexual frustration and disappointment as a director with his male talent and the state of the porn industry overall led Siffredi to return as a performer in 2009. Despite renewed success, Siffredi announced his retirement once again in 2015, shortly after appearing on the Italian reality television show &quot;L&#x27;isola dei famosi&quot; (&quot;The Celebrity Island&quot;), which saw him stranded naked and alone on a beach for one week. He was reported to have told a friend, &quot;I never felt so naked as I did then. I was all alone and it gave me a lot of time to think about what is important. And I realised I don&#x27;t want to lose my wife.&quot; In 2015, he told the press, &quot;More than a year ago I started to get uncomfortable in the front of the camera...Something inside of me has changed.&quot; 

Siffredi would later continue to perform in various pornographic films and his own casting series&quot;.&quot; In 2020, his cousin and long-time collaborator Gabriel Zero died. Siffredi subsequently announced the possibility of collaborating with his son Lorenzo on productions. In late 2022, Siffredi announced that he had stopped performing in scenes, but stated that he had not retired and noted &quot;I don&#x27;t say &#x27;I&#x27;m retiring&#x27; anymore&quot; due to previous retirements and comebacks. He returned to performing for his &quot;4 Cams POV&quot; series in 2023. 

== In mainstream media ==

Siffredi is one of a few porn actors to enjoy crossover appeal and success with respect to other segments of the adult film industry, as well as some in mainstream media.

In 1999, he appeared in the controversial Catherine Breillat film &quot;Romance&quot;. His performance in this role was followed by a part specifically written for him by the same director in her 2003 film &quot;Anatomie de L&#x27;enfer&quot; (&quot;Anatomy of Hell&quot;), in which he played a gay man who became sexually involved with a woman. Both films featured unsimulated sexual scenes involving Siffredi, although it is disputed whether he actually had intercourse with co-star Caroline Ducey in &quot;Romance&quot; (she said no, Siffredi said yes). In 2012, he made a cameo as himself in the successful French comedy &quot;Porn in the Hood&quot;.

Siffredi is also visible in non-pornographic roles on Italian television, including television commercials for Amica Chips, a snack food, which have spawned considerable controversy and have at one point been taken off the air, a Cielo show, &quot;Ci pensa Rocco&quot;, and a La5 docu-reality series, &quot;Casa Siffredi&quot;.

In 1997, Italian band Elio e le Storie Tese dedicated a song and a video, &quot;Rocco e Le Storie Tese&quot;, to Siffredi. Siffredi directed the video, in addition to appearing in it. He later sang a duet with the band on the song &quot;Un bacio piccolissimo&quot; at the 63rd edition of the Sanremo Music Festival in 2013. Siffredi appeared as himself in a cameo in the 2018 Italian comedy film &quot;Natale a cinque stelle&quot;.

In June 2023, Siffredi featured in the Spring-Summer 2024 runway show of Milan-based fashion brand Dsquared², playing the role of a pornographic movie director.

== Personal life ==

Siffredi is married to Rosa Caracciolo (born Rózsa Tassi), a Hungarian model whom he met in 1993 in Cannes and with whom he performed two years later in &quot;Tarzan X: Shame of Jane.&quot; Together they have two sons, Lorenzo and Leonardo. 

During his initial retirement starting in 2004, Siffredi battled sex addiction, disappearing from home for days to have sex, including with trans women, seniors and men. Upon his decision to return to on-screen pornographic performance in 2009, Siffredi recounted, &quot;I spoke with my wife and she said it&#x27;s my problem only, it doesn&#x27;t belong to her and the boys. And she said, &#x27;You decided to stop; we never asked you. So if you want to go back, just go back. However, after a long period of intensive performing, with much time away from his home in Italy, Siffredi announced his retirement again in 2015 for the sake of his marriage. &quot;Today I can see, my wife, she is the top priority&quot;, he said in a press statement. &quot;She deserves to have what she wanted from day one, to be with only me without sharing with other girls.&quot; Caracciolo told the press, &quot;I know him very well and I love him for who and what he is. Let&#x27;s see what the new version of him will be like.&quot;

Siffredi discussed his personal life in 2015 on the reality television show &quot;L&#x27;isola dei famosi&quot; (&quot;The Celebrity Island&quot;). Speaking of his sexuality, Siffredi discussed his sex addiction as emerging from &quot;some kind of devil in me&quot; and spoke of himself, &quot;[It] sometimes sends me out of my mind.&quot; He discussed asking God for intervention from the spirit of his mother, whose photograph he always carries. He considers himself &quot;a believer in God&quot;.

<text>Deoband is a town and a municipality in Saharanpur district in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India, about 150 km (93 miles) from Delhi. Darul Uloom Deoband, an Islamic seminary and one of the largest Islamic Institutions of India is located there.

== Etymology ==
The native Hindi-Urdu name for the place is &quot;Devband&quot;. According to one theory, it derives from &quot;devi&quot; (goddess) and &quot;van&quot; (forest), when this place was full of forests in the Mahabharata-era. A related argument is that it is derived from &quot;devi&quot; and &quot;vandan&quot; (praise), referring to the local Durga temples.

An apocryphal legend states that it gets its name from daeva (demon) and band (imprison), the story being that prophet Suleiman had imprisoned wicked demons here.

==History==
The 16th century Bhakti saint 
Shri Hith Harivansh Mahaprabhu and the founder of the Radhavallabh Sampradaya of Vaishnavism based in Vrindavan, lived in Deoband before his renunciation. He also established a temple here, dedicated to Radha-Krishna and named it &quot;Radha-Navrangilal&quot;.

Deoband is listed in the Ain-i-Akbari as a pargana under Saharanpur sarkar, producing a revenue of 6,477,977 dams for the imperial treasury and supplying a force of 300 infantry and 60 cavalry. It had a brick fort at the time.

The Darul Uloom Deoband learning centre was established on 21 May 1866 by Fazlur Rahman Usmani, Sayyid Muhammad Abid, Muhammad Qasim Nanotawi, Mehtab Ali, Nehal Ahmad and Zulfiqar Ali Deobandi. The Deobandi Islamic movement originated in the Darul Uloom.
==Geography==
Deoband is located at . It has an average elevation of .

==Demographics==
Deoband has a population of 97,037 of which 53,538 are males while 43,499 are females as per the report released by Census India 2011. The population of children aged zero–six is 12,200 which is 12.57% of the total population. The sex ratio is 812 females per 1000 males against the state average of 912. The child sex ratio in Deoband is around 917 compared to the Uttar Pradesh state average of 902. The effective literacy rate (for population seven years and above) is 75.23%, higher than the state average of 67.68% with male literacy of 79.59% and the female literacy rate is 69.77%. Out of the total population, 24,559 were engaged in work or business activity. Of this, 22,551 were males while 2,008 were females and 89.91% were engaged in main work. The Scheduled Caste population was 3,576. Deoband had a total of 16,530 households in 2011.

Deoband Nagar Palika Parishad has a total administration over 15,630 houses to which it supplies basic amenities like water and sewage. It is also authorized to build roads within Nagar Palika Parishad limits and impose taxes on properties coming under its jurisdiction.

<doc id="355859" wikidata="Q408028" url="?curid=355859" title="Epoxide">
<text>In organic chemistry, an epoxide is a cyclic ether, where the ether forms a three-atom ring: two atoms of carbon and one atom of oxygen. This triangular structure has substantial ring strain, making epoxides highly reactive, more so than other ethers. They are produced on a large scale for many applications. In general, low molecular weight epoxides are colourless and nonpolar, and often volatile.

==Nomenclature==
A compound containing the epoxide functional group can be called an epoxy, epoxide, oxirane, and ethoxyline. Simple epoxides are often referred to as oxides. Thus, the epoxide of ethylene (C2H4) is ethylene oxide (C2H4O). Many compounds have trivial names; for instance, ethylene oxide is called &quot;oxirane&quot;. Some names emphasize the presence of the epoxide functional group, as in the compound &quot;1,2-epoxyheptane&quot;, which can also be called &quot;1,2-heptene oxide&quot;.

A polymer formed from epoxide precursors is called an &quot;epoxy&quot;. However, few if any of the epoxy groups in the resin survive the curing process.

==Synthesis==
The dominant epoxides industrially are ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, which are produced respectively on the scales of approximately 15 and 3 million tonnes/year. 

Aside from ethylene oxide, most epoxides are generated when peroxidized reagents donate a single oxygen atom to an alkene. Safety considerations weigh on these reactions because organic peroxides are prone to spontaneous decomposition or even combustion. 

Both t-butyl hydroperoxide and ethylbenzene hydroperoxide can be used as oxygen sources during propylene oxidation (although a catalyst is required as well, and most industrial producers use dehydrochlorination instead).

===Ethylene oxidation===
The ethylene oxide industry generates its product from reaction of ethylene and oxygen. Modified heterogeneous silver catalysts are typically employed. According to a reaction mechanism suggested in 1974 at least one ethylene molecule is totally oxidized for every six that are converted to ethylene oxide: &lt;chem display=block&gt;7 H2C=CH2 + 6 O2 -&gt; 6 C2H4O + 2 CO2 + 2 H2O&lt;/chem&gt; 

Only ethylene produces an epoxide during incomplete combustion. Other alkenes fail to react usefully, even propylene, though TS-1 supported Au catalysts can selectively epoxidize propylene.

===Organic peroxides and metal catalysts===
Metal complexes are useful catalysts for epoxidations involving hydrogen peroxide and alkyl hydroperoxides. Metal-catalyzed epoxidations were first explored using tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP). Association of TBHP with the metal (M) generates the active metal peroxy complex containing the MOOR group, which then transfers an O center to the alkene.
Vanadium(II) oxide catalyzes the epoxidation at specifically less-substituted alkenes. 

===Nucleophilic epoxidation===
Electron-deficient olefins, such as enones and acryl derivatives can be epoxidized using nucleophilic oxygen compounds such as peroxides. The reaction is a two-step mechanism. First the oxygen performs a nucleophilic conjugate addition to give a stabilized carbanion. This carbanion then attacks the same oxygen atom, displacing a leaving group from it, to close the epoxide ring.

===Transfer from peroxycarboxylic acids===
Peroxycarboxylic acids, which are more electrophilic than other peroxides, convert alkenes to epoxides without the intervention of metal catalysts. In specialized applications, dioxirane reagents (e.g. dimethyldioxirane) perform similarly, but are more explosive. 

Typical laboratory operations employ the Prilezhaev reaction. This approach involves the oxidation of the alkene with a peroxyacid such as &quot;m&quot;CPBA. Illustrative is the epoxidation of styrene with perbenzoic acid to styrene oxide:

The stereochemistry of the reaction is quite sensitive. Depending on the mechanism of the reaction and the geometry of the alkene starting material, &quot;cis&quot; and/or &quot;trans&quot; epoxide diastereomers may be formed. In addition, if there are other stereocenters present in the starting material, they can influence the stereochemistry of the epoxidation. 

The reaction proceeds via what is commonly known as the &quot;Butterfly Mechanism&quot;. The peroxide is viewed as an electrophile, and the alkene a nucleophile. The reaction is considered to be concerted. The butterfly mechanism allows ideal positioning of the sigma star orbital for π electrons to attack. Because two bonds are broken and formed to the epoxide oxygen, this is formally an example of a coarctate transition state.

===Asymmetric epoxidations===
Chiral epoxides can often be derived enantioselectively from prochiral alkenes. Many metal complexes give active catalysts, and the most important involve titanium, vanadium, or molybdenum.

Hydroperoxides are also employed in catalytic enantioselective epoxidations, such as the Sharpless epoxidation and the Jacobsen epoxidation. Together with the Shi epoxidation, these reactions are useful for the enantioselective synthesis of chiral epoxides. Oxaziridine reagents may also be used to generate epoxides from alkenes.

The Sharpless epoxidation reaction is one of the premier enantioselective chemical reactions. It is used to prepare 2,3-epoxyalcohols from primary and secondary allylic alcohols. 
The above reactions all use electrophilic reagents, but some asymmetric nucleophilic epoxidations are possible.

===Dehydrohalogenation and other γ eliminations===

Halohydrins react with base to give epoxides. The reaction is spontaneous because the energetic cost of introducing the ring strain (13 kcal/mol) is offset by the larger bond enthalpy of the newly introduced C-O bond (when compared to that of the cleaved C-halogen bond). 

Formation of epoxides from secondary halohydrins is predicted to occur faster than from primary halohydrins due to increased entropic effects in the secondary halohydrin, and tertiary halohydrins react (if at all) extremely slowly due to steric crowding.
Starting with propylene chlorohydrin, most of the world&#x27;s supply of propylene oxide arises via this route. 
An intramolecular epoxide formation reaction is one of the key steps in the Darzens reaction.

In the Johnson–Corey–Chaykovsky reaction epoxides are generated from carbonyl groups and sulfonium ylides. In this reaction, a sulfonium is the leaving group instead of chloride.

===Biosynthesis===
Epoxides are uncommon in nature. They arise usually via oxygenation of alkenes by the action of cytochrome P450. (but see also the short-lived epoxyeicosatrienoic acids which act as signalling molecules. and similar epoxydocosapentaenoic acids, and epoxyeicosatetraenoic acids.)

Arene oxides are intermediates in the oxidation of arenes by cytochrome P450. For prochiral arenes (naphthalene, toluene, benzoates, benzopyrene), the epoxides are often obtained in high enantioselectivity.

== Reactions ==
Ring-opening reactions dominate the reactivity of epoxides.

===Hydrolysis and addition of nucleophiles===
Epoxides react with a broad range of nucleophiles, for example, alcohols, water, amines, thiols, and even halides. With two often-nearly-equivalent sites of attack, epoxides exemplify &quot;ambident substrates&quot;. Ring-opening regioselectivity in asymmetric epoxides generally follows the SN2 pattern of attack at the least-substituted carbon, but can be affected by carbocation stability under acidic conditions. This class of reactions is the basis of epoxy glues and the production of glycols.

Lithium aluminium hydride or aluminium hydride both reduce epoxides through a simple nucleophilic addition of hydride (H−); they produce the corresponding alcohol.

===Polymerization and oligomerization===
Polymerization of epoxides gives polyethers. For example ethylene oxide polymerizes to give polyethylene glycol, also known as polyethylene oxide. The reaction of an alcohol or a phenol with ethylene oxide, ethoxylation, is widely used to produce surfactants:
:ROH + n C2H4O → R(OC2H4)nOH

With anhydrides, epoxides give polyesters.

===Metallation and deoxygenation===
Lithiation cleaves the ring to β-lithioalkoxides.

Epoxides can be deoxygenated using oxophilic reagents, with loss or retention of configuration. The combination of tungsten hexachloride and &quot;n&quot;-butyllithium gives the alkene.

When treated with thiourea, epoxides convert to the episulfide (thiiranes).

===Other reactions===
* Epoxides undergo ring expansion reactions, illustrated by the insertion of carbon dioxide to give cyclic carbonates.
* An epoxide adjacent to an alcohol can undergo the Payne rearrangement in base.

==Uses==
Ethylene oxide is widely used to generate detergents and surfactants by ethoxylation. Its hydrolysis affords ethylene glycol. It is also used for sterilisation of medical instruments and materials.

The reaction of epoxides with amines is the basis for the formation of epoxy glues and structural materials. A typical amine-hardener is triethylenetetramine (TETA).

==Safety==
Epoxides are alkylating agents, making many of them highly toxic.

<text>The Slovene alphabet or Slovenian alphabet (, or &quot;slovenska gajica&quot; ) is an extension of the Latin script used to write Slovene. The standard language uses a Latin alphabet which is a slight modification of the Croatian Gaj&#x27;s Latin alphabet, consisting of 25 lower- and upper-case letters:

==Characters==
The following Latin letters are also found separately alphabetized in words of non-Slovene origin: Ć (mehki č), Đ (dže), Q (ku), W (dvojni ve), X (iks), and Y (ipsilon).
==Diacritics==
To compensate for the shortcomings of the standard orthography, Slovenian also uses standardized diacritics or accent marks to denote stress, vowel length and pitch accent, much like the closely related Serbo-Croatian. However, as in Serbo-Croatian, use of such accent marks is restricted to dictionaries, language textbooks and linguistic publications. In normal writing, the diacritics are almost never used, except in a few minimal pairs where real ambiguity could arise.

Two different and mutually incompatible systems of diacritics are used. The first is the simpler non-tonemic system, which can be applied to all Slovene dialects. It is more widely used and is the standard representation in dictionaries such as SSKJ. The tonemic system also includes tone as part of the representation. However, neither system reliably distinguishes schwa from the front mid-vowels, nor vocalised l from regular l . Some sources write these as &quot;ə&quot; and &quot;ł&quot;, respectively, but this is not as common.

=== Non-tonemic diacritics ===
In the non-tonemic system, the distinction between the two mid-vowels is indicated, as well as the placement of stress and length of vowels:

* Long stressed vowels are notated with an acute diacritic: &quot;á é í ó ú ŕ&quot; (IPA: ).
* However, the rarer long stressed low-mid vowels and are notated with a circumflex: &quot;ê ô&quot;.
* Short stressed vowels are notated with a grave: &quot;à è ì ò ù&quot; (IPA: ). Some systems may also include &quot;ə̀&quot; for .

=== Tonemic diacritics ===
The tonemic system uses the diacritics somewhat differently from the non-tonemic system. The high-mid vowels and are written &quot;ẹ ọ&quot; with a subscript dot, while the low-mid vowels and are written as plain &quot;e o&quot;.

Pitch accent and length is indicated by four diacritical marks:

* The acute ( ´ ) indicates long and low pitch: &quot;á é ẹ́ í ó ọ́ ú ŕ&quot; (IPA: ).
* The inverted breve (  ̑ ) indicates long and high pitch: &quot;ȃ ȇ ẹ̑ ȋ ȏ ọ̑ ȗ ȓ&quot; (IPA: ).
* The grave ( ` ) indicates short and low pitch. This occurs only on &quot;è&quot; (IPA: ), optionally written as &quot;ə̀&quot;.
* The double grave (  ̏ ) indicates short and high pitch: &quot;ȁ ȅ ȉ ȍ ȕ&quot; (IPA: á ɛ́ í ɔ́ ú). &quot;ȅ&quot; is also used for , optionally written as &quot;ə̏&quot;.

The schwa vowel is written ambiguously as &quot;e&quot;, but its accentuation will sometimes distinguish it: a long vowel mark can never appear on a schwa, while a grave accent can appear only on a schwa. Thus, only &quot;ȅ&quot; and unstressed &quot;e&quot; are truly ambiguous.

=== Others ===
The writing in its usual form uses additional accentual marks, which are used to disambiguate similar words with different meanings. For example:

*gòl (&quot;naked&quot;) | gól (&quot;goal&quot;),
*jêsen (&quot;ash (tree)&quot;) | jesén (&quot;autumn&quot;),
*kót (&quot;angle&quot;, &quot;corner&quot;) | kot (&quot;as&quot;, &quot;like&quot;),
*kózjak (&quot;goat&#x27;s dung&quot;) | kozják (&quot;goat-shed&quot;),
*med (&quot;between&quot;) | méd (&quot;brass&quot;) | méd (&quot;honey&quot;),
*pól (&quot;pole&quot;) | pól (&quot;half (of)&quot;) | pôl (&quot;expresses a half an hour before the given hour&quot;),
*prècej (&quot;at once&quot;) | precéj (&quot;a great deal (of)&quot;)),
*remí (&quot;draw&quot;) | rémi (&quot;rummy (- a card game)&quot;),
*je (&quot;he/she is&quot;) | jé (&quot;he/she eats&quot;).

== Foreign words ==

There are 5 letters for vowels (a, e, i, o, u) and 20 for consonants. The letters q, w, x, y are excluded from the standard spelling, as are some Serbo-Croatian graphemes (ć, đ), however they are collated as independent letters in some encyclopedias and dictionary listings; foreign proper nouns or toponyms are often not adapted to Slovene orthography as they are in some other Slavic languages, such as partly in Russian or entirely in the Serbian standard of Serbo-Croatian.

In addition, the graphemes ö and ü are used in certain non-standard dialect spellings (usually representing loanwords from German, Hungarian or Turkish) – for example, &quot;dödöli&quot; (Prekmurje potato dumplings) and &quot;Danilo Türk&quot; (a politician).

Encyclopedic listings (such as in the 2001 &quot;Slovenski pravopis&quot; and the 2006 &quot;Leksikon SOVA&quot;) use this alphabet:
: a, b, c, č, ć, d, đ, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, š, t, u, v, w, x, y, z, ž.
Therefore, &quot;Newton&quot; and &quot;New York&quot; remain the same and are not transliterated to &quot;Njuton&quot; or &quot;Njujork&quot;; transliterated forms would seem very odd to a Slovene. However, the unit of force is written as &quot;njuton&quot; as well as &quot;newton&quot;. Some place names are transliterated (e.g. Philadelphia – Filadelfija; Hawaii – Havaji). Other names from non-Latin languages are transliterated in a fashion similar to that used by other European languages, albeit with some adaptations. Japanese, Indonesian and Arabic names such as &quot;Kajibumi&quot;, &quot;Jakarta&quot; and &quot;Jabar&quot; are written as &quot;Kadžibumi&quot;, &quot;Džakarta&quot; and &quot;Džabar&quot;, where j is replaced with dž. Except for ć and đ, graphemes with diacritical marks from other foreign alphabets (e.g., ä, å, æ, ç, ë, ï, ń, ö, ß, ş, ü) are not used as independent letters.

== History ==

The modern alphabet (&quot;abeceda&quot;) was standardised in the mid-1840s from an arrangement of the Croatian national reviver and leader Ljudevit Gaj which would become the Croatian alphabet, and was in turn patterned on the Czech alphabet. Before the current alphabet became standard, š was, for example, written as ʃ, ʃʃ or ſ; č as tʃch, cz, tʃcz or tcz; i sometimes as y as a relic of the letter now rendered as Ы (&quot;yery&quot;) in modern Russian; j as y; l as ll; v as w; ž as ʃ, ʃʃ or ʃz.

In the old alphabet used by most distinguished writers, the Bohorič alphabet (&quot;bohoričica&quot;), developed by Adam Bohorič, the characters č, š and ž would be spelt as zh, ſh and sh respectively, and c, s and z would be spelt as z, ſ and s respectively. To remedy this, so that there was a one-to-one correspondence between sounds and letters, Jernej Kopitar urged the development of a new alphabet.

In 1825, Franc Serafin Metelko proposed his version of the alphabet (the Metelko alphabet, &quot;metelčica&quot;). However, it was banned in 1833 in favour of the Bohorič alphabet after the so-called &quot;Suit of the Letters&quot; (&quot;Črkarska pravda&quot;) (1830–1833), which was won by France Prešeren and Matija Čop. Another alphabet, the Dajnko alphabet (&quot;dajnčica&quot;), was developed by Peter Dajnko in 1824, but did not catch on as widely as the Metelko alphabet; it was banned in 1838 because it mixed Latin and Cyrillic characters, which was seen as a poor way to handle missing characters.

Gaj&#x27;s Latin alphabet (&quot;gajica&quot;) was adopted afterwards, although it still fails to distinguish all the phonemes of Slovene.

== Computer encoding ==

The preferred character encodings (writing codes) for Slovene texts are UTF-8 (Unicode), UTF-16, and ISO/IEC 8859-2 (Latin-2), which generally supports Central and Eastern European languages that are written in the Latin script.

In the original ASCII frame of 1 to 126 characters one can find these examples of writing text in Slovene:

: a, b, c, *c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, r, s, *s, t, u, v, z, *z
: a, b, c, &quot;c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, r, s, &quot;s, t, u, v, z, &quot;z
: a, b, c, c(, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, r, s, s(, t, u, v, z, z(
: a, b, c, c^, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, r, s, s^, t, u, v, z, z^
: a, b, c, cx, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, r, s, sx, t, u, v, z, zx

In ISO/IEC 8859-1 (Latin-1) typical workarounds for missing characters Č (č), Š (š), and Ž (ž) can be C~ (c~), S~ (s~), Z~ (z~) or similar as for ASCII encoding.

For usage under DOS and Microsoft Windows also code pages 852 and Windows-1250 respectively fully supported Slovene alphabet.

In TeX notation, č, š and ž become \v c, \v s, \v z, \v{c}, \v{s}, \v{z} or in their macro versions, &quot;c, &quot;s and &quot;z, or in other representations as \~, \{, \&#x27; for lowercase and \^, \[, \@ for uppercase.

The IETF language tags have assigned variants to the different orthographies of Slovene:
* (Bohoric alphabet)
* (Dajnko alphabet)
* (Metelko alphabet)
* (Standardized Resian orthography).

<doc id="355861" wikidata="Q16828519" url="?curid=355861" title="The Crystal Set">
<text>The Crystal Set were an Australian indie rock group formed in March 1983. By 1987 the line-up was Russell Kilbey (bass and lead vocals), Phillip Maher (guitar and vocals), Davey Ray Moor (keyboards and vocals) and Tim Seckhold (drums). In April 1988 Moor was replaced by Craig Hooper, who was replaced in turn by Luke Blackburn, in May 1989. The group issued two studio albums, &quot;From Now On&quot; (May 1987) and &quot;Almost Pure&quot; (April 1991), before disbanding later that year. Russell Kilbey is the younger brother of the Church&#x27;s mainstay, Steve Kilbey.

== History ==

The Crystal Set were formed in March 1983 in Sydney by Russell Kilbey on bass guitar and lead vocals, Phillip Maher on lead guitar and vocals, Davey Ray Moor on keyboards and backing vocals, and Charles Ratcliffe on drums. The four members had all attended Copland College in Canberra; Kilbey and Ratcliffe had also been in a local garage band, the Puppets. After &quot;four months of rehearsing, Crystal Set began to play all over Sydney, concentrating its performances in the &#x27;inner-city circuit&#x27; and gradually branching out to country areas such as Bathurst and Newcastle.&quot; Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, felt that they &quot;emerged with a refined, atmospheric brand of psychedelia and rock that drew influences from UK artists as diverse as The Cure and Brian Eno.&quot;

The Crystal Set released their first single, &quot;A Drop in the Ocean&quot;, independently on their own Set label in December 1984. It was &quot;designed, packaged and distributed by the band members themselves.&quot; Moor declared, &quot;We want to gain some independence just like Midnight Oil, before we look for an agent.&quot; By May 1985 they signed to Red Eye Records, which issued their second single, &quot;Benefit of the Doubt&quot;. Ratcliffe had left and they used studio drummers, Mark Evans on the B-side, &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Surprised&quot;, and John Lloyd on the A-side.The single was produced by Guy Gray. The first single was re-issued by Red Eye Records in November. By that time they &quot;had built up a strong cult following around Sydney.&quot;

Tim Seckhold took up the drums in time for the Crystal Set&#x27;s next two singles, &quot;Wholly Holy&quot; (April 1987) and &quot;Who Needs Who Now?&quot; (December), and their debut album, &quot;From Now On&quot; (May). It was produced by Steve Kilbey. The singles were moderate indie hits via airplay on youth radio station, JJJ. &quot;The Canberra Times&quot;″ reviewer critiqued &quot;Who Needs Who Now&quot; and observed that the group &quot;are numbing live, but in the small doses provided by singles they are acceptable. This track is quite likeable and extremely polished for an independent record... Nice production and street credibility, the North Shore girls should love it.&quot;

Moor left in April 1988 and Craig Hooper (ex-the Reels) on keyboards and guitar joined Kilbey, Maher and Seckhold to release a six-track extended play, &quot;Cluster&quot;, in July, which was produced by Hooper. One side featured songs recorded with Moor while the other side featured compositions with Hooper. The group disbanded at the end of that year.

When the Crystal Set reconvened in May 1989 Kilbey assumed guitar duties and vocals; together with Maher and Seckold they were joined by Luke Blackburn on bass guitar and backing vocals. When Red Eye Records signed a distribution deal with Polydor Australia in 1990, the group&#x27;s second album, &quot;Almost Pure&quot; (April 1991), signalled their transition from an independent act to one associated with a major label. It found moderate national success with the singles, &quot;She Spits out Stars&quot; (December 1990) and &quot;Thrive&quot; (June 1991). Their Red Eye/Polydor label mates were the Cruel Sea, the Clouds, Steve Kilbey, Jack Frost (Steve Kilbey and Grant McLennan of the Go-Betweens), the Bhagavad Guitars, Curious (Yellow) and the Beasts of Bourbon.

In 1991 Kilbey and Maher relocated to Melbourne and recruited Darren &quot;Fud&quot; Ryan on drums and Paul Agar on bass and backing vocals as new members. To promote &quot;Almost Pure&quot; the band toured supporting United Kingdom band, the Wonder Stuff, as well as headlining their own shows in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. However the Crystal Set disbanded at the end of 1991.

Russell Kilbey collaborated with David Thrussell from techno-industrial outfit Snog in Sex Industrie. The duo released a cover version of the AC/DC song, &quot;Jailbreak&quot;. The Crystal Set compilation album, &quot;Umbrella&quot;, originally issued in 1989, was re-released on CD with an extra track, &quot;Sea of Misconception&quot;. Russell and Steve Kilbey worked as a duo, Gilt Trip, which issued two albums &quot;Gilt Trip&quot; (1997) and &quot;Egyptian Register&quot;. Russell had also collaborated with another brother, John Kilbey (ex-the Bhagavad Guitars), as Warp Factor 9, which released an album, &quot;5 Days in a Photon Belt&quot; (1993).

<doc id="355863" wikidata="Q1658568" url="?curid=355863" title="John Wolfe Barry">
<text>Sir John Wolfe Barry (7 December 1836 – 22 January 1918), the youngest son of famous architect Sir Charles Barry, was an English civil engineer of the late 19th and early 20th century. His most famous project is Tower Bridge over the River Thames in London which was constructed between 1886 and 1894. After receiving a knighthood in 1897, he added &quot;Wolfe&quot; to his inherited name in 1898 to become Sir John Wolfe Barry.

==Early Years and Education==
Barry was born in London on 7 December 1836. He was the youngest of five sons of the architect Charles Barry and his wife, Sarah Rowsell. He was named after his godfather, the artist John Lewis Wolfe, and would later add ‘Wolfe’ to his surname. 

Barry was educated at Trinity College, Glenalmond and King&#x27;s College, London. 

He was a pupil of civil engineer Sir John Hawkshaw, as was his future business partner Henry Marc Brunel, son of the great Isambard Kingdom Brunel. Barry was assistant resident engineer for Hawkshaw on the Charing Cross and Cannon Street Railways. 

== Career ==
Barry started his own practice in 1867, initially carrying out more work on railway projects signposting a lifelong interest in that area of engineering. Over his career to 1918, he &quot;devoted himself largely to the construction of bridges, railways, and docks.&quot;

=== Partnerships ===
Wolfe Barry&#x27;s friend Henry Brunel had been in practice on his own account from 1871. In 1878 the two men went into partnership. In 1891 Wolfe Barry entered into partnership with his nephew Lt. Col. Arthur John Barry. In 1901, Edward Cruttwell who had been resident engineer on Blackfriars Railway Bridge and Tower Bridge resumed his relationship with Wolfe Barry when he joined Sir John Wolfe Barry and Partners as partner. 

In 1902 Wolfe Barry also joined the consulting firm of Robert White &amp; Partners, which was renamed Wolfe Barry, Robert White &amp; Partners (later, in 1946, renamed Sir Bruce White, Wolfe Barry and Partners). 

At Wolfe Barry&#x27;s death, the partners in his firm, Sir John Wolfe Barry and Partners, were his second son Kenneth Alfred Wolfe Barry, Anthony George Lyster, past president of the Institution of Civil Engineers, and Edward Cruttwell. 

=== Bridge, railway and dock projects ===

==== Bridge projects ====
Tower Bridge made Wolfe Barry&#x27;s name. In 1878, architect Horace Jones first proposed a bascule bridge. An Act of Parliament allowing the Corporation of the City of London to build it was passed in 1885. Jones was appointed architect, and developed an initial scheme for which he was knighted in 1886. Wolfe Barry, already well-established with experience of bridges across the Thames, was introduced as the engineer for the project and with Henry Marc Brunel redesigned the mechanisms resulting in a modified plan. Within a month of construction starting Sir Horace Jones died, leaving Wolfe Barry and Brunel to oversee and complete the works. The bridge was completed in 1894. Wolfe Barry received a CBE for his work on Tower Bridge afterwards being styled Sir John Wolfe Barry. 

Other bridge projects included:

*Cannon Street Railway Bridge (also known as the Alexandra Bridge) (1866)
*Blackfriars Railway Bridge (known as St Paul&#x27;s Bridge until 1937), London (1886)

* Kew Bridge, west London (1903)

==== Railway projects ====
Railways were a particular focus and he was Consulting Engineer on works to, amongst other lines:

* Metropolitan District Railway
* Lewes and East Grinstead Railway
* Metropolitan line and stations
* Barry Docks railways
* underground railways of the Caledonian Railway in Glasgow
* Callander and Oban Railway 

* District line of the London Underground (with Sir John Hawkshaw) 

==== Dock projects ====
Dock projects included:

*Barry Docks (not a namesake) near Cardiff, south Wales
*Lady Windsor Deep Lock and Graving-dock
*Limekiln Wharf
*Grangemouth Dock Extension
* Expansion of Greenland Dock, Surrey Docks (now Surrey Quays), south-east London (1904)
* Middlesbrough Dock Extension
* Immingham Dock (1912)
* Joint Dock, Kingston upon Hull (1914), with Benjamin Baker
* Royal Edward Dock at Avonmouth, also with Benjamin Baker and Mr A C Hurtzig
* No.3 Fish Dock, Grimsby (1934)

==== Other Projects ====
* Pumping stations on the Regent&#x27;s Canal, north London

=== Industry standardisation ===

Barry played a prominent role in the development of industry standardisation, urging the ICE&#x27;s Council to form a committee to focus on standards for iron and steel sections. Two members each from the ICE, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, the Institution of Naval Architects and the Iron and Steel Institute first met on 26 April 1901. With the Institution of Electrical Engineers who joining the following year, these bodies were the founder institutions of what is today the British Standards Institution or BSI. Barry also designed the BSI Kitemark.

In 1917, Barry delivered a lecture to the Institution of Civil Engineers on &quot;The Standardisation of Engineering Materials and its Influence on the Prosperity of the Country.&quot; The effect of the standardisation of the profession he illustrated by reference to rolled steel sections where &quot;at least 85 per cent, and in some cases 95 per cent, were rolled to standard specifications.&quot;

==Public Life==
Barry: &quot;gave ungrudging assistance to all public undertakings and inquiries involving engineering considerations and had great influence in many ways in promoting the industrial and commercial prosperity of the country.&quot; He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1895 and made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in 1897. He was elected President of the Institution of Civil Engineers (Pres.Inst.C.E.) from 1896-97, and was a member of that body for fifty years, being on its council for thirty-four years. He was also a member of the Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers. He chaired the Executive Committee of the City and Guilds of London Institute instituting the need for Civil Engineers to pass an exam for admission to membership of ICE. 

His interests were not limited to engineering though and he was chairman of the council of the Royal Society of Arts from 1898-1899.

Between 1892 and 1906 he represented the British Government alongside Sir Charles Hartley on the International Consultative Committee of the Suez Canal. He helped establish and organise the National Physical Laboratory becoming one of the founding members of its executive committee. He was Chairman of the City and Guilds Institute, and for twenty years of Westminster Hospital.

He was chairman of Cable and Wireless from 1900 to 1917.

Between 1903-1905 he was a member of the Royal Commission on London Traffic.

His obituary from the Institution of Civil Engineers noted that &quot;His death was a national loss, and it was recognized as such...for years before his death he was the acknowledged head and representative of the [engineering] profession in Britain.&quot;
==Personal life==

He had married Rosalind Grace, the daughter of Rev Evan Edward Rowsell of Hambledon, Surrey. They had four sons and three daughters. In 1922 a memorial window designed by Sir John Ninian Comper was dedicated to his memory in the nave of Westminster Abbey.

He added the name Wolfe to his forename after receiving an inheritance from his godfather, the architect John Lewis Wolfe (1798–1881).

Wolfe Barry published the results of an investigation into his family&#x27;s genealogy in 1906.

Wolfe Barry died on 22 January 1918 aged 82, and was buried in Brookwood Cemetery near Woking in Surrey.

<text>A Town Like Alice (United States title: &quot;The Legacy&quot;) is a romance novel by Nevil Shute, published in 1950 when Shute had newly settled in Australia. Jean Paget, a young Englishwoman, becomes romantically interested in a fellow prisoner of World War II in Malaya, and after liberation emigrates to Australia to be with him, where she attempts, by investing her substantial financial inheritance, to generate economic prosperity in a small outback community—to turn it into &quot;a town like Alice&quot; i.e. Alice Springs.

==Plot summary==
The story falls broadly into three parts.

In post-World War II London, Jean Paget, a secretary in a leather goods factory, is informed by solicitor Noel Strachan that she has inherited a considerable sum of money from an uncle she never knew. But the solicitor is now her trustee and she only has the use of the income until she inherits absolutely, at the age of thirty-five, several years in the future. In the firm&#x27;s interest, but increasingly with personal interest, Strachan acts as her guide and advisor. Jean decides that her priority is to build a well in a Malayan village.

The second part of the story flashes back to Jean&#x27;s experiences during the war, when she was working in Malaya at the time the Japanese invaded and was taken prisoner together with a group of women and children. As she speaks Malay fluently, Jean takes a leading role in the group of prisoners. The Japanese refuse all responsibility for the group and march them from one village to another. Many of them, not used to physical hardship, die. 

Jean meets an Australian soldier, Sergeant Joe Harman, also a prisoner, who is driving a lorry for the Japanese and they strike up a friendship. He steals food and medicines to help them. Jean is carrying a toddler, whose mother has died, and this leads Harman to believe that she is married; to avoid complications, Jean does not correct this assumption. On one occasion, Harman steals five chickens from the local Japanese commander. The thefts are investigated and Harman takes the blame to save Jean and the rest of the group. He is beaten, crucified, and left to die by the Japanese soldiers. The women are marched away, believing that he is dead.

When their sole Japanese guard dies, the women become part of a Malayan village community. They live and work there for three years, until the war ends and they are repatriated.

Now a wealthy woman (at least on paper), Jean decides she wants to build a well for the village so that the women will not have to walk so far to collect water: &quot;A gift by women, for women&quot;. Strachan arranges for her to travel to Malaya, where she goes back to the village and persuades the headman to allow her to build the well. While it is being built, she discovers that, by a strange chance, Joe Harman survived and returned to Australia. She decides to search for him. On her travels, she visits the town of Alice Springs, where Joe lived before the war, and is much impressed with the quality of life there. She then travels to the (fictional) primitive town of Willstown in the Queensland outback, where Joe has become manager of a cattle station. She soon discovers that the quality of life in &quot;Alice&quot; is an anomaly, and life for a woman in the outback is elsewhere very rugged. Willstown is described as &quot;a fair cow&quot;.

Meanwhile, Joe has met a pilot who helped repatriate the women, from whom he learns that Jean survived the war and that she was never married. He travels to London to find her, using money won in the Golden Casket lottery. He finds his way to Strachan&#x27;s office, but is told that she has gone travelling in the Far East. Disappointed, he gets drunk and is arrested, but is bailed out by Strachan. Without revealing Jean&#x27;s actual whereabouts, Strachan persuades Joe to return home by ship and intimates that he may well receive a great surprise there.

While staying in Willstown, awaiting Joe&#x27;s return, Jean learns that most young girls have to leave the town to find work in the bigger cities. Having worked with a firm in Britain that produced crocodile-leather luxury goods, she gets the idea of founding a local workshop to make shoes from the skins of crocodiles hunted in the outback. With the help of Joe and of Noel Strachan, who releases money from her inheritance, she starts the workshop, followed by a string of other businesses; an ice-cream parlour, a public swimming pool and shops.

The third part of the book shows how Jean&#x27;s entrepreneurship gives a decisive economic impact to develop Willstown into &quot;a town like Alice&quot;; also, Jean&#x27;s help in rescuing an injured stockman breaks down many local barriers.

A few years later, an aged Strachan visits Willstown to see the results of Jean&#x27;s efforts. He reveals that the money which Jean inherited was originally made in an Australian gold rush, and he is satisfied to see the money returning to the site of its making. Jean and Joe name their second son Noel and ask Strachan to be his godfather. They invite Strachan to make his home with them in Australia, but he declines the invitation and returns to Britain.

==Characters==
*Jean Paget – a young Englishwoman who is taken as a prisoner of war by the Japanese during their invasion of Malaya in 1941 and later finds love with an Australian man she first met as a prisoner in Malaya and with whom she eventually settles in the Australian outback.
*Joe Harman – an Australian cattleman who is a prisoner of war in Malaya; he survives torture and crucifixion in the hands of Japanese Captain Sugamo and eventually gets back to his home in Australia.
*Noel Strachan – the narrator; he is firstly Douglas MacFadden&#x27;s solicitor and responsible for drafting his will which names Jean Paget as a beneficiary, and establishes him as the eventual co-trustee of the significant estate that Douglas MacFadden leaves to Jean.
*Donald Paget – Jean Paget&#x27;s brother who lived and worked in Malaya before the war, and who died as a prisoner of war of the Japanese, working as a slave labourer on the &quot;Death Railway&quot; of &quot;The Bridge over the River Kwai&quot; fame. His death leaves Jean as the sole beneficiary of her uncle&#x27;s estate.
*Douglas MacFadden – Jean and Donald Paget&#x27;s uncle, a resident of Ayr, Scotland, whose death in 1948 initiates the chain of events that form the basis of the book&#x27;s narrative.

==Historical accuracy==
In a note to the text, Shute wrote that a forced march of women by the Japanese did indeed take place during World War II, but the women in question were Dutch, not British as in the novel, and the march was in Sumatra, not Malaya. Jean Paget was based on Carry Geysel (Mrs J. G. Geysel-Vonck), whom Shute met while visiting Sumatra in 1949. Geysel had been one of a group of about 80 Dutch civilians taken prisoner by Japanese forces at Padang, in the Dutch East Indies in 1942. Shute&#x27;s understanding was that the women were forced to march around Sumatra for two-and-a-half years, covering , with fewer than 30 people surviving the march. However, the Nevil Shute Foundation states that this was a misunderstanding, and that the women were merely transported from prison camp to prison camp by the Japanese. &quot;Shute, fortunately misinformed about parts of her experience, mistakenly understands that the women were made to walk. This was possibly the luckiest misunderstanding of his life...&quot; says the Foundation.

Shute based the character of Harman on Herbert James &quot;Ringer&quot; Edwards, whom Shute met in 1948 at a station (ranch) in Queensland. Edwards, an Australian veteran of the Malayan campaign, had been crucified for 63 hours by Japanese soldiers on the Burma Railway. He had later escaped execution a second time, when his &quot;last meal&quot; of chicken and beer could not be obtained. Crucifixion (or &quot;haritsuke&quot;) was a form of punishment or torture that the Japanese sometimes used against prisoners during the war.

The fictional &quot;Willstown&quot; is reportedly based on Burketown and Normanton in Queensland, which Shute visited in 1948. (Burke and Wills were well-known explorers of Australia.)

<text>Baillif (; ) is a commune of Guadeloupe, an overseas region and department of France located in the Lesser Antilles. Baillif is a suburb of Basse-Terre, the prefecture and the second-largest urban area of Guadeloupe located on Basse-Terre Island (the western half of Guadeloupe).

==History==
In 1637, Governor De L&#x27;Olive conceded a parcel of land to the Dominican friars, from the Fathers&#x27; river to that of Baillif, and today these mark out the boundary of the town. Under the leadership of Father Labat, several fortresses were built in Baillif to protect the region from English invasion. The Dominicans came to preach the good news of Jesus.

Following the defeat of Napoleon in the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, the governor of Guadeloupe, the Comte de Linois refused to surrender his position to the Bourbon-appointed governor of the Windward Islands, the Comte de Vaugiraud, and believed the stories of Napoleon&#x27;s defeat to be propaganda and lies. As such, de Vaugiraud invited the British to invade the island. The ensuing battle on August 8 between the joint Bourbon and British invasion force against the Napoleonic garrison took place at Baillif in which the Napoleonic loyalists where defeated and forced Linois to capitulate.

The commune is named after an early inhabitant, Robert Baillif. Baillif traded in the area from 1650 to about 1700. Today, Baillif is often considered to be a suburb of the prefecture of Guadeloupe, Basse-Terre, and with its small regional airfield, it acts as a gateway to the islands in the south. Marie-Yveline Théobald-Ponchateau was elected mayor (maire) of Baillif in 2020.

==Geography==
Baillif is situated on the south-west coast of Basse-Terre Island and it covers an area of . It faces the Caribbean Sea. The town is west of Basse-Terre&#x27;s mountain range. The capital of Guadeloupe, Basse-Terre, is south of Baillif, and Vieux-Habitants, a village, is located north. La riviere de Père flows halfway between Baillif and Basse-Terre.

===Climate===
Like any other Eastern Caribbean settlement, Baillif experiences quite evenly spread rainfall during the year, with a wetter season between July and November which coincides with hurricane season. Guadeloupe has been struck by many hurricanes which have caused devastation. The town receives below 1500 mm of rainfall. Tropical heat is the norm, bringing constant highs of around 32 °C (89 °F) that drop to 20 °C (68 °F) at night.

Trade winds, called alizés, blow from the northeast and often temper the climate.

==Population==
The inhabitants are called &quot;Baillifiens&quot; in French.

==Economy==
Baillif has mainly an agricultural sector a. Mixed crops such as bananas, cocoa and coffee are grown. They are shipped to the port or the airport to be transported. Baillif has an airport, Baillif Airport &amp; the runway is and the International Civil Aviation Organization airport code is TFFB &amp; the International Air Transport Association airport code is BBR.

Today, an industrial and commercial zone is under development, supplementing the Jarry zone.

==Sights==
With its small regional airfield, it acts as a gateway to the islands in the south. The airport from 19 October 2019 is now French language only for arriving and departing traffic.

At the entry to the market town, there is a 4 m tower as evidence of this historical past called the “Père Labat Tower”.

Further while going towards Vieux-Habitants, is the “engraved rocks” of Plessis.

==Education==
Public preschools and primary schools include:

* Ecole primaire Saint-Robert
* Ecole primaire Bourg 1 Baillif
* Ecole maternelle Bourg Baillif

Public junior high schools include:

* Collège Jean Jaures

==Personalities==

<text>Lake Sakakawea is a large reservoir in the north central United States, impounded in 1953 by Garrison Dam, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dam located in the Missouri River basin in central North Dakota. Named for the Shoshone-Hidatsa woman Sacagawea (who accompanied the Lewis and Clark Expedition), it is the largest man-made lake located entirely within North Dakota, the second largest in the United States by area after Lake Oahe, and the third largest in the United States by volume, after Lake Mead and Lake Powell.

The lake is located about from the state capital of Bismarck; the distance by the Missouri River is about . The lake&#x27;s width averages between , with a maximum of at Van Hook Arm. Lake Sakakawea marks the maximum southwest extent of glaciation during the ice age. The lake is located within the counties of: Dunn, McKenzie, McLean, Mercer, Mountrail, and Williams.

== History==
The reservoir was created by construction of Garrison Dam, part of a flood control and hydroelectric power generation project named the Pick–Sloan Project along the Missouri river. 
Garrison dam was completed in 1956. It is the second (and largest) of six main-stem dams on the Missouri River built and managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for flood control, hydroelectric power, navigation, and irrigation.

The creation of the lake displaced members of the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation from their villages of Van Hook and (Old) Sanish, which were inundated by creation of the lake. They relocated and founded the villages of New Town, White Shield, and Mandaree. Elbowoods was covered by the water, as was the original town site for Sanish to the northwest of New Town. But only a small portion of the Van Hook town site has ever been under water, the area near the old railroad tracks and elevators on the very south edge of the original town. The remainder of the Van Hook town site including the original Main Street and the residential areas to the north have not been underwater. In the last two decades Van Hook has become a thriving resort community with more residents than it ever had prior to when Lake Sakakawea filled. Yet, the US Army Corps of Engineers, as a direct consequence of poor planning, forced those living in that area of the original town site in the 1950s to evacuate. Currently, Van Hook is a lively recreational area with both year-round and summer residences. 

One name that had been proposed for New Town was &quot;Vanish&quot; (a portmanteau of the two previous towns&#x27; names). Elbowoods, a third reservation town where the agency headquarters, boarding school, hospital, and jail were located, was also lost to the lake. These three towns are commemorated in the names of the three campground sections at Lake Sakakawea State Park, a state park located adjacent to Garrison Dam.

During a training flight in winter 1969, a U.S. Air Force interceptor aircraft crashed into the western portion of the lake on March 10. The was from Minot AFB, about north of the dam. The pilot ejected safely to land and the plane sank below the frozen lake surface. It was not located until more than 35 years later, in September 2004, after an extended search by a local surveyors&#x27; group.

==Recreation==
The lake is a popular regional recreation destination for fishing, camping, boating, hiking, and other outdoor water-based recreation. Public recreation areas, parks, and wildlife management areas surround the lake and are managed by several agencies and organizations including the Corps of Engineers, North Dakota Department of Parks and Recreation, North Dakota Game and Fish Department, and the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation. Lake Sakakawea State Park hosts the western terminus of the North Country National Scenic Trail, a 4,800-mile hiking trail that extends to Vermont.

<doc id="355881" wikidata="Q1014795" url="?curid=355881" title="Capesterre-Belle-Eau">
<text>Capesterre-Belle-Eau (; ) is a commune in the French overseas region and department of Guadeloupe, in the Lesser Antilles. It is located in the south-east of Basse-Terre Island. Capesterre-Belle-Eau covers an area of 103.3 km2 (39.884 sq mi). The 1999 population was 19,568. The population density is 189 persons per km2. The inhabitants are called &quot;Capesterriens&quot;.

== Etymology ==

Its name comes from an expression of the navy of the 17th century: cab-be-ground, which indicates a ground exposed to the east wind. The abundance of the cascades, the rivers and the water levels led to the addition of the phrase Belle Eau, hence the name Capesterre-Belle-Eau.

==History==

Petroglyphs discovered in the rivers of Peru and Bananier show the presence of Native Americans.

On 4 November 1493, Christopher Columbus&#x27;s second voyage unloaded there. Columbus would have met Amerindians. To commemorate this event, a bust of the navigator was raised in 1916 at the entry of Sainte-Marie.

In the 17th century, Charles Houël gave land to Dutch colonists driven out of Brazil, so that they could grow sugarcane there. After the abolition of chattel slavery in 1848, Indian indentured workers were hired to replace the plantation slaves. They built a temple in the Shangy district.

Near the Bois Debout estate, on a small way leading to an underwood, a flagstone in the Cemetery of the Slaves, requires the visitors to &quot;Honor and Respect&quot; the memory of the slaves. Several tens of unnamed tombs oriented &quot;head towards Africa&quot; are there.

==Geography==

The town is located at the south-east of the Basse-Terre and is located south of the Capesterre River. Basse-Terre, the capital is south-west and Pointe-à-Pitre is north-north-east.

Carbet Falls comprises three cascades.

==Climate==
Capesterre-Belle-Eau experiences rainfall throughout the year, with a wetter season between July and November that coincides with hurricane season. The city receives 2000–2500 mm of rainfall. Tropical heat brings constant highs of around 32 °C (89 °F) that drop to 20 °C (68 °F) at night.

Trade winds, called &quot;alizés&quot;, blow from the northeast and often temper the climate.

==Economy==

The economy is geared towards agriculture, particularly bananas, thanks to the quality of the soil. Farmers cultivate sugar cane, cocoa, vanilla, coffee, pineapples and vegetables of all kinds.

A rum distillery operates there.

<doc id="355882" wikidata="Q4683448" url="?curid=355882" title="Administratium">
<text>Administratium is a well-known in-joke in scientific circles and is a parody both on the bureaucracy of scientific establishments and on descriptions of newly discovered chemical elements. 

In 1991, Thomas Kyle (the supposed discoverer of this element) was awarded an Ig Nobel Prize for physics, making him one of only three fictional people to have won the award.

A spoof article was written by William DeBuvitz in 1988 and first appeared in print in the January 1989 issue of &quot;The Physics Teacher&quot;. It spread rapidly among university campuses and research centers; many versions surfaced, often customized to the contributor&#x27;s situation.

A similar joke concerns Administrontium which was referenced in print in 1993.

Another variation on the same joke is Bureaucratium. A commonly heard description describes it as &quot;having a negative half-life&quot;. In other words, the more time passes, the more massive &quot;Bureaucratium&quot; becomes; it only grows larger and more sluggish. This refers to the bureaucratic system, which is generally perceived as a system in which bureaucratic procedures accumulate, and whatever needs to get done takes increasingly longer to get done as soon as it touches the bureaucracy.

<text>Dominic Keating (né Power; born 1 July 1961) is a British television, film and theatre actor best known for his portrayals of Tony in the Channel 4 sitcom &quot;Desmond&#x27;s&quot; and Lieutenant Malcolm Reed on &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Keating was born Dominic Power to parents Patricia (née Keating) and Lawrence Power, in Leicester on 1 July 1961. His father was Irish; his maternal grandfather, a brigadier, was awarded an OBE. His mother worked as an actress for a number of years.

Keating took part in his first stage performance while he was attending prep school at LGS Stoneygate. He played the character Cripple in &quot;The Ragged School&quot;. He then attended Uppingham School where he continued pursuing drama under Chris Richardson. At Uppingham School Theatre, Keating played Laertes in a production of &quot;Hamlet&quot;; Rowan Atkinson reviewed the performance. Keating was part of the Cadet Force before realising he did not wish to proceed with a military career.

After graduating from the University College London with first class honours in history, Keating tried various jobs before deciding to become a professional actor.

==Career==
Since there was another Dominic Power already represented by the actor&#x27;s union Equity, he took his mother&#x27;s maiden name of Keating. To obtain his Equity card, he worked in a drag act called &quot;Feeling Mutual&quot;.

===Theatre===
Keating had success on the UK stage before working as a television and film actor. He originated the roles of Cosmo in Philip Ridley&#x27;s &quot;The Pitchfork Disney&quot; and Bryan in Michael Wall&#x27;s &quot;Amongst the Barbarians&quot;, for which Wall won first prize in the Mobil Playwrighting Competition. Keating&#x27;s stage work in the United Kingdom includes the one-man play &quot;The Christian Brothers&quot; at King&#x27;s Cross, &quot;The Best Years of Your Life&quot; at the Man in the Moon Theatre, &quot;Screamers&quot; at the Edinburgh Playhouse Festival. In Los Angeles, he has appeared in &quot;Alfie&quot; at the Tiffany Theater.
===Television===
Keating first received major attention in the UK with a semi-regular role as Tony in the Channel 4 sitcom &quot;Desmond&#x27;s&quot; (1989–94) which he was cast for after his role in the play &quot;Screamers.&quot; He has made guest appearances in &quot;Inspector Morse&quot; and other television programmes.

After moving to the United States, he received the role of the demonic warrior Mallos on the short-lived 2000 series &quot;The Immortal&quot;, and starred in the Zalman King series &quot;ChromiumBlue.com&quot;. He also guest starred on series including &quot;Buffy The Vampire Slayer&quot;, &quot;G vs E&quot; and &quot;Special Unit 2&quot;, before landing a role in the main cast of &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; as Lieutenant Malcolm Reed; the show ran for four seasons. Since then, he has had guest roles on the series &quot;Las Vegas&quot;, &quot;Holby City&quot; and the &quot;&quot; episode &quot;Uncertainty Rules.&quot;

Keating joined the cast of the hit show &quot;Heroes&quot; for its second season, playing an Irish mobster in a four-episode arc. He also guest-starred for three episodes on the Fox TV series &quot;Prison Break,&quot; and in 2010 guest-starred on the FX original series &quot;Sons of Anarchy&quot;.

===Film===
Keating appears in several films including &quot;Jungle 2 Jungle&quot;, &quot;The Hollywood Sign&quot;, &quot;The Auteur Theory,&quot; &quot;Certifiably Jonathan,&quot; and &quot;Hollywood Kills.&quot; He lent his voice to Robert Zemeckis&#x27;s animated version of &quot;Beowulf&quot;. At a Star Trek convention in Sacramento, California on 9 September 2006, he announced he had been cast as an Australian scientist in the &quot;Species&quot; sequel &quot;Species IV&quot;. He stars in Tim Russ&#x27;s &quot;Plugged&quot; (2007) and appears as Sherlock Holmes&#x27;s brother in the film &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; (2010) by the Asylum.

In 1999, he was in a commercial for the PlayStation game Crash Team Racing.

In 2007, Keating appeared in a promotional campaign for Sprint/Nextel as fictitious British rock star Ian Westbury. Also for Sprint, Keating appeared in a 2009 cinema courtesy spot that encouraged cinema goers to avoid using their phones during the screening of movies.

<doc id="355894" wikidata="Q335322" url="?curid=355894" title="Pointe-à-Pitre">
<text>Pointe-à-Pitre (; , , or simply , ) is the second most populous commune of Guadeloupe (after Les Abymes). Guadeloupe is an overseas region and department of France located in the Lesser Antilles, of which it is a &quot;sous-préfecture&quot;, being the seat of the Arrondissement of Pointe-à-Pitre.

Although Pointe-à-Pitre is not Guadeloupe&#x27;s administrative capital (that distinction goes to Basse-Terre), it is nonetheless the region&#x27;s economic capital. The inhabitants are called &quot;Pointois&quot;. In 2018, it had a population of 15,410 in the city (commune) of Pointe-à-Pitre proper and 250,952 inhabitants in the urban unit Pointe-à-Pitre–Les Abymes. It is part of the metropolitan area of Les Abymes.

Pointe-à-Pitre International Airport, Guadeloupe&#x27;s main international airport, is located north of downtown Pointe-à-Pitre in the commune of Les Abymes.

The current mayor of Pointe-à-Pitre is Harry Durimel.

== Geography ==
Pointe-à-Pitre is situated on the southwest portion of the island of Grande-Terre, facing the Caribbean Sea; it lies in the centre of Guadeloupe, and is near the Rivière Salée (&quot;Salt River&quot;), which separates Grande-Terre from Basse-Terre Island. The town of Pointe-à-Pitre is surrounded by the communes of Les Abymes, Baie-Mahault and Le Gosier. Pointe-à-Pitre is on a limestone plateau, which was a factor for the construction of the city. The bay, Petit Cul-de-Sac Marin, offers a sheltered port.

== Name==

The name Pointe-à-Pitre, literally the &quot;headland of Pitre&quot;, is popularly believed to derive from a Dutch sailor/fisherman called &quot;Pieter&quot;, who may have settled in the 17th century on a promontory facing the &quot;Îlet à Cochon&quot; (&quot;Hogs Islet&quot;), just to the south of today&#x27;s downtown Pointe-à-Pitre. The promontory came to be called &quot;Pointe-à-Pieter&quot; (the &quot;headland of Peter&quot;) and later &quot;Pointe-à-Pitre&quot;. However, this theory is now questioned by linguists, with a derivation from the Spanish word &quot;pitera&quot;, meaning a type of rope made from agave, suggested as the true etymon of &quot;pitre&quot;.

== History ==
French colonial authorities had long thought about establishing a city on the current location of Pointe-à-Pitre, at the junction of Guadeloupe&#x27;s two main &#x27;island&#x27; districts (Basse-Terre Island and Grande Terre), but several attempts around 1713-1730 failed due to the insalubrious swampy ground.
During the British occupation of Guadeloupe (1759–1763) a settlement appeared on a hill overlooking the swamps. After the return of Guadeloupe to France in 1763, the city of Pointe-à-Pitre was officially founded under governor Gabriel de Clieu in 1764 by royal edict, and the swamps where downtown Pointe-à-Pitre stands today were drained in the following years, thus allowing the urban development of the city.

The development of the city was relatively rapid, partly thanks to the corsairs. In 1780, however, a great fire entirely destroyed the city. Sixty-three years later, in 1843, it was again destroyed by an earthquake. The history of Pointe-à-Pitre is marked by many disasters: the fires of 1850, 1871 and 1931, the earthquakes of 1851 and 1897 and the hurricanes of 1865 and 1928. The city also experienced several epidemics of cholera. Its location and large sheltered port have nonetheless allowed Pointe-à-Pitre to become Guadeloupe&#x27;s largest city and economic capital.

==Population==
== Religion ==

The former cathedral of St. Peter and Paul, Ancienne cathédrale Saint-Pierre-et-Saint-Paul, testifies that Pointe-à-Pitre has been the episcopal seat of a Roman Catholic Diocese of Pointe-à-Pitre on Grande-Terre. This was united with the present diocese for all Guadeloupe, at Basse-Terre, in 1951, since when its full title has been Roman Catholic Diocese of Basse-Terre-Pointe-à-Pitre.

== Climate ==
On the Köppen climate classification, Pointe-à-Pitre is on the border between tropical monsoon climate (&quot;Am&quot;) and tropical rainforest climate (&quot;Af&quot;). Like any other Eastern Caribbean city, it experiences rainfall quite evenly spread during the year, with a wetter season between July and November which coincides with the hurricane season. The city receives 1500–2000 mm of rainfall annually. Tropical heat is the norm, bringing steady highs of around 32 °C (89 °F) that drop to 20 °C (68 °F) at night.
The trade winds blow from the northeast and often temper the climate.

== Urban area and demographics ==
The tiny commune (municipality) of Pointe-à-Pitre is the center of a larger urban area covering 11 communes. This urban area – with 250,952 inhabitants at the 2018 census, representing 65% of the population – is the largest in Guadeloupe and one of the largest among French Overseas territories and departments.

=== Communes ===
The eleven communes making up the urban area of Pointe-à-Pitre, with their populations in 2017, are:
* Les Abymes: 53,491 (Les Abymes being the most populated commune in the urban area and indeed in Guadeloupe, the urban area of Pointe-à-Pitre is also often called the &quot;Pointe-à-Pitre-Les Abymes&quot; urban area)
* Baie-Mahault: 30,929 (the location of the urban area&#x27;s main seaport and largest industrial park in the Lesser Antilles)
* Le Gosier: 26,783
* Petit-Bourg: 24,277
* Sainte-Anne: 23,675
* Le Moule: 22,150
* Morne-à-l&#x27;Eau: 17,434
* Lamentin: 16,573
* Pointe-à-Pitre: 15,923 (the historic, commercial and administrative heart of the urban area; facing competition from its suburbs, the congested commune of Pointe-à-Pitre has been losing businesses and inhabitants in the past years)
* Saint-François: 12,816
* Petit-Canal: 8,220

== Economy ==
The city is the commercial capital of Guadeloupe, serving as the main port of call for cargo and passengers alike. The main seaport is the Port de Jarry located across the Bay of Cul-de-Sac Marin in the commune (municipality) of Baie-Mahault. It has one of the biggest container terminals in the Eastern Caribbean with a quay 600m long. The main exports are food crops (bananas, cocoa, coffee and sugar), animal products (beef, milk, yogurt) and manufactured goods (refined petroleum, textiles and medicines). The extensive Zone Industrielle de Jarry, directly west of Pointe-à-Pitre is a major centre of commercial and light industrial activity, notably for warehousing and distribution. Agricultural production continues in the east of the area where cattle rearing, banana and sugarcane growing continues. The nearby suburb of Le Gosier is Guadeloupe&#x27;s main seaside resort.

Seventy percent of residents of Pointe-à-Pitre resided in subsidized public housing in 2009.

<text>Legio III Gallica ( Third Legion &quot;Gallic&quot;) was a legion of the Imperial Roman army. The cognomen &quot;Gallica&quot; suggests that its earliest recruits came from veterans of the Gallic legions of Gaius Julius Caesar, a supposition supported by its emblem, a bull, a symbol associated with Caesar. The legion was based for most of its existence at Raphanea, Roman Syria, and was still active in Egypt in the early 4th century.

==Under the Republic==
The legion was founded in either 49 or 48 BC by Julius Caesar to help in Caesar&#x27;s war against Pompey. The soldiers of the legion were exclusively from Transalpine Gaul and Cisalpine Gaul. After Caesar died, the III Gallica joined Mark Antony&#x27;s army. While in the service of Mark Antony the legion would fight at the battle of Munda and Phillipi. They were included in the army levied by Fulvia and Lucius Antonius to oppose Octavian, but ended by surrendering in Perugia, in the winter of 41 BC.

==Under the Empire==

=== Service under Herod and service in Antony&#x27;s campaign against the Parthians ===
The legion served in Antony&#x27;s Parthian War in 36 BC. After the battle of Actium and Antony&#x27;s suicide during Antony&#x27;s Civil War, the III &quot;Gallica&quot; was sent again to the East, where they garrisoned the province of Syria.

===Campaigning under Corbulo and transferring to the Danube===
After Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo had been appointed to campaign against the Parthians over the control of Armenia, he withdrew III &quot;Gallica&quot; along with Legio VI Ferrata to form the core of his army. The campaign lasted from 58-68 AD. Corbulo&#x27;s successes triggered the emperor Nero&#x27;s resentment and eventually the general was forced to commit suicide. In 68 AD, III &quot;Gallica&quot; was transferred to the province of Moesia on the Danube.

===Year of the Four Emperors===
In the Year of the Four Emperors in 69, the legion, and the rest of the Danubian army, aligned first with Otho, then with Vespasian. Along with three other legions, the III &quot;Gallica&quot; joined Legio VII Gemina under its commander Marcus Antonius Primus in marching on units supporting Vitellius in northern Italy. The decisive clash came at the Second Battle of Bedriacum, where the Vitellians were defeated. The III &quot;Gallica&quot; had during its service in Syria adopted the custom of saluting the rising sun, and when dawn broke at Bedriacum they turned east to do so. The Vitellian forces thought that they were saluting reinforcements from the east and lost heart. From Bedriacum the legion advanced with Primus on Rome to rescue Vespasian&#x27;s family and supporters in that city, and encamped in Capua when Mucianus arrived from the east. As one of his actions to secure control of Rome, Mucianus dispersed the units loyal to Primus, sending the legion back to Syria.

===In Syria===

On returning to Syria, the legion made its base at Raphanaea. While the legion was in Syria, vexillations may have fought in Trajan and Domitian&#x27;s Dacian wars. It is also likely that the legion took part in Trajan&#x27;s Parthian wars. In 132 the III &quot;Gallica&quot; was called on to crush the Jewish rebellion. An inscription found in Rome attests that towards the end of Hadrian&#x27;s reign the legion was still based in Syria. They also took part in Lucius Verus&#x27; campaign against the Parthians under Gaius Avidius Cassius.

During the Year of the Five Emperors the Syrian Legions, including the III &quot;Gallica&quot;, supported Pescennius Niger. However, Septimius Severus emerged as the victor. Septimius Severus would campaign against the Parthian Empire; one of the legions that fought in this campaign was the III &quot;Gallica.&quot; During the reign of Roman Emperor Caracalla, the Legion left an inscription amongst the Commemorative stelae of Nahr el-Kalb. 

The legion played a central role in the early reign of Elagabalus. In 218, during Macrinus&#x27; reign, Julia Maesa went to Raphana, Syria, where the legion was based under the command of Publius Valerius Comazon. She largely donated to the legion, which, in turn, proclaimed emperor Julia Maesa&#x27;s grandson, the fourteen-year-old Elagabalus, on the dawn of 16 May. On June 8, 218 near Antioch. Gannys, Elagabalus&#x27; tutor, defeated Macrinus and his son, with the help of the III &quot;Gallica&quot; and the other legions of the East. In 219, the legion, exhausted by Elagabalus excesses, supported its commander, senator Verus, who proclaimed himself emperor. Elagabalus had Verus executed, and dispersed the legion. The legionaries were transferred namely to III &quot;Augusta&quot;, stationed in the Africa provinces. However, the following emperor, Alexander Severus, reconstituted the legion and redeployed them back in Syria. Valerius Comazon entered in Elagabalus court, becoming prefect of the Praetorian Guard and consul in 220. The legion partook in Alexander&#x27;s campaign against the Sassanids. Its subsequent history is obscure.

<doc id="355899" wikidata="Q313066" url="?curid=355899" title="Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo">
<text>Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo (Peltuinum c. AD 7 – 67) was a popular Roman general, brother-in-law of the emperor Caligula and father-in-law of Domitian. The emperor Nero, highly fearful of Corbulo&#x27;s reputation, ordered him to commit suicide, which the general carried out faithfully, exclaiming &quot;Axios&quot;, meaning &quot;I am worthy&quot;, and fell on his own sword.

==Ancestry==
Corbulo was born somewhere on the Italian peninsula into a senatorial family. His father, who shared the same name, entered the Senate as a formal praetor under Tiberius. His mother Vistilia came from a family which held the praetorship.

==Military and political career==

===Reign of Caligula===
Corbulo&#x27;s early career is unknown but he was suffect consul in AD 39 during the reign of Caligula, his brother-in-law through Caligula&#x27;s marriage to Corbulo&#x27;s half-sister Milonia Caesonia.

===In Germania Inferior===

After Caligula&#x27;s assassination, Corbulo&#x27;s career came to a halt until, in AD 47, the new Emperor Claudius made him commander of the armies in Germania Inferior, with a base camp in &quot;Colonia&quot; (Cologne).

The new assignment was a difficult one and Corbulo had to deal with major rebellions by the Germanic Cherusci and Chauci tribes. During his stay in Germania, the general ordered the construction of a canal between the rivers Rhine and Meuse. Parts of this engineering work, known as &quot;Fossa Corbulonis&quot; or Corbulo&#x27;s Canal, have been found at archaeological digs. It ran largely parallel to the modern-day Vliet canal, which connects the modern towns of Leiden (ancient Matilo) and Voorburg (Forum Hadriani). Upon reaching lower Germania, Corbulo employed both the army and naval squadrons of the fleet patrolling the Rhine and the North Sea, eventually expelling the Chauci away from the Roman Provinces and instituting a rigorous training program in order to ensure maximum effectiveness of his legions. He supposedly executed two legionaries after they were found to have laid aside their swords when labouring in the construction of fortifications on a marching camp. Corbulo is purported to have said, &quot;You defeat the enemy with a pickaxe.&quot;

===In the east===

Corbulo returned to Rome, where he stayed until AD 52, when he was named governor of the province of Asia. Following Claudius&#x27; death in AD 54, the new emperor Nero sent him to the eastern provinces to deal with the Armenian question. After some delay, and reinforced by troops from Germania, in AD 58 he took the offensive, and attacked Tiridates, King of Armenia and brother of Vologases I of Parthia. Artaxata and Tigranocerta were captured by his legions (III &quot;Gallica&quot;, VI &quot;Ferrata&quot;, and X &quot;Fretensis&quot;), and Tigranes, who had been brought up in Rome and was an obedient servant of the government, was installed as king of Armenia.

In AD 61 Tigranes invaded Adiabene, an integral portion of the Parthian Kingdom, and a conflict between Rome and Parthia seemed unavoidable. Instead, Vologases thought it better to come to terms. It was agreed that both Roman and Parthian troops should evacuate Armenia, that Tigranes should be dethroned, and the rule of Tiridates recognized. The Roman government declined to accede to these arrangements, and Lucius Caesennius Paetus, governor of Cappadocia, was ordered to settle the question by bringing Armenia under direct Roman administration.

The protection of Syria claimed all of Corbulo&#x27;s attention in the meantime. Paetus, a weak and incapable commander who &quot;despised the fame acquired by Corbulo&quot;, suffered a severe defeat at Rhandeia in AD 62, where he was surrounded and forced to capitulate to the Parthians and evacuated to Armenia. Command was again entrusted to Corbulo. In AD 63, with a strong army, he crossed the Euphrates. Tiridates declined to give battle and arranged a peace treaty. At Rhandea he laid down his diadem at the foot of the emperor&#x27;s statue, promising not to resume it until he received it from the hand of Nero himself in Rome.

===Fall and death===
After two failed plots by noblemen and senators, including Corbulo&#x27;s son-in-law, the senator Lucius Annius Vinicianus, to overthrow Nero in AD 66, Nero became suspicious of Corbulo and his support among the Roman masses. In AD 67 disturbances broke out in Judaea and Nero, ordering Vespasian to take command of the Roman forces, summoned Corbulo, as well as two brothers who were the governors of Upper and Lower Germania, to Greece. On his arrival at Cenchreae, the port of Corinth, messengers from Nero met Corbulo and ordered him to commit suicide. Undaunted, he strode forward to accept his fate, and fell on his own sword after exclaiming, &quot;Axios!&quot;, meaning, “I have deserved it.”

==Works==
Corbulo wrote a now-lost account of his Asiatic experiences.

==Marriage and issue==
Corbulo married Cassia Longina, the daughter of Gaius Cassius Longinus, consul of 30, and his wife Junia Lepida, a great-great-granddaughter of Augustus. Cassia bore Corbulo two daughters, one of whom married the senator Annius Vinicianus, and the other, Domitia Longina, married the emperor Domitian.

<doc id="355900" wikidata="Q575007" url="?curid=355900" title="Antichrist Superstar">
<text>Antichrist Superstar is the second studio album by American rock band Marilyn Manson. It was released on October 8, 1996, by Nothing and Interscope Records. It was recorded at Nothing Studios in New Orleans and produced by the band&#x27;s eponymous vocalist along with Sean Beavan, former Skinny Puppy producer Dave Ogilvie and Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails. The recording of the album was marred by excessive drug use, which provoked a high level of antagonism between band members. Consequently, it was their last release to feature contributions from founding guitarist Daisy Berkowitz, who was acrimoniously fired partway through recording.

A rock opera and a concept album, &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; was the first installment in a trilogy which included succeeding releases &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; (1998) and &quot;Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death)&quot; (2000). The central storyline on the album revolved around a supernatural being who seizes all power from humanity in order to initiate an apocalyptic end event; a populist demagogue who is driven solely by resentment, misanthropy, and despair, he uses his newfound position to destroy the world. The record can be seen as a social critique, utilizing this premise as a metaphor for the perceived fascist elements of the conservative political movement and the Christian right in North America.

Preceded by &quot;The Beautiful People&quot;, whose music video received three nominations at the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards, the album was both a critical and commercial success. Lorraine Ali of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; credited &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; with ending the dominance of grunge within popular music. In the years since its release, various publications have listed it among the best albums of the 1990s. The album debuted at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and has sold almost two million copies in the United States alone. As of 2011, worldwide album sales had surpassed over seven million copies.

The album was supported by the controversial &quot;Dead to the World Tour&quot;, which was heavily criticized by elements of the Christian right. Nearly every North American venue the band visited was picketed by religious organizations, predominantly because of unfounded, exaggerated claims of onstage drug use, bestiality, and Satanic rituals, including animal and even human sacrifice. The band also found itself the target of congressional hearings, which attempted to implicate the group in a fan&#x27;s suicide. Several previously unreleased recordings were issued on soundtracks throughout 1997, including &quot;Apple of Sodom&quot; and &quot;Long Hard Road Out of Hell&quot;.

==Background and development==
Marilyn Manson was formed in 1989 by the vocalist and by the guitarist Daisy Berkowitz. For the next seven years, the name of every band member was created by combining the stage name of a female pop culture icon with the surname of a male serial killer. Their highly visualized concerts quickly earned them a loyal fanbase in the South Florida punk and hardcore music scene. Within six months of forming, they were performing sold-out concerts in 300-capacity nightclubs throughout Florida. Eventually, the band gained the attention of Nine Inch Nails vocalist Trent Reznor, who signed them to his Nothing Records vanity label; Reznor produced their 1994 debut album, &quot;Portrait of an American Family&quot;. This was followed by the 1995 EP &quot;Smells Like Children&quot;, which contained their commercially successful single, a cover of the Eurythmics&#x27; &quot;Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)&quot;.

==Recording and production==

&quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; was recorded over an eight-month period at Nothing Studios in New Orleans by an extensive group of musicians. Along with the remaining members of Marilyn Manson—Twiggy Ramirez, Madonna Wayne Gacy, and Ginger Fish—Nine Inch Nails guitarists Robin Finck and Danny Lohner and drummer Chris Vrenna participated. The record was initially produced by the vocalist alongside Trent Reznor and former Skinny Puppy producer Dave Ogilvie. 
The process of creating the album was long and difficult, highlighted by experiments involving near-constant drug use and sleep deprivation in an effort to create a violent and hostile environment suited to the album&#x27;s content. Manson has admitted to heavily experimenting with prescription painkillers—including forms of morphine sulphate and hydrocodone—during recording; he also claimed he regularly inserted sewing needles underneath his fingernails to test his pain threshold.

Initial sessions were unproductive, and routinely culminated in the destruction of the studio, as well as the group&#x27;s own equipment and instruments. There was also a high level of antagonism between band members, with most of this directed toward founding guitarist Daisy Berkowitz. He later claimed to have been &quot;shut out&quot; of recording sessions, and alleged that much of his equipment was destroyed, such as the four-track recorder which had been used to produce many of the band&#x27;s early demos, along with his drum machine. The latter was subsequently revealed to have been thrown from a second-story window. This animosity resulted in Ramirez performing the majority of guitar work on the record.
Berkowitz was highly critical of Reznor, who, he said, purposely destroyed a Fender Jaguar given as a gift to Berkowitz from his then-recently deceased father, explaining: &quot;I was in the studio, and they were all in the control room, and I&#x27;m playing guitar. At the end, Trent says, &#x27;Do it again, but do it more like this.&#x27; We went through this three times, and he says, &#x27;Hold on. I&#x27;ll come in there. Let me show you what I&#x27;m talking about.&#x27; So I take my guitar off, hand it to him—and he smashes it, just to fuck with me. Then he laughed and left the room.&quot; Berkowitz acrimoniously exited the group sometime after this incident. Reznor&#x27;s relationship with the rest of the band—Manson in particular—also began to deteriorate during production, primarily as a result of creative differences. Manson and Reznor have not recorded material together since the release of &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot;.

Ogilvie was eventually blamed for the band&#x27;s dysfunction, and was fired as co-producer. He was replaced by frequent Nine Inch Nails mixer Sean Beavan. Manson and Beavan then spent several weeks reworking and remixing the majority of the album in Nothing Records&#x27; auxiliary recording facility; Reznor had started production on the soundtrack to David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Lost Highway&quot; in the primary studio, and was often absent from these later sessions. Manson went on to praise Beavan&#x27;s influence on both the album and band as a whole, describing him as being &quot;like a magnet, drawing the band back in the studio and back together.&quot; The pair are the sole credited producers of three songs on the record: &quot;Dried Up, Tied and Dead to the World&quot;, &quot;Kinderfeld&quot; and &quot;Minute of Decay&quot;. Berkowitz&#x27;s replacement on lead guitar joined the band shortly after the album was completed. Timothy Linton adopted Zim Zum as his stage name, ending the seven-year tradition of naming members after female icons and male serial killers; his name was derived from the Lurianic Kabbalah concept of &quot;tzimtzum&quot;.

==Concept and themes==

&quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; is a rock opera concept album, and its title is based on the 1971 Andrew Lloyd Webber musical &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;. The central storyline of the album revolves around a supernatural being—a demagogic rockstar—who seizes all political power from humanity in order to initiate an apocalyptic end event. This underlying concept was both inspired by and a tribute to the work of German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, specifically his philosophical concept of an &quot;Übermensch&quot;. It was also influenced by &quot;the idea of putting yourself through a transformation to become something superhuman&quot;, which Manson said he garnered from Nietzsche&#x27;s &quot;The Antichrist&quot;. The album is a social critique which utilizes this premise as a metaphor for the perceived fascist elements of the conservative political movement and the Christian right in North America. Manson also cited David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;We Are the Dead&quot; (1974) as a major influence on the album lyrically, saying: &quot;I remember hearing [that] song in the Nineties, when I first moved to L.A. It wouldn&#x27;t have had the same impact on me if I&#x27;d heard it when I was a kid in Ohio—it felt like it was about the culture of Hollywood, the disgusting cannibalism.&quot;

==Composition and style==

&quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; is primarily an industrial metal record, and contains material which has been described as industrial rock and death metal, as well as progressive metal, new wave and gothic rock. The record is separated into three sections: &quot;The Heirophant&quot;, &quot;Inauguration of the Worm&quot;, and &quot;Disintegrator Rising&quot;. In the final section, the central character transforms into the &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot;: a populist demagogue whose motivations transcend any conceivable sense of morality. Nihilistic and disgusted by humankind, it initiates a genocidal extermination of the human race, eventually destroying the entire planet. The album is also cyclical, with both its opening and closing seconds consisting of the distorted phrase &quot;When you are suffering, know that I have betrayed you&quot;.

Ramirez composed much of the music on the record, and regularly asked for input from Reznor, who he said was &quot;the only other string musician&quot; in the studio on a regular basis, elaborating: &quot;Writing the songs was nothing, but going in and recording them we made some changes. It was nice to have [Trent] there, like another member of the band to help me have another outlook at some of the stuff, because Daisy had run out of ideas and just did not contribute whatsoever.&quot; Reznor is credited with co-composing the music of three songs on the album. After the release of &quot;Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death)&quot; in 2000, Manson revealed that &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; formed a conceptual trilogy alongside both the aforementioned album and 1998&#x27;s &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot;. He explained that the trilogy was an autobiographical story told in a reverse timeline (chronologically reverse from their release dates), with the storyline beginning on &quot;Holy Wood&quot;, followed by &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot;, and &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; acting as its conclusion. Furthermore, although &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; and &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; made sense as individual concept albums, there was an overarching story running through each release.

===Cycle II: Inauguration of the Worm===

&quot;Cryptorchid&quot; is a shorter track that can be thought of as an interlude. The title is both a compound of the words &quot;crypt&quot; and &quot;orchid&quot; and a direct reference to the medical condition of cryptorchidism. &quot;Stereogum&quot; called the song a &quot;uniquely beautiful track&quot; and identified its roots in the avant-garde and ambient genus of industrial music comparing it favorably to the music of Coil, &quot;albeit an unusually rock-centric one.&quot; The song is divided into two sections. In the first half, Manson&#x27;s vocals are rendered deadpan using several layers of microphone filters while it is altered in the second with a vocoder to augment a Mellotron played over a pulsing sinus rhythm. On close listening, the phrase &quot;I wish I had balls&quot; is whispered repeatedly in the middle to bridge both sections. Crowning it the band&#x27;s 6th best song in their top 10 list, &quot;Stereogum&quot; mused of &quot;an alternative history&quot; where the band explored the song&#x27;s experimental direction further throughout the record.

===Cycle III: Disintegrator Rising===
The title song ends with Apple Inc.&#x27;s 1990&#x27;s synthetic speech program PlainTalk (also known as MacinTalk) voices repeating, &quot;When you are suffering, know that I have betrayed you&quot;. MacinTalk voices are used again in the music video. During live performances of the song, the MacinTalk voices repeat &quot;You might as well kill yourself — you&#x27;re already dead&quot; at the end of the song.

The song &quot;1996&quot; was the subject of legal action brought against the band by former bassist Gidget Gein, over alleged similarities to a demo titled &quot;She&#x27;s Not My Girlfriend&quot;. The latter had first been recorded in 1990, four years before Ramirez had joined the group.

==Release and artwork==

&quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; features elaborate artwork. Images in the booklet consist of various medical diagrams from &quot;Henry Gray&#x27;s Anatomy of the Human Body&quot;, Kabbalah symbols, and a visual worm-to-angel metamorphosis, references to verses one through five of Revelation 12, as well as liner notes—a note found under the lyrics of &quot;Irresponsible Hate Anthem&quot; claim the song was recorded live on February 14, 1997, despite the album being released in October 1996.

Artwork for the album was designed by P. R. Brown. It was the first of several albums Brown designed for the band. In an interview with &quot;Revolver&quot;, Brown recounted that his working relationship with the band started on the recommendation a friend in 1996 while working in New York City. The band was recording the album at Nothing Studios at the time and were actively looking for a cover art designer. By Brown&#x27;s admission, the extent of his experience designing album covers up to that point had been limited to jazz records. After researching into who Manson was, he realized it was &quot;pointless&quot; to send the band any of his prior work. Brown decided to spend a weekend &quot;creating fictitious album covers for made-up bands&quot; and sent those to New Orleans. After several months of hearing nothing back, Brown was invited to Nothing Studios to meet with Manson.

During their meeting, Manson asked Brown to watch E. Elias Merhige&#x27;s 1989 experimental horror film &quot;Begotten&quot;. According to Brown, Manson already had a strong idea of what he wanted the album cover to look like, drawing inspiration from the bleak cinematography of this &quot;grainy, scratched nightmare of a film.&quot; After a listening session of the unfinished record and an explanation of the album&#x27;s concept and three cycle structure, both agreed that the record needed two covers to portray the &quot;evolution from a worm into the antichrist.&quot; Brown utilized Dean Karr&#x27;s photographs of the band and mixed media for the packaging. He recalled &quot;drawing some things and scanning in several layers of dirt&quot; during the design process. The paperboard O-card slipcase depict Manson as &quot;the worm&quot; in the front with yellowed, scabrous wings and black superficial veins. A medical diagram of a rib cage can also be seen on the top left corner. On the back, Manson is shown as the Antichrist Superstar in suit and tie, along with the stylized high voltage symbol used by the band as the album&#x27;s logo. The roman numerals IX, VI, III and VII round out the rear of the slipcase.

The words &quot;Heart, Mind, Complacent, and Malice&quot; are also featured on the front of the O-card and throughout the booklet. They were originally from one of the fictitious album covers Brown made. Brown explained that he conceived of them after he &quot;picked opposing ideals and turned them into a symbolic compass of sorts: Heart is the opposite of mind, and complacency is the opposite of malice. Strangely enough, all of those things fit into the concept of the album. The exact graphic I used for the fake albums was used for the final package.&quot; Brown suspected it was the reason he was hired. The back of the tray insert depicts Manson standing between Ramirez and Gacy while the latter two wear oxygen masks connected to his codpiece. Senator Joseph Lieberman found the image particularly offensive. Mistaking the standing figure for a naked woman Lieberman denounced, &quot;These records and their corporate sponsors are telling our children it&#x27;s the season of senseless violence, hopelessness and the most awful ill will toward each other, particularly women.&quot;

==Promotion and singles==

&quot;The Beautiful People&quot; was released as the lead single, and both the song and its accompanying music video were critical and commercial successes. The track was a hit on alternative rock charts in the United States, reaching number 26 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Modern Rock Tracks, and number 29 on Mainstream Rock. It was successful internationally as well, peaking within the top fifty in both Australia and New Zealand, and was their first top-20 entry on the UK Singles Chart. Floria Sigismondi directed the song&#x27;s music video, which was included at number fifty-four on MTV&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Music Videos Ever Made&quot;, and at number 100 on MuchMusic&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Videos Ever&quot;. The video was nominated for Best Rock Video, Best Special Effects and Best Art Direction at the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards, where the band performed the song live. This performance was controversial, and has been listed as one of the most iconic in the shows&#x27; history. It was later credited with helping to establish the band in mainstream culture. VH1 included the song at number eighty-six on their list of the &quot;100 Greatest Hard Rock Songs&quot;. By the end of 1997, Manson appeared on the cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, who awarded the band their &quot;Best New Artist&quot; accolade.

&quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; was released as a promotional single in 1996. Music videos for both that song and &quot;Cryptorchid&quot; were created by E. Elias Merhige. The video for &quot;Cryptorchid&quot; heavily incorporated imagery from Merhige&#x27;s film &quot;Begotten&quot;, while the video for &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; remained unreleased until 2010, when it was leaked on YouTube. The latter had been screened at the 1997 San Francisco International Film Festival, where it won a Golden Gate Certificate of Merit Award. However, its release was blocked by Interscope Records, whom Manson described as being &quot;appalled by it.&quot; It combined performance footage and fascist iconography—namely the Nuremberg rallies—with footage of US nuclear weapons testing, and images of a Ku Klux Klan lynching.

Numerous outtakes and previously unreleased recordings were issued on movie soundtracks throughout 1997. &quot;Apple of Sodom&quot; appeared on the Reznor-produced soundtrack to David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Lost Highway&quot; in February. A music video for the song was created in 1996, and also remained unreleased until its director, Joseph Cultice, uploaded it to YouTube in 2009. &quot;The Suck for Your Solution&quot; appeared on the soundtrack to the Howard Stern biopic &quot;Private Parts&quot;, which was also released in February. &quot;Long Hard Road Out of Hell&quot;, featuring backing vocals from Sneaker Pimps vocalist Kelli Ali, was released on the soundtrack to &quot;Spawn&quot; in August. The following month, &quot;Tourniquet&quot; was issued as the album&#x27;s second commercial single, and peaked at number 28 on the UK Singles Chart. Its music video was also directed by Sigismondi. W.I.Z. directed the final music video created for &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot;: &quot;Man That You Fear&quot;, whose concept was adapted from the plot of Shirley Jackson&#x27;s 1948 short story &quot;The Lottery&quot;, and contained aesthetic and symbolic references to the 1989 Alejandro Jodorowsky film &quot;Santa Sangre&quot;.

===Tour===
The album was promoted by the highly controversial year long &quot;Dead to the World Tour.&quot; The tour was preceded by a performance on the second evening of &quot;Nights of Nothing&quot;, the final leg of Nine Inch Nails&#x27; &quot;Self Destruct Tour,&quot; on September 5, 1996, at the Irving Plaza. The band&#x27;s set ended early after Manson sent his drummer to the hospital by hurling a weighted mic stand at the drumkit. The evening was documented on a special episode of the MTV series &quot;120 Minutes&quot; titled &quot;120 Minutes of Nothing&quot;. The tour commenced a month later, on October 3, 1996, at the State Theatre in Kalamazoo, Michigan, and consisted of 175 concerts staged in several continents. The band&#x27;s now-trademark theatricality was a cornerstone of the shows. By the frontman&#x27;s own estimation, however, it was less extravagant than prior or succeeding outings. Manson still enraged conservatives and the Christian Right with near-nightly concerts wherein he wiped his buttocks with the flag of the United States, tore Bibles apart, and performed self-mutilation.

The tour mounted several set pieces. Depending on venue size, the backdrop consisted of a stained glass tableau that depicted Jesus flanked by figures impaled on spears or, alternatively, Saint Michael the Archangel slaying the dragon during the War in Heaven from the 9th verse of the twelfth chapter of the Book of Revelation. For smaller venues, the band used a crumbling mullioned and traceried Gothic cathedral window. The stage design also included a pipe organ and a set of stairs from which Manson descended to start the opening piece. Manson&#x27;s costume changes were limited between his signature elastic back brace matched to a jockstrap over a G-string, a pair of thigh-high fishnet hosiery attached to a garter belt and calf-high leather boots used for most of the show alternating to a black suit and tie over a red dress shirt for performances of the title song.

During the title song, the stage design was converted into a mock Nuremberg Rally. The backdrop was switched from the stained glass tableau to three oversized vertical banners unfurled from the rafters and emblazoned with the album&#x27;s logo. Manson performed atop a similarly emblazoned rostrum mimicking the exaggerated gyrations of dictators and televangelists, suggesting a similarity between the two. The rest of the band performed wearing chromed stahlhelms. In his autobiography &quot;The Long Hard Road Out of Hell&quot;, Manson described that portion of the show as simultaneous critiques on both the inherent fascism in Christianity and &quot;right-wing morality&quot; as well as the thin line between celebrity and demagoguery, &quot;because rock and roll can be just as blind as Christianity.&quot; A snow/ash-like confetti was used during performances of &quot;Cake and Sodomy&quot;, &quot;Cryptorchid&quot; and &quot;Apple of Sodom&quot; while a microphone stand covered in orchids was used during the song &quot;Man That You Fear.&quot;
The tour was plagued by constant bomb and death threats, and nearly every North American venue the band visited was picketed by religious and civic organizations. Opponents of the band based their protests on a pair of affidavits circulated by the American Family Association and Empower America that made unfounded claims of onstage drug abuse, bestiality, and satanic rituals—namely animal and human sacrifice—and claims the band engaged in homosexual intercourse with each other in concert, and that underage concertgoers were violently raped by other audience members. In this context, Utah passed legislation which allowed state-operated venues to ban the group from performing. Similarly, the April 10, 1997, concert at the state-owned Carolina Coliseum in Columbia was cancelled after the South Carolina House of Representatives voted to ban Marilyn Manson from ever performing on state-owned property.

During this time, schools in Florida threatened to expel students for attending the band&#x27;s concerts, and over 5,500 residents contacted the mayor of Jacksonville, demanding the cancellation of their April 17, 1997, concert at the Jacksonville Memorial Coliseum. The city council of Richmond, Virginia, also ordered the cancellation of their May 10, 1997, concert at the Richmond Coliseum. The July 22, 1997, concert at La Luna in Portland, Oregon, was cancelled when the venue was unable to obtain insurance for the event. Their concert at Calgary&#x27;s Max Bell Arena three days later was cancelled by the owner of the venue who cited the band&#x27;s reputation as justification for doing so. The New Jersey date of Ozzfest at Giants Stadium was cancelled by the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, who cited Marilyn Manson&#x27;s scheduled appearance as its reason. This prompted a lawsuit from Ozzy Osbourne.

During the vocalist&#x27;s appearance on ABC network&#x27;s late-night political talk show &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot;, host Bill Maher took the opportunity to discuss the controversy surrounding the tour. Maher noted the distinction between the rumors and the reality of what the band&#x27;s concerts consisted of. However, he observed that what Manson actually did on stage—specifically his repeated flag desecration and destruction of the Bible—were still genuinely offensive. Manson replied:

The tour was documented in several formats. The band&#x27;s second EP, &quot;Remix &amp; Repent&quot;, released on November 25, 1997, contained live versions of &quot;Dried Up, Tied and Dead to the World&quot; and &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; and an acoustic version of &quot;Man That You Fear&quot; taken during the tour. A VHS concert film entitled &quot;Dead to the World&quot; was released on February 10, 1998, and debuted at number one on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Music Videos, eventually spending a year on the chart. The album was reissued on cassette exclusively in Europe as part of Record Store Day 2016.

==Critical reception==
The album was released to acclaim from music critics, who praised its concept, production, and vocals. M. Tye Comer, in reviewing for &quot;CMJ New Music Monthly&quot;, described the record as a &quot;magnificent ... aural skull-fuck&quot;, writing that Marilyn Manson &quot;[took] in all the angst, hellfire and damnation one band [could] ingest, then [released] it in a fierce scatological display of apocalyptic sound and fury.&quot; He went on to commend the vocals, which he said could &quot;communicate pain, passion, fear, hate and euphoria in one mighty, ear-piercing roar.&quot; Greg Kot of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; complimented the album&#x27;s production, as did Jim Farber of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, who also praised its &quot;ambitious&quot; concept, even as he criticized the band&#x27;s sound as derivative of other industrial rock acts: &quot;[E]ach riff could&#x27;ve fallen right off an old Skinny Puppy LP.&quot;

Writing for &quot;Spin&quot;, Ann Powers applauded the album&#x27;s concept and the quality of the songwriting, saying: &quot;Until now, Manson&#x27;s ideas carried more weight than his music, but &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot;″s sound matches the garish grandiosity of his arguments. Its 16 songs rock like &#x27;70s Sabbath-style metal, but harder; the arrangements echo Queen in operatic scope but are more intense; the mood owes its vampiric chill to Bauhaus, but [Marilyn Manson] actually bites the vein.&quot; Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called it &quot;an unexpectedly cohesive album&quot; that stands as Marilyn Manson&#x27;s &quot;definitive statement&quot;. However, he was critical of Reznor&#x27;s production, saying: &quot;Though the sonic details make [the album] an intriguing listen, it&#x27;s not as extreme as it could have been—in particular, the guitars are surprisingly anemic, sounding like buzzing vacuums instead of unwieldy chainsaws.&quot; Even less impressed, Robert Christgau dismissed the record as a &quot;dud&quot; and later compared it to the music used by the United States military to psychologically harass Manuel Noriega during Operation Nifty Package.

In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Lorraine Ali credited both the album and the band&#x27;s associated rise within mainstream culture as &quot;[marking] the end of the reign of punk realism in rock &amp; roll&quot;, calling the record &quot;a volatile reaction to five years of earnest, post-Nirvana rock.&quot;
She went on to hypothesize that: &quot;Marilyn Manson offer total escapism as a true alternative, complete with carefully crafted gloom wear (no baggy shorts allowed), a frontman who blatantly begs to be in the spotlight and lyric imagery rivaling that of the best slasher movies.&quot; Similarly, a 2016 article from &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; called the record influential, suggesting that its success prompted a shift in rock music which resulted in other rock bands &quot;trading grunge&#x27;s bruised-heart jadedness for seething, self-flagellating nihilism.&quot;

===Political reaction===
The release of &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; coincided with the band&#x27;s commercial breakthrough, and much of the attention they received from mainstream media was not positive. In December 1996, the co-directors of Empower America Republican Secretary of Education William Bennett and Democrat Senator Joseph Lieberman, organized a bipartisan press conference, along with Secretary of Pennsylvania State C. Delores Tucker, wherein they questioned MCA—the owner of Interscope—president Edgar Bronfman Jr.&#x27;s ability to head the label competently whilst profiting from &quot;profanity-laced&quot; albums by artists such as Tupac Shakur, Snoop Doggy Dogg and Marilyn Manson. Tucker had previously called &quot;Smells Like Children&quot; the &quot;dirtiest, nastiest porno record directed at children that has ever hit the market.&quot;

In November 1997, the band found itself the target of congressional hearings, led by Senator Joseph Lieberman and Representative Sam Brownback, to determine the effects, if any, of violent lyrics on young listeners. This hearing was held by the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, and was titled &quot;Music Violence: How Does It Affect Our Children&quot;. At this subcommittee, Lieberman once again criticized the band&#x27;s music, calling it &quot;vile, hateful, nihilistic and damaging&quot;, and repeated his request that Seagram—then-owner of MCA—&quot;start ... disassociating itself from Marilyn Manson.&quot; Lieberman later called the band &quot;perhaps the sickest group ever promoted by a mainstream record company.&quot; The subcommittee also heard from Raymond Kuntz, of Burlington, North Dakota, who blamed his son&#x27;s suicide on &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot;—specifically the song &quot;The Reflecting God&quot;.

===Accolades===

The record has been listed in books including Robert Dimery&#x27;s &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;, &quot;1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die&quot; and &quot;Albums: 50 Years of Great Recordings&quot;. In 2008, Consequence of Sound identified &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; as a modern classic in their &quot;Dusting &#x27;Em Off&quot; feature, due to its counter-cultural and social impact during the late &#x27;90s. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included it among their &quot;Essential Recordings of the &#x27;90s&quot; in 1999, and placed it at number 84 on their &quot;100 Best Albums of the &#x27;90s&quot; list, which was compiled in 2011. &quot;Revolver&quot; included &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; at number 49 on their &quot;69 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.

The album has been featured in multiple lists compiled by several British rock magazines. &quot;Kerrang!&quot; dubbed it the 3rd best album of 1996, and placed it at number 14 on their list of &quot;100 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;, as well as at number 88 on its &quot;100 Greatest Rock Albums&quot;. In 2001, it featured on &quot;Q&quot;″s list of the &quot;50 Heaviest Albums Of All Time&quot;, while &quot;NME&quot; placed it at number 92 on their 2009-compiled list of the &quot;100 Greatest Heavy Metal Albums&quot;. It also appeared at number 92 on &quot;Classic Rock&quot;″s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Rock Albums Ever&quot;, and, in 2006, the magazine—as well as its sister publication, &quot;Metal Hammer&quot;—included it on their respective lists of &quot;The 200 Greatest Albums of the &#x27;90s&quot;. &quot;Record Collector&quot; included &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; in their extensive list &quot;10 Classic Albums from 21 Genres for the 21st Century&quot;, in the metal category.

Multiple international publications included it in their respective lists of the best albums of 1996, including the French edition of British magazine &quot;Rock Sound&quot;, who placed it at number 13, Dutch magazine &quot;Muziekkrant OOR&quot; ranked it at number 109 on their &quot;Best Albums of 1996&quot;, while Alternative Nation included the album at number 8 on their list of the &quot;Top Rock Albums of 1996&quot;. &quot;Rock Sound&quot; also featured the record at number 11 on their &quot;Top 150 Albums of Our Lifetime (1992–2006)&quot;. German rock magazine &quot;Visions&quot; ranked the album at number 37 on their list of &quot;The Most Important Records of the Nineties&quot;. Furthermore, French magazine &quot;Rock &amp; Folk&quot; listed &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; as being one of &quot;The Best Albums from 1963 to 1999&quot;, while retailer Fnac included it on their list of &quot;The 1000 Best Albums of All Time&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; sold 132,000 copies in its first week to debut at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the United States. The album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on December 11, 1996, and sold over 1.2 million copies within a year of its release. As of November 2010, the record had sold almost two million copies in the US alone, according to Nielsen SoundScan. It peaked at number two on the national &quot;RPM&quot; albums chart in Canada, where it has been certified double platinum by Music Canada (formerly the Canadian Recording Industry Association) for shipments in excess of 200,000 units. In Mexico, the record was certified gold by Asociación Mexicana de Productores de Fonogramas y Videogramas (AMPROFON), indicating shipments of over 100,000 copies.

The album&#x27;s international commercial success was initially modest, however, peaking at number 13 on the Finnish Albums Chart, but failing to make an impact on the album charts in both France and Germany, peaking at numbers 116 and 100, respectively. In Spain&#x27;s albums chart, the album peaked at number 43, despite its second single Tourniquet being a top-10 hit there. Despite peaking at number 73 on the UK Albums Chart and spending a sole week on the chart, &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) in July 2013 for shipments of over 100,000 copies. Similarly, the record spent six non-consecutive weeks on the ARIA Charts, peaking at number 41, and was certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). Conversely, it became the band&#x27;s commercial breakthrough in New Zealand, peaking within the top five and spending a total of 45 weeks on the New Zealand Albums Chart, where it was eventually certified platinum. &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; has sold in excess of seven million copies worldwide.

<text>Alvin and the Chipmunks, originally David Seville and the Chipmunks and billed for their first two decades as the Chipmunks, are an American animated virtual band and media franchise first created by Ross Bagdasarian for Novelty records in 1958. The group consists of three singing animated anthropomorphic chipmunks named Alvin, Simon, and Theodore. The characters have since featured in several television series and films, as well as other media.

Bagdasarian provided the group&#x27;s voices by producing sped-up recordings of his own, a technique pioneered on the successful &quot;Witch Doctor&quot;. Later in 1958, Bagdasarian released the similarly engineered &quot;The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don&#x27;t Be Late)&quot; for which he came up with the chipmunk characters and their human father, attributing the track to them. The Chipmunks were first depicted in animated form in &quot;The Alvin Show&quot; (1961). &quot;David Seville and the Chipmunks&quot; released several more records over the following decade until Bagdasarian&#x27;s death in 1972. The franchise was revived in 1973, with the characters&#x27; voices provided by his son Ross Bagdasarian Jr. and the latter&#x27;s wife Janice Karman.

Through the successful franchise, the Chipmunks have become one of the most successful children&#x27;s artists of all time. It has garnered two number-one singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and won five Grammy Awards, having four Top 10 albums on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and three certified platinum albums. &quot;The Chipmunk Song&quot; became one of the best-selling singles of all time at 5 million physical copies sold. In 2019, The Chipmunks received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

== History ==
=== &quot;Witch Doctor&quot; ===

In 1958, Ross Bagdasarian Sr. released a novelty song (as David Seville) about being unsuccessful at love until he found a witch doctor who told him how to woo his woman. Seville had bought a tape recorder and he experimented recording himself at different speeds to create a duet between him and the witch doctor. The voice of the witch doctor was in fact Seville&#x27;s own voice, sung slowly but recorded at half speed on the tape recorder, then played back at normal speed, thereby speeding up the voice into a high-pitched squeaky one.

The song was a hit, holding number one for three weeks in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, ranked by &quot;Billboard&quot; as the No. 4 song for 1958. Bagdasarian re-recorded the song for the second Chipmunks album, &quot;Sing Again with the Chipmunks&quot;, in 1960. 

Bagdasarian (again as Seville) recorded a follow-up song, &quot;The Bird on My Head&quot;, singing a duet with his own sped-up voice as the bird. It also reached the Top 40, peaking at No. 34. While driving in Sequoia National Park, Bagdasarian saw a chipmunk dash in front of him. That moment inspired him to create his chipmunk characters. He again used the same technique to pitch up the voice to create the chipmunks.

=== &quot;The Chipmunk Song&quot; ===

After the success of &quot;Witch Doctor&quot;, Liberty Records asked Bagdasarian to create another successful novelty record. He then came up with three singing chipmunks who were named after executives at Liberty Records: Alvin (named after Al Bennett), Simon (named after Simon Waronker), and Theodore (Ted Keep). The Chipmunks first officially appeared on the scene in a novelty record released in late fall 1958 by Bagdasarian. The song, originally listed on the record label (Liberty F-55168) as &quot;The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don&#x27;t Be Late)&quot;, featured the singing skills of the chipmunk trio. The novelty record was highly successful, selling 4.5 million copies in seven weeks, eventually selling 12 million copies. The song launched the careers of its chipmunk stars. The song won three Grammy Awards in 1958 and was nominated for Record of the Year. &quot;The Chipmunk Song&quot; appeared on the Chipmunks&#x27; debut album, &quot;Let&#x27;s All Sing with the Chipmunks&quot;, in 1959, and was repeated on &quot;Christmas with the Chipmunks&quot;, released in 1962.

=== &quot;The Alvin Show&quot; (1961–1962) ===

The first television series to feature the characters was &quot;The Alvin Show&quot;. The series ran from 1961 to 1962 and was one of a small number of animated series to be shown in prime time on CBS. It was not a prime-time ratings success and was subsequently canceled after one season. Ratings improved significantly in syndication. The television series was produced by Format Films for Bagdasarian Film Corporation. Although the series was broadcast in black and white, it was produced and later re-run in color. This show also introduced David Seville as an animated caricature.

===New albums and &quot;A Chipmunk Christmas&quot; (1969–1982)===

The final Chipmunks album in the project&#x27;s original incarnation, &quot;The Chipmunks Go to the Movies&quot;, was released in 1969. After Bagdasarian&#x27;s death in 1972, the Chipmunks&#x27; careers stalled until NBC showed interest in the original show (the network carried Saturday morning reruns of &quot;The Alvin Show&quot; as a midseason replacement in 1973) and the following year, Excelsior Records released a new album of contemporary songs performed by the Chipmunks. That album, &quot;Chipmunk Punk&quot;, featured Bagdasarian&#x27;s son, Ross Bagdasarian Jr., doing the voices of the characters. That album and the continued reruns of the series proved to be popular enough to warrant further new records as well as new television productions, and on December 14, 1981, the Chipmunks and Seville returned to television in the NBC Christmas special &quot;A Chipmunk Christmas&quot;, produced by the Bagdasarians with Chuck Jones as a creative consultant. It also inspired a companion record album. The following year, two more albums were released (&quot;Chipmunk Rock&quot; and &quot;The Chipmunks Go Hollywood&quot;).

===&quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks&quot; (1983–1990)===

The group&#x27;s name changed from &quot;the Chipmunks&quot; to &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks&quot;. In 1983, a second animated television series for the group, titled &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks&quot;, was produced by Ruby-Spears Productions and released. The first season introduced The Chipettes (three female versions of the Chipmunks). The show&#x27;s success led to the release of a soundtrack album in 1984, &quot;Songs from Our TV Shows&quot;. After 1988, the show was renamed just &quot;the Chipmunks&quot;. In 1985, the Chipmunks, along with the Chipettes, were featured in the live stage show, &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks and the Amazing Computer&quot;. In 1987, during the fifth season of the television show, the Chipmunks had their first animated feature film, &quot;The Chipmunk Adventure&quot;, directed by Janice Karman and Ross Bagdasarian Jr. and released to theaters by The Samuel Goldwyn Company.

In the 1988–89 season, the show switched production companies to DIC Entertainment (1988–1990) and Murakami Wolf Swenson (1988). In 1990, the show switched titles again to &quot;The Chipmunks Go to the Movies&quot;. In 1990, a documentary was produced about the show entitled &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks/Five Decades with the Chipmunks&quot;. In that year, the Chipmunks teamed up with other famous cartoon stars for the drug abuse-prevention special &quot;Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue&quot;.

=== Music releases and Universal acquisition (1991–2002) ===
On January 18, 1991, NBC aired a television special starring the Chipmunks entitled &quot;Rockin&#x27; Through the Decades&quot;. The same year, the band released the album &quot;The Chipmunks Rock the House&quot;. In 1992, the group released the country album &quot;Chipmunks in Low Places&quot;. Released on September 29, 1992, the album was certified platinum by the RIAA, becoming the group&#x27;s first platinum record and making it the Chipmunks&#x27; best-selling album followed by a greatest hits release and a reissue of 1981&#x27;s &quot;A Chipmunk Christmas&quot;. By 1993, &quot;Urban Chipmunk&quot; was re-released as a compilation album &quot;The Chipmunks&#x27; 35th Birthday Party&quot; with a double album, called &quot;The Chipmunks Sing-Alongs&quot;. Their fourth Christmas album, &quot;A Very Merry Chipmunk&quot;, saw a release in 1994, then &quot;When You Wish Upon a Chipmunk&quot; in 1995, and &quot;Club Chipmunk: The Dance Mixes&quot; in 1996 which peaked in the Top 10 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top Kid Audio.

In 1996, Universal Studios purchased the rights to the characters. In 1998, Sony Wonder and Columbia Records released &quot;The A-Files: Alien Songs&quot; and &quot;Greatest Hits: Still Squeaky After All These Years&quot; on September 21, 1999. The purchase of the rights to the characters by Universal resulted in the Chipmunks&#x27; 1999 reappearance, in the form of the direct-to-video movie &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet Frankenstein&quot;, released on September 28, 1999. Five new songs were composed for the film and were made available via a soundtrack released by MCA Records. Later that year, &quot;The Chipmunks&#x27; Greatest Christmas Hits&quot; was released. The movie was successful enough to spark interest in a sequel, and in 2000, &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet the Wolfman&quot; appeared. Three new songs were composed for the film, that were also made available on a soundtrack by MCA. Both movies featured the original cast of the second series reprising their roles as the tone was very similar to the series. Universal lost the rights to the characters in 2002 due to a breach of contract with Bagdasarian Productions.

=== Return to independency, movies and merchandise (2003–present) ===

On September 17, 2004, Fox 2000 Pictures, Regency Enterprises, and Bagdasarian Productions announced a live-action animated film starring Alvin and the Chipmunks. Tim Hill directed the 2007 adaption &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks&quot;, with voices by Justin Long, Matthew Gray Gubler, and Jesse McCartney. Further live-action installments were &quot;The Squeakquel&quot; (2009), &quot;Chipwrecked&quot; (2011), and &quot;The Road Chip&quot; (2015). The projects have achieved commercial success, grossing over a billion dollars collectively. Accolades received include five Grammy awards, an American Music Award, a Golden Reel Award, three Kids&#x27; Choice Awards, and Emmy nominations.

A television series, &quot;Alvinnn!!! and the Chipmunks&quot; was created by Janice Karman and produced by Bagdasarian Productions and Technicolor Animation Productions.

==Main characters==
===Dave Seville===

Dave Seville is the adoptive father, manager, and caretaker of Alvin, Simon, and Theodore in the franchise. Created by Ross Bagdasarian Sr. in 1958, Dave is portrayed as a compassionate yet often exasperated figure, trying to balance his career as a songwriter with raising the mischievous Chipmunks. His iconic catchphrase, &quot;ALVIN!&quot;, shouted in frustration at Alvin&#x27;s antics, has become a signature element of the franchise. In the live-action/CGI films, Dave is portrayed by Jason Lee, appearing as a loving but strict father figure who helps guide the Chipmunks through their music career.

===The Chipmunks===
In the 1980s media Alvin, Simon, and Theodore are about eight to nine years old and triplets, as they celebrate their birthday together in &quot;A Chipmunk Reunion&quot; (Alvin stating to be born five minutes before Simon). The 1983 series revealed that the boys&#x27; mother, Vinnie, is a similarly anthropomorphic chipmunk living in a nearby forest. One year a particularly harsh winter had caused a nut shortage. Vinnie realized that her newborn children would likely not survive the winter, so she anonymously left them on Dave&#x27;s doorstep. She returned briefly to see what happened years later. Dave and the boys were unaware of their origins until they asked him during an argument over the exact date of their birthday. Vinnie had never revealed herself to him, but the boys investigated and eventually tracked her down.

While never mentioned, in the CGI movies and 2015 series, the chipmunks are no longer triplets and celebrate different birthdays; but seem to be around the same school age. In the 2007 feature film, the chipmunks lived in a tree, fending for themselves as their parents had taken off to join a hippie commune and had problems gathering nuts for the winter. Their tree is cut down and carted off to grace the entrance lobby of a city office building, with them in it. They eventually wind up in Dave&#x27;s home, where they wreak havoc. After being thrown out, Dave notices how well they can sing, making them famous. They eventually win his heart.

===Ian Hawke===
Ian Hawke is a recurring character in the Alvin and the Chipmunks franchise, first appearing in the 2007 live-action/CGI film. Portrayed by actor David Cross, Ian is introduced as an ambitious and unscrupulous record executive for JETT Records. He initially discovers the Chipmunks and helps launch their music career but quickly becomes their adversary due to his greed and manipulative behavior. Throughout the series, Ian repeatedly schemes to exploit the Chipmunks and other characters, including the Chipettes, for his personal gain. His character often serves as a foil to the more well-meaning and protective David Seville. Over the course of the series, Ian softens and shows redeeming qualities. By the end of &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked&quot;, he reconciles with the Chipmunks and ultimately aids in their rescue, becoming a more supportive character.

===The Chipettes===

The Chipettes are a female counterpart to the Chipmunks, introduced in the Alvin and the Chipmunks franchise as their singing rivals and later close friends. Consisting of Brittany, Jeanette, and Eleanor, the trio is known for their distinctive personalities and vocal talents. They first appeared in the 1983 animated series &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks&quot;, and were later featured in various films and media adaptations. In the live-action/CGI film series, the Chipettes make their debut in &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel&quot; (2009) as performers managed by Ian Hawke, who attempts to use them to overshadow the Chipmunks. The Chipettes eventually break free from Ian’s control and join forces with the Chipmunks, becoming both their romantic interests and musical collaborators. Throughout the franchise, they remain popular characters, often involved in comedic and musical adventures alongside the Chipmunks.

==Personnel==
* Alvin Seville – lead and backing vocals
* Simon Seville – lead and backing vocals
* Theodore Seville – lead and backing vocals

==Recording technique==

The Chipmunks&#x27; voices were recorded at half the normal tape speed on audiotape by voice talent (on the 1960s records, generally Ross Bagdasarian&#x27;s own voice overdubbed three times, on the post-1980s records, studio singers) talking or singing at half the normal speaking rate. When the tape was played back at normal speed, they would sound a full octave higher in pitch, at normal tempo. The use of this technique with the Chipmunks linked this technique to them, with the term &quot;chipmunk-voiced&quot; entering the American vernacular to describe any artificially high-pitched voice. Bagdasarian recorded vocals and music at different speeds to combine properly on his recording. Guitarist Les Paul said he visited Bagdasarian&#x27;s studio in 1958 and helped with the recording. The early Hip hop production style of artist Kanye West involved sped-up, high-pitch vocal samples from classic Soul music records incorporated with his own (additional) instrumentation, a style that was to become known as &quot;chipmunk soul&quot;. Due in part to the acclaim of his debut album &quot;The College Dropout&quot;, such sampling techniques subsequently became much copied by myriad of other hip-hop producers.

==Guest appearances==
The Chipmunks made their first guest appearance on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; on December 13, 1959, when they performed &quot;The Chipmunk Song&quot;. They were portrayed by puppets.

In 1968, the Chipmunks appeared in an Italian commercial TV program &quot;Carosello&quot;, in their sponsorship of Prealpi, a cheese-maker in Varese, Italy.

The Chipmunks appeared in the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade twice; 1983 and 1986. In the 1983 parade, they performed &quot;Tomorrow&quot;. In 1986, they performed &quot;The Girls of Rock and Roll&quot; with The Chipettes as a way to promote their film, &quot;The Chipmunk Adventure&quot;, which was released six months later.

The Chipmunks performed with Canned Heat on the band&#x27;s interpretation of &quot;The Chipmunk Song&quot;, which is sufficiently derivative of the Chipmunks&#x27; 1958 hit that Ross Bagdasarian Sr. gets sole writing credit. It was featured as the flip-side of the band&#x27;s &quot;Christmas Blues&quot; single released in late 2009.

The Chipmunks made a guest appearance on &quot;Xuxa&quot; in 1993, where they performed &quot;Country Pride&quot; from their album, &quot;Chipmunks in Low Places&quot;.

They also appeared on the &quot;FOX NFL Sunday&quot; intro (which premiered on December 20, 2009) with the cameo character, Digger (the mascot for &quot;NASCAR on Fox&quot;).

The Chipmunks made an appearance at a Los Angeles Dodgers preseason game on April 3, 2010, when the Dodgers squared off against their rivals, the Los Angeles Angels. The group performed, &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; with a group of children prior to the game. Also, Simon Seville wore a wig of Manny Ramirez&#x27;s dreadlocks. Ross Bagdasarian Jr. made the opening ceremonial pitch for that game.

The Chipmunks made multiple appearances on ads for food safety to help kids learn safe food practices.

<doc id="355905" wikidata="Q3482202" url="?curid=355905" title="Reith Lectures">
<text>The Reith Lectures is a series of annual BBC radio lectures given by leading figures of the day. They are commissioned by the BBC and broadcast on Radio 4 and the World Service. The lectures were inaugurated in 1948 to mark the historic contribution made to public service broadcasting by Lord Reith, the corporation&#x27;s first director-general.

Reith maintained that broadcasting should be a public service that aimed to enrich the intellectual and cultural life of the nation. It is in this spirit that the BBC each year invites a leading figure to deliver the lectures. The aim is to advance public understanding and debate about issues of contemporary interest.

The first Reith lecturer was the philosopher and later Nobel laureate, Bertrand Russell. The first female lecturer was Dame Margery Perham in 1961. The youngest Reith lecturer was Colin Blakemore, who was 32 in 1976 when he broadcast over six episodes on the brain and consciousness.

==The Reith Lectures archive==

In June 2011 BBC Radio 4 published its Reith Lectures archive. This included two podcasts featuring over 240 lectures from 1948 to the present day as well as streamed online audio, and the complete written transcripts of the entire Reith Lectures archive:

* Podcast 1: Archive 1948–1975
* Podcast 2: Archive 1976–2012
* Transcripts 1948–2010
* In pictures

The BBC found that some of the audio archive of the Reith Lectures was missing from its library and appealed to the public for copies of the missing lectures.

<text>Poor Richard&#x27;s Almanack (sometimes &quot;Almanac&quot;) was a yearly almanac published by Benjamin Franklin, who adopted the pseudonym of &quot;Poor Richard&quot; or &quot;Richard Saunders&quot; for this purpose. The publication appeared continually from 1732 to 1758. It sold exceptionally well for a pamphlet published in the Thirteen Colonies; print runs reached 10,000 per year. 

Franklin, the American inventor, , and accomplished publisher and printer, achieved success with &quot;Poor Richard&#x27;s Almanack&quot;. Almanacks were very popular books in colonial America, offering a mixture of seasonal weather forecasts, practical household hints, puzzles, and other amusements. &quot;Poor Richard&#x27;s Almanack&quot; was also popular for its extensive use of wordplay, and some of the witty phrases coined in the work survive in the contemporary American vernacular.

==History==
On December 28, 1732, Benjamin Franklin announced in &quot;The Pennsylvania Gazette&quot; that he had just printed and published the first edition of &quot;The Poor Richard&quot;, by Richard Saunders, Philomath. Franklin published the first &quot;Poor Richard&#x27;s Almanack&quot; on December 28, 1732, and continued to publish new editions for 25 years, bringing him much economic success and popularity. The almanack sold as many as 10,000 copies a year. In 1735, upon the death of Franklin&#x27;s brother, James, Franklin sent 500 copies of &quot;Poor Richard&#x27;s&quot; to his widow for free, so that she could make money selling them.

==Contents==
The &quot;Almanack&quot; contained the calendar, weather, poems, sayings, and astronomical and astrological information that a typical almanac of the period would contain. Franklin also included the occasional mathematical exercise, and the &quot;Almanack&quot; from 1750 features an early example of demographics. It is chiefly remembered, however, for being a repository of Franklin&#x27;s aphorisms and proverbs, many of which live on in American English. These maxims typically counsel thrift and courtesy, with a dash of cynicism.

In the spaces that occurred between noted calendar days, Franklin included proverbial sentences about industry and frugality. Several of these sayings were borrowed from an earlier writer, Lord Halifax, many of whose aphorisms sprang from, &quot;... [a] basic skepticism directed against the motives of men, manners, and the age.&quot; In 1757, Franklin made a selection of these and prefixed them to the almanac as the address of an old man to the people attending an auction. This was later published as &quot;The Way to Wealth&quot;, and was popular in both America and England.

==Poor Richard==
Franklin borrowed the name &quot;Richard Saunders&quot; from the seventeenth-century author of &quot;Rider&#x27;s British Merlin&quot;, a popular London almanac which continued to be published throughout the eighteenth century. Franklin created the Poor Richard persona based in part on Jonathan Swift&#x27;s pseudonymous character, &quot;Isaac Bickerstaff&quot;. In a series of three letters in 1708 and 1709, known as the Bickerstaff papers, &quot;Bickerstaff&quot; predicted the imminent death of astrologer and almanac maker John Partridge. Franklin&#x27;s Poor Richard, like Bickerstaff, claimed to be a philomath and astrologer and, like Bickerstaff, predicted the deaths of actual astrologers who wrote traditional almanacs. In the early editions of &quot;Poor Richard&#x27;s Almanack&quot;, predicting and falsely reporting the deaths of these astrologers—much to their dismay—was something of a running joke. However, Franklin&#x27;s endearing character of &quot;Poor&quot; Richard Saunders, along with his wife Bridget, was ultimately used to frame (if comically) what was intended as a serious resource that people would buy year after year. To that end, the satirical edge of Swift&#x27;s character is largely absent in Poor Richard. Richard was presented as distinct from Franklin himself, occasionally referring to the latter as his printer.

In later editions, the original Richard Saunders character gradually disappeared, replaced by a Poor Richard, who largely stood in for Franklin and his own practical scientific and business perspectives. By 1758, the original character was even more distant from the practical advice and proverbs of the almanac, which Franklin presented as coming from &quot;Father Abraham,&quot; who in turn got his sayings from Poor Richard.

==Serialization==
One of the appeals of the &quot;Almanack&quot; was that it contained various &quot;news stories&quot; in serial format, so that readers would purchase it year after year to find out what happened to the protagonists. One of the earliest of these was the &quot;prediction&quot; that the author&#x27;s &quot;good Friend and Fellow-Student, Mr. Titan Leeds&quot; would die on October 17 of that year, followed by the rebuttal of Mr. Leeds himself that he would die, not on the 17th, but on October 26. Appealing to his readers, Franklin urged them to purchase the next year or two or three or four editions to show their support for his prediction. The following year, Franklin expressed his regret that he was too ill to learn whether he or Leeds was correct. Nevertheless, the ruse had its desired effect: people purchased the &quot;Almanack&quot; to find out who was correct. (Later editions of the &quot;Almanack&quot; would claim that Leeds had died and that the person claiming to be Leeds was an impostor; Leeds, in fact, died in 1738, which prompted Franklin to applaud the supposed impostor for ending his ruse.)

==Criticism==
For some writers the content of the &quot;Almanack&quot; became inextricably linked with Franklin&#x27;s character—and not always to favorable effect. Both Nathaniel Hawthorne and Herman Melville caricatured the &quot;Almanack&quot;—and Franklin by extension—in their writings, while James Russell Lowell, reflecting on the public unveiling in Boston of a statue to honor Franklin, wrote:

 ... we shall find out that Franklin was born in Boston, and invented being struck with lightning and printing and the Franklin medal, and that he had to move to Philadelphia because great men were so plenty in Boston that he had no chance, and that he revenged himself on his native town by saddling it with the Franklin stove, and that he discovered the almanac, and that a penny saved is a penny lost, or something of the kind.

The &quot;Almanack&quot; was also a reflection of the social norms and social mores of his times, rather than a philosophical document setting a path for new-freedoms, as the works of Franklin&#x27;s contemporaries, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and Thomas Paine were. Historian Howard Zinn offers, as an example, the adage &quot;Let thy maidservant be faithful, strong, and homely&quot; as indication of Franklin&#x27;s belief in the legitimacy of controlling the sexual lives of servants for the economic benefit of their masters.

At least one modern biographer has published the claim that Franklin &quot;stole&quot;, not borrowed, the name of Richard Saunders from the deceased astrologer-doctor. Franklin also &quot;borrowed—apparently without asking—and adapted the title of an almanac his brother James Franklin was publishing at Newport: &quot;Poor Robin&#x27;s Almanack&quot; (itself appropriated from a seventeenth-century almanac published under the same title in London)&quot;.

==Cultural impact==
Louis XVI of France gave a ship to John Paul Jones who renamed it after the &quot;Almanack&quot; author—&quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot;, or &quot;Goodman (that is, a polite title of address for a commoner who is not a member of the gentry) Richard&quot; (the first of several US warships so named). The &quot;Almanack&quot; was translated into Italian, along with the Pennsylvania State Constitution (which Franklin helped draft) at the establishment of the Cisalpine Republic. It was also twice translated into French, reprinted in Great Britain in broadside for ease of posting, and was distributed by members of the clergy to poor parishioners. It was the first work of English literature to be translated into Slovene, translated in 1812 by Janez Nepomuk Primic (1785–1823).

The &quot;Almanack&quot; also had a strong cultural and economic impact in the years following publication. In Pennsylvania, changes in monetary policy in regard to foreign expenses were evident for years after the issuing of the &quot;Almanack&quot;. Later writers such as Noah Webster were inspired by the almanac, and it went on to influence other publications of this type such as the &quot;Old Farmer&#x27;s Almanac&quot;.

Sociologist Max Weber considered &quot;Poor Richard&#x27;s Almanack&quot; and Franklin to reflect the &quot;spirit of capitalism&quot; in a form of &quot;classical&quot; purity.&quot; This is why he filled the pages of Chapter 2 of his 1905 book &quot;The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism&quot; with illustrative quotations from Franklin&#x27;s almanacks. 

Numerous farmer&#x27;s almanacs trace their format and tradition to &quot;Poor Richard&#x27;s Almanack;&quot; the &quot;Old Farmer&#x27;s Almanac&quot;, for instance, has included a picture of Franklin on its cover since 1851.

In 1958, the United States mobilized its naval forces in response to an attack on Vice President Richard Nixon in Caracas, Venezuela. The operation was code-named &quot;Poor Richard&quot;.

<text>The Women&#x27;s Institute (WI) is a community-based organization for women in the United Kingdom, Canada, South Africa and New Zealand. The movement was founded in Stoney Creek, Ontario, Canada, by Erland and Janet Lee with Adelaide Hoodless being the first speaker in 1897. It was based on the British concept of Women&#x27;s Guilds, created by Rev. Archibald Charteris in 1887 and originally confined to the Church of Scotland. From Canada, the organization spread back to Britain, throughout the British Empire and Commonwealth, and to other countries. Many WIs belong to the Associated Country Women of the World organization.

==History==

The WI movement began at Stoney Creek, Ontario, Canada, in 1897 when Adelaide Hoodless addressed a meeting for the wives of members of the Farmers&#x27; Institute. WIs quickly spread throughout Ontario and Canada, with 130 branches launched by 1905 in Ontario alone, and the groups flourish in their home province today. As of 2013, the Federated Women&#x27;s Institutes of Ontario (FWIO) had more than 300 branches with more than 4,500 members.

Madge Watt, a founder member of the first WI in British Columbia, organised the first WI meeting in the United Kingdom, which took place on 16 September 1915 at Llanfairpwll on Anglesey, Wales. The organisation had two aims: to revitalise rural communities and to encourage women to become more involved in producing food during the First World War. 
 Women&#x27;s Institutes were formed in Scotland and Northern Ireland independently of those in England and Wales. The first Women&#x27;s Rural Institute started in Scotland on 26 June 1917, and Madge Watt travelled up from London to speak to a meeting at Longniddry. After the end of the Great War, Watt returned to Canada where she continued as an activist for the interests of rural women. In 1930 she founded the Associated Country Women of the World (ACWW).

At the end of World War I, the British Board of Agriculture withdrew its sponsorship, but the Development Commission financially supported the work of the forming of new WIs and gave core funding to the National Federation until it could become financially independent. In 1925, Pollie Hirst Simpson was appointed the WI&#x27;s first national agricultural adviser, and by 1926, the Women&#x27;s Institutes were fully independent and rapidly became a prominent part of rural life.

One of their features was an independence from political parties or institutions, or church or chapel, which encouraged activism by non-establishment women, which helps to explain why the WI has been extremely reluctant to support anything that can be construed as war work, despite their wartime formation. During the Second World War, they limited their contribution to such activities as looking after evacuees, and running the Government-sponsored Preservation Centres where volunteers canned or made jam of excess produce; all this produce was sent to depots to be added to the rations.

Women&#x27;s Institutes in England, Wales, Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man are affiliated with the National Federation of Women&#x27;s Institutes. In Scotland and Northern Ireland there are similar organisations tied to the WI through the Associated Country Women of the World: the Scottish Women&#x27;s Rural Institutes and the Women&#x27;s Institutes of Northern Ireland.

== England, Wales, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands ==
=== Structure and membership ===
Each individual WI is a separate charitable organisation, run by and for its own members with a constitution agreed at national level but the possibility of local bye-laws. WIs are grouped into Federations, roughly corresponding to counties or islands, which each have a local office and one or more paid staff. The National Federation of Women&#x27;s Institutes (NFWI) is the overall body of the WI in England, Wales, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, with headquarters in London. There is also an office in Cardiff, NFWI-Wales. WI Enterprises is the trading arm of the organisation and exists to raise funds and provide benefits for members. there were approximately 220,000 members of 6,300 Women&#x27;s Institutes in England, Wales and the islands, linked through the Associated Country Women of the World to other WIs worldwide.

The WI is a women-only organisation, and has clarified in a 2017 statement &quot;Transgender WI membership&quot; that &quot;Anyone who is living as a woman is welcome to join the WI and to 
participate in any WI activities in the same way as any other woman&quot;. Colonel Richard Stapleton-Cotton and his dog Tinker are the only two males ever to be accepted as fully paid-up WI members: the Colonel, a &quot;highly influential man locally&quot;, played a major part in setting up the first WI meeting in Anglesey in 1915.

===Campaigns===
The WI campaigns on a wide range of issues affecting women, based on resolutions agreed at each year&#x27;s national Annual Meeting. Its first resolution, passed in 1918, called for &quot;sufficient supply of convenient and sanitary houses, being of vital importance to women in the country&quot;. In 1943 they called for &quot;Equal Pay for Equal Work&quot; and continued to argue for this until the Equal Pay Act 1970 was passed. 1954&#x27;s resolution to &quot;‘preserve the countryside against desecration by litter&quot; lead to the formation of the Keep Britain Tidy group, which became a registered charity in 1960. The WI discussed HIV/AIDS in 1986, agreeing &quot;to inform the general public of the true facts concerning the disease AIDS&quot; and subsequently working with the Terence Higgins Trust to produce a leaflet on &quot;Women and AIDS&quot;. The 2017 meeting passed a motion on microplastics pollution or &quot;Plastic soup&quot;, and in 2018 the WI agreed to &quot;Make Time for Mental Health&quot;, &quot;calling on members to take action to make it as acceptable to talk about mental health as it is about physical health&quot;.

=== Activities ===
Every individual WI meets at least once a month. There is usually a speaker, demonstration or activity at every meeting for members to learn and develop a range of different skills.

Craft has always played an important role in the WI and thousands of members are involved in a range of different crafts.

The Women&#x27;s Institute is often associated with food, cooking and healthy eating, and food and cooking form an important part of the WI&#x27;s history. 

Home-prepared foods continue to be a staple for the institute. Country Markets Limited is now independent of the WI but its markets were formerly known as &quot;WI Markets&quot; and it was previously part of the NFWI.

=== Denman ===

In 1948, NFWI bought Marcham Park in Berkshire, England and converted it into a short-stay residential adult education college, named Denman College in honour of Lady Gertrude Denman. Now referred to as Denman, it has grown and developed over the years and is a well-appointed adult education centre attended by approximately 10,000 students each year. It is open to non-members as well as members. Courses offered at Denman include yoga, history of fashion and dance.

The WI Cookery School at Denman offers a range of over 100 day schools, residential courses and family courses. The courses are tutored by specialists.

In July 2020, the NFWI announced that Denman College would be closing permanently due to longstanding financial difficulties exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic.

=== &quot;WI Life&quot; ===
The NFWI produces a membership magazine, &quot;WI Life&quot;. Published eight times a year, &quot;WI Life&quot; is delivered () to more than 220,000 WI members.

===&quot;Jerusalem&quot;===

During the 1920s, many WIs started choirs and NFWI set up a music committee. W.H. Leslie, an amateur musician from Llansantffraid, Shropshire, acted as an advisor, and held a one-day school for village conductors in London in early 1924. He asked his friend Sir Walford Davies to write an arrangement of Hubert Parry&#x27;s setting of &quot;Jerusalem&quot;, for WI choirs. This hymn, with its association with the fight for women&#x27;s suffrage, was considered appropriate for the emerging WI movement which was encouraging women to take their part in public life, and to improve the conditions of rural life. Leslie suggested that Walford Davies&#x27; special arrangement for choir and string orchestra should be performed at the Annual General Meeting of NFWI held in the Queen&#x27;s Hall, London in 1924. He conducted the singing, bringing a choir from local WIs with him to lead.

This was so successful that it continues to be sung at the opening of NFWI AGMs, and many WIs open meetings by singing &quot;Jerusalem&quot;, although it has never been adopted as the WI&#x27;s official anthem.

As part of the 95th anniversary celebration, a &quot;modern&quot; version of &quot;Jerusalem&quot; was recorded by The Harmonies, selected from entrants from the &quot;WI Search for a Star&quot; competition. It was released in 2010 as part of the album &quot;Voices of the W.I.&quot;

===Royal membership===
Queen Elizabeth II was a member from 1943 until her death in 2022, and was President of Sandringham WI. Her mother Queen Elizabeth was also a member, as are Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh; Queen Camilla; and Anne, Princess Royal. Queen Elizabeth II attended the January meeting at Sandringham each year and in January 2019 referred to &quot;common ground&quot; and &quot;never losing sight of the bigger picture&quot; in a speech which was widely reported and interpreted as touching on the Brexit debate. The evening&#x27;s guest speaker was Alexander Armstrong, host of TV show &quot;Pointless&quot;, and the Queen participated in a game of &quot;Pointless&quot; played at the meeting, on the winning side; Armstrong commented on her &quot;deft, silky &quot;Pointless&quot; skills&quot;.

===Archives===
The archives of the National Federation of Women&#x27;s Institutes are held at The Women&#x27;s Library at the Library of the London School of Economics. The WI&#x27;s archives are open to the public.

In 2013 the Scottish Women&#x27;s Rural Institutes website traced its history to Stoney Creek and 1897, but the &quot;time line&quot; on the official Scottish Women&#x27;s Institutes website begins at Longniddry in 1917 with no mention of any Canadian roots.

<doc id="355914" wikidata="Q1194825" url="?curid=355914" title="Super Metroid">
<text>is a 1994 action-adventure game developed by Nintendo and Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It is the third installment in the &quot;Metroid&quot; series, following the events of the Game Boy game &quot;Metroid II: Return of Samus&quot; (1991). Players control bounty hunter Samus Aran, who travels to planet Zebes to retrieve an infant Metroid creature stolen by the Space Pirate leader Ridley.

Following the established gameplay model of its predecessors, &quot;Super Metroid&quot; focuses on exploration, with the player searching for power-ups used to reach previously inaccessible areas. It introduced elements such as the inventory screen, an automap, and the ability to fire in all directions. The development staff from previous &quot;Metroid&quot; games—including Yoshio Sakamoto, Makoto Kano and Gunpei Yokoi—returned to develop &quot;Super Metroid&quot; over the course of two years. The developers wanted to make a true action game, and set the stage for Samus&#x27; reappearance.

&quot;Super Metroid&quot; received acclaim, with praise for its atmosphere, gameplay, music and graphics. It is often cited as one of the greatest video games of all time. The game sold well and shipped 1.42 million copies worldwide by late 2003. Alongside &quot;&quot;, &quot;Super Metroid&quot; is credited for establishing the &quot;Metroidvania&quot; genre, inspiring numerous indie games and developers. It also became popular among players for speedrunning. &quot;Super Metroid&quot; was followed in 2002 by &quot;Metroid Fusion&quot; and &quot;Metroid Prime&quot;. It has been re-released on several Nintendo consoles and services.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Super Metroid&quot; is a 2D side-scrolling action-adventure game, which primarily takes place on the fictional planet Zebes from the original game—a large, open-ended world with areas connected by doors and elevators. The player controls Samus Aran as she searches the planet for a Metroid that has been stolen by Ridley, the leader of the Space Pirates. Samus can run, jump, crouch, and fire a weapon in eight directions; she can also perform other actions, such as wall jumping—jumping from one wall to another in rapid succession to reach higher areas. The &quot;Moon Walk&quot; ability, named after the popular dance move of the same name, allows Samus to walk backwards while firing or charging her weapon.

Throughout the course of the game, the player can acquire power-ups that enhance Samus&#x27;s armor and weaponry, as well as grant her special abilities, allowing them to gain access to areas that were previously inaccessible. The Morph Ball allows Samus to curl into a ball and roll into tight places; while in this form, she can plant bombs once a Bomb power-up is acquired. The Spring Ball adds the ability to jump while in Morph Ball form. The Speed Booster can be used to run at high speeds and crash into barriers and enemies. The Hi-Jump Boots allow for a higher jump, and the Space Jump allows Samus to jump in midair. The Grapple Beam can be used to swing across open areas. The X-ray Scope is used to see items and passages through hidden walls and other surfaces.

The heads-up display shows Samus&#x27;s health, the supply mode for Reserve Tanks, icons that represent weapons, and a map display showing her location and its surroundings. The inventory screen allows the player to enable and disable weapons and abilities. While the beam weapons can be combined, the Spazer and Plasma beams cannot be used simultaneously. At the game&#x27;s end, Samus obtains the Hyper Beam, a powerful weapon generated by the energy given to her by the &quot;super Metroid&quot;, the matured version of the larval creature that she seeks over the course of the game. The backup units called Reserve Tanks can be used automatically when Samus&#x27;s health is depleted. The game also features an automap to help players navigate the different areas of the game. Additionally, the player can use the map computer found in each part of the planet to reveal unexplored areas. To save their progress, the player must find and use one of the save stations scattered around the planet. The game can also be saved at Samus&#x27;s gunship, which fully recharges her health and ammunition as well. &quot;Super Metroid&quot; has three endings based on the time taken to complete the game, which determine whether Samus poses with or without her suit. The best ending is achieved when the game is completed under three hours. Additionally, an optional task alters the game&#x27;s end slightly. If the player chooses to rescue the Dachora and the Etecoons, friendly creatures encountered by Samus in the game, they are shown leaving the planet in the distance.

==Plot==
Samus Aran brings the last Metroid to the Ceres space colony for scientific study. Investigation of the specimen, a larva, reveals that its energy-producing abilities could actually be harnessed for the good of civilization. Shortly after leaving, Samus receives a distress call alerting her to return to the colony immediately. She finds the scientists dead, and the Metroid larva stolen by Ridley, leader of the Space Pirates. Samus escapes from the colony during a self-destruct sequence and follows Ridley to the planet Zebes. She searches the planet for the Metroid and finds that the Pirates have rebuilt their base there.

After defeating four bosses including Ridley in various regions of Zebes, Samus enters Tourian, the heart of the Pirates&#x27; base, and fights several Metroids that have somehow reproduced. A single Metroid that has grown to enormous size attacks and nearly destroys Samus, but relents at the last moment. It is the larva that was stolen from Ceres; because Samus was present at its hatching on SR388, the Metroid has imprinted on Samus, recognizing her as its &quot;mother&quot;.

Samus fights Mother Brain, a biomechanical creature that controls the Zebes systems. Mother Brain overpowers Samus and again she is nearly killed, but the Metroid intervenes, crippling Mother Brain and healing Samus. Mother Brain rises again and kills the Metroid, but upon death, the Metroid gives Samus the Hyper Beam, a powerful weapon strong enough to kill Mother Brain. Samus escapes Zebes as it self-destructs.

==Development==

&quot;Super Metroid&quot; was developed by Nintendo R&amp;D1 with a staff of 15 managed by Gunpei Yokoi. It was written and directed by Yoshio Sakamoto, and produced by Makoto Kano. Intelligent Systems, who co-developed the original &quot;Metroid&quot; with R&amp;D1, handled the programming. The opening was narrated by Dan Owsen, a Nintendo of America employee.

&quot;Super Metroid&quot; was released almost a decade after the original &quot;Metroid&quot;. Sakamoto said: &quot;We wanted to wait until a &quot;true&quot; action game was needed. [...] And also to set the stage for the reappearance of Samus Aran&quot;. It took half a year for Nintendo to approve the project, and two further years to develop.

The developers&#x27; primary goal was to make a &quot;good action game&quot;. It is the first &quot;Metroid&quot; game to let Samus fire in all directions while moving. It is also among the first open-world games with a map feature, which shows the outlines of rooms and indicates important locations and items. The team wanted to create a large map, but found it difficult to organize the amount of graphic data involved, and so broke it into smaller parts. Areas from previous &quot;Metroid&quot; games were included to create a sense of familiarity.

Shortly before the game&#x27;s release, the North American Entertainment Software Rating Board, a self-regulating organization, was formed in response to the increasing violence in games such as &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (1992). Asked whether he thought the controversy would cause a backlash for &quot;Super Metroid&quot;, Sakamoto explained that Samus&#x27;s purpose is to maintain peace in the galaxy, saying: &quot;It&#x27;s not violence for the sake of violence&quot;. The game was demonstrated at the Winter 1994 Consumer Electronics Show, and was named the best Super NES game at the show by &quot;GamePro&quot;.

===Audio===
The music for &quot;Super Metroid&quot; was composed by Kenji Yamamoto and Minako Hamano, and uses 16-bit versions of music from previous games. The Super NES&#x27;s sound hardware allowed the playback of samples simultaneously on eight channels, as opposed to three PSG channels and one noise channel of the NES. Yamamoto decided that rich and expressive sounds, such as a female chorus, would be required to portray the setting realistically. He composed the main theme by humming while riding his motorcycle from work.

Yamamoto also served as a sound programmer, and wrote a program that sends sound data to the audio chip. He also created sound effects, including those created for an infant Metroid to convey different emotions. The simultaneous roles as a composer, a sound programmer and a sound effect creator gave Yamamoto ideas to produce a distinct &quot;Metroid&quot; soundtrack &quot;with a sound programmer&#x27;s ear, with a sound effect creator&#x27;s ear, and with the approach methodology and theory of a composer&quot;. The arrangements and remixes of the game&#x27;s themes were used in &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; and its sequels, because Yamamoto wanted to satisfy old &quot;Metroid&quot; fans, describing it as a &quot;present&quot; for them.

A soundtrack album, &quot;Super Metroid: Sound in Action&quot;, was published by Sony Records on June 22, 1994. It contains 38 tracks and has a running time of 58:49. It includes the original &quot;Metroid&quot; soundtrack by Hirokazu Tanaka, and additional tracks arranged by Yoshiyuki Ito and Masumi Ito.

==Release==
The game was released by Nintendo in Japan on March 19, 1994, in North America on April 18, and in Europe on July 28. It was distributed on a 24-megabit cartridge. It was re-released through the Nintendo Power service in Japan on September 30, 1997. &quot;Super Metroid&quot; became available as a Wii Virtual Console game in North America on August 20, 2007, in Japan on September 20, and in Europe on October 12. In &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot;, it is also one of the trial games available in the &quot;Masterpieces&quot; section, which uses Virtual Console technology to emulate older hardware and have time constraints. The game was later released on the Wii U Virtual Console in May 2013, initially available during the trial campaign for a cheaper price before reverting to its regular price the next month. The New Nintendo 3DS-specific Virtual Console also received the release in April 2016. In September 2017, Nintendo released the Super NES Classic Edition, which included &quot;Super Metroid&quot; among its games. &quot;Super Metroid&quot; and other Super NES games were added to the Nintendo Switch Online subscription service in September 2019.

==Reception==

&quot;Super Metroid&quot; received highly positive reviews, being one of the highest rated games on review aggregator GameRankings. Chris Slate of the &quot;Game Players&quot; video game magazine thoroughly enjoyed &quot;Super Metroid&quot;, claiming that it &quot;easily lives up to everyone&#x27;s high expectations&quot;. He was satisfied with how Nintendo mixed &quot;smooth&quot;, &quot;complex&quot; gameplay, with &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; graphics and sound. Slate found the newly added auto-mapping feature something that players really needed, saying that it was the only feature in &quot;Super Metroid&quot; that the original &quot;Metroid&quot; should have had. Slate said that action fans will not miss &quot;Super Metroid&quot;, but also remarked that due to the large space available to explore and numerous secrets, the players will have to play through several times even after they have beaten it. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; mentioned that the game &quot;may well be the best action adventure game ever&quot;, calling it the &quot;wave of the future&quot;, and they praised the game&#x27;s graphics, sound, and controls. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; gave &quot;Super Metroid&quot; their &quot;Game of the Month&quot; award, comparing it favorably to the original &quot;Metroid&quot; and applauding the graphics, the many weapons and items available, and the music. Each of the four reviewers gave it scores of nine out of ten. &quot;GamePro&quot; criticized the controls as often awkward or difficult and said that many of the power-ups are either lifted from other Super NES games or simple upgrades of other power-ups in the game, but praised the game&#x27;s massive size along with the auto-mapping feature. Andy Robinson of &quot;GamesRadar&quot; was pleased with the game&#x27;s &quot;phenomenal&quot; soundtrack, complimenting it as &quot;one of the best videogame scores of all time&quot;.

&quot;Super Play&quot; critic Zy Nicholson said that &quot;Super Metroid&quot; is &quot;more of an experience than a game&quot;, likening it to watching a late-night movie due to the cinematic structure and atmospheric graphics and sounds. He found the game so compulsive that he was tempted to play &quot;without eating or sleeping&quot;. &quot;Super Play&quot; critic Tony Mott cited the atmosphere as its best aspect, and described it as a mixture of &quot;Aliens&quot;, &quot;Turrican&quot;, &quot;Exile&quot;, and &quot;Nodes of Yesod&quot;. Mott applauded the refined controls, and called &quot;Super Metroid&quot; &quot;undoubtedly the best game I&#x27;ve played this year so far&quot; and &quot;a game destined for classic status&quot;. James Leach agreed with Nicholson and Mott that &quot;Super Metroid&quot; was what &quot;Mega Man X&quot; should have been, containing &quot;everything I look for: playability, hidden tricks, powerful weapons and steamingly evil baddies&quot;. All three reviewers in their verdict called &quot;Super Metroid&quot; one of the best games for SNES platform.

&quot;Edge&quot; criticized the graphics and short length, but praised &quot;Super Metroid&quot; as &quot;intensely playable&quot; and &quot;full of memorable moments&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; called &quot;Super Metroid&quot;″s Virtual Console version a &quot;must-own&quot;, commenting that although the game was released nine months after the Wii launched, they felt that it was worth the wait. For players who have never played &quot;Super Metroid&quot;, &quot;IGN&quot; claims that they owe themselves as gamers to &quot;finally find out about what you&#x27;ve been missing all these years&quot;. In his review for &quot;GameSpot&quot;, Frank Provo found it &quot;absolutely astonishing that Nintendo let 13 years go by before making &quot;Super Metroid&quot; readily available again&quot;, but considered the most important thing was that players &quot;can now play this masterpiece without having to track down the original Super Nintendo Entertainment System cartridge or fumble with legally questionable emulators&quot;. Despite admitting that the Virtual Console version was essentially &quot;nothing more than a no-frills, emulated version of a 13-year-old SNES game&quot; that was no longer cutting-edge, he was still pleased with it and reiterated his belief that &quot;Super Metroid&quot; is &quot;one of the best 2D action adventure games ever produced&quot;.

===Sales===
In Japan, &quot;Super Metroid&quot; was the ninth-best-selling video game of 1994, with 531,000 copies sold that year. In North America, despite receiving critical acclaim, Rus McLaughlin of &quot;IGN&quot; said that &quot;Super Metroid&quot; arrived at a time when the lifecycle of SNES platform was coming to an end. Robinson similarly noted that, in a series tradition, the game was released at wrong place and time. With the help of strong marketing from Nintendo, &quot;Super Metroid&quot; sold well in North America, topping the Super NES sales chart in May 1994. A year after its release, Nintendo placed it on their Player&#x27;s Choice marketing label. By late 2003, the game had shipped 1.42 million copies worldwide.

===Accolades===
&quot;Super Metroid&quot; received several awards and honors. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; named &quot;Super Metroid&quot; a Game of the Month for May 1994, gave it an Editors&#x27; Choice award, awarded it as the Best Action Game of 1994, and named it the best game of all time in 2003. &quot;IGN&quot; ranked &quot;Super Metroid&quot; 3rd (2003), 10th (2005) and 7th (2007) in its top 100 games of all time lists. Likewise, &quot;IGN&quot; readers ranked the game 11th in its top 99 games of all-time list in 2005, and 4th in its top 100 games in 2006. Richard George of &quot;IGN&quot; also ranked &quot;Super Metroid&quot; 3rd in its top 100 SNES games, crediting its &quot;flawless action, impeccable level design, out-of-this-world atmosphere, a totally badass heroine and an enormous overworld to explore&quot;. &quot;GamesRadar&quot; named &quot;Super Metroid&quot; the best SNES game of all time, while &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; named it the best game in the &quot;Metroid&quot; series, beating out &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; and &quot;&quot;. &quot;GamePro&quot; listed &quot;Super Metroid&quot; as one of the fifteen must-play retro games on the Wii. &quot;Game Informer&quot; placed the game 29th on their top 100 games of all time in 2001. In 2018, &quot;Complex&quot; listed the game 3rd on their &quot;The Best Super Nintendo Games of All Time&quot;. They opined that &quot;Super Metroid&quot; is &quot;tour de force from Nintendo&quot; and described the gameplay as perfect. In 1995, &quot;Total!&quot; rated the game 17th on its &quot;Top 100 SNES Games&quot; list. In 1995, &quot;Flux&quot; magazine listed &quot;Super Metroid&quot; 62nd in their &quot;Top 100 Video Games&quot; list. They praised the game for its challenging gameplay and haunting atmosphere, although they felt that it is too similar to its predecessor.

==Legacy==
&quot;Super Metroid&quot; is often regarded as one of the greatest video games of all time. Jeremy Parish of &quot;USgamer&quot; remarked that &quot;Super Metroid&quot; is a &quot;game you can return to time and again and always come away with some fresh insight or observation&quot;. Andrew Webster of &quot;Ars Technica&quot; found the game&#x27;s atmosphere impressive, and noted that the developers had perfected the aspect on solitude, a concept introduced in the first &quot;Metroid&quot; game. &quot;Game Informer&quot; writer Joe Juba cited the game&#x27;s ending as &quot;one of the most memorable and empowering moments in gaming history&quot;. In 2009, &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; called the game &quot;challenging, deep and undeniably epic&quot;, placing it 24th on a list of the greatest Nintendo games.

As &quot;Super Metroid&quot; gives players awards based on how long it took them to complete the game, and because its open-ended structure lends well to sequence breaking, it has become a popular choice for speedrunning, a style of play in which the player intends to complete the game as quickly as possible. &quot;Super Metroid&quot;, alongside Konami&#x27;s 1997 game &quot;&quot;, is also credited for establishing the &quot;Metroidvania&quot; genre. It was cited as an influence on other Metroidvania games, including &quot;Shadow Complex&quot; and &quot;Axiom Verge&quot;.

Several ROM hacks for &quot;Super Metroid&quot; were released by fans, which added new features that are not included in the original game. &quot;Super Metroid: Redesign&quot;, created by &quot;drewseph&quot; in 2006, features new items, expanded areas and modified physics. In 2011, a Japanese hacker named &quot;SB&quot; released a ROM hack titled &quot;Metroid: Super Zero Mission&quot;, which intends to combine elements from &quot;Super Metroid&quot; and &quot;&quot;. Later hacks, such as &quot;Hyper Metroid&quot; by &quot;RealRed&quot; and &quot;Super Junkoid&quot; by &quot;P. Yoshi&quot;, further expand on the game&#x27;s mechanics with altered game mechanics, graphical overhauls, and new stories.

===Sequels===
Nintendo did not release another &quot;Metroid&quot; game for eight years, as the series had not matched the success of the &quot;Mario&quot; and &quot;Legend of Zelda&quot; franchises. Yokoi left Nintendo in August 1996, amid the failure of the Virtual Boy, and died in a car accident in October 1997.

Fans eagerly awaited a &quot;Metroid&quot; game for the Nintendo 64 (N64). According to Nintendo producer Shigeru Miyamoto, Nintendo did not develop a &quot;Metroid&quot; game for the N64 as they &quot;couldn&#x27;t come out with any concrete ideas&quot;. Sakamoto said he could not imagine how the N64 controller could be used to control Samus. Nintendo approached another company to make an N64 &quot;Metroid&quot;, but the offer was declined because the developers thought they could not make a game to equal &quot;Super Metroid&quot;.

In late 2002, Nintendo released &quot;Metroid Fusion&quot;, a 2D sequel developed for the Game Boy Advance by Nintendo R&amp;D1, and &quot;Metroid Prime&quot;, a first-person game developed for the GameCube by American developer Retro Studios, and the first &quot;Metroid&quot; game to use 3D graphics. Both &quot;Fusion&quot; and &quot;Prime&quot; garnered acclaim, with &quot;Prime&quot; winning several Game of the Year awards. &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; received three spin-offs, 2009 compilation &quot;Metroid Prime: Trilogy&quot;, containing &quot;Prime&quot;, its 2004 sequel &quot;Metroid Prime 2: Echoes,&quot; and 2007 Wii sequel &quot;Metroid Prime 3: Corruption&quot;, and an upcoming fourth sequel. In 2010, &quot;&quot; was released, taking place between &quot;Super Metroid&quot; and &quot;Fusion&quot;. 

After a long development period, a fifth 2D game and sequel to &quot;Fusion&quot;, &quot;Metroid Dread&quot;, was released in 2021 for the Nintendo Switch to critical acclaim and developed by &quot;&quot; developer MercurySteam.

<text>René Émile Char (; 14 June 1907 – 19 February 1988) was a French poet and member of the French Resistance.

==Biography==
Char was born in L&#x27;Isle-sur-la-Sorgue in the Vaucluse department of France, the youngest of the four children of Emile Char and Marie-Thérèse Rouget, where his father was mayor and managing director of the Vaucluse plasterworks. He spent his childhood in Névons, the substantial family home completed at his birth, then studied as a boarder at the school of Avignon and subsequently, in 1925, a student at &quot;L&#x27;École de Commerce de Marseille&quot;, where he read Plutarch, François Villon, Racine, the German Romantics, Alfred de Vigny, Gérard de Nerval and Charles Baudelaire. He was tall (1.92 m) and was an active rugby player. After briefly working at Cavaillon, in 1927 he performed his military service in the artillery in Nîmes.

His first book, &quot;Cloches sur le cœur&quot;, was published in 1928 as a compilation of poems written between 1922 and 1926. In early 1929, he founded the journal &quot;Méridiens&quot; with André Cayatte and published three issues. In August, he sent twenty-six copies of his book &quot;Arsenal&quot;, published in Nîmes, to Paul Éluard, who in the autumn came to visit him at L&#x27;Isle sur la Sorgue. In late November, Char moved to Paris, where he met Louis Aragon, André Breton, and René Crevel, and joined the surrealists. His &quot;Profession de foi du sujet&quot; was published in December in the twelfth issue of &quot;La Révolution surréaliste&quot;. He remained active in the surrealist movement through the early 1930s but distanced himself gradually from the mid-1930s onward. Throughout his career, Char&#x27;s work appeared in various editions, often with artwork by notable figures, including Kandinsky, Picasso, Braque, Miró, Matisse and Vieira da Silva.

Char joined the French Resistance in 1940, serving under the name of Captain Alexandre, where he commanded the Durance parachute drop zone. He refused to publish anything during the Occupation, but wrote the &quot;Feuillets d&#x27;Hypnos&quot; during it (1943–1944), prose poems dealing with resistance. These were published in 1946 to great acclaim. During the 1950s and 1960s, despite brief and unhappy experiences in theater and film, Char reached full maturity as a poet. In the 1960s, he joined the battle against the stationing of atomic weapons in Provence. He died of a heart attack in 1988 in Paris. The Hotel Campredon (also known as the Maison René Char) in L&#x27;Isle-sur-la-Sorgue was a public collection of his manuscripts, drawings, paintings and objets d&#x27;art, until 2016.

Char was a friend and close associate of the writers Albert Camus, Georges Bataille and Maurice Blanchot, and of the artists Pablo Picasso, Joan Miró and Victor Brauner. He was to have been in the car involved in the accident that killed both Camus and Michel Gallimard, but there was not enough room, and returned instead that day by train to Paris.

The composer Pierre Boulez wrote three settings of Char&#x27;s poetry, &quot;Le Soleil des eaux&quot;, &quot;Le Visage nuptial&quot;, and &quot;Le Marteau sans maître&quot;. A late friendship developed also between Char and Martin Heidegger, who described Char&#x27;s poetry as &quot;a tour de force into the ineffable&quot; and was repeatedly his guest at Le Thor in the Vaucluse.

<text>Darul Uloom Deoband is an Islamic seminary (darul uloom) in Deoband, Uttar Pradesh, India, at which the Sunni Deobandi Islamic movement began. Established in 1866 by Muhammad Qasim Nanautavi, Fazlur Rahman Usmani, Sayyid Muhammad Abid and others in 1866, it is one of the most important Islamic seminaries in India and the largest in the world. Mahmud Deobandi was the first teacher and Mahmud Hasan Deobandi was the first student.

On 14 October 2020, the executive council of the seminary appointed Arshad Madani as the principal (&quot;sadr-mudarris&quot;) and Abul Qasim Nomani as the senior hadith professor (&quot;shaykh al-hadith&quot;).

== History ==
Darul Uloom Deoband was established on 31 May 1866 by Fazlur Rahman Usmani, Sayyid Muhammad Abid, Muhammad Qasim Nanotawi, Mehtab Ali, Nehal Ahmad and Zulfiqar Ali Deobandi. Mahmud Deobandi was appointed as the first teacher, and Mahmud Hasan Deobandi was the first student who enrolled in the seminary.

In 1982, during the Vice Chancellorship of Muhammad Tayyib Qasmi, administrative disputes occurred in the seminary which led to the formation of Darul Uloom Waqf.

The spread of the Deobandi movement in the United Kingdom has produced some criticism concerning their views on interfaith dialogue and values including democracy, secularism, and the rule of law. In September 2007 Andrew Norfolk of &quot;The Times&quot; published an article titled &quot;Hardline takeover of British mosques&quot; about the influence of the Deobandis whom the author called a &quot;hardline islamic sect&quot;.

In February 2008, an anti-terrorism conference organized by the seminary denounced all forms of terrorism.

== Program ==
The school teaches &quot;manqulat&quot; (revealed Islamic sciences) according to the Hanafi school of Islamic jurisprudence. In this seminar, Nanawtawi instituted modern methods of learning such as teaching in classrooms, a fixed and carefully selected curriculum, lectures by academics who were leaders in their fields, exam periods, merit prizes, and a publishing press. Students were taught in Urdu, and sometimes in Arabic for theological reasons or Persian, for cultural and literary reasons. The curriculum is based on a highly modified version of the 18th century Indo-Islamic syllabus known as Dars-e-Nizami. The students learn the Quran and its exegesis; Hadith and its commentary; and juristic rulings with textual and rational proofs. They also study the biography of Muhammad, Arabic grammar, Arabic language and literature, and Persian language.

The syllabus consists of many stages. The five-year &quot;Nazirah&quot; (primary course) teaches Urdu, Persian, Hindi and English. The next level is the &quot;Hifze Quran&quot;. This involves the memorization of the Quran over two to four years. A few students will then choose &quot;Tajwid e Hafs&quot; (melodious recitation). The student is taught the detailed recitation rules of the Quran as laid down by Arabic Hafs. Still fewer will take up the next course, the &quot;Sab&#x27;ah and &#x27;Asharah Qira&#x27;at&quot; (study of all the ten Quran recitations).

A post graduate studies equivalent is the &quot;Fazilat&quot; course taken over eight years. It commences with &quot;Arabi Awwal&quot;, in which the basics of the Arabic language is the main aim, and finishes with &quot;Daura e Hadith&quot;, in which the main books of the sayings of Muhammad are taught. A prerequisite for this course is completion of primary education. Memorization of the Quran is also recommended. Students who complete the Fazilat may use the title &quot;Alim&quot; or &quot;Maulvi&quot;. The &quot;Daurae Hadith&quot; (final year) class is taught in the basement of &quot;an under construction seven storied building&quot;. In the 2017–2018 academic year (1438–1439 AH), 1664 students attended the Daurae Hadith class.

Almost a quarter of the students who complete the Daurae Hadith continue their studies. These advanced courses include &quot;Takmil Ifta&quot; (Jurisprudence); &quot;Takmil Adab&quot; (Arabic literature); and &quot;Takhassus fil Hadith&quot; (Hadith). Students who complete the &quot;Takmil Ifta&quot; take the title &quot;Mufti&quot;.

== Role in the Indian independence movement ==

The political ideals of Darul Uloom Deoband were founded up to ten years prior to its opening. In 1857 (1274 AH), Imdadullah Muhajir Makki (a spiritual leader) and his followers, Muhammad Qasim Nanautawi, Rasheed Ahmad Gangohi, Muhammad Yaqub Nanautawi and others gathered at Thana Bhawan to protest against British rule and continue their call for the independence of India. They fought what is called the Battle of Shamli.

In 1913 (1333 AH), Nanautawi&#x27;s pupil, Mahmud Hasan Deobandi was a leader in the independence movement. He incited revolution through a scheme which the Rowlatt committee called the Silk Letter Movement. However, the scheme failed and Hasan and his followers were arrested and exiled. Hasan was returned from exile in Malta, and he reached Bombay in June 1920. His group, Jamiat Ulama-e-Hind, which included Husain Ahmad Madani, Kifayatullah Dehlawi, Syed Fakhruddin Ahmad, and later on, Hifzur Rahman Seoharwi, Atiqur Rahman Usmani, Minnatullah Rahmani, Habib-ur-Rehman Ludhianvi, and Muhammad Miyan Deobandi joined with the Indian National Congress.

In 1926 and 1927 (1345 abs 1346 AH), graduates of the school called for Indian independence at Jamiat Ulama meetings in Calcutta and Peshawar. Madani opposed the suggestion of the All-India Muslim League for the partition of India along sectarian lines. He also advocated democratic government with religious freedoms and tolerance.

On 29 December 1929, &quot;Majlis-e-Ahrar-ul-Islam&quot; (&quot;Majlis-e-Ah&#x27;rar-e-Islam&quot;, , or &quot;Ahrar&quot;), a conservative Sunni Muslim Deobandi political party was founded in Lahore, Punjab. The founding members of the party were Chaudhry Afzal Haq, Syed Ata Ullah Shah Bukhari, Habib-ur-Rehman Ludhianvi, Mazhar Ali Azhar, Zafar Ali Khan and Dawood Ghaznavi. The founding members were disillusioned by the Khilafat Movement, which had aligned with the Indian National Congress. The party gathered support from the urban lower-middle class. It opposed Muhammad Ali Jinnah, leader of the All-India Muslim League and in the early years of Pakistan wanted Ahmadiyas to be declared non-Muslims.

== Fatwas ==
A fatwa is “an issue arising about law and religion, explained in answer to questions received about it” by muftis (Islamic jurists). Muftis at Darul Ifta (fatwa department), Darul Uloom Deoband are responsible for giving fatwas.

On 31 May 2008, the seminary issued a significant public “Fatwa against terrorism” after a public rally in Delhi with around 100,000 representatives from nearly 6,000 madrasas across India, including those from different sects. The fatwa was a first of its kind in South Asia and stated that &quot;in Islam, creating social discord or disorder, breach of peace, rioting, bloodsan, pillage or plunder and killing of innocent persons anywhere in the world are all considered most inhuman crimes.” The edict was signed by Habibur Rahman Khairabadi.

=== Controversial Fatwas ===
In January 2012, scholars from a Deobandi school issued a religious decision calling for the author Salman Rushdie to be barred from entering India to attend a literature festival because, in their opinion, he had offended Muslim sentiments.

In May 2010, clerics from a Deobandi school issued a fatwa stating that men and women cannot work together in public offices unless the women are properly clothed.

In September 2013, scholars from a Deobandi school issued a fatwa banning photography as un-Islamic.

In February 2024, National Commission for Protection of Child Rights, demanded an FIR against the seminary&#x27;s alleged promotion of the idea of Ghazwa-e-Hind, claiming that a supporting fatwa was available on their website, in response to a question seeking an answer to &quot;whether Hadith talks about invasion of India or the Ghazwa-e-Hind&quot;.

== Entry of women in campus ==
Darul Uloom Deoband has garnered attention for its stances on women’s rights, including issuing &quot;fatwas&quot; that restrict certain activities for Muslim women, such as working alongside men, watching football, and plucking their eyebrows without their husband’s permission. Additionally, the seminary faced criticism for its silence on the Taliban’s ban on women’s education, as the Taliban also aligns with the Deobandi ideology.

In May 2024, Darul Uloom Deoband imposed a ban on the entry of women and girls to its premises, citing concerns over social media videos filmed on the campus. The seminary&#x27;s rector Abul Qasim Nomani, stated that this decision responded to public complaints about the circulation of these videos, which were considered distracting and offensive by supporters of the institution. Prior to this, women were already restricted from entering the Rashidia mosque on campus; this restriction was now expanded to the entire seminary.

In November 2024, the seminary lifted the ban on women’s entry with conditions. Women were allowed on campus only if accompanied by a male guardian, wearing &quot;purdah&quot;, and prohibited from taking photographs. Reports suggested that the original ban negatively impacted nearby businesses, which led to the policy’s revision.

== Administration ==
The seminary&#x27;s co-founder Sayyid Muhammad Abid was the first vice-chancellor. Abul Qasim Nomani succeeded Ghulam Mohammad Vastanvi as the thirteenth VC of the seminary on 24 July 2011.

<text>Domitia Longina ( 50–55 – 126–130s AD) was a Roman empress and wife to the Roman emperor Domitian. She was the youngest daughter of the general and consul Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo. Domitia divorced her first husband, Lucius Aelius Lamia Plautius Aelianus in order to marry Domitian in AD 71. The marriage produced only one son, whose early death is believed to have been the cause of a temporary rift between Domitia and her husband in 83. She became the empress upon Domitian&#x27;s accession in 81, and remained so until his assassination in 96. She is believed to have died sometime between AD 126 and 130.

== Early life ==
Born sometime between the years 50 and 55, Domitia Longina was the second daughter of Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo and Cassia Longina. Through her mother she was descended from Augustus, the first Roman emperor, and her paternal aunt was Milonia Caesonia, wife of Caligula. Her father, Corbulo, was one of Rome&#x27;s most esteemed citizens, both in the Roman Senate and the army. In addition to serving as consul under Caligula, he conducted military campaigns in Germania and Parthia under Claudius and Nero, respectively. However, his family was connected to the failed Pisonian conspiracy against Nero in 65, consequently leading to Corbulo&#x27;s disgrace and suicide.

==First marriage==
Little is known about the life of Domitia before her marriage to Domitian, but sometime before 70 she was married to Lucius Aelius Lamia Plautius Aelianus, a man of senatorial rank. She may have been the mother of Lucius Fundanius Lamia Aelianus as well as one or two daughters. It is also possible that Fundanius may have been Longina and Lamia&#x27;s grandson through a daughter and her husband, a Lucius Fundanius, son of a Lucius Fundanius.

== Marriage to Domitian ==

=== Reign of Vespasian and Titus ===

Following Nero&#x27;s suicide on 9 June 68, the Roman Empire plunged into a year-long civil war known as the Year of the Four Emperors, which saw the successive rise and fall of the Emperors Galba, Otho and Vitellius. The crisis came to an end with the accession of Vespasian, who re-established peace in the Empire and founded the short-lived Flavian dynasty. In 71, Vespasian attempted to arrange a dynastic marriage between his youngest son Domitian, and the daughter of his eldest son Titus, Julia Flavia. By this time however, Domitian had already met and fallen in love with Domitia Longina, and managed to persuade Lamia to divorce her, so that Domitian could marry her himself. Despite its initial recklessness, the alliance was very prestigious for both families. The new marriage rehabilitated Corbulo&#x27;s family, while serving the broader Flavian propaganda of the time, which sought to diminish Vespasian&#x27;s political success under the less reputable emperors of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Instead connections to Claudius and Britannicus were emphasised, and Nero&#x27;s victims, or those otherwise disadvantaged by him, rehabilitated.

During this time, Domitian&#x27;s role in the Flavian government was largely ceremonial. While his elder brother Titus shared almost equal powers with his father, Domitian was left with honours but no responsibilities. This situation remained unchanged when Titus succeeded Vespasian as Emperor on 23 June 79, leading both ancient and modern authors to suggest a mutual animosity between the two brothers. In 80, Titus granted a suffect consulship to Domitia&#x27;s former husband Aelius Lamia, according to Gsell as a personal insult against Domitian. On another occasion, when Titus urged Lamia to marry again, Lamia asked whether &quot;he too was looking for a wife&quot;. In the same year, Domitia and Domitian&#x27;s only attested son was born. It is not known what the boy&#x27;s name was, but he died in childhood in 83.

After barely two years in office, Titus unexpectedly died of brain fever on 13 September 81. His last words were reported to have been: &quot;I have made but one mistake&quot;. The contemporary historian Suetonius speculated on the possible involvement of Domitian in his brother&#x27;s death, attributing his final words to a popular rumour of the time, which held that Titus had carried on an affair with Domitia Longina. However even he dismisses the story as highly unlikely.

On 14 September, the Roman Senate confirmed Domitian as Titus&#x27; successor, granting tribunician power, the office of Pontifex Maximus, and the titles of &quot;Augustus&quot;, and &quot;Pater Patriae&quot;. Consequently, Domitia Longina became Empress of Rome.

=== Empress of Rome ===
Shortly following his accession as Emperor, Domitian bestowed the honorific title of &quot;Augusta&quot; upon Domitia, while their late son was deified. Both appeared on Domitian&#x27;s coinage during this time. Nevertheless, the marriage appears to have faced a significant crisis in 83. For reasons unknown, Domitian briefly exiled Domitia, and then soon recalled her, either out of love or amidst rumours he was carrying on a relationship with his niece Julia Flavia. According to Suetonius, Domitia was exiled because of an affair with a famous actor named Paris. When Domitian found out, he allegedly murdered Paris in the street, and promptly divorced his wife. Suetonius further adds that, once Domitia was exiled, Domitian took Julia as his mistress, who later died during a failed abortion.
Modern historians consider this highly implausible however, noting that many of these stories were propagated by hostile senatorial authors, who condemned Domitian as a tyrant after his death. Malicious rumours, such as those concerning Domitia&#x27;s alleged infidelity, were eagerly repeated, and used to highlight the hypocrisy of a ruler publicly preaching a return to Augustan morals, while privately indulging in excesses and presiding over a corrupt court. Domitian did exile his wife, but Jones argues that most likely he did so for her failure to produce an heir. Nevertheless, rumours regarding Domitia&#x27;s alleged misconduct with Paris circulated even in Domitian&#x27;s time, and he did not take insults directed at his marriage lightly. Not long after his accession, Aelius Lamia was put to death for the joking remarks made earlier during the reign of Titus. In 93, a son of Helvidius Priscus was executed for having composed a farce satirizing Domitian&#x27;s separation from his wife. Stories of Domitian&#x27;s affair with Julia were likely an invention of post-Domitianic writers however.

By 84, Domitia had returned to the palace, where she lived for the remainder of Domitian&#x27;s reign without incident. Little is known of Domitia&#x27;s precise activities as Empress, or how much influence she wielded in Domitian&#x27;s government, but it seems her role was largely limited to ceremonial appearances. From Suetonius, we know that she at least accompanied the Emperor to the theatre, while the Jewish writer Josephus speaks of benefits he received from her. She was also the owner of the Horti Domitiae.

== Later years ==
On 18 September 96, Domitian was assassinated in a palace conspiracy organized by court officials. His body was carried away on a common bier, and unceremoniously cremated by his nurse Phyllis, who mingled the ashes with those of his niece Julia at the Temple of the gens Flavia. The same day, he was succeeded by his friend and advisor, Marcus Cocceius Nerva. Ancient sources have implicated Domitia in the conspiracy against Domitian, either by direct involvement, or advance awareness of the assassination. The historian Cassius Dio, writing more than a century after the assassination, claimed that Domitia chanced upon a list of courtiers Domitian intended to put to death, and passed the information to his chamberlain Parthenius. The story is most likely apocryphal however, with Herodian attributing a similar tale to the assassination of Commodus. According to Jones, the evidence suggests that Domitia remained devoted to Domitian, even after his death. Twenty-five years after her husband&#x27;s assassination, and despite the fact that his memory had been damned by the Senate, she still referred to herself as &quot;Domitia, wife of Domitian&quot;. There has been some speculation among historians that she may have remarried to Gnaeus Domitius Lucanus.

Sometime between 126 and 140, a temple dedicated to Domitia was erected in Gabii. She died peacefully sometime between 126 and the 130s.

<text>Ansfelden is a town in the Austrian state of Upper Austria. The rivers Traun and Krems run through the municipality. The town is perhaps best known for being the birthplace of the composer and organist Anton Bruckner.

Ansfelden has two museums, the Anton Bruckner Museum and a museum of musical instruments.

In the town&#x27;s coat of arms, granted on October 28, 1985, the wavy stripe represents the two rivers, the organ pipes the organist and composer Bruckner, and the cog-wheel the town&#x27;s paper-mills and other older industries.

Between 1945 and 1964, the DP Camp Haid was located in the district Haid. The city is twinned with the city of Condega in Nicaragua.

<text>The Porsche 959 is a sports car manufactured by German automobile manufacturer Porsche from 1986 to 1993, first as a Group B rally car and later as a road legal production car designed to satisfy FIA homologation regulations requiring at least 200 units be produced.

The twin-turbocharged 959 was the world&#x27;s fastest street-legal production car when introduced, achieving a top speed of , with some variants even capable of achieving . Combining race-car performance with luxury-sedan comfort and everyday drivability in dry, wet and snowy conditions, it was considered the most technologically advanced road car of its time.

After the successful introduction of all-wheel drive on more rally-specific cars like the Audi Quattro, it was one of the first pure high-performance sports-cars with all-wheel drive, providing the basis for Porsche&#x27;s first all-wheel drive 911 Carrera 4 model. Its performance convinced Porsche executives to make all-wheel drive standard on all turbocharged versions of the 911 starting with the 993. The twin-turbo system used on the 959 also made its way to future turbocharged Porsche sports cars. In 2004, &quot;Sports Car International&quot; named the 959 number one on its list of Top Sports Cars of the 1980s.

==Development history and overview==

Development of the 959 (originally called the &quot;Gruppe B&quot;) started in 1981, shortly after the company&#x27;s then-new Managing Director, Peter Schutz, took his office. Porsche&#x27;s chief engineer at the time, Helmuth Bott, approached Schutz with some ideas about the Porsche 911, or more aptly, a new one. Bott knew that the company needed a sports car that they could continue to rely on for years to come and that could be developed as time went on. Curious as to how much they could do with the rear-engined 911, Bott convinced Schutz that development tests should take place, and even proposed researching a new all wheel drive system. Schutz agreed, and gave the project the green light. Bott also knew through experience that a racing program usually helped to accelerate the development of new models. Seeing Group B rallying as the perfect arena to test the new development mule and its all wheel drive system, Bott again went to Schutz and got the approval to develop a car, based on his development mule, for competition in Group B.

The powerplant is a sequential twin-turbocharged DOHC flat-six engine equipped with 4 valves per cylinder, fuel fed by Bosch Motronic 2.1 fuel injection with air-cooled cylinders and water-cooled heads, with a bore x stroke of for a total displacement of . It was coupled to a unique manual transmission offering six forward speeds with the first gear labelled &quot;&quot; (terrain), allowing the car to pass noise regulations, as well as reverse. The engine was largely based on the 4-camshaft 24-valve powerplant used in the Porsche 956 and 962 race cars. These components allowed Porsche to extract at 6,500 rpm and of torque at 5,000 rpm from the compact and efficient power unit.&lt;ref name=&quot;1987/88 Porsche 959&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The use of sequential twin turbochargers rather than the more usual identical turbochargers for each of the two cylinder banks allowed for smooth delivery of power across the engine speed band, in contrast to the abrupt on-off power characteristic that distinguished Porsche&#x27;s other turbocharged engines of the period. The engine was used virtually unchanged in the 959 road car as well.

To create a rugged, lightweight shell, Porsche adopted an aluminium and Aramid (Kevlar) composite for the body panels and chassis construction along with a Nomex floor, instead of the steel floor normally used on their production cars.

Porsche also developed the car&#x27;s aerodynamics, which were designed to increase stability, as was the automatic ride-height adjustment that became available on the road car (961 race cars had a fixed suspension system). Its drag coefficient was as low as 0.31 and aerodynamic lift was eliminated.
The 959 also featured &quot;Porsche-Steuer Kupplung&quot; (PSK) all-wheel-drive system. Capable of dynamically changing the torque distribution between the rear and front wheels in both normal and slip conditions, the PSK system gave the 959 the adaptability it needed both as a race car and as a &quot;super&quot; street car. Under hard acceleration, PSK could send as much as 80% of the available power to the rear wheels, helping make the most of the rear-traction bias that occurs at such times. It could also vary the power bias depending on road surface and grip changes, helping maintain traction at all times. The dashboard featured gauges displaying the amount of rear differential slip as well as transmitted power to the front axle. The magnesium alloy wheels were unique, being hollow inside to form a sealed chamber contiguous with the tyre and equipped with a built-in tyre pressure monitoring system.

The 959 was actually produced at Karosserie Baur, not at the Porsche factory in Zuffenhausen, on an assembly line with Porsche inspectors overseeing the finished bodies. Most of Porsche&#x27;s special order interior leather work was also done by the workers at Baur.

The 1983 Frankfurt Motor Show was chosen for the unveiling of the Porsche Group B prototype. Even in the closing hours of October 9, finishing touches were being applied to the car to go on display the next morning. After the first two prototypes, the bodywork was modified to include air vents in the front and rear wheel housings, as well as intake holes behind the doors. The first prototype receiving those modifications was code named &quot;F3&quot;, and was destroyed in the first crash test.

The road version of the 959 debuted at the 1985 Frankfurt Motor Show as a 1986 model, but numerous issues delayed production by more than a year. The car was manufactured in two levels of trim, &quot;Komfort&quot; and &quot;Sport&quot;, corresponding to the trim with more creature comforts and a more track focused trim. First customer deliveries of the 959 street variant began in 1987, and the car debuted at a cost of DM431,550 (US$225,000) each, still less than half what it cost Porsche to build each car. Production ended in 1988 with 292 cars completed. In total, 337 cars were built, including 37 prototypes and pre-production models. At least one 959 and one 961 remain in the Porsche historic hall in Stuttgart, Germany.

In 1992/1993, Porsche built eight more cars assembled from spare parts from the inventory at the manufacturing site in Zuffenhausen. All eight were &quot;Komfort&quot; versions: four in red and four in silver. These cars were much more expensive (DM 747,500) than the earlier ones. The later cars also featured a newly developed speed-sensitive damper system. The cars were sold to selected collectors after being driven by works personnel for some time and are today by far the most sought-after 959 models.

If desired, even more power was available to customer cars by Porsche. According to Paul Frère there was an optional factory upgrade, with an increased top speed of along with the acceleration time reduced to 3.4 seconds.


==Performance==
Auto, Motor und Sport measured a top speed of and 3.7 seconds for . Those values were recognized by Guinness World Records as highest road tested speed for any road car and highest road tested 0-100 km/h acceleration.

Road &amp; Track measured a top speed of , in 3.6 seconds, in 8.2 seconds and 11.9 seconds at for the quarter mile.

Car and Driver measured 0-60 mph in 3.6 seconds in komfort trim which was 9 tenths quicker than any other car they tested in the 1980s.

== Porsche 959 S ==
The Porsche 959 S was a 959 &quot;Sport&quot; with larger turbochargers that increased power output to 515 PS (379 kW; 508 hp) thus resulting in a top speed of as tested by &quot;Auto, Motor und Sport&quot; at the Nardò Ring in 1988. To save weight, air conditioning, central locking, electric window lift, rear seats and the levelling system for the chassis were omitted. Twenty-nine cars were built.

==Racing==
===Group B / Paris–Dakar Rally===
The 959 was originally meant for Group B racing but development time took longer than expected. The first development race cars, essentially modified 911 Carrera models with all-wheel-drive system known internally as the 953, were entered in the 1984 Paris-Dakar Rally, finishing 1st (René Metge), 6th (Jacky Ickx) and 25th. These cars tested the all-wheel-drive system to be used in the 959. Unlike the World Rally Championship the Dakar didn&#x27;t require a minimum number of cars built for homologation. In 1985, three cars were entered in the Dakar rally with the proposed 959 body and the rest of the systems but they still used the engine of the 953 rally cars. These cars didn&#x27;t finish (only one due to mechanical failure however). Afterwards Porsche fitted the cars with twin-turbochargers. Two cars started at the Rallye des Pharaons in October 1985. One of them caught fire, while Saeed Al-Hajri and John Spiller achieved a commanding victory with their 959. At the 1986 Paris-Dakar Rally the 959 finished 1st (René Metge), 2nd (Jacky Ickx) and 6th.

By the time the 959 was ready for production and homologation in 1987, the Group B programme was cancelled altogether a year prior thus ending Porsche&#x27;s participation in Group B.

===Le Mans and IMSA===

In 1986, the racing variant of the 959, the Porsche 961, made its debut at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Driven by René Metge partnering Claude Ballot-Léna, it finished first in its class and 7th overall. It also participated in the IMSA championship in the United States but suffered tyre issues with Daytona Speedway&#x27;s banking. The 961 returned to Le Mans in 1987 but while in 11th place Canadian/Dutch driver Kees Nierop mis-shifted from 6th into 2nd gear and crashed into the guard-rail. Upon re-joining the track, the car was observed on TV monitors in the Porsche pits to be on fire and the driver was told to stop and get out of the car. Nierop pulled over between marshal stations and this extra time taken to get to the car by the marshals allowed the fire to consume most of the rear end and destroy the car. It was later repaired and put on display at the Porsche Museum.

==Legacy==
In 2003, Canepa Design initiated a 959 upgrade program. By making modifications to the 959&#x27;s turbochargers, exhaust system and computer-control systems, Canepa enabled the 959 to pass emissions requirements, thereby making it street-legal in the United States before falling under the 25 year rule. The upgrade pack has now three generations, as well as a sportier trim available.

In &quot;Pugad Baboy&quot; comic strips, the dog Polgas, in his secret agent persona Agent Pol, has been rewarded with a 959 in lieu of his service and track records in secret service and espionage.

== Legality in the United States ==
A common myth is that Porsche did not provide the United States Department of Transportation (DOT) with four cars required for destructive crash testing, so the car was never certified by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for street use in the U.S. However, this is false as the DOT do not carry out crash testing internally, they simply publish the figures that the manufacturer has released. The manufacturer of a motor vehicle is responsible for their own crash testing. Porsche chose to design and test the 959 to European safety standards only, ignoring NHTSA standards when it was already apparent that the exchange rate between the Deutschmark and US Dollar was so unfavourable that Porsche was losing $200,000 on the sale of each 959.

Owners of the few 959s that entered the country paid storage fees to keep their 959s in so-called Foreign Trade Zones (areas adjacent to US ports where goods are not considered to be in the US for legal purposes) as the cars weren&#x27;t permitted in the US proper.

The 959 could not be made street legal in the United States after the 1988 &quot;Imported Vehicle Safety Compliance Act&quot;. Otis Chandler, Bill Gates, Bruce Canepa, and others managed to convince the US government to allow the 959 to be imported and thus created the Show or Display law in 1999, where a car is allowed to be imported that did not previously meet federalization, but is considered significantly important to car culture.

===The 959 of Bill Gates===
Microsoft founder Bill Gates bought a 959 in 1988. Since the model did not have NHTSA and EPA approval, the car was denied entry into the U.S. Fortunately for the car, it was stored for 13 years by the Customs Service, rather than being destroyed, as is customary with forbidden automobiles. On August 13, 1999, the &quot;Show or Display&quot; law came into force, allowing usage of the car limited to 2,500 annual road miles. The U.S. Customs Service returned the car to Gates soon after.

===25 year exemption===
All 959 cars are now over 25 years old, and therefore no longer need to comply with the unique NHTSA and EPA regulations to avoid destruction by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

<text>Marie Ennemond Camille Jordan (; 5 January 1838 – 22 January 1922) was a French mathematician, known both for his foundational work in group theory and for his influential &quot;Cours d&#x27;analyse&quot;.

==Biography==
Jordan was born in Lyon and educated at the École polytechnique. He was an engineer by profession; later in life he taught at the École polytechnique and the Collège de France, where he had a reputation for eccentric choices of notation.

He is remembered now by name in a number of results:

* The Jordan curve theorem, a topological result required in complex analysis
* The Jordan normal form and the Jordan matrix in linear algebra
* In mathematical analysis, Jordan measure (or &quot;Jordan content&quot;) is an area measure that predates measure theory
* In group theory, the Jordan–Hölder theorem on composition series is a basic result.
* Jordan&#x27;s theorem on finite linear groups

Jordan&#x27;s work did much to bring Galois theory into the mainstream. He also investigated the Mathieu groups, the first examples of sporadic groups. His &quot;Traité des substitutions&quot;, on permutation groups, was published in 1870; this treatise won for Jordan the 1870 &quot;prix Poncelet&quot;. He was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1920 in Strasbourg.

The asteroid 25593 Camillejordan and are named in his honour.

Camille Jordan is not to be confused with the geodesist Wilhelm Jordan (Gauss–Jordan elimination) or the physicist Pascual Jordan (Jordan algebras).

<doc id="355950" wikidata="Q2661864" url="?curid=355950" title="Susan Sto Helit">
<text>Susan Sto Helit (also spelled Sto-Helit), once referred to as Susan Death, is a fictional character in Terry Pratchett&#x27;s &quot;Discworld&quot; series of fantasy novels. She is the granddaughter of Death, the Disc&#x27;s Grim Reaper, and has a number of his abilities. She appears in three &quot;Discworld&quot; novels: &quot;Soul Music&quot;, &quot;Hogfather&quot;, and &quot;Thief of Time&quot;. Being both human and supernatural, Susan is frequently and reluctantly forced away from her attempts at normal life to do battle with malign supernatural forces or to take on her grandfather&#x27;s job in his absence. Death tends to rely on her in his battles against the Auditors of Reality, particularly in situations where he has no power or influence. As the series progresses, she also begins to take on roles educating children, so that, as Pratchett mentions in &quot;The Art of Discworld&quot;, she has &quot;ended up, via that unconscious evolution that dogs characters, a kind of Goth Mary Poppins&quot;.

==Character==
Susan is the daughter of Ysabell, Death&#x27;s daughter via adoption, who is introduced in &quot;The Light Fantastic&quot;, and Mort, who was briefly Death&#x27;s apprentice in the book &quot;Mort&quot;. At the end of &quot;Mort&quot; they leave Death&#x27;s domain and become Duke and Duchess of Sto Helit, taking the motto &quot;Non Temetis Messor&quot;: &quot;Don&#x27;t Fear the Reaper.&quot; Susan is their only child.

Susan is introduced in &quot;Soul Music&quot; as a sixteen-year-old pupil at the Quirm College for Young Ladies, shortly after the deaths of her parents. Initially blaming Death for not saving them, she has come to accept that he is able only to grant them an eternal moment in his domain, which they have refused. After graduating — and despite being Duchess of Sto Helit — she begins a teaching career, first as a governess, in &quot;Hogfather&quot;, and then as a schoolteacher, in &quot;Thief of Time&quot;. She insists on being addressed as Miss Susan.

In &quot;Soul Music&quot; Death takes a holiday from his work in an attempt to forget his more troubling memories, and a metaphysical vacancy is created. Susan is sucked in, as Death&#x27;s manservant Albert puts it, forcing her to assume the role. At first she desires to use her power to help humanity, but as the book progresses she comes to realise that she is powerless to interfere, and discovers the inevitability of death and destiny. She is released from the position following the return of her grandfather, who breaks the rules in order to save the rock star Imp Y Celyn and his band.

In &quot;Hogfather&quot; the Auditors employ Mr Teatime, an assassin who attempts to destroy the Hogfather using teeth found at the Tooth Fairy&#x27;s castle to control children. Death cannot enter the Tooth Fairy&#x27;s castle because it is constructed from the imaginations of children, who have no concept of death, and therefore arranges for Susan to foil their plan instead. After removing all of the Auditors&#x27; human agents from the Tooth Fairy&#x27;s country, Susan saves the Hogfather from being destroyed by a group of Auditors who have taken the forms of dogs. She later kills Mr Teatime by impaling him with the poker she uses to threaten monsters.

In &quot;Thief of Time&quot; Susan once again comes into conflict with the Auditors, who are now attempting to stop time altogether. She is forced to find the son of Time, whom Death cannot influence or even see, because, being only mostly human, the boy is not subject to death. Susan is aided in her mission by Lu-Tze, a sweeper and definitely not a Monk of Time, and Myria LeJean/Unity, a former Auditor who has become human. Time&#x27;s husband, Wen the Eternally Surprised, describes her as &quot;helpfulness personified&quot;.

===Physical appearance===
Susan is a &quot;slightly built young woman&quot;; both Mustrum Ridcully and Terry Pratchett himself have described her as being &quot;attractive in a skinny way&quot;. Her hair is pure white, but with a streak of black running through it from end to end. Although its natural state is a frizzy mass reminiscent of a dandelion, it rearranges its style of its own accord depending on Susan&#x27;s mood; it tends to form a tight bun while she is working. Susan&#x27;s hair is an inverted homage to Elsa Lanchester&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot;, in which she wore a black beehive wig with white streaks. In &quot;The Art of Discworld&quot;, Paul Kidby draws Susan in Edwardian clothing, which he feels fits well with her job as a nanny in &quot;Hogfather&quot;.

Susan has a very striking physical presence, which both Lu-Tze and Lobsang Ludd have remarked upon, and despite her relative youth, she projects a sense of great age. She possesses a birthmark on her cheek that shows itself only when she blushes; it consists of three finger-like lines that were left on her father when Death slapped him in &quot;Mort&quot;, and which glow when she is angry. In &quot;Soul Music&quot;, she complains that, as Death&#x27;s granddaughter, she should have been born with better cheekbones. She also has a Look (always capitalised) which can be rather disconcerting, even to those in authority, such as her grandfather and the headmistress of the school in which she teaches. In the television special, her Look is shown as being able to turn her face into something rather similar to a skull.

===Powers and abilities===
Despite only being Death&#x27;s Granddaughter by adoption, Susan has inherited certain of his abilities: she can &quot;&quot;walk through walls and live outside time and be a little bit immortal&quot;.&quot; As well as being able to find any living creature, Susan can sense whether or not an is human. She can understand the intentions of the Death of Rats even though she cannot directly interpret its speech, and has the ability to use her grandfather&#x27;s voice to command or intimidate others. This speech is indicated, similar to Death&#x27;s, &quot;&quot;; however, unlike those of her grandfather, the words which Susan speaks in this voice are often (if not always) enclosed within quotation marks, particularly in &quot;Hogfather&quot;.

Susan has inherited Death&#x27;s perfect memory, which includes the ability to &quot;remember the future&quot;, and an instinctive knowledge of the nature of Death&#x27;s work, which gives her considerable assistance during her brief time doing her grandfather&#x27;s job in &quot;Soul Music&quot;. In order to keep her from going insane, her mind represses much of the knowledge provided by this memory, but even so, parts of it occasionally permeate her consciousness, generally manifesting as s or intuitive insights into forthcoming events. In &quot;Hogfather&quot;, she states that the fragmented nature of such foresight makes the power largely unhelpful.

Like Death or experienced witches, Susan can make herself completely unnoticeable to ordinary people if she so chooses, though anyone who &quot;can see what&#x27;s really there&quot;, such as Albert or Mustrum Ridcully, who are used to such things, are still able to see her if they concentrate and she is not actively trying to avoid their specific notice. During her time at Quirm College, she unconsciously used this power to avoid being asked questions in subjects in which she had no interest, such as Literature and History. Unfortunately, this caused the teachers of these subjects to believe that Susan was not attending their classes, and she was reported to the headmistress on several occasions. She solved this problem by using her power to erase the headmistress&#x27; memory of her supposed misconduct.

She possesses a unique perspective on life, in that she lacks the normal human ability to ignore things which do not fit in with a logical world-view: in &quot;Soul Music&quot;, she is able to acknowledge the enormous size of the rooms in Death&#x27;s Domain, whereas most humans can only deal with the incomprehensible vastness by pretending it is not there; &quot;Hogfather&quot; reveals that she shares the ability of witches, wizards and young children to see things which are invisible to most people, such as the tooth fairy, monsters and bogeymen; in &quot;Thief of Time&quot;, she is able to identify the historical anomalies created by the History Monks&#x27; reconstruction of the shattered timeline. The latter novel also reveals that Susan possesses a sort of hyperawareness of the world around her, in that she is &quot;&quot;aware of every step of the rocks beneath [her] feet and the stars overhead&quot;.&quot;

On various occasions, unusual circumstances have rendered some or all of Susan&#x27;s powers useless: In &quot;Hogfather&quot;, she becomes completely human and finds herself bereft of her inherited gifts upon entering the Tooth Fairy&#x27;s castle. This is because the laws of reality within the castle are based on the beliefs of children, which do not include a concept of death; hence the part of Susan which is derived from Death does not exist there. In &quot;Thief of Time&quot;, Susan finds herself unable to walk through walls while time is being held in stasis. She speculates that the energy of the glass clock which is holding time static is in some way interfering with her power.

Due in part to her education at Quirm College for Young Ladies, Susan possesses various practical skills, some of which contribute to her success as a governess and later a teacher: she is accomplished in the fields of Mathematics and Logic (priding herself on her ability to mentally calculate the square root of 27.4), is multilingual, and has considerable knowledge of Discworld culture. She is also a competent swimmer, being versed in four swimming strokes and several lifesaving techniques.

Despite coming from a technically purely human background, Susan has inherited abilities from her adoptive Grandfather through more-than-conventional means: her mother, Ysabell, was merely adopted into Death&#x27;s family; her father, Mort, merely married into Death&#x27;s family; whereas Susan was conceived and born in Death&#x27;s family. In the novels, it is said &quot;&quot;some things were inherited through more than genetics...some things were inherited through the soul...some things were in the bones&quot;.&quot;

===Personality and traits===
Susan&#x27;s most obvious character trait is being sensible, an attribute carefully cultivated by her parents as a counterbalance to the influence of her grandfather. Initially, this manifested itself as a refusal to admit the supernatural side of the world (beyond basic magic) even existed. This is not surprising, given the fact that her parents had informed her from a very early age that there were no such things as the Soul Cake Duck, the Hogfather or the Tooth Fairy. It has even been suggested that her parents chose to name her Susan specifically because of the sensible and conventional connotations of the name. This upbringing has instilled in her a certain lack of romanticism; her personal appraisal of &quot;a poem about daffodils&quot; is, &quot;Apparently the poet had liked them very much.&quot; She can be relied upon to keep her head in a crisis, something she tends to view as a character flaw.

Latterly, she accepts that she is part of the same world as the Hogfather and the Tooth Fairy—she just wishes she weren&#x27;t. Indeed, in &quot;Hogfather&quot;, she is seen to be making an immense effort to remain &#x27;normal&#x27;, carefully limiting her use of her inherited powers and forcing herself to act in as &#x27;human&#x27; a way as possible. She mentions having great difficulty in remembering things which other humans take for granted, such as the purpose of doorknobs, the way to fall asleep and how to forget things, but argues that, if she were to abandon this struggle, and give herself fully to her supernatural side, she would lose her humanity. In &quot;Thief of Time&quot;, though still resentful of having been born Death&#x27;s granddaughter and attempting to avoid too much contact with the supernatural world, she appears to have accepted and even embraced her heritage: she admits, albeit grudgingly, that she is not completely human, frequently uses her powers to provide teaching aids, and views herself as an exception to the rules of normal human society, as evidenced by her willingness to investigate the personal papers of her employer, Madame Frout, without her knowledge.

In following with her practical outlook on life, Susan does not have a great deal of patience with people who behave in an inefficient or unfocussed fashion. She also has a certain distrust for philosophy, disliking its attempts to oversimplify an inherently complicated world.

She appears to have a preference for the colour black, in that most of her childhood drawings were done in this colour (mentioned in &quot;Soul Music&quot;). This fixation is not as extreme as that which her mother possessed for the colour pink, and may in fact be a characteristic inherited from Death, who made most of the decorations for his Domain black. She has an intense fixation on chocolate (provided there is no nougat in it), one about which she is very defensive.

Another aspect of her personality which may stem from her relationship with Death is the fact that she is, by her own admission, &quot;not very musical&quot; (her grandfather also possessed a distinct lack of talent in the field of music, making several unsuccessful attempts to learn how to play the violin and the banjo). This may be the result of her aforementioned upbringing in which imagination and creativity were not encouraged to any degree, making it more of an environmentally instilled trait than an inherited one.

Susan has, on several occasions, demonstrated rather unusual attitudes toward school and education in general: In &quot;Soul Music&quot;, she cites school as one of the greatest obstacles to education, and in &quot;Hogfather&quot;, she compares being educated to having a communicable sexual disease, in that &quot;It made you unsuitable for a lot of jobs and then you had the urge to pass it on&quot;.

She has expressed a fondness for children, as long as they are &quot;not raw&quot;; hopefully meaning that although the idea of having children herself does not appeal to her, she enjoys spending time with those of other people. She also demonstrates an insight into the more disturbing aspects of childhood nature, as she enjoys listening to the sound of children playing while she is reading, but always positions herself at such a distance that she is unable to hear what the children are saying, lest she find it unsettling. Because of this insight, she has a knack for putting problem children (such as those who try to get around her rules) in their place.

===Teaching methods===
As the novels progress, Susan proves to be quite good at handling small children, a skill that is attributed to her sensible and practical nature. This is reflected in her novel approach to children&#x27;s problems. When a child complains about a monster in the cupboard or under the bed, most parents would go to great lengths to carefully explain to the child that there is no monster. Susan, on the other hand, simply hands the child a suitable weapon with which to assault the monster, or, in the event of an &quot;actual&quot; monster, assaults it herself. Monsters, bogeymen, etc., from a wide area have come to dread the fireplace poker she uses for this task, although as word of Susan has quickly spread among the city&#x27;s resident monsters, she lately has only needed to deal with newcomers. Her practical nature is quite similar to Granny Weatherwax&#x27;s &quot;headology&quot;, though the two are used in different fashions.

Her approach in other areas is also unusual. For example, in her role as a governess she has found that her charges&#x27; reading progress has been greatly enhanced by using interesting books which are slightly too difficult for them, and which therefore present something of a challenge. Parents have reservations about her choice of General Tacticus&#x27; &quot;Campaigns&quot; as a reader, since it may be argued that children under ten do not necessarily need to be able to spell &#x27;disembowelled&#x27;. When other adults point out that children should find these exercises too advanced, Susan acknowledges this, but points out that she hasn&#x27;t told the children this and so far they seem not to be bothered about it.

Using her powers as a teaching aid in her career as a schoolteacher, Susan is sufficiently successful as to have parents clamouring in large numbers to have their child included in her class. Her approach to history and geography, subjects which children often find rather dull, has particularly captured her class&#x27;s attention. Parents generally see the occasional need to clean their children&#x27;s clothing of dried-in bloodstains or ground-in swamp mud as more than compensated for by the broad education being received. A child&#x27;s description of one of the classic battles from Ankh-Morpork&#x27;s long history, for example, might be sufficiently vivid and detailed to make the parent think that the description could not have been improved upon if the child had actually seen the battle at first hand—which in fact they have, given the flexibility of time and space Susan has inherited from her grandfather.

Susan&#x27;s role as a caregiver to children, combined with her no-nonsense style and almost magical flair for stick-like weaponry (e.g. her grandfather&#x27;s scythe, field hockey sticks, a fireplace poker), can be seen as a parody of Mary Poppins. Mary Poppins also had a very similar attitude while actively encouraging positive imagination (Susan tends to say things like &quot;&quot;Real children don&#x27;t go hoppity-skip unless they&#x27;re on drugs&quot;), took children on magical adventures (Susan does so to teach geography), introduced children to supernatural creatures (Susan employs such beings as guest speakers, including her own grandfather), and had a magic umbrella (which, while not used as a blunt object, was magical much like Death&#x27;s scythe). Neither character openly acknowledges her magical powers. Both tend toward being actively insulted when reminded of their use. The link between Susan and Mary Poppins is explicitly alluded to in &quot;Hogfather&quot;, when Susan states that &quot;She&#x27;d sworn that if she did indeed ever find herself dancing on rooftops with chimney sweeps, she&#x27;d beat herself to death with her own umbrella&quot;.&quot;

==Relationships==
In &quot;The Art of Discworld&quot;, Pratchett describes Susan as &quot;rather chilly&quot;, and Susan herself admits in &quot;Thief of Time&quot; that she finds it difficult to relate to other humans on a personal level because the supernatural parts of her mind tend to view mortal creatures as nothing more than &quot;a temporary collection of atoms that [will] not be around in another few decades&quot;. She has yet to demonstrate much affection for others, though her relationship with her grandfather, once strained, improves over the course of the series. Despite this, she finds herself unable to trust him completely because of the way he occasionally manipulates her into helping him.

===Romantic relationships===
Though Susan was previously infatuated with rocker Imp Y Celyn (&quot;Soul Music&quot;), &quot;Thief of Time&quot; ended with an unspecified &quot;perfect moment&quot; between Susan and Lobsang Ludd, the new anthropomorphic personification of Time. Though the moment itself was not described, Ludd caught her attention by levitating metallic silver and gold stars and setting them spinning about near the ceiling of the Stationery Cupboard, and dimming the lighting to velvety darkness, both rather romantic gestures. Also, Myria (later known as Unity) bluntly questioned Susan as to whether or not she had romantic intentions in regard to the boy, to which Susan responded with the defensive attitude she usually reserves for her fondness of chocolates.

<text>Brian Holland (born February 15, 1941) is an American songwriter and record producer, best known as a member of Holland–Dozier–Holland, the songwriting and production team that was responsible for much of the Motown sound, and numerous hit records by artists such as Martha and the Vandellas, The Supremes, The Four Tops, and The Isley Brothers. Holland, along with Lamont Dozier, served as the team&#x27;s musical arranger and producer. He has written or co-written 145 hits in US and 78 in the UK.

==Early life==
Holland was born in Detroit, Michigan, United States. He is brother to Eddie Holland. 

For a short time, he partnered with Robert Bateman, and together they were known as &quot;Brianbert&quot;, collaborating on such hits as &quot;Please Mr. Postman&quot; for The Marvelettes. Holland has also had an on-and-off career as a performer. He released a solo single in 1958 under the name of &quot;Briant Holland&quot;. He and longtime friend and future songwriting partner Freddie Gorman were in a short-lived group called the Fidalatones, and he was later (1960–62) a member of the Motown recording act The Satintones, as well as being a member of the Rayber Voices, a quartet that backed up several early Motown recording acts. He partnered with Lamont Dozier under the name &quot;Holland–Dozier&quot;, releasing a lone single for Motown in 1963, then was inactive for a number of years, and was then revived in the early and mid-1970s, scoring a number of medium-sized R&amp;B hits. Holland resumed his solo recording career in 1974, hitting the charts as a solo artist in 1974 and 1975.

==Later life==
Holland also composed songs for the &quot;First Wives Club&quot; musical.

==Author==
In 2019, Brian (along with brother Eddie and Dave Thompson) co-authored an autobiography of Holland–Dozier–Holland, entitled &quot;Come and Get These Memories&quot;, named after the hit single by Martha and the Vandellas.

<text>Frederic Vester (November 23, 1925 – November 2, 2003) was a German biochemist, and an expert in the field of ecology.

== Biography ==
Vester was born in Saarbrücken, and studied chemistry at the universities of Mainz, Paris and Hamburg. From 1955 to 1957, he was postdoctoral fellow at Yale University, and Cambridge. From 1957 to 1966 he worked at Saarland University, Saarbrücken, and from 1969 he worked in Munich, first at the Max Planck Institute. In 1970 he founded the private Munich-based &quot;Frederic Vester Studiengruppe für Biologie und Umwelt GmbH&quot; (&quot;Frederic Vester Study Group for Biology and Environment, Ltd.), renamed &quot;Frederic Vester GmbH&quot; (&quot;Frederic Vester, Ltd.&quot;) after his death.

From 1982 to 1989 he was a professor at the Bundeswehr University Munich, and from 1989 to 1991 he was Professor for Applied Economics at the Hochschule St. Gallen, Switzerland. Vester&#x27;s ideas influenced the formation of the environmental movement and the Green Party in Germany. He was a member of the Club of Rome. He was married to Anne Vester. The couple had three children and six grandchildren. He died in Munich.

== Work ==
=== Networked thinking ===
Vester was known as pioneer of networked thinking, a combination of cybernetic and systemic ideas and complexity. Central ideas of network thinking include viewing a system as a network of interrelated effects, leading to emergent behavior of the system as a whole. These networks can be described by using protocols, mathematical networks, computer software, so that even someone with the most basic understanding of networks will see relations, including positive and negative feedback loops. Simulations of systemic networks can help to decide the long-term effects of singular measures.

=== &quot;Sensitivity Model&quot; ===
Vester&#x27;s &quot;Sensitivity Model&quot; combines these ideas, and has been used since the 1980s in studies by Ford, UNESCO and other organizations.

== Publications ==
Most of Vesters books were published in German as well as in other languages, though seldom in English. A list of his works includes:
* 1976, &quot;Ballungsgebiete in der Krise&quot; (Urban Systems in Crisis)
* 1979, &quot;Das Überlebensprogramm&quot; (Plan for Survival)
* 1982, &quot;Das kybernetische Zeitalter&quot; (The Cybernetic Age)
* 1985, &quot;Ein Baum ist mehr als ein Baum&quot; (A Tree is More than a Tree)
* 1990, &quot;Leitmotiv vernetztes Denken&quot; (Key Themes of Networked Thinking)
* 1991, &quot;Ausfahrt Zukunft: Strategien für den Verkehr von morgen&quot; (Gateway Future: Strategies for the Transportation of Tomorrow)
* 1999, &quot;Crashtest Mobilität&quot; (Crash Test Mobility)
* 2002, &quot;Aufmerksamkeit im Unterricht&quot; (Attentiveness in the Classroom)

* 2002, &quot;Unsere Welt - ein vernetztes System&quot; (Our World - A Networked System)
* 2007, &quot;The Art of interconnected Thinking. Ideas and Tools for Tackling Complexity&quot; (MCB) 

Vester is also the author of the software tool &quot;Sensitivity model&quot; and of several cybernetic games:

* 1997 &quot;Ecopolicy – das kybernetische Strategiespiel&quot; (Ecopolicy - The Cybernetic Strategy Game)
* 1980/1996 &quot;Ökolopoly. Ein kybernetisches Umweltspiel&quot; (Ecopoly - A Cybernetic Environment Game)

<text>Edward James Holland Jr. (born October 30, 1939) is an American singer, songwriter, and record producer. He is brother to Brian Holland. 

Holland was born in Detroit, Michigan, United States. Although he was an early Motown artist who recorded minor hit singles such as &quot;Jamie&quot;, he started working behind the scenes due to stage fright. He was a member of Holland–Dozier–Holland, the songwriting and production team responsible for much of the Motown Sound and hit records by Martha and the Vandellas, The Supremes, The Four Tops, and The Isley Brothers, among others. He has written or co-written 143 hits in the US charts and 80 in the UK.

Holland served as the team&#x27;s lyricist, and also worked with producer Norman Whitfield on lyrics for the songs he produced for the Marvelettes and the Temptations, like &quot;Too Many Fish in the Sea&quot; and &quot;Beauty Is Only Skin Deep&quot;.

==Later life==
Holland also composed songs for the &quot;First Wives Club&quot; musical.

Holland has been involved in several civil court cases regarding tax, loans, and music rights, in 1985, 1988, 1996, 2017, and 2020.

==Author==
In 2019, Brian (along with brother Eddie and Dave Thompson) co-authored an autobiography of Holland–Dozier–Holland, entitled &quot;Come and Get These Memories&quot;, named after the hit single by Martha and the Vandellas.

<doc id="355966" wikidata="Q1135593" url="?curid=355966" title="London Assembly">
<text>The London Assembly is a 25-member elected body, part of the Greater London Authority, that scrutinises the activities of the Mayor of London and has the power, with a two-thirds supermajority, to amend the Mayor&#x27;s annual budget and to reject the Mayor&#x27;s draft statutory strategies. The London Assembly was established in 2000. It is also able to investigate other issues of importance to Londoners (most notably transport or environmental matters), publish its findings and recommendations, and make proposals to the Mayor.

==Assembly members==
The Assembly comprises 25 members elected using the additional-member system of mixed-member proportional representation, with 13 seats needed for a majority. Elections take place every four years, at the same time as those for the mayor of London. There are 14 geographical constituencies, each electing one member, with a further 11 members elected from a party list to make the total number of Assembly members from each party proportional to the votes cast for that party across the whole of London using a modified D&#x27;Hondt allocation. A party must win at least 5% of the party list vote in order to win any seats. Members of the London Assembly have the post-nominal title &quot;AM&quot;. The annual salary for a London Assembly member is approximately £60,416.

===Former Assembly members===
Since its creation in 2000, sixteen Assembly members subsequently were elected to the House of Commons: David Lammy, Meg Hillier, Diana Johnson, and Florence Eshalomi for Labour; Andrew Pelling, Bob Neill, Angie Bray, Bob Blackman, Eric Ollerenshaw, Victoria Borwick, James Cleverly, Kit Malthouse, Kemi Badenoch, and Gareth Bacon for the Conservatives; Lynne Featherstone for the Liberal Democrats and Siân Berry for the Green Party.

One Assembly member, Jenny Jones, was elevated to the House of Lords as the Green Party&#x27;s first life peer in 2013, continuing to sit in the Assembly until May 2016. Sally Hamwee, Graham Tope, and Toby Harris were already peers when elected to the assembly, while Lynne Featherstone and Dee Doocey were created life peers after standing down from the Assembly.

Val Shawcross, AM for Lambeth and Southwark, unsuccessfully contested Bermondsey and Old Southwark as the Labour parliamentary candidate at the 2010 general election, and Navin Shah stood unsuccessfully as the Labour candidate for Harrow East in 2017. Andrew Dismore, Graham Tope, and the late Richard Tracey are all former MPs later elected to the assembly. John Biggs, formerly AM for City and East, served as the directly elected mayor of Tower Hamlets from 2015 until 2022.

===Structure of the Assembly===
London Assembly elections have been held under the additional member system, with a set number of constituencies elected on a first-past-the-post system and a set number London-wide on a closed party list system. Terms are for four years, so despite the delayed 2020 election, which was held in 2021, the following election was held in 2024.

In December 2016, an Electoral Reform Bill was introduced which would have changed the election system to first-past-the-post. At the 2017 general election, the Conservative Party manifesto proposed changing how the Assembly is elected to first-past-the-post.

However, since the general election of 2017, which resulted in a hung Parliament with the Conservatives and the Democratic Unionist Party in a confidence and supply arrangement, no action has been taken with regard to the electoral arrangements of the London Assembly, and the 2020 election, delayed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, was held on the current electoral system of AMS (constituencies and regional lists).

On 12 December 2018, following Peter Whittle&#x27;s departure from UKIP, he and David Kurten disbanded the UKIP grouping and formed the Brexit Alliance group.

In March 2019, following the departure of Tom Copley and Fiona Twycross to take up full-time Deputy Mayor roles, Murad Qureshi and Alison Moore replaced them as Labour Assembly members. The end of the term in office for AMs was extended from May 2020 to May 2021, as no elections were being held during the COVID-19 pandemic.

===List of current Assembly members===

==List of chairs of the London Assembly==

==Committees==
The Assembly has formed the following committees:

* Audit Panel, chaired by Neil Garratt
* Budget and Performance Committee, chaired by Neil Garratt
* Confirmation Hearings Committee 
* Economy Committee, chaired by Marina Ahmad
* Environment Committee, chaired by Zack Polanski
* Fire, Resilience and Emergency Planning Committee, chaired by Hina Bokhari
* GLA Oversight Committee, chaired by Emma Best
* Health Committee, chaired by Krupesh Hirani
* Housing Committee, chaired by Sem Moema
* Planning and Regeneration Committee, chaired by Andrew Boff
* Police and Crime Committee, chaired by Susan Hall
* Transport Committee, chaired by Elly Baker

The Police and Crime Committee was set up under the terms of the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011 in order to scrutinise the work of Mayor&#x27;s Office for Policing and Crime, which replaced the Metropolitan Police Authority.

== Result maps ==
These maps only show constituency results and not list results.
== London Youth Assembly ==
The London Assembly also operates a London Youth Assembly, which is made up of young people from across London. Each London borough elects or selects a representative and deputy representative to serve on the assembly. The procedure for choosing a representative is different in each borough, with some boroughs electing representatives while other representatives are selected by their local youth forum or council. Representatives are aged 11 to 19, or 11 to 25 if they have a disability or special needs. A representative may be known as a London Youth Assembly Member (LYAM) and a deputy representative may be known as a Deputy London Youth Assembly Member (DLYAM).

<text>UPGMA (unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean) is a simple agglomerative (bottom-up) hierarchical clustering method. It also has a weighted variant, WPGMA, and they are generally attributed to Sokal and Michener.

Note that the unweighted term indicates that all distances contribute equally to each average that is computed and does not refer to the math by which it is achieved. Thus the simple averaging in WPGMA produces a weighted result and the proportional averaging in UPGMA produces an unweighted result (&quot;see the working example&quot;).

==Algorithm==
The UPGMA algorithm constructs a rooted tree (dendrogram) that reflects the structure present in a pairwise similarity matrix (or a dissimilarity matrix).
At each step, the nearest two clusters are combined into a higher-level cluster. The distance between any two clusters formula_1 and formula_2, each of size (&quot;i.e.&quot;, cardinality) formula_3 and formula_3, is taken to be the average of all distances formula_5 between pairs of objects formula_6 in formula_1 and formula_8 in formula_2, that is, the mean distance between elements of each cluster:
::formula_10

In other words, at each clustering step, the updated distance between the joined clusters formula_11 and a new cluster formula_12 is given by the proportional averaging of the formula_13 and formula_14 distances:

formula_15 time complexity, and using a heap for each cluster to keep its distances from other cluster reduces its time to formula_16. Fionn Murtagh presented an formula_17 time and space algorithm.
