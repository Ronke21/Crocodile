<text>The central bearded dragon (Pogona vitticeps), also known as the inland bearded dragon, is a species of agamid lizard found in a wide range of arid to semiarid regions of eastern and central Australia.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Pogona vitticeps&quot; was first described by German zoologist Ernst Ahl in 1926, who placed it in the genus &quot;Amphibolurus&quot;.

==Description==

Mature bearded dragons can reach a total length of around , or two feet, with the tail accounting for more than half of that. Some sexual dimorphism is present, as males can be distinguished from females by a wider cloacal opening, a wider tail-base, a larger and more angular head, a more developed beard (guttural throat-pouch), and the obvious possession of hemipenes. Males also have more pronounced femoral pores than females (these can be seen as waxy bumps on the underside of the back legs). Bearded dragons can vary widely in scale colouration, ranging from a blend of light brown, reddish-brown, red, yellow, white and orange; additionally, many interesting colour &quot;morphs&quot; exist today, thanks to selective breeding by hobbyists and professionals. 

Somewhat like chameleons, bearded dragons are capable of inducing moderate changes in coloration based on mood. Additionally, they can slightly raise the pointed scales that run along either side of their throat, neck, head and torso by inhaling air into their lungs to maximum capacity, thus appearing larger to predators. The sharp-looking growths and protrusions are, in actuality, quite soft and delicate to the touch, but may be off-putting to predators such as birds of prey, foxes, feral dogs or dingos. When cornered or threatened, a bearded dragon will flatten its body against the ground, expand its rib cage outwards, open its mouth and expand its &quot;beard&quot; (guttural pouch; similar to a frilled lizard’s defense tactics, albeit on a smaller scale). The guttural pouch is what essentially earns the species its nickname of &quot;beardie&quot;, and can darken in color when threatened or during courtship or territorial displays. Both of these characteristics appear similar to a human&#x27;s beard. Males typically have a darker &quot;beard&quot; than females, and during mating season and courtship it will typically darken to near-black. The bearded dragon, like most agamid lizards, has strong legs which enable it to lift its body completely off the ground while it moves. This is done to reduce heat absorption from the hot ground, and facilitates airflow under the body.

A study conducted in 2014 established the existence of endogenous circadian rhythm in pigmentation changes in &quot;P. vitticeps;&quot; if exposed to sun, the dorsal skin of the lizard becomes darker, and if exposed to darkness, it becomes lighter. Under constant darkness (i.e. in the subjective night), the lizard&#x27;s dorsal skin becomes the lightest.

Many species of &quot;Pogona&quot; have a parietal eye (or &quot;third eye&quot;), a photoreceptor found on the center of the forehead. This unique feature is responsible for thermoregulation and hormone regulation, and possibly helps the lizards make decisions based on the seasons, weather, etc. A March 2020 study of the central bearded dragon found that light-dependent magnetoreception occurs when light with a wavelength under 580 nanometers enters the parietal eye.

==Ecology and behaviour==

&quot;P. vitticeps&quot; is native to semiarid woodland, arid woodland, and rocky desert areas of Central Australia, primarily the inland regions of New South Wales, Northern Territory, Queensland and South Australia. They are skilled climbers and often spend just as much time perching and basking on tree limbs, fence posts, and within bushes as they do on the ground. They often spend the mornings and early evenings sunning themselves on exposed branches or rocks, and retreat to shady areas or burrows during the hottest parts of the afternoon.

&quot;P. vitticeps&quot; are opportunistic omnivores. They live in areas where food may be hard to find, thus they are not particularly finicky eaters. Their stomachs are large enough to accommodate significant quantities of vegetation, fruits, insects, worms, and the occasional small rodent or lizard. Favored insect prey includes crickets, grasshoppers, beetles, caterpillars, moths, butterflies, or any insect that can comfortably be swallowed. They will also eat mealworms, kingworms, parsley and kale and vegetables like pepper and sweet potato. An analysis of their summer diet as wild adults revealed that 26% of the food ingested (by volume) was &quot;Drepanotermes&quot; termite alates, which are only seasonally available. Plant matter made up 54% of the diet by volume. 

Bearded dragons do not vocalize, except to hiss softly when threatened. Instead, they communicate through colour displays, posture, and physical gestures, such as arm waving and head bobbing. Bearded dragons are not social animals, but will sometimes gather in groups, especially in popular feeding or basking areas. At these times, a distinct hierarchy will emerge: the highest-ranking animals will take the best – usually the highest or sunniest – basking spots, and all other individuals arrange themselves lower down. If a low-ranking animal tries to challenge one of the dominant dragons, the dominant animal will demonstrate its superiority by bobbing its head and inflating its beard, at which point the challenger may signal submission by waving one of its arms in a slow or fast circle. If the low-ranking dragon does not submit, it will return the head bob, and a standoff or fight may ensue.

The head bob gestures are:

*Slow bowing motion – often used by adult females to signal submission to a male
*Fast bob – used by males to signal dominance (often accompanied by an inflated and/or blackened beard)
*Violent bob – used by males just before mating; much more vigorous, and usually sets the animal&#x27;s whole body in motion
*Both males and females will occasionally do fast and violent head bobs, which shows they are stressed out and need to be isolated.

The male will only wave to show submission to a dominant male, whereas the female will wave, followed by a slow head bob, to show she is ready to mate. Gravid females will often refuse the advances of a male by chasing him and lying on his back.

When under direct attack, the central bearded dragon opens its mouth to display its yellow membranes and extend its beard. It darkens the colour of its skin and flattens its body, and will hiss and make small jumps towards the attacker. Bearded dragons are not known to attack humans.

Adult male bearded dragons can bite more forcefully than adult females and this difference is associated with greater head dimensions.

Bearded dragons have been shown to be able to learn from watching the behaviour of conspecifics. An experiment demonstrated that after one individual was trained to open a door to reach a food item, most other bearded dragons watching this action were able to perform it as well.

==Reproduction==

The age of sexual maturity has not been measured, although it is estimated to be about one or two years. Body size and growth rates are more important than age when determining sexual maturity in bearded dragons. Males will become very aggressive towards each other and will assert their dominance by inflating their beards and through fast head bobbing. Breeding typically occurs in the early spring. Females will lay a clutch of 11–30 oblong-shaped eggs in a shallow nest dug in the sand. After being laid, the eggs are buried and are left unattended. The eggs will hatch approximately 60 to 80 days later, depending on the incubation temperature. In captivity, they can be incubated in a styrofoam fish box, but without a male lizard, the female&#x27;s eggs will not be fertile. However, a female bearded dragon can retain sperm, and thus produce fertile eggs even after being separated from a male.

Courtship involves the male &quot;head bobbing&quot; to display dominance. If the female displays submissive behaviour, the male will use his mouth to grab the back of the female&#x27;s head and the male will also wrap his front legs around the female&#x27;s upper torso to keep her from moving. Copulation and insemination are quick. The gestation period averages about a month and a half.

===Thermally-induced sex reversal===
A 2015 study showed that high-temperature incubation of eggs transforms genetically male individuals into functional females. Normally their sex is determined genetically. Males have ZZ sex chromosomes, females ZW. However, when their eggs are incubated at temperatures above 32 °C (90 °F) some genetic males are born female. These females are fertile, sometimes producing more eggs than the ZW females. As juveniles, the sex reversed ZZ females resemble ZZ males with respect to relative tail length and boldness. However, as adults sex-reversed ZZ females lack the larger head and greater bite force of ZZ males and more closely resemble ZW females.

==Captive breeding==

Several of the &quot;Pogona&quot; genus are bred in captivity as pets; the two most popular are this species and the Rankin&#x27;s dragon (&quot;Pogona henrylawsoni&quot;). The majority of captive-bred bearded dragons today are thought to have originated from stock illegally exported from Australia during the 1970s. Australia has since prohibited the importation and exportation of its native species, thus guaranteeing any bearded dragons found today outside of Australia have been captive-bred, hand-raised and socialized with human interaction from a very young age. The anti-exportation policies in Australia also ensures that bearded dragons (and indeed all Australian species found abroad) are not forcibly taken or poached from the wild and shipped around the globe via the black market—as is the case with Madagascar&#x27;s rare and sensitive chameleons, geckos and frogs, for example.

However, captive bearded dragons worldwide are threatened by Agamid &quot;adenovirus&quot;, an HIV-like virus that compromises the immune system of the animal, and leads to death from other diseases. Still, the majority of the infections are subclinical. Subclinically-infected animals show no symptoms, but are active carriers of the disease and will thus infect other bearded dragons. As with nearly all reptiles and amphibians, captive bearded dragons are commonly susceptible to metabolic bone disease (MBD) if not provided with adequate calcium in the diet, a condition similar to human osteoporosis. Numerous supplements are available for sale to dust insect prey or plant matter with before each feeding. Additionally, they may be at-risk of constipation or digestive impactions from inadvertently ingesting decorative sand, gravel or even insects that are inappropriately sized for them to consume.

When the female is ready to lay eggs, she will generally stop eating, and spend most of her time trying to dig.

A morph with underdeveloped dorsal scales is popular as a terrarium pet under the name of &quot;leatherback bearded dragon&quot;.

<text>The de Havilland DH100 Vampire is a British jet fighter which was developed and manufactured by the de Havilland Aircraft Company. It was the second jet fighter to be operated by the RAF, after the Gloster Meteor, and the first to be powered by a single jet engine.

Development of the Vampire as an experimental aircraft began in 1941 during the Second World War, to exploit the revolutionary innovation of jet propulsion. From the company&#x27;s design studies, it was decided to use a single-engine, twin-boom aircraft, powered by the Halford H.1 turbojet (later produced as the Goblin). Aside from its propulsion system and twin-boom configuration, it was a relatively conventional aircraft. In May 1944, it was decided to produce the aircraft as an interceptor for the Royal Air Force (RAF). In 1946, the Vampire entered operational service with the RAF, only months after the war had ended.

The Vampire quickly proved to be effective and was adopted as a replacement of wartime piston-engined fighter aircraft. During its early service it accomplished several aviation firsts and achieved various records, such as being the first jet aircraft to cross the Atlantic Ocean. The Vampire remained in front-line RAF service until 1953 when its transfer began to secondary roles such as ground attack and pilot training, for which specialist variants were produced. The RAF retired the Vampire in 1966 when its final role of advanced trainer was filled by the Folland Gnat. The Royal Navy had also adapted the type as the Sea Vampire, a navalised variant suitable for operations from aircraft carriers. It was the service&#x27;s first jet fighter.

The Vampire was exported to many nations and was operated worldwide in numerous theatres and climates. Several countries used the type in combat including the Suez Crisis, the Malayan Emergency and the Rhodesian Bush War. By the end of production, almost 3,300 Vampires had been manufactured, a quarter of these having been manufactured under licence abroad. de Havilland pursued the further development of the type; major derivatives produced include the DH.115, a specialised dual-seat trainer and the more advanced DH.112 Venom, a refined variant for ground attack and night-fighter operations.

==Development==
===Origins===
In January 1941, Sir Henry Tizard made an informal approach to the de Havilland Aircraft Company, suggesting that the company proceed to design a fighter aircraft that would use the revolutionary new jet propulsion technology then under development, along with an appropriate engine to go with it. Although no official specification had been issued, de Havilland proceeded to design a single-engined aircraft that had air-intakes set into the wing roots to feed a centrally mounted engine, which used a centrifugal compressor.

The aero-engine designer Major Frank Halford had been given access to Frank Whittle&#x27;s pioneering work on gas turbines; for the projected jet-powered fighter Halford decided to proceed with the design of a &quot;straight through&quot; centrifugal engine capable of generating 3,000 lb of thrust, which was considered to be high at the time. Halford&#x27;s engine emerged as the Halford H.1. By April 1941, design work on the engine had been completed and a prototype H.1 engine performed its first test run one year later.

The low power output of the early jet engines had meant that only twin-engined aircraft designs were considered to be practical, and as more powerful jet engines were quickly developed, particularly Halford&#x27;s H.1 (later known as the de Havilland Goblin), the practicalities of the single-engined jet fighter were soon realised. de Havilland was approached to produce an airframe for the H.1 as insurance against Germany using jet bombers against Britain; this was considered more important than de Havilland&#x27;s suggestion of a high-speed jet bomber. Its first design, the &quot;DH.99&quot;, was set out in a brochure dated 6 June 1941; it was an all-metal, twin-boom, tricycle undercarriage aircraft armed with four cannon. The use of a twin boom enabled the jet pipe to be kept relatively short, which avoided the power loss that would have occurred if a long pipe was used, as would have been necessary in a conventional fuselage. It also put the tailplane clear of interference from the exhaust. Performance was estimated at at sea level and initial climb of on 2,700 lb thrust. The Ministry of Aircraft Production (MAP) representative expressed doubts regarding the lack of detail, estimations for the aircraft&#x27;s performance and optimistic structure weight; the project received permission to proceed in July 1941.

The DH.99 design was soon modified to incorporate a combined wood-and-metal construction in light of recommendations from the MAP; the design was thus renumbered to &quot;DH.100&quot; by November 1941. The aircraft was considered to be a largely experimental design due to its use of a single engine and some unorthodox features, unlike the Gloster Meteor which had been specified for production early on. In February 1942, the MAP suggested dropping the project for a bomber but de Havilland stated that the twin-boom was, despite Ministry doubts, only an engineering problem to be overcome. On 22 April 1942, the construction of two prototypes (serials &quot;LZ548&quot; and &quot;LZ551&quot;) was authorised by the Ministry while Specification E.6/41 was produced and issued to cover the work. The company proceeded with the detailed design work phase of the DH.100 in early 1942.

Internally designated as the DH.100 and originally named the &quot;Spider Crab&quot;, the aircraft was entirely a de Havilland project, being principally worked upon at the company&#x27;s facility at Hatfield, Hertfordshire. The construction of the aircraft exploited de Havilland&#x27;s extensive experience in the use of moulded plywood for aircraft construction which had previously been used on the Mosquito, a widely produced fast bomber of the war.

The layout of the DH.100 used a single jet engine installed in an egg-shaped fuselage which was primarily composed of plywood for the forward section and aluminium throughout the aft section. It was furnished with conventional mid-mounted straight wings; air brakes were installed on the wings to slow the aircraft, a feature that had also been incorporated in the Meteor. Armament comprised four 20 mm Hispano Mk V cannon underneath the nose; from the onset of the design phase, even when the aircraft was officially intended to serve only as an experimental aircraft, the provision for the cannon armament had been included.
On 20 September 1943, the first DH.100 prototype, serial number &quot;LZ548/G&quot;, conducted its maiden flight from Hatfield Aerodrome; it was piloted by Geoffrey de Havilland Jr., the company&#x27;s chief test pilot and son of the company&#x27;s founder. This flight took place only six months after the Meteor had performed its own maiden flight; the first flight had been delayed due to the need to dispatch the only available engine suitable for flight to America to replace one destroyed in ground engine runs in Lockheed&#x27;s prototype XP-80 jet fighter. Three prototypes, &quot;LZ548/G&quot;, &quot;LZ551/G&quot;, and &quot;MP838/G&quot; were produced in order to support the type&#x27;s development. Testing showed the main problem was with directional instability – the aircraft &quot;snaking&quot; – this was corrected by changes to the tail design.

===Production and further development===
On 13 May 1944, an initial production order for 120 &quot;Vampire Mk I&quot; aircraft was received and quickly increased to 300 aircraft. The production Vampire Mk I did not fly until April 1945. Owing to the wartime pressures upon de Havilland&#x27;s production facilities for existing aircraft types, English Electric Aircraft undertook production of the Vampire at their factories at Preston in Lancashire instead; the company would go on to produce the majority of the aircraft. Only about half a dozen production aircraft had been built by the end of the Second World War, although it did not result in the type becoming a victim of the extensive post-war cuts that were soon implemented, which had terminated the production of many aircraft along with development work upon several more. Eventually, however, 244 production Mk 1 Vampire aircraft were built. 
De Havilland initiated a private venture night fighter, the &quot;DH.113&quot; intended for export, fitting a two-seat cockpit closely based on that of the Mosquito night fighter and a lengthened nose that accommodated an AI Mk X radar. An order to supply the Egyptian Air Force was received but this was blocked by the British government as part of an embargo on supplying arms to Egypt. The RAF took over the order and put them into service as an interim measure between the retirement of the de Havilland Mosquito night fighter and the full introduction of the Meteor night fighter. Removal of the radar from the night fighter and fitting of dual controls resulted in a jet trainer model of the aircraft, the &quot;DH.115 Vampire&quot; which entered British service as the &quot;Vampire T.11&quot;. This trainer variant was built in large numbers for the RAF and for export.

An alternative powerplant to the de Havilland Goblin soon became available in the form of the Rolls-Royce Nene, another turbojet engine capable of generating similar levels of thrust. The name &quot;Vampire II&quot; was given to three experimental Nene-powered Vampires, which were used to assess their performance. One of these was evaluated by the RAF before it was decided that the rival Goblin would be adopted for the RAF Vampires instead; another contributed to development work for the Vampires for the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF).

Although the Nene had a higher thrust than the Goblin, the level flight speed was no greater. To reduce the intake losses caused by having to feed air to the rear face of the impeller of the Nene, two additional intakes were added behind the cockpit; these caused elevator reversal and buffeting, which in turn reduced the Vampire&#x27;s Mach limit. The Vampires of the RAAF were powered by the Nene engine; these were initially outfitted with dorsal intakes, later moved underneath the fuselage. In 1949, Boulton Paul Aircraft redesigned the wing-root intakes and internal ducting based on the installation of the Nene in the prototype Hawker Sea Hawk. The &quot;Mistral&quot;, the French name for their models of the Vampire, also used the Nene engine with Boulton Paul intakes.

The &quot;Vampire III&quot; was the first of several models that sought to address the demands for greater range from the type. Underwing fuel drop-tanks of 100 and 200 gallon capacities were fitted; other modifications included lowering the tailplane and reshaping the vertical surfaces of the tail. The design changes to accommodate the hardpoint-mounted drop-tanks had the benefit of enabling the carriage of various stores and readied the type for ground-attack operations. The wing was considerably modified to improve low altitude performance, the span was reduced by 2 ft with the adoption of square-cut wing tips, the wing skins thickened and the undercarriage modified to withstand the increased weight. In total 3,268 Vampires were built in 15 versions, including two-seat night fighters, trainers and carrier-based &quot;Sea Vampires&quot;. The Vampire was used by 31 air forces. Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and the U.S. were the only major Western powers not to use the aircraft.

===Records and achievements===

On 8 June 1946, the Vampire was introduced to the British public when Fighter Command&#x27;s 247 Squadron was given the honour of leading the flypast over London at the Victory Day Celebrations. The Vampire was a versatile aircraft, setting many aviation firsts and records, being the first RAF fighter with a top speed in excess of . On 3 December 1945, a Sea Vampire piloted by Captain Eric &quot;Winkle&quot; Brown became the first pure-jet aircraft to land on and take off from an aircraft carrier.

Vampires and Sea Vampires were used in trials from 1947 to 1955 to develop recovery and deck-handling procedures and equipment for the operation of aircraft without an undercarriage from flexible rubber decks on aircraft carriers. Deletion of the undercarriage would reduce the aircraft weight and allow extra fuel to be carried. Despite demonstrating that the technique was feasible, with many landings being made with undercarriage retracted on flexible decks both at RAE Farnborough and on board the carrier , the proposal was not taken further. Aviation author Geoffrey Cooper quotes author Marriott stating that the rubber deck system &quot;...would have required extensive facilities both aboard ship and at naval air stations to support it. Any gains in aircraft performance were more than cancelled by the complexity and cost of implementation.&quot;

On 23 March 1948, John Cunningham, flying a modified Vampire Mk I with extended wing tips and powered by the Ghost engine, achieved a new world altitude record of 59,446 ft (18,119 m).

On 14 July 1948, six Vampire F.3s of No. 54 Squadron RAF became the first jet aircraft to fly across the Atlantic Ocean when they arrived in Goose Bay, Labrador. They went via Stornoway in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland, Keflavík in Iceland and Bluie West 1, Greenland. From Goose Bay airfield they went on to Montreal (c. 3,000 mi/4,830 km) to start the RAF&#x27;s annual goodwill tour of Canada and the US, where they gave formation aerobatic displays. At the same time USAF Colonel David C. Schilling led a group of F-80 Shooting Stars flying to Fürstenfeldbruck Air Base in Germany to relieve a unit based there. There were conflicting reports later regarding competition between the RAF and USAF to be the first to fly the Atlantic. One report said the USAF squadron delayed completion of its movement to allow the Vampires to be &quot;the first jets across the Atlantic&quot;. Another said that the Vampire pilots celebrated &quot;winning the race against the rival F-80s.&quot;

===Overview===

The de Havilland Vampire was a jet-powered twin-boom aircraft, typically employed in the fighter and fighter bomber roles. Aviation author Francis K Mason referred to it as being &quot;the last unsophisticated single-engine front line aircraft to serve with Britain&#x27;s Fighter Command&quot;; the Vampire was a relatively straightforward aircraft, employing only manually operated flight controls, no radar, a simple airframe, and, aside from the propulsion system, made use of mostly conventional practices and technologies. The distinctive twin-boom tail configuration of the Vampire was one of the only non-traditional airframe features when compared to its contemporaries.

In comparison to later aircraft, the Vampire had a relatively disorganised cockpit that in some aspects lacked ergonomic measures, such as the fuel gauges being difficult for the pilot to observe without pulling back the control column. A few controls, such as the low-pressure fuel cock, were known for being difficult to move or were otherwise obstructed by other controls. The pilot was provided with a fairly favourable external view, in part aided by the relatively small size of the Vampire.

===Engine===

The Vampire was first powered by a single Halford H1 (produced as the de Havilland Goblin) turbojet engine, initially capable of producing 2,100 lbf (9.3 kN) of thrust, designed by Frank Halford and manufactured by de Havilland Engine Company. This engine was a centrifugal-flow type, a configuration superseded after 1949 by the slimmer axial-flow units. In 1947, Wing Commander Maurice Smith, assistant editor of &quot;Flight&quot; magazine, stated upon piloting his first jet-powered aircraft, a Vampire Mk III: &quot;Piloting a jet aircraft has confirmed one opinion I had formed after flying as a passenger in the Lancastrian jet test beds, that few, if any, having flown in a jet-propelled transport, will wish to revert to the noise, vibration and attendant fatigue of an airscrew-propelled piston-engined aircraft&quot;.

Initially, the relatively high fuel consumption of the Goblin engine had limited the range of early models of the Vampire; this had been a common problem with all early jet aircraft. As a result, later marks featured considerably increased internal fuel capacity. The H.1 Goblin engine, conceived in 1941, remained unchanged in basic form for 13 years; &quot;Flight&quot; said &quot;The Goblin ... can fairly claim to be the world&#x27;s most reliable turbojet&quot;. Over successive models, it gained increased turbine temperature and thrust. Later-built Vampire Mk Is were powered by the Goblin II; the F.3 onwards used the improved Goblin III; by the mid-1950s, the Goblin Mk. 35 export engine, capable of 3,500 lbf, had become available as well.

Certain marks of the Vampire were also operated as flying test-beds for the Rolls-Royce Nene engine, leading to the FB30 and 31 variants that were built in, and operated by, Australia. Due to the low positioning of the engine, a Vampire could not remain on idle for long as the heat from the jet exhaust would melt the tarmac behind the aircraft. If the engine did stall in flight, there was no means to re-light the engine, meaning that a forced landing would be necessary.

===Handling===
According to Mason, the controls of the Vampire were considered to be relatively light and sensitive, employing an effective elevator arrangement that enabled generous acceleration from relatively little control inputs along with highly balanced ailerons that could achieve high rates of roll. In comparison to the elevator and ailerons, the rudder required more vigorous actuation in order to achieve meaningful effect. Pilots converting from piston-engined types would find themselves having to adapt to the slower acceleration of turbojet engines and the corresponding need to moderate rapid throttle movements to avoid instigating a compressor stall.

The Vampire had a relatively good power/weight ratio and was reputedly quite manoeuvrable within the range. Heavy use of the rudder was required at slower speeds, during which pilots had to be cautious during shallow turns to avoid stalls; this would be typically embarrassing rather than dangerous due to the relative ease of recovery, which was principally achieved via positive elevator application. At speeds exceeding Mach 0.71, increasing levels of buffeting were encountered.

The Vampire was compatible with a wide range of aerobatic manoeuvres, Mason comparing its capabilities in this respect to purpose-built sporting aircraft. It has been claimed that the type was the last British jet-powered fighter capable of accurately precipitating conditions such as hammer stalls, stall turns, and wingovers.

Preparing the Vampire for take-off required pilots to perform only six &#x27;vital actions&#x27;: setting the trim to neutral, opening the high and low-pressure fuel cocks, activating the booster pump, setting the flaps, and retracting the air brakes. If laden with external fuel tanks or bombs, pilots would have to retract the undercarriage quite quickly upon leaving the ground, else increasing airflow as the aircraft picked up speed would prevent the undercarriage doors from closing. Landing procedure was similarly free of complexity: disengaging the wheel brakes, lowering the undercarriage, setting the flaps to fully down, and activating the air brakes. Typically, power-on landings were conducted due to the slow response of the engine to throttle changes, and wheel brakes had to be applied carefully to avoid locking the wheels because there was no anti-lock braking system on the fighters. Training variants had the Dunlop Maxaret anti-skid system fitted.

==Operational history==
===United Kingdom===
;Royal Air Force

In 1946, the first Vampire Mk I fighters entered RAF service in the interceptor role. Soon thereafter, considerable numbers of Mk I aircraft began equipping RAF squadrons of the Second Tactical Air Force stationed in Germany, often to replace wartime fighters such as the Hawker Typhoon, Hawker Tempest, and North American Mustang. On 3 July 1948, the Vampire became the first jet aircraft to equip peacetime units of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force, gradually replacing the de Havilland Mosquito in this capacity.

On 23 June 1948, the first production &quot;Vampire Fighter-Bomber Mk 5&quot; (otherwise commonly designated as the &quot;FB.5&quot;), which had been modified from a Vampire F.3, carried out its maiden flight. The FB.5 retained the Goblin III engine of the F.3, but featured armour protection around engine systems, wings clipped back by 1 ft (30 cm), and longer-stroke main landing gear to handle greater takeoff weights and provide clearance for stores/weapons load. An external tank or 500 lb (227 kg) bomb could be carried under each wing, and eight &quot;3-inch&quot; rocket projectiles (&quot;RPs&quot;) could be stacked in pairs on four attachments inboard of the booms. Although the adoption of an ejection seat was being considered at one stage, it was ultimately not fitted.

At its peak, a total of 19 RAF squadrons flew the Vampire FB.5 in Europe, the Middle East and the Far East. By far, the theatre in which the largest number of Vampires were stationed was Germany; this extensive deployment by the RAF has been viewed as one measure of the emerging Cold War climate between West and East Europe, as well as being a reaction to events such as the Korean War and the Berlin Blockade. Vampires were also operated by a number of active and reserve squadrons stationed in the UK.

A number of RAF Vampires were used in active combat within the Far East during the Malayan Emergency, fought in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Specifically, the Vampire FB.5 typically undertook attack missions using a combination of rockets and bombs against insurgent targets often located in remote jungle areas throughout in Malaysia. The Vampire FB.5 became the most numerous single-seat variant of the type, 473 aircraft having been produced.

Experience of Vampire operation in tropical climates led to the development of new models featuring refrigeration equipment for pilot comfort and increasingly powerful models of the Goblin engine, to counter the degradation of performance in hot conditions. The RAF decided to adopt a new model of the Vampire featuring the Goblin 3 engine. Accordingly, in January 1952, the first Vampire FB.9 was introduced to service and were first used by the Far East Air Force, soon replacing its older FB.5 aircraft. The FB.9 was deployed to various parts of the Middle East and Africa, including a brief 1954 deployment against Mau Mau insurgents in Kenya. It was gradually replaced by the de Havilland Venom, a swept wing development of the Vampire.
The Vampire NF.10 served from 1951 to 1954 with three squadrons (23, 25 and 151) but was often flown in daytime as well as night time. After its replacement by the De Havilland Venom, these aircraft underwent conversion to the NF(T).10 standard, after which they were operated by the Central Navigation and Control School at RAF Shawbury. Other aircraft were sold on to the Indian Air Force for further use.

By 1953, the Vampire FB.5 was being increasingly considered to be obsolete, having not kept up with the advancements made on the Meteor 8. The RAF eventually relegated the single-seat Vampire to advanced training roles in the mid-1950s, and the type had been generally phased out of RAF service by the end of the decade.

The final variants of the Vampire was the T (trainer) aircraft. Being first flown from the old Airspeed Ltd factory at Christchurch, Hampshire, on 15 November 1950, production deliveries of the Vampire trainer began in January 1952. Over 600 examples of the T.11 were produced at Hatfield and Chester and by Fairey Aviation at Manchester Airport. By 1965, the Vampire trainer had been mostly withdrawn, its replacement in the advanced training role being the Folland Gnat; only a small number of Vampire T.11s remained in service, typically for the training of foreign students until these too were retired in 1967.

A small number of aircraft that were used in secondary roles carried on in these capacities until the withdrawal of the last operational aircraft from service with No. 3 Civilian Anti-Aircraft Co-operation Unit at Exeter at the end of 1971. A single aircraft continued to be flown and remained in official service with the RAF as part of the &quot;Vintage Pair&quot; display team (along with a Gloster Meteor); however, this aircraft was lost as a result of a crash in 1986.

;Royal Navy

The Admiralty had immediately taken great interest in the Vampire following a series of carrier-landing trials which had been conducted on the aircraft carrier using the modified third prototype of the Vampire in December 1945. At one point, the service had been allegedly considering the adoption of the type as the standard naval fighter to equip the Fleet Air Arm with; however, according to Mason, there had been a prevailing attitude that carrier operations lacked the flexibility to enable combat operations to be conducted with jet aircraft while at sea due to factors such as jet blast and the limited range of the early jets. In 1947, the Royal Navy decided to place an order for a navalised variant of the Vampire FB.5, which had been separately ordered by Air Ministry; the navalised model was quickly given the name &quot;Sea Vampire&quot;.

The Sea Vampire had several key differences from their land-based counterparts. It could be easily distinguished by the presence of a V-shaped arrester hook that retracted to a high-mounted position above the jet pipe. The Sea Vampire was fitted with enlarged air brakes and landing flaps for superior low-speed control during landing approaches, along with stronger construction for the higher stresses involved in carrier landings and catapult launches.

On 15 October 1948, the first Sea Vampire performed its maiden flight. A pair of prototypes were followed by 18 production aircraft which were used to gain experience in carrier jet operations before the arrival of the two-seat Sea Vampire T.22 trainers. The Sea Vampire was initially delivered to 700 Naval Air Squadron and 702 Naval Air Squadron, soon replacing their piston-engine powered de Havilland Sea Hornets.

===Australia===
During 1946, government approval was given for the purchase of an initial 50 Vampire fighter aircraft for the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). The first three machines of this batch were British-built aircraft, an F1, F2 and FB.5, and were given serial numbers &quot;A78-1&quot; to &quot;A78-3&quot;. The second aircraft, the F2 (&quot;A78-2&quot;), was significant in that it was powered by the more powerful Rolls-Royce Nene jet engine, rather than the standard Goblin unit.
All of the 80 F.30 fighters and FB.31 fighter-bomber Vampires that were subsequently built by de Havilland Australia were powered by Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation (CAC) versions of the Nene engine manufactured under licence at their facility in Melbourne. The Nene required a greater intake cross-section than the Goblin, and the initial solution was to mount auxiliary intakes on top of the fuselage behind the canopy. Unfortunately these intakes led to elevator blanking on formation of shock waves, and three aircraft and pilots were lost in unrecoverable dives. All of the Nene-engined aircraft were later modified to move the auxiliary intakes beneath the fuselage, thus entirely avoiding the problem.

In June 1949, the first Vampire F.30 fighter (&quot;A79-1&quot;) made its first flight; it was followed by 56 more F.30 variants before the final 23 aircraft were completed as FB.31s, being fitted with strengthened and clipped wings along with underwing hardpoints. A single F.30 was also converted to the F.32 standard, which was almost identical to the Vampire FB.9. In 1954, all single seat Vampires were retired by the RAAF, but remained in service in Citizen Air Force squadrons until the early 1960s.

The Vampire T.33 was a two-seat training version, powered by the Goblin turbojet and built in Australia. T.34 and T.35 were used by the RAAF and the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). (In RAAF service they were known as Mk33 through to Mk35W.) Many were manufactured or assembled at de Havilland Australia&#x27;s facilities in Sydney. The Mk35W was a Mk35 fitted with spare Mk33 wings following overstress or achievement of fatigue life. Vampire trainer production in Australia amounted to 110 aircraft, and the initial order was filled by 35 T.33s for the RAAF; deliveries being made in 1952 with five T.34s for the RAN delivered in 1954. Additional Vampires were imported from Britain during the mid-to-late 1950s. The trainers remained in service in the RAAF until September 1970, and in the RAN until 1971, when they were replaced by the Macchi MB-326.

===Canada===

A single Vampire F.1 began operating in 1946 on an evaluation basis in Canada at the Winter Experimental Establishment in Edmonton. The Vampire F.3 was selected as one of two types of operational fighters for the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) and was first flown in Canada on 17 January 1948 where it went into service as a Central Flying School training aircraft at RCAF Station Trenton. Operating a total of 86 aircraft, the Vampire F.3 became the first jet fighter to enter RCAF service in any significant numbers.

The Vampire had the function of introducing Canadian fighter pilots not only to jet propulsion, but also to other amenities such as cockpit pressurisation and the tricycle landing gear arrangement. It proved to be a popular aircraft, being easy to fly and often considered a &quot;hot rod.&quot; In Canadian service, the Vampire served in both operational and air reserve units (400, 401, 402, 411, 438 and 442 squadrons). For three years from 2 May 1949 to 22 August 1951 the RCAF aerobatic team &quot;The Blue Devils&quot; flew airshows throughout North America. In November 1956, the type was retired having been replaced in RCAF service by the Canadair Sabre.

===Dominican Republic===
The Dominican Air Force purchased 25 of Sweden&#x27;s Vampires in 1952. Some of these subsequently saw combat in 1959, preventing an attempted amphibious landing by Cuban revolutionaries. They later took part in the 1965 Dominican Civil War.

===Egypt===
The Egyptian Air Force received its first of a planned 66 Vampire FB.52s in December 1950, eventually receiving 50 from de Havilland production. An order for 12 Vampire NF.10 night fighters was cancelled owing to an arms embargo and the aircraft were acquired by the RAF. A factory was built at Helwan to build the Vampire under licence, but political disputes between Egypt and the United Kingdom over the presence of British troops in Egypt led to the project being delayed, before being abandoned following the Egyptian revolution of 1952. Instead, Egypt turned to Italy, and purchased 58 ex-Italian Air Force FB.52As, using Syria as an intermediary, with deliveries from 1955 to 1956.

By 1954, Egypt was operating a fleet of 49 Vampires, which had been acquired from both Italy and Britain, in the fighter-bomber role. In 1955, a further 12 Vampire trainers were ordered, deliveries of which started in July that year. On 1 September 1955, in a response to an Israeli commando raid on an Egyptian-held fort at Khan Yunis, four Egyptian Vampires crossed into Israeli airspace, but were intercepted by Israeli Meteor jets, with two Vampires being shot down. By 1956, Egyptian Vampires were in the process of being replaced in the front-line fighter role by the much more capable Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 and MiG-17 swept-wing fighters, and several Vampires were given to Saudi Arabia and Jordan. During the Suez Crisis, the Egyptians mainly used their Vampires for ground-attack missions against the advancing Israeli forces, particularly at the Mitla Pass, and are recorded as having lost a total of four Vampires in combat with Israeli jet aircraft. Several more were destroyed on the ground by Anglo-French air raids.

===Finland===

The Finnish Air Force received six FB.52 Vampires in 1953. The model was nicknamed &quot;Vamppi&quot; in Finnish service. An additional nine twin-seat T.55s were purchased in 1955. The aircraft were assigned to 2nd Wing at Pori, but were transferred to 1st Wing at Tikkakoski at the end of the 1950s. The last Finnish Vampire was decommissioned in 1965.

===France===

As part of a larger effort to build up the post-war French Air Force, a number of Goblin-powered Vampire FB.5s were delivered to France from 1949 onwards. This variant of the Vampire was subsequently manufactured under licence by Sud-Est at Marignane, the first 67 aircraft were assembled from British-produced components and were standard aircraft for the most part; these were followed by a further 183 Vampires, which incorporated a greater proportion of French-produced elements. The French developed the FB.53 model, a Nene-powered variant, which was named in French service as the &quot;Mistral&quot; after the wind of the same name. The Nene engine was alleged to be responsible for the Mistral having greater rate of climb and a higher top speed than the standard Vampire.

A total of 250 Mistrals were built, equipped with Hispano-Suiza built engines, French ejector seats and enlarged wing root ducts. French orders for the type were greatly expanded during the early 1950s as a reaction to the outbreak of the Korean War. The production line was converted for the license-production of the improved de Havilland Sea Venom by the end of 1952 as well. On 2 April 1951, the first Mistral made its maiden flight.

===India===

On 6 November 1948, the Indian Air Force (IAF) took delivery of its first three de Havilland Vampires at Palam Air Force Station, Delhi; these were procured under a large-scale expansion and modernisation programme. No. 7 Squadron IAF received its first Vampires in January 1949. No. 17 Squadron IAF also operated the type. No. 37 Squadron IAF flew a number of Vampire NF54 night reconnaissance missions over Goa during the 1961 Annexation of Goa from Portuguese rule, sometimes coming under anti-aircraft fire.

On 1 September 1965, during the Indo-Pakistani War, No. 45 Squadron IAF responded to a request for strikes against a counter-attack by the Pakistani Army (Operation Grand Slam), and twelve Vampire Mk 52 fighter-bombers were successful in slowing the Pakistani advance. However, the Vampires encountered two Pakistan Air Force (PAF) F-86 Sabres, armed with air-to-air missiles; in the ensuing dogfight, the outdated Vampires were outclassed. One was shot down by ground fire and another three were shot down by Sabres. The Vampires were withdrawn from front line service after these losses.

===Ireland===
The Vampire entered service with the Irish Air Corps in 1955, and was the first ever jet powered fighter aircraft in Ireland. A total of six Vampire T.55s were acquired and served under No.1 Fighter Squadron, stationed at Casement Air Base. The Vampires replaced the Supermarine Spitfire and Seafire as Ireland&#x27;s main combat aircraft. The Vampire brought the jet age to Ireland and introduced heavier armaments through the Vampire&#x27;s cannons, as well as new technology such as ejection seats. The Vampires served until 1975 and were replaced with six Fouga CM.170 Magisters.

===Italy===

During the late 1940s, Italy became interested in procuring the Vampire as part of its re-equipment programme following the Second World War. The Meteor had also been considered, but was discarded on grounds of cost. At the invitation of Italian Air Force, a series of aerial demonstrations at Italian air shows were performed by British Vampires during September 1949. On 24 October 1949, an agreement was struck with Fiat to license manufacture the type at its plant in Turin; additional work type would also be undertaken by Macchi at Varese; the agreement included five Vampire FB.5, 51 Vampire FB.52, four Vampire NF.10 and ten Vampire NF.54 to be built in the United Kingdom; a total of 150 Vampire FB.52s were also built in Italy under licence.

On 11 March 1950, the first five Vampire FB.5s arrived at the Jet Flight Training School at Foggia. British-built Vampires were delivered in advance of their Italian counterparts as the latter needed more time to establish their production line. During the early 1950s, Italian Vampires were flown by the Cavallino Rampante, the Italian Air Force&#x27;s first post-war aerial display team. Following Britain&#x27;s embargo on the sale of military aircraft to Egypt, 58 ex-Italian Air Force Vampires were refurbished and transferred to Egypt during early 1956; Macchi built 45 additional Vampires to replace these in Italian service.

===Norway===

The Royal Norwegian Air Force (RNoAF) purchased a total of 20 Vampires F.3s, 36 FB.52s and six T.55 trainers. The Vampire was in Norwegian use as a fighter from 1948 to 1957, equipping a three-squadron Vampire wing stationed at Gardermoen. In 1957, the type was withdrawn when the RNoAF decided to re-equip with the Republic F-84G Thunderjet. In 1955, the Vampire trainers were replaced by the Lockheed T-33, these aircraft were returned to the United Kingdom and saw later use by the Royal Air Force.

===Rhodesia===

The Rhodesian Air Force acquired 16 Vampire FB.9 fighters and a further 16 Vampire T.11 trainers in the early 1950s, its first jet aircraft, equipping two squadrons. These were regularly deployed to Aden between 1957 and 1961, supporting British counter-insurgency operations. 21 more two-seaters and 13 single-seaters were supplied by South Africa in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Rhodesia operated Vampires until the end of the bush war in 1979. In 1977, six were pressed into service for Operation Dingo. They were eventually replaced by the BAE Hawk 60 in the early 1980s. After 30 years service, they were the last Vampires used on operations anywhere.

=== South Africa ===
A total of 50 DH.100 and a total of 27 DH.115 Vampire aircraft were delivered to the South African Air Force.

=== Sweden ===

In 1946, the Swedish Air Force purchased its first batch of 70 FB 1 Vampires, having looked for a jet-powered fighter to replace the outdated J 22 and SAAB 21 aircraft of its fighter force. In Swedish service, the Vampire received the designation &quot;J 28A&quot;, with the first aircraft assigned to the Bråvalla Wing (F 13). The type provided such good service that the Vampire was soon selected to serve as the backbone of the fighter force. In 1949, a total of 310 of the more modern FB.50s, based on the Vampire FB.5, were procured and designated &quot;J 28B&quot;. The last of these was delivered in 1952, after which all piston-engined fighters were decommissioned. In addition, a total of 57 two-seater DH.115 Vampires, designated &quot;J 28C&quot;, were also acquired for training purposes.

In 1956, the Swedish Vampires were retired from the fighter role, replaced in service with the &quot;J 29&quot; (SAAB Tunnan) and &quot;J 34&quot; (Hawker Hunter). In 1968, the final Vampire trainer was retired, all having been replaced by the SK 60 (SAAB 105).

===Switzerland===

In 1946, the Swiss Air Force purchased an initial four Vampire F.1s, one of which crashed on 2 August 1946 while the other three remained in service until 1961. In 1949, the Swiss government signed a contract to locally manufacture the Vampire FB.6 in Switzerland using British-built Goblin engines; accordingly, a batch of 85 Vampire FB.6s were produced. In 1952, the first production Vampire NF.10 was delivered to Switzerland for evaluation purposes.

In 1949, the first batch of 75 Vampire Mk.6 (J-1005 to J-1079) was purchased. Most of these were phased out of service in 1968/1969, the last aircraft being withdrawn in 1973. A second batch of 100 Vampire Mk.6 (J-1101 to J-1200) were built under licence by a consortium of Swiss aviation companies, including Eidgenössische Flugzeugwerke Emmen, Pilatus Aircraft and Flug- und Fahrzeugwerke Altenrhein. Aircraft from this batch were in use from 1951 to 1974, of which some were used for pilot training and as target aircraft until 1990. A further three DH-100 Mk.6 (serials J-1080 to J-1082) were subsequently built from remaining spare parts. A force of 39 DH.115 Mk 55 Vampire two-seat trainers (U-1201 to U-1239) were also in service from 1953 to 1990. During the late 1950s, Switzerland started procuring Hawker Hunters to replace their Vampire fleet in the fighter role.

<doc id="349487" wikidata="Q7600477" url="?curid=349487" title="Staples thesis">
<text>In economic development, the staples thesis is a theory of export-led growth. The theory &quot;has its origins in research into Canadian social, political, and economic history carried out in Canadian universities...by members of what were then known as departments of political economy.&quot; From these groups of researchers, &quot;the two most prominent scholars following this approach were Harold Innis and W.A. Mackintosh.&quot;

==Thesis==
The thesis explains Canadian economic development as a lateral, east-west conception of trade. Innis argued that Canada developed as it did because of the nature of its staple commodities: raw materials, such as fish, fur, lumber, agricultural products and minerals, that were exported to Britain and the West Indies. This trading link cemented Canada&#x27;s cultural links to Britain. The search for and exploitation of these staples led to the creation of institutions that defined the political culture of the nation and its regions.

Innis argues that different staples led to the emergence of regional economies (and societies) within Canada. For instance, the staple commodity in Atlantic Canada was cod. This industry was very decentralized, but also very co-operative. In western Canada the central staple was wheat. Wheat farming was a very independent venture, which led to a history of distrust of government and corporations in that part of the country. (Also important, however, were the shocks caused by volatility in the market for wheat and by the weather itself on the growing season.) In Central Canada, the main staple was fur, and the fur trade dominated the economy for many years. This fur trade was controlled by large firms, such as the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and thus produced the much more centralized, business-oriented society that today characterizes Montreal and Toronto.

Innis depicted the relationship between regions of Canada as one of &quot;heartland&quot; to &quot;hinterland&quot;: The periphery, or hinterland, is dominated by the core, or heartland. Because the heartland was dependent upon the search for and accumulation of staples (which were located in the hinterland) to perpetuate the economy, it sought to gain economic and political power by exploiting the hinterland.

To Innis, it was the fur trade that created the geographical boundaries of Canada. The early links between the Canadian interior and eastern ports led to Canadian unity and its distinctiveness from the United States. However, the importance of fur as a staple product also resulted in the northern half of the continent remaining dependent on Britain for trade and thus essentially British for so much of its history.

==Influence and criticism==
Mel Watkins revived the theory during the 1960s and 1970s through his work on resource capitalism and Canadian political economy. While the staples thesis originally described the evolution of the Canadian state, it has since been used to study the economies of many nations that are dependent upon resource extraction and primary industries.

The staples thesis states that export of raw materials can sustain economic growth, while its critics argue that reliance on commodity export should not delay the development of basic manufacturing and provision of services. Among his strongest critics was Robin Neill who advocated a thesis explaining the economic development of Canada as an expression of variegated regions (population density, cultural politics, geographic characteristics) and of their particular north-south relationships with the United States.

Historians continue to use elements of the Innis core-periphery model, applying it for example to British Columbia. That province&#x27;s economic structure exemplifies the core-periphery structure of intra-regional relationships in the following manner: the core is metropolitan Vancouver, with its concentration of corporate management and transportation functions and manufacturing growth; Vancouver dominates an underdeveloped periphery that depends on production and export of staple commodities.

<doc id="349496" wikidata="Q213447" url="?curid=349496" title="John Millington Synge">
<text>Edmund John Millington Synge (; 16 April 1871 – 24 March 1909) was an Irish playwright, poet, writer, collector of folklore, and a key figure in the Irish Literary Revival. His best-known play &quot;The Playboy of the Western World&quot; was poorly received, due to its bleak ending, depiction of Irish peasants, and idealisation of patricide, leading to hostile audience reactions and riots in Dublin during its opening run at the Abbey Theatre, which he had co-founded with W. B. Yeats and Lady Gregory. His other major works include &quot;In the Shadow of the Glen&quot; (1903), &quot;Riders to the Sea&quot; (1904), &quot;The Well of the Saints&quot; (1905), and &quot;The Tinker&#x27;s Wedding&quot; (1909).

Synge came from a wealthy Anglo-Irish background who mainly wrote about working-class Catholics in rural Ireland, and what he saw as the essential paganism of their worldview. Owing to his ill health, he was schooled at home. His early interest was in music, leading to a scholarship and degree at Trinity College Dublin, and he went to Germany in 1893 to study music. In 1894 he moved to Paris where he took up poetry and literary criticism and met Yeats, and returned to Ireland.

Synge suffered from Hodgkin&#x27;s disease. He died aged 37 from Hodgkin&#x27;s-related cancer while writing what became &quot;Deirdre of the Sorrows&quot;, considered by some as his masterpiece, though unfinished during his lifetime. His relatively few works are widely regarded as of high cultural significance.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Synge was born on 16 April 1871, in Newtown Villas, Rathfarnham, County Dublin, the youngest of eight children of upper-middle-class Protestant parents. His father John Hatch Synge was a barrister and came from a family of landed gentry in Glanmore Castle, County Wicklow. Synge&#x27;s paternal grandfather, also named John Synge, was an evangelical Christian involved in the movement that became the Plymouth Brethren, and his maternal grandfather, Robert Traill, was a Church of Ireland rector in Schull, County Cork, who died in 1847 during the Great Irish Famine. He was a descendant of Edward Synge, Archbishop of Tuam, and Edward&#x27;s son Nicholas, the Bishop of Killaloe. His nephews included mathematician John Lighton Synge and optical microscopy pioneer Edward Hutchinson Synge.

Synge&#x27;s father died from smallpox at the age of 49 and was buried on his son&#x27;s first birthday. His mother moved the family to the house next door to her mother&#x27;s house in Rathgar, County Dublin. Although often ill, Synge had a happy childhood. He developed an interest in bird-watching along the banks of the River Dodder, and during family holidays at the seaside resort of Greystones, County Wicklow, and the family estate at Glanmore.

He was home-educated at schools in Dublin and Bray, and studied piano, flute, violin, music theory and counterpoint at the Royal Irish Academy of Music. He travelled to the continent to study music but later decided to focus on literature. He was a talented student and won a scholarship in counterpoint in 1891. The family moved to the suburb of Kingstown (now Dún Laoghaire) in 1888, and Synge entered Trinity College, Dublin, the following year. He graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1892, having studied Irish and Hebrew, as well as continuing his music studies and playing with the Academy Orchestra in the Antient Concert Rooms. Between November 1889 and 1894 he took private music lessons with Robert Prescott Stewart.

Synge later developed an interest in Irish antiquities and the Aran Islands, and became a member of the Irish League for a year. He left the League because, as he told Maud Gonne, &quot;my theory of regeneration for Ireland differs from yours ... I wish to work on my own for the cause of Ireland, and I shall never be able to do so if I get mixed up with a revolutionary and semi-military movement.&quot; In 1893 he published his first known work, a poem influenced by Wordsworth, in &quot;Kottabos: A College Miscellany&quot;.

===Early work===
After graduating, Synge moved to Germany to study music. He stayed in Coblenz during 1893 before moving to Würzburg in January 1894. Because of his shyness about performing in public, coupled with his doubt about his own ability, he abandoned music to pursue his literary interests. He returned to Ireland in June 1894 before moving to Paris in January 1895 to study literature and languages at the Sorbonne. He met Cherrie Matheson during summer breaks with his family in Dublin. He proposed to her in 1895 and again the next year, but she turned him down on both occasions because of their differing views on religion. The rejections greatly affected him and reinforced his determination to move abroad.

In 1896, he visited Italy to study the language before returning to Paris. He planned on a career in writing about French authors. That year he met W. B. Yeats who encouraged him to spend time on the Aran Islands, after which he returned to Dublin. In 1899 he joined Yeats, Augusta, Lady Gregory and George William Russell to form the Irish National Theatre Society, which later established the Abbey Theatre. He wrote some pieces of literary criticism for Gonne&#x27;s &quot;Irlande Libre&quot; and other journals, as well as unpublished poems and prose in a decadent fin de siècle style. (These writings were eventually gathered in the 1960s for his &quot;Collected Works&quot;.) He also attended lectures at the Sorbonne by the noted Celtic scholar Henri d&#x27;Arbois de Jubainville.

===Aran Islands and first plays===

In 1897, Synge suffered his first attack of Hodgkin&#x27;s, after which an enlarged gland was removed from his neck. He visited Lady Gregory&#x27;s home, at Coole Park near Gort, County Galway, where he met Yeats again and also Edward Martyn. He spent the following five summers there, collecting stories and folklore, perfecting his Irish, but living in Paris for most of the rest of each year. He also visited Brittany regularly. During this period he wrote his first play, &quot;When the Moon Has Set&quot; which he sent to Lady Gregory for the Irish Literary Theatre in 1900, but she rejected it. The play was not published until it appeared in his &quot;Collected Works&quot;.

Synge&#x27;s first account of life on the Aran Islands was published in the &quot;New Ireland Review&quot; in 1898 and his book, &quot;&quot;, completed in 1901 and published in 1907 with illustrations by Jack Butler Yeats. Synge considered the book &quot;my first serious piece of work&quot;. Lady Gregory read the manuscript and advised Synge to remove any direct naming of places and to add more folk stories, but he declined to do either because he wanted to create something more realistic. The book conveys Synge&#x27;s belief that beneath the Catholicism of the islanders, it was possible to detect a substratum of the pagan beliefs of their ancestors. His experiences in the Arans formed the basis for the plays about Irish rural life that Synge went on to write.

Synge left Paris for London in 1903. He had written two one-act plays, &quot;Riders to the Sea&quot; and &quot;The Shadow of the Glen&quot;, the previous year. These met with Lady Gregory&#x27;s approval and &quot;The Shadow of the Glen&quot; was performed at the Molesworth Hall in October 1903. &quot;Riders to the Sea&quot; was staged at the same venue in February the following year. &quot;The Shadow of the Glen&quot;, under the title &quot;In the Shadow of the Glen&quot;, formed part of the bill for the opening run of the Abbey Theatre from 27 December 1904 to 3 January 1905. Both plays were based on stories that Synge had collected in the Arans, and Synge relied on props from the Arana to help set the stage for each of them. He also relied on Hiberno-English, the English dialect of Ireland, to reinforce its usefulness as a literary language, partly because he believed that the Irish language could not survive.
&quot;The Shadow of the Glen&quot; is based on a story about an unfaithful wife, and was criticised by the Irish nationalist leader Arthur Griffith as &quot;a slur on Irish womanhood&quot;. Years later Synge wrote: &quot;When I was writing &quot;The Shadow of the Glen&quot; some years ago I got more aid than any learning could have given me from a chink in the floor of the old Wicklow house where I was staying, that let me hear what was being said by the servant girls in the kitchen.&quot; Griffith&#x27;s criticism encouraged more attacks alleging that Synge described Irish women in an unfair manner. &quot;Riders to the Sea&quot; was also attacked by nationalists, this time including Patrick Pearse, who decried it because of the author&#x27;s attitude to God and religion. Pearse, Griffith and other conservative-minded Catholics claimed Synge had done a disservice to Irish nationalism by not idealising his characters, but later critics have stated he idealised the Irish peasantry too much. A third one-act play, &quot;The Tinker&#x27;s Wedding&quot;, was drafted around this time, but Synge initially made no attempt to have it performed, largely because of a scene in which a priest is tied up in a sack, which, as he wrote to the publisher Elkin Mathews in 1905, would probably upset &quot;a good many of our Dublin friends&quot;.

When the Abbey Theatre was established, Synge was appointed literary adviser and became one of the directors, along with Yeats and Lady Gregory. He differed from Yeats and Lady Gregory on what he believed the Irish theatre should be, as he wrote to Stephen MacKenna:I do not believe in the possibility of &quot;a purely fantastic, unmodern, ideal, breezy, spring-dayish, Cuchulainoid National Theatre&quot; ... no drama can grow out of anything other than the fundamental realities of life, which are never fantastic, are neither modern nor unmodern and, as I see them, rarely spring-dayish, or breezy or Cuchulanoid.

Synge&#x27;s next play, &quot;The Well of the Saints&quot;, was staged at the Abbey in 1905, again to nationalist disapproval, and then in 1906 at the Deutsches Theater in Berlin. The critic Joseph Holloway asserted that the play combined &quot;lyric and dirt&quot;.

===&quot;Playboy&quot; riots and after===
Synge&#x27;s widely regarded masterpiece, &quot;The Playboy of the Western World&quot;, was first performed on 26 January 1907, at the Abbey Theatre. A comedy about apparent patricide, it attracted a hostile reaction from sections of the Irish public. The &quot;Freeman&#x27;s Journal&quot; described it as &quot;an unmitigated, protracted libel upon Irish peasant men, and worse still upon Irish girlhood&quot;. Arthur Griffith, who believed that the Abbey Theatre was insufficiently politically committed, described the play as &quot;a vile and inhuman story told in the foulest language we have ever listened to from a public platform&quot;, and perceived a slight on the virtue of Irish womanhood in the line &quot;... a drift of chosen females, standing in their shifts ...&quot; At the time, a shift was known as a symbol representing Kitty O&#x27;Shea and her adulterous relationship with Charles Stuart Parnell.

A section of the audience at the opening rioted, causing the third act to be acted out in dumbshow. The disturbances continued for a week, interrupting the following performances. Years later, after a similar disturbance at the opening of &quot;The Plough and the Stars&quot; by Seán O&#x27;Casey, Yeats said the audience had &quot;disgraced yourselves again. Is this to be an ever-recurring celebration of the arrival of Irish genius? Synge first and then O&#x27;Casey?&quot;

The writing of &quot;The Tinker&#x27;s Wedding&quot; began at the same time as &quot;Riders to the Sea&quot; and &quot;In the Shadow of the Glen&quot;. It took Synge five years to complete and was not finished until 1907. &quot;Riders&quot; was performed in the Racquet Court theatre in Galway on 4–8 January 1907, but not performed again until 1909, and then only in London. The first critic to respond to the play was Daniel Corkery, who said, &quot;One is sorry Synge ever wrote so poor a thing, and one fails to understand why it ever should have been staged anywhere&quot;.

==Death==
Synge died from Hodgkin lymphoma at the Elpis Nursing Home in Dublin on 24 March 1909, aged 37, and was buried in Mount Jerome Cemetery, Harold&#x27;s Cross, Dublin. A collected volume, &quot;Poems and Translations&quot;, with a preface by Yeats, was published by the Cuala Press on 8 April 1909. Yeats and actress and one-time fiancée Molly Allgood (Maire O&#x27;Neill) completed Synge&#x27;s unfinished final play, &quot;Deirdre of the Sorrows&quot;, and it was presented by the Abbey players on Thursday 13 January 1910, with Allgood as Deirdre.

==Personality==
John Masefield, who knew Synge, wrote that he &quot;gave one from the first the impression of a strange personality&quot;. Masefield said that Synge&#x27;s view of life originated in his poor health. In particular, Masefield said &quot;His relish of the savagery made me feel that he was a dying man clutching at life, and clutching most wildly at violent life, as the sick man does&quot;.

Yeats described Synge as timid and shy, who &quot;never spoke an unkind word&quot; yet his art could &quot;fill the streets with rioters&quot;. Richard Ellmann, the biographer of Yeats and James Joyce, stated that Synge &quot;built a fantastic drama out of Irish life.

Yeats described Synge in the poem &quot;In Memory of Major Robert Gregory&quot;:
:...And that enquiring man John Synge comes next,
:That dying chose the living world for text
:And never could have rested in the tomb
:But that, long travelling, he had come
:Towards nightfall upon certain set apart
:In a most desolate stony place,
:Towards nightfall upon a race
:Passionate and simple like his heart.

Synge was a political radical, immersed in the socialist literature of William Morris, and in his own words &quot;wanted to change things root and branch&quot;. Much to the consternation of his mother, he went to Paris in 1896 to become more involved in radical politics, and his interest in the topic lasted until his dying days when he sought to engage his nurses on the topic of feminism.

==Legacy==

Yeats said that Synge was &quot;the greatest dramatic genius of Ireland&quot;. While Yeats and Lady Gregory were &quot;the centrepieces of the Irish theatrical renaissance, it was Synge ... who gave the movement its national quality ...&quot; His plays helped set the dominant style at the Abbey Theatre until the 1940s. The stylised realism of his writing was reflected in the training given at the theatre&#x27;s school of acting, and plays of peasant life were the main staple of the repertoire until the end of the 1950s. Sean O&#x27;Casey, the next major dramatist to write for the Abbey, knew Synge&#x27;s work well and attempted to do for the Dublin working classes what Synge had done for the rural poor. Brendan Behan, Brinsley MacNamara, and Lennox Robinson were all indebted to Synge.

The Irish literary critic Vivian Mercier was among the first to recognise Samuel Beckett&#x27;s debt to Synge. Beckett was a regular member of the audience at the Abbey in his youth and particularly admired the plays of Yeats, Synge and O&#x27;Casey. Mercier points out parallels between Synge&#x27;s casts of tramps, beggars and peasants and many of the figures in Beckett&#x27;s novels and dramatic works.

Synge&#x27;s cottage in the Aran Islands has been restored as a tourist attraction. An annual Synge Summer School has been held every summer since 1991 in the village of Rathdrum, County Wicklow. Synge is the subject of Mac Dara Ó Curraidhín&#x27;s 1999 documentary film, &quot;Synge agus an Domhan Thiar&quot; (&quot;Synge and the Western World&quot;). Joseph O&#x27;Connor wrote a novel, &quot;Ghost Light&quot; (2010), loosely based on Synge&#x27;s relationship with Molly Allgood.

Synge&#x27;s correspondence with his cousin, composer Mary Helena Synge, is archived at Trinity College Dublin.

<text>James Nayler (or Naylor; 1618–1660) was an English Quaker leader. He was among the members of the Valiant Sixty, a group of early Quaker preachers and missionaries. In 1656, Nayler achieved national notoriety when he re-enacted Christ&#x27;s Palm Sunday entry into Jerusalem by entering Bristol on a horse. He was imprisoned and charged with blasphemy.

==Early life==
Nayler was born in the town of Ardsley in Yorkshire. In 1642 he joined the Parliamentarian army, and served as quartermaster under John Lambert until 1650.

==Religious experience==
After experiencing what he took to be the voice of God calling him from work in his fields, Nayler gave up his possessions and began seeking a spiritual direction, which he found in Quakerism after meeting the leader of the movement, George Fox, in 1652. Nayler became the most prominent of the travelling Quaker evangelists known as the Valiant Sixty. He drew many converts and was considered a skilled theological debater.

==Rift with Fox==
===Fox&#x27;s concerns over the acts of Nayler&#x27;s followers===
Beginning in 1656, Fox expressed concerns to Nayler that both Nayler&#x27;s ministry and that of his associate Martha Simmonds were becoming over-enthusiastic and erratic. Fox&#x27;s concerns apparently centred specifically on Nayler allowing a group of his followers to see in Nayler himself in some sense a great prophet or even a messiah figure. On 21 and 22 September 1656, Fox visited Nayler twice in prison at Exeter and admonished him. Over the visits, Nayler continued to reject Fox&#x27;s words. Prominent Quaker author Rufus M. Jones provides a description of the strained encounter:

[Fox] showed [Nayler] how dangerous was the path of pride and how awful it was to turn light into darkness, but the frank, well-meant words of warning fell on deaf ears. Nayler tried to make a show of love and would have kissed Fox, but the latter would receive no sham kisses from one whose spirit was plainly wrong. &quot;James,&quot; he said, &quot;it will be harder for thee to get down thy rude company [of followers] than it was for thee to set them up.&quot;

===Bristol Palm Sunday Re-enactment and sentencing for blasphemy===
In October 1656, Nayler and his friends, including Simmonds, staged a demonstration that proved disastrous: Nayler re-enacted the Palm Sunday arrival of Christ in Jerusalem.

Following Nayler&#x27;s Palm Sunday Re-enactment, Nayler and some of his followers were apprehended and subsequently examined before Parliament. It was found that Nayler&#x27;s followers had referred to him by such titles as &quot;Lord&quot;, &quot;Prince of Peace&quot;, etc., apparently believing that Nayler was in some manner representing the return of Jesus Christ. His follower Hannah Stranger refused to say if she called him &quot;Jesus&quot;. On 16 December 1656 he was convicted of blasphemy in a highly publicised trial before the Second Protectorate Parliament. Narrowly escaping execution, he was sentenced to be put in the pillory and on there to have a red-hot iron bored through his tongue, and also to be branded with the letter B for Blasphemer on his forehead, and other public humiliations. Subsequently he was imprisoned for two years of hard labour.

The Nayler case was part of a broader political attack against the Quakers. Initially, it was discussed under the Blasphemy Ordinance of 1648 with the hope of imposing an authoritative Presbyterian religious settlement on the Commonwealth – the Presbyterians had also attempted to use the Ordinance against John Biddle in the previous parliament. Ultimately the prosecution did not rely on any statute. Many of the speeches in the debates about Nayler centred on Biblical tradition on heresy (including calling for the death penalty) and generally urged MPs to quash vice and heresy. After the verdict, Cromwell rejected representations on behalf of Nayler, but at the same time wanted to make sure the case did not provide a precedent for action against the people of God.

To modern eyes, Nayler&#x27;s Palm Sunday Re-enactment might not seem particularly outrageous, especially when compared with other acts of some of the other early Quaker activists, who would occasionally disrupt church services, or sometimes go out disrobed in public, being &quot;naked as a sign&quot;, and as a supposed symbol of spiritual innocence. At the time, Quakers were already being pressed to denounce the doctrine of the Inner Light for its implication of equality with Christ, and Nayler&#x27;s ambiguous symbolism was seen as playing with fire. The Society&#x27;s subsequent move, mostly driven by Fox, toward a somewhat more organised structure, with Meetings given the ability to disavow a member, seemed to have been moved by a desire to avoid similar problems.

===Aftermath===
George Fox was horrified by the Bristol event, recounting in his &quot;Journal&quot; that &quot;James ran out into imaginations, and a company with him; and they raised up a great darkness in the nation,&quot; despite Nayler&#x27;s belief that his actions were consistent with Quaker theology, and despite Fox&#x27;s own having occasionally acted in certain ways as if he himself might have been somehow similar to the Biblical prophets. Yet Fox and the movement in general denounced Nayler publicly, though this did not stop anti-Quakers from using the incident to paint Quakers as heretics or equate them with Ranters.

===Reconciliation with Fox===
Nayler left prison in 1659 a physically ruined man. He soon went to pay a visit to George Fox, before whom he then knelt and asked for forgiveness, repenting of his earlier actions. Afterwards he was formally, if still reluctantly, forgiven by Fox.

==Final year, writings and death==
Having been accepted again by Fox, Nayler joined other Quaker critics of the Cromwellian regime, condemning the nation&#x27;s rulers. In October 1660, while travelling to rejoin his family in Yorkshire, he was robbed and left near death in a field, then brought to the home of a Quaker doctor in Kings Ripton, Huntingdonshire. A day later and two hours before he died on 21 October, aged 42, he made a moving statement which many Quakers since have come to value:
James Nayler was buried on 21 October 1660 in Thomas Parnell&#x27;s burial ground at Kings Ripton. According to the village website, &quot;There is also a Quaker&#x27;s Burial ground to the rear of &#x27;Quakers Rest&#x27; on Ramsey Road.&quot;

==Publications==
*&quot;The Works of James Nayler,&quot; by Quaker Heritage Press, a complete edition of Nayler&#x27;s works including letters previously available in manuscripts. The editor modernizing the spelling, punctuation, etc. noting significant textual variants without changing the original wording. The set is available in book form or in an unabridged on-line edition. (2009).
*&quot;There Is A Spirit: The Nayler Sonnets&quot; is a collection, first published in 1945, of 26 poems by Kenneth Boulding, each inspired by a four- to sixteen-word portion of Nayler&#x27;s dying statement (and also includes the intact statement). Boulding gave permission for the publication of his &quot;The Nayler Sonnets&quot; to Irene Pickard who printed them in 1944 in the periodical she was editing from New York City, &quot; &quot;&quot;Inward Light&quot;. The &quot;There is a spirit ...&quot; statement forms section 19.12 of Britain Yearly Meeting&#x27;s anthology &quot;Quaker Faith and Practice&quot;. The Swarthmore Lecture has the title &quot;Ground and Spring&quot;, taken from Nayler&#x27;s &quot;There is a spirit ...&quot; statement. (2007).
*&quot;The Sorrows of the Quaker Jesus: James Nayler and the Puritan Crackdown on the Free Spirit.&quot; (1996).
*&quot;Refutation of some of the more Modern Misrepresentations of the Society of Friends commonly called Quakers, with a Life of James Nayler,&quot; by Joseph Gurney Bevan. (1800).
*&quot;Memoir of the Life, Ministry, Trial, and Sufferings of James Nayler.&quot; (1719).
*&quot;Tracts of Nayler&quot; entitled &quot;A Collection of Sundry Books, Epistles, and Papers Written by James Nayler, Some of Which Were Never Before Printed: with an Impartial Relation of the Most Remarkable Transactions Relating to His Life&quot; (1716) edited by his friend (and important early Quaker) George Whitehead, though Whitehead omitted Nayler&#x27;s more controversial works and freely edited and changed the text. Note that this volume appeared after the death of George Fox, who opposed the re-issuing of ANY of Nayler&#x27;s writings. Fox, however, did appropriate and issue with only cosmetic changes as &quot;Epistle 47&quot; a 1653 letter written by Nayler as his own in the 1698 edition of Fox&#x27;s epistles.
*&quot;A Relation of the Life, Conversion, Examination, Confession, and Sentence of James Nayler.&quot; (1657).

<text>An environment variable is a user-definable value that can affect the way running processes will behave on a computer. Environment variables are part of the environment in which a process runs. For example, a running process can query the value of the TEMP environment variable to discover a suitable location to store temporary files, or the HOME or USERPROFILE variable to find the directory structure owned by the user running the process.

They were introduced in their modern form in 1979 with Version 7 Unix, so are included in all Unix operating system flavors and variants from that point onward including Linux and macOS. From PC DOS 2.0 in 1982, all succeeding Microsoft operating systems, including Microsoft Windows, and OS/2 also have included them as a feature, although with somewhat different syntax, usage and standard variable names.

== Design ==
In all Unix and Unix-like systems, as well as on Windows, each process has its own separate set of environment variables. By default, when a process is created, it inherits a duplicate run-time environment of its parent process, except for explicit changes made by the parent when it creates the child. At the API level, these changes must be done between running codice_1 and codice_2. Alternatively, from command shells such as bash, a user can change environment variables for a particular command invocation by indirectly invoking it via codice_3 or using the codice_4 notation. A running program can access the values of environment variables for configuration purposes.

Shell scripts and batch files use environment variables to communicate data and preferences to child processes. They can also be used to store temporary values for reference later in a shell script. However, in Unix, non-exported variables are preferred for this as they do not leak outside the process.

In Unix, an environment variable that is changed in a script or compiled program will only affect that process and possibly child processes. The parent process and any unrelated processes will not be affected. Similarly, changing or removing a variable&#x27;s value inside a DOS or Windows batch file will change the variable for the duration of codice_5or codice_6&#x27;s existence, respectively.

In Unix, the environment variables are normally initialized during system startup by the system init startup scripts, and hence inherited by all other processes in the system. Users can, and often do, augment them in the profile script for the command shell they are using. In Microsoft Windows, each environment variable&#x27;s default value is stored in the Windows Registry or set in the codice_7 file.

On Unix, a setuid program is given an environment chosen by its caller, but it runs with different authority from its caller. The dynamic linker will usually load code from locations specified by the environment variables codice_8 and codice_9 and run it with the process&#x27;s authority. If a setuid program did this, it would be insecure, because its caller could get it to run arbitrary code and hence misuse its authority. For this reason, libc unsets these environment variables at startup in a setuid process. setuid programs usually unset unknown environment variables and check others or set them to reasonable values.

In general, the collection of environment variables function as an associative array where both the keys and values are strings. The interpretation of characters in either string differs among systems. When data structures such as lists need to be represented, it is common to use a colon (common on Unix and Unix-like) or semicolon-delineated (common on Windows and DOS) list.

== Syntax ==
The variables can be used both in scripts and on the command line. They are usually referenced by putting special symbols in front of or around the variable name.

It is conventional for environment-variable names to be chosen to be in all upper cases. In programming code generally, this helps to distinguish environment variables from other kinds of names in the code. Environment-variable names are case sensitive on Unix-like operating systems but not on DOS, OS/2, and Windows.

=== Unix ===
In most Unix and Unix-like command-line shells, an environment variable&#x27;s value is retrieved by placing a codice_10 sign before the variable&#x27;s name. If necessary, the name can also be surrounded by braces.

To display the user home directory, the user may type:
echo $HOME
In Unix and Unix-like systems, the names of environment variables are case-sensitive.

The command codice_11 displays all environment variables and their values. The command codice_12 can also be used to print a single variable by giving that variable name as the sole argument to the command.

=== DOS, OS/2 and Windows ===
In DOS, OS/2 and Windows command-line interpreters such as codice_13 and codice_14, an environment variable is retrieved by placing a codice_15 sign before and after it.

In DOS, OS/2 and Windows command-line interpreters as well as their API, upper or lower case is not distinguished for environment variable names.

The environment variable named codice_16 contains the drive letter (plus its trailing codice_17 colon) of the user&#x27;s home directory, whilst codice_18 contains the full path of the user&#x27;s home directory within that drive.

So to see the home drive and path, the user may type this:
ECHO %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%
The command codice_19 (with no arguments) displays all environment variables and their values. In Windows NT and later codice_20 can also be used to print all variables whose name begins with a given prefix by giving the prefix as the sole argument to the command.

In Windows PowerShell, the user may type any of the following:
echo $env:homedrive$env:homepath
Write-Output $env:homedrive$env:homepath
&quot;$env:homedrive$env:homepath&quot;
In PowerShell, upper or lower case is not distinguished for environment variable names.

The following command displays all environment variables and their values:
get-childitem env:
=== Assignment: Unix ===
The commands codice_21 and codice_20 can be used to set environment variables and are often incorporated directly into the shell.

The following commands can also be used, but are often dependent on a certain shell.

 &quot;VARIABLE&quot;=&quot;value&quot; # (there must be no spaces around the equals sign)
 export &quot;VARIABLE&quot; # for Bourne and related shells

 export &quot;VARIABLE&quot;=&quot;value&quot; # for ksh, bash, and related shells

 setenv &quot;VARIABLE&quot; &quot;value&quot; # for csh and related shells

A few simple principles govern how environment variables achieve their effect.

Environment variables are local to the process in which they were set. If two shell processes are spawned and the value of an environment variable is changed in one, that change will not be seen by the other.

When a child process is created, it inherits all the environment variables and their values from the parent process. Usually, when a program calls another program, it first creates a child process by forking, then the child adjusts the environment as needed and lastly the child replaces itself with the program to be called. This procedure gives the calling program control over the environment of the called program.

In Unix shells, variables may be assigned without the codice_23 keyword. Variables defined in this way are displayed by the codice_20 command, but are &quot;not&quot; true environment variables, as they are stored only by the shell and are unknown to all other processes. The codice_12 command will not display them, and child processes do not inherit them.

 &quot;VARIABLE&quot;=&quot;value&quot;

The prefix syntax exports a &quot;true&quot; environment variable to a child process without affecting the current process:
 &quot;VARIABLE&quot;=&quot;value&quot; program_name [arguments]

The persistence of an environment variable can be session-wide or system-wide.

codice_26 is a builtin command implemented by both the Bourne shell family (codice_27, codice_28, codice_29, etc.) and the C shell family (csh, tcsh, etc.) of Unix command line shells. It unsets a shell variable, removing it from memory and the shell&#x27;s exported environment. It is implemented as a shell builtin, because it directly manipulates the internals of the shell. Read-only shell variables cannot be unset. If one tries to unset a read-only variable, the codice_26 command will print an error message and return a non-zero exit code.

=== Assignment: DOS, OS/2 and Windows ===
In DOS, OS/2 and Windows command-line interpreters such as codice_13 and codice_14, the codice_33 command is used to assign environment variables and values using the following arguments:

 SET VARIABLE=value

An environment variable is removed via:

 SET VARIABLE=
The codice_19 command without any arguments displays all environment variables along with their values; codice_35, zero or more spaces, will include internal variables too. In codice_14, it is possible to assign local variables that will not be global using the codice_37 command and codice_38 to restore the environment.

Use the switch codice_39 to display the internal documentation, or use the viewer codice_40:

 SET /?
 HELP SET
 SETLOCAL /?
 HELP SETLOCAL

In PowerShell, the assignment follows a syntax similar to Unix:
 $env:VARIABLE = &quot;VALUE&quot;
== Examples ==
Examples of environment variables include:

* codice_41: a list of directory paths. When the user types a command without providing the full path, this list is checked to see whether it contains a path that leads to the command.
* codice_42 (Unix-like) and codice_43 (Microsoft Windows): indicate where a user&#x27;s home directory is located in the file system.
* codice_44 (Unix-like) and codice_45 (Microsoft Windows): for storing application settings. Many applications incorrectly use codice_43 for application settings in Windows: codice_43 should only be used in dialogs that allow user to choose between paths like codice_48; for programmatic purposes, codice_49 (for roaming application settings shared across multiple devices), codice_50 (for local application settings) or codice_51 (for application settings shared between multiple OS users) should be used.
* codice_52 (Unix-like): specifies the type of computer terminal or terminal emulator being used (e.g., codice_53 or codice_54).
* codice_55 (Unix-like): specifies how the prompt is displayed in the Bourne shell and variants.
* codice_56 (Unix-like): used to indicate where a user&#x27;s mail is to be found.
* codice_57: location where processes can store temporary files.

== True environment variables ==

===Unix ===
;codice_58: Contains a colon-separated list of directories that the shell searches for commands that do not contain a slash in their name (commands with slashes are interpreted as file names to execute, and the shell attempts to execute the files directly). It is equivalent to the DOS, OS/2 and Windows codice_59 variable.

;codice_60: Contains the location of the user&#x27;s home directory. Although the current user&#x27;s home directory can also be found out through the C-functions codice_61 and codice_62, codice_60 is often used for convenience in various shell scripts (and other contexts). Using the environment variable also gives the user the possibility to point to another directory.

;codice_64: This variable points to the current directory. Equivalent to the output of the command pwd when called without arguments.

;codice_65: Contains the identifier for the display that X11 programs should use by default.

;codice_8: On many Unix systems with a dynamic linker, contains a colon-separated list of directories that the dynamic linker should search for shared objects when building a process image after codice_2, before searching in any other directories.

;codice_68 or codice_69: Alternatives to codice_8 typically used on older Unix versions.

;codice_71: codice_72 is used to set to the default locale. For example, if the locale values are codice_73, then the language is set to (Brazilian) Portuguese and Brazilian practice is used where relevant. Different aspects of localization are controlled by individual codice_74-variables (codice_75, codice_76, codice_77 etc.). codice_78 can be used to force the same locale for all aspects.

;codice_79: Refers to time zone. It can be in several formats, either specifying the time zone itself or referencing a file (in codice_80).

;codice_81: Contains a colon-separated list of a user&#x27;s web browser preferences, for use by programs that need to allow the user to view content at a URL. The browsers in the list are intended to be attempted from first to last, stopping after the first one that succeeds. This arrangement allows for fallback behavior in different environments, e.g., in an X11 environment, a graphical browser (such as Firefox) can be used, but in a console environment a terminal-base browser (such a Lynx) can be used. A codice_82 token may be present to specify where the URL should be placed; otherwise the browser should be launched with the URL as the first argument.

===DOS ===

Under DOS, the &quot;master environment&quot; is provided by the primary command processor, which inherits the &quot;pre-environment&quot; defined in codice_83 when first loaded. Its size can be configured through the codice_84 parameter between 160 and 32767 bytes. &quot;Local environment&quot; segments inherited to child processes are typically reduced down to the size of the contents they hold. Some command-line processors (like 4DOS) allow to define a minimum amount of free environment space that will be available when launching secondary shells. While the content of environment variables remains unchanged upon storage, their names (without the &quot;codice_15&quot;) are always converted to uppercase, with the exception of &quot;pre-environment variables&quot; defined via the codice_86 directive codice_87 under DR DOS 6.0 and higher (and only with codice_88 (for &quot;allow lowercase names&quot;) under DR-DOS 7.02 and higher). In principle, MS-DOS 7.0 and higher also supports lowercase variable names (codice_89), but provides no means for the user to define them. Environment variable names containing lowercase letters are stored in the environment just like normal environment variables, but remain invisible to most DOS software, since they are written to expect uppercase variables only. Some command processors limit the maximum length of a variable name to 80 characters. While principally only limited by the size of the &quot;environment segment&quot;, some DOS and 16-bit Windows programs do not expect the contents of environment variables to exceed 128 characters. DR-DOS codice_13 supports environment variables up to 255, 4DOS even up to 512 characters. Since codice_13 can be configured (via codice_92) to support command lines up to 1024 characters internally under MS-DOS 7.0 and higher, environment variables should be expected to contain at least 1024 characters as well. In some versions of DR-DOS, the environment passed to drivers, which often do not need their environment after installation, can be shrunken or relocated through codice_93 or codice_94/codice_95 options codice_96 (zero environment), codice_97 (substitute drive, e.g. codice_98) and codice_99 (relocate environment above program) in order to minimize the driver&#x27;s effectively resulting resident memory footprint.

In batch mode, non-existent environment variables are replaced by a zero-length string.

&quot;Standard environment variables&quot; or &quot;reserved environment variables&quot; include:

;codice_100 (supported since DOS 3.3): This variable contains a semicolon-delimited list of directories in which to search for files. It is usually changed via the codice_101 command, which also ensures that the directory names are converted into uppercase. Some DOS software actually expects the names to be stored in uppercase and the length of the list not to exceed 121 characters, therefore the variable is best not modified via the codice_33 command. Long filenames containing spaces or other special characters must not be quoted (codice_103).

;codice_104 (supported since MS-DOS 6.0 and PC DOS 6.1, also supported by ROM-DOS): This variable holds the symbolic name of the currently chosen boot configuration. It is set by the DOS BIOS (codice_105, codice_106, etc.) to the name defined by the corresponding codice_86 directive codice_108 before launching the primary command processor. Its main purpose is to allow further special cases in codice_7 and similar batchjobs depending on the selected option at boot time. This can be emulated under DR-DOS by utilizing the codice_83 directive codice_87 like codice_112.

;codice_113 (introduced with 4DOS, also supported since MS-DOS 7.0): This variable contains the fully expanded text of the currently executing command line. It can be read by applications to detect the usage of and retrieve long command lines, since the traditional method to retrieve the command line arguments through the PSP (or related API functions) is limited to 126 characters and is no longer available when FCBs get expanded or the default DTA is used. While 4DOS supports longer command lines, codice_13 still only supports a maximum of 126 characters at the prompt by default (unless overridden with codice_115 to specify the size of the command line buffer), but nevertheless internal command lines can become longer through f.e. variable expansion (depending on codice_92 to specify the size of the internal buffer). In addition to the command-line length byte in the PSP, the PSP command line is normally limited by ASCII-13, and command lines longer than 126 characters will typically be truncated by having an ASCII-13 inserted at position 127, but this cannot be relied upon in all scenarios. The variable will be suppressed for external commands invoked with a preceding codice_117-symbol like in codice_118 for backward compatibility and in order to minimize the size of the environment when loading non-relocating terminate-and-stay-resident programs. Some beta versions of Windows Chicago used codice_113 to store only the remainder of the command line excessing 126 characters instead of the complete command line.

;codice_120 (supported since DOS 2.0): This variable contains the full 8.3 path to the command processor, typically codice_121 or codice_122. It must not contain long filenames, but under DR-DOS it may contain file and directory passwords. It is set up by the primary command processor to point to itself (typically reflecting the settings of the codice_86 directive codice_124), so that the resident portion of the command processor can reload its transient portion from disk after the execution of larger programs. The value can be changed at runtime to reflect changes in the configuration, which would require the command processor to reload itself from other locations. The variable is also used when launching secondary shells.

;codice_125 (supported since MS-DOS 6.2 and PC DOS 6.3, also supported by ROM-DOS): Allows a user to specify the codice_126 switch (to assume &quot;Yes&quot; on queries) as the default for the codice_127, codice_128, and codice_129 commands. A default of codice_126 can be overridden by supplying the codice_131 switch on the command line. The codice_126 switch instructs the command to replace existing files without prompting for confirmation.

;codice_133 (supported since MS-DOS 5.0 and PC DOS 5.0, also supported by ROM-DOS): Allows a user to specify customized default parameters for the codice_134 command, including file specifications. Preset default switches can be overridden by providing the negative switch on the command line. For example, if codice_133 contains the codice_136 switch, then it can be overridden by using codice_137 at the command line. This is similar to the environment variable codice_138 under DOS Plus and a facility to define default switches for codice_139 through its codice_140 or codice_141 switches under DR-DOS codice_13. codice_133 is also supported by the external codice_144/codice_145 Stacker commands under Novell DOS 7 and higher.

;codice_146 (supported since MS-DOS 7.0): This variable is supported by some tools to switch the locale for messages in multilingual issues.

;codice_147 (supported since MS-DOS 7.0): This variable is supported by some tools to switch the locale for messages in multilingual issues.

;codice_148 (supported since PC DOS 6.3 and DR-DOS 7.07): This variable controls the display of thousands-separators in messages of various commands. Issued by default, they can be suppressed by specifying codice_149 or codice_150 under PC DOS. DR-DOS additionally allows to override the system&#x27;s thousands-separator displayed as in f.e. codice_151.

;codice_152 (supported since DOS 2.0): This variable contains a semicolon-delimited list of directories in which the command interpreter will search for executable files. Equivalent to the Unix codice_153 variable (but some DOS and Windows applications also use the list to search for data files similar to codice_154 on Unix-like systems). It is usually changed via the codice_155 (or codice_156 under MS-DOS 6.0) command, which also ensures that the directory names are converted into uppercase. Some DOS software actually expects the names to be stored in uppercase and the length of the list not to exceed 123 characters, therefore the variable should better not be modified via the codice_33 command. Long filenames containing spaces or other special characters must not be quoted (codice_103). By default, the current directory is searched first, but some command-line processors like 4DOS allow &quot;codice_159&quot; (for &quot;current directory&quot;) to be included in the list as well in order to override this search order; some DOS programs are incompatible with this extension.

;codice_160 (supported since DOS 2.0): This variable contains a codice_10-tokenized string defining the display of the prompt. It is usually changed via the codice_162 command.

;codice_163 (and codice_164): These variables contain the path to the directory where temporary files should be stored. Operating system tools typically only use codice_163, whereas third-party programs also use codice_164. Typically codice_163 takes precedence over codice_164.

The DR-DOS family supports a number of additional &quot;standard environment variables&quot; including:

;codice_169: This variable contains an optional message displayed by some versions (including DR DOS 3.41) of codice_13 at the startup of secondary shells.

;codice_171/codice_172/codice_173: This variable contains the directory (without trailing &quot;codice_174&quot;) where to search for codice_175 and codice_176 configuration files (that is, DR-DOS application specific files like codice_177, codice_178, codice_179, codice_180 etc., class specific files like codice_181, or global files like codice_182, codice_183, codice_184, or codice_185), as used by the codice_186 and codice_187 commands and various DR-DOS programs like codice_188, codice_189, codice_190, codice_191, codice_192, codice_193, codice_194/codice_195, codice_196, codice_197, codice_198, codice_199, or codice_200. It must not contain long filenames.

;codice_201: This variable optionally holds an alternative path to the command processor taking precedence over the path defined in the codice_202 variable, optionally including file and directory passwords. Alternatively, it can hold a special value of &quot;codice_203&quot; or &quot;codice_204&quot; in order to enforce the usage of the codice_202 variable even in scenarios where the codice_202 variable may point to the wrong command-line processor, for example, when running some versions of the DR-DOS codice_207 command under a foreign operating system.

;codice_208: Setting this variable to &quot;codice_203&quot; or &quot;codice_204&quot; will force some versions of the DR-DOS codice_207 command to work under foreign operating systems instead of displaying a warning.

;codice_212: Specifies the user name used by the FastBack command codice_213 and codice_214 configuration files under Novell DOS 7.

;codice_215: This variable may contain the home directory under DR-DOS (including DR DOS 5.0 and 6.0).

;codice_216: In some versions of DR-DOS codice_13 this variable defines the string displayed by the codice_218 token of the codice_162 command. It can be used, for example, to inform the user how to exit secondary shells.

;codice_220: In some versions of DR-DOS codice_13 this variable defines the user name displayed by the codice_222 token of the codice_162 command, as set up by f.e. login scripts for Novell NetWare. See also the similarly named pseudo-variable codice_224.

;codice_225: This variable can take the values &quot;codice_203&quot; or &quot;codice_227&quot; under Multiuser DOS. If enabled, the operating system permits applications to shell out to secondary shells with the DOS Program Area (DPA) freed in order to have maximum DOS memory available for secondary applications instead of running them in the same domain as under DOS.

;codice_228: This variable can be used to define the character displayed by some commands in messages for &quot;No&quot; in codice_229 queries, thereby overriding the current system default (typically &quot;codice_230&quot; in English versions of DR-DOS). If it contains a string, only the first character, uppercased, will be taken. Some commands also support a command line parameter codice_126 to automatically assume &quot;Yes&quot; on queries, thereby suppressing such prompts. If, however, the parameter codice_232 is used to specify the &quot;Yes&quot;/&quot;No&quot; characters (thereby overriding any codice_228 setting), queries are not suppressed. See also the related codice_83 directive codice_235 and the environment variable codice_236.

;codice_237: Setting this variable to &quot;codice_203&quot; or &quot;codice_204&quot; will disable default beeps issued by some DR-DOS commands in certain situations such as to inform the user of the completion of some operation, that user interaction is required, or when a wrong key was pressed. Command line options to specifically enable certain beeps will override this setting.

;codice_240:This variable contains the name of the operating system in order to distinguish between different DOS-related operating systems of Digital Research-origin in batch jobs and applications. Known values include &quot;codice_241&quot; (DOS Plus 1.2 in DOS emulation), &quot;codice_242&quot; (DOS Plus 1.2 in CP/M emulation), &quot;codice_243&quot; (DR DOS 3.31-6.0, DR DOS Panther, DR DOS StarTrek, DR-DOS 7.02-7.05), &quot;codice_244&quot; (EZ-DOS 3.41), &quot;codice_245&quot; and &quot;codice_246&quot; (PalmDOS 1.0), &quot;codice_247&quot; (Novell DOS 7), &quot;codice_248&quot; (Novell DOS 7 Beta), &quot;codice_249&quot; (Caldera OpenDOS 7.01, Caldera DR-OpenDOS 7.02), &quot;codice_250&quot; (Concurrent DOS, Concurrent DOS XM), &quot;codice_251&quot; (Concurrent PC DOS), &quot;codice_252&quot; (Concurrent DOS 386), &quot;codice_253&quot; (DR Multiuser DOS), &quot;codice_254&quot; (CCI Multiuser DOS), &quot;codice_255&quot; (IMS Multiuser DOS), &quot;codice_256&quot; (REAL/32). MS-DOS codice_257 looks for a value of &quot;codice_243&quot; as well. See also the identically named environment variable codice_259 later introduced in the Windows NT family.

;codice_260: In some versions of DR-DOS this variable defines the command executed by the codice_261 token of the codice_162 command before codice_13 displays the prompt after returning from external program execution.

;codice_264: This variable defines the SwitChar to be used for argument parsing by some DR-DOS commands. If defined, it overrides the system&#x27;s current SwitChar setting. The only accepted characters are &quot;codice_265&quot; (DOS style), &quot;codice_266&quot; (Unix style) and &quot;codice_267&quot; (CP/M style). See also the related codice_83 directive codice_269 (to set the system&#x27;s SwitChar setting) and the codice_270 &quot;system information variable&quot; in some issues of DR-DOS codice_13 (to retrieve the current setting for portable batchjobs).

;codice_272: This variable specifies the directory, where the Windows codice_273 to be used by the DR-DOS codice_198 multitasker is located, overriding the default procedure to locate the file.

;codice_275: This variable contains the version of the operating system in order to distinguish between different versions of DR-DOS in batch jobs and in the display of the codice_276 command. It is also used for the codice_277 token of the codice_162 command and affects the value returned by the &quot;system information variable&quot; codice_279. Known values include &quot;codice_280&quot; (PalmDOS 1.0), &quot;codice_281&quot; (DOS Plus 1.2 in DOS emulation), &quot;codice_282&quot; (Concurrent DOS 386 2.0), &quot;codice_283&quot; (Concurrent DOS 386 3.0), &quot;codice_284&quot; (DR DOS 3.31), &quot;codice_285&quot; (DR DOS 3.32), &quot;codice_286&quot; (DR DOS 3.33), &quot;codice_287&quot; (DR DOS 3.34), &quot;codice_288&quot; (DR DOS 3.35), &quot;codice_289&quot; (DR DOS 3.40), &quot;codice_290&quot; (DR DOS 3.41, EZ-DOS 3.41), &quot;codice_291&quot; (DR DOS 3.41T), &quot;codice_292&quot; (Concurrent PC DOS 4.1), &quot;codice_293&quot; (DR DOS 5.0, DR Multiuser DOS 5.0), &quot;codice_294&quot; (Novell DR Multiuser DOS 5.1), &quot;codice_295&quot; (DR Concurrent DOS XM 6.0, DR DOS 6.0), &quot;codice_296&quot; (DR Concurrent DOS XM 6.2), &quot;codice_297&quot; (Novell DOS 7, Caldera OpenDOS 7.01, DR-DOS 7.02-7.05), &quot;codice_298&quot; (CCI Multiuser DOS 7.00), &quot;codice_299&quot; (DR-DOS 7.07), &quot;codice_300&quot; (IMS Multiuser DOS 7.1), &quot;codice_301&quot; (CCI Multiuser DOS 7.21), &quot;codice_302&quot; (CCI Multiuser DOS 7.22) etc.

;codice_303:This variable can be used to define the character displayed by some commands in messages for &quot;Yes&quot; in codice_229 queries, thereby overriding the current system default (typically &quot;codice_305&quot; in English versions of DR-DOS). If it contains a string, only the first character, uppercased, will be taken. Some commands also support a command line parameter codice_126 to automatically assume &quot;Yes&quot; on queries, thereby suppressing such prompts. If, however, the parameter codice_307 is used to specify the &quot;Yes&quot; character (thereby overriding any codice_303 setting), queries are not suppressed. See also the related codice_83 directive codice_310 and the environment variable codice_311.

;codice_312: This variable defines the control sequence to be sent to the console driver to clear the screen when the codice_313 command is issued, thereby overriding the internal default (&quot;codice_314&quot; under DR-DOS, &quot;codice_315&quot; under DOS Plus 1.2 on Amstrad machines as well as under Concurrent DOS, Multiuser DOS, and REAL/32 for VT52 terminals, or &quot;codice_316&quot; under Multiuser DOS for ASCII terminals). If the variable is not defined and no codice_317 console driver is detected, the DR-DOS codice_13 will directly clear the screen via codice_319 BIOS function, like MS-DOS/PC DOS codice_13 does. A special codice_321-notation for octal numbers is supported to allow the definition of special characters like ESC (ASCII-27 = &quot;←&quot; = 1Bh = 33o), as f.e. in codice_322. To send the backslash (&quot;codice_174&quot;) itself, it can be doubled &quot;codice_324&quot;.

;codice_325: Supported by DOS Plus accepting the values &quot;L&quot; (long) or &quot;W&quot; (wide) to change the default layout of directory listings with DIR. Can be overridden using the command line options codice_326 or codice_136. See also the similar environment variable codice_328 and the codice_139 options codice_140 and codice_141 of the DR-DOS COMMAND.COM.

;codice_332: Supported by DOS Plus accepting the values &quot;codice_203&quot; or &quot;codice_227&quot; for pagination control. Setting this to &quot;codice_203&quot; has the same affect as adding codice_336 to commands supporting it (like DIR or TYPE).

;codice_337: Used by DOS Plus to define the screen length of the console in lines. This is used to control in a portable way when the screen output should be temporarily halted until a key is pressed in conjunction with the codice_336 option supported by various commands or with automatic pagnination. See also the related environment variables codice_339 and codice_340 as well as the similar pseudo-variable codice_341.

;codice_342: Used by DOS Plus to define the screen width of the console in columns. This is used to control in a portable way the formatting of the screen output of commands like codice_343 or codice_344. See also the related environment variables codice_345 and codice_340 as well as the similar pseudo-variable codice_347.

;codice_348: Used by DOS Plus accepting a numerical value to control the foreground/background time slicing of multitasking programs. See also the DOS Plus command codice_349.

;codice_350: This variable can hold an optional control sequence to switch text highlighting, reversion or colorization on. It is used to emphasize or otherwise control the display of the file names in commands like codice_351, for example codice_352 with ANSI.SYS loaded or codice_353 for an IBM or ESC/P printer. For the special codice_321 octal notation supported, see codice_355. While the variable is undefined by default under DOS Plus and DR-DOS, the Multiuser DOS default for an ASCII terminal equals codice_356. See also the related environment variable codice_357.

;codice_358: This variable can hold an optional control sequence to switch text highlighting, reversion or colorization off. It is used to return to the normal output after the display of file names in commands like codice_351, for example codice_360 with ANSI.SYS loaded or codice_361 for an IBM or ESC/P printer. For the special codice_321 octal notation supported, see codice_355. While the variable is undefined by default under DOS Plus and DR-DOS, the Multiuser DOS default for an ASCII terminal equals codice_364. See also the related environment variable codice_365.

;codice_366: This variable can hold an optional control sequence issued before the output of the file contents in commands like codice_367 under DR-DOS 7.02 and higher. It can be used for highlighting, pagination or formatting, f.e. when sending the output to a printer, i.e. codice_368 for an IBM or ESC/P printer. For the special codice_321 octal notation supported, see codice_355. See also the related environment variable codice_371.

;codice_372: This variable can hold an optional control sequence issued after the output of the file contents in commands like codice_367 under DR-DOS 7.02 and higher. It is used to return to the normal output format, i.e. codice_374 in the printer example above. For the special codice_321 octal notation supported, see codice_355. See also the related environment variable codice_377.

Datalight ROM-DOS supports a number of additional &quot;standard environment variables&quot; as well including:

;codice_378: This variable is used to define non-standard screen sizes codice_379 for codice_380 options codice_336 and codice_136 (similar to codice_345 and codice_339 under DOS Plus).

;codice_385: This variable is automatically set to the first parameter given to the CONFIG.SYS directive NEWFILE.

codice_386, codice_387, codice_388, codice_389, codice_390 and codice_391 are also used by ROM-DOS.

===OS/2 ===

;codice_392: Contains a semicolon-separated list of directories which are searched for DLLs &quot;before&quot; the directories given by the codice_393 variable (which is set during system startup with the special CONFIG.SYS directive codice_394). It is possible to specify relative directories here, including &quot;codice_159&quot; for the current working directory. See also the related environment variable codice_396.

;codice_397: a list of directories to be searched for DLLs like codice_398, but searched &quot;after&quot; the list of directories in codice_393.

===Windows ===
These environment variables refer to locations of critical operating system resources, and as such generally are not user-dependent.

;codice_400: Contains the full path to the &quot;Application Data&quot; directory of the logged-in user. Does not work on Windows NT 4.0 SP6 UK.

;codice_401: This variable is the temporary files of &quot;Applications&quot;. Its uses include storing of desktop themes, Windows error reporting, caching and profiles of web browsers.

;codice_402/codice_403:The codice_404 variable contains the full path to the command processor; on the Windows NT family of operating systems, this is cmd.exe, while on Windows 9x, codice_202 is COMMAND.COM.

;codice_240:The codice_240 variable contains a symbolic name of the operating system family to distinguish between differing feature sets in batchjobs. It resembles an identically named environment variable codice_408 found in all DOS-related operating systems of Digital Research-origin like Concurrent DOS, Multiuser DOS, REAL/32, DOS Plus, DR DOS, Novell DOS and OpenDOS. codice_240 always holds the string &quot;codice_410&quot; on the Windows NT family.

;codice_411: This variable contains a semicolon-delimited (do not put spaces in between) list of directories in which the command interpreter will search for an executable file that matches the given command. Environment variables that represent paths may be nested within the codice_411 variable, but only at one level of indirection. If this sub-path environment variable itself contains an environment variable representing a path, codice_411 will not expand properly in the variable substitution. Equivalent to the Unix codice_153 variable.

;codice_415, codice_416, codice_417, codice_418, codice_419: These variables contain details of the CPU; they are set during system installation.

;codice_420: The codice_420 variable (introduced with Vista) points to the &quot;Public&quot; (pseudo) user profile directory &quot;codice_422&quot;.

;codice_423, codice_424, codice_425: The codice_423 variable points to the &quot;Program Files&quot; directory, which stores all the installed programs of Windows and others. The default on English-language systems is &quot;codice_427&quot;. In 64-bit editions of Windows (XP, 2003, Vista), there are also codice_424, which defaults to &quot;codice_429&quot;, and codice_425, which defaults to &quot;codice_427&quot;. The codice_423 itself depends on whether the process requesting the environment variable is itself 32-bit or 64-bit (this is caused by Windows-on-Windows 64-bit redirection).

;codice_433, codice_434, codice_435: This variable points to the &quot;Common Files&quot; subdirectory of the &quot;Program Files&quot; directory. The default on English-language systems is &quot;codice_436&quot;. In 64-bit editions of Windows (XP, 2003, Vista), there are also codice_424, which defaults to &quot;codice_429&quot;, and codice_425, which defaults to &quot;codice_427&quot;. The codice_423 itself depends on whether the process requesting the environment variable is itself 32-bit or 64-bit (this is caused by Windows-on-Windows 64-bit redirection).

;codice_442: The codice_442 variable is a special system-wide environment variable found on Windows NT and its derivatives. Its value is the path of where (if installed and setup) the Onedrive directory is located. The value of codice_442 is in most cases &quot;codice_445&quot;.

;codice_446: The codice_446 variable is a special system-wide environment variable found on Windows NT and its derivatives. Its value is the drive upon which the system directory was placed. The value of codice_446 is in most cases &quot;codice_449&quot;.

;codice_450:The codice_450 variable is a special system-wide environment variable found on the Windows NT family of operating systems. Its value is the location of the system directory, including the drive and path. The drive is the same as codice_446 and the default path on a clean installation depends upon the version of the operating system. By default:
:* Windows XP and newer versions use &quot;codice_453&quot;.
:* Windows 2000, NT 4.0 and NT 3.1 use &quot;codice_454&quot;.
:* Windows NT 3.5 and NT 3.51 uses &quot;codice_455&quot;.
:* Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server uses &quot;codice_456&quot;.

;codice_457:This variable points to the &quot;Windows&quot; directory. (On the Windows NT family of operating systems, it is identical to the codice_450 variable). Windows 95–98 and Windows ME are, by default, installed in &quot;codice_459&quot;. For other versions of Windows, see the codice_450 entry above.

&quot;User management variables&quot; store information related to resources and settings owned by various user profiles within the system. As a general rule, these variables do not refer to critical system resources or locations that are necessary for the OS to run.

;codice_461 (codice_462 since Windows Vista): This variable expands to the full path to the &quot;All Users&quot; profile directory. This profile contains resources and settings that are used by all system accounts. Shortcut links copied to the &quot;All Users&quot;\&#x27; &quot;Start menu&quot; or &quot;Desktop&quot; directories will appear in every user&#x27;s &quot;Start menu&quot; or &quot;Desktop&quot;, respectively.

;codice_463: The name of the &quot;Workgroup&quot; or &quot;Windows Domain&quot; to which the current user belongs. The related variable, codice_464, holds the hostname of the server that authenticated the current user&#x27;s login credentials (name and password). For home PCs and PCs in a workgroup, the authenticating server is usually the PC itself. For PCs in a Windows domain, the authenticating server is a domain controller (a primary domain controller, or PDC, in Windows NT 4-based domains).

;codice_465: A special system-wide environment variable found on Windows NT and its derivatives. Its value is the location of the current user&#x27;s profile directory, in which is found that user&#x27;s HKCU registry hive (codice_466). Users can also use the codice_467 variable to determine the active users login identification.

&quot;Optional System variables&quot; are not explicitly specified by default but can be used to modify the default behavior of certain built-in console commands. These variables also do not need to be explicitly specified as command line arguments.

==== Default values ====
The following tables shows typical default values of certain environment variables under English versions of Windows as they can be retrieved under codice_468.

(Some of these variables are also defined when running codice_13 under Windows, but differ in certain important details: Under codice_13, the names of environment variable are always uppercased. Some, but not all variables contain short 8.3 rather than long file names. While some variables present in the codice_471 environment are missing, there are also some variables specific to the codice_472 environment.)
In this list, there is no environment variable that refers to the location of the user&#x27;s &quot;My Documents&quot; directory, so there is no standard method for setting a program&#x27;s home directory to be the &quot;My Documents&quot; directory.

== Pseudo-environment variables ==

The command processors in DOS and Windows also support pseudo-environment variables. These are values that are fetched like environment variables, but are not truly stored in the environment but computed when requested.

===DOS ===
Besides true environment variables, which are statically stored in the environment until changed or deleted, a number of pseudo-environment variables exist for batch processing.

The so-called &quot;replacement parameters&quot; or &quot;replaceable parameters&quot; (Microsoft / IBM terminology) aka &quot;replacement variables&quot; (Digital Research / Novell / Caldera terminology) or &quot;batch file parameters&quot; (JP Software terminology) codice_473..codice_474 and codice_475 can be used to retrieve the calling parameters of a batchjob, see codice_476. In batchjobs, they can be retrieved just like environment variables, but are not actually stored in the environment.
Some command-line processors (like DR-DOS codice_13, Multiuser DOS codice_478/codice_479 (Terminal Message Process), JP Software 4DOS, 4OS2, 4NT, Take Command and Windows cmd.exe) support a type of pseudo-environment variables named &quot;system information variables&quot; (Novell / Caldera terminology) or &quot;internal variables&quot; (JP Software terminology), which can be used to retrieve various possibly dynamic, but read-only information about the running system in batch jobs. The returned values represent the status of the system in the moment these variables are queried; that is, reading them multiple times in a row may return different values even within the same command; querying them has no direct effect on the system. Since they are not stored in the environment, they are not listed by SET and do not exist for external programs to retrieve. If a true environment variable of the same name is defined, it takes precedence over the corresponding variable until the environment variable is deleted again. They are not case-sensitive.
While almost all such variables are prefixed with an underscore (&quot;codice_480&quot;) by 4DOS etc. by convention (f.e. codice_481), they are not under DR-DOS codice_13 (f.e. codice_279).

In addition, 4DOS, 4OS2, 4NT, and Take Command also support so called &quot;variable functions&quot;, including user-definable ones. They work just like &quot;internal variables&quot;, but can take optional parameters (f.e. codice_484) and may even change the system status depending on their function.

&quot;System information variables&quot; supported by DR-DOS codice_13:

;codice_486: This pseudo-variable returns the ante- or post-midday status of the current time. The returned string depends on the locale-specific version of DR-DOS, f.e. &quot;codice_487&quot; or &quot;codice_488&quot; in the English version. It resembles an identically named &quot;identifier variable&quot; in Novell NetWare login scripts.

;codice_548: This pseudo-variable returns the version of the operating system depending on the current setting of the environment variable codice_549. If codice_275 is not defined, codice_548 returns &quot;codice_552&quot;. It resembles an identically named &quot;identifier variable&quot; in Novell NetWare login scripts, which may return versions also for non-DR-DOS versions of DOS.

&quot;System information variables&quot; supported by DR-DOS codice_13 with networking loaded:

;codice_631: This pseudo-variable returns the user name. This always worked with codice_632, but it will also work with Personal NetWare&#x27;s ODI/VLM if the current drive is a PNW-mapped drive (otherwise an empty string is returned). See also the similarly named environment variable codice_633.

;codice_634: This pseudo-variable returns the physical station number in a format &quot;codice_635&quot;. The value depends on the MAC address of the network adapter, but can be overridden. It resembles an identically named &quot;identifier variable&quot; in Novell NetWare login scripts.

;codice_636: This pseudo-variable returns the logical station number starting with &quot;codice_204&quot; for the first client. The numbers are assigned by the file server and remain static for as long as the IPX connection remains established. It resembles an identically named &quot;identifier variable&quot; in Novell NetWare login scripts.

;codice_638: This pseudo-variable returns the full name of the logged in user, if available. It resembles an identically named &quot;identifier variable&quot; in Novell NetWare login scripts. See also the related pseudo-variable codice_224.

===Windows ===
&quot;Dynamic environment variables&quot; (also named &quot;internal variables&quot; or &quot;system information variables&quot; under DOS) are pseudo-environment variables supported by codice_640 when command-line extensions are enabled, and they expand to various discrete values whenever queried, that is, their values can change when queried multiple times even within the same command. While they can be used in batch jobs and at the prompt, they are not stored in the environment. Consequently, they are neither listed by codice_19 nor do they exist for external programs to read. They are not case-sensitive.

Indirectly, they are also supported under Windows&#x27; codice_13, which has been modified to internally call codice_14 to execute the commands.

;codice_644: This pseudo-variable expands to the current directory equivalent to the output of the command codice_645 when called without arguments. While a long filename can be returned under codice_14 depending on the current directory, the fact that the current directory will always be in 8.3 format under codice_13 will cause it to return a short filename under codice_13, even when codice_472 internally calls codice_471.

;codice_651: This pseudo-variable expands to the original startup parameters of codice_6, f.e. &quot;codice_653&quot;. Under Windows&#x27; codice_13, this may return something like &quot;codice_655&quot; due to the fact that codice_13 calls codice_14 internally.

;codice_658: This pseudo-variable expands to the version of the command-line extensions of codice_6, if enabled (e.g. &quot;codice_204&quot; under Windows NT, &quot;codice_661&quot; under Windows 2000 and Windows XP).

;codice_662: This pseudo-variable expands to the current date. The date is displayed according to the current user&#x27;s date format preferences.

;codice_501: This pseudo-variable expands to the last set error level, a value between &quot;codice_504&quot; and &quot;codice_505&quot; (without leading zeros). External commands and some internal commands set error levels upon execution. See also the identically named pseudo-variable codice_511 under DR-DOS and the codice_667 command.

;codice_668: This pseudo-variable returns the number of the highest NUMA node.

;codice_669: This pseudo-variable returns a random number between &quot;codice_504&quot; and &quot;codice_671&quot;.

;codice_672: This pseudo-variable returns the current time. The time is displayed according to the current user&#x27;s time format preferences. If the codice_672 and codice_674 variables are both used, it is important to read them both in this particular order in rapid succession in order to avoid midnight-rollover problems.

===Other shells===
Unix-like shells have similar dynamically generated variables, bash&#x27;s codice_675 being a well-known example. However, since these shells have a concept of local variables, they are described as special local variables instead.

<doc id="349508" wikidata="Q1382222" url="?curid=349508" title="Alexandre Auguste Ledru-Rollin">
<text>Alexandre Auguste Ledru-Rollin (; 2 February 1807 – 31 December 1874) was a French lawyer, politician and one of the leaders of the French Revolution of 1848.

==Youth==
The grandson of Nicolas Philippe Ledru, the celebrated quack doctor known as &quot;Comus&quot; under Louis XV and Louis XVI, Ledru-Rollin was born in Paris. He had just begun to practice at the Parisian bar before the Revolution of July 1830 and was retained for the Republican defence in most of the great political trials of the next ten years. In 1838, he bought for 330,000 francs Désiré Dalloz&#x27;s place in the Court of Cassation. He was elected deputy for Le Mans in 1841 with little opposition; but the violence of his electoral speeches led to his being tried at Angers and sentenced to four months&#x27; imprisonment and a fine, against which he appealed successfully on a technical point.

Under Louis Philippe he made large contributions to French jurisprudence, editing the &quot;Journal du palais, 1791–1837&quot; (27 you., 1837) and 1837–1847 (17 vols.), with a commentary &quot;Repertoire général de la jurisprudence française&quot; (8 vols., 1843–1848), the introduction to which was written by himself. His later writings were political in character. See &quot;Ledru-Rollin, ses discours et ses écrits politiques&quot; (2 vols., Paris, 1879), edited by his widow.

==Politics==
He made a rich and romantic marriage in 1843 and, in 1846, disposed of his charge at the Court of Cassation to give his time entirely to politics. He was now the recognized leader of the working-men of France. He had more authority in the country than in the Chamber, where the violence of his oratory diminished its effect. He asserted that the fortifications of Paris were directed against liberty, not against foreign invasion, and he stigmatized the law of regency (1842) as an audacious usurpation.

Neither from official liberalism nor from the press did he receive support; even the republican &quot;National&quot; was opposed to him because of his championship of labour. He therefore founded &quot;La Réforme&quot;, in which to advance his propaganda. Between Ledru-Rollin and Odilon Barrot with the other chiefs of the &quot;dynastic Left&quot; there were acute differences, hardly dissimulated even during the temporary alliance which produced the campaign of the banquets. 

==1848==
It was the speeches of Ledru-Rollin and Louis Blanc at working-men&#x27;s banquets in Lille, Dijon and Chalons that heralded the revolution of 1848. Ledru-Rollin prevented the appointment of the duchess of Orleans as regent in 1848. He and Alphonse de Lamartine held the tribune in the Chamber of Deputies until the Parisian populace stopped serious discussion by invading the Chamber. He was minister of the interior in the provisional government, and was also a member of the executive committee appointed by the Constituent Assembly, from which Louis Blanc and the extremists were excluded. At the crisis of 15 May, he definitively sided with Lamartine and the party of order against the proletariat.

Henceforward his position was a difficult one. He never regained his influence with the working classes, who considered they had been betrayed; but to his short ministry belongs the credit of the establishment of a working system of universal suffrage. At the presidential election in December he was put forward as the Socialist candidate, but secured only 370,000 votes. Ledru-Rollin led the Mountain, a republican grouping, to the 1849 legislative election, and secured 25% of the vote. His opposition to the policy of President Louis Napoleon, especially French intervention in the Roman Republic (1849–1850), led to his moving the impeachment of the president and his ministers. The motion was defeated, and the next day (13 June 1849) he headed what he called a peaceful demonstration, and his enemies, armed insurrection.

==Exile and final years==
Ledru-Rollin himself escaped to London where he joined the executive of the revolutionary committee of Europe, with Lajos Kossuth and Giuseppe Mazzini among his colleagues. He was accused of complicity in an obscure attempt (1857) against the life of Napoleon III of France, and condemned in his absence to deportation. Émile Ollivier removed the exceptions from the general amnesty in 1870, and Ledru-Rollin returned to France after twenty years of exile. Though elected in 1871 in three departments he refused to sit in the National Assembly, and took no serious part in politics until 1874 when he was returned to the Assembly as member for Vaucluse.

Ledru-Rollin died in Fontenay-aux-Roses.

There is currently an avenue as well as a Paris Métro station named Ledru-Rollin.

==Quote==
Some variation of the following is often attributed to Ledru-Rollin: 

* &quot;There go the people. I must follow them, for I am their leader.&quot; 
* &quot;There go my people. I must find out where they are going so I can lead them&quot;
* &quot;Eh! je suis leur chef, il fallait bien les suivre.&quot; &quot;Ah well! I am their leader, I really ought to follow them!&quot;

The quote is probably apocryphal.

<doc id="349514" wikidata="Q601266" url="?curid=349514" title="Louis-Antoine Garnier-Pagès">
<text>Louis-Antoine Garnier-Pagès (16 February 1803 – 31 October 1878) was a French politician and active freemason who fought on the barricades during the revolution of July.

Garnier-Pagès was born in Marseille. He served as a member of the Provisional Government of 1848 under Jacques-Charles Dupont de l&#x27;Eure as well as Mayor of Paris from February to March 1848, and then a member of the Government of National Defense (1870-1871) under Louis Jules Trochu as a minister without portfolio.

He was a keen promoter of reform and was a leading spirit in the affair of the reform banquet fixed for 22 February 1848. He was a member of the provisional government of 1848, and was named mayor of Paris. On 5 March 1848, he was made minister of finance and incurred great unpopularity by the imposition of additional taxes. A surtax of 45 percent was implemented what came to be known as &quot;the forty-five centimes&quot;. 1 member of the Constituent Assembly and of the Executive Commission, he was also instrumental in the creation of the nationwide network of comptoirs d&#x27;escompte.

Under the Empire he was conspicuous in the Republican opposition and opposed the war with Prussia, and after the fall of Napoleon III became a member of the Government of National Defence. Unsuccessful at the elections for the National Assembly (8 February 1871), he retired into private life. He wrote &quot;Histoire de la revolution de 1848&quot; (1860–1862); &quot;Histoire de la commission executive&quot; (1869–1872); and &quot;L&#x27;Opposition et l&#x27;empire&quot; (1872). He died in Paris, aged 75.

<doc id="349518" wikidata="Q61149" url="?curid=349518" title="Heinrich Göbel">
<text>Heinrich Göbel (April 20, 1818December 4, 1893) was a German-born American precision mechanic and inventor also known by his anglicized name Henry Goebel. In 1848 he immigrated to New York City, where he resided until his death. He received American citizenship in 1865.

In 1893, magazines and newspapers reported that 25 years earlier Göbel had developed incandescent light bulbs comparable to those invented in 1879 by Thomas Alva Edison. Göbel did not apply for a patent for this invention.

In 1893, the Edison Electric Light Company sued three manufacturers of incandescent lamps for infringing Edison&#x27;s patent. The defense of these companies claimed the Edison patent was void because of the same invention by Göbel 25 years earlier, which came to be known as the &quot;Goebel defense&quot;.

Judges of four courts raised doubts; there was no clear and convincing proof for the claimed invention. Research work published in 2007 concluded that the Goebel defense was fraudulent. After Göbel&#x27;s death the legend arose in some countries that he was the true inventor of the practical incandescent light bulb.

Göbel acquired patents for an improvement of sewing machines in 1865, for an improvement of the Geissler pump in 1882, and for a technique to connect carbon threads to metal wires in incandescent lamps in 1882. These three patents have had no influence on further technical developments to date.

==Biography==

===Springe, Germany 1818–1848 ===
On April 20, 1818, Heinrich Göbel was born in Springe near Hanover in Germany. His father, Heinrich Christian Göbel, was a gardener and later a door-to-door salesman for chocolate. The name of his mother was Marie Eleonore née Hüper. At that time Springe was a small village in the Kingdom of Hanover with less than 2000 inhabitants that mostly worked in agriculture.

Heinrich Göbel finished school in 1832 with poor marks. One teacher commented, &quot;He seems to have an inventive mind. The reasons of the poor marks appear to be in his lengthy illness.&quot;

In 1834, master locksmith Gerhard Linde of Springe took on Göbel as an apprentice for three years. It is not known whether Göbel finished this apprenticeship. Göbel started to work as a repair mechanic in 1837. Later in the 1850s in New York, he gave 1837 as the foundation date of his business on a business card of his shop.

In 1844, Göbel married Sophie Lübke née Rodewig, stating watchmaker as his profession at that time. There are no sources to confirm training as watchmaker, but Göbel likely learned by doing work comparable to a precision mechanic before he began operating his one-person business repairing and selling clocks. His son Johann Carl was born 1846, and his daughter Marie Sophie in 1848.

At the age of 30, Göbel migrated to New York City with his family, leaving Germany through Bremen in November 1848 on the sailing ship , arriving in New York on 31 January 1849. According to the list of passengers of the ship, he gave mechanic as his profession. The reasons for migration are not known.

=== New York 1849–1893 ===
In New York City, Göbel opened a shop in Monroe Street called &quot;Jewelry, Horology and Optician&#x27;s Store&quot;. To supplement his income, Göbel constructed a telescope. In the 1850s and 1860s he frequently transported his large telescope on a horse wagon to Union Square in the evening, and for a fee people could use his telescope to observe the stars. In litigations of the year 1893 many persons remembered the &quot;telescope-man&quot;.

On March 23, 1865, he took the oath on the Constitution of the United States and was henceforth an American citizen, signing with &quot;Henry Goebel&quot;. The anglicisation of his name took place sometime after 1852.

On May 9, 1865, Göbel obtained U.S. Patent No. 47632 (&quot;Hemmer for sewing machines&quot;). He probably got the idea when thinking about how to make the sewing work of his daughter more easy. However, he was not successful in monetising the patent.

Göbel moved his shop to Grand Street 500 in 1872 and to Grand Street 468 in 1877.

In 1881, Göbel Goebel worked for the &quot;American Electric Light Co.&quot; for half a year, where there was a need for precision mechanics for the construction of electric lamps. He also produced carbon filaments in his shop for the company. He then tried to start his own business in the field of incandescent light bulbs with his friend John Kulenkamp. Both were members of a Lodge of Freemasons of German immigrants.

On April 30, 1882, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported on an exhibition of incandescent light bulbs in Göbel&#x27;s shop. According to this report, Göbel claimed the electric light was by no means as new an invention as it was popularly supposed to be, and that he knew this kind of light since his time in Germany. He affirmed he produced electric lights since the 1850s, without giving technical details. The lamps on exhibition were incandescent light bulbs with carbon-filaments of high resistance, made of fibres of reed.

Two patents were granted to Heinrich Göbel in 1882: an improvement of the Geissler system of vacuum pumps, and a solution to connect carbon-filaments and metal-wires in a light bulb.

In 1882, Göbel offered to sell his inventions to the Edison Electric Light Co. for a few thousand dollars, but Edison did not see enough merit in the invention to accept the offer.

In the 1880s, some patent attorneys visited Göbel because of the 1882 story in the &quot;New York Times&quot;. They were interested in early incandescent light bulbs to put Edison&#x27;s patent of 1880 into question. Later, they said, there was not much evidence, and Göbel was not able to present old lamps.

In 1887, Göbel&#x27;s wife Sofie died. They had at least eight more children in the US; seven of whom survived both parents. Göbel retired in the late 1880s, and his son Henry became the owner of the shop.

In 1893, New York patent attorneys Witter &amp; Kenyon became defense counsel in three cases of patent infringement, with Göbel becoming their primary witness and used his 1882 story to create the &quot;Göbel defense&quot;. Lawsuits using the &quot;Göbel defense&quot; continued until May 1894.

Heinrich Göbel died on December 4, 1893, from pneumonia. He was buried at Green-Wood Cemetery.

The work for the &quot;American Electric Light Co.&quot; in 1881, the patents from 1882, and the report in the &quot;New York Times&quot; from April 30, 1882 are the earliest clear sources for work of Heinrich Göbel related to incandescent electric light bulbs. No earlier source is known to prove any kind of relation with incandescent light bulbs, nor indeed any kind of work in the field of electricity.

== The claimed Göbel anticipation concerning Edison&#x27;s incandescent light bulb patents ==

=== Litigation using the &quot;Göbel defense&quot; in 1893 and 1894 ===



In 1892, the litigation &quot;Edison Electric Light Co. vs. United States Electric Lighting Co.&quot; from 1885 came to a final decision. The court confirmed the patents of Thomas Edison related to the incandescent light bulb.

Based on this decision, Edison Electric brought suits to obtain preliminary injunctions to close the productions of incandescent light bulbs of the Beacon Vacuum Pump and Electrical Company, Boston; Columbia Incandescent Lamp Company, St. Louis; and Electric Manufacturing Company, Oconto, Wisconsin.

Patent attorneys Witter &amp; Kenyon became defense counsel in all three cases. They declared Edison&#x27;s patents void because it was not a novelty in 1880. Their witness, Heinrich Göbel, made a claim he had designed the first practical incandescent electric light bulb in 1854. He said he had used his lamps for personal purpose without applying for a patent. The counsels called this an &quot;overseen invention&quot;. Göbel was an unknown person at that time.

Göbel&#x27;s main evidence was discounted by U.S. patent courts. Göbel himself was the most important witness of the defendant companies. Witter &amp; Kenyon worked out an extensive defense with several hundred pages of affidavits. So-called &quot;Original Lamps &quot; were presented at court. Witnesses said they existed earlier than 1880. Furthermore, so-called &quot;Reproduced Lamps&quot; were presented at court. Witnesses said Göbel had produced these lamps himself at Beacon Vacuum Pump and Electrical Company, using his old tools. In 1893, Heinrich Göbel was 75. He said that he had lost a lot of lamps and tools for the production of lamps when he left his shop in New York years ago.

In the case &quot;Edison Electric Light Co.&quot; vs. &quot;Columbia Incandescent Lamp Co., St. Louis&quot; 181 persons supported the &quot;Goebel-Defense&quot; providing affidavits and 142 persons supported the Edison view. The view of the &quot;Edison Electric Light Co.&quot; was Göbel did not built practical incandescent light bulbs before 1880. The counsels of the &quot;Goebel-Defense&quot; didn&#x27;t provide any documentation or convincing proof which could be dated without any doubt to a time earlier than 1880, the year the patent was granted to Thomas Edison.

Many persons providing affidavits in 1893 said that they had seen the electric lamps of Henry Goebel in the 1850s to the 1870s. Henry Goebel used his lamps according to these affidavits for the advertisement of his shop in New York and for the advertisement of his telescope at Union Square, New York. Members of Goebel&#x27;s family and friends of them affirmed the usage of incandescent lamps in the daily life of the family before the year 1880. The most surprising story for the public was the alleged usage of incandescent lamps for the advertisement of Goebel&#x27;s telescope in the center of New York for years. It was said, thousands of New Yorkers had seen Goebel&#x27;s lamps. Approximately 75 witnesses confirmed this in affidavits; approximately the same number of witnesses remembered oil-lamps only.

Goebel claimed his lamp contained a high resistance filament of carbon, platinum lead-in wires in an all-glass envelope, and a high vacuum produced with the Torricellian method using mercury. He tried several materials to produce the carbon filaments and discovered the advantages of bamboo. These solutions were exactly the results of the research work of the &quot;Edison Electric Light Co.&quot; and the novelties of Edison&#x27;s patents.

Technical experts of both sides gave their opinion about the Goebel lamps and the claimed way of production in affidavits. Experts of the Edison side contested the quality of the lamps and the possibility to produce lamps using the affirmed procedure. Experts of the &quot;Goebel-Defense&quot; confirmed the quality of the lamps and the method of production. Witnesses of the &quot;Goebel-Defense&quot; said, that reproduced lamps burnt 45, 87 and 166 hours. Edison&#x27;s lamps burnt at time of applying for a patent approximately 40 hours. So-called &quot;Goebel Original Lamps&quot; were broken in 1893. Experts of the Edison side said that they never burnt.

Lewis Latimer, an employee of the &quot;Edison Electric Light Co.&quot; and responsible to support their counsels, discredited Goebel by demonstrating that his supposed 1870s bulb (Goebel Lamp No. 4) had been built much later. Professor van der Weyde, an 80 years old physicist, said in his affidavit, he had seen Goebel&#x27;s telescope and his incandescent lamps. Later he withdrew his affidavit. Witter &amp; Kenyon expressed suspicions of bribery of witnesses. The newspapers reported about some turbulent phases in these lawsuits during the year 1893.

Judge Colt (&quot;Edison Electric Light Co.&quot; vs. &quot;Beacon Vacuum Pump and Electrical Company, Boston&quot;) explained how he ruled based on probabilities:

The opinion of Judge Hallett in the case &quot;Edison Electric Light Co.&quot; vs. &quot;Columbia Incandescent Lamp Co., St. Louis&quot;:
The opinion of Judge Seaman in the case &quot;Edison Electric Light Co.&quot; vs. &quot;Electric Manufacturing Co., Milwaukee&quot;:

The opinion of Judge Jenkins in the case &quot;Electric Manufacturing Co. vs. &quot;Edison Electric Light Co.&quot;, appeal, Chicago&quot; was based on the last development of the &quot;Goebel-Defense&quot; with new affidavits and withdrawn affidavits in May, 1894:


A decision, whether the Goebel anticipation was held true or untrue, required a final hearing, but there was never a final hearing in the litigations using the &quot;Goebel-Defense&quot;. It was the responsibility of the &quot;Edison Electric Light Co.&quot; to move the case in St. Louis to a final hearing. Probably they did it not because of the expiry date of Edison&#x27;s patent in 1894 and high cost.

It is not sure, that the proof of the alleged anticipation was the true strategy of the counsels of the defense. Perhaps the aim of the extensive &quot;Goebel-Defense&quot; was to avoid a decision of a final hearing before the expiry date of Edison&#x27;s patent. This was successful in the case of the &quot;Columbia Incandescent Lamp Co&quot;. The company produced lamps without interruption though they never proved the invalidity of Edison&#x27;s patent.

In two cases the preliminary injunction was granted, in one case the injunction was denied. In Philadelphia another injunction was granted in a suit filed by the &quot;Edison Electric Light Co.&quot; to stop the usage of patent infringing lamps at some companies. The counsels of the defense in this case used the arguments of the &quot;Goebel-Defense&quot;. The judges referred to the previous decisions. They did not form their own opinion about the Goebel claim of anticipation.

The point of controversy in these lawsuits between the &quot;Edison Electric Light Co.&quot; and their competitors was money. It was not a controversy about the honor to be the inventor of the incandescent light bulb. There was no benefit for Henry Goebel in these suits. He said, he was not interested in the decisions of the courts and that he had no hostile mind towards Thomas Edison. In an affidavit he said he got no money for providing details of his work concerning incandescent lamps.

The claim of the &quot;Goebel Defense&quot; fulfilled the legal requirements for challenging the Edison patent without having to assert any influence or effect of the alleged invention outside the private sphere of Goebel. An invention with merit of technical progress for the benefit of the general public, however, was not claimed.

=== Historical extrajudicial investigations and views on the anticipation claim ===
During the litigations most newspapers reported with a neutral point of view, but some raised doubts about the alleged Goebel anticipation.

&quot;A romantic story of the poor inventor Goebel which will be forgotten soon&quot; was the commentary of a technical magazine in Germany.

The journalist Tanner from London visited Springe, Göbel&#x27;s native town, and interviewed some people there. In his article published in &quot;The Electrical Review&quot; in February 1894 he wrote, that nobody had confirmed the alleged work of Göbel related to electricity before leaving Germany. Tanner reported that Göbel&#x27;s alleged teacher in the field of electricity and electric lamps, Professor Münchhausen, was an unknown person in Springe and Hanover. Göbel said in one of his affidavits that he had learned the professions of a watchmaker and an optician. In Springe Tanner got the information, that Göbel had learned the profession of a locksmith.

=== Investigations in recent years ===
Investigations in recent years partially corroborated the findings in the article by Tanner.

One important point is, that there is no source to confirm Goebel&#x27;s alleged source of knowledge in the fields of electricity and vacuum physics. Goebel claimed that he had worked together with a certain Professor Münchhausen in the 1840s, that he had constructed equipment for experiments at today&#x27;s Leibniz University Hannover (at that time called ), that he had assisted experiments related to electric light, that he had got the idea and the basic concept of the design of an electric incandescent lamp from Professor Münchhausen and that he had continued with experiments on electric light on his own in New York. A person Professor Münchhausen was not known in the Kingdom of Hanover in the 1830s and 1840s, there is no documentation of experiments on electric light in the Kingdom of Hanover in the 1840s and no source for deliveries of equipment or any other kind of relation of Henry Goebel to today&#x27;s Leibniz University Hannover.

As one result of investigations in Germany and in the US and an analysis of all documents of the litigations with &quot;Goebel-Defense&quot; Hans-Christian Rohde stated in his dissertation, that there is no source from the time prior to 1880 to support the assumption of a relation of Henry Goebel to incandescent lamps prior to 1880. His thesis is, that Henry Goebel got the knowledge when working for the &quot;American Electric Light Co.&quot; in 1881 and was not busy with incandescent lamps before.

A philological analysis of all affidavits of the &quot;Goebel-Defense&quot; manifested numerous contradictions and improbabilities. This and the lack of independent sources in the archives to confirm claims of Henry Goebel support the thesis, the &quot;Goebel-Defense&quot; was fraudulent. Probably Goebel told his story in 1882 to present himself as experienced in the art of construction of electric lamps to promote his intended business. Patent attorneys and their technical consultants created the &quot;Goebel-Defense&quot; on base of this story. Probably a biography of an inventor of electric light was constructed on top of the true biography of Henry Goebel. There is circumstantial evidence that falsification of written affidavits was part of the strategy of the counsels of the defense.

One curious matter is the name of Goebel&#x27;s alleged teacher, Professor Münchhausen. Münchhausen is a rare family name in Germany and Münchhausen is the name of a literary figure in a collection of tales with title &quot;&quot; of Rudolf Erich Raspe (published 1785) and in another version of Gottfried August Bürger (published 1786), a popular book in Germany; a man telling lies and incredible stories. A thesis on this is, that Henry Goebel, an old man, was under pressure of lawyers to provide affidavits and got pangs of conscience and this was his way to indicate the story was untrue. In the culture of Germany there is a close association of &quot;Münchhausen&quot; and &quot;untrue, telling lies&quot;.

So-called &quot;Goebel Original Lamps&quot; are in the archives of the Henry Ford Museum, Dearborn. A technical examination with today&#x27;s methods of science to establish, if possible, a final truth on the production year of the lamps and to clear up technical points of dispute in the litigations did not take place yet.

== The &quot;Göbel-Legend&quot; ==
Franklin Leonard Pope was a close friend of Thomas Alva Edison but later he was in quarrel with him.

He was an important man with a good reputation in the field of electricity; in 1886 he was the President of the &quot;American Institute of Electrical Engineers&quot;.

In January 1893 Franklin Pope wrote an article published on the head page of the &quot;Electrical Engineer&quot; titled &quot;The Carbon Filament Lamp of 1859—The Story of an Overlooked Invention.&quot; In this article Franklin Pope credited the invention of the practical incandescent light bulb to Henry Goebel. Furthermore, he supported the &quot;Goebel-Defense&quot; at court providing affidavits.

Probably his relationship to Thomas Edison was the motivation of Franklin Pope.

The reputation of Franklin Pope and his article in &quot;The Electrical Engineer&quot; is the reason for the existing view in some countries that Henry Goebel developed a carbon filament lamp many years before Thomas Edison did it. &quot;The Electrical Engineer&quot; is available in the libraries of many technical universities. Franklin Pope&#x27;s article was interpreted as a reliable source as well in the year of publishing as in later years. In 1893 his article was the source for reports about the Goebel-Story of newspapers in the US and in Europe.

As a matter of fact there is a lack of convincing evidence for the information about the lamps of Henry Goebel given by Franklin Pope in his article. This was the result of the litigations (motions for a preliminary injunction) in three cases in 1893 and 1894.

In a dissertation published 2007 it is stated, that the article was part of the fraudulent &quot;Goebel-Defense&quot; and the intention was to produce credibility for the Goebel-Story and sympathy for Henry Goebel, an &quot;underdog&quot; who anticipated the famous Thomas Edison. According to this view, Franklin Pope was a fraudulent acting consultant of the &quot;Goebel Defense&quot;.

Franklin Pope wrote a book titled &quot;Evolution of the Electric Incandescent Lamp&quot;. In the 2nd Edition of this book, published 1894 one year after his article about Henry Goebel in the &quot;Electrical Engineer&quot; of January 1893, Henry Goebel is not mentioned.

In the case &quot;Edison Electric Light Co.&quot; vs. &quot;Columbia Incandescent Lamp Co.&quot; Judge Moses Hallett denied the granting of a preliminary injunction. His opinion was, that a final hearing with all witnesses at court was necessary. Several magazines and newspapers stated that Judge Hallett believed Goebel&#x27;s lamp preceded Edison&#x27;s. In Germany the opinion of Judge Hallett was reported to be a final decision in the case. Sometimes it wasn&#x27;t realized that the litigations were three independent cases with the same counsels of the defense using the same arguments. Due to this erroneous view the later decision of Judge Hallett was reported as a decision of a higher court in the same case. That are misstatements of Judge Hallett&#x27;s decision, and the source of the legend that the priority of Henry Goebel for the invention of the practical incandescent light bulb was established at court.

After his death, Henry Goebel had been forgotten for 30 years in Germany. In the year 1923 the story of an important national inventor was created; the report of Franklin Pope was the main source. Some other countries adapted the story from Germany in the 20th century. Additional misstatements became part of some versions of the legend. For example, some versions of the legend describe the first Goebel lamps as bottle-lamps. But Henry Goebel said that he had melted the glass of Eau-de-Cologne-Bottles with a blowpipe to produce the all-glass-envelope of his very first lamps in the 1850s.

Different views became obvious due to the internet and some projects in the US and in Germany started investigations in the year 2000 and later. As a result, the assumption of Goebel lamps prior to 1880 without any doubt was named a legend.

<doc id="349523" wikidata="Q309722" url="?curid=349523" title="Louis Auguste Blanqui">
<text>Louis Auguste Blanqui (; 8 February 1805 – 1 January 1881) was a French socialist, political philosopher and political activist, notable for his revolutionary theory of Blanquism.

== Biography ==
=== Early life, political activity and first imprisonment (1805–1848) ===
Blanqui was born in Puget-Théniers, Alpes-Maritimes, where his father, Jean Dominique Blanqui, of Italian descent, was subprefect. He was the younger brother of the liberal economist Jérôme-Adolphe Blanqui. He studied both law and medicine, but found his real vocation in politics, and quickly became a champion of the most advanced opinions. A member of the Carbonari society since 1824, he took an active part in most republican conspiracies during this period. In 1827, under the reign of Charles X (1824–1830), he participated in a street fight in Rue Saint-Denis, during which he was seriously injured. In 1829, he joined Pierre Leroux&#x27;s &quot;Globe&quot; newspaper before taking part in the July Revolution of 1830. He then joined the &quot;Amis du Peuple&quot; (&quot;Friends of the People&quot;) society, where he made acquaintances with Philippe Buonarroti, Raspail, and Armand Barbès. He was condemned to repeated terms of imprisonment for maintaining the doctrine of republicanism during the reign of Louis Philippe (1830–1848). During the 1832 trial of the &quot;Amis du People&quot; at the cour d&#x27;assis in Paris Blanqui declared, &quot;You have confiscated the rifles of July--yes. But the bullets have been fired. Every bullet of the workers of Paris is on its way round the world.&quot; In May 1839, a Blanquist inspired uprising took place in Paris, in which the League of the Just, forerunners of Karl Marx&#x27;s Communist League, participated.

Implicated in the armed outbreak of the Société des Saisons, of which he was a leading member, Blanqui was condemned to death on 14 January 1840, a sentence later commuted to life imprisonment.

=== Release, revolutions and further imprisonment (1848–1879) ===
He was released during the revolution of 1848, only to resume his attacks on existing institutions. The revolution had not satisfied him. The violence of the &quot;Société républicaine centrale&quot;, which was founded by Blanqui to demand a change of government, brought him into conflict with the more moderate Republicans, and in 1849 he was sentenced to ten years&#x27; imprisonment. While in prison, he sent a brief address (written in the Prison of Belle-Ile-en-Mer, 10 February 1851) to a committee of social democrats in London. The text of the address was noted and introduced by Karl Marx.

In 1865, while serving a further term of imprisonment under the Empire, he escaped, and continued his propaganda campaign against the government from abroad, until the general amnesty of 1869 enabled him to return to France. Blanqui&#x27;s predilection for violence was illustrated in 1870 by two unsuccessful armed demonstrations: one on 12 January at the funeral of Victor Noir, the journalist shot by Pierre Bonaparte; the other on 14 August, when he led an attempt to seize some guns from a barracks. Upon the fall of the Empire, through the revolution of 4 September, Blanqui established the club and journal &quot;La patrie en danger&quot;.
He was one of the group that briefly seized the reins of power on 31 October and for his share in that outbreak he was again condemned to death &quot;in absentia&quot; on 9 March of the following year. On 17 March, Adolphe Thiers, aware of the threat represented by Blanqui, took advantage of his resting at a friend physician&#x27;s place, in Bretenoux in Lot, and had him arrested. A few days afterwards the insurrection which established the Paris Commune broke out, and Blanqui was elected president of the insurgent commune. The Communards offered to release all of their prisoners if the Thiers government released Blanqui, but their offer was met with refusal, and Blanqui was thus prevented from taking an active part. Karl Marx would later be convinced that Blanqui was the leader that was missed by the Commune. Nevertheless, in 1872 he was condemned along with the other members of the Commune to transportation; on account of his broken health this sentence was again commuted to one of imprisonment. On 20 April 1879 he was elected a deputy for Bordeaux; although the election was pronounced invalid, Blanqui was freed, and immediately resumed his work of agitation.
=== Ideology ===

As a socialist, Blanqui favored what he described as a just redistribution of wealth. However, Blanquism is distinguished in various ways from other socialist currents of the day. On one side, contrary to Karl Marx, Blanqui did not believe in the preponderant role of the working class, nor in popular movements: he thought, on the contrary, that the revolution should be carried out by a small group, who would establish a temporary dictatorship by force. This period of transitional tyranny would permit the implementation of the basis of a new order, after which power would be handed to the people. In another respect, Blanqui was more concerned with the revolution itself than with the future society that would result from it: if his thought was based on precise socialist principles, it rarely goes so far as to imagine a society purely and really socialist. In this he differs from the utopian socialists. For the Blanquists, the overturning of the bourgeois social order and the revolution are ends sufficient in themselves, at least for their immediate purposes. He was one of the non-Marxist socialists of his day.

=== Death ===

Following a speech at a political meeting in Paris, Blanqui had a stroke. He died on 1 January 1881 and was interred in the Père Lachaise Cemetery. His elaborate tomb was created by Jules Dalou.

== Legacy ==
Blanqui&#x27;s uncompromising radicalism, and his determination to enforce it by violence, brought him into conflict with every French government during his lifetime, and as a consequence, he spent half of his life in prison. Besides his innumerable contributions to journalism, he published a work entitled, &quot;L&#x27;Eternité par les astres&quot; (1872), where he espoused his views concerning eternal return. After his death his writings on economic and social questions were collected under the title of &quot;Critique sociale&quot; (1885).

The Italian fascist newspaper &quot;Il Popolo d&#x27;Italia&quot;, founded and edited by Benito Mussolini, had a quotation by Blanqui on its mast: &quot;Chi ha del ferro ha del pane&quot; (&quot;He who has iron has bread&quot;).

Blanqui&#x27;s political activism and his book &quot;L&#x27;Eternité par les astres&quot; were commented on by Walter Benjamin in his Arcades Project and are referred to in the novel &quot;The Secret Knowledge&quot; by Andrew Crumey.

<text>Pandoro () is an Italian sweet bread, most popular around Christmas and New Year. Typically a product of the city of Verona, Veneto, &quot;pandoro&quot; traditionally has an eight-pointed shape. It is often dusted with vanilla scented icing sugar, which is said to resemble the snowy peaks of the Alps during Christmas.

Its name and origins are attributed to the Italian pastry chef Domenico Melegatti.

==History==

&quot;Pandoro&quot; appeared in remote times, the product of breadmaking, as the name, &quot;pan d&#x27;oro&quot; (), suggests. Throughout the Middle Ages, white bread was consumed solely by the rich, while the common people ate black bread. Sweet breads were reserved for the nobility. Bread enriched with eggs, butter, and sugar or honey as a sweetener were served in their palaces and known as &quot;royal bread&quot; or &quot;golden bread&quot;.

17th century desserts were described in the book &quot;Suor Celeste Galilei, Letters to Her Father&quot;, published by La Rosa of Turin, and included &quot;royal bread&quot; made from flour, sugar, butter and eggs.

The first citation of a dessert clearly identified as &quot;pandoro&quot; dates to the 18th century. The dessert certainly figured in the cuisine of the Venetian aristocracy. Venice was the principal market for spices as late as the 18th century, as well as for the sugar that by then had replaced honey in European pastries and bread made from leavened dough. It was at Verona, in Venetian territory, that the formula for making &quot;pandoro&quot; was developed and perfected, a process that required a century. The modern history of this dessert bread began there on October 30, 1894, when Domenico Melegatti obtained a patent for a procedure to be applied in producing &quot;pandoro&quot; industrially. Melegatti formed a &quot;pandoro&quot; company in 1896, which survived a bankruptcy crisis in 2017.

<text>Nicolas Anne Theodule Changarnier (; 26 April 1793 – 14 February 1877), French general, was born at Autun, Saône-et-Loire.

Educated at Saint-Cyr, he served for a short time in the bodyguard of Louis XVIII, and entered the line as a lieutenant in January 1815. He achieved distinction in the Spanish campaign of 1823, and became captain in 1825. In 1830 he entered the Royal Guard and was sent to North Africa, where he took part in the Mascara expedition. Promoted commandant in 1835, he distinguished himself under Marshal Clauzel in the campaign against Ahmed Pasha, bey of Constantine, and became lieutenant-colonel in 1837. The part he took in the, expedition of Portes-de-Fer gained him a colonelcy, and his success against the Hajutas and Kabyles, the cross of the Legion of Honour.

Three more years of brilliant service in Africa won for him the rank of &quot;marechal de camp&quot; in 1840, and of lieutenant-general in 1843. In 1847 he held the Algiers divisional command. He visited France early in 1848, assisted the provisional government to establish order, and returned to Africa in May to succeed General Cavaignac in the government of French Algeria. He was speedily recalled on his election to the general assembly for the Seine &quot;département&quot;, and received the command of the National Guard of Paris, to which was added soon afterwards that of the troops in Paris, altogether nearly 100,000 men. He held a high place and exercised great influence in the complicated politics of the next two years (for much more on Changarnier&#x27;s activities during this time, see Karl Marx&#x27;s &quot;Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte&quot;).

Changarnier ran for president in the election of 1848, but came in dead last, with less than 1 percent of the vote.
In 1849 Changarnier received the grand cross of the Legion of Honour. An avowed enemy of republican institutions, he held a unique position in upholding the power of the president; but in January 1851 he opposed Louis Napoleon&#x27;s policy, was in consequence deprived of his double command, and at the &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; in December was arrested and sent to Mazas, until his banishment from France by the decree of January 9, 1852.

Changarnier returned to France after the general amnesty, and resided in his estate in the department of Saône-et-Loire. At the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 he held no command, but was present with the headquarters, and afterwards with Bazaine in Metz. He was employed on an unsuccessful mission to Prince Frederick Charles, commanding the German army which besieged Metz, and on the capitulation became a prisoner of war. At the armistice he returned to Paris, and in 1871 was elected to the National Assembly by four departments, and sat for the Somme. He took an active part in politics, defended the conduct of Marshal Bazaine, and served on the committee which elaborated the monarchical constitution. When the comte de Chambord refused the compromise, he moved the resolution to extend the executive power for ten years to Marshal MacMahon. He was elected a life senator in 1875.

<text>Louis-Mathieu, comte Molé (; 24 January 1781 – 23 November 1855) was a French statesman and a close friend and associate of Louis Philippe I, King of the French during the July Monarchy (1830–1848).

==Biography==
Molé was born in Paris. His father, a president of the parlement of Paris, who came of the family of the famous president noted below, was guillotined during the Terror. Count Molé&#x27;s early days were spent in Switzerland and in England with his mother, a relative of Lamoignon-Malesherbes.

On his return to France, he studied at the Ecole Centrale des Travaux Publics, and his social education was accomplished in the salon of Pauline de Beaumont, the friend of Châteaubriand and Joubert. A volume of &quot;Essais de morale et de politique&quot; introduced him to the notice of Napoleon, who attached him to the staff of the council of state. He became master of requests in 1806, and next year prefect of the Côte-d&#x27;Or, Councillor of State and Director-General of Bridges and Roads in 1809, and Count of the Empire in the autumn of the same year.

He served as Napoleon&#x27;s advisor on Jewish affairs and was heavily involved with Napoleon&#x27;s gathering of a Jewish Grand Sanhedrin in 1807. Mole initially did not support Jewish emancipation, though he seems to have moderated his position over the course of his involvement with the Sanhedrin and particularly Abraham Furtado.

In November 1813, he became Minister of Justice. Although he resumed his functions as Director-General during the Hundred Days, he excused himself from taking his seat in the Council of State and was apparently not seriously compromised, for Louis XVIII confirmed his appointment as Director-General and made him a peer of France. Molé supported the policy of the duc de Richelieu, who in 1817 entrusted to him the direction of the Ministry of Marine, which he held until December 1818.

From that time, he belonged to the moderate opposition, and he accepted the result of the revolution of 1830 without enthusiasm. He was Minister of Foreign Affairs in the first cabinet of Louis Philippe&#x27;s reign, and was confronted with the task of reconciling the European powers to the change of government. The real direction of foreign affairs, however, lay less in his hands than in those of Talleyrand, who had gone to London as the ambassador of the new king.

After a few months in office, Molé retired, and it was not until 1836 that the fall of Thiers led to his becoming Prime Minister of a new government, in which he held the portfolio of foreign affairs. One of his first actions was the release of the ex-ministers of Charles X, and he had to deal with the disputes with Switzerland and with the Strasburg coup of Louis-Napoléon. He withdrew the French garrison from Ancona, but pursued an active policy in Mexico and in Algeria.

Personal and political differences rapidly arose between Molé and his chief colleague, Guizot, and led to an open rupture in March 1837 in face of the general opposition to a grant to the duc de Nemours. After some attempts to secure a new combination, Molé reconstructed his ministry in April, Guizot being excluded. The general election in the autumn gave him no fresh support in the Chamber of Deputies, while he had now to face a formidable coalition between Guizot, the Left Centre under Thiers, and politicians of the Dynastic Left and the Republican Left. Molé, supported by Louis Philippe, held his ground against the general hostility until the beginning of 1839, when, after acrid discussions on the address, the chamber was dissolved. The new house showed little change in the strength of parties, but Molé resigned on 31 March 1839.

A year later he was elected to the Académie française, and though he continued to speak frequently, he took no important share in party politics. Louis Philippe sought his help in his vain efforts to form a ministry in February 1848. After the revolution, he was deputy for the Gironde to the Constituent Assembly, and in 1849 to the Legislative Assembly, where he was one of the leaders of the Right until the coup d&#x27;état on 2 December 1851 drove him from public life.

He died in the family home at in Épinay (Seine-et-Oise) on 23 November 1855 and was buried in the little church of the village.

<text>Wrexham ( ; ) is a city and the administrative centre of Wrexham County Borough in Wales, between the Welsh mountains and the lower Dee Valley, near the border with Cheshire in England. Historically in the county of Denbighshire, and later the county of Clwyd in 1974, it has been the principal settlement of Wrexham County Borough since 1996.

Wrexham has historically been one of the primary settlements of Wales. At the 2021 Census, it had an urban population of 44,785. The core of the city comprises the local government communities of Acton, Caia Park, Offa and Rhosddu. In the 2011 census, Wrexham&#x27;s built-up area was determined to extend further into villages like Brymbo, Brynteg, Gwersyllt, New Broughton and Pentre Broughton with a population of 61,603, while also including nearby Bradley and Rhostyllen for a population of 65,692 in 2011.

Wrexham was likely founded before the 11th century and developed in the Middle Ages as a regional centre for trade and administration. The city became the most populous settlement in Wales in the 17th century and was at the forefront of the Industrial Revolution from the 18th century. Prior to de-industrialisation in the 20th century, the city and surrounding area were a hub of coal and lead mining; the production of iron, steel and leather; and brewing.

Wrexham serves north Wales and the Welsh borderlands as a centre for manufacturing, retail, education and administration. The city is noted for Wrexham A.F.C. (one of the oldest professional football teams in the world); the nationally significant industrial heritage of the Clywedog Valley; the National Trust Property of Erddig; and the fine Tudor church of St Giles, which towers over the historic Wrexham city centre.

==History==

=== Early history ===

Human activity in the Wrexham area dates back to the Mesolithic period (8000 to 4300 BC), with tools made from flint being found to the east of the city. Two Bronze Age burial mounds are located to the west of the modern city centre and there is evidence that the area had developed into a centre for an innovative metalworking industry by the early Middle Bronze Age. A series of Iron Age hill-forts is located to the west of present-day Wrexham along the upland-lowland line suggesting the presence of an ancient tribal boundary.

At the time of the Roman conquest of Britain, the area which Wrexham formed part of was held by a Celtic tribe called the Cornovii. A Roman civilian settlement was located in the Plas Coch area of Wrexham and excavations have revealed evidence of agriculture and trade with the wider Roman world. Following the end of Roman rule in Britain, Wrexham formed part of the Romano-British Kingdom of Powys.

=== Medieval ===
The Battle of Chester circa 615/616 marked the beginning of a long struggle between the Welsh and English for territory in this part of Wales. During the eighth century, the Anglo-Saxon royal house of Mercia pushed their frontiers westwards and established the earth boundaries of Wat&#x27;s Dyke and Offa&#x27;s Dyke to the west of the present city.

It was probably during this first period of Mercian advance in the eighth century that the settlement of Wrexham was founded on the flat ground above the meadows of the River Gwenfro. The name Wrexham probably comes from the old English for Wryhtel&#x27;s river meadow. Alternatively, the name may have described a settlement of the Wreocensæte people, who were possibly a continuation of the Cornovii tribe of Roman Britain. The settlement may have originally been named &#x27;Caer Fantell&#x27; in Welsh but by the 13th century was recorded in Welsh as &#x27;Gwrexham&#x27; or &#x27;Gregsam&#x27;.

The Mercians fought over north-east Wales during the eighth to tenth centuries but the Welsh Kings of Powys re-conquered the Wrexham area during the 11th century. Following the Welsh reconquest, Wrexham formed an integral part of the Powys lordship of Maelor and so does not appear in the Domesday Book of 1086. The first recorded reference to the town in 1161 is to a castle at &#x27;Wristlesham&#x27;.

Stability under the princes of Powys Fadog enabled Wrexham to develop as a trading town and administrative centre of one of the two commotes making up the Lordship. In 1202, Madoc ap Gruffydd Maelor, Lord of Dinas Brân, granted some of his demesne lands in &#x27;Wrechcessham&#x27; to the abbey of Valle Crucis and in 1220 the earliest reference to a church in Wrexham is made.

Following the loss of Welsh independence and the death in battle of Prince Llywelyn ap Gruffudd in 1282, Wrexham became part of the semi-independent Marcher lordship of Bromfield and Yale. Wrexham increased in importance throughout the Middle Ages as the lordship&#x27;s administrative centre, and the then town&#x27;s position made it a suitable centre for the exchange of the produce of the Dee valley and Denbighshire uplands, whilst iron and lead were also mined locally.

From 1327 onwards, the town is referred to as a &quot;villa mercatoria&quot; (market town) and became a celebrated centre for Welsh craftsmen. The town was particularly well known in the 14th and 15th centuries for the manufacture of Welsh bucklers, as illustrated by the mention in the 1547 Inventory of King Henry VIII of &#x27;wreckesham Buckelers&#x27;. In 1391 Wrexham was wealthy enough for a bard, jester, juggler, dancer and goldsmith to earn their living there. 
The traditional pattern of Welsh life – law, administration, customs and language – remained undisturbed through the Middle Ages and the pattern was for local English people to rapidly adopt the Welsh-language and to be assimilated into Welsh culture, even to point of adopting Welsh Patronymic surnames.

The local Welsh nobility and peasantry backed the uprising led by Owain Glyndŵr against King Henry IV of England during the early 15th century. Local poet Guto&#x27;r Glyn (c. 1412 – c. 1493) heralded Siôn ap Madog, the great-nephew of Owain Glyndŵr, as &#x27;&quot;Alecsander i Wrecsam&quot;&#x27; (&quot;an Alexander for Wrexham&quot;) and the poet Hywel Dafi addresses Siôn&#x27;s heir as &#x27;&quot;Gwregys am ais Gwregsam wyt&quot;&#x27; (&#x27;a girdle around the heart of Wrexham.’).
=== Early Modern ===
The Acts of Union passed during the reign of Henry VIII brought the lordship into the full system of English administration and law. It became part of the new shire of Denbighshire in 1536.

In 1584 St Richard Gwyn, a local Recusant, schoolteacher, and poet in the Welsh-language, was convicted of high treason based on his Catholic beliefs by a panel of judges headed by the Chief Justice of Chester, Sir George Bromley. On 15 October 1584, Gwyn was taken to the Beast Market and hung, drawn and quartered for his faith. He was canonised by Pope Paul VI in 1970 as one of the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales. His Feast Day is 17 October.
The main body of the church of St Giles was rebuilt in the late 15th and early 16th centuries to become one of the finest examples of ecclesiastical architecture in Wales.

The economic character remained predominantly as an agricultural market town into the 17th century but there were workshops of weavers, smiths, nailers as well as dye houses. The 1620 Norden&#x27;s jury of survey of Wrexham Regis stated that four-fifths of the land-holding classes of Wrexham bore Welsh names and every field except one within the manor bore a Welsh or semi-Welsh name.

A grammar school was established in 1603 by Alderman Valentine Broughton of Chester.

During the English Civil War, most of the local Welsh gentry supported King Charles I and in 1642 the King addressed enthusiastic crowds in the town. However, local landlord Sir Thomas Myddelton declared for the Rump Parliament and Parliamentarians occupied the town in 1643 and 1645. Wrexham served as military headquarters for both forces and a quarter of houses were burned down in 1643 during the quartering of troops in the town.

In the 17th century, Wrexham served as an educational and cultural focal point for local society and became a &#x27;Puritan Metropolis&#x27;. Morgan Llwyd, the radical nonconformist preacher and writer, was educated at the Wrexham Grammar School and became Vicar of Wrexham in 1645.

=== Late Modern ===

Wrexham was known for its leather industry and by the 18th century there were a number of skinners and tanners in the town. 

The Industrial Revolution began in Wrexham in 1762 when the entrepreneur John Wilkinson (1728–1808), known as &quot;Iron Mad Wilkinson&quot;, opened Bersham Ironworks. Wilkinson&#x27;s steam engines enabled a peak of production at Minera Lead Mines on the outskirts of Wrexham.

From the late 18th century numerous large-scale industrialised collieries operated in the southern section of the North East Wales coalfield, alongside hundreds of more traditional small-scale pits belonging to a mining tradition dating back to the Middle Ages.

18th century literary visitors included Samuel Johnson, who described Wrexham as &quot;a busy, extensive and well-built town&quot;, and Daniel Defoe who noted the role of Wrexham as a &quot;great market for Welch flannel&quot;. The artist J. M. W. Turner also visited the town in 1792-93 and 1794 which resulted in his drawings of St Giles Parish Church and surrounding buildings and a watercolour painting of a street scene.
Rev. William Bingley described Wrexham in 1839 as &quot;of such size and consequence as to have occasionally obtained the appellation of the metropolis of North Wales&quot;. Wrexham gained its first newspaper in 1848. The Market Hall was built in 1848, and in 1863 a volunteer fire brigade was founded. In addition to brewing, tanning became one of Wrexham&#x27;s main industries. In the mid 19th century Wrexham was granted borough status.

By 1851, the population of Wrexham was 6,714; within thirty years this had increased to 10,978 as the town became increasingly industrialised.

Wrexham benefited from good underground water supplies which were essential to the brewing of beer: by the mid-19th century, there were 19 breweries in and around the town. Wrexham Lager brewery was established in 1882 in Central Road and became the first brewery in the United Kingdom to produce lager beer. A permanent military presence was established in the town with the completion of Hightown Barracks in 1877. The Poyser Street drill hall was completed in 1902.

When the 1912 National Eisteddfod of Wales was held at Wrexham, T.H. Parry-Williams achieved for the first time the feat, almost unheard of since, of winning both the Chair and the Crown. Parry-Williams later recalled returning home to Rhyd-ddu, where he had been working as a hired hand upon the farm of a relative. Upon telling his employer of his double-victory, Parry-Williams was advised to, &quot;seek grace.&quot; When Parry-Williams then explained that both victories had gained him £40, the relative shouted in angry disbelief, &quot;Ac mi gwnest nhw i gyd ar dy din!!!&quot; (&quot;And you earned them all sitting on your arse!!!!&quot;)

By 1913, the North East Wales coal field was producing up to 3 million tonnes a year and employed over 10,000 people, dominating the economic and cultural life of the area. One of the worst mining disasters in British history occurred at Gresford Colliery in 1934 when underground explosions and a subsequent fire cost the lives of 266 men. However the industry went into decline after the First World War, and of the seven large-scale collieries operating in the Wrexham area in 1946, only two functional collieries remained by 1968. The last pit to close in the Borough was Bersham Colliery in 1986.The leatherworks in Pentrefelin and Tuttle Street, the many coal mines in the area, the brickworks in Abenbury, Brymbo Steelworks and the breweries all closed in the latter half of the 20th century. Wrexham suffered from the same problems as much of industrialised Britain and saw little investment in the 1970s.

In the 1980s and 1990s, the Welsh Development Agency (WDA) funded a major dual carriageway (the A483) bypassing Wrexham town centre and connecting it with nearby Chester and with England&#x27;s trunk road network. New shopping areas have been created within the town at Henblas Square, Island Green and Eagles Meadow and the Wrexham Industrial Estate, previously used in the Second World War, has become home to many manufacturing businesses.

Wrexham Town Hall, an early 18th century arcaded structure with an assembly hall on the first floor, which had been built at the top of Town Hall, was demolished to improve traffic flows in the area in February 1940.

Wrexham&#x27;s former police station on Regent Street, originally the barracks for the Royal Denbighshire Militia, is now home to Wrexham County Borough Museum. The museum has two galleries devoted to the history of the city and its surrounding communities. The museum also holds the archive of the Royal Welch Fusiliers; battalions were stationed in Wrexham during the First World War. The collection is notable for containing original documents in the handwriting of Siegfried Sassoon, Robert Graves, J. C. Dunn and other notable members of the RWF, as well as official records. The local police was housed in the high-rise Wrexham Police Station from 1973 to 2019, with the building demolished the following year. The police moved to a smaller facility next to Wrexham Library.

==Governance==
Wrexham County Borough Council is made up of 56 Councillors, with one then appointed to serve as Mayor for a year. The most recent election to the council was on 5 May 2022, the election resulted in a Independent Group–Conservative coalition, as well as various ward changes and the addition of 4 new councillor seats from the 2022 election. The main contiguous part of the city of Wrexham, east of the A483 dual carriageway, is divided into the communities of Acton, Rhosddu, Offa and Caia Park. Although other definitions of the city, may consider Wrexham to extend westwards into other communities such as Gwersyllt and New Broughton which are part of Wrexham&#x27;s built-up area.

The Wrexham constituency elects members to the UK Parliament and the Senedd. The constituency includes both the city and some of its outlying villages such as Gwersyllt, Llay, Marford, Rossett and Holt. The UK Parliament constituency of Wrexham was considered a safe seat for the Labour Party until 2019. At the 2019 general election, Wrexham elected Sarah Atherton MP to the House of Commons, the first Conservative Member of Parliament for the constituency, who was however defeated at the 2024 election when Andrew Ranger won it back for Labour. Lesley Griffiths MS, Welsh Labour, has represented the Wrexham constituency in the Senedd since 2007 and has held a number of cabinet positions in the Welsh Government.

===Public services===
Wrexham Maelor Hospital () is the region&#x27;s major acute district hospital, with over 900 beds, and is the largest of the three core hospitals in North Wales. The other NHS hospital within the county borough is Chirk Community Hospital and a former Penley Polish Hospital.

Yale Hospital (), situated close to the Maelor Hospital on the Wrexham Technology Park, is Wrexham&#x27;s largest private hospital with over 25 beds. Formerly &quot;BUPA Yale Hospital&quot;, it is now owned and operated by Spire Healthcare.

Wrexham is served by North Wales Police; their Eastern Division HQ has a large HQ building in Llay and a police station in the city centre. The police were formerly based at the Wrexham Police Station from 1973 to 2019, with the building being demolished in 2020.

The region&#x27;s main fire station is situated on Croesnewydd Road and is part of the newly combined Ambulance Service station. Other local fire stations are located in the nearby towns of Chirk and Llangollen.

===City status===
Wrexham has applied for city status three times since the turn of the 21st century, in competitions to mark the new Millennium, and for both the Queen&#x27;s Golden and Diamond Jubilees. In March 2012, it was announced that Wrexham had again missed out on city status as the community of St Asaph, which was previously a city, was granted city status. In 2021, the Wrexham council announced their intention to apply for a fourth time for the Queen&#x27;s Platinum Jubilee award.

On 20 May 2022, it was announced that as part of the Platinum Jubilee Civic Honours, Wrexham would receive city status. The status was confirmed by Letters Patent on 1 September 2022. It became Wales&#x27; seventh city.

==Geography==
Wrexham is not built on a major river, but on a relatively flat plateau between the lower Dee Valley and easternmost mountains of north-east Wales. This position enabled it to grow as a market town, as a crossroads between England and Wales, and later as an industrial hub – due to its rich natural reserves of iron ore and coal. But three small rivers flow through parts of the city: the Clywedog, Gwenfro and Alyn. Wrexham is also famed for the quality of its underground water reserves, which gave rise to its previous dominance as a major brewing centre.

Originally a market town with surrounding urban villages, Wrexham has now coalesced with a number of urban villages and forms North Wales&#x27; largest city. Including adjacent urban areas to Wrexham, such as that of the Gwersyllt, Rhosllanerchrugog, Coedpoeth and Llay totals to a population of over 100,000 residents.

In 2021, the urban population was 44,785. In the previous census in 2011, Wrexham&#x27;s built-up area also included settlements to the west, which increased the population to between 61,603 and 65,692 in 2011. Wrexham was home to approximately 40% of the total population of the county borough in 2007.

Wrexham is approximately south of Chester, north-west of Shrewsbury, south-west of Manchester, and north of Cardiff.

== Landmarks and attractions ==

=== City centre ===

The historic city centre contains a large number of listed buildings set on a medieval street pattern radiating out from the Parish Church of St Giles which was the focal point around which the city developed. The church precinct, and the surrounding narrow enclosed streets and alleyways retain a medieval character. Several complete medieval buildings survive on Town Hill and Church Street.

Hope Street, Regent Street and Queen Street form the traditional main shopping streets and are wider in some parts than others, resulting from the location of the street markets, which occurred from medieval times through to the 19th century. The shopping streets and indoor markets are interconnected by historic narrow alleyways and arcades, such as Bank Street and Central Arcade, which host small independent businesses. The half-timbered Talbot Hotel building, built in 1904, stands in a prominent position at the junction of Hope Street and Queen Street. The Horse and Jockey Public House, was probably originally built in the 16th century as a hall-house and retains its thatched roof.

High Street is notable for its grand 18th and 19th century properties of varying scale, colour and detail which were built on long, narrow burgage plots probably of medieval origin. The 18th century façade of the Wynnstay Hotel on Yorke Street closes the vista down the High Street. The hotel is notable as the birthplace of the Football Association of Wales, which was formed at a meeting in the hotel in 1876. The Golden Lion Pub on the High Street is of 16th century origin and became an inn c.1700. The listed Border Brewery chimney towers over Tuttle Street and forms a local landmark in the city centre.

In 2007, the then town was ranked fifth in the UK for business start-up success, higher than most larger UK towns and cities.

===Shopping===

There are several shopping streets including Hope Street with major retailers such as New Look, WHSmith and Claire&#x27;s and Bank street with independent businesses. Plas Coch and Berse retail parks are on the outskirts close to the A483. Central and Island Green retail parks are in the city centre. Eagles Meadow is a shopping and leisure development in the city, and contains branches of major chain stores and an Odeon Cinema, the development is connected to Yorke Street and High Street by a bridge. There are two traditional covered markets (General and Butchers) plus an open-air market on Mondays.

Wrexham has a Shopmobility service which is free. Much of the Wrexham city centre is pedestrianised.

Chetwood Financial is a fintech lender that acquired a full banking licence in 2018, the only new retail bank to secure a licence in 2018.

===Industries===

Wrexham Industrial Estate is one of the largest industrial areas in Europe and is home to over 340 businesses creating employment for over 10,000 people. The estate currently extends to over 550 hectares and is home to major manufacturing businesses in a range of sectors including automotive, aerospace, food, pharmaceutical and engineering.

Wrexham Industrial Estate is home to a number of biopharmaceutical companies such as Wockhardt and Ipsen which have major sites which provide research and development and manufacturing capabilities. The Industrial estate also hosts a 2,100 capacity Category C male prison, costing £212 million, which was built on the former Firestone Site. The prison opened in March 2017, and was named in February 2016 as HM Prison Berwyn.

Wrexham&#x27;s close location to both aerospace (Airbus are located in nearby Broughton) and automotive manufacturers have led to a number of organisations being in the city. JCB on the Wrexham Industrial Estate, ACT and Magellan Aerospace are all major employers in the area.

Large food manufacturing sites include Kelloggs, Cadbury, Rowan Foods and Village Bakery. Electronics companies Sharp and Brother have manufacturing facilities located along the A483.

One of Wrexham&#x27;s traditional industries is brewing. Wrexham was once home to Marstons, Border Breweries and Wrexham Lager. Wrexham is still a brewing town, however, on a smaller scale, many are either located on Wrexham Industrial Estate and in the city centre, this includes Big Hand, Magic Dragon, Erddig, Sandstone, Beech Avenue, Axiom and the revival of Wrexham Lager Beer.

===Residential development===
The central area of Wrexham has also seen a number of purpose-built residential developments as well as conversions of older buildings to residential use. Outside the city centre new estates are being developed in several areas, including over 500 homes at the former Brymbo Steelworks site, a ribbon of development on Mold Road leading out of the city (which includes four development companies) and Ruthin Road (Wrexham Western Gateway). There are further plans. These include the development of National Trust (NT) land at Erddig for over 250 homes. This latter proposal generated many protests, particularly from residents of nearby Rhostyllen.

==Parks and open spaces==

A total of 37 parks and green spaces in Wrexham County Borough Council ownership have been, or are in the process of being, legally protected with green space charity Fields in Trust ensuring they can never be built on, nor lost to development.

Wrexham has three parks, Bellevue Park, Acton Park and the parkland at Erddig, as well as a green area within the city centre called Llwyn Isaf.

Bellevue Park was built alongside the old cemetery on Ruabon Road. The park was designed to commemorate the jubilee year of the incorporation of Wrexham. It became neglected during the 1970s and many of the amenities were in a poor state of repair. A major project was undertaken to restore the park to its original state. The park reopened in June 2000. In 2015 Belle Vue Park was dedicated as a Fields in Trust Centenary Field because of its links with veterans of two world wars.

Acton Park was originally the landscaped grounds of Acton Hall. It was laid out in 1785 by James Wyatt on the instructions of the owner Sir Foster Cunliffe.

Llwyn Isaf, situated alongside Wrexham Guildhall, is a popular green area within the city centre. The green was originally the landscaped grounds of a mansion house known as Llwyn Isaf. It now lies at the centre of Wrexham&#x27;s civic centre just off Queens Square. The Welsh Children in Need concert was held here in 2005, which included Bryan Adams and Katherine Jenkins.

===Parish Church of St. Giles===

St. Giles is the Anglican parish church of Wrexham and is considered to be the greatest medieval church in Wales. It includes a colourful ceiling of flying musical angels, two early eagle lecterns, a window by the artist Edward Burne-Jones and the Royal Welch Fusiliers chapel. In the graveyard is the tomb of Elihu Yale who was the benefactor of Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, United States and after whom Yale College Wrexham is named. As a tribute to Yale and his resting place, a scaled-down replica of the church tower, known as Wrexham Tower was constructed at Yale University. The tower appears in an 18th-century rhyme, as one of the Seven Wonders of Wales. In 2015, a first edition (1611) of the King James Bible (also known as the Authorized Version) was discovered in a cabinet by the Vicar of the parish.
===St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral===
The Roman Catholic Cathedral of Our Lady of Sorrows in Regent Street is the main church of the Diocese of Wrexham, which extends over all of North Wales. Built in 1857 after Catholic Emancipation and at the height of the Gothic Revival, the cathedral was home to the Bishop of Menevia from 1898 until 1987, whose diocese covered all of Wales. However, in 1987 the Roman Catholic province of Wales was reconstructed, since which time the cathedral has been home to the Bishop of Wrexham. The cathedral is also home to the relic of Saint Richard Gwyn, Wrexham&#x27;s patron saint, who was a Roman Catholic martyr in the 16th century. Richard was hanged, drawn and quartered at Wrexham&#x27;s Beast Market. He was canonised by Pope Paul VI in 1970.

===Other denominations===
Wrexham has a number of non-conformist chapels and churches around the city, including a corps of The Salvation Army. The main Methodist church is Wrexham Methodist church, built in 1971 on the site of the former Brynyfynnon Chapel on Regent Street. There is also a Presbyterian church in the city.

Wrexham had a church with a spire dedicated to and named after St. Mark in St. Mark&#x27;s Road but it was demolished in 1960 after being declared unsafe and in danger of collapse due to inadequate foundations. A multi-storey car park named St. Mark&#x27;s was erected on the site.

==Education==
===Wrexham University===

Wrexham University was formed when the North East Wales Institute (NEWI) was granted full university status in 2008. It consists of Plas Coch campus in the western part of the city and the North Wales School of Art and Design located on Regent Street. The institution was founded in 1887 as the Wrexham School of Science and Art. It was formerly named after the 14th century scholar and last Welsh Prince of Wales, Owain Glyndŵr, as (Wrexham) Glyndŵr University.

===Yale College (Coleg Cambria)===

Yale College (now part of Coleg Cambria) is the main provider of adult education in Wrexham and is one of the largest colleges in Wales. As a tertiary college it also provides a wide range of higher education courses at its two campuses at Grove Park in the city centre and Bersham Road in southwest Wrexham.

It was named after Elihu Yale, best known for being the prime benefactor of Yale University. It was founded in 1950 as a state school on a site at Crispin Lane. In 1973, as part of the conversion of local schools to the comprehensive system, it was renamed as Yale Sixth Form College and the pupils re-located to other schools. The Crispin Lane site was incorporated into NEWI (now Glyndŵr University) after the development of the Grove Park Campus.

In 1998 Yale College took up residence in two sites across Wrexham: the faculty of engineering and construction at a site on Bersham Road, and a multi-purpose site in a redeveloped Grove Park campus. Over the next fifteen years the college grew.

In 2013 Yale College was merged with Deeside College, Northop College, and Llysfasi College to form a new college, Coleg Cambria, under the leadership of the ex-Deeside principal David Jones. The merger officially took place on 1 August 2013.

For the 2020–21 academic year, one of Coleg Cambria&#x27;s Yale Grove Park Campus in Wrexham city centre underwent redevelopment. With a cost of £20 million, the new Hafod building is described to be a &quot;commercial village&quot; in Wrexham.

===Schools===
Wrexham has a number of primary and secondary schools. It has just one Welsh-speaking secondary school, Ysgol Morgan Llwyd. In 2003, three of the largest secondary schools, St David&#x27;s School, Ysgol Bryn Offa and The Groves High School were merged to create two larger &quot;super schools&quot;, Rhosnesni High School, and Ysgol Clywedog. Other large secondary schools Darland High School and Ysgol Bryn Alyn, were both built in 1958. Wrexham has become home to the first shared-faith school in Wales, St Joseph&#x27;s.

There are seven Welsh medium primary schools in Wrexham County Borough, two of which are located in Wrexham city (Ysgol Bodhyfryd CP and Ysgol Plas Coch CP). Ysgol Morgan Llwyd serves as the single Welsh medium secondary school for the county and is located in Wrexham.

==Twin municipalities==
The city of Wrexham is twinned with the German district of Märkischer Kreis and the Polish town of Racibórz.

The first twinning was established on 17 March 1970 between the former Kreis Iserlohn and Wrexham Rural District. Its early success ensured that, after local government reorganisation in both countries in the mid-seventies, the twinning was taken over by the new Councils of Märkischer Kreis and Wrexham Maelor Borough Council and, in 1996, by Wrexham County Borough Council.

In 2001 Märkischer Kreis entered a twinning arrangement with Racibórz (Ratibor), a county in Poland, which was formerly part of Silesia, Germany. In September 2002, a delegation from Racibórz visited Wrexham and began initial discussions about possible co-operation which led, eventually, to the signing of Articles of Twinning between Wrexham and Racibórz in March 2004. The Wrexham area has strong historical links with Poland. Following World War II, many service personnel from the Free Polish armed forces who had been injured received treatment at Penley Polish Hospital. Many of their descendants remain in the area to this day.

It skirts the western edge of the city, dividing it from the urban villages to the west. The road has connections with major roads (A55(M53), A5(M54)). The A5156 leads to the A534 and on to the Wrexham Industrial Estate. The A541 road is the main route into Wrexham from Mold and the city&#x27;s western urban area. It connects to the B5101 road which eventually leads to the A5104 road to the east of Treuddyn in Flintshire.

==Future development==

The Welsh Government has acquired key sites to form part of the Wrexham Gateway Project to redevelop the Kop stand at the Racecourse Ground and upgrade the transportation network to support the upgrade in the sport and event facility.

£5.4 million funding has been agreed for the redevelopment of the Wrexham Museum that will integrate a Welsh Football Museum, which has been dubbed a museum of two halves. The football museum will have a number of themes including Welsh language communities, fan culture, Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic communities and LGBTQ+ experiences.

A health and wellbeing complex at Coleg Cambria is expected to be built by summer 2024 at a cost of £14 million.

<doc id="349534" wikidata="Q454297" url="?curid=349534" title="Prince Louis, Duke of Nemours">
<text>Prince Louis of Orléans, Duke of Nemours (Louis Charles Philippe Raphaël d&#x27;Orléans; 25 October 1814 – 26 June 1896) was the second son of King Louis-Philippe I of France, and his wife Maria Amalia of Naples and Sicily.

==Life==

===Childhood===

He was born at the Palais Royal, in Paris. At twelve years of age, he was nominated colonel of the First Regiment of Chasseurs, and in 1830 entered the &quot;Chambre des Pairs&quot;.

As early as 1825, while revolutionaries were still engaged in the Greek War of Independence, attempting to establish a Kingdom of Greece (which transpired with the London Conference of 1832), Louis&#x27; name was mentioned as a possible candidate as the first modern King of Greece. In February 1831, five months before revolutionaries succeeded in the Belgian Revolution, which established the Kingdom of Belgium, Louis was nominated to be the first King of the Belgians; international considerations deterred Louis-Philippe from accepting the honour for his son. Prince Louis did accompany the French &quot;Armée du Nord&quot; that entered Belgium to support its separation from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands; there he took part in the Siege of Antwerp (1832).

Louis accompanied the Algerian expedition against the town of Constantine in the autumn of 1836, and in a second expedition (1837) he was entrusted with the command of a brigade and with the direction of the siege operations at Constantine. General Damrémont was killed at his side on 12 October, and Constantine was taken by assault on the 13th.

He sailed a third time for Algeria in 1841, and served under General Bugeaud, taking part in the expedition to get provisions to Médéa on 29 April, and in sharp fighting near Miliana on 3 to 5 May. In the expedition against the fortified town of Takdempt, Louis commanded the 1st Infantry Division. On his return to France he became commandant of the camp of Compiègne.

Louis was also dispatched on missions of courtesy to England in 1835, in 1838 and in 1845, and to Berlin and Vienna in 1836.

===Marriage===
On 26 April 1840, he married Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha at the Château de Saint-Cloud. The occasion of his marriage in 1840 with Victoria was marked by a check to Louis-Philippe&#x27;s government in the form of a refusal to bestow the marriage dowry proposed by Adolphe Thiers in the Chamber of Deputies.

The death of his elder brother, Ferdinand, Duke of Orleans, in 1842 gave him a position of greater importance as the natural regent in the case of the accession of his nephew, the young Count of Paris. His reserve, and dislike of public functions, with a certain haughtiness of manner, however, made him unpopular.

On the outbreak of the revolution of 1848 he held the Tuileries long enough to cover the king&#x27;s retreat, but refrained from initiating active measures against the mob. He followed his sister-in-law, Hélène, Duchesse d&#x27;Orléans, and her two sons to the chamber of deputies, but was separated from them by the rioters, and only escaped finally by disguising himself in the uniform of a national guard.

===Exile and return to France===
He embarked for England, where he settled with his parents at Claremont. His chief aim during his exile, especially after his father&#x27;s death, was a reconciliation between the two branches of the house of Bourbon, as indispensable to the re-establishment of the French monarchy in any form. These wishes were frustrated on the one hand by the attitude of the comte de Chambord, and on the other by the determination of the Duchess of Orleans to maintain the pretensions of the Count of Paris. Nemours was prepared to go further than the other princes of his family in accepting the principles of the legitimists.

Lengthy negotiations ended in 1857 with a letter, written by Nemours, as he subsequently explained, at the dictation of his brother, François, prince de Joinville, in which he insisted that Chambord should express his adherence to the tricolour flag and to the principles of constitutional government. In 1871 the Orléans princes renewed their professions of allegiance to the senior branch of their house, but they were not consulted when the count of Chambord came to Paris in 1873, and their political differences remained until his death in 1883.

Nemours lived at Bushy House after the death in 1866 of Queen Marie Amélie, widow of Louis Philippe. In 1871 the exile imposed on the French princes was withdrawn, but he only transferred his establishment to Paris after their disabilities were also removed. In March 1872 he was restored to his rank in the army as general of division, and placed in the first section of the general staff. After his retirement from the active list he continued to act as president of the Red Cross Society until 1886, when new decrees against the princes of the blood led to his withdrawal from Parisian society.

During the presidency of Marshal MacMahon, he appeared from time to time at the Elysée. He died at Versailles on 26 June 1896 at the age of 81, the duchess having died at Claremont on 10 November 1857. He outlived all of his siblings apart from Princess Clémentine, the Duke of Aumale and the Prince of Joinville.

<doc id="349537" wikidata="Q1196857" url="?curid=349537" title="The Sea-Wolf">
<text>The Sea-Wolf is a 1904 psychological adventure novel by American writer Jack London. The book&#x27;s protagonist, Humphrey Van Weyden, is a literary critic who is a survivor of an ocean collision and who comes under the dominance of Wolf Larsen, the powerful and amoral sea captain who rescues him. Its first printing of forty thousand copies was immediately sold out before publication on the strength of London&#x27;s previous &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot;. Ambrose Bierce wrote, &quot;The great thing—and it is among the greatest of things—is that tremendous creation, Wolf Larsen... the hewing out and setting up of such a figure is enough for a man to do in one lifetime... The love element, with its absurd suppressions, and impossible proprieties, is awful.&quot;

==Background==
The personal character of the novel&#x27;s antagonist &quot;Wolf&quot; Larsen was attributed to a real sailor London had known, Captain Alex MacLean. According to London himself, &quot;much of the Sea-Wolf is imaginary development, but the basis is Alexander McLean&quot;. Captain Alex MacLean, or McLean, was born May 15, 1858, in East Bay, Nova Scotia. He sailed mostly in the Pacific Northwest with his brother, Captain Dan MacLean. MacLean was at one time the Sheriff of Nome, Alaska. The MacLean Captains maintained their ties to Cape Breton Island despite having spent much of their lives sailing the Pacific Coast. They have living descendants.

London, who was called &quot;Wolf&quot; by his close friends, also used a picture of a wolf on his bookplate, and named his mansion Wolf House. Given that Van Weyden&#x27;s experiences in the novel bear some resemblance to experiences London had, or heard told about, when he sailed on the &quot;Sophia Sutherland&quot;, the autodidact sailor Van Weyden has been compared to the autodidact sailor Jack London.

London&#x27;s intention in writing &quot;The Sea-Wolf&quot; was &quot;an attack on (Nietzsche&#x27;s) super-man philosophy.&quot; Nietzsche and Schopenhauer are mentioned in the second sentence of the novel as the preferred reading of the friend Humphrey Van Weyden visited before his shipwreck. The novel also contains references to Herbert Spencer in chapters 8, 10, Charles Darwin in chapters 5, 6, 10, 13, Omar Khayyam in chapters 11, 17, 26, Shakespeare in chapter 5, and John Milton in chapter 26.

The plot has some initial similarities to &quot;Captains Courageous&quot; by Rudyard Kipling in that they each have an idle, rich young man rescued from the sea and shanghaied into becoming a working sailor; however, the two stories differ widely in plot and moral tone.

==Plot summary==
&quot;The Sea-Wolf&quot; tells the story of a soft, domesticated protagonist — an intellectual man named Humphrey Van Weyden — forced to become tough and self-reliant by exposure to cruelty and brutality. The story starts with him aboard a San Francisco ferry, called &quot;Martinez&quot;, which collides with another ship in the fog and sinks. He is set adrift in the Bay, eventually being picked up by Wolf Larsen. Larsen is the captain of a seal-hunting schooner, the &quot;Ghost&quot;. Brutal and cynical, yet also highly intelligent and intellectual, he rules over his ship and terrorizes the crew with the aid of his exceptionally great physical strength. Van Weyden describes him as individualist, hedonist, and materialist. Larsen does not believe in the immortality of the soul; he finds no meaning in his life save for survival and pleasure, and he has come to despise all human life and deny its value. Being interested in someone capable of intellectual disputes, he somewhat takes care of Van Weyden, whom he calls &quot;Hump&quot;, while forcing him to become a cabin boy, do menial work, and learn to fight to protect himself from a brutal crew.

A key event in the story is an attempted mutiny against Wolf Larsen by several members of the crew. The organizers of the mutiny are Leach and Johnson. The two were motivated by previous slights by Wolf Larsen: Johnson had previously been beaten severely by Larsen, and Leach had been punched earlier while being forced to become a boat-puller. The first attempt at mutiny involved sending Larsen overboard; however, he manages to climb back onto the ship. Searching for his assailant, he ventures into the sleeping quarters, located beneath the main deck, the only exit being a ladder. Several, at least seven men, take part in the mutiny and attack Larsen. Larsen however, demonstrating his inhuman endurance and strength, manages to fight his way through the crew, climb the ladder with several men hanging off him, and escape relatively unharmed. Van Weyden is promoted as mate, for the original mate had been murdered. Larsen later gets his vengeance by torturing his crew, and constantly claiming that he is going to murder Leach and Johnson at his earliest convenience. He later allows them to be lost to the sea when they attempt to flee on a hunting boat.

During this section, the &quot;Ghost&quot; picks up another set of castaways, including a young unmarried woman named Maud Brewster. Miss Brewster and Van Weyden had known each other previously, but only as writers. Both Wolf Larsen and Van Weyden immediately feel attraction to her, due to her intelligence and &quot;female delicacy&quot;. Van Weyden sees her as his first true love. He strives to protect her from the crew, the horrors of the sea, and Wolf Larsen. As this happens, Wolf Larsen meets his brother Death Larsen, a bitter opponent of his. Wolf kidnapped several of Death&#x27;s crew and forced them into servitude to fill his own ranks, lost previously during a storm. Larsen attempts to assault Brewster, but is stopped by one of his intense, immobilizing headaches, which allows her and Van Weyden to steal a boat and flee.

The two eventually land on an uninhabited island, heavily populated with seals. They hunt, build shelter and a fire, and survive for several days, using the strength they gained while on the &quot;Ghost&quot;. The &quot;Ghost&quot; eventually crashes on the island, with Wolf Larsen the only crew member. As a revenge, Death Larsen had tracked his brother, bribed his crew, destroyed the rigging of the sails, and set Larsen adrift at sea. It is purely by chance that Van Weyden and Miss Brewster meet Larsen again.

Van Weyden obtains all of the weapons including firearms left on the ship, but he cannot bear to murder Larsen, who does not threaten him overtly, although Van Weyden fears that Larsen could attack at any time. Van Weyden and Miss Brewster decide they can repair the ship, but Larsen, who intends to die on the island and take them with him, sabotages any repairs they make. After a headache, Larsen is rendered blind. He feigns paralysis and attempts to murder Van Weyden when he draws within arm&#x27;s reach but just then has a stroke that leaves him blind and the right side of his body paralyzed. His condition only worsens; he loses usage of his remaining arm, leg, and voice. Miss Brewster and Van Weyden, unable to bring themselves to leave him to rot, care for him. Despite this kindness, he continues his resistance even in his ailing state, setting fire to the mattress of the bunk above him.

Van Weyden finishes repairing the &quot;Ghost&quot;, and he and Miss Brewster set sail. During a violent storm, Wolf Larsen dies. They give Larsen a burial at sea, an act mirroring an incident Van Weyden witnessed when he was first rescued. The story ends with the two being rescued by an American revenue cutter – after sharing a first kiss at the end of a long and harrowing adventure.

==Characters==

===Humphrey &quot;Hump&quot; Van Weyden===
Humphrey Van Weyden starts the book weak of body but strong of mind. He grows stronger as the story progresses, physically through the manual labor, and spiritually as he endures the various hardships, including his tumultuous relationship with Wolf Larsen. Upon meeting Maud Brewster, he realizes just how much he has changed, gaining muscle mass, a more rugged appearance, and a different outlook on life.

Van Weyden has a unique relationship with Wolf Larsen. Though he is in effect the captain&#x27;s prisoner, Larsen shows him favoritism and occasionally acts as a father figure, giving advice on how to survive aboard the ship. Though Larsen claims to take Van Weyden aboard primarily because he needed an additional hand, he also seems to genuinely believe he is doing something good for Van Weyden. He claims that Van Weyden has never &quot;stood on his own legs&quot;, meaning he has never had to work and always relied on his inheritance from his father to survive. Throughout the book, Larsen compliments Van Weyden on his growth, eventually telling him he is proud of him, and calling him a real man, able to stand on his own legs.

Van Weyden has an ideology that is in sharp contrast to Larsen&#x27;s. He believes in the eternal soul and that men should act justly under all circumstances. His views are constantly being challenged by Larsen, who encourages him to give in to his desires and behave in an amoral fashion. Van Weyden resists Larsen&#x27;s influence and retains his original ideology. By the end of the story, Larsen is annoyed that Van Weyden still clings to his beliefs and refuses to avenge himself upon Larsen, despite all the suffering Larsen has put him through.

===Wolf Larsen===
Physically, Larsen is described as approximately in height, with a massive build: broad shoulders and a deep chest. He displays tremendous strength throughout the story. Van Weyden describes Larsen as beautiful on more than one occasion, perfectly symmetrical, a perfect specimen of masculinity. Yet his true strength is described as something more primal, more primitive, and animalistic. This animalistic strength is representative of London&#x27;s belief in Social Darwinism; Wolf Larsen&#x27;s body had adapted so that Larsen could best survive on the sea and among sailors. He is extremely intelligent, having taught himself a variety of fields, including mathematics, literature, science, philosophy, and technology.

Larsen was born in Norway, though he is of Danish descent. He spent his entire life at sea: cabin-boy at twelve, ship&#x27;s boy at fourteen, seaman at sixteen, able seaman at seventeen. He has several brothers, but only Death Larsen is mentioned.

Larsen displays characteristics similar to what would later be described as sociopathy. He has absolutely no qualms about manipulating and bullying people to better serve his needs. He routinely takes men hostage, castaways such as Van Weyden and seal hunters from other ships, and uses them to fill his own ranks when needed. He murders and abuses people without hesitation, seeing no value in life. He enjoys the intellectual stimulation that Van Weyden and Miss Brewster provide, but Van Weyden describes their relationship as one between a king and his jester. According to Van Weyden, he is only a toy to Larsen. The only other activities in which Larsen seems to find joy is facing death and being in extreme danger because it allows him to test himself; these dangerous situations range from storms on the ocean to tormenting or fighting his crew men.

Despite his immense internal strength, Larsen at times shows signs of weakness and depression. He is envious of his brother, because his brother is simple minded, and so is able to enjoy life unburdened. He also claims he is envious of Miss Brewster&#x27;s and Van Weyden&#x27;s faith, but later says it is only his mind, and he knows he is better off without it. He also speaks of frustration that he never amounted to anything great. He claims that he had all the determination and will required, but was never given the proper opportunity. Wolf also suffers from headaches throughout the novel, yet claims to have never gotten sick before.

Wolf is not Larsen&#x27;s real given name, a fact known to the crew of the &quot;Ghost&quot;. His genuine given name is never revealed. Dialogue heavily implies that he is called &quot;Wolf&quot; because of his nature and viciousness, and, for similar reasons, his brother is called &quot;Death&quot;.

London was an outspoken member of the Socialist Party. Wolf Larsen portrays capitalists as people who care only for themselves and are willing to destroy other people for personal gain. Larsen injures and kills his sailors without hesitation, except when the loss of a sailor would harm the productivity of seal hunting which would harm the profits for Larsen; this is a dramatic representation of capitalism and capitalists harming poor people.

The word &quot;Wolf&quot; has the highest number of occurrences in the novel, appearing 422 times. The name &quot;Larsen&quot; comes second, with 363 appearances.

===Maud Brewster===
Maud Brewster is &quot;captured&quot; by Wolf Larsen just as Van Weyden was. She is rich and her work involves writing: she tells Wolf and Humphrey that she earns 1800 dollars a year, but would need a typewriter, pen and paper to work on the ship. She is not accustomed to doing things for herself. She is twenty-seven years old and beautiful. As a captive on Larsen&#x27;s boat, she uses her intelligence to survive. Miss Brewster has the ability to stare into people&#x27;s eyes and tell their emotions.

Her beliefs are similar to Van Weyden, and she has read widely. It is the introduction of Miss Brewster that adds a romantic element (albeit a chaste one) onto a maritime adventure novel. When Van Weyden decides that Larsen is too dangerous and may harm Brewster, Van Weyden and Brewster make an escape from the &quot;Ghost&quot; and Larsen.

<text>Royal Tunbridge Wells is a town in Kent, England, southeast of central London. It lies close to the border with East Sussex on the northern edge of the High Weald, whose sandstone geology is exemplified by the rock formation High Rocks. The town was a spa in the Restoration and a fashionable resort in the mid-1700s under Beau Nash when the Pantiles, and its chalybeate spring, attracted visitors who wished to take the waters. Though its popularity as a spa town waned with the advent of sea bathing, the town still derives much of its income from tourism.

The town has a population of around 56,500, and is the administrative centre of Tunbridge Wells Borough and in the parliamentary constituency of Tunbridge Wells.

==History==
===Iron Age===
Evidence suggests that Iron Age people farmed the fields and mined the iron-rich rocks in the Tunbridge Wells area, and excavations in 1940 and 1957–61 by James Money at High Rocks uncovered the remains of a defensive hill-fort. It is thought that the site was occupied into the era of Roman Britain, and the area continued to be part of the Wealden iron industry until its demise in the late eighteenth century. An iron forge remains in the grounds of Bayham Abbey, in use until 1575 and documented until 1714.
===Pre-modern era===
The area which is now Tunbridge Wells was part of the parish of Speldhurst for hundreds of years.

The origin of the town today came in the seventeenth century. In 1606 Dudley North, 3rd Baron North, a courtier to James I who was staying at a hunting lodge in Eridge in the hope that the country air might improve his ailing constitution, discovered a chalybeate spring. He drank from the spring and, when his health improved, he became convinced that it had healing properties. He persuaded his rich friends in London to try it, and by the time Queen Henrietta Maria, wife of King Charles I, visited in 1630 it had established itself as a spa retreat. By 1636 it had become so popular that two houses were built next to the spring to cater for the visitors, one for the ladies and one for the gentlemen, and in 1664 Lord Muskerry, Lord of the Manor, enclosed it with a triangular stone wall, and built a hall &quot;to shelter the dippers in wet weather.&quot;

Until 1676 little permanent building took place—visitors were obliged either to camp on the downs or to find lodgings at Southborough—, but at this time houses and shops were erected on the walks, and every &quot;convenient situation near the springs&quot; was built upon. Also in 1676 a subscription for a &quot;chapel of ease&quot; was opened, and in 1684 the Church of King Charles the Martyr was duly built and the town began to develop around it. In 1787 Edward Hasted described the new town as consisting of four small districts, &quot;named after the hills on which they stand, Mount Ephraim, Mount Pleasant and Mount Sion; the other is called the Wells...&quot;
The 1680s saw a building boom in the town: carefully planned shops were built beside the Pantiles promenade (then known as the Walks), and the Mount Sion road, on which lodging house keepers were to build, was laid out in small plots. Tradesmen in the town dealt in the luxury goods demanded by their patrons, which would certainly have included Tunbridge ware, a kind of decoratively inlaid woodwork.
&quot;They have made the wells very commodious by the many good building all about it and around which are lodgings for the company that drink the waters. All the people buy their own provisions at the market, which is just by the wells and is furnished with great plenty of all sorts of fish and fowl. The walk which is between high trees on the market side which are shops full of all sorts of toys, silver, china, milliners and all sorts of curious wooden ware besides which there are two large coffee houses for tea, chocolate etc. and two rooms for the lottery and hazard board (i.e. for gambling).&quot;—Celia Fiennes, 1697

Following Richard Russell&#x27;s 1750 treatise advocating sea water as a treatment for diseases of the glands, fashions in leisure changed and sea bathing became more popular than visiting the spas, which resulted in fewer visitors coming to the town. Nevertheless, the advent of turnpike roads gave Tunbridge Wells better communications—on weekdays a public coach made nine return journeys between Tunbridge Wells and London, and postal services operated every morning except Monday and every evening except Saturday. During the eighteenth century the growth of the town continued, as did its patronage by the wealthy leisured classes—it received celebrity cachet from visits by figures such as Cibber, Johnson, Garrick, Richardson and the successful bookseller Andrew Millar and his wife—and in 1735 Beau Nash appointed himself as master of ceremonies for all the entertainments that Tunbridge Wells had to offer. He remained in this position until his death in 1762, and under his patronage the town reached the height of its popularity as a fashionable resort.
===Nineteenth and twentieth centuries===
By the early nineteenth century Tunbridge Wells experienced growth as a place for the well-to-do to visit and make their homes. It became a fashionable resort town again following visits by the Duchess of Kent, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, and benefited from a new estate on Mount Pleasant and the building of the Trinity church in 1827, and improvements made to the town and the provision of facilities such as gas lighting and a police service meant that by 1837 the town population had swelled to 9,100. In 1842 an omnibus service was set up that ran from Tonbridge to Tunbridge Wells, enabling visitors to arrive from London within two hours, and in 1845 the town was linked to the railway network via a branch from South Eastern Railway&#x27;s London-Hastings Hastings Line at Tonbridge. During this time Decimus Burton developed John Ward&#x27;s Calverley Park estate.

In 1889 the town was awarded the status of a Borough, and it entered the 20th century in a prosperous state. 1902 saw the opening of an Opera House, and in 1909 the town received its &quot;Royal&quot; prefix. Due to its position in South East England, during the First World War Tunbridge Wells was made a headquarters for the army, and its hospitals were used to treat soldiers who had been sent home with a &quot;blighty wound&quot;; the town also received 150 Belgian refugees. The Second World War affected Tunbridge Wells in a different way—it became so swollen with refugees from London that accommodation was severely strained. Over 3,800 buildings were damaged by bombing, but only 15 people lost their lives.

Following the war, large-scale housing estates were built at Sherwood and Ramslye to accommodate population growth.

===Toponymy===
Edward Hasted asserted that although the wells were originally named the &quot;Queen&#x27;s-Wells&quot;, they soon took on the name of Tunbridge Wells due to their proximity to the town of Tonbridge (known as &quot;Tunbridge&quot; until 1870):
In compliment to [queen Henrietta Maria&#x27;s] doctor, Lewis Rowzee, in his treatise on them, calls these springs the Queen&#x27;s-wells; but this name lasted but a small time, and they were soon afterwards universally known by that of Tunbridge-wells, which names they acquired from the company usually residing at Tunbridge town, when they came into these parts for the benefit of drinking the waters
—Edward Hasted, 1797
The prefix &quot;Royal&quot; dates to 1909, when King Edward VII granted the town its official &quot;Royal&quot; title to celebrate its popularity over the years among members of the royal family. Tunbridge Wells is one of only three towns in England to have been granted this (the others being Leamington Spa and Wootton Bassett).

Although &quot;Wells&quot; has a plural form, it refers to the principal source, the chalybeate spring in the Pantiles (where the &quot;waters&quot; were taken).

==Governance==
Tunbridge Wells is the administrative centre for both Tunbridge Wells Borough and the parliamentary constituency of Tunbridge Wells. The Borough is governed by 48 Councillors, representing 20 wards (eight wards fall within the town of Tunbridge Wells itself). Elections are held for 16 Council seats each year on a rotational basis, with elections to Kent County Council taking place in the fourth year of the cycle. Each councillor serves a four-year term. Councillors meet regularly at Tunbridge Wells Town Hall.

Tunbridge Wells local elections show a pattern since 1973 of Conservative party dominance, apart from a two-year period from 1994 to 1996 of no overall control and a two-year period from 1996 to 1998 when the Liberal Democrats held a majority. By 2008, the Conservatives had a large majority with 44 seats compared with the Liberal Democrats&#x27; four. The extent of the Conservatives&#x27; dominance is further illustrated by the fact that in some wards (e.g. Park) Labour did not even field a candidate in the 2008 council elections.
By 2019, the local political situation had changed. In the 2019 local elections, the Conservative majority was cut to 8, and the council leader David Jukes lost his seat following months of controversy over the council&#x27;s plan to borrow £90 million in order to build new council offices, a new 1200-seat theatre, and underground car parking in Calverley Grounds.

The Member of Parliament (MP) for Tunbridge Wells is Liberal Democrat Mike Martin, whose majority at the 2024 election was 8,687. In September 2019, Former MP Greg Clark was one of 21 Conservative MPs to have the whip removed, after failing to back the Government, in keeping the option of a No-deal Brexit on the negotiating table. The constituency has been mostly Conservative since its inception in 1974 for the 1974 General Election; electing a Conservative every election until 2024 when they elected a Liberal Democrat for the first time. The three previous MPs were Sir Patrick Mayhew (1974–1997), the former Asda chairman Archie Norman (1997–2005) and the former Levelling Up Secretary, Greg Clark (2005-2024)

==Demography==
In 2006 the town of Tunbridge Wells was estimated to have a population of approximately 56,500. The wider borough of Tunbridge Wells is home to considerably more people—some 104,000 in 2001, up from around 99,500 in 1991.

The population of Tunbridge Wells is predominantly White and British in its ethnic origin and Christian in its religious affiliation: 97.5% of residents of the district described themselves as white in the 2001 census, and 75.0% identified themselves as being Christian.

The statistics for crime in Tunbridge Wells show that in 2005/6 there were fewer crimes occurring in the area than the national average.

==Geography==

Tunbridge Wells is on the Kentish border with East Sussex, about south of London; the original centre of the settlement lies directly on the Kent/East Sussex border, as recalled by the county boundary flagstone that still lies outside the church of King Charles the Martyr.

The town is at the northern edge of the High Weald, a ridge of hard sandstone that runs across southern England from Hampshire along the borders of Surrey, West Sussex, East Sussex and Kent—the town&#x27;s geology is illustrated by the exposed sandstone outcrops at the Wellington Rocks and High Rocks (a Site of Special Scientific Interest due to its exposed gulls), and the quarries at nearby Langton Green from which sandstone was taken to build houses in Tunbridge Wells. The town is sited at the head of a valley that runs south-east to Groombridge; like the River Teise, which originates in Tunbridge Wells, the stream in the valley is one of the many tributaries of the River Medway, which runs through a much larger valley north of the High Weald. The Tunbridge Wells Sand Formation geological unit takes its name from the town.

Nearby villages have been subsumed into the built-up area of the town, so that now it incorporates High Brooms to the north, Hawkenbury to the south, and Rusthall (whose name resonates with the iron content of the rocks) to the west.

===Twinning===
Tunbridge Wells is twinned with Wiesbaden, Germany.
In 1960, through an advertisement in the national press, contact was made between former paratroopers in Wiesbaden and four English ex-servicemen in Tunbridge Wells. Through this contact the friendship that now exists between the two towns sprang up, leading to the signing in 1989 of the official Twinning Charter. Also through this the &quot;Tunbridge Wells Twinning and Friendship Association&quot; (TWTFA) was formed.

===Climate===
Tunbridge Wells, like the rest of Britain, has a temperate maritime climate, lacking in weather extremes. The nearest official weather station is Goudhurst, about east of the town centre.

The absolute maximum temperature in Goudhurst stands at , recorded in August 1990, compared to the average annual warmest day maximum of . In total, 11.8 days should attain a temperature of or above.

The absolute minimum temperature recorded in Goudhurst was during January 1940, compared to the average annual coldest night minimum of . In total 52.8 nights should report an air frost.

Annual rainfall averages in Goudhurst , with over falling on 120.7 days.

==Economy==

As of 2002 there were around 50,000 people employed in the borough of Tunbridge Wells. The largest sector of the local economy consists of hotels, restaurants, and retail (the centrally located Royal Victoria Place shopping centre, opened in 1992, covers , which accounts for around 30% of all jobs; the finance and business sector makes up just under a quarter of jobs, as does the public administration, education and health sector. Tunbridge Wells is arguably the most important retail centre between London and Hastings.

The largest single employer in the town used to be the Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust, at the Kent and Sussex and Tunbridge Wells Hospitals, employing around 2500 people; the largest single commercial employer was AXA PPP healthcare, employing around 1,700 in four offices (PPP House, Union House, Phillips House and International House). Tunbridge Wells had a relatively low unemployment rate of around 1.0% in August 2008, compared to a UK national rate of around 5.4%.

==Transport==
Tunbridge Wells is at the hub of a series of roads, the primary ones being the A26, which runs from Maidstone to Newhaven; the A264, which runs from Five Oaks to Pembury (via Crawley and East Grinstead); and the A267, which runs south from Tunbridge Wells to Hailsham. The A21 passes to the east of the town, following the route of its turnpike ancestor, from London to Hastings.

Bus services are operated chiefly by Arriva Kent &amp; Sussex, providing local town and rural services to Tonbridge, Paddock Wood and Sevenoaks, as well as express services to locations such as Bromley and Maidstone. Eastbourne and Brighton on the south coast are accessible on services run by Stagecoach in Eastbourne and Brighton &amp; Hove respectively, and Metrobus operates hourly services to Crawley.

Tunbridge Wells town historically had three railway stations: two of these are still in use by National Rail services. Tunbridge Wells station is, as its former name of Tunbridge Wells Central suggests, centrally located within the town at the end of the High Street, whilst High Brooms station is situated in High Brooms, to the north of the town. Both stations are located on the double-tracked electrified Hastings Line; services are operated by the Southeastern train operating company.

Tunbridge Wells West station was opened by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway in 1866 as the terminus of its competing line to Tunbridge Wells, but closed in 1985 along with that line. The station building—a Grade II listed building—is now a restaurant, and a Sainsbury&#x27;s supermarket occupies the former goods yard. Part of the line was reopened in 1996 by the Tunbridge Wells and Eridge Railway Preservation Society, which now—as the Spa Valley Railway—operates a steam heritage railway that runs from Tunbridge Wells West to Eridge via High Rocks and Groombridge. The western end of the service was extended from Groombridge to Eridge, on the London-Uckfield line of Southern Railway, on 25 March 2011, serving a platform at Eridge which had been disused for many years. The tunnelled link line between the West and erstwhile Central stations, opened in 1876, remains closed.

In 2009 Network Rail installed a 12-car turnback siding just south of Tunbridge Wells station between the Grove Hill and Strawberry Hill tunnels to facilitate a more frequent service and to allow restricted types of London trains starting or terminating at Tunbridge Wells to be operated in 12-car formations. Previously such services were 11-car at most.

==Cultural references==
In the UK, the town has a reputation for being a bastion of the middle class and a typical example of &quot;Middle England&quot;. This is reflected in the locution &quot;Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells&quot;, first used by a fictional writer of letters to national newspapers in the 1950s, to express outrage and defend conservative values.

Tunbridge Wells is mentioned in Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s &quot;The Valley of Fear&quot;, H. G. Wells&#x27; &quot;Christina Alberta&#x27;s Father&quot;, Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;, Philip Reeve&#x27;s &quot;Mortal Engines&quot;, E. M. Forster&#x27;s &quot;A Room with a View&quot;, Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;, Arnold Bennett&#x27;s &quot;The Old Wives&#x27; Tale&quot;, and Zadie Smith&#x27;s &quot;White Teeth&quot;.

The Inspector Bone mysteries by Susannah Stacey are set in and around Tunbridge Wells. In Fanny Burney&#x27;s 1796 novel &quot;Camilla&quot;, several characters make an excursion to Tunbridge Wells, and there are many references to The Pantiles and other local sites.

David Lean&#x27;s epic film &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; closes with Mr. Dryden answering King Feisal: &quot;Me, your Highness? On the whole, I wish I&#x27;d stayed in Tunbridge Wells&quot;, and in the James Bond film &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; Tracy Di Vicenzo says to Bond that she &quot;looks forward to living as Mr and Mrs James Bond of Acacia Avenue, Tunbridge Wells&quot;.

Tunbridge Wells is referenced in another of David Lean&#x27;s films, &quot;A Passage to India&quot;, in which Mrs. Moore (Peggy Ashcroft) exclaims about the odious wife of the District Collector that &quot;My only consolation is that Mrs. Turton will soon be retired to a villa in Tunbridge Wells.&quot; Less well known is H. G. Wells&#x27;s sending up in his 1925 book &quot;Christina Alberta&#x27;s Father&quot;: &quot;Tunbridge Wells is Tunbridge Wells, and there is nothing really like it upon our planet&quot;.

In &quot;Spitting Image&quot;, when Britain enters a revolution, Tunbridge Wells declares independence under the slogan of &quot;liberty, equality, gardening&quot;.

In the TV sketch comedy series &quot;Rutland Weekend Television&quot;, there is a musical sketch that tells the tale of three US Navy sailors who plan to spend an exciting—&quot;More exciting than a book of Norman Mailer&#x27;s&quot;—and glamour-filled 24 hours in Tunbridge Wells.

==Parks and landmarks==
The Pantiles and its chalybeate spring have been the landmarks most readily associated with Royal Tunbridge Wells ever since the founding of the town, though the steel Millennium Clock at the Fiveways area in the centre of town, designed by local sculptor Jon Mills for the Millennium celebrations, stakes a claim to be a modern landmark.

Tunbridge Wells contains green spaces that range from woodland to maintained grounds and parks. The most substantial areas of woodland are the Tunbridge Wells and Rusthall Commons, which comprise of wood and heathland and are close to the centre of the town. Open areas of the common are popular picnic spots, and there is a maintained cricket ground situated next to Wellington Rocks.
Located in the town centre opposite the railway station, Calverley Grounds is a historic park with ornamental gardens and a bandstand (now demolished). The park was part of Mount Pleasant House, which was converted into a hotel in 1837, until 1920, when the borough council purchased it for the town. The bandstand dated from 1924 and was damaged by an incendiary bomb in 1940 and parts of the metalwork were sold for scrap metal. The subsequently repaired bandstand and the adjacent pavilion were intended to form part of a new centre to the park but were never completed. The bandstand was demolished in 2010 although the pavilion still exists as a café. Just inside the entrance to the park coming from the station is a memorial to Air Chief Marshal Lord Dowding, hero of the Battle of Britain, who lived and died in Tunbridge Wells.

Dunorlan Park, at the largest maintained green space in the town, was once a private garden that was part of the millionaire Henry Reed&#x27;s now demolished mansion, and only passed into public possession in 1941. The gardens were designed by the Victorian gardener James Green, but over the years they became overgrown, making it hard to distinguish the full scope of Marnock&#x27;s design. In 1996 Tunbridge Wells Borough Council applied to the Heritage Lottery Fund for a grant to restore the park in line with the original designs, and in 2003/4 Dunorlan underwent a £2.8 million restoration. The River Teise rises in the park, and two dams on it have created a pond and a boating lake. Dunorlan is listed as Grade II on English Heritage&#x27;s National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

Great Culverden Park is a small, -acre woodland in the Mount Ephraim area behind the site of the old Kent and Sussex Hospital and is the remnant grounds of the previous Great Culverden House designed by Decimus Burton that used to stand on Mount Ephraim.

The oldest public park in Tunbridge Wells is Grosvenor Recreation Ground designed by landscape architect Robert Marnock, located close to the town centre on Quarry Road. It was opened in 1889 by Mayor John Stone-Wigg, on the land that was formerly Caverley Waterworks. The lake area with dripping wells remains, but the other lakes, bandstand and open air pool have all gone. There is a bowls club, café, toilets and children&#x27;s play area, including cycle track. It is adjoined by the Hilbert recreation ground, parts of which have been designated as a local nature reserve by the Kent High Weald Partnership; these include Roundabout Woods and the adjoining grass areas. The Hilbert Recreation Ground was donated to the town by Cllr Edward Strange in 1931, on the site of the form John Beane&#x27;s Charity Farm. There are two football pitches, built as part of the King George V playing fields scheme, and a skatepark.

The Salomons Museum preserves the home of David Salomons, the first Jew to serve as Lord Mayor of London and the first non-Christian to sit in Parliament. It preserves the bench from which Salomons rose to speak as the first Jewish MP ever to speak in Parliament.

<text>René François Nicolas Marie Bazin (26 December 1853 – 20 July 1932) was a French novelist.

==Biography==
Born at Angers, he studied law in Paris, and on his return to Angers became Professor of Law in the Catholic university. In 1876, Bazin married Aline Bricard. The couple had two sons and six daughters. He contributed to Parisian journals a series of sketches of provincial life and descriptions of travel, and wrote &quot;Stephanette&quot; (1884), but he made his reputation with &quot;Une Tache d&#x27;Encre&quot; (&quot;A Spot of Ink&quot;) (1888), which received a prize from the Academy. He was admitted to the Académie française on 28 April 1904, to replace Ernest Legouvé.

René Bazin was a Knight Commander of the Order of St. Gregory the Great, and was President of the &quot;Corporation des Publicistes Chretiens&quot;.

<text>The Oakland firestorm of 1991, also known as the Tunnel Fire was a large suburban wildland–urban interface conflagration that occurred on the hillsides of northern Oakland, California, and southeastern Berkeley over the weekend of October 19–20, 1991, before being brought under full control on October 23. The official name of this incident by Cal Fire is the Tunnel Fire. It is also commonly referred to as the Oakland Hills firestorm or the East Bay Hills fire. The fire ultimately killed 25 people and injured 150 others. The 1,520 acres (620 ha) destroyed included 2,843 single-family dwellings and 437 apartment and condominium units. The economic loss from the fire was estimated at $1.5 billion ($ in dollars).

==Origins==
The fire started on Saturday, October19, from an incompletely and improperly extinguished grass fire in the Berkeley Hills, northeast of the intersection of California State Routes 24 and 13 ( north of the Caldecott Tunnel west portal. Firefighters fought the fire on a steep hillside above 7151 Buckingham Boulevard, and by Saturday night believed it to be under control.

The fire re-ignited as a brush fire shortly before 11:00a.m. on Sunday, October20, and rapidly spread southwest, driven by wind gusts up to per hour. It quickly overwhelmed local and regional firefighting resources. By 11:30 a.m., the fire had spread to the nearby Parkwoods Apartments located next to the Caldecott Tunnel. Shortly before noon, the fire had been blown up to the top of Hiller Highlands to the west, from where it began its sweep down into the Hiller Highlands development and the southern hills of Berkeley. Burning embers from houses and vegetation were carried ahead of the fire line by torrid winds and started new blazes ahead of the original burn. Within thirty minutes the fire had crossed both Highway24 (an eight-lane freeway) and Highway13 (a four-lane freeway), eventually igniting hundreds of houses in the Forest Park neighborhood on the northwest edge of the Montclair district and in the upper Rockridge neighborhood. The fire eventually touched the edge of Piedmont, burning some municipal property, but the buildings and houses were spared.

The hot, dry northeasterly winds, dubbed as &quot;Diablo winds&quot; in reference to the Diablo mountain range, Diablo Valley, and surrounding geography of same name, periodically occur during the early fall season. These are similar to the Santa Ana winds in Southern California, and have been the cause of numerous devastating fires. The fire began generating its own wind, the defining characteristic of a firestorm. The superheated fire-driven winds combined with warmer, drier air east of the Berkeley Hills, and interacted with the ambient cooler, more moist Bay/Coastal air to create erratic, dangerous gusts, which helped produce numerous rotational vortices. All of these combined to help spread the fire, tossing embers in all directions. The wind was so strong that it also blew debris across the bay into San Francisco. Ash fell onto the field of Candlestick Park where the Detroit Lions and San Francisco 49ers were playing during that afternoon. The CBS telecast of the game also showed live footage of the fire. As with the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake two years earlier, the blimp shots from the national sports media provided many people with first word of the disaster.

By mid-afternoon, the wind had slowed and shifted to the west, driving the fire to the southeast. At about 9:00p.m., the wind abruptly stopped, giving firefighters a chance to contain the fire.

==Firefighting response and difficulties==
Assistance from firefighting agencies as far north as the Oregon state line, as far south as Bakersfield and as far east as the Nevada state line were delayed initially. Official reports differ between when the Oakland Fire Department made requests, and when the state Department of Forestry and Fire Protection was asked to mobilize air tanker support to the fire zone. Eventually the California Department of Forestry (CDF) was asked to dispatch several air tankers, which doused the fire with tons of fire retardant throughout the day. The CDF established a base at the Naval Air Station in Alameda. Additionally, the Naval Air Station itself sent its own fire fighting equipment and material to the scene of the fire. The next morning, before full control had been gained, satellite photographs, especially infrared (heat-sensing) photographs, were provided with the help of NASA Ames Research Center&#x27;s Disaster Assistance and Rescue Team (DART) to aid firefighters in plotting the extent of the fire and spotting hidden hot spots.

In terms of alarm assignments, it was the equivalent of a 107-alarm fire.

For a variety of reasons, the firefighting teams were initially overwhelmed by the firestorm. The winds were gusting at times in excess of , creating erratic and extreme fire behavior. Flames took out power lines to seventeen pumping stations in the Oakland water system. Outside fire teams faced various equipment compatibility issues such as hydrants having the wrong size outlets for the hoses used by neighboring counties. Oakland was also not able to communicate with many mutual aid resources due to antiquated equipment and lack of access to statewide radio frequencies brought on by the budget restrictions in the preceding years. In some areas, firefighters simply ran out of water, as there was no power to refill the emptied reservoirs. Additionally, many narrow, winding roads in the area were crowded with parked cars, including many in front of fire hydrants; this prevented fire trucks and ambulances from getting to certain areas and connecting fire hoses. The general situation was one of chaos and panic among residents in the area.

The most important factor was the rapid spread of the wind-driven fire. Before most of the firefighting resources could be brought to the scene, the fire had established a large perimeter. At the fire&#x27;s peak, it destroyed one house every 11 seconds. By the first hour, the fire had destroyed nearly 790structures. In addition to the winds and the heat, an important factor in the rapid spread of the fire was that it started in an area that was at an interface between developed and undeveloped land. Many of the first dwellings to burn were surrounded by thick, dry vegetation. In addition, the nearby undeveloped land had even more dry brush. Other factors included many wood shake/shingle roofs which were easily ignited by embers, and the use of wood chip mulch in landscaping around buildings, which was blown around spreading embers and igniting vegetation across streets.

The same conditions (known as Diablo Winds) contributed to a major conflagration nearby in the 1923 Berkeley fire and a more limited conflagration in the same area on September22, 1970, again under similar conditions. A smaller fire also started in Wildcat Canyon on December14, 1980.

As night descended, the firestorm threatened to destroy the historic Claremont Resort hotel, where the media had gathered to report on the fire. Television crews trained their cameras on the dark hill immediately behind the hotel and millions watched as the fire slowly marched house by house toward the evacuated hotel. The fire was stopped shortly before it reached the hotel.

By 5:00p.m., the winds died down, giving firefighters a chance to control the blaze, though full containment would not be achieved until October22. As many as 400engine companies, 1,500personnel, and 250agencies worked to put out the fire.

By Wednesday, October23, at 8:00a.m., the fire was declared under control, almost 72hours after it started.

==Aftermath==

The fire&#x27;s rapid rate of spread and massively-destructive nature sparked renewed recognition of the dangers posed by wildland-urban interface fires in major cities, and spurred research and investigation into improved prevention and suppression of such fires.

Several nonprofit groups arose after the fire. One, the Hills Emergency Forum, was created by local fire agencies to build consensus on fire safety standards and codes, offer multi-jurisdictional training, and coordinate fuel reduction strategies, as well as other goals. At least two citizen groups also arose, the North Hills Phoenix Association and the Claremont Canyon Conservancy to participate in policy decisions and provide educational and stewardship services at the wildland–urban interface. The fire validated that the efforts undertaken by CARD (Collaborating Agencies Responding to Disasters) after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, to build a nonprofit preparedness infrastructure, were key to addressing the needs of vulnerable communities.

In response to deficient firefighting equipment during the disaster, Oakland city firefighters carry more extensive wildland firefighting gear and fire shelters. Prior to and during the firestorm, when this was not standard equipment, firefighters were sometimes forced to don turn-outs which greatly hampered their ability to move quickly and stay cooler during a wildland fire.

Fire hydrants with industry standard and  inch outlets were later installed throughout the city. The lack of a standard in 1991 caused numerous difficulties for the agencies who attempted to connect to non-standard hydrants, even though the outlets previously used by Oakland were considerably more efficient. Water cisterns and a new hills fire station were added, and radio communications were improved.

On June 12, 2008, a brush fire ignited in almost the exact location of the starting point of the 1991 fire, but owing to a rapid response, the preventive measures implemented after the 1991 disaster, and the lack of significant winds, the fire was confined to , with no damage to any structures, and was extinguished within 90 minutes.

In 2015, a $4 million federal grant to prevent fires in the Oakland Hills ignited debate over whether to cut down trees in the region. The city and its fire department say clearing young eucalyptus trees and other non-native plants would deter another deadly firestorm like the one that whipped through the hills in 1991.

One of the most famous victims who lost his house in the disaster was game designer Will Wright, who lived a few blocks away from where the fire started. He used his experience of rebuilding his life as the basis for the concept of the Maxis computer game series &quot;The Sims&quot;, and added the city&#x27;s recovery from the fire as a scenario in the game &quot;SimCity 2000&quot;.

The fire provided a sample of more than 3000 structures that burned in a known accidental fire. A group of fire investigators surveyed the residences and looked for artifacts that would normally be considered &quot;suspicious,&quot; such as melted metals, spalled concrete and crazed glass. A careful study of 50 of the homes revealed that most of them contained artifacts that would be considered evidence of arson had they been found in an isolated fire that burned to completion.

<doc id="349555" wikidata="Q1080699" url="?curid=349555" title="Koro (disease)">
<text>Koro is a culture bound delusional disorder in which individuals have an overpowering belief that their sex organs are retracting and will disappear, despite the lack of any true longstanding changes to the genitals. Koro is also known as shrinking penis, and was listed in the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot;.

The syndrome occurs worldwide, and mass hysteria of genital-shrinkage anxiety has a history in Africa, Asia and Europe. In the United States and Europe, the syndrome is commonly known as genital retraction syndrome.

The condition can be diagnosed through psychological assessment along with physical examination to rule out genuine disorders of the genitalia that could be causing true retraction.

The word was borrowed from Malay and means the &quot;head of a turtle&quot; (or &quot;tortoise&quot;), referring to how it looks when they retract their heads into their shells.

==Signs and symptoms==
Most patients report acute anxiety attacks due to perceived genital retraction and/or genital shrinkage, despite a lack of any objectively visible biological changes in the genitalia that are longstanding. &quot;Longstanding&quot; refers to changes that are sustained over a significant period and do not appear reversible, unlike the effect of cold temperatures on some genital regions that cause retraction. These changes may trigger a koro attack when observed, although the effects of cold temperatures are objectively reversible. According to literature, episodes usually last several hours, though the duration may be as long as two days. There are cases in which koro symptoms persist for years in a chronic state, indicating a potential co-morbidity with body dysmorphic disorder. In addition to retraction, other symptoms include a perception of alteration of penis shape and loss of penile muscle tone. In cases when patients have no perception of retraction, some patients may complain of genital paraesthesia or genital shortening. Among females, the cardinal symptom is nipple retraction in the breast, generally into the breast as a whole.

Psychological components of koro anxiety include fear of impending death, penile dissolution and loss of sexual power. Feelings of impending death along with retraction and perceived spermatorrhea has a strong cultural link with Chinese traditional beliefs. This is demonstrated by the fact that Asians generally believe koro symptoms are fatal, unlike most patients in the West. Other ideational themes are intra-abdominal organ shrinkage, sex-change to female or eunuch, non-specific physical danger, urinary obstruction, sterility, impending madness, spirit possession and a feeling of being bewitched.

Individuals with extreme anxiety and their family members may resort to physical methods to prevent the believed retraction of the penis. A man may perform manual or mechanical penile traction, or &quot;anchoring&quot; by a loop of string or some clamping device. Similarly, a woman may be seen grabbing her own breast, pulling her nipple, or even having iron pins inserted into the nipple. Physical injury may occur from these attempts. These forceful attempts often lead to injuries, sometimes death.

==Causes==
Psychosexual conflicts, personality factors, and cultural beliefs are considered as being of etiological
significance to koro. Sexual adjustment histories of non-Chinese individuals are often significant, such as premorbid sex inadequacy, sexual promiscuity, guilt over masturbation, and impotence.

==Diagnosis==
Several criteria are typically used to make a diagnosis of koro. The primary criterion is a patient&#x27;s report of genital (typically penile or female nipple) retraction despite a lack of objective physical evidence demonstrating retraction. This is accompanied by severe anxiety related to the retraction, fear of death as a result of retraction, and use of mechanical means to prevent retraction. Cases that do not meet all the requirements are generally classified as koro-like symptoms or given a diagnosis of partial koro syndrome. It has been argued that the criteria are sufficient but not necessary to make a diagnosis of koro. Researchers have identified koro as a possible &quot;cultural relative&quot; of body dysmorphic disorder. DSM-IV explains the process of differential diagnosis between these two disorders.

===History and physical examination===
A medical, psychosexual and psychiatric history should be documented. The physician should explore the patient&#x27;s concerns about appearance and body image (ruling out body dysmorphic disorder). Additionally, the physician should inquire about overall beliefs, personal values, and assumptions that the patient is making about his or her genitals. Given that koro is often an “attack” with a great deal of associated anxiety, the physician should ascertain the patient&#x27;s emotional state along with the timeline from onset to the presentation at the examination.

A physical examination should involve an assessment of overall health along with a detailed genital examination. In men, genital examination should be performed immediately after penile exposure, to avoid changes due to external temperature. The primary intent of the male exam is to exclude genuine penile anomalies such as hypospadias, epispadias and Peyronie&#x27;s disease. The presence of a significant suprapubic fat pad should be noted as well. Careful measurements of flaccid length, stretched length and flaccid girth will also be useful. If male patients insist that their penis is shrinking and disappearing, measurements after intracavernosal alprostadil may be used in the office to determine the true erect length and to diagnose any penile abnormalities in the erect state. A physical examination should note any injuries inflicted by the patient in an effort to &quot;prevent&quot; retraction as further confirmation of koro.

===Classification===
In DSM-IV-TR, koro is listed as one of the entries in the Glossary of Culture-Bound Syndromes of Appendix I. The manual gives koro&#x27;s definition as &quot;a term, probably of Malaysian origin, that refers to an episode of sudden and intense anxiety that the penis (or, in females, the vulva and nipples) will recede into the body and possibly cause death.&quot; Attempts have been made by numerous authors to place koro into different classes. For example, koro may fit into the group of &quot;specific culture-imposed nosophobia&quot; (classification with cardinal sign), &quot;the genital retraction taxon&quot; (classification with common factors between syndromes), and the group with &quot;culture-related beliefs as causes for the occurrence&quot; (classification according to how the syndromes might be affected by cultural factors).

Various authors have attempted to distinguish between complete and incomplete forms of koro, along with cultural and non-cultural forms. Cultural forms are said to involve a cultural belief or myth which plays a role in the genesis and spread of the disease in the community. These are regarded as complete forms of koro, matching all the symptoms required for diagnosis without significant co-morbidity. Differentiation into primary koro, a culture-bound expression, and secondary koro. Secondary koro is proposed to have co-morbidity with a CNS disorder, another psychiatric disorder, or possible drug use.

Traditional Chinese medicine recognises koro as a sexual disease and classifies it into two categories, namely &quot;cold conglomeration in liver&quot; and &quot;depletion of kidney&#x27;s yang&quot;.

===Differential diagnosis===
Men who present with this complaint may have koro, but they may also be misinformed about normal genital size. Additionally, they may have penile dysmorphophobia. Penile dysmorphophobia is related to body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition (Text Revision) (DSM-IV-TR) as a condition marked by excessive preoccupation with an imaginary or minor defect in a facial feature or localized part of the body. BDD is different from koro. In koro, a patient is overcome with the belief that his penis is actively shrinking, and it may be in imminent danger of disappearing. Clinical literature indicates that these two psychological conditions should be separated during differential diagnosis.

In addition to differentiating koro from body dysmorphic disorder, physicians also recommend that differential diagnosis separates koro from physical urological abnormalities. For example, one physical disorder that causes loss of penile size is Peyronie&#x27;s disease, where the tunica albuginea develops scar tissue that prevents the full expansion of an erection and causes flaccid penis retraction. Additionally, a buried penis is a normally developed penis, partially covered by the suprapubic fat which can be surgically removed.

==Treatment==
In historical culture-bound cases, reassurance and talks on sexual anatomy are given. Patients are treated with psychotherapy distributed according to symptoms and to etiologically significant points in the past. Prognosis appears to be better in cases with a previously functional personality, a short history and low frequency of attacks, and a relatively uncomplicated sexual life.

For sporadic Western cases, careful diagnostic workup including searching for underlying sexual conflict is common. The choice of psychotherapeutic treatment is based on the psychiatric pathology found.

===Indigenous treatment===
In China, traditional treatment based on the causes suggested by cultural beliefs are administered to the patient. Praying to gods and asking Taoist priests to perform exorcism is common. If a fox spirit is believed to be involved, people may hit gongs or beat the person to drive it out. The person will receive a yang- or yin-augmenting Chinese medicine to try to balance the internal conditions, usually including herbs, pilose antler (stag of deer) or deer tail, and tiger penis, deer penis, or fur seal penis. Other medicinal foods for therapy are pepper soup, ginger soup and liquor.

==Epidemiology==
Among the Chinese, koro is confined to South China and the lower Yangtze Valley. A 1992 study of self-report questionnaires suggests that in the epidemic area of China, individuals with koro are mostly Han, male, young, single, poorly educated and fearful of supernatural forces and koro. The phenomenon is also found among overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, especially Malaysia and Indonesia, and less frequently among the Malay and Indonesian inhabitants of the countries. Though there are speculations that the occurrence of koro among people in Malaysia and Indonesia was the result of Chinese migrants, this cultural diffusion view is challenged since koro epidemics have been reported in Thailand and India, involving masses of non-Chinese people.

Sporadic cases of koro among people with non-Southeast-Asian ethnicity have been reported across the globe, for example, Nepali, Sudanese, Jordanian, Tanzanian, Nigerian, French, British, American and Canadian. In most of the non-Chinese cases in the Western hemisphere, fear of genital shrinkage is reported but not all the other typical koro symptoms, such as fear of death, as in endemic countries. The incomplete forms of koro are regarded as the non-cultural forms, while the complete form with acute anxiety is the classical culture-bound type.

===China===
Local official records indicate genital retraction epidemics in Hainan Island and Leizhou Peninsula in Guangdong, China, as early as the late nineteenth century. There were a series of epidemic outbursts in 1948, 1955, 1966, and 1974, whenever there was social tension or impending disaster, followed by the last widespread episode in 1984–1985 and a much smaller outbreak in 1987. The 1984–1985 epidemics lasted for over a year and affected over 3,000 people in 16 cities and provinces. A mental health campaign was conducted for the epidemic and since then no further episodes of the epidemic has occurred in China. Improvement in local economic conditions, associated with a better quality of life, is suggested to contribute to the fading of the episodic occurrences of koro.

===Southeast Asia===
A koro epidemic struck Singapore in October 1967 for about ten days. Newspapers initially reported that some people developed koro after eating the meat of pigs inoculated with a vaccine for swine influenza. Rumours relating eating pork and koro spread after a further report of an inoculated pig dying from penile retraction. The cases reported amounted to 97 in a single hospital unit within one day, at five days after the original news report. Government and medical officials alleviated the outbreak only by public announcements over television and in the newspapers.

An epidemic outbreak in November 1976 in Isan, Thailand caused at least 350 cases, most of them Thai and males. Popular opinion and news media echoed the affected individuals&#x27; projection of viewing the epidemic as caused by Vietnamese food and tobacco poisoning in a hideous assault against the Thai people. Another large-scale epidemic in Thailand occurred in 1982.

===India===
In 1982, a koro epidemic episode in Northeast India affected, in majority, poorly educated people from lower socio-economic strata. There was no evidence of significant premorbid or sexual psychopathology in most cases.

Mass Koro epidemic was reported in Labour Camps in Kochi, Kerala in South India during August and September 2010 among migrant labour population from North and North-east India. Reportedly, the epidemic spread to about 100 individuals in 3 labour Camps within 2 weeks.

Mass Koro epidemic was reported in the state of West Bengal, India from July to December 2010, in the districts near southern part of India-Bangladesh border, affecting hundreds of people. It is called Disco Rog () meaning weird disease or Jhinjhinani Rog () meaning tingling disease, in that region. Locals created some folk managements for this condition like partly submerging the patient in a pond and pulling and holding her nipples or his genital. It is reported and published in many newspapers like Anandabazar Patrika at that time.

=== Africa ===
In the 1970s and early 1980s, newspapers reported incidents of genital shrinking in Western Nigeria. Since late 1996, a small-scale epidemic of genital shrinking was reported in West African nations. Affected individuals in the African outbreaks often interpreted the experience as genital theft, accusing someone with whom they had contact of &quot;stealing&quot; the organ and the spiritual essence, causing impotence. The perceived motive for theft was associated with local occult belief, the witchcraft of juju, to feed the spiritual agency or to hold the genital for ransom. Social representations about juju constitute consensual realities that propose both a means and motivation for genital-shrinking experience.

The epidemic began in Nigeria and Cameroon, and spread to Ghana, Ivory Coast and Senegal by 1997. Cases were reported in Cotonou, Benin where mobs attacked individuals accused of the penis theft and authorities ordered security forces to curb the violence, following the deaths of five people by vigilantes. Later reports of outbreak suggest a spread beyond West Africa, including the coverage of episodes in Khartoum, Sudan in September 2003; Banjul, Gambia in October 2003; and Kinshasa, DR Congo in 2008.

Comparing West African genital-shrinking epidemics with koro in Southeast Asia, the latter has symptoms centered on genital retraction (instead of shrinkage) and fear of death (which is absent in African cases). A study analyzing the West African epidemics from 1997 to 2003 concluded that rather than psychopathology, the episodes were the product of normal psychological functioning in undisturbed individuals, who were influenced by the local cultural models or social representations.

===US and Europe===
In the late Middle Ages in Europe, it was believed that men could lose their penises through magical attacks by witches. The &quot;Malleus Maleficarum&quot;, a fifteenth-century European manual for witchcraft investigations, relates stories of men claiming that their genitals had disappeared, being &quot;hidden by the devil … so that they can be neither seen nor felt.&quot; They were said to have reappeared after the men had appeased the witches responsible. Witches were said to store the removed genitals in birds&#x27; nests or in boxes, where &quot;they move themselves like living members and eat oats and corn&quot;.

At least three publications of the 1880s, from the US, Russia and England, reported genital retraction pathology, without using the Malay or Chinese term. Koro epidemics in China were first noticed in a French report in 1908 and descriptions of koro entered clinical books of western medicine in 1936. In the 1950s, koro is noted in nosological and diagnostic psychiatry.

==Society and culture==
===Chinese cultural beliefs===
Most of the ancient literature concerning koro was related to Chinese ethnic groups. For example, koro (in its Chinese term of &quot;shuk yang&quot;, &quot;shook yong&quot; or &quot;suo yang&quot; (simplified Chinese: 缩阳; traditional Chinese: 縮陽)) is documented in the old medical book &quot;New Collection of remedies of value&quot; () which was published in Qing Dynasty. The book described the condition as &quot;yin type of cold qi invasion&quot; () which involved a sudden seizure during sexual intercourse with the penis retracting into the abdomen. It asserts that the patient will die if not treated with &quot;heaty&quot; drugs in time.

Factors of cultural expectation in the genesis of koro can be built upon ideas of sex physiology in the traditional Chinese medicine, with free play of imagination which links fatality with genital retraction.

In the ancient Chinese medical book &quot;Zhong Zang Jing&quot; (), retraction of the penis with distension of the abdomen was described as a certain sign of death. The yin and yang theory proposes that an unbalanced loss of the yang humour produces genital shrinkage.

In Taoism and traditional Chinese medicine, frequent ejaculation is regarded as detrimental to health, as semen is considered to be related to a man&#x27;s vital energy, and hence excessive depletion of semen may lead to illness or death. Some authors believe that the idea of death caused by the semen depletion resembles the idea of death caused by genital disappearance, although such linkage between koro and Taoism, which influences Chinese medicine to some degree, is only speculative.

The popularity of Chinese folklore also plays a role. The novel about ghost stories &quot;Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio&quot; describes a fox spirit which can make people weak physically and sexually and shrink their tissues. Belief in koro being caused by the fox ghost among the southern Chinese has been reported.

===Etymology and geographical background===
The earliest Western reference to the term &quot;koro&quot; (&quot;koro-koro&quot;) is found in a letter from Celebes (now Sulawesi) by Carl Wilhelm Maurus Schmidtmüller, published in 1849. The name could be derived from a river, its surrounding valley, and a local tribe of the same name which is located at northwestern sector of Sulawesi, Indonesia. The word is also used in Makassarese language, meaning &quot;to shrink&quot;; the full expression is &quot;garring koro&quot;. Koro may also be derived from Malay term &quot;Kura&quot; which means &quot;head of turtle&quot; or &quot;keruk&quot; which means &quot;to shrink&quot;. The term &quot;shuk yang&quot; (缩阳), adapted from Chinese, means &quot;the shrinkage of penis&quot;. The term &quot;koro&quot; is also known as &quot;rok loo&quot; (genital shrinkage disease) in Thailand, &quot;jinjinnia bemar&quot; in Assam, India, and &quot;lanuk e laso&quot; by the Bogoba tribe in Philippines.

<doc id="349558" wikidata="Q209044" url="?curid=349558" title="Gorgonzola">
<text>Gorgonzola (, ) is a famously pungent Italian blue cheese made from unskimmed cow&#x27;s milk; believed to have been created in the 9th century; now with use of its name controlled under the criteria of a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO). 

Gorgonzola is available in two primary variations: &quot;Dolce&quot; with a more delicate flavor and buttery concistency, vs &quot;Piccante&quot; with a more pungent flavor and firm, crumbly texture. Either can be quite salty, with a &quot;bite&quot; from their blue veining. More recently, a variation has been marketed widely, featuring a layered block alternating the more assertive Gorgonzola with the more delicate Mascarpone, marketed as &quot;Gorgonzola e Mascarpone.&quot;

The cheese takes its name from Lombardian town of Gorgonzola, Milan, where the cheese originated and which celebrates an annual September Gorgonzola festival, called the &quot;Sagra Nazionale del Gorgonzola&quot;. 

Within the European Union and countries recognizing Protected Designation of Origin (PDO), a cheese bearing the name &quot;Gorgonzola&quot; may only originate from its closely defined geographic locale. Outside the EU and countries recognizing the PDO, the name &quot;Gorgonzola&quot; may legally be used to designate similar blue-veined cheeses — as with those from, for example, Wisconsin, Vermont, or elsewhere within the USA. 

==History==

Historically, Gorgonzola has been produced for centuries in Gorgonzola, Milan, acquiring its greenish-blue marbling in the 11th century. However, the town&#x27;s claim of geographical origin is disputed by other nearby localities.

For example, another possible place of origin is the well known cheese-making area known for ancient dairy traditions, Pasturo nella Valsassina. This is because of the presence of superb natural caves that stay at the perfect temperature (between 6 and 12 degrees Celsius) to make Gorgonzola and many other cheeses. Gorgonzola was supposedly created in the Middle Ages from the years 879–1007 AD.

There is a Lombardy legend of Gorgonzola’s origin where a cheese maker added new fresh curds to a vat and left it open all night. He apparently forgot about the curds because he was in a rush to meet his lover. He attempted to fix his mistake and added fresh curds to the vat and a few months later he was surprised with a new bluish mold that had grown on his cheese. He tasted this and realized the surprisingly great and unique taste of the cheese. This was also the first discovery of the process of &quot;erborinatura&quot;, the creation of mold.

Gorgonzola was referred to as &quot;Stracchino Verde&quot; until the early 20th century: &quot;Stracchino&quot; used to describe a number of young, soft cheeses — and &quot;verde&quot; refers to the cheese&#x27;s blue-green veining. 

Gorgonzola has been recognized since 1955 as a DOC in its &quot;Dolce&quot; and &quot;Picante&quot; variations — and since 1996, it has been registered as a DOP. 

Since the beginning of the 20th century, popularity of Gorgonzola has steadily increased, with exports having exceeded the tens thousand tons per year. Exports include the UK, France, and Germany. 
After World War II, a new technique called the &quot;one-curd&quot; processing method was introduced, addressing problems of hygiene, quality, and cost. As hundreds of cheese factories adopted the new techniques in the 1970s, smaller producers could not afford to modernize and went out of business.

==Production==

Today, Gorgonzola is mainly produced in the northern Italian regions of Piedmont and Lombardy. The whey is removed during curdling, and the result is aged at low temperatures.

During the ageing process, metal rods are quickly inserted and removed, creating air channels that allow the mould spores to grow into hyphae and cause the cheese&#x27;s characteristic veining. Gorgonzola is typically aged for three to four months. The length of the ageing process determines the consistency of the cheese, which gets firmer as it ripens. There are two varieties of Gorgonzola, which differ mainly in their age: the less aged Gorgonzola Dolce (also called Sweet Gorgonzola), which can have a less salty taste and a slightly sweet finish, and the more aged Gorgonzola Piccante (also called Gorgonzola Naturale, Gorgonzola Montagna, or Mountain Gorgonzola).

==Protected designation of origin==

Under EU law, Gorgonzola has been registered as a protected designation of origin (PDO), or &quot;denominazione di origine protetta&quot; (DOP) in Italy, since 1996. This means that Gorgonzola sold in the European Union can only be produced in the provinces of Novara, Bergamo, Brescia, Como, Cremona, Cuneo, Lecco, Lodi, Milan, Pavia, Varese, Verbano-Cusio-Ossola and Vercelli, as well as several &quot;comuni&quot; (municipalities) in the area of Casale Monferrato (province of Alessandria). As a Geographical indication, Gorgonzola produced in parts of Italy is protected in certain countries based on bilateral agreements of the European Union, membership of the Lisbon Agreement or national registration as a certification mark.

==Non-European Gorgonzola cheese==
Over time, production of the cheese outside Europe has led to the genericization of the term &quot;Gorgonzola&quot; in certain parts of the world, including in Australia. Gorgonzola cheese made outside of the European Union is a family of blue cheeses made from cows&#x27; milk and inspired by the original Italian cheese. Whole cow&#x27;s milk is used, to which starter microbes are added with spores of the mould &quot;Penicillium glaucum&quot;.

In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration has established what is known as standards of identity (SOIs). SOIs give the US definitions of the basic nature of a food, its ingredients, and its common name. The US Code of Federal Regulations Title 21—Food and Drugs, Chapter I—Food and Drug Administration, Subchapter B—Food for Human Consumption describes a production process for &quot;Gorgonzola&quot; cheese. This SOI, in addition to establishing &quot;Gorgonzola&quot; as the product name for this type of cheese for production in the United States, would also apply to any &quot;Gorgonzola&quot; cheese imported from non-United States countries.

==Consumption==
Gorgonzola may be eaten in many ways, as with all blue cheeses. It is often added to salads, either straight or as part of a blue cheese dressing. Combined with other soft cheeses, it is an ingredient of pizza quattro formaggi (&#x27;four cheese pizza&#x27;). It is often used as a topping for steak, sometimes as a sauce with Port or other sweet wine. It may be melted into a risotto in the final stage of cooking, added to gnocchi, or served alongside polenta.

Nutrition is as follows: 1 ounce* of gorgonzola contains 100 calories, 9 g of fat, 375 mg of sodium, 1 g of carbohydrate and 6 g of protein. It contains 5.3 g of saturated fat.

==Literary references==
James Joyce, in his 1922 novel &quot;Ulysses&quot;, gives his hero Bloom a lunch of &quot;a glass of Burgundy and a Gorgonzola sandwich&quot;. In his 1972 book &quot;Ulysses on the Liffey&quot;, critic and Joyce scholar Richard Ellmann suggests that &quot;Besides serving as a parable that life breeds corruption, Gorgonzola is probably chosen also because of Dante&#x27;s adventures with the Gorgon in the &quot;Inferno IX&quot;. Bloom masters the monster by digesting her.&quot;

<text>Terrorvision are an English rock band. They were formed in 1987 (as The Spoilt Bratz) in Keighley, West Yorkshire, England, and initially disbanded in 2001. The band used Bradford as a base after the name change to Terrorvision in 1991, by which time the band members had all moved there.

==History==
The re-release of their second single, &quot;My House&quot; (from the album &quot;Formaldehyde&quot;), in January 1994 proved to be Terrorvision&#x27;s breakthrough to UK Singles Chart success, and preceded by months the release of their second album &quot;How to Make Friends and Influence People&quot; in April 1994. The leading single from that album, &quot;Oblivion&quot;, was also a chart success. All subsequent singles achieved Top 40 entries in the UK, culminating in the release of &quot;Tequila&quot;, which reached number 2. The band won the Kerrang! Award for Best Newcomer in 1994, (the award at the time was not split into British and International categories), then followed this up with Best British Band the following year.

A video compilation, &quot;Fired Up and Lairy,&quot; was released in April 1995 and included spoof documentary segments interspersed with all the band&#x27;s videos to date. A third album, &quot;Regular Urban Survivors,&quot; followed in March 1996 and spawned four singles: &quot;Perseverance&quot; (their first Top 5 single, peaking at number 5), &quot;Celebrity Hit List,&quot; &quot;Bad Actress&quot; and &quot;Easy&quot;. Lead singer Tony Wright presented the BBC TV music show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on one occasion, and made several appearances on the comedy music quiz &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot;.

The band&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Shaving Peaches,&quot; appeared in October 1998. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Josephine,&quot; had been well-received the previous month, but it was a Mint Royale remix of &quot;Tequila&quot; which was to prove to be their biggest-ever hit, reaching number 2 in the UK chart in January 1999. That year, the song was awarded Best Single at the Kerrang! Awards.

The choice was a controversial one among fans. The band originally put a selection of their potential single releases to members of their official fan club, who voted in favour of &quot;Day After Day.&quot; However, the remixed version of &quot;Tequila&quot; gained favour with BBC Radio 1 DJ Zoë Ball, who championed its release as a single. Plans to release &quot;Day After Day&quot; were hastily shelved, and a video was quickly shot for the &quot;Tequila&quot; release. A few promo copies of the &quot;Day After Day&quot; single still exist.

Thus, despite having their greatest hit in 1999 with the track, they were dropped by their record label, EMI, after the release of the album&#x27;s third single, &quot;III Wishes.&quot; It was the band&#x27;s first single to fall outside the UK Top 40 since the release of &quot;My House,&quot; six years earlier. During this time the band recruited a fifth member, Josephine Ellul, who played keyboards and sang backing vocals at concerts.

The band signed to a smaller label, Papillon, and put out a fifth studio album, &quot;Good to Go,&quot; in 2001. The record, like all their others, was also credited to Total Vegas, the band&#x27;s own independent imprint. A number of singles followed, but the band was unable to replicate their previous success. Their final single, &quot;Fists of Fury,&quot; gained some notoriety for its video, which aped the cowboy-themed clip accompanying Madonna&#x27;s single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me.&quot;

EMI issued &quot;Whales and Dolphins,&quot; a greatest-hits collection in 2001, and the band decided to call it a day, after a farewell tour. The &#x27;final&#x27; concert took place at Penningtons nightclub in their hometown of Bradford, on 4 October 2001, and was released with an interview DVD as a live album, &quot;Take the Money &amp; Run - The Final Concert.&quot;

===Reunion===
The group reformed to play two tours in 2005, and played what was described as their &#x27;last ever show&#x27; at Rock In The Castle in Scarborough, Yorkshire, on 17 September 2005, as Special Guests of The Wildhearts. A collection of b-sides and rarities was also issued by EMI in September 2005.

Terrorvision then played three dates in November 2007 in Manchester, Holmfirth and Sheffield. Danny Lambert, the singer in Yates&#x27; band Blunderbuss, which was by then inactive, stood in on bass for an unavailable Marklew for these three shows. This was followed by a homecoming show at the Victoria Hall in Saltaire in December 2007 and a new tour in 2008 entitled the &#x27;4 Days in May Tour&#x27; in Nottingham, Bristol, London Shepherd&#x27;s Bush and Norwich UEA, this time with a returned Marklew. They also played three dates over Easter 2009 to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the release of &quot;How to Make Friends and Influence People&quot;, at the Manchester Academy, Wolverhampton&#x27;s Wulfrun Hall, and the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire, London. The gigs at Manchester Academy and Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire offered limited edition live recordings of the shows through &quot;Concert Live&quot;. A similar tour took place in December 2009. On 4 December 2009, Terrorvision played at Hard Rock Hell 3. They returned again in 2010, and began working on a new record. Shutty, their original drummer, left at this stage after 20 years playing with the band and was replaced by Cameron Greenwood.
Terrorvision headlined on the Bohemia Stage at the 2010 Sonisphere festival at Knebworth House. Terrorvision also performed in Holmfirth, Bristol, Cardiff and Bolton in July 2010.

On 13 January 2011, singer Tony Wright announced on Facebook that they would be releasing a new album in 2011, and would be going on a UK tour to support it. The tour was to start in Newcastle on 24 February. The new album, &quot;Super Delux&quot;, was duly released on 24 February 2011 to generally positive reviews.

Terrorvision returned again in 2016 for a five date arena tour of the UK supporting UK rockers Thunder. Bassist Leigh Marklew said, &quot;We were discussing the idea of getting back in the ring in 2016 – when the call came from Thunder the timing was perfect. We agreed it would be a great way to come back.&quot;

In November 2017, a triple-headline tour, called &quot;Britrock Must Be Destroyed&quot;, was announced with Reef and The Wildhearts. The tour was eight dates across the UK in May 2018, and featured full sets from each band, with a different running order each night. In February 2018, UK Britpop band Dodgy were announced as the opening act for all eight dates. In March 2018, the tour was extended to five dates, across August and September, in Australia.

A 25th anniversary tour celebrating &quot;How to Make Friends and Influence People&quot; was announced by the band in a video-post on Facebook in November 2018, with dates at London&#x27;s Islington Assembly Hall, SWX Bristol, Rock City Nottingham, and the O2 Ritz in Manchester in May 2019, with support from The Amorettes.
In December 2019, the group released their first new single for seven years, &quot;Our Christmas Song&quot;.
The band announced their new album, titled &quot;We Are Not Robots&quot; would be released on 20 September 2024.

==Side projects==
After splitting up, singer Tony Wright formed Laika Dog as well as working as a dry stone waller. He has also released two solo albums and an album recorded with Ryan Hamilton. 

Guitarist Mark Yates joined firstly the short-lived Boston Crabs and then formed Blunderbuss, releasing one album to date, &quot;Relentless,&quot; and then formed another new band, Badwolf; whilst Leigh Marklew formed Malibu Stacey, who released one album, &quot;On Heat,&quot; before splitting up. Mark Yates now plays guitar in rock band Boomville alongside Ben Moran, former bass player with Leeds Band Little Black Hearts.

==Covers==
Terrorvision have covered many songs, often as B-sides to their singles. Covers included &quot;Wishing Well&quot; by Free and &quot;Surrender&quot; by Cheap Trick. One of the tracks on the 1992 Problem Solved EP is a cover of Motorhead&#x27;s &quot;We Are The Roadcrew&quot;. Other covers include &quot;Bring Your Daughter... to the Slaughter&quot; by Iron Maiden with a jazz flavour, performed in a Radio One live session, and more recently covered &quot;Oh My God&quot; live during their &#x27;Lost Weekend&#x27; 2007 tour, with stand-in bassist Danny Lambert performing lead vocals. They have also covered 5ive&#x27;s &quot;Keep on Movin&#x27;&quot; and David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Moonage Daydream&quot;.

<text>Starless and Bible Black is the sixth studio album by English progressive rock band King Crimson, released in March 1974 by Island Records in the United Kingdom and by Atlantic Records in the United States. It features most of the personnel which appeared on the group&#x27;s preceding album, &quot;Larks&#x27; Tongues in Aspic&quot;, with only percussionist Jamie Muir not returning, and is the band&#x27;s final album with violinist David Cross as a member, although he would appear on one track on &quot;Red&quot;. Much of the album was recorded live and edited together with studio recordings and overdubs. The album includes multiple fully improvised pieces.

==Background and production==

King Crimson&#x27;s previous album, &quot;Larks&#x27; Tongues in Aspic&quot; (on which they had moved decisively away from a more traditional progressive rock sound drawing on American jazz, and towards the influence of European free improvisation), had been recorded by a quintet lineup including percussionist Jamie Muir. Early in 1973, Muir abruptly left the band, ostensibly due to an onstage injury, but in fact to retire from music and join a monastery (something that was not communicated to his bandmates at that time). Bill Bruford subsequently absorbed Muir&#x27;s percussion role in addition to his own kit drumming, and the band continued to tour as a quartet.

These upheavals and the pressure of touring left King Crimson short of new written material when it came to the time to record their next album. Having increased their level of onstage improvisation during recent tours, the band opted to take advantage of this to solve the problem. New compositions tried out in concert and captured on several live recordings were presented as part of the new album material, alternating and in some cases blending with studio recordings.

The only songs recorded entirely in the studio were &quot;The Great Deceiver&quot; and &quot;Lament&quot;. &quot;We&#x27;ll Let You Know&quot; was an entirely improvised piece recorded in Glasgow. &quot;The Mincer&quot; was a section of another improvised piece recorded in concert at the Volkshaus in Zurich, with Wetton&#x27;s vocals later overdubbed. The other parts of this improvisation were released on the box set &quot;The Great Deceiver&quot; as &quot;The Law of Maximum Distress, Parts One &amp; Two&quot;. &quot;Trio&quot;, &quot;Starless and Bible Black&quot; and &quot;Fracture&quot;, the last of which Robert Fripp has cited as one of the most difficult pieces he has ever played, were recorded live at the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam. The introduction to &quot;The Night Watch&quot; was recorded at this same performance, but the band&#x27;s Mellotron broke down during the performance, meaning that the remainder of the song needed to be recorded in the studio. Live applause was removed from the recordings wherever possible. The complete Amsterdam concert was released in 1997 as &quot;The Night Watch&quot;.
Bruford spent the entirety of &quot;Trio&quot; with his drumsticks crossed over his chest, waiting for the right moment to join in, but eventually realized that the piece was progressing better without him. His decision not to add any percussion was seen by the rest of the band as a crucial choice, and so he received co-writing credit. &quot;Trio&quot; was later included on the 1975 compilation album &quot;A Young Person&#x27;s Guide to King Crimson&quot;, the performance credits of which cite Bruford&#x27;s contribution to the piece as &quot;admirable restraint.&quot;

The track &quot;FraKctured&quot; from the band&#x27;s 2000 album &quot;The ConstruKction of Light&quot; serves as a sequel to &quot;Fracture&quot;.

== Music and lyrics ==

Only four tracks on the album have lyrics; as with &quot;Larks&#x27; Tongues in Aspic&quot;, these were written by John Wetton&#x27;s friend Richard Palmer-James. &quot;The Great Deceiver&quot; refers to Satan and is an ironic comment on commercialism; Fripp contributed the line &quot;cigarettes, ice cream, figurines of the Virgin Mary&quot; after seeing souvenirs being marketed in Vatican City. &quot;Lament&quot; is about fame. &quot;The Night Watch&quot; reflects on Rembrandt&#x27;s painting of the same name. &quot;The Mincer&quot; has more ambiguous lyrics, though lines such as &quot;fingers reaching, linger shrieking&quot;, &quot;you&#x27;re all alone, baby&#x27;s breathing&quot;, and the song&#x27;s title could be references to a home invader or killer. Original issues of the album include the lyrics to &quot;The Great Deceiver,&quot; &quot;Lament&quot; and &quot;The Night Watch&quot; on the album&#x27;s inner sleeve.

The phrase &quot;Starless and Bible Black&quot; is a quotation from the first two lines of Dylan Thomas&#x27; radio drama &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;. The band&#x27;s next album, &quot;Red&quot;, contains a song called &quot;Starless&quot;, which contains the phrase, whereas &quot;Starless and Bible Black&quot; from this album is an edit of an improvised instrumental from the Amsterdam performance.

The album art is by painter Tom Phillips. The phrase &quot;this night wounds time&quot;, which appears on the back cover, is a quotation from Phillips&#x27; &quot;A Humument&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the album &quot;as stunningly powerful as &quot;In the Court of the Crimson King&quot;&quot;, particularly praising the performances of Bruford and Cross and the variety of tones and lengthy instrumental improvisations particularly impressive. They concluded: &quot;Fripp has finally assembled the band of his dreams – hopefully it&#x27;ll stay together long enough to continue producing albums as excellent as this one.&quot;

Robert Christgau&#x27;s review was more ambiguous, deeming it &quot;as close as this chronically interesting group has ever come to a good album&quot;, though he would eventually give higher ratings to &quot;Red&quot; and the live album &quot;USA&quot;.

AllMusic also praised the album&#x27;s variety of tones in their retrospective review, and remarked that the album&#x27;s second side &quot;threw the group&#x27;s hardest sounds right in the face of the listener, and gained some converts in the process.&quot;

== Legacy ==
In 2004, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked it at number 94 in their list of the &quot;Top 100 Albums of the 1970s.&quot;

The Japanese band Acid Mothers Temple recorded an album entitled &quot;Starless and Bible Black Sabbath&quot; in 2006, referencing &quot;Starless and Bible Black&quot; and Black Sabbath&#x27;s 1970 self-titled album.

<text>The Czechoslovakian Grand Prix (; ) was a Grand Prix motor racing event held in 1949 at the Masaryk Circuit now referred to as the Brno Circuit. It was held in the town of Brno in Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic).

The Masaryk circuit race was first held on September 28, 1930. From 1934 onwards, the race was dominated by the German Silver Arrows. In 1937, several spectators were killed or injured when Hermann Lang skidded off the track. The spectators had been in a prohibited area but Lang was sued anyway.

Due to the German occupation in 1938 the race was discontinued until 1949 when the Masaryk Circuit was shortened to .

The 1949 Czechoslovakian Grand Prix raced in the opposite direction than the pre-war races, drew a crowd in excess of 400,000 people. The event was marred by the death of 2 drivers and 2 spectators. This would be the last Czechoslovakian Grand Prix. 

27 years later a Czechoslovak Race was held at the same venue as a round of the European Touring Car Championship. BMW dominated for six years through various models before Jaguar asserted their own dominance. The race became part of the one-off 1987 World Touring Car Championship, but at a new venue, the newly constructed Brno Circuit. The race was won by the Swiss-based factory Ford team. A final race was held the following year as part of the World Sportscar Championship. The Sauber-Mercedes of Jochen Mass and Jean-Louis Schlesser prevented the Tom Walkinshaw team from claiming a fourth win for Jaguar.

<doc id="349571" wikidata="Q204636" url="?curid=349571" title="Battle of Plataea">
<text>The Battle of Plataea was the final land battle during the second Persian invasion of Greece. It took place in 479BC near the city of Plataea in Boeotia, and was fought between an alliance of the Greek city-states (including Sparta, Athens, Corinth and Megara), and the Achaemenid Empire of Xerxes I (allied with Greek states including Boeotia, Thessalia, and Macedon).

At the preceding Battle of Salamis, the allied Greek navy had won an unlikely but decisive victory, preventing the conquest of the Peloponnesus region. Xerxes then retreated with much of his army, leaving his general Mardonius to finish off the Greeks the following year. In the summer of 479BC, the Greeks assembled a huge army and marched out of the Peloponnesus. The Persians retreated to Boeotia and built a fortified camp near Plataea. The Greeks, however, refused to be drawn into the prime terrain for cavalry around the Persian camp, resulting in a stalemate that lasted 11 days. 

While attempting a retreat after their supply lines were disrupted, the Greek battle line fragmented. Thinking that the Greeks were in full retreat, Mardonius ordered his forces to pursue them, but the Greeks, particularly the Spartans, Tegeans and Athenians halted and gave battle, routing the lightly armed Persian infantry and killing Mardonius. A large portion of the Persian army was trapped in its camp and killed. The destruction of this army, and the remnants of the Persian navy allegedly on the same day at the Battle of Mycale, decisively ended the invasion.

==Background==
The Achaemenid Emperor Xerxes I, after his accession, quickly initiated his preparations for an invasion of Greece, including the task of building two pontoon bridges across the Hellespont. A congress of city states met, probably at Corinth, in 481BC, and a confederate alliance of Greek city-states was formed, generally referred to as the Allies.

In August 480BC, after hearing of Xerxes&#x27; approach, a small Allied army led by Spartan King Leonidas I blocked the pass of Thermopylae. Famously, the massively outnumbered Greek army held Thermopylae for three days before being outflanked by the Persians, who used a little-known mountain path. Following Thermopylae, the Persian army proceeded to burn and sack Plataea and Thespiae, the Boeotian cities that had not surrendered, before taking possession of the now-evacuated city of Athens. The Allied army, meanwhile, prepared to defend the Isthmus of Corinth. The ensuing naval Battle of Salamis in 480BC ended in a decisive victory for the Allies, marking a turning point in the conflict. Following the defeat of his navy at Salamis, Xerxes retreated to Sardis with a minor portion of his army.

Xerxes left Mardonius in charge of his troops. Mardonius decided to spend the winter in Thessaly. Mardonius tried to win over the Athenians through the mediation of Alexander I of Macedon. Upon their refusal, the Persians marched south again. Athens was again evacuated and left to the enemy, leading to the second phase of the Destruction of Athens. Mardonius now repeated his offer of peace to the Athenian refugees in Salamis. Athens sent emissaries to Sparta demanding assistance, and threatened to accept the Persian terms if it was not provided. These events occurred sometime in the month of June. According to Herodotus, the Spartans were at that time celebrating the festival of Hyacinthus, and delayed making a decision for ten days, until they were persuaded of the danger to all of Greece if the Athenians surrendered. When the Athenian envoys went to the Spartan &quot;ephors&quot; to deliver an ultimatum, they were told by the ephors that their army had already departed. The 5,000 Spartiates had advanced up the Eurotas River and were now in Oresthasium.

==Order of battle==
===Greeks===
According to Herodotus, the Spartans sent 45,000 men – 5,000 Spartiates (full citizen soldiers), 5,000 other Lacodaemonian hoplites (perioeci) and 35,000 helots (seven per Spartiate). Pausanias, the regent for his cousin Pleistarchus, was chosen to command the Spartan troops. The historian Ian Macgregor-Morris argues that the 5,000 Spartiates sent to Plataea were 3/5th of Sparta&#x27;s troops, while the historian Hans van Wees argues that these 5,000 were all the Spartan citizens fit to serve at the time. The Spartan troops at Plataea might have been the largest army the Spartans had sent beyond the Isthmus of Corinth. Pausanias chose Euryanax to be his deputy commander. Each &quot;phyle&quot; of the Athenians had its own &quot;strategos&quot; (commander).

The historian Nicholas Sekunda argues that Herodotus had assumed that each Greek hoplite was accompanied by a lightly armed attendant from the ranks of the &quot;psiloi,&quot; which had led to Herodotus inflating his numbers for the allied Greek army to 110,000. Sekunda argues that these attendants were present in the Greek camp but not on the battlefield. He further argues that these attendants served as &quot;skeuphoros&quot; (baggage carriers), and were either slaves or the relatives of the hoplites who were too young to serve in the military. In addition to the 35,000 helots, there were also 34,000 light infantry soldiers in the Greek camp. Other than the state of Argos, Mantinea and Elis also did not send their troops. The historian Paul A. Rahe estimates that these two states could have sent 6,000 hoplites, and argues that they did not because of Mardonius&#x27; bribes.

===Achaemenids===
The historian John Francis Lazenby, by comparing the size of the Persian camp to later Roman military camps, calculates the number of troops at 70,000, including 10,000 cavalry. The historian Peter Connolly arrives at a potential total of 120,000 from the size of the camp. Most estimates for the total Persian force are generally in this range. The historian Hans Delbrück, basing his calculations on the distance the Persians marched in a day when Athens was attacked, concluded that 75,000 was the upper limit for the size of the Persian army, including the supply personnel and other non-combatants. Delbrück estimated that the Persian army, including the allied Greeks, totaled 40,000. Konecny estimates that the Persians had around 55,000 to 70,000 infantry, and their camps had anywhere from 120,000 to 150,000 people including the camp followers. Thorax of Larissa and his brothers Eurypylus and Thrasydeius, from the Aleuadae family, were with Mardonius at Plataea.
===Composition and order of battle===
The details of the arrangement of the Persian line were given by Herodotus. The Persians were on the left wing, facing the 11,500 Lacedaemonian and Tegean hoplites. Konecny estimates that these Persians on the left wing numbered around 20,000 to 30,000. To the right of the Persians were the Medes, facing the 6,200 soldiers of Corinth, Potidaea, Orchomenus and Sicyon. Konecny estimates that these Medes numbered around 12,000 to 18,000.

Next to the Medes, the Bactrians were deployed in front of the 3,400 soldiers of Epidaurus, Troezen, Lepreum, Tiryns, Mycenae, and Phlius. Konecny estimates that these Bactrians totaled around 6,000 to 9,000. After the Bactrians were the Indians and Sacae, opposite the 3,300 soldiers of Hermione, Eretria, Styra, Chalcis, Anaktoria, Leucadia, Palea, and Aegina. Konecny estimates that these Indians and Sace totaled around 6,000 to 9,000. The Medes, Bactrians, Indians and Sacae formed the center of the Persian line, numbering around 24,000 to 36,000. Against the 11,600 Athenians, Plataeans and Megarians, were deployed the Boeotians, Locrians, Malians, Thessalians, and the Phocians. Konecny estimates that these troops numbered around 11,000 to 13,000. Thus Konecny estimates that the total Persian infantry numbered around 44,000 to 66,000; and the Persian cavalry around 5,000 to 7,000.

== Logistics and finance ==
 Andreas Konecny estimates that the Greek supply train destroyed by the Persian cavalry had 120 tons of supplies. He estimates that the Greek army at Plataea had a total of 78,000 soldiers and that these supplies would last for two days if each soldier were to receive one &quot;choinix&quot; of rations per day, equivalent to . Konecny estimates that each column had to travel one way, and argues that there were three supply columns in transit at all times in order to supply the Greek army. He argues that at least 500 people accompanied each column. He therefore says that a minimum of 2,000 auxiliaries must have arrived at the Greek camp in the four columns which had already supplied them. Konecny that at least 1,500 auxiliaries were always working the supply lines. 

The historian Nicholas Sekunda argues that the animals in the supply column were pack animals and not oxen, and says that the Persians could only use pack animals after the attack, since oxen could not traverse the unpaved route. Sekunda estimates that the food provisions were at least one &quot;choinix&quot; per day for both the Greek and Persian soldiers. Sekunda also estimates that the supply column disrupted by the Persians had either 58,000 &quot;choinikes&quot; of barley or 47,000 &quot;choinikes&quot; of wheat, half the daily provisions for the 110,000 people in the Greek camp, including the non-combatants.

Sekunda argues that the Greeks had a &quot;common treasury&quot;. He cites Plutarch&#x27;s statement, which says that during the Spartan command of the allied Greeks, the latter paid some type of contribution. The historian Peter Brunt argues that such a treasury could not have existed. Sekunda argues that the Spartans might have had enough time to make financial provisions during the Persian invasions. Based on his estimates for the daily provisions requirements, Sekunda estimates that the daily spending on rations by the Greeks at 10,000 drachmas. He argues that the allied Greeks could have arranged such sums. Sekunda observes that the battle of Plataea was the first instance of a Greek army receiving supplies while encamped on the battlefield, instead of living off the land, getting supplies from allied polities on their route or buying from markets set up by camp followers.Konecny argues that the Spartans had thus mobilized almost all of their fighting age helots to assist on the logistical problems posed by such a large Greek army. He argues that only 10,000 helots were deployed for combat, while the remaining 25,000 helots worked the supply lines. He further claims that if all the 35,000 helots had been on the battlefield, the Greeks couldn&#x27;t have formed their phalanxes before the first Persian charge. Konecny estimates that during Mardonius&#x27; march to Skolos he had traveled around from Athens in two days, while most of his army would have taken around a week. 

Konecny estimates that the allied Greek army required of water daily. The mountain slopes they had deployed on did not have access to freshwater, and carrying such quantities daily was logistically difficult and made them highly vulnerable to attacks by Persian cavalry. Sekunda estimates the daily water requirement at for the 110,000 people in the Greek camp based on a daily requirement of per person. However, these figures do not account for the water requirements of the animals in the Greek camp. 

The historian Paul A. Rahe argues that the Persian supply lines might have extended or more. He argues that the Persians were probably being supplied from Macedonia by land, and from the Hellespont by sea. He notes that the Phocians had not joined the Persian camp, but instead had chosen to stay on Mount Parnassus, where they raided and pillaged the Persian supply columns. 

The historian estimates the daily water requirements for the Persians at 115,000 imperial gallons. Young Jr. posits that the Persians needed of grain daily if they had 70,000 soldiers. He also estimates that they would have needed each of grain and fodder daily if they had 10,000 horses. The Persians would therefore have required of food supplies daily. Young Jr. posits that the Persians would then require 1,709 horses to deliver their supplies each day, assuming each horse could carry and took one day to gather supplies and reach the Persian camp. He argues that a total of 22,217 horses would be required to deliver supplies over the entire 13 days the Persians were encamped at Plataea. 

Young Jr., however, argues that the Persians were bringing in supplies from Lamia in southern Thessaly, which took seven days each way. He thus claims that the Persians would need 35,000 horses for all their supply columns, a number they could not have put together. Young Jr. argues that the Persians at Plataea thus did not total 70,000 infantry and 10,000 cavalry. He argues that the Persians wouldn&#x27;t have issues with supplies if there were large stores at Thebes, which he estimates was from the Persian camp. He argues that the Greeks at Plataea were being resupplied from the Peloponnese, since farming could not be done in both Attica and Boeotia due to the threat posed by the Persians.

==Prelude==

When Mardonius learned of the Spartan force marching to join the allied Greek army, he completed the destruction of Athens, tearing down whatever was left standing. He then retreated towards Boeotia, hoping to lure the Greek army into territory which was advantageous for the Persian cavalry. Mardonius withdrew from Attica through the Decelea defile, passed by Sphendale, crossed the Parnes range, encamped for a night at Tanagra and then marched to Skolos. Mardonius built a fortified encampment around in area on the north bank of the Asopos river in Boeotia, thus covering the ground from Erythres past Hysiae and up to the lands of Plataea.

The Athenians under the command of Aristides joined the Allied army at Eleusis in Attica. The army traveled on the Oenoe road via Panactum, the plains of Skourta and the eastern Pastra mountain, across the passes of Mount Cithaeron and arrived near Plataea. The archaeologist Andreas Konecny estimates that the crossing of Cithaeron took place sometime between late July and mid August. Under the guidance of their commanding general, Pausanias, the Greeks took up positions opposite the Persian lines but remained on high ground. They deployed their lines from Erythrai to Hysiai, and from their positions on the Cithaeron could observe the Persian lines across the Asopos river. The Greek units were camped in order of their positions in the phalanx, so that the formation could be set up easily at the start of battle.

Mardonius initiated hit-and-run cavalry attacks against the Greek lines. During what may have been a reconnaissance patrol, the Persians had noticed a gap in the Greek lines on the western flank. At the foot of a cliff, the Megarians were deployed in terrain accessible to the Persian cavalry, about from the westernmost point of the line. The Megarian line was about wide at the front, of this frontage, about was exposed. The Persian cavalry under the command of Masistius began attacking in continuous waves. Konecny estimates that hundreds of cavaliers were required to attack in each wave. The Megarians requested reinforcements and said they would retreat if these were not sent. 

300 Athenians, hoplites or infantry, and their archers replaced the Megarians at the spot where the Persian cavalry was attacking. These Athenians were commanded by Olympiodoros. The Athenians formed a single or double line formation, and from their rear their archers fired their volleys. An Athenian archer managed to hit Masistius&#x27; horse when the latter was on the frontline opposite the Athenians. Masistius was flung off his horse and landed near the Athenian line, where the soldiers started stabbing him but were unable to kill him as he was wearing scale corslet armor underneath his clothes. Masistius was finally killed when an Athenian soldier stabbed him in the eye. The Persians tried to recover his body but were pushed back by the Greek infantry, which had just arrived to reinforce the Athenians. The Persian cavalry retreated soon after. The Persians mourned the death of Masistius by shaving their hair and chopping off the manes of their animals.

Masistius&#x27; body was paraded on a cart in front of the Greek lines. Their morale boosted by this small victory, the Greeks moved forward, still remaining on higher ground, to a new position near the Asopos river which was more defensible and better watered. The historian estimates that this position was to the left of their initial position, and about from the foothills of Mount Cithaeron. In response to the Greek movement, Mardonius brought his men westward up to the Asopos and arrayed them for battle in a line long. However, neither the Persians nor the Greeks chose to attack; Herodotus claims this is because both sides had received bad omens from their seers. Konecny argues that this is because both of them were waiting for their opponent to attack first. The armies thus stayed camped in their locations for eight days. 

The historian William Shepherd posits that Mardonius did not attack because he wanted to let the Greeks move to open ground, and because he wanted them to let their supply lines become extended and vulnerable. Shepherd also notes that the seers on both sides had predicted victory in a defensive battle, but defeat for the side which crossed the Asopos river. He argues that, at this point, neither Pausanias nor Mardonius might have thought they had enough numbers to attack and win.

On the eighth day after the arrival of the Persian and Greek armies at Plataea, heeding the advice of a Theban named Timagenes, Mardonius set up a lookout on the passes of Mount Cithaeron. At night on the same day, Mardonius dispatched his cavalry to attack a Greek supply convoy, which resulted in the Greek supply lines being halted. The Greeks were attacked by the Persian cavalry for the next two days. He launched another cavalry raid on the Greek lines, which succeeded in blocking the Gargaphian spring, which had been the only source of water for the Greek army, as they could not draw from the Asopos due to the threat posed by Persian archers. The Gargaphian spring was probably to the rear of the Greek position, and the Persian cavalry might have been behind the Greek lines when it blocked the spring.The Greeks had now been encamped at their second position for 12 days. The lack of food and the destruction of their water supply made the Greek position untenable, so they decided to retreat to a position in front of Plataea, where they could guard the passes and have access to fresh water. To prevent the Persian cavalry from attacking during the retreat, it was to be performed that night. The position the Greeks chose for their retreat was named the &quot;island&quot;, at a distance of about from both the Asopos river and the Gargaphian spring. The &quot;island&quot; was around wide according to Lazenby; and wide according to Rahe. The banks of the &quot;island&quot; protected against cavalry attacks, and to the south of the &quot;island&quot; were the passes where the Greek supply columns were stuck. During the day chosen for the retreat, the Greeks underwent constant attacks by the Persian cavalry. 

Meanwhile, the Persians were considering a retreat to Thebes where they had stored much food, as well as fodder for their pack animals. This withdrawal was proposed by Artabazos, who also advised bribing the commanders of the Greek states while defending their new position. Artabazos probably wanted to make the Greeks cross the Asopos river while chasing his army and make them fight on the northern bank of the Asopos. Mardonius rejected this proposal because he believed his army was superior to the Greeks and because he wanted to fight the Greeks before they received more reinforcements.

However, the retreat went awry. The Allied contingents in the centre began their movement late at night, and perhaps because they were not aware of the new terrain, ended up advancing past the island to arrive at the Temple of Hera. The Tegeans and Spartans on the right wing were chosen to advance to the Cithaeron passes and accompany the stuck supply convoys to the new Greek position. However, these units had not even begun to retreat by daybreak. This was because a Spartan commander, Amompharetus, refused to retreat because he thought it was cowardly. While the rest of the Spartans retreated, his &quot;lochos&quot; was left behind.

Meanwhile the Athenians and Plataeans had also been unable to retreat, because their path had been blocked by the scattered centre. The Athenians sent a messenger to Pausanias asking for his new directive. Pausanias asked the Athenians to retreat to the Cithaeron passes and not to the &quot;island&quot;, and join the Spartans if possible. This message was received before daybreak but the Athenians began moving only after dawn. Konecny posits that Aristides may have wanted to avoid the chaos of nighttime movements. Pausanias then marched to the north of modern Erythres, and the Greeks of the scattered center started to converge on his position, though the latter probably took longer to get into formation. Pausanias&#x27; two units, however, were the first ones ready for contact when the Persian cavalry arrived.

The Persian cavalry had begun to mobilize for attacking by this time. However, because Amompharetus and his unit were still in their line of sight, they did not rush, perhaps thinking that all of their opponent&#x27;s army was just ahead of Amompharetus&#x27; unit. This might have allowed Pausanias to execute his retreat safely, and given Amompharetus enough time to withdraw. When the Persian cavalry arrived at the Greek position, they found it decamped and conveyed this information to Mardonius through a messenger. Rahe estimates that the date for this final battle was the 27th or 28th of August. The historian Theodore Cuyler Young Jr. also estimates the date of the battle to be the 27th of August.

==Battle==

During the retreat of the Greeks on the 13th day after their arrival, all of their center wing left the field while their right wing initially did not budge. The Spartans and Tegeans had by now reached the Temple of Demeter. The rearguard under Amompharetus began to withdraw from the ridge to join them. Konecny argues that the Spartans already had Amompharetus&#x27; lochos in their formation when the first units of the Persian cavalry started attacking. The historian Andrew Robert Burn argues that the Persian wings by now were converging on the Greek position. He argues that if the Spartans and Athenians had merged, they could have attacked a Persian flank.

Konecny estimates that Pausanias&#x27; line, which had 11,500 soldiers, was long, assuming it was 8 ranks deep and each soldier took up of space. Pausanias asked the Athenians to reinforce his troops, but the latter had been engaged by the phalanx of the Thebans and Mardonius&#x27; Greeks, and were unable to assist Pausanias. Konijnendijk argues that the Spartans&#x27; flank had been attacked by the Persians, and notes that Pausanias had asked the Athenians to deploy their archers, who were tactically needed against the Persian archers and missileers, if they could not deploy all of their army.

Meanwhile, Mardonius had learned of the Greek retreat and rushed to Pausanias&#x27; position with the Persian left wing he was personally commanding. They had marched around from their camp behind the Asopos river to the Argiopios. The Greeks had put up their shields at their front line and were fighting the Persian cavalry. The Persians were not advancing in a formation but managed to form their lines opposite the Greek phalanx. Konecny argues that the distance between both fronts might have been . Another estimate for the distance between the Greek and Persian lines is . When the Persian infantry arrived, the Persian cavalry temporarily withdrew to rest their mounts and refill their arsenal. By now, the Persians had formed their shield wall and their archers continued to fire while covered behind it. The Persian Immortal lines were probably ten files deep, where &quot;sparabara&quot; were on the front wearing scaled iron corslets, armed with spears, bows and shields. The nine soldiers to the rear were armed with bows and spears, or axes.
According to Herodotus, Pausanias refused to advance because he was waiting for good omens. At this point, as Greek soldiers began to fall under the barrage of arrows, the Tegeans started to run at the Persian lines. Pausanias finally received favorable omens and ordered the Spartans to also charge the Persian lines. Konecny argues that the Persian arrow volleys were dispiriting for the Greeks, since their arrows might have managed to hit undefended gaps and body parts. 

The Spartans and Tegeans had started to push into the Persian lines. The Greeks started thrusting their spears at the Persian shield wall, and some of them tried to break the Persians&#x27; shields. The Persians put aside their bows and tried to break the Greeks&#x27; spears by grabbing hold of them, but failed. At this point, the hoplites might have closed the distances between each other and huddled together tightly. They started pushing against the Persians, who were risking asphyxiation because they were not accustomed to such fighting. The Persians may have stepped back a little and sent small groups to attack portions of the Greek line, in order to drive them away from the contingent that was pushing forward. 

Konijnendijk argues that the Greeks formed an open phalanx and not a closed one. He argues that the Spartans then formed a defensive line, thus pulling the Persians in towards them. He argues that the continuing use of ballistic weapons and small clashes along the lines reduced numbers on both sides, however, the Greeks did not break ranks and retreat. Meanwhile, the Spartans had outnumbered the Persians guarding Mardonius. Konijnendijk argues that these Persians inflicted many casualties on the Spartans till Aeimnestus, a soldier, hurled a stone at Mardonius and killed him. Artabazos did not agree with Mardonius about attacking the Greeks. He had arranged the 40,000 soldiers under his command in a tight formation and advanced slowly. As the rout commenced, he led these men away from the battlefield to Phocis, avoiding their camp and escaping eventually to the Hellespont.

Mardonius&#x27; death hit the morale of his guards, and once they broke their lines and retreated, the rest of the Persian army did so too. However, the Athenians still had to fight the Thebans who were pitted up against them. Eventually, the Thebans retreated. Meanwhile, the Persian cavalry did not let the Greeks pursue and outflank the rest of the retreating Persian army. Konijnendijk argues that it is puzzling that these cavaliers did not participate in the fight fully at this point, and notes that perhaps they were following standard Persian cavalry tactics.

The historian Robert Gaebel argues that the Persian cavalry who had covered the retreat of the Persian army were actually Boiotian cavalry, particularly the Theban cavalry led by Asopodoros, the son of Timandros. Gaebel observes that Herodotus had written about these cavalry units attacking the Greek center and inflicting 600 casualties on them, while the Thebans had suffered 300 casualties during this attack. Gaebel estimates that the Greek center had 3,500 to 4,000 soldiers, while the Theban cavalry had a maximum of 1,000 soldiers. 

Gaebel argues that the Thebans had managed to inflict disproportionate casualties on the Greek center because the latter had not formed their phalanx and were running astray. Gaebel notes that the Megarians had already been attacked successfully by Persian cavalry previously, and should not have risked advancing in open plains where the opponent&#x27;s cavalry was also present. The Theban cavalry probably attacked the rushing Greek center before Pausanias had won against Mardonius, and later these cavalry forces protected those retreating to Thebes.

The Greeks chased the Persians to their camp after the latter&#x27;s defeat. The Spartans arrived first and waited for the Athenians, who knew how to scale the walls. The Tegeans were the first ones to breach the walls. The Persians could not get into formation and took heavy losses; Herodotus estimates that only 3,000 Persians survived the fighting at the camp. Konecny argues that 3,000 actually might have been the number of prisoners taken by the Greeks, while the other Persians in the camp fled, whose numbers Herodotus might not have discovered.

==Accounts of individuals==
Herodotus recounts several anecdotes about the conduct of specific Spartans during the battle.

*Amompharetus: The leader of a battalion (&quot;lochos&quot;) of Spartans (specifically Pitanates), he refused to undertake the night-time retreat towards Plataea before the battle, because he thought it was cowardly. At dawn, the rest of the Spartan army finally began to retreat, leaving Amompharetus&#x27; division behind. Amompharetus eventually led his men to join the retreating Spartans. Spartan tradition remembers Amompharetus as winning great renown at Plataea, and it has thus been suggested that Amompharetus, far from being insubordinate, had instead volunteered to guard the rear.
*Aristodemus: The lone Spartan survivor of the Battle of Thermopylae, Aristodemus was branded a coward. Anxious to redeem his name, he charged the Persian lines by himself, but was killed. Although the Spartans agreed that he had redeemed himself, they awarded him no special honour, because he had failed to fight in the disciplined manner expected of a Spartan.
*Callicrates: Considered the &quot;most beautiful man in the whole Greek camp&quot;, Callicrates was eager to distinguish himself that day as a warrior, but was deprived of the chance by an arrow that pierced him while he was sitting behind his shield.
==Aftermath==
According to Herodotus, the Battle of Mycale occurred on the same day as Plataea. After the twin victories of Plataea and Mycale, the second Persian invasion of Greece was over. Moreover, the threat of future invasions was abated; although the Greeks remained worried that Xerxes would attempt an invasion again, over time it became apparent that the Persian desire to conquer Greece was much diminished. The Spartan hoplites who died were buried in two different graves, while the helots were buried in a third one. Those buried at the first grave were either priests (&quot;irees&quot;) or &quot;young men in their twenties&quot; (&quot;irenes&quot;). In the first grave were buried Poseidonius, Philokyon, Amompharetus and Callicrates. The Spartans present at the battle had declared Poseidonius the most valiant among them. Sophanes of Athens was also said to have fought valorously. According to Herodotus, there were four other tombs built by the allied Greeks: one each for the Athenians and Tegeans, and two for the Megarians and Phleiasians. Fallen soldiers from other Greek states were probably buried in a common grave. Herodotus had also remarked that the tombs built by these other Greek states were vacant. Sacrifices were offered at these tombs in Plataea annually.

After the battle, Pausanias did not permit the desecration of Mardonius&#x27; corpse as revenge for the mutilation of Leonidas&#x27; body, a proposal put forth by Lampon of Aegina. Pausanias had also freed a Coan women, who had been captured and put into concubinage in the Persian camp. According to Thucydides, after the battle, Pausanias had offered at &quot;the &quot;agora&quot; (public square) of Plataea a sacrifice to Zeus Eleutherios&quot;. A marble altar was constructed for the deity and sacrifices continued to be offered to him in Plataea. The goddess Homonoia (Concord) was also added to the altar. The Athenians also built the Stoa of Zeus in their city&#x27;s &quot;agora&quot; to honor Zeus Eleutherios, who had helped them in their victory against the Persians at Plataea. The Stoa was used to store the shields of the Athenians who had fallen at Plataea. 

The allied Greek army rested for ten days, then proceeded to siege Thebes and rebuke those among the city&#x27;s politicians who had advocated for the Persian cause. Attaginus, the foremost medizing politician, escaped; his sons were pardoned by Pausanias. However, all the other remaining medisers were executed without being tried, because it was believed they were going to evade punishment through bribery. The Spartans did not send any troops for the allied effort after the battle; the historian Marcello Lupi contends that the Spartans did so because they did not have any naval experience, because they believed their soldiers could have been corrupted by the Persians, and because they wanted to solidify their dominance in the Peloponnese. The allied forces were commanded by the Athenians for the remainder of the war.

The Mantineans and Eleans were delayed in their arrival at Plataea. After the battle, both states exiled those among their leaders who were responsible for the delay. Hegesistratus, an Elean, was working for Mardonius at Plataea, but was later captured in Zacynthus and executed. The city of Caryae, according to Vitruvius, had medized during the Persian invasion. After the battle of Plataea, the city was captured by the allied Greeks, the city&#x27;s men were executed and the women were enslaved.

The remnants of the Persian army, under the command of Artabazos, tried to retreat to Asia Minor. Travelling through the lands of Thessaly, Macedonia and Thrace by the shortest road, Artabazos eventually made it back to the Hellespont, though losing many soldiers to Thracian attacks, weariness and hunger. After the victory at Mycale, the Allied fleet sailed to the Hellespont to break down the pontoon bridges, but found that this had already been done. The Peloponnesians sailed home, but the Athenians remained to attack the Chersonesos, still held by the Persians. There was a Persian garrison in Sestos, the strongest town in the region, and the Athenians laid siege to them there. After a protracted siege Sestos fell to the Athenians. 

In Sestos, the medizing general Artayctes was crucified and his son was stoned to death by Xanthippus, an Athenian general. According to Plutarch, Alexander the Great, during his invasion of Persia, had recognized that the victory at Plataea had paved the way for his conquest. The battle is said to have laid the way for Athenian hegemony in the Aegean, the end of the Achaemenid power and the concurrent conquests of Alexander.

=== Spoils ===

The cuirass armor of Masistius, the Persian cavalry commander, was displayed at the shrine of Athena Polias in the Erechtheion, located in the Acropolis complex in Athens, and was still to be found at the same location in the 2nd centuryAD. The geographer Pausanias had seen a sword, said to be Mardonius&#x27; acinaces, in the Acropolis. Pausanias had also said the tomb of Mardonius was open to the public in his time. The manger of Mardonius&#x27; horse, fabricated in bronze and captured by the Tegeans, was gifted to the Temple of Athena Alea in Tegea. The loot pillaged from the Persians was sold to fund the construction of multiple buildings, like the Athenian Treasury at Delphi. It is possible that originals, misattributions or replicas of the Persian spoils from Plataea were stored at the Acropolis complex, particularly in the Parthenon.

The historian Irene de Jong argues that the spoils of the Persian wars were instrumental in advancing the Athenian assimilation of Persian culture. She argues that Pausanias had sent the helots, and not the Greek regulars, to collect the loot either because he wanted it to be distributed fairly, or because he wanted most of it for himself. However, the helots did steal some of the loot while collecting the luxury articles and the armor and gear of the fallen Persian soldiers. She argues that the loot was a windfall, composed of riches which were greater than what the Greeks were accustomed to. The loot included tents, couches, vessels, cauldrons, weapons and armor; all of these were fashioned in either gold, silver or bronze. Three artifacts, made of gold and bronze and created from the Persian spoils, were offered to the gods. A tripod was dedicated to Apollo at Delphi, and one statue each to Zeus at Olympia and to Poseidon at the Isthmus of Corinth.

de Jong notes that the Greek soldiers had divided between themselves the &quot;women, horses, talents, camels and yoke animals&quot; captured from the Persian camp. She also notes that the Plataeans later come about treasure chests in the area. She notes that Herodotus was surprised when the colorful Persian garments, which he was very interested in, were not taken by the Greeks sent to pick up the loot. She notes how Pausanias had, after the battle, asked the Persian and Spartan cooks to prepare meals for him. Observing the difference between the two, and also the luxurious nature of the Persian furniture and decor in Mardonius&#x27; tent, he had asked the other Greek commanders to come over. Pausanias then pointed out these luxuries and told them it was absurd for the Persians, who lived luxurious lifestyles, to invade the Greeks, who lived austerely. She argues that this experience had attracted Pausanias to the luxurious Persian lifestyle and might have led to his medism, especially since he had claimed and received a greater share of the loot at Plataea.

One-tenth of all the Persian loot was given to Pausanias and not to the state of Sparta. This disproportionate distribution was concerning for the Spartans, especially because Pausanias had not dedicated any of his spoils to the gods&#x27; temples. Herodotus had observed that the gains from Spartan victories could have endangered the very fabric of their society. He had also noted the concerns of the &quot;homoioi&quot; about the loot from the Persian wars. The historian Ellen Millender argues that the desire to acquire spoils and glory led to Spartan leaders initiating multiple endless wars, which destabilized Sparta. According to Herodotus, the helots mistakenly sold the gold items to the Aeginetans at the price of bronze, and the latter acquired their wealth because of this. Millender argues that this anecdote, and Pausanias&#x27; insistence on sending the helots to strip the loot from the dead Persians, were instances where Sparta wanted to insult the helots and make them negative examples for its citizens. The historian Ray Nyland argues that this anecdote by Herodotus might be false because Aigina had been a wealthy commercial center in the preceding century; and further argues that this was an instance of Herodotus disparaging the Aeginetans.

The historian Caroline Vout argues that the Greek soldiers and generals were reminded to pay the &quot;gods&quot; their due share, which was one-tenth of the total loot, while the rest was distributed among the allied Greek states. She argues that the focus was on the Persian gold, which was melted down to create, among other items, the Delphic Tripod, which later became the Serpent Column. She argues that the battle of Plataea was an anomaly in the sense of the loot it begot, perhaps because Xerxes&#x27; royal tent, which had extensive supplies, was retained for Mardonius&#x27; stay and later plundered. She further argues that the victories at Plataea and Mycale heralded the Greek incorporation of Persian culture, and also increased the significance assigned to Persian articles.

==Legacy==

A bronze column in the shape of intertwined snakes, the Serpent Column, was created from melted-down Persian armor, acquired during the plunder of the Persian camp, and was erected at Delphi. It commemorated all the 31 Greek city-states that had participated in the battle, listing them on the &quot;coils&quot; of the column. Most of the column still survives in the Hippodrome of Constantinople in present-day Istanbul, where it was carried by Constantine the Great during the founding of his city on the Greek colony of Byzantium.

The poet Simonides of Ceos was instrumental in commemorating the victory at Plataea. He wrote an encomium and an elegy about the battle. The historian Marcello Lupi contends that these texts were commissioned by the Spartans, possibly by Pausanias, since they glorify both of them. In Spartan propaganda, the victory at Plataea was seen as having avenged the Spartan defeat at Thermopylai. A festival dedicated to Zeus Eleutherios was initiated in order to honor the Greeks who had died during the battle. This festival was the Eleutheria, a race where the competitors ran for while carrying a shield and wearing full body armor.

The historian Christel Müller argues that Plataea became a &quot;lieu de mémoire&quot; (place of memory) because of the battle. According to Herodotus, some Greek city-states had built cenotaphs for the people who would come to visit the site in the future. Müller argues they had built these cenotaphs because they were ashamed at not having taken part in the battle. Nyland notes that this was actually Herodotus&#x27; view. Lazenby argues that these states indeed had suffered casualties in the battle, but were either unable to recover their soldiers&#x27; bodies, or had buried their fallen soldiers in a collective grave; and put up their own cenotaphs later. Aeimnestus, who had killed Mardonius, was commemorated at the temple of Athena Areia in Plataea, established with 80 talents taken from the spoils.

== Historiography ==
Herodotus&#x27; account says that the Corinthians did not follow Pausanias&#x27; orders and did not participate in the battle. Simonides, however, says they played a major part in the battle. In the History of the Peloponnesian War by Thucydides, the Syracusan commander Hermocrates says Persian errors and lack of supplies were the reason for their defeat; and also says the Persian army was not bigger than the allied Greek army. In another instance in Thucydides&#x27; work, the Corinthians also say that the Greeks won due to Persian mistakes. However, Thucydides might be voicing his own thoughts here, conforming to his negative views on the Persian Wars.

Ctesias, a Greek physician at the court of Artaxerxes II, had written an account of the battle, largely drawn from Persian sources. Diodorus Siculus had based his account largely on works by Ephorus. Plutarch cited Idomeneus of Lampsacus and Simonides for his account. Nyland argues that the sources for the contingent of Olympiodoros relieving the Megarians could be the relatives of Lampon of Thurii, the son of Olympiodoros. Nyland further argues that the source for Amompharetus&#x27; refusal to retreat is likely to be an Athenian; because Amompharetus is said to have cast his vote using a stone, which was not a Spartan practice but an Athenian one. Nyland also argues that the Greeks Herodotus had consulted for his narrative of Plataea hadn&#x27;t fought in the battle, while the medizing Greeks and Persians he had consulted were highly likely to have fought. Nyland argues that these medizing Greeks were the primary sources for Herodotus&#x27; account of Plataea, and argues that Herodotus did not cite them explicitly because they were not considered reliable due to their medism.

== Analysis ==
=== Strategy and technology===
The historian Roel Konijnendijk argues that technological advantages, if these existed, were not among the reasons for the Greek victory over the Persians at Plataea. He argues that there were multiple other reasons for the outcome of the battle. He claims that the Persians&#x27; iron cuirass armor was of better quality than the Greek bronze cuirass armor. Konijnendijk states that only some soldiers of both armies worn armor, and that their numbers were not greater than 10%. He thus postulates that the Greeks did not have better armor than the Persians. He argues that it was not the Greeks but the Persian soldiers who were &quot;uniformly trained and equipped for close combat&quot;. He claims that the Persian shield wall was the Greeks&#x27; target during the early clashes, and that the Persian Immortals had kept fighting even after the shield wall broke, but stopped after their commander Mardonius was killed. He also notes that the Spartans were the only experienced and skilled soldiers in the Greek camp, and that all the other Greek soldiers were amateurs. 

Konijnendijk notes the dominance of the Persian cavalry over the Greek infantry, and how the former had initiated the battle at Plataea. He argues that these cavaliers could fire arrows and javelins at the Greeks without coming within the range of the latter&#x27;s spears; and that the Persian infantry inflicted much damage on the Spartans, who did not have long-range weapons to counter and defend themselves. He also observes how the Persians used their archers for area denial by putting the banks of the Asopos river within their arrows&#x27; range and thus cutting off the Greeks&#x27; source of fresh water. Konijnendijk argues that the Greeks could have lost at Plataea if their army had been all hoplites, and that the light infantry missileers, who were two-thirds of the Greek army, could counter the Persians&#x27; long-range weapons more effectively. He argues that these missileers sought cover behind the hoplite shields at Plataea. He argues that Pausanias knew the hoplites were weaker in such a scenario and that archers were needed.

Konijnendijk notes that the Greeks had sent hoplites and archers for the first few skirmishes, and that the archers had managed to turn these into a pitched battle by injuring the Persian commander&#x27;s horse. He argues that the Persians had advantages in mobility, range, flexibility and lethality over the Greeks. He argues that the Persians could have outflanked the Greeks easily, but they did not because they actually did not outnumber the Greeks by a lot. He also argues that Mardonius normally would not propose a duel of champions between the Persian Immortals and Greek hoplites because it would reduce his numerical advantage. Konijnendijk argues that Mardonius had proposed the duel because he wanted to reduce the Greeks&#x27; numbers, and postulates that the Greeks may have been the ones who outnumbered the Persians, since the latter feared the size of the former&#x27;s army. Konijendjik argues that the Persian strategy was to pursue a lengthened war and thus force a Greek retreat, since the latter had limited access to supplies and water. He argues that the Greek strategy was to pull the Persians into a pitched battle, because the former were logistically constrained while managing their large army for long; and because they might have believed the terrain was advantageous for them.

Konijnendijk argues that both the Greeks and Persians had depleted their supplies before the final battle. Mardonius may have decided on attacking first because the Greek victory at the Battle of Salamis and the Battle of Mycale threatened his line of communications and routes for retreating. He argues that the Persians lost the battle because they did not deploy their cavalry fully in the final battle, and also because their morale had shattered after Mardonius&#x27; death. He further argues that the Greeks did not win because of presumed technological superiority, but because of their consistent refusal to break and their sustained strong morale.

The historian George Cawkwell argues that the Greek inactivity during the first 10 days of the battle did not reflect well on their commander Pausanias. He further argues that all the Greek generals had had no hopes of victory before the final battle commenced. He argues that the Persians&#x27; continuous cavalry attacks had been successful, and thus Mardonius&#x27; decision to attack and use all of his troops is puzzling. He claims that Mardonius&#x27; decision to use all of his cavalry for a charge indicates that the Persians were anyways going to attack the Greeks, even if they had not known the latter were going to retreat or move their camps. Cawkwell argues that the reason for the Persian attack had been a shortage of supplies, since their food stocks were going to run out in a few days, which was also why Artabazos had advocated for retreating to Thebes. 

Cawkwell argues that the major lesson of Plataea was the reinforcement of the superiority of the hoplite over Persian light infantry. After the Greco-Persian Wars, the Persian empire started recruiting and relying on Greek mercenaries. Cawkwell observes that, after the battle, the Persians started to deploy their cavalry in front of their infantry, while previously they deployed their cavalry at the center and the flanks of their infantry. Cawkwell further claims that the Persians had developed their Cardaces infantry corps as their counter to Greek infantry. Cawkwell also argues that Greece, which could have been a new Persian satrapy, was lost due to the defeat at Plataea, and not due to the defeat at Salamis. 

The archaeologist Andreas Konecny argues that the Greek position near Mount Cithaeron had been very well suited for defence, but they could not have defeated the Persians without fighting a pitched battle. According to Konecny, there were two reasons the Greeks had to fight a pitched battle: because their phalanx armies were not suitable for a war of attrition or maneuver warfare, which the Persian invasion would transform into; and because they did not have the required logistical support. Konecny argues that if the Greeks hadn&#x27;t fought a pitched battle, the Greek alliance would break apart after entering its third year. Konecny argues that there were large contingents of non-combatants in the Persian camps. He argues that their presence led to the size of Mardonius&#x27; army being inflated. Konecny also claims that the Greeks did not have any strategic plans during the retreat, and were instead making tactical movements to avoid being defeated. He further argues that the Greek commanders did not protect their supply lines or routes for retreating.Konecny argues that after learning of the Greek retreat, Mardonius hurried with the Persian left wing in order to pull ahead of the Greek rear and attack them, because he probably thought that the Greeks had not formed their phalanx yet. Konecny cites Herodotus to observe that these Persians under Mardonius were not in formation, while the Greeks under Pausanias were. Konecny argues that if Mardonius had executed a proper systematic attack or if Artabazos had reinforced him earlier, the Persians might have won, or at least suffered fewer casualties. Konecny further claims that had the Persians not chased the Greeks after their retreat to the &quot;island&quot;, the alliance of the latter would eventually break.

The historian John Francis Lazenby observes that the run-up to Plataea had resembled that at the Battle of Marathon in some ways; there was a prolonged stalemate in which neither side risked attacking the other. The reasons for this stalemate were primarily tactical, and similar to the situation at Marathon; the Greek hoplites did not want to risk being outflanked by the Persian cavalry and the lightly armed Persian infantry could not hope to assault well-defended positions. Lazenby argued that Mardonius&#x27; actions during the Plataea campaign did not conform to an aggressive policy. He interprets the Persian operations during the prelude not as attempts to force the Allies into battle, but as attempts to force them to retreat. Mardonius may have felt he had little to gain in battle and that he could simply wait for the Greek alliance to fall apart, as it nearly had during the previous winter season. The historian Paul A. Rahe argues that Mardonius lost because he had crossed the Asopos and fielded his infantry on terrain where his cavalry could not fight. Rahe argues that Pausanias&#x27; retreat to the foothills was a feigned retreat, designed to lure the Persians into terrain where their cavalry could not operate.

=== Formations ===
Konecny argues that the phalanx formed by all the hoplites was long if it was 8 files deep. He argues that all the Spartan helots were not deployed on the battlefield, because the 35,000 helots in the seven rows to the back plus the 5,000 Spartiates in the front would make the phalanx long. The historian Peter Hunt argues that all the helots were deployed in the Spartan formation. Hunt notes that the Athenian center at Marathon was only a few ranks deep and did not have light infantry in its ranks, and argues that it broke because of this reason. Hunt argues that the Spartans had the helots as light infantry in their formation at Plataea in order to form long lines which could counter the Persians.

Konijnendijk and historian Paul M. Bardunias observe that Plataea was the first battle since Thermopylai and the last battle ever where the Persian Immortals fought the Spartan hoplites. They argue that multiple features of a typical hoplite battle are missing in Herodotus&#x27; narrative of Plataea, however, later authors have guessed they were. They argue that the general narrative of Plataea as a phalanx battle is contrary to the evidence. They note that Herodotus had provided any details about the depth of the Greek ranks at Plataea, but had written about the greater depth of the Persian ranks. They thus argue that the Greek forces at Plataea were not arrayed in grids, and did not fight in the manner of Classical hoplite phalanxes. They note that the Spartans at Plataea did not execute the movements attributed to them by later authors like Xenophon.

Konijnendijk and Bardunias argue that the helots were indeed deployed alongside the other Spartans during the final battle, and were not auxiliaries. They argue that the Spartan formation could not have been eight ranks deep with one hoplite in front and seven light infantry to the rear. They argue that such a line was long, which is not possible on Plataea&#x27;s terrain. They also observe that the Persian Immortals could not have formed a line of similar length. They note that the Spartan phalanxes were eight ranks deep in only one instance in recorded history. They argue that the Greeks formed a defensive line during the final battle, sent small groups out to provoke the Persians into breaking their formations, and only then did they start pushing like Classical hoplite phalanxes. They argue that the Greeks did not form tight phalanxes, and instead kept some distance between each soldier to allow individual soldiers to attack.

Konijnendijk and Bardunias note that the Spartans may have arranged their units according to their &quot;syssitia&quot; (meal groups). They argue that the Spartan line had a depth of four ranks, while some other columns on the line had greater depth, arrayed together in a &quot;rough formation&quot;. They posit that the Persians lost because of overspecialization. They postulate that Plataea was a battle of shield walls, where the Greeks won because their shield wall was capable of movement, sending out skirmishers and moving in on their opponent. The Persian shield wall, on the other hand, was better for shielding archers, missileers and cavalry. They observe that the &quot;sparabara&quot; (heavy infantry) were the only Persians who could face off against the hoplites in close quarters, and when the former were defeated, the outmatched light infantry had to fight the hoplites. They note that the Persians could not retreat quickly, and their cavalry, which could have assaulted the Greek flanks, did not engage, perhaps because of adverse terrain. The battle of shield walls at Plataea, according to them, was a phase in the development of Greek combat, where it morphed from &quot;fluid&quot; combat in Archaic Greece into Classical hoplite phalanxes.

===Casualties===
The Greek casualties at Plataea were 652 according to Herodotus, 1360 according to Plutarch and 10,000 according to Diodorus. Konecny notes that the second estimate indicated a casualty rate of 4% for the Greeks. Herodotus probably could not estimate the total casualties among the Spartan &quot;perioikoi&quot;. He had also estimated that there were a total of 52 Athenian casualties. The Greek writer Cleidemus had posited that Herodotus had come across a memorial to the casualties incurred by the &quot;phyle&quot; (tribe) of Aiantis, and assumed these were the total Athenian casualties. The historians Michael Flower and John A. Marincola argue that Herodotus had given the Greek casualties only for the final day of the battle. The historian Peter Hunt notes that Herodotus did not state the casualties incurred by the &quot;perioikoi&quot;, and argues that they could not have emerged unscathed from the Persian arrow volleys.

<text>A wand is a thin, light-weight rod that is held with one hand, and is traditionally made of wood, but may also be made of other materials, such as metal, bone or stone. Long versions of wands are often styled in forms of staves or sceptres, which could have large ornamentation on the top.

In modern times, wands are usually associated with stage magic or supernatural magic, but there have been other uses, all stemming from the original meaning as a synonym of and virge. A stick that is used for reaching, pointing, drawing in the dirt, and directing other people, is one of the earliest and simplest of tools.

==History==
It is possible that wands were used by pre-historic peoples. It is mentioned that &#x27;rods&#x27; (as well as rings) were found with Red Lady of Paviland in Britain. It is mentioned in &quot;Gower – A Guide to Ancient and Historic Monuments on the Gower Peninsula&quot; that these might have been wands and are depicted as such in a reconstruction drawing of the burial of the &#x27;Red Lady&#x27;.

During the Middle Kingdom of Egypt, apotropaic wands began to be used during birth ceremonies. These wands were made out of hippopotamus tusks which were split down the middle lengthwise, producing two wands, each with one flat side and one curved side. Due to the curved nature of a hippopotamus tusk, these wands were curved, with one pointed end (the point of the tusk) and one blunt end (where the tusk was removed from the hippopotamus). Hippopotamus tusks may have been used to invoke Taweret the hippopotamus goddess of childbirth. The earliest apotropaic wands used in Egypt were undecorated, but &quot;from around 1850 BC, they were usually provided with decorations of apotropaic figures directly related to the sun religion, or particular aspects of it, inscribed on the convex upper side... most of whom carry knives to ward off evil forces&quot;. These apotropaic wands were also inscribed with protective text on the flat side, such as &quot;Cut off the head of the enemy when he enters the chamber of the children whom the lady... has borne&quot;. The latest apotropaic wand found belongs to the Second Intermediate Period king Senebkay. It seems that the use of these objects in Egypt declines after this point.

The Barsom used by Zoroastrian Magi is a bundle of twigs that was used during religious ceremonies. While the Barsom is not a wand itself, it was also used for divination purposes, and may be a form of prototypical wand from which later magical wands descend.

The concept of magic wands was used by the ancient Greek writer Homer, in his epic poems &quot;The Iliad&quot; and &quot;The Odyssey&quot;. In all cases, Homer used the word &quot;rhabdos&quot; (ῥάβδος), which means &#x27;rod&#x27;, and implies something that is thicker than the modern conception of wands. In those books, Homer wrote that magic wands were used by three different gods, namely Hermes, Athena, and Circe. In &quot;The Iliad&quot;, Homer wrote that Hermes generally used his magic wand Caduceus to make people sleep and wake up. In &quot;The Odyssey&quot;, Homer wrote that Athena used her magic wand to make Odysseus old, and then young again, and that Circe used her magic wand to turn Odysseus&#x27;s men into pigs.

By the 1st century AD, the wand was a common symbol of magic in Roman cults, especially Mithraism. In the 3rd and 4th centuries, there are frequent depictions on sarcophagi of Jesus Christ according to one opinion using a magic wand to perform miracles, such as the raising of Lazarus and feeding the multitude. Others scholars disagree with that, claiming that these objects are staffs since images of Christ with it &quot;appear alongside images of Moses performing miracles with the staff&quot;.

Italian fairy tales put wands into the hands of the powerful fairies by the Late Middle Ages.

==Mystical and religious usage==
Wands are used in the Enochian magic of John Dee, the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, Thelema, and Wicca, and by independent practitioners of magic.

Wands were introduced into the occult via the 13th-century Latin grimoire &quot;The Oathbound Book of Honorius&quot;. The wand idea from the &quot;Book of Honorius&quot;, along with various other ideas from that grimoire, were later incorporated into the 16th-century grimoire &quot;The Key of Solomon&quot;. &quot;The Key of Solomon&quot; became popular among occultists for hundreds of years. In 1888, there was the publication of an English translation of the &quot;Key of Solomon&quot; by Samuel Mathers (one of the co-founders of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn), which made the text of the &quot;Key of Solomon&quot; available to the anglophone world. That 1888 English version inspired Gerald Gardner, the creator of Wicca, to incorporate the wand and various other ritual objects into Wicca.

The creators of the Golden Dawn got their idea to use a wand, as well as their other main ritual objects (dagger, sword, hexagrammic pentacle, and cup), from the writings of the mid-19th-century occult writer Eliphas Levi. Levi himself mentioned most of those objects (all except for the cup) in his writings because they are in the &quot;Key of Solomon&quot;, whereas he got the cup from the tarot suit of cups. In Levi&#x27;s 1862 book &quot;Philosophie Occulte&quot;, he wrote a fake excerpt of a Hebrew version of the &quot;Key of Solomon&quot;, and that fake excerpt was part of the inspiration for the Golden Dawn&#x27;s ritual objects, and especially their lotus wand.

The ceremonial magic of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn uses several different types of wands for different purposes, the most prominent of which are the fire wand and the lotus wand. In Wicca, wands are traditionally used to summon and control angels and genies, but have later come to also be used for general spell-casting. Wands serve a similar purpose to athames (ritual daggers), though the two objects have their distinct uses: an athame is used to command, whereas a wand is seen as more gentle, and is used to invite or encourage.

Wands are traditionally made of wood—practitioners usually prune a branch from an oak, hazel, or other tree, or may even buy wood from a hardware store, and then carve it and add decorations to personalize it, though one can also purchase ready-made wands. In Wicca, the wand can represent the element air, or fire (following the wiccan author Raymond Buckland, who got his element associations from the Golden Dawn), although contemporary wand-makers also create wands for the elements of earth and water.

===Tarot cards===
The suit of wands is one of the four suits in the 1909 Rider–Waite–Smith occult tarot deck, and other, later tarot decks that are based upon that deck. The suit of wands replaced the suit of batons from earlier, non-occult tarot decks. The Rider–Waite–Smith tarot deck also replaced the suit of coins from earlier, non-occult decks, with the suit of pentacles. The Rider–Waite–Smith tarot deck was designed by two members of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, Arthur Edward Waite and Pamela Colman Smith. Waite provided the general guidelines for the deck (including the names of the four suits, and thus the suit of wands), and detailed guidelines for the designs of the Major Arcana, and he hired Smith to do the painting, and to make original artwork for the Minor Arcana. Waite instructed Smith to not paint actual &quot;wands&quot; in the wand cards, but rather to paint large tree trunk staffs with some foliage growing on them, so as to make an association between wands and Eliphas Levi&#x27;s phrase &quot;the flowering rod of Aaron&quot; from Levi&#x27;s fake fragment of &quot;The Key of Solomon&quot;.

==Status symbolism==
In British formal government ceremony, special officials may carry a wand of office that represents their power. Compare in this context the function of the ceremonial mace, the scepter, and the staff of office. Its age may be even greater, as Stone Age cave paintings show figures holding sticks, which may be symbolic representations of their power. The association with power may be its use for corporal punishment.

==Fiction==
In the 18th-century ballads &quot;Allison Gross&quot; and &quot;The Laily Worm and the Machrel of the Sea&quot;, the villainesses use silver wands to transform their victims into animals, in emulation of the Odyssey that preceded them. In C. S. Lewis&#x27;s 1950 novel &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;, the White Witch&#x27;s most feared weapon is her wand, whose magic is capable of turning people into stone. This, again, employs the Odysseyan motif of an evil female witch who uses a magic wand to maliciously transform her victims.

In the mid-20th century, the MGM and Disney media companies popularized magic wands via four films in which wands were wielded by benevolent female fairy characters. Those films were &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939; MGM; a wand-staff was wielded by Glinda the Good Witch of the North), &quot;Pinocchio&quot; (1940; Disney; a wand was wielded by the Blue Fairy), &quot;Cinderella&quot; (1950; Disney; a wand was wielded by a fairy godmother), and &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; (1959; Disney; a wand was wielded by each of three fairies). In &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; and &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, the fairies&#x27; wands are embellished with a star-shaped ornament on the end, whereas in &quot;Cinderella&quot; and &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;, the fairies have wands with traditional plain tips.

Magic wands commonly feature in works of fantasy fiction as spell-casting tools. Few other common denominators exist, so the capabilities of wands vary wildly. In J. K. Rowling&#x27;s &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series, the first book of which was published in 1997, personal wands are common as necessary tools to channel and project each character&#x27;s magic, they are used as weapons in magical duels, and it is the wand that chooses its owner. A wand is also present in the &quot;Children of the Red King&quot; series in the possession of Charlie Bone as well as the popular MMORPG &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; where caster classes such as the mage and warlock use wands offensively.

Magic wands and staves are often used in the magical girl genre of anime and manga (or other media) as well.

==Other usage==
Based on their magical symbolism, stage magicians often use &quot;magic wands&quot; as part of their misdirection. These wands are traditionally short and black, with white tips. A magic wand may be transformed into other items, grow, vanish, move, display a will of its own, or behave magically in its own right. A classic magic trick makes a bouquet of flowers shoot out of the wand&#x27;s tip.

<doc id="349579" wikidata="Q1215835" url="?curid=349579" title="River Medina">
<text>The River Medina is the main river of the Isle of Wight, England, rising at St Catherine&#x27;s Down near Chale, and flowing northwards through the county town Newport, towards the Solent at Cowes. The river is a navigable tidal estuary from Newport northwards, where it takes the form of a ria (a drowned valley). This occurred because the Medina used to be a tributary of what was once the &quot;River Solent&quot;, with a larger catchment area. As the Solent valley flooded, the river received less water and more sediment, causing it to become more tidal.

The river is bridged at Newport. Cowes is connected to East Cowes by a chain ferry known as the Cowes Floating Bridge. The river also has several small ferries which cater mainly for sailors.

The name &quot;Medina&quot; comes from the Old English &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;the middle one&quot;, and the current pronunciation was first recorded as &#x27;Medine&#x27; in 1196. The river&#x27;s only named tributary is Lukely Brook. The navigation of the river was improved in the nineteenth century by Henry Daniel Martin, a civil engineer who lived in Newport.

The river is used by yachtsmen as a safe harbour. Along its banks there are old warehouses and wharves, where in the past flying boats, hovercraft and steam ships were developed and built. The Classic Boat Museum displays much of the river&#x27;s history, as well as the history of yachting. The Island Harbour Marina, at the site of an old tidal mill, is on the river about two miles from Newport.

<doc id="349587" wikidata="Q82556" url="?curid=349587" title="Jakob Nielsen (usability consultant)">
<text>Jakob Nielsen (born 5 October 1957) is a Danish web usability consultant, human–computer interaction researcher, and co-founder of Nielsen Norman Group. He was named the &quot;“guru of Web page usability”&quot; in 1998 by The New York Times and the &quot;“king of usability”&quot; by Internet Magazine.

==Background==
Jakob Nielsen was born 5 October 1957 in Copenhagen, Denmark. He holds a Ph.D. in 1988 in human–computer interaction from the Technical University of Denmark.

Nielsen&#x27;s earlier affiliations include Bellcore (now known as Telcordia Technologies, formally Bell Communications Research), teaching at the Technical University of Denmark, and the IBM User Interface Institute at the Thomas J. Watson Research Center.

==Career==

===Sun Microsystems===
From 1994 to 1998, he was a Sun Microsystems Distinguished Engineer.

=== Nielsen Norman Group ===

After his regular articles on his website about usability research attracted media attention, he co-founded usability consulting company Nielsen Norman Group (NN/g) of Fremont, California in 1998 with fellow usability expert Donald Norman. The company&#x27;s vision is to help designers and other companies move toward more human-centered products and internet interactions, as experts and pioneers in the field of usability.

===Other activities===
Nielsen is on the editorial board of Morgan Kaufmann Publishers&#x27; book series in Interactive Technologies.

Nielsen writes a fortnightly newsletter, &quot;Alertbox&quot;, on web design matters and has published several books on the subject of web design.

==Contributions==
Nielsen founded the usability engineering movement for efficient and affordable improvements of user interfaces and he has invented several usability methods, including heuristic evaluation. He holds more than a thousand United States patents, mainly on ways of improving usability for technology.

In the early 1990s, Nielsen popularized the principle that five test users per usability test session is enough, allowing numerous tests at various stages of the development process. His argument is that &quot;elaborate usability tests are a waste of resources.&quot; Once it is found that a few people are totally confused by a home page, little is gained by watching more people suffer through the same flawed design.

=== Jakob&#x27;s law ===
 Users will anticipate what an experience will be like, based on their mental models of prior experiences on websites. When making changes to a design of a website, try to minimize changes in order to maintain an ease of use.

=== Nielsen&#x27;s usability heuristics ===

 Nielsen&#x27;s list of ten heuristics is probably the most-used usability framework for user interface design. An early version of the heuristics appeared in two papers by Nielsen and Rolf Molich published in 1989-1990. Nielsen published an updated set in 1994, and the final set still in use today was published in 2005: 

# Visibility of system status
# Match between system and the real world
# User control and freedom
# Consistency and standards
# Error prevention
# Recognition rather than recall
# Flexibility and efficiency of use
# Aesthetic and minimalist design
# Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
# Help and documentation

In his book &quot;Usability Engineering&quot; (1993), Nielsen also defined the five quality components of his &quot;Usability Goals&quot;:

# Learnability
# Efficiency
# Memorability
# Errors (as in low error rate)
# Satisfaction

=== Windows 8 usability ===
Nielsen has been quoted in the computing and the mainstream press for his criticism of Microsoft&#x27;s Windows 8 (2012) user interface. Tom Hobbs, creative director of the design firm Teague, criticized what he perceived to be some of Nielsen&#x27;s points on the matter, and Nielsen responded with some clarifications. The subsequent short and troubled history of Windows 8, released on 26 October 2012, seems to have confirmed Nielsen&#x27;s criticism: the sales of Windows-based systems plummeted after the introduction of Windows 8; Microsoft released a new version, Windows 8.1, on 18 October 2013, to fix the numerous problems identified in Windows 8, and later released Windows 10, a complete overhaul, in July 2015.

== Recognition and awards ==
In 2010, Nielsen was listed by Bloomberg Businessweek among 28 &quot;World&#x27;s Most Influential Designers&quot;.

In recognition of Nielsen&#x27;s contributions to usability studies, in 2013 SIGCHI awarded him the Lifetime Practice Award.

== Criticisms ==
As Nielsen&#x27;s newsletter and website grew, and with his use of &quot;acronomic platitudes&quot; to describe his concepts, it has been thought by some that much of Nielsen&#x27;s work was more about marketing himself than rooted in research.

=== Nielsen&#x27;s usability heuristics ===
In 1990, when the Nielsen heuristic evaluation guidelines were created (Nielsen and Molich, 1990), user interface was less complicated than it is in present-day. There has never been any research-based validation of Nielsen&#x27;s heuristics. The University of Calgary published an article in 2008, questioning if the Nielsen heuristics were an oversimplification.

Nielsen has been criticized by some visual designers and graphic designers for failing to balance the importance of other user experience considerations such as typography, readability, visual cues for hierarchy and importance, and eye appeal.

=== Responsive design ===
Nielsen&#x27;s 2012 guidelines, &quot;Repurposing vs Optimized Design&quot; that web sites made for mobile devices be designed separately from their desktop-oriented counterparts has come under fire from Webmonkey&#x27;s Scott Gilbertson, as well as Josh Clark writing in .net magazine, and Opera&#x27;s Bruce Lawson, writing in Smashing Magazine, and other technologists and web designers who advocate responsive web design. In an interview with &quot;.net&quot; magazine, Nielsen explained that he wrote his guidelines from a usability perspective, not from the viewpoint of implementation.

Nielsen has been accused of taking a &quot;puritanical&quot; approach to usability, and not being able to keep up his usability evaluations in step of technological changes.

<text>Louis-Joseph Chevrolet (December 25, 1878 – June 6, 1941) was a Swiss-born American racing driver, mechanic and entrepreneur who co-founded the Chevrolet Motor Car Company in 1911.

== Early life ==

Louis-Joseph Chevrolet was born on December 25, 1878, in La Chaux-de-Fonds, a center of watchmaking in northwestern Switzerland. He was the second child of Joseph-Félicien Chevrolet, a watchmaker, and Marie-Anne Angéline Mahon. His family was originally from Bonfol, now in the canton of Jura.

In 1887, Chevrolet left Switzerland along with his father to settle in Beaune, France. There, as a young man, he developed his mechanical skills and interest in bicycle racing. During this period, Chevrolet invented a wine pump, which he built from a defective one-cylinder motor mounted on a three-wheeled bicycle.

== Career ==

=== Early career ===

Chevrolet worked at the Roblin mechanics shop in Beaune from around 1889 to 1899. He then moved to Paris, where he worked at various mechanics shops, between 1899 and 1900, before emigrating to Montreal, Quebec, Canada in 1900 to work as a mechanic. The following year, he moved to New York City, where he worked briefly for a fellow Swiss immigrant&#x27;s engineering company, then moved to the Brooklyn operations of the French car manufacturer de Dion-Bouton.

In 1905, Chevrolet won his first race, racing a Fiat at Morris Park, the first-ever national championship race sanctioned by the American Automobile Association (AAA) Contest Board, then known as the Racing Board. In 1907 he was hired by the Autocar Company in Philadelphia, probably for a secret project to develop a revolutionary front-wheel-drive racing car.

His racing career continued as he drove for Buick, becoming a friend and associate of Buick owner William C. Durant, founder of General Motors. He raced at the Giants Despair Hillclimb in 1909. With little in the way of formal education, Chevrolet learned car design while working for Buick and started designing his own engine for a new car in 1909. He built an overhead valve six-cylinder engine in his own machine shop on Grand River Boulevard in Detroit. He is credited as one of three co-designers of the 1910 Buick 60 Special, also known as the &quot;Buick Bug&quot;.

=== Chevrolet car company ===

On November 3, 1911, Chevrolet co-founded the Chevrolet Motor Car Company with his brother Arthur Chevrolet, William C. Durant, and investment partners William Little (maker of the Little automobile) and Dr. Edwin R. Campbell, son-in-law of Durant and friend of Samuel McLaughlin of the McLaughlin Car Company of Canada Ltd. The company was established in Detroit. One story tells the choosing of the company&#x27;s logo as a modified Swiss cross, to honor Chevrolet&#x27;s homeland. 
Another story tells of the Chevrolet logo as a design taken from the wallpaper of a Paris hotel room where Louis once stayed.

Chevrolet had differences with Durant over the car&#x27;s design, and in 1915 sold Durant his share in the company and started McLaughlin&#x27;s Company in Canada building Chevrolets. By 1916 the trading of Chevrolet stock for GM Holding stock enabled Durant to repurchase a controlling stake in General Motors, and by 1917 the Chevrolet company that Louis had co-founded was merged as a company into General Motors after the outstanding Chevrolet stocks were purchased from McLaughlin in 1918. The McLaughlin Car Company then merged with his Chevrolet Motor Company of Canada Ltd. to become General Motors of Canada Ltd. in 1918, prior to the incorporation of the General Motors Corporation in the United States when General Motors Company of New Jersey dissolved.

=== Frontenac and American car companies ===

In 1916, Louis Chevrolet and his brothers founded the Frontenac Motor Corporation to make racing parts for Ford Model Ts.

Also in 1916, American Motors Corporation (unrelated to the later American Motors created by the 1954 merger of Nash-Kelvinator Corporation and Hudson Motor Car Company) was formed in Newark, New Jersey, with Louis Chevrolet as vice president and chief engineer. By 1918 it was producing cars in a plant at Plainfield, New Jersey. In 1923 it merged with the Bessemer Motor Truck Company of Pennsylvania into Bessemer-American Motors Corporation, which lasted less than a year before merging with the Winther and Northway companies into Amalgamated Motors. The latter company apparently ceased soon after.

=== Auto racing ===

By the mid-1910s, Chevrolet had shifted into the car racing industry, partnering with Howard E. Blood of Allegan, Michigan, to create the Cornelian racing car, which he used to place 20th in the 1915 Indianapolis 500 automobile race. In 1916, he and his younger brothers Gaston and Arthur Chevrolet started Frontenac Motor Corporation, designing and producing a line of racing cars. They became well known for, among other things, their Fronty-Ford racers.

Chevrolet drove in the Indianapolis 500 four times, with a best finish of 7th in 1919. Both Louis and Gaston competed successfully with racing Sunbeams, achieving a number of third places in 1916. Arthur competed twice, and Gaston won the Indianapolis 500 in 1920 in one of their Frontenacs, going on to win the 1920 AAA National Championship. He also raced for the Buick racing team.

=== Later life ===

In 1927, Chevrolet launched the aircraft engine construction company Chevrolair, which failed three years later as a result of the Great Depression. He returned to Chevrolet to work as mechanic in the Detroit factories.

Chevrolet died on June 6, 1941, in Detroit due to a heart attack. His atherosclerosis had previously led to a leg amputation. He is buried in the Holy Cross and Saint Joseph Cemetery in Indianapolis, Indiana.

== Personal life ==

In 1905, Chevrolet married Suzanne Treyvoux (1888-1966), daughter of Louis Treyvoux and Marie Burlat. The couple had two sons and a daughter, Clara.

He became a naturalized American citizen in 1915.

== Awards and honors ==

Chevrolet has been inducted into the following halls of fame:

*Automotive Hall of Fame (1969)
*National Sprint Car Hall of Fame (1990)
*International Motorsports Hall of Fame (1992)
*Motorsports Hall of Fame of America (1995)

In addition, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Museum in Speedway, Indiana, features a memorial at the entrance to the building dedicated to the accomplishments of Chevrolet. The memorial, designed by Fred Wellman and sculpted by Adolph Wolter, was created during 1968–1970 and installed in the spring of 1975. The centerpiece of the memorial is a bronze bust of Chevrolet wearing a racing cap and goggles; it rests on a marble and granite square base.
The Swiss national train company, SBB, has named one of its long distance ICN-Trains after Louis Chevrolet. The train family operates primarily on the East-West axis, also serving Chevrolet&#x27;s home town, La Chaux-de-Fonds.

<doc id="349616" wikidata="Q1067639" url="?curid=349616" title="Borough of Charnwood">
<text>Charnwood is a local government district with borough status in the north of Leicestershire, England. It is named after Charnwood Forest, much of which lies within the borough. Towns in the borough include Loughborough (where the council is based), Shepshed and Syston. Villages in the borough include Barrow upon Soar, Birstall, Hathern, Mountsorrel, Quorn, Rothley, Sileby and Woodhouse Eaves.

The neighbouring districts are Melton, Harborough, Leicester, Blaby, Hinckley and Bosworth, North West Leicestershire and Rushcliffe.

==History==
The district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the area of three former districts, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Barrow upon Soar Rural District
*Loughborough Municipal Borough
*Shepshed Urban District

Prior to the new district coming into being there was some debate as to what name it should take, with alternatives considered including &quot;Loughborough and Soar Valley&quot;, &quot;Greater Loughborough&quot; and &quot;Soar Valley&quot;. A committee of the three outgoing councils chose Soar Valley as its preferred option but was overruled by the government, which went instead for the committee&#x27;s second choice of Charnwood, after the Charnwood Forest which covers the western part of the district. The new district was awarded borough status from its creation, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor.

The symbol of Charnwood Borough Council is the fox, which is also the symbol used by Leicestershire County Council. Charnwood contains the village of Quorn, which gives its name to one of the country&#x27;s oldest fox hunting packs, the Quorn Hunt, which was established in 1696 and moved to Quorn in 1753.

==Governance==
Charnwood Borough Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Leicestershire County Council. Much of the borough is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since the 2023 election, being run by a Labour minority administration with support from the Greens. The Leader of the Council is Jewel Miah. 

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities before coming into its powers on 1 April 1974. Since 1974 political control of the council has been as follows:

===Leadership===
The role of mayor is ceremonial in Charnwood. Political leadership is instead provided by the Leader of the council. The Leaders since 2010 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election the composition of the council was:

The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2023 the council has comprised 52 councillors, representing 24 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

There are three Parliamentary constituencies covering the district. Mid Leicestershire is represented by the Conservative Peter Bedford MP. Loughborough is represented by the Labour&#x27;s Jeevun Sandher. Melton and Syston is represented by the Conservative Edward Argar MP.

===Premises===

The council is based at the Council Offices on Southfield Road in Loughborough. The older part of the building was an early 19th century house called Southfields. The house was acquired by the old Loughborough Town Council during the Second World War and after the war was converted to be additional offices supplementing those at Loughborough Town Hall. A large extension was added to Southfields in 1990 allowing it to become Charnwood&#x27;s main offices. Loughborough Town Hall is still used for full council meetings of Charnwood Borough Council.

==Geography==
To the south it borders the City of Leicester, about 20 km away from Loughborough. There is a moderately urbanised A6 corridor between the two population centres and close to the River Soar, including Quorn, Barrow-on-Soar, Mountsorrel, Birstall, Sileby, Thurmaston, Syston, Queniborough and East Goscote.

To the south of the borough, Birstall, Queniborough, Thurmaston and Syston form part of the Leicester Urban Area, while Quorn and Shepshed (the second-largest town in the district), amongst others, might be considered to be part of a Loughborough urban agglomeration.

The highest point is Beacon Hill (248m/814 ft) to the north of the Charnwood Forest &#x27;area of natural beauty&#x27; extending WN-west into the National Forest.

==Demography==
Charnwood is the largest borough by population in Leicestershire, and has the largest school population as well.

==Media==
The area is served by BBC East Midlands and ITV Central with television signals received from the Waltham transmitter. 

Radio stations for the area are:
*BBC Radio Leicester 
*Smooth East Midlands 
*Capital Midlands
*Community based stations: Fosse FM and Carillon Radio, 

==Parishes==
Most of the borough is covered by civil parishes. Most of the pre-1974 borough of Loughborough is an unparished area. The parish councils for Shepshed and Syston have declared their parishes to be towns, allowing them to take the style &quot;town council&quot;. The parishes of Barkby and Barkby Thorpe share a grouped parish council, as do Burton on the Wolds, Cotes and Prestwold. The small parishes of Beeby, Hamilton Lea, Stonebow Village, Swithland, Ulverscroft and Wanlip have a parish meeting rather than a parish council.

<doc id="349624" wikidata="Q1771524" url="?curid=349624" title="Stanley Forman Reed">
<text>Stanley Forman Reed (December 31, 1884 – April 2, 1980) was an American lawyer and jurist who served as an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1938 to 1957. He also served as U.S. Solicitor General from 1935 to 1938.

Born in Mason County, Kentucky, Reed established a legal practice in Maysville, Kentucky, and won election to the Kentucky House of Representatives. He attended law school but did not graduate, making him the latest-serving Supreme Court Justice who did not graduate from law school. After serving in the United States Army during World War I, Reed emerged as a prominent corporate attorney and took positions with the Federal Farm Board and the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. He took office as Solicitor General in 1935, and defended the constitutionality of several New Deal policies.

After the retirement of Associate Justice George Sutherland, President Franklin D. Roosevelt successfully nominated Reed to the Supreme Court. Reed served until his retirement in 1957, and was succeeded by Charles Evans Whittaker. Reed wrote the majority opinion in cases such as &quot;Smith v. Allwright,&quot; &quot;Gorin v. United States,&quot; and &quot;Adamson v. California&quot;. He authored dissenting opinions in cases such as &quot;Illinois ex rel. McCollum v. Board of Education.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Reed was born in the small town of Minerva in Mason County, Kentucky on December 31, 1884, the son of wealthy physician John Reed and Frances (Forman) Reed. The Reeds and Formans traced their history to the earliest colonial period in America, and these family heritages were impressed upon young Stanley at an early age. At the age of 10, Reed moved with his family to Maysville, Kentucky where his father practiced medicine. The family resided downtown in a prominent home known as Phillips&#x27; Folly.

Reed attended Kentucky Wesleyan College and received a B.A. degree in 1902. He then attended Yale College as an undergraduate, and obtained a second B.A. in 1906. He studied law at the University of Virginia (where he was a member of St. Elmo Hall) and Columbia University, but did not obtain a law degree. Reed married the former Winifred Elgin in May 1908. The couple had two sons, John A. and Stanley Jr., who both became attorneys. In 1909 he traveled to France and studied at the Sorbonne as an auditeur bénévole.

==Career==

After his studies in France, Reed returned to Kentucky. He was admitted to the bar in 1910 and practiced in Maysville for nine years. He was elected as a Democratic member of the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1911 and reelected in 1913. He was defeated for a third term in 1915 by Republican candidate Harry P. Purnell. After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, Reed joined the United States Army and was commissioned a lieutenant in the intelligence division. When the war ended in 1918, Reed returned to his private law practice and became a well-known corporate attorney. He represented the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway and the Kentucky Burley Tobacco Growers Association, among other large corporations. Stanley Reed was very active in the Sons of the American Revolution and Society of Colonial Wars, while his wife was a national officer in the Daughters of the American Revolution. The Reeds settled on a farm near Maysville, where Stanley Reed raised prize-winning Holstein cattle in his spare time. After the war, Reed practiced as a partner in the Maysville firm of Worthington, Browning and Reed.

===Federal Farm Bureau===

Reed&#x27;s work for a number of large agricultural interests in Kentucky made him a nationally known authority on the law of agricultural cooperatives. It was this reputation which brought him to the attention of federal officials.

Herbert Hoover had been elected President of the United States in November 1928, and took office in March 1929. The agricultural industry in the United States was heading for a depression. Unlike his predecessor, Hoover agreed to provide some federal support for agriculture, and in June 1929 Congress passed the Agriculture Marketing Act. The act established and was administered by the Federal Farm Board. The crash of the stock market in late October 1929 led the Federal Farm Board&#x27;s general counsel to resign. Although Reed was a Democrat, his reputation as a corporate agricultural lawyer led President Hoover to appoint him the new general counsel of the Federal Farm Board on November 7, 1929. Reed served as general counsel until December 1932.

===Reconstruction Finance Corporation===
In December 1932, the general counsel of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) resigned, and Reed was appointed the agency&#x27;s new general counsel. Since 1930, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Eugene Meyer, had pressed Hoover to take a more active approach to ameliorating the Great Depression. Hoover finally relented and submitted legislation. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation Act was signed into law on January 22, 1932, but its operations were kept secret for five months. Hoover feared both political attacks from Republicans and that publicity about which corporations were receiving RFC assistance might disrupt the agency&#x27;s attempts to keep companies financially viable. When Congress passed legislation in July 1932 forcing the RFC to make public the companies that received loans, the resulting political embarrassment led to the resignation of the RFC&#x27;s president and his successor as well as other staff turnover at the agency. Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s election as president in November 1932 led to further staff changes. On December 1, 1932, the RFC&#x27;s general counsel resigned, and Hoover appointed Reed to the position. Roosevelt, impressed with Reed&#x27;s work and needing someone who knew the agency, its staff and its operations, kept Reed on. Reed mentored and protected the careers of a number of young lawyers at RFC, many of whom became highly influential in the Roosevelt administration: Alger Hiss, Robert H. Jackson, Thomas Gardiner Corcoran, Charles Edward Wyzanski Jr. (later an important federal district court judge), and David Cushman Coyle.

During his tenure at the RFC, Reed influenced two major national policies. First, Reed was instrumental in setting up the Commodity Credit Corporation. In early October 1933, President Roosevelt ordered RFC president Jesse Jones to establish a program to strengthen cotton prices. On October 16, 1933, Jones met with Reed and together they created the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC). President Roosevelt issued Executive Order 6340 the next day, which legally established the CCC. The brilliance of the CCC was that the government would hold surplus cotton as security for the loan. If cotton prices rose above the value of the loan, farmers could redeem their cotton, pay off the loan and make a profit. If prices stayed low, the farmer still had enough money to live as well as plant next year. The plan worked so well that it became the basis for the New Deal&#x27;s entire agricultural program.

Second, Reed helped to successfully defend the administration&#x27;s gold policy, saving the nation&#x27;s monetary policy as well. Deflation had caused the value of the United States dollar to fall nearly 60 percent. But federal law still permitted Americans and foreign citizens to redeem paper money and coins in gold at its pre-Depression value, causing a run on the gold reserves of the United States. Taking the United States off the gold standard would stop the run. It would also further devalue the dollar, making American goods less expensive and more attractive to foreign buyers. In a series of moves, Roosevelt took the nation off the gold standard in March and April 1933, causing the dollar&#x27;s value to sink. But additional deflation was needed. One way to do this was to raise the price of gold, but federal law required the Treasury to buy gold at its high, pre-Depression price. President Roosevelt asked the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to buy gold above the market price to further devalue the dollar. Although Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr. believed the government lacked the authority to buy gold, Reed joined with Treasury general counsel Herman Oliphant to provide critical legal support for the plan.

The additional deflation helped stabilize the economy during a critical period where bank runs were common.

Reed&#x27;s help with Roosevelt&#x27;s gold policies was not yet finished. On June 5, 1933, Congress passed a joint resolution (48 Stat. 112) voiding clauses in all public and private contracts permitting redemption in gold. Hundreds of angry creditors sued to overturn the law. The case finally reached the U.S. Supreme Court. United States Attorney General Homer Stille Cummings asked Reed to join him in writing the government&#x27;s brief for the Court and assisting him during oral argument. Reed&#x27;s help was critical, for the high court was resolutely conservative when it came to the sanctity of contracts.

On February 2, 1935, the Supreme Court made the unprecedented announcement that it was delaying its ruling by a week. The court shocked the nation again by announcing a second delay on February 9. Finally, on February 18, 1935, the Supreme Court held in &quot;Norman v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. Co.&quot;, , that the government had the power to abrogate private contracts but not public ones. However, the majority said that since there had been no showing that contractors with the federal government had been harmed, no payments would be made.

===Solicitor General===

Reed&#x27;s invaluable assistance in defending the federal government&#x27;s interests in &quot;the Gold Clause Cases&quot; led Roosevelt to appoint him Solicitor General. J. Crawford Biggs, the incumbent Solicitor General, was generally considered ineffective if not incompetent (he had lost 10 of the 17 cases he argued in his first five months in office). Biggs resigned on March 14, 1935. Reed was named his replacement on March 18 and confirmed by the Senate on March 25. He was confronted by an office in chaos. Several major challenges to the National Industrial Recovery Act—considered the cornerstone of the New Deal—were reaching the Supreme Court, and Reed was forced to drop the appeals because the Office of the Solicitor General was unprepared to argue them. Reed worked quickly to restore order, and subsequent briefs were noted for their strong legal argument and extensive research. Reed soon brought before the high court appeals of the constitutionality of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, Securities Act of 1933, Social Security Act, National Labor Relations Act, Bankhead Cotton Control Act, Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, Guffey Coal Control Act, Bituminous Coal Conservation Act of 1935 and the enabling act for the Tennessee Valley Authority, and revived the battle over the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA). The press of appeals was so great that Reed argued six major cases before the Supreme Court in two weeks. On December 10, 1935, he collapsed from exhaustion during oral argument before the Court. Reed lost a number of these cases, including &quot;Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States&quot;, (invalidating the National Industrial Recovery Act) and &quot;United States v. Butler&quot;, (invalidating the Agricultural Adjustment Act).

1937 proved to be a banner year for the Solicitor General. Reed argued and won such major cases as &quot;West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish&quot;, (upholding minimum wage laws), &quot;National Labor Relations Board v. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corporation&quot;, (upholding the National Labor Relations Act), and &quot;Steward Machine Company v. Davis&quot;, (upholding the taxing power of the Social Security Act). By the end of 1937, Reed was winning most of his economic cases and had a reputation as being one of the strongest Solicitors General since the creation of the office in 1870.

===Supreme Court===
====Nomination and confirmation====
On January 15, 1938, President Roosevelt nominated Reed as an associate justice on the Supreme Court of the United States to succeed retiring justice George Sutherland. Many in the nation&#x27;s capital worried about the nomination fight. Willis Van Devanter, one of the Court&#x27;s conservative &quot;Four Horsemen,&quot; had retired the previous summer. Roosevelt had nominated Senator Hugo Black as his replacement, and Black&#x27;s nomination battle proved to be a long (seven days) and bitter one. To the relief of many, Reed&#x27;s nomination was swift and generated little debate in the Senate. He was confirmed on January 25, 1938, and sworn into office on January 31. His successor as Solicitor General was Robert H. Jackson. Reed is the last person to serve as a Supreme Court Justice without possessing a law degree.

Stanley Reed spent 19 years on the Supreme Court. Within two years, he was joined on the bench by his mentor, Felix Frankfurter, and his protégé, Robert H. Jackson. Reed and Jackson held very similar views on national security issues and often voted together. Reed and Frankfurter also held similar views, and Frankfurter usually concurred with Reed. However, the two had significantly different writing styles, as Frankfurter offered lengthy, professorial discussions of the law, whereas Reed wrote terse opinions keeping to the facts of the case.

Reed was considered a moderate and often provided the critical fifth vote in split rulings. He authored more than 300 opinions, and Chief Justice Warren Burger said &quot;he wrote with clarity and firmness...&quot; Reed was an economic progressive, and generally supported racial desegregation, civil liberties, trade union rights and economic regulation. On free speech, national security and certain social issues, however, Reed was generally a conservative. He often approved of federal (but not state or local) restrictions on civil liberties. Reed also opposed applying the Bill of Rights to the states via the 14th Amendment.

====Opinions====

Among Reed&#x27;s more notable decisions are:
*United States v. Rock Royal Co-Op,  – This was one of the first cases in which Reed wrote the majority opinion. The case was especially important to Reed because of his prior career as an attorney for agricultural cooperatives (Rock Royal was a milk producers co-op). Reed stuck closely to the facts in the case, quoting at length from the statute, regulations and agency order.
*Gorin v. United States,  – Upheld several aspects of the Espionage Act of 1917
*Smith v. Allwright,  – In 1935, a unanimous Supreme Court in &quot;Grovey v. Townsend&quot;, , had held that political parties in Texas did not violate the constitutional rights of African American citizens by denying them the right to vote in a primary election. But in &quot;Smith v. Allwright&quot;, the issue came before the Court again. This time, the plaintiff alleged that the state, not the political party, had denied black citizens the right to vote. In an 8-to-1 decision authored by Reed, the Supreme Court overruled &quot;Grovey&quot; as wrongly decided. In ringing terms, Reed dismissed the state action question and declared that &quot;the Court throughout its history has freely exercised its power to reexamine the basis of its constitutional decisions.&quot; The lone dissenter was Justice Roberts, who had written the majority opinion nine years earlier in &quot;Grovey.&quot;
*Morgan v. Commonwealth of Virginia,  – In a 7-to-1 ruling, Reed applied the undue burden standard to a Virginia law which required separate but equal racial segregation in public transportation. Reed found that the law created an undue burden because uniformity of law was essential in certain interstate activities, such as transportation.
*Adamson v. California,  – Adamson was charged with murder but chose not to testify because he knew the prosecutor would ask him about his prior criminal record. Adamson argued that, because the prosecutor had drawn attention to his refusal to testify, Adamson&#x27;s freedom against self-incrimination had been violated. Reed wrote that the rights guaranteed under the Fourteenth Amendment did not extend the protections of the Fifth Amendment to state courts. Reed felt that the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment did not intend to apply the Bill of Rights to states without limitation.
*Illinois ex rel. McCollum v. Board of Education,  – Reed said he was proudest of his dissent in &quot;Illinois ex rel. McCollum v. Board of Education.&quot; The ruling was the first to declare that a state had violated the Establishment Clause. Reed disliked the phrase &quot;wall of separation between church and state,&quot; and his dissent contains his famous dictum about the phrase: &quot;A rule of law should not be drawn from a figure of speech.&quot;
*Pennekamp v. Florida,  – Reed authored this majority opinion for a court which confronted the issue of whether judges could censor newspapers for impugning the reputation of the courts. The &quot;Miami Herald&quot; newspaper had published two editorials and a cartoon criticizing a Florida court&#x27;s actions in a pending trial. The judge cited the publisher and editors for contempt, claiming that the published material maligned the integrity of the court and thereby interfered with the fair administration of justice. Hewing closely to the facts in the case, Reed used the clear and present danger test to come down firmly on the side of freedom of expression.
*Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka,  – This was recognized as a critical case even before it reached the Supreme Court. Chief Justice Earl Warren, realizing how controversial the case would be for the public, very much wanted to avoid any dissents in the case, but Reed was the lone hold-out. Other members of the Supreme Court worried about Reed&#x27;s commitment to civil rights, as he was a member of the (then) all-white Burning Tree Club in Washington, D.C., and his Kentucky home had an all-white restrictive covenant (a covenant which had led Reed to recuse himself from a civil rights case in 1948). Nonetheless, Reed had written the majority decision in &quot;Smith v. Allwright&quot; and joined the majority in &quot;Sweatt v. Painter&quot;, , which barred separate but equal racial segregation in law schools. Reed originally planned to write a dissent in &quot;Brown&quot;, but joined the majority before a decision was issued. Many observers, including Chief Justice Warren, believed a unanimous decision in &quot;Brown&quot; was necessary to win public acceptance for the decision. Reed reportedly cried during the reading of the opinion.

====Hiss case====
Reed&#x27;s fame and notoriety did not stem solely from his judicial rulings, however. In 1949, Reed was caught up in the Alger Hiss case. Hiss, one of Reed and Frankfurter&#x27;s protégés, was accused of espionage in August 1948. Hiss was tried in June 1949. Hiss&#x27;s attorneys subpoenaed both Reed and Frankfurter. Although Reed ethically objected to having a sitting Associate Justice of the Supreme Court testify in a legal proceeding, he agreed to do so once he was subpoenaed. A number of observers strongly denounced Reed for refusing to disobey the subpoena.

====Dissents and retirement====
By the mid-1950s, Justice Reed was dissenting more and more frequently from court rulings. His first full dissent had come in 1939, nearly a year after his tenure on the court began. Initially, his dissents &quot;were only when, with Hughes, Brandeis, Stone or Roberts—like himself, lawyers of deep experience—he could not go along with what he considered the judge-made amendments of the Constitution implicit in the opinions of Hugo Black, Felix Frankfurter, William O. Douglas and Frank Murphy, whom Roosevelt had sent to follow Black and Reed on the court.&quot; But by 1955, Reed was dissenting much more frequently. Reed began to feel that the Court&#x27;s jurisprudential center had shifted too far away from him and that he was losing his effectiveness.

===Retirement===
Stanley Reed retired from the Supreme Court on February 25, 1957, citing old age. He was 73 years old. Charles Evans Whittaker was appointed his successor.

Reed led a fairly active retirement. In November 1957, President Dwight D. Eisenhower asked Reed to chair the newly formed United States Commission on Civil Rights. Eisenhower announced the nomination on November 7, but Reed turned down the nomination on December 3. Reed cited the impropriety of having a former Associate Justice sit on such a political body. But some media reports indicated that his appointment would have been opposed by civil rights activists, who felt Reed was not sufficiently progressive.

Reed did, however, continue to serve the federal judiciary in a number of ways. For several years, he served as a temporary judge on a number of lower federal courts, particularly in the District of Columbia. He also served in special capacities where judicial experience was needed, such as boundary disputes between states.

In 1958 he was elected as a hereditary member of the New Jersey Society of the Cincinnati by right of his descent from Colonel David Forman.

==Death==

Increasingly frail and often ill, Stanley Reed and his wife lived at the Hilaire Nursing Home in Huntington, New York for the last few years of their lives.

Reed died there on April 2, 1980. He was survived by his wife and sons. He was interred in Maysville, Kentucky.

Although he retired eighteen years before William O. Douglas, Reed outlived him by two months and was the last living Justice appointed by Franklin D. Roosevelt, and the last living justice to have served on the Hughes Court, Stone Court and Vinson Court.

==Legacy==
An extensive collection of Reed&#x27;s personal and official papers, including his Supreme Court files, is archived at the University of Kentucky in Lexington, where they are open for research.

==Quotations==
*&quot;The United States is a constitutional democracy. Its organic law grants to all citizens a right to participate in the choice of elected officials without restriction by any state because of race.&quot; – &quot;Smith v. Allwright&quot;, 321 U.S. 649 (1944)
*&quot;There is a recognized abstract principle, however, that may be taken as a postulate for testing whether particular state legislation in the absence of action by Congress is beyond state power. This is that the state legislation is invalid if it unduly burdens that commerce in matters where uniformity is necessary—necessary in the constitutional sense of useful in accomplishing a permitted purpose.&quot; – &quot;Morgan v. Commonwealth of Virginia&quot;, 328 U.S. 373 (1946)
*&quot;Freedom of discussion should be given the widest possible range compatible with the essential requirement of the fair and orderly administration of justice. ... That a judge might be influenced by a desire to placate the accusing newspaper to retain public esteem and secure reelection at the cost of unfair rulings against an accused is too remote a possibility to be considered a clear and present danger to justice.&quot; – &quot;Pennekamp v. Florida&quot;, 328 U.S. 331 (1946)
*&quot;A rule of law should not be drawn from a figure of speech.&quot; – &quot;Illinois ex rel. McCollum v. Board of Education&quot;, 333 U.S. 203 (1948) (commenting on the phrase &quot;wall of separation between church and state&quot;)
*&quot;Philosophers and poets, thinkers of high and low degree from every age and race have sought to expound the meaning of virtue, but each teaches his own conception of the moral excellence that satisfies standards of good conduct. Are the tests of the Puritan or the Cavalier to be applied, those of the city or the farm, the Christian or non-Christian, the old or the young? Does the Bill of Rights permit Illinois to forbid any reflection on the virtue of racial or religious classes which a jury or a judge may think exposes them to derision or obloquy, words themselves of quite uncertain meaning as used in the statute? I think not.&quot; – &quot;Beauharnais v. Illinois&quot;, 343 U.S. 250 (1952)

<text>Blaby is a local government district in Leicestershire, England. The district is named after the village of Blaby, although the council is based in Narborough. The district covers an area lying south-west of the city of Leicester. Several of the district&#x27;s settlements form part of the wider Leicester Urban Area, including Glenfield, where Leicestershire County Council has its headquarters at County Hall, and the town of Braunstone.

The neighbouring districts are Hinckley and Bosworth, Charnwood, Leicester, Oadby and Wigston, Harborough and Rugby.

==History==
The district traces its origins to the Blaby Poor Law Union, which had been created in 1836. Although named after Blaby, the union built its workhouse in Enderby. In 1872 sanitary districts were established, giving public health and local government responsibilities for rural areas to the existing boards of guardians of poor law unions. In 1894 rural sanitary districts were redesignated as rural districts with their own councils, and so the Blaby Rural District came into being. At the same time, Wigston was removed from the district to become its own urban district. Oadby was subsequently also removed from the district in 1913 to become an urban district. In 1935 the district ceded some territory to Leicester and gained six parishes from the abolished Hinckley Rural District.

In 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, the area was reconstituted as a non-metropolitan district called Blaby.

==Governance==
Blaby District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Leicestershire County Council. The whole district is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
The council has been under Conservative majority control since 1999.

Political control of the council since the 1974 reforms took effect has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 2004 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election the composition of the council was:

The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2023 the council has comprised 36 councillors representing 17 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

The district straddles the parliamentary constituencies of South Leicestershire and Chanrnwood. There was a Blaby constituency between 1974 and 2010, which was represented by Nigel Lawson between 1974 and 1992.

===Premises===
Blaby District Council&#x27;s main offices are on Desford Road in Narborough. The old part of the building was formerly a house called the Old Rectory, which had previously served as the rectory for the nearby All Saints Church. The house was bought in 1936 for £4,250 by Blaby Rural District Council to serve as its headquarters and has been significantly extended since then.

==Geography==
In 1994 a new development called Thorpe Astley in the parish of Braunstone was started, being built over the course of 15 years. This totalled over 2,000 homes during the phased construction. The development in Lubbesthorpe, approved in January 2014, is located to land west of Thorpe Astley, divided by the M1.

Blaby District contains several well-known developments in the county, centred around junction 21 of the M1. The most prominent is Fosse Shopping Park.

==Demography==

==Parishes==
The district contains 24 civil parishes. The parish council for Braunstone has declared its parish to be a town, allowing it to take the style &quot;town council&quot;; the area is often called &quot;Braunstone Town&quot; to distinguish it from the adjoining Braunstone estate which used to be in the parish but was transferred to Leicester in 1935. Some of the smaller parishes have a parish meeting rather than a parish council.

<text>The Battle of Lake Trasimene was fought when a Carthaginian force under Hannibal Barca ambushed a Roman army commanded by Gaius Flaminius on 21 June 217 BC, during the Second Punic War. The battle took place on the north shore of Lake Trasimene, to the south of Cortona, and resulted in a heavy defeat for the Romans.

War had broken out between Rome and Carthage early in 218 BC. Hannibal, ruler of the Carthaginian territories in south-east Iberia, marched an army through Gaul, crossed the Alps and arrived in Cisalpine Gaul (northern Italy) later that year. The Romans rushed reinforcements north from Sicily but were badly defeated at the Battle of the Trebia.

The following spring, the Romans positioned an army on each side of the Apennine Mountains, but were surprised when a Carthaginian army more than 50,000 strong crossed the range by a difficult but unguarded route. The Carthaginians moved south into Etruria, plundering, razing the villages and killing all men encountered. Flaminius, in charge of the nearest Roman army, set off in pursuit. Hannibal arranged an ambush on the north shore of Lake Trasimene and trapped the Romans. With the Carthaginians attacking unexpectedly from the flank and the rear, possibly in poor visibility, there was no chance for the Romans to form even a rudimentary fighting line and they were defeated after three hours of hard fighting. The trap failed to enclose the 6,000 Romans at the front of the column, who escaped; later in the day they were surrounded by pursuing Carthaginians and surrendered. Thus nearly all 25,000 Romans in Flaminius&#x27;s army were killed or captured. This destruction of an entire army as a result of an ambush by another army is widely considered a unique occurrence. Several days later the Carthaginians wiped out the entire cavalry force of the second Roman army, who were not yet aware of the earlier disaster.

The Carthaginians then marched towards southern Italy in the hope of winning over some of the ethnic Greek and Italic city-states there. News of the defeat caused a panic in Rome and led to the election of Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus as dictator. Impatient with his Fabian strategy of avoiding major battles, the next year the Romans elected Lucius Paullus and Gaius Varro as consuls. These more aggressive commanders engaged Hannibal at the Battle of Cannae in 216  BC, resulting in a third and even worse disaster for Rome; it was followed by thirteen more years of war.

== Background ==
===Pre-war===
The First Punic War was fought from 264 to 241 BC between Carthage and Rome: these two main powers of the western Mediterranean in the 3rd century BC struggled for supremacy primarily on the Mediterranean island of Sicily and its surrounding waters and in North Africa. The war lasted for 23 years until the Carthaginians were defeated. Five years later an army commanded by the leading Carthaginian general Hamilcar Barca landed in Carthaginian Iberia (modern south-east Spain) which he greatly expanded and turned into a quasi-monarchical, autonomous territory ruled by the Barcids. This expansion gained Carthage silver mines, agricultural wealth, manpower, military facilities such as shipyards and territorial depth, which encouraged it to resist future Roman demands.

Hamilcar ruled as viceroy until his death in 228 BC. He was succeeded by his son-in-law, Hasdrubal, then his son Hannibal in 221 BC. In 226 BC the Ebro Treaty established the Ebro River as the northern boundary of the Carthaginian sphere of influence in Iberia. A little later Rome made a separate treaty of association with the independent city of Saguntum, well south of the Ebro. In 219 BC a Carthaginian army under Hannibal besieged, captured and sacked Saguntum, which led Rome to declare war on Carthage.

Meanwhile, the major Gallic tribes in Cisalpine Gaul (modern northern Italy), antagonised by the founding of several Roman settlements on traditionally Gallic territory, attacked the Romans, capturing several towns and repeatedly ambushing a Roman relief force. The Roman Senate reinforced their army in Cisalpine Gaul while also preparing armies to invade Carthaginian territories.

===Carthage invades Italy===
Hannibal assembled a Carthaginian army in New Carthage (modern Cartagena) and marched north into Gaul in May 218 BC, leaving his brother, Hasdrubal Barca, in charge of Carthaginian interests in Iberia. The Carthaginian army crossed the Alps in October, surmounting the difficulties of climate, terrain and the guerrilla tactics of the native tribes. Hannibal arrived with 20,000 infantry, 6,000 cavalry and an unknown number of war elephantsthe survivors of the 37 with which he had left Iberiain Cisalpine Gaul. The Romans had already withdrawn to their winter quarters and were astonished by Hannibal&#x27;s appearance. 

The Romans went on the attack and the local Roman commander, the consul Publius Scipio, personally led a strong force of cavalry and light infantry against the Carthaginian cavalry at the Battle of Ticinus. He was soundly beaten and personally wounded. The Romans retreated to near Placentia, fortified their camp and awaited reinforcement. The Roman army in Sicily under Sempronius Longus was redeployed to the north and joined with Scipio&#x27;s force. Numidian cavalry lured Sempronius and his army out of their camp and onto ground of Hannibal&#x27;s choosing, where the Battle of the Trebia took place. Most of the Romans were killed or captured by the Carthaginians, but 10,000 under Sempronius fought their way to the safety of Placentia.

==Prelude==
When news of the defeat at the Trebia reached Rome, it caused great alarm. This calmed once Sempronius arrived to preside over the consular elections in the usual manner. Gnaeus Geminus and Gaius Flaminius were selected and Sempronius then returned to Placentia to see out his term to 15 March. The consuls-elect recruited further legions, both from Rome and its Latin allies; reinforced Sardinia and Sicily against the possibility of Carthaginian raids or invasion; placed garrisons at Tarentum and other places for similar reasons; built a fleet of 60 quinqueremes; and, established supply depots at Ariminum and Arretium in Etruria in preparation for marching north later in the year. Two armiesof four legions each, two Roman and two allied, but with stronger than usual cavalry contingentswere formed. One was stationed at Arretium and one on the Adriatic coast; they would be able to block Hannibal&#x27;s possible advance into central Italy and be well positioned to move north to operate in Cisalpine Gaul. In spite of their losses, the Romans fielded twenty-two legions in 217 BC, ten more than in 218 BC. The Gallic tribes in Cisalpine Gaul recognised the Carthaginians as the dominant force and sent plentiful supplies and many recruits to Hannibal&#x27;s camp.

In spring 217BC, probably in early May, the Carthaginians crossed the Apennines unopposed, surprising the Romans by taking a difficult but unguarded route. The Carthaginians moved south into Etruria (modern Tuscany), plundering the countryside, looting the plentiful stocks of food, razing the villages and small towns, and killing out of hand all adult men encountered. Hannibal learned that one Roman army was at Arretium and was eager to bring it to battle, before it could be reinforced: Hannibal surmised the Romans would have another army on the east coast.

Once he learned that he had been bypassed, Flaminius, the commander of the Roman army at Arretium, set off in pursuit. The modern historian Adrian Goldsworthy points out that as they passed through territory devastated by the Carthaginians, there would have been a feeling of military failure and humiliationthe army existed to protect its homelandand that the small farmers of the legions and their landowner officers would have taken this despoliation as an intense provocation. The Romans gained the impression, possibly fostered by Hannibal, that the Carthaginians were fleeing south before them; according to the ancient historian Polybius, they anticipated an easy victory. The Romans were pursuing so rapidly that they were unable to carry out proper reconnaissance, but they closed to less than a day&#x27;s march behind their opponents. The Carthaginians bypassed the Roman-garrisoned city of Cortona and on 20 June marched along the north shore of Lake Trasimene. Hannibal decided this was a suitable spot to turn and fight.

==Opposing forces==
=== Roman ===

Most male [[Roman citizenship|Roman citizens]] were liable for military service and would serve as [[infantry]], with a [[Equites|better-off minority]] providing a cavalry component. Traditionally, when at war the Romans would raise two legions, each of 4,200 infantry and 300 cavalry. Approximately 1,200 of the infantry, poorer or younger men unable to afford the armour and equipment of a standard [[legionary]], served as [[javelin]]-armed [[skirmisher]]s, known as ; they carried several javelins, which would be thrown from a distance, a short sword and a circular shield. The balance were equipped as [[heavy infantry]], with [[Body armor|body armour]], a large [[Scutum (shield)|shield]] and [[Gladius|short thrusting swords]]. They were divided into three ranks, of which the [[hastati|front rank]] also carried two javelins, while the [[principes|second]] and [[triari|third]] ranks had a [[Hasta (spear)|thrusting spear]] instead. Both legionary [[Maniple (military unit)|sub-units]] and individual legionaries fought in relatively open order. An army was usually formed by combining a Roman legion with a similarly sized and equipped legion provided by their Latin allies, but sometimes consisted of two Roman and two allied legions. Allied legions had a larger attached complement of cavalry than Roman ones. At Lake Trasimene, the Romans fielded four legionstwo Roman and two made up of alliesfor a total of approximately 25,000 men.

===Carthaginian===
Carthage usually recruited foreigners to make up its army. Many would be from North Africathese were frequently referred to as [[Ancient Libya|Libyans]]which provided several types of fighters, including: [[Close order formation|close-order]] infantry equipped with large shields, helmets, short swords and long thrusting [[spear]]s; javelin-armed light infantry skirmishers; close-order shock cavalry (also known as &quot;heavy cavalry&quot;) carrying spears; and light cavalry skirmishers who threw javelins from a distance and avoided close combat. Both Iberia and Gaul provided experienced infantry: unarmoured troops who would charge ferociously, but had a reputation for breaking off if a combat was protracted. Most of the African infantry would fight in a tightly packed formation known as a [[phalanx]], usually forming two or three lines. Specialist [[Balearic slinger|slingers]] were recruited from the [[Balearic Islands]].

The numbers fielded by the Carthaginians are not known, but an approximation can be made. Hannibal had arrived in Italy with 20,000 infantry and 6,000 cavalry, and had fought at the Trebia in December 218 BC with 31,000 and 11,000 respectively. In the wake of this victory, he was further heavily reinforced by local Gauls. In 216 BC, the Carthaginians, not having been reinforced since crossing the Apennines, had 40,000 infantry and 10,000 cavalry. It is usually assumed that more than 50,000 fought at Lake Trasimene. In any event, the Carthaginian army was considerably larger than the Roman.

==Battle==
=== Setting the ambush ===

The shoreline has changed since, but at the time of the battle, the road led along the north shore of the lake then turned south, still along the lakeshore, before climbing away from the lake through a [[Defile (geography)|defile]]. To the north of the road were a range of low hills that came closer to the lake towards the east, steadily reducing the open ground between them and the lake. The Carthaginians made camp where the hills were closest to the lake, near the defile. This was clearly visible to the Romans.

Once it was dark, Hannibal sent the components of his army on night marches behind the hills to the north of the lake to take up positions from which they could ambush the Roman army. Night marches are notoriously difficult and often result in units becoming lost in the dark or alerting their enemy. The Carthaginians avoided both of these and took up positions on the reverse slopes of the hills. The Carthaginian cavalry were positioned furthest to the west, the north-Italian Gallic infantry to their east and the experienced African and Iberian infantry furthest east, relatively close to their camp. Modern historians place the bulk of the many Carthaginian light infantry either around the defile and its mouth or as reinforcing the Gauls in the centre of the Carthaginian line.

On the morning of 21 June the Romans set off very early and marched eastward along the northern edge of the lake. Ancient accounts state that a thick morning mist near the lake limited visibility, but some modern historians have suggested this was either invented or exaggerated to excuse the Romans&#x27; subsequent unreadiness for battle. As Flaminius was expecting battle, the Romans probably marched in three parallel columns, which was their habit before a battle as this was relatively quicker to manoeuvre into a battle line compared with a single line of march. This swiftness was relative, as forming an army up in battle order was a complicated affair which would take several hours under any circumstances. The Romans would have had a screen of light infantry out to their front and, to a lesser extent, their flank, as skirmishing was usual before a battle with the armies&#x27; respective light troops shielding their close-order colleagues while they formed up. Flaminius did not send out cavalry scouts to make a more distant reconnaissance; Roman armies of the time rarely did so.

=== Springing the trap ===
The leading Romans made contact with the most easterly of the Carthaginians, probably some of the African or Iberian close-order infantry and the signal was given for all of the Carthaginians to advance, possibly by the sounding of trumpets. According to some ancient accounts, the Romans could hear these signals on their flank and to their rear, but could not see their enemy, which caused confusion. It would have taken several hours for the Romans to convert their formation into a battle array, even if they had known which direction to face. As it was, with the Carthaginians attacking unexpectedly from the flank and the rear, possibly with poor visibility, there was no chance to form even a rudimentary fighting line. Some Romans fled while others clustered into groups of various sizes, ready to engage the enemy on all sides. The fugitives and many of the impromptu Roman groups were rapidly cut down or captured. Other groups of Romans put up a stiff fight, especially in the centre, where the attacking Gauls suffered heavy casualties before beating down the trapped Romans after three hours of heavy combat.

According to Polybius, Flaminius was completely surprised and provided no effective leadership. The openly pro-Roman ancient historian [[Livy]], who otherwise paints a poor picture of Flaminius, recorded two centuries later that he was active and valiant in attempting to rally his army and organise a defence before being cut down by a Gaul, [[Ducarius]]. The trapped portion of the Roman army collapsed. Men attempted to swim across the lake and drowned; others waded out until the water was up to their necks and the Carthaginian cavalrymen swam their horses out to chop at their exposed heads.

The trap failed to close on the 6,000 Romans at the front of the column, who were possibly also those most prepared for battle, and they pushed their way out of the defile against little opposition. Realising that they could not affect the battle behind them, they marched on. Later in the day they were surrounded by pursuing Carthaginians and surrendered to a force under [[Maharbal]] on the promise of being disarmed and freed; &quot;with a garment apiece&quot; according to Livy. Hannibal disapproved and only applied this to the allied captives, while selling the Romans into slavery. Many of the Carthaginian infantry, especially the Libyans, equipped themselves with captured Roman armour.

=== Casualties and follow up ===

The ancient sources are unclear as to the fate of the approximately 25,000 Romans known to have been engaged. According to the contemporary annalist and senator [[Quintus Fabius Pictor|Fabius Pictor]], 15,000 were killed and 10,000 scattered. The usually reliable Polybius has 15,000 killed and most of the rest captured. Polybius reports losses of 1,500 killed for the Carthaginians, most of them Gauls; Livy gives 2,500 killed on the day and &quot;many&quot; who subsequently died of their wounds.

The second Roman army, originally positioned on the Adriatic coast and commanded by Gnaeus Geminus, had been marching west, intending to join up with Flaminius. Unaware that the destruction of Flaminius&#x27;s army had left the Carthaginians able to manoeuvre freely, Geminus&#x27;s entire cavalry force of 4,000 was scouting ahead when it was surprised by the Carthaginians a few days after Trasimene. Nearly 2,000 were killed in the first clash; the balance were surrounded and captured the next day. Geminus withdrew his infantry back to Ariminum (modern [[Rimini]]) on the Adriatic.

==Aftermath==
The Roman prisoners were badly treated by the Carthaginians, but the captured Latin allies were treated well and many were freed and sent back to their cities in the hope that they would speak highly of Carthaginian martial prowess and of their own treatment. Hannibal hoped some of these allies could be persuaded to [[Defection|defect]]. The Carthaginians continued their march through Etruria, then [[Umbria]], to the Adriatic coast, continuing their devastation and plundering of the territory they crossed and the killing of any adult men captured; the Gauls were especially brutal in this respect. Contemporary reports claim that the Carthaginian soldiers accumulated so much booty that they had to cease looting because they could not carry any more. The army then marched south into [[Apulia]], in the hope of winning over some of the ethnic [[Italiotes|Greek]] and [[Ancient peoples of Italy|Italic]] [[city state]]s of southern Italy.

The populace of Rome fell into a panic when word of the defeat was received. [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus]] was elected [[Roman dictator|dictator]] by the Roman Assembly and adopted the &quot;[[Fabian strategy]]&quot; of avoiding pitched conflict, relying instead on low-level harassment to wear the invader down while Rome rebuilt its military strength. Hannibal was left largely free to ravage Apulia for the next year, until the Romans ended the dictatorship and elected [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus (consul 219 BC)|Paullus]] and [[Gaius Terentius Varro|Varro]] as consuls in 216 BC. These more aggressive commanders offered battle to Hannibal, who accepted and won a [[Battle of Cannae|victory at Cannae]], where some 70,000 Romans were killed or captured; the modern historian [[Richard Miles (historian)|Richard Miles]] describes this as &quot;Rome&#x27;s greatest military disaster&quot;. Subsequently, the Carthaginians campaigned in southern Italy for a further 13 years.

In 204 BC [[Scipio Africanus|Publius Cornelius Scipio]], the son of the Scipio who had been wounded at Ticinus, invaded the Carthaginian homeland, defeated the Carthaginians in two major battles and won the allegiance of the [[Numidia]]n kingdoms of North Africa. Hannibal and the remnants of his army were recalled from Italy to confront him. They met at the [[Battle of Zama]] in October 202BC and Hannibal was decisively defeated. As a consequence, Carthage agreed to a [[peace treaty]] which stripped it of most of its territory and power.

===Evaluation===
According to the modern military historian [[Basil Liddell Hart]], Hannibal planned and executed &quot;the greatest ambush in history&quot;. The ambush and destruction of one army by another is widely considered a unique occurrence. Military historian [[Theodore Ayrault Dodge|Theodore Dodge]] notes that &quot;It is the only instance in history of lying in ambush with the whole of a large army&quot;. Historian Robert O&#x27;Connell writes that it was &quot;the only time an entire large army was effectively swallowed and destroyed by such a maneuver.&quot; The historian Toni Ñaco del Hoyo describes the Battle of Lake Trasimene as one of the three &quot;great military calamities&quot; suffered by the Romans in the first three years of the war, the others being [[Battle of the Trebia|the Trebia]] and [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]].

<text>Calcium chloride is an inorganic compound, a salt with the chemical formula . It is a white crystalline solid at room temperature, and it is highly soluble in water. It can be created by neutralising hydrochloric acid with calcium hydroxide.

Calcium chloride is commonly encountered as a hydrated solid with generic formula , where &quot;n&quot; = 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6. These compounds are mainly used for de-icing and dust control. Because the anhydrous salt is hygroscopic and deliquescent, it is used as a desiccant.
== History ==
Calcium chloride was apparently discovered in the 15th century but wasn&#x27;t studied properly until the 18th century. It was historically called &quot;fixed sal ammoniac&quot; () because it was synthesized during the distillation of ammonium chloride with lime and was nonvolatile (while the former appeared to sublime); in more modern times (18th-19th cc.) it was called &quot;muriate of lime&quot; ().

==Uses==

===De-icing and freezing-point depression===
By depressing the freezing point of water, calcium chloride is used to prevent ice formation and is used to de-ice. This application consumes the greatest amount of calcium chloride. Calcium chloride is relatively harmless to plants and soil. As a de-icing agent, it is much more effective at lower temperatures than sodium chloride. When distributed for this use, it usually takes the form of small, white spheres a few millimeters in diameter, called prills. Solutions of calcium chloride can prevent freezing at temperatures as low as −52 °C (−62 °F), making it ideal for filling agricultural implement tires as a liquid ballast, aiding traction in cold climates.

It is also used in domestic and industrial chemical air dehumidifiers.

===Road surfacing===
The second largest application of calcium chloride exploits its hygroscopic nature and the tackiness of its hydrates; calcium chloride is highly hygroscopic and its hydration is an exothermic process. A concentrated solution keeps a liquid layer on the surface of dirt roads, which suppresses the formation of dust. It keeps the finer dust particles on the road, providing a cushioning layer. If these are allowed to blow away, the large aggregate begins to shift around and the road breaks down. Using calcium chloride reduces the need for grading by as much as 50% and the need for fill-in materials as much as 80%.

===Food===
In the food industry, calcium chloride is frequently employed as a firming agent in canned vegetables, particularly for canned tomatoes and cucumber pickles. It is also used in firming soybean curds into tofu and in producing a caviar substitute from vegetable or fruit juices. It is also used to enhance the texture of various other products, such as whole apples, whole hot peppers, whole and sliced strawberries, diced tomatoes, and whole peaches.

The firming effect of calcium chloride can be attributed to several mechanisms:
# Complexation, since calcium ions form coordination complexes with pectin, a polysaccharide found in the cell wall and middle lamella of plant tissues.
# Membrane stabilization, since calcium ions contribute to the stabilization of the cell membrane.
# Turgor pressure regulation, since calcium ions influence cell turgor pressure, which is the pressure exerted by the cell contents against the cell wall.

Calcium chloride&#x27;s freezing-point depression properties are used to slow the freezing of the caramel in caramel-filled chocolate bars. Also, it is frequently added to sliced apples to maintain texture.

In brewing beer, calcium chloride is sometimes used to correct mineral deficiencies in the brewing water. It affects flavor and chemical reactions during the brewing process, and can also affect yeast function during fermentation.

In cheesemaking, calcium chloride is sometimes added to processed (pasteurized/homogenized) milk to restore the natural balance between calcium and protein in casein. It is added before the coagulant.

Calcium chloride is also commonly used as an &quot;electrolyte&quot; in sports drinks and other beverages; as a food additive used in conjunction with other inorganic salts it adds taste to bottled water.

The average intake of calcium chloride as food additives has been estimated to be 160–345 mg/day. Calcium chloride is permitted as a food additive in the European Union for use as a sequestrant and firming agent with the E number E509. It is considered as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Its use in organic crop production is generally prohibited under the US National Organic Program.
The elemental calcium content in calcium chloride hexahydrate (CaCl2·6H2O) is approximately 18.2%. This means that for every gram of calcium chloride hexahydrate, there are about 182 milligrams of elemental calcium.

For anhydrous calcium chloride (CaCl2), the elemental calcium content is almost twice higher, that is around 36.1% (for every gram of anhydrous calcium chloride there are about 361 milligrams of elemental calcium).

Calcium chloride has a very salty taste and can cause mouth and throat irritation at high concentrations, so it is typically not the first choice for long-term oral supplementation (as a calcium supplement). Calcium chloride, characterized by its low molecular weight and high water solubility, readily breaks down into calcium and chloride ions when exposed to water. These ions are efficiently absorbed from the intestine. Calcium chloride has the potential to release heat energy upon dissolution in water. This release of heat can lead to trauma and burns in the mouth, throat, esophagus, and stomach. In fact, there have been reported cases of stomach necrosis resulting from burns caused by accidental ingestions of big amounts of undissolved calcium chloride.

The extremely salty taste of calcium chloride is used to flavor pickles without increasing the food&#x27;s sodium content.

Calcium chloride is used to prevent cork spot and bitter pit on apples by spraying on the tree during the late growing season.

===Laboratory and related drying operations===
Drying tubes are frequently packed with calcium chloride. Kelp is dried with calcium chloride for use in producing sodium carbonate. Anhydrous calcium chloride has been approved by the FDA as a packaging aid to ensure dryness (CPG 7117.02).

The hydrated salt can be dried for re-use but will dissolve in its own water of hydration if heated quickly and form a hard amalgamated solid when cooled.

=== Metal reduction flux ===
Similarly, is used as a flux and electrolyte in the FFC Cambridge electrolysis process for titanium production, where it ensures the proper exchange of calcium and oxygen ions between the electrodes.

=== Medical use ===
Calcium chloride infusions may be used as an intravenous therapy to prevent hypocalcemia.

Calcium chloride is a highly soluble calcium salt. Hexahydrate calcium chloride (CaCl2·6H2O) has solubility in water of 811 g/L at 25 °C. Calcium chloride when taken orally completely dissociates into calcium ions (Ca2+) in the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in readily bioavailable calcium. The high concentration of calcium ions facilitates efficient absorption in the small intestine. However, the use of calcium chloride as a source of calcium taken orally is less common compared to other calcium salts because of potential adverse effects such as gastrointestinal irritation and discomfort.

When tasted, calcium chloride exhibits a distinctive bitter flavor alongside its salty taste. The bitterness is attributable to the calcium ions and their interaction with human taste receptors: certain members of the TAS2R family of bitter taste receptors respond to calcium ions; the bitter perception of calcium is thought to be a protective mechanism to avoid ingestion of toxic substances, as many poisonous compounds taste bitter. While chloride ions (Cl⁻) primarily contribute to saltiness, at higher concentrations, they can enhance the bitter sensation. The combination of calcium and chloride ions intensifies the overall bitterness. At lower concentrations, calcium chloride may taste predominantly salty. The salty taste arises from the electrolyte nature of the compound, similar to sodium chloride (table salt). As the concentration increases, the bitter taste becomes more pronounced: the increased presence of calcium ions enhances the activation of bitterness receptors.

===Other applications===

Calcium chloride is used in concrete mixes to accelerate the initial setting, but chloride ions lead to corrosion of steel rebar, so it should not be used in reinforced concrete. The anhydrous form of calcium chloride may also be used for this purpose and can provide a measure of the moisture in concrete.

Calcium chloride is included as an additive in plastics and in fire extinguishers, in blast furnaces as an additive to control scaffolding (clumping and adhesion of materials that prevent the furnace charge from descending), and in fabric softener as a thinner.

The exothermic dissolution of calcium chloride is used in self-heating cans and heating pads.

Calcium chloride is used as a water hardener in the maintenance of hot tub water, as insufficiently hard water can lead to corrosion and foaming.

In the oil industry, calcium chloride is used to increase the density of solids-free brines. It is also used to provide inhibition of swelling clays in the water phase of invert emulsion drilling fluids.

Calcium chloride () acts as flux material, decreasing the melting point, in the Davy process for the industrial production of sodium metal through the electrolysis of molten .

Calcium chloride is also used in the production of activated charcoal.

Calcium chloride can be used to precipitate fluoride ions from water as insoluble .

Calcium chloride is also an ingredient used in ceramic slipware. It suspends clay particles so that they float within the solution, making it easier to use in a variety of slipcasting techniques.

For watering plants to use as a fertilizer, a moderate concentration of calcium chloride is used to avoid potential toxicity: 5 to 10 mM (millimolar) is generally effective and safe for most plants—that is of anhydrous calcium chloride () per liter of water or of calcium chloride hexahydrate (·6) per liter of water. Calcium chloride solution is used immediately after preparation to prevent potential alterations in its chemical composition. Besides that, calcium chloride is highly hygroscopic, meaning it readily absorbs moisture from the air. If the solution is left standing, it can absorb additional water vapor, leading to dilution and a decrease in the intended concentration. Prolonged standing may lead to the precipitation of calcium hydroxide or other insoluble calcium compounds, reducing the availability of calcium ions in the solution and reducing the effectiveness of the solution as a calcium source for plants. Nutrient solutions can become a medium for microbial growth if stored for extended periods. Microbial contamination may alter the composition of the solution and potentially introduce pathogens to the plants. When dissolved in water, calcium chloride can undergo hydrolysis, especially over time, which can lead to the formation of small amounts of hydrochloric acid and calcium hydroxide: +2 ⇌ +2. This reaction can lower the pH of the solution, making it more acidic. Acidic solutions may harm plant tissues and disrupt nutrient uptake.

Calcium chloride dihydrate (20 percent by weight) dissolved in ethanol (95 percent ABV) has been used as a sterilant for male animals. The solution is injected into the testes of the animal. Within one month, necrosis of testicular tissue results in sterilization.

Cocaine producers in Colombia import tons of calcium chloride to recover solvents that are on the INCB Red List and are more tightly controlled.

==Hazards==
Although the salt is non-toxic in small quantities when wet, the strongly hygroscopic properties of non-hydrated calcium chloride present some hazards. It can act as an irritant by desiccating moist skin. Solid calcium chloride dissolves exothermically, and burns can result in the mouth and esophagus if it is ingested. Ingestion of concentrated solutions or solid products may cause gastrointestinal irritation or ulceration.

Consumption of calcium chloride can lead to hypercalcemia.

==Properties==

Calcium chloride dissolves in water, producing chloride and the aquo complex . In this way, these solutions are sources of &quot;free&quot; calcium and free chloride ions. This description is illustrated by the fact that these solutions react with phosphate sources to give a solid precipitate of calcium phosphate:

Calcium chloride has a very high enthalpy change of solution, indicated by considerable temperature rise accompanying dissolution of the anhydrous salt in water. This property is the basis for its largest-scale application.

Aqueous solutions of calcium chloride tend to be slightly acidic due to the influence of the chloride ions on the hydrogen ion concentration in water. The slight acidity of calcium chloride solutions is primarily due to the increased ionic strength of the solution, which can influence the activity of hydrogen ions and lower the pH slightly. The pH of calcium chloride in aqueous solution is the following:

Molten calcium chloride can be electrolysed to give calcium metal and chlorine gas:

==Preparation==
In much of the world, calcium chloride is derived from limestone as a by-product of the Solvay process, which follows the net reaction below:
North American consumption in 2002 was 1,529,000 tonnes (3.37 billion pounds). In the US, most calcium chloride is obtained by purification from brine. As with most bulk commodity salt products, trace amounts of other cations from the alkali metals and alkaline earth metals (groups 1 and 2) and other anions from the halogens (group 17) typically occur.

===Occurrence===
Calcium chloride occurs as the rare evaporite minerals sinjarite (dihydrate) and antarcticite (hexahydrate). Another natural hydrate known is ghiaraite – a tetrahydrate. The related minerals chlorocalcite (potassium calcium chloride, ) and tachyhydrite (calcium magnesium chloride, ) are also very rare. The same is true for rorisite, CaClF (calcium chloride fluoride).

<text>A Mediterranean climate ( ), also called a dry summer climate, described by Köppen and Trewartha as Cs, is a temperate climate type that occurs in the lower mid-latitudes (normally 30 to 44 north and south latitude). Such climates typically have dry summers and wet winters, with summer conditions being hot and winter conditions typically being mild. These weather conditions are typically experienced in the majority of Mediterranean-climate regions and countries, but remain highly dependent on proximity to the ocean, altitude and geographical location.

The dry summer climate is found throughout the warmer middle latitudes, affecting almost exclusively the western portions of continents in relative proximity to the coast. The climate type&#x27;s name is in reference to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean Sea, which mostly share this type of climate, but it can also be found in the Atlantic portions of Iberia and Northwest Africa, the Pacific portions of the United States and Chile, extreme west areas of Argentina, around Cape Town in South Africa, parts of Southwest and South Australia, and parts of Central Asia. They tend to be found in proximity (both poleward and near the coast) of desert and semi-arid climates, and equatorward of oceanic climates.

Mediterranean climate zones are typically located along the western coasts of landmasses, between roughly 30 and 45 degrees north or south of the equator. The main cause of Mediterranean, or dry summer, climate is the subtropical ridge, which extends towards the pole of the hemisphere in question during the summer and migrates towards the equator during the winter. This is due to the seasonal poleward-equatorward variations of temperatures.

The resulting vegetation of Mediterranean climates are the garrigue or maquis in the European Mediterranean Basin, the chaparral in California, the fynbos in South Africa, the mallee in Australia, and the matorral in Chile. Areas with this climate are also where the so-called &quot;Mediterranean trinity&quot; of major agricultural crops have traditionally been successfully grown (wheat, grapes and olives). As a result, these regions are notable for their high-quality wines, grapeseed/olive oils, and bread products.

==Köppen climate classification==
Under the Köppen climate classification, &quot;hot dry-summer&quot; climates (classified as &quot;Csa&quot;) and &quot;cool dry-summer&quot; climates (classified as &quot;Csb&quot;) are often referred to as just &quot;Mediterranean&quot;. Under the Köppen climate system, the first letter indicates the climate group (in this case temperate climates). Temperate climates or &quot;&quot;C&quot; zones average temperature above (or ), but below , in their coolest months. The second letter indicates the precipitation pattern (&quot;s&quot; represents dry summers). Köppen has defined a dry summer month as a month with less than of precipitation and as a month within the high-sun months of April to September, in the case of the Northern Hemisphere and October to March, in the case of the Southern Hemisphere, and it also must contain exactly or less than one-third that of the wettest winter month. Some, however, use a level. The third letter indicates the degree of summer heat: &quot;a&quot; represents an average temperature in the warmest month above , while &quot;b&quot;&quot; indicates the average temperature in the warmest month below . There is a &quot;c&quot; with 3 or less months&#x27; average temperature above , but this climate is rare and is very isolated.

Under the Köppen classification, dry-summer climates (&quot;Csa&quot;, &quot;Csb&quot;) usually occur on the western sides of continents. &quot;Csb&quot; zones in the Köppen system include areas normally not associated with Mediterranean climates but with Oceanic climates, such as much of the Pacific Northwest, much of southern Chile, parts of west-central Argentina, and parts of New Zealand. Additional highland areas in the subtropics also meet &quot;Cs&quot; requirements, though they, too, are not normally associated with Mediterranean climates. The same goes for a number of oceanic islands such as Madeira, the Juan Fernández Islands, the western part of the Canary Islands, and the eastern part of the Azores.

Under Trewartha&#x27;s modified Köppen climate classification, the two major requirements for a &quot;Cs&quot; climate are revised. Under Trewartha&#x27;s system, at least eight months must have average temperatures of or higher (subtropical), and the average annual precipitation must not exceed , as well as satisfying Köppen&#x27;s precipitation requirements.

==Precipitation==
Poleward extension and expansion of the subtropical anticyclone over the oceans bring subsiding air to the region in summer, with clear skies and high temperatures. When the anticyclone moves Equator-ward in winter, it is replaced by traveling, frontal cyclones with their attendant precipitation.

During summer, regions of the Mediterranean climate are strongly influenced by the subtropical ridge which keeps atmospheric conditions very dry with minimal cloud coverage. In some areas, such as coastal California, the cold current has a stabilizing effect on the surrounding air, further reducing the chances for rain, but often causing thick layers of marine fog that usually evaporates by mid-day. Similar to desert climates, in many Mediterranean climates there is a strong diurnal character to daily temperatures in the warm summer months due to strong solar heating during the day from sunlight and rapid cooling at night.

In winter, the subtropical ridge migrates towards the equator and leaves the area, making rainfall much more likely. As a result, areas with this climate receive almost all of their precipitation during their winter and spring seasons, and may go anywhere from four to six months during the summer and early fall without having any significant precipitation. In the lower latitudes, precipitation usually decreases in both the winter and summer due to higher evapotranspiration. Toward the polar latitudes, total moisture usually increases; for instance, the Mediterranean climate in Southern Europe has more rain. The rainfall also tends to be more evenly distributed throughout the year in Southern Europe, while in places such as Southern California, the summer is nearly or completely dry. In places where evapotranspiration is higher, steppe climates tend to prevail, but still follow the basic pattern of the Mediterranean climates.

Irregularity of the rainfall, which can vary considerably from year to year, accentuates the droughts of the Mediterranean climate. Rain does not fall evenly, nor does the rain arrive at the same time or within the same intervals. In Gibraltar, for instance, rain starts falling nearly half a season earlier than at the Dead Sea. In the Holy Land no rain at all falls in summer but early rains may come in autumn.

== Temperature ==

The majority of the regions with Mediterranean climates have relatively mild winters and very warm summers. However, winter and summer temperatures can vary greatly between different regions with a Mediterranean climate. For instance, in the case of winters, Funchal experiences mild to warm temperatures in the winter, with frost and snowfall almost unknown, whereas Tashkent has cold winters with annual frosts and snowfall; or, to consider summer, Seville experiences rather high temperatures in that season. In contrast, San Francisco has cool summers with daily highs around due to the continuous upwelling of cold subsurface waters along the coast.

Because most regions with a Mediterranean climate are near large bodies of water, temperatures are generally moderate, with a comparatively small range of temperatures between the winter low and summer high unlike (the relatively rare) dry-summer humid continental climates (although the daily diurnal range of temperature during the summer is large due to dry and clear conditions, except along the immediate coastlines). Temperatures during winter only occasionally fall below the freezing point and snow is generally seldom seen. Summer temperatures can be cool to very hot, depending on the distance from a large body of water, elevation, and latitude, among other factors. Strong winds from inland desert regions can sometimes boost summer temperatures up, quickly increasing the risk of wildfires. Notable exceptions to the usual proximity from bodies of water, thus featuring extremely high summer temperatures and cooler winters, include south-eastern Turkey and northern Iraq (Urfa, Erbil), surrounded by hot deserts to the south and mountains to the north. Those places routinely experience summer daily means of over and daily highs above , while receiving enough rainfall in winter not to fall into arid or semi-arid classifications.

As in every climatologic domain, the highland locations of the Mediterranean domain can present cooler temperatures in the summer and winter than the lowland areas, temperatures which can sometimes prohibit the growth of typical cold-sensitive Mediterranean plants. Some Spanish authors opt to use the term &#x27;continental Mediterranean climate&#x27; () for some regions with lower temperatures in winter than the coastal areas, but Köppen&#x27;s &quot;Cs&quot; zones show no distinction as long as winter temperature means stay above freezing.

Additionally, the temperature and rainfall pattern for a &quot;Csa&quot; or even a &quot;Csb&quot; climate can exist as a microclimate in some high-altitude locations adjacent to a rare tropical &quot;As&quot; (tropical savanna climate with dry summers, typically in a rainshadow region, as in Hawaii).
These have a favourable climate, with mild wet winters and fairly warm, dry summers.

==Mediterranean biome==

The Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub biome is closely associated with Mediterranean climate zones, as are unique freshwater communities, though vegetation native to the Mediterranean climate zone can also be found in the approximate nearby climate zones, which usually tend to be the humid subtropical, oceanic and/or semi-arid zones, depending on the region and location. Particularly distinctive of the climate are sclerophyll shrublands, called maquis in the Mediterranean Basin, chaparral in California, matorral in Chile, fynbos in South Africa, and mallee and kwongan shrublands in Australia.

Mediterranean vegetation shows a number of adaptations to drought, grazing, and frequent fire regimes. The small sclerophyllous leaves that characterize many of the perennial shrubs of this biome, help conserve water and prevent nutrient loss. The soils generally are of low fertility, and many plants have mutualistic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.

Aquatic communities in Mediterranean climate regions are adapted to a yearly cycle in which abiotic (environmental) controls of stream populations and community structure dominate during floods, biotic components (e.g. competition and predation) controls become increasingly important as the flood discharge declines, and environmental controls regain dominance as environmental conditions become very harsh (i.e. hot and dry); as a result, these communities are well suited to recover from droughts, floods, and fires. Aquatic organisms in these regions show distinct long-term patterns in their structure and function, and are also highly sensitive to the recent effects of climate change.

===Natural vegetation===
The native vegetation of Mediterranean climate lands must be adapted to survive long, hot summer droughts in summer and prolonged wet periods in winter. Mediterranean vegetation examples include the following:
* Evergreen trees: eucalyptus, casuarina, melaleuca, pine, and cypress
* Deciduous trees: sycamore and some types of oak
* Fruit trees: olive, figs, walnuts and grapes
* Shrubs: rosemary, &quot;Erica&quot;, &quot;Banksia&quot;, buckeyes, chamise, Bay laurel and some oaks.
* Sub-shrubs: lavender, &quot;Halimium&quot;, grevillea and sagebrush
* Grasses: grassland types, &quot;Themeda triandra&quot;, bunchgrasses; sedges, and rushes
* Herbs: Achillea, Dietes, Helichrysum and Penstemon

Many native vegetations in Mediterranean climate area valleys have been cleared for agriculture and farming. In places such as the Sacramento Valley and Oxnard Plain in California, draining marshes and estuaries combined with supplemental irrigation has led to a century of intensive agriculture. Much of the Overberg in the southern Cape of South Africa, was once covered with renosterveld, but has likewise been largely converted to agriculture, mainly for wheat. In hillside and mountainous areas, away from the urban sprawls, ecosystems and habitats of native vegetation are more sustained and undisturbed.

The fynbos vegetation in the South-western Cape in South Africa is famed for its high floral diversity, and includes such plant types as members of the Restionaceae, Ericas (Heaths) and Proteas. Representatives of the Proteaceae also grow in Australia, such as Banksias. The palette of California native plants is also renowned for its species and cultivar diversity.

==Hot-summer Mediterranean climate==
This subtype of the Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot;) is the most common form of the Mediterranean climate, therefore it is also known as a &quot;typical Mediterranean climate&quot;. As stated earlier, regions with this form of a Mediterranean climate experience average monthly temperatures in excess of during its warmest month and an average in the coldest month between or, in some applications, between . Regions with this form of the Mediterranean climate typically experience hot, sometimes very hot and dry summers. Winters can be mild, cool or chilly, and some cities in this region receive somewhat regular snowfall (e.g. Kermanshah), while others do not receive any (e.g. Casablanca).

&quot;Csa&quot; climates are mainly found around the Mediterranean Sea, southern Australia, southwestern South Africa, sections of Central Asia, northern sections of Iran and Iraq, the interior of northern California west of the Sierra Nevada, along the Wasatch Front in Utah, and inland areas of southern Oregon west of the Cascade Mountains. Southern California&#x27;s coasts also experience hot summers due to the shielding effect of the Channel Islands. However, unshielded areas of that coastline can have warm-summer Mediterranean climates with hot-summer areas just a few kilometres inland.

==Warm-summer Mediterranean climate==

Occasionally also termed the &quot;cool-summer Mediterranean climate&quot;, this subtype of the Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csb&quot;) is less common and involves warm (but not hot) and dry summers, with no average monthly temperatures above during its warmest month and as usual an average in the coldest month between or, in some applications, between .

Also, at least four months must average above .

Cool ocean currents, upwelling and higher latitudes are often the reason for this cooler type of Mediterranean climate.

The other main reason for this cooler type is the altitude. For instance, Menton on the French coast has a Csa climate while Castellar, Alpes-Maritimes, the adjacent town just north of Menton, with an altitude between , has a Csb climate instead. The village of Siah Bisheh in Northern Iran also has a Csb climate because of its location inside the Alborz mountains.

Winters in this zone are rainy and can be mild to chilly. Some locales in this zone experience some amount of snowfall, while others do not.

&quot;Csb&quot; climates are found in northwestern Iberian Peninsula (namely Galicia and the Norte region and west coast of Portugal), in coastal Northern California, in the Pacific Northwest (namely western Washington, western Oregon and southern portions of Vancouver Island in British Columbia), in central Chile, in parts of southern Australia and in sections of southwestern South Africa. A few locations close to the south coast of England such as Weymouth and Portland just scrape into this climate classification due to very low rainfall in July. A trend towards slightly drier summers during the 1971–2000 climate average period, meant that this classification previously extended slightly further to include a few other weather stations in southern England, such as Bognor Regis and Teignmouth. Rarer instances of this climate can be found in relatively small and isolated high altitude areas of the Andes in Northern Ecuador, Peru, Colombia, and Western Venezuela.



==Cold-summer Mediterranean climate==

The cold-summer subtype of the Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csc&quot;) is rare and predominantly found at scattered high-altitude locations along the west coasts of North and South America having a similar climate. This type is characterized by cool, dry summers, with less than four months with a mean temperature at or above , as well as with cool, wet winters, with no winter month having a mean temperature below (or , depending on the isotherm used). Regions in the Americas with this climate are influenced by the dry-summer trend (though briefly) that extends considerably poleward along the west coast, as well as the moderating influences of high altitude and relative proximity to the Pacific Ocean. These conditions maintain an unusually narrow temperature range through the year for climate zones at such distances from coasts.

In North America, areas with &quot;Csc&quot; climate can be found in the Olympic, Cascade, Klamath, and Sierra Nevada ranges in Washington, Oregon and California. These locations are found at high altitude nearby lower altitude regions characterized by a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csb&quot;) or hot-summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot;). A rare instance of this climate occurs in the tropics, on Haleakalā Summit in Hawaii.

In South America, &quot;Csc&quot; regions can be found along the Andes in Chile and Argentina. The town of Balmaceda, Chile is one of the few towns confirmed to have this climate.

Small areas with a &quot;Csc&quot; climate can be found at high elevations in Corsica.

In Norway, the small fishing village of Røstlandet, in Røst Municipality, above the Arctic Circle has a climate bordering on &quot;Csc&quot; and is known as a &quot;climatic anomaly&quot; due to abnormally warm temperatures despite its latitude located above 67°N latitude.

<text>Wigston, or Wigston Magna, is a town in the Oadby and Wigston district of Leicestershire, England, just south of Leicester on the A5199. It had a population of 32,321 in 2011.

==Geography==
Wigston is south of the city of Leicester, at the centre of Leicestershire and the East Midlands. Oadby is to the east, connected by the B582 road. To the west along the B582, or Blaby Road is South Wigston, .

The Grand Union Canal runs along a southern route below Wigston from Newton Harcourt , Kilby Bridge , and for several miles through South Wigston, Glen Parva , Blaby and on towards Leicester.

Wigston&#x27;s population of approximately 32,000 live in both the post-war private suburban housing estates surrounding the old town centre, and the 19th century buildings now sandwiched between modern housing developments. The oldest of the post-war developments is Wigston Fields north of Wigston towards Knighton and Leicester; the Meadows and Little Hill estates were developed in the 1970s and 1980s to the east and south of Wigston&#x27;s old centre. Wigston Harcourt is an area of housing developed up until the early 1990s between the Little Hill and Meadows estates. These three estates mark the boundary of the greater Leicester urban area, beyond which lies agricultural land.

==History==
One of the earliest records of Wigston is in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Wichingstone&quot; in the ancient wapentake of Guthlaxton, listed amongst the lands held by Hugh de Grandmesnil for the King.

In the Middle Ages it was known as Wigston Two Spires as, unusually, there were two mediaeval churches there, All Saints&#x27; and St Wistan&#x27;s.

St Wistan&#x27;s is so called because it was one of the places where the body of St Wistan or Wigstan rested before burial. Wigstan was a Mercian prince who was assassinated, but was regarded as a martyr. He was initially buried at Repton, but his body was then moved to Evesham.

All Saints&#x27; (illustrated above right) a fine medieval building in the Transitional style has a western steeple (one of the finest in the county); from the tower three monster arches lead into the nave; benath a sepulchral arch is a coffin lid surmounted by a headless figure.

Wigston was the subject of W. G. Hoskins&#x27;s pioneering historical study, &quot;The Midland Peasant&quot; (London: Macmillan, 1965), which traced the social history of this town from earliest recorded history into the 19th century.

===Notable people===
It was the birthplace of George Davenport, a notorious highwayman; Abigail Herrick, the mother of Jonathan Swift, author of &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;; former Leicester Tigers and England scrum-half Harry Ellis who attended Bushloe High School; and former Leicester Sound and BBC Radio Leicester presenter, Mark Hayman. Graham Chapman, of Monty Python fame, lived (around 1951/52) in what was then Wigston police station, (the building on the corner of Pullman Road – opposite the swimming baths) during the time that his father was the inspector there. He attended South Wigston Junior School. Author and journalist John Marquis was born in Wigston and educated at Abington and Guthlaxton schools. The Leicester City footballer Howard Riley was also Wigston born and bred. Composer and piano virtuoso Michael Garrett was educated at Guthlaxton school. The music hall star Gertie Gitana is buried in Wigston cemetery, having been married for many years to local theatrical impresario Don Ross, who was born in the town. She died in the 1950s, having been a showbiz celebrity in the early years of the 20th century. Another Guthlaxton pupil was prominent policeman Geoffrey Barrett, who received a Governor&#x27;s commendation as a member of the Hong Kong anti-corruption squad in the 1970s and ended his career as head of the Leicester murder squad.

Henry Davis Pochin, the manufacturing chemist who later owned the Bodnant Estate (now the National Trust&#x27;s Bodnant Garden), was born in Wigston, son of another notable householder, William Pochin.

===Museum===

Bushloe House, currently the offices of Oadby and Wigston Borough Council, was originally a c. 1850 house which was extended c. 1880. The interior decoration of the house and the design of most of the furniture (and possibly the design of the extension) was carried out by Christopher Dresser for the owner, his solicitor, Hiram Abiff Owston (1830–1905).

There is a Framework Knitting Museum here, as it was an important occupation in this area from the 17th to 19th centuries. Hosiery manufacture continued to be an important industry in the town after the decline of hand process of framework knitting with manufacturing firms such as Two Steeples, George Deacon and sons, Wigston Co-Operative Hosiers, A H Broughton and William Holmes. In neighbouring South Wigston Henry Bates was the leading hosiery manufacturer.

==Economy==

Since the 1980s Wigston&#x27;s retail economy has become increasingly dependent on national retailers. Up to 50% of retail in the town belongs to supermarkets and chain stores. The share of local business has caused local and independent businesses to close. This followed the trend of the 1990s homogenisation of British high streets. There are also a number of independent stores including several charity shops, two car dealerships, hair and beauty salons, opticians, florists, fish and chip shop, newsagents, and public houses.

In January 2022 W. H. Cox greengrocers located on Leicester Road (opposite Bell Street) announced it would be closing after trading for 134 years.

==Education==
There are numerous primary schools in Wigston including All Saints Primary School, Glenmere Primary School, Little Hill Primary School, The Meadow Community Primary School, Thythorn Field Community Primary School and Water Leys Primary School.

Wigston Academy is the secondary school for the area. It was formed in September 2015 from the merger of Abington Academy and Bushloe High School. Wigston College (formerly known as Guthlaxton College) is the post-16 provider for the area. Both institutions are part of Wigston Academies Trust.

Wigston Birkett House Community Special School is a special school located in the town that serves the wider area.
South Leicestershire College is a large further education provider for the area. It was rebuilt on Canal Street, South Wigston in 2010.

1461 (Wigston) Squadron of the Air Training Corps is located in Tigers Road, South Wigston, and recruits many members from the schools in Wigston.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC East Midlands and ITV Central. Television signals are received from the Waltham TV transmitter. 

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Leicester, Capital East Midlands, Smooth East Midlands, Hits Radio East Midlands, Greatest Hits Radio Midlands, and Cross Counties Radio, a community based radio station. 

The town is served by the local newspaper, Leicester Mercury (formerly Oadby, Wigston &amp; Blaby Mail). 

==Transport==
South Wigston railway station lies on the Birmingham to Peterborough Line. Trains to Leicester run every hour and take five minutes.

Wigston Magna and the surrounding estates are served by bus services operated by Arriva Midlands and Centrebus.

<text>A clothes iron (also flatiron, smoothing iron, dry iron, steam iron or simply iron) is a small appliance that, when heated, is used to press clothes to remove wrinkles and unwanted creases. Domestic irons generally range in operating temperature from between to . It is named for the metal (iron) of which the device was historically made, and the use of it is generally called ironing, the final step in the process of laundering clothes. 

Ironing works by loosening the ties between the long chains of molecules that exist in polymer fiber materials. With the heat and the weight of the ironing plate, the fibers are stretched and the fabric maintains its new shape when cool. Some materials, such as cotton, require the use of water to loosen the intermolecular bonds.

==History and development==

Before the introduction of electricity, irons were heated by combustion, either in a fire or with some internal arrangement. The said iron was made as a solid piece of iron with a handle and was heated, for example, on a wood stove and used to smooth clothes. It can also be called a smoothing iron. An &quot;electric flatiron&quot; was invented by American Henry W. Seely and patented on June 6, 1882. It weighed almost and took a long time to heat. The UK Electricity Association is reported to have said that an electric iron with a carbon arc appeared in France in 1880, but this is considered doubtful.

Two of the oldest sorts of iron were either containers filled with a burning substance, or solid lumps of metal which could be heated directly.

Metal pans filled with hot coals were used for smoothing fabrics in China in the 1st century BC. A later design consisted of an iron box which could be filled with hot coals, which had to be periodically aerated by attaching a bellows. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, there were many irons in use that were heated by fuels such as kerosene, ethanol, whale oil, natural gas, carbide gas (acetylene, as with carbide lamps), or even gasoline. Some houses were equipped with a system of pipes for distributing natural gas or carbide gas to different rooms in order to operate appliances such as irons, in addition to lights. Despite the risk of fire, liquid-fuel irons were sold in U.S. rural areas up through World War II. In Kerala, India, burning coconut shells were traditionally used as an alternative to charcoal due to their comparable heating capacity. This method is still employed as a backup option, particularly during frequent power outages. Other box irons had heated metal inserts instead of hot coals.

From the 17th century, &quot;sadirons&quot; or &quot;sad irons&quot; (from Middle English &quot;sad&quot;, meaning &quot;solid&quot;, used in English through the 1800s) began to be used. They were thick slabs of cast iron, triangular and with a handle, heated in a fire or on a stove. These were also called flat irons. A laundry worker would employ a cluster of solid irons that were heated from a single source: As the iron currently in use cooled down, it could be quickly replaced by a hot one. 

In the industrialized world, these designs have been superseded by the electric iron, which uses resistive heating from an electric current. The hot plate, called the &quot;sole plate&quot;, is made of aluminium or stainless steel polished to be as smooth as possible; it is sometimes coated with a low-friction heat-resistant plastic to reduce friction below that of the metal plate. The heating element is controlled by a thermostat that switches the current on and off to maintain the selected temperature. The invention of the resistively heated electric iron is credited to Henry W. Seeley of New York City in 1882. In the same year an iron heated by a carbon arc was introduced in France, but was too dangerous to be successful. The early electric irons had no easy way to control their temperature, and the first thermostatically controlled electric iron appeared in the 1920s. The first commercially available electric steam iron was introduced in 1926 by a New York drying and cleaning company, Eldec, but was not a commercial success. The patent for an electric steam iron and dampener was issued to Max Skolnik of Chicago in 1934. In 1938, Skolnik granted the Steam-O-Matic Corporation of New York the exclusive right to manufacture steam-electric irons. This was the first steam iron to achieve any degree of popularity, and led the way to more widespread use of the electric steam iron during the 1940s and 1950s.

===Types and names===

Historically, irons have had several variations and have thus been called by many names:

* Flatiron (American English), flat iron (British English) or smoothing iron
: The general name for a hand-held iron consisting simply of a handle and a solid, flat, metal base, and named for the flat ironing face used to smooth clothes.
* Sad iron or sadiron
: Mentioned above, meaning &quot;solid&quot; or heavy iron, where the base is a solid block of metal, sometimes used to refer to irons with heavier bases than a typical &quot;flatiron&quot;.
* Box iron, ironing box, charcoal iron, ox-tongue iron or slug iron
: Mentioned above; the base is a container, into which hot coals or a metal brick or slug can be inserted to keep the iron heated. The ox-tongue iron is named for the particular shape of the insert, referred to as an ox-tongue slug.
* Goose, tailor&#x27;s goose or, in Scots, gusing iron
: A type of flat iron or sad iron named for the goose-like curve in its neck, and (in the case of &quot;tailor&#x27;s goose&quot;) its usage by tailors. 
* Goffering iron
: This type of iron, now obsolete, consists of a metal cylinder oriented horizontally on a stand. It was used to iron ruffs and collars.

== Hygiene ==
Proper ironing of clothes has proven to be an effective method to avoid infections like those caused by lice.

==Features==
Modern irons for home use can have the following features:
* A design that allows the iron to be set down, usually standing on its end, without the hot soleplate touching anything that could be damaged;
* A thermostat ensuring maintenance of a constant temperature;
* A temperature control dial allowing the user to select the operating temperatures (usually marked with types of cloth rather than temperatures: &quot;silk&quot;, &quot;wool&quot;, &quot;cotton&quot;, &quot;linen&quot;, etc.);
* An electrical cord with heat-resistant silicone rubber insulation;
* Injection of steam through the fabric during the ironing process;
** A water reservoir inside the iron used for steam generation;
** An indicator showing the amount of water left in the reservoir,
** Constant steam: constantly sends steam through the hot part of the iron into the clothes;
** Steam burst: sends a burst of steam through the clothes when the user presses a button;
** (advanced feature) Dial controlling the amount of steam to emit as a constant stream;
** (advanced feature) Anti-drip system;
* Cord control: the point at which the cord attaches to the iron has a spring to hold the cord out of the way while ironing and likewise when setting down the iron (prevents fires, is more convenient, etc.);
* A retractable cord for easy storage;
* (advanced feature) non-stick coating along the sole plate to help the iron glide across the fabric
* (advanced feature) Anti-burn control: if the iron is left flat (possibly touching clothes) for too long, the iron shuts off to prevent scorching and fires;
* (advanced feature) Energy saving control: if the iron is left undisturbed for several (10 or 15) minutes, the iron shuts off.
* Cordless irons: the iron is placed on a stand for a short period to warm up, using thermal mass to stay hot for a short period. These are useful for light loads only. Battery power is not viable for irons as they require more power than practical batteries can provide.
* (advanced feature) 3-way automatic shut-off
* (advanced feature) self-cleaning
*(advanced feature) Anti-scale to help remove lime scale buildup from using hard water for a long time.
* (advanced feature) vertical steam to help remove creases and wrinkles by holding an iron vertically and steaming material close to it.

==Collections==
One of the world&#x27;s larger collection of irons, comprising 1300 historical examples of irons from Germany and the rest of the world, is housed in Gochsheim Castle, near Karlsruhe, Germany.

Many ethnographical museums around the world have collections of irons. In Ukraine, for example, about 150 irons are the part of the exhibition of the Radomysl Castle in Ukraine.

==Ironing center==

An ironing center, steam ironing station, or steam generator iron is a device consisting of a clothes iron and a separate steam-generating tank. By having a separate tank, the ironing unit can generate more steam than a conventional iron, making steam ironing faster. Such ironing facilities take longer to warm up than conventional irons, and cost more.

<text>Hinckley and Bosworth is a local government district with borough status in Leicestershire, England. The council is based in Hinckley, the largest town. The borough also includes the town of Earl Shilton and numerous villages and surrounding rural areas. The Bosworth in the borough&#x27;s name refers to the small market town of Market Bosworth, near which the Battle of Bosworth Field was fought in 1485.

The neighbouring districts are North West Leicestershire, Charnwood, Blaby, Rugby, Nuneaton and Bedworth and North Warwickshire.

==History==
The district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the area of two former districts, which were both abolished at the same time:
*Hinckley Urban District
*Market Bosworth Rural District (except parish of Ibstock, which went to North West Leicestershire)

The government initially named the new district &quot;Bosworth&quot;. The shadow council elected to oversee the transition to the new system requested a change to &quot;Hinckley and Bosworth&quot;, which was agreed by the government on 20 November 1973, before the new district formally came into being. The new district was awarded borough status from its creation, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor.

==Governance==
Hinckley and Bosworth Borough Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Leicestershire County Council. Much of the borough is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
The council has been under Liberal Democrat majority control since 2019.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until coming into its powers on 1 April 1974. Since 1974 political control of the council has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The role of mayor is largely ceremonial in Hinckley and Bosworth. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 2003 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election and subsequent changes of allegiance in May 2024, the composition of the council was:

The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2003 the council has comprised 34 councillors, representing 16 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

The district is broadly coterminous to the Bosworth parliamentary constituency, which is represented by Luke Evans (Conservative). The Groby ward is the only part of the district not in the Bosworth constituency, forming instead part of the Charnwood constituency.

===Premises===

The council is based at the Hinckley Hub on Rugby Road in Hinckley. The building was completed in 2013. Prior to 2013 the council was based at the Council Offices at Argents Mead, which had been built in 1968 for the old Hinckley Urban District Council.

==Geography==

There are a number of geographical features which shape the landscape of Hinckley &amp; Bosworth.

Two large neighbouring urban areas lie to the south of the borough: Hinckley and Burbage and Barwell and Earl Shilton. A narrow green wedge separates the two conurbations, which is increasingly being occupied by leisure facilities such as the Marston&#x27;s Stadium and a new leisure centre. To the east of the wedge lies Burbage Common and Woods, a large popular green recreational area.

The west of the borough is largely flat in nature, dominated by the River Sence flood plain. This area of the borough is largely rural, consisting of a number of very small villages and hamlets.

At the northern and eastern edges of the borough lie several settlements (including Bagworth, Desford, Groby, Markfield, Ratby and Thornton) which largely relate to Leicester; in particular the most northern villages have little to do with the main administrative centre of Hinckley. The northern area of the borough also forms part of Charnwood Forest.

===Places of interest===

* The Geographical Centre of England is in the northwest of the borough at Lindley Hall Farm, near Fenny Drayton
* Burbage Common and Woods is one of the largest recreation areas in the borough consisting of 80 hectares of fields, meadows and woodland
* Hinckley Museum is in a range of 17th century timber-framed framework knitters&#x27; cottages.
* The Ashby Canal, the longest contour canal in England, passes through the borough from Hinckley in the south of the borough through Stoke Golding, Dadlington, Market Bosworth and Shackerstone before heading north to its current terminus at Snarestone.
* There is a large mill in Sheepy Magna to the west of the borough located on the River Sence
* Stoke Golding, is home to the medieval Church of St. Margaret&#x27;s.
* The site of the Battle of Bosworth, administered by Leicestershire County Council, includes an interpretation centre at Ambion Hill, where Richard III encamped the night before the battle. St. James&#x27;s Church at Dadlington is the place where many of the dead were buried and where a chantry was founded on their behalf.
* The Battlefield Line is a preserved railway which runs over part of the alignment of the former railway from Nuneaton to Ashby-de-la-Zouch. It is home to the Shackerstone Diesel Group.
* Twycross Zoo is notable for having the largest collection of primates in the world.
* Thornton Reservoir is a former drinking water reservoir that is no longer in use.
* A large collection of tropical birds is on display at Tropical Birdland near to Desford.

===Railways===
The only railway station in the borough on the National Rail network is Hinckley railway station on the South Leicestershire Line opened by the LNWR between 1862 and 1864. Currently there are direct services to Birmingham New Street and Leicester only with additional services to/from Cambridge and Stansted Airport in the peak.

There was also a branch line serving the market town of Market Bosworth which connected both Nuneaton and Hinckley to both Coalville and Ashby. The line closed to regular traffic in 1970 and is now part of the Battlefield Line. There was also a small stub to Hinckley but was never opened or used. There was also a stub to Nuneaton via Stoke Golding.

The last line that runs through part the borough is the Leicester to Burton Line which had a station in Desford, the station closed in 1964 but the line remains open for traffic. The station also served as a junction for the branch line to Leicester West Bridge on the now defunct Swannington and Leicester Railway. Although the section from Desford to Swannington remains open for freight traffic.

===Demography===
Hinckley and Bosworth is the second largest borough by population in Leicestershire and has seen significant population growth over recent decades; a trend forecast to continue at least into the short-medium term.

==Parishes==
Most of the borough is covered by civil parishes. The pre-1974 Hinckley Urban District became an unparished area on the borough&#x27;s creation in 1974, but four new parishes have since been created from parts of that area: Burbage, Stoke Golding (both created 1986), Earl Shilton (1995) and Barwell (2007), leaving just the central part of Hinckley itself as unparished. The parish council for Earl Shilton has declared its parish to be a town, allowing it to take the style &quot;town council&quot;. (Whilst often referred to as a town, Market Bosworth Parish Council has not formally declared that parish to be a town.)

<text>The Swiss Grand Prix (, , ), was the premier auto race of Switzerland. In its later years it was a Formula One race.

==History==

===Bremgarten (1934–1939, 1947–1954)===
Grand Prix motor racing came to Switzerland in 1934, to the Bremgarten circuit, located just outside the town of Bremgarten, near the Swiss &quot;de facto&quot; capital of Bern. The Bremgarten circuit was the dominant circuit on the Swiss racing scene; it was a fast stretch made up of public roads that went through stunning countryside and forests, sweeping from corner to corner without any real length of straight. From the outset, Bremgarten&#x27;s tree-lined roads, often poor light conditions, and changes in road surface made for what was acknowledged to be a very dangerous circuit, especially in the wet- even after it stopped raining and the sun came out, the trees covering the circuit were still soaking wet, and water would drip onto the tarmac for at least an hour. Conditions at this circuit were similar to that of the Nürburgring in West Germany- and this circuit was as highly popular with drivers as the Nürburgring was.

The first Swiss Grand Prix was a non-championship race; it was won by Hans Stuck in an Auto Union; British driver Hugh Hamilton died in a horrific accident in his Maserati. The car&#x27;s left front wheel broke at the very fast Wohlenstrasse corner, and Hamilton then lost control and then the whole car violently hit a tree, and continued going for about 70 feet before it hit and was stopped by a bigger tree, shattering the car and killing Hamilton (who had not been thrown from the car) instantly. Despite this occurrence (there was hardly any, if any, thought put into safety in those days), the Swiss Grand Prix counted toward the European Championship from 1935 to 1939, during which time it was dominated by the German Silver Arrows.

Grand Prix racing returned after World War II, and the Bremgarten track remained the home of the Swiss Grand Prix. The first post-war race was won by Frenchman Jean-Pierre Wimille, and in 1948 it was designated the European Grand Prix, in a time when this title was an honorary designation given each year to one Grand Prix race in Europe. This event, which was perhaps the blackest and most tragic Grand Prix of the 1940s saw multiple fatalities and serious injuries from massive accidents all around the circuit throughout the weekend. Veteran Italian racer and pre-WWII legend Achille Varzi would die during a rain-soaked practice session in an Alfa Romeo- helmets were not compulsory in those days, and Varzi, whose Alfa had overturned during the accident, was crushed by the 700kg Alfetta, which was more than 10 times his weight (Varzi was not wearing a helmet, and cars did not have roll-over protection in those days). The race also saw Swiss Christian Kautz die in a Maserati after going off the road and crashing into an embankment at the second Eymatt corner; the race was won by Carlo Felice Trossi. Frenchman Maurice Trintignant was nearly killed in another accident after crashing and being thrown out of his car and landing unconscious on the track. Three drivers including Nino Farina went off and crashed while trying to avoid the motionless Frenchman, who survived after multiple serious injuries and spending 8 days in a coma.

1950 saw the Swiss Grand Prix being inducted as part of the new Formula One World Championship (although at the time, all the races were run in Europe except the Indianapolis 500, but this race was not run to F1 regulations). This race was won by Italian Nino Farina, who would go on to be the first Formula One world champion. 1951 saw Argentine Juan Manuel Fangio dominate in his Alfa after taking advantage of Farina&#x27;s wrong decision not to make a pit stop to change tyres during changing wet-to-dry conditions. 1952 saw Briton up-and-comer Stirling Moss run as high as third in his underfunded Alta-powered HWM, and Italian Piero Taruffi scored his first and only F1 victory; it was also the only championship race (other than the Indianapolis 500) not won that year by his Ferrari teammate and countryman Alberto Ascari. Pre-war great and three-time Swiss GP winner Rudolf Caracciola was competing in a support sportscar race and crashed into a tree, and the violent accident that ensued ended up breaking one of his legs, which effectively ended his long racing career. 1953 saw Ascari battling back after a pit stop to fix the misfiring engine in his Ferrari; he came back out in fourth and stormed round the circuit, passed Fangio in a Maserati, his teammates Farina and Mike Hawthorn to take victory. Ascari also won his second Drivers&#x27; Championship at that event. 1954 saw Fangio (now driving a Mercedes) lead from start to finish in rainy weather and he took his second Drivers&#x27; Championship from countryman José Froilán González.

In 1955, however, the Swiss Grand Prix at Bremgarten was to be no more. After the Le Mans disaster in France that year which killed more than 80 people, the Swiss government declared circuit motor racing to be an unsafe sport and it was promptly banned; this forced the organizers to cancel the Grand Prix that year. Bremgarten was ultimately abandoned and was never used again for motor racing.

===Dijon-Prenois, France (1975, 1982)===

The Swiss Grand Prix returned in 1975 as a non-Championship Grand Prix just across the border, at the Dijon-Prenois circuit, France. Swiss Clay Regazzoni won the race. The Swiss Grand Prix only ran once more, when it returned to the Formula One World Championship in . The 1982 race, also held at Dijon, was organized by the Swiss Auto Club and was the first F1 win by Finland&#x27;s Keke Rosberg, driving for Williams, in what proved to be his Championship-winning season. Rosberg displayed a spirited drive in which he passed several cars, and was held up for some time by backmarker Andrea de Cesaris, then caught and passed polesitter Alain Prost. Although both the 1975 and 1982 races were held on French soil, the Dijon circuit was near the French-Swiss border, with both races organized by the Swiss Automobile Club.

===Legislation===

On 6 June 2007, the National Council voted to lift the ban of circuit racing in Switzerland, 97 in favor and 77 opposed. However, the legislation was subsequently not ratified by the Council of States. In 2015 the Swiss government allowed a relaxation of the law, permitting head-to-head racing events to be held in Switzerland for electric vehicles only. As a result, on 10 June 2018, Switzerland hosted its first motor race in 64 years when the first Zürich ePrix was held as a round of the all-electric Formula E championship.
