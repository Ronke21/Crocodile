<text>Hydraulic mining is a form of mining that uses high-pressure jets of water to dislodge rock material or move sediment. In the placer mining of gold or tin, the resulting water-sediment slurry is directed through sluice boxes to remove the gold. It is also used in mining kaolin and coal.

Hydraulic mining developed from ancient Roman techniques that used water to excavate soft underground deposits. Its modern form, using pressurized water jets produced by a nozzle called a &quot;monitor&quot;, came about in the 1850s during the California Gold Rush in the United States. Though successful in extracting gold-rich minerals, the widespread use of the process resulted in extensive environmental damage, such as increased flooding and erosion, and sediment blocking waterways and covering farm fields. These problems led to its legal regulation. Hydraulic mining has been used in various forms around the world.

==History==

===Ground Sluicing===
Hydraulic mining had its precursor in the practice of ground sluicing, a development of which is also known as &quot;hushing&quot;, in which surface streams of water were diverted so as to erode gold-bearing gravels. This technique was developed in the first centuries BC and AD by Roman miners to erode away alluvium. The Romans used ground sluicing to remove overburden and the gold-bearing debris in Las Médulas of Spain, and Dolaucothi in Great Britain. The method was also used in Elizabethan England and Wales (and rarely, Scotland) for developing lead, tin and copper mines.

Water was used on a large scale by Roman engineers in the first centuries BC and AD when the Roman Empire was expanding rapidly in Europe. Using a process later known as hushing, the Romans stored a large volume of water in a reservoir immediately above the area to be mined; the water was then quickly released. The resulting wave of water removed overburden and exposed bedrock. Gold veins in the bedrock were then worked using a number of techniques, and water power was used again to remove debris. The remains at Las Médulas and in surrounding areas show badland scenery on a gigantic scale owing to hydraulicking of the rich alluvial gold deposits. 

Las Médulas is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The site shows the remains of at least seven large aqueducts of up to in length feeding large supplies of water into the site. The gold-mining operations were described in vivid terms by Pliny the Elder in his &quot;Natural History&quot; published in the first century AD. Pliny was a procurator in Hispania Terraconensis in the 70s AD and witnessed the operations himself. The use of hushing has been confirmed by field survey and archaeology at Dolaucothi in South Wales, the only known Roman gold mine in Great Britain.

===California Gold Rush===

The modern form of hydraulic mining, using jets of water directed under very high pressure through hoses and nozzles at gold-bearing upland paleogravels, was first used by Edward Matteson near Nevada City, California in 1853 during the California Gold Rush. Matteson used canvas hose which was later replaced with crinoline hose by the 1860s. In California, hydraulic mining often brought water from higher locations for long distances to holding ponds several hundred feet above the area to be mined. California hydraulic mining exploited gravel deposits, making it a form of placer mining.

Early placer miners in California discovered that the more gravel they could process, the more gold they were likely to find. Instead of working with pans, sluice boxes, long toms, and rockers, miners collaborated to find ways to process larger quantities of gravel more rapidly. Hydraulic mining became the largest-scale, and most devastating, form of placer mining. Water was redirected into an ever-narrowing channel, through a large canvas hose, and out through a giant iron nozzle, called a &quot;monitor&quot;. The extremely high pressure stream was used to wash entire hillsides through enormous sluices.

By the early 1860s, while hydraulic mining was at its height, small-scale placer mining had largely exhausted the rich surface placers, and the mining industry turned to hard rock (called quartz mining in California) or hydraulic mining, which required larger organizations and much more capital. By the mid-1880s, it is estimated that 11 million ounces of gold (worth approximately US$7.5 billion at mid-2006 prices) had been recovered by hydraulic mining

====Environmental impacts====

While generating millions of dollars in tax revenues for the state and supporting a large population of miners in the mountains, hydraulic mining had a devastating effect on riparian natural environment and agricultural systems in California. Millions of tons of earth and water were delivered to mountain streams that fed rivers flowing into the Sacramento Valley. Once the rivers reached the relatively flat valley, the water slowed, the rivers widened, and the sediment was deposited in the floodplains and river beds causing them to rise, shift to new channels, and overflow their banks, causing major flooding, especially during the spring melt.

Cities and towns in the Sacramento Valley experienced an increasing number of devastating floods, while the rising riverbeds made navigation on the rivers increasingly difficult. Perhaps no other city experienced the boon and the bane of gold mining as much as Marysville. Situated at the confluence of the Yuba and Feather rivers, Marysville was the final &quot;jumping off&quot; point for miners heading to the northern foothills to seek their fortune. Steamboats from San Francisco, carrying miners and supplies, navigated up the Sacramento River, then the Feather River to Marysville where they would unload their passengers and cargo. 

Marysville eventually constructed a complex levee system to protect the city from floods and sediment. Hydraulic mining greatly exacerbated the problem of flooding in Marysville and shoaled the waters of the Feather River so severely that few steamboats could navigate from Sacramento to the Marysville docks. The sediment left by such efforts were reprocessed by mining dredges at the Yuba Goldfields, located near Marysville.
The spectacular eroded landscape left at the site of hydraulic mining can be viewed at Malakoff Diggins State Historic Park in Nevada County, California.

The San Francisco Bay became an outlet for polluting byproducts during the Gold Rush. Hydraulic mining left a trail of toxic waste, called &quot;slickens,&quot; that flowed from mine sites in the Sierras through the Sacramento River and into the San Francisco Bay. The slickens would contain harmful metals such as mercury. During this period, the industrial mining industry released 1.5 billion yards of toxic slickens into the Sacramento River. As the slickens traveled through California&#x27;s water arteries, it deposited its toxins into local ecosystems and waterways.

Nearby farmland became contaminated, which led to political pushback against the use of hydraulic mining. The slickens flowed through the Sacramento River before depositing itself into the San Francisco Bay. Currently, the San Francisco Bay remains dangerously contaminated with mercury. Estimates suggest that it will be another century before the Bay naturally removes the mercury from its system.

====Legal action landmark case====
Vast areas of farmland in the Sacramento Valley were deeply buried by the mining sediment. Frequently devastated by flood waters, farmers demanded an end to hydraulic mining. In the most renowned legal fight of farmers against miners, the farmers sued the hydraulic mining operations and the landmark case of &quot;Woodruff v. North Bloomfield Mining and Gravel Company&quot; made its way to the United States District Court in San Francisco where Judge Lorenzo Sawyer decided in favor of the farmers and limited hydraulic mining on January 7, 1884, declaring that hydraulic mining was &quot;a public and private nuisance&quot; and enjoining its operation in areas tributary to navigable streams and rivers. 

Hydraulic mining on a much smaller scale was recommenced after 1893 when the United States Congress passed the Camminetti Act which allowed licensed mining operations if sediment retention structures were constructed. This led to a number of operations above sediment catching brush dams and log crib dams. Most of the water-delivery hydraulic mining infrastructure had been destroyed by an 1891 flood, so this later stage of mining was carried on at a much smaller scale in California.

===Beyond California===

Although often associated with California due to its adoption and widespread use there, the technology was exported widely, to Oregon (Jacksonville in 1856), Colorado (Clear Creek, Central City and Breckenridge in 1860), Montana (Bannack in 1865), Arizona (Lynx Creek in 1868), Idaho (Idaho City in 1863), South Dakota (Deadwood in 1876), Alaska (Fairbanks in 1920), British Columbia (Canada), and overseas. It was used extensively in Dahlonega, Georgia and continues to be used in developing nations, often with devastating environmental consequences. The devastation caused by this method of mining caused Edwin Carter, the &quot;Log Cabin Naturalist&quot;, to switch from mining to collecting wildlife specimens from 1875–1900 in Breckenridge, Colorado, US.

Hydraulic mining was used during the Australian gold rushes where it was called hydraulic sluicing. One notable location was at the Oriental Claims near Omeo in Victoria where it was used between the 1850s and early 1900s, with abundant evidence of the damage still being visible today.

Hydraulic mining was used extensively in the Central Otago gold rush that took place in the 1860s in the South Island of New Zealand, where it was also known as &quot;sluicing&quot;.

Starting in the 1870s, hydraulic mining became a mainstay of alluvial tin mining on the Malay Peninsula.
Hydraulicking was formerly used in Polk County, Florida to mine phosphate rock.

==Contemporary usage==

In addition to its use in true mining, hydraulic mining can be used as an excavation technique, principally to demolish hills. For example, the Denny Regrade in Seattle was largely accomplished by hydraulic mining.

Hydraulic mining is the principal way that kaolinite clay is mined in Cornwall and Devon, in South-West England.

Egypt used hydraulic mining methods to breach the Bar Lev Line sand wall at the Suez Canal, in Operation Badr (1973) which opened the Yom Kippur War.

===Rand gold fields===
On the South African Rand gold fields, a gold surface tailings re-treatment facility called East Rand Gold and Uranium Company (ERGO) has been in operation since 1977. The facility uses hydraulic monitors to create slurry from older (and consequently richer) tailings sites and pumps it long distances to a concentration plant.

The facility processes nearly two million tons of tailings each month at a processing cost of below US$3.00/t (2013). Gold is recovered at a rate of only 0.20 g/t, but the low yield is compensated for by the extremely low cost of processing, with no risky or expensive mining or milling required for recovery.

The resulting slimes are pumped further away from the built-up areas permitting the economic development of land close to commercially valuable areas and previously covered by the tailings. The historic yellow-coloured mine dumps around Johannesburg are now almost a rarity, seen only in older photographs.

Uranium and pyrite (for sulfuric acid production) are also available for recovery from the process stream as co-products under suitable economic conditions.

==Underground hydraulic mining==
High-pressure water jets have also been used in the underground mining of coal, to break up the coal seam and wash the resulting coal slurry toward a collection point. The high-pressure water nozzle is referred to as the &#x27;hydro monitor&#x27;.

<text>Lee Boyd Malvo (born February 18, 1985), also known as John Lee Malvo, is a Jamaican convicted mass murderer who, along with John Allen Muhammad, committed a series of murders dubbed the D.C. sniper attacks over a three-week period in October 2002. Malvo was aged 17 during the span of the shootings. He is serving multiple life sentences at Keen Mountain Correctional Center in Virginia, a maximum security (level 4) prison.

The D.C. sniper attacks were the last in a series of shootings across the United States connected to Muhammad and Malvo which began on the West Coast. Muhammad had befriended the juvenile Malvo and enlisted him in the attacks. According to Craig Cooley, one of Malvo&#x27;s defense attorneys, Malvo believed Muhammad when he told him that the $10 million ransom sought from the U.S. government to stop the sniper killings would be used to establish a Utopian society for 140 homeless Black children on a Canadian compound. In 2012, Malvo claimed that Muhammad had sexually abused him.

==Early life==
Lee Boyd Malvo was born on February 18, 1985, to Leslie Malvo, a mason, and Una James, a seamstress. The couple, who never married, lived in Kingston, Jamaica. Una left Leslie in 1990, when Lee Malvo was five years old. Una and Lee moved to the hill town of Endeavour, Jamaica, to be with her sister Marie Lawrence for almost a year.

They moved back to Kingston, and later to St. Martin. When Malvo was nine years old he was sent to live with his aunt Marie, where he stayed for almost a year. On passing his sixth grade exams, Lee was sent to York Castle High School.

Jamaican pastor Lorenzo King baptized Malvo into the Seventh-day Adventist Church at 14 years of age in 1999. Malvo later moved to Antigua in 1999 to be with his mother. He registered at Antigua and Barbuda Seventh-day Adventist School, where he got good grades and also won a school award in the 100 meter run.

== Joining John Allen Muhammad ==
Malvo and his mother, Una Sceon James, first met John Allen Muhammad in Antigua and Barbuda around 1999, where she and Muhammad developed a strong friendship. Later, Una left Antigua for Fort Myers, Florida, using false documents. She left her son with Muhammad, reportedly planning to have him follow her later. Malvo was converted to Islam by Muhammad in March 2001. Muhammad also isolated Malvo from his mother.

Malvo arrived illegally in Miami in 2001, and in December of that year, he and his mother were apprehended by the Border Patrol in Bellingham, Washington. In January 2002, Malvo was released on a $1,500 bond. Malvo subsequently lived in a homeless shelter with Muhammad in Bellingham. Malvo enrolled in Bellingham High School with Muhammad falsely listed as his father. He did not make any friends, according to his classmates.

While in the Tacoma, Washington, area, according to his statements to investigators, Malvo shoplifted a Bushmaster XM-15 from Bull&#x27;s Eye Shooter Supply and practiced his marksmanship on the Bull&#x27;s Eye firing range adjacent to the gun shop. Under federal laws, neither Muhammad nor Malvo were legally allowed to purchase or possess guns, with both classified as prohibited persons under the Gun Control Act of 1968.

==Criminal history ==
Malvo was initially arrested under federal charges, but they were dropped. He was transferred to Virginian custody and sent to jail in Fairfax County. He was charged by the Commonwealth of Virginia for two capital crimes: the murder of FBI analyst Linda Franklin &quot;in the commission of an act of terrorism&quot; (the phrase being added to Virginian law after the September 11 attacks) and the murder of more than one person in a three-year period.

He was also charged with the unlawful use of a firearm in the murder of Franklin. Initially, a Fairfax attorney, Michael Arif, was appointed to represent him, along with Thomas B. Walsh and Mark J. Petrovich. Later, prominent Richmond attorney Craig Cooley was appointed to the team and assumed a leadership role. While in jail, Malvo made a recorded confession to Detective Samuel Walker in which he stated that he &quot;intended to kill them all&quot;.

Due to extensive pre-trial publicity around the entire Washington metropolitan area, a change of venue was granted. The trial was moved more than 150 miles to Chesapeake, Virginia. Malvo pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to all charges on the grounds that he was under Muhammad&#x27;s complete control. One of Malvo&#x27;s psychiatric witnesses testified that Muhammad, a member of Nation of Islam, had indoctrinated Malvo into believing that the proceeds of an extortion attempt would be used to begin a new nation of only pure black young persons somewhere in Canada.

During the trial, Cooley said that violent video games had contributed significantly to Malvo&#x27;s state of mind and his willingness to commit murder. Cooley said, &quot;He&#x27;s trained and desensitized with video games, computer games, to train him to shoot human forms over and over.&quot; Sociologists Lawrence Kutner and Cheryl K. Olson, however, argue in their book &quot;Grand Theft Childhood&quot; that other factors were much more significant. &quot;In court, Lee Malvo admitted that he trained by shooting a real gun at paper plates that represented human heads. Also, Malvo had a long history of antisocial and criminal behavior, including torturing small animals, one of the best predictors of future violent criminal behavior.&quot;

On December 18, 2003, after nearly 14 hours of deliberation, a jury convicted Malvo of both charges. On December 23, the jury recommended a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. On March 10, 2004, Malvo was sentenced to life in prison without parole. However, the life sentence was overturned in 2016 when Virginia abolished life without parole for juveniles.

On October 26, 2004, under a plea bargain to avoid a possible death penalty, Malvo entered an Alford plea to the charges of murdering Kenneth Bridges and attempting to murder Caroline Seawell while Malvo was in Spotsylvania County, Virginia. He also pleaded guilty to two firearms charges and agreed not to appeal his conviction for the murder of Franklin. He was sentenced to life in prison without parole for murder, plus eight years imprisonment for the weapons charges.

One Virginia prosecutor in Prince William County had stated he would wait to decide whether to try Malvo on additional capital charges in his jurisdiction until the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on whether juveniles may be subject to execution. In light of the March 1, 2005, Supreme Court decision in &quot;Roper v. Simmons&quot; that the Eighth Amendment prohibits execution for crimes committed when under age 18, the prosecutors in Prince William County decided not to pursue the charges against Malvo. As Malvo was 17 when he committed the crimes, he cannot face the death penalty, but still may be extradited to Alabama, Louisiana, and other states for prosecution. At the outset of the Beltway sniper prosecutions, the primary reason for extraditing the two suspects from Maryland, where they were arrested, to Virginia was the differences in how the two states deal with the death penalty. While the death penalty was allowed in Maryland, it applied only to persons who were adults at the time of their crimes, whereas Virginia had also allowed the death penalty for offenders who had been juveniles when their crimes were committed. A death sentence was more likely to result in execution in Virginia than in Maryland, which abolished its death penalty in 2013. 

In May 2005, Virginia and Maryland reached an agreement to allow Maryland to begin prosecuting some of the pending charges there, and Malvo was extradited to Montgomery County, Maryland, under heavy security.

On June 16, 2006, Malvo told authorities that he and Muhammad were guilty of four additional shootings in 2002: A man killed in Los Angeles, California, during a robbery in February or March; a 76-year-old man who survived a shooting on May 18 at a golf course in Clearwater, Florida; a man shot to death while doing yard work in Denton, Texas, May 27; and 54 year-old John Gaeta, who survived being shot on August 1 during a robbery outside a shopping mall near Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

On October 10, 2006, Malvo pleaded guilty to the six murders he was charged with in Maryland. On October 26, he told police that he and Muhammad had killed Jerry Taylor, 60, as Taylor practiced chip shots at a Tucson, Arizona, golf course in March 2002. Tucson detectives interviewed Malvo about Taylor, who died from a single gunshot fired at long range but did not disclose their findings.

On November 8, Malvo was sentenced to six consecutive life sentences without possibility of parole.

== Civil lawsuit ==
In 2003, Malvo and Muhammad were named in a major civil lawsuit by the Legal Action Project of the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence on behalf of two of their victims who were seriously wounded and the families of some of those murdered. Co-defendants Bull&#x27;s Eye Shooter Supply and Bushmaster Firearms contributed to a landmark $2.5 million out-of-court settlement in late 2004.

== 2006 account ==

In Muhammad&#x27;s May 2006 trial in Montgomery County, Maryland, Malvo took the stand and confessed to a more detailed version of the pair&#x27;s plans. Malvo, after extensive counseling, admitted that he had been lying in the statement he made after his arrest when he admitted to being the triggerman for every shooting. Malvo claimed that he had said this to protect Muhammad from the death penalty because it would have been more difficult (and since declared unconstitutional) to impose the death penalty for murders committed by a minor. Malvo stated, &quot;I&#x27;m not proud of myself. I&#x27;m just trying to make amends&quot;, expressing his regret in the shootings. In his two days of testimony, Malvo outlined detailed aspects of all the shootings.

Part of his testimony concerned Muhammad&#x27;s complete plan, which consisted of three phases in the Washington, D.C. and Baltimore metro areas. Phase One consisted of meticulously planning, mapping and practicing their locations around the D.C. area so that after each shooting they could quickly leave the area on a predetermined path and move to the next location. Muhammad&#x27;s goal in Phase One was to kill six white people a day for 30 days. Malvo went on to describe how Phase One did not go as planned due to heavy traffic and the lack of a clear shot and/or getaway at different locations.

Phase Two was meant to take place in Baltimore. Malvo described how this phase was close to being implemented but was never carried out. Phase Two was intended to begin by killing a pregnant woman by shooting her in the abdomen. The next step would have been to shoot and kill a Baltimore police officer. At the officer&#x27;s funeral, they would plant several improvised explosive devices. These explosives were intended to kill a large number of police since many police would attend another officer&#x27;s funeral. More bombs were then to be detonated as ambulances arrived at the scene.

The last phase was to take place immediately after Phase Two: to extort several million dollars from the U.S. government. This money would be used to finance a larger plan to travel north into Canada and recruit other effectively orphaned boys to use weapons and stealth and send them out to commit shootings across the country.

== Post-sentencing ==
Until mid 2024, Malvo was incarcerated at the Red Onion State Prison as Virginia Department of Corrections inmate 1180834. Malvo was relocated from the supermax Red Onion State Prison to the slightly lower security Keen Mountain Correctional Center around June 2024. 

* On October 2, 2007, Malvo called Cheryll Witz, a daughter of one of the victims to apologize for his actions.
* Malvo sent a letter, dated February 21, 2010, to apologize to John C. Gaeta for shooting him. Malvo wrote: &quot;I am truly sorry for the pain I caused you and your loved ones. I was relieved to hear that you suffered no paralyzing injuries and that you are alive.&quot;

* A Wise County, Virginia, Circuit Judge denied Malvo&#x27;s request to change his name on July 29, 2011. Malvo petitioned the court for the name change on the basis that he would be safer if his fellow inmates did not know his real name, due to his notoriety.
* In September 2012, Malvo gave a lengthy interview to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. In this interview, Malvo, then 27, stated that &quot;I was a monster. If you look up the definition, that&#x27;s what a monster is. I was a ghoul. I was a thief. I stole people&#x27;s lives. I did someone else&#x27;s bidding just because they said so. There is no rhyme or reason or sense.&quot; In an interview with Matt Lauer on October 24, 2012, Malvo said that John Muhammad sexually abused him.
* On May 26, 2017, a federal district court judge in Virginia overturned Malvo&#x27;s sentences of life without parole on the grounds that it was unconstitutional under &quot;Miller v. Alabama&quot; because Malvo was 17 years old at the time of the killings. However, on August 16, 2017, Montgomery County, Maryland Circuit Court Judge Robert Greenberg decided that the Virginia federal court ruling did not apply to the Maryland cases since the sentences were not mandatory in the state of Maryland. Greenberg wrote, &quot;The six consecutive life-without-parole sentences were imposed after a full consideration of Defendant&#x27;s physical, mental, and emotional state&quot;. He went on to state that the judge who imposed the original sentence &quot;considered all relevant factors at play and the plain import of his words at the time was that Defendant is &#x27;irreparably corrupted.&#x27;&quot;
* On June 21, 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit unanimously upheld a lower court&#x27;s decision that Malvo&#x27;s sentences of life without parole were unconstitutional. Judge Paul V. Niemeyer wrote in the decision that &quot;Malvo was 17 years old when he committed the murders, and he now has the retroactive benefit of new constitutional rules that treat juveniles differently for sentencing.&quot; A spokesperson for Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring stated the office is considering asking for a full 4th Circuit rehearing, or appealing to the Supreme Court of the United States to hear the case.
* On June 29, 2018, Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring said in a statement that his office was seeking to have the Supreme Court of the United States review the case. On March 18, 2019, the Supreme Court granted certiorari, and heard the case on October 16, 2019.
* On February 24, 2020, Malvo asked the Supreme Court to dismiss his appeal as moot, after a change in Virginia state law that made him eligible for parole in that state. The law change made any person sentenced to life as a juvenile and who has served 20 years in prison eligible to be considered for early release. Malvo became eligible for parole consideration in Virginia in 2022. His life sentences in Maryland are not affected, but he is now trying to appeal those sentences as well.
* On March 10, 2020, Malvo&#x27;s adviser Carmeta Albarus announced Malvo was married in a ceremony held at Red Onion State Prison.
* In April 2021, Maryland banned life sentences for juveniles, Malvo sued for relief and the Maryland Court of Appeals agreed to review. Oral arguments began in February 2022. 
* On August 26, 2022, the Maryland Court of Appeals ordered a resentencing for Malvo in order to comply with the Supreme Court.
* On August 30, 2022, Malvo was denied parole by the Virginia parole board.
*On March 13, 2024, Maryland judge considered how and when the transfer of Malvo for new sentence takes place.

<doc id="353854" wikidata="Q234519" url="?curid=353854" title="Angela Carter">
<text>Angela Olive Pearce (formerly Carter, Stalker; 7 May 1940 – 16 February 1992), who published under the name Angela Carter, was an English novelist, short story writer, poet, and journalist, known for her feminist, magical realism, and picaresque works. She is mainly known for her book &quot;The Bloody Chamber&quot; (1979). In 1984, her short story &quot;The Company of Wolves&quot; was adapted into a film of the same name. In 2008, &quot;The Times&quot; ranked Carter tenth in their list of &quot;The 50 greatest British writers since 1945&quot;. In 2012, &quot;Nights at the Circus&quot; was selected as the best ever winner of the James Tait Black Memorial Prize.

==Biography==
Born Angela Olive Stalker in Eastbourne, in 1940, to Sophia Olive (née Farthing; 1905–1969), a cashier at Selfridge&#x27;s, and journalist Hugh Alexander Stalker (1896–1988), Carter was evacuated as a child to live in Yorkshire with her maternal grandmother. After attending Streatham and Clapham High School, in south London, she began work as a journalist on &quot;The Croydon Advertiser&quot;, following in her father&#x27;s footsteps. Carter attended the University of Bristol where she studied English literature.

She married twice, first in 1960 to Paul Carter, ultimately divorcing in 1972. In 1969, she used the proceeds of her Somerset Maugham Award to leave her husband and relocate for two years to Tokyo, where, she claims in &quot;Nothing Sacred&quot; (1982), that she &quot;learnt what it is to be a woman and became radicalised&quot;. She wrote about her experiences there in articles for &quot;New Society&quot; and in a collection of short stories, &quot;&quot; (1974). Evidence of her experiences in Japan can also be seen in &quot;The Infernal Desire Machines of Doctor Hoffman&quot; (1972).

She then explored the United States, Asia, and Europe, helped by her fluency in French and German. She spent much of the late 1970s and 1980s as a writer-in-residence at universities, including the University of Sheffield, Brown University, the University of Adelaide, and the University of East Anglia. In 1977, Carter met Mark Pearce, with whom she had one son and whom she eventually married shortly before her death in 1992. In 1979, both &quot;The Bloody Chamber&quot;, and her feminist essay &quot;The Sadeian Woman and the Ideology of Pornography&quot; were published. In &quot;The Bloody Chamber&quot;, she rewrote traditional fairy tales so as to subvert their essentializing tendencies. In her 1985 interview with Helen Cagney, Carter said, “So, I suppose that what interests me is the way these fairy tales and folklore are methods of making sense of events and certain occurrences in a particular way.” Sarah Gamble, therefore, argued that Carter’s book is a manifestation of her materialism, that is, “her desire to bring fairy tale back down to earth in order to demonstrate how it could be used to explore the real conditions of everyday life&quot;. In &quot;The Sadeian Woman&quot;, according to the writer Marina Warner, Carter &quot;deconstructs the arguments that underlie &quot;The Bloody Chamber&quot;. It&#x27;s about desire and its destruction, the self-immolation of women, how women collude and connive with their condition of enslavement. She was much more independent-minded than the traditional feminist of her time.&quot;

As well as being a prolific writer of fiction, Carter contributed many articles to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Independent&quot; and &quot;New Statesman&quot;, collected in &quot;Shaking a Leg&quot;. She adapted a number of her short stories for radio and wrote two original radio dramas on Richard Dadd and Ronald Firbank. Two of her works of fiction have been adapted for film: &quot;The Company of Wolves&quot; (1984) and &quot;The Magic Toyshop&quot; (1967). She was actively involved in both adaptations; her screenplays were subsequently published in &quot;The Curious Room&quot;, a collection of her dramatic writings, including radio scripts and a libretto for an opera based on Virginia Woolf&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. Carter&#x27;s novel &quot;Nights at the Circus&quot; won the 1984 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for literature. Her 1991 novel &quot;Wise Children&quot; offers a surreal ride through British theatre and music hall traditions.

Carter died aged 51 in 1992 at her home in London after developing lung cancer. At the time of her death, she had started work on a sequel to Charlotte Brontë&#x27;s &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; based on the later life of Jane&#x27;s stepdaughter, Adèle Varens; only a synopsis survives.

<text>Confidentiality involves a set of rules or a promise usually executed through confidentiality agreements that limits the access to or places restrictions on the distribution of certain types of information.

==Legal confidentiality==
By law, lawyers are often required to keep confidential anything on the representation of a client. The duty of confidentiality is much broader than the attorney–client evidentiary privilege, which only covers &quot;communications&quot; between the attorney and the client.

Both the privilege and the duty serve the purpose of encouraging clients to speak frankly about their cases. This way, lawyers can carry out their duty to provide clients with zealous representation. Otherwise, the opposing side may be able to surprise the lawyer in court with something he did not know about his client, which may weaken the client&#x27;s position. Also, a distrustful client might hide a relevant fact he thinks is incriminating, but that a skilled lawyer could turn to the client&#x27;s advantage (for example, by raising affirmative defenses like self-defense). However, most jurisdictions have exceptions for situations where the lawyer has reason to believe that the client may kill or seriously injure someone, may cause substantial injury to the financial interest or property of another, or is using (or seeking to use) the lawyer&#x27;s services to perpetrate a crime or fraud. In such situations the lawyer has the discretion, but not the obligation, to disclose information designed to prevent the planned action. Most states have a version of this discretionary disclosure rule under Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 1.6 (or its equivalent). A few jurisdictions have made this traditionally discretionary duty mandatory. For example, see the New Jersey and Virginia Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 1.6.

In some jurisdictions, the lawyer must try to convince the client to conform his or her conduct to the boundaries of the law before disclosing any otherwise confidential information. These exceptions generally do not cover crimes that have already occurred, even in extreme cases where murderers have confessed the location of missing bodies to their lawyers but the police are still looking for those bodies. The U.S. Supreme Court and many state supreme courts have affirmed the right of a lawyer to withhold information in such situations. Otherwise, it would be impossible for any criminal defendant to obtain a zealous defense.

California is famous for having one of the strongest duties of confidentiality in the world; its lawyers must protect client confidences at &quot;every peril to himself [or herself]&quot; under former California Business and Professions Code section 6068(e). Until an amendment in 2004 (which turned subsection (e) into subsection (e)(1) and added subsection (e)(2) to section 6068), California lawyers were not even permitted to disclose that a client was about to commit murder or assault. The Supreme Court of California promptly amended the California Rules of Professional Conduct to conform to the new exception in the revised statute. Recent legislation in the UK curtails the confidentiality professionals like lawyers and accountants can maintain at the expense of the state. Accountants, for example, are required to disclose to the state any suspicions of fraudulent accounting and, even, the legitimate use of tax saving schemes if those schemes are not already known to the tax authorities.

===Breach of confidence in English law===
The &quot;three traditional requirements of the cause of action for breach of confidence&quot; were identified by Megarry J in &quot;Coco v A N Clark (Engineers) Ltd&quot; (1968) in the following terms:

The 1896 case featuring the royal &quot;accoucheur&quot; Dr William Smoult Playfair showed the difference between lay and medical views. Playfair was consulted by Linda Kitson; he ascertained that she had been pregnant while separated from her husband. He informed his wife, a relative of Kitson&#x27;s, in order that she protect herself and their daughters from moral contagion. Kitson sued, and the case gained public notoriety, with huge damages awarded against the doctor.

==Medical confidentiality==

Confidentiality is commonly applied to conversations between doctors and patients. Legal protections prevent physicians from revealing certain discussions with patients, even under oath in court. This physician-patient privilege only applies to secrets shared between physician and patient during the course of providing medical care.

The rule dates back to at least the Hippocratic Oath, which reads in part: &quot;Whatever, in connection with my professional service, or not in connection with it, I see or hear, in the life of men, which ought not to be spoken of abroad, I will not divulge, as reckoning that all such should be kept secret.&quot;

Traditionally, medical ethics has viewed the duty of confidentiality as a relatively non-negotiable tenet of medical practice.

===United States===
Confidentiality is standard in the United States by HIPAA laws, specifically the Privacy Rule, and various state laws, some more rigorous than HIPAA. However, numerous exceptions to the rules have been carved out over the years. For example, many American states require physicians to report gunshot wounds to the police and impaired drivers to the Department of Motor Vehicles. Confidentiality is also challenged in cases involving the diagnosis of a sexually transmitted disease in a patient who refuses to reveal the diagnosis to a spouse, and in the termination of a pregnancy in an underage patient, without the knowledge of the patient&#x27;s parents. Many states in the U.S. have laws governing parental notification in underage abortion. Confidentiality can be protected in medical research via certificates of confidentiality.

===European Union===

Due to the EU Directive 2001/20/EC, inspectors appointed by the Member States have to maintain confidentiality whenever they gain access to confidential information as a result of the good clinical practice inspections in accordance with applicable national and international requirements.

A typical patient declaration might read:
===HIV confidentiality===
In the United Kingdom information about an individual&#x27;s HIV status is kept confidential within the National Health Service. This is based in law, in the NHS Constitution, and in key NHS rules and procedures. It is also outlined in every NHS employee&#x27;s contract of employment and in professional standards set by regulatory bodies. The National AIDS Trust&#x27;s Confidentiality in the NHS: Your Information, Your Rights outlines these rights. All registered healthcare professionals must abide by these standards and if they are found to have breached confidentiality, they can face disciplinary action.

A healthcare worker shares confidential information with someone else who is, or is about to, provide the patient directly with healthcare to make sure they get the best possible treatment. They only share information that is relevant to their care in that instance, and with consent.

There are two ways to give consent: &quot;explicit consent&quot; or &quot;implied consent&quot;. Explicit consent is when a patient clearly communicates to a healthcare worker, verbally or in writing or in some other way, that relevant confidential information can be shared. Implied consent means that a patient&#x27;s consent to share personal confidential information is assumed. When personal confidential information is shared between healthcare workers, consent is taken as implied.

If a patient doesn&#x27;t want a healthcare worker to share confidential health information, they need to make this clear and discuss the matter with healthcare staff. Patients have the right, in most situations, to refuse permission for a health care professional to share their information with another healthcare professional, even one giving them care—but are advised, where appropriate, about the dangers of this course of action, due to possible drug interactions.

However, in a few limited instances, a healthcare worker can share personal information without consent if it is in the public interest. These instances are set out in guidance from the General Medical Council, which is the regulatory body for doctors. Sometimes the healthcare worker has to provide the information – if required by law or in response to a court order.

The National AIDS Trust has written a guide for people living with HIV to confidentiality in the NHS.
==Clinical and counseling psychology==
The ethical principle of confidentiality requires that information shared by a client with a therapist isn&#x27;t shared without consent, and that the sharing of information would be guided by ETHIC Model: Examining professional values, after thinking about ethical standards of the certifying association, hypothesize about different courses of action and possible consequences, identifying how it and to whom will it be beneficial per professional standards, and after consulting with supervisor and colleagues. Confidentiality principle bolsters the therapeutic alliance, as it promotes an environment of trust. There are important exceptions to confidentiality, namely where it conflicts with the clinician&#x27;s duty to warn or duty to protect. This includes instances of suicidal behavior or homicidal plans, child abuse, elder abuse and dependent adult abuse. Information shared by a client with a therapist is considered as privileged communication, however in certain cases and based on certain provinces and states they are negated, it is determined by the use of negative and positive freedom.

== Commercial confidentiality ==
Some legal jurisdictions recognise a category of commercial confidentiality whereby a business may withhold information on the basis of perceived harm to &quot;commercial interests&quot;. For example, Coca-Cola&#x27;s main syrup formula remains a trade secret.

== Banking confidentiality ==
== Public policy concerns ==
Confidentiality agreements that &quot;seal&quot; litigation settlements are not uncommon, but this can leave regulators and society ignorant of public hazards. In the U.S. state of Washington, for example, journalists discovered that about two dozen medical malpractice cases had been improperly sealed by judges, leading to improperly weak discipline by the state Department of Health. In the 1990s and early 2000s, the Catholic sexual abuse scandal involved a number of confidentiality agreements with victims. Some states have passed laws that limit confidentiality. For example, in 1990 Florida passed a &#x27;Sunshine in Litigation&#x27; law that limits confidentiality from concealing public hazards. Washington state, Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana have laws limiting confidentiality as well, although judicial interpretation has weakened the application of these types of laws. In the U.S. Congress, a similar federal Sunshine in Litigation Act has been proposed but not passed in 2009, 2011, 2014, and 2015.

<doc id="353861" wikidata="Q1262796" url="?curid=353861" title="Dub Syndicate">
<text>Dub Syndicate is a dub band, formed by Adrian Sherwood, which became a showcase for Adrian Sherwood&#x27;s collaboration with Lincoln &quot;Style&quot; Scott, former drummer with the Roots Radics, Suns of Arqa and Creation Rebel.

Dub Syndicate initially evolved out of Creation Rebel and had a classic dub sound until the third album, &quot;Tunes From The Missing Channel&quot; (1985), where Dub Syndicate gave birth to a more experimental, technological dub sound. Dub Syndicate&#x27;s new sound centered on the interaction of Scott, Sherwood, and members of Tackhead, Skip McDonald, Keith LeBlanc and Doug Wimbish.

Dub Syndicate has collaborated with many other artists including Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry, Bim Sherman (vocals), Keith Levene, Don Campbell (musician), Junior Reid, Big Youth, Felix &quot;Deadley Headley&quot; Bennett (saxophone), Prince Far I, Aswad and Burning Spear bassist George Oban, Alpha Boys&#x27; School-educated Eskimo Fox ( drummer), Noel Brownie, Alan Glen and Peter &quot;Dr. Pablo&quot; Stroud (melodica), (N.B. Dr. Pablo is not Augustus Pablo).

Most of the band&#x27;s output has appeared on On-U Sound Records, produced by the label&#x27;s owner Adrian Sherwood. More recent Dub Syndicate recordings were released on Style Scott&#x27;s own Lion &amp; Roots record label, and production duties were split between Sherwood, Scientist and Scott. More recently Dub Syndicate has worked with Dancehall artists such as Luciano, Capleton and Jr. Reid.

Scott was found dead in Jamaica on 11 October 2014.

<doc id="353862" wikidata="Q193650" url="?curid=353862" title="Alan Hodgkin">
<text>Sir Alan Lloyd Hodgkin (5 February 1914 – 20 December 1998) was an English physiologist and biophysicist who shared the 1963 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Andrew Huxley and John Eccles.

==Early life and education==

Hodgkin was born in Banbury, Oxfordshire, on 5 February 1914. He was the oldest of three sons of Quakers George Hodgkin and Mary Wilson Hodgkin. His father was the son of Thomas Hodgkin and had read for the Natural Science Tripos at Cambridge where he had befriended electrophysiologist Keith Lucas. 

Because of poor eyesight, he was unable to study medicine and eventually ended up working for a bank in Banbury. As members of the Society of Friends, George and Mary opposed the Military Service Act of 1916, which introduced conscription, and had to endure a great deal of abuse from their local community, including an attempt to throw George in one of the town canals. In 1916, George Hodgkin travelled to Armenia as part of an investigation of distress. Moved by the misery and suffering of Armenian refugees he attempted to go back there in 1918 on a route through the Persian Gulf (as the northern route was closed because of the October Revolution in Russia). He died of dysentery in Baghdad on 24 June 1918, just a few weeks after his youngest son, Keith, had been born.

From an early life on, Hodgkin and his brothers were encouraged to explore the country around their home, which instilled in Alan an interest in natural history, particularly ornithology. At the age of 15, he helped Wilfred Backhouse Alexander with surveys of heronries and later, at Gresham&#x27;s School, he overlapped and spent a lot of time with David Lack. In 1930, he was the winner of a bronze medal in the Public Schools Essay Competition organised by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.

===School and university===
Alan started his education at The Downs School where his contemporaries included future scientists Frederick Sanger, Alec Bangham, &quot;neither outstandingly brilliant at school&quot; according to Hodgkin, as well as future artists Lawrence Gowing and Kenneth Rowntree. After the Downs School, he went on to Gresham&#x27;s School where he overlapped with future composer Benjamin Britten as well as Maury Meiklejohn. He ended up receiving a scholarship at Trinity College, Cambridge in botany, zoology and chemistry.

Between school and college, he spent May 1932 at the Freshwater Biological Station at Wray Castle based on a recommendation of his future Director of Studies at Trinity, Carl Pantin. After Wray Castle, he spent two months with a German family in Frankfurt as &quot;in those days it was thought highly desirable that anyone intending to read science should have a reasonable knowledge of German.&quot; After his return to England in early August 1932, his mother Mary was remarried to Lionel Smith (1880–1972), the eldest son of A. L. Smith, whose daughter Dorothy was also married to Alan&#x27;s uncle Robert Howard Hodgkin.

In the autumn of 1932, Hodgkin started as a freshman scholar at Trinity College where his friends included classicists John Raven and Michael Grant, fellow-scientists Richard Synge and John H. Humphrey, as well as Polly and David Hill, the children of Nobel laureate Archibald Hill. He took physiology with chemistry and zoology for the first two years, including lectures by Nobel laureate E.D. Adrian. For Part II of the tripos he decided to focus on physiology instead of zoology. Nevertheless, he participated in a zoological expedition to the Atlas Mountains in Morocco led by John Pringle in 1934. He finished Part II of the tripos in July 1935 and stayed at Trinity as a research fellow.

During his studies, Hodgkin, who described himself as &quot;having been brought up as a supporter of the British Labour Party&quot; was friends with communists and actively participated in the distribution of anti-war pamphlets. At Cambridge, he knew James Klugmann and John Cornford, but he emphasised in his autobiography that none of his friends &quot;made any serious effort to convert me [to Communism], either then or later.&quot; From 1935 to 1937, Hodgkin was a member of the Cambridge Apostles.

== Pre-war research==

Hodgkin started conducting experiments on how electrical activity is transmitted in the sciatic nerve of frogs in July 1934. He found that a nerve impulse arriving at a cold or compression block, can decrease the electrical threshold beyond the block, suggesting that the impulse produces a spread of an electrotonic potential in the nerve beyond the block. In 1936, Hodgkin was invited by Herbert Gasser, then director of the Rockefeller Institute in New York City, to work in his laboratory during 1937–38. There he met Rafael Lorente de Nó and Kenneth Stewart Cole with whom he ended up publishing a paper. During that year he also spent time at the Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory where he was introduced to the squid giant axon, which ended up being the model system with which he conducted most of the research that eventually led to his Nobel Prize. 
In the spring of 1938, he visited Joseph Erlanger at Washington University in St. Louis who told him he would take Hodgkin&#x27;s local circuit theory of nerve impulse propagation seriously if he could show that altering the resistance of the fluid outside a nerve fibre made a difference to the velocity of nerve impulse conduction. Working with single nerve fibres from shore crabs and squids, he showed that the conduction rate was much faster in seawater than in oil, providing strong evidence for the local circuit theory.

After his return to Cambridge he started collaborating with Andrew Huxley who had entered Trinity as a freshman in 1935, three years after Hodgkin. With a £300 equipment grant from the Rockefeller Foundation, Hodgkin managed to set up a similar physiology setup to the one he had worked with at the Rockefeller Institute. He moved all his equipment to the Plymouth Marine Laboratory in July 1939. There, he and Huxley managed to insert a fine cannula into the giant axon of squids and record action potentials from inside the nerve fibre. They sent a short note of their success to &quot; Nature&quot; just before the outbreak of World War II.

==Wartime activities==
Despite his Quaker upbringing, Hodgkin was eager to join the war effort as contact with the Nazis during his stay in Germany in 1932 had removed all his pacifist beliefs. His first post was at the Royal Aircraft Establishment where he worked on issues in aviation medicine, such as oxygen supply for pilots at high altitudes and the decompression sickness caused by nitrogen bubbles coming out of the blood. In February 1940 he transferred to the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) where he worked on the development of centimetric radar, including the design of the village Inn AGLT airborne gun-laying system. He was a member of E.G. Bowen&#x27;s group in St Athan in South Wales and lived in a local guest house together with John Pringle and Robert Hanbury Brown. The group moved to Swanage in May 1940 where Pringle replaced Bowen as leader of the group. In March 1941, Hodgkin flew on the test flight of a Bristol Blenheim fitted with the first airborne centimetric radar system. In February and March 1944, he visited the MIT Radiation Laboratory to help foster the interchange of information on developments in radar between Britain and America.

Providing a readable account of the little-known piece of military history that he was a part of during World War II was a main motivation for Hodgkin to write his autobiography &quot;Chance and Design: Reminiscences of Science in Peace and War&quot;.

==1945–1963: Action potential theory and Nobel Prize==
As the Allied Forces&#x27; invasion of France and their continued advance towards Germany in autumn 1944 suggested an end of the war in the foreseeable future, Hodgkin started to plan his return to a career in research at Cambridge. He renewed his collaboration with W. A. H. Rushton and they published an article on how to calculate a nerve fibre&#x27;s membrane resistance, membrane capacity, its axoplasm&#x27;s resistance, and the resistance of the external fluid in which the fibre is placed, from experimental observations.

After being released from military service in August 1945 upon Adrian&#x27;s request, Hodgkin was able to restart his experiments in collaboration with Bernard Katz and his pre-war collaborator Andrew Huxley. They spent the summers of 1947, 1948, and 1949 at the Plymouth Marine Laboratory where they continued to measure resting and action potentials from inside the giant axon of the squid. Together with Katz, he provided evidence that the permeability of the neuronal cell membrane for sodium increased during an action potential, thus allowing sodium ions to diffuse inward. 
The data they had obtained in 1949 resulted in a series of five papers published in &quot;The Journal of Physiology&quot; that described what became later known as the Hodgkin–Huxley model of the action potential and eventually earned Hodgkin and Huxley the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Building on work by Kenneth S. Cole they used a technique of electrophysiology, known as the &quot;voltage clamp&quot; to measure ionic currents through the membranes of squid axons while holding the membrane voltage at a set level. They proposed that the characteristic shape of the action potential is caused by changes in the selective permeability of the membrane for different ions, specifically sodium, potassium, and chloride. A model that relies on a set of differential equations and describes each component of an excitable cell as an electrical element was in good agreement with their empirical measurements.
The cell membrane depolarisation sequence where a small depolarization leads to an increase in sodium permeability, which leads to influx of sodium ions, which in turn depolarizes the membrane even more is now known as the Hodgkin cycle.

In addition, Hodgkin and Huxley&#x27;s findings led them to hypothesize the existence of ion channels on cell membranes, which were confirmed only decades later. Confirmation of ion channels came with the development of the patch clamp leading to a Nobel prize in 1991 for Erwin Neher and Bert Sakmann, and in 2003 for Roderick MacKinnon.

After establishing ion movements across a selectively permeable cell membrane as the mechanism of the action potential, Hodgkin turned his attention to how the ionic interchange that occurs during the action potential could be reversed afterwards. Together with Richard Keynes he demonstrated that in addition to the changes in permeability that lead to an action potential, there is a secretory mechanism that ejects sodium and absorbs potassium against the electrochemical gradients. A few years later, the Danish scientist Jens Christian Skou discovered the enzyme Na+/K+-ATPase that uses ATP to export three sodium ions in exchange for two potassium ions that are imported, for which he received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1997.

Hodgkin was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1953 by Lord Adrian. In October 1961, he was told by Swedish journalists that he, Huxley, and Eccles had been awarded the Nobel Prize. This turned out to be a false alarm, however, when shortly thereafter it was announced that the 1961 Prize was awarded to Georg von Békésy. It was only two years later that Hodgkin, Huxley, and Eccles were finally awarded the Prize &quot;for their discoveries concerning the ionic mechanisms involved in excitation and inhibition in the peripheral and central portions of the nerve cell membrane&quot;. During the Nobel Banquet on 10 December 1963, Hodgkin gave the traditional speech on behalf of the three neurophysiologists, thanking the king and the Nobel Committee for Physiology or Medicine for the award. Incidentally, Hodgkin and his wife attended the Nobel Prize ceremony a second time, three years later, when Hodgkin&#x27;s father-in-law, Francis Peyton Rous, was awarded the 1966 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

==Later career and administrative positions==
From 1951 to 1969, Hodgkin was the Foulerton Professor of the Royal Society at Cambridge. In 1970 he became the John Humphrey Plummer Professor of Biophysics at Cambridge. Around this time he also ended his experiments on nerve at the Plymouth Marine Laboratory and switched his focus to visual research which he could do in Cambridge with the help of others while serving as president of the Royal Society. Together with Denis Baylor and Peter Detwiler he published a series of papers on turtle photoreceptors.

From 1970 to 1975 Hodgkin served as the 53rd president of the Royal Society (PRS). During his tenure as PRS, he was knighted in 1972 and admitted into the Order of Merit in 1973. 
From 1978 to 1985 he was the 34th Master of Trinity College, Cambridge.

He served on the Royal Society Council from 1958 to 1960 and on the Medical Research Council from 1959 to 1963. He was foreign secretary of the Physiological Society from 1961 to 1967. He also held additional administrative posts such as Chancellor, University of Leicester, from 1971 to 1984

==Personal life==
During his stay at the Rockefeller Institute in 1937, Hodgkin got to know the American pathologist Francis Peyton Rous who was later awarded the 1966 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. When Rous invited him for dinner to his home, Hodgkin got to know Rous&#x27; daughter, Marni, who was then a student at Swarthmore College. He proposed to her before going back to England in 1938, but she rejected him. When Hodgkin briefly returned to the US in 1944 (see Wartime activities), they reunited and got married on 31 March. 

Their first daughter, Sarah, was born in April 1945, shortly before the Hodgkins moved back to Cambridge. They had three more children: Deborah Hodgkin (born 2 May 1947), Jonathan Hodgkin (born 24 August 1949), and Rachel Hodgkin (born June 1951).
Marni became a Children&#x27;s Book Editor at Macmillan Publishing Company and a successful writer of children&#x27;s literature, including &quot;Young Winter&#x27;s Tales&quot; and &quot;Dead Indeed&quot;. Jonathan Hodgkin became a molecular biologist at Cambridge University. Deborah Hodgkin is also a successful psychologist.

Thomas Hodgkin (1798–1866), who first described Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma, was Alan Hodgkin&#x27;s great-uncle.

===Death===
Hodgkin suffered from a series of medical problems that began soon after his retirement as Master of Trinity. In 1989 he had surgery to relieve pressure on the spinal cord from one of the intervertebral discs in his neck, which left him unable to walk without support, and with progressive disablement. Hodgkin died in 1998 in Cambridge.

<doc id="353864" wikidata="Q6747270" url="?curid=353864" title="Manchester Airports Group">
<text>Manchester Airports Group Limited, known as MAG is a British airport operator which owns three British airports: Manchester Airport, East Midlands Airport, and Stansted Airport. 

The Group operates under Manchester Airports Holdings Limited, a holding company owned by the ten metropolitan borough councils of Greater Manchester, and Australian investment fund IFM Investors. Founded in 2001, MAG is the largest UK-owned airport operator, following the purchase of BAA by Ferrovial in 2006. In the 2023/24 financial year, 61.3 million passengers used MAG airports.

Of the ten metropolitan boroughs of Greater Manchester, Manchester City Council holds the largest stake, at 35.5%. The remaining nine councils hold a total of 29%. IFM Investors own a 35.5% stake in MAG. The Group has its registered office at Manchester Town Hall. MAG operates on a commercial basis at arm&#x27;s length from its public owners who only take a dividend from profits. This was £20 million in 2010 while MAG retained £80 million from the £100 million profit.

==History==
Manchester Airport opened in 1938 funded by Manchester Corporation, and has remained in public ownership ever since. It is the third-busiest airport in the United Kingdom after Heathrow and Gatwick, and is fractionally busier than Stansted (see Busiest airports in the United Kingdom by total passenger traffic). The M56 motorway was built to serve the airport in 1972, a rail station opened in 1993 and a second runway was completed in 1997.

In 1999, Manchester Airport bought Humberside Airport marking its arrival as an airport management company. In 2000, National Express put both East Midlands and Bournemouth Airport up for sale - both of which were sold for £241 million to MAG in 2001. Consequently, the councils of Greater Manchester saw it fit to create a dedicated holding company to manage this portfolio at arm&#x27;s length. Manchester Airports Group was formed in 2001 to own and operate Manchester Airport and the other smaller acquisitions.

MAG runs airport service-related businesses including baggage handling and ground services, car parking, fire-fighting, airport security, engineering, motor transport services and advertising. The property and development arm of MAG, previously known as MADL (Manchester Airport Developments), was rebranded as MAG Developments in early 2009.

The Group reported 2007/08 profits of £96.5m and decided in 2008 to sell Humberside Airport after 9 years of ownership. However this decision was reversed later in the year following a surge in passenger numbers and little interest from potential bidders. However, MAG sold its 83.7% share of Humberside in 2012 for £2.3 million to Eastern Group who operate nearly half of all flights there amid a return to a general decline of passenger numbers for small regional airport and desire to focus on larger airports.

MAG in partnership with a Canadian pension fund and financial assets unsuccessfully bid for London Gatwick Airport, this followed a report by the Competition Commission into BAA&#x27;s market dominance in London/South East England and Scotland forcing it to sell off some of its airports. MAG made a £1.4 billion offer to acquire Gatwick Airport in 2009. Originally BAA wanted £2 billion for the airport, but eventually came down to an asking price of £1.5 billion. However, MAG refused to arrange a further £100 million of finance and consequently pulled out of the race.

In January 2013 it was announced that MAG had agreed to purchase London Stansted Airport for £1.5 billion. The sale was completed on 28 February 2013.

In 2011 the proposed Airport City Manchester office and commercial space development abutting the airport became one of the Governments new low tax Enterprise Zones, the zones featured include World Logistics Hub to the south of the airport offering logistics and air freight, Airport City to the north of the airport offering office and high-tech manufacturing, MediPark around Wythenshawe Hospital for medical and clinical firms alongside several retail, office and business parks inside the town of Wythenshawe itself. The Group are focused on delivering the £659 million Manchester Airport City. Planning permission for the Airport City development was confirmed on 17 January 2013 and construction work is due to begin in February 2013. On 18 January 2013, it was announced that MAG would purchase Stansted Airport from Heathrow Airport Holdings for £1.5bn. IFM Investors purchased a 35.5% stake in MAG to help fund the takeover. The sale was completed on 28 February 2013.

==Corporate structure and ownership==
The term Manchester Airports Group (MAG) refers to the consolidated group of entities controlled by Manchester Airports Holdings Limited (MAHL).

MAG consists of two main entities: Manchester Airports Holdings Limited (MAHL) and Manchester Airport Group Investments Limited (MAGIL). MAHL serves as the parent company and holding entity, while MAGIL functions as the main operating company, directly owning and managing the group&#x27;s airports and related businesses.

MAG is majority owned by the ten local authorities of Greater Manchester, with Manchester City Council owning 35.5%. The remaining nine authorities, the Metropolitan Boroughs of Bolton, Bury, Oldham, Rochdale, Stockport, Tameside, Trafford, Wigan, together with Salford City Council, collectively own 29%. In 2012, it was decided that rules on shareholding would be changed to allow external, private investors to purchase stakes in order to provide extra capital for future investment and takeovers of airports. Manchester City Council would retain a controlling stake over the organisation. To raise funds for the purchase of Stansted Airport, IFM Investors purchased a 35.5% share in the group.

=== Subsidiaries ===
MAG operates around 48 subsidiary undertakings that support its airport operations and related services. Key subsidiaries include East Midlands International Airport Limited, Manchester Airport Plc, and Stansted Airport Limited.

The group also encompasses several investment holding companies, such as Manchester Airport Finance Holdings Limited and MAG US (Apollo) Inc, which facilitate financial operations and investment activities. Additionally, MAG has trading companies, including MAG Airport Limited and Manchester Airport Car Park (1) Limited, that provide various services related to airport travel and parking.

CAVU is the digital travel services subsidiary of MAG launched in July 2022, formed by the rebranding of Manchester Airports Group&#x27;s (MAG) divisions, MAGO and MAG USA. CAVU offers an eCommerce platform for pre-booking airport services, revenue management, and a network for airport parking. Its Escape Lounges airport lounge brand operates in 15 international airports. The name &quot;CAVU&quot; comes from the aviation term meaning &quot;Ceiling and Visibility Unlimited.&quot;

==Airports==

MAG owns three airports in the United Kingdom (see Busiest airports in the United Kingdom by total passenger traffic).

<text>Gaius Acilius ( 155 BC) was a senator and historian of ancient Rome. 
He knew Greek, and in 155 BC interpreted for Carneades, Diogenes, and Critolaus, who had come to the Roman Senate on an embassy from Athens.

Plutarch cites Acilius&#x27; history in &quot;the Life of Remus&quot;. His history was written in Greek and contained events at least as late as 184 BC (according to Dionysius of Halicarnassus), and it appeared around 142 BC (mentioned in Livy). The work was translated into Latin by a Claudius, most likely Claudius Quadrigarius, but only fragments survive.

<doc id="353869" wikidata="Q164543" url="?curid=353869" title="Why I Am Not a Christian">
<text>Why I Am Not a Christian is an essay by the British philosopher Bertrand Russell. Originally a talk given on 6 March 1927 at Battersea Town Hall, under the auspices of the South London Branch of the National Secular Society, it was published that year as a pamphlet and has been republished several times in English and in translation.

==Contents==

Russell questions the morality of religion, which is, in his view, predominantly based on fear.

Russell opens by defining the term &#x27;Christian&#x27;, rejecting overly broad definitions in favour of two minimal beliefs: that God exists, and that Christ is a supreme moral role-model. He then sets out his reasons for rejecting both of these beliefs, and hence for not labelling himself a Christian.

Russell argues that, although people are usually Christian for emotional reasons or due to their upbringing, it is Catholic dogma that belief in God can be defended by reason alone. Russell then proceeds to attack the main arguments of this kind. The first cause argument is rejected on the grounds that God may not be the first cause or that there may be no first cause at all. The natural law argument is rejected on the grounds that quantum physics produces a probabilistic rather than law-like picture, that the laws are just human descriptions of reality rather than prescriptions (like law in the ordinary sense), and that there is no satisfactory account of God&#x27;s role as law-giver even if there are such laws. The design argument is rejected on the grounds of evolution and the problem of evil. The moral argument is rejected on the grounds of the Euthyphro dilemma, and a modified version based on the remedying of injustice the non-existence of perfect justice (due to the improbability of an afterlife or similar).

Russell then moves on to Christ, and argues that although some of his teachings are praiseworthy, the balance is such that he is not the supreme moral role-model (in comparison to Socrates or Buddha). Russell expresses doubt in the historicity of Jesus, but suggests that even if the account in the Gospels is accepted in its entirety then Christ is still not worthy of worship. Russell highlights Christ&#x27;s teachings on turning the other cheek and helping the poor as examples of the praiseworthy kind, but suggests that these are ironically those least often followed by Christians. Russell then cites chiefly Christ&#x27;s frequent invocations of Hell (but also the stories of the Gadarene swine and the fig-tree) as examples of those teachings that suggest imperfection in both kindness and wisdom.

Russell closes by suggesting that religion is the chief obstacle to moral progress, and an appeal to replace it with science (which can dispel the fear that Russell suggests is the chief cause of all religion) and the moral aim to make the world in which we live a better place.

==History==
The first German edition was published in 1932 by &quot;Kreis der Freunde monistischen Schrifttums&quot;, a monist association in Dresden inspired by Ernst Haeckel. In 1957, Paul Edwards preferred Russell over the then more fashionable Ludwig Wittgenstein and published the essay and further texts referring to the background of &quot;The Bertrand Russell Case&quot;. Russell had been denied a professorship in New York for his political and secular views, tolerance for gay and lesbian behaviour, and support of eugenics, particularly directed towards sterilizing &quot;feeble-minded women&quot;. Some countries banned the book, including South Africa. The enhanced version has been republished in various editions since the 1960s. The New York Public Library listed it among the most influential books of the 20th century.

<text>Valençay () is a commune in the Indre department in the administrative region of Centre-Val de Loire, France.

==Geography==
Valençay is situated in the Loire Valley. It sits at the end of a plateau. on a hillside overlooking the River Nahon. Valençay is part of Berry.

==History==
The commune was formed by the union of three settlements: the &quot;Bourg-de-l&#x27;Eglise&quot;, the &quot;Bas-Bourg&quot; and what is called the &quot;old quarter.&quot;

The chateau is a part of the Loire Valley by virtue of the date of its construction and its dimensions, which give it a similar appearance to Chambord.

A 12th-century castle existed on this site, was demolished and construction of its replacement began in 1520, albeit slowly. The chateau was born in the 16th and 17th centuries by the Estampes family. Louis of Estampes, governor and baillif of Blois, undertook the building of the large round tower at the end of the entrance wing. He died in 1530, leaving the tower unfinished. The tower rises above the entry.

Work on Valençay began again about 1540 under Jacques of Estampes, lord of the manor. He had married a Grassement with a financier in the family. The lord wanted a residence worthy of his new fortune. Jacques covered the dome of the tower with an imperial design.

Valençay was rebuilt multiple times.

At the end of the 16th century, Jean of Estampes built a gatehouse in the shape of a keep, confined to four turrets. It connects to the spans built by Jacques. Jean built the building and the tower on the left of the central house. In the 17th century, Dominique of Estampes finished the wing in the same style as the first half. The castle then formed a quadrilateral enclosed by a second wing and, at the bottom of the court, by arcades.

Finance remained mixed with Valençay&#x27;s history: among its successive owners include farmers. Valençay was sold in 1747 to the general farmer Legendre de Villemorien. He demolished a part of the buildings, preserving only the entry and the first wing. Also Scottish banker John Law purchased it.

In 1803 the castle was purchased by diplomat Charles Maurice de Talleyrand..

On 6 May 1941, Georges Bégué, the first SOE agent from England, was parachuted into a field near Valençay. Fifty years later, the Valençay SOE Memorial, originally known as the &quot;&quot;Spirit of Partnership&quot;,&quot; was dedicated in honour of the 104 members of SOE&#x27;s F Section who died for the liberation of France.

== Design of the chateau ==
The entrance is asymmetric and features an enormous tower and a house. The wing offers a more homogeneous style but this unity is superficial and of later vintage.

== Population ==
==Economy==
The town is known for its pyramid-shaped Valençay cheese made from raw goats&#x27; milk.
The town&#x27;s twin city is Cesano Maderno in Lombardy, Italy

<text>Computer art is art in which computers play a role in the production or display of the artwork. Such art can be an image, sound, animation, video, CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, video game, website, algorithm, performance or gallery installation. Many traditional disciplines are now integrating digital technologies and, as a result, the lines between traditional works of art and new media works created using computers has been blurred. For instance, an artist may combine traditional painting with algorithm art and other digital techniques. As a result, defining computer art by its end product can thus be difficult. Computer art is bound to change over time since changes in technology and software directly affect what is possible.

== Origin of the term ==
On the title page of the magazine &quot;Computers and Automation&quot;, January 1963, Edmund Berkeley published a picture by Efraim Arazi from 1962, coining for it the term &quot;computer art.&quot; This picture inspired him to initiate the first &quot;Computer Art Contest&quot; in 1963. The annual contest was a key point in the development of computer art up to the year 1973.

== History ==


The precursor of computer art dates back to 1956–1958, with the generation of what is probably the first image of a human being on a computer screen, a (George Petty-inspired) pin-up girl at a SAGE air defense installation. Desmond Paul Henry created his first electromechanical Henry Drawing Machine in 1961, using an adapted analogue Bombsight Computer. His drawing machine-generated artwork was shown at the Reid Gallery in London in 1962 after his traditional, non-machine artwork won him the privilege of a one-man exhibition there. It was artist L.S.Lowry who encouraged Henry to include examples of his machine-generated art in the Reid Gallery exhibition. .

By the mid-1960s, most individuals involved in the creation of computer art were in fact engineers and scientists because they had access to the only computing resources available at university scientific research labs. Many artists tentatively began to explore the emerging computing technology for use as a creative tool. In the summer of 1962, A. Michael Noll programmed a digital computer at Bell Telephone Laboratories in Murray Hill, New Jersey to generate visual patterns solely for artistic purposes. His later computer-generated patterns simulated paintings by Piet Mondrian and Bridget Riley and became classics. Noll also used the patterns to investigate aesthetic preferences in the mid-1960s.

The two early exhibitions of computer art were held in 1965: Generative Computergrafik, February 1965, at the Technische Hochschule in Stuttgart, Germany, and Computer-Generated Pictures, April 1965, at the Howard Wise Gallery in New York. The Stuttgart exhibit featured work by Georg Nees; the New York exhibit featured works by Bela Julesz and A. Michael Noll and was reviewed as art by &quot;The New York Times&quot;. A third exhibition was put up in November 1965 at Galerie Wendelin Niedlich in Stuttgart, Germany, showing works by Frieder Nake and Georg Nees. Analogue computer art by Maughan Mason along with digital computer art by Noll were exhibited at the AFIPS Fall Joint Computer Conference in Las Vegas toward the end of 1965.

In 1968, the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) in London hosted one of the most influential early exhibitions of computer art called Cybernetic Serendipity. The exhibition, curated by Jasia Reichardt, included many of those often regarded as the first digital artists, Nam June Paik, Frieder Nake, Leslie Mezei, Georg Nees, A. Michael Noll, John Whitney, and Charles Csuri. One year later, the Computer Arts Society was founded, also in London.

At the time of the opening of Cybernetic Serendipity, in August 1968, a symposium was held in Zagreb, Yugoslavia, under the title &quot;Computers and visual research&quot;. It took up the European artists movement of New Tendencies that had led to three exhibitions (in 1961, 63, and 65) in Zagreb of concrete, kinetic, and constructive art as well as op art and conceptual art. New Tendencies changed its name to &quot;Tendencies&quot; and continued with more symposia, exhibitions, a competition, and an international journal (bit international) until 1973.
Katherine Nash and Richard Williams published &quot;Computer Program for Artists: ART 1&quot; in 1970.

Xerox Corporation&#x27;s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) designed the first Graphical User Interface (GUI) in the 1970s. The first Macintosh computer was released in 1984; since then the GUI became popular. Many graphic designers quickly accepted its capacity as a creative tool.

Andy Warhol created digital art using an Amiga when the computer was publicly introduced at the Lincoln Center, New York in July 1985. An image of Debbie Harry was captured in monochrome from a video camera and digitized into a graphics program called ProPaint. Warhol manipulated the image adding colour by using flood fills.

==Output devices==
Formerly, technology restricted output and print results. Early machines used pen-and-ink plotters to produce basic hard copy.

In the early 1960s, the Stromberg Carlson SC-4020 microfilm printer was used at Bell Telephone Laboratories as a plotter to produce digital computer art and animation on 35-mm microfilm. Still images were drawn on the face plate of the cathode ray tube and automatically photographed. A series of still images were drawn to create a computer-animated movie, early on a roll of 35-mm film and then on 16-mm film as a 16-mm camera was later added to the SC-4020 printer.

In the 1970s, the dot matrix printer (which uses a print head hitting an ink ribbon somewhat like a typewriter) was used to reproduce varied fonts and arbitrary graphics. The first animations were created by plotting all still frames sequentially on a stack of paper, with motion transfer to 16-mm film for projection. During the 1970s and 1980s, dot matrix printers were used to produce most visual output while microfilm plotters were used for most early animation.

In 1976, the inkjet printer was invented with the increase in the use of personal computers. The inkjet printer is now the cheapest and most versatile option for everyday digital color output. Raster Image Processing (RIP) is typically built into the printer or supplied as a software package for the computer; it is required to achieve the highest quality output. Basic inkjet devices do not feature RIP. Instead, they rely on graphic software to rasterize images. The laser printer, though more expensive than the inkjet, is another affordable output device available today.

== Graphic software ==
Adobe Systems, founded in 1982, developed the PostScript language and digital fonts, making drawing, painting, and image manipulation software popular. Adobe Illustrator, a vector drawing program based on the Bézier curve introduced in 1987 and Adobe Photoshop, written by brothers Thomas and John Knoll in 1990 were developed for use on MacIntosh computers, and compiled for DOS/Windows platforms by 1993.

== Robot painting ==

A &quot;robot painting&quot; is an artwork painted by a robot. Raymond Auger&#x27;s Painting Machine, made in 1962, was one of the first robotic painters as was AARON, an artificial intelligence/artist developed by Harold Cohen beginning in the late 1960s. Joseph Nechvatal began making large computer-robotic paintings in 1986. Artist Ken Goldberg created an 11&#x27; x 11&#x27; painting machine in 1992 and German artist Matthias Groebel also built his own robotic painting machine in the early 1990s.

== Neural style transfer ==

Non-photorealistic rendering (using computers to automatically transform images into stylized art) has been a subject of research since the 1990s. Around 2015, &quot;neural style transfer&quot; using convolutional neural networks to transfer the style of an artwork onto a photograph or other target image became feasible. One method of style transfer involves using a framework such as VGG or ResNet to break the artwork style down into statistics about visual features. The target photograph is subsequently modified to match those statistics. Notable applications include Prisma, Facebook Caffe2Go style transfer, MIT&#x27;s Nightmare Machine, and DeepArt.

== AI generated art ==

With the rise of AI image generators such as DALL-E 2, Flux, Midjourney, and others, there is area of AI generated art. There is much controversy and debate over whether AI generated art is actual art.

<doc id="353883" wikidata="Q567376" url="?curid=353883" title="Annuit cœptis">
<text>Annuit cœptis (, ) is one of two mottos on the reverse side of the Great Seal of the United States. The literal translation is &quot;[He] favors (or &quot;has favored&quot;) [our] undertakings&quot;, from Latin (&quot;I approve, I favor&quot;), and (&quot;commencement, undertaking&quot;). Because of its context as a caption above the Eye of Providence, the standard translations are &quot;Providence favors our undertakings&quot; and &quot;Providence has favored our undertakings.&quot; 

== On the Great Seal ==

Barton explained that the motto alluded to the Eye of Providence: &quot;&quot;Deo favente&quot; which alludes to the Eye in the Arms, meant for the Eye of Providence.&quot; In western art, God is traditionally represented by the Eye of Providence, which principally symbolizes God&#x27;s omniscience.
In 1782, Samuel Adams appointed a design artist, William Barton of Philadelphia, to bring a proposal for the national seal. For the reverse, Barton suggested a 13-layered pyramid underneath the Eye of Providence. The mottos which Barton chose to accompany the design were &quot;Deo Favente&quot; (&quot;with God&#x27;s favor&quot;, or more literally, &quot;with God favoring&quot;) and &quot;Perennis&quot; (&quot;Everlasting&quot;). The pyramid and &quot;Perennis&quot; motto had come from a $50 Continental currency bill designed by Francis Hopkinson.

==Change from &quot;Deo Favente&quot; to &quot;Annuit Cœptis&quot;==

When designing the final version of the Great Seal, Charles Thomson (a former Latin teacher) kept the pyramid and eye for the reverse side but replaced the two mottos, using &quot;Annuit Cœptis&quot; instead of &quot;Deo Favente&quot; and &quot;Novus ordo seclorum&quot; instead of &quot;Perennis&quot;. When he provided his official explanation of the meaning of this motto, he wrote:

&quot;Annuit Cœptis&quot; is translated by the U.S. State Department, the U.S. Mint, and the U.S. Treasury as, &quot;He [God] has favored our undertakings&quot; (brackets in original). However, the original Latin does not explicitly state who (or what) is the subject of the sentence.

A 2024 publication in the Associated Gospel Churches Journal explores the question as to whether &quot;Annuit Coeptis&quot; makes reference to God, examining the claim that the founders of the United States were deliberate to avoid references to God by choosing only secular mottos.

==Classical source of the motto==
According to Richard S. Patterson and Richardson Dougall, &quot;Annuit cœptis&quot; (meaning &quot;He favours our undertakings&quot;) and the other motto on the reverse of the Great Seal, &quot;Novus ordo seclorum&quot; (meaning &quot;new order of the ages&quot;), can both be traced to lines by the Roman poet Virgil. &quot;Annuit cœptis&quot; comes from the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, book IX, line 635, which reads, &quot;Iuppiter omnipotens, audacibus adnue coeptis&quot;. It is a prayer by Ascanius, the son of the hero of the story, Aeneas, which translates to, &quot;Jupiter Almighty, favour [my] bold undertakings&quot;, just before slaying an enemy warrior, Numanus.

The same language also occurred in an earlier poem of Virgil, the &quot;Georgics&quot;. In line I.40 of that work is the phrase &quot;da facilem cursum atque &quot;audacibus annue cœptis&quot;.&quot; The line is addressed to Caesar Augustus and translates to &quot;give [us] an easy path and nod at our audacious undertakings.&quot;

<doc id="353890" wikidata="Q25098515" url="?curid=353890" title="Universality class">
<text>In statistical mechanics, a universality class is a collection of mathematical models which share a single scale-invariant limit under the process of renormalization group flow. While the models within a class may differ dramatically at finite scales, their behavior will become increasingly similar as the limit scale is approached. In particular, asymptotic phenomena such as critical exponents will be the same for all models in the class.

Some well-studied universality classes are the ones containing the Ising model or the percolation theory at their respective phase transition points; these are both families of classes, one for each lattice dimension. Typically, a family of universality classes will have a lower and upper critical dimension: below the lower critical dimension, the universality class becomes degenerate (this dimension is 2d for the Ising model, or for directed percolation, but 1d for undirected percolation), and above the upper critical dimension the critical exponents stabilize and can be calculated by an analog of mean-field theory (this dimension is 4d for Ising or for directed percolation, and 6d for undirected percolation).

==List of critical exponents==
Critical exponents are defined in terms of the variation of certain physical properties of the system near its phase transition point. These physical properties will include its reduced temperature formula_1, its order parameter measuring how much of the system is in the &quot;ordered&quot; phase, the specific heat, and so on.

*The exponent formula_2 is the exponent relating the specific heat C to the reduced temperature: we have formula_3. The specific heat will usually be singular at the critical point, but the minus sign in the definition of formula_2 allows it to remain positive.
*The exponent formula_5 relates the order parameter formula_6 to the temperature. Unlike most critical exponents it is assumed positive, since the order parameter will usually be zero at the critical point. So we have formula_7.
*The exponent formula_8 relates the temperature with the system&#x27;s response to an external driving force, or source field. We have formula_9, with J the driving force.
*The exponent formula_10 relates the order parameter to the source field at the critical temperature, where this relationship becomes nonlinear. We have formula_11 (hence formula_12), with the same meanings as before.
*The exponent formula_13 relates the size of correlations (i.e. patches of the ordered phase) to the temperature; away from the critical point these are characterized by a correlation length formula_14. We have formula_15.
*The exponent formula_16 measures the size of correlations at the critical temperature. It is defined so that the correlation function scales as formula_17.
*The exponent formula_18, used in percolation theory, measures the size of the largest clusters (roughly, the largest ordered blocks) at &#x27;temperatures&#x27; (connection probabilities) below the critical point. So formula_19.
*The exponent formula_1, also from percolation theory, measures the number of size &quot;s&quot; clusters far from formula_21 (or the number of clusters at criticality): formula_22, with the formula_23 factor removed at critical probability.

For symmetries, the group listed gives the symmetry of the order parameter. The group formula_24 is the dihedral group, the symmetry group of the &quot;n&quot;-gon, formula_25 is the &quot;n&quot;-element symmetric group, formula_26 is the octahedral group, and formula_27 is the orthogonal group in &quot;n&quot; dimensions. 1 is the trivial group.

<doc id="353891" wikidata="Q1543700" url="?curid=353891" title="Full-time equivalent">
<text>Full-time equivalent (FTE), or whole time equivalent (WTE), is a unit of measurement that indicates the workload of an employed person (or student) in a way that makes workloads or class loads comparable across various contexts. FTE is often used to measure a worker&#x27;s or student&#x27;s involvement in a project, or to track cost reductions in an organization. An FTE of 1.0 is equivalent to a full-time worker or student, while an FTE of 0.5 signals half of a full work or school load.

==In government==
===United States===
According to the federal government of the United States, FTE is defined by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) as the number of total hours worked divided by the maximum number of compensable hours in a full-time schedule as defined by law. For example, if the normal schedule for a quarter is defined as 411.25 hours ([35 hours per week × (52 weeks per year – 5 weeks&#x27; regulatory vacation)] / 4), then someone working 100 hours during that quarter represents 100/411.25 = 0.24 FTE. Two employees working in total 400 hours during that same quarterly period represent 0.97 FTE.

The U.S. Office of Management and Budget, or OMB, the president&#x27;s budget office, will often place upper limits on the total number of FTE that a given agency may utilize each year. In the past, if agencies were given a ceiling on the actual number of employed workers, which was reported on a given day of the year, the agency could employ more than this number for much of the year. Then, as the reporting deadline approached, employees could be let go to reduce the total number to the authorized ceiling on the reporting date. Providing agencies with an FTE ceiling, which is calculated based on the total number of hours worked by all employees throughout the year, irrespective of the total numbers employed at any point in time, prevents agencies from using such a strategy.

Although the generally accepted human-resources meaning for the &quot;E&quot; in FTE is &quot;equivalent&quot;, the term is often overloaded in colloquial usage to indicate a &quot;direct, as opposed to contract, full-time employee&quot;.
The term WYE (work year equivalent) is often used instead of FTE when describing the contractor work.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, full time equivalent equates to the standard 40-hour work week: eight hours per day, five days per week and is the total amount of hours that a single full-time employee has worked over any period. This allows employers to adopt a single metric for comparison with the full-time average. For example, a full week of 40 hours has an FTE value of 1.0, so a person working 20 hours would have an FTE value of 0.5. Certain industries may adopt 35 hours, depending on the company, its location and the nature of work. Whole-time equivalent (WTE) is the same as FTE and applies also to students in education.

==In education ==
Full-time equivalent students is one of the key metrics for measuring enrollment in colleges and universities. The measure is often annualized to cover the average annual full-time equivalent students and is designated by the acronym AAFTE.

Academics can increase their contribution by adopting a number of strategies:
(a) increase class size;
(b) teach new classes;
(c) supervise more projects;
(d) supervise more researchers.
The latter strategy has the advantage of contributing to another key metric in universities - creating new knowledge and in particular publishing papers in highly ranked academic journals. It is also linked to another key metric - research funding which is often required to attract researchers.

===Australia===
In Australia, the equivalent to FTE for students is EFTSL (Equivalent Full-Time Student Load).

===Example===
A professor teaches two undergraduate courses, supervises two undergraduate projects and supervises four researchers by thesis only (i.e. researchers do not take any courses). Each undergraduate course is worth one-tenth of all credits for the undergraduate program (i.e. 0.1 FTE). An undergraduate project is worth two-tenths of all credits for the undergraduate program (i.e. 0.2 FTE). A research thesis is worth all of the credits for the graduate program (i.e. 1 FTE). The professor&#x27;s contribution is 29.4 FTEs:

To encourage more research some universities offer 2 FTEs or even 3 FTEs for each full-time researcher.

<doc id="353893" wikidata="Q713664" url="?curid=353893" title="Jacques Lauriston">
<text>Jacques Alexandre Bernard Law, marquis de Lauriston (; 1 February 1768 – 12 June 1828) was a French soldier and diplomat of Scottish and Portuguese descent, and a general officer in the French Army during the Napoleonic Wars. He was born in Pondicherry in French India, where his father, Jean Law de Lauriston, was Governor-General. Jean Law de Lauriston was a nephew of the financier John Law. Jacques&#x27; mother was a member of the Carvallho family of Portuguese traders.

Lauriston Castle, in Scotland, was inherited by John Law in 1729. Lauriston is one of the names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe.

==Early career==
Lauriston obtained his first commission about 1786, served with the artillery and on the general staff during the early campaigns of the Revolution, and became brigadier of artillery in 1795. Resigning in 1796, he was brought back into the service in 1800 as &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; to Napoleon, with whom, as a cadet, Lauriston had been on friendly terms. In the years immediately preceding the first empire, Lauriston was, successively, director of the La Fère artillery school and special envoy to Denmark before being selected to convey to England the ratification of the Peace of Amiens in 1802.

In 1805, having risen to the rank of general of division, he took part in the war against Austria. He occupied Venice and the Republic of Ragusa in 1806, was made governor-general of Venice in 1807, took part in the Erfurt negotiations of 1808, was ennobled as a count, and served with the emperor during the Peninsular War in Spain (1808–1809), where he commanded the division that besieged and won Pamplona. He fought under Viceroy Eugène de Beauharnais at the Battle of Raab in the Italian campaign and the subsequent advance to Vienna.

==Fame and high command==
At the Battle of Wagram on 6 July 1809, Napoleon ordered Lauriston to form a grand battery to stop the surprise Austrian attack against his left flank. To provide time, the emperor directed General Étienne Marie Antoine Champion de Nansouty&#x27;s heavy cavalry to charge. While Nansouty&#x27;s cuirassiers and carabiniers sacrificed themselves in futile attacks on the Austrians, Lauriston assembled 112 artillery pieces for his huge battery. He gathered all 60 guns from the Imperial Guard, 24 guns from General Karl Philipp von Wrede&#x27;s Bavarian division, and 38 pieces from Eugène&#x27;s Army of Italy. He advanced the batteries into grapeshot range, unlimbered the guns, and opened fire. In the face of this terrific blizzard of lead, the Austrian III &quot;Armeekorps&quot; of General Johann Kollowrat halted and edged back out of the firing range. The barrage allowed time for Napoleon to organize a successful counterattack.

In 1811, Lauriston was made ambassador to Russia. In 1812, he held a command in the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; and gained distinction through his firmness in covering the retreat from Moscow. He commanded the V Corps at Lützen and Bautzen during the German campaign, but was captured during the disastrous retreat after the Battle of Leipzig in October 1813.

Lauriston was held as a prisoner of war until the fall of the empire. He then joined King Louis XVIII of France, to whom he remained faithful during the Hundred Days. His reward was a seat in the Chamber of Peers and a command in the Royal Guard. In 1817, he was created a marquis, and became commandant &quot;supérieur&quot; of the &quot;Département du Finistère et de la place de Brest&quot;. In 1823, Lauriston was made a Marshal of France and he commanded a corps during the Spanish expedition. He died of a stroke in Paris on 11 June 1828. The name is inscribed on Column 13 of the Arc de Triomphe.

<text>The Battle of Munda (17 March 45 BC), in southern Hispania Ulterior, was the final battle of Caesar&#x27;s civil war against the leaders of the Optimates. With the military victory at Munda and the deaths of Titus Labienus and Gnaeus Pompeius (eldest son of Pompey), Caesar was politically able to return in triumph to Rome, and then govern as the elected Roman dictator. Subsequently, the assassination of Julius Caesar furthered the long Republican decline that led to the Roman Empire, initiated with the reign of the emperor Augustus.

==Prelude==
The republicans had initially been led by Pompey, until the Battle of Pharsalus in 48 BC and Pompey&#x27;s death soon afterwards. However, in April 46 BC, Caesar&#x27;s forces destroyed the Pompeian army at the Battle of Thapsus.

After this, military opposition to Caesar was confined to Hispania (the Iberian Peninsula, comprising modern Spain and Portugal). During the Spring of 46 BC, two legions in Hispania Ulterior, largely formed by former Pompeian veterans enrolled in Caesar&#x27;s army, had declared themselves for Gnaeus Pompeius (son of Pompey the Great) and driven out Caesar&#x27;s proconsul. Soon they were joined by the remnants of the Pompeian army. These forces were commanded by the brothers Gnaeus and Sextus Pompeius (sons of Pompey), Publius Attius Varus and by the talented general Titus Labienus, who had been one of the most trusted of Caesar&#x27;s generals during the Gallic Wars. Using the resources of the province, they were able to raise an army of four legions. These were the two original veteran legions, a legion formed from the survivors of Thapsus, and an additional legion recruited from Roman citizens and local inhabitants. They took control of almost all Hispania Ulterior, including the important Roman colonies of Italica and Corduba (the capital of the province). Caesar&#x27;s generals Quintus Fabius Maximus and Quintus Pedius did not risk a battle, and remained encamped at Obulco (present-day Porcuna), about east of Corduba, requesting help from Caesar.
Thus, Caesar was forced to move from Rome to Hispania to deal with the Pompeius brothers. He brought three trusted veteran legions (X &quot;Equestris&quot;, V &quot;Alaudae&quot; and VI &quot;Ferrata&quot;) and one of the newer legions III &quot;Gallica&quot;, but in the main was forced to rely on the recruits already present in Hispania. Caesar covered the from Rome to Obulco in less than one month, arriving in early December (he immediately wrote a short poem, &quot;Iter&quot;, describing this journey). Caesar had called for his great-nephew Octavian to join him, but due to his health, Octavian was only able to reach him after the conclusion of the campaign.

===Ulia===
When Caesar arrived in Hispania Baetica the Pompeians were laying siege to Ulia (one of the few towns which had remained loyal to Caesar). Lucius Vibius Paciaecus, one of his officers who was known to the Ulians and knew the area, was sent with six cohorts (2,000-3,000 legionaries) to reinforce the defenders. Caesar himself marched his main army on Corduba hoping to draw the Pompeians from Ulia. Paciaecus arrived near Ulia during the night just when a storm swept in. Using the darkness and the rain Paciaecus marched his men through the Pompeian lines; the sentries, unable to recognize the legionary symbols, let them pass. Paciaecus slipped his men into the city, reinforcing the defenders.

===Corduba===
While Ulia was being reinforced, Caesar marched on towards Corduba, which was defended by Sextus Pompeius and a strong garrison. En route, Caesar&#x27;s vanguard clashed with Sextus&#x27; cavalry, alerting the Pompeians to his presence. Sextus sent word to his brother that Caesar was near Corduba and requested reinforcements. Gnaeus gave up the siege of Ulia and marched to his brother&#x27;s aid with the entire Pompeian army. Sextus had blocked or destroyed the bridge to Corduba across the Baetis. Caesar constructed a makeshift bridge and marched his army across, setting up camp near Corduba. Soon Gnaeus and Labienus arrived with the Pompeian army. Fierce skirmishes were fought on the bridge, with both sides losing many men. Caesar was looking for a decisive engagement and this was not going to be it. So during one night Caesar&#x27;s army slipped out of their camp and after a daring river crossing they marched on Ategua.

===Ategua===
After arriving at the fortified city of Ategua, Caesar began besieging it, building several camps around it. Gnaeus and Labienus marched their army around Caesar&#x27;s positions, hoping to surprise him by coming in from an unexpected direction. They approached under the cover of a thick fog, surprising a number of Caesar&#x27;s pickets. When the fog lifted, it became clear Caesar had taken all the highground around the city and was entrenched very well. Building a camp to the west (between Caesar and Ucubi), they tried to come up with a plan to dislodge their opponent from his superior position. They launched an attack on the camp of Postumius and the XXVIII, but were repulsed when Caesar sent the V, VI and X to aid their comrades. The following day Caesar was reinforced by his allies, most notably king Bogud of West-Mauretania. Under Labienus’ advice, Gnaeus Pompeius decided to avoid an open battle, and Caesar was forced to wage a winter campaign, while procuring food and shelter for his army. In early 45 BC, the pro-Caesarian faction in Ategua offered to surrender the city to Caesar, but when the Pompeian garrison found out, they executed the pro-Caesarian leaders. The garrison tried to fight their way through Caesar&#x27;s lines some time after the incident, but were beaten back. The city surrendered soon after; this was an important blow to the Pompeian confidence and morale, and some of the native allies started to desert to Caesar.

===Salsum and Soricaria===
After taking Ategua, Caesar started building a camp near the Pompeian camp across the River Salsum. Gnaeus attacked quickly, catching Caesar off guard. The heroic actions and sacrifice of two centurions of the V stabilized the line. After this setback, Caesar decided to retreat to Sorecaria, cutting off one of the Pompeian supply lines. Another skirmish near Soricaria on March 7 went in Caesar&#x27;s favor; many Romans in the Pompeian camp began planning to defect, and Gnaeus Pompeius was forced to abandon his delaying tactics and offer battle. He broke camp and marched his army south towards the town of Munda.

==Battle==

The two armies met in the plains of Munda in southern Spain. The Pompeian army was situated on a gentle hill, less than one mile (1.6 km) from the walls of Munda, in a defensible position. Caesar led a total of eight legions (Legio II, III, V, VI, X, XXI, XXVIII and XXX), with 8,000 horsemen and an unknown number of light infantry, while Pompeius commanded thirteen legions, 6,000 light-infantrymen, and about 6,000 horsemen. Many of the Republican soldiers had already surrendered to Caesar in previous campaigns and had then deserted his army to rejoin Pompeius: they would fight with desperation, fearing that they would not be pardoned a second time (indeed Caesar had executed prisoners at his last major victory, at Thapsus). After an unsuccessful ploy designed to lure the Pompeians down the hill, Caesar ordered a frontal attack (with the watchword &quot;Venus&quot;, the goddess reputed to be his ancestor).

The fighting lasted for 8 hours without a clear advantage for either side, causing the generals to leave their commanding positions and join the ranks. As Caesar himself later said he had fought many times for victory, but at Munda he had to fight for his life. Caesar took command of his right wing, where his favorite Legio X Equestris was involved in heavy fighting. With Caesar&#x27;s inspiration the tenth legion began to push back Pompeius&#x27; forces. Aware of the danger, Gnaeus Pompeius removed a legion from his own right wing to reinforce the threatened left wing, which was a critical mistake. As soon as the Pompeian right wing was thus weakened, Caesar&#x27;s cavalry launched a decisive attack, which turned the course of the battle. King Bogud and his Mauretanian cavalry attacked the Pompeian right breaking through the flank and attacking the rear of the Pompeian army. Titus Labienus, commander of the Pompeian cavalry, saw this manoeuvre and moved some troops to intercept them.

The Pompeian army misinterpreted the situation. Already under heavy pressure on both the left (from Legio X) and right wings (the cavalry charge), they thought Labienus was retreating. The Pompeian legions broke their lines and fled in disorder. Although some were able to find refuge within the walls of Munda, many more were killed in the rout. At the end of the battle there were about 30,000 Pompeians dead on the field; losses on Caesar&#x27;s side were lighter, about 1,000. All thirteen standards of the Pompeian legions were captured, a sign of complete disbandment. Titus Labienus and Attius Varus died on the field and were granted a burial by Caesar, while Gnaeus Pompeius managed to escape from the battlefield.

==Aftermath==
Caesar left his legate Quintus Fabius Maximus to besiege Munda, and moved to pacify the province. Corduba surrendered: men in arms present in the town (mostly armed slaves) were executed, and the city was forced to pay a heavy indemnity. The city of Munda held out for some time, but, after an unsuccessful attempt to break the siege, surrendered, with 14,000 prisoners taken. Gaius Didius, a naval commander loyal to Caesar, hunted down most of the Pompeian ships. Gnaeus Pompeius looked for refuge on land, but was cornered during the Battle of Lauro and killed.

Although Sextus Pompeius remained at large, after Munda there were no more conservative armies challenging Caesar&#x27;s dominion. Upon his return to Rome, according to Plutarch, the &quot;triumph which he celebrated for this victory displeased the Romans beyond any thing. For he had not defeated foreign generals, or barbarian kings, but had destroyed the children and family of one of the greatest men of Rome.&quot; Caesar was made dictator for life, though his success was short-lived; Caesar was murdered on March 15 of the following year (44 BC) by the next generation of statesmen, led by Brutus and Cassius.

==Localization==
The exact location of Munda has long been a matter of debate.

Some Spanish historians asserted that Munda was the Roman name for modern-day Ronda, where the battle of Munda may have been fought. Other early researchers localized the battle in various other places, e.g. near Monda or Montilla, the latter having been proposed on the basis of on an earlier localization attempt that was only meant to honor a member of the French royal house, who was born in Montilla.

It is a matter of civic pride in Montilla that the Battle of Munda was (according to them) fought nearby, and at the outset of Hispanist Prosper Mérimée&#x27;s novella Carmen, source of Georges Bizet&#x27;s opera, the narrator clearly states that his research indicates that Munda was near Montilla (no reference to either Munda or Montilla is found in Bizet&#x27;s opera).

Other experts have asserted that Munda was fought just outside Osuna, in the province of Seville. This was supported by ancient slingshot bullets that were excavated near La Lantejuela, halfway between Osuna and Écija. The theory is further supported by ancient inscriptions found in Écija and Osuna that honor the town of Astigi (Écija) for standing firmly on Caesar&#x27;s side during the battle. Therefore, the Battle of Munda probably took place on the &quot;Cerro de las Balas&quot; and the &quot;Llanos del Aguila&quot; near La Lantejuela.

<doc id="353903" wikidata="Q358491" url="?curid=353903" title="Honoré d'Urfé">
<text>Honoré d&#x27;Urfé, marquis de [[Valromey]], comte de [[Songieu|Châteauneuf]] (11 February 15681 June 1625) was a French novelist and miscellaneous writer.

== Life ==
He was born at Marseille, the grandson of Claude d&#x27;Urfé, and was educated at the Collège de Tournon. A partisan of the League, he was taken prisoner in 1595, and, though soon set free, he was again captured and imprisoned. During his imprisonment he read Ronsard, Petrarch and above all the &quot;Diana&quot; of Jorge de Montemayor and Tasso&#x27;s &quot;Aminta&quot;. After the defeat of the League in 1594, d&#x27;Urfé emigrated to Savoy whose duke was a relative of his mother. Here, he wrote the &quot;Epîtres morales&quot; (1598).

Honoré&#x27;s brother Anne, comte d&#x27;Urfé, had married in 1571 the beautiful Diane de Châteaumorand, but the marriage was annulled in 1598 by Clement VIII. Anne d&#x27;Urfé was ordained to the priesthood in 1603, and died in 1621 dean of Montbrison.

Diane had a great fortune, and to avoid the alienation of the money from the D&#x27;Urfé family, Honoré married her in 1600. This marriage also proved unhappy; D&#x27;Urfé spent most of his time separated from his wife at the court of Savoy, where he held the charge of chamberlain. The separation of goods arranged later on may have been simply due to money embarrassments.

He died from injuries received by a fall from his horse at Villafranca, during a campaign against the Genoese.

== Works ==

It was in Savoy that he conceived the plan of his novel &quot;L&#x27;Astrée&quot;, the scene of which is laid on the banks of the Lignon in his native province of Forez. It is a leisurely romance in which the loves of Celadon and Astrée are told at immense length with many digressions. The recently discovered circumstances of the marriages of the brothers have disposed of the idea that the romance is autobiographical in its main idea, but some of the episodes are said to be but slightly veiled accounts of the adventures of Henry IV. The shepherds and shepherdesses of the story are of the usual type in pastorals, and they discourse of love with a casuistry and elaborate delicacy that are by no means rustic.

The first part of &quot;L&#x27;Astrée&quot; appeared in 1607, the second in 1610, the third in 1619, and in 1627 the fourth part was edited. In 1628 a fifth was added by D&#x27;Urfé&#x27;s secretary Balthazar Baro. &quot;L&#x27;Astrée&quot; set the fashion temporarily in romance narratives, and no tragedy was complete without wire-drawn discussions on love in the manner of Celadon and Astrée. The best edition of &quot;L&#x27;Astrée&quot; is that of 1647.

D&#x27;Urfé also wrote the pastoral poem &quot;Le Sireine&quot; (publ 1606) and the pastoral play &quot;Sylvanire&quot; (1627).

== Memory and legacy ==
In 1757 &quot;L&#x27;Astrée&quot; was sufficiently in the public consciousness, or at any rate &quot;Celadon&quot; had become a byword for amorousness, to be referred to in passing by an Italian guest of Casanova.

In 1908 a bust of D&#x27;Urfé was erected at Virieu-le-Grand (Ain), where the greater part of &quot;L&#x27;Astrée&quot; was written.

An adaptation of &quot;L&#x27;Astrée,&quot; by French director Eric Rohmer, was released in 2007 under the title &quot;Les Amours d&#x27;Astrée et de Céladon&quot; (in English-speaking territories its title was &quot;The Romance of Astrea and Celadon).&quot; It was nominated for a Golden Lion at the 2007 Venice Film Festival, and star Andy Gillet won an Étoile d&#x27;Or in 2008 for Best Male Newcomer for his performance as Céladon.

<doc id="353906" wikidata="Q2044655" url="?curid=353906" title="Satyavati">
<text>Satyavati (, ; also spelled Satyawati) was the queen of the Kuru Kingdom in the Hindu epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. Satyavati is married to king Shantanu of Hastinapura, and is a great-grandmother of the Pandava and Kaurava princes. She is also the mother of the seer Vyasa, author of the epic. Her story appears in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, the &quot;Harivamsa,&quot; and the &quot;Devi Bhagavata Purana&quot;.

Satyavati is the daughter of a fisherman chieftain, Dasharaja and was brought up as a commoner on the banks of the river Yamuna. Another legend says that she is the biological daughter of the Chedi king Uparichara Vasu (Vasu) and a cursed &quot;apsara&quot; (celestial nymph), who was turned into a fish called Adrika. Due to the smell emanating from her body, she was known as &quot;Matsyagandha&quot; (&quot;She who smells like fish&quot;), and helped her father, Dasharaja, in his job as ferryman and fisherman.

As a young woman, Satyavati met the wandering rishi (sage) Parashara, who fathered her son Vyasa out of wedlock. The sage also gave her a musky fragrance, which earned her names like &quot;Yojanagandha&quot; (&quot;She whose fragrance is spread as far as a &quot;yojana&quot;&quot;) and &quot;Gandhavati&quot; (&quot;fragrant one&quot;).

Later, King Shantanu, captivated by her fragrance and beauty, fell in love with Satyavati. She married Santanu on her father&#x27;s condition that their children inherit the throne, denying the birthright of Shantanu&#x27;s eldest son (and crown prince) Bhishma. Satyavati bore Shantanu two children, Chitrangada and Vichitravirya. After Shantanu&#x27;s death, she and her sons ruled the kingdom with the help of Bhishma. Although both her sons died childless, she arranged for her eldest son, Vyasa, to father the children of the two widows of Vichitravirya through &quot;niyoga&quot;. The children, Dhritarashtra and Pandu, became the fathers of the Kauravas and Pandavas, respectively. After Pandu&#x27;s death, Satyavati retired to the forest in penance and died there.

While Satyavati&#x27;s presence of mind, far-sightedness and mastery of realpolitik is praised, her unscrupulous means of achieving her goals and her blind ambition are criticised.

==Literary sources and names==
Little is said about Satyavati in the Mahabharata; however, later texts – the Harivamsa and the Devi-Bhagavata Purana – elaborate her legend.

Satyavati is known by numerous names in the Mahabharata, among them Daseyi, Gandhakali, Gandhavati, Kali, Matysyagandha, Satya, Vasavi and Yojanagandha. The name &quot;Daseyi&quot; – a term often used by her stepson Bhishma used to address her – means one of the &quot;Dasa&quot; or &quot;Kaivartta&quot; clan. &quot;Vasavi&quot; means &quot;daughter of king Vasu&quot;. Her birth name, &quot;Kali&quot; indicates her dark complexion. Her other name, Satyavati means &quot;truthful&quot;; &quot;Satya&quot; means &quot;veracity&quot;. As noted above, she was also known as &quot;Matsyagandha&quot; or &quot;Matsyagandhi&quot; in her earlier life – and Gandhakali (lit. fragrant dark one), &quot;Gandhavati&quot;, &quot;Kastu-gandhi&quot; and&quot; &quot;Yojanagandha&quot; in later life.

==Birth and early life==

According to the &quot;Harivamsa&quot;, Satyavati in her previous life was Achchoda, daughter of the Pitrs (ancestors) and cursed to be born on earth. The &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, &quot;Harivamsa&quot; and &quot;Devi Bhagavata Purana&quot; assert that Satyavati was the daughter of a cursed &quot;apsara&quot; (celestial nymph) named Adrika. Adrika was transformed by a curse into a fish and lived in the Yamuna river. According to the legend, Vasu (also known as Uparicara Vasu), a Chedi King, was on a hunting expedition when he had a nocturnal emission while dreaming of his wife. Using an eagle, He sent his semen to his queen but due to fighting mid-air with another eagle, the semen fell into the river and was swallowed by the cursed Adrika-fish. Consequently, the fish became pregnant. Soon, A fisherman caught the pregnant fish and cut it open to find two babies in the womb of the fish, one male and one female. The fisherman presented the children to the king, who kept the male child. The boy grew up to become King Matsya, the founder of the Matsya Kingdom. The king gave the female child back to the fisherman, naming her &quot;Matsya-gandha&quot; (&quot;She who smells like fish&quot;). The fisherman raised the girl as his daughter and named her &quot;Kali&quot; (&quot;the dark one&quot;) because of her complexion. Over the course of time, Kali earned the name &quot;Satyavati&quot; (&quot;truthful&quot;). The fisherman was also a ferryman, ferrying people across the river in his boat. Satyavati helped her father in his job and grew up into a beautiful maiden.

Romila Thapar notes that attempts were made later to suggest that Satyavati was of Kshatriya origin.

==Seduction by Parashara and birth of Vyasa==

The &quot;Devi Bhagavata Purana&quot; narrates that when Satyavati was ferrying the rishi Parashara across the river Yamuna, the sage wanted Satyavati to satisfy his lust and held her right hand. She tried to dissuade Parashara but finally gave in, realizing the desperation and persistence of the sage. Satyavati agreed and told Parashara to be patient until the boat reached the bank. On reaching the other side the sage grabbed her again, but she declared that her body stank and coitus should be pleasurable to them both. At these words, &quot;Matsyagandha&quot; was transformed (by the powers of the sage into &quot;Yojanagandha&quot; (&quot;she whose fragrance can be smelled from across a &quot;yojana&quot;&quot;). She now smelled of musk, and so was called &quot;Kasturi-Gandha&quot; (&quot;musk-fragrant&quot;) and Parashara transformed into fisherman and had intercourse with Satyavati only to return her chastity again. She asked Parashara to promise her that the coitus would be a secret and her virginity intact; the son born from their union would be as famous as the great sage, and her fragrance and youth would be eternal. Parashara granted her these wishes and was satiated by the beautiful Satyavati. After the act, the sage bathed in the river and left, never to meet her again. The Mahabharata abridges the story, noting only two wishes for Satyavati: her &quot;virgo intacta&quot; and everlasting sweet fragrance.

Ecstatic with her blessings, Satyavati gave birth the same day to her baby on an island in the Yamuna. The son immediately grew up as a youth and promised his mother that he would come to her aid every time she called on him; he then left to do penance in the forest. The son was called &quot;Krishna&quot; (&quot;the dark one&quot;) due to his colour, or &quot;Dvaipayana&quot; (&quot;one born on an island&quot;) and would later become known as Vyasa – compiler of the Vedas and author of the &quot;Puranas&quot; and the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, fulfilling Parashara&#x27;s prophecy. After this, Satyavati returned home to help her father.

==Marriage with Shantanu==

One day Shantanu, the Kuru king of Hastinapur, came to the forest on a hunting trip and was mesmerized by the musk-fragrance emanating from Satyavati. Allured by her sweet scent, Shantanu reached Satyavati&#x27;s house and, seeing her, fell in love at first sight. The king asked the fisherman-chief for his daughter&#x27;s hand; the fisherman Dashraj said his daughter would marry the king if – and only if – her sons would inherit the throne.

The king, shocked and dejected, returned to the palace since he had already appointed his son, Devavrata, who was mothered by Goddess Ganga, as heir apparent. Devavrata was distressed by his father&#x27;s condition; he learned about the promise asked by the fisherman-chief from a minister. Immediately, Devavrata rushed to the hut of the fisherman-chief and begged for Satyavati&#x27;s hand on his father&#x27;s behalf. The fisherman repeated his condition and told Devavrata that only Shantanu was worthy of Satyavati; she had rejected marriage proposals from even &quot;Brahmarishis&quot; like Asita.

Devavrata renounced his claim to the throne in favour of Satyavati&#x27;s son, but the fisherman contended that Devavrata&#x27;s children might dispute his grandson&#x27;s claim. Intensely, Devavrata pledged the &quot;terrible&quot; vow of Brahmacharya – celibacy. The fisherman immediately gave Satyavati to Devavrata, who was henceforth called Bhishma (&quot;the One whose vows are terrible&quot;). Bhishma presented Satyavati to Shantanu, who married her.

In the &quot;Devi Bhagavata Purana&quot;, Satyavati&#x27;s premarital first-born, Vyasa, laments that his mother abandoned him to fate immediately after birth. He returns to his birthplace in search of his mother who, he finds out, is now the queen of Hastinapur.

==Birth of children and grandchildren==
After their marriage, Satyavati bore Shantanu two sons: Chitrangada and Vichitravirya. The &quot;Harivamsa&quot; tells of Bhishma recalling events after Shantanu&#x27;s death. During the period of mourning after Shantanu&#x27;s death, Ugrayudha Paurava (usurper of the throne of Panchala) demanded that Bhishma hand over Satyavati in return for wealth. Bhishma killed Ugrayudha Paurava, who had lost his powers because he lusted after another&#x27;s wife. However, the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; does not include this event; it only describes Bhishma crowning Chitrangada as king under Satyavati&#x27;s command. Chitrangada was later killed by a namesake gandharva (a celestial musician).

After Chitrangada&#x27;s death, his young brother Vichitravirya was crowned king, while Bhishma ruled on his behalf (under Satyavati&#x27;s command) until Vichitravirya grew up. Vichitravirya married the princesses of Kashi-Kosala: Ambika and Ambalika, who were won by Bhishma in a &quot;Swayamvara&quot; (marriage choice). The childless Vichitravirya met with an untimely death from tuberculosis.

With no heir to the throne, Satyavati asked Bhishma to marry the widows of Vichitravirya (following the practice of &quot;niyoga&quot; in its narrower sense, as a levirate marriage) and rule as king. Bhishma refused, reminding Satyavati of the promise he made to his father and his vow of bachelorhood. He suggests that a Brahmin could be hired to father children on the widows, thus preserving the dynasty. Revealing to Bhishma the tale of her encounter with Parashara, Satyavati well knew that this was the time to call her son Vyasa to aid her. Satyavati coaxed Vyasa to have &quot;niyoga&quot; with his brother&#x27;s widows, saying: &quot;from affection for thy brother Vichitravirya, for the perpetuation of our dynasty, for the sake of this Bhishma&#x27;s request and my command, for kindness to all creatures, for the protection of the people and from the liberality of thy heart, O sinless one, it behooveth thee to do what I say.&quot; After convincing Vyasa, Satyavati managed (with great difficulty) to obtain the consent of her &quot;virtuous&quot; daughters-in-law. In the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, Vyasa agreed immediately to the &quot;niyoga&quot;. In the &quot;Devi Bhagavata Purana&quot; version, Vyasa initially refused Satyavati&#x27;s proposal. He argued that Vichitravirya&#x27;s wives were like his daughters; having &quot;niyoga&quot; with them was a heinous sin, through which no good could come. As a master of &quot;realpolitik&quot;, the hungry-for-grandsons Satyavati asserted that to preserve the dynasty, wrong directives by elders should be followed if they are going to reduce the sorrow of a mother. Vyasa finally agreed to that &quot;disgusting task&quot;, but suggested that offspring of perversity cannot be a source of joy.

During the fertile period of the older queen, Ambika, Satyavati sent Vyasa to Ambika&#x27;s bedchamber. During coitus with Vyasa, Ambika noticed his dark complexion and closed her eyes. Vyasa declared to Satyavati that due to Ambika&#x27;s cruelty, her son would be blind (but strong) and have a hundred sons – later known as Kauravas (descendants of Kuru). Satyavati considered such an heir to be an unworthy king, so she asked Vyasa to have &quot;niyoga&quot; with her younger daughter-in-law. During their niyoga, Ambalika fell pale due to Vyasa&#x27;s grim appearance. As the result the child would be , Vyasa told his mother, who begged for another child. In due course, the blind Dhritarashtra and the pale Pandu were born. Satyavati again invited Vyasa to Ambika&#x27;s bed-chamber; she remembered Vyasa&#x27;s grim appearance (and repulsive odour), and substituted a Shudra (lowest caste) maid in her place. The maid respected the sage and was not afraid of him, and Vyasa thus blessed her; her son would be the most intelligent man, and she would no longer be a slave. Vyasa told Satyavati of the deception, and then disappeared; Vidura, an incarnation of the god Dharma, was born to the maid.

==Last days==
Consequently, due to Dhritarashtra&#x27;s blindness and Vidura&#x27;s birth from a maid, Pandu was crowned king of Hastinapur. However, he was cursed (by a sage) that he could not bear any children, renounced the kingdom and went to the forest with his wives Kunti and Madri. There, his wives had children – the Pandavas, or &quot;sons of Pandu&quot; – for him through &quot;niyoga&quot; with the gods. Pandu died in the forest; Madri ended her life with her husband. Kunti returned to Hastinapur with the Pandavas. Satyavati was grief-stricken because of her grandson&#x27;s untimely death and did not wish to live any longer. After the funerary rites for Pandu, Vyasa warned Satyavati that happiness would end in the dynasty and devastating events would occur in the future (leading to the destruction of her kin), which she would not be able to bear in her old age. At Vyasa&#x27;s suggestion, Satyavati left for the forest to do penance with her daughters-in-law Ambika and Ambalika. In the forest, she died and attained heaven. Within some days her daughters-in-law died too.

==Assessment==

Dhanalakshmi Ayyer, author of &quot;Satyavati: Blind Ambition&quot;, introduces Satyavati as &quot;the embodiment of the driving force of womanhood, with motherly ambition blinding her vision at every turn&quot; and further says that &quot;[i]n a way, Satyavati exemplifies what Rudyard Kipling succinctly put&quot;:
&lt;poem&gt;The Woman that God gave him, every fibre of her frame
Proves her launched for one sole issue, armed and engined for the same,
And to serve that single issue, lest the generations fail,
The female of the species must be deadlier than the male.&lt;/poem&gt;

For Satyavati the end matters, not the means. Satyavati&#x27;s life goal and ambition was to ensure the succession of Santanu&#x27;s lineage and inheritance of his fortune by her sons but ironically (Ayyer comments), Bhishma – whose right to the throne Satyavati snatches – outlives her children in life and in fame. Her actions (and decisions) create a generation encompassed by a greed which ultimately leads to its annihilation. Ayyer concludes that &quot;Satyavati&#x27;s story teaches the new generation women that determination and commitment are different from avarice and calculation. One should know where greed takes over from ambition.&quot;

Pradip Bhattacharya, author of &quot;Of Kunti and Satyawati: Sexually Assertive Women of the Mahabharata&quot;, praises Satyavati&#x27;s handling of her encounter with the sage Parashara. He notes that although young, she tackles the persistent sage with great maturity and presence of mind. Bhattacharya remarks, &quot;With a maturity and frankness that astonishes us even in the twenty-first century, she points out that coitus ought to be mutually enjoyable.&quot; She is not deluded by the belief that the sage will marry her and asks for virginity to ensure her future status in society. Bhattacharya further comments on the sequence of her requests: the bodily fragrance to make the sexual act pleasant for both, the veil of mist to keep the act a secret, virginal status for her future and fame for her child – securing his fame and after practical aspects are sorted out, &quot;eternally feminine&quot; boons of lifelong youth and fragrance. Bhattacharya says: &quot;Modern-day women could well wish that they were half as confident, clear-headed and assertive of their desires and goals as Satyavati.&quot; He further praises her &quot;characteristic far-sightedness&quot;, when she ensures the future of her children with Santanu by disposing of the crown prince Bhishma. She brings her illegitimate son, Vyasa, onto the scene to father sons with her dead son&#x27;s widows – turning the renowned &quot;lunar dynasty, into the lineage of a &quot;dasa&quot; (slave) maiden&quot;.

<text>Jacques Amyot (; 30 October 15136 February 1593), French Renaissance bishop, scholar, writer and translator, was born of poor parents, at Melun.

==Biography==
Amyot found his way to the University of Paris, where he supported himself by serving some of the richer students. He was nineteen when he became M.A. at Paris, and later he graduated doctor of civil law at Bourges. Through Jacques Colure (or Colin), abbot of St. Ambrose in Bourges, he obtained a tutorship in the family of a secretary of state. By the secretary he was recommended to Margaret of France, Duchess of Berry, and through her influence was made professor of Greek and Latin at Bourges. Here he translated the &quot;Æthiopica&quot; of Heliodorus (1547), for which he was rewarded by Francis I with the abbey of Bellozane.

He was thus enabled to go to Italy to study the Vatican text of Plutarch, on the translation of whose &quot;Lives&quot; he had been some time engaged. On the way he turned aside on a mission to the Council of Trent. Returning home, he was appointed tutor to the sons of Henry II, by one of whom (Charles IX) he was afterwards made grand almoner (1561) and by the other (Henry III) was appointed, in spite of his plebeian origin, commander of the Order of the Holy Spirit.

Pius V promoted him to the bishopric of Auxerre in 1570, and here he continued to live in comparative quiet, repairing his cathedral and perfecting his translations, for the rest of his days, though troubled towards the close by the insubordination and revolts of his clergy. He was a devout and conscientious churchman, and had the courage to stand by his principles. It is said that he advised the chaplain of Henry III to refuse absolution to the king after the murder of the Guise princes. He was, nevertheless, suspected of approving the crime. His house was plundered, and he was compelled to leave Auxerre for some time. He died bequeathing, it is said, 1200 crowns to the hospital at Orléans for the twelve &quot;deniers&quot; he received there when &quot;poor and naked&quot; on his way to Paris.

He translated seven books of Diodorus Siculus (1554), the &quot;Daphnis and Chloë&quot; of Longus (1559) and the &quot;Opera Moralia&quot; of Plutarch (1572). His vigorous and idiomatic version of Plutarch, &quot;Vies des hommes illustres&quot;, was published in 1558, later translated into English by Sir Thomas North, and supplied Shakespeare with materials for his Roman plays. Montaigne said of him, &quot;I give the palm to Jacques Amyot over all our French writers, not only for the simplicity and purity of his language in which he surpasses all others, nor for his constancy to so long an undertaking, nor for his profound learning ... but I am grateful to him especially for his wisdom in choosing so valuable a work.&quot; However, Dr. Guy Patin commented (translation from French), &quot;It is said that M. de Meziriac had corrected eight thousand mistakes in his Amyot, and that Amyot did not have good copies, or that he had not understood Plutarch&#x27;s Greek well.&quot; 

It was indeed to Plutarch that Amyot devoted his attention. His other translations were subsidiary. The version of Diodorus he did not publish, although the manuscript had been discovered by him. Amyot took great pains to find and interpret correctly the best authorities, but the interest of his books today lies in the style. His translation reads like an original work. The personal method of Plutarch appealed to a generation addicted to memoirs and incapable of any general theory of history. Amyot&#x27;s book, therefore, obtained an immense popularity, and exercised great influence over successive generations of French writers.

<text>Sir Thomas North (28 May 1535c. 1604) was an English translator, military officer, lawyer, and justice of the peace. His translation into English of Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Parallel Lives&quot; is notable for being the main source text used by William Shakespeare for his Roman plays.

==Life==
Thomas North was born between 9 and 10 o&#x27;clock at night on Friday, 28 May 1535, in the parish of St Alban, Wood Street, in the City of London. He was the second son of the Edward North, 1st Baron North.

He is supposed to have been a student of Peterhouse, Cambridge, and was entered at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1557. In 1555, during the reign of the Catholic Queen Mary, he travelled in an embassy to Rome with Thomas Thirlby, Bishop of Ely (&quot;c.&quot; 1506-1570); Anthony Browne, Viscount Montague (1552-1592); and Sir Edward Carne (&quot;c.&quot; 1500-1561). Their mission was to reconcile England with the Pope, and North kept a journal of his travels. In 1574 he accompanied his brother, Roger, 2nd Lord North, on a diplomatic mission to the French court in Lyon. He served as captain of a band of footmen in Ireland in 1580, fought with the Earl of Leicester in the Low Countries in 1587, was appointed to defend the Isle of Ely in the year of the Armada, and was knighted in France in October of 1591 by the Earl of Essex, just before the Siege of Rouen. He returned again to help quell Tyrone&#x27;s Rebellion in Ireland in 1596.

His name is on the roll of justices of the peace for Cambridge in 1592 and again in 1597. He was presented with a reward of £25 for his part in putting down Essex&#x27;s Rebellion in 1601, and received a small pension (£40 a year) from Queen Elizabeth that same year.

==Translations==

===Guevara===
He translated, in 1557, Guevara&#x27;s &quot;Reloj de Principes&quot; (commonly known as &quot;Libro áureo&quot;), a compendium of moral counsels chiefly compiled from the &quot;Meditations&quot; of Marcus Aurelius, under the title of &quot;Diall of Princes&quot;. The English of this work is one of the earliest specimens of the ornate, copious and pointed style for which educated young Englishmen had acquired a taste in their Continental travels and studies.

North translated from a French copy of Guevara, but seems to have been well acquainted with the Spanish version. Marcus Aurelius had already been translated by John Bourchier, 2nd Baron Berners, but without reproducing the rhetorical artifices of the original. North&#x27;s version, with its mannerisms and its constant use of antithesis, set the fashion which was to culminate in John Lyly&#x27;s &quot;Euphues&quot;.

===Eastern fables ===
His next work was &quot;The Morall Philosophie of Doni&quot; (1570), a translation of an Italian language version of originally Indian fables, popularly known as &quot;The Fables of Bidpai&quot; which had come to Europe primarily through Arabic translations.

===Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Lives&quot;===
North published his translation of Plutarch in 1580, basing it on the French version by Jacques Amyot. The first edition was dedicated to Queen Elizabeth, and was followed by another edition in 1595, containing fresh &quot;Lives&quot;. A third edition of his Plutarch was published, in 1603, with more translated Parallel Lives, and a supplement of other translated biographies.

North&#x27;s &quot;Plutarch&quot; was reprinted for the &quot;Tudor Translations&quot; (1895), with an introduction by George Wyndham.

According to the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition, &quot;[i]t is almost impossible to overestimate the influence of North&#x27;s vigorous English on contemporary writers, and some critics have called him the first master of English prose&quot;.

===Shakespeare and North===
The &quot;Lives&quot; translation formed the source from which Shakespeare drew the materials for his &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, &quot;Coriolanus&quot;, &quot;Timon of Athens&quot;, and &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;. It is in the last-named play that he follows the &quot;Lives&quot; most closely, whole speeches being taken directly from North. New-found documents, manuscripts, and marginal notes written by Thomas North and other North-family members also indicate that North wrote plays for the Earl of Leicester&#x27;s Men and that Shakespeare adapted some of North&#x27;s plays for the public theatre.

<text>The Spree Forest or Spreewald (; Lower Sorbian: &quot;Błota&quot;, i.e. &#x27;the Swamps&#x27;) is a large inland delta of the river Spree, and a historical cultural landscape located in the region of (Lower) Lusatia, in the state of Brandenburg, Germany, about 100 km southeast of Berlin and close to the city of Cottbus (L.S. Chóśebuz). The Spree Forest is located within the settlement area of the (Lower) Sorbs, and the region is officially bilingual, German and Lower Sorbian.

As extensive floodplain and bog landscape, the Spree Forest was designated a biosphere reserve by UNESCO in 1991, called &quot;Biosphärenreservat Spreewald&quot; (&quot;biosferowy rezerwat Błota&quot;). It is known for its traditional irrigation system, consisting of more than 200 small canals (called &quot;Fließe&quot;; total length: ) within the area, for its unique flora and fauna, and for its traditional flat-bottomed boats, the &quot;Spreewaldkähne&quot;. The landscape was shaped during the last Ice Age.

The region&#x27;s most populous towns are Lübbenau/Spreewald (L.S. Lubnjow/Błota), which is known for the incorporated villages of &quot;Lehde&quot; (Lědy) and &quot;Leipe&quot; (Lipje), the villages with canals instead of streets, and Lübben (Spreewald) (Lubin (Błota)). Other notable towns are Vetschau/Spreewald (Wětošow/Błota) with its reconstructed Old Slavic fortified wooden settlement (gord) &quot;Slawenburg Raddusch&quot; (&quot;Radušańske słowjańske groźišćo&quot;), and Burg (Spreewald) (Bórkowy (Błota)).

==Overview==

About 50,000 people live in the biosphere reserve (1998). Many of them are descendants of the first settlers in the Spree Forest region, the Slavic tribes of the Sorbs and Wends. They have preserved their traditional language, customs and clothing to this day.

Most inhabitants depend on tourism. Many tourists explore the Spree Forest in punts. Agriculture, forestry and fishery are other important sources of income. The principal town of the area is Lübbenau.

The Spree Forest gave its name to the following German districts:
* Dahme-Spreewald
* Oberspreewald-Lausitz

== Landscape and nature ==
Alder forests on wetlands and pine forests on sandy dry areas are characteristic of the Spree Forest region. Grasslands and fields can be found as well. About 18,000 species of flora and fauna have been identified. In 1991, the Spree Forest was designated a UNESCO &quot;&quot;Biosphärenreservat&quot; (Man and Biosphere Reserve Programme)&quot;.

== Economy ==
The Spree Forest is a tourist destination, and a centre of production of natural organic products. The tourism and economic demarcation of the Spree Forest is thus much more difficult than its geographical extension. Due to its popularity and the associated advantage, the borders of the Spree Forest tourism and business area have increasingly extended beyond the original bounds of the Spree Forest. This is particularly true of the regional food industry, as the Spree Forest economic area created for this industry (famed in Germany for the Spreewald gherkin and other pickles) is much larger than the ecological Spree Forest. This economic area is protected by the Protected Geographical Indication scheme of the EU. Before the legal protection of the space there were several court disputes over the designation Spree Forest on food labels.

<doc id="353922" wikidata="Q321197" url="?curid=353922" title="Cieszyn">
<text>Cieszyn ( , ; ; ; ; ) is a border town in southern Poland on the east bank of the Olza River, and the administrative seat of Cieszyn County, Silesian Voivodeship. The town has 33,500 inhabitants ( and lies opposite Český Těšín in the Czech Republic. Both towns belong to the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia, and formerly constituted the capital of the Duchy of Cieszyn as a single town.

==Geography==
The town is situated on the Olza river, a tributary of the Oder River, which forms the border with the Czech Republic. It is located within the western Silesian Foothills north of the Silesian Beskids and Mt. Czantoria Wielka, a popular ski resort. Cieszyn is the heart of the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia, the southeasternmost part of Upper Silesia. Until the end of World War I in 1918 it was a seat of the Dukes of Cieszyn.

In 1920 Cieszyn Silesia was divided between the two newly created states of Poland and Czechoslovakia, with the smaller western suburbs of Cieszyn becoming part of Czechoslovakia as a new town called Český Těšín. The larger part of the town joined Poland as Cieszyn. Three bridges connect the twin towns. After Poland and the Czech Republic joined the European Union and its passport-free Schengen zone, border controls were abolished and residents of both the Polish and Czech part could move freely across the border. The combined population of Polish and Czech parts of the city is 61,201 inhabitants. Cieszyn is the southern terminus of the Polish National road 1 leading to Gdańsk on the Baltic coast.

The town combines both Polish and Old–Austrian peculiarities in the style of its buildings. Because of several major fires and subsequent reconstructions (the last one in the late 18th century), the picturesque old town is sometimes called &quot;Little Vienna&quot;. The only relic of the ancient castle is a square tower, dating from the 14th century and 11th century romanesque chapel.

==History==

The area has been populated by West Slavic peoples since at least the 7th century. According to legend, in 810 three sons of a prince – Bolko, Leszko and Cieszko, met here after a long pilgrimage, found a spring, and decided to found a new settlement. They called it Cieszyn, from the words &quot;cieszym się&quot; (&quot;We&#x27;re happy&quot;). This well can be found at &quot;ulica Trzech Braci&quot; (&quot;Three Brothers Street&quot;), just west of the town square.

The area became part of the emerging Polish state in the 10th century. The town was the capital of the Duchy of Cieszyn, established during the fragmentation of Poland into smaller duchies, since 1290, which was ruled by Piast dynasty until 1653 and by the Habsburg Dynasty of Austria until 1918. It was in Teschen that Maria Theresa and Frederick II on in May 1779 signed the Teschen Peace Treaty, which put an end to the War of the Bavarian Succession. In the 19th century Teschen was known for its ethnic, religious and cultural diversity, containing mostly German, Polish, Jewish and Czech communities. There was also a small Vlach community and a Hungarian community in the town consisting mostly of officers and clerks.

The town was divided in July 1920, by the Spa Conference, a body formed by the Versailles Treaty, leaving a Polish minority on the Czechoslovak side. Its smaller western suburbs became what is now the town of Český Těšín in the Czech Republic. During the interwar period two villages were merged into Cieszyn: Błogocice in 1923 and Bobrek in 1932. After 1920 many ethnic Germans left the town, while many Poles from the Czechoslovakian part of the region moved in. According to the Polish census of 1921, Cieszyn had 15,268 inhabitants, of whom 9,241 (60.5%) were Poles, 4,777 (31.2%) were Germans, 1014 (6.6%) were Jews, and 195 (1.3%) were Czechs. The census from 1931 indicated 14,707 inhabitants, of whom 12,145 (82.7%) were Poles, while the rest consisted mostly of Germans and Jews (in 1937 estimated to be 12 and 8% respectively).

Cieszyn and Český Těšín were merged again in October 1938 when Poland annexed the Trans-Olza area together with Český Těšín. Following the joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II in September 1939, Cieszyn was occupied by Germany until 1945. In 1939–1940, the Germans carried out mass arrests of local Poles during the genocidal &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot; campaign, and then imprisoned them in a newly established Nazi prison in the town. Many Polish teachers, school principals, priests and activists were deported to concentration camps and murdered there. The Nazi prison had two forced labour subcamps in the town, and two more in nearby Karviná and Konská. The Germans also established a camp for children up to the age of 2-3, where they were beaten, tortured and subjected to medical experiments. Almost the entire Jewish community was murdered by the Nazis.

After World War II, the border between Poland and Czechoslovakia was restored to that of 1920. Most Germans fled or were expelled in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement and were replaced with Poles expelled from the Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union. Signs of the former German presence in the town were removed by a special committee.

On 19 July 1970, five firefighters from Cieszyn died when a bridge they were on fell into the Olza River, due to heavy flooding. In 1977, Boguszowice, Gułdowy, Kalembice, Krasna, Mnisztwo, Pastwiska were amalgamated with Cieszyn and Marklowice.

==Culture==
Since the 18th century Cieszyn Silesia has been an important centre of Polish Protestantism when the Jesus Church was built as the only one in Upper Silesia. Currently, Cieszyn is also the site of the Cieszyn Summer Film Festival, one of the most influential film festivals in Poland. There is also an earlier established Czech-Polish-Slovak film festival.

==Industry==
Cieszyn is an important centre of the electromechanical industry. It is also the site of the &quot;Olza Cieszyn&quot; sweets factory (where the famous Prince Polo wafers are made) and the Brackie Browar, where Żywiec Porter is brewed. The main source of income for many citizens is trade with the nearby Czech Republic and retail trade associated with transit across the two bridges over the Olza to Český Těšín. In the past, the city was home to many furniture factories.

<doc id="353923" wikidata="Q1648561" url="?curid=353923" title="Kaurava">
<text>Kaurava is a Sanskrit term which refers to descendants of Kuru, a legendary king of India who is the ancestor of many of the characters of the epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. Usually, the term is used for the 100 sons of King Dhritarashtra and his wife Gandhari. Duryodhana, Dushasana, Vikarna and Chitrasena are the most popular among the brothers. They also had a sister named Dussala and a half-brother named Yuyutsu. 

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;Kauravas&quot; is used in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; with two meanings ,
*The wider meaning is used to represent all the descendants of Kuru. This meaning, which includes the Pandava brothers, is often used in the earlier parts of popular renditions of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;.
*The narrower but more common meaning is used to represent the elder line of the descendants of Kuru. This restricts it to the children of King Dhritarashtra, excluding the children of his younger brother, Pandu, whose children form the Pandava line.

The rest of this article deals with the Kaurava in the narrower sense, that is, the children of Dhritarashtra Gandhari. When referring to these children, a more specific term is also used – (Sanskrit: धार्तराष्ट्र), a derivative of Dhritarashtra.

==Birth of Kauravas==

After Gandhari was married to Dhritarashtra, she wrapped a cloth over her eyes and vowed to share the darkness that her husband lived in. Once Sage Krishna Dwaipayana Vyasa came to visit Gandhari in Hastinapur and she took great care of the comforts of the great saint and saw that he had a pleasant stay in Hastinapur. The saint was pleased with Gandhari and granted her a boon. Gandhari wished for one hundred sons who would be as powerful as her husband. Dwaipayan Vyasa granted her the boon and in due course of time, Gandhari found herself to be pregnant. But two years passed and still, the baby was not born. Meanwhile, Kunti received a son from Yama whom she called Yudhishthira. After two years of pregnancy, Gandhari gave birth to a hard piece of lifeless flesh that was not a baby at all. Gandhari was devastated as she had expected a hundred sons according to the blessing of Rishi Vyasa. She was about to throw away the piece of flesh while Rishi Vyasa appeared and told her that his blessings could not have been in vain and asked Gandhari to arrange for one hundred jars to be filled with ghee. He told Gandhari that he would cut the piece of flesh into a hundred pieces and place them in the jars, which would then develop into the one hundred sons that she so desired. Gandhari told Vyasa then that she also wanted to have a daughter. Vyasa agreed, cut the piece of flesh into one hundred and one-pieces, and placed them each into a jar. After two more years of patient waiting the jars were ready to be opened and were kept in a cave. Bhima was born on the same day on which Duryodhana was born thus making them of the same age. Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva were born after Duryodhana was born.

==Children of Dhritarashtra==
The children of Dhritarashtra by Gandhari are also referred by a more specific and frequently encountered term - , a derivative of (Dhritarashtra).

According to the epic, Gandhari wanted a hundred sons and Vyasa granted her a boon that she would have these. Another version says that she was unable to have any children for a long time and she eventually became pregnant but did not deliver for two years, after which she gave birth to a lump of flesh. Vyasa cut this lump into a hundred and one-pieces and these eventually developed into a hundred boys and one girl.

The birth of these children is relevant to the dispute over the succession of the kingdom&#x27;s throne. It attributes the late birth of Duryodhana, the eldest son of Dhritarashtra, despite his father&#x27;s early marriage and legitimizes the case for his cousin Yudhishthira to claim the throne, since he could claim to be the eldest of his generation. All the sons of Dhritarashtra (excluding Yuyutsu) were killed in the Battle of Kurukshetra.

==Marriages and children of Kauravas==
All the 100 Kauravas were mentioned to have wives in the Adi Parva. Some of them had children - Duryodhana was mentioned to have a Kalinga princess as his wife. They had three children: a son Lakshmana Kumara and two daughters named Lakshmana and one unnamed daughter. Lakshmana Kumara participated in the Kurukshetra War and injured Shikhandi&#x27;s son Kshatradeva on the 12th day of the war. He is killed by Abhimanyu on the 13th day of the war.

Lakshmana was said to have married Krishna&#x27;s son Samba. Dushasana was also said to have two sons, who killed Abhimanyu in the war. Dushasana&#x27;s first son was killed by Shrutasena in the war. Dushasana&#x27;s second son was killed by him also. Dushasana also had an unnamed daughter. 

Chitrasena&#x27;s son was said to have been killed by Shrutakarma in the Kurukshetra War. Chitrasena also had an unnamed daughter. 

However, it was mentioned that all these sons of the Kauravas were killed by the sons of the Pandavas, many of whom met their end to Bhima.

==In literature==
Harivamsa Purana (8th century CE) narrates the Jain version of their story.

== In popular culture ==
The term Kaurava is used as the name of a fictional planetary system in the 2008 real-time strategy video game &quot;Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War – Soulstorm&quot;, as well as the names of the system&#x27;s planets.

<doc id="353929" wikidata="Q317784" url="?curid=353929" title="Jermaine Jackson">
<text>Jermaine LaJuane Jacksun (né Jackson; born December 11, 1954) is an American singer, songwriter and bassist. He is known for being a member of the Jackson family. From 1964 to 1975, Jermaine was second vocalist after his brother Michael of the Jackson 5, and played bass guitar. In 1983, he rejoined the group, which had been renamed the Jacksons; he then consistently played in the group&#x27;s performances and recordings until he left the group again in 2020.

While Jermaine did not usually sing the lead vocal on the Jackson Five&#x27;s biggest hits, he is featured on &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There&quot; and &quot;I Want You Back&quot;, among others. When four of the brothers left Motown Records for Epic Records in 1976 (having to rename the family act The Jacksons in the process), Jermaine, who had just married Motown founder Berry Gordy&#x27;s daughter Hazel, stayed at Motown. He was replaced in The Jacksons by his youngest brother, Randy. Jermaine had a solo career concurrent with his brother Michael&#x27;s, including some top-30 hits, until the 1980s. He produced and recorded duets with Whitney Houston on her debut album in 1973, and was a producer for the band Switch. After seven years outside the group he rejoined the Jacksons, and remained until 2020 through various breakups and reunions.

==Early life==
Jermaine was born December 11, 1954, at St Mary&#x27;s Mercy Hospital in Gary, Indiana, He is the fourth child born to Joseph and Katherine Jackson. His siblings are Rebbie, Jackie, Tito, La Toya, Marlon, Brandon (Marlon&#x27;s twin who died shortly after birth in 1957), Michael, Randy, and Janet. Jackson&#x27;s father Joe had musical aspirations, playing guitar with his brother Luther in an R&amp;B band, the Falcons, and his mother Katherine, a devout Jehovah&#x27;s Witness, was a passionate pianist and singer. Their large family and limited means made them refocus, with Katherine becoming a housewife, and Joe a steel mill worker at nearby Inland Steel Company in East Chicago, Indiana, where they lived before moving to Gary in 1950.

While his father, Joe, worked long hours as a crane operator, Jermaine and his brothers, Tito and Jackie, secretly practiced their own songs using Joe&#x27;s guitar, and they sang harmonies with their mother Katherine. Jermaine became the original lead singer, and also played the bass in the Jackson Brothers, an earlier incarnation of the Jackson 5 until 1966, when younger brother Michael began singing lead. Father Joe began rehearsing his sons under a strict regimen when he realized their potential, seeing his sons&#x27; talent as a way out of Gary. Jermaine would continue to provide some leads over the years. Jermaine graduated from Birmingham High School in Van Nuys, Los Angeles, California, in 1973.

==Career==

===The Jackson 5===

Jermaine and his brothers first signed as the Jackson 5 with Gordon Keith of Steeltown Records in November 1967, and their first single &quot;Big Boy&quot;, was released on January 31, 1968. After the group recorded three more songs with the Steeltown label (on two records) they were signed with Berry Gordy of Motown Records in 1969. As the third lead singer of the Jackson 5 after his brothers Jackie and Michael, Jermaine sang notable parts of &quot;I Want You Back&quot;, &quot;ABC&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There&quot;, &quot;The Love You Save&quot;, &quot;Dancing Machine&quot; and many other Jackson 5 songs. Jermaine performed as part of the group for six years. Not feeling that they were being paid fair royalties by Motown Records for their success as well as their desire for creative control, the Jackson 5 decided to leave the label and sign with Epic Records in 1975. However, Jermaine decided to stay with Motown Records, citing loyalty to the company as the reason. Others argue that Jermaine&#x27;s marriage to Motown founder Berry Gordy&#x27;s daughter Hazel, whom he married in 1973, was a deciding factor.

Jermaine split from the Jackson Five to start a solo career at Motown, and was replaced by his brother Randy. Unbeknownst to the group, Gordy had trademarked the name Jackson Five and did not allow the group to continue using the name when they left the label. Once signed with Epic, the group became known simply as the Jacksons. In 1983, Gordy asked the group to perform at the &quot;Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever&quot; television special. After the success of the broadcast, Jermaine finally rejoined the band to record the album &quot;Victory&quot; which featured all six brothers on the Jackson&#x27;s album cover. Jermaine also participated in the band&#x27;s Victory Tour. He stayed with the group for their final album, &quot;2300 Jackson Street&quot;, in 1989. Jermaine performed the song &quot;If You&#x27;d Only Believe&quot; on March 15, 1993, with his brothers Jackie, Tito and Randy, on the stage of the Grand Théâtre de Genève for the evening of the Nations. He also performed this song alone, on January 14, 1990, in Atlanta, in tribute to Martin Luther King Jr., during King Week 90 &#x27;. In 1997, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with the Jackson 5. In 2001, he reunited with his brothers to perform for the Michael Jackson 30th Anniversary Special.

===Solo career===
Like Michael, Jermaine began a solo career while still a member of the Jackson 5, and had a hit with the 1972 Shep and the Limelites cover &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Home&quot;. It sold over one million copies by March 1973, and was awarded a gold disc. When the Jackson 5 left Motown in 1975, Jermaine left the group and stayed at the label until 1983, when he finally rejoined his brothers for the &quot;Motown 25&quot; television special, and their album &quot;Victory&quot; the following year. Jermaine was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance for his 1980 album &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Serious&quot;. He had a number of &quot;Billboard&quot; top-30 hits throughout the 1970s and 1980s, including &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Home&quot; (No. 9), &quot;That&#x27;s How Love Goes&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Be Young Tonight&quot;, &quot;Bass Odyssey&quot;, &quot;Feel the Fire&quot;, &quot;Let Me Tickle Your Fancy&quot; (featuring Devo on backing vocals) (No. 18), &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Serious&quot; (No. 9, also one of his only two UK hits, peaking at No. 8), &quot;Dynamite&quot; (No. 15), &quot;Do What You Do&quot; (No. 13), and &quot;I Think It&#x27;s Love&quot; (No. 16). A duet with his brother Michael, &quot;Tell Me I&#x27;m Not Dreamin&#x27; (Too Good to Be True)&quot;, hit number one on the dance chart in 1984. Michael and he also collaborated with Rockwell, both providing guest vocals on his 1984 hit single, &quot;Somebody&#x27;s Watching Me&quot;.

In 1985, his duet with Pia Zadora, &quot;When the Rain Begins to Fall&quot;, topped several singles charts in Europe, including Germany and France; in the United States, the duet only reached number 54 on the Billboard charts. His final chart success, 1989&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Take It Personal&quot;, hit number one on the R&amp;B singles chart. Some of Jermaine&#x27;s finest moments as a singer can be heard in the soulful &quot;Castles of Sand&quot; and the Earth Wind &amp; Fire-inspired &quot;You Need to Be Loved&quot;. Jermaine was the executive producer of the Jackson Family Honors concert televised from the MGM Grand on February 22, 1994. On May 19, 2003, he performed &quot;Let&#x27;s Start Right Now&quot; live on the talk show &quot;The View&quot;, hosted by Barbara Walters.

Jackson is proficient on the electric guitar and is a talented bass guitar player. At an early age, he performed the parts of legendary bass player James Jamerson and others when the Five performed live. His main instrument was a Gibson EB-3. Jermaine also composed and produced for other artists, such as Switch and he produced and sang duets on Whitney Houston&#x27;s debut album for Arista Records. Jackson is featured on the Switch track &quot;Tahiti Hut&quot; released in 2019, recorded during the &quot;Reaching for Tomorrow&quot; sessions.

===Reality television===
Jackson was the first housemate to enter the &quot;Celebrity Big Brother 5&quot; house in 2007, which he placed 2nd. After leaving &quot;Big Brother&quot;, Jackson did several interviews on UK television explaining why and how he took his peaceful and mediating stance in the &quot;Big Brother&quot; house. He also spoke about the Jackson Five reuniting for a performance. Jackson was part of the second season of the CMT reality show &quot;Gone Country&quot;. On the premiere episode of season three of the ABC reality show &quot;Celebrity Wife Swap&quot; on April 15, 2014, Jackson and his wife Halima swapped places with Daniel Baldwin and his on-again, off-again girlfriend Isabella Hofmann.

===Later work===

In April 2007, Jackson returned to the UK to take part in a one-off special of ITV&#x27;s &quot;Challenge Anneka&quot;. On the same trip, he appeared in Glasgow with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, speaking in support of &quot;Searchlight&quot; magazine&#x27;s anti racism campaign, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; &quot;Hope Not Hate Bus&quot;.

On November 23, 2007, Jackson appeared on &quot;Katie &amp; Peter: Unleashed&quot; and again talked of a reunion with his brothers on a tour the following year. In 2008, Jackson flew to Australia to be a guest judge and mentor for the top-five Michael Jackson night on &quot;Australian Idol&quot;. In March 2008, Jackson was the guest of honor at the Muslim Writers Awards in Birmingham. In 2009, following his brother Michael&#x27;s passing, Jermaine appeared on the A&amp;E television series &quot;The Jacksons: A Family Dynasty&quot;, documenting what was supposed to be a 40th-anniversary reunion between Jermaine and his brothers. The series lasted one season and Jermaine, along with his three brothers, was listed as an executive producer. In October 2010, Jermaine played a concert at the Planet Hollywood hotel and casino in Las Vegas, naming it &quot;40 Years of Jackson Music&quot; and dedicating the concert to Michael. He wrote the memoir &quot;You Are Not Alone: Michael Through a Brother&#x27;s Eyes&quot; (2011).

In a 2012 interview with Luka Neskovic, for &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;, Jackson said that his brother planned a reunion with him: &quot;... the plan was to do some shows with the brothers, as well, after he finished his commitment with the This Is It [concert], and we probably gonna do some songs with him on the This Is It tour&quot;. In October 2012, Jackson released &quot;I Wish You Love&quot;, his first solo album in 21 years, consisting mostly of jazz covers. The album was arranged and produced by French opera singer David Serero, who recorded a duet on &quot;Autumn Leaves&quot; with Jermaine, and was released by David Serero Productions. They both performed &quot;You Are Not Alone: The Musical&quot;, written, directed and produced by Serero, in France in January 2013. The following year, &quot;You Are Not Alone: The Musical Live&quot; was released on video and audio.

==Personal life==
===Family===
Jackson has been married and divorced three times, and has seven children. His first marriage was to Hazel Gordy, the daughter of Motown founder Berry Gordy. The couple were married from 1973 to 1988. They had three children; Jermaine La Jaune &quot;Jay&quot; Jackson Jr. (born 1977), Autumn Joi Jackson (born 1978) and Jaimy Jermaine Jackson (born 1987). Jackson was in a relationship with Margaret Maldonado from 1986 until 1993. They had two sons, Jeremy Maldonado Jackson (born 1986) and Jourdynn Michael Jackson (born 1989). He began a relationship with Alejandra Loaiza, former girlfriend of his brother, Randy, they were married from 1995 to 2003. They had two sons, Jaafar Jeremiah Jackson (born 1996) and Jermajesty Jermaine Jackson (born 2000).

In 2004, Jackson married Halima Rashid in a mosque in Los Angeles. Rashid was arrested in 2015 in Los Angeles for alleged domestic violence. She filed a petition for divorce in 2016, citing irreconcilable differences.

Jermaine supported his brother, Michael, during his 2005 trial. He came to Michael&#x27;s defense on CNN&#x27;s &quot;Larry King Live&quot; and appeared with him in court on many occasions. Jermaine announced his brothers&#x27;s death on 25 June 2009 at a press conference at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center.

Jermaine is a supporter of the English football team Sheffield Wednesday.

===Michael&#x27;s memorial===
Jermaine thanked the people that attended Michael Jackson&#x27;s memorial at the Staples Center, on July 7, 2009. &quot;As you know,&quot; he said, &quot;I am lost for words. I had his back. So did the family. But we thank you. That&#x27;s all I can say. We thank you very much.&quot; Jermaine also tossed a rose on Michael&#x27;s casket, after he sang &quot;Smile&quot; by Charlie Chaplin, which Michael also had covered and released. In honor of Michael, Jermaine and his brothers, Tito, Jackie, Marlon and Randy Jackson served as pallbearers wearing a gold necktie, a single white glove and sunglasses.

On January 30, 2019, Jermaine spoke out about the allegations against his brother, &quot;Michael was tried by a jury of his peers and he was acquitted.&quot; he said. He added: &quot;There was no real evidence, and I will say this—our family are tired. Let this man rest. He did a lot for the world. There is no truth to this. We&#x27;re living in a time where people can say anything and it&#x27;s taken as truth.&quot; BBC News reported.

===Conversion to Islam===
Jackson, like the rest of his family, was raised as a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness. In 1989, he converted to Islam after a trip to Bahrain, in which he was impressed by the local children&#x27;s devotion to their religion.

Jermaine claimed in an interview that if his brother Michael had converted to Islam, it would have saved his life.

===Sexual assault lawsuit===
On December 27, 2023, a lawsuit was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court by a woman who alleged Jackson sexually assaulted her after forcing himself into her home in 1988. The woman, identified as Rita Barrett, also alleged Motown Records owner Berry Gordy assisted in covering up the abuse.

<text>In religious organizations, the laity () consists of all members who are not part of the clergy, usually including any non-ordained members of religious orders, e.g. a nun or a lay brother. In both religious and wider secular usage, a layperson (also layman or laywoman) is a person who is not qualified in a given profession or does not have specific knowledge of a certain subject. The phrase &quot;layman&#x27;s terms&quot; is used to refer to plain language that is understandable to the everyday person, as opposed to specialised terminology understood only by a professional.

Terms such as &quot;lay priest&quot;, &quot;lay clergy&quot; and &quot;lay nun&quot; were once used in certain Buddhist cultures, especially Japanese, to indicate ordained persons who continued to live in the wider community instead of retiring to a monastery. Some Christian churches utilise lay preachers, who preach but are not clergy. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints uses the term &quot;lay priesthood&quot; to emphasise that its local congregational leaders are unpaid.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;laity&quot; means &quot;common people&quot; and comes from the , meaning &quot;of the people&quot;, from , &quot;laos&quot;, meaning &quot;people&quot; at large. The word &quot;lay&quot; (part of &quot;layperson&quot;, etc.) derives from the Greek word via Anglo-French &quot;lai&quot;, from Late Latin &quot;laicus&quot;.

==Christian laity==

In many Christian denominations, including the Catholic and the Anglican churches, anyone who is not ordained as a deacon, priest, or bishop is referred to as a layman or a laywoman. Non-ordained preachers or readers are considered part of the laity.

===Catholic Church===

The Second Vatican Council (1962–1965) devoted its decree on the apostolate of the laity &quot;Apostolicam actuositatem&quot; and chapter IV of its dogmatic constitution &quot;Lumen gentium&quot; to the laity in a sense narrower than that which is normal in the Catholic Church. The normal definition of laity is that given in the Code of Canon Law:
The narrower sense in which the Second Vatican Council gave instruction concerning the laity is as follows: 
In this narrower sense, the Council taught that the laity&#x27;s specific character is secularity: they are Christians who live the life of Christ in the world. Their role is to sanctify the created world by directing it to become more Christian in its structures and systems: &quot;the laity, by their very vocation, seek the kingdom of God by engaging in temporal affairs and by ordering them according to the plan of God&quot;. The laity are full members of the Church, fully share in Church&#x27;s purpose of sanctification, of &quot;inner union of men with God&quot;, acting with freedom and personal responsibility and not as mere agents of the hierarchy. Due to their baptism, they are members of God&#x27;s family, the Church, and they grow in intimate union with God, &quot;in&quot; and &quot;by means&quot; of the world. It is not a matter of departing from the world as the monks and the nuns do that they sanctify themselves; it is precisely through the material world sanctified by the coming of the God made flesh, i.e. made material, that they reach God. Doctors, mothers of a family, farmers, bank tellers, drivers, by doing their jobs in the world with a Christian spirit are already extending the Kingdom of God. According to the repeated statements of Popes and lay Catholic leaders, the laity should say &quot;we are the Church,&quot; in the same way that the saints said that &quot;Christ lives in me.&quot;

Lay involvement takes diverse forms, including participation in the life of the parish, confraternities, lay apostolates, secular institutes, and lay ecclesial movements. There are also lay ecclesiastical ministries, and where there is a priest shortage, lay people have to take on some functions previously performed by priests.

====Vatican II afterwards====
In December 1977, &quot;A Chicago Declaration of Christian Concern&quot; was published. The declaration looked back a decade to the Vatican Council II with appreciation for its &quot;compelling vision of lay Christians in society.&quot; As the Declaration interpreted it, the Council viewed the laity&#x27;s &quot;special vocation&quot; as being the &quot;leaven&quot; for the &quot;sanctification of the world&quot; in their &quot;secular professions and occupations&quot;. However, lamented the Declaration, the council&#x27;s vision has &quot;all but vanished&quot; from the church.

The Declaration was signed by forty-seven clergy, religious, and laity that included men and women in many occupations, and it served as the charter for the National Center for the Laity (NCL). The NCL helps lay Catholics respond to their call to change the world through their daily activities and regular responsibilities, and it publishes a monthly online newsletter &quot;Initiatives: In Support of Christians in the World.&quot;

&quot;Initiatives: In Support of Christians in the World&quot; (January 2015) rejoiced that &quot;50 Years since Vatican II&quot; the increased lay ministry in parishes has &quot;brought fresh vitality&quot;. However, the newsletter lamented &quot;the neglect of formation for the lay apostolate in the world&quot;.

Pope Francis is quoted as confirming this lament. Priests tend to &quot;clericalize the laity&quot; and view their ministry as only &quot;within the Church,&quot; discounting their &quot;workaday&quot; ministry. From the start of his papacy Francis called for structural change in the Church which will foster the responsibility of the laity now held &quot;at the edge of the decisions&quot; by  &quot;excessive clericalism&quot;, and to &quot;create still broader opportunities for a more incisive female presence in the Church&quot;. The &quot;missionary transformation of the Church&quot; is seen by some as &quot;the goal of this pontificate&quot;, with all the baptized becoming &quot;missionary disciples&quot;,

===Orthodox===
The Orthodox Church in America&#x27;s web site has eleven articles regarding its Theology of Lay Ministries. The term &quot;lay ministries&quot; refers to all the &quot;people of God&quot; (from the Greek &quot;laos tou Theou&quot;) including the ordained. Thus, every Christian has a vocation to ministry. A minority are called to ecclesiastical ministries. The majority are called to serve God and their fellow human beings in some way in the &quot;everyday secular world&quot;.

The Orthodox Church&#x27;s assertion that all Christians are &quot;appointed&quot; as ministers is based on Scripture (1 Peter 2:9) and the Church Fathers. The ministry of the laity complements the ministry of the priest in their daily lives in their families, their communities, their work: &quot;in whatever circumstances they find themselves&quot;. The most important &quot;lay ministry&quot; can be done anonymously. What one&#x27;s ministry is depends on the abilities of the person: &quot;landscaping, carpentry, writing, counseling, child care, sports, music, teaching, or just being a good listener&quot;.

The relation within the laity as the &quot;people of God&quot; between those who are ordained priests and those not ordained is one of cooperation in three areas: (1) in the Liturgy, (2) Church administration, and (3) service (ministry) to others.

In spite of the church&#x27;s teaching about the ministry of the laity in the world, the church gives more recognition to ministry within the institutional church. The &quot;daily ministry&quot; of the laity in their work, in their homes, and in their recreation remains hidden. Priests may intend to support their parishioners&#x27; daily ministry, but their priority tends to be recruiting volunteers for the church&#x27;s programs.

===Protestantism===

====Anglicanism====
In the Anglican tradition, all baptized persons are expected to minister in Christ&#x27;s name. The orders of ministry are thus laypersons, licensed lay ministers (or readers), deacons, priests, and bishops.
The ministry of the laity is &quot;to represent Christ and his Church; to bear witness to him wherever they may be; and, according to the gifts given them, to carry on Christ&#x27;s work of reconciliation in the world; and to take their place in the life, worship, and governance of the Church&quot;. Much of the ministry of the laity thus takes place outside official church structures in homes, workplaces, schools, and elsewhere. It is &quot;through their continuous participation in political, economic, educational, and kinship institutions&quot; that the laity &quot;powerfully influence the character of these institutions&quot;.

Laymen also play important roles in the structures of the church. There are elected lay representatives on the various governing bodies of churches in the Anglican communion. In the Church of England, these governing bodies range from a local parochial church council, through Deanery Synods and Diocesan Synods. At the topmost level, the General Synod includes a house of Laity. Likewise, in the Episcopal Church in the USA, the General Convention includes four lay persons from each diocese in the House of Deputies, and each diocesan convention includes lay delegates from the parishes. On the local parish level, lay persons are elected to a church council called a vestry which manages church finances and elects the parish rector.

Parish musicians, bookkeepers, administrative assistants, sextons, sacristans, etc., are all roles normally filled by lay persons. At higher levels, diocesan and national offices rely on lay persons in many important areas of responsibility. Often specialized ministries as campus ministers, youth ministers, or hospital chaplains are performed by lay persons.

Lay persons serve in worship services in a number of important positions, including vergers, acolytes, lectors, intercessors, ushers. Acolytes include torch bearers, crucifers, thurifers, and boat bearers. Lectors read the lessons from the Bible appointed for the day (except for the Gospel reading, which is read by a Deacon), and may also lead the Prayers of the People.

Some specialized lay ministries require special licensing by the bishop: the ministries which require a license vary from province to province. In the Episcopal Church, there are six specialized lay ministries requiring a license: Pastoral Leader, Worship Leader, Preacher, Eucharistic Minister, Eucharistic Visitor, and Catechist.

====Methodism====
=====Lay ministry=====
An early tradition of preaching in the Methodist churches was for a lay preacher to be appointed to lead services of worship and preach in a group (called a circuit) of preaching houses or churches. The lay preacher walked or rode on horseback in a prescribed circuit of the preaching places according to an agreed pattern and timing, and people came to the meetings. After the appointment of ministers and pastors, this lay preaching tradition continued with local preachers being appointed by individual churches, and in turn approved and invited by nearby churches, as an adjunct to the minister or during their planned absences.

The United Methodist Church recognizes two types of lay ministries. One is a &quot;lay servant ministry&quot; of (a) assisting or leading local church meetings and worship or of (b) serving as lay missioners to begin new work within the church that requires special training. The other type is the &quot;ministry of the laity&quot; in their daily lives.

In addition to being appointed by members of their local churches, local and certified lay speakers of the United Methodist Church (more commonly in the United States) attend a series of training sessions. These training sessions prepare the individual to become a leader within the church. All individuals who are full members of the church are laity, but some go on to become Lay Speakers. Some preachers get their start as Lay Speakers.

Local preachers lead the majority of church services in the Methodist Church of Great Britain. The comparable term in the Anglican and Episcopal churches is &quot;lay reader&quot;. In the Uniting Church in Australia, that was constituted in part from the Methodist Church, persons can be appointed by the congregation as a lay preacher or by the regional presbytery to preside at Communion.

=====Ministry of the laity=====
The Methodist &quot;Book of Discipline&quot; describes the &quot;Ministry of the Laity&quot; in their daily lives as being &quot;Christ-like examples of everyday living&quot; and &quot;sharing their own faith experiences&quot;.

=====Worship leader=====
In the Methodist Church of Great Britain, a &quot;worship leader&quot; is a trained lay person appointed by a Church Council to &quot;take a leading and significant role in the conduct of worship within the life of a Local Church&quot;.

====Presbyterianism====
Presbyterians do not use the term &quot;lay&quot;. Thus the Church of Scotland has &quot;Readers&quot;, men and women set apart by presbyteries to conduct public worship. This arises out of the belief in the priesthood of all believers. Ministers are officially &#x27;teaching elders&#x27; alongside the &#x27;ruling elders&#x27; of the Kirk Session and have equivalent status, regardless of any other office. In the Church of Scotland, as the Established church in Scotland, this gives ruling elders in congregations the same status as Queen&#x27;s chaplains, professors of theology and other highly qualified ministers. All are humble servants of the people in the congregation and parish.
Ministers are simply men and women whose gift is for their role in teaching and possibly pastoral work. They are thus selected for advanced theological education. All elders (teaching and ruling) in meetings of Session, Presbytery, or Assembly are subject to the Moderator, who may or may not be a minister but is always an elder.

===The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===

Many leaders in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are lay ministers. Essentially all male members above the age of 12 who are judged by church leaders to be in good standing are ordained to an office of the priesthood and hold various positions in the church. Most church positions at the local level are unpaid, but the LDS church helps with the living expenses of top church leaders and some others (e.g. mission presidents). Many top church leaders serve in these positions after long secular careers. With the exception of members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, the First Quorum of the Seventy who are at the top of the church hierarchy, and patriarchs, all leadership positions are temporary.

==Lay Buddhists==

In Buddhism, a lay Buddhist is known as an &quot;upasakā&quot; (masc.) or &quot;upasikā&quot; (fem.). Buddhist laypeople take refuge in the Triple Gem the Buddha, Dhamma (His Teachings), and Sangha (His community of Noble Disciples) and accept the Five Precepts (or the Eight Precepts during Uposatha Days) as discipline for ethical conduct. Laymen and laywomen are two of the &quot;Four-fold Assembly&quot;. The Buddha referred to his disciples as the &quot;Four-fold Assembly&quot; – the gatherings of &#x27;bhikkhū&#x27; (monks), &#x27;bhikkhunī&#x27; (nuns), &#x27;upasakā&#x27; (laymen), and &#x27;upasikā&#x27; (laywomen). In the Mahāparinibbāna Sutta, the Buddha famously said that &quot;He would not pass away until the &quot;Four-fold Assembly&quot; is well-established in the learning and practice of Dhamma, and proficient in propagating His Sublime Teachings.&quot;

==Faith at work==

The movement to help laity apply their faith to daily life has been divided into three eras by David W. Miller in &quot;God at Work&quot;.
:* The Social Gospel Era (c. 1890s—1945)
:* The Ministry of the Laity Era (c.1946—1985)
:* The Faith at Work Era (c. 1985—Present)

===Social Gospel===
The Social Gospel sought to reform society by the application of biblical principles. Its major proponents were all clergy: Washington Gladden, Charles Monroe Sheldon, and Walter Rauschenbusch. They were better in diagnosing society&#x27;s ills than finding remedies. The Social Gospel reached its peak just prior to World War I, a war that contradicted its optimism about Christianizing society.

The Social Gospel was promulgated by the preaching, writing, and other efforts of clergy on behalf of the laity rather than by the laity themselves. In the early 1930s, the Social Gospel was described as &quot;a preacher&#x27;s gospel. It has not been the church&#x27;s gospel. The laity have little share in it.&quot; Many were not aware what their clergy believed.

Most scholars hold that the Social Gospel movement peaked between 1900 and World War I. There is less agreement about when and why the decline happened.

===Ministry of the Laity===
The Ministry of the Laity in daily life premise was stated by Howard Grimes in his &quot;The Rebirth of the Laity&quot;.
&quot;Although it is not alone through our daily work that we exercise our call, there is a special sense in which we do so in that area, since so much of our lives are spent in our occupations as lawyer, doctor, manual laborer, skilled craftsmen, housewife, domestic servant, student, serviceman.&quot;

In 1988, Dean Reber of the Auburn Theological Seminary wrote a retrospective of the Ministry of the Laity era based on research and survey. His research participants were women and men in equal numbers, aged 20 to 60, from six denominations. Reber found that &quot;all were really interested to link faith with their daily life and work&quot;. However, in his survey, Reber found that little had been done in the six denominations to enable laity to make this link. He observed a &quot;preoccupation with activities inside the church&quot;, as well as a lack of literature and programs on the subject. For these reasons, attempts to link faith and daily life &quot;fizzled out&quot;.

For Miller, &quot;hindsight suggests that the institutional church and its leaders never fully embraced or understood lay ministry&quot;. Therefore, they stopped promoting the &quot;ministry of the laity&quot; concept to their members.

===Faith at Work===
Miller deems &quot;Faith at Work&quot; to be &quot;a bona fide social movement and here to stay&quot;. Unlike earlier movements, business people (from evangelical and mainline Protestant denominations, Roman Catholics, Jews, Buddhists, and unaffiliated) initiated the faith at work movement and support it because they want to connect their work and their faith. Management training often includes a faith dimension.

Examples of various kinds of faith at work initiatives follow:

* The Theology of Work Project is an independent international organization that produces materials for &quot;workplace Christians&quot; to teach them what the Bible and the Christian faith can contribute to ordinary work.
* The National Center for the Laity (NCL) grew out of the 1977 &quot;A Chicago Declaration of Christian Concern.&quot; It propagates the Second Vatican Council&#x27;s teaching about laity&#x27;s vocation as &quot;daily work&quot;. The NCL&#x27;s primary voice is &quot;Initiatives: In Support of Christians in the World&quot;. In its January 2015 issue, &quot;Initiatives&quot; listed worldwide initiatives taken by laity in connecting faith and work.
* C12 Group offers training laced with Christian principles for CEO/Owners by monthly all-day meetings led by former CEOs. In its name, &quot;C&quot; stands for Christ, &quot;12&quot; stands for its ideal training group size. Group membership costs up to $1,450 per month. Some 1,500 Christian CEO/Owners belong to C12.
* Denver Institute for Faith &amp; Work is a regional, nonprofit organization dedicated to forming men and women to serve God, neighbor and society through their daily work.
* The Princeton University Faith &amp; Work Initiative develops resources regarding ethics and vocation at work. It disseminates its learnings by programs for students, academics, and leaders in the marketplace.
* The Industrial Christian Fellowship helps its &quot;members and others to live out their faith at their work&quot; by research and publications.
* The Christian Association of Business Executives (CABE) &quot;exists to Inform, Inspire and Influence Christian business people from all church backgrounds and all types of business, as they seek to live out their faith day to day.&quot;

===Workplace as a mission field===
Some faith at work initiatives focus not on work itself but on the workplace as a &quot;mission field&quot;. In this &quot;business as missions&quot; concept, faith at work means &quot;reaching people for Christ in the marketplace&quot;, people that career missionaries could not reach. For example, Member Mission &quot;teaches the baptized to see themselves as missionaries out in the world in each of their daily places&quot;.

<doc id="353934" wikidata="Q60351" url="?curid=353934" title="Sebastian Brant">
<text>Sebastian Brant (also Brandt) (1457/1458 – 10 May 1521) was a German humanist and satirist. He is best known for his satire &quot;Das Narrenschiff&quot; (&quot;The Ship of Fools&quot;).

==Early life and education==
Brant was born in either 1457 or 1458 in Strasbourg to innkeeper Diebold Brant and Barbara Brant (née Rickler). He entered the University of Basel in October 1475 and as an assistant to Jacobus Hugonius he did not pay the matriculation. For five years he lived in the dorm of magister Hieronymus Berlin, initially studying philosophy and then transferring to the school of law. Latin he was taught by Johann Matthias von Gengenbach who also lectured philosophy at the Faculty of Philosophy. Initially studying at the Faculty of Philosophy he later studied law. It is assumed he began his law studies in 1476, as his bachelor is already mentioned in the winter of 1477-1478 and in 1484 Brant obtained a licentiate. In 1483 he began teaching at the university and completed his doctorate in law in 1489. He graduated in both canon and civil law. 

== Professional career ==
Brant first attracted attention in humanistic circles by his Neo-Latin poetry but, realising that this gave him only a limited audience, he began translating his own work and the Latin poems of others into German, publishing them through the press of his friend , from which appeared his best known German work, the satirical &quot;Das Narrenschiff&quot; (Ship of Fools, 1494), the popularity and influence of which were not limited to Germany. In this allegory, the author lashes the weaknesses and vices of his time. It is an episodic work in which a ship laden with and steered by fools goes to the fools&#x27; paradise of Narragonia. Here he conceives Saint Grobian, whom he imagines to be the patron saint of vulgar and coarse people. He was employed by the printer Johann Amerbach with whom he collaborated in the publications of the works of christian fathers Augustine&#x27;s and Ambrose. In jurisprudence, he also worked on the &quot;Corpus Juridici canonici,&quot; which Amerbach was to print jointly with Johannes Froben in 1500. He was very close with several printers of Basel. Between 1488 and 1501 it is known he worked on ninety-five books and it is assumed he worked on several more. Among others, forty-one were published by Johann Bergmann von Olpe, seventeen by Johann Amerbach and twenty-four by Michael Furter. Most of Brant&#x27;s important writing, including many works on civil and canon law, were written while he was living in Basel. Other sources mention Brant&#x27;s involvement in about a third of all books published in Basel the late 1500s, but this number is disputed. 

He returned to Strasbourg, where he was made syndic in August 1500 and remained for the rest of his life. He assumed the office of the syndic in January 1501. In 1502 Maximilian I nominated him an Imperial Councilor. He would also earn the title of a Count Palatine and later be a judge for the Imperial Court in Speyer. In 1503 he secured the influential position of chancellor (&quot;stadtschreiber&quot;) and his engagement in public affairs prevented him from pursuing a literature career as before. Brant was a catholic, but he remained tolerant to the protestants, who were allowed to preach in the market square and publish books during his tenure as a chancellor. In Strasbourg his literary work included a translation into German of the Hortulus Animae in 1501/1502, a Vergil edition in 1503 and he also prepared an edition of Petrarcas &quot;&quot;Glücksbuch&quot;&quot; for 1520. 

Brant made several petitions to the Emperor Maximilian to drive back the Turks in order to save the West. In the same spirit, he had sung the praises of Ferdinand II of Aragon in 1492 for having conquered the Moors and unified Spain. A staunch proponent of German cultural nationalism, he believed that moral reform was necessary for the security of the Empire against the Ottoman threat.

Although essentially conservative in his religious views, Brant&#x27;s eyes were open to abuses in the church. He published the &quot;Narrenschiff&quot; in 1494, printed by Michael Furter. Alexander Barclay&#x27;s &quot;Ship of Fools&quot; (1509) is a free imitation into early Tudor period English of the German poem, and a Latin version by Jakob Locher (1497) was hardly less popular than the original. &quot;Cock Lorell&#x27;s Bote&quot; (printed by Wynkyn de Worde, c. 1510) was a shorter imitation of the &quot;Narrenschiff&quot;. In this work Cock Lorell, a notorious fraudulent tinker of the period, gathers round him a rascally collection of tradesmen and sets off to sail through England. 

Among Brant&#x27;s many other works was his compilation of fables and other popular stories, published in 1501 under the title &quot;Aesopi Appologi sive Mythologi cum quibusdam Carminum et Fabularum additionibus&quot;, the beauty of whose production is still appreciated. Though based on Heinrich Steinhöwel&#x27;s 1476 edition of Aesop, the Latin prose was emended by Brant, who also added verse commentaries with his characteristic combination of wit and style. The second part of the work is entirely new, consisting of riddles, additional fables culled from varied sources, and accounts of miracles and wonders of nature both from his own times and reaching back to antiquity.

The letters by Brant that have survived show that he was in correspondence with Peter Schott, Johann Bergmann von Olpe, Emperor Maximilian, Thomas Murner, Konrad Peutinger, Willibald Pirckheimer, Johannes Reuchlin, Beatus Rhenanus, Jakob Wimpfeling and Ulrich Zasius.

== Personal life ==
In 1485 he had married Elisabeth Bürg, the daughter of a cutler in the town. Brant was the father of seven children. Two of the godfathers to the children were Johann Amerbach and Johann Froben. Keen for his eldest son Onophrius to become a humanist, he taught him Latin in the cradle and enrolled him in the university at the age of seven. Onophrius was to study law with Ulrich Zasius in Freiburg. Later he would be employed in the public service in Strasbourg. His daughter Anna was married to Paul Butz, Sebastian Brants successor. He at times signed as Titio, a rarely used Latin term for firebrand, mostly when it rhymed. Johannes Trithemius seemed to be more fond of the name than Brant himself, though.

<doc id="353938" wikidata="Q753930" url="?curid=353938" title="Ridgefield, Connecticut">
<text>Ridgefield is a town in Fairfield County, Connecticut, United States. Situated in the foothills of the Berkshire Mountains and on the New York state border, Ridgefield had a population of 25,033 as of the 2020 census. The town is part of the Western Connecticut Planning Region. The town center, which was formerly a borough, is defined by the U.S. Census Bureau as a census-designated place. The town was settled then quickly incorporated by 1709.

==History==
Ridgefield was first settled by English colonists from Norwalk in 1708, when a group of settlers purchased land from Chief Catoonah of the Ramapo tribe. The town was incorporated under a royal charter from the Connecticut General Assembly issued in 1709. Ridgefield was descriptively named. The most notable 18th-century event was the Battle of Ridgefield on April 27, 1777. This American Revolutionary War skirmish involved a small colonial militia force (state militia and some Continental Army soldiers), led by, among others, General David Wooster, who died in the engagement, and Benedict Arnold, whose horse was shot from under him. They faced a larger British force that had landed at Westport and was returning from a raid on the colonial supply depot in Danbury. The battle was a tactical victory for the British but a strategic one for the Colonials because the British would never again conduct inland operations in Connecticut, despite western Connecticut&#x27;s strategic importance in securing the Hudson River Valley. Today, the dead from both sides are buried together in a small cemetery on Main Street on the right of the entrance to Casagmo condominiums: &quot;...foes in arms, brothers in death...&quot;. The Keeler Tavern, a local inn and museum, features a British cannonball still lodged in the side of the building. There are many other landmarks from the Revolutionary War in the town, with most along Main Street.

In the summer of 1781, the French army under the Comte de Rochambeau marched through Connecticut, encamping in the Ridgebury section of town, where the first Catholic mass in Ridgefield was offered.

For much of its three centuries, Ridgefield was a farming community. Among the important families in the 19th century were the Rockwells and Lounsburys, which intermarried. They produced two Connecticut governors, brothers and business partners George Lounsbury and Phineas Lounsbury. The Ridgefield Veterans Memorial Community Center on Main Street, also called the Lounsbury House, was built by Gov. Phineas Chapman Lounsbury around 1896 as his primary residence. The Lounsbury Farm near the Florida section of Ridgefield is one of the only remaining operational farms in Ridgefield.

In the late 19th century, spurred by the new railroad connection to its lofty village and the fact that nearby countryside reaches above sea level, Ridgefield began to be discovered by wealthy New York City residents, who assembled large estates and built huge &quot;summer cottages&quot; throughout the higher sections of town. Among the more noteworthy estates were Col. Louis D. Conley&#x27;s &quot;Outpost Farm&quot;, which at one point totaled nearly , some of which is now Bennett&#x27;s Pond State Park; Seth Low Pierrepont&#x27;s &quot;Twixthills&quot;, more than , much of which is now Pierrepont State Park; Frederic E. Lewis&#x27;s &quot;Upagenstit&quot;, that became Grey Court College in the 1940s, but is now mostly subdivisions; and Col. Edward M. Knox&#x27;s &quot;Downesbury Manor&quot;, whose included a 45-room mansion that Mark Twain often visited.

These and dozens of other estates became unaffordable and unwieldy during and after the Great Depression, and most were broken up. Many mansions were razed. In their place came subdivisions of one- and lots that turned the town into a suburban, bedroom community in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. However, strict planning and zoning has frozen development and locked in the aesthetic appearance of the 19th- and early 20th-century through to the 21st-century, especially along its famous mile-long Main Street.

In 1946, Ridgefield was one of the locations considered for the United Nations Secretariat building, but was not chosen due to its relative inaccessibility.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.52%, is water. Ridgefield is bordered by the towns of North Salem and Lewisboro in Westchester County, New York and the town of Southeast in Putnam County, New York to the west, Danbury to the north, Wilton to the south and Redding to the east.

The Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Branchville station is in the Branchville corner of town. The census-designated place (CDP) corresponding to the town center covers a total area of , of which 0.16% is water. Other locales within the town include Titicus on Route 116 just north of the village; Ridgebury in the northern section of town; Scotland, which is south of Ridgebury; Farmingville, located northeast and east of the town center; Limestone, located northeast of the town center; Flat Rock, located south of the town center; and Florida, located just north of Branchville.

=== Geology ===

Ridgefield consists of hilly, rocky terrain, ranging from above sea level (at Pine Mountain) to at Branchville. Its average village elevation is above sea level. The landscape is strewn with countless rocks deposited by glaciers, and among the town&#x27;s bodies of water is Round Pond, formed in a kettle left by the last glacier 20,000 years ago. Another interesting body of water in the town is Mamanasco Lake, an lake near Ridgefield High School. A particularly interesting feature is Cameron&#x27;s Line, named for Eugene N. Cameron, who discovered that rocks west of the line differed greatly from those east of it. This fault line was formed some 250 million years ago by the collision of &quot;Proto North America&quot; and &quot;Proto Africa&quot;, and there are still occasional light earthquakes felt along its length. The line bisects the southern half of the town, running generally north of West Lane, across the north end of the village, past the south end of Great Swamp and generally easterly into Redding in the Topstone area. North of Cameron&#x27;s Line, the town is rich in limestone. The mineral was extensively mined, and remnants of several limekilns exist today. Also mined here in the 19th century was mica, pegmatite, and quartz. Gold, as well as gemstones such as garnet and beryl, have been found here, and dozens of minerals have been unearthed at the old Branchville Mica Quarry. Uraninite, a source of uranium, is found here, too.

It became fully professional by the end of the decade and today has 75 musicians and draws soloists of international reputation. In 1984, Maxim Shostakovich, then a Ridgefielder, conducted a sold-out concert of music by his father, Dmitri Shostakovich, with the composer&#x27;s grandson, Dmitri, performing as piano soloist.

The Keeler Tavern Museum preserves an early 18th-century house that, by the time of the Revolution, had become a tavern and inn. The tavern was a center of community activities, an early post office, and a stop on the northern New York to Boston post road. In the early 20th century, it was the home of noted architect Cass Gilbert. The tavern is open several days a week, offers tours, and has a gift shop.

It is the year-round venue for dozens of concerts and other performances, many by internationally known artists. The Playhouse also shows movies, many of them first-run.

Weir Farm National Historic Site, which straddles the Ridgefield-Wilton border, preserves much of the farm of J. Alden Weir (1852–1919), a painter of the American Impressionism style. The property was later used by his son-in-law, Mahonri Young (1877–1957), noted sculptor and a grandson of Brigham Young. The site includes the Weir Farm Art Center and a gallery, and many special events take place there, including shows by visiting artists in residence. Weir Farm is one of only two official National Park Service units in the state.

The Ridgefield Conservatory of Dance was founded as the Ridgefield Studio of Classical Ballet in 1965 by Patricia Schuster. In 2002 it became the Ridgefield Conservatory of Dance, a non-profit 501(c)3 organization. The Conservatory is home to three pre-professional performance companies: the Ridgefield Civic Ballet, The Junior Dance Ensemble, and the Contemporary Dance Ensemble. The conservatory presents &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; annually at the Ridgefield Playhouse.

<doc id="353939" wikidata="Q1973947" url="?curid=353939" title="Shantanu">
<text>Shantanu (, ) was the King of Kuru Kingdom with his capital at Hastinapura, in the epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. He was a descendant of the Bharata race, a forebear of the lineage of the Chandravamsha, the father of Bhishma and the great-grandfather of the Pandavas and the Kauravas. 

The ruler was the youngest son of King Pratipa of Hastinapura and had been born during the latter&#x27;s latter years. His eldest brother, Devapi, had leprosy, and had given up his inheritance to become a hermit. The middle son, Bahlika, (or Vahlika) abandoned his paternal kingdom, and had started living with his maternal uncle in Balkh, subsequently inheriting his kingdom. Shantanu, thus, ascended the throne of Hastinapura.

==Etymology==

The meaning of the name can be explained by nirukti available in Adi Parva, through which Sri Nityānanda Miśra elaborates its meaning as &quot;the one who amplifies sukha (happiness) for others&quot;. Monier-Williams translates &quot;śaṁ-tanu&quot; as &quot;wholesome for the body&quot;.

The Sambhava Parva of Mahabharata says that the old men of his kingdom who were touched by this monarch not only felt an indescribable sensation of pleasure but also became restored to youth. Therefore, this monarch was called Santanu.

==Brahma&#x27;s curse and the birth of Shantanu==

In his previous birth, there was a powerful king of the Ikshvaku dynasty named Mahabhisha. He possessed many virtuous qualities, and after performing a thousand Ashvamedha Yagnas and a hundred Rajasuya Yagnas (to qualify as emperor), he had attained heaven after his death. Once, he got an opportunity to visit the court of Brahma where all the Devas and the Ganga were also present. While the celestials were worshipping Brahma, a wind blew and displaced Ganga&#x27;s clothes revealing her body. Everybody present there bent their heads except Mahabhisha who kept gazing at her. Upon seeing this act, Brahma lost his temper and cursed him to be born a mortal. Ganga who also relished the mortal act was cursed to be born as human and come back only after breaking Mahabhisha&#x27;s heart. Mahabhisha then requested Brahma that he, Mahabhisha, be born as the son of Kuru king Pratipa and his wish was granted by Brahma.

The Kuru king Pratipa was once meditating. At that time Ganga took the form of a beautiful woman, approached the king and sat on his right thigh. When he asked her what she wanted, Ganga requested him to become her husband. Pratipa however refused since he had taken a vow not to lust for anybody, and also that she had sat on his right thigh and according to traditions a man&#x27;s right thigh was for his daughter or daughter-in-law while the left thigh was for his wife. He then proposed that she marry his son, to which she agreed.

A child was born to Pratipa and his wife Sunanda in their old age. He was named Shantanu because when he was born his father had controlled his passions by ascetic penances. Pratipa then installed Shantanu as king of Hastinapura and retired into the woods to perform penances. Bahlika who was elder than Shantanu also gave permission to him for becoming the king of Hastinapura.

==Marriage with Ganga==

Shantanu saw a beautiful woman on the banks of the river Ganga and asked her to marry him. She agreed but with one condition: that Shantanu would never ask any questions about her actions. They married and later she gave birth to a son. But she drowned the child. Shantanu could not ask her the reason, because of his promise, lest she would leave him. One by one, seven sons were born and drowned by Ganga.

When Ganga was about to drown the eighth son, Shantanu, devastated, could not restrain himself and confronted her. Finally, Ganga explained to King Shantanu about Brahma&#x27;s curse given to Mahabhisha and her. Then she told him that their eight children were Eight Vasu&#x27;s who were cursed by Vasishtha to be born on earth as mortal humans. However, when they pacified him, he limited his curse and told them that they would be freed from this curse upon their birth as humans. So she released the seven of them from human life by drowning them all. However, the Vasu Dyaus was cursed to live a long life and not to have a wife or have children. But the sage Vashishtha also gave a boon to him that he would be virtuous, conversant with all the holy scriptures and will be an obedient son to his father. Ganga said she would take him to train him properly for the King&#x27;s throne and status. With these words, she disappeared along with the child while Shantanu was struck with grief thinking about spending the rest of his life without her.

==Reunion with his son==
Shantanu, filled with grief from the loss of his wife and son, began to practise Brahmacharya and ruled his kingdom extremely well. By merely adopting virtuous behaviour, Shantanu was easily able to conquer the entire world without lifting weapons. All the kings declared Shantanu as Emperor and his reign was a peaceful one. Shantanu gave up hunting and gained popularity from his subjects.

One day, while walking along the banks of the Ganga, Shantanu saw that the river had become shallow. While searching for the cause of this phenomenon, he came across a handsome young boy who had checked the river&#x27;s flow with his celestial weapon. The young boy was his son, however, he did not recognize him because he could see him only for a few moments after he was born. The boy recognized that he was his father; however, he did not reveal it to him. Instead he disappeared from his sight using his power of illusion. Shantanu upon seeing this wondered whether the boy was actually his son and called upon Ganga to show the boy to him. Ganga having thus appeared revealed to him that the boy was actually his son Devavrata and that he was taught the knowledge of the holy scriptures by the sage Vasishtha and the art of warfare by Parshurama. After revealing the truth about Devavrata she told Shantanu to take him to Hastinapura. Upon reaching the capital Shantanu crowned Devavrata as the heir-apparent to the throne.

Although Shantanu was pained from his separation from Ganga, he was overjoyed upon receiving such an accomplished son. He performed seven Ashvamedha Yagnas on the banks of Yamuna with the help of Devavrata.

==Marriage with Satyavati==

Four years later, Shantanu while travelling near the banks of Yamuna smelled a sweet scent coming from an unknown direction. While searching for the cause of the scent, he came across Satyavati from whom the smell of scent was coming. Satyavati was an adopted daughter of the chief of the fishermen of her village. Upon seeing her, Shantanu fell in love with her and desired to marry her. Upon asking for his consent, her father agreed to the marriage on the condition that Satyavati&#x27;s son would inherit the throne of Hastinapura.

King Shantanu was unable to give his word on accession as his eldest son Devavrata was the heir to the throne and was forlorn. Devavrata, however, realised the cause of his sorrow and for the sake of his father, gave his word to the chief that he would renounce all his claims to the throne, in favour of Satyavati&#x27;s children. To reassure the skeptical chief further, he also vowed lifelong celibacy to ensure that future generations borne of Satyavati would also not be challenged by his offspring. Upon hearing this vow he immediately agreed to the marriage of Satyavati and Shantanu. Devavrata was named as Bhishma (one who has taken a terrible vow) by the celestials because of the terrible oath he took. Devavrata returned to Hastinapura with Satyavati, and marriage of Shantanu and Satyavati happens. But eventually Shantanu knows about his son&#x27;s vow. Upon hearing about this, Shantanu at first was heartbroken, but later became highly impressed with his son&#x27;s love and affection and gave him a boon that he will only die if he wants to. Shantanu and Satyavati went on to have two sons, Chitrāngada and Vichitravirya. After Shantanu&#x27;s death, Chitrangada became king of Hastinapur.

<text>Friedrich Karl Theodor Zarncke (7 July 182515 October 1891), German philologist, was born in Zahrensdorf, Mecklenburg-Schwerin, the son of a country pastor.

He was educated at the Rostock gymnasium, and studied (1844–1847) at the universities of Rostock, Leipzig and Berlin. In 1848 he was employed in arranging the valuable library of Old German literature of Freiherr Karl Hartwig von Meusebach (1781–1847), and superintending its removal from Baumgartenbrück, near Potsdam, to the Royal Library at Berlin.

In 1850 he founded the &quot;Literarisches Centralblatt für Deutschland&quot; in Leipzig. In 1852 he established himself as &quot;privatdozent&quot; at Leipzig University. In 1858 he was appointed full professor.

==Works==
He published an edition of Sebastian Brant&#x27;s &quot;Narrenschiff&quot; (1854), a treatise &quot;Zur Nibelungenfrage&quot; (1854), followed by an edition of the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; (1856, 12th ed. 1887), and &quot;Beiträge zur Erläuterung und Geschichte des Nibelungenliedes&quot; (1857). He wrote a series of noteworthy studies on medieval literature, most of which were published in the reports (&quot;Berichte&quot;) of the Saxon Society of Sciences. Among them were those on

*the Old High German poem &quot;Muspilli&quot; (1866)
*&quot;Gesang vom heiligen Georg&quot; (1874)
*the legend of the &quot;Priester Johannes&quot; (1874)

<doc id="353942" wikidata="Q2382217" url="?curid=353942" title="Desegregation busing">
<text>Desegregation busing (also known simply as busing or integrated busing or forced busing) was an attempt to diversify the racial make-up of schools in the United States by sending students to school districts other than their own. While the 1954 U.S. Supreme Court landmark decision in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; declared racial segregation in public schools unconstitutional, many American schools continued to remain largely racially homogeneous. In an effort to address the ongoing &quot;de facto&quot; segregation in schools, the 1971 Supreme Court decision, &quot;Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education&quot;, ruled that the federal courts could use busing as a further integration tool to achieve racial balance.

Busing met considerable opposition from both white and black people. The policy may have contributed to the movement of large numbers of white families to suburbs of large cities, a phenomenon known as white flight, which further reduced the effectiveness of the policy. Many whites who stayed moved their children into private or parochial schools; these effects combined to make many urban school districts predominantly non-white, reducing any effectiveness mandatory busing may have had.

== History ==

=== Before World War II ===
Prior to World War II, most public schools in the country were &quot;de jure&quot; or &quot;de facto&quot; segregated. All Southern states had Jim Crow Laws mandating racial segregation of schools. Northern states and some border states were primarily white (in 1940, the populations of Detroit and Chicago were more than 90% white) and existing black populations were concentrated in urban ghettos partly as the result of restrictive covenants.

=== After World War II ===
The origins of desegregation busing can be traced back to two major developments that occurred in the United States during the 1940s and 1950s.

==== Black population shift ====
Starting in 1940, the Second Great Migration brought five million blacks from the agrarian South to the urban and manufacturing centers in Northern and Western cities to fill in the labor shortages during the industrial buildup of World War II and for better opportunities during the post-war economic boom. &quot;Shelley v. Kraemer&quot; (1948) allowed them to settle in formerly white neighborhoods, contributing to racial tension. Meanwhile, the post-war housing boom and the rise of suburbia allowed whites to migrate into the suburbs. By 1960, all major Northern and Western cities had sizable black populations (e.g., 23% in Chicago, 29% in Detroit, and 32% in Los Angeles). Blacks tended to be concentrated in inner cities, whereas newer suburbs of most cities were almost exclusively white.

==== Legal rulings ====

At the same time, the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (1954) overturned racial segregation laws for public schools that had been in place in a number of states, since the late 19th century, and ruled that separate but equal schools were &quot;inherently unequal&quot;. Although the &quot;Brown&quot; decision affirmed principles of equality and justice, it did not specify how its ruling would promote equality in education. Thurgood Marshall and the NAACP wanted a speedy process for desegregating the school districts, but the Court waited until the following year to make its recommendations. Reasons for delaying had to do with the changes in the Court and with Chief Justice Earl Warren steering a careful course given the expected opposition from Southern states. In May 1955, the Court ruled in &quot;Brown II&quot; that the school districts desegregate &quot;with all deliberate speed&quot;. Public school administrators had to begin the process of desegregating the schools through the development of policies that would promote racial mixing. A backlash of resistance and violence ensued. Even members of Congress refused to abide by the decision. In 1956 over a hundred congressmen signed the Southern Manifesto, promising to use all legal means to undermine and reverse the Court&#x27;s ruling.

The momentum continued with two additional Supreme Court decisions aimed at implementation. In 1968, the Warren Court in &quot;Green v. County School Board of New Kent County&quot;, rejected a freedom of choice plan. The Court ordered the county to desegregate immediately and eliminate racial discrimination &quot;root and branch&quot;. Then in 1971, the Burger Court in &quot;Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education&quot; ruled that the school district must achieve racial balance even if it meant redrawing school boundaries and the use of busing as a legal tool. The impact of &quot;Green&quot; and &quot;Swann&quot; served to end all remnants of &quot;de jure&quot; segregation in the South. However, the consequence of the &quot;Swann&quot; decision ushered in new forms of resistance in subsequent decades. The decision failed to address &quot;de facto&quot; segregation.

Consequently, despite being found &quot;inherently unequal&quot; in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, by the late 1960s public schools remained &quot;de facto&quot; segregated in many cities because of demographic patterns, school district lines being intentionally drawn to segregate the schools racially, and, in some cases, due to conscious efforts to send black children to inferior schools. Thus, for example, by 1969, more than nine of every ten black students in Nashville still attended all-black schools. Evidence of such de facto segregation motivated early proponents of plans to engage in conscious &quot;integration&quot; of public schools, by busing schoolchildren to schools other than their neighborhood schools, with an objective to equalize racial imbalances. Proponents of such plans argued that with the schools integrated, minority students would have equal access to equipment, facilities, and resources that the cities&#x27; white students had, thus giving all students in the city equal educational opportunities.

A federal court found that in Boston, schools were constructed and school district lines drawn intentionally to segregate the schools racially. In the early 1970s, a series of court decisions found that the racially imbalanced schools trampled the rights of minority students. As a remedy, courts ordered the racial integration of school districts within individual cities, sometimes requiring the racial composition of each individual school in the district to reflect the composition of the district as a whole. This was generally achieved by transporting children by school bus to a school in a different area of the district.

The judge who instituted the Detroit busing plan said that busing &quot;is a considerably safer, more reliable, healthful and efficient means of getting children to school than either carpools or walking, and this is especially true for younger children&quot;. He, therefore, included kindergarten children in the busing scheme: &quot;Transportation of kindergarten children for upwards of forty-five minutes, one-way, does not appear unreasonable, harmful, or unsafe in any way.&quot; (Some research has shown however the deleterious effects of long bus rides on student health and academic achievement ). The resultant Supreme Court case, &quot;Milliken v. Bradley&quot; (1974), imposed limits on busing. The key issue was whether a district court could order a metropolitan-wide desegregation plan between urban Detroit and suburban school districts. Busing would play a key role in the implementation phase. The Court essentially declared that federal courts did not have the authority to order inter-district desegregation unless it could be proven that suburban school districts intentionally mandated segregation policies. The implication of the decision was that suburban school districts in the North were not affected by the principles established by &quot;Brown&quot;. &quot;De facto&quot; segregation was allowed to persist in the North. The courts could order desegregation where segregation patterns existed, but only within municipalities, not suburban areas. The lasting consequence of the &quot;Milliken&quot; decision is that it opened the door for whites to flee to the suburbs and not be concerned about compliance with mandatory integration policies.

With waning public support, the courts began relaxing judicial supervision of school districts during the 1990s and 2000s, calling for voluntary efforts to achieve racial balance.

In the early 1990s, the Rehnquist Court ruled in three cases coming from Oklahoma City (in 1991), DeKalb County in Georgia (in 1992), and Kansas City (in 1995) that federal judges could ease their supervision of school districts &quot;once legally enforced segregation had been eliminated to the extent practicable&quot;. With these decisions, the Rehnquist Court opened the door for school districts throughout the country to get away from judicial supervision once they had achieved unitary status. Unitary Status meant that a school district had successfully eliminated segregation in dual school systems and thus was no longer bound to court-ordered desegregation policies.

Then in 2002, the Supreme Court declined to review a lower court decision in &quot;Belk v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education&quot; which declared that the school system had achieved desegregation status and that the method to achieve integration, like busing, was unnecessary. The refusal of the Court to hear the challenges to the lower court decision effectively overturned the earlier 1971 &quot;Swann&quot; ruling.

Finally, in 2007, the Roberts Court produced a contentious 5–4 ruling in &quot;Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1&quot; (PICS). The decision prohibited the use of racial classifications in student assignment plans to maintain racial balance. Whereas the Brown case ruled that racial segregation violated the Constitution, now the use of racial classifications violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. Writing for the minority, Justice Breyer said the &quot;ruling contradicted previous decisions upholding race-conscious pupil assignments and would hamper local school boards&#x27; efforts to prevent &#x27;resegregation&#x27; in individual schools&quot;.

=== Civil rights movement ===

The struggle to desegregate the schools received impetus from the Civil Rights Movement, whose goal was to end legal segregation in all public places. The movement&#x27;s efforts culminated in Congress passing the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Civil Rights Act of 1968. Signed by President Lyndon Johnson, the three laws were intended to end discriminatory voting practices and segregation of public accommodations and housing. The importance of these three laws was the injection of both the legislative and executive branches joining the judiciary to promote racial integration. In addition, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 authorized the federal government to cut off funding if Southern school districts did not comply and also to bring lawsuits against school officials who resisted.

One argument against the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that opponents of the proposed legislation found particularly compelling was that the bill would require forced busing to achieve certain racial quotas in schools. Proponents of the bill, such as Emanuel Celler and Jacob Javits, said that the bill would not authorize such measures. Leading sponsor Sen. Hubert Humphrey wrote two amendments specifically designed to outlaw busing. Humphrey said &quot;if the bill were to compel it, it would be a violation [of the Constitution], because it would be handling the matter on the basis of race and we would be transporting children because of race&quot;. While Javits said any government official who sought to use the bill for busing purposes &quot;would be making a fool of himself&quot;, two years later the Department of Health, Education and Welfare said that Southern school districts would be required to meet mathematical ratios of students by busing.

=== Sociological study ===
Another catalyst for the development of busing was an influential sociological report on educational equality commissioned by the U.S. government in the 1960s. It was one of the largest studies in history, with more than 150,000 students in the sample. The result was a massive report of over 700 pages. That 1966 report—titled &quot;Equality of Educational Opportunity&quot; (or often simply called the &quot;Coleman Report&quot; after its author James Coleman)—contained many controversial findings. One conclusion from the study was that, while black schools in the South were not significantly underfunded as compared to white schools, and while per-pupil funding did not contribute significantly to differences in educational outcomes, socially disadvantaged black children still benefited significantly from learning in mixed-race classrooms. Thus, it was argued that busing (as opposed to simply increasing funding to segregated schools) was necessary for achieving racial equality.

=== Reaction ===
==== Before 2007 ====
The impact of the &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; ruling was limited because whites and blacks tended to live in all-white or all-black communities. Initial integration in the South tended to be symbolic: for example, the integration of Clinton High School, the first public school in Tennessee to be integrated, amounted to the admission of twelve black students to a formerly all-white school.

&quot;Forced busing&quot; was a term used by many to describe the mandates that generally came from the courts. Court-ordered busing to achieve school desegregation was used mainly in large, ethnically segregated school systems, including Boston, Massachusetts; Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio; Kansas City, Missouri; Pasadena and San Francisco, California; Richmond, Virginia; Detroit, Michigan; and Wilmington, Delaware. From 1972 to 1980, despite busing, the percentage of blacks attending mostly-minority schools barely changed, moving from 63.6 percent to 63.3 percent. Forced busing was implemented starting in the 1971 school year, and from 1970 to 1980 the percentage of blacks attending mostly-minority schools decreased from 66.9 percent to 62.9 percent. The South saw the largest percentage change from 1968 to 1980 with a 23.8 percent decrease in blacks attending mostly-minority schools and a 54.8 percent decrease in blacks attending 90%–100% minority schools.

In some southern states in the 1960s and 1970s, parents opposed to busing created new private schools. The schools, called segregation academies, were sometimes organized with the support of the local White Citizen&#x27;s Council.

For the 1975–76 school year, the Louisville, Kentucky school district, which was not integrated due to whites largely moving to the suburbs, was forced to start a busing program. The first day, 1,000 protestors rallied against the busing, and a few days into the process, 8,000 to 10,000 whites from Jefferson County, Kentucky, many teenagers, rallied at the district&#x27;s high schools and fought with police trying to break up the crowds. Police cars were vandalized, 200 were arrested, and people were hurt in the melee, but despite further rallies being banned the next day by Louisville&#x27;s mayor, demonstrators showed up to the schools the following day. Kentucky Governor Julian Carroll sent 1,800 members of the Kentucky National Guard and stationed them on every bus. On September 26, 1975, 400 protestors held a rally at Southern High School, which was broken up by police tear gas, followed by a rally of 8,000 the next day, who marched led by a woman in a wheelchair to prevent police reprisals while cameras were running. Despite the protests, Louisville&#x27;s busing program continued.

Congressional opposition to busing continued. Delaware senator (and future 46th US President) Joe Biden said &quot;I don&#x27;t feel responsible for the sins of my father and grandfather,&quot; and that busing was &quot;a liberal train wreck.&quot; In 1977, senators William Roth and Biden proposed the &quot;Biden-Roth&quot; amendment. This amendment &quot;prevented judges from ordering wider busing to achieve actually-integrated districts.&quot; Despite Biden&#x27;s lobbying of other senators and getting the support of Judiciary Committee Chairman James Eastland, &quot;Biden-Roth&quot; narrowly lost.

==== After 2007 ====
Civil rights advocates see the 2007 joint ruling on &quot;Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1&quot; and &quot;Meredith v. Jefferson County Board of Education&quot; of the Roberts court as the inevitable consequence of gradual court decisions dating back to the early 1970s to ease judicial supervision and limit important tools to achieve integrated schools. Even those school districts that voluntarily created race-conscious programs are under pressure to abandon these efforts as the white parents are refusing to participate in any pupil assignment programs. In some cases, white parents filed reverse discrimination lawsuits in court. Wherever the courts have backed away from mandating school districts to implement desegregation plans, resegregation of Blacks and Latinos has increased dramatically. In 1988, 44 percent of southern black students were attending majority-white schools. In 2005, 27 percent of black students were attending majority white schools. By restricting the tools by which schools can address school segregation, many fear that the PICS decision will continue to accelerate this trend. The ruling reflects the culmination of the conservatives&#x27; central message on education, as alleged by the liberal Civil Rights Project, that &quot;race should be ignored, inequalities should be blamed on individuals and schools, and existing civil rights remedies should be dismantled&quot;. In 2001 Congress passed the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) which was promptly signed by President George W. Bush. The law put a premium on student testing, not integration, to measure academic progress. Financial penalties were incurred on schools if students did not demonstrate adequate academic performance. While initially supported by Democrats, critics say the law has failed to adequately address the achievement gap between whites and minorities and that there are problems with implementation and inflexible provisions.

== Criticism ==
===Popular opinion===
Support for the practice is influenced by the methodology of the study conducted. In a Gallup poll taken in the 1973, very low percentages of whites (4 percent) and blacks (9 percent) supported busing outside of local neighborhoods, even though majorities were in favour of other desegregation methods such as redrawing school district boundaries and building low-income housing in middle-income areas. However, a longitudinal study has shown that support for desegregation busing among black respondents has only dropped below 50% once from 1972 to 1976 while support among white respondents has steadily increased. This increased support may be due to the diminished impact of desegregation policies over time. A 1978 study by the RAND Corporation set out to find why whites were opposed to busing and concluded that it was because they believed it destroyed neighborhood schools and camaraderie and increased discipline problems. It is said that busing eroded the community pride and support that neighborhoods had for their local schools. After busing, 60 percent of Boston parents, both black and white, reported more discipline problems in schools. Black children were more likely to be bused than whites, and some black parents saw it as discrimination that uprooted their children from their communities. Politicians and judges who supported busing were seen as hypocrites, as many sent their own children to private school. In the 1968, 1972, and 1976 presidential elections, candidates opposed to busing were elected each time, and Congress voted repeatedly to end court-mandated busing.

Ultimately, many black leaders, from Wisconsin State Rep. Annette Polly Williams, a Milwaukee Democrat, to Cleveland Mayor Michael R. White led efforts to end busing.

===White flight and private schools===
Busing is claimed to have accelerated a trend of middle-class relocation to the suburbs of metropolitan areas. Many opponents of busing claimed the existence of &quot;white flight&quot; based on the court decisions to integrate schools. Such stresses led white middle-class families in many communities to desert the public schools and create a network of private schools.

During the 1970s, &quot;60 Minutes&quot; reported that some members of Congress, government, and the press who supported busing most vociferously sent their own children to private schools, including Senator Ted Kennedy, George McGovern, Thurgood Marshall, Phil Hart, Ben Bradlee, Senator Birch Bayh, Tom Wicker, Philip Geyelin, and Donald Fraser. Many of the judges who ordered busing also sent their children to private schools.

===Distance===
Some critics of busing cited increases in distance to schools. However, segregation of schools often entailed far more distant busing. For example, in Tampa, Florida, the longest bus ride was under desegregation whereas it was during segregation.

===Effect on already-integrated schools===
Critics point out that children in the Northeast were often bused from integrated schools to less integrated schools. The percentage of Northeastern black children who attended a predominantly black school increased from 67 percent in 1968 to 80 percent in 1980 (a higher percentage than in 1954).

===Effect on academic performance===
In 1978, a proponent of busing, Nancy St. John, studied 100 cases of urban busing from the North and did not find what she had been looking for; she found no cases in which significant black academic improvement occurred, but many cases where race relations suffered due to busing, as those in forced-integrated schools had worse relations with those of the opposite race than those in non-integrated schools. Researcher David Armour, also looking for hopeful signs, found that busing &quot;heightens racial identity&quot; and &quot;reduces opportunities for actual contact between the races&quot;.
A 1992 study led by Harvard University Professor Gary Orfield, who supports busing, found black and Hispanic students lacked &quot;even modest overall improvement&quot; as a result of court-ordered busing.

Economist Thomas Sowell wrote that the stated premise for school busing was flawed, as &quot;de facto&quot; racial segregation in schools did not necessarily lead to poor education for black students.

== Effects ==
Busing integrated school age ethnic minorities with the larger community. The &quot;Milliken v. Bradley&quot; Supreme Court decision that busing children across districts is unconstitutional limited the extent of busing to within metropolitan areas. This decision made suburbs attractive to those who wished to evade busing.

Some metropolitan areas in which land values and property-tax structures were less favorable to relocation saw significant declines in enrollment of whites in public schools as white parents chose to enroll their children in private schools. Currently, most segregation occurs across school districts as large cities have moved significantly toward racial balance among their schools.

Recent research by Eric Hanushek, John Kain, and Steven Rivkin has shown that the level of achievement by black students is adversely affected by higher concentrations of black students in their schools. Additionally, the impact of racial concentration appears to be greatest for high-achieving black students.

== Historical examples ==

=== Boston, Massachusetts ===

In 1965 Massachusetts passed into law the Racial Imbalance Act, which ordered school districts to desegregate or risk losing state educational funding. The first law of its kind in the nation, it was opposed by many in Boston, especially less-well-off white ethnic areas, such as the Irish-American neighborhoods of South Boston and Charlestown, Boston.

=== Springfield, Massachusetts ===
Unlike Boston, which experienced a large degree of racial violence following Judge Arthur Garrity&#x27;s decision to desegregate the city&#x27;s public schools in 1974, Springfield quietly enacted its own desegregation busing plans. Although not as well-documented as Boston&#x27;s crisis, Springfield&#x27;s situation centered on the city&#x27;s elementary schools. Much of the primary evidence for Springfield&#x27;s busing plans stemmed from a March 1976 report by a committee for the Massachusetts Commission on Civil Rights (MCCR). According to the report, 30 of the city&#x27;s 36 elementary schools were grouped into six separate districts during the 1974–75 school year, and each district contained at least one racially imbalanced school. The basic idea behind the &quot;six-district&quot; plan was to preserve a neighborhood feeling for school children while busing them locally to improve not only racial imbalances, but also educational opportunities in the school system.

=== Charlotte, North Carolina ===
Charlotte operated under &quot;freedom of choice&quot; plans until the Supreme Court upheld Judge McMillan&#x27;s decision in Swann v. Mecklenburg 1971. The NAACP won the Swann case by producing evidence that Charlotte schools placed over 10,000 white and black students in schools that were not the closest to their homes. Importantly, the Swann v. Mecklenburg case illustrated that segregation was the product of local policies and legislation rather than a natural outcome. In response, an anti-busing organization titled Concerned Parents Association (CPA) was formed in Charlotte. Ultimately, the CPA failed to prevent busing. In 1974, West Charlotte High school even hosted students from Boston to demonstrate the benefits of peaceful integration. Since Capacchione v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools in 1999, however, Charlotte has once again become segregated. A report in 2019 shows that Charlotte-Mecklenburg schools are as segregated as they were before the Brown v. Board of Education decision in 1954.

=== Kansas City, Missouri ===

In 1985, a federal court took partial control of the Kansas City, Missouri School District (KCMSD). Since the district and the state had been found severally liable for the lack of integration, the state was responsible for making sure that money was available for the program. It was one of the most expensive desegregation efforts attempted and included busing, a magnet school program, and an extensive plan to improve the quality of inner city schools. The entire program was built on the premise that extremely good schools in the inner-city area combined with paid busing would be enough to achieve integration.

=== Las Vegas, Nevada ===
In May 1968, the Southern Nevada chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) filed a lawsuit against the Clark County School District (CCSD). The NAACP wanted the CCSD to acknowledge publicly, and likewise, act against the &quot;de facto&quot; segregation that existed in six elementary schools located on the city&#x27;s Westside. This area of Las Vegas had traditionally been a black neighborhood. Therefore, the CCSD did not see the need to desegregate the schools, as the cause of segregation appeared to result from factors outside of its immediate control.

The case initially entered the Eighth Judicial District Court of Nevada, but quickly found its way to the Nevada Supreme Court. According to Brown II, all school desegregation cases had to be heard at the federal level if they reached a state&#x27;s highest court. As a result, the Las Vegas case, which became known as &quot;Kelly v. Clark County School District&quot;, was eventually heard by the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. On May 10, 1972, the Ninth Circuit handed down its decision in favor of the NAACP, which therefore required the CCSD to implement a plan for integration. The CCSD then instituted its &quot;Sixth Grade Center Plan&quot;, which converted the Westside&#x27;s six elementary schools into sixth-grade classrooms where nearly all of the school district&#x27;s sixth graders (black and white alike) would be bused for the 1972–73 school year.

=== Los Angeles, California ===
In 1963, a lawsuit, &quot;Crawford v. Board of Education of the City of Los Angeles&quot;, was filed to end segregation in the Los Angeles Unified School District. The California Supreme Court required the district to come up with a plan in 1977. The board returned to court with what the court of appeal years later would describe as &quot;one of if not the most drastic plan of mandatory student reassignment in the nation&quot;. A desegregation busing plan was developed, to be implemented in the 1978 school year. Two suits to stop the enforced busing plan, both titled &quot;Bustop, Inc. v. Los Angeles Board of Education&quot;, were filed by the group Bustop Inc., and were petitioned to the United States Supreme Court. The petitions to stop the busing plan were subsequently denied by Justice Rehnquist and Justice Powell. California Constitutional Proposition 1, which mandated that busing follow the Equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution, passed in 1979 with 70 percent of the vote. The &quot;Crawford v. Board of Education of the City of Los Angeles&quot; lawsuit was heard in the Supreme Court in 1982. The Supreme Court upheld the decision that Proposition 1 was constitutional, and that, therefore, mandatory busing was not permissible.

=== Nashville, Tennessee ===
In comparison with many other cities in the nation, Nashville was not a hotbed of racial violence or massive protest during the civil rights era. In fact, the city was a leader of school desegregation in the South, even housing a few small schools that were minimally integrated before the &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; decision in 1954. Despite this initial breakthrough, however, full desegregation of the schools was a far cry from reality in Nashville in the mid-1950s, and thus 22 plaintiffs, including black student Robert Kelley, filed suit against the Nashville Board of Education in 1955.

The result of that lawsuit was what came to be known as the &quot;Nashville Plan&quot;, an attempt to integrate the public schools of Nashville (and later all of Davidson County when the district was consolidated in 1963). The plan, beginning in 1957, involved the gradual integration of schools by working up through the grades each year starting in the fall of 1957 with first graders. Very few black children who had been zoned for white schools showed up at their assigned campus on the first day of school, and those who did met with angry mobs outside several city elementary schools. No white children assigned to black schools showed up to their assigned campuses.

After a decade of this gradual integration strategy, it became evident that the schools still lacked full integration. Many argued that Housing Segregation was the true culprit in the matter. In 1970 the &quot;Kelley&quot; case was reintroduced to the courts. Ruling on the case was Judge Leland Clure Morton, who, after seeking advice from consultants from the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, decided the following year that to correct the problem, forced busing of the children was to be mandated, among the many parts to a new plan that was finally decided on. This was a similar plan to that enacted in Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools in Charlotte, North Carolina, the same year.

What followed were mixed emotions from both the black and white communities. Many whites did not want their children to share schools with black children, arguing that it would decrease the quality of their education. While a triumph for some, many blacks believed that the new plan would enforce the closure of neighborhood schools such as Pearl High School, which brought the community together. Parents from both sides did not like the plan because they had no control over where their children were going to be sent to school, a problem that many other cities had during the 1970s when busing was mandated across the country. Despite the judge&#x27;s decision and the subsequent implementation of the new busing plan, the city stood divided.

As in many other cities across the country at this time, many white citizens took action against the desegregation laws. Organized protests against the busing plan began before the order was even official, led by future mayoral candidate Casey Jenkins. While some protested, many other white parents began pulling their children out of the public schools and enrolling them in the numerous private schools that began to spring up almost overnight in Nashville in the 1960s and 1970s. Many of these schools continued to be segregated through the 1970s. Other white parents moved outside of the city limits and eventually outside the Davidson County line so as not to be part of the Metropolitan District and thus not part of the busing plan.

In 1979 and 1980, the &quot;Kelley&quot; case was again brought back to the courts because of the busing plan&#x27;s failure to fully integrate the Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools (MNPS). The plan was reexamined and reconfigured to include some concessions made by the school board and the Kelley plaintiffs and in 1983 the new plan, which still included busing, was introduced. However, problems with &quot;white flight&quot; and private schools continued to segregate MNPS to a certain degree, a problem that has never fully been solved.

=== Pasadena, California ===
In 1970 a federal court ordered the desegregation of the public schools in Pasadena, California. At that time, the proportion of white students in those schools reflected the proportion of whites in the community, 54 percent and 53 percent, respectively. After the desegregation process began, large numbers of whites in the upper and middle classes who could afford it pulled their children from the integrated public school system and placed them into private schools instead. As a result, by 2004 Pasadena became home to 63 private schools, which educated one-third of all school-aged children in the city, and the proportion of white students in the public schools had fallen to 16 percent. In the meantime, the proportion of whites in the community has declined somewhat as well, to 37 percent in 2006. The superintendent of Pasadena&#x27;s public schools characterized them as being to whites &quot;like the bogey-man&quot;, and mounted policy changes, including a curtailment of busing, and a publicity drive to induce affluent whites to put their children back into public schools.

=== Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland ===

In 1974, Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, became the largest school district in the United States forced to adopt a busing plan. The county, a large suburban school district east of Washington, D.C., was over 80 percent white in population and in the public schools. In some county communities close to Washington, there was a higher concentration of black residents than in more outlying areas. Through a series of desegregation orders after the &quot;Brown&quot; decision, the county had a neighborhood-based system of school boundaries. However, the NAACP argued that housing patterns in the county still reflected the vestiges of segregation. Against the will of the Board of Education of Prince George&#x27;s County, the federal court ordered that a school busing plan be set in place. A 1974 Gallup poll showed that 75 percent of county residents were against forced busing and that only 32 percent of blacks supported it.

The transition was very traumatic as the court ordered that the plan be administered with &quot;all due haste&quot;. This happened during the middle of the school term, and students, except those in their senior year in high school, were transferred to different schools to achieve racial balance. Many high school sports teams&#x27; seasons and other typical school activities were disrupted. Life in general for families in the county was disrupted by things such as the changes in daily times to get children ready and receive them after school, transportation logistics for extracurricular activities, and parental participation activities such as volunteer work in the schools and PTA meetings.

The federal case and the school busing order was officially ended in 2001, as the &quot;remaining vestiges of segregation&quot; had been erased to the court&#x27;s satisfaction. Unfortunately, the ultimate result has been resegregation through changes to county demographics, as the percentage of white county residents dropped from over 80% in 1974 to 27% in 2010. Neighborhood-based school boundaries were restored. The Prince George&#x27;s County Public Schools was ordered to pay the NAACP more than $2 million in closing attorney fees and is estimated to have paid the NAACP over $20 million over the course of the case.

=== Richmond, Virginia ===
In April 1971, in the case &quot;Bradley v. Richmond School Board&quot;, Federal District Judge Robert R. Merhige, Jr., ordered an extensive citywide busing program in Richmond, Virginia. When the massive busing program began in the fall of 1971, parents of all races complained about the long rides, hardships with transportation for extracurricular activities, and the separation of siblings when elementary schools at opposite sides of the city were &quot;paired&quot;, (i.e., splitting lower and upper elementary grades into separate schools). The result was further white flight to private schools and to suburbs in the neighboring counties of Henrico and Chesterfield that were predominantly white. In January 1972, Merhige ruled that students in Henrico and Chesterfield counties would have to be bused into the City of Richmond in order to decrease the high percentage of black students in Richmond&#x27;s schools. This order was overturned by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals on June 6, 1972, barring forced busing schemes that made students cross county/city boundaries. (Note: Since 1871, Virginia has had independent cities which are not politically located within counties, although some are completely surrounded geographically by a single county. This distinctive and unusual arrangement was pivotal in the Court of Appeals decision overturning Merhige&#x27;s ruling). The percentage of white students in Richmond city schools declined from 45 to 21 percent between 1960 and 1975 and continued to decline over the next several decades. By 2010 white students accounted for less than 9 percent of student enrollment in Richmond. This so-called &quot;white flight&quot; prevented Richmond schools from ever becoming truly integrated. A number of assignment plans were tried to address the non-racial concerns, and eventually, most elementary schools were &quot;unpaired&quot;.

=== Wilmington, Delaware ===
In Wilmington, Delaware, located in New Castle County, segregated schools were required by law until 1954, when, due to &quot;Belton v. Gebhart&quot; (which was later rolled into &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; on appeal), the school system was forced to desegregate. As a result, the school districts in the Wilmington metropolitan area were split into eleven districts covering the metropolitan area (Alfred I. duPont, Alexis I. duPont, Claymont, Conrad, De La Warr, Marshallton-McKean, Mount Pleasant, New Castle-Gunning Bedford, Newark, Stanton, and Wilmington school districts). However, this reorganization did little to address the issue of segregation, since the Wilmington schools (Wilmington and De La Warr districts) remained predominantly black, while the suburban schools in the county outside the city limits remained predominantly white.

In 1976, the U.S. District Court, in &quot;Evans v. Buchanan&quot;, ordered that the school districts of New Castle County all be combined into a single district governed by the New Castle County Board of Education. The District Court ordered the Board to implement a desegregation plan in which the students from the predominantly black Wilmington and De La Warr districts were required to attend school in the predominantly white suburb districts, while students from the predominantly white districts were required to attend school in Wilmington or De La Warr districts for three years (usually 4th through 6th grade). In many cases, this required students to be bused a considerable distance (12–18 miles in the Christina School District) because of the distance between Wilmington and some of the major communities of the suburban area (such as Newark).

However, the process of handling an entire metropolitan area as a single school district resulted in a revision to the plan in 1981, in which the New Castle County schools were again divided into four separate districts (Brandywine, Christina, Colonial, and Red Clay). However, unlike the 1954 districts, each of these districts was racially balanced and encompassed inner city and suburban areas. Each of the districts continued a desegregation plan based upon busing.

The requirements for maintaining racial balance in the schools of each of the districts was ended by the District Court in 1994, but the process of busing students to and from the suburbs for schooling continued largely unchanged until 2001, when the Delaware state government passed House Bill 300, mandating that the districts convert to sending students to the schools closest to them, a process that continues . In the 1990s, Delaware schools would utilize the Choice program, which would allow children to apply to schools in other school districts based on space.

Wilmington High, which, many felt, was a victim of the busing order, closed in 1998 due to dropping enrollment. The campus would become home to Cab Calloway School of the Arts, a magnet school focused on the arts that was established in 1992. It would also house Charter School of Wilmington, which focuses on math and science, and opened up in 1996.

Delaware currently has some of the highest rates in the nation of children who attend private schools, magnet schools, and charter schools, due to the perceived weaknesses of the public school system.

=== Indianapolis, Indiana ===
Institutional racial segregation was coming to light in Indianapolis in the late 1960s as a result of Civil Rights reformation. U.S. District Judge S. Hugh Dillin issued a ruling in 1971 which found the Indianapolis Public Schools (IPS) district guilty of &quot;de jure&quot; racial segregation. Beginning in 1973, due to federal court mandates, some 7,000 African-American students began to be bused from the IPS district to neighboring township school corporations within Marion County. These townships included Decatur, Franklin, Perry, Warren, Wayne, and Lawrence townships. This practice continued on until 1998, when an agreement was reached between IPS and the United States Department of Justice to phase out inter-district, one-way busing. By 2005, the six township school districts no longer received any new IPS students.

== Re-segregation ==

According to the Civil Rights Project at Harvard University, the desegregation of U.S. public schools peaked in 1988; since then, schools have become more segregated because of changes in demographic residential patterns with continuing growth in suburbs and new communities. Jonathan Kozol has found that as of 2005, the proportion of black students at majority-white schools was at &quot;a level lower than in any year since 1968&quot;. Changing population patterns, with dramatically increased growth in the South and Southwest, decreases in old industrial cities, and much increased immigration of new ethnic groups, have altered school populations in many areas.

School districts continue to try various programs to improve student and school performance, including magnet schools and special programs related to the economic standing of families. Omaha proposed incorporating some suburban districts within city limits to enlarge its school-system catchment area. It wanted to create a &quot;one tax, one school&quot; system that would also allow it to create magnet programs to increase diversity in now predominantly white schools. Ernest Chambers, a 34-year-serving black state senator from North Omaha, Nebraska, believed a different solution was needed. Some observers said that in practical terms, public schools in Omaha had been re-segregated since the end of busing in 1999.

In 2006, Chambers offered an amendment to the Omaha school reform bill in the Nebraska State Legislature which would provide for creation of three school districts in Omaha according to current racial demographics: black, white, and Hispanic, with local community control of each district. He believed this would give the black community the chance to control a district in which their children were the majority. Chambers&#x27; amendment was controversial. Opponents to the measure described it as &quot;state-sponsored segregation&quot;.

The authors of a 2003 Harvard study on re-segregation believe current trends in the South of white teachers leaving predominantly black schools is an inevitable result of federal court decisions limiting former methods of civil rights-era protections, such as busing and affirmative action in school admissions. Teachers and principals cite other issues, such as economic and cultural barriers in schools with high rates of poverty, as well as teachers&#x27; choices to work closer to home or in higher-performing schools. In some areas black teachers are also leaving the profession, resulting in teacher shortages.

Education conservatives argue that any apparent separation of races is due to patterns of residential demographics not due to court decisions. They argue that the &quot;Brown&quot; decision has been achieved and that there is no segregation in the way that existed before the ruling. They further argue that employing race to impose desegregation policies discriminates and violates &quot;Brown&quot;″s central warning of using racial preferences.

<text>The Society of Industrial and Office Realtors (SIOR) is an international professional commercial and industrial real estate association based in Washington, D.C. It offers a professional designation (SIOR) to commercial brokers and other industry professionals. It has 3,400 members in 686 cities and 36 countries. SIOR designees can hold the following specialty designations: industrial, office, sales manager, executive manager, or advisory service. SIOR also includes associate members, who are corporate executives, developers, educators, and others involved in the commercial real estate industry.

==Founding==
SIOR was originally SIR (Society of Industrial Realtors). In 1939, the idea of forming an organization for industrial real estate brokers began. The sequence of events can be summarized as follows:

* Despite the continued growth of industrial real estate, industrial real estate specialists had little representation within the National Association of Real Estate Boards (NAREB).
* Industrial realtors Frank G. Binswanger and David T. Houston Sr. made an effort to organize and coordinate industrial realtors across the United States and Canada. 
* They were able to gain sponsorship for the founding of Society of Industrial Realtors, and in the fall of 1940 at NAREB&#x27;s national convention in Philadelphia, the formation of a national body of industrial realtors was approved.

One year and two months later, the US entered World War II.

The society was instrumental in locating existing, and immediately available, plant space that could be used to produce defense, and later, war material. Over 200 brokers from across the United States and Canada surveyed suitable facilities and reported their findings to the War Department (now the Department of Defense).

<text>Freidank (&quot;Vrîdanc&quot;) was a Middle High German didactic poet of the early 13th century. He is the author of &quot;Bescheidenheit&quot; (&quot;practical wisdom, correct judgement, discretion&quot;), a collection of rhyming aphorisms in 53 thematic divisions, extending to some 4,700 verses. The work was extremely popular in the German Middle Ages and is transmitted in numerous manuscripts, as well as in a Latin translation (&quot;Fridangi Discretio&quot;).

==Life==
Nothing about Freidank&#x27;s life is known with certainty, such hypotheses as there are based on the language and content of his work &quot;Bescheidenheit&quot;.
He would have been born in the later 12th century, and was likely of Swabian origin.

&quot;Freidank&quot; (&quot;Vrîdanc&quot;, &quot;Vrîgedanc&quot;) literally translates to &quot;free thought&quot;; passages in Freidank&#x27;s poetry allude to the freedom of thought, and the name may be an assumed epithet, although &quot;Freidank&quot; (&quot;Fridanc, Fridangus&quot;) is also recorded as a German family name in the later medieval period; one &quot;Bernhard Freidank&quot; is mentioned in Helbling&#x27;s &quot;Lucidarius&quot; (but it has been argued that this may in fact be a reference to the poet himself.).
Wilhelm Grimm (1834) argued that the author is &quot;Vrîdanc&quot; is a pseudonym and that the author of &quot;Bescheidenheit&quot; is Walter von der Vogelweide. This hypothesis was immediately rejected by the majority of scholars; according to Bartsch (1878), the only German philologist convinced by Grimm&#x27;s idea was Wackernagel.

Based on the contents of &quot;Bescheidenheit&quot;, its author was educated in writing and proper speech, and it is likely that he was a cleric by education.
It seems likely that in 1228–1229 he was involved in the Sixth Crusade of the Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick II, as the section about Acre seems to refer to this period.

Freidank may have died in 1233, if he was the &quot;magister Fridancus&quot; whose death was reported in the annals of the Cistercian monastery at Kaisheim. 
The chronicler Hartmann Schedel claimed to have seen a monument with Freidank&#x27;s epitaph in Venetian Treviso in 1465. Gion (1870) argued that the Freidank buried in Treviso died in the 1380s and is not to be confused with the author of the &quot;Bescheidenheit&quot;.

==&quot;Bescheidenheit&quot;==
The didactic poem &quot;Bescheidenheit&quot; was composed in the early 13th century, between about 1215 and 1230. It is a collection of rhyming aphorisms in 53 thematic divisions and about 4,700 verses which encapsulate the folk wisdom and experience of the period. 
Critical editions of the work were published by Wilhelm Grimm (1834, second edition 1860) and by H. E. Bezzenberger (1872, reprinted 1962).

Due to its linguistic elegance, the work was very popular throughout the late medieval period and well into the German Renaissance.
It has been transmitted in numerous manuscripts and also in a Latin translation (&quot;Fridangi Discretio&quot;) and was quoted by contemporary authors, including Hugo von Trimberg and Rudolf von Ems. 
Manuscript editions gave way seamlessly to printed editions (Sebastian Brant, 1508). 
Some quotes have survived as proverbs still current in Modern German. 
The name of Freidank became a standard authority for wise sayings, and was often invoked as the author of gnomic sayings.

Grimm divided the work into 54 sections or chapters, as follows:
1. (God),
1b. (Hail Mary),
2. (mass),
3. (the soul),
4. (Man),
5. (Jews),
6. (heretics),
7. (usury),
8. (pride),
9. (the world),
10. (sins),
11. (rich and poor),
12. (faith/truth and faithlessness/untruth),
13. (thieves),
14. (play, sport),
15. (service),
16. (right and wrong),
17. (age),
18. &#x27; (nobility and virtue),
19. (the blind),
20. (honey),
21. (profit and possessions),
22. (sorrow),
23. (leeches and the sick),
24. (envy),
25. (praise),
26. (scolding),
27. (fellowship),
28. (wrath),
29. (heaven and hell),
30. (priests, clerics),
31. (kings and princes),
32. (the wise and fools),
33. (the generous and the avaricious),
34. (honour),
35. (inebriation),
36. (friends),
37. (love and women),
38. (insight),
39. (hunger),
40. (madness), 
41. (good and evil),
42. (the unknown),
43. (beasts),
44. (wealth and money),
45. (Rome), 
46. (Acre),
47. (language),
48. (lies and deceptions),
49. (the Antichrist),
50. (the Ten Commandments),
51. (death), 
52. (the Last Judgment),
53. (a prayer).

<text>Karl Joseph Simrock (28 August 1802 – 18 July 1876) was a German poet and writer. He is primarily known for his translation of &quot;Das Nibelungenlied&quot; into modern German.

== Life ==
He was born in Bonn, where his father was a music publisher. He studied law at the University of Bonn and Humboldt University, Berlin, and in 1823 entered the Prussian civil service, from which he was expelled in 1830 for writing a poem in praise of the July Revolution in France. Afterwards he became a lecturer at the University of Bonn, where in 1850 he was made a professor of Old German literature and where he died.

== Work ==
Simrock established his reputation by his excellent modern rendering of &quot;Das Nibelungenlied&quot; (1827), and of the poems of Walther von der Vogelweide (1833). Among other works translated by him into modern German were the &quot;Arme Heinrich&quot; of Hartmann von Aue (1830), the &quot;Parzival&quot; and &quot;Titurel&quot; of Wolfram von Eschenbach (1842), the &quot;Tristan&quot; of Gottfried von Strassburg (1855) and the &quot;Heldenbuch&quot; (1843–1849), which he supplemented with independent poems. Before the publication of this work he had shown an original poetical faculty in &quot;Wieland der Schmied&quot; (1835); and in 1844 he issued a volume of &quot;Gedichte&quot; in which there are many good lyrics, romances and ballads. In 1850 appeared &quot;Lauda Sion&quot;, and in 1857 the &quot;Deutsche Sionsharfe&quot;, collections of Old German sacred poetry.

Of his publications the most popular and the most valuable were the &quot;Deutsche Volksbücher&quot;, of which fifty-five were printed between 1839 and 1867. His best contribution to scholarship was his &quot;Handbuch der deutschen Mythologie&quot; (1853–1855). At an early stage of his career Simrock gained high standing among students of Shakespeare for his &quot;Quellen des Shakespeare in Novellen, Märchen und Sagen&quot; (1831); afterwards he translated Shakespeare&#x27;s poems and a considerable number of his dramas. The large number of editions through which Simrock&#x27;s translations from the Middle High German have passed (more than 53 of &quot;Das Nibelungenlied&quot;) bear witness to their popularity. An edition of his &quot;Ausgewählte Werke&quot; in 12 vols. was published by G. Klee (1907).

<text>The Royal Shakespeare Theatre (RST) (originally called the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre) is a Grade II* listed 1,040+ seat thrust stage theatre owned by the Royal Shakespeare Company dedicated to the English playwright and poet William Shakespeare. It is located in the town of Stratford-upon-Avon – Shakespeare&#x27;s birthplace – in the English Midlands, beside the River Avon. The building incorporates the smaller Swan Theatre. The Royal Shakespeare and Swan Theatres re-opened in November 2010 after undergoing a major renovation known as the Transformation Project.

==History==


The tricentenary of Shakespeare&#x27;s birth in 1864 gave impetus for a permanent memorial to him in his hometown. The original Shakespeare Memorial Theatre came about through the campaigning efforts and donations of Edward Fordham Flower and his son Charles Edward Flower, owners of a local brewery business in Stratford, and important figures in local political affairs, due to their efforts, the first theatre was opened on the banks of the Avon on 19 April 1879. It was a Victorian Gothic structure, designed by William Unsworth and Edward Dodgshun.

The original theatre was gutted by fire on 6 March 1926. The new Shakespeare Memorial Theatre opened in 1932 on a site adjacent to the original. The architect was Elisabeth Scott, so the theatre became the first important building erected in Britain from the designs of a woman architect. It was renamed the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in 1961, following the establishment of the Royal Shakespeare Company the previous year.

In the building designed by Scott, the theatre had a proscenium-arch stage, and a seating capacity of about 1,400 people, on three tiers (stalls, circle and balcony). Two tiers of seating were later added to the side walls of the theatre and the stage extended beyond the proscenium, by means of an &#x27;apron&#x27;. Balcony seats could only be accessed by means of a staircase to the side of the building, separate from the main foyer and bar. The theatre has several notable Art Deco features, including the staircase and corridors at either side of the auditorium. It is a Grade II* listed building.

The current theatre complex includes the remains of the original 1879 theatre, which was rebuilt and incorporated into Scott&#x27;s building to serve as a conference centre and rehearsal room. Since 1986 it has been used by the Swan Theatre.

The Royal Shakespeare and Swan Theatres are on the western bank of the River Avon, with the adjacent Bancroft Gardens providing a scenic riverside setting. The Rooftop Restaurant and Bar overlooks both the river and the Bancroft Gardens.

===Redevelopment===
The Royal Shakespeare Company had renovated the Royal Shakespeare Theatre as part of a £112.8m Transformation project which included the creation of a new 1040+ seat, thrust stage auditorium which brought actors and audiences closer together, with the distance of the furthest seat from the stage being reduced from to . The Transformation project also included improvements to the Swan Theatre, the creation of an array of new public spaces, including a new Riverside Cafe and Rooftop Restaurant, a observation tower, and improved backstage conditions for the actors and crew. The new theatre is also more accessible to people with disabilities and offers a more comfortable theatre experience.

The theatre is a &quot;one-room&quot; theatre, which allows the actors and the audience to share the same space, as they did when Shakespeare&#x27;s plays were first produced. The stage reaches out into the audience, who are seated on three sides of it. This one-room theatre creates a more traditional Shakespearean performance area, allowing the audience to draw closer to the actors and creating a more personal theatre experience.

The funding for the project came from many different sources including; private pledges, Arts Council England, and the regional development agency Advantage West Midlands, as well as a successful public fundraising campaign. The Transformation project also incorporated the creation of the temporary Courtyard Theatre to house performances in Stratford-upon-Avon during the time the Royal Shakespeare and Swan Theatres were closed, new offices at Chapel Lane, a nursery and refurbished rehearsal rooms at Arden Street. The project reached over a total of £100 million in cost and also drew in financial support from RSC America and its own board members.

Plans to redevelop the theatre were finalised and work commenced in 2007, with a scheduled completion date of 2010. The RSC had its own project team, led by Project Director, Peter Wilson OBE. Other members of the project team included: Bennetts Associates (architects), Buro Happold (engineers and transport consultants), Charcoalblue (theatre consultants), Mace (construction managers), Acoustic Dimensions (acoustic consultants), Drivers Jonas Deloitte (project management and strategic planning advisors) and Gardiner and Theobald (quantity surveyors and planning supervisors).

An urn containing the ashes of Actor Ian Richardson who had died on 9 February 2007 was placed into the foundations of the auditorium of the building during its renovation in 2008 by his widow Maroussia Frank and his son Miles Richardson.

Meanwhile, performances were transferred to the temporary Courtyard Theatre, which was a full-sized working prototype for the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, built on the site of the RSC&#x27;s studio theatre, The Other Place.

The new theatre opened in November 2010, with preview events and activities, in advance of the first full Shakespeare performances from the RSC&#x27;s existing repertoire from February 2011. The first new productions designed specifically for the Royal Shakespeare Theatre&#x27;s stage began from April 2011, with Michael Boyd&#x27;s Macbeth, part of the RSC&#x27;s 50th Birthday Season celebrations, which ran from April to December 2011.

Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip officially opened the Royal Shakespeare Theatre on 4 March 2011. Ceremonies included a performance of the balcony scene from &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;.
==Facilities==
The theatre has a new Rooftop Restaurant and Bar with views over the River Avon, a Riverside Cafe and Terrace, a Colonnade linking the Royal Shakespeare and Swan Theatres together for the first time, the PACCAR Room exhibition space, and a tower which provides circulation and views across Stratford-upon-Avon and the surrounding area from its viewing platform. There is also a riverside walk which stretches from the Bancroft Gardens, past the theatre, towards Holy Trinity Church.

The whole building is now accessible for the first time for visitors, performers and staff with disabilities. The renovations tripled the number of dedicated wheelchair spaces in the new auditorium from those in the previous auditorium, added lifts (there were no public lifts in the previous building), accessible toilets on all levels and removed steps on the riverside walk, which previously had many stepped levels.

<text>The Grünfeld Defence is a chess opening characterised by the moves:
:1. 
:2. 
:3. 

Black offers White the possibility of 4.cxd5, which may be followed by 4...Nxd5 and 5.e4, giving White an imposing duo. If White does not take the d5-pawn, Black may eventually play ...dxc4, when a White response of e4 again leads to the same pawn structure. In classical opening theory this imposing was held to give White a large advantage, but the hypermodern school, which was coming to the fore in the 1920s, held that a large pawn centre could be a liability rather than an asset. The Grünfeld is therefore a key hypermodern opening, showing in stark terms how a large pawn centre can either be a powerful battering ram or a target for attack.
==History==
The first instance of this opening is in an 1855 game by Moheschunder Bannerjee, an Indian player who had transitioned from Indian chess rules, playing Black against John Cochrane in Calcutta, in May 1855:

and White mates in three (19.Nh6+ double check Kh8 20.Qg8+ Rxg8 21.Nf7). Cochrane published a book reporting his games with Moheshchunder and other Indians in 1864.

It gained popularity after Ernst Grünfeld introduced it into international play at the Bad Pistyan Tournament 7–28 April 1922, where, in his first game with the defense, he drew Friedrich Sämisch in 22 moves. Later the same year on November 18, 1922, Ernst Grünfeld defeated future world champion Alexander Alekhine in Vienna in 55 moves. Grünfeld usually employed a very classical style. The defence was later adopted by a number of prominent players, including Vasily Smyslov, Viktor Korchnoi, Leonid Stein and Bobby Fischer. Garry Kasparov often used the defence, including in his World Championship matches against Anatoly Karpov in 1986, 1987 and 1990, and Vladimir Kramnik in 2000.

Notable 21st-century players who have employed the opening include Magnus Carlsen, Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, Loek van Wely, Peter Svidler, Peter Leko, Viswanathan Anand, Luke McShane, Ian Nepomniachtchi and Gata Kamsky. Anand employed it twice in the World Chess Championship 2010. In the World Chess Championship 2012 between Anand and Boris Gelfand, each player used the Grünfeld once with both games ending in draws. Anand faced the Grünfeld against Magnus Carlsen during the first game of the World Chess Championship 2014 and drew in a Rook and Queen ending.

The Game of the Century between Donald Byrne and 13-year-old Bobby Fischer on October 17, 1956, featured this opening, although arriving in the Grünfeld via a transposition of moves (using 1.Nf3 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.d4 0-0 5.Bf4 d5).

==Exchange Variation: 4.cxd5 Nxd5 5.e4 ==

The main line of the Grünfeld, the Exchange Variation (&quot;ECO&quot; codes D85–D89), is defined by the continuation 4.cxd5 Nxd5 5.e4. Now White has an imposing looking centre – and the main continuation 5...Nxc3 6.bxc3 strengthens it still further. Black generally attacks White&#x27;s centre with ...c5 and ...Bg7, often followed by moves such as ...Qa5, ...cxd4, ...Bg4 and ...Nc6. White often uses their big centre to launch an attack against Black&#x27;s king. One subvariation, frequently played by Karpov, including four games of his 1987 world championship match against Kasparov in Seville, Spain, is the Seville Variation, after 6...Bg7 7.Bc4 c5 8.Ne2 Nc6 9.Be3 0-0 10.0-0 Bg4 11.f3 Na5 12.Bxf7+, long thought a poor move by theory, as the resultant dark-square weakness had been believed to give Black more than enough compensation for the pawn.

White can their pieces in a number of ways in the Exchange Variation. For decades, theory held that the correct method of development was with Bc4 and Ne2, often followed by 0-0 and f4–f5, playing for a central breakthrough or kingside attack. It was generally thought that an early Nf3 was weak in the Exchange Variation because it allowed Black too much pressure on the centre with ...Bg4. In the late 1970s, however, Karpov, Kasparov and others found different methods to play the Exchange Variation with White, often involving an early Rb1 to remove the rook from the sensitive a1–h8 diagonal, as well as attempting to hinder the development of Black&#x27;s . Another, relatively recently developed system involves quickly playing Be3, Qd2 and Rc1 or Rd1 to fortify White&#x27;s centre, remove White&#x27;s rook from the diagonal and possibly enable an early d5 push by White.

Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are the leading practitioners as White, and Ľubomír Ftáčnik has had many fine results with the black pieces.

==Russian System: 4.Nf3 Bg7 5.Qb3 ==
In bringing more pressure to bear against Black&#x27;s central outpost on d5, White practically forces ...dxc4, thus gaining a central preponderance; however, in return, their queen will often be exposed as Black&#x27;s queenside play unfolds in the middlegame. After 5...dxc4 6.Qxc4 0-0 7.e4 Black has several primary options:

===Hungarian Variation: 7...a6 ===
The Hungarian Variation, 7...a6, has been championed by Peter Leko.

===Smyslov Variation: 7...Bg4 8.Be3 Nfd7 ===
Named after Vasily Smyslov, 7...Bg4 8.Be3 Nfd7 was a topical line from the 1950s through the mid-1970s.

===Prins Variation: 7...Na6 ===
7...Na6 is Lodewijk Prins&#x27;s idea, which Kasparov favoured in several of his World Championship matches against Karpov.

===Byrne Variation: 7...Nc6 ===
This line is commonly seen in recent games. After 7...Nc6, White will most commonly play 8.Be2, followed by 8...e5! 9.d5 Nd4 10.Nxd4 exd4 11.Qxd4. A pawn sacrifice to develop Black&#x27;s pieces and generate active counterplay.

===Other lines===
7...c6, 7...b6

==Taimanov Variation (aka Petrosian Variation): 4.Nf3 Bg7 5.Bg5 ==

In this line, favoured by Yasser Seirawan, after the nearly universal 5...Ne4, White plays 6.Bh4 or 6.cxd5, with Black then opting for either 6...Nxc3 7.bxc3 dxc4 or 6...Nxg5 7.Nxg5 e6. In the latter case, 7...c6 is sometimes tried. 6.Nxd5 grabbing the pawn loses a piece after 6...Nxg5 7.Nxg5 e6. After 6.cxd5 Nxg5 7.Nxg5 e6, White has 8.Qd2 exd5 9.Qe3+, with attacking chances (though the interpolation 8...h6 9.Nf3 exd5 is a significant alternative), or the more usual 8.Nf3 exd5 after which play generally proceeds on lines analogous to the Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined, Exchange Variation, with a queenside minority attack by White (b2–b4–b5xc6), as Black aims for their traditional kingside play with f7–f5–f4 and, in this case, g6–g5.
==Lines with 4.Bf4 and the Grünfeld Gambit==
For players who do not wish to take on the complexities of the Exchange Variation, the move 4.Bf4 is generally considered a safer continuation for White. White opts for the initiative on the queenside with a smaller pawn centre. In the main line (D82), play proceeds with 4...Bg7 5.e3 c5 6.dxc5 Qa5, with White&#x27;s choices at their seventh move being cxd5, Qb3, Qa4, or Rc1. Despite its reputation, in statistical databases this variation shows only a slightly higher percentage of White wins and draws, as opposed to the Exchange Variation. The variation is not often met in top-flight play today, its usage having declined significantly since its heyday in the 1930s.

In this variation, play may also continue 4.Bf4 Bg7 5.e3 0-0, which is known as the Grünfeld Gambit (&quot;ECO&quot; code D83). White can accept the gambit by playing 6.cxd5 Nxd5 7.Nxd5 Qxd5 8.Bxc7, or decline it with 6.Qb3 or 6.Rc1, to which Black responds with 6...c5.
==Neo-Grünfeld Defence==

Systems in which White delays the development Nc3 are known as the Neo-Grünfeld Defence (&quot;ECO&quot; code D70–D79); typical move orders are 1.d4 Nf6 2.g3 g6 3.c4 d5 or, more commonly, 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.g3 d5 (the latter is known as the Kemeri Variation). 
==Other variations==
Apart from the above, among the more popular continuations are:
* 4.Qb3 (Accelerated Russian System) &quot;ECO&quot; D81
* 4.Nf3 Bg7 5.Qa4+ (Flohr Variation) &quot;ECO&quot; D90
* 4.Nf3 Bg7 5.e3 (Quiet System or Slow System) &quot;ECO&quot; D94
* 4.cxd5 Nxd5 5.Na4 (Nadanian Variation) &quot;ECO&quot; D85

==Illustrative games==

<text>George Peele (baptised 25 July 1556– buried 9 November 1596) was an English translator, poet, and dramatist, who is most noted for his supposed, but not universally accepted, collaboration with William Shakespeare on the play &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot;. Many anonymous Elizabethan plays have been attributed to him, but his reputation rests mainly on &quot;Edward I&quot;, &quot;The Old Wives&#x27; Tale&quot;, &quot;The Battle of Alcazar&quot;, &quot;The Arraignment of Paris&quot;, and &quot;David and Bethsabe&quot;. &quot;The Troublesome Reign of John, King of England&quot;, the immediate source for Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King John&quot;, has been published under his name.

==Life==
Peele was christened on 25 July 1556 at St James Garlickhythe in the City of London. His father, James Peele (died 30 December 1585), who appears to have belonged to a Devonshire family, was clerk of Christ&#x27;s Hospital, a school which was then situated in central London. He wrote two treatises on bookkeeping, &quot;The Maner and Fourme How to Kepe a Perfecte Reconyng&quot; (1553) and &quot;The Pathe Waye to Perfectnes&quot; (1569). The latter depicts James Peele in a woodcut on the title page. No contemporary likeness of George is known, although he was said to be short-legged, dark complected, red haired, and squinting, although not necessarily from reliable sources. George&#x27;s mother, Anne, died on 1 July 1580, and his father married Christian Widers (d. 1597 in St Christopher le Stocks, a church since demolished) on 3 November 1580. She became a nurse on the Hospital payroll, where she remained five years after James Peele&#x27;s death, when she married Ralph Boswell. His siblings included Anne (died 10 January 1568/9), Isabel, Judith (died 16 April 1582) and James (born 3 January 1563/4). Anne married John Alford on 14 May 1565 and had one son, Robert (9 October 1567 – c. 12 March 1654/5). Judith married John Jackman on 19 June 1575 and had three children, Susan (born 3 June 1576), William (30 April 1577 – 1 July 1577) and Sarah (died 25 May 1578). On 5 February 1568/9 Isabel married Mathew Shakespeare, with whom she had eight children. Duncan Salkeld, a university lecturer at University of Chichester, has suggested that while Matthew Shakespeare &quot;may have been unrelated&quot; to William Shakespeare, the listing of Matthew&#x27;s marriage to Isabel Peele suggests a possible link, because Isabels&#x27; playwriting brother is thought by some to have collaborated on Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot;. James Peele also wrote the Ironmongers&#x27; Pageants of 1566 and 1569, which may have led to George&#x27;s writing of two Lord Mayor&#x27;s pageants.

George Peele was educated at Christ&#x27;s Hospital, and entered Broadgates Hall, Oxford, in 1571. In 1574 he removed to Christ Church, taking his B.A. degree in 1577, and proceeding M.A. in 1579. In that year, the governors of Christ&#x27;s Hospital requested their clerk to &quot;discharge his house of his son, George Peele.&quot; He went up to London about 1580, the year he married his first wife, 16-year-old heiress Ann Cooke, the only child of Hugh Christian, who was also known by the surnames Cooke, Alettor, Elector, and Nelettor (his brother, Daniel, used Alettor). Christian had died a few months before the marriage, and lawsuits over his estate were not settled for years, draining the inheritance.

In 1583, when Albertus Alasco (Albert Laski), a Polish nobleman, was entertained at Christ Church, Peele was entrusted with the arrangement of two Latin plays by William Gager (fl. 1580–1619) presented on the occasion. He was also complimented by Gager for an English verse translation of one of the &quot;Iphigenias&quot; of Euripides. In 1585 he was employed to write the &quot;Device of the Pageant borne before Woolston Dixie&quot;, and in 1591 he devised the pageant in honour of another Lord Mayor, Sir William Webbe. This was the &quot;Descensus Astraeae&quot; (printed in the &quot;Harleian Miscellany&quot;, 1808), in which Queen Elizabeth is honoured as &quot;Astraea&quot;.

Robert Greene, at the end of his pamphlet &quot;Greene&#x27;s Groats-Worth of Wit&quot;, exhorts Peele to repentance, saying that Peele, like Greene himself, has &quot;been driven to extreme shifts for a living.&quot; Anecdotes of his reckless life were emphasized by the use of his name in connection with the apocryphal &quot;Merrie conceited Jests of George Peele&quot; (printed in 1607). Many of the stories had circulated before in other jestbooks, unattached to Peele&#x27;s name, but there are personal touches that may be biographical. The book provided source material for the play &quot;The Puritan,&quot; one of the works of the Shakespeare Apocrypha. This is largely dismissed by Peele biographer David H. Horne. &quot;In the minds of at least some of those who have voiced such views a process of circular reasoning must have unconsciously taken place: Meres&#x27; statement that Peele died by the pox means that Peele was dissipated, since the hero of the &quot;Jests&quot; is dissipated. His acquaintanceship with Greene, who was dissipated, bears this out. therefore, because he was acquainted with Greene and died of the pox, the evidence of the &quot;Jests&quot; to the effect that he was dissipated may be accepted as authentic.&quot; He notes that jest books on famous subjects were common, including William Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, Colley Cibber, Thomas Killigrew, James Quin, David Garrick, Laurence Sterne, William Congreve, Lord Sandwich, Lord Chesterfield, Samuel Johnson, Falstaff, Tristram Shandy, and Polly Peachum. He shows that most were derived from &quot;Merry Tales and Quick Answers&quot;, while the few jests unique to the volume follow similar patterns to traditional jests with merely the details changed. &quot;Peele was a product of the middle London,&quot; Horne writes, &quot;but his recurrent courtly themes of war and pastoralism show that in his work he aspired to the highest. It is ironical that his present reputation should have dropped him to the lowest ... But why is it that although Ben Jonson killed a man and was in prison many times, his reputation does not seem to have suffered? Let us not single out Peele for opprobrium unless we are prepared to maintain that all of Greene&#x27;s acquaintances, and men like Jonson, were immersed in sin.&quot; Horne then attacks W.M. Creizenach&#x27;s view that &quot;David and Bethsabe&quot; is the &quot;product of a crapulous morality dating from the last years of the poet&#x27;s dissolute life&quot; as having a questionable basis— &quot;Peele was in most respects like his fellow Elizabethans, morally neither better or worse, aesthetically more perceptive; in technical skill equal to his fellow poets; in the sweetness of his piping superior to all but Marlowe, Spenser, and Shakespeare.&quot;

Peele may have married a second time, to Mary Gates or Yates. It is not possible to state definitively that the George Peele who married Mary Gates is the dramatist, as another George Peele, a boxmaker who died in 1604, was living in London at the time. There is not enough information in the record to determine for certain to which George Peele she was actually married. Frank S. Hook, who edited a 1961 edition of &quot;Edward I&quot;, suggests that David H. Horne&#x27;s speculation in the first volume of the same edition is correct in believing this is the same George Peele based on a fictitious incident in the play&#x27;s first scene:

Peele may be more interested in what should be done than in what actually has been done. The emphasis on generosity to soldiers and veterans is in ironic contrast to the way the fighting forces in the Netherlands were actually treated. Leicester&#x27;s reports, summarized in the &quot;Calendar of State Papers (Foreign)&quot; show amply the suffering of soldiers; they were not paid on time, and their living conditions were deplorable. Likewise, the Acts of Privy Council for the period after 1590, when soldiers began returning from Willoughby&#x27;s expedition to France, demonstrate the care of wounded veterans was becoming an increasingly embarrassing problem for Elizabeth&#x27;s government. Read in light of these contemporary documents, this scene takes on a bitterly ironic note.

In the scene, Edward I establishes a &quot;colledge&quot; for wounded soldiers, something he did not do in real life, nor was this something Elizabeth did, although in 1587, the Earl of Leicester had done so in Elizabeth&#x27;s name, at the Galthius. While it must be said that Hook and Horne are writing for the same edition with Charles Tyler Prouty as general editor, this ties directly with Horne&#x27;s supposition that this is the same George Peele, for the George Peele who married Mary Gates was the widow of the former Master-Gunner of Berghen-op-Zoom, Lawrence Gates, and Mary and George Peele entered a lengthy legal battle to collect Mary&#x27;s war widow salary. One wonders why Peele would have added such a fictitious moment to &quot;Edward I&quot; were he not the George Peele trying to collect these funds. This involved a three-year litigation against Thomas Gurlyn, who was a buyer of soldiers&#x27; uncollected wages, who countersued Mary on allegations that she had forged Lawrence Gates&#x27;s will. The record does not show whether Gurlyn, who stalled payment, ever actually paid what he owed to the Peeles, despite Peele obtaining a verdict against him. Horne speculates that evidence of Peele&#x27;s sickness in a letter to Lord Burghley indicates that he was probably unable to work and thus pay legal fees. Horne also speculates that Peele himself may have been a soldier.

==Death==

Peele died &quot;of the pox,&quot; according to Francis Meres, aged 40, and was buried on 9 November 1596 in St James&#x27;s Church, Clerkenwell. One of the eight boarding houses at the modern Horsham campus of Christ&#x27;s Hospital is now named Peele after George Peele, and as a commemoration to the work of the Peele family with the ancient foundation of the Christ&#x27;s Hospital school.

==Plays==
* &quot;Sir Clyomon and Sir Clamydes&quot; (1577) (attributed)
* &quot;The Arraignment of Paris&quot; (1581)
* &quot;The Troublesome Reign of King John&quot; (1589)
* &quot;Mucedorus&quot; (1590) (attributed)
* &quot;The Battle of Alcazar&quot; (1591)
* &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; (1592) (attributed; co-written with Shakespeare)
* &quot;The Famous Chronicle of King Edward the First&quot; (1593)
* &quot;The Love of King David and Fair Bethsabe&quot; (1594)
* &quot;The Old Wives&#x27; Tale&quot; (1595)

His pastoral comedy &quot;The Arraignment of Paris&quot; was presented by the Children of the Chapel Royal before Queen Elizabeth perhaps as early as 1581, and was printed anonymously in 1584. In the play, Paris is asked by Jupiter to decide which goddesses, Juno, Pallas or Venus should be awarded the golden apple. He awards this to Venus who carries Paris away, leaving his wife Oenone disconsolate. Juno and Pallas arraign Paris before the gods of partiality in his judgement. The case is then referred to Diana, with whom the final decision rests. She gives the apple to none of the competitors but to a nymph called Eliza, &#x27;our Zabeta fayre&#x27;, a reference to Queen Elizabeth I.

His play &quot;Famous Chronicle of King Edward the First&quot; was printed in 1593. This chronicle history is an advance on the old chronicle plays, and marks a step towards the Shakespearean historical drama. Peele may have written or contributed to the bloody tragedy &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot;, which was published as the work of Shakespeare. This theory is in part due to Peele&#x27;s predilection for gore, as evidenced in &quot;The Battle of Alcazar&quot; (acted 1588–1589, printed 1594), published anonymously, which is attributed with much probability to him. &quot;The Old Wives&#x27; Tale&quot; (printed 1595) was followed by &quot;The Love of King David and fair Bethsabe&quot; (written ca. 1588, printed 1599), which is notable as an example of Elizabethan drama drawn entirely from Scriptural sources. F. G. Fleay sees in it a political satire, and identifies Elizabeth and Leicester as David and Bathsheba, Mary, Queen of Scots as Absalom.

&quot;Sir Clyomon and Sir Clamydes&quot; (printed 1599) has been attributed to Peele, but on insufficient grounds. Other plays attributed to Peele include &quot;Jack Straw&quot; (ca. 1587), &quot;The Wisdom of Doctor Dodypoll&quot; (printed 1600), &quot;The Maid&#x27;s Metamorphosis&quot; (printed 1600), and &quot;Wily Beguiled&quot; (printed 1606) – though the scholarly consensus has judged these attributions to be insufficiently supported by evidence. Indeed, individual scholars have repeatedly resorted to Peele in their attempts to grapple with Elizabethan plays of uncertain authorship. Plays that have been assigned to (or blamed on) Peele include &quot;Locrine&quot;, &quot;The Troublesome Reign of King John,&quot; and Parts 1 and 2 of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry VI&quot; trilogy, in addition to &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot;. &quot;Edward III&quot; was attributed to Peele by Tucker Brooke in 1908. While the attribution of the entire play to Peele is mere speculation, Sir Brian Vickers demonstrated using metrical and other analysis that Peele wrote the first act and the first two scenes in Act II of &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot;, with Shakespeare responsible for the rest.

==Minor works==

Among his occasional poems are &quot;The Honour of the Garter&quot;, which has a prologue containing Peele&#x27;s judgments on his contemporaries, and &quot;Polyhymnia&quot; (1590), a blank verse description of the ceremonies attending the retirement of the queen&#x27;s champion, Sir Henry Lee. This is concluded by the lyric poem, &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot;. This was written for the retirement ceremony in 1590 of Queen Elizabeth I&#x27;s champion knight in which he pledges undying loyalty to the queen, addressed as &quot;Goddess&quot;. It was quoted by Thackeray in the seventy-sixth chapter of &quot;The Newcomes&quot; and notably served as the title of Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s novel of the same name. To &quot;The Phoenix Nest&quot; in 1593 he contributed &quot;The Praise of Chastity&quot;.

==Reputation==
Peele belonged to the group of university scholars who, in Greene&#x27;s phrase, &quot;spent their wits in making playes.&quot; Greene went on to say that he was &quot;in some things rarer, in nothing inferior,&quot; to Christopher Marlowe and Thomas Nashe. This praise was not unfounded. The credit given to Greene and Marlowe for the increased dignity of English dramatic diction, and for the new smoothness infused into blank verse, must certainly be shared by Peele. The most familiar parts of Peele&#x27;s work are, however, the songs in his plays—from &quot;The Old Wives&#x27; Tale&quot; and &quot;The Arraignment of Paris,&quot; and the song &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot;—which are regularly anthologized.

Professor Francis Barton Gummere, in a critical essay prefixed to his edition of &quot;The Old Wives Tale&quot;, puts in another claim for Peele. In the contrast between the romantic story and the realistic dialogue he sees the first instance of humour quite foreign to the comic business of earlier comedy. &quot;The Old Wives Tale&quot; is a play within a play, slight enough to be perhaps better described as an interlude. Its background of rustic folklore gives it additional interest, and there is much fun poked at Gabriel Harvey and Richard Stanyhurst. Perhaps Huanebango, who parodies Harvey&#x27;s hexameters, and actually quotes him on one occasion, may be regarded as representing that arch-enemy of Greene and his friends.

Peele&#x27;s &quot;Works&quot; were edited by Alexander Dyce (1828, 1829–1839 and 1861), A. H. Bullen (2 vols., 1888), and by Charles Tyler Prouty (3 vols., 1952–1970). An examination of the metrical peculiarities of his work is to be found in Richard Lämmerhirt&#x27;s &quot;Georg Peele, Untersuchungen über sein Leben und seine Werke&quot; (Rostock, 1882). See also Professor F.B. Gummere, in &quot;Representative English Comedies&quot; (1903); and an edition of &quot;The Battell of Alcazar&quot;, printed for the Malone Society in 1907.

<text>The Cathedral Church of Saint Martin, Leicester, commonly known as Leicester Cathedral, is a Church of England cathedral in Leicester, England and the seat of the Bishop of Leicester. The church was elevated to a collegiate church in 1922 and made a cathedral in 1927 following the establishment of a new Diocese of Leicester in 1926.

The remains of King Richard III were reburied in the cathedral in 2015 after being discovered nearby in the foundations of the lost Greyfriars chapel, 530 years after his death.

==History==
Leicester Cathedral is near the centre of Leicester&#x27;s medieval Old Town. The Cathedral famously houses King Richard III&#x27;s tomb.

The church was built on the site of Roman ruins and is dedicated to St Martin of Tours, a 4th-century Roman officer who became a Bishop.  It is almost certainly one of six churches referred to in the Domesday Book (1086) and portions of the current building can be traced to a 12th-century Norman church which was rebuilt in the 13th and 15th centuries. In the Middle Ages, its site next to Leicester&#x27;s Guild Hall, ensured that St Martin&#x27;s became Leicester&#x27;s Civic Church with strong ties to the merchants and guilds of the town.

Much of the extant building is predominantly Victorian. This included the building of the tower (completed in 1862) and 220-foot spire (1867) by the architect Raphael Brandon. The work on this was in the correct Early English style, although his work elsewhere in the church was in the perpendicular style. The tower and spire are, according to Pevsner, &quot;intentionally impressive&quot; and loosely based on the Church of St Mary the Virgin, Ketton in Rutland.

In 1927, St Martin&#x27;s was dedicated as Leicester&#x27;s Cathedral when the diocese was re-created, over 1,000 years after the last Anglo-Saxon Bishop of Leicester fled from the invading Danes.

Today over one hundred thousand people visit Leicester Cathedral every year, primarily to see the tomb of King Richard III, the last English monarch to die in battle. King Richard&#x27;s mortal remains were interred by Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, in March 2015 after five days of commemoration events and activities around the city and county of Leicester. A magnificent tomb cut of a single piece of Swaledale fossil stone weighing 3 tonnes now covers his grave.

Inside, on permanent exhibition, is the Pall, a decorative cloth which covered King Richard&#x27;s coffin during his reinterment. It was designed and created by artist Jacquie Binns. The embroidery tells the story of King Richard&#x27;s life and the discovery of his body in a car park very near to the cathedral.
Other items that can be seen inside the Cathedral include 14th-century wooden carved figures, each “afflicted” with some kind of illness. One has a medieval hearing aid, while another is suffering from sore shoulders.

A church dedicated to St Martin has been on the site for about 900 years, being first recorded in 1086 when the older Anglo-Saxon church was replaced by a Norman one. The present building dates to about that age, with the addition of a spire and various restorations throughout the years. Most of what can be seen today is a Victorian restoration by architect Raphael Brandon. The cathedral of the former Anglo-Saxon diocese of Leicester was on a different site.

A cenotaph memorial stone to Richard III was until recently located in the chancel; it was replaced by the tomb of the King himself. The monarch, killed in 1485 at the Leicestershire battlefield of Bosworth Field, had been roughly interred in the Greyfriars, Leicester. His remains were exhumed from the Greyfriars site in 2012, and publicly confirmed as his following DNA testing in February 2013. Peter Soulsby, Mayor of Leicester, and David Monteith, the cathedral&#x27;s canon chancellor, announced the King&#x27;s body would be re-interred in Leicester Cathedral in 2015. This was carried out on 26 March.

The East Window was installed as a monument to those who died in World War I. The highest window contains a sun-like orb with cherubs radiating away from it. In the centre Jesus sits holding a starry heaven in one hand with one foot on a bloody hell. Surrounding Jesus are eight angels whose wings are made from a red glass. To the far right stands St Michael the Archangel, who stands on the tail of a dragon. The dragon goes behind Jesus and can be seen re-emerging under the feet of St George who stands on its head. On the bottom row it can be seen from left St Joan of Arc, Mary, Jesus with crying angels, Mary Magdalene, James, and St Martin of Tours. The window includes an image of a World War I soldier.

The tower and spire were restored both internally and externally in 2004–5. The main work was to clean and replace any weak stonework. The cost was up to £600,000, with £200,000 being donated by the English Heritage, and the rest raised through public donations.

The cathedral has close links with Leicester Grammar School which used to be located directly next to it. Morning assemblies would take place each week on different days depending on the school&#x27;s year groups, and services were attended by its pupils. The relationship continues despite the school&#x27;s move to Great Glen, about seven miles south of Leicester.

In 2011, after extensive refurbishment, the cathedral&#x27;s offices moved to the former site of Leicester Grammar School, and the building was renamed St Martin&#x27;s House. The choir song school also relocated to the new building, and the new site also offers conference rooms and other facilities that can be hired out. The new building was officially opened by the Bishop of Leicester in 2011.

In July 2014, the cathedral completed a redesign of its gardens, including installation of the 1980 statue of Richard III. Following a judicial review decision in favour of Leicester, plans were made to reinter Richard III&#x27;s remains in Leicester Cathedral, including a new tomb and a wider reordering of the cathedral interior. Reinterment took place on 26 March 2015 in the presence of Sophie, Countess of Wessex (representing Queen Elizabeth II) and Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester.

On 13 April 2017, Queen Elizabeth II distributed Maundy money in the cathedral to 182 recipients.

In 2022, archaeological excavations began, led by the University of Leicester team which discovered the remains of Richard III, of a burial ground going back to the late Anglo-Saxon period on the site of the Old Song School as part of the Leicester Cathedral Revealed project to build a new heritage and educational centre.

In March 2023, a 1,800 year-old Roman era stone altar was discovered in the grounds of the cathedral by the University of Leicester.

==Architecture==

Leicester Cathedral is a Grade II* listed building comprising a large nave and chancel with two chancel chapels, along with a 220-foot-tall spire which was added in 1862. The building has undergone various restoration projects over the centuries, including work by the Victorian architect Raphael Brandon, and the building appears largely Gothic in style today. Inside the cathedral, the large wooden screen separating the nave from the chancel was designed by Charles Nicholson and carved by Bowman of Stamford. In 2015 the screen was moved eastward to stand in front of the tomb of Richard III, as part of the reordering of the chancel by van Heyningen and Haward Architects.

===Vaughan Porch===
The Vaughan Porch which is situated at the south side of the church was designed by J. L. Pearson, who was also the architect of Truro Cathedral. It is named the Vaughan Porch because it was erected in memory of the Vaughans who served successively as vicars throughout a great part of the nineteenth century. The front of the porch depicts seven saintly figures set in sandstone niches, all of whom are listed below.

*Guthlac c 673–713 was a Christian saint from Lincolnshire who lived when Leicester was first made a diocese in the year 680
*Hugh of Lincoln c 1135–1200 was a French monk who founded a Carthusian monastery and worked on the rebuilding of Lincoln Cathedral after an earthquake destroyed it in 1185. In Norman times Leicester was situated within the Diocese of Lincoln.
*Robert Grosseteste c 1175–1253 was an English statesman, scholastic philosopher, theologian, scientist and Bishop of Lincoln. He is also the most famous of the medieval Archdeacons of Leicester.
*John Wycliffe c 1329–1384 was an Oxford scholar and is famous for encouraging two of his followers to translate the Bible into English. Foxe&#x27;s famous &quot;Book of Martyrs&quot; (which commemorates the Protestant heroes of the reformation era) begins with John Wycliffe.
*Henry Hastings c 1535–1595 was the 3rd Earl of Huntingdon. The Leicester home of the Earls of Huntingdon was in Lord&#x27;s Place off the High Street in Leicester, and Mary, Queen of Scots stayed there as a prisoner on her journey to Coventry.
*William Chillingworth 1602–1644 was an Oxford theologian, a friend of Jeremy Taylor and nephew of Archbishop Laud. He was Master of Wyggeston Hospital and became a Chaplain to the Royalist army in the Civil War.
*William Connor Magee 1821–1891 was Bishop of Peterborough and encouraged the building of many of Leicester&#x27;s famous Victorian churches and a large number of parochial schools. He appointed the first suffragan Bishop of Leicester, Francis Thichnesse, in 1888. Magee later became Archbishop of York.

===Chapels===
The cathedral contains four separate chapels, three of which are dedicated to a different saint. St Katharine&#x27;s and St Dunstan&#x27;s Chapels act as side chapels and are used occasionally for smaller services and vigils. St George&#x27;s Chapel, which is located at the back (or west) of the cathedral commemorates the armed services, and contains memorials to those from Leicestershire who have been killed in past conflicts. The new Chapel of Christ the King adjoins the East Window.

St Katharine&#x27;s Chapel is located on the north side of the cathedral to the left of the sanctuary. In the window above the altar is St Katharine, who was tied to a wheel and tortured (hence the firework named after her). Below this is a carved panel showing Jesus on the cross with Mary and John on either side of him. St Francis of Assisi and the 17th-century poet Robert Herrick are also pictured – indeed, the chapel is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Herrick Chapel&quot;.

St Dunstan&#x27;s Chapel, located on the other side of the chancel to St Katharine&#x27;s Chapel, is specially put aside for people to pray in. A candle burns in a hanging lamp to show that the sacrament of Christ&#x27;s body and blood is kept here to take to those who are too ill to come to church. The walls of the chapel are covered with memorials to people who have prayed in the chapel. St Dunstan was Archbishop of Canterbury in the 10th century, and scenes from his life are depicted in the south-east window.

St George&#x27;s Chapel was the chapel of the Guild of St George. The effigy of England&#x27;s national saint, on a horse, was kept here and borne through the streets annually on 23 April in a procession known as &quot;riding the George&quot;. The legend of George killing a dragon is shown in one of the chapel&#x27;s windows. The chapel, enclosed by a carved wooden screen, was reconstructed in 1921 and contains memorials to the men of the Royal Leicestershire Regiment. Here the battle honours of the Regiment and the names of those killed in the Crimean, South African and two World Wars are recorded and remembered.

The new Chapel of Christ the King was created at the east end of the cathedral as part of the re-ordering work for the burial of Richard III.

==Services==
Leicester Cathedral follows the rites of the Church of England and uses Common Worship for the main Choral Eucharist on Sunday.

==Choir==
The Leicester Cathedral Choir is made up of the Boys Choir, the Girls Choir and the Cathedral Songmen. Boys and girls are recruited from schools throughout Leicester and Leicestershire, whilst many of the songmen originally joined the choir as trebles and have stayed on after their voice broke. The cathedral also offers scholarships worth around £1000 a year to gap year and university students at Leicester University and De Montfort University. Whilst the choir occasionally produces CDs and other recordings, it is also one of the few cathedral choirs apparently never to have appeared on BBC Radio 3&#x27;s &quot;Choral Evensong&quot; although it broadcast Choral Evensong several times in the days when the programme used to go out on the BBC Home Service. As part of the preparations for the reburial of Richard III at Leicester Cathedral, British furniture designers Luke Hughes designed new choir and clergy furniture from solid oak for a new choral layout within the nave.

The choir participates in regular festivals, with the annual RSCM Leicestershire festival in September often taking place in the cathedral itself. Each year during February the choir joins those of Derby and Coventry cathedrals and, more recently, Southwell Minster for what is known as the Midlands Four Choirs Festival. Hosting duties rotate among the four cathedrals, although the repertoire is chosen, and music conducted, by the directors of music of all participating choirs.

===Choir tours===
The cathedral choir tours abroad typically once every three to four years, and in both 1998 and 2005 they visited Japan. Other destinations abroad have included Rhode Island in the United States, Germany, and France. In other years, the choir has spent a week during the summer in residence at another English cathedral church, such as Lincoln, Wells, York and Chester. The boys and girls choirs, as well as the younger songmen also spend five days in August at Launde Abbey, a retreat house in east Leicestershire.

==Organ and organists==

==Tomb of Richard III==

In August 2012, the Richard III Society, spurred by the work of Philippa Langley, Leicester City Council and the University of Leicester began a search underneath a car park in Leicester, to find King Richard III&#x27;s remains.

On 26 March 2015, Richard III was reburied in Leicester Cathedral. The last burial of an English monarch prior to this was 43 years earlier, for Edward VIII, who abdicated and became Duke of Windsor, in 1972.

The cathedral tomb was designed by van Heyningen and Haward Architects and made by James Elliott. The tombstone features a cross deeply incised into a rectangular block of pale Swaledale fossil stone quarried in North Yorkshire. It rests on a low plinth of dark Kilkenny limestone which is incised with Richard&#x27;s name, dates and motto, carved by Gary Breeze and Stuart Buckle; and which carries his coat of arms in pietra dura by Thomas Greenaway.

The remains of Richard III are in a lead ossuary inside an English oak coffin crafted by Michael Ibsen, a direct descendant of Richard&#x27;s sister Anne of York. The coffin lies in a brick-lined vault below the floor, under the plinth and tombstone.

He married Verity in 1965; they had three daughters called Vanella, Harriet (a wildlife artist) and Miranda.

==Education==
Educated at Aldenham School, Hertfordshire, he began, but failed to complete, a degree in mathematics at Peterhouse, Cambridge.

==Migration and ringing==

An acknowledged expert on bird migration, Mead worked for the BTO for more than 40 years, from 1961. For most of that time (33 years) he worked in the BTO&#x27;s Ringing Unit. In his lifetime, he caught and ringed over 400,000 birds of some 350 species in 18 countries. He was head of Britain&#x27;s National Ringing Scheme.

==Nightingales==
To raise funds for the BTO&#x27;s nightingale research, Mead devised a CD of poetry, and nightingale song (including several historic archive recordings) &quot;Nightingales: A Celebration&quot; with an accompanying book by Richard Mabey.

==Retirement==
In 1995, ill health brought about his early, and supposed, &quot;retirement&quot;, after which he became the BTO&#x27;s media consultant, regularly being interviewed on radio and in the press.

==Awards==
Mead may be unique in being given each of the following UK awards for ornithology:
*The British Ornithologists&#x27; Union&#x27;s &quot;Union Medal&quot; (1996)
*The BTO &quot;Bernard Tucker Medal&quot; (1997)
*The &quot;RSPB Medal&quot; (1999; for his achievements in the causes of wild bird protection and countryside conservation)

==Memorial==
Following Mead&#x27;s death, his family and the BTO decided to use the many proffered donations, and a Heritage Lottery Fund grant, to develop the BTO&#x27;s library, and rename it &quot;The Chris Mead Library&quot;.

A memorial day for Mead was held at the BTO&#x27;s headquarters, &quot;The Nunnery&quot;, on 5 May 2003.
Mead was also remembered in a special edition of BBC Radio 4 wildlife programme &quot;Nature&quot; on 12 May 2003 (available on-line, see below).

<text>Richard Stanyhurst (or Stanihurst) (1547–1618) was an Anglo-Irish alchemist, translator, poet and historian, who was born in Dublin.

==Life==
His father, James Stanyhurst, was Recorder of Dublin, and Speaker of the Irish House of Commons in 1557, 1560 and 1568. His grandfather was Nicholas Stanihurst, Mayor of Dublin in 1543. His mother was Anne Fitzsimon, daughter of Thomas Fitzsimon, Recorder of Dublin. Richard was sent to Peter White&#x27;s Kilkenny College after which, in 1563, he continued to University College, Oxford, where he took his degree five years later. At Oxford, he became intimate with Edmund Campion. After leaving the university he studied law at Furnival&#x27;s Inn and Lincoln&#x27;s Inn. He contributed in 1587 to &quot;Holinshed&#x27;s Chronicles&quot; &quot;a playne and perfecte description&quot; of Ireland, and a &quot;History of Ireland during the reign of Henry VIII&quot;, which were severely criticized in Barnabe Rich&#x27;s &quot;New Description of Ireland&quot; (1610) as a misrepresentation of Irish affairs written from the English standpoint. They also caused offence to Catholics for their anti-Catholic perspective. After the death of his wife, Janet Barnewall, daughter of Sir Christopher Barnewall (whom he praised warmly in his contribution to Holinshed), in 1579, Stanyhurst went to the Netherlands. After his second marriage, which took place before 1585, to Helen Copley, he became active in the Catholic cause. He lived in the bishopric of Liège, where he got in touch with the Paracelsan movement gathered around Ernest of Bavaria (1554–1612). From then, Stanyhurst analysed the relationships between medicine and chemistry.

In the early 1590s, he was invited to Spain by King Philip II, who became seriously ill. Stanyhurst worked at the great alchemical laboratory in El Escorial. At the same time, he informed the state of Catholics&#x27; interest in England. After his wife&#x27;s death in 1602 he took holy orders, and became chaplain to the Archduke Albert of Austria in the Netherlands. He had two sons, Peter and William Stanyhurst, both of whom became Jesuits.

He never returned to England, and died at Brussels, according to Anthony à Wood.

==Works==
Stanyhurst translated into English &quot;The First Foure Bookes of Virgil his Aeneis&quot; (Leiden, 1582), to give practical proof of the feasibility of Gabriel Harvey&#x27;s theory that classical rules of prosody could be successfully applied to English poetry. The translation is considered by the 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica an unconscious burlesque of the original in a jargon arranged in what the writer called hexameters. Thomas Nashe in his preface to Greene&#x27;s &quot;Menaphon&quot; ridiculed this performance as his

This is a parody, but not a very extravagant one, of Stanyhurst&#x27;s vocabulary and metrical methods.

Only two copies of the original Leiden edition of Stanyhurst&#x27;s translation of Virgil are known to be in existence. In this edition, his orthographical cranks are preserved. A reprint in 1583 by Henry Bynneman forms the basis of James Maidment&#x27;s edition (Edinburgh, 1836), and of Edward Arber&#x27;s reprint (1880), which contains an excellent introduction. Stanyhurst&#x27;s Latin works include &quot;De rebus in Hibernia gestis&quot; (Antwerp, 1584) and a life of St Patrick (1587).

A new edition of Stanyhurst&#x27;s controversial Latin history of Ireland was created in 2013 by Hiram Morgan and John Barry for Cork University Press under the title, &quot;Great Deeds in Ireland: Richard Stanyhurst&#x27;s De Rebus in Hibernia Gestis&quot;. This work is a product of the Centre for Neo-Latin Studies at University College Cork.

<text>Stephen Lisle Carter (born October 26, 1954) is an American legal scholar who serves as the William Nelson Cromwell Professor of Law at Yale Law School. He writes on legal and social issues.

==Early life and education==
Carter was born in Washington, D.C., the second of his parents&#x27; five children. He was raised in a family committed to public service. His mother worked as an executive assistant for Julian Bond and M. Carl Holman of the National Urban Coalition. An attorney turned administrator, his father was executive director of the Washington Urban League, and later a vice president at Cornell University. Carter&#x27;s grandfather was a successful dentist in Harlem and his grandmother, Eunice Hunton Carter, was the first black woman to be a district attorney in New York state. His great-grandmother was the suffragist and activist Addie Waites Hunton.

Carter graduated from Ithaca High School in 1972, and his essay &quot;The Best Black&quot; is based in part on his experiences there. At Ithaca High School, he was the editor-in-chief of &quot;The Tattler&quot;, and pushed hard for student representation on the local school board.

Carter earned his B.A. in history from Stanford University in 1976. At Stanford he served as managing editor for &quot;The Stanford Daily&quot;. Carter received a J.D. from Yale Law School in 1979. At Yale, he won the prize for best oralist in the Thurmond Arnold Moot Court Competition and served as a note editor on the &quot;Yale Law Journal&quot;.

==Legal career==
Following graduation from Yale, Carter served as a law clerk for Judge Spottswood W. Robinson III of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and, subsequently, for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall from 1980 to 1981.

Currently, Carter is the William Nelson Cromwell Professor of Law at Yale Law School, where he has taught since 1982. At Yale, he teaches courses on contracts, evidence, professional responsibility, ethics in literature, intellectual property, and the law and ethics of war.

Carter has received eight honorary degrees, including Bates College, Colgate University, Hamilton College, and the University of Notre Dame. In 1994, he delivered the commencement speech at Stanford University.

==Writing career==
Carter&#x27;s non-fiction books have received praise from voices across the political spectrum, from Marion Wright Edelman to John Joseph O&#x27;Connor. Carter&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The Emperor of Ocean Park&quot;, spent 11 weeks on the &quot;New York Times&quot; best-seller list in 2002. It won both the 2003 Anisfield-Wolf Book Award (Fiction) and the 2003 BCALA Literary Award, from the Black Caucus of the American Library Association., with further nominations for the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Literary Work, Fiction, the CWA New Blood Dagger from the Crime Writer&#x27;s Association, and the 2002 Los Angeles Times Book Prize, in the mystery/thriller category.

His second novel, &quot;New England White&quot;, and third, &quot;Palace Council&quot;, form a trilogy of sorts with &quot;The Emperor of Ocean Park&quot;, all being set in the fictional New England town of Elm Harbor, with some characters from each book appearing in the others.

His fourth novel, &quot;Jericho&#x27;s Fall&quot;, was published in July 2009. His book, &quot;The Violence of Peace: America&#x27;s Wars in the Age of Obama&quot;, was published in 2011. In August 2014, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; tagged Carter&#x27;s &quot;Back Channel&quot; as one of &quot;five new crime novels worth a read.&quot;

Carter&#x27;s work is seen frequently on the op-ed pages of major newspapers. In addition to his policy writings and novels, Carter for several years wrote a feature column in &quot;Christianity Today&quot; magazine, and he has been quoted in the media on religion in public life. He is currently a Bloomberg View columnist at Bloomberg.com.

==Personal==
Carter was raised in Harlem, in Washington, D.C., and in Ithaca, New York. He and his wife, Enola G. Aird, have two children. They reside in Connecticut and summer in Martha&#x27;s Vineyard. They attend St. Luke&#x27;s Episcopal Church, one of the oldest predominantly black Episcopal churches in the country.

<text>Barnabe Rich (also Barnaby Riche) (c. 1540 – 10 November 1617) was an English author and soldier, and a distant relative of Lord Chancellor Rich.

==Life==
He fought in the Low Countries, rising to the rank of captain, and afterwards served in Ireland. He shared in the colonization of Ulster, and spent the latter part of his life near Dublin. In the intervals of his campaigns he produced many pamphlets on political questions and romances. In 1606 he was in receipt of a pension of half a crown a day, and in 1616 he was presented with a gift of £100 as being the oldest captain in the service.

==Works==
His best-known work is &quot;Riche His Farwell to the Militarie Profession | Riche his Farewell to Militarie Profession conteining verie pleasaunt discourses fit for a peaceable tyme&quot; (1581). Of the eight stories contained in it, five, he says, are forged only for delight, neither credible to be believed, nor hurtful to be perused. The three others are translations from the Italian. He claims as his own invention the story of Apolonius and Silla, the second in the collection, from which Shakespeare took the plot of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;. It is, however, founded on the tale of Nicuola and Lattantio as told by Matteo Bandello. The eighth, Phylotus and Emilia, a complicated story arising from the likeness and disguise of a brother and sister, is identical in plot with the anonymous play, &quot;Philotus&quot;, printed in Edinburgh in 1603. Both play and story were edited for the Bannatyne Club in 1835, by David Irving.

In the conclusion to his collection Rich tells a story of a devil named Balthasar, who possesses a king of Scots, prudently changed after the accession of James I to the Grand Turk. &quot;The Strange and Wonderful Adventures of Don Simonides, a Gentleman Spaniard&quot; (1581), with its sequel &quot;The Second Tome of the Travels and Adventures of Don Simonides&quot; (1584), is written in imitation of Lyly. Among his other romances should be mentioned &quot;The Adventures of Brusanus, Prince of Hungaria&quot; (1592).

His authenticated works number twenty-four, and include works on Ireland, the troubles of which were, according to him, due to the religion of the people and to the lack of consistency and firmness on the part of the English government. Such are: &quot;Allarme to England&quot; (1578); &quot;A New Description of Ireland&quot; (1610); and &quot;The Irish Hubbub, or the English Hue and Crie&quot; (1617), in which he also inveighs against the use of tobacco.

<text>BBC Kids was a Canadian specialty television channel carrying programming for children and teenagers. It was a joint venture between Knowledge West Communications, which managed the network and held the majority 80% interest and was a subsidiary of Knowledge Network, with BBC Studios licensing the BBC brand and holding the remaining 20% in the joint venture. Originally an ad-supported network, it transitioned to non-commercial operation when it was transferred to Knowledge.

==History==
===Launch===

In November 2000, Alliance Atlantis was granted approval by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to launch BBC Kids, described as &quot;a national English language Category 2 (what is the current category B) specialty television service devoted to top-quality educational and entertaining programming for children and youth (ages 2-17). It will feature programming primarily from the UK and around the world. 65% of the programming will target children ages 2 to 7, and 35% will target youth ages 8 to 17.&quot;

The channel launched on November 5, 2001 as a joint venture between Alliance Atlantis and BBC Worldwide, the BBC&#x27;s overseas operating arm. As was its remit, it primarily sourced its programming from networks and producers from the United Kingdom, though its programming sources were never exclusively limited to those of the BBC. This also included international co-productions, including &quot;Tots TV&quot;, &quot;Mr. Bean: The Animated Series&quot;, and Australian &quot;The Sleepover Club&quot;. It also broadcast a small amount of Canadian and Anglo-Canadian co-productions (including past-produced Alliance programming co-produced with a U.S. network such as PBS, Disney Channel, or Viacom&#x27;s Nickelodeon for U.S. broadcast) to meet CRTC Canadian content regulations and quotas.

===Transition from Alliance Atlantis to Knowledge Network===
On January 18, 2008, a joint venture between Canwest and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners known as CW Media, acquired control of BBC Kids through its purchase of Alliance Atlantis&#x27; broadcasting assets, which were placed in a trust in August 2007. It then became a part of Shaw Communications on October 10, 2010 after it acquired Canwest outright with the GSCP stake in CW Media.

Shaw&#x27;s ownership would be short-lived due to regulatory requirements to sell some former CW Media assets, and that process started on December 22, 2010 with early due diligence with a then-undisclosed sales partner. On January 17, 2011, Knowledge Network Corporation, a Crown corporation of the Government of British Columbia, announced it had finalized an agreement to purchase the channel through a subsidiary called Knowledge-West Communications Corporation from Shaw Media. BBC Worldwide would retain its existing interest. The sale was completed on April 29, 2011, and with it and CRTC approval, it converted from a commercial network to a non-commercial service, while relocating operations from Toronto to Burnaby in suburban Vancouver.

The transaction resulted in a decision by cable providers in The Bahamas and Jamaica (which generally import Canadian channels onto their services for the convenience of snowbirds visiting the West Indies) to drop the network at the end of 2011.

===Closure===
On October 2, 2018, a joint statement from Knowledge Network and BBC announced the channel would cease operations at the stroke of midnight on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2018. Though there was no reasoning for the closure said originally, then-Knowledge chief Rudy Buttignol subsequently cited the end of the CRTC&#x27;s traditional protection of small and independent networks to allow for broader discretionary services without any programming restrictions. Knowledge continues to carry programming from the BBC, and CBBC/CBeebies programming as a part of Knowledge Kids, including programming from BBC Kids merged onto the Knowledge schedule. On January 10, 2019, the CRTC revoked the channel&#x27;s license at the request of Knowledge.

Sources further mentioned that around 850 AD, the Khmers occupied the area and established a stronghold there, named it as Ayodhya after one of the holiest Hindu cities of India of the same name. Early history of Ayutthaya is historically connected to this Khmer settlement. Consistently, Prince Damrong also agreed that there was a city called Ayodhya which was found by the Khmers ruling from Lopburi at the point where the three rivers meet. Excavation map shows the traces from an ancient baray (water reservoir) close to the southwestern tip of Wat Yai Chai Mongkhon which could has been built on a former important Khmer temple complex.

Ayutthaya was the capital of Thailand (then called Siam) for 417 years from 1350, until in Burmese–Siamese War (1765–1767), it was sacked by the Burmese army in 1767. During this era, now usually referred as the Ayutthaya period or Ayutthaya kingdom, Ayutthaya was ruled by 33 kings of five different dynasties. The kingdom became a major regional player, and a trade center of the East, a meeting point of European merchants and Asian traders. Notable monarchs during the Ayutthaya period include King Naresuan the Great, who liberated Ayutthaya from the first Burmese occupation and embarked on a reign of conquest, and King Narai the Great, who initiated diplomatic relations with France, during the reign of Louis XIV. His reign was the golden age of trade and culture.

The city was strategically positioned. During several months of the year, the flood plains around the cities would be flooded by the many rivers around the city. Enemy sieges were thus impossible, and forced to withdraw. This advantage was a contributing factor in the many failed Burmese invasions.

The ruins of the old capital in the Ayutthaya historical park have been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since December 1991. The province is also home to the Bang Pa-in summer palace complex.

Originally named Krung Kao (กรุงเก่า), the province was renamed Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya in 1926.
== Symbols ==
According to legend, King Ramathibodi I found a beautiful conch shell buried in the ground, and chose the site as the place for his capital. He then placed the shell on a pedestal tray and built a pavilion around it. The seal shows this pavilion with the provincial tree behind it.

The provincial flower is the ดอกโสน () &quot;Sesbania aculeata&quot;, and the provincial tree is the fragrant manjack (&quot;Cordia dichotoma&quot;). The giant river prawn (&quot;Macrobrachium rosenbergii&quot;) is the provincial aquatic life. The provincial slogan ราชธานีเก่า อู่ข้าวอู่น้ำ เลิศล้ำกานท์กวี คนดีศรีอยุธยา เลอคุณค่ามรดกโลก can be translated as &quot;The old capital, a land flowing with milk and honey, excellent literature, the good people of Ayutthaya, the treasured world heritage&quot;.

<doc id="353990" wikidata="Q542460" url="?curid=353990" title="Angora wool">
<text>Angora hair or Angora fibre is the downy coat produced by the Angora rabbit. While the names of the source animals are similar, Angora fibre is distinct from mohair, which comes from the Angora goat. The cloth produced has sometimes been named Angola fabric. Angora fibre is also distinct from cashmere, which comes from the cashmere goat. Angora is known for its softness, thin fibres, and what knitters refer to as a halo (fluffiness). It is also known for its silky texture. It is much warmer and lighter than wool due to the hollow core of the angora fibre. It also gives the wool its characteristic floating feel.

Angora rabbits produce coats in a variety of colours, from white through tan, grey, and brown to black. Good quality Angora fibre is around 12–16 micrometres in diameter, and can cost as much as US. It felts very easily, even on the animal itself if it is not groomed frequently.

Yarns of 100% angora are typically used as accents. They have the most halo and warmth, but can felt very easily through abrasion and humidity and can be excessively warm in a finished garment. The fibre is normally blended with wool to give the yarn elasticity, as Angora fibre is not naturally elastic. The blend decreases the softness and halo as well as the price of the finished object. Commercial knitting yarns typically use 30–50% angora, in order to produce some halo, warmth, and softness without the side effects of excessive felting.
==Angora rabbit==

There are four different types of Angora recognized by the American Rabbit Breeders&#x27; Association: English, French, Satin, and Giant. There are many other breeds, one of the more common being German. Each breed produces different quality and quantity of fibre, and has a different range of colours.

==Fur production==
90% of Angora fur is produced in China, although Europe, Chile and the United States also produce small quantities. In China, there are more than 50 million Angora rabbits, growing per year. Harvesting occurs up to three times a year (about every 4 months) and is collected by plucking or shearing of the moulting fur.

Most breeds of Angora rabbits moult with their natural growth cycle about every four months. Many producers of the fibre pluck the fur of these breeds. Plucking is, in effect, pulling out the moulted fur. Plucking ensures a minimum of guard hair, and the fur is not as matted when plucked as when it is collected from the rabbit&#x27;s cage. However, plucking a rabbit is time-consuming, so some producers shear the rabbit instead. While this results in slightly lower quality fleece, as the guard hairs are included, it does take less time and results in more fleece. Also, not all breeds of Angora moult, and if the rabbit does not naturally moult, it cannot be plucked. German Angoras do not moult.

The rabbits must be groomed at least once or twice a week to prevent the fur from matting and felting. There is also a danger a rabbit will ingest its own moulted fur; unlike a cat, a rabbit cannot easily be rid of the build up.

==Animal cruelty involved in wool production==
The animal rights organisation People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals argue that Angora wool comes from rabbits who suffer horrific abuse, especially on farms in China, which supplies 90% of the world’s angora. A PETA Asia investigation reported that rabbits scream in pain as their fur is violently ripped out every three months, leaving them shocked and motionless in filthy cages. Rabbits who are sheared are tightly restrained and often wounded as they struggle in terror. With no legal protections, the rabbits endure raw, inflamed feet, eye infections, and extreme psychological distress. Many die within two years, and males not used for breeding are killed at birth. After years of suffering, surviving rabbits are slaughtered for meat.

In 2013, several clothing retailers suspended the sourcing of products containing angora wool after video evidence surfaced of live rabbits with their paws tied being plucked raw in Chinese fur farms. Major retailers that banned angora products in response to welfare concerns include Hugo Boss, Gap Inc., Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, H&amp;M and Esprit.

In September 2016, French animal rights charity One Voice released disturbing footage from six angora rabbit farms across France. The videos depict the animals being pinned down with their front and hind legs spread apart, while workers pluck and rip the fur from their skin. In the video, the rabbits seem to vocalize pain, with the process leaving them completely bare except for their heads.

==Quality of wool==
The premium first quality wool is taken from the back and upper sides of the rabbit. This is usually the longest and cleanest fibre on the rabbit. There should not be hay or vegetable matter in the fibre. Second quality is from the neck and lower sides, and may have some vegetable matter. Third quality is the buttocks and legs and any other areas that easily felt and are of shorter length. Fourth quality is totally unsalvageable, and consists of the larger felted bits or stained fibre. Third and fourth quality are perfect for cutting up for birds to use in lining their nests. With daily brushing, felting of the fibre can be avoided, increasing the usable portion of fibre.

== Uses ==
Angora wool is commonly used in apparel such as sweaters and suitings, knitting yarn, and felting.

<text>Crystal skulls are human skull hardstone carvings made of clear, milky white or other types of quartz (also called &quot;rock crystal&quot;), claimed to be pre-Columbian Mesoamerican artifacts by their alleged finders; however, these claims have been refuted for all of the specimens made available for scientific studies. The results of these studies demonstrated that those examined were manufactured in the mid-19th century or later, almost certainly in Europe, during a time when interest in ancient culture abounded. The skulls appear to have been crafted in Germany, quite likely at workshops in the town of Idar-Oberstein, which was renowned for crafting objects made from imported Brazilian quartz in the late 19th century.

Despite some claims presented in an assortment of popularizing literature, legends of crystal skulls with mystical powers do not figure in genuine Mesoamerican or other Native American mythologies and spiritual accounts. The skulls are often claimed to exhibit paranormal phenomena by some members of the New Age movement, and have often been portrayed as such in fiction. Crystal skulls have been a popular subject appearing in numerous science fiction television series, novels, films, and video games.

==Collections==
Trade in fake pre-Columbian artifacts developed during the late 19th century to the extent that in 1886, Smithsonian archaeologist William Henry Holmes wrote an article called &quot;The Trade in Spurious Mexican Antiquities&quot; for &quot;Science&quot;. Although museums had acquired skulls earlier, it was Eugène Boban, an antiquities dealer who opened his shop in Paris in 1870, who is most associated with 19th-century museum collections of crystal skulls. Most of Boban&#x27;s collection, including three crystal skulls, was sold to the ethnographer Alphonse Pinart, who donated the collection to the Trocadéro Museum, which later became the Musée de l&#x27;Homme.

==Research==
Many crystal skulls are claimed to be pre-Columbian, usually attributed to the Aztec or Maya civilizations. Mesoamerican art has numerous representations of skulls, but none of the skulls in museum collections come from documented excavations. Research carried out on several crystal skulls at the British Museum in 1967, 1996 and 2004 shows that the indented lines marking the teeth (for these skulls had no separate jawbone, unlike the Mitchell-Hedges skull) were carved using jeweler&#x27;s equipment (rotary tools) developed in the 19th century, making a pre-Columbian origin untenable.

The type of crystal was determined by examination of chlorite inclusions. It is only found in Madagascar and Brazil, and thus unobtainable or unknown within pre-Columbian Mesoamerica. The study concluded that the skulls were crafted in the 19th century in Germany, quite likely at workshops in the town of Idar-Oberstein, which was renowned for crafting objects made from imported Brazilian quartz in the late 19th century.

It has been established that the crystal skulls in the British Museum and Paris&#x27;s Musée de l&#x27;Homme were originally sold by the French antiquities dealer Eugène Boban, who was operating in Mexico City between 1860 and 1880. The British Museum crystal skull transited through New York&#x27;s Tiffany &amp; Co., while the Musée de l&#x27;Homme&#x27;s crystal skull was donated by Alphonse Pinart, an ethnographer who had bought it from Boban.

In 1992 the Smithsonian Institution investigated a crystal skull provided by an anonymous source; the source claimed to have purchased it in Mexico City in 1960, and that it was of Aztec origin. The investigation concluded that this skull also was made recently. According to the Smithsonian, Boban acquired his crystal skulls from sources in Germany, aligning with conclusions made by the British Museum.

The &quot;Journal of Archaeological Science&quot; published a detailed study by the British Museum and the Smithsonian in May 2008. Using electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, a team of British and American researchers found that the British Museum skull was worked with a harsh abrasive substance such as corundum or diamond, and shaped using a rotary disc tool made from some suitable metal. The Smithsonian specimen had been worked with a different abrasive, namely silicon carbide (carborundum), a silicon-carbon compound which is a synthetic substance manufactured using modern industrial techniques. Since the synthesis of carborundum dates only to the 1890s and its wider availability to the 20th century, the researchers concluded &quot;[t]he suggestion is that it was made in the 1950s or later&quot;.

==Individual skulls==

===British Museum skull===
The crystal skull of the British Museum first appeared in 1881, in the shop of the Paris antiquarian, Eugène Boban. Its origin was not stated in his catalogue of the time. He is said to have tried to sell it to Mexico&#x27;s national museum as an Aztec artifact, but was unsuccessful. Boban later moved his business to New York City, where the skull was sold to George H. Sisson. It was exhibited at the meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in New York City in 1887 by George F. Kunz. It was sold at auction, and bought by Tiffany and Co., who later sold it at cost to the British Museum in 1897.
This skull is very similar to the Mitchell-Hedges skull, although it is less detailed and does not have a movable lower jaw.

The British Museum catalogues the skull&#x27;s provenance as &quot;probably European, 19th century AD&quot; and describes it as &quot;not an authentic pre-Columbian artefact&quot;.
It has been established that this skull was made with modern tools, and that it is not authentic.

===Mitchell-Hedges skull===
Perhaps the most famous and enigmatic skull was allegedly discovered in 1924 by Anna Mitchell-Hedges, adopted daughter of British adventurer and popular author F. A. Mitchell-Hedges. It is the subject of a video documentary made in 1990, &quot;Crystal Skull of Lubaantun&quot;. It was examined and described by Smithsonian researchers as &quot;very nearly a replica of the British Museum skullalmost exactly the same shape, but with more detailed modeling of the eyes and the teeth&quot;.

Mitchell-Hedges claimed that she found the skull buried under a collapsed altar inside a temple in Lubaantun, in British Honduras, now Belize. As far as can be ascertained, F.A. Mitchell-Hedges himself made no mention of the alleged discovery in any of his writings on Lubaantun. Others present at the time of the excavation recorded neither the skull&#x27;s discovery nor Anna&#x27;s presence at the dig. Recent evidence has come to light showing that F.A. Mitchell-Hedges purchased the skull at a Sotheby&#x27;s auction in London on October 15, 1943, from London art dealer Sydney Burney. In December 1943, F. A. Mitchell-Hedges disclosed his purchase of the skull in a letter to his brother, stating plainly that he acquired it from Burney.

The skull is made from a block of clear quartz about the size of a small human cranium, measuring some high, long and wide. The lower jaw is detached. In the early 1970s it came under the temporary care of freelance art restorer Frank Dorland, who claimed upon inspecting it that it had been &quot;carved&quot; with total disregard to the natural crystal axis, and without the use of metal tools. Dorland reported being unable to find any tell-tale scratch marks, except for traces of mechanical grinding on the teeth, and he speculated that it was first chiseled into rough form, probably using diamonds, and the finer shaping, grinding and polishing was achieved through the use of sand over a period of 150 to 300 years. He said it could be up to 12,000 years old. Although various claims have been made over the years regarding the skull&#x27;s physical properties, such as an allegedly constant temperature of 70 °F (21 °C), Dorland reported that there was no difference in properties between it and other natural quartz crystals.

While in Dorland&#x27;s care the skull came to the attention of writer Richard Garvin, at the time working at an advertising agency where he supervised Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s advertising account. Garvin made arrangements for the skull to be examined at Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s crystal laboratories in Santa Clara, California, where it was subjected to several tests. The labs determined only that it was not a composite as Dorland had supposed, but that it was fashioned from a single crystal of quartz. The laboratory test also established that the lower jaw had been fashioned from the same left-handed growing crystal as the rest of the skull. No investigation was made by Hewlett-Packard as to its method of manufacture or dating.

As well as the traces of mechanical grinding on the teeth noted by Dorland, Mayanist archaeologist Norman Hammond reported that the holes (presumed to be intended for support pegs) showed signs of being made by drilling with metal. Anna Mitchell-Hedges refused subsequent requests to submit the skull for further scientific testing.

The earliest published reference to the skull is the July 1936 issue of the British anthropological journal &quot;Man&quot;, where it is described as being in the possession of Sydney Burney, a London art dealer who was said to have owned it since 1933, and from whom evidence suggests F.A. Mitchell-Hedges purchased it.

F. A. Mitchell-Hedges mentioned the skull only briefly in the first edition of his autobiography, &quot;Danger My Ally&quot; (1954), without specifying where or by whom it was found. He merely claimed that &quot;it is at least 3,600 years old and according to legend it was used by the High Priest of the Maya when he was performing esoteric rites. It is said that when he willed death with the help of the skull, death invariably followed&quot;. All subsequent editions of &quot;Danger My Ally&quot; omitted mention of the skull entirely.
In a 1970 letter Anna also stated that she was &quot;told by the few remaining Maya that the skull was used by the high priest to will death&quot;. For this reason, the artifact is sometimes referred to as &quot;The Skull of Doom&quot;. Anna Mitchell-Hedges toured with the skull from 1967 exhibiting it on a pay-per-view basis. Somewhere between 1988 and 1990 she toured with the skull. She continued to grant interviews about the artifact until her death.

In her last eight years, Anna Mitchell-Hedges lived in Chesterton, Indiana, with Bill Homann, whom she married in 2002. She died on April 11, 2007. Since that time the Mitchell-Hedges Skull has been owned by Homann. He continues to believe in its mystical properties.

In November 2007, Homann took the skull to the office of anthropologist Jane MacLaren Walsh, in the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Museum of Natural History for examination. Walsh carried out a detailed examination of the skull using ultraviolet light, a high-powered light microscope, and computerized tomography. Homann took the skull to the museum again in 2008 so it could be filmed for a Smithsonian Networks documentary, &quot;Legend of the Crystal Skull,&quot; and on this occasion, Walsh was able to take two sets of silicone molds of surface tool marks for scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis. The SEM micrographs revealed evidence that the crystal had been worked with a high speed, hard metal rotary tool coated with a hard abrasive, such as diamond. Walsh&#x27;s extensive research on artifacts from Mexico and Central America showed that pre-contact artisans carved stone by abrading the surface with stone or wooden tools, and in later pre-Columbian times, copper tools, in combination with a variety of abrasive sands or pulverized stone. These examinations led Walsh to the conclusion that the skull was probably carved in the 1930s, and was most likely based on the British Museum skull which had been exhibited fairly continuously from 1898.

In the National Geographic Channel documentary &quot;The Truth Behind the Crystal Skulls&quot;, forensic artist Gloria Nusse performed a forensic facial reconstruction over a replica of the skull. According to Nusse, the resulting face had female and European characteristics. As it was hypothesized that the Crystal Skull was a replica of an actual human skull, the conclusion was that it could not have been created by ancient Americans.

===Paris skull===

The largest of the three skulls sold by Eugène Boban to Alphonse Pinart (sometimes called the Paris Skull), about high, has a hole drilled vertically through its center. It is part of a collection held at the &quot;Musée du Quai Branly&quot;, and was subjected to scientific tests carried out in 2007–08 by France&#x27;s national &quot;Centre de recherche et de restauration des musées de France&quot; (Centre for Research and Restoration of the Museums in France, or C2RMF). After a series of analyses carried out over three months, C2RMF engineers concluded that it was &quot;certainly not pre-Columbian, it shows traces of polishing and abrasion by modern tools&quot;. Particle accelerator tests also revealed occluded traces of water that were dated to the 19th century, and the &quot;Quai Branly&quot; released a statement that the tests &quot;seem to indicate that it was made late in the 19th century&quot;.

In 2009 the C2RMF researchers published results of further investigations to establish when the Paris skull had been carved. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis indicated the use of lapidary machine tools in its carving. The results of a new dating technique known as quartz hydration dating (QHD) demonstrated that the Paris skull had been carved later than a reference quartz specimen artifact, known to have been cut in 1740. The researchers conclude that the SEM and QHD results combined with the skull&#x27;s known provenance indicate it was carved in the 18th or 19th century.

===Smithsonian Skull===
The &quot;Smithsonian Skull&quot;, Catalogue No. A562841-0 in the collections of the Department of Anthropology, National Museum of Natural History, was mailed to the Smithsonian Institution anonymously in 1992, and was claimed to be an Aztec object by its donor and was purportedly from the collection of Porfirio Diaz. It is the largest of the skulls, with a weight of and a height of . It was carved using carborundum, a modern abrasive. It has been displayed as a modern fake at the National Museum of Natural History.

==Paranormal claims and spiritual associations==
Some individuals believe in the paranormal claim that crystal skulls can produce a variety of miracles. Anna Mitchell-Hedges claimed that the skull she allegedly discovered could cause visions and cure cancer, that she once used its magical properties to kill a man, and that in another instance, she saw in it a premonition of the John F. Kennedy assassination.

In the 1931 play &quot;The Satin Slipper&quot; by Paul Claudel, King Philip II of Spain uses &quot;a death&#x27;s head made from a single piece of rock crystal&quot;, lit by &quot;a ray of the setting sun&quot;, to see the defeat of the Spanish Armada in its attack on the Kingdom of England.

Claims of the healing and supernatural powers of crystal skulls have had no support in the scientific community, which has found no evidence of any unusual phenomena associated with the skulls nor any reason for further investigation, other than the confirmation of their provenance and method of manufacture.

Another novel and historically unfounded speculation ties in the legend of the crystal skulls with the completion of the previous Maya calendar &quot;b&#x27;ak&#x27;tun&quot;-cycle on December 21, 2012, claiming the re-uniting of the thirteen mystical skulls will forestall a catastrophe allegedly predicted or implied by the ending of this calendar (see 2012 phenomenon). An airing of this claim appeared (among an assortment of others made) in &quot;The Mystery of the Crystal Skulls&quot;, a 2008 program produced for the Sci Fi Channel in May and shown on Discovery Channel Canada in June. Interviewees included Richard Hoagland, who attempted to link the skulls and the Maya to life on Mars, and David Hatcher Childress, proponent of lost Atlantean civilizations and anti-gravity claims.

Crystal skulls are also referred to by author Drunvalo Melchizedek in his book &quot;Serpent of Light&quot;. He writes that he came across indigenous Mayan descendants in possession of crystal skulls at ceremonies at temples in the Yucatán, which he writes contained souls of ancient Mayans who had entered the skulls to await the time when their ancient knowledge would once again be required.

The alleged associations and origins of crystal skull mythology in Native American spiritual lore, as advanced by neoshamanic writers such as Jamie Sams, are similarly discounted. Instead, as Philip Jenkins notes, crystal skull mythology may be traced back to the &quot;baroque legends&quot; initially spread by F.A. Mitchell-Hedges, and then afterwards taken up:

By the 1970s, the crystal skulls [had] entered New Age mythology as potent relics of ancient Atlantis, and they even acquired a canonical number: there were exactly thirteen skulls.

None of this would have anything to do with North American Indian matters, if the skulls had not attracted the attention of some of the most active New Age writers.

<text>The Point (&quot;Independent Radio, The Point&quot;) is a radio network operating in the state of Vermont. The flagship station is WNCS (104.7 FM) in Montpelier, which signed on in 1977. It was started by Jeb Spaulding who later served as Chancellor of the Vermont State Colleges, State Treasurer of Vermont, and Secretary of Administration under Vermont Governor Peter Shumlin. Although at that time there was no designated adult album alternative format, The Point&#x27;s programming format has been solidly adult album alternative/progressive rock for its entire history.

The Point has won numerous national awards over the course of its history, including trade publication &quot;Radio and Records&quot;″ AAA Station of the Year (markets 101+) in 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008, which was the publication&#x27;s final year of operation. In 2008, The Point was inducted into the trade publication &quot;FMQB&quot;″s Hall Of Fame for AAA Stations in markets 51 and smaller, and in 2013 The Point was named &quot;FMQB&quot;″s AAA Station of the Year (markets 50+).

==Frequencies==
The Point broadcasts on five FM stations. They are:

Notes:


All of the stations are owned by Montpelier Broadcasting Inc., which, in turn, is owned by Northeast Broadcasting, Inc., (based in Bedford, New Hampshire), which also owns WIXM and WWMP (and formerly owned WCAT) in Burlington; WSKI in Montpelier; and other stations in Andover, Massachusetts, and in Colorado, Idaho, and Wyoming.

===Former stations===
The Point was also carried by WRJT (103.1 FM) in Royalton, serving the White River Junction–Lebanon–Hanover area, from its 1996 sign on until its sale to the Educational Media Foundation (EMF) in 2020; it is now K-Love station WZKC. WRJT also operated translator W299AM (107.7 FM) in Lebanon, New Hampshire; that facility was retained by Northeast Broadcasting, and began carrying separately-owned WFRD in 2011. W299AM was itself sold to EMF&#x27;s successor, K-Love Inc., in 2025, and resumed carrying WZKC.

WFAD (1490 AM) and translator W266CU (101.1 FM) in Middlebury carried The Point in the early 2020s, prior to its 2022 sale to Christian Ministries.

<text>Elephant &amp; Castle is a London Underground station in the London Borough of Southwark in south London. It is on the Bank branch of the Northern line between Borough and Kennington stations. It is also the southern terminus of the Bakerloo line and the next station towards north is Lambeth North. The station is in both Travelcard Zones 1 and 2. The Northern line station was opened in 1890 by the City and South London Railway (C&amp;SLR) while the Bakerloo line station was opened sixteen years later by the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway (BS&amp;WR). There is an out-of-station interchange with the nearby Elephant &amp; Castle National Rail station.

A girl born at the station in 1924 was the first baby to be born on the Underground network. The Bakerloo line building remains much as originally constructed and is a typical Leslie Green structure. The Northern line building was designed by Thomas Phillips Figgis, and was rebuilt several times until the current structure opened in 2003. Transport for London (TfL) is currently planning a major upgrade to the station. A Bakerloo line extension south to Camberwell was planned and approved in 1931 but construction never started. Similar proposals have been revived on several occasions; in 2014 TfL ran a consultation on an extension to Hayes and Beckenham Junction, which is still under consideration.

==The station today==
===Geography===

Elephant &amp; Castle is located in the Elephant and Castle area of Newington in the London Borough of Southwark in central London. The station is in both Travelcard Zones 1 and 2 and is on the Bank branch of the Northern line between Kennington and Borough stations, and is the southern terminus of the Bakerloo line, the next station being Lambeth North. The station has two surface buildings, separated by a large traffic intersection. The northern building provides the most direct access to the Bakerloo line, while the southern one is linked more directly to the Northern line.

===Station buildings===
Access to the more northerly (Bakerloo) part of the station is via the original building, while the exit is via a new extension next to Skipton House. Between the entrance and two shops is the entrance to South London House, an office block above the station. The BS&amp;WR station building remains much as originally constructed and is a typical Leslie Green structure. The main alteration is a modern glass-sided and glass-topped flat-roofed extension abutting the original western elevation, giving access to three of the six arches. These arches, in a classic deep-red faience style, formed the original perimeter: two are infilled with street-facing shops. As the station also functions as a drivers&#x27; depot, London Underground uses the offices above the station for administration and drivers&#x27; accommodation.

The C&amp;SLR station was designed by Thomas Phillips Figgis in a similar style to Kennington station. It was partially rebuilt in the 1920s when the C&amp;SLR tunnels were modernised, and was rebuilt during the construction of the Elephant &amp; Castle shopping centre and roundabout in the 1960s. This Northern line ticket hall was rebuilt at the start of the 21st century, reopening on 12 December 2003 following 2 years of upgrade work.

Neither the Northern line nor Bakerloo line ticket halls have escalators. To get from either ticket hall to the platforms it is necessary to use the lifts or spiral stairs. The southern (Northern line) building has lifts from street level down to the level of the southbound Northern line platform, the only step-free platform at the station.
From inside the station, the northern exit is labelled &quot;London South Bank University&quot; and emerges at the southern tip of the triangular campus. The southern exit is labelled &quot;Shopping Centre&quot; and also leads to the National Rail station where there is an out-of-station interchange, allowing Oyster card and contactless payment card users to interchange while paying a single fare for their journey.

===Heritage feature and refurbishment===
The multi-coloured platform tiles on the Northern line were reconstructed in the 1920s in conjunction with an extension to Morden station. The tiles were carefully replicated in 2006 to replace the originals, which were in poor condition. The original C&amp;SLR tiles dating from 1890 remain on the tunnel roofs of the Northern line platforms, albeit now covered over by the new cable-management system. The station was refurbished in 2007. The original maroon and cream tiling on the Bakerloo line platforms has been covered over. Because of the arrangement of the lighting, cabling and public address loudspeakers, it was not possible to arrange the new roundels at alternate &#x27;low&#x27; and &#x27;high&#x27; positions, all being at the lower level.

==Services and connections==

===Bakerloo line===
Elephant &amp; Castle station is the southern terminus of the Bakerloo line and the next station is Lambeth North to the north. Trains heading northbound terminate at either Queen&#x27;s Park, Stonebridge Park or Harrow &amp; Wealdstone.

The typical service pattern in trains per hour (tph) is:
* 6tph to Harrow &amp; Wealdstone
* 3tph to Stonebridge Park
* 5tph to Queen&#x27;s Park

===Northern line===

On the Bank or City branch of the Northern line, Elephant &amp; Castle station is between Borough to the north and Kennington to the south. The typical off-peak service (as of January 2015) in trains per hour (tph) is 10tph northbound to each of High Barnet and Edgware and 20tph southbound to Morden.

===Connections===

A large number of London Buses routes serve the station day and night, stopping outside the station at either Newington Butts (Northern line entrance) or London Road (Bakerloo line entrance).

==History==

===Northern line===
Between 1883 and 1886, a route was planned by the City and South London Railway (C&amp;SLR), then known as the City of London &amp; Southwark Subway (CL&amp;SS), from King William Street via Elephant &amp; Castle to Stockwell and Clapham Common. The entire route was approved on 25 July 1890 and the station opened on 18 December 1890 as part of the first successful deep-level tube railway. It ran between King William Street and Stockwell.

In November 1891, the C&amp;SLR recognised the deficiencies of the section between Borough station and King William Street. A new route was chosen with a different pair of tunnels, avoiding this section. Near Borough, the new tunnels would branch off to London Bridge to form an interchange with the mainline station and then north through the City of London to Angel. The plan was approved on 24 August 1893 following a delay. The Act also incorporated another bill of 1893 to grant more time to build the southern extension to Clapham. The new route and the first section of the northern extension from Borough to Moorgate opened on 25 February 1900, and the King William Street diversion was closed. The southern extension to Clapham Common opened on 3 June 1900. Work continued on the rest of the northern extension and it opened on 17 November 1901.

In 1912, the C&amp;SLR submitted another bill to increase its capacity by enlarging its tunnels to the larger diameter used for the tunnels of the more recently built railways to allow larger, more modern rolling stock to be used. Together, the works proposed in these bills would enable the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway (CCE&amp;HR)&#x27;s trains to run over the C&amp;SLR&#x27;s route and vice versa, effectively combining the two separate railways. Tunnel enlargement works only restarted after World War I when an extension of time was granted in February 1919. The Moorgate to Clapham Common section reopened on 1 December 1924, approximately eight months after the rest of the line.

===Bakerloo line===
In November 1891, a private bill was presented to Parliament for the construction of the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway (BS&amp;WR). The railway was planned to run entirely underground from Marylebone to Elephant &amp; Castle via Baker Street and Waterloo and was approved in 1900. Construction commenced in August 1898 under the direction of Sir Benjamin Baker, W.R. Galbraith and R.F. Church with building work by Perry &amp; Company of Tredegar Works, Bow. Test trains began running in 1905. The first section of the BS&amp;WR was between Baker Street and Lambeth North. The BS&amp;WR station opened on 5 August 1906, almost five months after the rest of the line.

===Incidents===
On the morning of 27 November 1923, a slight misjudgement at the end of the tunnel enlargement work left the tunnel unstable near Borough. A collapse on the same day, caused when a train hit temporary shoring near Elephant &amp; Castle, filled the tunnel with wet gravel. Later a gas main exploded, causing a water main to break and leaving a water-filled crater in the middle of the street. The line was briefly split in two, but was completely closed on 28 November 1923.

A girl born at the station on 13 May 1924 was the first baby to be born on the Underground network. According to initial press reports, she had been named Thelma Ursula Beatrice Eleanor (so that her initials would be T.U.B.E.) but this later proved false: her actual name was Mary Ashfield Eleanor Hammond. Her second name Ashfield was from Lord Ashfield, chairman of the railway, who agreed to be the baby&#x27;s godfather, but said that &quot;it would not do to encourage this sort of thing as I am a busy man.&quot;

==Station upgrade and expansion==
The interchange between the Bakerloo and Northern lines has long been criticised by local residents for its lack of escalators, its winding passageways and its two separate station entrances. Given the increased demand on the Underground station from proposed and under-construction residential development, Southwark Council has called for the expansion and redevelopment of the station, noting in 2008 that it was the &quot;final hurdle&quot; of a deal to redevelop the Shopping Centre. In 2018, the redevelopment of the Elephant and Castle Shopping Centre was approved, with a new station entrance as part of the proposal.

The upgrade and expansion work will include a new station entrance and ticket hall facing Elephant Square, three new escalators, and lifts providing step-free access to the Northern line platforms. The new entrance would also improve the interchange between the Underground and Elephant &amp; Castle railway station, with a more direct route through the new development. The shell of the new ticket hall will be constructed by the developer Delancey; TfL and Southwark Council will share the £15m cost of connecting the shell to the existing platforms and to &quot;fit out&quot; the new ticket hall with escalators and lifts. The Shopping Centre closed in September 2020, allowing construction work to begin. The new ticket hall is scheduled to open in 2028/9.

The new ticket hall has been designed to accommodate the proposed Bakerloo line extension. New Bakerloo tunnels would be dug along with new platforms to accommodate the increase in demand if the Bakerloo line extension comes into service.

== Proposals for the future ==

=== Bakerloo line extension to southeast London ===

An extension to Camberwell from Elephant &amp; Castle was planned and approved in 1931. Elephant &amp; Castle was also to be reconstructed with a third platform to provide the additional reversing capacity, along with a new ticket hall and escalators. Due to the need to prioritise the extension from Baker Street to Finchley Road, to relieve congestion on the Metropolitan line, as well as financial constraints and the outbreak of the Second World War, no work was carried out on the extension. In the 1950s there was a brief revival of the plan, in which it was proposed that Elephant &amp; Castle would not be altered and the additional turn-round capacity would be provided by making Camberwell a three-platform terminus. The project was ultimately unaffordable owing to post-war austerity, reduced demand, and the disproportionately high cost of the project with a three-platform deep-level terminus and the requirement for new trains and a depot.

During 2005–06, a Bakerloo extension was proposed with three route options. The options were extensions to Hayes via Peckham Rye, Beckenham Junction via Camberwell, or Hayes via New Cross. In July 2011, Network Rail recommended an extension of the Bakerloo line from Elephant &amp; Castle to Lewisham, where it would take over the line to Hayes. In September 2014, Transport for London ran a consultation on the Bakerloo extension to Hayes and Beckenham Junction with options via Lewisham and Camberwell or Old Kent Road, taking over Network Rail&#x27;s Hayes line. The cost of the extension is estimated at around £2–3 billion with construction expected to take place between the mid-2020s and early 2030s. A February 2017 consultation indicates that the line could extend to Lewisham via Old Kent Road with future extension options later on.

<text>The Oregon Trail is a text-based strategy video game developed by Don Rawitsch, Bill Heinemann, and Paul Dillenberger in 1971 and produced by the Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium (MECC) beginning in 1975. It was developed as a computer game to teach school children about the realities of 19th-century pioneer life on the Oregon Trail. In the game, the player assumes the role of a wagon leader guiding a party of settlers from Independence, Missouri, to Oregon City, Oregon via a covered wagon in 1847. Along the way the player must purchase supplies, hunt for food, and make choices on how to proceed along the trail while encountering random events such as storms and wagon breakdowns. The original versions of the game contain no graphics, as they were developed for computers that used teleprinters instead of computer monitors. A later Apple II port added a graphical shooting minigame.

The first version of the game was developed over the course of two weeks for use by Rawitsch in a history unit at Jordan Junior High School in Minneapolis. Despite its popularity with the students, it was deleted from the school district&#x27;s mainframe computer at the end of the school semester. Rawitsch recreated the game in 1974 for the MECC, which distributed educational software for free in Minnesota and for sale elsewhere, and recalibrated the probabilities of events based on historical journals and diaries for the game&#x27;s release the following year. After the rise of microcomputers in the 1970s, the MECC released several versions of the game over the next decade for the Apple II, Atari 8-bit computers, and Commodore 64 computers, before redesigning it as a graphical commercial game for the Apple II under the same name in 1985.

The game is the first entry in &quot;The Oregon Trail&quot; series; games in the series have since been released in many editions by various developers and publishers, many titled &quot;The Oregon Trail&quot;. The multiple games in the series are often considered to be iterations on the same title, and have collectively sold over 65 million copies and have been inducted into the World Video Game Hall of Fame. The series has also inspired a number of spinoffs such as &quot;The Yukon Trail&quot; and &quot;The Amazon Trail&quot;.

==Gameplay==

&quot;The Oregon Trail&quot; is a text-based strategy video game in which the player, as the leader of a wagon train, controls a group journeying down the Oregon Trail from Independence, Missouri to Oregon City, Oregon in 1847. The player purchases supplies, then plays through approximately twelve rounds of decision making, each representing two weeks on the trail. Each round begins with the player being told their current distance along the trail and the date, along with their current supplies. Supplies consist of food, bullets, clothing, miscellaneous supplies, and cash, each given as a number. Players are given the option to hunt for food, and in some rounds to stop at a fort to purchase supplies, and then choose how much food to consume that round. The game closes the round by randomly selecting one or two events and weather conditions. The events include storms damaging supplies, wagons breaking down, and attacks by wild animals or &quot;hostile riders&quot;; weather conditions can slow down the rate of travel, which can result in additional rounds needed to reach Oregon.

When hunting, or when attacked, the game prompts the player to type a word—&quot;BANG&quot; in the original version, or a randomly selected word like &quot;BANG&quot; or &quot;POW&quot; in later versions—with misspellings resulting in no effect. When hunting, the faster the word is typed, the more food is gathered. The game ends when the player reaches Oregon, or if they die along the trail; death can occur due to an attack or by running out of supplies. Running out of food results in starvation, while lack of clothing in cold weather, low levels of food, or random events such as snakebite or a hunting accident lead to illness; this results in death if the player does not have miscellaneous supplies for minor or regular illnesses, or cannot afford a doctor in the case of serious illnesses.

==Development==
===Original version===
In 1971, Don Rawitsch, a history major and senior at Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota, taught an 8th-grade history class at Jordan Junior High School in Minneapolis as a student teacher. His supervising teacher assigned him to prepare a unit on &quot;The Western Expansion of the Mid-19th Century&quot;, and Rawitsch decided to create a board game activity about the Oregon Trail for the students. After one week of planning the lessons, he was in the process of drawing out the trail on sheets of paper on the floor of his apartment when his roommates, fellow Carleton students Bill Heinemann and Paul Dillenberger, came in. Heinemann, who along with Dillenberger was a math student and student teacher with experience in programming, discussed the project with Rawitsch, and told him that it would be well-suited to a computer program, as it could keep track of the player&#x27;s progress and calculate their chances of success based on their supplies instead of a dice roll. Rawitsch was initially hesitant, as the unit needed to be completed within two weeks, but Heinemann and Dillenberger felt it could be done if they worked on it for long hours each day. The trio then spent the weekend designing and coding the game on paper.

The Minneapolis school district had recently purchased an HP 2100 minicomputer, and the schools the trio were teaching in, like the other schools in the district, were connected to it via a single teleprinter. These teleprinters could send and print messages from programs running on the central computer. The video game industry was in its infancy in 1971, and the three had no resources to draw on to develop the game software beyond their own programming knowledge; instead, they spent two weeks working and coding in HP Time-Shared BASIC on their own. Rawitsch focused on the design and historical portions of the game, while Heinemann and Dillenberger did the programming, working on the teleprinter kept in a small room that was formerly a janitor&#x27;s closet at the school they taught at, Bryant Junior High School, as well as bringing it to the apartment to continue working. Heinemann focused on the overall programming flow, and came up with the hunting minigame, while Dillenberger made subroutines for the game to use, wrote much of the text displayed to the player, and tested for bugs in the code. As there was only one terminal, Heinemann wrote code on paper while Dillenberger entered it into the system along with his own.

They implemented the basics of the game in those two weeks, including purchasing supplies, making choices at specific points of the journey, and the hunting minigame. They also included the random events happening to the player, and Heinemann had the idea to make the random events tied to the geography of the trail, so that cold weather events would be more likely in the mountains and attacks more likely in the plains. They also added small randomization of outcomes such as the amount of food gained from hunting; they expected that in order for the children to be interested in playing the game multiple times there needed to be variations between plays. Heinemann and Dillenberger let some students at their school play it to test, including future musician Prince; the students were enthusiastic about the game, staying late at school to play. The other teachers were not as interested, but did recommend changes to the game, particularly removing negative depictions of Native Americans as they were based more on Western movies and television than history, and could be problematic towards the several students with Native American ancestry at the schools.

&quot;The Oregon Trail&quot; debuted to Rawitsch&#x27;s classes on December 3, 1971. He was unsure how interested the students would be in the game, as they had had limited exposure to computers and several seemed uninterested in history altogether, but after he showed them the game, students would line up outside the door for their turn and stay after school for another chance. Rawitsch has recounted that, as only one student could use the teleprinter at one time and he could only reserve it for one week, he had the students play in groups, and they organized themselves into voting for responses and delegating students to handle hunting, following the map, and keeping track of supplies. Other teachers at the school came up with &quot;flimsy excuses&quot; for their students to try the game as well. The trio adjusted the game&#x27;s code as the students played in response to bugs found, such as purchasing clothes for negative money. As the school district shared a single central minicomputer, schools across the city began to play the game as well. When the semester and their student teaching term ended, the team printed out copies of the source code—about 800 lines of code—and deleted the program from the computer.

===MECC version===
In 1974, Rawitsch was hired by the Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium (MECC), a state-funded organization that developed educational software for the classroom, as an entry-level liaison for local community colleges. The MECC had a similar system to the Minneapolis school district&#x27;s setup in 1971, with a CDC Cyber 70/73-26 mainframe computer which schools across the state could connect to via terminals. The system contained several educational programs, and Rawitsch&#x27;s boss let him know that it was open to submissions. Rawitsch, with permission from Heinemann and Dillenberger, spent the 1974 Thanksgiving weekend copying and adjusting the printed BASIC source code into the system. Rather than submit the recreated copy, he instead enhanced the game with research on the events of the Oregon Trail that he had not had time for with the original version, and changed the frequency and types of random events, such as bad weather or wagons breaking down, to be based on the actual historical probabilities for what happened to travelers on the trail at each location in the game. Rawitsch calculated the probabilities himself, basing them on historical diaries and narratives of people on the trail that he read. He also added in more positive depictions of Native Americans, as his research indicated that many settlers received assistance from them along the trail. He placed &quot;The Oregon Trail&quot; into the organization&#x27;s time-sharing network in 1975, where it could be accessed by schools across Minnesota.

==Legacy==
The 1975 mainframe game was the most popular software in the system for Minnesota schools for five years, with thousands of players monthly. Rawitsch, Heinemann, and Dillenberger were not publicly acknowledged as the creators of the original game until 1995, when MECC honored them in a ceremony at the Mall of America. By then, several versions of the game had been created. Rawitsch published the source code of &quot;The Oregon Trail&quot; in &quot;Creative Computing&quot;″s May–June 1978 issue, along with some of the historical information he had used to refine the statistics. That year MECC began encouraging schools to adopt the Apple II microcomputer, purchasing large amounts at a discount and reselling them to schools. MECC began converting several of their products to run on microcomputers, and John Cook adapted the game for the Apple II; though the text-based gameplay remained largely the same, he added a display of the player&#x27;s position along the trail on a map between rounds, and replaced the typing in the hunting and attack minigame with a graphical version in which a deer or attacker moves across the screen and the player presses a key to fire at it. A version for Atari 8-bit computers, again titled &quot;The Oregon Trail&quot;, was released in 1982. The Apple II version was included under the name &quot;Oregon&quot; as part of MECC&#x27;s &quot;Elementary&quot; series, distributed to Minnesota schools for free and for profit to schools outside of the state, on &quot;Elementary Volume 6&quot; in 1980. &quot;Oregon&quot; was ported to the Commodore 64 in 1984 as part of a collection like &quot;Elementary Volume 6&quot; titled &quot;Expeditions&quot;. By the mid-1980s, MECC was selling their educational software to schools around the country, and &quot;The Oregon Trail&quot; was their most popular product by far.

In 1985, MECC produced a fully-graphical version of the game for Apple II computers, redesigned by R. Philip Bouchard as a greatly expanded product for home consumers under the same name. &quot;The Oregon Trail&quot; was extremely successful, and along with successive versions of the game it sold over 65 million copies. Several further games have been released in &quot;The Oregon Trail&quot; series, many under the title &quot;The Oregon Trail&quot;, as well as a number of spinoffs such as &quot;The Yukon Trail&quot; and &quot;The Amazon Trail&quot;.

The original &quot;Oregon Trail&quot; has been described in &quot;Serious Games and Edutainment Applications&quot; as &quot;one of the most famous ancestors&quot; of the serious game subgenre. The text-based and graphical versions of &quot;The Oregon Trail&quot; are often described as different iterations of the same game when discussing the game&#x27;s legacy; Colin Campbell of &quot;Polygon&quot;, for example, has described it collectively as one of the most successful games of all time, calling it a cultural icon. Kevin Wong of &quot;Vice&quot; claimed that the collective game was &quot;synonymous with edutainment&quot;. Due to its widespread popularity, &quot;The Oregon Trail&quot;, referring to all versions of the game released over 40 years, was inducted into the World Video Game Hall of Fame in 2016. &quot;Time&quot; named the game as one of the 100 greatest video games in 2012, and placed it 9th on its list of the 50 best games in 2016.

<text>Huilliche (which can also be found spelt Williche, Huiliche or Veliche) is a moribund branch of the Araucanian language family. In 1982 it was spoken by about 2,000 ethnic Huilliche people in Chile, but now [when?] it is only spoken by a few elderly speakers. It is spoken in the nation&#x27;s Los Lagos and Los Ríos regions; and mountain valleys, between the city of Valdivia and south toward the Chiloé Archipelago.

Huilliche is composed of at least two varieties, called Huillichesungun and Tsesungun by their speakers. Huillichesungun is spoken in Wequetrumao, on the island of Chiloé, and Tsesungun is spoken in Choroy Traiguen, on the coast of Osorno province. Huilliche is closely related to Mapudungun, the language of the Mapuche, though more research is needed to determine the degree of mutual intelligibility between the two.

The &quot;Enduring Voices&quot; project of National Geographic reports the following:&quot;They are to some degree hidden within the broader Mapuche ethnic group, yet consider themselves quite distinct in both language and identity [...] Though the two languages [Huillichesungun and Tsesungun] may share as many as 80% of basic words, we confirmed that they differ in their sounds and grammar, as well as in their ethno-linguistic identity [...] Unexpectedly, Tsesungun, though it is geographically closer to Mapudungun, is less similar to it.&quot;The Jesuit priest Luis de Valdivia reported in 1606 that there was linguistic unity in the territory between Coquimbo and Chiloé, from the Pacific to the Andes, and that this was composed of varieties whose differences were mostly in pronunciation and vocabulary. This analysis is supported by researchers at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century, such as Félix José de Augusta or Rodolfo Lenz, and by those in the second half of the 20th century, such as Robert Croese. The latter two noted that Huilliche was the most divergent of the varieties of Araucanian, as did Pilar Álvarez-Santullano, a researcher in the phonology and syntax of Chesungun on the Osorno coast. A 2015 study found that the degree of mutual intelligibility was not possible to evaluate at present given that speakers of Huilliche were too few and with scant linguistic competence, nevertheless with the evidence available authors regarded Huilliche a variety of Mapudungun.

Most Huilliche speakers are older adults, and most ethnic Huilliche speak Spanish as their first language, making both Huilliche varieties highly endangered.

<doc id="354021" wikidata="Q3269943" url="?curid=354021" title="Westminster Shorter Catechism">
<text>The Westminster Shorter Catechism is a catechism written in 1646 and 1647 by the Westminster Assembly, a synod of English and Scottish theologians and laymen intended to bring the Church of England into greater conformity with the Church of Scotland. The assembly also produced the Westminster Confession of Faith and the Westminster Larger Catechism. A version without Scripture citations was completed on 25 November 1647 and presented to the Long Parliament, and Scripture citations were added on 14 April 1649.

==Background==
Catechesis is a practice of teaching the Christian faith. New converts to Christianity were taught through lectures during the first four centuries of the Church&#x27;s existence, but this practice was largely abandoned with the rise of Christendom. Christian humanists and Protestant Reformers sought to revive the practice, including the Reformed. John Calvin&#x27;s Genevan Catechism was especially influential among the British Reformed. The most popular British catechisms included works by John Craig, James Ussher, Herbert Palmer, John Ball, and Anthony Tuckney.

On John Knox&#x27;s return to Scotland after long exile because he was deemed by the authorities a heretic, the &quot;First Book of Discipline&quot; (1560) was drafted. It required that a Sabbath afternoon session be set aside for examination of young children in catechism, and this practice eventually was adopted in the Kirk. Catechizing became a part of life in the Scottish Churches with itinerant catechists being employed to instruct the people—a practice that continued into the 19th century.

In 1643, the Westminster Assembly, which was designed to bring the two national churches into greater conformity, was convened at the height of the English Civil War to reform the Church of England. When the Solemn League and Covenant was as a result signed between the English and Scots the Assembly&#x27;s work also became the framing of &quot;four points or parts of uniformity&quot;: a Confession of Faith, Form of Church Government, Directory for Worship, and Catechizing.

==Composition==
Although the church in Scotland (the Kirk) had produced &quot;The New Catechisme according to the Forme of the Kirk of Scotland&quot; in 1644, it was aimed particularly at children and youth, and was not adopted by the Westminster Assembly of Divines. Twelve or fourteen of the members of the Westminster Assembly had produced catechisms themselves prior to the Assembly. Herbert Palmer was one of the most respected catechists in the country, and it was expected that his catechism, first published in 1640, would be the basis for the Assembly&#x27;s. It appears that this idea was abandoned by the committee assigned to the catechism after some work in 1645, followed by another failed attempt at a single catechism from the Summer of 1646 to 14 January 1647

At this point, the committee decided that it would need to produce two catechisms rather than one, as the needs of ministers and children were very different. The committee also decided to wait until the completion of the Confession of Faith, and to base the catechisms off this document rather than the Apostles&#x27; Creed. The Larger Catechism was completed and forwarded to Parliament on 22 October 1647, and another committee was set up for the Shorter Catechism composed of Herbert Palmer as chairman, Charles Herle, Thomas Temple, John Lightfoot, John Greene, Philip Delme, Edmund Calamy the Elder, and Stanley Gower. When Palmer died soon after the constitution of this committee, another committee was formed with only Anthony Tuckney, Stephen Marshall, and John Ward, along with Samuel Rutherford (one of the Scottish commissioners, who could not vote).
Anthony Tuckney is believed to be the most influential of the committee members on the Catechism. The previously published catechisms of James Ussher and John Ball, as well as the theology of William Perkins were also relied upon, however many of the similarities between the Assembly&#x27;s Shorter Catechism and earlier ones may be explained by the common theological vocabulary of the time. The Shorter Catechism was largely based on the Larger Catechism, though the Shorter may have incorporated more of the earlier abandoned catechism than the Larger. It was sent to Parliament on 25 November 1647, a little over a month after the Larger Catechism. Scripture citations were added on 14 April 1648. It was passed Parliament 22–25 September and ordered to be printed with the title &quot;The Grounds and Principles of Religion Contained in a Shorter Catechism&quot;. The Church of Scotland approved it in July 1648, and it passed the Scottish Parliament in February of the next year.

==Form and content==
The purpose of the Shorter Catechism is to educate children and others &quot;of weaker capacity&quot; (according to a preface written by the Church of Scotland) in the Reformed faith. It is based on the Larger Catechism, which was intended for use by ministers as they taught the faith to their congregations in preaching. The Catechism is in a question and answer format, which had been popularized by Martin Luther as a way to help children learn the meaning of the material, rather than simply memorizing the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, Ten Commandments, and Apostles&#x27; Creed as had been the practice prior to the Reformation.

The catechism is composed of 107 questions and answers. The first 12 questions concern God as Creator. Questions 13–20 deal with original sin and the fallen state of man&#x27;s nature. Questions 21–38 concern Christ the Redeemer and the benefits that flow from redemption. The next set of questions, 39–84, discuss the Ten Commandments. Questions 85–97 teach concerning the Sacraments of Baptism and Holy Communion. The final set of questions, 98–107, teach and explain the Lord&#x27;s Prayer. This organization mimics the earlier Heidelberg Catechism used by many Continental Reformed churches.

The most famous of the questions (known to a great many Presbyterian children) is the first:

&quot;Q. What is the chief end of man?&quot;
A. Man&#x27;s chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy him forever.

==Legacy==
The Church of Scotland approved the Westminster Shorter Catechism in 1648, and thereafter it was the manual for instruction. However, because a significant portion of the Scottish Highland population spoke only Gaelic, the Synod of Argyll in 1649 instructed seven of its ministers to translate the Westminster Shorter Catechism into that language. The result was published that same year, and the Gaelic Shorter Catechism continued to play a part in church life for decades after it had ceased to be used in the English speaking churches. The Free Church of Scotland still presents a Bible to a child who can answer all 107 questions accurately at one sitting.

In 1675, the Presbyterian Thomas Vincent in London published a popular exposition called &quot;The Shorter Catechism Explained&quot;. Later, Reformed catechisms such as the 1693 Baptist Keach&#x27;s Catechism mimic the Westminster catechism on most points except infant baptism.

A revised version of the Shorter Catechism, authored to demonstrate the relationship between the Methodist movement and the Church of Scotland, was published in John Wesley&#x27;s &quot;A Christian Library&quot;.

The Westminster Catechism is mentioned in Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot;, chapter eight, in reference to Pearl&#x27;s ability to bear a fair examination by this catechism.

<doc id="354024" wikidata="Q3783449" url="?curid=354024" title="Harold Schechter">
<text>Harold Schechter (born June 28, 1948) is an American true crime writer who specializes in serial killers. He is a Professor Emeritus at Queens College, City University of New York where he taught classes in American literature and myth criticism for forty-two years. Schechter&#x27;s essays have appeared in numerous publications including &quot;The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Los Angeles Times&quot;, and the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot;. He is the editor of the Library of America volume, &quot;True Crime: An American Anthology&quot;. His newest book, published in September 2023, is &quot;Murderabilia: A History of Crime in 100 Objects.&quot;

== Education ==
Schechter attended the State University of New York at Buffalo where his PhD director was Leslie Fiedler. He is also a 1969 graduate of City College of New York.

== Career ==
Schechter is Professor Emeritus at Queens College, and specializes in American true crime, specifically serial murders of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Using primary sources such as newspaper clippings and court records, he supplies thorough documentation of every case he profiles, while still managing to create compelling narratives and fully fleshed-out characters.

His 2014 book, The Mad Sculptor: The Maniac, the Model, and the Crime that Shook the Nation, was nominated for an Edgar Award in the Best Fact Crime category. In addition to his work as a crime historian, Schechter is the author of an acclaimed series of detective novels based on the works of Edgar Allan Poe. Under the pseudonym H. C. Chester, he has also co-written the middle-grade trilogy, Curiosity House, with his daughter, bestselling YA novelist Lauren Oliver. The first book in the series, Curiosity House: The Shrunken Head (2016), was nominated for an Edgar Award in the &quot;Best Juvenile Mystery&quot; category.

In addition to his historical crime books and mystery fiction, Schechter has written extensively on American popular culture. In &quot;The Bosom Serpent: Folklore and Popular Art&quot;, he explores the relationship between contemporary commercial entertainment and the narrative archetypes of traditional folklore. &quot;Savage Pastimes: A Cultural History of Violent Entertainment&quot; places the current controversy over media violence in a broad historical context. Examining everything from Victorian murder ballads to the productions of the nineteenth-century Grand Guignol, the book makes the somewhat contrarian argument that today&#x27;s popular entertainment is actually less violent than the gruesome diversions of the supposedly halcyon past.

In his 1973 article, &quot;Kali on Main Street: The Rise of the Terrible Mother in America&quot;, Schechter uses the phrase &quot;horror-porn,&quot; which is cited by the Oxford English Dictionary as the first printed appearance of the word &quot;porn&quot; in its now-common figurative meaning: &quot;As the second element in compounds: denoting written or visual material that emphasizes the sensuous or sensational aspects of a non-sexual subject, appealing to its audience in a manner likened to the titillating effect of pornography.

With David Black, Schechter also co-wrote the teleplay for the Season 8 Law &amp; Order episode, “Castoff.”

== Praise ==
&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; has called Schechter a &quot;serial killer expert&quot;, a &quot;deft writer&quot;, praising his ability to recreate &quot;from documentation the thoughts and perspectives of long-dead figures.&quot; &quot;PW&quot; called Schechter&#x27;s book &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Gentleman&quot; &quot;a riveting tale of murder, seduction and tabloid journalism run rampant in New York not so different from today&quot;.

Booklist called his book &quot;Depraved&quot; a &quot;first-rate true crime and first-rate popular history.&quot;
Writing in the &quot;New York Times&quot; reviewer James Polk praised &quot;Nevermore&quot;, the first in Schechter&#x27;s Poe mystery series, for its &quot;entertaining premise . . . supported by rich period atmospherics.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Schechter is married to poet Kimiko Hahn. He has two daughters from a previous marriage: the writer Lauren Oliver, and professor of philosophy Elizabeth Schechter.

<text>Evington is an area of Leicester, and electoral ward of the Leicester district, in the ceremonial county of Leicestershire, England. It used to be a small village centred on Main Street and the Anglican church of St Denys but was close enough to Leicester to become one of the outer suburbs in the 1930s. Today, the ward comprises the historical village of Evington, as well as the modern ex-council estates of Rowlatts Hill and Goodwood. The population of the ward at the 2011 census was 11,133.

==History==

===Evington village===

The name Evington comes from the Old English meaning &#x27;farm/settlement of Eafa/Aefa&#x27;. After the Norman Conquest of 1066 the land was given to Hugh de Grentesmesnil. The first known spelling of Evington was by Walter de Evington in 1259, who leased a carucate of land at the village of Evington – about . The parish of Evington was originally quite large and included the areas now known as North Evington and Evington Valley. These were annexed by the borough of Leicester in 1892, and are not generally considered part of Evington.

In 1931 the parish had a population of 1802. On 1 April 1935, the boundaries of Leicester (by this point a city), were expanded again, including nearly all of the remaining parish of Evington, except for a small part which went to Oadby. The modern ward does include the large 1950s development based at Downing Drive and Spencefield Lane.

Evington village has been a conservation area since 1989.

===Council estates===

Rowlatts Hill is a council estate established on a hillside to the north of Leicester General Hospital in 1964–67 by the City Architect Stephen George with two 22-story blocks of flats and single or two-storey houses of grey brick. A later development (1973–77) is of red brick houses. For council housing purposes it is considered separate from Evington.

Goodwood is a 1950s council estate considered together with Evington for council housing purposes. It is just under 1000 residences.

==Features==

=== Village Green ===
Evington Village Green is a triangle of land bounded to the north by Main Street, on the Southwest by High Street and to the east by Church Street. The village war memorial is located on the northeast corner. On the west corner is a Baptist Chapel and a building called the Manse. It is largely open space for recreation, with a large old oak tree in the south-east corner. It also features a newly refurbished children&#x27;s playground, funded by the Friends of Evington Village Green. It is the site of the Evington Village Fete and Show, held annually.

=== Evington Park ===

Evington park is some of public parkland, opened in 1948, formerly the estate of Evington House (built 1836) which is used as offices and some public amenities. It contains many mature trees, including a mulberry dating from about the same time as the house. There are public exercise machines as well as tennis courts, football and cricket pitches and bowling greens. More recently, a concrete table tennis table has been added and is situated near the tennis courts. Public toilets have also been built near the courts.

=== Arboretum ===
This was established as a public amenity in 1970 and consists of an area south of St Denys Church, bounded on the west by a golf course, with more than 500 trees largely planted in taxonomic groups. In the northmost area, many individual trees are planted by arrangement with the council as memorials to people who have died.
=== The Hollow ===
This is Scheduled monument (SM17026), often known as &#x27;Piggy&#x27;s Hollow&#x27;, consisting of the remains of the moats of a manor house built in the late 13th century by John de Grey. It is on the north side of the Arboretum and adjacent to St Denys Church on the west.
=== St Denys Church ===
The Church of England church of St Denys has been the parish church for almost 800 years, having been dedicated on 9 October 1219 by the Bishop of Lincoln. It is a Grade II* listed building. The tower and spire are original: the South and North Aisles date from the 14th century, and the Chancel from the 19th century. Its rare ring of 4 bells was augmented to six following an appeal in the late 1980s. The interior includes 3 stained glass windows from 1870.
=== Evington Chapel ===
Evington Chapel is a Baptist Church on the corner of Main Street and High Street, by Evington Village Green. It is an 1837 Gothic style building with slate roof, and a Grade II listed building.

=== Masjid Umar Mosque ===

The Masjid Umar mosque, which is also Evington Muslim Centre, was completed in 2000.

==Amenities==

Evington has two main shopping centres: the first largely based in a modern development near the old village and including the local library, and the second towards the northern end of Downing Drive. Public houses include the Cedars in the old village and the Dove in Downing Drive. The Village Hall is a brick building on Church Lane, opposite St Denys: its foundation stone calls it King George V Hall and is dated MDCDXII (1912).

Nearby places, Goodwood, Evington Valley, Oadby, Thurnby, Stoughton.

Evington is home to the Leicestershire Golf Club, on the south of the village, and west of the arboretum.

The largest employer in the area is the Leicester General hospital, located near Goodwood on Coleman Road which is south of Uppingham Road (the A47).

The &quot;Evington Echo&quot; is the community newspaper. It is produced by volunteers and is delivered free of charge to 5,800 houses in the area. It was first published in 1981.

Evington was the home of England football international Emile Heskey.
Both Emile Heskey and Gary Lineker (winner of the Golden Boot) attended the City of Leicester College in Evington, as did former Labour media adviser Alastair Campbell and Dr Nicholas Shepherd (co-founder of the internet). Heskey and Shepherd were both pupils at Linden Primary school in Evington. What is now the Cedars public house and restaurant on the corner of Main Street and School Lane was formerly the home of the novelist E. Phillips Oppenheim. The novelist J. B. Priestley was evacuated to North Evington Hospital after being wounded in France in 1916.

<doc id="354027" wikidata="Q33730" url="?curid=354027" title="Mapuche language">
<text>Mapuche ( , ; from &#x27;land&#x27; and &#x27;people&#x27;, meaning &#x27;the people of the land&#x27;) or Mapudungun (from &#x27;land&#x27; and &#x27;speak, speech&#x27;, meaning &#x27;the speech of the land&#x27;; also spelled Mapuzugun and Mapudungu) is an Araucanian language related to Huilliche spoken in south-central Chile and west-central Argentina by the Mapuche people. It was formerly known as Araucanian, the name given to the Mapuche by the Spanish; the Mapuche avoid it as a remnant of Spanish colonialism.

Mapudungun is not an official language of Chile and Argentina, having received virtually no government support throughout its history. However, since 2013, Mapuche, along with Spanish, has been granted the status of an official language by the local government of Galvarino, one of the many communes of Chile. It is not used as a language of instruction in either country&#x27;s educational system despite the Chilean government&#x27;s commitment to provide full access to education in Mapuche areas in southern Chile. There is an ongoing political debate over which alphabet to use as the standard alphabet of written Mapudungun.

In 1982, it was estimated that there were 202,000 Mapuche speakers in Chile, including those that speak the Pehuenche and Huilliche dialects, and another 100,000 speakers in Argentina as of the year 2000. However, a 2002 study suggests that only 16% of those who identify as Mapuche speak the language (active speakers) and 18% can only understand it (passive speakers). These figures suggest that the total number of active speakers is about 120,000 and that there are slightly more passive speakers of Mapuche in Chile. As of 2013 only 2.4% of urban speakers and 16% of rural speakers use Mapudungun when speaking with children, and only 3.8% of speakers aged 10–19 years in the south of Chile (the language&#x27;s stronghold) are &quot;highly competent&quot; in the language.

Speakers of Chilean Spanish who also speak Mapudungun tend to use more impersonal pronouns when speaking Spanish. In Cautín Province and Llifén contact with Mapuche language may be the reason why there is a lack of &quot;yeísmo&quot; among some Spanish speakers. The language has also influenced the Spanish lexicon within the areas in which it is spoken and has also incorporated loanwords from both Spanish and Quechua.

Depending on the alphabet, the sound is spelled or , and as or . The language is called either the &quot;speech (&#x27;) of the land (&#x27;)&quot; or the &quot;speech of the people (&quot;&quot;)&quot;. An may connect the two words. There are thus several ways to write the name of the language:

==History==
===Prehistory===
Moulian &quot;et al.&quot; (2015) argue that the Puquina language influenced Mapuche language long before the rise of the Inca Empire. The influence of Puquine is thought to be the reason for the existence of Mapuche-Aymara-Quechua cognates. The following Pre-Incan cognates have been identified by Moulian &quot;et al.&quot;: sun (, ), moon (, ), warlock (, ), salt (, ) and mother (, ). This areal linguistic influence may have arrived with a migratory wave arising from the collapse of the Tiwanaku Empire around 1000 CE.

There is a more recent lexical influence from the Quechuan languages (&quot;pataka&quot; &#x27;hundred&#x27;, &quot;warangka&quot; &#x27;thousand&#x27;), associated with the Inca Empire, and from Spanish.

As result of Inca rule, there was some Mapudungun–Imperial Quechua bilingualism among the Mapuches of Aconcagua Valley at the time of the arrival of the Spanish in the 1530s and 1540s.

The discovery of many Chono toponyms in Chiloé Archipelago, where Huilliche, a language closely related to Mapudungun, has been dominant, suggest that Mapudungun displaced Chono there prior to the arrival of the Spanish in the mid-16th century. A theory postulated by chronicler José Pérez García holds that the Cuncos settled in Chiloé Island in Pre-Hispanic times as consequence of a push from more northern Huilliches, who in turn were being displaced by Mapuches.

According to Ramírez &quot;more than a dozen Mapuche – Rapa Nui cognates have been described&quot;. Among these are the Mapuche/Rapa Nui words &quot;toki&quot;/&quot;toki&quot; (axe), &quot;kuri&quot;/&quot;uri&quot; (black) and &quot;piti&quot;/&quot;iti&quot; (little).

===Spanish–Mapuche bilingualism in colonial times===
As the 16th and 17th century Central Chile was becoming a melting pot for uprooted indigenous peoples, it has been argued that Mapuche, Quechua and Spanish coexisted there, with significant bilingualism, during the 17th century. However the indigenous language that has influenced Chilean Spanish the most is Quechua rather than Mapuche.

In colonial times, many Spanish and Mestizos spoke the Mapuche language. For example, in the 17th century, many soldiers at the Valdivian Fort System had some command of Mapuche.

During the 17th and 18th centuries, most of Chiloé Archipelago&#x27;s population was bilingual, and according to John Byron, many Spaniards preferred to use the local Huilliche language because they considered it &quot;more beautiful&quot;. Around the same time, Governor Narciso de Santa María complained that Spanish settlers in the islands could not speak Spanish properly, but could speak Veliche, and that this second language was more used.

===Further decline===
Mapudungun was once the main language spoken in central Chile. The sociolinguistic situation of the Mapuche has changed rapidly. Now, nearly all of Mapuche people are bilingual or monolingual in Spanish. The degree of bilingualism depends on the community, participation in Chilean society, and the individual&#x27;s choice towards the traditional or modern/urban way of life.

==Classification and origin==
There is no consensus among experts regarding the relation between Mapuche and other indigenous languages of South America and it is classified as a language isolate, or more conservatively, an unclassified language while researchers await more definitive evidence linking it to other languages.

The origin of Mapuche is a historically debated topic and hypotheses have changed over time. In a 1970 publication, Stark argued that Mapuche is related to Mayan languages of Mesoamerica. The following year, Hamp adopted this same hypothesis. Stark later argued in 1973 that Mapuche descended from a language known as &#x27;Yucha&#x27; which is a sister of Proto-Mayan language and a predecessor of the Chimuan languages, which hail from the northern coast of Peru, and Uru-Chipaya (Uruquilla and Chipaya) languages, which are spoken by those who currently inhabit the islands of Lake Titicaca and peoples living in Oruro Department in Bolivia, respectively. This hypothesis was later rejected by Campbell in the same year.

The research carried out by Mary R. Key in 1978 considered Mapuche to be related to other languages of Chile: specifically Kawésgar language and Yagán language which were both spoken by nomadic canoer communities from the Zona Austral and also with Chonan languages of Patagonia, some of which are now extinct. However, according to Key, there is a closer relation still between Mapuche and the Pano-Tacanan languages from Bolivia and Peru, a connection also made by Loos in 1973. Key also argued that there is a link to two Bolivian language isolates: the Mosetén and Yuracaré languages.

In 1987, Joseph Greenberg, a linguist from the United States, proposed a system of classification of the many indigenous languages of the Americas in which the Amerindian language family would include the large majority of languages found on the South American continent, which were formerly grouped in distinct families. The only families that fell outside of his framework were the Eskimo–Aleut languages and Na-Dene languages. According to this classification, Mapuche would be considered part of the Andean language family, within the Meridional subgroup which also includes the Kawésgar language, the Puelche language, the Tehuelche language and the Yagán language. To Greenberg, Araucano isn&#x27;t an individual language, but rather a subgroup composed of four languages: Araucano, Mapuche, Moluche, and Pehuenche. However, the comparative methods employed by Greenberg are controversial. In 1994, Viegas Barros directly contradicted Greenberg&#x27;s hypothesis and part of Key&#x27;s, arguing that a connection between the Merindonal subgroup mentioned above and the Mapuche language does not exist. Current linguists reject Greenberg&#x27;s findings due to methodological concerns and opt instead for more conservative methods of classification. Moreover, many linguists do not accept the existence of an Amerindian language family due to the lack of available information needed to confirm it.

Other authorities such as SIL International classify Mapuche as one of the two languages that form that Araucana family along with Huilliche. However, most current linguists maintain a more conservative stance, classifying Mapuche as a language that remains separated from other indigenous languages of South America while its differences and similarities to them are being studied.

==Dialects==

Linguist Robert A. Croese divides Mapudungun into eight dialectal sub-groups (I-VIII). Sub-group I is centered in Arauco Province, Sub-group II is the dialect of Angol, Los Ángeles and the middle and lower Bío Bío River. Sub-group III is centered around Purén. In the areas around Lonquimay, Melipeuco and Allipén River dialect sub-group IV is spoken. Sub-group V is spoken at the coast of Araucanía Region including Queule, Budi Lake and Toltén.

Temuco is the epicenter of the Mapuche territory today. Around Temuco, Freire and Gorbea the sub-group VI is spoken. Group VII is spoken in Valdivia Province plus Pucón and Curarrehue. The last &quot;dialect&quot; sub-group is VIII which is the Huilliche language spoken from Lago Ranco and Río Bueno to the south and is not mutually intelligible with the other dialects.

These can be grouped in four dialect groups: north, central, south-central and south. These are further divided into eight sub-groups: I and II (northern), III–IV (central), V-VII (south-central) and VIII (southern). The sub-groups III-VII are more closely related to each other than they are to I-II and VIII. Croese finds these relationships as consistent, but not proof, with the theory of origin of the Mapuche proposed by Ricardo E. Latcham.

The Mapudungun spoken in the Argentinian provinces of Neuquen and Río Negro is similar to that of the central dialect group in Chile, while the Ranquel (Rankülche) variety spoken in the Argentinian province of La Pampa is closer to the northern dialect group.

==Grammar==

Mapuche is a polysynthetic language with noun incorporation and root composition. Broadly speaking this means that words are formed by morpheme agglutination of lexical elements to the extent that a single word can require a translation that produces a complete sentence.

==Phonology==

===Prosody===
Mapudungun has partially predictable, non-contrastive stress and there is no phonemic tone. The stressed syllable is generally the last one if it is closed (&#x27; &#x27;game&#x27;, &#x27; &#x27;thunder&#x27;), and the one before last if the last one is open (&#x27; &#x27;house&#x27;, &#x27; &#x27;head&#x27;). In two-syllable words, for example, when both syllables are open (ending in a vowel) or both are closed (ending in a consonant), the accent falls on the final syllable. In the case that only one of the two is open, the accent falls on the closed syllable.

Example
:&quot;iñchiñ&quot; &#x27;we&#x27;
:&quot;narki&quot; &#x27;cat&#x27;
:&quot;küyeṉ&quot; &#x27;moon&#x27;

With words that have more than two syllables and have the final two either open or closed, the accent falls on the penultimate syllable. If only one of the two is closed, that one receives the accent.

Example
:&quot;williche&quot; &#x27;Huilliche language&#x27;
:&quot;pichiwentru&quot; &#x27;boy&#x27;
:&quot;warangka&quot; &#x27;thousand&#x27;
:&quot;mapudungun&quot; &#x27;Mapuche language&#x27;.

===Vowels===


* Sadowsky et al. transcribe the vowels with . Although other sources may follow the traditional transcription .
* In stressed syllables, are near-close , whereas the mid- are centralized close-mid . The open vowel is realized as a raised open central , making it sound closer to than to . Unstressed vowels are more close (though unstressed are still somewhat more open than stressed ). Utterance-final unstressed vowels are generally devoiced or even elided when they occur after voiceless consonants, sometimes even after voiced consonants.
* Traditionally, has been described as a close central vowel with an unstressed mid-central allophone. According to Sadowsky et al., the vowel is close-mid when stressed and near-close when unstressed, patterning phonetically with the mid-series.

===Consonants===
* are bilabial, whereas is labiodental.
* The dental series is phonetically interdental and occurs only in some dialects.
* Utterance-final coronal laterals may be devoiced and fricated: . 
* The plosives may be aspirated. It is often the case with the main allophone of (). Its fronted allophone is less frequently aspirated, as is the alveolar . When it comes to the dental as well as the bilabial , aspiration is even rarer. For stops, voicing is not a distinctive feature, as well as aspiration.
* Some speakers realize as apical postalveolar, either an affricate or an aspirated plosive.
* has been traditionally classified as an approximant; however, Sadowsky et al. prefer to classify it as a fricative as that is the predominant variant in their sample. Other possible variants include a lateral approximant and, in post-nuclear position, a voiceless fricative .
* may be realized with frication: .
* Among the velar consonants, is labialized. Before front vowels, are fronted to .

==Orthography==

The Mapuche had no writing system before the Spanish arrived, but the language is now written with the Latin script. Although the orthography used in this article is based on the &quot;Alfabeto Mapuche Unificado&quot;, the system used by Chilean linguists and other people in many publications in the language, the competing Ragileo, Nhewenh and Azumchefi systems all have their supporters, and there is still no consensus among authorities, linguists and Mapuche communities. The same word can look very different in each system, with the word for &quot;conversation or story&quot; being written either &quot;gvxam&quot;, &quot;gytram&quot;, or &quot;ngütram&quot;, for example.

===Microsoft legal threats===
In late 2006, Mapuche leaders threatened to sue Microsoft when the latter completed a translation of their Windows operating system into Mapudungun. They claimed that Microsoft needed permission to do so and had not sought it. The event can be seen in the light of the greater political struggle concerning the alphabet that should become the standard alphabet of the Mapuche people.

==Morphology==
*Mapuche is an agglutinative language. The word order of Mapudungun is flexible, but a topic–comment construction is common. The subject (agent) of a transitive clause tends to precede the verb, and the object tends to follow (A–V–O order); the subject of an intransitive clause tends to follow the verb (V–S order).
*Nouns are grouped in two classes, animate and inanimate. For example, &#x27; is a plural indicator for animate nouns and &#x27; as the plural for inanimate nouns. &#x27; (or &#x27;) can be used as a definite animate article, as in &#x27; &#x27;the man&#x27; and &#x27; for &#x27;the men&#x27;. The number &quot;&quot; &#x27;one&#x27; serves as an indefinite article. Subjects and objects use the same case.
* Mapudungu uses particles, which is a small group of morphemes that enable the speaker to express how they feel about what they have said. Examples include &quot;chi&quot; (doubt), &quot;am&quot; (surprise), &quot;nga&quot; (regret), &quot;llemay&quot; (certainty), &quot;chemay&quot; (amazement), &quot;chiam&quot; (wonder), &quot;amfe&quot; (exclamation). There are also more complicated particles such as &quot;kay&quot;, which suggest the information about to be said is in contrast to what was just said. Another complex particle is &quot;may,&quot; which is used when the speaker expects to get a positive reaction from what they are saying. One particle, &quot;anchi&quot;, refers to the subject of the sentence, and an example would be &quot;chem anchi?&quot; which translates to what [is] that (pointed out)?
* &quot;An inflection can be added to a noun with -&quot;mew&quot; or -&quot;mu&quot;. This suffix can refer to time, place, cause or comparison. &quot;An example of this is the sentence 

*Numbers from 1 to 10 are as follows: 1 &#x27;, 2 &#x27;, 3 &#x27;, 4 &#x27;, 5 &#x27;, 6 &#x27;, 7 &#x27;, 8 &#x27;, 9 &#x27;, 10 &#x27;; 20 &#x27;, 30 &#x27;, 110 &quot;&quot;. Numbers are extremely regular in formation, which is comparable to Chinese and Wolof.

===Pronouns===
*There are, for personal pronouns, three persons and three numbers:

*Possessive pronouns are related to the personal forms: &#x27; &#x27;my; his, her; their&#x27;, &#x27; &#x27;our (2)&#x27;, &#x27; &#x27;our (more than 2)&#x27;; &#x27; &#x27;your&#x27;, &#x27; &#x27;your (2)&#x27;, &#x27; &#x27;your (more than 2)&#x27;. They are often found with a particle &#x27;, which does not seem to add anything specific to the meaning: &#x27; &#x27;your&#x27;.
*Interrogative pronouns include &#x27; &#x27;who&#x27;, &#x27; &#x27;what&#x27;, &#x27; &#x27;when&#x27;, &#x27; &#x27;where&#x27;, &#x27; &#x27;how&#x27; and &#x27; &#x27;why&#x27;.

===Verbs===
* Most complex verb formations in Mapudungun are constructed with five or six morphemes.
*Verbs can be finite or non-finite (non-finite endings: &quot;-n&quot;, &quot;-el&quot;, &quot;-etew&quot;, &quot;-lu&quot;, &quot;-am&quot;, etc.), are intransitive or transitive and are conjugated according to person (first, second and third), number (singular, dual and plural), voice (active, agentless passive and reflexive-reciprocal, plus two applicatives) and mood (indicative, imperative and subjunctive). In the indicative, the present (zero) and future (&quot;-(y)a&quot;) tenses are distinguished. There are a number of aspects: the progressive, resultative and habitual are well established; some forms that seem to mark some subtype of perfect are also found. Other verb morphology includes an evidential marker (reportative-mirative), directionals (cislocative, translocative, andative and ambulative, plus an interruptive and continuous action marker) and modal markers (sudden action, faked action, immediate action, etc.). There is productive noun incorporation, and the case can be made for root compounding morphology.
* &quot;Spanish loan verbs have generally been adapted into Mapudungu in the third person singular form. An example is the Mapudungu verb for &quot;to be able&quot; is &quot;pwede,&quot; and the Spanish translation for &quot;he can&quot; is &quot;puede.&quot;

The indicative present paradigm for an intransitive verb like &quot; &#x27;enter&#x27; is as follows:

What some authors have described as an inverse system (similar to the ones described for Algonquian languages) can be seen from the forms of a transitive verb like &quot; &#x27;see&#x27;. The &#x27;intransitive&#x27; forms are the following:
The &#x27;transitive&#x27; forms are the following (only singular forms are provided here):
When a third person interacts with a first or second person, the forms are direct (without &quot;-e&quot;) or inverse (with &quot;-e&quot;); the speaker has no choice. When two third persons interact, two different forms are available. The direct form (&#x27;) is appropriate when the agent is topical (the central figure in that particular passage). By contrast, the inverse form (&#x27;) is appropriate when the patient is topical. Thus, &#x27; means &#x27;the man saw the woman&#x27;, while &#x27; means something like &#x27;the man was seen by the woman&#x27;. However, it is not a passive construction; the passive would be &quot;&quot; &#x27;the man was seen/someone saw the man&#x27;. Therefore, a better translation may be &#x27;it was the woman who saw the man&#x27; or &#x27;the woman was the one who saw the man&#x27;.

==Language revitalization efforts==
The Chilean Ministry of Education created the Office of Intercultural Bilingual Education in 1996 in an attempt to include indigenous language in education. By 2004, there were still no programs in public schools in Santiago, despite the fact that 50% of the country’s Mapuche population resides in and around the area of Santiago. 30.4% of Mapuche students never graduate eighth grade and they have high rates of poverty. Most language revitalization efforts have been in rural communities and these efforts have been received in different ways by the Mapuche population: Ortiz says some feel that teaching Mapudungu in schools will set their children behind other Chileans, which reveals that their culture has been devalued by the Chilean government for so long that, unfortunately, some Mapuche people have come to see their language as worthless, too, which is a direct and lasting impact of colonization.
Despite the absence of Mapudungun instruction in public schools, there are limited language course offerings at select Chilean universities, such as Pontifical Catholic University of Chile.

==Studies==
===Older works===
The formalization and normalization of Mapudungun was effected by the first Mapudungun grammar published by the Jesuit priest Luis de Valdivia in 1606 (&quot;Arte y Gramatica General de la Lengva que Corre en Todo el Reyno de Chile&quot;). More important is the &quot;Arte de la Lengua General del Reyno de Chile&quot; by the Jesuit Andrés Fabrés (1765, Lima) composed of a grammar and dictionary. In 1776 three volumes in Latin were published in Westphalia (&quot;Chilidúgú sive Res Chilenses&quot;) by the German Jesuit Bernhard Havestadt.

The work by Febrés was used as a basic preparation from 1810 for missionary priests going into the regions occupied by the Mapuche people. A corrected version was completed in 1846 and a summary, without a dictionary in 1864.

A work based on Febrés&#x27; book is the &quot;Breve Metodo della Lingua Araucana y Dizionario Italo-Araucano e Viceversa&quot; by the Italian Octaviano de Niza in 1888. It was destroyed in a fire at the Convento de San Francisco in Valdivia in 1928.

===Modern works===
The most comprehensive works to date are the ones by Augusta (1903, 1916). Salas (1992, 2006) is an introduction for non-specialists, featuring an ethnographic introduction and a valuable text collection as well. Zúñiga (2006) includes a complete grammatical description, a bilingual dictionary, some texts and an audio CD with text recordings (educational material, a traditional folktale and six contemporary poems). Smeets (1989) and Zúñiga (2000) are for specialists only. Fernández-Garay (2005) introduces both the language and the culture. Catrileo (1995) and the dictionaries by Hernández &amp; Ramos are trilingual (Spanish, English and Mapudungun).

<text>Depersonalization is a dissociative phenomenon characterized by a subjective feeling of detachment from oneself, manifesting as a sense of disconnection from one&#x27;s thoughts, emotions, sensations, or actions, and often accompanied by a feeling of observing oneself from an external perspective. Subjects perceive that the world has become vague, dreamlike, surreal, or strange, leading to a diminished sense of individuality or identity. Sufferers often feel as though they are observing the world from a distance, as if separated by a barrier &quot;behind glass&quot;. They maintain insight into the subjective nature of their experience, recognizing that it pertains to their own perception rather than altering objective reality. This distinction between subjective experience and objective reality distinguishes depersonalization from delusions, where individuals firmly believe in false perceptions as genuine truths. Depersonalization is also distinct from derealization, which involves a sense of detachment from the external world rather than from oneself.

Depersonalization-derealization disorder refers to chronic depersonalization, classified as a dissociative disorder in both the DSM-4 and the DSM-5, which underscores its association with disruptions in consciousness, memory, identity, or perception. This classification is based on the findings that depersonalization and derealization are prevalent in other dissociative disorders including dissociative identity disorder.

Though degrees of depersonalization can happen to anyone who is subject to temporary anxiety or stress, chronic depersonalization is more related to individuals who have experienced a severe trauma or prolonged stress/anxiety. Depersonalization-derealization is the single most important symptom in the spectrum of dissociative disorders, including dissociative identity disorder and &quot;dissociative disorder not otherwise specified&quot; (DD-NOS). It is also a prominent symptom in some other non-dissociative disorders, such as anxiety disorders, clinical depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, schizoid personality disorder, hypothyroidism or endocrine disorders, schizotypal personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder, migraines, and sleep deprivation; it can also be a symptom of some types of neurological seizure, and it has been suggested that there could be common aetiology between depersonalization symptoms and panic disorder, on the basis of their high co-occurrence rates.

In social psychology, and in particular self-categorization theory, the term &quot;depersonalization&quot; has a different meaning and refers to &quot;the stereotypical perception of the self as an example of some defining social category&quot;.

== Description ==
Individuals who experience depersonalization feel divorced from their own personal self by sensing their body sensations, feelings, emotions, behaviors, etc. as not belonging to the same person or identity. Often a person who has experienced depersonalization claims that things seem unreal or hazy. Also, a recognition of a self breaks down (hence the name). Depersonalization can result in very high anxiety levels, which further increase these perceptions.

Depersonalization is a subjective experience of unreality in one&#x27;s self, while derealization is unreality of the outside world. Although most authors currently regard depersonalization (personal/self) and derealization (reality/surroundings) as independent constructs, many do not want to separate derealization from depersonalization.

== History ==
In 1904, Freud described his own experience of depersonalization experience at the Athens&#x27; Acropolis. He described the incident 32 years later, in 1936. He interpreted his experience as an unconscious psychological defense, in which he was repressing feelings of guilt for outliving his father, whose cause of death remained unknown.

In his case study of the Wolf Man, Freud emphasized that depersonalization and derealization serve psychologically defensive functions. A young Russian man known as the &quot;Wolf Man&quot; experienced derealization, which is the sensation of being separated from his surroundings by a veil. This description of being separated from one&#x27;s surroundings by a veil is reminiscent of derealization. This symptom was accompanied by fear of wolves. Freud&#x27;s case description revolves around the man&#x27;s dream of white wolves in a tree peering at him through an open window.

== Epidemiology ==
Despite the distressing nature of symptoms, estimating the prevalence rates of depersonalization is challenging due to inconsistent definitions and variable timeframes.

Depersonalization is a symptom of anxiety disorders, such as panic disorder. It can also accompany sleep deprivation (often occurring when experiencing jet lag), migraine,
epilepsy (especially temporal lobe epilepsy,
complex-partial seizure, both as part of the aura and during the seizure),
obsessive-compulsive disorder, severe stress or trauma, anxiety, the use of recreational drugs
especially cannabis, hallucinogens, ketamine, and MDMA, certain types of meditation, deep hypnosis, extended mirror or crystal gazing, sensory deprivation, and mild-to-moderate head injury with little or full loss of consciousness (less likely if unconscious for more than 30 minutes).
Interoceptive exposure is a non-pharmacological method that can be used to induce depersonalization.

In the general population, transient depersonalization and derealization are common, having a lifetime prevalence between 26 and 74%. A random community-based survey of 1,000 adults in the US rural south found a 1-year depersonalization prevalence rate at 19%. Standardized diagnostic interviews have reported prevalence rates of 1.2% to 1.7% over one month in UK samples, and a rate of 2.4% in a single-point Canadian sample. In clinical populations, prevalence rates range from 1% to 16%, with varying rates in specific psychiatric disorders such as panic disorder and unipolar depression. Co-occurrence between depersonalization/derealization and panic disorder is common, suggesting a possible common etiology. Co-morbidity with other disorders does not influence symptom severity consistently.

Depersonalization is reported 2–4 times more in women than in men, but depersonalization/derealization disorder is diagnosed approximately equally across men and women, with symptoms typically emerging around the age of 16.

A similar and overlapping concept called ipseity disturbance (ipse is Latin for &quot;self&quot; or &quot;itself&quot;) may be part of the core process of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. However, specific to the schizophrenia spectrum seems to be &quot;a &quot;dis&quot;location of first-person perspective such that self and other or self and world may seem to be non-distinguishable, or in which the individual self or field of consciousness takes on an inordinate significance in relation to the objective or intersubjective world&quot; (emphasis in original).

For the purposes of evaluation and measurement, depersonalization can be conceived of as a construct and scales are now available to map its dimensions in A study of undergraduate students found that individuals high on the depersonalization/derealization subscale of the Dissociative Experiences Scale exhibited a more pronounced cortisol response in stress. Individuals high on the absorption subscale, which measures a subject&#x27;s experiences of concentration to the exclusion of awareness of other events, showed weaker cortisol responses.

== Causes ==
Depersonalization can arise from a variety of factors, of both a psychological and physiological nature. Common immediate precipitants include instances of severe stress, depressive episodes, panic attacks, and the consumption of psychoactive substances such as marijuana and hallucinogens. Additionally, there exists a correlation between frequent depersonalization and childhood interpersonal trauma, particularly cases involving emotional maltreatment.

A case-control study conducted at a specialized depersonalization clinic included 164 individuals with chronic depersonalization symptoms, of which 40 linked their symptoms to illicit drug use. Phenomenological similarity between drug-induced and non-drug groups was observed, and comparison with matched controls further supported the lack of distinction. The severity of clinical depersonalization symptoms remains consistent regardless of whether they are triggered by illicit drugs or psychological factors.

=== Pharmacological ===
Depersonalization has been described by some as a desirable state, particularly by those that have experienced it under the influence of mood-altering recreational drugs. It is an effect of dissociatives and psychedelics, as well as a possible side effect of caffeine, alcohol, amphetamine, cannabis, and antidepressants. It is a classic withdrawal symptom from many drugs.

Benzodiazepine dependence, which can occur with long-term use of benzodiazepines, can induce chronic depersonalization symptomatology and perceptual disturbances in some people, even in those who are taking a stable daily dosage, and it can also become a protracted feature of the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome.

Lieutenant Colonel Dave Grossman, in his book &quot;On Killing&quot;, suggests that military training artificially creates depersonalization in soldiers, suppressing empathy and making it easier for them to kill other human beings.

Graham Reed (1974) claimed that depersonalization occurs in relation to the experience of falling in love.

=== Situational ===
Experiences of depersonalization/derealization occur on a continuum, ranging from momentary episodes in healthy individuals under conditions of stress, fatigue, or drug use, to severe and chronic disorders that can persist for decades. Several studies found that up to 66% of individuals in life-threatening accidents report at least transient depersonalization during or immediately after the accidents.

Several studies, but not all, found age to be a significant factor: adolescents and young adults in the normal population reported the highest rate. In a study, 46% of college students reported at least one significant episode in the previous year. In another study, 20% of patients with minor head injury experience significant depersonalization and derealization.

In general infantry and special forces soldiers, measures of depersonalization and derealization increased significantly after training that includes experiences of uncontrollable stress, semi-starvation, sleep deprivation, as well as lack of control over hygiene, movement, communications, and social interactions.

=== Biological ===
Studies have linked dysregulation of the immune system with depersonalisation. Researchers compared protein expression in serum samples of individuals with depersonalisation/derealization disorder (DPDR, DDD) and healthy controls, and found that many key proteins involved in maintaining homeostasis were present at altered levels. Decreased levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), complement C1q subcomponent subunit B, and apolipoprotein A-IV, and increased levels of alpha-1-antichymotrypsin (SERPINA3) were observed in patients with DPDR. Furthermore, expressions of CRP and SERPINA3 were found to be linked with the ability to inhibit cognitive interference of DPDR.

== Psychobiological mechanisms ==
=== Proximate mechanism ===
Depersonalization involves disruptions in the integration of interoceptive and exteroceptive signals, particularly in response to acute anxiety or trauma-related events. Studies spanning from 1992 to 2020 have highlighted abnormalities in primary somatosensory cortex processing and insula activity as contributing factors to depersonalization experiences. Additionally, abnormal EEG activities, notably in the theta band, suggest potential biomarkers for emotion processing, attention, and working memory, though specific oscillatory signatures associated with depersonalization are yet to be determined. Reduced brain activities in sensory processing units, along with alterations in visceral signal processing regions, are observed, particularly in the early stages of information processing.

Furthermore, vestibular signal processing, crucial for balance and spatial orientation, is increasingly recognized as a factor contributing to feelings of disembodiment during depersonalization experiences. Research suggests that abnormal activity in the left hemisphere may play a role, although abnormalities in right hemisphere brain activity, responsible for self-awareness and emotion processing, may also contribute to depersonalization symptoms. Higher activity in the right parietal lobe&#x27;s angular gyrus has been linked to more severe depersonalisation, supporting this idea.

Potential involvement of serotonergic, endogenous opioid, and glutamatergic NMDA pathways has also been proposed, alongside alterations in metabolic activity in the sensory association cortex, prefrontal hyperactivation, and limbic inhibition in response to aversive stimuli revealed by brain imaging studies.

In addition to this, research suggests that individuals with depersonalization often exhibit autonomic blunting, characterized by reduced physiological responses to stressors or emotional stimuli. This blunting may reflect a diminished capacity to engage with the external world or to experience emotions fully, contributing to the subjective sense of detachment from oneself. Additionally, dysregulation of the HPA axis, which governs the body&#x27;s stress response system, is frequently observed in individuals who experience depersonalization. This dysregulation can manifest as alterations in cortisol levels and responsiveness to stress, potentially exacerbating feelings of detachment and unreality.

=== Ultimate mechanism ===
Depersonalization is a classic response to acute trauma, and may be highly prevalent in individuals involved in different traumatic situations including motor vehicle collision and imprisonment.

Psychologically depersonalization can, just like dissociation in general, be considered a type of coping mechanism, used to decrease the intensity of unpleasant experience, whether that is something as mild as stress or something as severe as chronically high anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder.

The decrease in anxiety and psychobiological hyperarousal helps preserving adaptive behaviors and resources under threat or danger.

Depersonalization is an overgeneralized reaction in that it doesn&#x27;t diminish just the unpleasant experience, but more or less all experience – leading to a feeling of being detached from the world and experiencing it in a more bland way. An important distinction must be made between depersonalization as a mild, short-term reaction to unpleasant experience and depersonalization as a chronic symptom stemming from a severe mental disorder such as PTSD or dissociative identity disorder.

Chronic symptoms may represent persistence of depersonalization beyond the situations under threat.

== Treatment ==
Currently, no universally accepted treatment guidelines have been established for depersonalization. Pharmacotherapy remains a primary avenue of treatment, with medications such as clomipramine, fluoxetine, lamotrigine, and opioid antagonists being commonly prescribed. However, it is important to note that none of these medications have demonstrated a potent anti-dissociative effect in managing symptoms.

In addition to pharmacological interventions, various psychotherapeutic techniques have been employed in attempts to alleviate depersonalization symptoms. Modalities such as trauma-focused therapy and cognitive-behavioral techniques have been utilized, although their efficacy remains uncertain and not firmly established.
Treatment is dependent on the underlying cause, whether it is organic or psychological in origin. If depersonalization is a symptom of neurological disease, then diagnosis and treatment of the specific disease is the first approach. Depersonalization can be a cognitive symptom of such diseases as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, multiple sclerosis (MS), or any other neurological disease affecting the brain. For those with both depersonalization and migraine, tricyclic antidepressants are often prescribed.

If depersonalization is a symptom of psychological causes such as developmental trauma, treatment depends on the diagnosis. In case of dissociative identity disorder or DD-NOS as a developmental disorder, in which extreme developmental trauma interferes with formation of a single cohesive identity, treatment requires proper psychotherapy, and—in the case of additional (co-morbid) disorders such as eating disorders—a team of specialists treating such an individual. It can also be a symptom of borderline personality disorder, which can be treated in the long term with proper psychotherapy and psychopharmacology.

The treatment of chronic depersonalization is considered in depersonalization disorder.

A 2001 Russian study showed that naloxone, a drug used to reverse the intoxicating effects of opioid drugs, can successfully treat depersonalization disorder. According to the study: &quot;In three of 14 patients, depersonalization symptoms disappeared entirely and seven patients showed a marked improvement. The therapeutic effect of naloxone provides evidence for the role of the endogenous opioid system in the pathogenesis of depersonalization.&quot; The anticonvulsant drug lamotrigine has shown some success in treating symptoms of depersonalization, often in combination with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and is the first drug of choice at the depersonalisation research unit at King&#x27;s College London.

== Research directions ==
Interest in DPDR has increased over the past few decades, leading to a large accumulation of literature on dissociative disorders. There has been a shift towards the use of research studies, rather than case studies to understand depersonalization. However, there remains a lack of solid consensus on its definition and scales used for assessment. Salami and colleagues argued that studies of electrophysiological depersonalization-derealization markers are urgently needed, and that future research should use analysis methods that can account for the integration of interoceptive and exteroceptive signals.

The Depersonalisation Research Unit at the Institute of Psychiatry in London conducts research into depersonalization disorder. Researchers there use the acronym DPAFU (Depersonalisation and Feelings of Unreality) as a shortened label for the disorder.

In a 2020 article in the Journal Nature, Vesuna, et al. describe experimental findings which show that layer 5 of the retrosplenial cortex is likely responsible for dissociative states of consciousness in mammals.
