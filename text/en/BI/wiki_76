<text>The Clearance Diving Branch is the specialist diving unit of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) whose versatile role covers all spheres of military diving, and includes explosive ordnance disposal and maritime counter-terrorism. The Branch has evolved from traditional maritime diving, and explosive ordnance disposal, to include a special operations focus.

==History==
The RAN has used divers on a regular basis since the 1920s, but it was not until World War II that clearance diving operations came to the fore, with RAN divers working alongside Royal Navy divers to remove naval mines from British waters, and from the waters of captured ports on the European mainland such as Hugh Syme, John Mould, George Gosse and Leon Goldsworthy all highly decorated. RAN divers were also used in performing duties including reconnaissance of amphibious landing sites. The skills learned in the European theatre were brought back to Australia, and used in the war against Japan. After the war, RAN divers were used during the clean-up of Australian and Papua New Guinea waters of defensive mines.

The utility of clearance and commando divers demonstrated during and after World War II prompted the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board to establish a clearance diving branch within the RAN in 1951. Divers were initially attached to the Underwater Research and Development Unit, based at . In 1956, they were organised into a separate Mobile Clearance Diving Team. In March 1966, the divers underwent further reorganisation, splitting into two Clearance Diving Teams. Clearance Diving Team 1 (CDT 1) was the operational team assigned to mine clearance and reconnaissance operations throughout the Australia Station, while Clearance Diving Team 2 (CDT 2) was dedicated to mine warfare in the Sydney area, but was not cleared for operations outside this area.

In late 1966, Clearance Diving Team 3 (CDT 3) was established specifically for deployment to the Vietnam War to assist the overworked United States Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal units, and to give RAN personnel in clearance diving work in an operational environment. Sending CDT 1 or CDT 2, in full or in part, would have impacted on the teams&#x27; existing commitments, along with the continuity of training and postings. CDT 3 was formed from available personnel; this was sufficient to keep a six-man team on station in Vietnam from early 1967 until early 1971, with six-month deployments. CDT 3 was disbanded at the end of the Vietnam War, but the designation is reactivated for overseas wartime deployments, including in 1991 for the Gulf War, and again in 2003 for the Iraq War.

==Structure==
The Clearance Diving Branch consists of:
* Clearance Diving Team One (AUSCDT1); assigned to the east of Australia and based at HMAS &quot;Waterhen&quot; in New South Wales
* Clearance Diving Team Four (AUSCDT4); assigned to the west of Australia and based at HMAS &quot;Stirling&quot; in Western Australia

For overseas operational deployments, the designation of Clearance Diving Team Three (AUSCDT3) is used for a specifically formed team.

The Royal Australian Naval Reserve has eight Reserve Diving Teams (ANRDT) which provide supplementary or surge capability in support of regular CDTs in addition to localised fleet underwater taskings:

* Reserve Diving Team Five (ANRDT5) – based at HMAS &quot;Waterhen&quot;
* Reserve Diving Team Six (ANRDT6) – based in Melbourne
* Reserve Diving Team Seven (ANRDT7) – based at HMAS &quot;Stirling&quot;
* Reserve Diving Team Eight (ANRDT8) – based in Brisbane
* Reserve Diving Team Nine (ANRDT9) – based in Adelaide
* Reserve Diving Team Ten (ANRDT10) – based in Hobart
* Reserve Diving Team Eleven (ANRDT11) – based in Darwin
* Reserve Diving Team Twelve (ANRDT12) – based in Cairns

==Role==
The Clearance Diving Branch force elements are:

1. Maritime Tactical Operations (MTO):
*Clandestine beach reconnaissance (including back of beach operations up to 2 km inland)
*Clandestine hydrographic survey of seabed prior to an amphibious assault
*Clandestine clearance or demolition of sea mines and/or obstacles
*Clandestine placing of demolitions charges for the purpose of diversion or demonstration (ship/wharf attacks)
*Clandestine document collection

2. Mine Counter Measures (MCM):
*Location and disposal of sea mines in shallow waters
*Rendering safe and recovering enemy mines
*The search for and disposal of ordnance below the high water mark
*Clearance of surface ordnance in port or on naval facilities
*Search for, rendering safe or disposal of all ordnance in RAN ships and facilities

3. Underwater Battle Damage Repair (UBDR):
*Surface supplied breathing apparatus diving
*Use of underwater tools including welders, explosive nailguns and pneumatic drills and chainsaws

4. Task Group Explosive Ordnance Disposal (TGEOD):
* Embarking on warships for Operation MANITOU rotations in the Middle East to provide specialist support for boarding parties with improvised explosive devices (IED) and explosive ordnance

5. Maritime counter terrorism-explosive ordnance disposal (MCT-EOD):
* Provide explosive ordnance (EOD) and improvised explosive device disposal (IEDD) support at a rapid speed for direct assault missions conducted by Australian Defence Force units.

A Clearance Diver may be posted to a Clearance Diving Team, &quot;Huon&quot; Class Minehunter Coastal ship, training position in the Australian Defence Force Diving School at HMAS &quot;Penguin&quot; and can apply to serve in the Tactical Assault Group-East (TAG-E).

Since January 2002, Special Duties Units of Clearance Divers from AUSCDT1 and AUSCDT4 have provided the maritime counter terrorism element of Tactical Assault Group-East (TAG-E), attached to the Australian Army 2nd Commando Regiment, which became operational on 22 July 2002 to respond to terrorist incidents in the Eastern States of Australia. Clearance Divers need to successfully pass the Army Special Forces Screen Test and then successfully complete specific elements of Commando Reinforcement Training before serving in either the water platoon as an assaulter or in the water sniper team in the sniper platoon. Service in TAG-E is normally 12 to 18 months online before rotating back into the Branch with divers able to rotate back into TAG-E after 12 to 18 months offline.

==Selection and training==
The RAN&#x27;s diver training program is commenced with a 5-day Clearance Diver Aptitude Assessment, or CDAA, focused on demonstrating in-water confidence, physical endurance, mental resilience and attention, and supported through psychological assessment. CDAA is aimed to ensure officer and sailor clearance diver candidates have the right aptitude to commence the lengthy training program. Historically there have been a few variants, including the 10-day clearance diver acceptance test (CDAT), colloquially known as &quot;hell week&quot;. During CDAT, candidates began each day at 02:00, and were put through over thirty staged dives designed to test their strength and endurance. CDAT was shortened to a 7-day program, then into the current 5-day program with an increasing emphasis on in-water confidence and endurance.

Upon passing aptitude assessment, students must successfully pass the 60-week Clearance Diver Initial Employment Training course. In 2019, the first females graduated from the Clearance Diver Initial Employment Training course. Clearance Divers who are promoted to Leading Seaman Clearance Diver complete the Intermediate Clearance Diver course and for Petty Officer Clearance Diver complete the Advanced Clearance Diver course. Officers complete the Clearance Diving component of the Mine Warfare and Clearance Diving Officers course.

The MCT-EOD role requires clearance divers to be trained in specialist insertion techniques including diving, fast roping and parachuting.

==Operations==
*In the Vietnam War, Clearance Diving Team 3 was awarded the United States Presidential Unit Citation, the United States Navy Unit Commendation twice, and the United States Meritorious Unit Commendation for its mine clearance work: see Non-US recipients of US gallantry awards.
*Took part in Operation Navy Help
*1991: Performed mine clearance operations for coalition forces during the Gulf War.
*1999: In the East Timor independence crisis as part of INTERFET, CDTs clandestinely mapped harbours and beaches in preparation for the arrival of peacekeepers.
*2003: In Operation Falconer (the invasion phase of the Iraq War), CDTs were attached to Commander Task Unit 55.4.3, along with US and British partners, tasked with conducting deep/shallow water mine counter measure operations to clearing shipping lanes. CDTs notably participated in opening up the port at Umm Qasr.
*2003–2009: In Operation Catalyst (post-invasion Iraq), CDTs were attached to Coalition counter improvise explosive device (IED) task forces.
*2008–2013: In Operation Slipper – CDTs deployed explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) technicians in Afghanistan and provided tactical boarding parties for ships combating smugglers and piracy.

<text>Airfield Defence Guards (ADG) are a mustering of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) that are dedicated to the security and ground defence of airbases and other military aviation assets. Other duties include training other RAAF personnel, in skills such as the handling of small arms and infantry tactics. They do not, however, operate anti-aircraft artillery or missiles (which are the responsibility of the army and in particular, the Royal Australian Artillery). 

The mustering&#x27;s members, commonly known as &quot;Adgies&quot;, are mostly employed in security forces () squadrons. The role of SECFOR squadrons is the protection of RAAF equipment, personnel, assets and facilities. While SECFOR training includes countering attacks by hostile special forces – in addition to guerilla, terrorist and other irregular military – the ADGs are not special forces. 

ADGs are commanded by commissioned officers known as Ground Defence Officers () who receive initial training at the Australian Army&#x27;s Royal Military College (RMC), Duntroon. Following graduation from RMC, GRDEFOs undertake the Army Regimental Officer Basic Course (Infantry) prior to RAAF-specific training at the RAAF Security and Fire School (RAAFSFS), at RAAF Base Amberley.

ADG are comparable to the British Royal Air Force Regiment, USAF Security Forces, and the RNZAF Security Forces.

==History==

===Pre World War II===
From 1929 the RAAF began to establish an Aerodrome Defence Scheme (ADS), primarily utilizing aircrafthands to provide local defence of airfields, although it was initially limited in scope. Following the acquisition of the required equipment training began in 1931, including in both anti-aircraft and ground defence roles. Between 1931 and 1939 this also included exercises with the Army, during which Aerodrome Defence Sections defended an area against attacks by Australian Army units and RAAF aircraft. In 1939 it was directed that the scheme be expanded to include all units and stations.

===Second World War===

While the RAAF did not face a significant ground threat in the first years of World War II, an Air Force Guard mustering was proposed in 1940. This mustering was to receive training in infantry tactics to defend RAAF bases against attack and would be modelled on the Royal Air Force Regiment. The idea never progressed and those recruited for the task were assigned to other musterings. Following the bombing of Darwin in 1942 and ground attacks on Allied air bases, it was realised that the RAAF needed to defend its own airfields and that ground defence training was required for RAAF personnel.

Following a request to the Army, Lieutenant Colonel H.H. Carr was seconded to the RAAF from 2/22 Battalion AIF in May 1942. Further secondments of infantry officers and NCOs followed and the RAAF Defence School was established at Hamilton, Victoria in September of that year. The school commenced training Army and RAAF officers and NCOs as Aerodrome Defence Officers and Aerodrome Defence Instructors, who were then posted to RAAF units to deliver ground defence training.

In October 1942, the Security Guards Unit was formed at Livingstone Field, Northern Territory. All RAAF guards were posted to this unit, irrespective of where they were serving. The Security Guards Unit was charged with providing guards for operational bases both within Australia and overseas. Trainees were instructed in the employment of anti-aircraft guns, ground patrolling, scouting and hand-to-hand combat. At first the unit had a strength of 567 personnel, increasing to 943 by July 1943; in that year the unit moved to Darwin. The unit was renamed No. 1 Airfield Defence Squadron in April 1945.
A second unit, the Defence Pool, was established at Noemfoor in December 1944. It is believed that guards may have been trained at the Security Guards Unit and then posted to the Defence Pool for operational deployment. A detachment of the Defence Pool was deployed to Morotai island in early 1945 in order to prepare a camp for the arrival of the main party of the unit. The Defence Pool was subsequently ordered to be disbanded on 28 March 1945. A reconsideration led to the establishment of No. 2 Airfield Defence Squadron.

By May 1945, ADGs had participated in a number of operations, including the recapture of Tarakan, Brunei and Balikpapan. They suffered casualties, among them Leading Aircraftman Thomas Irvine and Corporal Clarence Tully who were killed during Japanese raids on Tarakan airfield. LAC Irvine died on 5 May 1945 and is believed to be the first ADG killed by enemy action. He is buried in the Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery on Labuan Island.

=== Cold War ===

====Post War====
Following the end of hostilities, both Airfield Defence Squadrons were disbanded on 19 November 1945. Aerodrome Defence Officers (ADOs) and Aerodrome Defence Instructors (ADIs) were retained to deliver basic ground defence instruction to RAAF members during initial and continuation training. A significant proportion of RAAF National Service recruits received training in ground defence techniques. This included the use of the .303 rifle, Thompson Sub-Machine Gun, Bren Light Machine Gun and hand grenades, in addition to fieldcraft skills. No. 1 Airfield Defence Squadron was re-established at Mallala, South Australia as a National Service unit in 1951, then once again disbanded in 1952. There is evidence to suggest that the RAAF considered the introduction of an armoured car capability in the 1950s, with ADIs attending training on Staghound vehicles with the Army at Puckapunyal; this project was never brought to fruition.

In June 1965 a submission to the Air Board requested the establishment of 455 positions to provide for the defence of the eleven major RAAF bases in Australia, as well as overseas bases in Malaysia, Thailand and South Vietnam. In the end, the ADG mustering was re-established in October 1965 with an authorised strength of 220 new positions in addition to the remustering of all Drill Instructors and ADIs. After the outbreak of the Vietnam War, Australia was asked to increase its level of commitment. To meet these new demands, the RAAF deployed a number of aircraft to Phan Rang Airbase, South Vietnam, in 1966. The USAF Security Police unit assigned to the base, asked the RAAF to contribute to the defence of the base.

====Vietnam War====
ADG Flights were deployed to South Vietnam with 2 Squadron at Phan Rang Air Base and No. 1 Operational Support Unit (1OSU) at Vung Tau. ADGs were also deployed to Ubon Air Base, Thailand to protect the RAAF detachment based there, including 79 Squadron flying Sabre jets. In Vietnam ADGs conducted both static security tasks and security patrols outside the base perimeter, disrupting the Viet Cong ability to conduct stand-off attacks against the bases. Corporal N.E. Power became the first airman to win the Military Medal (MM) since the Second World War for a night action on 11 February 1970, during which an enemy reconnaissance party was successfully ambushed near the perimeter of the Phan Rang base. Airfield Defence Guards also provided most of the door gunners on UH-1 Iroquois helicopters with No. 9 Squadron during the war.

When the government of South Vietnam collapsed in 1975, Australia ordered the evacuation of its embassy in Saigon. The final mission undertaken by ADGs in Vietnam was to provide security for the evacuation. The &quot;last&quot; evacuation aircraft was severely overloaded and four ADGs were left on the tarmac at Tan Son Nhut airfield, each armed with a pistol and four rounds of ammunition; a C-130 was diverted from Thailand to evacuate them later in the day. Over 350 ADGs served in Vietnam, six being killed in the conflict. In addition to the MM awarded to Powers, GRDEFOs and ADGs were awarded an MBE, eight mentions in dispatches and four Distinguished Flying Medals of the ten awarded to RAAF members.

====1972–1999====
After withdrawal from Vietnam the ADG mustering was reduced in numbers, with Rifle Flights posted to RAAF Bases Amberley, Fairbairn, Richmond and Williamtown and ADGs manning instructional posts at other establishments.
Although the RAAF contemplated disbanding the mustering in the mid-1980s, the years between the Vietnam War and the 1999 deployment to East Timor were spent consolidating tactics and techniques such as reconnaissance skills and Quick Reaction Force (QRF) operations. 2AFDS was reformed on 17 March 1983 with the headquarters located at RAAF Base Richmond and the Rifle Flights remaining dispersed. The unit was eventually consolidated at RAAF Base Amberley in January 1989. It regularly deployed on RAAF and joint exercises such as those in the Kangaroo series along with occasional deployments to Malaysia and New Zealand.

New capabilities were trialled, such as scout dogs to aid in detection and tracking of enemy parties and the employment on Exercise Pitch Black 1990 of M113 Armoured Personnel Carriers from the Army&#x27;s 2nd Cavalry Regiment to provide armoured mobility for the QRF. Both capabilities may be considered to have matured in recent years with the attachment of Security Police (SECPOL) Military Working Dog (MWD) teams to ADG patrols and the introduction into RAAF service of the Bushmaster Infantry Mobility Vehicles. In 1992 2AFDS became the first non-flying unit to be awarded the Duke of Gloucester Cup.

The period saw a generational change in weapons and equipment on issue to ADGs; jungle green uniforms were replaced by the Disruptive Pattern Combat Uniform (DPCU), the L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle (SLR), M16 and F1 Sub-Machine Gun were replaced by the F88 Austeyr assault rifle and Vietnam-era radios were replaced with the Raven series of VHF and HF sets. ADGs continued to deliver weapon and ground defence training to RAAF personnel and provided the majority of instructors for recruit, apprentice and initial officer training. 

The scope of this role, the longest and most continuous of the ADG mustering and its predecessors, may be gauged by the delivery of conversion training from the L1A1 SLR to the F88 rifle for every member of the RAAF. At the same time the Ground Defence Training Sections, manned on each base by 3–5 ADGs and GRDEFOs, commenced delivery of additional ground defence training for all RAAF members as the service transitioned to an expeditionary role.

In 1992 1AFDS was reformed at RAAF Base Tindal, Northern Territory as a Ready Reserve unit. The Ready Reserve Scheme involved recruits enlisting for 12 months full-time service, completing identical recruit and trade training to that undertaken by regular airmen, followed by 4 years part-time service. The cadre staff of 1AFDS consisted of Permanent Air Force (PAF) GRDEFOs and ADG NCOs; while the Ready Reserve Scheme was abolished in 1996, the RAAF implemented the Ground Defence Reserve Group based upon a similar concept, although with the full-time service commitment reduced to 9 months. This scheme is still in operation.

As individuals or in small groups, ADGs and GREDFOs deployed on peacekeeping operations in the Sinai and Bougainville, were attached to Army units providing Rifle Company Butterworth rotations and deployed to the Middle East with No. 33 Squadron in 1998. 2AFDS also deployed a Rifle Flight to assist with the evacuation of civilians from Cambodia in 1997 as part of Operation Vista.

=== Current history ===

====East Timor====
Whilst preparing for deployment to Exercise Crocodile 99, 2AFDS, along with No. 381 Expeditionary Combat Support Squadron (381ECSS) and 382ECSS, were warned out for duty in East Timor on Operation Warden. Both 381ECSS and 382ECSS had ADGs and GRDEFOs on strength. 2AFDS and 381ECSS commenced deployment to Comoro Airfield, Dili, on 20 September 1999. 381ECSS began arriving at Cakung Airfield, Baucau on 11 October 1999. 

2AFDS undertook static security, access control and reconnaissance patrol tasks, in addition to establishing observation posts and providing a Quick Reaction Force (QRF). Reinforcements arrived on 4 November 1999 comprising 37 members of 3AFDS, an integrated permanent and reserve squadron headquartered at RAAF Base Amberley, disbanded in December 2006. The additional manpower allowed the squadron to assume responsibility for the Dili heliport in December.

2AFDS was awarded a Meritorious Unit Citation and the Commanding Officer, Squadron Leader J.D. Leo, received the Distinguished Service Medal for performance during Operation Warden.

====Solomon Islands====
ADGs and GRDEFOs deployed to Henderson Field, Honiara as part of the RAAF component of Joint Task Force 635 on Operation Anode, the ADF contribution to the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI). Following severe rioting in April 2006, members of 2AFDS were deployed as part of the ADF response to support police in reestablishing law and order. A further link with the Solomon Islands exists via Protective Service Officer Adam Dunning of the Australian Federal Police, who was shot and killed in Honiara in December 2004. Although deployed to the Solomon Islands in his civilian role, Dunning was a reservist ADG and had previously served with 2AFDS in East Timor.

====Iraq====

As part of Operation Catalyst, ADGs provided force protection to the RAAF air traffic control detachment at Baghdad International Airport, during 2003–04. Thirteen ADGs from 2AFDS deployed to Baghdad with Security Detachment (SECDET) 13, the Australian combat team providing security for the Australian Embassy and close protection for officials. The ADGs were integrated within the infantry component of SECDET 13, drawn from the 7th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (7RAR). The Commanding Officer 7RAR, Lieutenant Colonel Shane Gabriel, commenced his military career as an RAAF GRDEFO, serving with 2AFDS and as Base Ground Defence Officer, RAAF Base Tindal; he had also served with the RAF Regiment.

====Afghanistan====
Tarin Kowt:
A squadron minus contingent of members from both no.1 and 2 Airfield Defence Squadrons took responsibility of the ground defence for Multinational base Tarin Kowt from October 2012, consisting of rotation 1&amp;2 Australian Security Force. Their role consisted of providing force protection, ground defence patrols in the close defence area and providing security for entry control. 
Additionally, they were responsible for counter attack, counter penetration during instances of base attack or receiving indirect fire, as part of their quick reaction force (QRF) responsibilities. The second rotation continued until the base was downscaled and eventually handed over to the Afghan National Army (ANA) in late 2014. 

Kandahar:
The RAAF Control and Reporting Centre, based at Kandahar airport, included an embedded ground defence element which provided specialist force protection advice. This deployment formed part of Operation Slipper, the ADF contribution to the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). ADGs continue to be deployed to the Middle East Area of Operations (MEAO) in small numbers to provide specialist support to operations.

====Other operations====
In addition to the major campaigns listed above, in recent years ADGs have been involved in a range of smaller scale operations. These have included Operation Gold, the provision of ADF support to the Sydney Olympic Games in 2000; Operation Deluge, the provision of security to the 2007 Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation Forum meetings in Sydney; and Operation Ramp, the evacuation of Australian and foreign nationals from Lebanon in 2006 during the conflict between Israeli forces and Hezbollah.

2AFDS was presented with a squadron standard by the Governor-General of Australia, Her Excellency Dame Quentin Bryce, at RAAF Base Amberley on 19 May 2011

Members are enlisted as ADGs in the Permanent Air Force for an initial period of service of four years; those joining the Ground Defence Reserve Group are employed on full-time service for 11 months, followed by 4 years part-time service. Once a candidate has successfully completed RAAF recruit training they attend the 15-week ADG Basic course at the RAAF Security and Fire School (RAAFSFS) RAAF Amberley, Queensland. Upon completion of trade training ADGs may wear the blue-grey beret which identifies them as a ground defence specialist.

Airmen graduate from ADG Basic course with the rank of Aircraftman (AC) and are posted to one of the 3 Security Forces Squadrons. Following a further 12 months service and favourable reporting, ADGs are reclassified to the rank of Leading Aircraftman (LAC). Post-graduate training may be undertaken to qualify in communications, field engineering/assault pioneer, direct fire support weapons, close personal protection and sniping; the majority of these courses being undertaken at Army training establishments. 

Further promotion is based upon minimum periods in rank, successful completion of appropriate trade and promotion courses, performance reporting and availability of positions. All ADGs must qualify as weapon instructors prior to promotion to NCO rank. Out of mustering postings may be available, with ADGs having served within Australia&#x27;s Federation Guard, as career advisers within a Defence Recruiting Centre and as Military Skills Instructors (MSIs) at No. 1 Recruit Training Unit (1RTU), RAAF Base Wagga Wagga and Officer Training School (OTS), RAAF Base East Sale.

==Current structure==
Formerly, graduates from the RAAF Security &amp; Fire School were placed into either 1AFDS or 2AFDS. However, in late 2013, with the future procurement of new aircraft, such as the F-35 Lightning II, both Airfield Defence Squadrons were merged with the RAAF Security Police, Airbase Protection and RAAF Military Working Dog Handlers to form Numbers 1 &amp; 2 Security Forces Squadrons (SECFOR), boosting the strength and capability of protecting the new assets. Along with these changes, 1SECFOR was relocated to RAAF Base Williamtown, and 3AFDS was re-activated as 3SECFOR, and based at RAAF Base Edinburgh. The ADG mustering may be broadly divided into those positions contained within a Security Forces Squadron and those within other units. Within Combat Support Group, No. 95 Wing commands the two Security Forces Squadrons.

*No. 1 Security Forces Squadron (1SECFOR)—RAAF Williamtown
*No. 2 Security Forces Squadron (2SECFOR)— RAAF Base Amberley

Former
* No. 3 Security Forces Squadron (3 SECFOR)—RAAF Base Edinburgh – Disbanded in October 2022.

Security Forces Squadrons comprise Rifle Flights (manned by Airfield Defence Guards and Ground Defence Officers), based with the Squadron Headquarters, and Security Flights/Detachments (generally manned by Air Force Security personnel and Security Police Officers) at the bases within the unit&#x27;s area of responsibility. All Flights/Detachments contribute to the security of air and space power within Australia and overseas. Rifle Flights are capable of security tasks in low to high threat environments, while Security Flights/Detachments normally conduct security tasks in low threat environments. Generally, Security Forces Squadrons conduct the wide range of security tasks using an integrated workforce approach. Airfield Defence Guards, Ground Defence Officers, Air Force Security personnel and Security Police Officers often work in mixed teams, tailored to the task, threat and environment.

Permanent Air Force NCOs may be posted to a Ground Defence Training Section (GDTS) at any major RAAF base in Australia or to certain training units within Air Force Training Group. GDTS staff undertake both a training role and provide specialist advice to unit commanders. Reserve NCOs may be posted to a SECFOR Squadron, or to an instructional post or Reserve Airbase Protection Flight within one of the RAAF&#x27;s &#x27;City&#x27; Squadrons (Nos. 13, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 &amp; 31 SQNs). ADG Warrant Officers (WOFFs) may be posted to staff or policy positions within a higher headquarters.

==Duties and mission roles==

ADGs form the basis of the Air Force&#x27;s ground combat force, protecting Base assets, infrastructure and personnel against attack by enemy ground forces. For planning purposes, a nominal Area of Operations (AO) for RAAF ground defence is usually extends to five kilometres from the airfield perimeter fence. In practice, the AO assigned to ADGs is determined by variables such as available forces, terrain, vegetation etc. ADGs are trained and equipped to locate, fix and destroy enemy ground forces, ideally during the reconnaissance phase of any intended attack on RAAF assets. 

This is achieved by the deployment of multiple patrol teams, usually consisting of 4–5 members, undertaking reconnaissance patrols, observation and listening posts. These teams are supported by specialist elements including snipers operating in a counter-sniper role. Once the enemy are located, forces are concentrated to engage and destroy their capability to complete their task. ADGs also provide a Base Commander with a Quick Reaction Force (QRF) mounted in wheeled vehicles. QRF teams are heavily armed and act as a mobile reserve to provide a counter-attack or counter-penetration capability should an enemy evade the patrol screen.

In addition to their operational role ADG instructors provide essential ground defence training to the remainder of the RAAF. This includes instruction in weapon handling, ground defence and security tactics and Chemical, Biological, Radiologican and Nuclear (CBRN) defence. Non-Commissioned Officers (NCOs) may be posted to instructional positions at 1RTU; OTS; the Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA), Canberra; Combat Survival Training School (CSTS, also known as COMSURV), RAAF Base Townsville; RAAF Security &amp; Fire School, RAAF Base Amberley or a Ground Defence Training Section (GDTS) at any RAAF Base in Australia.

===Tasks performed by ADGs===

* patrolling over extended periods over arduous terrain and in extreme climatic conditions carrying a specified load necessary to accomplish the mission;
* foot and vehicle patrolling by day and by night in and around both established and bare base airfields and through vegetated or urban environments in all extremities of weather conditions and locations within or outside of Australia;
* manning of Observation Posts (OPs), Listening Posts (LPs) and standing patrols to detect and interdict enemy movement
* Quick Reaction Force (QRF) duties in response to identified threats;
* Aircraft Security Operations providing protection to both aircraft and infrastructure;
* construction of field defences and obstacles such as weapon pits and bunkers, fences and vehicle check points (VCPs);
* search and clearance operations;
* manning of crew served weapons such as machine guns and anti-armour weapons;
* security for special events;
* instruction on small arms including pistols, rifles, shotguns and Light Support Weapons (LSWs);
* instruction in Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) defence; and
* instruction in individual and unit ground defence tactics and techniques.

==Equipment==

The weapons and equipment issued to ADGs are similar to standard Australian infantry equipment.

===Weapons===
* EF88 Enhanced F88 Rifle
*L9A1/L9A3 Self Loading Pistol (Browning Hi-Power)
* Heckler &amp; Koch MP5 sub-machine gun
* F88 Austeyr rifle (Steyr AUG)

<doc id="352039" wikidata="Q2044200" url="?curid=352039" title="PICT">
<text>PICT is a graphics file format introduced on the original Apple Macintosh computer as its standard metafile format. It allows the interchange of graphics (both bitmapped and vector), and some limited text support, between Mac applications, and was the native graphics format of QuickDraw.

The PICT file format consists essentially of a series of QuickDraw commands. The original version, PICT 1, was designed to be as compact as possible while describing vector graphics. To this end, it featured single byte opcodes, many of which embodied operations such as &quot;do the previous operation again&quot;. As such it was quite memory efficient, but not very expandable. With the introduction of the Macintosh II and Color QuickDraw, PICT was revised to version 2. This version featured 16-bit opcodes and numerous changes which enhanced its utility. PICT 1 opcodes were supported as a subset for backward compatibility.

Within a Mac application, any sequence of drawing operations could be simply recorded/encoded to the PICT format by opening a &quot;Picture&quot;, then closing it after issuing the required commands. By saving the resulting byte stream as a resource, a &quot;PICT resource&quot; resulted, which could be loaded and played back at any time. The same stream could be saved to a data file on disk (with 512 bytes of unused header space added) as a PICT file.

With the change to Mac OS X and discontinuation of QuickDraw, PICT was dropped in favor of Portable Document Format (PDF) as the native metafile format, though PICT support is retained by many applications as it was so widely supported on Classic Mac OS.

This &quot;PICT&quot; image format supports single channel and color channel RGB images and grayscale images.
Photoshop no longer has the ability to open PICT files which use QuickDraw object data (but can open simple raster-based PICTs), and cannot save files in PICT format.

== PICT versions ==
The PICT format has two versions:
*PICT 1 format: The old format that only allowed eight colors and focused on compact storage.
*PICT 2 format: A superset of format 1 that supports 4, 8, 16 and 24-bit color and greyscale images. 32-bit color with a generally unused alpha channel is also supported. Furthermore certain compressed PixMap types can be included using QuickTime.

== Compression method ==
With the QuickTime 2.0 multimedia framework, Apple added support for compression using JPEG or any other QuickTime compressor to bitmaps embedded in PICT data.

<doc id="352041" wikidata="Q1143044" url="?curid=352041" title="Battles of Kawanakajima">
<text>The  were a series of battles fought in the Sengoku period of Japan between Takeda Shingen of Kai Province and Uesugi Kenshin of Echigo Province from 1553 to 1564. 
Shingen and Kenshin contested each other for control of the plain of Kawanakajima between the Sai River and Chikuma River in northern Shinano Province, located in the present-day city of Nagano. The battles were triggered after Shingen conquered Shinano, expelling Ogasawara Nagatoki and Murakami Yoshikiyo, who subsequently turned to Kenshin for help. 

Five major battles of Kawanakajima occurred: Fuse in 1553, Saigawa in 1555, Uenohara in 1557, Hachimanbara in 1561, and Shiozaki in 1564. The most famous and severe battle was fought on 18 October 1561 in the heart of the Kawanakajima plain, thus being known the Battle of Kawanakajima. The battles were ultimately inconclusive and neither Shingen or Kenshin established their control over the plain of Kawanakajima.

The Battles of Kawanakajima became one of &quot;the most cherished tales in Japanese military history&quot;, the epitome of Japanese chivalry and romance, mentioned in epic literature, paintings, woodblock prints, and movies.

== Background ==
The battles were part of the 16th-century Sengoku period, also known as the &quot;Warring States Period&quot;, and were little different from other conflicts. After the Ōnin War (1467–77), the &quot;Muromachi shōgun&quot;″s system and taxation had increasingly less control outside the province of the capital in Kyoto, and powerful lords (&quot;daimyōs&quot;) began to assert themselves. Such lords gained power by usurpation, warfare or marriage—any means that would safeguard their position. It was manifested in &quot;yamajiro&quot; (&quot;mountain castles&quot;), which overlooked the provinces.

In 1541, Shingen began his conquest of Shinano Province. In 1550, Shingen advanced once again into Shinano and quickly conquered Hayashi Castle, Kiribara and Fukashi Castle by siege. These had been controlled by Ogasawara Nagatoki, who fled to Murakami Yoshikiyo. In October 1550, Shingen began the Sieges of Toishi Castle, from which position he intended to carry out the final attack on the main Murakami castle of Katsurao. However, in November the siege was abandoned and Shingen&#x27;s army was counterattacked by Murakami, and almost routed. The following year, though, Murakami was forced to leave the castle and the successful Siege of Katsurao (1553) ensued.

==First battle ==
The first battle of Kawanakajima, also known as the &quot;Battle of Fuse&quot;, was fought in 1553. Although regarded as the first battle, it is related to the two battles of Hachiman fought in the same year south of the plain.

Twelve days after taking Katsurao Castle, Shingen penetrated far into the Kawanakajima plain along the eastern bank of the Chikumagawa River. Uesugi Kenshin marched up the western bank to support Murakami Yoshikiyo, and the two armies encountered each other at a shrine of Hachiman (place within modern Yashiro) on June 3, 1553. After Takeda withdrew, Uesugi continued his march and laid siege to Katsura, but was unable to capture it.

In September, Takeda returned to crush the remaining Murakami forces around Shioda. Wada was taken on September 8 and Takashima on the 10th. In both cases the entire garrison was put to death as a warning to other Murakami holdouts. Murakami Yoshikiyo retreated from Shioda on 12 September 1553 and about 16 of the clan&#x27;s outposts in Shinano surrendered to Takeda. Shingen pursued Yoshikyo across the Chikumagawa River but was turned back by Kenshin&#x27;s reinforcements at the Battle of Fuse. Kenshin pursued Shingen, winning another battle at Hachiman. The victorious Uesugi forces went on to take Arato castle before winter forced both sides to disengage.

==Second battle ==

From August to November 1555 the second battle of Kawanakajima, also known as the &quot;Battle of Saigawa&quot;, began when Takeda Shingen returned to Kawanakajima, advancing up to the Sai River. He made camp on a hill to the south of the river, while Uesugi Kenshin was camped just east of the Zenkō-ji temple, which provided him an excellent view of the plain. However, the Kurita clan, allies of the Takeda, held Asahiyama fortress a few kilometers to the west; they menaced the Uesugi right flank. Kurita Kakuju&#x27;s defenses were bolstered by 3,000 Takeda warriors, of whom 800 were archers and 300 arquebusiers.

The main battle was almost shadowed by the number of Kenshin&#x27;s attacks (siege) against the Asahiyama fortress, but all were repulsed. Eventually he moved his army onto the plain, redirecting his attention to Takeda&#x27;s main force. However, rather than attacking, both armies waited, for months, for the other to make a move. Finally, battle was avoided as both leaders retired to deal with domestic affairs in their home provinces. The peace was mediated by Imagawa Yoshimoto.

==Third battle==
The third battle, also known as the &quot;Battle of Uenohara&quot;, took place in 1557 when Takeda Shingen captured a fortress called Katsurayama, overlooking the Zenkō-ji temple from the northwest. He then attempted to take Iiyama castle, but withdrew after Uesugi Kenshin led an army out of Zenkō-ji. Of the four, this battle took place furthest from the Kawanakajima plain.

==Fourth battle ==
The fourth battle of Kawanakajima resulted in greater casualties for both sides, as a percentage of total forces, than any other battle in the Sengoku period and is, according to Turnbull, one of the most tactically interesting battles of the period.

After besieging Hōjō Ujiyasu&#x27;s Odawara castle, Uesugi Kenshin was forced to withdraw after hearing rumors about the movement of Takeda Shingen&#x27;s army. In September 1561 Kenshin left his Kasugayama Castle with 13,000 warriors, determined to destroy Shingen. He left some of his forces at Zenkō-ji but took up a position on Saijoyama, a mountain to the west of, and looking down upon, Shingen&#x27;s Kaizu castle. To Kenshin&#x27;s ignorance, the Kaizu castle contained no more than 150 samurai and their followers and he had taken them completely by surprise. However, the general in command of the castle, Kosaka Masanobu, through a system of signal fires, informed his lord, in Tsutsujigasaki fortress, 130 km away in Kōfu, of Kenshin&#x27;s move.
Shingen left Kōfu with 16,000 men, acquiring 4,000 more as he traveled through Shinano Province, approaching Kawanakajima on the west bank of the Chikumagawa (Chikuma River), keeping the river between him and Saijoyama. &quot;Neither army made a move&quot;, knowing that victory would require the essential element of surprise. Shingen was thus allowed into his fortress at Kaizu along with his &quot;gun-bugyō&quot; (army commissioner), Yamamoto Kansuke. At that time Kansuke formed a strategy that he believed would prove effective against Kenshin.

Kōsaka Masanobu left Kaizu with 8,000 men, advancing up Saijoyama under cover of night, intending to drive Kenshin&#x27;s army down to the plain where Takeda Shingen would be waiting with another 8,000 men in &quot;kakuyoku&quot; (&quot;crane&#x27;s wing&quot;), formation. However, whether via spies in Kaizu or scouts looking down from Saijoyama, Kenshin guessed Shingen&#x27;s intentions and led his own men down to the plain. Kenshin descended from Saijoyama by its western flanks. Instead of fleeing Kosaka&#x27;s dawn attack, Uesugi Kenshin&#x27;s army crept down the mountain, quietly using bits of cloth to deaden the noise of their horses&#x27; hooves. With the beginning of dawn, Shingen&#x27;s men were surprised to find Kenshin&#x27;s army ready to charge at them—as opposed to fleeing from the mountain, as expected.

Uesugi&#x27;s forces attacked in waves, in a &quot;kuruma gakari&quot; formation, in which every unit is replaced by another as it becomes weary or destroyed. Leading the Uesugi vanguard were two of Uesugi&#x27;s &quot;Twenty-Eight Generals&quot;, Kakizaki Kageie and Irobe Katsunaga. Kakizaki&#x27;s unit of mounted samurai clashed with Takeda Nobushige&#x27;s unit, resulting in the death of Nobushige, younger brother of Shigen. While the &quot;kakuyoku&quot; formation held surprisingly well, the Takeda commanders eventually fell, one by one. Seeing that his pincer plan had failed, Yamamoto Kansuke charged into the enemy ranks, being killed in action with his two chief retainers, Osaragi Shōzaemon and Isahaya Sagorō.
Eventually the Uesugi forces reached the Takeda command post, and one of the most famous single combats in Japanese history ensued. Uesugi Kenshin himself burst into the headquarters, attacking Takeda Shingen who, unprepared for such an event, parried with his signalling fan as best as he could, and held Kenshin off long enough for one of his retainers, Hara Osumi-no-Kami, to spear Kenshin&#x27;s mount and drive him off.

The Takeda main body held firm, despite fierce rotating attacks by the Uesugi. Obu Saburohei fought back against Kakizaki&#x27;s samurai. Anayama Nobutada destroyed Shibata Harunaga of Echigo, and forced the Uesugi main force back to the Chikumigawa.

Meanwhile, Kosaka&#x27;s stealth force reached the top of Saijoyama and, finding the Uesugi position deserted, hurried down the mountain to the fort, taking the same path they had expected the fleeing Uesugi to take. After desperate fighting, they punched their way through the 3000 Uesugi warriors defending the ford (under the command of Uesugi general Amakasu Kagemochi), and pressed on to aid Takeda&#x27;s main force. The Kosaka force then attacked the retreating Uesugi from the rear. Takeda Shingen&#x27;s many great generals, including his younger brother Takeda Nobushige and Murozumi Masakiyo, were killed in the field.

=== Result ===
In the end, it is told that the Uesugi army suffered 62% casualties, while the Takeda lost 72%. The chronicles seem to indicate that the Takeda made no effort to stop the Uesugi from retreating after the battle, burning the encampment at Saijoyama, returning to Zenkō-ji and then to Echigo Province. Some more conservative estimates place the casualties around 20%.

==Fifth battle ==
In September 1564, also known as the &quot;Battle of Shiozaki&quot;. Shingen and Kenshin met for the fifth time on the plain of Kawanakajima. Their forces skirmished for 60 days, and then both withdrew.

Another encounter near Lake Nojiri in 1568 could be labeled as the sixth battle, but it is not considered as such.

==In popular culture==

*The Battles of Kawanakajima were a popular subject for woodblock prints in the Edo period, in part because both the Takeda and Uesugi clans had died out and glorification of their deeds did not therefore pose any threat to the ruling Tokugawa shogunate. 
*A shogi variant based on xiangqi, Kawanakajima shogi (ja), is named after the battles.
*The 1561 Fourth Battle of Kawanakajima is depicted at the climax of the 1969 Japanese film &quot;Fūrin Kazan&quot; (&#x27;Samurai Banners&#x27;), which follows the career of Yamamoto Kansuke.
*A fictionalized version of the battle is featured in the 1979 movie &quot;Sengoku Jieitai&quot;.

<text>Patrick James Riley (born March 20, 1945) is an American professional basketball executive, former coach, and former player in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He has been the team president of the Miami Heat since 1995, and he also served as the team&#x27;s head coach from 1995 to 2003 and again from 2005 to 2008. Often referred to as &quot;the Godfather&quot;, Riley is regarded as one of the greatest NBA figures of all time both as a coach and executive. He has won five NBA championships as a head coach, four with the Los Angeles Lakers during their Showtime era in the 1980s and one with the Heat in 2006. Riley is a nine-time NBA champion across his tenures as a player (1972), assistant coach (1980), head coach (1982, 1985, 1987, 1988, 2006), and executive (2012, 2013). Since the start of his NBA career through 2023, Riley appeared in 25 percent of all NBA Finals as a player, coach, or executive.

Riley was named NBA Coach of the Year three times (1989–90, 1992–93 and 1996–97, as head coach of the Lakers, New York Knicks and Heat, respectively). He was head coach of an NBA All-Star Game team nine times: eight times with the Western Conference team (1982, 1983, 1985–1990, all as head coach of the Lakers) and once with the Eastern team (1993, as head coach of the Knicks). He is the first North American sports figure to win a championship as a player, as an assistant coach, as a head coach, and as an executive, and in various roles has reached the NBA finals in seven different decades. In 1996, he was named one of the 10 Greatest Coaches in NBA history. In 2008, Riley was inducted in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a coach. Riley most recently won the 2012 and 2013 NBA championships with the Heat as their team president. He received the Chuck Daly Lifetime Achievement Award from the NBA Coaches Association on June 20, 2012.

Riley played basketball for Linton High School in Schenectady under head coach Walt Przybylo and assistants Bill Rapavy and Ed Catino. Linton High School&#x27;s 74–68 victory over New York City&#x27;s Power Memorial on December 29, 1961, is remembered mostly for its two stars: Power Memorial&#x27;s Lew Alcindor (who later changed his name to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) and Riley, who would go on to coach Abdul-Jabbar with the Los Angeles Lakers. In 1991, Riley called it &quot;one of the greatest games in the history of Schenectady basketball.&quot;

==College career==
Riley played college basketball for four seasons for the Kentucky Wildcats—one on the freshman team and three on the varsity. As a junior on the 1965–66 Kentucky Wildcats men&#x27;s basketball team, he was named First Team All-SEC, All-NCAA Tournament Team, NCAA Regional Player of the Year, SEC Player of the Year and AP Third Team All-American, leading the Wildcats to the 1966 NCAA title game. Coached by Adolph Rupp, UK lost to Texas Western (today&#x27;s UTEP), a game that was reenacted in the movie &quot;Glory Road&quot;. In his senior year, Riley made First Team All-SEC, becoming one of the few players in storied Kentucky basketball history to be named First Team All-SEC twice.

==Professional career==
===San Diego Rockets (1967–1970)===
Riley was selected by the San Diego Rockets as the seventh overall pick of the 1967 NBA draft. Despite the fact that he had not played college football, Riley was also drafted as a wide receiver by the Dallas Cowboys in the 11th round of the 1967 NFL/AFL draft. After playing three seasons with the Rockets, he was selected by the Portland Trail Blazers in the 1970 NBA expansion draft.

===Los Angeles Lakers (1970–1975)===

The Blazers traded Riley to the Los Angeles Lakers, where he played for five seasons. Riley played a significant role as a reserve on the Lakers&#x27; 1972 NBA Championship team.

===Phoenix Suns (1975–1976)===
During the 1975–76 NBA season, Riley was traded to the Phoenix Suns. He retired in 1976, having averaged 7.4 points per game over his nine seasons in the league.

==Coaching and executive career (1979–present)==

===Los Angeles Lakers (1979–1990)===
Riley returned to the NBA in 1977 as a broadcaster for the Lakers. In November 1979, after the team&#x27;s head coach, Jack McKinney, was injured in a near-fatal bicycle accident, assistant coach Paul Westhead took over the team&#x27;s head coaching duties and hired Riley as an assistant coach. With rookie guard Magic Johnson and longtime star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the Lakers defeated the Philadelphia 76ers in six games in the 1980 NBA Finals, giving Westhead and Riley championship rings in their first year coaching the team. However, the team lost in the playoffs the next year to the Moses Malone-led Houston Rockets.

Six games into the 1981–82 season, Magic Johnson said he wished to be traded because he was unhappy playing for Westhead. Shortly afterwards, Lakers&#x27; owner Jerry Buss fired Westhead. At an ensuing press conference, with Jerry West at his side, Buss named West head coach. West, however, balked, and Buss awkwardly tried to name West as &quot;offensive captain&quot; and then named West and Riley as co-coaches. West made it clear during the press conference that he would only assist Riley, and that Riley was the head coach. Thereafter, Riley was the interim head coach, until his status became permanent.

Riley ushered in the Lakers&#x27; &quot;Showtime&quot; era, along with superstar players Johnson and Abdul-Jabbar with their running game. Riley became a celebrity in his own right, a fashion icon for his Armani suits and slicked-back hair which complemented the team&#x27;s Hollywood image.

Besides using Lakers&#x27; up-tempo style established by McKinney and Westhead, Riley was also innovative on defense; he was one of the first coaches to employ a 1-3-1 half-court trap to pick up the pace of the game. Though the Showtime Lakers were known for their offense, they won championships with their defense. In Michael Cooper, they had one of the top defensive guards in the game. The league-wide perception was that the Lakers played with finesse and were not physical enough to win in the playoffs. Riley&#x27;s mantra was &quot;no rebounds, no rings&quot;, reinforcing the need to fight for rebounds in order to win championships.

Riley led the Lakers to four consecutive NBA Finals appearances. His first title came in his first season, against the Philadelphia 76ers. Both teams returned to the Finals the next year, and this time Riley&#x27;s Lakers, hobbled by injuries to Norm Nixon, Bob McAdoo and rookie James Worthy, were swept by the 76ers. The Lakers lost in the Finals again in 1984, to the Boston Celtics in seven games. The Lakers earned Riley his second NBA title in 1985 in a rematch of the previous year, as the Lakers beat the Celtics in six games. The Lakers&#x27; four-year Western Conference streak was broken the following year by the Houston Rockets.

In 1987, Riley coached a Lakers team that is considered one of the best teams of all time. With future Hall of Famers Magic Johnson, James Worthy and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, plus Byron Scott, A.C. Green, Mychal Thompson, Kurt Rambis, and Cooper, the Lakers finished 65–17 in the regular season, third-best in team history. They met with similar success in the playoffs, dispatching the Celtics in six games to win Riley his third NBA title.

One of Riley&#x27;s most famous moments came when he guaranteed the crowd a repeat championship during the Lakers&#x27; championship parade in downtown Los Angeles (he first made the guarantee during the post-victory locker room celebration). While the 1988 Lakers did not produce as many wins in the regular season as the 1987 Lakers, they still won the NBA title, becoming the first team in 19 years to repeat as champions. The Lakers beat the Detroit Pistons in seven games in the 1988 NBA Finals, making good on Riley&#x27;s promise. Riley&#x27;s titles with the Lakers make him one of six men to play for an NBA Championship team and later coach the same NBA team to a championship; the others are George Senesky, Bill Russell, Tom Heinsohn, K. C. Jones and Billy Cunningham.
Although Riley would offer no further guarantees, his Lakers embarked upon a quest to obtain a third consecutive championship in 1989. Having successfully claimed a repeat championship the year before, the term used for this new goal was a &quot;three-peat&quot; championship, and Riley, through his corporate entity, Riles &amp; Co., trademarked the phrase &quot;three-peat&quot;. The Lakers won 57 games to lead the Western Conference, and swept the Western Conference bracket of the 1989 NBA playoffs (11–0). 

In the days leading up to the 1989 NBA Finals, Riley took his team to a mini-training camp in Santa Barbara, California in hopes of keeping his players in peak physical form. However, his demanding, intense approach to practice took its toll on his players, and in one of the practices leading up to Game 1, Byron Scott injured his hamstring that kept him out for the series. Then during Game 2, Magic Johnson also pulled his hamstring, and though he tried to play in Game 3, the injury proved too severe for him to continue. Without Scott and later Johnson, the Lakers were swept by the Pistons in a Finals rematch.

Riley was named NBA Coach of the Year for the first time in 1989–90, but stepped down as Lakers head coach after they lost to the Phoenix Suns in the playoffs. At the time of his departure, Riley was the foremost coach in the NBA with a level of fame not seen since Red Auerbach.

===New York Knicks (1991–1995)===
After stepping down, Riley accepted a job as a television commentator for NBC for one year before being named head coach of the New York Knicks, starting with the 1991–92 season.

Commentators admired Riley&#x27;s ability to work with the physical, deliberate Knicks, adapting his &quot;Showtime&quot; style with the fast-paced Laker teams in the 1980s. The Chicago Bulls had easily swept the Knicks in 1991 en route to their first championship. However, in 1992, with Riley, the Knicks pushed the defending champion Bulls to seven games in the Eastern Conference semifinals. The physical defense of the Knicks against the Chicago Bulls&#x27; superstars Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen during the 1992 playoffs led to a feud between Riley and Bulls head coach Phil Jackson regarding the officiating and the Knicks&#x27; rough style of play. In 1993, Riley led the Knicks to their best regular season record in team history (tied with the 1969–1970 team) and received his second Coach of the Year award. The Knicks again met the Bulls in the Eastern Conference finals but lost in six games after winning the first two games at home. Jackson&#x27;s Bulls that season went on to win the finals and accomplish a &quot;three-peat,&quot; despite Riley&#x27;s trademark in 1989.

Riley returned to the NBA Finals, in 1994, en route to defeating the three-time defending champion Bulls (without Michael Jordan) in seven games during the Eastern Conference semifinals. However, New York lost in seven games to the Houston Rockets after being up 3–2 in the series. During the 1994 Finals, Riley became the first coach to participate in an NBA Finals Game 7 with two teams, having been with the Lakers in 1984 and 1988. However, he had the unfortunate distinction of becoming the first (and to date, only) coach to lose an NBA Finals Game 7 with two teams, having lost to the Celtics, in 1984. It also denied him the distinction of becoming the first coach to win a Game 7 in the Finals with two teams, having defeated the Pistons in seven games, in 1988.

===Miami Heat===
====Head coach and president (1995–2008)====
In 1995, Riley resigned from the Knicks via fax to become president and head coach of the Miami Heat, with complete control over basketball operations. The move caused some controversy, as the Heat were accused by the Knicks of tampering by pursuing Riley while he still had a year remaining on his contract with the Knicks. The matter was settled after the Heat sent their 1996 first-round pick (which the Knicks used to draft Walter McCarty) and $1 million in cash to the Knicks on September 1, 1995.

In the 1995–96 NBA season, Riley led the Heat to a 42–40 record, which was a 10-game improvement over the team&#x27;s previous season. Miami was swept in the first round of the playoffs by the Phil Jackson-coached Chicago Bulls, who went on to win the NBA championship. This Heat season was notable for personnel changes, as the team welcomed franchise building blocks Alonzo Mourning and Tim Hardaway. Following the season, the Heat also obtained Nets forward P.J. Brown and Suns swingman Dan Majerle.

In 1997, Riley&#x27;s Heat defeated his old team, the Knicks, in a physical seven-game series. Advancing to the Eastern Conference finals for the first time in franchise history, the Heat were again defeated by the eventual champion Bulls. Riley was selected as Coach of the Year for the third time after leading Miami to a 61–21 regular season record and first place in the Atlantic Division.

The Heat lost to the archrival Knicks in 1998, 1999, and 2000 in the playoffs. Riley then traded Brown and Jamal Mashburn in exchange for Eddie Jones in one trade and acquired Brian Grant in another, although the team suffered a major setback after Alonzo Mourning was lost for the season due to a kidney ailment. After finishing 50–32 in the 2000–01 season, the Heat were swept by the Charlotte Hornets in the first round of the NBA playoffs. The Heat then lost two of their best players when guard Tim Hardaway was traded to the Dallas Mavericks and Anthony Mason signed with the Milwaukee Bucks. In part because of these departures, the Heat crumbled to a 36–46 in 2002–the first time that a Riley-coached team had not had a winning season or made the playoffs.

After the Heat finished the 2002–03 season 25–57, Riley stepped down as head coach and was succeeded by longtime assistant Stan Van Gundy. In the 2003 NBA draft, the Heat held the fifth overall pick, which they used to select Dwyane Wade. In July 2004, Riley traded Caron Butler, Brian Grant, Lamar Odom, and a first-round draft pick to the Lakers for star center Shaquille O&#x27;Neal. Wade and O&#x27;Neal led the Heat to the Eastern Conference finals during the 2005 playoffs, where they lost to the defending champions Detroit Pistons after leading the series 3–2.
During the 2005 off-season, it was widely speculated that Riley was attempting to push Van Gundy out and make himself head coach once again now that the team was a championship contender. Van Gundy resigned from his position just 21 games into the 2005–06 season, citing a need to spend more time with his family, and Riley named himself as Van Gundy&#x27;s successor. Riley&#x27;s Heat team defeated the Detroit Pistons in the 2006 Eastern Conference finals on June 2, 2006, the first time Miami reached the finals. Riley&#x27;s Heat squared off against the Dallas Mavericks in the 2006 NBA Finals. Despite losing the first two games, the Heat rallied to win the next four and their first NBA championship. After Game 6, Riley commented that he had packed one suit, one shirt, and one tie for the trip to Dallas. It was Riley&#x27;s fifth championship as a head coach and his first with a team other than the Lakers.

Citing hip and knee problems, Riley took a leave of absence from coaching from January 3, 2007, through February 19, 2007. Assistant coach Ron Rothstein assumed interim duties. The Heat finished the season 44–38 and were swept in the first round of the playoffs by the Chicago Bulls, the first defending champions swept in the first round since the Philadelphia Warriors in 1957. The following season, the Heat finished 15–67. The team had lost several of its players to extended injuries, and a disgruntled Shaquille O&#x27;Neal was traded mid-season. Two years after winning the championship, they finished with one of the worst seasons in NBA history. It also tied the Heat&#x27;s inaugural season of 1988–89 as the worst in franchise history, and was easily the worst full-season record compiled by a Riley-coached team.

====Full-time team president (2008–present)====
On April 28, 2008, Riley announced that he would step down as head coach while remaining team president. He named assistant Erik Spoelstra as head coach. Although the Heat have nominally had a general manager for most of Riley&#x27;s tenure as team president (Randy Pfund until 2008, and Andy Elisburg since 2013), Riley has had the final say in basketball matters since his arrival in Miami.

In 2010, Riley acquired LeBron James and Chris Bosh to form the Heat&#x27;s &quot;Big Three&quot; with Dwyane Wade. Riley was named NBA Executive of the Year for the 2010–11 season. The Heat reached the NBA Finals each of the next four seasons (2011 through 2014). In 2012, the Heat beat the Oklahoma City Thunder to give Riley his first championship purely as an executive. The Heat repeated as champions in 2013, defeating the San Antonio Spurs.

In the 2019–20 season, the Heat became the fourth team in NBA history to finish lower than fourth place in their conference in the regular season and make it to the NBA Finals. The 2019–20 Heat team has been considered by some to be Riley&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot;, since the team&#x27;s Finals run was not preceded by a dramatic rebuild or by the selection of a high draft pick. Before the season, Riley traded for Jimmy Butler, drafted Tyler Herro, and signed the undrafted Kendrick Nunn. Before the 2019–20 trade deadline, the Heat obtained Andre Iguodala and Jae Crowder. Facing Riley&#x27;s former team, the Los Angeles Lakers (led by former Heat superstar LeBron James), the Heat were defeated in six games. In 2023, the Heat had a similarly unprecedented run to the finals as an 8th-seeded team, becoming the second 8th seed to reach the finals. Ironically, the first were the Knicks, who defeated Riley&#x27;s 1st-seeded Heat in the 1999 playoffs. However, the Heat lost to the Denver Nuggets in five games.

Prior to the 2024–25 season, the Heat honored Riley by dedicating the Kaseya Center floor as the &quot;Pat Riley Court at Kaseya Center&quot;.

==Outside basketball==

Outside basketball, Riley has developed into a pop culture figure. This is born out of Riley&#x27;s signature look, a slicked-back hairstyle, which is often described as gangster- or mafioso-like, and his immaculate tan. Riley&#x27;s nickname is &quot;The Godfather&quot; because of his appearance.

In 1988, Riley published a book entitled &quot;Showtime: Inside the Lakers&#x27; Breakthrough Season&quot;, a &quot;New York Times&quot; best-seller which recapped the Lakers&#x27; successful run to the 1987 NBA Championship. One of the phrases Riley coined in the book was the &quot;Disease of More&quot;, stating that &quot;success is often the first step toward disaster&quot; and that defending champions often fail the following season because every player who returns wants more playing time, more shots per game, and more money. The phrase stemmed from the Lakers&#x27; disappointing 1980–81 campaign coming off a championship the previous season.

In 1993, while coaching the New York Knicks, Riley published a second &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller entitled &quot;The Winner Within: A Life Plan for Team Players&quot;. Aimed at business leadership as well as basketball enthusiasts, it distilled a lesson in teamwork and leadership from each of Riley&#x27;s seasons as a coach to that date. Byron Laursen co-authored both of Riley&#x27;s books.

Riley is known for his friendship with Giorgio Armani, preferring to wear Armani suits during basketball games and modeling once at an Armani show.

Riley has been married to the former Christine Rodstrom since June 26, 1970. In 1985, the Rileys adopted a son, James Patrick. In 1989, they adopted a daughter, Elisabeth. Riley is a practicing Roman Catholic.

On February 27, 2007, the Miami Heat were honored for their 2005–2006 NBA Championship at the White House. During the ceremony, Riley presented George W. Bush with a jersey before announcing, &quot;I voted for the man. If you don&#x27;t vote, you don&#x27;t count.&quot; After the ceremony, Riley was questioned by reporters about the political nature of his comments. He responded by saying, &quot;I&#x27;m pro-American, pro-democracy, I&#x27;m pro-government. I follow my boss. He&#x27;s my boss.&quot;

<text>Laryngoscopy () is endoscopy of the larynx, a part of the throat. It is a medical procedure that is used to obtain a view, for example, of the vocal folds and the glottis. Laryngoscopy may be performed to facilitate tracheal intubation during general anaesthesia or cardiopulmonary resuscitation or for surgical procedures on the larynx or other parts of the upper tracheobronchial tree.

==Direct laryngoscopy==

Direct laryngoscopy is carried out (usually) with the patient lying on their back; the laryngoscope is inserted into the mouth on the right side and flipped to the left to trap and move the tongue out of the line of sight, and, depending on the type of blade used, inserted either anterior or posterior to the epiglottis and then lifted with an upwards and forward motion (&quot;away from you and towards the roof &quot;). This move makes a view of the glottis possible.
This procedure is done in an operation theatre with full preparation for resuscitative measures to deal with respiratory distress.
There are at least ten different types of laryngoscope used for this procedure, each of which has a specialized use for the otolaryngologist and medical speech pathologist. This procedure is most often employed by anaesthetists for endotracheal intubation under general anaesthesia, but also in direct diagnostic laryngoscopy with biopsy. It is extremely uncomfortable and is not typically performed on conscious patients, or on patients with an intact gag reflex.

==Indirect laryngoscopy==
Indirect laryngoscopy is performed whenever the provider visualizes the patient&#x27;s vocal cords by a means other than obtaining a direct line of sight (e.g. a mirror). For the purpose of intubation, this is facilitated by fiberoptic bronchoscopes, video laryngoscopes, fiberoptic stylets and mirror or prism optically enhanced laryngoscopes.

==History==


Some historians (for example, Morell Mackenzie) credit Benjamin Guy Babington (1794–1866), who called his device the &quot;glottiscope&quot;, with the invention of the laryngoscope. Philipp von Bozzini (1773–1809) and Garignard de la Tour were other early physicians to use mouth mirrors to inspect the oropharynx and hypopharynx.

In 1854, the vocal pedagogist Manuel García (1805–1906) became the first man to view the functioning glottis and larynx in a living human. García developed a tool that used two mirrors for which the Sun served as an external light source. Using this device, he was able to observe the function of his own glottic apparatus and the uppermost portion of his trachea. He presented his findings at the Royal Society of London in 1855.

All previous observations of the glottis and larynx had been performed under indirect vision (using mirrors) until 23 April 1895, when Alfred Kirstein (1863–1922) of Germany first described direct visualization of the vocal cords. Kirstein performed the first direct laryngoscopy in Berlin, using an esophagoscope he had modified for this purpose; he called this device an &quot;autoscope&quot;. It is believed that the death in 1888 of Emperor Frederick III motivated Kirstein to develop the autoscope.

In 1913, Chevalier Jackson was the first to report a high rate of success for the use of direct laryngoscopy as a means to intubate the trachea. Jackson introduced a new laryngoscope blade that had a light source at the distal tip, rather than the proximal light source used by Kirstein. This new blade incorporated a component that the operator could slide out to allow room for passage of an endoracheal tube or bronchoscope.

That same year, Henry Harrington Janeway (1873–1921) published results he had achieved using another new laryngoscope he had recently developed. An American anesthesiologist practicing at Bellevue Hospital in New York City, Janeway believed that direct intratracheal insufflation of volatile anesthetics would provide improved conditions for surgery of the nose, mouth and throat. With this in mind, he developed a laryngoscope designed for the sole purpose of tracheal intubation. Similar to Jackson&#x27;s device, Janeway&#x27;s instrument incorporated a distal light source. Unique however was the inclusion of batteries within the handle, a central notch in the blade for maintaining the tracheal tube in the midline of the oropharynx during intubation, and a slight curve to the distal tip of the blade to help guide the tube through the glottis. The success of this design led to its subsequent use in other types of surgery. Janeway was thus instrumental in popularizing the widespread use of direct laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation in the practice of anesthesiology.

==Applications==
* Helps in intubation during the administration of general anaesthesia or for mechanical ventilation.
* Detects causes of voice problems, such as breathing voice, hoarse voice, weak voice, or no voice.
* Detects causes of throat and ear pain.
* Evaluates difficulty in swallowing : a persistent sensation of lump in the throat, or mucus with blood.
* Detects strictures or injury to the throat, or obstructive masses in the airway.

==Conventional laryngoscope==
The vast majority of tracheal intubations involve the use of a viewing instrument of one type or another. Since its introduction by Kirstein in 1895, the conventional laryngoscope has been the most popular device used for this purpose. Today, the conventional laryngoscope consists of a handle containing batteries with a light source, and a set of interchangeable blades.

===Laryngoscope blades===
Early laryngoscopes used a straight &quot;Magill Blade&quot;, and this design is still the standard pattern veterinary laryngoscopes are based upon; however the blade is difficult to control in adult humans and can cause pressure on the vagus nerve, which can cause unexpected cardiac arrhythmias to spontaneously occur in adults.

Two basic styles of laryngoscope blade are currently commercially available: the curved blade and the straight blade. The Macintosh blade is the most widely used of the curved laryngoscope blades, while the Miller blade is the most popular style of straight blade. Both Miller and Macintosh laryngoscope blades are available in sizes 0 (neonatal) through 4 (large adult). There are many other styles of curved and straight blades (e.g., Phillips, Robertshaw, Sykes, Wisconsin, Wis-Hipple, etc.) with accessories such as mirrors for enlarging the field of view and even ports for the administration of oxygen. These specialty blades are primarily designed for use by anesthetists, most commonly in the operating room. Additionally, paramedics are trained to use direct laryngoscopy to assist with intubation in the field.

The Macintosh blade is positioned in the vallecula, anterior to the epiglottis, lifting it out of the visual pathway, while the Miller blade is positioned posterior to the epiglottis, trapping it while exposing the glottis and vocal folds. Incorrect usage can cause trauma to the front incisors; the correct technique is to displace the chin upwards and forward at the same time, not to use the blade as a lever with the teeth serving as the fulcrum.

The Miller, Wisconsin, Wis-Hipple, and Robertshaw blades are commonly used for infants. It is easier to visualize the glottis using these blades than the Macintosh blade in infants, due to the larger size of the epiglottis relative to that of the glottis.

==Fiberoptic laryngoscopes==
Besides the conventional laryngoscopes, many other devices have been developed as alternatives to direct laryngoscopy. These include a number of indirect fiberoptic viewing laryngoscopes such as the flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope. The flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope or rhinoscope can be used for office-based diagnostics or for tracheal intubation. The patient can remain conscious during the procedure, so that the vocal folds can be observed during phonation. Surgical instruments passed through the scope can be used for performing procedures such as biopsies of suspicious masses. These instruments have become indispensable within the otolaryngology, pulmonology and anesthesia communities.

Other available fiberoptic devices include the Bullard scope, UpsherScope, and the WuScope. These devices are widely employed for tracheal intubation, especially in the setting of the difficult intubation (see below).

==Video laryngoscope==

The conventional direct laryngoscope uses a line of sight provided by a rigid viewing instrument with a light on the blade or intra-oral portion which requires a direct view of the target larynx; this view is clearly seen in 80-90% of attempts. The frequent failure of direct laryngoscopy to provide an adequate view for tracheal intubation led to the development of alternative devices such as the lighted stylet, and a number of indirect fiberoptic viewing laryngoscopes, such as the fiberscope, Bullard scope, Upsher scope, and the WuScope. Though these devices can be effective alternatives to direct laryngoscopy, they each have certain limitations, and none of them is effective under all circumstances. One important limitation commonly associated with these devices is fogging of the lens. In an attempt to address some of these limitations, Jon Berall, a New York City internist and emergency medicine physician, designed the camera screen straight video laryngoscope in 1998. The first true video laryngoscope Glidescope was produced in 1999 and a production version with 60 degree angle, an onboard heater, and a custom screen was first sold in dec 2000. The true video laryngoscope has a camera on the blade with no intervening fiberoptic components. The concept is important because it is simpler to produce and handle the resultant images from CMOS cameras. The integrated camera leads to a series of low cost variants that are not possible with the hybrid Fiberoptic units.

===GlideScope===

In 2001, the GlideScope (designed by vascular and general surgeon John Allen Pacey) became the first commercially available video laryngoscope. It incorporates a high resolution digital camera, connected by a video cable to a high resolution LCD monitor. It can be used for tracheal intubation to provide controlled mechanical ventilation, as well as for removal of foreign bodies from the airway. GlideScope owes its superior results to a combination of five key factors:
# The steep 60-degree angulation of its blade improves the view of the glottis by reducing the requirement for anterior displacement of the tongue.
# The CMOS APS digital camera is located at the point of angulation of the blade (rather than at the tip). This placement allows the operator to more effectively view the field in front of the camera.
# The video camera is recessed for protection from blood and secretions which might otherwise obstruct the view.
# The video camera has a relatively wide viewing angle of 50 degrees.
# The heated lens innovation helps to prevent fogging of the lens, which might otherwise obscure the view.

Tracheal intubation with the GlideScope can be facilitated by the use of the Verathon Stylet, a rigid stylet that is curved to follow the 60° angulation of the blade. To achieve a 99% successful rate of intubation with the GlideScope requires the operator to acquire a new skill set with this stylet.

In a 2003 study, the authors noted that the GlideScope provided adequate vision of the glottis (Cormack and Lehane grade I-II) even when the oral, pharyngeal and laryngeal axes could not be optimally aligned due to the presence of a cervical collar. Despite this significant limitation, the average time to intubate the trachea with the GlideScope was only 38 seconds. In 2005, the first major clinical study comparing the Glidescope to the conventional laryngoscope was published. In 133 patients in whom both Glidescope and conventional laryngoscopy were performed, excellent or good laryngeal exposure was obtained in 124/133 (93%) of Glidescope laryngoscopy patients, compared with only 98/133 (74%) of patients in whom conventional laryngoscopy was used. Intubation was successful in 128/133 (96%) of Glidescope laryngoscopy patients. These early results suggest that this device may be a useful alternative in the management of difficult tracheal intubation.

The Verathon design team later produced the Ranger Video Laryngoscope for a United States Air Force requirement that is now rolling forward into EMS and military use. The Cobalt series of GlideScope then introduced a single-use variant that encompasses weights from 1000 grams to morbid obesity and is successful in many airway syndromes as well. The GlideScope Ranger is a variant designed for use in pre-hospital airway management including air, land, and sea applications. This device weighs 1.5 pounds, and is waterproof as well as airworthy to 20,000 feet altitude. The GlideScope Cobalt is a variant that has a reusable video camera with light-emitting core which has a disposable or single use external shell for prevention of cross infection.

In August 2009, the team at Verathon collaborated with Professor John Sakles from the University of Arizona Emergency Department in achieving the world&#x27;s first tracheal intubation conducted with the assistance of telemedicine technology. During this demonstration, Sakles and the University of Arizona Telemedicine service guided physicians in a rural hospital as they performed a tracheal intubation using the GlideScope.

===Other video laryngoscopes===
Several types of video laryngoscopes are also currently available, such as the HEINE visionPRO, Truview PCD-R Manufactured by Truphatek Israel, Glidescope, McGrath laryngoscope, Daiken Medical Coopdech C-scope VLP-100, the Storz C-Mac, Pentax-AWS(or Airway Scope), Video Macintosh Intubating Laryngoscope System (VMS), the Berci DCI, and the Copilot VL. These laryngoscopes employ a variety of features such as a monitor on the handle and or channels to assist in guiding the endotracheal tube into the trachea. The superior performance of video laryngoscopes in airway management where cervical spine injury is possible has raised the question of whether these scopes should supersede direct laryngoscopy in routine airway management. Further evidence in support of videolaryngoscopy has accumulated over the years, indicating a favourable risk profile for video laryngoscopes over direct laryngoscopes.

==Other noninvasive intubation devices==
Other &quot;noninvasive&quot; devices which can be employed to assist in tracheal intubation are the laryngeal mask airway (Some types of which may be used as a conduit for endotracheal tube placement), the lighted stylet, and the AirTraq. Due to the widespread availability of such devices, the technique of blind digital intubation of the trachea is rarely practiced today, though it may still be useful in emergency situations under austere conditions such as natural or man-made disasters.

==Complications==
Cases of mild or severe injury caused by rough and inexperienced use of laryngoscopes have been reported. These include minor damage to the soft tissues within the throat which causes a sore throat after the operation to major injuries to the larynx and pharynx causing permanent scarring, ulceration and abscesses if left untreated. Additionally, there is a risk of causing tooth damage.

==Etymology and pronunciation==
The word &quot;laryngoscopy&quot; uses combining forms of &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

<doc id="352080" wikidata="Q7757588" url="?curid=352080" title="The Point!">
<text>The Point! is the sixth studio album by American songwriter and musician Harry Nilsson, released in late 1970. It was accompanied by an animated film adaptation directed by Fred Wolf, which aired in early February 1971 on the ABC-TV network. Its lead single, &quot;Me and My Arrow&quot;, peaked at number 34 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

&quot;The Point!&quot; is a fable that tells the story of a boy named Oblio, the only round-headed person in the Pointed Village, where by law everyone and everything must have a point. Nilsson explained his inspiration for &quot;The Point!&quot;: 

==Story==
The round-headed Oblio has had to wear a pointed hat since birth to conceal his &quot;pointless&quot; condition from his pointy-headed peers. However, Oblio is accepted in the town despite his nonconformity, until one day, when the son of an fanatic evil count is unwittingly dishonored by Oblio. The count&#x27;s son challenges Oblio to a one-on-one game of Triangle Toss, where participants catch triangles on their heads. Oblio wins with the help of his dog Arrow. In a fit of rage, the count, who wants his son to rule the land one day, confronts the good-hearted but timid king to reaffirm the law of the land, which states that those who are pointless must be banished from the kingdom and into the Pointless Forest. A jury reluctantly convicts both Oblio and Arrow, leaving the king with no choice but to send the pair away.

Oblio and Arrow are sent to the Pointless Forest, but soon discover that even the Pointless Forest has a point. They meet curious creatures like giant bees, a &quot;pointed man&quot; pointing in all directions who proclaims &quot;A point in every direction is the same as no point at all!&quot;, a man made of rocks, three dancing fat sisters, and a walking, talking tree who helps Oblio see that everyone has a point, although it might not be readily displayed.

Oblio and Arrow spend the night in the Pointless Forest, then awaken to a large stone hand with the finger pointing to their &quot;destination point&quot;. They take the road indicated by the hand and make their way back to the Land of Point, where they receive a hero&#x27;s welcome from the land&#x27;s citizens, and the king. Oblio begins to tell his story but is interrupted by the furious count, who is then silenced by the king.

Oblio tells the king and the people of the land that everything has a point, including the Pointless Forest, and himself. Angered, the count pulls off Oblio&#x27;s pointed hat, but is taken aback when he sees a point on top of Oblio&#x27;s bare head.

Upon this revelation the points of everyone else in the land disappear and the pointed buildings become round.

==Album==
&quot;The Point!&quot; album, unlike the later film, features Nilsson himself telling the story directly to the listener, providing all the characters&#x27; voices as well as the narration.

A small comic book was included with the vinyl record when it was first released. The comic was illustrated by Gary Lund, who was also the production designer of the animated film.

On November 19, 2002, BMG Heritage released a Deluxe CD of the album with demos and a bonus track.

==Animated television film==
===Production===
&quot;The Point&quot;, an animated adaptation of the story, first aired on February 2, 1971. It was the first animated feature ever to air in prime time on US television, appearing on the ABC television network as an &quot;ABC Movie of the Week&quot;.

The film was directed by Fred Wolf and produced by Murakami-Wolf Films in association with Nilsson House Music. This version uses a framing device of a father telling his son the fable as a bedtime story. In its initial airing, the voice of the father was provided by Dustin Hoffman, a friend of Nilsson&#x27;s, who agreed to take US$20,000 for his narration (), but to be used on one broadcast only; for later airings of the film, the narration had to be re-recorded. The initial re-recording was done by actor Alan Barzman. The VHS and DVD releases feature another of Nilsson&#x27;s friends, Ringo Starr, as the father. Another version, seen on cable television in the 1980s and 1990s, featured narration by Alan Thicke. The voices of Oblio and the narrator&#x27;s son were provided by Mike Lookinland, best known for playing Bobby Brady on the television series &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;.

A 50th anniversary Blu-ray edition of the animated version (with the Ringo Starr narration) was released in February 2020.

===Voice cast===

* Paul Frees as Oblio&#x27;s Father/Pointed Man&#x27;s Right Head/King/Leaf Man/Villagers

==Musical play==
In the mid-1970s, Esquire Jauchem, artistic director of the Boston Repertory Theater, adapted and directed a stage musical version that starred 18-year-old David Morse as Oblio. The production later toured to the Trinity Repertory Company in Providence. In 1991, Nilsson gave Jauchem permission to remount his adaptation of &quot;The Point!&quot; at the Chapel Court Theatre in Hollywood, run by Richard and Tamara Merson, who had been involved in the Mermaid Theatre production in London, as well.

In 1977, a stage adaptation of &quot;The Point!&quot; was presented at the Mermaid Theatre in London. Featured in the cast were Davy Jones and Micky Dolenz, both former members of the band The Monkees and long-time friends of Nilsson. To accommodate the expansion of &quot;The Point!&quot; to a full-length musical, other Nilsson songs from various points in his career were incorporated. An original cast album was released in the United Kingdom by MCA. A CD version was released by Varèse Sarabande on July 1, 2016, under license from Geffen, which controls the MCA Records catalogue via Universal Music.

<text>The curlew sandpiper (Calidris ferruginea) is a small wader that breeds on the tundra of Arctic Siberia.

It is strongly migratory, wintering mainly in Africa, but also in south and southeast Asia and in Australia and New Zealand. It is a vagrant to North America.

==Taxonomy==
The curlew sandpiper was formally described in 1763 by the Danish author Erik Pontoppidan under the binomial name &quot;Tringa ferrugineus&quot;. It is now placed with 23 other sandpipers in the genus &quot;Calidris&quot; that was introduced in 1804 by the German naturalist Blasius Merrem. The genus name is from Ancient Greek &quot;kalidris&quot; or &quot;skalidris&quot;, a term used by Aristotle for some grey-coloured waterside birds. The specific &quot;ferruginea&quot; is from Latin &quot;ferrugo, ferruginis&quot;, &quot;iron rust&quot; referring to its colour in breeding plumage. The curlew sandpiper is treated as monotypic: no subspecies are recognised. Within the genus &quot;Calidris&quot; the curlew sandpiper is most closely related to the stilt sandpiper (&quot;Calidris himantopus&quot;).

This species occasionally hybridizes with the sharp-tailed sandpiper and the pectoral sandpiper, producing the presumed &quot;species&quot; called &quot;Cooper&#x27;s sandpiper&quot; (&quot;Calidris&quot; × &quot;cooperi&quot;) and &quot;Cox&#x27;s sandpiper&quot; (&quot;Calidris&quot; × &quot;paramelanotos&quot;), respectively.

==Description==
These birds are small waders, similar to dunlins, but differ in having a longer down-curved beak, longer neck and legs and a white rump. They have a length of , weight of 44-117 g and wingspan of . The breeding adult has patterned dark grey upperparts and brick-red underparts. In winter, this bird is pale grey above and white below, and shows an obvious white supercilium. Juveniles have a grey and brown back, a white belly and a peach-coloured breast.

==Distribution and habitat==
The curlew sandpiper breeds in the Siberian Arctic from the Yamal Peninsula to the Kolyuchin Bay.

==Behaviour==
This wader is highly gregarious, and will form flocks with other calidrid waders, particularly dunlin. Despite its easterly breeding range, this species is regular on passage in western Europe, presumably because of southwesterly migration route.

===Breeding===
The breeding grounds are occupied from June till late August. The male curlew sandpiper performs an aerial display during courtship. The nesting site is at the edge of a marsh or pool, or on dry patches of tundra. The average clutch size is 3.8 eggs which are laid at daily intervals. The eggs are incubated by the female and hatch after 19–20 days. The chicks are cared for by the female for 14–16 days.

The reproductive success of this species appears to be dependent on the population of lemmings (West Siberian lemmings (&quot;Lemmus sibiricus&quot;), East Siberian lemmings (&quot;Lemmus paulus&quot;) and the Arctic lemming (&quot;Dicrostonyx torquatus&quot;). In poor lemming years, predatory species such as the Arctic fox (&quot;Alopes lagopus&quot;) will take Arctic-breeding waders instead.

===Food and feeding===
It forages in soft mud on marshes and the coast, mainly picking up food by sight. It mostly eats insects and other small invertebrates.

==Status==
Counts of the curlew sandpiper in South Africa, specifically at Langebaan Lagoon where they are most numerous, indicate a 40% decline in numbers between 1975 and 2009. A similar trend has been noted in Australia and may be linked to effects of global warming at the breeding grounds. It has an extremely large range but although the population is large it is very hard to determine and appears to be decreasing. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has judged the species to be &quot;Vulnerable&quot;. The curlew sandpiper is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies.

<doc id="352085" wikidata="Q6823262" url="?curid=352085" title="Metasyntax">
<text>A metasyntax is a syntax used to define the syntax of a programming language or formal language. It describes the allowable structure and composition of phrases and sentences of a metalanguage, which is used to describe either a natural language or a computer programming language. Some of the widely used formal metalanguages for computer languages are Backus–Naur form (BNF), extended Backus–Naur form (EBNF), Wirth syntax notation (WSN), and augmented Backus–Naur form (ABNF).

Metalanguages have their own metasyntax each composed of terminal symbols, nonterminal symbols, and &quot;metasymbols&quot;. A terminal symbol, such as a word or a token, is a stand-alone structure in a language being defined. A nonterminal symbol represents a syntactic category, which defines one or more valid phrasal or sentence structure consisted of an n-element subset. Metasymbols provide syntactic information for denotational purposes in a given metasyntax. Terminals, nonterminals, and metasymbols do not apply across all metalanguages.

Typically, the metalanguage for token-level languages (formally called &quot;regular languages&quot;) does not have nonterminals because nesting is not an issue in these regular languages. English, as a metalanguage for describing certain languages, does not contain metasymbols since all explanation could be done using English expression. There are only certain formal metalanguages used for describing recursive languages (formally called context-free languages) that have terminals, nonterminals, and metasymbols in their metasyntax.

==Element of metasyntax==
* Terminals: a stand-alone syntactic structure. Terminals could be denoted by double quoting the name of the terminals.
:e.g. , , , 
* Nonterminals: a symbolic representation defining a set of allowable syntactic structures that is composed of a subset of elements. Nonterminals could be denoted by angle bracketing the name of the nonterminals.
:e.g. , , 

* Metasymbol: a symbolic representation denoting syntactic information.
:e.g. , , , , , 

==Methods of phrase termination==
* Juxtaposition: e.g. 
* Alternation: e.g. 
* Repetition: e.g. 
* Optional phrase: e.g. 
* Grouping: e.g. 

==Specific metasyntax conventions==

===The standard convention===
* &#x27;Backus–Naur form&#x27; denotes nonterminal symbols by angle bracketing the name of the syntactic category, while it denotes terminal symbols by double quoting the terminal words. Terminals can never appear on the left-hand side of the metasymbol in a derivation rule. The body of the definition on the right-hand side may be composed with several alternative forms with each alternative syntactic construct being separated by the metasymbol . Each of these alternative construct may be either terminal or nonterminal.
* &#x27;Extended Backus–Naur form&#x27; uses all facilities in BNF and introduces two more metasymbols for additional features. One of these two new features is applied to denote an optional phrase in a statement by square bracketing the optional phrase. The second feature is applied to denote a phrase that is to be repeated zero or more times by curly bracketing the phrase.
* &#x27;Wirth syntax notation&#x27; uses all facilities in EBNF except that the nonterminals are not necessarily angle bracketed but are always defined on the right-hand side of in its production rule. It also does not require every nonterminal to be explicitly defined. Nonterminals such as and are implicitly defined as ASCII-character and optional white space respectively.
* &#x27;Augmented Backus–Naur form&#x27; denotes nonterminal symbols by starting a one-word-name with an alphabet as the name of the syntactic category. Angle brackets are not required. Terminal symbols are either denoted by double quoted words or denoted by the following numeric structure: a , followed by or or , followed by a numeric value or a &quot;concatenation of numeric values&quot; separated by . Metasymbol is placed between two numeric values to denote &quot;value range&quot;. As that of BNF, the terminals of ABNF never occurs on the left-hand-side of the metasymbol in the derivation rule. Metasymbol denotes &quot;alternations&quot;. White space is used to separate elements in the body of the definition. The metasyntax for &quot;repetition&quot; in ABNF has several forms. A preceding an element denotes the element to be repeated zero or more times. Numeric value followed by followed by numeric value followed by an element denotes the element to be repeated at least times and at most times. A single numeric value preceding an element denotes the element to be repeated times. &quot;Comments&quot; may be express after metasymbol . As in EBNF, square bracketing a phrase denotes the phrase to be &quot;optional&quot;.

===Variations===
The metasyntax convention of these formal metalanguages are not yet formalized. Many metasyntactic variations or extensions exist in the reference manual of various computer programming languages. One variation to the standard convention for denoting nonterminals and terminals is to remove metasymbols such as angle brackets and quotations and apply &quot;font types&quot; to the intended words. In Ada, for example, syntactic categories are denoted by applying lower case sans-serif font on the intended words or symbols. All terminal words or symbols, in Ada, consist of characters of code position between and (inclusive). The definition for each character set is referred to the International Standard described by ISO/IEC 10646:2003. In C and Java, syntactic categories are denoted using italic font while terminal symbols are denoted by gothic font. In J, its metasyntax does not apply metasymbols to describe J&#x27;s syntax at all. Rather, all syntactic explanations are done in a metalanguage very similar to English called Dictionary, which is uniquely documented for J.

===Advantage of the extensions===
The purpose of the new extensions is to provide a simpler and unambiguous metasyntax. In terms of simplicity, BNF&#x27;s metanotation definitely does not help to make the metasyntax easier-to-read as the open-end and close-end metasymbols appear too abundantly. In terms of ambiguity, BNF&#x27;s metanotation generates unnecessary complexity when quotation marks, apostrophes, less-than signs or greater-than signs come to serve as terminal symbols, which they often do. The extended metasyntax utilizes properties such as case, font, and code position of characters to reduce unnecessary aforementioned complexity. Moreover, some metalanguages use fonted separator categories to incorporate metasyntactic features for layout conventions, which are not formally supported by BNF.

<text>The broad-billed sandpiper (Calidris falcinellus) is a small wading bird. The scientific name is from Latin. The specific name &quot;falcinellus&quot; is from &quot;falx, falcis&quot;, &quot;a sickle.&quot; Some research suggests that it and some related species could be placed into a separate genus, &quot;Philomachus&quot;, not presently recognized as valid.

== Description ==

Broad-billed sandpipers are small waders, slightly smaller than the dunlin, but with a longer straighter bill, and shorter legs. The breeding adult has patterned dark grey upperparts and white underparts with blackish markings on the breast. It has a pale crown stripe and supercilia.

In the boreal winter, they are pale grey above and white below, like a winter dunlin, but retaining the head pattern. Juveniles have backs, similar to young dunlin, but the white flanks and belly and brown-streaked breast are distinctive.

Contact call is a dry, whistling “dree-it, dree-it” and a clicking “dik dik”.

== Distribution and habitat ==

The broad-billed sandpiper is strongly migratory, spending the non-breeding season from easternmost Africa, through south and south-east Asia to Australasia. It is highly gregarious, and will form flocks with other scolopacid waders, particularly dunlins. Despite its European breeding range, this species is rare on passage in western Europe, presumably because of the south-easterly migration route.

This bird&#x27;s breeding habitat is wet taiga bogs in Arctic northern Europe and Siberia. The male performs an aerial display during courtship. They nest in a ground scrape, laying 4 eggs.

They forage in soft mud on marshes and the coast, mainly picking up food by sight. They mostly eat insects and other small invertebrates.

== Status ==
This species has a wide distribution range and a large population, but the global population trends show signs of decline which likely exceed 30% in the past three generations, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources classified this species as &quot;Vulnerable&quot;.

The broad-billed sandpiper is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

<doc id="352104" wikidata="Q233499" url="?curid=352104" title="Yoshirō Mori">
<text>is a Japanese politician who served as Prime Minister of Japan and President of the Liberal Democratic Party from 2000 to 2001. He was unpopular in opinion polls during his time in office, and is known for making controversial statements, both during and after his premiership. 

Mori was born in present-day Nomi, Ishikawa, Japan, and worked as a journalist before entering politics. In 1969, Mori was elected in the lower house for the Ishikawa 2nd district. He served in government as education minister in 1983 and 1984, international trade and industry minister in 1992 and 1993, and construction minister in 1995 and 1996, and later became secretary general of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). After Keizō Obuchi suffered a stroke and cerebral hemorrhage on 2 April 2000 and was unable to continue in office, Mori became president of the LDP and prime minister days before Obuchi&#x27;s death.

The media coverage of Mori&#x27;s term as prime minister was dominated by his gaffes and undiplomatic comments, which led to him becoming unpopular in opinion polls. Members of his cabinet resigned due to fundraising scandals, which also contributed to his unpopularity. In November 2000, with Mori&#x27;s approval ratings below 30%, opposition politicians attempted to win a vote of no confidence against Mori by soliciting support from rebels within the LDP, although this was quashed after LDP politicians who voted for the measure were threatened with expulsion. Towards the end of Mori&#x27;s term, his approval rating dropped to single digits. In April 2001, Mori officially announced his intention to resign. Junichiro Koizumi won the subsequent LDP leadership election and became prime minister on 26 April 2001.

After resigning as prime minister, Mori remained a member of the House of Representatives until announcing in July 2012 that he would not stand in the 2012 general election. He remained an important player in Russo-Japanese relations following his resignation as prime minister due to his close personal relationship with Vladimir Putin. Following his premiership, Mori served as the President of the Japan Rugby Football Union as well as the Japan-Korea Parliamentarians&#x27; Union. In 2014, he was appointed to head the organizing committee for the 2020 Summer Olympics and Paralympics, but he resigned in 2021 following gaffes made at a committee meeting that were perceived as sexist. In 2003, Mori received the highest distinction of the Scout Association of Japan, the Golden Pheasant Award.

==Early life and education==
Yoshiro Mori was born in present-day Nomi, Ishikawa, Japan, as the son of Shigeki and Kaoru Mori, wealthy rice farmers with a history in politics, as both his father and grandfather served as the mayor of Neagari, Ishikawa Prefecture. His mother died when Yoshiro was seven years old. He studied at the Waseda University in Tokyo, joining the rugby union club. He developed a passion for the sport but was never a high-level player; he once compared rugby to his relationship with other parties in the ruling coalition by stating: &quot;In rugby, one person doesn&#x27;t become a star, one person plays for all, and all play for one.&quot;

After university, Mori joined the &quot;Sankei Shimbun&quot;, a conservative newspaper in Japan.

==Political career==

In 1962, Mori left the newspaper and became secretary of a Diet member, and in the 1969 general election, he was elected in the lower house at age 32. He was reelected 10 consecutive times. In 1980, he was involved in the Recruit scandal about receiving unlisted shares of Recruit (company) before they were publicly traded, and selling them after they were made public for a profit of approximately 1 million dollars.

Mori was education minister in 1983 and 1984, international trade and industry minister in 1992 and 1993, and construction minister in 1995 and 1996.

In 1999, Mori began to assume control of the Mitsuzuka faction (formerly Abe faction) that had been headed by Hiroshi Mitsuzuka in the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).

==Prime minister==
In the midst of a battle with Liberal Party leader Ichirō Ozawa, Prime Minister Keizō Obuchi suffered a stroke and cerebral hemorrhage on 2 April 2000 and was unable to continue in office. The Cabinet held an emergency meeting and resigned en masse. Mori, who was the secretary general of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), was unanimously elected president, and became prime minister with the votes of the LDP, New Komeito and New Conservative Party (composed of members who left Ozawa&#x27;s party on 3 April). Mori announced that he would keep Obuchi&#x27;s cabinet in place.

===Gaffes===

The media coverage of Mori&#x27;s term as prime minister was dominated by his gaffes and undiplomatic comments. Even prior to his election as prime minister, he had been described in the Japanese media as having &quot;the heart of a flea and the brain of a shark&quot;.

* In January 2000, he made a joke about his campaign in the 1969 election: &quot;When I was greeting farmers from my car, they all went into their homes. I felt like I had AIDS.&quot;
* In February 2000, when asked about the Year 2000 problem in the United States, Mori quipped that &quot;when there is a blackout, the murderers always come out. It&#x27;s that type of society.&quot;
* At Obuchi&#x27;s funeral, Mori failed to clap and bow properly before Obuchi&#x27;s shrine, an important portion of a traditional Japanese funeral rite. The other world leaders present at the funeral, including then U.S. President Bill Clinton, performed the ritual correctly.
* At a meeting of Shinto followers in Tokyo in May 2000, Mori described Japan as &quot;a divine nation (&quot;kami no kuni&quot;) with the Emperor at its center&quot;. This &quot;divine nation statement&quot; stirred controversy in Japan as it invoked the official interpretation of the Emperor as a divine entity during the days of the Empire of Japan. Days after this statement, Mori questioned whether the Japan Communist Party could &quot;ensure Japan&#x27;s security and defend the &quot;kokutai&quot;&quot;, using a term for Japan&#x27;s unity with its divine emperor which had not been in common use since World War II.
* During the June 2000 election, when asked about recent newspaper reports that showed that roughly half of the voters still had not decided for whom to vote, he replied that they could &quot;stay in bed for the day&quot;.
* In October 2000, during a dialogue with British prime minister Tony Blair, Mori stated that the Japanese government had suggested in 1997 that Japanese nationals believed to be abducted by North Korea be arranged to be &quot;found&quot; elsewhere in order to ensure a smooth normalization of the relation between North Korea and Japan, which upset the foreign ministry and led to calls for Mori&#x27;s resignation from conservative voices within the LDP.
* In December 2000, pictures appeared in the weekly magazine &quot;Shukan Gendai&quot; showing him drinking in an Osaka bar with a high-ranking yakuza.
* In February 2001, the US submarine USS &quot;Greeneville&quot; accidentally hit and sank the Japanese fishing ship &quot;Ehime Maru&quot; during an emergency surface drill on 9 February 2001, resulting in nine dead students and teachers. Mori continued a round of golf after being told of the incident, for which he was criticized as being politically tone-deaf.
* One unsubstantiated story concerned the 26th G8 summit in 2000, at which upon meeting U.S. President Bill Clinton, Mori was to say &quot;How are you&quot;. Instead, he allegedly slipped up and said &quot;Who are you;&quot; Clinton answered &quot;Well, I&#x27;m Hillary Clinton&#x27;s husband&quot;, to which Mori replied &quot;Me too&quot;. Snopes.com reported that this was obviously a low-quality fabrication/joke and that the same story had been told about Kim Young-sam several months earlier. It was nonetheless reported by some mainstream media outlets such as the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

===Resignation===
Two senior Mori appointees resigned due to fundraising scandals in August 2000. Mori&#x27;s disapproval rating neared 60% following these resignations.

In November 2000, with Mori&#x27;s approval ratings below 30%, opposition politicians attempted to win a vote of no confidence against Mori by soliciting support from rebels within the LDP, guided by Koichi Kato in the so-called &quot;Kato&#x27;s rebellion&quot;. Hiromu Nonaka, the secretary general of the party, quashed the potential revolt by threatening to expel any LDP politicians who voted for the measure. The vote failed 237 to 190. Nonaka resigned days later amid speculation that he would challenge Mori for leadership of the LDP.

Towards the end of Mori&#x27;s term, his approval rating dropped to single digits. In March 2001, reports surfaced that Mori had told LDP leaders of his plans to resign. Although he denied the reports, they contributed to a massive drop in Japanese stock market prices early that week. On 6 April, he officially announced his intention to resign. Junichiro Koizumi won the subsequent LDP leadership election and became prime minister on 26 April 2001.

===Cabinets===
Mori appointed three cabinets. The third cabinet is officially referred to as a continuation of the second cabinet, as the changes came amid a major administrative realignment in January 2001 that eliminated several cabinet positions and renamed several key ministries.

==Later years==
After resigning as prime minister, Mori remained a member of the House of Representatives, representing the Ishikawa 2nd district, until announcing in July 2012 that he would not stand in the December 2012 general election.

He was awarded the Padma Bhushan, India&#x27;s third highest civilian award, in 2004.

===Russia diplomacy===

Mori remained an important player in Russo-Japanese relations following his resignation as prime minister due to his close personal relationship with Vladimir Putin. Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda of the Democratic Party of Japan considered tapping Mori in 2012 to resolve the dispute between the two countries over the Kuril Islands, despite the fact that Noda and Mori were from opposing parties in the Diet.

In 2013, Mori met with Putin and Sergey Naryshkin in preparations for a summit between Putin and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe. Mori had at one time suggested that Japan could give Russia three of the four disputed islands in exchange for a peace treaty, which went against the Japanese government&#x27;s official view that Moscow should acknowledge Japan&#x27;s ownership of all four.
Mori has a personal connection to Russia, as his father Shigeki Mori developed a relationship with the Siberian town of Shelekhov during his time as mayor of the city of Neagari, and developed a bilateral dialogue to improve the gravesites of Soviet soldiers in Japan and Japanese soldiers in Siberia; he was so close to Russia that Japanese authorities monitored him closely as a potential communist sympathizer. The elder Mori visited Shelekhov more than 15 times during his 35 years in office, and was buried there following his death.

===Sports-related advocacy===
Mori became President of the Japan Rugby Football Union in June 2005. It had been hoped his clout would help secure the 2011 Rugby Union World Cup for Japan, but instead the event was awarded to New Zealand in late November 2005. This led Mori to accuse the Commonwealth of Nations countries of &quot;passing the ball around their friends.&quot; Mori later assisted in Japan&#x27;s successful bids for both the 2019 Rugby World Cup and 2020 Summer Olympics.

In 2014, at the age of 76, he was appointed to head the organizing committee for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. He quipped, &quot;I am destined to live five or six more years if I am lucky. This will be my one last service to the country.&quot; However, Mori drew international and domestic criticism for his critical statements about Japan&#x27;s Olympic figure skaters Mao Asada and Chris Reed and Cathy Reed, who were representing Japan at the 2014 Sochi Olympics.

Another controversy occurred in 2021 when Mori, who at this time was president of the organization responsible for the upcoming Olympic Games, said that women talk too much in meetings. At the organizing committee meeting for the Tokyo Olympics while discussing the objective of aiming for at least 40% of members to be female, he stated that “On boards with a lot of women, the board meetings take so much time. Women have a strong sense of competition. If one person raises their hand, others probably think, I need to say something too. That’s why everyone speaks. [...] You have to regulate speaking time to some extent [...] Or else we’ll never be able to finish” He apologized for his statements and initially stated he would not resign as head of the organizing committee, but on February 11 announced his intention to step down from the post. In his resignation speech the following day, Mori said that he did not intend to demean women, and blamed the media for fueling public anger. He stressed the importance that the Olympics be held in July, adding that the committee&#x27;s efforts would be wasted if he were to cause trouble by remaining in his post. Seiko Hashimoto, an Olympic bronze medalist in women&#x27;s speed skating and a seven-time Olympian, was named as Mori&#x27;s replacement.
===LDP funds scandal===
As the former head of the Seiwa Seisaku Kenkyūkai, which was the main faction involved in the 2023–2024 Japanese slush fund scandal, Mori has come into question for his role in the kickback scheme. Incumbent Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has not rejected the idea of forcing him to testify.

==Personal life==
Mori is an avid rugby fan as well as an amateur player. He is married to Chieko (born: Chieko Maki), a fellow Waseda University student, and he has a son, Yūki Mori, and a daughter, Yoko Fujimoto.

In 2003, he received the highest distinction of the Scout Association of Japan, the Golden Pheasant Award.

<text>The Istriot language () is a Romance language of the Italo-Dalmatian branch spoken by about 400 people in the southwestern part of the Istrian peninsula in Croatia, particularly in Rovinj and Vodnjan. It should not be confused with the Istrian dialect of the Venetian language or the more distantly related Istro-Romanian, a variety of Eastern Romance.

==Classification==
Istriot is a Romance language currently only found in Istria. 
Its classification has remained mostly unclear, various proposals for its affinity exist:

* as being related to the Ladin populations of the Alps. According to the Italian linguist Matteo Bartoli, the Ladin area used to extend – until the year 1000 AD – from southern Istria to Friuli and eastern Switzerland.

* as an independent Northern Italian language, belonging neither to the Venetian language nor to the Gallo-Italic group (opinion shared by linguists Tullio De Mauro and Maurizio Dardano);
* as a variety of the Rhaeto-Romance languages by the Istriot Antonio Ive
* as an independent language of the Italo-Dalmatian group
* as an autochthonous Romance language heavily influenced by Venetian, Friulian and Slavic superstrates by Mirko Deanović
* In 2017 it was classified by the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History with the Dalmatian language in the Dalmatian Romance subgroup,

When Istria was a region of the Kingdom of Italy, Istriot was considered by the authorities as a subdialect of Venetian.

Historically, its speakers never referred to it as &quot;Istriot&quot;; it had six names after the six towns where it was spoken. In Vodnjan it was named &quot;Bumbaro&quot;, in Bale &quot;Valìʃe&quot;, in Rovinj &quot;Ruvignìʃ&quot;, in Šišan &quot;Siʃanìʃ&quot;, in Fažana &quot;Faʃanìʃ&quot; and in Galižana &quot;Galiʃaneʃ&quot;. The term &quot;Istriot&quot; was coined by the 19th-century Italian linguist Graziadio Isaia Ascoli.

This language is still spoken by some people in the Istriot communities in Fertilia and Maristella, in Sardinia.

There are about 400 speakers left, making it an endangered language.

== Vocabulary ==
Below is a comparison of Istriot with several closely related Romance languages and Latin:

== Phonology ==
The phonology of the Istriot language: 

=== Consonants ===
* Sounds can also be noted as among different dialects.
* occurs as a result of a nasal consonant preceding a velar stop.
* can occur as a result of Italian loanwords.

=== Vowels ===
== Orthography ==
The Istriot alphabet is the following:

<text>Ushuaia ( , ) is the capital of Tierra del Fuego, Antártida e Islas del Atlántico Sur Province, Argentina. With a population of 82,615 and a location below the 54th parallel south latitude, Ushuaia claims the title of world&#x27;s southernmost city.

Ushuaia is located in a wide bay on the southern coast of Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego. It is bounded on the north by the Martial mountain range and on the south by the Beagle Channel. It is the only municipality in the Department of Ushuaia and has an area of . It was founded on 12 October 1884 by Augusto Lasserre and is located on the shores of the Beagle Channel surrounded by the mountain range of the Martial Glacier, in the Bay of Ushuaia. In addition to being an administrative center, it is a light industrial port and tourist destination. Ushuaia is located roughly from the Antarctic Peninsula and is one of five internationally recognized Antarctic gateway cities; it is the only South American city with that status besides Chile&#x27;s Punta Arenas. 

== Toponyms ==

The word &quot;Ushuaia&quot; comes from the Yaghan language: &quot;ush&quot; and &quot;waia&quot; (&quot;bay&quot; or &quot;cove&quot;) and means &quot;deep bay&quot; or &quot;bay to background&quot;. The act creating the subprefecture in 1884 cites the name &quot;Oshovia&quot;, one of the many orthographic variations of the word. Its demonym is &quot;Ushuaiense&quot;.

In Spanish the name is pronounced &quot;u-sua-ia&quot; (). The pronunciation &quot;Usuaía&quot; (accented on the &#x27;i&#x27;) is erroneous: the prosodic accent is on the first &#x27;a&#x27;, which is why the word is written without an accent mark.

==History==
The Selk&#x27;nam people, also called the Ona, first arrived in Tierra del Fuego about 10,000 years ago. The southern group of people indigenous to the area, the Yaghan (also known as Yámana), who occupied what is now Ushuaia, lived in continual conflict with the northern inhabitants of the island.

For much of the latter half of the 19th century, the eastern portion of Tierra del Fuego was populated by a substantial majority of nationals who were not Argentine citizens, including a number of British subjects. Ushuaia was founded informally by British missionaries, following previous British surveys, long before Argentine nationals or government representatives arrived there on a permanent basis. The British ship HMS &quot;Beagle&quot;, under the command of Captain Robert FitzRoy, first reached the channel on January 29, 1833, during its maiden voyage surveying Tierra del Fuego. The city was originally named by early British missionaries using the native Yámana name for the area. Much of the early history of the city and its hinterland is described in Lucas Bridges’s book &quot;Uttermost Part of the Earth&quot; (1948). The name &quot;Ushuaia&quot; first appears in letters and reports of the South American Mission Society in England. The British missionary Waite Hockin Stirling became the first European to live in Ushuaia when he stayed with the Yámana people between 18 January and mid-September 1869. In 1870 more British missionaries arrived to establish a small settlement. The following year the first marriage was performed. During 1872, 36 baptisms and seven marriages and the first European birth (Thomas Despard Bridges) in Tierra del Fuego were registered. The first house constructed in Ushuaia was a pre-assembled three room home prepared in the Falkland Islands in 1870 for Reverend Thomas Bridges. One room was for the Bridges family, a second was for a Yámana married couple, while the third served as the chapel.

Thomas Bridges learned the Yaghan language and was a fluent speaker. To a lesser extent he was able to communicate in the Ona (forest dwellers) language. His missionary work was mainly directed at the Yaghans. The word Yamana simply means &quot;people&quot; in the Yaghan language. He wrote a dictionary of the Yaghan language, the original manuscript of which is in the British Museum. As the Yaghans had no ability nor means to write, Thomas Bridges had to construct an alphabet which was suited to the phonetics of the language. The original manuscript was lost three times but recovered and almost published under an incorrect name. More than one alphabet has been used over the years in the rendering of this dictionary. The odyssey of the manuscript covered nearly half a century before it was finally published. Natalie Goodall was instrumental in reprinting the dictionary in 1987 and providing valuable insights into the history of Thomas Bridges&#x27; work. Copies of the dictionary provide material on the letters and pronunciations used which in many respects differ from the alphabet used in the English language. (Ref: A de la Rue).

During 1873, Juan and Clara Lawrence, the first Argentine citizens to visit Ushuaia, arrived to teach school. That same year Julio Argentino Roca, who later served as Argentine President twice, promoted the establishment of a penal colony for re-offenders, modeled after one in Tasmania, Australia, in an effort to secure permanent residents from Argentina and to help establish Argentine sovereignty over all of Tierra del Fuego. But only after the Boundary Treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina did formal efforts get under way to establish the township and its prison.

During the 1880s, many gold prospectors came to Ushuaia following rumors of large gold fields, which proved to be false. On 12 October 1884, as part of the South Atlantic Expedition, Commodore Augusto Lasserre established the sub-division of Ushuaia, with the missionaries and naval officers signing the Act of Ceremony. Don Feliz M Paz was named Governor of Tierra del Fuego and in 1885 named Ushuaia as its capital. In 1885 the territory police was organized under Antonio A. Romero with headquarters also in Ushuaia. But it was not until 1904 that the Federal Government of Argentina recognized Ushuaia as the capital of Tierra del Fuego. The prison was formally announced in an executive order by the then-Acting President Roca in 1896.

Ushuaia suffered several epidemics, including typhus, pertussis, and measles, that much reduced the native population. But because the Yámana were not included in census data, the exact death toll is not known. The first census was held in 1893, which recorded 113 men and 36 women living in Ushuaia. By 1911 the Yámana had all practically disappeared, so the mission was closed. The population grew to 1,558 by the 1914 census.

In 1896 the prison received its first inmates, mainly re-offenders and dangerous prisoners transferred from Buenos Aires, but also some political prisoners. A separate military prison opened in 1903 at the nearby Puerto Golondrina. The two prisons merged in 1910, and that combined complex still stands today. Thus, during the first half of the 20th century, the city centered around the prison built by the Argentine government to increase the Argentine population and to ensure Argentine sovereignty over Tierra del Fuego. The prison followed the example of the British in Tasmania and the French in Devil&#x27;s Island. Escape from Tierra del Fuego was similarly difficult, although two prisoners managed to escape into the surrounding area for a few weeks. The prison population thus became forced colonists and spent much of their time building the town with timber from the forest around the prison. They also built a railway to the settlement, now a tourist attraction known as the End of the World Train (&quot;Tren del Fin del Mundo&quot;), the southernmost railway in the world.

The prison operated until 1947, when President Juan Domingo Perón closed it by executive order in response to the many reports of abuse, unhealthy conditions, and unsafe practices. Most of the guards stayed in Ushuaia, while the prisoners were relocated to other jails farther north. After the prison closed, it became a part of the Base Naval Ushuaia , functioning as a storage and office facility until the early 1990s. Later it was converted into the current Museo Maritimo de Ushuaia.

The naval base at Ushuaia was active during the Falklands War of 1982. The Argentine cruiser ARA &quot;General Belgrano&quot;, subsequently sunk by the British Fleet, sailed from the Port of Ushuaia, where a memorial was erected in February 1996.
==Geography==


=== Physical geography ===
==== Location ====
Ushuaia is located on Ushuaia Bay at 6 meters above sea level, surrounded to the west, north, and east by the Andes Fueguinos. It is the only city accessed from the rest of the country by crossing part of the Andes mountain range, which runs along the southern edge of Tierra del Fuego. National Route 3 crosses the Sierra Alvear through the Garibaldi Pass to enter the Carabajal Valley, where it follows the Olivia River through the Sierra Sorondo to the Beagle Channel and Ushuaia Bay. For this reason, it is considered the only trans-Andean city (&quot;ciudad trasandina&quot;) in Argentina.

Ushuaia has long been described as the southernmost city in the world. While there are settlements farther south, the only one of any notable size is Puerto Williams, a Chilean settlement of some 2,000 residents. As a center of population, commerce, and culture, and as a town of significant size and importance, Ushuaia, however, clearly qualifies as a city. A 1998 article in the newspaper &quot;Clarín&quot; reported that the designation &quot;southernmost city in the world&quot; had been transferred to Puerto Williams by a joint committee from Argentina and Chile, but this was denied by Argentine authorities, and the Secretariat of Tourism of Argentina continues to use the slogan in official documentation and web sites.
====Climate====
Ushuaia features a significantly ocean-moderated mild tundra climate (Köppen: &quot;ET&quot;, bordering on &quot;Cfc&quot;; Trewartha: &quot;Ftkk&quot;), with cool, but not cold, conditions throughout the year (average temperature remains above 0 °C and below 10 °C year round). Vegetation around the city thus does not resemble typical tundra but is instead heavily forested. Temperatures at the Ushuaia – Malvinas Argentinas International Airport average in the coolest month (July), and in the warmest month (January). The record low is in July, and the record high is in January. On average, the city experiences 146 days of precipitation a year, with many cloudy and foggy days, averaging 206 cloudy days a year. This results in Ushuaia receiving an average of 3.93 hours of sunshine per day (an annual total of 1,434 hours) or about 30.2% of possible sunshine. Despite receiving only average annual precipitation, Ushuaia is very humid, with an average humidity of 77%.

Summers tend to be cloudy and windy, with maximum temperatures averaging around during the day and about at night. Temperatures of or more occur only on a handful of days, and night frost is always possible, as well as days below . Temperatures gradually diminish during the autumn, to reach maximum temperatures of about and minimum temperatures of in winter, with frequent snow, sleet and rain showers. Some winters may bring extended periods of frost and snow with a perpetual snow cover, whereas other winters might just bring snowstorms followed by thaws. Temperatures then very slowly recover during the spring, but snow showers and frost are a common occurrence until the beginning of the summer in December, and they might occur even in midsummer. Frost is common in any month.

The southwestern winds make the outer islands wetter, reaching at Isla de los Estados (Island of the States). Because temperatures are cool throughout the year, there is little evaporation. Snow is common in winter and regularly occurs throughout the year. Ushuaia occasionally experiences snow in summer (from November to March). Due to its high southern latitude, the city&#x27;s climate is influenced by Antarctica. The duration of daylight varies from more than 17 hours in summer to just over 7 hours in winter.

===Flora===
Ushuaia is surrounded by Magellanic subpolar forests. On the hills around the town, the following indigenous trees are found: &quot;Drimys winteri&quot; (winter&#x27;s bark), &quot;Maytenus magellanica&quot; (hard-log mayten) and several species of &quot;Nothofagus&quot; (southern beech). Trees in Ushuaia tend to follow the wind direction, and are therefore called &quot;flag-trees&quot; for their uni-directional growth pattern. &quot;Originally this life form was considered genetically determined [&quot;Holtmeier&quot;, 1981] but the term was subsequently used to designate all genetically or environmentally determined stunted and dwarf trees at the timberland.&quot;

==Economy==
The main economic activities are fishing, natural gas and oil extraction, sheep farming and ecotourism.

===Tourism===
Tourist attractions include the Tierra del Fuego National Park and Lapataia Bay. The park can be reached by highway, or via the End of the World Train (&quot;Tren del Fin del Mundo&quot;) from Ushuaia. The city has a museum of Yámana, English, and Argentine settlement, including its years as a prison colony. Wildlife attractions include local birds, penguins, seals and orcas, many of these species colonizing islands in the Beagle Channel. There are daily bus and boat tours to Harberton, the Bridges family compound, Estancia Harberton. Tours also visit the Les Eclaireurs Lighthouse. Les Eclaireurs is sometimes confused with the &quot;Lighthouse at the End of the World&quot; (&quot;faro del fin del mundo&quot;) made famous by Jules Verne in the novel of the same name; but the latter lies some 200 mi (320 km) east of Ushuaia on Isla de los Estados (Island of the States).

===Manufacturing===
Ushuaia&#x27;s industrial sector, led by the Grundig &quot;Renacer&quot; electronics factory, is among the largest in Patagonia.

==Arts and culture==
Since 2007 Ushuaia has hosted the Bienal de Arte Contemporáneo del Fin del Mundo (Biennial of Contemporary Art at the End of the World), created and organized by the Patagonia Arte &amp; Desafío Foundation under the rubric &quot;South Pole of the Arts, Sciences, and Ecology&quot;. The Bienal has gathered over one hundred artists from five continents addressing the motto &quot;think at the End of the World that another world is possible&quot;. As a pedagogical project it encourages students at all levels to &quot;think about a better world&quot;.

==Sports==

As in most of Argentina, football is a popular sport in Ushuaia, and in 2010 the TV show &quot;FIFA Futbol Mundial&quot; did a story about the sport&#x27;s development in this locality. In 2015 Ushuaia hosted the first PATHF Snow Handball Panamerican Championship.

=== Ice hockey ===
A popular sport in Ushuaia is ice hockey, and low temperatures all year long make the city a perfect spot for practicing it outdoors. In 2010 the city opened an outdoor short track and ice hockey Olympic-size ice rink (), the first of its kind in South America. After this Argentina became the first South American nation to be upgraded from affiliate to associate member status of the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF).

Since 2005 the Municipality of Ushuaia and the Argentinean Ice Hockey Federation (FAHH) organize the yearly End of the World Cup (&quot;Copa del Fin del Mundo&quot;) that has gathered ice hockey teams from Ushuaia, Buenos Aires, Punta Arenas and São Paulo and includes seven different competitions: one for men, one for women, four junior categories and an international tournament.

Beside the local league and the Copa del Fin del Mundo, in 2016 the city hosted the first ice hockey Patagonian Championship, with teams from Ushuaia, Río Grande and Punta Arenas. After the tournament a new plan to build a roof over the ice rink was announced. Ushuaia has two rival teams: Club Andino de Ushuaia (CAU) and Los Ñires.

=== Skiing ===

Several ski areas are located near Ushuaia, including Glacier El Martial (on Martial Mountains) and Cerro Castor. Opened in 1999, Cerro Castor is the southernmost full-fledged ski resort in the world. On Cerro Castor, it is possible to ski just above sea level. The summit reaches an elevation of above sea level, and consistently cool temperatures allow the longest skiing season in South America. Winter temperatures fluctuate from . It has ten elevation facilities and 28 ski trails for all skill levels. There are cafeterias, mountain huts, a ski school, a first aid room and a forest of beech. Snowboarding, sledding, and snowshoeing are also available at Cerro Castor, in addition to alpine skiing. It is located on the southern side of Cerro Krund, north of Ushuaia. The ski season is typically between June through October. In 2012 Cerro Castor hosted the FIS Freestyle Slopestyle World Cup, organized by the International Ski Federation (FIS), and in 2015 it hosted the Interski Congress and World Cup, organized by the International Ski Instructors Association, which was its first ever event in the Southern Hemisphere.

The glacier is popular even during the summer months, when the chairlift operates in both directions. Hiking trails lead from the city&#x27;s edge to the base of the glacier, which has retreated considerably over the past century, as shown in photographs on display at the Antarctic Museum of Ushuaia.

The Valley of Tierra Mayor and the Francisco Jerman Nordic Ski Area, located 20 km and 5 km away from Ushuaia respectively, are popular cross-country venues. Since 1986 Tierra Mayor hosts the annual Marchablanca, a 21 km traditional race organized by the Club Andino Ushuaia, and the Ushuaia Loppet, a full distance marathon that is one of the 20 members of the Worldloppet Ski Federation. Usually this race starts the Federation&#x27;s Marathon Series in August.

In October 2014 the Argentine Olympic Committee (COA) revealed the plan to use the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics, to be held in Buenos Aires, as the launchpad for a bid in the near future. The Committee identified Argentina&#x27;s south-eastern region of Patagonia, which comprises the southern section of the Andes mountains, as a possible location to host the Winter Games. In 2010 it was suggested that Ushuaia would be the main option for a bid. Before the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics, International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach visited Ushuaia and talked about the possibility of holding the 2024 Winter Youth Olympics there.

==Government==
The city government consists of a Mayor (executive), City Council (seven members, legislative) and the Tribunal de Faltas (small court, judicial).

==Education==
Ushuaia has twelve secondary schools, four of which also provide adult education. The Colegio Nacional de Ushuaia is one of the newest schools in the city and was modeled after the Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires. Another important secondary school is Colegio Diocesano Monseñor Miguel Ángel Alemán, which takes its name from the monsignor of the same name.

The National University of Patagonia San Juan Bosco operates a campus in Ushuaia, with Faculties of Engineering, Economics and Humanities, and Social Sciences.

The National University of Tierra del Fuego, inaugurated in 2010, has its headquarters in Ushuaia.

==Media==

===Television===
Ushuaia has two television stations: channel 11 and channel 13.

===Newspapers===
There are two main newspapers: &quot;El Diario del Fin del Mundo&quot; and &quot;El Diario La Prensa&quot;, as well as several other minor publications.

=== Stamps ===
The port of Ushuaia is depicted on a postage stamp released by Correo Argentino in January 2023. The stamp, denominated at 1,000 Argentine pesos, is the highest value in the National Parks series.

==Transportation==


===Air===
Ushuaia receives regular flights at Ushuaia – Malvinas Argentinas International Airport from El Calafate, Buenos Aires and Santiago, Chile.

===Sea===
In addition to being a vacation destination for local and international tourists, Ushuaia is also the key access point to the Southern Ocean, including subantarctic islands such as the Falkland Islands, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, and to Antarctic islands such as the South Orkney Islands and the South Shetland Islands. Its commercial pier is the major port of departure in the world for tourist and scientific expeditions to the Antarctic Peninsula. Several cruise and freight lines also provide transportation between Ushuaia and Valparaíso, Punta Arenas, Buenos Aires, and local seaports and settlements.

===Road===
The south terminus of the Pan-American Highway, which is also the south end of Argentina National Route 3, is located in Tierra del Fuego National Park.

==Health care==
Located at the corner of Avenida 12 de Octubre and Maipú, the &quot;Hospital Gobernador Ernesto M. Campos&quot; is one of the two main health care centers in Ushuaia; the other one is private and it is called Clínica San Jorge.

==Filmography==
&quot;Ushuaïa, le magazine de l&#x27;Extrême&quot; was the name of a television program, presented by Nicolas Hulot and broadcast on the French TV channel TF1 from September 1987 to June 1995. The show is known in English as &quot;Ushuaia: The Ultimate Adventure&quot;, and this language&#x27;s version was hosted by Perri Peltz and was shown on NBC, CNBC, and international affiliates of the Discovery Channel.. The city was also featured on the American CBS reality television show &quot;The Amazing Race&quot; in the fourth leg of season 11.

In 2014, BBC car program &quot;Top Gear&quot; visited Ushuaia at the conclusion of their &quot;Patagonia Special&quot;, with the intent of constructing a stadium and playing a game of car football there. Before they could do so, however, they were chased out of the city (and subsequently across the border into Chile) by mobs of people angered by an apparent reference to the Falklands War encoded in the registration plate of presenter Jeremy Clarkson&#x27;s vehicle (H982 FKL).

The summit of Cerro Alarkén served as the finishing line for the second series of the BBC program Race Across the World in 2020.

Several scenes in the 2015 film &quot;The Revenant&quot;, directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu, were shot in Ushuaia from July through November 2014.

The Apple TV+ original television series &quot;Long Way Up&quot; started its journey in Ushuaia.

<text>Daniel Frederic Steck (December 16, 1881December 31, 1950), was the only Iowa Democrat in the United States Senate between the American Civil War and the Great Depression. He was sworn in as senator only after an extraordinary election challenge, in which his apparent defeat at the polls by a Progressive Party ally running as a Republican was reversed by a Republican-controlled U.S. Senate over seventeen months later.

==Personal background==
Steck was born in Ottumwa, Iowa, in Wapello County. He attended Ottumwa schools. He graduated from the University of Iowa College of Law in 1906, was admitted to the bar the same year, and commenced private practice in Ottumwa. He served as Wapello County Attorney for four years. During the First World War, he served in France as a captain of the Company C outpost signal company of the Iowa National Guard&#x27;s Third Infantry, then resumed the practice of law in Ottumwa.

He was married to Lucile Oehler of Iowa City, Iowa. They had one infant daughter, Edith Margaret born April 4, 1909, and who died April 5, 1909. The couple had no other children.

==Fight against the Klan==
Upon the formation of the American Legion by World War I veterans in 1919, Steck was elected to several leadership roles, including a term as commander of the Iowa chapter, and positions on national Legion committees. At the Legion&#x27;s 1923 National Convention, Steck led efforts to condemn the Ku Klux Klan, which was approaching the height of its national influence. The convention adopted a resolution that did not mention the Klan by name but that condemned organizations fostering racial, religious, or class strife.

==Senate election and service==
In 1924, Steck won the Democratic nomination to run against incumbent Senator Smith W. Brookhart, who had been elected just two years earlier in a special election. Brookhart had run as a Republican and won the Republican nomination, but angered many within his party by crusading against business interests, demanding the withdrawal of Charles Dawes, President Coolidge&#x27;s running mate, and by endorsing Progressive Party presidential candidate Robert M. La Follette. By the middle of October 1924, the editorial pages of all but one of the state&#x27;s major Republican daily newspapers had encouraged Republicans to vote for Steck over Brookhart. The day after the election, newspapers reported that Steck had won. However, two days after the election, late returns from rural districts appeared to give Brookhart a tiny lead. Because Steck appeared to have lost the race by a small margin, with Brookhart getting 447,706 votes to Steck&#x27;s 446,951, Brookhart initially retained his seat, and was sworn in on March 4, 1925.

Steck, however, had filed an election challenge with the Senate Committee on Elections and Privileges. His challenge succeeded on April 12, 1926, when the Senate voted by a margin of 45 to 41 to declare Steck the victor. Steck then took over the seat and served out the remainder of the term, while Brookhart immediately filed as a candidate for Iowa&#x27;s other Senate seat, which he captured later that year. On other occasions the Senate has settled election disputes before a senator took office, but this is the only time the results were overturned after the senator was seated.

When he took office in 1926, Steck became Iowa&#x27;s first Democratic senator since George Wallace Jones left office in 1859.

Steck maintained a low profile in the Senate. In the 71st Congress (from March 1929 to March 1931), he spoke on the Senate floor only four times.

Steck voted against the Republican-supported Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, foreseeing that it would trigger retaliatory tariffs, and fearful of the effects of those tariffs on international markets for Iowa&#x27;s farm products. However, as a Democratic senator from a state that consistently voted for Republicans, Steck&#x27;s could not afford to follow a strict party line. &quot;Time&quot; magazine reported that he &quot;votes more like a regular Republican than any other member of his party.&quot; Steck&#x27;s successful election challenge also left Brookhart seeking revenge, even after Brookhart was elected again to the Senate. In 1930, &quot;Time&quot; also reported that Brookhart &quot;vowed that Senator Steck will not return to the Capitol if he (Brookhart) &#x27;has to turn Iowa upside down. Steck ran for re-election that year, but was not favored to retain his seat.

In 1930, Steck was renominated, but lost to Republican U.S. Representative L. J. Dickinson of Algona, Iowa.

==After the Senate==

In 1931, Steck was considered the favorite for appointment by President Herbert Hoover to a seat reserved for a Democrat on the Tariff Commission. However, due to the opposition of Brookhart, Dickinson, and other Iowans, Hoover did not nominate Steck, but instead selected Ira Orburn of Connecticut.

In April 1932 Steck announced his candidacy for Brookhart&#x27;s Senate seat, in an already-crowded Democratic primary. He finished second to Louis Murphy of Dubuque, who went on to win the general election.

In 1933 Steck was named by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to a board to hear appeals of Iowa veterans challenging adverse determinations regarding disability claims. However, he could not accept that appointment because U.S. Attorney General Homer Stille Cummings appointed him as a special assistant attorney general to take charge of condemnation of property needed for the expansion of the upper Mississippi River channel. Steck served in that position until 1947.

In November 1935, Steck was jokingly appointed by Iowa Governor Clyde Herring as one of his counsel, along with Minnesota Governor Floyd B. Olson, to defend him against a citizen&#x27;s criminal complaint filed against Herring for unlawful gambling. The prize in the bet in question was a pig - soon named Floyd of Rosedale, and depicted in bronze after its death as a traveling trophy - wagered over the outcome of the 1935 football game between the Iowa Hawkeyes and the Minnesota Gophers. The criminal charge was dismissed on jurisdictional reasons, and Steck accompanied the pig to St. Paul to deliver it to Olson.

Steck died in Ottumwa on December 31, 1950, and was interred in Ottumwa Cemetery.

<text>The dusky warbler (Phylloscopus fuscatus) is a leaf warbler which breeds in the east Palearctic. The genus name &quot;Phylloscopus&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;phullon&quot;, &quot;leaf&quot;, and &quot;skopos&quot;, &quot;seeker&quot; (from &quot;skopeo&quot;, &quot;to watch&quot;). The specific &quot;fuscatus&quot; is from Latin &quot;fuscus&quot; &quot;dark&quot;.

This warbler is strongly migratory and winters in South Asia and South-east Asia. It sometimes occurs in North America in Alaska, and has also occurred in California.

This is an abundant bird of taiga bogs and wet meadows. The nest is built low in a bush, and 5–6 eggs are laid. Like most Old World warblers, this small passerine is insectivorous.

The dusky warbler is prone to vagrancy as far as western Europe in October, despite a 3000 km distance from its breeding grounds. It has wintered in Great Britain.

This is a warbler similar in size and shape to a chiffchaff. The adult has an unstreaked brown back and buff underparts. There is a prominent whitish supercilium, and the bill is fine and pointed. The sexes are identical, as with most warblers, but young birds are more olive-tinged above. Like most warblers, it is insectivorous, but will take other small food items, including berries.

The song is a monotonous whistle, and the call is a harsh &quot;check&quot;. The call is often the first clue that this typically skulking species is present, away from the breeding grounds.

<text>Radde&#x27;s warbler (Phylloscopus schwarzi) is a leaf warbler which breeds in Siberia. This warbler is strongly migratory and winters in Southeast Asia. The genus name &quot;Phylloscopus&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;phullon&quot;, &quot;leaf&quot;, and &quot;skopos&quot;, &quot;seeker&quot; (from &quot;skopeo&quot;, &quot;to watch&quot;). The specific &quot;schwarzi&quot; commemorates German astronomer Ludwig Schwarz (1822–1894).

==Description==
This is a warbler similar in size to a willow warbler. The adult has an unstreaked brown back and buff underparts. There is a very long prominent whitish supercilium, and the pointed bill is thicker than that of the similar dusky warbler. The legs are paler than dusky&#x27;s, and the feet look large, reflecting the more terrestrial lifestyle of this warbler. The sexes are identical, as with most warblers, but young birds are yellower below. The call is a soft &quot;chick&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
Radde&#x27;s warbler breeds in southern parts of Central and Eastern Siberia as far east as Korea and Manchuria. It is a migratory species and spends the winter in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Thailand. In its breeding range, Radde&#x27;s warbler is found in open deciduous woodlands with some undergrowth and bushy woodland margins, often near water. In its winter quarters it occupies the fringes of forests, thick scrub and bushy places near woodland. Like most Old World warblers, this small passerine bird is insectivorous.

==Breeding==
The nest is built low in a bush and about five eggs are laid. They have a greyish background colour mottled and streaked with fine markings of brownish-olive, scattered evenly over the surface and which nearly obscures the base colour. They are approximately .

This small warbler is prone to vagrancy as far as western Europe in October, despite a 3000 km distance from its breeding grounds. It has been recorded from the Copeland Bird Observatory in County Down, Northern Ireland where it was first recorded for Northern Ireland in 2008. It has also occurred as an accidental in Heligoland.

<doc id="352118" wikidata="Q311080" url="?curid=352118" title="Uesugi Kenshin">
<text>, later known as , was a Japanese &quot;daimyō&quot;. He was born in Nagao clan, and after adoption into the Uesugi clan, ruled Echigo Province in the Sengoku period of Japan. He was one of the most powerful &quot;daimyō&quot; of the Sengoku period. Known as the &quot;Dragon of Echigo&quot;, while chiefly remembered for his feats and prowess on the battlefield as a military genius and war hero, Kenshin is also regarded as an extremely skillful administrator who fostered the growth of local industries and trade, and his rule saw a marked rise in the standard of living of Echigo.

Kenshin is famed for his honourable conduct, his military expertise, a long-standing rivalry with Takeda Shingen, his numerous defensive campaigns to restore order in the Kantō region as the &quot;Kanto Kanrei&quot;, and his belief in the Buddhist god of war Bishamonten. Many of his followers and others believed him to be the avatar of Bishamonten, and called Kenshin the &quot;God of War&quot;.

==Name==

His original name was Nagao Kagetora (長尾景虎). He changed his name to Uesugi Masatora (上杉政虎) when he inherited the Uesugi clan, and in order to accept the official title of &quot;Kantō Kanrei&quot; (関東管領) he changed his name again to Uesugi Terutora (上杉輝虎) to honor the 13th &quot;shōgun&quot; Ashikaga Yoshiteru (足利義輝), and finally to Kenshin (上杉謙信) after he vowed to become a Zen-Buddhist; in particular, he would become renowned for being a devotee of Bishamonten.

Kenshin was born in the Tiger year (Chinese zodiac) and always kept the word &quot;tora&quot; (虎, tiger) in his names. He is respected as &quot;The Tiger of Echigo&quot; for his intelligent capabilities and excellent contributions.

Kenshin is also referred to as &quot;The Dragon of Echigo&quot; (越後の龍) because of his Kakarimidareryuu (懸かり亂れ龍) ensign displayed on the battlefield. His rival Takeda Shingen was called &quot;The Tiger of Kai&quot;. They fought several times at Battles of Kawanakajima. In some versions of Chinese mythology (Shingen and Kenshin had always been interested in Chinese culture, especially the works of Sun Tzu), the Dragon and Tiger have always been bitter rivals who try to defeat one another, but neither is ever able to gain the upper hand. Kenshin and Shingen were also known to harbour a deep respect for the other&#x27;s military prowess and strategic foresight with Kenshin even going so far as to express remorse and weep at news of Shingen&#x27;s death.

His ceremony of departure to war started with praying at the shrine of Bishamonten, a traditional farewell meal with the generals with three dishes (symbolizing good fortune) and three cups, which also symbolized good luck and onmyōdō&#x27;s heaven, earth and man. It was followed by two shouts &quot;Ei!&quot; (Glory&quot;) and &quot;O!&quot; (Yes!) with the assembled troops, also repeated three times, and the army standard lowered to the generals as a way of respect. In the end, Kenshin re-dedicated to the war god with the &quot;bow of Hachiman&quot;, and mounted his horse surrounded by three flag banners; first with the first character of the Bishamonten&#x27;s name, second with the red rising sun on blue (Emperor&#x27;s gift), and the warring dragon flag.

==Early life and rise==
Kenshin born as Kagetora, he was the third or fourth son of the noted warrior Nagao Tamekage (長尾為景), and his life presents a unique story – he was not from the Uesugi, but Nagao clan. His father&#x27;s family were the retainers of the Yamanouchi branch of the Uesugi clan, and his father has gained some renown with his military victories over his lords Uesugi Akisada, Uesugi Sadanori and Uesugi Funayoshi. However, in later years, Tamekage found himself at odds with the neighboring Ikkō-ikki of Hokuriku, and as the political power in the region started to shift in favor of the Ikkō-ikki (due largely to the sudden rise of Hongan-ji), the situation for Echigo quickly deteriorated. It came to a peak in 1536, when Kenshin&#x27;s father gathered up an army and marched westward. However, upon arriving at Sendanno (December 1536) in Etchū, his forces were suddenly attacked by Enami Kazuyori, and in the resulting fracas Tamekage himself was slain, and his army put to flight.

The impact back at Echigo was immediate. Nagao Harukage, Tamekage&#x27;s eldest son, immediately made his bid for control of the Nagao, and succeeded in this claim after a power struggle which resulted in the death of one of his brothers, Kageyasu. Kenshin was removed from the conflict and relocated to Rinsen-ji temple, where he spent his life from 7 to 14 dedicated to study, martial arts and Zen.

At the age of 14, Kenshin was suddenly contacted by Usami Sadamitsu and a number of other acquaintances of his late father. They urged the young Nagao son to go to Echigo and contest his older brother&#x27;s rule. It would seem that Harukage hadn&#x27;t proven the most effective or inspiring leader (probably due to ill health), and his failure to exert control and gain support of the powerful &quot;kokujin&quot; families had resulted in a situation which was nearly to the point of tearing the province apart. As the story is told, at first Kenshin was reluctant to take the field against his own brother, but was eventually convinced that it was necessary to the survival of Echigo.

At the age of 15 he was placed in joint command of Tochio Castle, making a reputation for himself by successfully defending it against the rebels who were plotting against the Uesugi, and Kenshin succeeded in wresting control of the Nagao clan from Nagao Harukage in 1548. 
Nagao Harukage stepped down from the lead of the clan and provincial government and gave the titles to his younger brother. Harukage died five years later in 1553.

At the age of 19 Kenshin became the head of the Nagao clan and entered the Kasugayama Castle, but still as the retainer of the Uesugi clan.

In the year 1551, Kenshin was called upon to provide refuge in his castle for his nominal lord, Uesugi Norimasa, who had been forced to flee there due to the expansion into the Kantō region by the lord Hōjō Ujiyasu from the Hōjō clan. He agreed to give the warlord shelter, under specific terms, but was not in a position at the time to move against the Hōjō. The terms were Norimasa&#x27;s adoption of Kenshin as his heir, the title Lord of Echigo, and the Kantō Kanrei post as &quot;shōgun&quot;″s deputy. 
Uesugi Norimasa, passed on the Uesugi name to Nagao Kagetora of the Nagao clan, become &quot;Uesugi Masatora&quot; who was gaining power as the Governor of Echigo.

In 1552, the Uesugi started to wage war against the Hōjō clan. Though his rule over the Nagao and Uesugi clans were now unquestioned, much of Echigo was still independent of this young warlord&#x27;s grasp. Kenshin immediately set out to cement his power in the region, but these efforts were still in their infant stages when far more pressing concerns appeared.

In 1553, Ogasawara Nagatoki and Murakami Yoshikiyo, two Shinano lords, both appeared before Kenshin requesting his help in halting the advances of the powerful warlord Takeda Shingen. Around the time Kenshin became the new lord of Echigo, Shingen had won major victories in Shinano Province. With the Takeda&#x27;s conquests taking them remarkably close to the borders of Echigo, Kenshin agreed to take the field on two fronts, against Hojo and Takeda, however the conflicts between the three lords showed also various alliances and treaties.

In 1561, Masatora took the name of &quot;Uesugi Terutora&quot;, upon succeeding as head of the Yamanouchi-Uesugi family and assuming the position of Kanto Kanrei. Later, he changed his name again, finally to &#x27;Kenshin&#x27; after he became a Buddhist monk.

==Conflict with Takeda==

What followed after the triple alliance of Kenshin was the beginning of a rivalry which became legendary in the history of Japan and the Sengoku period. In the first conflict between the two, both Uesugi Kenshin and Takeda Shingen were very cautious, only committing themselves to indecisive skirmishes. Over the years, there would be a total of five such engagements at the famous site of Kawanakajima (1553, 1555, 1557, 1561, 1564), though only the fourth battle would prove to be a serious all-out battle between the two.

===4th Battle of Kawanakajima===

In 1561, Kenshin and Shingen fought the biggest battle they would fight, the fourth battle of Kawanakajima. Kenshin used an ingenious tactic: a special formation where the soldiers in the front would switch with their comrades in the rear, as those in the frontline became tired or wounded. This allowed the tired soldiers to take a break, while the soldiers who had not seen action would fight on the front lines. This was extremely effective and because of this Kenshin nearly defeated Shingen. In &quot;Kōyō Gunkan&quot; there is one of the most famous instances of single combat in samurai history; during this battle, Kenshin managed to ride up to Shingen and slashed at him with his sword. Shingen fended off the blows with his iron war fan or &quot;tessen&quot;. Kenshin failed to finish Shingen off before a Takeda retainer drove him away. Shingen made a counter-attack and the Uesugi army retreated. The result of the fourth battle of Kawanakajima is still uncertain. Many scholars are divided on who the actual victor was, if the battle was actually decisive enough to even declare one, thus is generally considered a draw. It is considered to be the largest casualty battle in the Sengoku period, with loss of estimated 72 percent of Kenshin&#x27;s army and 62 percent of Shingen&#x27;s army, but Shingen also lost two of his most important generals during the battle, namely his advisor Yamamoto Kansuke and younger brother Takeda Nobushige. Some more conservative estimates place the casualties around 20 percent.

In 1563, Shingen allied with Hōjō Ujiyasu against the Uesugi clan, they captured Matsuyama Castle in Musashi Province. In 1565, Shingen then took Kuragano Castle and Minowa Castle in Kōzuke province. In 1571, Kenshin attacked Shingen&#x27;s satellite Ishikura Castle in Kōzuke province, and they again faced each other at the Battle of Tonegawa, to once again disengage.

In addition, after Shingen broke with the Hōjō, there was an incident when the Hōjō clan boycotted salt supplies to Kai Province. When Kenshin heard of Shingen&#x27;s problem, he sent salt to Shingen from his own province. Kenshin commented that the Hōjō had &quot;performed a very mean act&quot;. Kenshin added, &quot;I do not fight with salt, but with the sword&quot;. However, there is doubt that Kenshin&#x27;s act as purely altruistic as it was recorded that he did not merely sending salts, but allowing the merchants of Echigo to sell their salts in Takeda&#x27;s territory. In essence, it was argued that Kenshin also saw the economic opportunity for merchants under his rule to prosper to go into Shingen&#x27;s territories and selling salt, which direly needed by peoples of Kai due to the salt embargo enacted by the Hōjō.

Kenshin&#x27;s respect for Shingen is evident from his reaction to Shingen&#x27;s death: he privately wept and stated, &quot;I have lost my good rival. We won&#x27;t have a hero like that again!&quot;

==Conflict with Hōjō==
Though his rivalry with Takeda Shingen was legendary, Uesugi Kenshin actually had a number of other ventures occurring around the times of these famous battles (1553–1564).

In the year 1559, he made a trip with escort of 5,000 men to pay homage to the &quot;shōgun&quot; in Kyoto. This served to heighten his reputation considerably, and added to his image as a cultured leader as well as a warlord. This same year he was pushed once again by Uesugi Norimasa to take control of the Kantō back from the Hōjō, and in 1560 he was able to comply. In August of the same year, he put southern Echigo under control of a five-man council for broad mobilization, as well formed a small investigative council for any kind of unrest.

===1st Siege of Odawara===

Heading a campaign against Hōjō Ujiyasu from fall 1560 to the summer of 1561, Kenshin was successful in taking a number of castles from the clan, like Numata Castle and Umayabashi Castle, which ended with the first siege of Odawara Castle in Sagami Province. He managed to break the defenses and burn the town, but the castle itself remained unconquered due to threats from Shingen, and thus seized Kamakura.

In 1563, Kenshin saved his ally Ōta Sukemasa who was under siege by both Hōjō Ujiyasu and Takeda Shingen, while in November 1569 when Shingen sieged Odawara Castle, Ujiyasu requested help from Kenshin.

In 1566, after Yura clan of Kozuke Province changed their allegiance to Hojo clan. Later in 1574, Kenshin ordered the Satake clan to attack Yura clan Kanayama Castle, and participated in the siege himself, but Kanayama castle withstood the attack.

==Uesugi expansion==

In 1563, Kenshin occupied Sano Domain of Kōzuke Province. He besieged Karasawa Castle against Sano Masatsune and made strong inroads into the region, forcing many of the smaller warlords to submit to him. At this point, by 1564 Kenshin controlled Echizen Province and Kōzuke Province. in June 12 of the same year, Kenshin entered alliance with Hōjō Ujiyasu and Oda Nobunaga. Later, in same month, Shingen asked shogun Yoshiaki Ashikaga and Nobunaga to mediate peace agreement with Kenshin, which was responded to by Nobunaga to ask Kenshin for peace agreement with Shingen, in a meeting which called &quot;Koetsu Peace Agreement&quot;. However, in March of the next year, Kenshin break the negotiation with Shingen and instead reaffirm his alliance with Hōjō clan. Meanwhile, Tokugawa Ieyasu, who was an ally of the Hōjō clan, also seeking alliance with Kenshin by sending envoy to the Uesugi clan. In response, Kenshin sent a reply dated August 22 to Tokugawa clan&#x27;s senior vassal, Sakai Tadatsugu, and Matsudaira Masanori (son of Yoshinori, 1546-1582), a member of the Matsudaira clan. In the reply, he indicated his intention to come to an agreement. From this point, concrete alliance negotiations began, and on October 8, Ieyasu issued a pledge to Kenshin and also broke his relationship with the Takeda clan. As Ieyasu formed an alliance with Kenshin, he swore to break off relations with Shingen and afforded to have the marriage proposal between relatives of Nobunaga and Shingen to be called off.

The other main area which interested Uesugi Kenshin was Etchū Province in the west, and Kenshin would spend nearly half his life involved in the politics of that province. The land was inhabited by two feuding clans, the and the . Kenshin first entered the dispute as a mediator in the early 1560s between rivals Shiina Yasutane and Jinbō Nagamoto, but he later sided with the Shiina and took over the Jinbo clan. Decades later, Kenshin turned against the Shiina clan, taking their main castle in 1570 and having Shiina Yasutane assassinated in 1576 by Kojima Motoshige.

By the 1570s, after Kenshin took Toyama Castle and Matsukura Castle, Kenshin governed Echigo Province, controlled Kōzuke Province, Etchū Province and some adjacent provinces, all Hokuriku seaboard, and routed Oda Nobunaga&#x27;s forces in Echizen Province.

==Conflict with Oda==
In 1568, when Oda Nobunaga installed Ashikaga Yoshiaki as the &quot;shogun&quot;, Kenshin praised Nobunaga. Their good relationship continued for a while, but in 1573, when Nobunaga expelled Yoshiaki, their relationship became delicate. Under the protection of the Mōri clan, Yoshiaki, began frequently requesting Uesugi, Takeda, and Hōjō to join forces and overthrow Nobunaga. Kenshin broke his alliance with Nobunaga. Through the mediation of Yoshiaki, he reconciled with Kennyo, formed an alliance, and became a member of the power opposed to Nobunaga. When the death of Hatakeyama Yoshitaka, a lord in Noto Province, sparked up confusion and conflict, Kenshin was quick to use the opportunity, taking land from the weakened clan and successfully besieged Nanao Castle, which put him in a position to threaten Nobunaga and his allies. In response, Nobunaga pulled together his own forces and those of his two best generals, Shibata Katsuie and Maeda Toshiie, to meet Kenshin at the Battle of Tedorigawa (1577) in Kaga Province.

===Battle of Tedorigawa===

Kenshin based his 30,000 strong army at the castle of Matsuto, while Oda Nobunaga&#x27;s forces arrived with 50,000 troops led by many famous generals. Despite Nobunaga&#x27;s superior numbers, Kenshin managed to score a solid victory on the field. At first, Kenshin anticipated that Nobunaga would try to move by night over the river for dawn attack and thus refused to engage the Nobunaga army. Then he pretended to send forth a small unit to attack Nobunaga&#x27;s main force from behind and gave his enemy a great opportunity to crush his remaining force. Nobunaga took the bait. Nobunaga&#x27;s force attacked at night expecting a weakened opponent at the front; instead Kenshin&#x27;s full military might was waiting. Having lost 1,000 men in combat and some more as the Oda troops attempted to escape across the Tedori River, Nobunaga ordered a retreat into Ōmi Province. However, Kenshin, who described the opponent&#x27;s performance as &quot;surprisingly weak&quot;, had a false impression to have defeated Nobunaga, as the Oda army was actually led by Shibata Katsuie. Eventually, Kenshin secured the Noto Province from the Oda clan.

==Death==

In October 1577, Uesugi Kenshin arranged to put forth a grand army to continue his assaults into Nobunaga&#x27;s land. In 1578, he entered an alliance with Takeda Katsuyori against Nobunaga, but was held up by bad weather and died of esophageal cancer in the spring of 1578. His death poem was: 

The cause of Kenshin&#x27;s death has been questioned throughout the years. The theory accepted by most scholars is the record of his deteriorating health by early sources, such as his complaints of pain in the chest &quot;like an iron ball&quot;, and as &quot;Kenshin Gunki&quot; (1582) records &quot;on the 9th day of the 3rd month he had a stomach ache in his toilet. This unfortunately persisted until the 13th day when he died&quot;. However, it is also speculated that he was victim of one of the most famous ninja assassinations, by a ninja concealed in the cesspool beneath the latrine at Kenshin&#x27;s camp with a short spear or sword. The theories are not mutually exclusive — the assassin, if he existed, might simply have fatally wounded an already dying man. However, as his anticipation of his own death is recorded in the death poem, the possibility of the assassination is less likely.

Domestically, Kenshin left behind a succession crisis. While he never had any children of his own, Kenshin adopted two boys during his lifetime. His nephew, Uesugi Kagekatsu, was probably adopted to avoid antagonizing Kagekatsu&#x27;s father, Nagao Masakage, relatives and supporters. Another adopted son, Uesugi Kagetora, who was originally the son of Hōjō Ujiyasu, was adopted to secure Echigo&#x27;s borders. Some suppose that Kagekatsu was intended to be gradually set up as his heir, while others that Kenshin decided to divide the estates between the two.
Both sons had external blood ties, and reasonable claims. Kagetora was besieged at Otate in 1578, and although contacted for aid Hōjō Ujimasa and Takeda Katsuyori, the former backed down. Kagekatsu married Takeda&#x27;s sister, and eventually was able to secure his succession. Kagetora fled to a castle near the Echigo-Shinano border where he committed suicide in 1579.

The death caused local power struggles, with the result of almost decade long infighting in Echigo between 1578 and 1587, usually divided into the &quot;Otate Disturbance&quot; (1578–1582) and &quot;Shibata rebellion&quot; (1582–1587). The resistance of Kagetora&#x27;s supporters continued for a few years in north-central Echigo. In 1582, Shibata Shigeie, who was a vassal of Kagekatsu, led a rebellion in north Echigo, probably due to low rewards for his support of Kagekatsu, but even more due to Kagekatsu&#x27;s granting control over the toll barriers in the port of Niigata to Takemata Yoshitsuna.

However, in the aftermath of the costly internal struggle, the Oda clan exploited rebellions against Kagekatsu to advance right up to the border of Echigo, having captured Noto and Kaga while the Uesugi brothers were busy with the infighting. This combined with the destruction of the Takeda clan, Uesugi&#x27;s then ally and long time Oda enemy, would come close to destroying the Uesugi clan before Oda Nobunaga&#x27;s own death once again shattered the balance of power in Japan.

==Legacy==
Kenshin&#x27;s military success is related to his successful reform efforts on trade, market, transportation network (taxing mechanism in the port towns), and revenues generated by the cloth trade. The result was control over commerce which the previous government did not have. He also established feudal ties with the warrior population by land grants. The so-called &quot;Funai Statutes&quot; show the provisions that apply to the traditional elites and common folk, tax breaks due to war exhaustion, with intent to centralize and consolidate the lands around his capital, which were followed by further reforms for the consolidation of the imperial lands prior the 1560–1562 Kantō campaign. However, despite Kenshin&#x27;s control over agriculture and the economy, he did not thoroughly implement key reforms such as cadastral surveys, important for military obligations, implying Kenshin&#x27;s focus on commerce. The management of the administration, military organization, as well in some minor battles in Echigo Funai were handed by vassal Kurata Gorōzaemon. Kenshin is said to have been undefeated in over 50 open battles, hence being dubbed the “God of War” by his followers.

== Kenshin festivals ==

The Kenshin Festival takes place every August in Jōetsu since 1926. The procession starts at Kasugayama Castle for the reenactment of the fourth Kawanakajima battle, with an army of 400–1,000 soldiers. Japanese singer-songwriter Gackt portrayed Kenshin on several occasions since 2007, and thanks to his participation, the festival in 2015 reached record high attendance of 243,000 people.

The Echigo Kenshin Sake Festival is held every October and reaches attendance of roughly 100,000 visitors.

== In popular culture ==
Kenshin is the main protagonist of Chōgorō Kaionji&#x27;s epic historical novel &quot;Ten to Chi to&quot; (&quot;Heaven and Earth&quot;) and NHK taiga drama adaptation &quot;Ten to Chi to&quot; (1969) where was played by Kōji Ishizaka. Kenshin, played by Isao Natsuyagi is featured in 1979 film &quot;G.I. Samurai&quot;, and played by Eiichi Kanakubo is a minor character in Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s 1980 jidaigeki &quot;Kagemusha&quot;. The 1990 movie adaptation of Kaionji&#x27;s novel, &quot;Heaven and Earth&quot; directed by Haruki Kadokawa, where&#x27;s Kenshin played by Takaaki Enoki, covers the rivalry between Uesugi Kenshin and Takeda Shingen, focusing mainly on the character of Kenshin who is referred to by his original name Kagetora. The film has been praised for its realistic depictions of warfare and battles of the period. Being a box office success in Japan, it is also famous for holding the world record for most saddled horses used in one sequence — 800 horses were in a battle segment. Kaionji&#x27;s novel was also adapted by TV Asahi for their 50th anniversary as 2008 TV drama special where Kenshin was played by Masahiro Matsuoka. In the 2007 NHK taiga drama, &quot;Fūrin Kazan&quot;, Uesugi Kenshin is portrayed by Japanese singer-songwriter Gackt. Gackt recalls that Kenshin was always portrayed as a very tough man, but wanted to play him with the female myth in the mind, which presented him clean-shaven and with long hair, although received some harsh criticism, co-actor Ken Ogata expressed his approval of Gackt&#x27;s work and audience demanded the increase of his role in the series. The 2009 NHK Taiga drama &quot;Tenchijin&quot; partly re-tells the story of Uesugi Kenshin, played by Hiroshi Abe, although its main focus is on Naoe Kanetsugu, the page and later advisor to Uesugi Kenshin&#x27;s adopted son and heir Kagekatsu. Kenshin was again voiced by Gackt in the anime of the gag manga, &quot;Tono to Issho&quot; (2010–2011). The live-action drama &quot;Sengoku Basara: Moonlight Party&quot; cast actress Mayuko Arisue as Kenshin. Gackt participated in the production, but voiced Oda Nobunaga. In &quot;Cobra Kai&quot;, Season 5 episode 2, Terry Silver shows Chozen a samurai sword that he purchased at an auction, telling Chozen that it was used by Kenshin in the fourth battle of Kawanakajima.

The manga &quot;Yukibana no Tora&quot; by Akiko Higashimura, serialised in Shogakukan&#x27;s &quot;seinen&quot; manga magazine &quot;Hibana&quot; from March 2015 to August 2017, also portrays its main protagonist Kenshin as a woman. Tomeo Yagiri&#x27;s theory, known as the Female Uesugi Kenshin Theory, served as the basis for the portrayal of female versions of Kenshin in popular culture. Yagiri proposed that Kenshin was a woman, inspiring various adaptations and interpretations in media. Various fictional works have utilized the femininity theory, portraying Kenshin as female or featuring gender-neutral interpretations.

Kenshin has been featured in many video games, such as Koei&#x27;s &quot;Samurai Warriors&quot; and &quot;Warriors Orochi&quot; and Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Sengoku Basara&quot; series. He is a playable character in &quot;Pokémon Conquest&quot; (&quot;Pokémon + Nobunaga&#x27;s Ambition&quot; in Japan), where he is the warlord of Illusio with his partner Pokémon being Gallade and Mewtwo. Kenshin also appears in a gender bender parallel universe anime series &quot;Battle Girls: Time Paradox&quot;. A female Kenshin, as Nagao Kagetora, also appears in the mobile game &quot;Fate/Grand Order&quot;, voiced by actress and singer Nana Mizuki. Similarly appearing as a female character, Kenshin is found in the Rance series most notably in Sengoku Rance.

Kenshin was portrayed by Japanese figure skater and two-time Olympic champion Yuzuru Hanyu in his Olympic free skate program &quot;Heaven and Earth&quot; (天と地と), using the soundtrack of the two taiga dramas &quot;Ten to Chi to&quot; and &quot;Shin Heike Monogatari&quot;. Hanyu&#x27;s motivation behind the music choice was his strong resonance with Kenshin&#x27;s situation as well as his values and approach towards battle. The program was debuted in December 2020 at Big Hat arena in Nagano, near the historical location of the fourth Battle of Kawanakajima in 1961. It earned Hanyu two of his six titles at the Japan Figure Skating Championships, tying Takeshi Honda&#x27;s record of most national titles in 50 years.

<text>Ushuaia – Malvinas Argentinas International Airport (, ) is located south of the center of Ushuaia, a city on the island of Tierra del Fuego in the Tierra del Fuego Province of Argentina.

==Overview==

The airport was opened in 1995, replacing an older one, which is now in use with the Ushuaia Aeroclub . The new airport has been used by various airlines at different periods. It is the world&#x27;s southernmost international airport and is often used by passengers as a cruise-ship gateway to the Antarctic. 

Ushuaia International Airport can accommodate airplanes as large as the Boeing 747. Tower Air operated 747s into the airport, and Aerolíneas Argentinas operated 747-400s into the airport during events of high passenger numbers (such as entire cruise-ship passenger payloads) until retiring the 747 in February 2012. Two chartered Air France Concordes also visited in the past: F-BTSD arriving from Buenos Aires and continuing to Santiago, Chile, in early 1999; the second arriving from Easter Island, Chile and continuing to Buenos Aires prior to the cessation of most Concorde charter flights on 25 July 2000 (following the crash of Air France 4590). In the past, Condor, LTU, Air Berlin and Lufthansa also offered charter flights from Germany, Austrian Airlines from Austria, and XL Airways UK and First Choice Airways from the United Kingdom. It also chartered flights to Maputo, Mozambique.

The airport&#x27;s name reflects Argentina&#x27;s claims of sovereignty over the British Overseas Territory of the Falkland Islands.

The airport is on a peninsula extending south into the Beagle Channel, and all approaches and takeoffs are over the water.

<text>was a Japanese military commander, strategist, and politician of the Asuka period.

Some sources say he lived from c.575-664

==Biography==
Events in his life are accounted in the Nihon Shoki and Kojiki, both written several decades after his death. His father&#x27;s name and origin are unknown, as the written sources contradict one another, and may have been altered to glorify the genealogy of then-living clans.

After reaching adulthood, Abe was a governor of Koshi Province. In 658, he defeated the Mishihase in &quot;Watarishima&quot; (which may mean Tsugaru Peninsula or Hokkaido) at the request of the native inhabitants. His men continued to raid and plunder in Hokkaido and Okushiri Island until 660, bringing numerous trophies and prisoners to court. His trophies included at least 2 live bears, 70 bear hides, and 353 prisoners. In March 660, local allies asked for his military assistance at Ishikari River in Hokkaido, where he was victorious again.

In 662 his lord (soon to become the Emperor Tenji) assigned him and the captive prince Buyeo Pung to participate in an expedition to the Korean peninsula to restore the fallen allied kingdom of Baekje. Abe was assigned the command of the rear division out of three divisions available. His division was an entirely naval unit. He arrived on the continent in August 662 and was recalled after the defeat in the Battle of Baekgang in August 663.

&quot;Abe no Hirafu&quot; might be the ancestor of one or more of the Abe clans, as well as the Ando and Akita clans.

<doc id="352127" wikidata="Q318151" url="?curid=352127" title="Abe Isoo">
<text>was a Japanese Christian socialist, parliamentarian and pacifist. He largely contributed to development of baseball in Japan, and was called &quot;Father of Japanese baseball.&quot; He created a baseball club of Waseda University.

==Early life and education==
Abe was born in Fukuoka on 4 February 1865. He entered at Doshisha University in 1879, and got baptized by Joseph Hardy Neesima at February 2, 1882. In 1898, he created the first Consumers&#x27; co-operative of university in Japan at Doshisha. After he graduated from Doshissha, he studied abroad, including at the University of Berlin, before attending Hartford Theological Seminary in Hartford, Connecticut. It was while he was studying in Hartford that he became interested in socialism.

==Career==
After returning to Japan, in 1899, Abe became a Unitarian preacher. He taught at the Waseda University starting in 1901, called Tokyo Semmon Gakko, at the time. He later became a faculty of political science and economics and taught there for 25 years. He occupied some important positions in the university like a dean of first School of Political Science and Economics and University Vice President. In 1901 he helped to found the short-lived Japanese Social-Democratic party, which the government swiftly prohibited.

During the Russo-Japanese War, he advocated non-cooperation and participated in various early feminist movements. When the anti-war newspaper &quot;Heimin Shimbun&quot; (&quot;People&#x27;s Weekly News&quot;) was banned, he started his own magazine, &quot;Shinkigen&quot; (&quot;A New Era&quot;). He used this as a soapbox to promote parliamentary socialism. In 1906, he played an instrumental role in founding the first Japanese Socialist Party, from which he advocated a Christian Socialist viewpoint. However, the government outlawed this party too in 1907. He dropped out of public life until after World War I, when he became active again. He founded the Japanese Fabian Society, in 1921, and in 1924, he became their first President. He resigned his teaching post to become the secretary-general of the Social Democratic Party. In 1928, he was elected to the Japanese Diet, where he held a seat for five consecutive elections. In 1932, he became a chairman of Shakai Taishuto (Social Mass Party). He withdrew from politics in 1940 due to the increasingly militaristic nature of the government of the time.

==Father of Baseball in Japan==
Abe contributed to the development and spread of baseball in Japan because he believed that personality was built with sports like knowledge was built with learning. Becoming the first manager of Waseda Baseball Club in 1901, he started the Waseda–Keio rivalry. In 1905, during the Russo-Japanese War, he took the team to the United States and brought many techniques back to Japan, spreading them with his books. He also established the Japan Amateur Sports Association (later, Japan Sport Association) together with Jigoro Kano. He later helped with organizing the first Japanese Olympic team competing at the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm. In 1930, Abe became the first chairman of the Tokyo Big6 Baseball League. After World War II, he also became the first chairman of .

He is called the &#x27;Father of Baseball in Japan&#x27; or the &#x27;Father of Student Baseball&#x27; in Japan because of such contributions. Totsuka Ground, the main stadium of Waseda&#x27;s baseball team changed its name to Abe Ground in 1949, following Abe&#x27;s death. When the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame was opened in 1959, he was inducted into the hall.

<text>was a Japanese samurai of the Abe clan of Mikawa who served Tokugawa Ieyasu. The son of Abe Masanobu, Masakatsu served Ieyasu from a young age, first accompanying him to Sunpu as a hostage. In 1590, Ieyasu gave him Ichihara in Izu Province, and Hatogaya, in Musashi Province, which brought Masakatsu&#x27;s income to 5,000 koku. Masakatsu also received the honorary surname of Toyotomi from Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1594. Masakatsu died at Osaka in 1600; his successor, Abe Masatsugu, received an increase in stipend, making his inherited landholding at Hatogaya a han.

The portion of the river flowing between Nihonmatsu and Fukushima forms a deep ravine called . Crossing the northern edge of the long but low Abukuma hills, the Abukuma River then flows into Miyagi Prefecture, past the city of Kakuda and between Iwanuma and Watari before reaching the Pacific. Abukuma has a tributary called the Arakawa River.

<doc id="352143" wikidata="Q55403" url="?curid=352143" title="Nagisa Ōshima">
<text>was a Japanese filmmaker, writer, and left-wing activist who is best known for his fiction films, of which he directed 23 features in a career spanning from 1959 to 1999. He is regarded as one of the greatest Japanese directors of all time, and as one of the most important figures of the Japanese New Wave (Nūberu bāgu), alongside Shōhei Imamura. His film style was bold, innovative and provocative. Common themes in his work include youthful rebellion, class and racial discrimination and taboo sexuality.

His first major film was his second feature, &quot;Cruel Story of Youth&quot; (1960), one of the first Japanese New Wave films, a youth-oriented film with an earnest portrayal of the sexual lives and criminal activities of its young protagonists. And he came to greater international renown after &quot;Death By Hanging&quot; (1968), a film on the theme of capital punishment and anti-Korean sentiment, was shown at the Cannes Film Festival in 1968. His most controversial film is &quot;In the Realm of the Senses&quot; (1976), a sexually explicit film set in 1930s Japan.

==Profile==
===Early life===
Nagisa Ōshima was born into a family of aristocratic samurai roots. His father was a government official who had a large library. Ōshima spent very little time with his father, who died when he was six, which left a deep mark on him. Ōshima would point to this as the most important event of his childhood in his 1992 essay &quot;My Father&#x27;s Non-existence: A Determining Factor in My Existence&quot;. After graduating from Kyoto University in 1954, where he studied political history, Ōshima was hired by film production company Shochiku Ltd. and quickly progressed to directing his own movies, making his debut feature &quot;A Town of Love and Hope&quot; in 1959.

===During the 1960s===
Ōshima&#x27;s cinematic career and influence developed very swiftly, and such films as &quot;Cruel Story of Youth&quot;, &quot;The Sun&#x27;s Burial&quot; and &quot;Night and Fog in Japan&quot; followed in 1960. The last of these 1960 films explored Ōshima&#x27;s disillusionment with the traditional political left, and his frustrations with the right, and Shochiku withdrew the film from circulation after less than a week, claiming that, following the recent assassination of the Socialist Party leader Inejiro Asanuma by the ultranationalist Otoya Yamaguchi, there was a risk of &quot;unrest&quot;. Ōshima left the studio in response, and launched his own independent production company. Despite the controversy, &quot;Night and Fog in Japan&quot; placed tenth in that year&#x27;s &quot;Kinema Jumpo&quot; best-films poll of Japanese critics, and it has subsequently amassed considerable acclaim abroad.

In 1961 Ōshima directed &quot;The Catch&quot;, based on a novella by Kenzaburō Ōe about the relationship between a wartime Japanese village and a captured African American serviceman. &quot;The Catch&quot; has not traditionally been viewed as one of Ōshima major works, though it did notably introduce a thematic exploration of bigotry and xenophobia, themes which would be explored in greater depth in the later documentary &quot;Diary of Yunbogi&quot;, and feature films &quot;Death by Hanging&quot; and &quot;Three Resurrected Drunkards&quot;. He embarked upon a period of work in television, producing a series of documentaries; notably among them 1965&#x27;s &quot;Diary Of Yunbogi&quot;. Based upon an examination of the lives of street children in Seoul, it was made by Ōshima after a trip to South Korea.

Ōshima directed three features in 1968. The first of these - &quot;Death by Hanging&quot; (1968) presented the story of the failed execution of a young Korean for rape and murder, and was loosely based upon an actual crime and execution which had taken place in 1958. The film utilizes non-realistic &quot;distancing&quot; techniques after the fashion of Bertold Brecht or Jean-Luc Godard to examine Japan&#x27;s record of racial discrimination against its Korean minority, incorporating elements of farce and political satire, and a number of visual techniques associated with the cinematic new wave in a densely layered narrative. It was placed third in &quot;Kinema Jumpo&quot; 1968 poll, and has also garnered significant attention globally. &quot;Death By Hanging&quot; inaugurated a string of films (continuing through 1976&#x27;s &quot;In the Realm of the Senses&quot;) that clarified a number of Ōshima&#x27;s key themes, most notably a need to question social constraints, and to similarly deconstruct received political doctrines.

Months later, &quot;Diary of a Shinjuku Thief&quot; unites a number of Ōshima&#x27;s thematic concerns within a dense, collage-style presentation. Featuring a title which alludes to Jean Genet&#x27;s &quot;The Thief&#x27;s Journal&quot;, the film explores the links between sexual and political radicalism, specifically examining the day-to-day life of a would-be radical whose sexual desires take the form of kleptomania. The fragmented narrative is interrupted by commentators, including Kara Jūrō&#x27;s underground performance troupe, starring Kara Jūrō, his then wife Ri Reisen, and Maro Akaji (who would go on to lead the butoh troupe Dairakudakan). Yokoo Tadanori, an artist who created many of the iconic theatre posters during the 1960s and &#x27;70s, plays the thief, who gets a bit part in Kara&#x27;s performance. The film also features a psychoanalyst, the president of Kinokuniya Bookstore in Shinjuku, and an impromptu symposium featuring actors from previous Ōshima films (along with Ōshima himself), all dissecting varied aspects of shifting sexual politics, as embodied by various characters within the film.

&quot;Boy&quot; (1969), based on another real-life case, was the story of a family who use their child to make money by deliberately getting involved in road accidents and making the drivers pay compensation.

===1970s career===
&quot;The Ceremony&quot; (1971) is a satirical film on traditional Japanese attitudes, famously expressed in a scene where a marriage ceremony has to go ahead even though the bride is not present.

In 1976, Ōshima made &quot;In the Realm of the Senses&quot;, a film based on a true story of fatal sexual obsession in 1930s Japan. Ōshima, a critic of censorship and his contemporary Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s humanism, was determined that the film should feature unsimulated sex and thus the undeveloped film had to be transported to France to be processed. An uncensored version of the movie is still unavailable in Japan. A book with stills and script notes from the film was published by San’ichishobo, and in 1976 the Japanese government brought obscenity charges against Ōshima and San’ichishobo. Ōshima testified in the trial and said. &quot;Nothing that is expressed is obscene. What is obscene is what is hidden.&quot; Ōshima and the publisher were found not guilty in 1979; the government appealed and the Tokyo High Court upheld the verdict in 1982.

In his 1978 companion film to &quot;In the Realm of the Senses&quot;, &quot;Empire of Passion&quot;, Ōshima took a more restrained approach to depicting the sexual passions of the two lovers driven to murder, and the film won the 1978 Cannes Film Festival award for best director.

===1980s onwards===
In 1983 Ōshima had a critical success with &quot;Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence&quot;, a film partly in English and set in a wartime Japanese prison camp, and featuring rock star David Bowie and musician Ryuichi Sakamoto, alongside Takeshi Kitano. The movie is sometimes viewed as a minor classic but never found a mainstream audience. &quot;Max, Mon Amour&quot; (1986), written with Luis Buñuel&#x27;s frequent collaborator Jean-Claude Carrière, was a comedy about a diplomat&#x27;s wife (Charlotte Rampling) whose love affair with a chimpanzee is quietly incorporated into an eminently civilised &quot;ménage à trois&quot;.

For much of the 1980s and 1990s, he served as president of the Directors Guild of Japan. He won the inaugural Directors Guild of Japan New Directors Award in 1960.

A collection of Ōshima&#x27;s essays and articles was published in English in 1993 as &quot;Cinema, Censorship and the State&quot;. In 1995 he wrote and directed the archival documentary &#x27;100 Years of Japanese Cinema&#x27; for the British Film Institute. A critical study by Maureen Turim appeared in 1998.

In 1996 Ōshima suffered a stroke, but he recovered enough to return to directing in 1999 with the samurai film &quot;Taboo&quot; (&quot;Gohatto&quot;), set during the bakumatsu era and starring &quot;Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence&quot; actor Takeshi Kitano. Ryuichi Sakamoto, who had both acted in and composed for &quot;Lawrence&quot;, provided the score.

He subsequently suffered more strokes, and &quot;Gohatto&quot; proved to be his final film. Ōshima had initially planned to create a biopic entitled &quot;Hollywood Zen&quot; based on the life of Issei actor Sessue Hayakawa. The script had been allegedly completed and set to film in Los Angeles, but due to constant delays, declining health, and Ōshima&#x27;s eventual death in 2013 (see below), the project went unrealized.
Having a degree of fluency in English, in the 2000s, Ōshima worked as a translator. He translated four books by John Gray into Japanese, including &quot;Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus&quot;.

Ōshima died on January 15, 2013, of pneumonia. He was 80.

The 2013 edition of the San Sebastian Film Festival scheduled a retrospective of Ōshima films in September.

==Awards==



==Style==
Nagisa Oshima was known for the protean nature of his work. From one film to the next, he would frequently shuffle between black-and-white and color, between academy ratio and widescreen, between long takes and fragmented cutting, and between formally composed images and a cinéma vérité style.

In multiple interviews, Oshima has named Luis Buñuel as a director he profoundly admires. The influence of Buñuel&#x27;s work can be seen as early as in The Sun&#x27;s Burial (1960), which was possibly inspired by Los Olvidados, and as late as in Max, Mon Amour (1986), for which Oshima worked with Jean-Claude Carrière, a frequent collaborator of Buñuel&#x27;s.

<doc id="352144" wikidata="Q736738" url="?curid=352144" title="Ma Su">
<text>Ma Su (190–228), courtesy name Youchang, was a Chinese military general and politician of the state of Shu Han in the Three Kingdoms period of China. Ma Su had conspicuous talent in military theories and was admired by the Shu chancellor Zhuge Liang. However, a tactical blunder by Ma Su at the Battle of Jieting resulted in Shu being dealt a huge defeat by Zhang He, a general of the rival state of Wei. He was a younger brother of Ma Liang.

Much dramatisation shrouds the death of Ma Su. According to the biography of Ma Su&#x27;s close friend Xiang Lang, Ma Su was said to have attempted to flee with no further information if it was after or during his defeat at Jieting, but was captured. Following this, he was executed on Zhuge Liang&#x27;s order and seemed to have face death with dignity. Most cultural depictions concentrate on the latter part, such as the historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; as well as the Peking opera &quot;Loss of Jieting&quot;.

==Early life==
Ma Su was born in Yicheng, Xiangyang Commandery, which is present-day Yicheng, Hubei. He was one of the five brothers in the Ma family, all of whom were renowned for their intellects and commonly known as the &quot;Five Changs&quot; (五常) as their style names all contained &quot;Chang&quot; (常). Although, Ma Su&#x27;s elder brother Ma Liang was deemed to be the most talented among them all. Aside from his personal talent and military knowledge, Ma Su was described as a man about eight &quot;chi&quot; tall (approximately 1.84 metres), sociable and good at making friends. With a bright mind and deep expertise.

Together with Ma Liang, Ma Su began his service as an Assistant Officer (從事) under Liu Bei around 209, when Liu Bei succeeded Liu Qi as Governor of Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan). In 211, he accompanied Liu Bei into Yi Province. Later, when conflict broke out between Liu Bei and Liu Zhang, Ma Su followed him with the army and served as a military advisor alongside Pang Tong and Fa Zheng. He was appointed as Prefect (令) of Mianzhu (綿竹) and Chengdu (成都). Thereafter, Ma Su was transferred to serve as Administrator of Yuexi (越嶲太守), a troubled commandery in the south. Yuexi was home to numerous indigenous tribes, many of whom refused to accept Liu Bei’s authority. It was the site of a significant tribal revolt led by Gao Ding (高定), the chief of the Sou tribe (叟族) in 218 that was successfully quelled with help from Li Yan.

As Ma Su had talent and ability that surpassed others and enjoyed discussing planning and strategy. Liu Bei&#x27;s chief advisor, Zhuge Liang had been impressed by him and praised him as an exceptional individual. However, before Liu Bei died in 223, he warned Zhuge Liang that Ma Su&#x27;s knowledge and speech exceed his real abilities and should not be given important appointments. Still, Zhuge Liang did not heed the warning, and Ma Su was made a personal military Advisor (參軍) soon after Liu Bei&#x27;s death. The two were very close and would often hold discussions from dawn to dusk.

==Southern Campaign==
During the campaign against Meng Huo, Ma Su went several tens of &quot;li&quot; to see Zhuge Liang off. Zhuge Liang told Ma Su: &quot;It&#x27;s been years since we strategized together, now I ask for your help with your wise and skilled planning.&quot;

Ma Su answered to Zhuge Liang as such: &quot;Nanzhong relies on the distance from the capital and its difficult access, and it never submits for long. If we defeat them and leave, tomorrow they would rebel again. Now that you lord are about to engage the whole state and army for a Northern Expedition against the powerful rebels. When the south learn that the authority of the government is weak then they will immediately rebel again. However, if all the tribes with their kinds are exterminated to end future worries then that would be inhumane as this is not the way of the benevolent man. Moreover, it would be a long affair. I learned that, in the way of using troops &quot;attacking the heart is the wisest, attacking the city is worst. Psychological warfare is best, armed warfare is the worst.&quot; Therefore, I hope that you my lord will focus on subduing their hearts.”

Zhuge Liang followed Ma Su&#x27;s advice, many times he forgave Meng Huo in order to gain the trust of the people of the South. Hence, until the end of Zhuge Liang’s life, the South did not rebel again.

==Performance in Jieting==
In 228, Zhuge Liang launched his Northern Expeditions against Wei, at the time there were veteran leaders such as Wei Yan and Wu Yi. Among the army, many advisors suggested appointing either one of them as the vanguard commander however Zhuge Liang disagreed with the majority and chose Ma Su to command the army at the front instead.

Ma Su&#x27;s forces encountered Zhang He&#x27;s forces at Jieting. It was here that Ma Su made a serious tactical blunder. He disobeyed Zhuge Liang&#x27;s order to garrison his army inside the city of Jieting and had his troops camped on top of a hill, believing the vantage point would provide him with a more advantageous position in terms of observation and a place of attack. His subordinate Wang Ping advised against Ma Su&#x27;s decision, arguing that their water supply might be cut off and their forces surrounded. While his good counsel was rejected, Ma Su allowed Wang Ping to take 1,000 men and camp nearby the Shu forces in support.

As Wang Ping predicted, Zhang He took advantage of Ma Su&#x27;s mistake by striking at the Shu camp&#x27;s water supply. He succeeded in cutting off the enemy&#x27;s water supply. The parched soldiers of Shu were easily defeated when Zhang He launched an offensive on the main camp itself. Wang Ping, with only a handful of soldiers, did his best to keep the retreat organized and ordered his soldiers to beat their drums loudly to create the impression that reinforcements had arrived. Zhang He believed this to be an ambush and did not pursue. When Zhuge Liang arrived, he could not force Zhang He from his position and retreated to Hanzhong.

==Records on Ma Su&#x27;s death==

According to a record from the biography of Xiang Lang in &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;, Xiang, as a close friend of Ma Su, didn&#x27;t report him when he fled though the record makes no statement if it was during or after the battle.

Although he survived the battle, Ma Su&#x27;s army suffered a heavy defeat (Wang Ping was able to regroup the scattered forces), so he was soon arrested and sentenced to execution by a reluctant and tearful Zhuge Liang as a way to soothe the troops. Before his execution, Ma Su wrote a letter to Zhuge Liang: &quot;You wise lord regarded me like a son and myself looked upon you as a father. I dearly hope that this is the righteousness of the execution of Gun leading to the rise of Yu the Great. May our whole life&#x27;s relationship not be reduced by this. Though I shall die, I shall bear no resentments against the yellow earth.&quot; At the time, many among the army wept for his death.

When Jiang Wan later visited Hanzhong, he spoke with Zhuge Liang on this matter: &quot;In the past, when the State of Chu killed Cheng Dechen then the joy of the Duke Wen of Jin was great. Today, the Empire has yet to be unified, however you put a man who is a knowledgeable strategist to death. Is it not regretful?&quot; Zhuge Liang, in tears, answered: &quot;The reason why Sun Tzu was able to dominate through the empire was that he was clear in his application of the laws. Thus, it was because Yang Gan (楊干) had brought confusion to laws that Wei Jiang (魏絳) put his charioteer to death. Now that the Empire is still divided and war has just begun. If we again abandon the laws, then by what means shall we quell the rebels?&quot;

Xi Zuochi harshly criticized Zhuge Liang for Ma Su&#x27;s execution. Xi wrote: &quot;Wasn&#x27;t it appropriate that Zhuge Liang failed to unify the realm? When Xun Linfu (荀林父) was defeated by the army of Chu, the Duke of Jin refused to execute him, knowing his latter success would allow him to win the war. While, when the King Cheng of Chu executed Cheng Dechen ignorant of all he was doing for his country and therefore brought his own defeat. Now, Shu is situated in a remote location with less population and talent than the central plains. Yet, they executed their outstanding men and have to fall back and employed lesser men. To be so severe with the talented and not apply the &quot;principle of three defeats&quot; while wanting to realize great enterprises: isn&#x27;t that difficult? Moreover, Liu Bei warned him that Ma Su shouldn&#x27;t be employed in important matters. Why choose Ma Su rather than someone else? Zhuge Liang heard his warning but didn&#x27;t follow it. Surely, he wasn&#x27;t able to refuse Ma Su. However, Zhuge Liang was the chief minister of his empire and wanted to gather more resources. Yet, he didn&#x27;t evaluate the ability of each to make the correct appointment and assigned people according to their talent. His judgement was wrong and he ignored his lord&#x27;s brilliant advice. Hence, he failed and killed a man who had something to offer. After this, it seems hard to include him when speaking of the wise.&quot;

Li Sheng (李盛) and Zhang Xiu (張休) were also put to death with Ma Su. Huang Xi (黃襲) along with others were relieved of the command of their soldiers. Wang Ping, on the other hand, was promoted to General Who Attacks Bandits (討寇將軍) for his efforts in minimizing casualties and for trying to prevent Ma Su&#x27;s actions. Zhuge Liang sent a memorial to the Emperor Liu Shan requesting to be demoted for the defeat at Jieting which he was.

Regardless, Ma Su was deemed by Zhuge Liang and later by Liu Shan in an imperial memorial following the Battle of Jianwei to hold major responsibility for the failure of the first Northern Expedition. However, Ma Su&#x27;s wife and children were well taken care of by Zhuge Liang after Ma Su&#x27;s death. Zhuge Liang also personally offered sacrifice at Ma Su&#x27;s grave.

<doc id="352146" wikidata="Q213667" url="?curid=352146" title="Kazimierz Fajans">
<text>Kazimierz Fajans (Kasimir Fajans in many American publications; 27 May 1887 – 18 May 1975) was a Polish-American physical chemist, a pioneer in the science of radioactivity and the co-discoverer of chemical element protactinium.

==Education and career==
Fajans was born May 27, 1887, in Warsaw, Congress Poland, to a family of Jewish background. After he had completed secondary school in Warsaw (1904), he studied chemistry in Germany, first at the University in Leipzig, and then in Heidelberg and Zürich. In 1909 he was awarded his PhD for research into the stereoselective synthesis of chiral compounds.

In 1910 Fajans took a job at the laboratory of Ernest Rutherford in Manchester, where the nucleus was discovered. He then returned to Germany, where he became an assistant and subsequently assistant professor at the Technical University of Karlsruhe, researching radioactivity. In 1917 he headed the Faculty of Physical Chemistry at Munich University, and in 1932 became the Head of the Institute of Physical Chemistry established by the Rockefeller Foundation. In 1935 he left Germany due to escalating Nazi persecution. He stayed for a while in Cambridge and then moved to the University of Michigan where he worked until his demise. In 1959 he became an honorary member of the Polish Chemical Society.

Fajans retired at age of seventy but never stopped working. He died May 18, 1975, in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

==Scientific work==
Fajans worked with Henry G. Moseley at the laboratory of Ernest Rutherford researching properties of the radioactive rows of the periodic table. He identified the half-lives of the uranium-actinium row and thorium nuclides. 
He discovered the phenomenon of the electrochemical branching of the radioactive rows. Afterwards Fajans worked on the electrochemical properties of elements as a result of the radioactive changes, and he formulated the law of the radioactive shifts which was later named the radioactive displacement law of Fajans and Soddy (Frederick Soddy received the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1921 for his isotopic research). In 1913, together with Oswald Helmuth Göhring, he discovered the first radionuclide of a new element, which was later named protactinium. Fajans and Otto Hahn discovered the formula that defined the conditions of precipitation and absorption of radioactive substances. It is very significant for separation and purification of radioactive substances found in the smallest number.

In 1919, Fajans began researching the structure of crystals by thermochemical and refractometric methods. The co-relation of Born, Fajans and Haber is a basic thermochemical rule. On the basis of his research data Fajans formulated the essential relationships concerning chemical bond strength and deformation of ions and particles, such as heat of ion hydration, refractive index and the heat of sublimation. In 1923 he formulated Fajans&#x27; rules of inorganic chemistry, which are used to predict whether a chemical bond will be covalent or ionic.

In the United States he researched nuclear reactions using a cyclotron and discovered a radioactive lead isotope with Voigt, and a new rhenium isotope with Sullivan. He was a member of the Polish Institute of Arts and Sciences in America and of many societies and academies.

<doc id="352148" wikidata="Q1050942" url="?curid=352148" title="Northern Fujiwara">
<text>The Northern Fujiwara (奥州藤原氏 &quot;Ōshū Fujiwara-shi&quot;) were a Japanese noble family that ruled the Tōhoku region (the northeast of Honshū) of Japan during the 12th century as their own realm.

They succeeded the semi-independent Emishi families of the 11th century, who were gradually brought down by the Minamoto clan loyal to the Imperial Court in Kyoto. They ruled over an independent region that derived its wealth from gold mining, horse-trading and as middlemen in the trade in luxury items from continental Asian states and from the far northern Emishi and Ainu people. They were able to keep their independence vis-a-vis Kyoto by the strength of their warrior bands until they were ultimately conquered by the Kantō samurai clans led by Minamoto no Yoritomo, in the Battle of Ōshū in 1189.

== Origins ==
Historically, there has been a theory that the Northern Fujiwara descended from the ethnic Emishi people, but in terms of genealogy, they were descended from Fujiwara no Hidesato.

Fujiwara no Kiyohira, after his father&#x27;s death, was raised as a member of the Kiyohara clan as his mother remarried into a Kiyohara family in Dewa Province. However, Kiyohira, with the aid of Minamoto no Yoshiie, became independent and established themselves in Hiraizumi (in present-day Iwate Prefecture) in 1087, when he won the victory in the Gosannen War.

== History ==
After its foundation by Fujiwara no Kiyohira in 1087, the Northern Fujiwara clan ruled the Mutsu and Dewa Province for over a century.

Along with Kiyohira, the next two generations of Fujiwara no Motohira and Hidehira saw the zenith of Northern Fujiwara&#x27;s power in the Tōhoku region. At the zenith of their rule, they attracted a number of artisans from imperial capital Kyoto and created a capital city, Hiraizumi. They introduced the Kyoto and Heian culture into the area and built many temples, such as the Chūson-ji founded in 1095.

During the Genpei War (1180-1185), fought between the Minamoto clan and the Taira clan, the Northern Fujiwara remained neutral.

A conflict erupted between lord Minamoto no Yoritomo and the Northern Fujiwara clan over the extradition of Minamoto no Yoshitsune, younger brother and former general of Yoritomo, who had fled to Hiraizumi. Hidehira had remained neutral during the Genpei War, but when Yoshitsune took refuge in Hiraizumi, he decided to protect him.

Hidehira, who had protected Yoshitsune, soon died and his son Fujiwara no Yasuhira succeeded his father as the 4th head of the Northern Fujiwara clan. Yasuhira failed to resist Minamoto no Yoritomo&#x27;s pressure, and had Yoshitsune assassinated. After Yoshitsune was assassinated in April 1189, his severed head was delivered to Kamakura by July for Yoritomo to see. However, Yoritomo was already set on attacking Hiraizumi and this did nothing to repair their damaged relations.

On September 1, 1189, 284,000 cavalrymen led by Yoritomo set out to attack Hiraizumi. Yasuhira prepared himself an army of 170,000 cavalrymen to defend his realm. Thus, the Battle of Ōshū began.

Yasuhira&#x27;s forces were defeated one after another, and on October 2, he fled Hiraizumi leaving it afire. Yoritomo entered Hiraizumi the next day. Yasuhira was found and killed in Nienosaku, Hinai, Mutsu Province (present-day Ōdate, Akita Prefecture) on October 14.

The Battle of Ōshū resulted in the destruction of the Northern Fujiwara clan. This marked the end of the tumultuous period of civil war that began in 1180, and the completion of Yoritomo&#x27;s nationwide domination and the establishment of the Kamakura shogunate.

<doc id="352149" wikidata="Q1154295" url="?curid=352149" title="Oath of the Peach Garden">
<text>The Oath of the Peach Garden is a fictional event in the 14th century Chinese historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; by Luo Guanzhong. This event is set at the end of the Eastern Han dynasty around the time of the Yellow Turban Rebellion in the 180s A.D. Liu Bei, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei took an oath of fraternity in a ceremony in the Peach Garden (believed to be in present-day Zhuozhou, Hebei), and became sworn brothers from then on. Their goal in taking the oath was to protect the Han Empire from the Yellow Turban rebels. The oath bound the three men, who would later play important roles in the establishment of the state of Shu Han during the Three Kingdoms period. It is also often alluded to as a symbol of fraternal loyalty.

==Historicity==
There is no mention of the three men becoming sworn brothers in Chen Shou&#x27;s &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, the authoritative source for the history of the late Eastern Han dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period. However, in Guan Yu&#x27;s biography, their relationship was described to be &quot;as close as brothers&quot;, to the point of &quot;sharing the same bed&quot;. Zhang Fei&#x27;s biography also mentioned that Guan Yu was older than Zhang Fei, so Zhang regarded Guan as an elder brother.

==Early accounts of the oath trope ==
Like many fictitious events in &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, the Oath of the Peach Garden was developed based on folk tales from earlier generations. He Jing in the early Yuan dynasty wrote the &quot;Inscription of the Temple of Prince Yiyong Wu&#x27;an of Han&quot;, which consisted of the statement &quot;The Prince (Guan Yu) were friends with General of Chariots and Cavalry [Zhang] Fei and Zhaolie (Emperor, Liu Bei), vowing to be brothers&quot;. An opera titled &quot;Liu, Guan, Zhang&#x27;s Oath of the Peach Garden&quot; and a novella titled &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms in Plain Language&quot;, both written in Yuan dynasty, provided different accounts of the three men becoming sworn brothers. In &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms in Plain Language&quot;, Zhang Fei first met Guan Yu in Zhuo County and appreciated his outstanding appearance, so he invited him to a drink. There Liu Bei encountered them and respected their extraordinary appearances and physiques. The three men went to drink together at Zhang Fei&#x27;s peach garden and swore to become brothers, before Liu Bei expressed his lofty aim to save the nation.

== In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; ==

=== Background ===
Chapter 1 of &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; sets out the story of the Ten Attendants&#x27; usurpation of power and the Yellow Turban Rebellion, which destabilised the Han Empire. When the Yellow Turban rebels were advancing on You Province, the governor posted a conscription notice in Zhuo County. Seeing the notice, Liu Bei, a 28-year-old distant descendant of the empire&#x27;s ruling house, let out a long sigh. He was scolded by Zhang Fei, who worked as a butcher, for not serving the country. Liu Bei then shared his aspirations of saving the country and the people, and Zhang Fei suggested they should together recruit a voluntary militia to combat the Yellow Turbans. While drinking at a restaurant, they met Guan Yu, who was on his way to join the army. Liu Bei told him about their plan and the three men went to Zhang Fei&#x27;s home to discuss. Zhang Fei suggested they should conduct a sacrificial ceremony to heaven and earth and take the oath as brothers under blossoming peach trees in his garden, to which Liu Bei and Guan Yu agreed.

=== The oath ===
The oath, as it appears in the Wikisource translation of Chapter 1 of &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, was this:

When saying the names Liu Bei, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei, although the surnames are different, yet we have come together as brothers. From this day forward, we shall join forces for a common purpose: to save the troubled and to aid the endangered. We shall avenge the nation above, and pacify the citizenry below. We seek not to be born on the same day, in the same month and in the same year. We merely hope to die on the same day, in the same month and in the same year. May the Gods of Heaven and Earth attest to what is in our hearts. If we should ever do anything to betray our friendship, may heaven and the people of the earth both strike us dead.
In many other translations, only the section dealing with &quot;dying on the same day&quot; is present.

=== After the oath ===
After the oath, Liu Bei was declared the eldest brother, followed by Guan Yu and Zhang Fei as the most junior. Liu Bei ordered the craftsman to forge a pair of swords, Guan Yu the Green Dragon Crescent Blade and Zhang Fei a 1.8-&quot;zhang&quot; Snake Lance. They recruited 500 volunteers to fight under the governor&#x27;s command and repelled the advancing rebels, in what became the first battle of the brothers&#x27; long journey to pacify the nation.

In spite of their oath, the three brothers did not die on the same day. Guan Yu was killed by Sun Quan&#x27;s forces in 220. When Liu Bei ascended to the throne to restore the house of Han, his first edict was to wage war on Sun Quan to avenge Guan Yu. Zhang Fei was saddened by Guan Yu&#x27;s death and often tortured his subordinates to vent his anger; he was finally assassinated by his subordinates in 221, right before the eastern expedition. Liu Bei died of illness in 223, a year after his disastrous defeat at the Battle of Xiaoting.

When the Shu Han forces were summoned, Guan Yu&#x27;s son Guan Xing and Zhang Fei&#x27;s son Zhang Bao competed to lead the vanguard force, and even challenged each other to a duel. Liu Bei berated them for forgetting their late fathers&#x27; fraternity. On Liu Bei&#x27;s order, Guan Xing and Zhang Bao became oath brothers too.

==Cultural influence==

Temples known as &quot;Sanyi Temples&quot; (literally Temples of the Three Righteous) are dedicated to the three oath brothers. They can be found in many places such as Zhuozhou, where Liu Bei was from and the oath fictitiously took place, and Chengdu, the capital of Shu Han.

Some operas and critics narrating the Three Kingdoms call Zhao Yun the fourth brother, but this is a secondary creation rather than a creation by Luo Guanzhong. In Chapter 73 of &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, when created the first among the Five Tiger Generals, Guan Yu commented that Zhao Yun &quot;has been a longtime follower of my elder brother, and is like my younger brother&quot;. This cannot be interpreted as Zhao Yun having taken an oath of fraternity.

The oath also inspired the present-day secret societies in Chinese communities, such as the triads, to use a similar ritual when swearing in new members. &quot;Though not born on the same day of the same month in the same year, we hope to die so&quot;—the phrase the three brothers made during the oath—had also become popular among present-day secret society members.

A &quot;&quot; team comprising Reid Duke, William Jensen and Owen Turtenwald is named &quot;Peach Garden Oath&quot; after the Oath of the Peach Garden.

In 1600 at the Battle of Sekigahara, he was under Ōtani Yoshitsugu, who led part of Ishida Mitsunari&#x27;s force. However, taking advantage of Kobayakawa Hideaki&#x27;s betrayal, he switched sides with Wakisaka Yasuharu, Kutsuki Mototsuna, and Ogawa Suketada. Together, they defeated Yoshitsugu&#x27;s force. After the battle, Tokugawa Ieyasu did not give Naoyasu credit and seized his domain. Because of that, Naoyasu became a retainer of Maeda Toshinaga, and was given a stipend of 7,000 koku.
==Death==
In 1606, looking over flooded Daimon River, in Etchū Province, he fell off a horse and died by drowning. Naoyasu was succeeded by his son, . Takaharu changed his family name to , and became a retainer of the Maeda clan of Kaga. The family remained retainers of the Maeda until the Meiji Restoration.

<text>A sibling is a relative that shares at least one parent with the other person. A male sibling is a brother, and a female sibling is a sister. A person with no siblings is an only child.

While some circumstances can cause siblings to be raised separately (such as foster care or adoption), most societies have siblings grow up together. This causes the development of strong emotional bonds, with siblinghood considered a unique type of relationship. The emotional bond between siblings is often complicated and is influenced by factors such as parental treatment, birth order, personality, and personal experiences outside the family.

Medically, a full-sibling is a first-degree relative and a half-sibling is a second-degree relative as they are related by 50% and 25%, respectively.

==Definitions==

The word &quot;sibling&quot; was reintroduced in 1903 in an article in &quot;Biometrika&quot;, as a translation for the German &quot;Geschwister&quot;, having not been used since Middle English, specifically 1425.

Siblings or full-siblings ([&quot;full&quot;] &quot;sisters&quot; or &quot;brothers&quot;) share the same biological parents. Full-siblings are also the most common type of siblings. Twins are siblings that are born from the same pregnancy. Often, twins with a close relationship will develop a twin language from infanthood, a language only shared and understood between the two. Studies corroborate that identical twins appear to display more twin talk than fraternal twins. At about 3, twin talk usually ends. Twins generally share a greater bond due to growing up together and being the same age.

Half-siblings (half-sisters or half-brothers) are people who share one parent. They may share the same mother but different fathers (in which case they are known as &quot;uterine&quot; siblings or &quot;maternal half-siblings&quot;), or they may have the same father but different mothers (in which case, they are known as &quot;agnate&quot; siblings or &quot;paternal half-siblings&quot;. In law, the term &quot;consanguine&quot; is used in place of agnate). In law (and especially inheritance law), half-siblings have often been accorded treatment unequal to that of full-siblings. Old English common law at one time incorporated inequalities into the laws of intestate succession, with half-siblings taking only half as much property of their intestate siblings&#x27; estates as siblings of full-blood. Unequal treatment of this type has been wholly abolished in England, but still exists in Florida.

Three-quarter siblings share one parent, while the unshared parents are first-degree relatives to each other, for example, if a man has children with two women who are sisters, or a woman has children with a man and his son. In the first case, the children are half-siblings as well as first cousins; in the second, the children are half-siblings as well as an avuncular pair. They are genetically closer than half-siblings but less genetically close than full-siblings, a degree of genetic relationship that is rare in humans and little-studied. One notable example of three-quarter siblings is the family of American aviator Charles Lindbergh, who fathered children with two German sisters, Brigitte and Marietta Hesshaimer.

Diblings, a portmanteau of donor sibling, or donor-conceived sibling, or donor-sperm sibling, are biologically connected through donated eggs or sperm. Diblings are biologically siblings though not legally for the purposes of family rights and inheritance. The anonymity of donation is seen to add complication to the process of courtship.

===Non-blood relations===
Related through affinity:
* Stepsiblings (stepbrothers or stepsisters) are the children of one&#x27;s stepparent from a previous relationship.
* Adoptive siblings are raised by a person who is the adoptive parent of one and the adoptive or biological parent of the other. 
* Siblings-in-law are the siblings of one&#x27;s spouse, the spouse of one&#x27;s sibling, or the spouse of one&#x27;s spouse&#x27;s sibling. The spouse of one&#x27;s spouse&#x27;s sibling may also be called a co-sibling.

Not related:
* siblings are children who are raised in the same foster home: foster children of one&#x27;s parent(s), or the children or foster children of one&#x27;s foster parent.
* God siblings are the children of the godfather or godmother or the godchildren of the father or mother.
* Milk siblings are children who have been nursed by the same woman. This relationship exists in cultures with milk kinship and in Islamic law.
* Cross-siblings are individuals who share one or more half-siblings; if one person has at least one maternal half-sibling and at least one paternal half-sibling, the maternal and paternal half-siblings are cross-siblings to each other.


==Consanguinity and genetics==
Consanguinity is the measure of how closely people are related. Genetic relatedness measures how many genes a person shares. As all humans share over 99% of the same genes, consanguinity only matters for the small fraction of genes which vary between different people. Inheritance of genes has a random element to it, and these two concepts are different. Consanguinity decreases by half for every generation of reproductive separation through their most recent common ancestor. Siblings are 50% related by consanguinity as they are separated from each other by two generation (sibling to parent to sibling), and they share two parents as common ancestors (formula_1).

A fraternal twin is a sibling and, therefore, is related by 50% consanguinity. Fraternal twins are no more genetically similar than regular siblings. As identical twins come from the same zygote, their most recent common ancestor is each other. They’re genetically identical and 100% consanguineous as they’re separated by zero generations (formula_2). Twin studies have been conducted by scientists to examine the roles that genetics and environment play in the development of various traits. Such studies examine how often identical twins possess the same behavioral trait and compare it to how often fraternal twins possess the same trait. In other studies twins are raised in separate families, and studies compare the passing on of a behavioral trait by the family environment and the possession of a common trait between identical twins. This kind of study has revealed that for personality traits which are known to be heritable, genetics play a substantial role throughout life and an even larger role during early years.

Half-siblings are 25% related by consanguinity as they share one parent and separated from each other by two generations (formula_3).

A person may share more than the standard consanguinity with their sibling if their parents are related (the coefficient of inbreeding is greater than zero). Interestingly, half-siblings can be related by as &quot;three-quarters siblings&quot; (related by 3/8) if their unshared parents have a consanguinity of 50%. This means the unshared parents are either siblings, making the half-siblings cousins, or parent and child, making them half- aunt-uncle and niece-nephew.

===Percentage distribution===
In practice, full siblings do not share exactly 50% of their DNA, as chromosomal crossover only occurs a limited number of times and, therefore, large chunks of a chromosome are shared or not shared at one time. In fact, the mean DNA fraction shared is 50.28% with a standard deviation of 3.68%, meaning approximately 1/4 of sibling pairs share more than 52.76% of their DNA, while 1/4 share less than 47.8%.

There is a very small chance that two half-siblings might not share any genes if they didn&#x27;t inherit any of the same chromosomes from their shared parent. This is possible for full-siblings as well, though even more unlikely. But because of how homologous chromosomes swap genes (due to chromosomal crossover during meiosis) during the development of an egg or sperm cell, however, the odds of this ever actually occurring are practically non-existent.

==Birth order==


Birth order is a person&#x27;s rank by age among his or her siblings. Typically, researchers classify siblings as &quot;eldest&quot;, &quot;middle child&quot;, and &quot;youngest&quot; or simply distinguish between &quot;first-born&quot; and &quot;later-born&quot; children.

Birth order is commonly believed in pop psychology and popular culture to have a profound and lasting effect on psychological development and personality. For example, firstborns are seen as conservative and high-achieving, middle children as natural mediators, and youngest children as charming and outgoing. Despite its lasting presence in the public domain, studies have failed to consistently produce clear, valid, compelling findings; therefore, it has earned the title of a pseudo-psychology amongst the scientific psychological community.

===History===
The theorizing and study of birth order can be traced back to Francis Galton&#x27;s (1822–1911) theory of birth order and and Alfred Adler&#x27;s (1870–1937) theory of birth order and personality characteristics.

==== Galton ====
In his book &quot;English Men of Science: Their Nature and Nurture&quot; (1874), Galton noted that prominent composers and scientists are over-represented as first-borns. He theorized three main reasons as to why first-borns are generally more eminent:
# Primogeniture laws: first-borns have access to their parents&#x27; financial resources to continue their education.
# First-borns are given more responsibility than their younger siblings and are treated more as companions by their parents.
# First-borns are given more attention and nourishment in families with limited financial resources.

====Adler====
* First Borns: Fulfilling family roles of leadership and authority, obedient of protocol and hierarchy. Seek out and prefer order, structure and adherence to norms and rules. They partake in goal-striving behaviour as their lives are centred around achievement and accomplishment themes. They fear the loss of their position in the top of the hierarchy.
* Middle Children: Feel like outcasts of families as they lack primacy of the first child and the &quot;attention garnering recency&quot; of the youngest. These children often go to great lengths to de-identify themselves with their siblings, in an attempt to make a different and individualized identity for themselves as they feel like they were &quot;squeezed out&quot; of their families.
* Youngest Children: Feel disadvantaged compared to older siblings, are often perceived as less capable or experienced and are therefore indulged and spoiled. Because of this, they are skilled in coaxing/charming others to do things for them or provide. This contributes to the image of them being popular and outgoing, as they engage in attention-seeking behaviour to meet their needs.

=== Contemporary findings ===
Today, the flaws and inconsistencies in birth order research eliminate its validity. It is very difficult to control solely for factors related to birth order, and therefore most studies produce ambiguous results. Embedded into theories of birth order is a debate of nature versus nurture. It has been disproved that there is something innate in the position one is born into, and therefore creating a preset role. Birth order has no genetic basis.

The social interaction that occurs as a result of birth order however is the most notable. Older siblings often become role models of behaviour, and younger siblings become learners and supervisees. Older siblings are at a developmental advantage both cognitively and socially. The role of birth order also depends greatly and varies greatly on family context. Family size, sibling identification, age gap, modeling, parenting techniques, gender, class, race, and temperament are all confounding variables that can influence behaviour and therefore perceived behaviour of specific birth categories. The research on birth order does have stronger correlations, however, in areas such as intelligence and physical features, but are likely caused by other factors other than the actual position of birth. Some research has found that firstborn children have slightly higher IQs on average than later born children. However, other research finds no such effect. It has been found that first-borns score three points higher compared to second borns and that children born earlier in a family are on average, taller and weigh more than those born later. However, it is impossible to generalize birth order characteristics and apply them universally to all individuals in that subgroup.

==== Contemporary explanations for IQ findings ====

===== Resource dilution model =====
(Blake, 1981) provide three potential reasons for the higher scoring of older siblings on IQ tests:
# Parental resources are finite, first-born children get full and primary access to these resources.
# As the number of a children in a family goes up, the more resources must be shared.
# These parental resources have an important impact on a child&#x27;s educational success.

===== Confluence model =====
Robert Zajonc proposed that the intellectual environment within a family is ever-changing due to three factors, and therefore more permissive of first-born children&#x27;s intellectual advancement:
# Firstborns do not need to share parental attention and have their parents&#x27; complete absorption. More siblings in the family limit the attention devoted to each of them.
# Firstborns are exposed to more adult language. Later-borns are exposed to the less-mature speech of their older siblings.
# Firstborns and older siblings must answer questions and explain things to younger siblings, acting as tutors. This advances their cognitive processing of information and language skills.

In 1996, interest in the science behind birth order was re-sparked when Frank Sulloway’s book &quot;Born To Rebel&quot; was published. In this book, Sulloway argues that firstborns are more conscientious, more socially dominant, less agreeable, and less open to new ideas compared to later-borns. While being seemingly empirical and academic, as many studies are cited throughout the book, it is still often criticized as a biased and incomplete account of the whole picture of siblings and birth order. Because it is a novel, the research and theories proposed throughout were not criticized and peer-reviewed by other academics before its release.
Literature reviews that have examined many studies and attempted to control for confounding variables tend to find minimal effects for birth order on personality.
In her review of the scientific literature, Judith Rich Harris suggests that birth order effects may exist within the context of the family of origin, but that they are not enduring aspects of personality.

In practice, systematic birth order research is a challenge because it is difficult to control for all of the variables that are statistically related to birth order. For example, large families are generally lower in socioeconomic status than small families, so third-born children are more likely than first-born children to come from poorer families. Spacing of children, parenting style, and gender are additional variables to consider.

==Regressive behavior at birth==


Regressive behaviors are the child&#x27;s way of demanding the parents&#x27; love and attention.

The arrival of a new baby is especially stressful for firstborns and for siblings between 3 and 5 years old. In such situations, regressive behavior may be accompanied by aggressive behavior, such as handling the baby roughly. All of these symptoms are considered to be typical and developmentally appropriate for children between the ages of 3 and 5. While some can be prevented, the remainder can be improved within a few months. Regressive behavior may include demand for a bottle, thumb sucking, requests to wear diapers (even if toilet-trained), or requests to carry a security blanket.

The American Academy of Pediatrics suggests that instead of protesting or telling children to act their age, parents should simply grant their requests without becoming upset. The affected children will soon return to their normal routine when they realize that they now have just as important a place in the family as the new sibling. Most of the behaviors can be improved within a few months.

The University of Michigan Health System advises that most occurrences of regressive behavior are mild and to be expected; however, it recommends parents to contact a pediatrician or child psychologist if the older child tries to hurt the baby, if regressive behavior does not improve within 2 or 3 months, or if the parents have other questions or concerns.

==Rivalry==

&quot;Sibling rivalry&quot; is a type of competition or animosity among brothers and sisters. It appears to be particularly intense when children are very close in age or of the same gender. Sibling rivalry can involve aggression; however, it is not the same as sibling abuse where one child victimizes another.

Sibling rivalry usually starts right after, or before, the arrival of the second child. While siblings will still love each other, it is not uncommon for them to bicker and be malicious to each other. Children are sensitive from the age of 1 year to differences in parental treatment and by 3 years they have a sophisticated grasp of family rules and can evaluate themselves in relation to their siblings. Sibling rivalry often continues throughout childhood and can be very frustrating and stressful to parents. One study found that the age group 10–15 reported the highest level of competition between siblings. Sibling rivalry can continue into adulthood and sibling relationships can change dramatically over the years. Approximately one-third of adults describe their relationship with siblings as rivalrous or distant. However, rivalry often lessens over time and at least 80% of siblings over age 60 enjoy close ties.

Each child in a family competes to define who they are as persons and want to show that they are separate from their siblings. Sibling rivalry increases when children feel they are getting unequal amounts of their parents&#x27; attention, where there is stress in the parents&#x27; and children&#x27;s lives, and where fighting is accepted by the family as a way to resolve conflicts. Sigmund Freud saw the sibling relationship as an extension of the Oedipus complex, where brothers were in competition for their mother&#x27;s attention and sisters for their father&#x27;s. Evolutionary psychologists explain sibling rivalry in terms of parental investment and kin selection: a parent is inclined to spread resources equally among all children in the family, but a child wants most of the resources for him or herself.

==Relationships==
===Jealousy===

Jealousy is not a single emotion. The basic emotions expressed in jealous interactions are fear, anger, relief, sadness, and anxiety. Jealousy occurs in a social triangle of relationships which do not require a third person. The social triangle involves the relationships between the jealous individual and the parent, the relationship between the parent and the rival, and the relationship between jealous individual and the rival.

====Newborn====
First-borns&#x27; attachment to their parents is directly related to their jealous behaviour. In a study by Volling, four classes of children were identified based on their different responses of jealousy to new infant siblings and parent interactions.
Regulated Exploration Children: 60% of children fall into this category. These children closely watch their parents interact with their newborn sibling, approach them positively and sometimes join the interaction. They show fewer behaviour problems in the months following the new birth and do not display problematic behaviours during the parent-infant interaction. These children are considered secure as they act how a child would be expected to act in a familiar home setting with their parents present as secure bases to explore the environment.
Approach-Avoidant Children: 30% of children fall into this category. These children observe parent-infant interaction closely and are less likely to approach the infant and the parent. They are anxious to explore the new environment as they tend to seek little comfort from their parents.
Anxious-Clingy Children: 6% of children fell into this category. These children have an intense interest in parent-infant interaction and a strong desire to seek proximity and contact with the parent, and sometimes intrude on parent-child interaction.
Disruptive Children: 2.7% of children fall into this category. These children are emotionally reactive and aggressive. They have difficulty regulating their negative emotions and may be likely to externalize it as negative behaviour around the newborn.

====Parental effect====
Children are more jealous of the interactions between newborns and their mothers than they are with newborns and their fathers. This is logical as up until the birth of the infant, the first-born child had the mother as their primary care-giver all to themselves. Some research has suggested that children display less jealous reactions over father-newborn interactions because fathers tend to punish negative emotion and are less tolerant than mothers of clinginess and visible distress, although this is hard to generalize.

Children that have parents with a better marital relationship are better at regulating their jealous emotions. Children are more likely to express jealousy when their parents are directing their attention to the sibling as opposed to when the parents are solely interacting with them. Parents who are involved in good marital communication help their children cope adaptively with jealousy. They do this by modelling problem-solving and conflict resolution for their children. Children are also less likely to have jealous feelings when they live in a home in which everyone in the family shares and expresses love and happiness.

====Implicit theories====
Implicit theories about relationships are associated with the ways children think of strategies to deal with a new situation. 
Children can fall into two categories of implicit theorizing. They may be malleable theorists and believe that they can affect change on situations and people. Alternatively, they may be fixed theorists, believing situations and people are not changeable. These implicit beliefs determine both the intensity of their jealous feelings, and how long those jealous feelings last.
Malleable Theorists display engaging behaviours, like interacting with the parent or sibling in an attempt to improve the situation. They tend to have more intense and longer-lasting feelings of jealousy because they spend more time ruminating on the situation and constructing ways to make it better.
Fixed Theorists display non-engaging behaviours, for example retreating to their room because they believe none of their actions will affect or improve the situation. They tend to have less intense and shorter lasting feelings of jealousy than malleable theorists.

====Different ages====
Older children tend to be less jealous than their younger sibling. This is due to their ability to mentally process the social situation in a way that gives them more positive, empathetic feelings toward their younger sibling. Older children are better able to cope with their jealous feelings toward their younger sibling due to their understanding of the necessary relationship between the parent and younger sibling. Older children are also better at self-regulating their emotions and are less dependent on their caregivers for external regulation as opposed to their younger siblings.
Younger siblings&#x27; feelings of jealousy are overpowered by feelings of anger. The quality of the relationship between the younger child and the older child is also a factor in jealousy, as the better the relationship the less jealous feelings occurred and vice versa.

===Conflict===
Sibling conflict is pervasive and often shrugged off as an accepted part of sibling dynamics. In spite of the broad variety of conflict that siblings are often involved in, sibling conflicts can be grouped into two broader categories. The first category is conflict about equality or fairness. It is not uncommon to see siblings who think that their sibling is favored by their teachers, peers, or especially their parents. In fact it is not uncommon to see siblings who both think that their parents favor the other sibling. Perceived inequalities in the division of resources such as who got a larger dessert also fall into this category of conflict. This form of conflict seems to be more prevalent in the younger sibling.

The second category of conflict involves an invasion of a child&#x27;s perceived personal domain by their sibling. An example of this type of conflict is when a child enters their sibling&#x27;s room when they are not welcome, or when a child crosses over into their sibling&#x27;s side of the car in a long road trip. These types of fights seem to be more important to older siblings due to their larger desire for independence.

===Warmth===

Sibling warmth is a term for the degree of affection and companionship shared by siblings. Sibling warmth seems to have an effect on siblings. Higher sibling warmth is related to better social skill and higher perceived social competence. Even in cases where there is a high level of sibling conflict if there is also a high level of sibling warmth then social skills and competence remain unaffected.

===Negative effects of conflict===

The saying that people &quot;fight like siblings&quot; shows just how charged sibling conflict can be and how well recognized sibling squabbles are. In spite of how widely acknowledged these squabbles can be, sibling conflict can have several impacts on the sibling pair. It has been shown that increased levels of sibling conflict are related to higher levels of anxiety and depression in siblings, along with lower levels of self-worth and lower levels of academic competence. In addition, sibling warmth is not a protective factor for the negative effects of anxiety, depression, lack of self-worth and lower levels of academic competence. This means that sibling warmth does not counteract these negative effects. Sibling conflict is also linked to an increase in more risky behavior including: smoking cigarettes, skipping days of school, contact with the police, and other behaviors in Caucasian sibling pairs with the exception of firstborns with younger brothers. Except for the elder brother in this pair sibling conflict is positively correlated with risky behavior, thus sibling conflict may be a risk factor for behavioral problems. 
A study on what the topic of the fight was (invasion of personal domain or inequality) also shows that the topic of the fight may have a result on the effects of the conflict. This study showed that sibling conflict over personal domain were related to lower levels of self-esteem, and sibling conflict over perceived inequalities seem to be more related to depressive symptoms. However, the study also showed that greater depressive and anxious symptoms were also related to more frequent sibling conflict and more intense sibling conflict.

===Parental management techniques of conflict===

Techniques used by parents to manage their children&#x27;s conflicts include parental non-intervention, child-centered parental intervention strategies, and more rarely the encouragement of physical conflict between siblings. Parental non-intervention included techniques in which the parent ignores the siblings&#x27; conflict and lets them work it out between themselves without outside guidance. In some cases, this technique is chosen to avoid situations in which the parent decides which sibling is in the right and may favor one sibling over the other, however, by following this technique the parent may sacrifice the opportunity to instruct their children on how to deal with conflict. Child-centered parental interventions include techniques in which the parent mediates the argument between the two children and helps them come to an agreement. Using this technique, parents may help model how the children can deal with conflicts in the future; however, parents should avoid dictating the outcome to the children, and make sure that they are mediating the argument making suggestions, allowing the children to decide the outcome. This may be especially important when some of the children have autism. Techniques in which parents encourage physical aggression between siblings may be chosen by the parents to help children deal with aggression in the future, however, this technique does not appear to be effective as it is linked to greater conflict levels between children. Parental non-intervention is also linked to higher levels of sibling conflict, and lower levels of sibling warmth. It appears that child-centered parental interventions have the best effect on sibling&#x27;s relationship with a link to greater levels of sibling warmth and lower levels of sibling conflict.

===Long-term effects of presence===

Studies on social skill and personality differences between only children and children with siblings suggest that overall the presence of a sibling does not have any effect on the child as an adult.

==Gender roles among children and parents==

There have always been some differences between siblings, especially different sex siblings. Often, different sex sibling may consider things to be unfair because their brother or sister is allowed to do certain things because of their gender, while they get to do something less fun or just different. McHale and her colleague conducted a longitudinal study using middle-childhood aged children and observed the way in which the parents contributed to stereotypical attitudes in their kids. In their study the experimenters analysed two different types of families, one with the same sex siblings, and the other with different sex siblings, as well as the children&#x27;s birth order. The experiment was conducted using phone interviews, in which the experimenters would ask the children about the activities they performed throughout their day outside of school. The experimenters found that in the homes where there were mixed gender kids, and the father held traditional values, the kids also held traditional values and therefore also played gender based roles in the home. In contrast, in homes where the father did not hold traditional values, the house chores were divided more equally among his kids. However, if fathers had two male children, the younger male tended to help more with household chores, but as he reached his teenage years the younger child stopped being as helpful around the house. However, education may be a confounder affecting both the father&#x27;s attitude and the siblings&#x27; behavior, and the mother&#x27;s attitudes did not have a noticeable impact.

==Westermarck effect==
Anthropologist Edvard Westermarck found that children who are brought up together as siblings are desensitized to sexual attraction to one another later in life. This is known as the Westermarck Effect. It can be seen in biological and adoptive families, but also in other situations where children are brought up in close contact, such as the Israeli kibbutz system and the Chinese shim-pua marriage.

<doc id="352181" wikidata="Q6604731" url="?curid=352181" title="List of abstract algebra topics">
<text>Abstract algebra is the subject area of mathematics that studies algebraic structures, such as groups, rings, fields, modules, vector spaces, and algebras. The phrase abstract algebra was coined at the turn of the 20th century to distinguish this area from what was normally referred to as algebra, the study of the rules for manipulating formulae and algebraic expressions involving unknowns and real or complex numbers, often now called &quot;elementary algebra&quot;. The distinction is rarely made in more recent writings.

==Basic language==
Algebraic structures are defined primarily as sets with &quot;operations&quot;. 
*Algebraic structure
**Subobjects: subgroup, subring, subalgebra, submodule etc.

<text>A tincture is typically an extract of plant or animal material dissolved in ethanol (ethyl alcohol). Solvent concentrations of 25–60% are common, but may run as high as 90%. In chemistry, a tincture is a solution that has ethanol as its solvent. In herbal medicine, alcoholic tinctures are made with various ethanol concentrations, which should be at least 20% alcohol for preservation purposes.

Other solvents for producing tinctures include vinegar, glycerol (also called glycerine), diethyl ether and propylene glycol, not all of which can be used for internal consumption. Ethanol has the advantage of being an excellent solvent for both acidic and basic (alkaline) constituents. A tincture using glycerine is called a glycerite. Glycerine is generally a poorer solvent than ethanol. Vinegar, being acidic, is a better solvent for obtaining alkaloids but a poorer solvent for acidic components. For individuals who choose not to ingest alcohol, non-alcoholic extracts offer an alternative for preparations meant to be taken internally.

Low volatility substances such as iodine and mercurochrome can also be turned into tinctures.

==Characteristics==
Tinctures are often made of a combination of ethyl alcohol and water as solvents, each dissolving constituents the other is unable to, or weaker at. Varying their proportions can also produce different levels of constituents in the final extraction. As an antimicrobial, alcohol also acts as a preservative.

A downside of using alcohol as a solvent is that ethanol has a tendency to denature some organic compounds, reducing or destroying their effectiveness. This tendency can also have undesirable effects when extracting botanical constituents, such as polysaccharides. Certain other constituents, common among them proteins, can become irreversibly denatured, or &quot;pickled&quot; by the alcohol. Alcohol can also have damaging effects on some aromatic compounds.

Ether and propylene glycol based tinctures are not suitable for internal consumption, although they are used in preparations for external use, such as personal care creams and ointments.

==Examples==

Some examples that were formerly common in medicine include:
* Tincture of benzoin
* Tincture of cannabis
* Tincture of cantharides
* Tincture of castoreum
* Tincture of ferric citrochloride, a chelate of citric acid and Iron(III) chloride
* Tincture of green soap, which classically contains lavender oil
* Tincture of guaiac gum
* Tincture of iodine
* Tincture of opium (laudanum)
** Camphorated tincture of opium (paregoric)
* Tincture of pennyroyal
* Warburg&#x27;s tincture (&quot;Tinctura Antiperiodica&quot; or &quot;Antiperiodic Tincture&quot;, a 19th-century antipyretic)

Examples of spirits include:
* Spirit of ammonia (spirits of hartshorn)
* Spirit of camphor
* Spirit of ether, a solution of diethyl ether in alcohol
* &quot;Spirit of Mindererus&quot;, ammonium acetate in alcohol
* &quot;Spirit of nitre&quot; is not a spirit in this sense, but an old name for nitric acid (but &quot;sweet spirit of nitre&quot; was ethyl nitrite)
* Similarly &quot;spirit(s) of salt&quot; actually meant hydrochloric acid. The concentrated, fuming, 35% acid is still sold under this name in the UK, for use as a drain-cleaning fluid.
* &quot;Spirit of vinegar&quot; is an antiquated term for glacial acetic acid
* &quot;Spirit of vitriol&quot; is an antiquated term for sulfuric acid
* &quot;Spirit of wine&quot; or &quot;spirits of wine&quot; is an old term for alcohol (especially food grade alcohol derived from the distillation of wine)
* &quot;Spirit of wood&quot; referred to methanol, often derived from the destructive distillation of wood

== See also ==
* Nalewka, traditional Polish category of alcoholic tincture.
* Infusion, water or oil based extract with similar historical uses to a tincture.
* Elixir, pharmaceutical preparation containing an active ingredient that is dissolved in a solution containing some percentage of ethyl alcohol.

<text>Cavnic (; ) is a former mining town located in the valley of the river Cavnic, east of Baia Mare, in Maramureș County, northern Romania. Part of the Baia Mare metropolitan area, the town covers , at altitudes ranging from above sea level.

== History ==
Cavnic was first documented in 1336, as &quot;Capnic&quot;. It was named after the river, which got its name from a Slavic word, &quot;kopanе,&quot; which refers to digging. Mining activity in the area dates back to the Roman age.

The town was destroyed by the Ottomans in 1460 and by the Tatars in 1717, but the Tatar invasion ended with their defeat from the people of Cavnic, making from it the last Tatar invasion to ever take place in the current territory of Romania. As a proof of the last Tatar invasion, the town hosts a tall obelisk on which a Latin inscription states &quot;Anno 1717 usque hic fuerunt tartari&quot; meaning &quot;During the year 1717 the Tatars arrived here&quot;. The obelisk is known among locals as &quot;Tatar Pole&quot; or &quot;Written Rock&quot;. The exact date when the obelisk was built is currently unknown.

In the 1910 Census of the Kingdom of Hungary, Kapnikbánya (as it was then called) was in Szatmár County, Nagybánya district. It then had a population of 3,517, out of which 1,864 were Hungarians, 1,604 were Romanians, and 49 were Germans. 1,497 identified as Catholic, 1,890 as Greek Catholic, and 89 as Jewish.

The town&#x27;s mines tended to close and reopen, often not remaining operational for any great length of time. In the 1970s, however, Cavnic underwent a great deal of development. Two ski slopes were built at Icoana, and the town gained motels, boardinghouses and a hotel to take advantage of its touristic potential.

As an interesting detail of touristic interest, it appears that one of the oldest inscriptions ever found in European mines has been uncovered in Voievod Gallery belonging to the former town&#x27;s mine. The inscription states &quot;Hier hats erschlagen Iacob Huber&quot; (&quot;Here was killed Iacob Huber&quot;). The text, dated 1511, was most likely written to commemorate a mining accident.

At the 2011 Romanian census, Cavnic had 4,862 residents, of whom 4,026 were Romanians (82.8%), 705 Hungarians (14.5%), 28 Roma, 4 Germans, and 97 others. At the 2021 census, the town had population of 4,264, of which 81.85% were Romanians and 7.13% Hungarians.

==Notable people==
* Ignaz von Born, geologist, was born here on December 26, 1742.
* , Hungarian professor and philosopher, was born here in 1824.
* , Hungarian geologist, was born here on February 14, 1886.

<doc id="352203" wikidata="Q7545325" url="?curid=352203" title="Smith Square">
<text>Smith Square is a square in Westminster, London, 250 metres south-southwest of the Palace of Westminster. Most of its garden interior is filled by St John&#x27;s, Smith Square, a Baroque surplus church, the inside of which has been converted to a concert hall. Most adjoining buildings (thus sharing its address) are offices, with the focus on organisations lobbying or serving the government. In the mid-20th century, the square hosted the headquarters of the two largest parties of British politics, and it is now hosts much of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Local Government Association. It has a pedestrian or mixed approach to the four sides and another approach to the north.

==History==
The square was named after the Smith family: a family of bankers originally from Nottingham on whose land it was developed in the early eighteenth century. Its building up was arranged by Sir James Smith around 1726. №s 1 to 9, forming the north side, survive from this phase.

==Buildings==
Sir John Smith, who was Conservative M.P. for Cities of London and Westminster from 1965 to 1970, lived at № 1.
The campaigning journalist William Thomas Stead lived at № 5 from 1904 until his death on board the Titanic in 1912. Another famous resident was Rab Butler, the Conservative Deputy Prime Minister.

№ 17 - Nobel House - cross-corner block built in 1928, for newly-formed Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI). ICI leased it to the government in 1987, and it is currently headquarters for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.

Sharing the western part of the south side is Transport House which from 1928 to 1980 head-quartered the Labour Party then the TGWU until the 1990s. It is now the headquarters of the Local Government Association and is known as Local Government House.

№s 32-34 served as Conservative Central Office, the Conservative Party&#x27;s headquarters between 1958 and 2003. It stood empty until 2007 when it was sold for £30.5m to Harcourt Developments who planned to redevelop it as flats before the 2008 credit crunch hit. It is now &quot;Europe House&quot;.

№ 36 - Mulberry House - designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and constructed in 1911 for Reginald McKenna, a senior politician who later became chairman of the Midland Bank. It was later bought by Henry Mond, 2nd Baron Melchett who, in conjunction with his wife, Gwen, commissioned an elaborate interior re-decoration by the architect Darcy Braddell. The result has been described as &quot;one of the most important Art Deco interiors in London.&quot; It gained notoriety for the sculpture &quot;Scandal&quot;, designed by Charles Sargeant Jagger which is now housed in the Victoria and Albert Museum. The Grade II listed building went up for sale of £25 million in 2015.

<doc id="352229" wikidata="Q2756833" url="?curid=352229" title="Távora affair">
<text>The Távoras affair was a political scandal of the 18th century Portuguese court. The events triggered by the attempted assassination of King Joseph I of Portugal in 1758 ended with the public execution of the entire Távora family, their closest relatives and some servants in 1759. Some historians interpret the incident as an attempt by prime minister Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo (later Marquis of Pombal) to curb the growing powers of the old aristocratic families.

Even today, historians doubt whether the Távoras were actually involved in the plot or whether they were the victims of a coup set up by the Prime Minister. Queen Maria I, after removing Pombal, rehabilitated the name of the Távora family in 1781, following a review of the trial.

==Prelude==
In the aftermath of the Lisbon earthquake on 1 November 1755, which destroyed the royal palace, King Joseph I took up residence in a tent complex in Ajuda, on the outskirts of the city. This was the centre of Portuguese political and social life at the time. The King lived surrounded by his staff, led by the prime minister, Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, and was attended by members of the nobility.

The prime minister was a strict man, son of a country squire, with a grudge against the old nobility, who despised him. Clashes between them were frequent and tolerated by the king, who trusted Sebastião de Melo for his competent leadership after the earthquake.

King Joseph I was married to Mariana Victoria of Spain, Infanta of Spain, and had four daughters. Despite an attested happy family life (the King loved his daughters and enjoyed playing with them and taking them on nature walks), Joseph I had a favourite mistress: Marquise Teresa Leonor, wife (and aunt) of Luís Bernardo, heir of the Távora family. Luís Bernardo&#x27;s parents, Marquise Leonor Tomásia de Távora, and her husband, Francisco de Assis, Count of Alvor and former Viceroy of India, headed one of the most powerful families in the Kingdom. They were related to the houses of Aveiro, Cadaval, and Alorna. They were also among the bitterest enemies of Sebastião de Melo. Leonor de Távora was politically influential, preoccupied with the affairs of the Kingdom handed to, from her perspective, an upstart with no education. She was also a devout Catholic with strong ties to the Jesuits, including her personal confessor, Gabriel Malagrida.

==Assassination attempt==

On the night of 3 September 1758, Joseph I was riding in an unmarked carriage on a secondary, unfrequented road on the outskirts of Lisbon. The King was returning to the tents of Ajuda after an evening with his mistress Marquise Teresa Leonor. Somewhere along the way two or three men intercepted the carriage and fired on its occupants. Joseph I was shot in the arm and his driver was badly wounded, but both survived and returned to Ajuda.

Sebastião de Melo took control of the situation. Concealing the attack and the King&#x27;s injuries, he initiated a swift inquiry.

A few days later two men were arrested for the shootings and tortured. The men confessed their guilt and stated that they were following the orders of the Távora family, who were plotting to put the Duke of Aveiro on the throne. Both men were hanged the following day, even before the attempted regicide was made public.

== Arrests, trial and sentence ==
Over a thousand arrests were made. In the following weeks the Marchioness Leonor de Távora, her husband the Count of Alvor, and all of their sons, daughters, and grandchildren were imprisoned. Alleged conspirators, the Duke of Aveiro and the Távoras&#x27; sons-in-law, the Marquis of Alorna, and the Count of Atouguia, were arrested with their families. The Jesuits were considered implicated in the attack, and Gabriel Malagrida, the Jesuit confessor of Leonor de Távora, was also arrested.

All were accused of high treason and attempted regicide. The evidence presented in their common trial was simple: a) the confessions of the executed assassins; b) the murder weapon belonging to the Duke of Aveiro; and c) the assumption that only the Távoras would have known the whereabouts of the king on that evening since he was returning from a liaison with Teresa de Távora.

During the trial intense violence and torture were used to obtain confessions. That was legal, but even witnesses for the prosecution were tortured, which was not permitted by law. Their estates were confiscated by the crown, even before the trial, their palaces in Lisbon destroyed and its soil salted, their name erased from the peerage and their coat-of-arms outlawed. Most historians agree that the whole process was &quot;full of omissions, judicial contradictions and calumnies.&quot;

A special court, the &quot;Suprema Junta da Inconfidência&quot;, was authorised to invent the sentences to be imposed on those convicted, because none of those laid down in the law seemed severe enough for them. The original sentence ordered the execution of entire families, including women and children. Only the intervention of Queen Mariana and Maria Francisca, heiress to the throne, saved most of them.

The Marchioness, however, was not spared. She and the other defendants sentenced to death were publicly tortured and executed on 13 January 1759, in a field near Lisbon. The King was present at the executions with his bewildered court. The Távoras were their peers and kin, but the prime minister wanted the lesson driven home.

=== Executions ===
In Belém, during the night from the 12 to the 13 January 1759, a scaffold was built. In the morning, Marquise Leonor de Távora went up the stairs between two priests. Three executioners showed her the instruments of execution one by one, and explained to her how her husband, her children, and her daughter&#x27;s husband would die: the sledgehammer to break the chests and the bones, the garrote to strangulate. Then one executioner made her sit down, blindfolded, and beheaded her.

Then the Marquise&#x27;s sons, José Maria de Távora and Luís Bernardo, came forward for the execution. They were tied to an &quot;aspa (a St. Andrew&#x27;s Cross)&quot; and at the same time as the main executioner put them to death by garrote, his helpers broke their bones with sledgehammers. Similarly executed were Jerónimo de Ataíde, Count of Atouguia, and the commoners Manuel Álvares Ferreira, Brás José Romeiro, and João Miguel. 

Finally, the Marquis of Távora and José Mascarenhas, Duke of Aveiro were executed after showing them the dismembered bodies, and the instruments of their deaths. Bound to the &quot;aspas&quot;, they were struck with an eight kilogram sledgehammer until they died.

Afterward, the ground was salted, to prevent future growth of vegetation. To this day, in this location there remains an alley called &quot;Beco do Chão Salgado&quot; (&quot;alley of the salted ground&quot;); on its corner stands a shame memorial with an inscription just below waist height, overlooked by no saints&#x27; statues in niches - this disposition effectively converted the memorial into a popular public urinal. The inscription on the monument (translated to English) reads:

::&quot;In this place were razed to the ground and salted the houses of José Mascarenhas, stripped of the honours of Duque de Aveiro and others, convicted by sentence proclaimed in the Supreme Court of Inconfidences on the 12th of January 1759. Brought to Justice as one of the leaders of the most barbarous and execrable upheaval that, on the night of the 3rd of September 1758, was committed against the most royal and sacred person of the Lord Joseph I. On this infamous land nothing may be built for all time&quot;.

== Aftermath ==

Gabriel Malagrida was denounced to the Portuguese Inquisition by Sebastião de Melo, himself a &quot;familiar&quot; (i.e. a lay officer of the inquisition), with the accusation of heresy. He was garroted and burned at the stake in September 1761 and the Jesuit Order outlawed that same year. All its estates were confiscated and all Jesuits expelled from Portuguese territory, both in Europe and the colonies.

The Alorna family and the daughters of the Duke of Aveiro were sentenced to life imprisonment in various monasteries and convents. As for the King&#x27;s mistress, the young Marquise Teresa Leonor, according to the British envoy in Lisbon she was sent to a not very strict convent, where she lived &quot;very much at her ease.&quot; Her relations with King Joseph ended after the alleged assassination attempt, but he ordered that she be given a large pension, and, not surprisingly, there is not the slightest reference to her in the case file.

Sebastião de Melo was made Count of Oeiras for his competent handling of the affair, and later, in 1770, was promoted to Marquis of Pombal, the name by which he is known today.

==Discussion==
The guilt or innocence of the Távoras is still debated today by Portuguese historians. On the one hand, the tense relations between the aristocracy and the king are well documented. The lack of a male heir to the throne displeased most of them and, indeed, the Duke of Aveiro was a possible candidate for succession.

On the other hand, some refer to a convenient coincidence: with the conviction of the Távoras and the Jesuits, all enemies of Sebastião de Melo disappeared and the nobility was tamed. Moreover, the Távoras&#x27; defenders argue that the attempted murder of Joseph I might have been a random attack by highway robbers since the king was travelling without guard or sign of rank on a dangerous Lisbon road. Another indication of their possible innocence is the fact that none of the Távoras or their allies tried to escape from Portugal in the days following the attack.

<doc id="352231" wikidata="Q2918802" url="?curid=352231" title="Camperdown, New South Wales">
<text>Camperdown is an inner western suburb of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Camperdown is located 4 kilometres south-west of the Sydney central business district and is part of the Inner West region. Camperdown lies across the local government areas of the City of Sydney and Inner West Council.

Camperdown is a heavily populated suburb and is home to the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, the University of Sydney and the historic Camperdown Cemetery. It was also once home to the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children, which was relocated to be next to Westmead Hospital in Sydney&#x27;s west. The hospital buildings and grounds have been redeveloped into apartment complexes.

== History ==
Camperdown takes its name from the Battle of Camperdown (or Camperduin in Dutch). It was named by Governor William Bligh who received a grant of 240 acres (1 km2) of land covering present day Camperdown and parts of Newtown. The land passed to Bligh&#x27;s son-in-law Maurice O&#x27;Connell, commander of the 73rd Regiment, later Sir Maurice, when Bligh returned to England. Camperdown was established as a residential and farming area in the early 19th century.

In 1827, a racecourse was opened on land where the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital now stands. The University of Sydney was incorporated in 1850 and its first buildings were designed by Edmund Blacket (1817–1883). In 1859, Blacket&#x27;s Great Hall was opened at the university.

== Heritage listings ==
Camperdown has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* 10, 14 Australia Street: Cranbrook
* Missenden Road: Admission Block, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital 
* Missenden Road: Victoria &amp; Albert Pavilions, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital
* Corner of Parramatta and City Roads: Victoria Park

==Demographics==
At the 2021 census there were 9,381 people living in Camperdown. In Camperdown, 59.4% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 5.0%, China 3.7%, New Zealand 3.0%, India 1.8% and United States of America 1.6%. 73.2% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin 4.5% and Cantonese 1.8%. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 58.1% and Catholic 14.7%.

==Education==
A large part of Camperdown is taken up by the University of Sydney and the residential colleges within the university. These colleges include: St John&#x27;s College, St Andrew&#x27;s College, St Paul&#x27;s College, Sancta Sophia College, Wesley College and The Women&#x27;s College. 
==Houses==
In common with neighbouring inner city suburbs such as Newtown and Enmore, Camperdown has large areas of Victorian terraced housing, including many examples of single storey terraces. There are several examples of semi-detached houses which became popular around the time of Australia&#x27;s Federation at the turn of the 20th century. With the advent of gentrification, from the late 20th century, modern infill development now tends to be sympathetic with the traditional Victorian and Edwardian streetscapes.
== Parks ==

Victoria Park is located on the corner of Parramatta Road and City Road, adjacent to the University of Sydney.

Camperdown Park is surrounded by Mallett, Pidcock, Fowler and Australia Streets and includes several sports grounds and an urban farm.

Contrary to popular belief and naming conventions, the highly-frequented &#x27;Camperdown Memorial Park&#x27; actually resides in the suburb of Newtown.

==Transport==

Roads

Parramatta Road (Great Western Highway) (A22) is a major transport artery between Sydney and Parramatta. It runs across the northern side of Camperdown. City Road (A36) is part of a major route to the southern suburbs of Sydney. It meets Parramatta Road and Broadway at a major intersection on the eastern tip of Camperdown. Both City Road and Parramatta Road had tram services until the late 1950s.

==In popular culture==
The suburb is mentioned in the song &quot;Australia Street&quot; by the band Sticky Fingers, featuring on their 2013 album &quot;Caress Your Soul&quot;. Also, poem titled &quot;The Sleeping City, Australia Street&quot; by Helen Loughlin references many sites around the Camperdown area.

<text>Legio XVIII (&quot;Eighteenth Legion&quot;, spelled XVIII or XIIX) was a legion of the Imperial Roman army. It was founded ca. 41 BC by the future emperor Augustus. The legion was, along with Legio XVII and Legio XIX, destroyed in the Battle of Teutoburg Forest (September, 9 AD). The legion&#x27;s symbol and &quot;cognomen&quot; are unknown.

This legion was probably created to deal with Sextus Pompeius, the last opponent of the Second Triumvirate, garrisoned in Sicily and threatening Rome&#x27;s grain supply. It was probably one of the eight legions Augustus promised Mark Antony for his campaign against the Parthians, but never delivered.

Following the defeat of Antony and Cleopatra in the battle of Actium (31 BC), the legion was stationed in Gaul. In the end of the 1st century BC, the XVIIIth was sent to the Germania provinces in the Rhine to take part in the enormous army led by Drusus and later Tiberius. In 5, the provinces were pacified. In 7, Publius Quinctilius Varus was assigned governor.

On September 9, Arminius, leader of the Cheruscan allies, reported a rebellion in the Rhine area. Without suspecting the information received, Varus took his three legions, the XVIII along with XVII and XIX, and headed west. Near modern Osnabrück, the Cheruscii led by Arminius ambushed the governor&#x27;s army. All three legions were destroyed in what is known as the Battle of Teutoburg Forest and their eagle standards lost.

After their destruction, the Romans never used these legion numbers (XVII, XVIII and XIX) again.

<doc id="352236" wikidata="Q6921254" url="?curid=352236" title="Mount Hood Corridor">
<text>The Mount Hood Corridor is a part of Oregon between Sandy and Government Camp, in Clackamas County. It is named after Mount Hood and has served travelers going in both directions since the days of Native Americans and Oregon Trail migrants. The area between Alder Creek and Government Camp is sometimes known as Hoodland.

It includes the following communities (from east to west):
* Government Camp
* Rhododendron
* Faubion
* Zigzag
* Welches
* Wemme
* Wildwood
* Mountain Air Park
* Salmon
* Brightwood
* Alder Creek
* Marmot
* Cherryville
* Firwood
* Several other small communities and rural neighborhoods
* Sandy (incorporated city)

The modern-day corridor includes part of the historic Barlow Road and a good-sized portion of the Mount Hood Scenic Byway. U.S. Route 26 runs through the corridor, sometimes alongside the Sandy River.

For the United States 2000 Census, much of the corridor was consolidated into a single Mount Hood Village CDP. In December 2005, the communities from Rhododendron to Marmot applied to Clackamas County seeking to form a village called the Villages at Mount Hood.

<text>Rhododendron is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Clackamas County, Oregon, United States. It is located within the Mount Hood Corridor, between Government Camp and Zigzag on U.S. Route 26 (a.k.a. the Mount Hood Scenic Byway). It is one of the communities that make up the Villages at Mount Hood.

A post office was established in the area in 1909 and named &quot;Rowe&quot; after Henry S. Rowe, a mayor of Portland, Oregon, who was interested in developing the state&#x27;s scenic attractions. In 1917 the office was renamed &quot;Zig Zag&quot; and shortly thereafter &quot;Zigzag&quot;. (The name was later reused for the post office in the current community of Zigzag.) In 1920 the office was renamed &quot;Rhododendron&quot; because of the large number of rhododendrons growing near there. The community started out as a summer resort colony, but with the increased popularity of skiing, it became a year-round settlement.

<doc id="352243" wikidata="Q10710274" url="?curid=352243" title="History of Uppsala">
<text>The city of Uppsala is one of the oldest in Sweden. It has played a dominant role in the political, intellectual and historical development of the country. The two main institutions in the history of Uppsala are the Archdiocese which is located in the city, and Uppsala University, founded in the city in 1477. These have long been established on the western banks of the Fyris river with a trading town on the other side of the river.

== Pre-Christian Uppsala (prehistory–1087) ==

The site where Uppsala stands is a fertile plain. The city lies in the intersection of the esker Uppsalaåsen and the river Fyrisån. In prehistoric times, most of the area was below sea level. Therefore, the first communities in the area were established at a higher altitude in Gamla Uppsala (old Uppsala), about north of the current city. In the 3rd and 4th centuries, old Uppsala grew into an important religious and political centre, with both the pagan Temple at Uppsala and the Thing of all Swedes in the town.

According to the mythological Heimskringla, the city was founded during the reign of Augustus by the pagan god Freyr.

== Medieval Uppsala (1087–1520) ==

In 1087 the temple at Uppsala was burned as a part of the Christianisation of Sweden. In 1164 Gamla Uppsala became the seat of the Swedish Archdiocese. Due to isostasy the shoreline had moved down from Gamla Uppsala, and in the 6th century the Fyris River was not navigable by sail north of &quot;Kvarnfallet&quot; in the current city of Uppsala. At this site the modern city of Uppsala was founded as a port city to Gamla Uppsala, under the name of &quot;Aros&quot;. In the first centuries of the second millennium the port city outgrew Gamla Uppsala, which became increasingly isolated. In 1273 the Archdiocese was moved from Gamla Uppsala to Aros, on the condition that the name Uppsala moved with the Archdiocese, which is how the city got its current name. After the relocation the construction of Uppsala cathedral began, continuing until 1435 when the cathedral was inaugurated.

In 1477 Uppsala University was founded through a papal bull as the first university in northern Europe.

== Vasa era (1520–1702) ==

In 1523 Gustav Vasa seized power in Sweden. During his reign Uppsala experienced a severe decline. The ecclesiastical city was largely affected by his reduction and the university closed due to lack of funds. As a result of the protestant reformation much of the church&#x27;s power moved from Uppsala to the royal court in Stockholm. As a demonstration and consolidation of his power King Gustav began the building of a large fortification on Uppsalaåsen, Uppsala Castle, in 1549.

In the 16th century several important church meetings were held in Uppsala. A new Church Ordinance was accepted in 1571, and in 1593 the Uppsala Synod took place. During the meeting the Augsburg Confession was accepted as the sole religious doctrine and the university was reopened. However, the university took several more decades to resume its full functioning.

During the Swedish Empire Uppsala flourished and became viewed as the second capital of the empire. Through large donations from King Gustav II Adolf the university experienced a renaissance. The king realized the benefits of building his empire with not only military but also intellectual means. In the 1620s a new main building for the university was raised, Gustavianum, and in 1622 the world&#x27;s first professorship in political science was founded, financed by Johan Skytte. In 1663 the student nations at Uppsala university were legalized by the &quot;Konsistorium&quot; (the university&#x27;s decision-making body), and in the same year education in &quot;&quot; was introduced, in an effort to provide the empire with competent military and civil servicemen.

In 1643 Uppsala adopted its first city plan. The medieval town with irregular street patterns was to a large extent demolished and a new city with straight streets and diamond-shaped blocks was built within an large urban square. The plan was mostly completed by 1660. The area near the cathedral was not included in the city plan, and therefore these buildings are the oldest still standing in the city.

On 16 May 1702 much of the city was destroyed in a large fire. The cathedral was one of several buildings severely damaged. It took decades to rebuild the city and after the fire it lost its position as a second capital of Sweden.

== Age of Liberty and the Gustavian era (1702–1809) ==
Uppsala was greatly affected by the ideals of the Age of Enlightenment. Many of Sweden&#x27;s most eminent persons of the enlightenment lived and worked in the city. Among these were the mathematician Samuel Klingenstierna, the astronomer Anders Celsius, the physician Nils Rosén von Rosenstein, the biologist Carl von Linné and the humanist and linguist Johan Ihre.

In the 18th century the bourgeois trading town declined due to competition from the growing capital Stockholm. The university also experienced a set-back during the end of the century due to the deaths of many of its most prominent scientists and the political turmoil in Europe caused by the French revolution.

== Uppsala in the union era (1809–1905) ==
During the first half of the 19th century the university was largely affected by the ideals of romanticism. A group of intellectuals in the city, including Per Daniel Amadeus Atterbom, Lorenzo Hammarsköld and Erik Gustaf Geijer became known as the &quot;Uppsala romantics&quot;. By contrast, in the second half of the century the university was dominated by ideals of natural science. In the 50-year period 1820–1870 the number of students at the university tripled, from 500 persons to 1500. In 1870 women were allowed to study at the university and in 1872 Betty Pettersson became the first woman to graduate from a university in Sweden. During this era many university buildings were erected. In 1841 the new university library Carolina Rediviva was inaugurated, In 1867 the university hospital opened and in 1887 King Oscar II of Sweden inaugurated the university hall. During these years the student nations also obtained their own buildings. In 1843, 1856 and 1875 Uppsala hosted Nordic student meetings.

In 1866 Uppsala Central Station opened which made large scale industrialization in Uppsala possible. The area lacks typical natural resources such as ore and wood, but the soil is fertile. Therefore, the food industry and production of bricks from the muddy soil both grew as businesses in Uppsala.

These factors caused a large population growth in the city. Between 1870 and 1900 the population doubled from 11,433 to 22,818 inhabitants. For the first time the city expanded outside of the old city square which was plotted in the city plan of 1643. The city expanded into the districts of Luthagen and Svartbäcken in the north, and Vaksala in the east.

== War era (1905–1945) ==
In 1921 the State Institute for Racial Biology, known as the &quot;Statens institut för rasbiologi&quot;, was established in Uppsala as a governmental agency for eugenics. It was the world&#x27;s first of its kind. The pro-Nazi physician Herman Bernhard Lundborg was appointed as the first head of the institute, but after he was removed and replaced by Gunnar Dahlberg in 1936 the institute developed towards a less racist and more medicinal and statistical direction. In 1939 &quot;&quot;, &quot;the ball house meeting&quot;, took place in Uppsala. It was organized by the student body at the university. A majority of the assembly made an official protest against accepting ten Jewish academic refugees from Nazi Germany.

During the war era the philosophy faculty at the university grew, and subjects like archaeology, art history and modern languages were introduced. Among the most eminent professors at the university were The Svedberg, Arne Tiselius, Harald Hjärne, Adolf Noreen and Nathan Söderblom. A meta-ethical emotivist view called &quot;Uppsalafilosofin&quot;, the Uppsala school, was introduced by Axel Hägerström and his students, which inspired the development of the legal view Uppsalaskolan. Between the years 1880 and 1945 the number of students at the university tripled from 1500 to 4500, and Uppsala was one of the fastest-growing cities in Sweden.

== Modern Uppsala (1945– )==
In the post-war era Uppsala has experienced comprehensive urban renewal. Unlike most of Europe, Sweden never participated in World War II, so its pre-war infrastructure was intact. But due to severe repair needs and modernistic ideals most of the old city was demolished. Instead, a new city centre was erected, mostly in modernistic and functionalistic style. However, similarly to the demolition and redesign of the city in 1643 the area around the cathedral were left standing.

In the 50-year period between 1940 and 1990 the population of Uppsala municipality more than doubled, growing from 74,000 inhabitants to 156,000. This increased the need for city expansion, which was made possible due to the post–World War II economic expansion. In the Million Programme-era of the 1960s and 1970s several new districts such as Flogsta, Gottsunda, Nyby, Sunnersta and Gränby were built.

The number of university students increased rapidly, from 8,000 in 1960 to 21,000 in 1970. During the tenure of the principal Torgny T:son Segerstedt from 1955 to 1978 more students were admitted to the university than during its entire earlier history combined. Simultaneously Uppsala underwent severe de-industrialisation, with many of the 19th century enterprises shutting down.

In 2011 the population of Uppsala municipality surpassed 200,000 persons.

<doc id="352245" wikidata="Q8071816" url="?curid=352245" title="Zigzag, Oregon">
<text>Zigzag is an unincorporated community in Clackamas County, Oregon, United States. It is located within the Mount Hood Corridor, between Rhododendron and Welches on U.S. Route 26. The community is part of a local type of government called a village as one of the communities making up the Villages at Mount Hood, which stretches from the border of Sandy to Government Camp.

The community is named after the nearby Zigzag River, a tributary of the Sandy River, which is in turn a tributary of the Columbia River. The place was also known as Zig Zag.

==History==
Pioneer Joel Palmer crossed the deep ravine of Zigzag Canyon near the timberline on Mount Hood on October 11, 1845. He described the crossing in his journal:

The manner of descending is to turn directly to the right, go for about one hundred yards, then turn short round, and go zigzag until you come under the place where you started from; then to the right, and so on, until you reach the base.

The Zigzag River is no more crooked than adjoining streams, therefore the stream was most likely identified to fellow travelers on what was to become the Barlow Road by the manner of crossing and not for an especially irregular alignment.

Zigzag post office was established in 1917; it ran intermittently until 1974. For a time the Zigzag post office was located in present-day Rhododendron.

===Historic structures===

The 1935 Zigzag Ranger Station is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). St. John the Evangelist Roman Catholic Church, another NRHP property, was formerly in the Zigzag area. The ZigZag Inn—which, like the ranger station and church, is a rustic-style log structure—was built by William John &quot;Bill&quot; Lenz, son of the founder of Lenz in Hood River County. Lenz built many other notable structures in the area.

<text>Welches is an unincorporated community in Clackamas County, Oregon, United States. It is located within the Mount Hood Corridor between Zigzag and Wemme along U.S. Route 26. It is one of the many communities that make up the Villages at Mount Hood.

==History==
The community was named after Samuel Welch, a homesteader from Virginia who settled near Welches Creek in 1882 with his son, William, after the death of Samuel&#x27;s wife. Samuel Welch died in 1898.

A post office was established in the village in 1905, and in 1909, a hotel was constructed, that ran until 1917; the hotel was eventually replaced by nine cottages. Today a hotel and golf resort is located in the village, complete with croquet courts. Welches is home to the Hoodland library, operated by the city of Sandy.

<doc id="352250" wikidata="Q1213513" url="?curid=352250" title="The Plague Dogs (novel)">
<text>The Plague Dogs is a novel by English author Richard Adams, first published in 1977 by Allen Lane. The book centres around the friendship of two dogs that escape an animal testing facility and are subsequently pursued by both the government and the media. As in Adams&#x27; debut novel, &quot;Watership Down&quot; (1972), the animal characters in &quot;The Plague Dogs&quot; are anthropomorphised.

&quot;The Plague Dogs&quot; features location maps drawn by Alfred Wainwright, a fellwalker and author. The conclusion of the book involves two real-life characters, Adams&#x27; long-time friend Ronald Lockley, and the world-famous naturalist Sir Peter Scott. Having seen a manuscript, both men readily agreed to be identified with the characters and opinions that Adams had attributed to them, as is shown in Adams&#x27; preface to the book.

In 1982, &quot;The Plague Dogs&quot; was adapted into an animated feature film of the same name.

==Plot==

This book tells of the escape of two dogs, Rowf and Snitter, from a government research station in the Lake District in England, where they had been horribly mistreated. They live on their own with help from a red fox, or &quot;tod&quot;, who speaks to them in a Geordie dialect. After the starving dogs attack some sheep on the fells, they are reported as ferocious man-eating monsters by an opportunistic journalist. A great dog hunt follows, which is later intensified with the fear that the dogs could be carriers of a dangerous bioweapon, such as the bubonic plague.

==Basis in reality==
Adams stated in the book&#x27;s introduction that &quot;There is no such place in the Lake District as Animal Research (Scientific and Experimental). In reality, no single testing or experimental station would cover so wide a range of work as Animal Research. However, every &#x27;experiment&#x27; described is one which has actually been carried out on animals somewhere.&quot; The location of &quot;ARSE&quot; (an acronym for Animal Research, Scientific and Experimental, and British slang for buttocks) was based on the remote hill farm of Lawson Park, now run as an artist residence by the contemporary art organisation Grizedale Arts.

==Characters==

*Rowf: A shaggy, large black mongrel, born in the laboratory where inhumane experiments were performed on him and his companion, Snitter. Snitter escapes with Rowf, only to find that living in the great outdoors is quite challenging. Rowf is a downtrodden fellow, quite cynical and increasingly feral in his ways, since he has had a hard life and never met a decent human. As a result of the experimentation, he has gained an abnormal fear of water. Toward the end of his travels, his time with Snitter and his encounter with real-life naturalists Peter Scott and Ronald Lockley has him believing humankind may not be irredeemably bad.
*Snitter: A black and white fox terrier. Unlike his friend, Rowf, Snitter was once settled into a home. After he lost his master in a road accident with a truck, he was sold to the laboratory by his master&#x27;s sister. The scientists in the lab have performed numerous brain surgeries on Snitter, merging his conscious and subconscious mind. This causes him to have nightmarish flashes and dreams at random times, whether he is asleep or awake (similar to Fiver from &quot;Watership Down&quot;). Frequently, he hallucinates the sight of his master approaching, and turns round in joyful greeting, only to find there is no one there. Once he and Rowf escape the lab, Snitter is determined to find another home for himself and his friend. Snitter is the most hopeful character in the book, and the most mysterious, since he can have several strange ramblings concerning his condition and past events. While he and Rowf are swimming out to sea, he has a horrifying vision of a man torturing and killing all the animals of the world, including some the existence of which he could not possibly know about, such as whales.
*The Tod: A red fox encountered by Snitter and Rowf early in the story. He speaks in the dialect of Upper Tyneside, having been born &quot;far ahint th&#x27; Cross Fell&quot;. He forges an uneasy friendship with the dogs, teaching them hunting and survival skills in return for a share of the kill. The friendship is stronger with Snitter, who understands both the Tod&#x27;s speech and his mode of thought. Rowf, by contrast, &quot;can&#x27;t understand a word he says,&quot; distrusts his &quot;sly, sneaking&quot; ways, and believes that the Tod is taking advantage of his strength to provide himself with easy meals in return for advice without which Rowf feels he and Snitter would be better off. For a while the trio survive reasonably comfortably, the dogs killing sheep and fowls under the Tod&#x27;s guidance, but eventually the dogs&#x27; indiscreet ways drive him away, which together with the onset of winter marks the start of a much tougher phase of the dogs&#x27; fight for survival. In the book, when Rowf drives him away, the Tod meets Snitter whilst being pursued by a local foxhunt. As the pack of foxhounds closes in on the Tod, he tells Snitter to run, giving him a final positive message for Rowf. The Tod is overtaken and killed by the hounds. The Tod&#x27;s death is not explicitly depicted, although one of the huntsmen is described as holding up his body and tossing it to the hounds.
*Digby Driver: A newspaper reporter for the fictional &quot;London Orator&quot;. He is an amoral, self-centred man, writing wildly sensationalist articles with only the sketchiest grounding in fact and using blackmail to extort background information about bio-weapon research at ARSE. The media hysteria he creates causes panic among the local populace and eventually moves the government to deploy the army to exterminate the dogs. He redeems himself when he receives a letter from Snitter&#x27;s hospitalized master and brings him from the hospital to the centre of the action in the nick of time to meet the boat returning the dogs to land and assert his legal claim as Snitter&#x27;s owner, thus saving the dogs from summary execution by the waiting soldiers.
*Dr. Boycott: A senior researcher at ARSE who was in charge of the experimental programme which involved Rowf. He is callous and unfeeling, with no sympathy for either the animals in his experiments or his subordinate, Stephen Powell. His inept handling of the situation arising from the dogs&#x27; escape serves both to antagonize the local farmers, who are losing sheep to the dogs, and to provide grist to Digby Driver&#x27;s mill despite his efforts to do the opposite.
*Stephen Powell: Dr. Boycott&#x27;s subordinate, somewhat nervous and fearful of his chief, and evidently possessed of sympathy for his experimental charges which he dares not express for fear of being regarded as an unsound scientist by him. It appears that his original motivation for working in an area which he evidently finds uncomfortable was to help find a cure for the mysterious disease from which his daughter Stephanie is slowly dying, but he has ended up being assigned to totally unrelated research and his main motivation now is simply to maintain a stable home in an area where his daughter is happy (i.e., the Lake District). Eventually, his conscience gets the better of him during a pointless sensory deprivation experiment on a monkey. He steals the monkey and takes it home, quits his job, and plans to get local employment as &quot;a teacher or something.&quot; Early in the story he is given a lift by Digby Driver and, not realizing that he is a reporter, chats freely about his work in response to Driver&#x27;s questioning. The repercussions of this inadvertent leak are another factor in his decision to quit his job.
*Dr. Goodner: A researcher at ARSE carrying out secret bio-weapon research for the Ministry of Defence. He is German by birth and was a &quot;researcher&quot; in Buchenwald during the Second World War, but has managed to conceal this information. Digby Driver finds out about Goodner&#x27;s past through contacts at the &quot;Orator&quot; and uses the information to blackmail him into revealing details of his research, specifically that he was researching the bubonic plague, which Driver uses as the foundation of his sensationalist scaremongering. The name &quot;Goodner&quot; is at one point revealed to be an anglicized form of &quot;Geutner&quot; – which is also the surname of the main female character in the original version of Adams&#x27;s next novel &quot;The Girl in a Swing&quot;.
*Harry Tyson: The odd-job man at ARSE, in charge of feeding and cleaning the animals and general care-taking duties. It is his neglecting to close Rowf&#x27;s cage properly that allows the dogs to escape, but he successfully conceals his mistake by sabotaging the catch of the cage before anyone notices the missing animals.
*Geoffrey Westcott: A local bank clerk who is something of a recluse, disdaining human relationships in favor of accumulating finely crafted technological artifacts. While returning from a grocery shopping trip with his landlady in his Volvo P1800, he stops for toilet purposes, and while both humans are out of the car the dogs suddenly appear, invade the car and devour all the shopping. His anger at the violation of his prized car leads him on a solitary one-man crusade to destroy the dogs, and he falls to his death from the top of Dow Crag while attempting a difficult shot at Rowf, whom he had spotted on the screes below. The dogs are by now starving, snowfall having removed the sheep from the fells and cut off their main food source, and they devour Westcott&#x27;s body. The discovery of the mutilated corpse allows Digby Driver to whip up media hysteria to new heights. His role of falling off a cliff in the film was taken by a bounty hunter named Ackland, who was hired by Dr. Boycott to take out the dogs.
*David Ephraim: A Jewish businessman who organizes a hunt for the dogs. It is implied he is a Holocaust survivor, and suffers from frequent bouts of depression. He encounters Snitter by himself during the hunt, and although he prepares to shoot him, he notices the surgical scar on the dog&#x27;s head and is moved to tears because it is implied that it reminds him of the medical experiments conducted at Auschwitz. Setting his gun aside, he tries to get Snitter to come get into his car. But when Snitter excitedly jumps up into his arms, his toe catches the trigger of Ephraim&#x27;s shotgun. Because Ephraim had taken the safety catch off upon seeing Snitter, and forgotten to put it back on when setting the weapon aside, Snitter&#x27;s toe catching the trigger causes the gun to off in Ephraim&#x27;s face, killing him instantly. Snitter is traumatized by the incident, and Ephraim&#x27;s death catches the attention of the media, who run with the story of the &quot;dog who shot a man.&quot;
*Alan Wood: Snitter&#x27;s master. He is a gentle, kindly man, in late middle age, working as a solicitor. He is somewhat untidy in matters of housekeeping, which he deems unimportant, and seems to have little social life, but is devoted to Snitter. For most of the book, Snitter believes him to be dead — killed in an accident as he saved Snitter from being run over by a truck after the dog ran onto the road. Snitter reminisces fondly and wistfully about his life with his master, gradually working up to the traumatic events of the accident, wracked by guilt because he believes himself responsible for his master&#x27;s death. Near the end of the story, it is revealed that Wood survived the accident and is recovering slowly in a hospital. He had been told by his sister that Snitter has run off and cannot be found; he is horrified when he eventually sees a report in the &quot;Orator&quot; and realizes the truth. He writes to Digby Driver, who is overcome with guilt for his actions and takes him from the hospital to the scene of the action just in time to ensure a happy ending. Wood asserts his legal claim as Snitter&#x27;s owner and takes in Rowf as well.
*Ann Moss: Alan Wood&#x27;s sister, referred to by him, and therefore Snitter also, as Mrs. Annie Mossity — a pun on &quot;&quot;. She is a domineering woman, and it is implied that her husband ran off without the formalities of a divorce because he could not stand her anymore. She is disdainful of her brother&#x27;s easygoing, untidy ways and has hated Snitter since she first met him. To her falls the responsibility of looking after Snitter after Wood&#x27;s road accident, which she discharges by selling him to ARSE, buying fur-lined boots and gloves with the proceeds, and lying to Alan to cover her misdeeds. She is interviewed by Digby Driver midway through the book, and is successful in falsely confirming Driver&#x27;s assumption that her brother is dead. When Driver finds out about the truth, he confronts Moss and interrogates her. Moss reveals her whereabouts and Driver helps Wood find Snitter and Rowf.
*William Harbottle: Also known as &quot;Hot Bottle Bill&quot; by his civil servants, is a British Cabinet Minister who serves as Secretary of State for the Environment. It is implied that he and his civil servants were responsible for having ARSE established in Lawson Park. When Rowf and Snitter begin killing sheep, the farmers realize that the dogs were from the lab and figure that if the media can discredit the lab, they can embarrass the Secretary of State. After Digby Driver publishes the rumors of the dogs supposedly carrying the plague, Harbottle tries to protect his political career by attempting to address the situation to the public and implementing Operation Gelert via deploying a battalion of the Parachute Regiment to hunt down the dogs. When the dogs were rescued and reunited with Alan Wood, Harbottle and his senior civil servant, the Under Secretary, arrive to have the dogs shot, but the warden of the Drigg Nature reserve forces him to leave, telling him that he has no right to be there and that it&#x27;s illegal to bring guns into the nature reserve.
*The Under Secretary: Harbottle&#x27;s senior civil servant who was responsible for having ARSE set up in Lawson Park. When he and Harbottle prepare to have the dogs shot after they were rescued from sea, the warden of the Drigg Nature Reserve and Digby Driver confront them and force them to leave as Rowf chases them away.
*Kiff: Rowf and Snitter&#x27;s former friend who was mentioned several times throughout the book. It is stated that he had black and white fur and was a friend of Rowf and Snitter. Unfortunately, he was taken away by the scientists and was sentenced to death by cumulative electrocution.
*Dr. Fortescue: A researcher at ARSE who was responsible for Snitter&#x27;s brain operations via merging his conscious and subconscious mind, which results in him suffering from hallucinations and seizures. It is implied that Fortescue&#x27;s reasons for his experiments on Snitter is to determine if the effects would bear any similarities to the circumstances of the titular character from William Golding&#x27;s novel &quot;Pincher Martin&quot;.

==Adaptations==
Like its predecessor &quot;Watership Down&quot;, Martin Rosen directed and adapted &quot;The Plague Dogs&quot; into an animated feature film, which was released in 1982. Unlike the book, there is the implication that the Tod might still be alive in the film; a hunter who found him says he and the others &quot;caught&quot; a fox, this could imply the Tod is merely playing dead. In contrast to the ending in all published editions of the book—which describes the dogs being rescued from the sea, cleared of carrying the plague, and united with Snitter&#x27;s lost master—the film ends the way Adams first envisioned (before being prevailed upon by his editor and others who read his original manuscript), with the dogs swimming out to sea, hoping to find what Snitter calls &quot;The Isle of Dog&quot; in the novel (though Rowf grimly speculates that it&#x27;s probably the Isle of Man). After swimming for a while, Snitter eventually comes to the conclusion that he imagined the island. As he is about to give up and drown, Rowf claims to directly see the island and they struggle on. It then ends with them disappearing into the mist, supposedly heading to the island. In the film&#x27;s credits an island can be seen in the distance, seemingly confirming that it is real.

<text>The Congress of Deputies () is the lower house of the , Spain&#x27;s legislative branch, the upper house being the Senate. The Congress meets in the Palace of the Parliament () in Madrid.

Congress has 350 members elected from fifty-two constituencies (the fifty provinces and two autonomous cities) using closed list D&#x27;Hondt proportional representation. Deputies serve four-year terms. The presiding officer and speaker is the President of the Congress of Deputies, who is elected by the members at the first sitting of Congress after an election.

The two principal bodies in Congress are parliamentary groups and parliamentary committees (). All MPs are required to be members of a parliamentary group, the institutionalised form of political parties. Groups act with one voice represented by their spokesperson. In other words, the Spanish Parliament is a parliament of groups, not individual MPs who are constrained to act only as part of the group. MPs can only act autonomously when submitting oral or written questions.

As a result of the 2019 general election, there were 168 female deputies or 48% of all members, making Spain the European country with the highest percentage of women in parliament, surpassing Sweden and Finland.

== Constitutional position ==
=== House makeup ===
==== Composition ====
Section 68.1 of the Spanish Constitution establishes that the Congress of Deputies must be composed of at least 300, and no more than 400 deputies. At present, the house has 350 deputies which is determined by the 1985 &quot;Electoral Act&quot;.

==== Electoral system ====

The Spanish Constitution establishes that the deputies are chosen by universal, free, equal, direct, and secret suffrage. The election is held every four years or earlier in case of snap election. The members of the Congress are elected by proportional representation with closed lists in each constituency.

There are 52 constituencies for the Congress of Deputies corresponding to the 50 provinces of Spain and two autonomous cities (Ceuta and Melilla). According to Spanish electoral law, the number of seats in each constituency can change in each election and it is specified when writs of election are issued. Each province is guaranteed a minimum allocation of two seats, and one seat each for Ceuta and Melilla for a total of 102 seats. The remaining 248 seats are allocated proportionally according to the population using the Hare quota.

After the General Election, seats are assigned to the electoral lists in each constituency separately, using the D&#x27;Hondt method; parties receive seats in approximate proportion to the number of votes each received in the constituency. A strictly proportional system would result in fractional seats; the D&#x27;Hondt method resolves this by favoring parties receiving larger votes.

For provinces that elect at least 24 deputies, the 1985 Electoral Act establishes a 3% minimum valid votes by constituency requirement (blank votes count towards the total votes, but invalid ballots do not count) for a party to participate in the seat distribution for a constituency. At present, this condition applies only to Madrid and Barcelona.

In March 2011, the Electoral Act was modified to require parties that are not represented either in Congress or in the Senate to collect signatures to support their candidacy to be able to run in the election. One-tenth of a percent of those registered to vote in a constituency are required to be on the ballot and each citizen can sign only once for a party candidacy. The Electoral Board establishes the regulations for the collection of signatures.

==== Mandate ====
The deputies&#x27; term of office finishes four years after their election or when the Cortes are dissolved, which can take place jointly or separately with the dissolution of the Senate. Only the Monarch can dissolve Parliament on the request of the President of the Government after the deliberation of the Council of Ministers. The dissolution of the Cortes also takes place if there is a failed legislature or two months after a failed investiture session, in this case, the Sovereign dissolves the house with the countersign of the President of the Congress of Deputies. During their mandate, the deputies have some guarantees and privileges to carry their responsibilities out according to Section 97 of the Spanish Constitution.

=== Bodies of the Congress ===

Exercising the autonomy recognised by the Constitution to the Congress of Deputies, the house is regulated by some internal rules established by itself in 1982 and it configures different government bodies to carry the pertinent competencies out.

==== Governing bodies ====
The governing bodies of the Congress of Deputies are the bodies which under their authority the House is manage. Those bodies are the President, the Bureau and the Board of Spokespersons.

The President of the Congress of Deputies is the highest authority and it represents the House and it is, de facto, the whole parliament leader. As head of the Congress, it also chairs the Bureau, the Board of Spokespersons and the Permanent Deputation, and is the maximum responsible authority of the Congress&#x27;s Police.

The Bureau of the Congress of Deputies is the collective body that represents the House and manages the day-to-day of the Chamber, preparing the budget and making all the necessary decisions to allow the proper functioning of the functions of the Congress.

The Board of Spokespersons of the Congress of Deputies is the collective body formed by representatives of the parliamentary groups and normally, government representatives, that establishes the agenda of the House.

==== Working bodies ====
The working bodies of the Congress of Deputies are the Plenary, the Committees, the Permanent Deputation and the Parliamentary Groups.

The Plenary is the central body of the Congress of Deputies which allows the house to exercise their choices. It is the sitting of all the members of the Parliament when half plus one of its members are attending the house. This body represents the unity of the house and it works through the plenary sessions which can be ordinary or extraordinary.

The ordinary sessions take place during the two meeting terms: September to December and February to June. The extraordinary sessions are convened at the request of the Prime Minister of Spain, the Permanent Council or the absolute majority of the house. In this kind of session a particular agenda is presented, and the session ends when all items have been discussed.

The Committees are the basic working bodies of the Congress designed to facilitate the work of the house. The committees have the same powers as the Plenary: to legislate by delegation of the plenary or at the request of the Bureau, and to check the Government by requesting information of the Administration or by requesting the appearance of any member of the Government or Administration.

There are two types of committees: standing and non-standing. The standing committees are defined by the Congress&#x27;s standing orders and non-standing committees, created by the Plenary. The standing committees examine bills and make amendments. The Plenary of the Congress can confer upon them full legislative power in relation to a matter, so they can approve or reject any bill. There are 23 permanent (standing) legislative committees and 8 permanent (standing) non-legislative committees which have responsibilities for House administration. The Plenary can create additional non-legislative committees at the beginning of each legislature. The non-standing committees are created with a specific purpose and their themes and duration are determined by the Plenary.

The members of the committees are chosen by the Parliamentary Groups with the number of members proportional to the number of seats in the House, which means they are not effective checks on the Government when the party in office has a parliamentary majority. Once the committees are created they must elect in their first meeting the bureau of the committee, composed of a chair, two deputy chairs and two secretaries. In practice, the largest party always enjoys a clear over-representation in the distribution of chairpersons.

Subcommittees can also be created by the Plenary at the request of the committees. There are two types of subcommittees, the ordinary subcommittees, the purpose of which is to discuss and report on a specific issue, and the reporting subcommittees, the purpose of which is to write a draft bill to be discussed in the committee. The members of the subcommittees are designated by the committee.

The Permanent Deputation is a body created in order to have a permanent constituted legislative power. It is responsible for safeguarding the powers of the house between the legislative sessions (January, July and August) or when their term has finished because of termination or dissolution. In these three cases, the Permanent Deputation is a temporary extension of the house. The Permanent Deputation is presided by the President of the Congress. It is composed of a proportional number of deputies depending on the numerical importance of the different Parliamentary Groups.

All members of the house are assigned to one of the Parliamentary Groups reflecting their party affiliation or ideology. The formation of the parliamentary groups takes place at the beginning of each legislature. The deputies (members) who cannot satisfy the rules for forming a group are placed together in their own group (called the Mixed Group) so that they can still participate in the functions of Parliament.

== Composition of the XV legislature ==
The XV legislature of Spain started on 17 August 2023 when the were constituted, once the 2023 general election was held.

==Congress of Deputies building==
The building, &quot;Palacio de las Cortes&quot;, has a neoclassical style. It was designed by Narciso Pascual Colomer, and built between 1843 and 1850. It sits by the Carrera de San Jerónimo, in Madrid. The relief on the facade by sculptor Ponciano Ponzano centers on a sculpture of Spain embracing the constitutional state, represented by a woman with her arm around a young girl. Surrounding the pair are figures that represent in allegorical form Justice and Peace, Science, Agriculture, Fine Arts, Navigation, Industry, Commerce and so on. Ponzano also executed two bronze lions for the building&#x27;s access stairway in a more realistic manner.

<text>The Senate () is the upper house of the , which along with the Congress of Deputies – the lower chamber – comprises the Parliament of the Kingdom of Spain. The Senate meets in the Palace of the Senate in Madrid. The presiding officer of the Senate is the president of the Senate, who is elected by the members at the first sitting after each national election.

The composition of the Senate is established in Part III of the Spanish Constitution. Each senator represents a province, an autonomous city or an autonomous community. Each mainland province, regardless of its population size, is equally represented by four senators; in the insular provinces, the larger islands are represented by three senators and the minor islands are represented by a single senator. Likewise, the autonomous cities of Ceuta and Melilla elect two senators each. This direct election results in the election of 208 senators by the citizens. In addition, the regional legislatures also designate their own representatives, one senator for each autonomous community and another for every million residents, resulting in a total of 58 additional senators.

The Spanish Senate is constitutionally described as a territorial chamber. Consequently, although in general its powers are similar to those of the Congress of Deputies, it is endowed with exceptional powers such as authorising the Government to apply direct rule to a region or to dissolve local government councils.

Intensive debates about reforming the Senate&#x27;s function and purpose have been going on for many years without any resolution.

==History==

The first Spanish Constitution, the Spanish Constitution of 1812, established a unicameral legislative, therefore, an upper Chamber did not exist.

The Senate was first established under the Royal Statute of 1834 approved by Queen Regent Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies under the denomination of House of Peers but it did not last long and in 1837, under the Constitution of that year, the upper house acquired the denomination of Senate.

It remained under the regimes of the constitutions of 1845, 1856, 1869 and 1876. It was composed, at that latter time, of three main categories: senators by their own right, senators for life and elected senators. This house, along with the Congress of Deputies, was suppressed after the coup of General Miguel Primo de Rivera in 1923.

After the restoration of democracy during the Second Spanish Republic (1931-1939) the new regime opted for a unicameral system, which was continued under the Francoist dictatorship.

Only after the Spanish transition to democracy in 1977 was it re-established.

==Role==
The Spanish parliamentary system is bicameral but asymmetric. The Congress of Deputies has more independent functions, and it can also override most Senate measures. Only the Congress can grant or revoke confidence in the Prime Minister.

Either house may propose an ordinary law (or bill, ). A bill passed by Congress can be amended or vetoed by the Senate in which case the bill is then sent back to the lower house, which can override these objections by an absolute majority vote. Organic laws, which govern basic civil rights and regional devolution, need an absolute majority of both congress and senate to pass.

The process for constitutional amendments is more complicated: the rule is to require a three fifths (60%) of both houses, but if the Senate does not achieve such a supermajority and a joint congress-senate committee fails to resolve the issues, the Congress may force the amendment through with a two-thirds vote as long as an absolute majority of the Senate was in favour. But for some specific types of amendments including those related to most clauses related to human rights, both houses must approve of the amendment by a two thirds vote, and an election must be held and the amendment must pass by a two thirds vote a second time, and if that is approved, the people must vote for the amendment in a referendum by majority vote.

The Senate has certain exclusive functions including
* the appointment of constitutional posts, such as judges of the Constitutional Court or the members of the General Council of the Judiciary;
* disciplining regional governments. It exercised this power in October 2017 over the region of Catalonia. This decision gave to prime minister Mariano Rajoy the power to remove the regional government and to dissolve the regional legislature, and govern directly from Madrid.
* suspending local governments. It exercised this power in April 2006, dissolving the Marbella city council when most of its members were found to have engaged in corrupt practices.

Senate reform has been a topic of discussion since the early days of Spanish democracy.
One proposal would advance the federalization of Spain by remaking the Senate to represent the autonomous communities of Spain.

==Organization==

Senators form groups along party lines. Parties with fewer than ten senators form the Mixed Group. If the membership of an existing group falls below six during a session, it is merged into the Mixed Group at the next session. For example, Coalición Canaria lost its senate caucus in 2008 after electoral losses reduced its group from six to two. The Basque Nationalist Party, falling from seven to four, &quot;borrowed&quot; senators from the ruling Socialist Party to form their group; in exchange, they supported the election of socialist Javier Rojo as President of the Senate.

Legally, 133 seats are required for an absolute majority, vacant seats notwithstanding.
==Elections to the Senate==

To date, senate elections have coincided with elections to the lower house, but the prime minister may advise the king to call elections for one house only. While the Congress of Deputies is chosen by party list proportional representation, the members of the senate are chosen in two distinct ways: popular election by limited voting and appointment from regional legislatures.

===Directly elected members===
Most members of the senate (currently 208 of 266) are directly elected by the people. Each province elects four senators without regard to population. Insular provinces are treated specially. The larger islands of the Balearics (Baleares) and Canaries (Canarias)—Mallorca, Gran Canaria, and Tenerife—are assigned three seats each, and the smaller islands—Menorca, Ibiza–Formentera, Fuerteventura, Gomera, Hierro, Lanzarote and La Palma—one each; Ceuta and Melilla are assigned two seats each.
This allocation is heavily weighted in favor of small provinces; Madrid, with its 6.5 million people, and Soria, with 90,000 inhabitants, are each represented by four senators.

In non-insular constituencies, each party nominates three candidates. Candidates&#x27; names are organized in columns by party on a large (DIN A3 or larger) ochre-colored ballot called a &quot;sábana&quot; or &quot;bedsheet&quot;.

Each voter may mark up to three candidates&#x27; names, from any party. This is the only occasion when Spanish voters vote for individuals rather than a party list. Panachage is allowed, but typically voters cast all three votes for candidates of a single party. As a result, the four senators are usually the three candidates from the most popular party and the first placed candidate from the next most popular.

Before 2011, a party could not choose the order of its candidates on the ballot paper; candidates were sorted alphabetically by surname. When a party did not get all three of its candidates elected, this arrangement favored candidates with surnames early in the alphabet. This was the case for 2nd placed parties in every province and for both parties in tight races when voters did not vote for three candidates of the same party (panachage).
===Regional legislatures-appointed members===

The legislative assembly of each autonomous community of Spain appoints a senators to represent the community, with one senator per one million citizens, rounded up. Demographic growth increased the combined size of the regional appointed senators from 51 to 57 since 1983.

Conventionally, the proportions of the regional senators mimic their legislative assemblies. However, autonomous communities have considerable leeway, and a motion to appoint the regional senators often requires no more than a plurality:

==Composition==
The last election was held on 23 July 2023. Following the election, the composition of the 15th Senate was:

<text>The  (; FCI; ) is the largest international federation of national kennel clubs and purebred registries. The FCI is based in Thuin, Belgium and has 98 members and contract partners (one from each country).

==History==
The FCI was founded in 1911 under the auspices of the kennel clubs of Austria, Belgium, France, Germany and the Netherlands. Its objective was to bring global uniformity to the breeding, exhibiting and judging of pure-bred dogs. It was disbanded in World War I and recreated in 1921 by Belgium and France. Since its foundation the FCI&#x27;s membership has grown to include kennel clubs from the majority of countries worldwide, with members in Europe as well as Africa, the Americas, Asia and Oceania.

== Function ==
The purpose of the FCI is to make sure that the pedigrees and judges are mutually recognised by all the FCI member countries. In contrast to national kennel clubs, the FCI is not a registry and does not issue pedigrees to individual dogs, with the issue of pedigrees and record keeping of breeders and breeder addresses the responsibility of the national canine organisations recognised by the FCI.

At present the FCI recognises 356 breeds, with each breed being considered as the &#x27;property&#x27; of a specific country, usually based upon the country where the breed has first originated. These breed &#x27;owner&#x27; countries write the breed standard of the specific breed, with the breed standard being a detailed description of the ideal type of the breed, in partnership with and under the oversight of the Standards and Scientific Commissions of the FCI. The FCI is responsible for publication and maintenance of these breed standards, along with the translation of breed standard into the four working languages of the FCI (English, French, German and Spanish). The FCI breed standards act as the reference for the judges at shows held in the FCI member countries, as well as maintaining the qualification and license of judges in dog shows in FCI member countries. For breeders, the FCI breed standards are used as the reference in their attempt to produce top-quality dogs according to the ideal type as set out by the FCI.

The FCI is considered to the largest kennel club in the world with only Africa and the Middle East poorly represented, partly through the absence of national kennel clubs or purebred registries in countries of these regions. In Europe, only the United Kingdom, Kosovo and Bulgaria are not represented by the FCI. Likewise, in the Americas only the USA and Canada are not members.

The official purebred registries in North America that are not members or contract partners of FCI include the American Kennel Club (AKC), Canadian Kennel Club (CKC) and United Kennel Club (UKC), and in Europe, The Kennel Club (TKC) of the United Kingdom. Despite not being members or associates, the FCI has a long standing agreement (or &#x27;Letter of Agreement&#x27;) for mutual recognition of pedigrees under outlined circumstances, and cooperation between the FCI and the AKC, TKC and the CKC of the USA, United Kingdom and Canada respectively. In addition, the TKC and the FCI have agreements regarding the mutual recognition of judges. In contrast, the FCI does not recognise the UKC and no agreement is in place.

According to AKC&#x27;s Denise Flaim, crafting a workable standard is a challenge, and the &quot;FCI standards typically have a greater number of disqualifications, which are sometimes subjective, and their impact on a dog&#x27;s career is not as dire.&quot; In contrast, the FCI takes a stronger line on certain issues compared with some non-member national kennel clubs, particularly the AKC and UKC, regarding general animal health and welfare. Unlike the AKC and UKC, the FCI has moved towards banning the practices of ear cropping and tail docking in breed standards, as well as forbidding the entry of dogs with cropped ears and dock tails from being shown in dogs shows in FCI member countries. In addition, the FCI takes a stronger stance on improving the health of dogs as opposed to the appearance of dogs in situations where a breed&#x27;s health is impacted due to severely restricted gene pools, or concerning brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome.

==Breeds==
The FCI automatically recognises all registered breeds recognised by any of its member kennel clubs, therefore its list of recognised dog breeds includes breeds not known outside of their country of origin. The FCI divides the breeds it recognises into ten groups based on various discriminators such as appearance or role:
# Sheepdogs and cattle dogs (except Swiss cattle dogs)
# Pinschers and schnauzers - molossoid breeds - Swiss mountain and cattle dogs and other breeds
# Terriers
# Dachshunds
# Spitz and primitive types
# Scenthounds and related breeds
# Pointers and setters
# Retrievers - flushing dogs - water dogs
# Companion and toy dogs
# Sighthounds

==FCI members==

The FCI has members, associates and partners in 98 countries.

<doc id="352264" wikidata="Q277355" url="?curid=352264" title="Regent honeyeater">
<text>The regent honeyeater (Anthochaera phrygia) is a critically endangered bird endemic to southeastern Australia. It is commonly considered a flagship species within its range, with the efforts going into its conservation having positive effects on many other species that share its habitat. Recent genetic research suggests it is closely related to the wattlebirds.

==Taxonomy==
First described by the English naturalist George Shaw in 1794, the regent honeyeater was moved to &quot;Anthochaera&quot; in 1827 by the naturalists Nicholas Aylward Vigors and Thomas Horsfield. It was known as &quot;Xanthomyza phrygia&quot; (Zanthomiza by Gregory Mathews)for many years, the genus erected by William Swainson in 1837. DNA analysis shows that its ancestry is in fact nested within the wattlebird genus &quot;Anthochaera&quot;. The ancestor of the regent honeyeater split from a lineage that gave rise to the red and yellow wattlebirds. The little and western wattlebirds arose from another lineage that diverged earlier.
The generic name &quot;Anthochaera&quot; derives from the Ancient Greek &quot;anthos&quot; &#x27;flower, bloom&#x27; and &quot;khairō&quot; &#x27;enjoy&#x27;; the specific epithet &quot;phrygia&quot; derives from Latin &quot;phrygius&quot;, referring to the people of Phrygia who were skilled in embroidery with gold.

== Description ==
The neck and head are glossy black. The breast is covered with contrasting pale yellow speckles, and the feathers in the tail and wings are black and bright yellow.

=== Diet ===
It feeds primarily on nectar from eucalyptus and mistletoe species, and to a lesser extent on insects and their honeydew. It also feeds on both native and cultivated fruit.

=== Breeding ===
Breeding mostly occurs from August to January, during the southern spring and summer. The breeding season appears to correspond with the flowering of key eucalyptus and mistletoe species. Two or three eggs are laid in a cup-shaped nest. Nest success, and productivity of successful nests, has been found to be low in this species, with nest surveillance revealing high predation by a range of bird and arboreal mammal species. There is also a male bias to the adult sex ratio, with an estimated 1.18 males per female.

==Distribution==

The regent honeyeater was once common in wooded areas of eastern Australia, especially along the inland slopes of the Great Dividing Range. It once could be found as far west as Adelaide, but is now gone from South Australia and western Victoria. their range covers from north-east Victoria up to around the Sunshine Coast, Queensland, but the population is now scattered. Most sightings are from a few sites in north-eastern Victoria, along the western slopes of the Great Dividing Range in New South Wales and the central coast of New South Wales. In 1999 the three main breeding areas were the Bundarra-Barraba area and Capertee Valley of New South Wales, and north-eastern Victoria.

Most of these breeding sites were affected by the devastating 2019–2020 Australian bushfires, which will likely have a very negative effect on the already-small wild population.

===Important Bird Areas===
BirdLife International identified the following sites as being important for regent honeyeaters in 2011:

; Queensland
* Traprock

; New South Wales
* Brisbane Water
* Bundarra-Barraba
* Capertee Valley
* Greater Blue Mountains
* Hastings-Macleay
* Hunter Valley
* Lake Macquarie
* Mudgee-Wollar
* Richmond Woodlands
* Tuggerah

; Victoria
* Warby-Chiltern Box-Ironbark Region

In July and August 2018, pairs of birds were seen at three sites in south-eastern Queensland. A spokesman for BirdLife Australia said this was indicative of the current drought conditions in northern New South Wales placing pressure on the birds to find more favourable food sources.

==Conservation status==
The regent honeyeater is listed as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List, and was listed as endangered under both Australia&#x27;s &quot;Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999&quot; (EPBC Act)and Queensland&#x27;s &quot;Nature Conservation Act 1992&quot;. The &quot;Action Plan for Australian Birds 2010&quot;, compiled by researchers from Charles Darwin University, and published in October 2011 by the CSIRO, added the regent honeyeater to the &quot;critically endangered&quot; list, giving habitat loss as the major threat.

The bird was upgraded from endangered to critically endangered nationally (under the EPBC Act) on 9 July 2015. Each state has applied its own rating to the bird under state legislation, varying from &quot;threatened&quot; (Victoria) to &quot;critically endangered&quot; (NSW).

The Commonwealth Department of the Environment formulated a National Recovery Plan for the regent honeyeater in April 2016. The 2019-2020 fires would likely push the species closer to extinction, with only about 250 of the species left in the wild at that time.

A 2018 study ranked it seventh in a list of Australian birds most likely to go extinct.

A genetic study published in 2019 used hybridization RAD (hyRAD) technique on recent and museum samples from wild birds ranging over a 100-year time frame sampled throughout the historical and contemporary range, and assessing the impact of the decline on recent and current population size, structure and genetic diversity. The museum sampling showed that population structure in regent honeyeaters was historically low, which remains the case despite severe fragmentation of their breeding range. Extinction may occur in this nomadic species before a detectable genomic impact of small population size is realised.

A March 2021 research study warned that the rapid decline in the rare songbird means its young are struggling to learn mating calls as adults disappear, which could further strain conservation efforts and avoid extinction. The complexity of their songs have declined, and 12 per cent of males were found to be singing other species&#x27; songs, including the currawong and eastern rosella. According to one of the authors of the study, this loss of song can reduced the birds&#x27; ability to find a mate, and, if they do, the female is less likely to lay an egg.

===Conservation efforts===
A captive breeding program on a private property in the Hunter Valley released 20 birds – 11 female and 9 male – into the wild in June 2020. In 2012, birds had been released in the same area from a Taronga Zoo breeding program. Much work was being done to ensure that the birds had sources of food, and most of the birds were fitted with tiny radio transmitters so that their movements could be tracked. With about 13 wild birds at the site, it was hoped that those released from captivity would breed with the wild ones and increase the population and diversity. This was the first release of regent honeyeaters since a similar event in north-eastern Victoria. In August 2020, one of the banded birds was spotted and photographed at a Hunter Valley home, for the first time since her release two months earlier. Another of the birds was found and led the conservationists to a new flock of wild regent honeyeaters near Broke, about from the release site, of which they had not previously been aware.

<text>The &quot;V&quot; sign is a hand gesture in which the index and middle fingers are raised and parted to make a &quot;V&quot; shape while the other fingers are clenched. It has various meanings, depending on the circumstances and how it is presented.

When displayed with the palm inward toward the signer, it can be an offensive gesture in some Commonwealth nations (similar to showing the middle finger), dating back to at least 1900. When given with the palm outward, it is to be read as a victory sign (&quot;&quot;V&quot; for &quot;Victor&quot;y&quot;); this usage was introduced in January 1941 as part of a campaign by the Allies of World War II, and made more widely known by Winston Churchill. During the Vietnam War, in the 1960s, the &quot;&quot;V&quot; sign&quot; with palm outward was widely adopted by the counterculture as a symbol of peace and still today in the United States and worldwide as the &quot;peace sign&quot;. 

==Usage==
The meaning of the &quot;V&quot; sign is partially dependent on the manner in which the hand is positioned.

Where the palm of the hand is facing inward toward the signer (i.e. the back of the hand faces the observer), this is seen as insulting gesture in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United Kingdom.

With the palm outward toward the observer, it can mean &quot;victory&quot;, in a setting of wartime or competition. This was first popularised in January 1941 by Victor de Laveleye, a Belgian politician in exile, who suggested it as a symbol of unity in a radio speech and the subsequent &quot;V for Victory&quot; campaign by the BBC. It is sometimes made using both hands with upraised arms as United States president Dwight Eisenhower and, in imitation of him, Richard Nixon, used to do. This sign came to mean &quot;peace&quot; or &quot;friend&quot;, used around the world by peace and counter-culture groups; popularized in the American peace movement of the 1960s. The commonality with the symbol&#x27;s use from the 1940s was its meaning the &quot;end of war&quot;.

In American Sign Language, the number 2 is signalled with two fingers raised and the palm towards the signer, the letter V with the palm away, and the ordinal &quot;second&quot; with the sign palm forward before being turned (yawing) until the palm faces backward. General finger-counting systems use either facing for the number 2.

The V shape is also used in a number of signs in many sign languages, including (in American Sign Language) &quot;to look&quot; (with the palm down) or &quot;to see&quot; (palm up). When the pointer and middle fingers are pointed at the signer&#x27;s eyes then turned and the pointer finger is pointed at someone it means &quot;I am watching you.&quot;

V-signs in motion are used in air quotes, flexing the fingers, palm out, of one or both hands.

==As an insult==

The insulting version of the gesture (with the palm inward ) is often compared to the offensive gesture known as &quot;the finger&quot;. The &quot;two-fingered salute&quot; (also &quot;the forks&quot; in Australia) is commonly performed by flicking the V upwards from wrist or elbow. The V sign, when the palm is facing toward the person giving the sign, has long been an insulting gesture in the United Kingdom, and later in Ireland, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. It is frequently used to signify defiance (especially to authority), contempt, or derision. It was known in Canada with the meaning &quot;&quot; as late as to the generation which fought in World War II, perhaps because of their familiarity with the Victory sign throughout the war years. However, subsequent generations seldom use it, and its meaning in this sense is becoming increasingly unknown in Canada.

As an example of the &quot;V&quot; sign (palm inward) as an insult, on 1 November 1990, &quot;The Sun&quot;, a British tabloid, ran an article on its front page with the headline &quot;Up Yours, Delors&quot; next to a hand making a V sign protruding from a Union Jack cuff. The article attracted complaints about alleged Francophobia, which the Press Council rejected after the newspaper stated that the paper reserved the right to use vulgar abuse in the interests of Britain.

On 3 April 2009, Scottish association football players Barry Ferguson and Allan McGregor were banned from the Scotland national squad for showing the V sign while sitting on the bench during the game against Iceland. Both players had been drinking alcohol in their hotel bar after a defeat to The Netherlands until around 11 am the next morning, meaning that both of the players breached the SFA discipline code before the incident as well, but the attitude shown by the V sign was considered to be so rude that the SFA decided to exclude those players from the national team. Their club side Rangers fined both Ferguson and McGregor, and removed the club captaincy from Ferguson, as a result of the controversy. McGregor&#x27;s ban was lifted by Scotland manager Craig Levein in 2010 and he returned to the Scottish national squad.

Steve McQueen gives the sign in the closing scene of the 1971 motorsport film, &quot;Le Mans&quot;. A still picture of the gesture was recorded by photographer Nigel Snowdon and has become an icon of both McQueen and the film itself.

For a time in the UK, &quot;a Harvey (Smith)&quot; became a way of describing the insulting version of the V sign, much as &quot;the word of Cambronne&quot; is used in France, or &quot;the Trudeau salute&quot; is used to describe the one-fingered salute in Canada. This happened because, in 1971, show-jumper Harvey Smith was disqualified for making a televised V sign to the judges after winning the British Show Jumping Derby at Hickstead. His win was reinstated two days later. Harvey Smith pleaded that he was using a Victory sign, a defence also used by other figures in the public eye.

Sometimes overseas visitors to the countries mentioned above use the &quot;two-fingered salute&quot; without knowing it is offensive to the natives, for example when ordering two beers in a noisy pub, or in the case of the United States president George H. W. Bush, who, while touring Australia in 1992, attempted to give a &quot;peace sign&quot; to a group of farmers in Canberra—who were protesting about U.S. farm subsidies—and instead gave the insulting V sign.

===Origins===
A commonly repeated legend claims that the two-fingered salute or V sign derives from a gesture made by longbowmen fighting in the English army at the Battle of Agincourt (1415) during the Hundred Years&#x27; War, but no written historical primary sources support this contention. This origin legend states that English archers believed that those who were captured by the French had their index and middle fingers cut off so that they could no longer operate their longbows, and that the V sign was used by uncaptured and victorious archers in a display of defiance against the French. In conflict with this origin myth, the chronicler Jean de Wavrin, contemporary of the battle, reported that Henry V mentioned in a pre-battle speech that the French were said to be threatening to cut off &quot;three&quot; fingers (not two) from captured bowmen. Neither Wavrin nor any contemporary author reported the threat was ever carried out after that nor other battles, nor did they report anything concerning a gesture of defiance.
The first unambiguous, attested evidence of the use of the insulting V sign in the United Kingdom dates to 1901, when a worker outside Parkgate Ironworks in Rotherham used the gesture (captured on the film) to indicate that he did not like being filmed.

Peter Opie interviewed children in the 1950s and observed in &quot;The Lore and Language of Schoolchildren&quot; (1959) that the much-older thumbing of the nose (cocking a snook) had been replaced by the V sign as the most common insulting gesture used in the playground.

Between 1975 and 1977, a group of anthropologists including Desmond Morris studied the history and spread of European gestures and found the rude version of the V-sign to be basically unknown outside the British Isles. In his &quot;Gestures: Their Origins and Distribution&quot;, published in 1979, Morris discussed various possible origins of this sign but came to no definite conclusion:

==Victory sign==
=== Second World War: V for Victory campaign ===
On 18 May 1939, the French daily, &quot;Le Monde Quotidien&quot; had a headline of, &#x27;V pour victoire&#x27;. On 14 January 1941, Victor de Laveleye, former Belgian Minister of Justice and director of the Belgian French-language broadcasts on the BBC (1940–44), suggested in a broadcast that Belgians use a V for &#x27; (French: &quot;victory&quot;) and &#x27; (Dutch: &quot;freedom&quot;) as a rallying emblem during the Second World War.

In the BBC broadcast, de Laveleye said that &quot;the occupier, by seeing this sign, always the same, infinitely repeated, [would] understand that he is surrounded, encircled by an immense crowd of citizens eagerly awaiting his first moment of weakness, watching for his first failure.&quot; Within weeks chalked up Vs began appearing on walls throughout Belgium, the Netherlands and Northern France. Buoyed by this success, the BBC started the &quot;V for Victory&quot; campaign, for which they put in charge the assistant news editor Douglas Ritchie posing as &quot;Colonel Britton&quot;. Ritchie suggested an audible V using its Morse code rhythm (three dots and a dash). As the rousing opening bars of Beethoven&#x27;s Fifth Symphony had the same rhythm, the BBC used this as its call-sign in its foreign language programmes to occupied Europe for the rest of the war. The more musically educated also understood that it was the Fate motif &quot;knocking on the door&quot; of Nazi Germany.
(). The BBC also encouraged the use of the V gesture introduced by de Laveleye.

By July 1941, the emblematic use of the letter V had spread through occupied Europe. On 19 July, Prime Minister Winston Churchill referred approvingly to the V for Victory campaign in a speech, from which point he started using the V hand sign. Early on he sometimes gestured palm in (sometimes with a cigar between the fingers). Later in the war, he used palm out. After aides explained to the aristocratic Churchill what the palm in gesture meant to other classes, he made sure to use the appropriate sign. Yet the &quot;double-entendre&quot; of the gesture might have contributed to its popularity, &quot;for a simple twist of hand would have presented the dorsal side in a mocking snub to the common enemy&quot;. Other allied leaders used the sign as well.

The Germans could not remove all the signs, so they adopted the V Sign as a German symbol, sometimes adding laurel leaves under it, painting their own V&#x27;s on walls, vehicles and adding a massive V on the Eiffel Tower.

In 1942, Aleister Crowley, a British occultist, claimed to have invented the usage of a V-sign in February 1941 as a magical foil to the Nazis&#x27; use of the swastika. He maintained that he passed this to friends at the BBC, and to the British Naval Intelligence Division through his connections in MI5, eventually gaining the approval of Winston Churchill. Crowley noted that his 1913 publication &quot;Magick (Book 4)&quot; featured a V-sign and a swastika on the same plate.

===Vietnam War, victory, and peace===

Protesters against the Vietnam War (and subsequent anti-war protests) and counterculture activists in the 1960s adopted the gesture as a sign of peace. Because the hippies of the day often flashed this sign (palm out) while saying &quot;Peace&quot;, it became popularly known (through association) as &quot;the peace sign&quot;.

==As a photography pose==

===Japan===
The V sign, primarily palm-outward, is very commonly made by Japanese people, especially younger people, when posing for informal photographs, and is known as , or more commonly simply . As the name reflects, this dates to the Vietnam War era and anti-war activists, though the precise origin is disputed. The V sign was known in Japan from the post-World War II Allied occupation of Japan, but did not acquire the use in photographs until later.

In Japan, it is generally believed to have been influenced by Beheiren&#x27;s anti-Vietnam War activists in the late 1960s and a Konica camera advertisement in 1971. A more colorful account of this practice claims it was influenced by the American figure skater Janet Lynn during the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo, Hokkaidō. She fell during a free-skate period, but continued to smile even as she sat on the ice. Though she placed third in the competition, her cheerful diligence and persistence resonated with many Japanese viewers. Lynn became an overnight foreign celebrity in Japan. A peace activist, Lynn frequently flashed the V sign when she was covered in Japanese media, and she is credited by some Japanese for having popularized its use since the 1970s in amateur photographs.

===Elsewhere===

In the United States, the usage of the V sign as a photography gesture is known but not widely used.

The original poster for the 2003 film &quot;What a Girl Wants&quot; showed star Amanda Bynes giving a V sign as an American girl visiting London. In the US, the poster was altered to instead show Bynes with both arms down, to avoid giving the perception that the film was criticizing the then-recently commenced Iraq War.

===Risks===
In addition to the risks due to different interpretations of the V-sign in different cultures, it has been suggested that fairly close photographs of palm-out V-signs may be a security risk, as people&#x27;s fingerprints can be clearly identified, allowing misuse. At a distance of 1.5m or less, 100% of a fingerprint can be captured, and 50% at up to 3m. Criminals could copy the fingerprint to use with door-access and payment systems. It is also possible for law enforcement to identify people this way; Carl Stewart was arrested in 2021 after police identified his fingerprints in an image he shared on EncroChat. Sufficiently detailed fingerprint information could only be harvested in &quot;very demanding&quot; conditions; to check that a V-sign photograph is not a security risk, it could be examined at high zoom.

==Specific uses==
* In Argentina, the V sign, besides &quot;victory&quot;, is linked to the political movement of Peronism, associated with the return of Juan Domingo Perón to Argentina from exile in 1973.
* In South Africa, after the Nationalist Party won the 1948 election with fewer voters than the opposition, Vs appeared as graffiti representing the word &quot;Volkswil&quot; (will of the people) and thereby questioning the results.
* In Tamil Nadu, a state of India, it refers to the political Party AIADMK.
* The Kendall Motor Oil brand logo has been using the V sign since 1928 to signify becoming the first Pennsylvania refiner to offer a highly refined product good for 2,000 miles.
* University of Southern California, University of Virginia, The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, and Villanova University students, alumni, and fans &quot;throw their Vs up&quot; by tradition and as a sign of pride in their university and its athletic teams. The V sign in this form frequently accompanies the motto &quot;Fight On!&quot; at USC.
* The V sign, especially when printed in green, is a sign of the Iranian Green Movement.
* Following the first elections in Iraq after the U.S. invasion, a photo of a woman showing the V sign with one of her fingers dipped in purple ink became very well-known and was widely circulated. The ink is used to identify individuals who have already voted.
* In the Philippines, the symbol was associated with the Marcos family when Ferdinand Marcos Sr. used the gesture during his four presidential campaigns. His son and namesake, President Bongbong Marcos, his electoral alliance, and his supporters used the &quot;V sign&quot; gesture as the official identity of their political campaign during the 2022 presidential elections. 
* In Poland, during the Solidarity movement, protesters showed the V sign meaning they would defeat Communism. After partially free elections, when Tadeusz Mazowiecki was chosen as prime minister (24 August 1989), he went to the MPs with the V sign, which was transmitted on TV. It is sometimes shown during debates about the fall of Communism.
* In Romania, the sign represents victory and has been used as an extension of the Roman salute to announce that victory has been achieved. It was used heavily during the Romanian revolution after the ousting of Nicolae Ceaușescu. Mircea Dinescu appeared in the first transmission of Romanian Television after the revolutionaries occupied it, shouting &quot;We won!&quot; and flashing the victory sign.
* During the Yugoslav Wars, Croatian and Bosnian troops and paramilitary militia used the sign as a greeting or an informal salute. U.S. and NATO peacekeepers stationed in Bosnia were forbidden from using the V-sign (victory symbol) to avoid upsetting or offending Serbs they might encounter.
* In Vietnam, the V sign means &quot;hello&quot; since the Vietnamese word for the number &quot;2&quot; (&quot;&quot;) sounds like the English pronunciation of the greeting &quot;hi&quot;.
* Ringo Starr of the Beatles uses the V sign extensively while using the phrase &quot;Peace and Love&quot; as a sort of catchphrase.
* A vulgar gesture signifying cunnilingus is to put the V sign with the fingers on either side of the mouth (usually with the knuckles facing the observer) and to stick the tongue out. Most of the time the tongue is wriggled around.
* A partially obscured V sign can be added to someone else&#x27;s head to produce devil&#x27;s horns or &quot;bunny ears&quot; for an amusing photo. In September 2013, Manu Tuilagi apologised to Prime Minister David Cameron after making a &quot;bunny ears&quot; sign behind his head in a photo taken during a visit by the British and Irish Lions squad to Downing Street.
* In Indonesia, candidate of the 2014 Indonesian presidential election Joko Widodo used the sign for a political campaign. The V sign in Indonesia is called &quot;Salam Dua Jari&quot;.
* In Belgium, the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) political party uses it as a rallying gesture. During the taking the oath of the actual Belgian federal government, three N-VA ministers used the V sign instead of the formal three-fingers sign.
* In Turkey, using the Victory sign can lead to a prosecution and conviction if it is shown, because in Turkey the sign is associated with the PKK if used by Kurds.
* On the six-month anniversary of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, a sculpture giving an inward-facing V-sign, which the BBC described as &quot;the &#x27;up yours&#x27; sign&quot;, was displayed in front of the Russian embassy in Prague.
* The V sign was used by many protestors during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre

<text>Saalfeld-Rudolstadt is a &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) in the south of Thuringia, Germany. Neighboring districts are (from the north clockwise) the districts Weimarer Land, Saale-Holzland, Saale-Orla, the district Kronach in Bavaria, and the districts Sonneberg, Hildburghausen and Ilm-Kreis.

==History==
The district dates back to the &quot;Landratsamt&quot; Saalfeld, which was created in 1868, and in 1922 it was converted into the &quot;Landkreis&quot;. Also in 1922 the district Rudolstadt was created, the second historical root of the district as of today. Both districts were merged in the communal reform of 1994.
==Geography==
The main river in the district is the Saale. The highest elevation is 827 m above sea level near Piesau, and the lowest, at 169 m, is in the Saale river valley near Niederkrossen.

==Coat of arms==
As Saalfeld was the capital of the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, the Saxon coat of arms is displayed in the top-right and bottom-left quarter of the coat of arms. The other two quarters show the coat of arms of the Princes of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt. The double-headed imperial eagle is the symbol for the title as imperial prince, the comb in bottom symbolizes the title of Imperial Stable Master held by the princes.

<text>In the theory of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), Lyapunov functions, named after Aleksandr Lyapunov, are scalar functions that may be used to prove the stability of an equilibrium of an ODE. Lyapunov functions (also called Lyapunov’s second method for stability) are important to stability theory of dynamical systems and control theory. A similar concept appears in the theory of general state-space Markov chains usually under the name Foster–Lyapunov functions.

For certain classes of ODEs, the existence of Lyapunov functions is a necessary and sufficient condition for stability. Whereas there is no general technique for constructing Lyapunov functions for ODEs, in many specific cases the construction of Lyapunov functions is known. For instance, quadratic functions suffice for systems with one state, the solution of a particular linear matrix inequality provides Lyapunov functions for linear systems, and conservation laws can often be used to construct Lyapunov functions for physical systems.

== Definition ==
A Lyapunov function for an autonomous dynamical system

:formula_1

with an equilibrium point at formula_2 is a scalar function formula_3 that is continuous, has continuous first derivatives, is strictly positive for formula_4, and for which the time derivative formula_5 is non positive (these conditions are required on some region containing the origin). The (stronger) condition that formula_6 is strictly positive for formula_4 is sometimes stated as formula_6 is &quot;locally positive definite&quot;, or formula_9 is &quot;locally negative definite&quot;.

===Further discussion of the terms arising in the definition===
Lyapunov functions arise in the study of equilibrium points of dynamical systems. In formula_10 an arbitrary autonomous dynamical system can be written as

:formula_11

for some smooth formula_12

An equilibrium point is a point formula_13 such that formula_14 Given an equilibrium point, formula_15 there always exists a coordinate transformation formula_16 such that:

:formula_17

Thus, in studying equilibrium points, it is sufficient to assume the equilibrium point occurs at formula_18.

By the chain rule, for any function, formula_19 the time derivative of the function evaluated along a solution of the dynamical system is

:formula_20

A function formula_21 is defined to be locally positive-definite function (in the sense of dynamical systems) if both formula_22 and there is a neighborhood of the origin, formula_23, such that:

:formula_24

== Basic Lyapunov theorems for autonomous systems==
Let formula_25 be an equilibrium point of the autonomous system
:formula_26
and use the notation formula_27 to denote the time derivative of the Lyapunov-candidate-function formula_28:
:formula_29

===Locally asymptotically stable equilibrium===
If the equilibrium point is isolated, the Lyapunov-candidate-function formula_28 is locally positive definite, and the time derivative of the Lyapunov-candidate-function is locally negative definite:
:formula_31
for some neighborhood formula_32 of origin, then the equilibrium is proven to be locally asymptotically stable.

===Stable equilibrium===
If formula_28 is a Lyapunov function, then the equilibrium is Lyapunov stable. The converse is also true, and was proved by José Luis Massera.

===Globally asymptotically stable equilibrium===
If the Lyapunov-candidate-function formula_28 is globally positive definite, radially unbounded, the equilibrium isolated and the time derivative of the Lyapunov-candidate-function is globally negative definite:
:formula_35
then the equilibrium is proven to be globally asymptotically stable.

The Lyapunov-candidate function formula_36 is radially unbounded if
:formula_37
(This is also referred to as norm-coercivity.)

==Example==
Consider the following differential equation on formula_38:

:formula_39

Considering that formula_40 is always positive around the origin it is a natural candidate to be a Lyapunov function to help us study formula_41. So let formula_42 on formula_43. Then,

:formula_44

This correctly shows that the above differential equation, formula_45 is asymptotically stable about the origin. Note that using the same Lyapunov candidate one can show that the equilibrium is also globally asymptotically stable.

<doc id="352275" wikidata="Q238970" url="?curid=352275" title="Banana Yoshimoto">
<text>is the pen name of Japanese writer . From 2002 to 2015, she wrote her name in hiragana ().

==Biography==
Yoshimoto was born in Tokyo on July 24, 1964, and grew up in a progressive family. Her father was the poet and critic Takaaki Yoshimoto, and her sister, , is a well-known cartoonist in Japan.

Yoshimoto graduated from Nihon University&#x27;s College of Art with a major in literature. While there, she adopted the pseudonym &quot;Banana&quot;, after her love of banana flowers, a name she recognizes as both &quot;cute&quot; and &quot;purposefully androgynous.&quot;

Yoshimoto keeps her personal life guarded and reveals little about her certified rolfing practitioner husband, Hiroyoshi Tahata, or son (born in 2003). Each day she takes half an hour to write at her computer, and she says, &quot;I tend to feel guilty because I write these stories almost for fun.&quot; Between 2008 and 2010, she maintained an online journal for English-speaking fans.

==Writing career==
Yoshimoto began her writing career while working as a waitress at a golf club restaurant in 1987.

Her debut work, &quot;Kitchen&quot; (1988), had over 60 printings in Japan alone. There have been two film adaptations: a Japanese TV movie and a more widely released version titled &quot;Wo ai chu fang&quot;, produced in Hong Kong by Ho Yim in 1997.

In November 1987, Yoshimoto won the 6th Kaien Newcomer Writers Prize for &quot;Kitchen&quot;; in 1988, the novel was nominated for the Mishima Yukio Prize, and in 1989, it received the 39th Minister of Education&#x27;s Art Encouragement Prize for New Artists. In 1988 (January), she also won the 16th Izumi Kyōka Prize for Literature, for the novella &quot;Moonlight Shadow&quot;, which is included in most editions of &quot;Kitchen&quot;.

Another one of her novels, &quot;Goodbye Tsugumi&quot; (1989), received mixed reviews and was made into a 1990 movie directed by Jun Ichikawa.

==Publications==
Her works include twelve novels and seven collections of essays (including &quot;Pineapple Pudding&quot; and &quot;Song From Banana&quot;) which have together sold over six million copies worldwide. Her themes include love and friendship, the power of home and family, and the effect of loss on the human spirit.

In 1998, she wrote the foreword to the Italian edition of the book &quot;Ryuichi Sakamoto. Conversazioni&quot; by musicologist Massimo Milano.

In 2013, Yoshimoto wrote the serialized novel, &quot;Shall We Love?&quot; (僕たち、恋愛しようか?), for the women&#x27;s magazine &quot;Anan&quot;, with singer-actor Lee Seung-gi as the central character. The romance novel was the first of her works to feature a Korean singer as the central character.

==Writing style==
Yoshimoto says that her two main themes are &quot;the exhaustion of young Japanese in contemporary Japan&quot; and &quot;the way in which terrible experiences shape a person&#x27;s life&quot;.

Her works describe the problems faced by youth, urban existentialism, and teenagers trapped between imagination and reality. Her works are targeted not only to the young and rebellious, but also to grown-ups who are still young at heart. Yoshimoto&#x27;s characters, settings, and titles have a modern and American approach, but the core is Japanese. She addresses readers in a personal and friendly way, with warmth and outright innocence, writing about the simple things such as the squeaking of wooden floors or the pleasant smell of food. Food and dreams are recurring themes in her work which are often associated with memories and emotions. Yoshimoto admits that most of her artistic inspiration derives from her own dreams and that she&#x27;d like to always be sleeping and living a life full of dreams.

She named American author Stephen King as one of her first major influences and drew inspiration from his non-horror stories. As her writing progressed, she was further influenced by Truman Capote and Isaac Bashevis Singer. Also manga artist Yumiko Ōshima was an inspiration.

==Awards==
In 1987, Yoshimoto won the Kaien Newcomer Writers Prize, for &quot;Kitchen&quot;. In 1988, she was awarded the 16th Izumi Kyōka Prize for Literature, for &quot;Moonlight Shadow&quot;. The following year, she earned two more accolades: the 39th Minister of Education&#x27;s Art Encouragement Prize for New Artists (for the fiscal year of 1988), for &quot;Kitchen&quot; and &quot;Utakata/Sanctuary&quot;, and the 2nd Yamamoto Shūgorō Prize, for &quot;Goodbye Tsugumi&quot;. In 1995, she won the 5th Murasaki Shikibu Prize for &quot;Amrita&quot;, her first full-length novel. And in 2000, she received the 10th Bunkamura Deux Magots Literary Prize, for &quot;Furin to Nambei&quot;, a collection of stories set in South America.

Outside Japan, she has been awarded prizes in Italy: the Scanno Literary Prize in 1993, the Fendissime Literary Prize in 1996, the Literary Prize Maschera d&#x27;Argento in 1999, and the Capri Award in 2011.

&quot;The Lake&quot; was longlisted for the 2011 Man Asian Literary Prize.

<doc id="352276" wikidata="Q19684" url="?curid=352276" title="River Teme">
<text>The River Teme (pronounced ; ) rises in Mid Wales, south of Newtown, and flows southeast roughly forming the border between England and Wales for several miles through Knighton before entering England in the vicinity of Bucknell and continuing east to Ludlow in Shropshire. From there, it flows to the north of Tenbury Wells on the Shropshire/Worcestershire border on its way to join the River Severn south of Worcester. The whole of the River Teme was designated as an SSSI by English Nature in 1996.

The river is crossed by a number of historic bridges including one at Tenbury Wells that was rebuilt by Thomas Telford following flood damage in 1795. It is also crossed, several times, by the Elan aqueduct.

==Etymology==
The first known mention of the River Teme is in an eleventh-century manuscript containing a copy of a charter from around 770, where the name takes the forms &quot;Tamede&quot; and &quot;Temede&quot;. This name is similar to those of many other rivers in England - testament to their ancient origin - including River Team, River Thames, River Thame, River Tame and River Tamar. Scholars now believe that these and the older names Temese and Tamesis derive from Brythonic &quot;Tamesa&quot;, possibly meaning &#x27;the dark one&#x27;.

==Geography==

The river source is in Mid Wales, on the western side of Bryn Coch in the hills near the village of Kerry, Dolfor to the south of Newtown, Powys. Two other rivers - the River Ithon and the River Mule - rise within 500 metres. It is roughly coincident with the border between England and Wales for several miles downstream from the Powys village of Felindre, passing Beguildy, Lloyney and Knucklas on the Powys side and Llanfair Waterdine on the Shropshire side before flowing past the small Powys town of Knighton. It continues to shadow the border eastwards as far as the vicinity of Bucknell and Brampton Bryan. 

The Teme is joined by the River Clun at Leintwardine in north Herefordshire, then embarks on a circuitous course southeast then northeast to Bromfield, where it is joined by the River Onny. From there to its confluence with the River Severn, about 40 miles/65 km downstream at Worcester, it flows through the counties of Herefordshire, Shropshire and Worcestershire. The upper reaches of the river are usually steep with fast flowing but relatively shallow waters. There are some water mills, and a number of weirs, including several at the historic town of Ludlow. Below Tenbury Wells the river is more tranquil but still shallow, with strong cross currents. 

During its journey the river flows over Upper Ludlow shales and Devonian sandstones. Water levels in the Teme are highly variable, something which has been made worse in recent years through increases in water extraction for agriculture use. However, the Teme has also often burst its banks too. June and July 2007 saw serious floods in a number of areas, including Leintwardine, Tenbury Wells and Ludlow, although the watercourse that flooded the last location was a tributary, the River Corve. The Lower Teme has a deep channel cut in a wide alluvial plain across which it meanders. It responds rapidly to rainfall and cut-offs have been numerous along the river&#x27;s course, where backchannels and old oxbows can clearly be seen.

The River Corve flows into the Teme just outside Ludlow and the Ledwyche Brook flows into the Teme at Burford, close to the Herefordshire/Shropshire/Worcestershire tripoint. The Kyre Brook flows into the Teme at Tenbury Wells, and the River Rea flows into the Teme at Newnham Bridge, Worcestershire, a few miles south of Cleobury Mortimer.

The Teme is the second largest tributary to the River Severn, falling from a height of about 450 metres above sea level at its source to just 14 metres above sea-level at its downstream confluence. A Site of Special Scientific Interest throughout its length, it is a clean river and after many years of decline the population of otters is recovering, but obstructions keep salmon numbers at a low level.

==Recreational use==

===Fishing===

Fishing is a popular sport on many parts of the River Teme, with its barbel fishing being particularly noted.

===Leisure boating===
Leisure boats have long been used on the river and rowing boats can still be hired at The Linney Park, Ludlow. An annual coracle regatta has been held on the Teme. In June 2005 it was held at Leintwardine. In June 2006, the 12th regatta was held at Mortimer&#x27;s Cross

A Countryside Agency report in September 2003 entitled &quot;Improving access for canoeing on inland waterways: A study of the feasibility of access agreements&quot; stated:
Information on canoeing on the Teme in the Ludlow area is available here and on the Tenbury Wells to Broadwas area here.

===Leisure boating in the past===
Historical evidence of leisure boating mentions in Victorian publications. Old maps show a few boat houses along the river in Worcestershire. &quot;Billings Directory 1855&quot; mentions Boat House, evidently a farmhouse, five miles downstream of Tenbury Wells, and Boat House Farm still exists in Eastham. In addition, the boathouse at Newnham Bridge (three miles downstream of Tenbury Wells) was large enough, and substantial enough, to be converted later into a house.

At Tenbury Wells in 1886, people were rescued during floods using a boat that had broken loose from its mooring so there must have been at least one boat on the river at that time. The guide, &quot;Tenbury Wells and the Teme Valley&quot; includes a photograph taken at Little Hereford described as &quot;Boating on the Teme in 1905&quot;. The author mentions two gentlemen from Oxford who in 1894 travelled up the Teme from Worcester to Ludlow in 17.5 hours, and returned (downstream) in 9 hours. Another book, &quot;Down Along Temeside&quot;, includes an account of travelling by boat from Ludford Mill to Orleton (a couple of miles upstream of Stanford Bridge) in the early 20th century.

Up at Leintwardine, a &#x27;Teme coracle&#x27; has been locally made since the late 1980s and such craft may have been in existence earlier, near the start of that century - or earlier still, as a distant successor to the coracles once used to transport lead down to Worcester from Dre-fach Felindre in Roman times.

==Travel==

===Navigation to Powick Mill===
The final from Powick bridge and Mill to its confluence with the river Severn that the Teme is (or was) navigable. There was a coal wharf near Powick Bridge, belonging with the mill, whose owner had the right to use a towing path to the river Severn. In the 18th century, pig iron was brought up the river to Powick forge (as the mill then was). In 1810 it was reported that &quot;The Teme is also navigable for barges from its junction with the Severn near Powick upwards to a small distance above Powick Bridge. The river having considerable declivity its navigation is soon interrupted by shoals and shallows&quot;

===Above Powick Mill===

Except for its lowest reaches, there is no substantial evidence that the river was navigable by barges. Claims have been made that traffic on the Teme began in Roman times and &quot;continued in Norman times, when it is known the stone for the mill at Ashford Carbonel was brought from Caen in the 14th century, using water transport all the way&quot;. However no unequivocal documentary or archaeological evidence has been adduced in support of this.

William Sandys who between 1636 and 1639 made the Avon navigable from Tewkesbury to Stratford-upon-Avon was at the same time also authorised to improve the Teme between Worcester and Ludlow. There is however no evidence that he did so, perhaps due to his having used up all his resources on the Avon. Having failed to recover the Avon after the Restoration, Sir William Sandys and his son undertook work on the Wye and Lugg.

Ferries formerly existed at Rochford, at Cotheridge and at Clifton on Teme. Some very local navigation is indicated by a newspaper advertisement in 1750 that the miller at Stanford-on-Teme had a boat for sale, capable of carrying 10 tons. However, with no locks available, this vessel would have been unable to pass mill weirs.

Pictures, allegedly of Ludlow or its castle with a river and boats (thought to date from c. 1830), such as a painting allegedly of Dinham Bridge, Ludlow, are probably at least partly derived from the artist&#x27;s imagination.

This subject was debated at length in 2006 in the Journal of Railway and Canal Historical Society.

===Railway lines===
A school inspector in the mid-19th century, wishing to visit the endowed school at Shelsley Beauchamp where the Teme turns to run south through wooded hills, found that he must travel there on horseback in the absence of either coaches or railway. There had, indeed, been a slightly earlier proposal for a railway line that followed the lower course of the river. Under the name of the Worcester, Tenbury and Ludlow Railway, this was submitted to Parliament in November 1846, but by 1849 the scheme had been wound up.

More or less the same course was proposed for the Teme Valley Railway in 1866. This was planned as a link between a line from Worcester to South Wales, that in the end was never built, and the recently opened Tenbury and Bewdley Railway, from which there was a connection to Ludlow via the Shrewsbury and Hereford Railway. Lacking funds or any particular need for such a line through sparsely settled agricultural land, however, the plan came to nothing.

==In the arts==
A river that changes from season to season, not to mention having changed course over the years, coexists with the land that encloses it. In the eyes of those who have painted the Teme, it has often been features on its banks which were their main subjects – nowhere more so than at Ludlow Castle, where the river is only incidentally pictured flowing at its base by Samuel Scott and David Cox. For his 1800 view of the castle, Joseph Mallord William Turner preferred to place Dinham Bridge crossing the river in the foreground, while Edmund John Niemann looked down on another bridge into the town from the high ground above.
The 18th century landowner Richard Payne Knight had his grounds at Downton Castle, not far away on the banks of the Teme, laid out in the picturesque style of the time, and there the river was incorporated into the design, notably at the ‘alpine bridge’ which he commissioned Thomas Hearne to portray among other views of the site. In the following century, George Price Boyce was noted for the Pre-Raphaelite precision of his landscape paintings, some of which featured the high banks of the river. Later on, Worcester-born Harry William Adams (1868–1947) painted the Teme&#x27;s lower reaches, specialising in atmospheric effects such as a snow scene above the valley or overhanging woodland at sunset.

The river has had its poets too. Richard Gardner, who terms himself &#x27;the poet of the Teme&#x27; on the title page of his volume of &quot;Poems&quot; (Worcester, 1825), &quot;hopes you will consider him to rank among the first uneducated poets&quot; when reading his topographical tributes to his chosen river. A few years later an anonymous Ludlow poet submits &quot;the production of a young man…to the public with becoming deference&quot;, including among them a &quot;Sonnet to the River Teme&quot;. 

A. E. Housman made only a passing mention of the river&#x27;s name in &quot;A Shropshire Lad&quot;, but that ensured its incorporation into the song cycle &quot;Ludlow and Teme&quot; (1923) when Ivor Gurney set some of the poems to music. However, the musician who received his greatest inspiration from the Teme was Edward Elgar, whose favourite spot on the river was at Knightwick. It was there that he composed much of &quot;The Dream of Gerontius&quot;; and childhood reminiscences of the Teme, he also said, were contained in the trio in the second movement of his first symphony.

<text>Brigadier General Alexander Gore Arkwright Hore-Ruthven, 1st Earl of Gowrie, (; 6 July 1872 – 2 May 1955) was a British Army officer who served as the 10th Governor-General of Australia, in office from 1936 to 1945. He was previously Governor of South Australia (1928–1934) and Governor of New South Wales (1935–1936).

Gowrie was born in Windsor, Berkshire, England, into a minor aristocratic family. He joined a voluntary Yeomanry unit at the age of 17, and then enlisted in the regular army at the age of 19. Gowrie fought in the Sudan during the Mahdist Revolt, and was awarded the Victoria Cross for saving a wounded Egyptian soldier. He later served in the Somaliland campaign and as an aide-de-camp to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. During the First World War, Gowrie commanded units in the Gallipoli campaign and on the Western Front, winning several further honours. He finished his military career with the rank of brigadier-general.

In 1928, Gowrie was appointed Governor of South Australia. His handling of political instability during the Great Depression was highly regarded, and when his term expired he was appointed Governor of New South Wales. However, Gowrie&#x27;s second governorship lasted little more than a year, as Joseph Lyons recommended him to become Governor-General. As well as the stresses of the Second World War, he faced several constitutional challenges, including Lyons&#x27; death in office and the defeat of Arthur Fadden&#x27;s government on a confidence motion. Gowrie&#x27;s term in office was prolonged as a result of war, and in total he spent nine years in the position, the longest of any governor-general.

==Early life and background==
Alexander Hore-Ruthven was born on 6 July 1872 in Windsor, Berkshire, England, United Kingdom, as the second son of Walter Hore-Ruthven, 9th Lord Ruthven of Freeland, (1838–1921), much later created also Baron Ruthven of Gowrie, and Lady Caroline Annesley Gore (1848–1914), a daughter of the 4th Earl of Arran. After attending Winton House School in Winchester (not Winchester College, as is stated in some sources) as a boarder from 1884 to 1885, Hore-Ruthven spent most of his later education at Eton College and then Haileybury and Imperial Service College, where he stayed until 1888, when he was withdrawn owing to eyesight problems and sent into business by his parents. He first worked in a tea merchant&#x27;s office in Glasgow and then traveled to British India to work on a tea plantation in Assam Province. Hore-Ruthven, however, soon succumbed to malaria and he returned to England in 1892.

==Military career==

On 19 October 1889, Hore-Ruthven was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Lanarkshire Yeomanry Cavalry. After his return to England in 1892, he then joined the Regular Army. Following training at the United Services College, he was commissioned on 27 April 1893 as a lieutenant in the 3rd Battalion of the Highland Light Infantry, and was promoted to captain on 18 November 1896. During the Mahdist War, he was mentioned in despatches.

During the action at Gedarif on 22 September 1898, Hore-Ruthven performed an act of courage, which earned him the Victoria Cross:

*28 February 1899 – Captain the Honourable A.G. A. Hore-Ruthven, 3rd Battalion, Highland Light Infantry
In May 1899, Hore-Ruthven was also awarded the Order of Osmanieh, Fourth Class, by the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire for his services in the Sudan. On 17 May, he received a regular commission as a second lieutenant in the Queen&#x27;s Own Cameron Highlanders, dropping back two ranks. In late November, he was part of a Camel Corps during the operations leading to the defeat of the Khalifa (mentioned in despatches 25 November 1899). Promoted to supernumerary lieutenant on 14 December 1900, vice a Lieutenant Murdoch killed in action, he fought in the Somaliland campaign between 1903 and 1904, and was promoted to a regular lieutenancy on 16 April 1904.

In 1905, Hore-Ruthven became an aide-de-camp to Lord Dudley, then Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. Transferring to the 1st (King&#x27;s) Dragoon Guards in 1908, he was promoted to supernumerary captain in that regiment on 11 April, regaining his former rank after nine years. In 1908, Dudley was appointed Governor-General of Australia, and Hore-Ruthven went with him as military secretary. He left Australia in 1910 and returned to military service in India.

On 2 April 1915, Hore-Ruthven transferred to the Welsh Guards and was promoted to major from the same date. He was appointed a GSO 1 on 18 January 1916, with the temporary rank of lieutenant-colonel, and was awarded the DSO on 1 January 1916. He was awarded a Bar to his DSO on 2 April 1919; the citation reads as follows:

He was promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant colonel on 15 October 1917 and appointed to the general staff as a temporary brigadier-general on 26 December. On 1 January 1918, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG). He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) on 3 June.

During the First World War, he served in France and at Gallipoli, where he was severely wounded and mentioned in despatches five times. He finished the war as a brigadier general and commanded British forces in Germany between 1919 and 1920. On 14 December 1920, he was appointed the CO of his regiment, with the temporary rank of colonel, and was promoted to colonel on 5 July 1922 (seniority from 15 October 1921).

 After this he held various Army staff positions, and received command of a brigade on 1 October 1924 in the temporary rank of colonel-commandant, which had replaced the rank of brigadier-general. He relinquished this position, as well as his temporary rank, in April 1928. He was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG, 24 January 1928) and appointed Governor of South Australia (being sworn in on 14 May 1928).

==Governor of South Australia==
Hore-Ruthven arrived in Adelaide in May 1928. He took to his duties with enthusiasm and visited many areas of the State in a de Havilland DH.60 Moth owned by his ADC, Captain Hugh Grosvenor. Together with Lady Hore-Ruthven, he was a keen supporter of the Boy Scout and Girl Guide movements. She was also president of the South Australian Red Cross.

In a 1930 Anzac Day speech, Hore-Ruthven criticised the union movement for exacerbating, through strike action, the hardship suffered by returned servicemen. He was censured by the United Trades and Labour Council in response.

He was on leave in London when the third Bodyline Test cricket match in Adelaide caused Anglo-Australian political tension in 1933, and played a significant part in smoothing relations through his meetings with the British Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs J.H. Thomas.

During Hore-Ruthven&#x27;s second term as governor, the Great Depression was causing severe hardship in South Australia. The Lionel Hill government, elected on a promise of bringing a &quot;golden future&quot;, was heavily criticised when economic realities forced it to adopt austerity measures. Hore-Ruthven supported Premier Hill in the face of criticism from within the Labor Party. His speeches frequently expressed the belief that a premier should &quot;rise above party&quot;. Hill&#x27;s firm resolve during the crisis was seen as largely the result of Hore-Ruthven&#x27;s influence. His performance during the crisis was reportedly a critical factor in his subsequent selection as Governor of New South Wales.

==Governor of New South Wales==

His term as Governor of South Australia ended in April 1934, and he returned to England. He was almost immediately appointed Governor of New South Wales and at the suggestion of Prime Minister Joseph Lyons was also raised to the peerage as Baron Gowrie, of Canberra in the Commonwealth of Australia and of Dirleton in the County of East Lothian. He arrived in Sydney on 21 February 1935. However he had already been approached by George V regarding appointment as Governor-General while in England (after the 2nd Marquess of Linlithgow, son of the inaugural governor-general Lord Hopetoun, declined the post). He was raised to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG) on 20 December 1935.

==Governor-General of Australia==
With his military record and experience, Gowrie was seen as an obvious choice to succeed Sir Isaac Isaacs when he retired as Governor-General in 1936. In accordance with established practice Prime Minister Joseph Lyons was offered several alternatives, but Lyons had no intention of recommending another Australian to the post. At the time, non-Labor Prime Ministers always appointed British Governors-General. In accordance with Australian constitutional practice, he was formally appointed by George V, who died on 20 January 1936, three days before Gowrie was due to be sworn in as Governor-General. Thus, he came to office during the reign of Edward VIII.

In office, Gowrie was a popular if unobtrusive figure in Australia. The days that Governors-General exercised significant power, or even participated in negotiations between the Australian and British governments, had now passed, but Gowrie set a precedent in 1938, when he toured the Netherlands East Indies at the invitation of the colonial administration. That was the first time that a Governor-General had represented Australia abroad.

In April 1939 Lyons died suddenly and Gowrie commissioned Sir Earle Page, the leader of the Country Party, as caretaker Prime Minister until Lyons&#x27; United Australia Party could choose a new leader. This was the only circumstance in which the Governor-General still had some personal discretion.

Gowrie&#x27;s political skills were tested again after the 1940 election. The Coalition lost its majority, leaving the UAP Prime Minister, Robert Menzies, dependent on the votes of independents Alexander Wilson and Arthur Coles to stay in power. When the UAP forced Menzies out as leader, it was so bereft of leadership that Country Party leader Arthur Fadden was named Prime Minister, even though the UAP was the senior coalition partner. However, Wilson and Coles were so outraged at how Menzies had been treated that they joined Labor in voting against Fadden&#x27;s budget and brought the government down. Gowrie was reluctant to call an election for a Parliament just over a year old, especially given the international situation. However, he saw no alternative unless Labor leader John Curtin had enough support to govern. Gowrie&#x27;s therefore summoned the two independents to Yarralumla and made them promise that if he commissioned Curtin as Prime Minister, they would support him and end the instability in government. The independents agreed, and Gowrie duly appointed Curtin. After some initial uneasiness perhaps inevitable with two such contrasting characters, the vice-regal aristocrat and the tough ALP boss got on well.

During the Second World War, Gowrie saw it as his duty to support the government, the British Empire, and the troops. He supported efforts to encourage the troops, including opening service personnel recreation huts at St Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral and the Showgrounds for the Church of England National Emergency Fund. In 1943, he undertook a four-week tour of inspection of Allied Defence Forces in northern Australia and New Guinea. Shortly before undertaking this tour, Gowrie and his wife had learned that their son, Patrick, had been killed in Libya the previous year.

Gowrie officially opened the Australian War Memorial on 11 November 1941.

Gowrie&#x27;s term ended in September 1944 after which he returned to Britain, where he was created Viscount Ruthven of Canberra, of Dirleton in the County of East Lothian, and Earl of Gowrie and appointed Deputy Constable and Lieutenant-Governor of Windsor Castle. In 1948, he was elected president of the Marylebone Cricket Club. He died in May 1955 at his home in Gloucestershire.

He was the only Governor-General of Australia to be advised by five different Prime Ministers (Lyons, Page, Menzies, Fadden and Curtin), although two (Page and Fadden) were short-term appointments.

==Marriage and children==
Gowrie married Zara Eileen Pollok (who eventually became Zara Hore-Ruthven, Countess of Gowrie when the Gowrie earldom was created in 1945) on 1 June 1908. The couple had two sons, one of whom died in infancy:

* Major Hon Alexander Hardinge Patrick Hore-Ruthven (born 30 August 1913, died 24 December 1942), father of Grey Ruthven, 2nd Earl of Gowrie
* Alistair Malise Hore-Ruthven (born 2 August 1917, died 1918)

Lady Gowrie became renowned for her work in promoting the welfare of children in Australia, and the Lady Gowrie Child Centres were named in her honour. She died in 1965 at the age of 86.

Lord Gowrie died in 1955 aged 82 and was succeeded in the earldom and other titles by his grandson, Grey.

<doc id="352285" wikidata="Q5974178" url="?curid=352285" title="ISO 10962">
<text>ISO 10962, known as Classification of Financial Instruments (CFI), is a six-letter-code used in the financial services industry to classify and describe the structure and function of a financial instrument (in the form of security or contract) as part of the instrument reference data. It is an international standard approved by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). CFI have been required since 1 July 2017.

The CFI is attributed to a financial instrument at the time when the financial instrument is issued and when it is allocated an International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) by the respective national numbering agency (NNA). It will normally not change during the life of that instrument.

Each of the six letters of the CFI represents a specific characteristic of the financial instrument (e.g. &quot;ESVUFB&quot; is used to describe a typical registered share). Those capital letters are drawn from the ISO basic Latin alphabet. The first letter of the code is the Category: E for Equity (shares and other instruments of that nature), D for Debt (particularly bonds), C for Collective Investment Vehicles, (i.e. investment funds). The subsequent letters define the type of instrument for that category.

The purpose of ISO 10962 is to provide a standard for describing all financial instruments that can be recognized world-wide by all operators and computer systems in the financial markets and banking industries. The Classification of financial instrument Code is used to define and describe financial instruments as a uniform set of codes for all market participants.
The code is issued by the members of ANNA, the Association of National Numbering Agencies. The group promotes the structure to increase its use by non-governmental market participants.

==History of ISO 10962 Modification==
* Standard was first accepted and published in 1997 as ISO 10962:1997
* Its first revision, published in 2001, was ISO 10962:2001
* In 2006, FIX Protocol group published a proposal for changes of the standard for Consultation. 
* The last revised and accepted version of the standard is ISO 10962:2015 and was published by ISO in 2015. 
* In 2019 a revised version mainly related to OTC derivatives was published and the latest version externalizing the CFI codes was published in 2021.

==Background and Goals of Introduction==

Where distinct entities transact it is seen as helpful to establish a common transaction language. The CFI code is meant to provide the most comprehensive information possible, while at the same time maintaining the code manageability, provides a standard for identification of type of instrument and their main high level characteristics, determined by the intrinsic characteristics of the financial instrument, which would be independent of the individual names or conventions of a given country or financial institution. This principle avoids confusion arising from different linguistic usage as well as redundancy, while allowing an objective comparison of the instruments across markets.

CFI codes also aim to simplify electronic communication between participants, improve understanding of the characteristics of financial instruments for the investors, and allow securities grouping in a consistent manner for reporting and categorization purposes.

==Structure of CFI Code==
* The first character indicates the highest level of category of the Security.
* The second character refers to the groups within each category.
* The next four characters refer to four attributes, that varies between groups.
* The letter X always means &quot;Not Appl./Undefined&quot;.

<text>&quot;Helicoverpa zea, &quot;commonly known as the corn earworm, is a species (formerly in the genus &quot;Heliothis&quot;) in the family Noctuidae. The larva of the moth &quot;Helicoverpa zea&quot; is a major agricultural pest. Since it is polyphagous (feeds on many different plants) during the larval stage, the species has been given many different common names, including the cotton bollworm and the tomato fruitworm. It also consumes a wide variety of other crops.

The species is widely distributed across the Americas with the exception of northern Canada and Alaska. It has become resistant to many pesticides, but can be controlled with integrated pest management techniques including deep ploughing, trap crops, chemical control using mineral oil, and biological controls.

The species migrates seasonally, at night, and can be carried downwind up to 400 km. Pupae can make use of diapause to wait out adverse environmental conditions, especially at high latitudes and in drought.

== Distribution ==

The corn earworm is found in temperate and tropical regions of North America, with the exception of northern Canada and Alaska as it cannot overwinter in these areas. &quot;Helicoverpa zea&quot; found in the eastern United States also does not overwinter successfully. They live in Kansas, Ohio, Virginia, and southern New Jersey, but survival rate is mainly affected by the severity of the winter. Corn earworm moths regularly migrate from southern regions to northern regions depending on winter conditions. They are also found in Hawaii, the Caribbean islands, and most of South America, including Peru, Argentina, and Brazil.

Cotton earworms have also been reported from China in 2002.

The taxonomy of &quot;Helicoverpa&quot; was poorly understood for a long time. Many older works referring to &quot;Heliothis obsoleta&quot;, a synonym of &quot;H. armigera&quot;, are actually about &quot;H. zea&quot;.

== Lifecycle and description ==

=== Eggs ===
Eggs are individually deposited on leaf hairs and corn silks (not in reference given). The eggs are initially pale green in color, but over time they turn yellowish and then grey. Eggs are 0.5 mm in height and average about 0.55 mm in diameter. They hatch after 66 to 72 hours of development. Once larvae have breached the chorion, they spend up to 83% of eclosion making an exit hole larger than their heads. Larvae spend the rest of the time making a silk meshwork around the exit hole; this both helps them escape the shell and helps them find the shell afterwards so they can feed on it. After feeding on their shell, larvae rest about 3 minutes before they begin feeding on the plant material around them.

=== Larvae ===

Following hatching, larvae feed on the reproductive structures of the plant and usually develop through four to six instars. Initially, the young larva feed together, and this stage is their most destructive stage. Through maturation, older larvae become aggressive and cannibalistic, leaving one or two larvae per feeding site (See Interfamilial Predation). They usually have orange heads, black thorax plates, and a body color that is primarily black. Their bodies can also be brown, pink, green, and yellow with many thorny microspines. Mature larvae migrate to the soil, where they pupate for 12 to 16 days.

=== Pupae ===

Larvae pupate 5 to 10 cm below the soil surface. Pupae are brown in color; they measure 5.5 mm wide and 17 to 22 mm long. The biggest environmental factor that affects the pupal developmental rate is temperature, primarily soil temperature. This is because proper insulation facilitates development, and soil temperatures below 0 degrees Celsius correlate to higher pupal mortality. Another factor that influences pupal development is soil moisture. Pupal mortality is high in wet soil, where the moisture level is between 18 and 25 percent. Dehydration can also lead to high death rates among pupae, if soil moisture is as low as 1 to 2 percent.

=== Adults ===

Adults have forewings that are yellowish brown in color and have a dark spot located in the center of their body. The moths have a wingspan ranging from 32 to 45mm, and live over thirty days in optimal conditions. However, the life span ranges from five to fifteen days on average. They are nocturnal and hide in vegetation during the day. Adult moths collect nectar or other plant exudates from a large number of plants, and live for 12 to 16 days. Females can lay up to 2,500 eggs in their lifetime.

== Economic impact ==

=== Damage ===

The corn earworm is a major agricultural pest, with a large host range encompassing corn and many other crop plants. &quot;H. zea&quot; is the second-most important economic pest species in North America, next to the codling moth. The estimated annual cost of the damage is more than US$100 million, though expenditure on insecticide application has reached up to $250 million. The moth&#x27;s high fecundity, ability to lay between 500 and 3,000 eggs, polyphagous larval feeding habits, high mobility during migration, and a pupal diapause have led to the success of this pest.

=== Control ===

Two kinds of control measures have been advocated since the 19th century. One aims at total pest population reduction, while the other is aimed at protection of the particular crop. , integrated pest management (IPM), an array of techniques and approaches to control pests, was recommended. Practices such as deep ploughing, mechanical destruction, and trap crops are also used to kill different instars. Chemical control is widely successful, and includes the use of applying mineral oil inside the tip of each corn ear, which suffocates the young larvae. Pesticides are one method by which corn earworm populations are controlled; however, since they have been widely used, the insects have become resistant to many pesticides. The use of biological controls, such as the bacterium &quot;Bacillus thuringiensis&quot; and various forms of nematodes, is also common, although not without their own problems. Corn earworm moths are not always vulnerable to the bacterium, and they are only afflicted by nematodes once the larvae have pupated and dropped to the ground. Strains of maize have been genetically modified to produce the same toxin as the bacterium, and are referred to as &quot;Bt-corn&quot;.

== Survival ==

=== Natural enemies ===

More than 100 insect species prey on &quot;H. zea&quot;, usually feeding on eggs and larvae. The insidious flower bug (&quot;Orius insidiosus&quot;), a pirate bug, feeds on the eggs of &quot;H. zea&quot;, thus acting as a biological control agent. Some plants emit a blend of chemicals in response to damage from &quot;H. zea&quot;, which attract parasitic insects. &quot;Cardiochiles nigriceps, &quot;a solitary endoparasitoid wasp, makes use of these volatile plant compounds to identify the presence of &quot;H. zea&quot;. When the wasps find damaged host plants, they hover around and then search for the host with their antennae. When the females find their prey, they use their antennae to position themselves and deposit eggs into the host. The braconid wasp &quot;Microplitis croceipes&quot;, which deposits its eggs inside a living caterpillar, is also an important parasitoid of both &quot;H. zea&quot; and the related species &quot;Heliothis virescens&quot;. When larval densities are high, a fungal pathogen, &quot;Nomuraea rileyi&quot;, can cause an outbreak of disease. However, pupal mortality is high not because of predators, but because of harsh weather conditions, collapsing pupal chambers, and disease.

=== Larval predation ===

As the larvae mature, they become increasingly aggressive. Although they have host plants surrounding them, &quot;H. zea&quot; larvae attack and eat other insects. When presented with a second-instar larva of &quot;Urbanus proteus&quot;, the corn earworm larva grasps the insect, rolls onto its side to form a semicircle, and begins feeding on the insect&#x27;s posterior end. If the &quot;U. proteus&quot; begins to bite out of defense, &quot;H. zea&quot; rotates the larva 180° and uses its mandibles to puncture the head capsule, killing the insect. Then, the &quot;H. zea&quot; larva rotates the &quot;U. proteus&quot; back to its original position and continues feeding until the insect is entirely consumed. Even when presented with up to five &quot;U. proteus&quot; larvae, &quot;H. zea&quot; engages in the unique behavior, as the larvae have a higher affinity for lepidopterous prey over plant material. &quot;H. zea&quot; raised in a low-moisture environment has a lower pupal weight and a longer developmental time than those raised in environments of high moisture, so a nutritional benefit exists to such aggressive feeding behavior under such conditions.

==Movement ==

===Migration===

&quot;Helicoverpa zea&quot; is a seasonal, nocturnal migrant, and adults disperse, weather permitting, when there are poor reproductive conditions. In short-range dispersal, the moths move within the crop and low over the foliage. This type of dispersal is mostly independent of wind currents. Long-range dispersal involves adults flying up to 10 meters above the ground and moving downwind from crop to crop. Migratory flights occur up to 1–2 km above the ground and can last for hours. Migration of 400 km is common for such flights as moths are carried downwind. &quot;Helicoverpa zea&quot; caterpillars are usually intercepted on produce transported by air-freight transportation. Most activity is restricted to the night-time. Some moths display vertical take-off flight, which carries them above the flight boundary layer and allows them to undertake migratory movement in upper wind systems. During mating, males engage in high-speed directed flight in search of pheromone plumes (See Pheromone Production).

===Diapause===
Pupae have the ability to enter facultative diapause, the state of arrested development and growth in response to a change in the environment. By preparing themselves for a major change in environmental conditions, they can increase reproductive success. Diapause increases with increasing latitude. In tropical conditions, populations breed continuously, and only 2-4% of pupae diapause. In subtropical and temperate regions, most individuals diapause. Individuals who don&#x27;t enter diapause in these areas emerge in late fall and die without reproducing. Drought-responsive diapause has also been observed in the summer.

== Feeding ==

=== Host plants ===

&quot;Helicoverpa zea&quot; has a wide host range, attacking vegetables that include corn, tomato, artichoke, asparagus, cabbage, cantaloupe, collards, cowpea, cucumber, eggplant, lettuce, lima bean, melon, okra, pea, pepper, potato, pumpkin, snap bean, spinach, squash, sweet potato, and watermelon. However, not all of these are good hosts. While corn and lettuce are shown to be great hosts, tomatoes are less beneficial, and broccoli and cantaloupe are poor hosts. Corn and sorghum are most favored by corn earworms. Various signs reveal the presence of these moths. Young maize crops have holes in their leaves, following whorl-feeding on the apical leaf. Eggs can be found on silks on larger plants, and silks display grazing evidence. The soft, milky grains in the top few centimeters of corn cobs are eaten as the corn ears develop. One larva per cob can be observed. Bore holes are observed in cabbage and lettuce hearts, flower heads, cotton bolls, and tomato fruits. Sorghum heads are grazed, and legume pod seeds are eaten.

=== Corn ===

&quot;Helicoverpa zea&quot; earns its nickname the corn earworm for its widely known destruction of cornfields. The corn earworm feeds on every part of corn, including the kernels. Severe feeding at the tip of kernels allows entry for diseases and mold growth. Larvae begin feeding on the kernels once they have reached third instar. Larvae penetrate 9 to 15 cm into the ear, with deeper penetration occurring as the kernels harden. Larvae do not eat the hard kernels, but take bites out of many kernels, lowering the quality of the corn for processing.

=== Soybeans ===

&quot;Helicoverpa zea&quot; is the most common and destructive pest of soybean growth in Virginia. About one-third of Virginia acreage is treated annually with insecticide, costing farmers around 2 million dollars. The degree of damage varies on the size of the pest infestation, the timing, and the stage of the plant. However, soybean plants are capable of withstanding a large amount of damage without substantial yield loss depending on soil moisture, planting date, and weather. If the damage is early in the plants life, then damage will mostly be to the leaves. Plants compensate for the damage by processes such as increasing seed size in remaining pods. Most damage happens in August, when the plants are flowering. Attacks that happen after August do much less damage because many pods have developed tougher walls that &quot;H. zea&quot; can&#x27;t penetrate. Infestations that affect pod formation and seed filling have the potential to reduce yields, and because this happens in the later stages of plants, they have less time to compensate.

Female moths are attracted to flowering soybean fields. The most severe infestations occur between flowering and when pods become fully developed. Large-scale outbreak is associated with time of peak flowering, when most pods are developed, and peak moth flight, for giant. Moths are also attracted to drought stressed soybeans or fields with poor growth. Dry weather leads to quick drying of corn plants, compelling moths to leave and seek other hosts. Heavy rainfall also decreases corn earworm populations because it drowns pupae in their soil chambers, limits moth flight, washes eggs from leaves, and creates favorable conditions for fungal diseases that kill caterpillars.

== Mating ==

=== Pheromone production ===

A hormone produced in the brain of the female moths controls sex pheromones. The hormone is released into the hemolymph to stimulate pheromone production. Pheromone biosynthesis-activating neuropeptide (PBAN) is a peptide that regulates pheromone production in moths. It acts on the pheromone gland cells using calcium and cyclic AMP. Although the photoperiod regulates the release of PBAN to some extent, the chemical signals from the host plant supersede the effect from the time of day. Female &quot;Helicoverpa zea&quot; in corn fields do not produce pheromones during the night until they encounter corn. Several natural corn silk volatiles like the plant hormone Ethylene as a plant hormone#ethylene induce &quot;H. zea&quot; pheromone production. The presence of the silk from an ear of corn is enough to cause pheromone production, and physical contact between females and corn is unnecessary. This evolutionary mechanism enables the moths to coordinate their reproductive behavior with the availability of food. Female moths often become depleted of sex pheromone after mating within 2 hours of separation from the male. The pheromonostatic peptide (PSP), a protein 57 amino acids long found in the male accessory gland, is what causes depletion of the female&#x27;s sex pheromone. This capability in males has been selected for because it increases the reproductive fitness of those that carry it, since other males will not be attracted to a female without a sex pheromone; thus, the female will bear only the first male&#x27;s offspring. The transfer of a spermatophore without accessory gland products does not stop female pheromone production, but does stop the female&#x27;s calling behavior. Intense selection acting on males to manipulate female reproductive physiology promotes rapid evolution of specific molecules, and male-derived pheromone suppressing factors exhibit positive selection. When females are infected with the virus &quot;Helicoverpa zea&quot; nudivirus 2, they produce 5 to 7 times the amount of sex pheromone than uninfected females.

=== Mortality ===

Sperm competition and chemicals introduced to females through mating have a negative effect on females and their lifespan. In males, production of the spermatophore, sperm, and secondary chemicals reduces their lifespan. As the number of copulations increase, the rate of mortality also increases in both sexes.

=== Flight behavior ===

Males must first wait to sense a female&#x27;s pheromones before they can locate her. Before males engage in flight to find a female, they warm-up by shivering the major flight muscles to reach thoracic temperature optimal to sustain flight, around 26 degrees Celsius. The thermoregulatory shivering activities of males were measured as they were exposed to different sex-related olfactory cues. Males are found to heat up more quickly in the presence of a female pheromone and take-off at a lower thoracic temperature than males who are exposed to other chemical scents. Since heating up to the right temperature leads to better flight performance than flying immediately, there is a trade-off between sub-optimal flight performance and rapid onset of directed flight. &quot;Helicoverpa zea&quot; males exposed to an attractive pheromone blend thus spend less time shivering and increase their heating rate. Thermoregulatory behavior of unrestrained moths is associated with competition for access to females, showing the ecological trade-off.

<text>The Flying Squad is a branch of the Serious and Organised Crime Command within London&#x27;s Metropolitan Police Service. It is also known as the Robbery Squad, Specialist Crime Directorate 7, SC&amp;O7 and SO7. It is nicknamed The Sweeney, an abbreviation of the Cockney rhyming slang &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot; (rhyming &quot;squad&quot; with &quot;todd&quot;).

The squad&#x27;s purpose is to investigate robberies.

== Formation and history ==
The squad was originally formed on an experimental basis by Detective Chief Inspector Frederick Wensley. In October 1919, Wensley summoned 12 detectives to Scotland Yard to form the squad. The group was initially named the Mobile Patrol Experiment and its original orders were to perform surveillance and gather intelligence on known robbers and pickpockets, using a horse-drawn carriage with covert holes cut into the canvas.

In 1920, it was officially reorganised under the authority of then Commissioner Nevil Macready. Headed by Detective Inspector Walter Hambrook, the squad was composed of 12 detective officers, including Irish-born Jeremiah Lynch (1888–1953), who had earned a fearsome reputation for tracking wartime German spies and for building up the case against confidence trickster Horatio Bottomley. The Mobile Patrol Experiment was given authorisation to carry out duties anywhere in the Metropolitan Police District, meaning that its officers did not have to observe Divisions, giving rise to the name of the Flying Squad because the unit operated across London without adhering to divisional policing boundaries.

An alternative explanation for the &quot;Flying Squad&quot; name is that the first vehicles used were refurbished Crossley Motors 20/25 type tenders previously used by the Royal Flying Corps, which were supplied to the Metropolitan Police in 1920.

Throughout the 1920s, the squad was standardised and expanded, and the establishment was expanded to 40 officers, under the command of Detective Chief Inspector Fred &quot;Nutty&quot; Sharpe until his retirement in July 1937. In 1948, the squad was given the designation of C.O.(C.8) for Commissioner&#x27;s Office Crime 8 and was augmented. By 1956 it made one thousand arrests per year for the first time.

From 1978 to 1981 the name was changed to the Central Robbery Squad, but still known as the Flying Squad. It is often referred to by the nicknames the &quot;Heavy Mob&quot; or &quot;the Sweeney&quot; (rhyming slang for Flying Squad, from Sweeney Todd).

This was the era in which the squad&#x27;s close ties with the criminal fraternity, which had always been a necessary part of its strategy, were being exposed to public criticism. A number of scandals involving bribery and corruption were revealed, and on 7 July 1977, the squad&#x27;s commander, Detective Chief Superintendent Kenneth Drury, was convicted on five counts of corruption and imprisoned for eight years. Twelve other officers were also convicted and many more resigned. These and other scandals led to a massive internal investigation by the Dorset Constabulary into the Metropolitan Police Service and the City of London Police, codenamed Operation Countryman.

== Notable investigations ==
*In July 1948, the Squad learned of a plan to steal £750,000 (almost £25 million in 2019) of bullion, jewellery and other valuables from the BOAC (British Overseas Airways Corporation) secure warehouse at Heathrow Airport by drugging the guards. Squad officers replaced the guards and pretended to be drugged, with other officers stationed around the warehouse. When the thieves removed the keys to the safe from Detective Sergeant Charles Hewett, the Squad announced its presence and a violent struggle ensued with many on both sides suffering serious injuries. The nine offenders received a total of 71 years&#x27; imprisonment for what became known as the Battle of London Airport.
*In the 1960s, the squad undertook the role of capturing and gathering evidence against the Kray twins, with many officers giving evidence in court.
*The squad took up investigating the Great Train Robbery, which had no firearms involved, but did not catch all of the robbers.
*Some of the most dangerous work undertaken by the Flying Squad is the &quot;pavement ambush&quot;, where police ambush armed robbers during an offence. During Operation Char in 1987, and Operation Yamoto in November 1990, this approach led to three armed robbers being shot dead by police.
*On 26 November 1983, £26 million worth of gold bullion, diamonds, and cash was stolen from the Brink&#x27;s-Mat depot, on a trading estate near Heathrow Airport in West London. Flying Squad officers were involved extensively in the investigations which followed to attempt to trace, arrest and convict the gang members involved and their associates.
*In August 1993, an armed robbery occurred at a Barclays Bank in Blackfen in south-east London. This made the headlines as being the first time police were fired upon by a machine gun in mainland Britain; one officer was struck in the head by a ricochet and received the George Medal. The two robbers were later arrested and sentenced at the Old Bailey.
*In November 2000, five men set out to rob the Millennium Dome of the flawless Millennium Star, valued at over £200 million. Originally, police were unsure of the intended location of the robbery, but after months of surveillance, it was realised that the target was the Millennium Dome. On 7 November, the robbers armed with smoke bombs, ammonia and a nail gun, crashed into the dome with a stolen JCB excavator and smashed through to the vault. The robbers planned to escape on the River Thames by using a speedboat. The police operation to catch the robbers was codenamed Operation Magician, and involved 200 officers, including 40 specialist firearms officers (SFOs) from SCO19. Some of the officers were positioned behind a dummy wall, and others were dressed as cleaners with their firearms hidden in black bin bags or in rubbish bins, along with officers in Dome staff uniforms. A further 60 armed Flying Squad officers were stationed around the Thames, and 20 on the river itself, to hamper any escape attempts. The five men were caught and sentenced on various robbery charges. Detective Superintendent Jon Shatford was in command of the operation.
*On 17 May 2004, a robbery at the Heathrow Airport Swissport warehouse was foiled by officers from the Flying Squad and the Metropolitan Police, as the robbers attempted to steal gold and cash potentially worth £80m. The eight gang members later received between 6 and 13 years each in jail.
*On 13 September 2007, the Flying Squad was involved in an incident outside a bank in the village of Chandler&#x27;s Ford, near Southampton. Two suspected armed robbers were shot dead by members of SCO19, in support of a Flying Squad operation, who had been lying in wait after receiving a tip off that an armed robbery was imminent. The thieves were attempting armed robbery on a G4S security van outside the HSBC branch when they were killed by the SCO19 SFOs.

== In fiction ==
The Flying Squad&#x27;s work was dramatised in the 1970s British television series &quot;The Sweeney&quot;, and two theatrically released feature film spin-offs, &quot;Sweeney!&quot; and &quot;Sweeney 2&quot;, starring John Thaw and Dennis Waterman. A further film adaptation, &quot;The Sweeney&quot; (starring Ray Winstone), was released in 2012.

The Monty Python sketch &quot;Argument Clinic&quot; featured &quot;Inspector Fox of the Light Entertainment Police, Comedy Division, Special Flying Squad&quot;, and &quot;Inspector Thompson&#x27;s Gazelle of the Programme Planning Police, Light Entertainment Division, Special Flying Squad.&quot;

In an episode of the &quot;Thin Blue Line&quot;, Inspector Fowler expresses displeasure at the idea of the Flying Squad using his station for an investigation on the grounds that their members urinate inaccurately.

<text>Cotton bollworms are a significant pest of cotton. &quot;A major pest in hot countries of irrigated crops. Enters into a summer diapause when irrigated crops are not present and the soil and air temperatures are high. When the end of the dry season comes, the rain cools the soil and pupae come out of diapause.&quot; (Nibouche 2004)

<doc id="352296" wikidata="Q285870" url="?curid=352296" title="Gamma-glutamyltransferase">
<text>Gamma-glutamyltransferase (also γ-glutamyltransferase, GGT, gamma-GT, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase; ) is a transferase (a type of enzyme) that catalyzes the transfer of gamma-glutamyl functional groups from molecules such as glutathione to an acceptor that may be an amino acid, a peptide or water (forming glutamate). GGT plays a key role in the gamma-glutamyl cycle, a pathway for the synthesis and degradation of glutathione as well as drug and xenobiotic detoxification. Other lines of evidence indicate that GGT can also exert a pro-oxidant role, with regulatory effects at various levels in cellular signal transduction and cellular pathophysiology. This transferase is found in many tissues, the most notable one being the liver, and has significance in medicine as a diagnostic marker.

== Nomenclature ==
The name γ-glutamyltransferase is preferred by the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. The Expert Panel on Enzymes of the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry also used this name. The older name is gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP).

== Function ==
GGT is present in the cell membranes of many tissues, including the kidneys, bile duct, pancreas, gallbladder, spleen, heart, brain, and seminal vesicles. It is involved in the transfer of amino acids across the cellular membrane and leukotriene metabolism. It is also involved in glutathione metabolism by transferring the glutamyl moiety to a variety of acceptor molecules including water, certain L-amino acids, and peptides, leaving the cysteine product to preserve intracellular homeostasis of oxidative stress. This general reaction is:

:(5-L-glutamyl)-peptide + an amino acid peptide + 5-L-glutamyl amino acid

== Biochemistry ==
In prokaryotes and eukaryotes, GGT consists of two polypeptide chains, a heavy and a light subunit, processed from a single chain precursor by an autocatalytic cleavage. The active site of GGT is known to be located in the light subunit.

Co-translational &quot;N&quot;-glycosylation serves a significant role in the proper autocatalytic cleavage and proper folding of GGT. Single site mutations at asparagine residues were shown to result in a functionally active yet slightly less thermally stable version of the enzyme in vitro, while knockout of all asparagine residues resulted in an accumulation of the uncleaved, propeptide form of the enzyme.

== Clinical significance ==
A GGT test is predominantly used as a diagnostic marker for liver disease. Elevated serum GGT activity can be found in diseases of the liver, biliary system, pancreas and kidneys. Latent elevations in GGT are typically seen in patients with chronic viral hepatitis infections often taking 12 months or more to present.

Individual test results should always be interpreted using the reference range from the laboratory that performed the test, though example reference ranges are 15–85 IU/L for men, and 5–55 IU/L for women. GGT is similar to alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in detecting disease of the biliary tract. Indeed, the two markers correlate well, though there are conflicting data about whether GGT has better sensitivity. In general, ALP is still the first test for biliary disease. The main value of GGT is in verifying that ALP elevations are, in fact, due to biliary disease; ALP can also be increased in certain bone diseases, but GGT is not.

=== Alcohol use ===
GGT is elevated by ingestion of large quantities of alcohol. However, determination of high levels of total serum GGT activity is not specific to alcohol intoxication, and the measurement of selected serum forms of the enzyme offer more specific information. Isolated elevation or disproportionate elevation compared to other liver enzymes (such as ALT or alanine transaminase) can indicate harmful alcohol use or alcoholic liver disease, and can indicate excess alcohol consumption up to 3 or 4 weeks prior to the test. The mechanism for this elevation is unclear. Alcohol might increase GGT production by inducing hepatic microsomal production, or it might cause the leakage of GGT from hepatocytes.

=== Xenobiotics ===
Numerous drugs can raise GGT levels, including phenobarbitone and phenytoin. GGT elevation has also been occasionally reported following nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (including aspirin), St. John&#x27;s wort and kava.

=== Cardiovascular disease ===
More recently, slightly elevated serum GGT has also been found to correlate with cardiovascular diseases and is under active investigation as a cardiovascular risk marker. GGT in fact accumulates in atherosclerotic plaques, suggesting a potential role in pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases, and circulates in blood in the form of distinct protein aggregates, some of which appear to be related to specific pathologies such as metabolic syndrome, alcohol addiction and chronic liver disease.

Elevated levels of GGT can also be due to congestive heart failure.

=== Neoplasms ===
GGT is expressed in high levels in many different tumors. It is known to accelerate tumor growth and to increase resistance to cisplatin in tumors.

== Examples ==
Human proteins that belong to this family include GGT1, GGT2, GGT6, GGTL3, GGTL4, GGTLA1 and GGTLA4.

<text>Edwin Thanhouser (November 11, 1865 – March 21, 1956) was an American actor, businessman, and film producer. He was most notable as a founder of the Thanhouser Company, which was one of the first motion picture studios. His wife Gertrude Thanhouser and brother-in-law Lloyd Lonergan were co-founders.

==Biography==
Thanhouser was born in Baltimore, Maryland. In 1893, he joined the traveling company of Alessandro Salvini. After Salvini&#x27;s unexpected death in 1896, Thanhouser managed the Academy Theater in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, for the Shubert family and then the Bush Temple Theater in Chicago, Illinois. He formed a stock company that put on hundreds of theatrical productions.

On February 8, 1900, Thanhouser married actress Gertrude Homan.

In 1909, Thanhouser and his family moved to New Rochelle, New York, where he leased space in an old wooden skating rink to start the Thanhouser Company. This pioneering movie studio released its first commercial film on March 15, 1910.

Thanhouser brought actress Florence La Badie to the company in 1911. From 1911 to 1917, she was the company&#x27;s most prominent star. In 1912, he sold the film company to group headed by Charles J. Hite. Early in 1915, after Hite&#x27;s death in an accident, Thanhouser took charge of the company again, but was not as successful as he had been before. The Thanhouser Film Corporation was liquidated in 1920.

Edwin Thanhouser engaged in securities investments and collected art in his later years. He died March 21, 1956.

<doc id="352307" wikidata="Q33239" url="?curid=352307" title="Cebuano language">
<text>Cebuano ( ) is an Austronesian language spoken in the southern Philippines by Cebuano people and other ethnic groups as a secondary language. It is natively, though informally, called by the generic name Bisayâ (), or Binisayâ () (both terms are translated into English as &quot;Visayan&quot;, though this should not be confused with other Bisayan languages) and sometimes referred to in English sources as Cebuan ( ). It is spoken by the Visayan ethnolinguistic groups native to the islands of Cebu, Bohol, Siquijor, the eastern half of Negros, the western half of Leyte, the northern coastal areas of Northern Mindanao and the eastern part of Zamboanga del Norte due to Spanish settlements during the 18th century. In modern times, it has also spread to the Davao Region, Cotabato, Camiguin, parts of the Dinagat Islands, and the lowland regions of Caraga, often displacing native languages in those areas (most of which are closely related to it).

While Tagalog has the largest number of native speakers among the languages of the Philippines today, Cebuano had the largest native-language-speaking population from the 1950s until about the 1980s. It is by far the most widely spoken of the Bisayan languages.

Cebuano is the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of Central Visayas, the western parts of Eastern Visayas, some western parts of Palawan, and most parts of Mindanao. The name Cebuano is derived from the island of Cebu, which is the source of Standard Cebuano. Cebuano is also the primary language in Western Leyte—noticeably in Ormoc. Cebuano is assigned the ISO 639-2 three-letter code but not an ISO 639-1 two-letter code.

The Commission on the Filipino Language, the Philippine government body charged with developing and promoting the national and regional languages of the country, spells the name of the language in Filipino as . 

While it is not widely spoken in Luzon, there are a few Cebuano communities in Metro Manila, Calabarzon, Bulacan, throughout Central Luzon, northernmost Luzon, including Cordillera Administrative Region, and Ilocos Region.

==Nomenclature==

The term &quot;Cebuano&quot; derives from &quot;Cebu&quot;+&quot;ano&quot;, a Latinate calque reflecting the Philippines&#x27; Spanish colonial heritage. Speakers of Cebuano in Cebu and even those from outside of Cebu commonly refer to the language as &quot;Bisayâ&quot;.

The name &quot;Cebuano&quot;, however, has not been accepted by all who speak it. Cebuano speakers in certain portions of Leyte, Northern Mindanao, Davao Region, Caraga, and Zamboanga Peninsula objected to the name of the language and claimed that their ancestry traces back to Bisayâ speakers native to their place and not from immigrants or settlers from Cebu. Furthermore, they refer to their ethnicity as &quot;Bisayâ&quot; instead of Cebuano and their language as &quot;Binisayâ&quot; instead of Cebuano. However, there is a pushback on these objections. Some language enthusiasts insist on referring to the language as Cebuano because, as they claim, using the terms &quot;Bisayâ&quot; and &quot;Binisayâ&quot; to refer to ethnicity and language, respectively, is exclusivist and disenfranchises the speakers of the Hiligaynon language and the Waray language who also refer to their languages as &quot;Binisayâ&quot; to distinguish them from Cebuano &quot;Bisayâ&quot;.

Existing linguistic studies on Visayan languages, most notably that of R. David Paul Zorc, has described the language spoken in Cebu, Negros Occidental, Bohol (as Boholano dialect), Leyte, and most parts of Mindanao as &quot;Cebuano&quot;. Zorc&#x27;s studies on Visayan language serves as the bible of linguistics in the study of Visayan languages. The Jesuit linguist and a native of Cabadbaran, Rodolfo Cabonce, S.J., published two dictionaries during his stays in Cagayan de Oro City and Manolo Fortich in Bukidnon: a Cebuano-English dictionary in 1955, and an English-Cebuano dictionary in 1983.

During the Spanish Colonial Period, the Spaniards broadly referred to the speakers of Hiligaynon, Cebuano, Waray, Kinaray-a, and Aklanon as &quot;Visaya&quot; and made no distinctions among these languages.

==Geographical distribution==
As of the 2020 (but released in 2023) statistics released by the Philippine Statistics Authority, the current number of households that speak Cebuano is approximately 1.72 million and around 6.5% of the country&#x27;s population speak it inside their home. However, in a journal published in 2020, the number of speakers is estimated to be 15.9 million which in turn based it on a 2019 study.

Cebuano is spoken in the provinces of Cebu, Bohol, Siquijor, Negros Oriental, northeastern Negros Occidental (as well as the municipality of Hinoba-an and the cities of Kabankalan and Sipalay to a great extent, alongside Ilonggo), southern Masbate, western portions of Leyte and Biliran (to a great extent, alongside Waray), and a large portion of Mindanao, notably the urban areas of Zamboanga Peninsula, Northern Mindanao, Davao Region, Caraga and some parts of Soccsksargen (alongside Ilonggo, Maguindanaon, indigenous Mindanaoan languages and to the lesser extent, Ilocano). It is also spoken in some remote barangays of San Francisco and San Andres in Quezon Province in Luzon, due to its geographical contact with Cebuano-speaking parts of Burias Island in Masbate. Some dialects of Cebuano have different names for the language. Cebuano speakers from Cebu are mainly called &quot;Cebuano&quot; while those from Bohol are &quot;Boholano&quot; or &quot;Bol-anon&quot;. Cebuano speakers in Leyte identify their dialect as &quot;Kanâ&quot; meaning &quot;that&quot; (Leyte Cebuano or Leyteño). Speakers in Mindanao and Luzon refer to the language simply as &quot;Binisayâ&quot; or &quot;Bisayà&quot;.

==History==

The Cebuano language is a descendant of the hypothesized reconstructed Proto-Philippine language, which in turn descended from Proto-Malayo-Polynesian, making it distantly related to many languages in Maritime Southeast Asia, including Indonesian and Malay. The earlier forms of the language is hard to trace as a result of lack of documents written using the language through different time periods and also because the natives used to write on easily perishable material rather than on processed paper or parchment.

The earliest record of the Cebuano language was first documented in a list of words compiled by Antonio Pigafetta, an Italian explorer who was part of Ferdinand Magellan&#x27;s 1521 expedition. While there is evidence of a writing system for the language, its use appears to have been sporadic. Spaniards recorded the Visayan script, which was called &quot;kudlit-kabadlit&quot; by the natives. Although Spanish chroniclers Francisco Alcina and Antonio de Morga wrote that almost every native was literate in the 17th century CE, it appears to have been exaggerated as accounted for lack of physical evidence and contradicting reports of different accounts. A report from 1567 CE describes how the natives wrote the language, and stated that the natives learned it from the Malays, but a century later another report claimed that the Visayan natives learned it from the Tagalogs. Despite the confirmation of the usage of &quot;baybayin&quot; in the region, the documents of the language being written in it other than Latin between the 17th century CE and 18th century CE are now rare. In the 18th century CE, Francisco Encina, a Spanish priest, compiled a grammar book on the language, but his work was published sometime only by the early 19th century CE. The priest recorded the letters of the Latin alphabet used for the language, and in a separate report, his name was listed as the recorder of the non-Latin characters used by the natives.

Cebuano written literature is generally agreed to have started with Vicente Yap Sotto, who wrote &quot;Maming&quot; in 1901, but earlier he wrote a more patriotic piece of literature that was published a year later after &quot;Maming&quot; because of American censorship during the US occupation of the Philippines. However, there existed a piece that was more of a conduct book rather than a fully defined story itself, written in 1852 by Fray Antonio Ubeda de la Santísima Trinidad.

==Phonology==

===Vowels===
Below is the vowel system of Cebuano with their corresponding letter representation in angular brackets:
* an open front unrounded vowel similar to English &quot;father&quot;
* an open-mid front unrounded vowel similar to English &quot;bed&quot;
* a close front unrounded vowel similar to English &quot;machine&quot;
* a close-mid back rounded vowel similar to English &quot;forty&quot;
* a close back rounded vowel similar to English &quot;flute&quot;

Sometimes, may also be pronounced as the open-mid back unrounded vowel (as in English &quot;gut&quot;); or as the near-close near-front unrounded vowel (as in English &quot;bit&quot;); and or as the open-mid back rounded vowel (as in English &quot;thought&quot;) or the near-close near-back rounded vowel (as in English &quot;hook&quot;).

During the precolonial and Spanish period, Cebuano had only three vowel phonemes: , and . This was later expanded to five vowels with the introduction of Spanish. As a consequence, the vowels or , as well as or , are still mostly allophones. They can be freely switched with each other without losing their meaning (free variation); though it may sound strange to a native listener, depending on their dialect. The vowel can be pronounced as either or , or as immediately after the consonant . Loanwords, however, are usually more conservative in their orthography and pronunciation (e.g. &quot;dyip&quot;, &quot;jeepney&quot; from English &quot;jeep&quot;, will never be written or spoken as &quot;dyep&quot;).

There are only four diphthongs since and are allophones. These include , , , and .

===Consonants===
For Cebuano consonants, all the stops are unaspirated. The velar nasal occurs in all positions, including at the beginning of a word (e.g. &quot;ngano&quot;, &quot;why&quot;). The glottal stop is most commonly encountered in between two vowels, but can also appear in all positions.

Like in Tagalog, glottal stops are usually not indicated in writing. When indicated, it is commonly written as a hyphen or an apostrophe if the glottal stop occurs in the middle of the word (e.g. &quot;tu-o&quot; or &quot;tu&#x27;o&quot;, &quot;right&quot;). More formally, when it occurs at the end of the word, it is indicated by a circumflex accent if both a stress and a glottal stop occurs at the final vowel (e.g. &quot;basâ&quot;, &quot;wet&quot;); or a grave accent if the glottal stop occurs at the final vowel, but the stress occurs at the penultimate syllable (e.g. &quot;batà&quot;, &quot;child&quot;).

Below is a chart of Cebuano consonants with their corresponding letter representation in parentheses:
In certain dialects, may be interchanged with in between vowels and vice versa depending on the following conditions:
* If is in between and /, the vowel succeeding is usually (but not always) dropped (e.g. &quot;lalóm&quot;, &quot;deep&quot;, becomes &quot;lawóm&quot; or &quot;lawm&quot;).
* If is in between / and , it is the vowel that is preceding that is instead dropped (e.g. &quot;bulan&quot;, &quot;moon&quot;, becomes &quot;buwan&quot; or &quot;bwan&quot;)
* If is in between two like vowels, the may be dropped completely and the vowel lengthened. For example, &quot;dalá&quot; (&quot;bring&quot;), becomes &quot;da&quot; (); and &quot;tulód&quot; (&quot;push&quot;) becomes &quot;tud&quot; (). Except if the l is in between closed syllables or is in the beginning of the penultimate syllable; in which case, the is dropped along with one of the vowels, and no lengthening occurs. For example, &quot;kalatkat&quot;, &quot;climb&quot;, becomes &quot;katkat&quot; ( not ).

A final can also be replaced with in certain areas in Bohol (e.g. &quot;tambal&quot;, &quot;medicine&quot;, becomes &quot;tambaw&quot;). In very rare cases in Cebu, may also be replaced with in between the vowels and / (e.g. &quot;tingali&quot;, &quot;maybe&quot;, becomes &quot;tingayi&quot;).

In some parts of Bohol and Southern Leyte, is also often replaced with when it is in the beginning of a syllable (e.g. &quot;kalayo&quot;, &quot;fire&quot;, becomes &quot;kalajo&quot;). It can also happen even if the is at the final position of the syllable and the word, but only if it is moved to the initial position by the addition of the affix &quot;-a&quot;. For example, &quot;baboy&quot; (&quot;pig&quot;) can not become &quot;baboj&quot;, but &quot;baboya&quot; can become &quot;baboja.&quot;

All of the above substitutions are considered allophonic and do not change the meaning of the word.

In rarer instances, the consonant might also be replaced with when it is in between two vowels (e.g. Boholano &quot;idô&quot; for standard Cebuano &quot;irô&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;), but and are not considered allophones, though they may have been in the past.

===Stress===
Stress accent is phonemic, which means that words with different accent placements, such as &quot;dapít&quot; (near) and &quot;dápit&quot; (place), are considered separate. The stress is predictably on the penult when the second-to-last syllable is closed (CVC or VC). On the other hand, when the syllable is open (CV or V), the stress can be on either the penultimate or the final syllable (although there are certain grammatical conditions or categories under which the stress is predictable, such as with numbers and pronouns).

==Writing system==
The Cebuano language is written using the Latin script and the &quot;de facto&quot; writing convention is based on the Filipino orthography. There is no updated spelling rule of the language as the letter &quot;Ee&quot; is often interchangeable with &quot;Ii&quot; and &quot;Oo&quot; with &quot;Uu&quot;. Though it was recorded that the language used a different writing system prior to the introduction of the Latin script, its use was so rare that there is hardly any surviving accounts of Cebuano being written in what was called &quot;badlit&quot;. Modern Cebuano uses 20 letters from the Latin alphabet and it consists of 5 vowels and 15 consonants. The letters c, f, j, q, v, x and z are also used but in foreign loanwords, while the &quot;ñ&quot; is used for Spanish names (e.g. Santo Niño).
The &quot;Ng&quot; digraph is also present in the alphabet since it is part of the phonology of most Philippine languages representing the sound of the velar nasal (e.g. &quot;ngipon&quot;, &quot;teeth&quot; and &quot;ngano&quot;, &quot;why&quot;).

==Vocabulary==
Cebuano shares many cognates with other Austronesian languages and its descendants. Early trade contact resulted in the adoption of loanwords from Malay (despite belonging in the same language family) like &quot;sulát&quot; (&quot;to write&quot;) &quot;, &quot;pilak&quot;&quot; (&quot;silver&quot;), and &quot;balísa&quot; (&quot;anxious&quot;); it also adopted words from Sanskrit like &quot;bahandì&quot; (&quot;wealth, goods, riches&quot;) from &quot;भाण्ड, &quot;bhānda&quot;&quot; (&quot;goods&quot;), and &quot;bása&quot; (&quot;to read&quot;) is taken from &quot;वाचा, &quot;vācā&quot;&quot; (&quot;sacred text&quot;) and Arabic like the word &quot;alam&quot; (&quot;to know&quot;) is said to be borrowed from Arabic &quot;عَالَم, &quot;&quot;&quot; (&quot;things, creation, existing before&quot;)&quot;,&quot; and &quot;salamat&quot; (&quot;expression of gratitude, thanks, thank you&quot;) from &quot;سَلَامَات, &quot;&quot;&quot; (&quot;plural form of &quot;salāma,&quot; meaning &quot;good health&quot;), both of which were indirectly transmitted to Cebuano through Malays.

The biggest component of loanwords that Cebuano uses is from Spanish, being more culturally influenced by Spanish priests from the late 16th century and invigorated by the opening of the Suez canal in the 1860s that encouraged European migrations to Asia, most notably its numeral system. English words are also used extensively in the language and mostly among the educated ones, even sometimes using the English word rather than the direct Cebuano. For example, instead of saying &quot;magpalít&quot; (&quot;to buy&quot;, in future tense), speakers would often say &quot;mag-buy&quot;&quot;.&quot;

===Numbers===
Currently, the native system is mostly used as cardinal numbers and more often as ordinal numbers, and the Spanish-derived system is used in monetary and chronological terminology and is also commonly used in counting from 11 and above, though both systems can be used interchangeably regardless. The table below shows the comparison of native numerals and Spanish-derived numerals, but observably Cebuano speakers would often just use the English numeral system instead, especially for numbers more than 100.

The language uses a base-ten numeral system, thence the sets of ten are ultimately derived from the unit except the first ten which is &quot;napulò&quot;, this is done by adding a prefix ka-,&quot; then followed by a unit, and then the suffix -an. For example, 20 is spoken as ka-duhá-an (lit. &quot;the second set of ten&quot;). The numbers are named from one to ten, for values after ten, it is spoken as &quot;a ten and a unit&quot;. For example, 11 is spoken as &quot;napulò ug usá&quot;, shortened to &quot;napulò&#x27;g usá&quot; (lit. &quot;ten and one&quot;), 111 is spoken as &quot;&quot;usa ka gatós, napulò ug usá&quot;,&quot; and 1111 is spoken as &quot;&quot;usá ka libo, usá ka gatós, napulò ug usá&quot;.&quot; The ordinal counting uses the prefix ika-&quot;, and then the unit, except for &quot;first&quot; which is &quot;una&quot;. For example, &quot;ika-duhá&quot; means &quot;second&quot;.

* Handuraw, &quot;the power to imagine,&quot; &quot;to reminisce,&quot; or &quot;flashback&quot;

==Dialects==
There is no standardized orthography for Cebuano, but spelling in print usually follow the pronunciation of Standard Cebuano, regardless of how it is actually spoken by the speaker. For example, &quot;baláy&quot; (&quot;house&quot;) is pronounced in Standard Cebuano and is thus spelled &quot;baláy&quot;, even in Urban Cebuano where it is actually pronounced .

Cebuano is spoken natively over a large area of the Philippines and thus has numerous regional dialects. It can vary significantly in terms of lexicon and phonology depending on where it is spoken. Increasing usage of spoken English (being the primary language of commerce and education in the Philippines) has also led to the introduction of new pronunciations and spellings of old Cebuano words. Code-switching forms of English and Bisaya (Bislish) are also common among the educated younger generations.

There are four main dialectal groups within Cebuano aside from Standard Cebuano and Urban Cebuano. They are as follows:

=== Boholano ===
The Boholano dialect of Bohol shares many similarities with the southern form of Standard Cebuano. It is also spoken in some parts of Siquijor and parts of Northern Mindanao. Boholano, especially as spoken in central Bohol, can be distinguished from other Cebuano variants by a few phonetic changes:
* The semivowel &quot;y&quot; is pronounced : &quot;iyá&quot; is pronounced ;
* &quot;Akó&quot; is pronounced as ;

=== Leyte ===

====Southern Kanâ====
Southern Kanâ is a dialect of both southern Leyte and Southern Leyte provinces; it is closest to the Mindanao Cebuano dialect at the southern area and northern Cebu dialect at the northern boundaries. Both North and South Kana are subgroups of Leyteño dialect. Both of these dialects are spoken in western and central Leyte and in the southern province, but Boholano is more concentrated in Maasin City.

==== Northern Kanâ ====
Northern Kanâ (found in the northern part of Leyte), is closest to the variety of the language spoken in northern part of Leyte, and shows significant influence from Waray-Waray, quite notably in its pace which speakers from Cebu find very fast, and its more mellow tone (compared to the urban Cebu City dialect, which Kana speakers find &quot;rough&quot;). A distinguishing feature of this dialect is the reduction of prominent, but an often unnoticed feature of this dialect is the labialisation of and into , when these phonemes come before , and , velarisation of and into before , and , and the dentalisation of and into before , and and sometimes, before vowels and other consonants as well.

=== Mindanao ===
This is the variety of Cebuano spoken throughout most of Mindanao, and it is the standard dialect of Cebuano in Northern Mindanao.

==== Davaoeño ====


A branch of Mindanaoan Cebuano in Davao is also known as Davaoeño (not to be confused with the Davao variant of Chavacano which is called &quot;Castellano Abakay&quot;). Like the Cebuano of Luzon, it contains some Tagalog vocabulary, which speakers may use even more frequently than in Luzon Cebuano. Its grammar is similar to that of other varieties; however, current speakers exhibit uniquely strong Tagalog influence in their speech by substituting most Cebuano words with Tagalog ones. This is because the older generations speak Tagalog to their children in home settings, and Cebuano is spoken in other everyday settings, making Tagalog the secondary lingua franca. One characteristic of this dialect is the practice of saying &quot;atà&quot;, derived from Tagalog &quot;yatà&quot;, to denote uncertainty in a speaker&#x27;s aforementioned statements. For instance, a Davaoeño might say &quot;Tuá man atà sa baláy si Manuel&quot; instead of &quot;Tuá man tingáli sa baláy si Manuel&quot;. The word &quot;atà&quot; does exist in Cebuano, though it means &#x27;squid ink&#x27; in contrast to Tagalog (e.g. atà sa nukos).

Other examples include: &quot;Nibabâ ko sa jeep sa kanto, tapos niulî ko sa among baláy&quot; (&quot;I got off the jeepney at the street corner, and then I went home&quot;) instead of &quot;Ninaog ko sa jeep sa eskina, dayon niulî ko sa among baláy&quot;. The words &quot;babâ&quot; and &quot;naog&quot; mean &quot;to disembark&quot; or &quot;to go down&quot;, &quot;kanto&quot; and &quot;eskina&quot; mean &quot;street corner&quot;, while &quot;tapos&quot; and &quot;dayon&quot; mean &quot;then&quot;; in these cases, the former word is Tagalog, and the latter is Cebuano. Davaoeño speakers may also sometimes add Bagobo or Mansakan vocabulary to their speech, as in &quot;Madayawng adlaw, amigo, kumusta ka?&quot; (&quot;Good day, friend, how are you?&quot;, literally &quot;Good morning/afternoon&quot;) rather than &quot;Maayong adlaw, amigo, kumusta ka?&quot; The words &quot;madayaw&quot; and &quot;maayo&quot; both mean &#x27;good&#x27;, though the former is Bagobo and the latter Cebuano.

One of the famous characteristics of this dialect is disregarding the agreement between the verb &quot;To go (Adto, Anha, Anhi, Ari)&quot; and locative demonstratives (Didto, Dinha, Dinhi, Diri) or the distance of the object/place. In Cebu Cebuano dialect, when the verb &quot;to go&quot; is distal (far from both the speaker and the listener), the locative demonstrative must be distal as well (e.g. &quot;Adto didto&quot;&quot;.&quot; Not &quot;&quot;Adto diri&quot; or &quot;Anha didto&quot;&quot;). In Davaoeño Cebuano on the other hand does not necessarily follow that grammar. Speakers tend to say &quot;Adto diri&quot; instead of &quot;Ari diri&quot; probably due to grammar borrowing from Hiligaynon because &quot;kadto/mokadto&quot; is the Hiligaynon word for &quot;come&quot; or &quot;go&quot; in general regardless the distance.

===Negros===

The Cebuano dialect in Negros is somewhat similar to Standard Cebuano (spoken by the majority of the provincial areas of Cebu), with distinct Hiligaynon influences. It is distinctive in retaining sounds and longer word forms as well. It is the primary dialectal language of the entire province of Negros Oriental and northeastern parts of Negros Occidental (while the majority of the latter province and its bordered areas speaks Hiligaynon/Ilonggo), as well as some parts of Siquijor. Examples of Negrense Cebuano&#x27;s distinction from other Cebuano dialects is the usage of the word &quot;maot&quot; instead of &quot;batî&quot; (&quot;ugly&quot;), &quot;alálay&quot;, &quot;kalálag&quot; instead of &quot;kalag-kalag&quot; (Halloween), &quot;kabaló/kahibaló&quot; and &quot;kaágo/kaantígo&quot; instead of &quot;kabawó/kahíbawó&quot; (&quot;know&quot;).

=== Luzon ===
There is no specific Luzonian dialect of Cebuano, as speakers of Cebuano in Luzon come from many different regions in Central Visayas and Mindanao. Cebuano-speaking people from Luzon can be easily recognized in the Visayas primarily by their vocabulary, which incorporates Tagalog words. Their accents and some aspects of their grammar can also sometimes exhibit Tagalog influence. Such Tagalog-influenced Cebuano dialects are sometimes colloquially known as &quot;Bisalog&quot; (a portmanteau of Tagalog and Bisaya).

===Saksak sinagol===
The term in context means &quot;a collection of miscellaneous things&quot; or literally &quot;inserted mixture&quot;, thus the few other Cebuano-influenced regions that have a variety of regional languages use this term to refer to their dialects with considerable incorporated Cebuano words. Examples of these regions can be found in places like Masbate.

<text>BBC Television is a service of the BBC. The corporation has operated a public broadcast television service in the United Kingdom, under the terms of a royal charter, since 1927. It produced television programmes from its own studios from 1932, although the start of its regular service of television broadcasts is dated to 2 November 1936.

The BBC&#x27;s domestic television channels have no commercial advertising and collectively they accounted for more than 30% of all UK viewing in 2013. The services are funded by a television licence.

As a result of the 2016 Licence Fee settlement, the BBC Television division was split, with in-house television production being separated into a new division called BBC Studios and the remaining parts of television (channels and genre commissioning, BBC Sport and BBC iPlayer) being renamed BBC Content.

==History of BBC Television==
The BBC operates several television networks, television stations (although there is generally very little distinction between the two terms in the UK), and related programming services in the United Kingdom. As well as being a broadcaster, the corporation also produces a large number of its own outsourcing programmes and thereby ranks as one of the world&#x27;s largest television production companies.

===Early years (before 1939)===
John Logie Baird set up the Baird Television Development Company in 1926; on 30 September 1929, he made the first experimental television broadcast for the BBC from its studio in Long Acre in the Covent Garden area of London via the BBC&#x27;s London radio transmitter propagating an analog signal. Baird used his electromechanical system with a vertically scanned image of 30 lines, which is just enough resolution for a close-up of one person, and a bandwidth low enough to use existing radio transmitters. The simultaneous transmission of sound and pictures was achieved on 30 March 1930, by using the BBC&#x27;s new twin transmitter at Brookmans Park. By late 1930, thirty minutes of morning programmes were broadcast from Monday to Friday, and thirty minutes at midnight on Tuesdays and Fridays after BBC radio went off the air. Baird&#x27;s broadcasts via the BBC continued until June 1932.

The BBC began its own regular television programming from the basement of Broadcasting House, London, on 22 August 1932. The studio moved to larger quarters in 16 Portland Place, London, in February 1934, and continued broadcasting the 30-line images, carried by telephone line to the medium wave transmitter at Brookmans Park, until 11 September 1935, by which time advances in the all-electronic 405-line television system made electromechanical broadcasts and systems obsolete.

Following a series of test transmissions and special broadcasts that began in August 1936, the BBC Television Service officially launched at 3:00 in the afternoon on 2 November 1936 from a converted wing of Alexandra Palace in London. The opening day&#x27;s programming started using the Baird System at 3.00 pm with &quot;Opening of the B.B.C. television service by Major G. C. Tryon&quot;, the Postmaster General of the United Kingdom, followed by the latest British Movietone News newsreel at 3.15 and a 10-minute variety show with Adele Dixon and the African-American duo of Buck and Bubbles and the B.B.C. Television Orchestra. At 4.00, the same programme was shown using the Marconi-E.M.I. System. &quot;Ally Pally&quot; housed two studios, various scenery stores, make-up areas, dressing rooms, offices, and the transmitter itself, which then broadcast on the VHF band. BBC television initially used two systems on alternate weeks: the 240-line Baird intermediate film system and the Marconi-EMI 405-line television system. The use of both formats made the BBC&#x27;s service the world&#x27;s first regular high-definition television service; it broadcast from Monday to Saturday between 15:00 and 16:00, and 21:00 and 22:00. The first programme broadcast – and thus the first ever, on a dedicated TV channel – was &quot;Opening of the BBC Television Service&quot; at 15:00. The first major outside broadcast was the coronation of George VI and Elizabeth in May 1937.

The two systems were to run on a trial basis for six months; early television sets supported both resolutions. However, the Baird system, which used a mechanical camera for filmed programming and Farnsworth image dissector cameras for live programming, proved too cumbersome and visually inferior, and ended with closedown (at 22:00) on Saturday 30 January 1937. It was advertised in &quot;Radio Times&quot; for two weeks later but the decision to end the Baird system was made too late for it be changed in the printed &quot;Radio Times&quot;.

Initially, the station&#x27;s range was officially a 40 kilometres radius of the Alexandra Palace transmitter—in practice, however, transmissions could be picked up a good deal further away, and on one occasion in 1938 were picked up by engineers at RCA in New York, who were experimenting with a British television set. The service was reaching an estimated 25,000–40,000 homes before the outbreak of World War II which caused the BBC Television service to be suspended on 1 September 1939 with little warning.

===Wartime closure (1939–1946)===
On 1 September 1939, the station went off the air; the government was concerned that the VHF transmissions would act as a beacon to enemy aircraft homing in on London. Also, many of the television service&#x27;s technical staff and engineers would be needed for the war effort, in particular on the radar programme. The last programme transmitted was a Mickey Mouse cartoon, &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Gala Premier&quot; (1933), which was followed by test transmissions; this account refuted the popular memory according to which broadcasting was suspended before the end of the cartoon.

According to figures from Britain&#x27;s Radio Manufacturers Association, 18,999 television sets had been manufactured from 1936 to September 1939, when production was halted by the war.

===The remaining monopoly years (1946–1955)===
BBC Television returned on 7 June 1946 at 15:00. Jasmine Bligh, one of the original announcers, made the first announcement, saying, &#x27;Good afternoon everybody. How are you? Do you remember me, Jasmine Bligh? Well here we are after a lapse of nearly seven years ready to start again and of course we are all terribly excited and thrilled...&#x27; The Mickey Mouse cartoon of 1939 was repeated twenty minutes later. On 31 December the BBC broadcast &quot;First-year Flashbacks&quot;, a compilation of the year&#x27;s highlights. An edited copy is now the oldest programme on the BBC&#x27;s iPlayer streaming service.

Alexandra Palace was the home base of the channel until the early 1950s, when the majority of production moved into the newly acquired Lime Grove Studios. Postwar broadcast coverage was extended to Birmingham in 1949, with the opening of the Sutton Coldfield transmitting station on 17 December, and by the mid-1950s most of the country was covered, transmitting a 405-line interlaced video image on VHF.

===1964 to 1967===
BBC TV was split into BBC1 and BBC2 in 1964, with BBC2 having a remit to provide more niche programming. The channel was due to launch on 20 April 1964, but this was postponed after a fire at Battersea Power Station resulted in most of west London, including Television Centre, losing power. A videotape made on the opening night was rediscovered in 2003 by a BBC technician. The launch went ahead the following night, beginning with host Denis Tuohy sarcastically blowing out a candle. BBC2 was the first British channel to use UHF and 625-line pictures, giving higher definition than the existing VHF 405-line television system.

===1967 to 2003===

On 1 July 1967, BBC Two became the first television channel in Europe to broadcast regularly in colour, using the West German PAL system that was used for decades until it was gradually superseded by digital systems. (BBC One and ITV began 625-line colour broadcasts simultaneously on 15 November 1969). Unlike other terrestrial channels, BBC Two does not have soap opera or standard news programming, but a range of programmes intended to be eclectic and diverse (although if a programme has high audience ratings it is often eventually repositioned to BBC One). The different remit of BBC2 allowed its first controller, David Attenborough to commission the first heavyweight documentaries and documentary series such as &quot;Civilisation&quot;, &quot;The Ascent of Man&quot; and &quot;Horizon&quot;.

Attenborough was later granted sabbatical leave from his job as Controller to work with the BBC Studios Natural History Unit which had existed since the 1950s. This unit is now famed throughout the world for producing high quality programmes with Attenborough such as &quot;Life on Earth&quot;, &quot;The Private Life of Plants&quot;, &quot;The Blue Planet&quot;, &quot;The Life of Mammals&quot;, &quot;Planet Earth&quot; and &quot;Frozen Planet&quot;.

National and regional variations also occur within the BBC One and BBC Two schedules. England&#x27;s BBC One output is split up into fifteen regions (such as South West and East), which exist mainly to produce local news programming, but also occasionally opt out of the network to show programmes of local importance (such as major local events). The other nations of the United Kingdom (Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland) have been granted more autonomy from the English network; for example, programmes are mostly introduced by local announcers, rather than by those in London. BBC One and BBC Two schedules in the other UK nations can vary immensely from BBC One and BBC Two in England.

Programmes, such as the politically fuelled &quot;Give My Head Peace&quot; (produced by BBC Northern Ireland) and the soap opera &quot;River City&quot; (produced by BBC Scotland), have been created specifically to cater for some viewers in their respective nations. BBC Scotland produces daily programmes for its Gaelic-speaking viewers, including current affairs, political and children&#x27;s programming such as the popular &quot;Eòrpa&quot; and &quot;Dè a-nis?&quot;. BBC Wales also produces a large amount of Welsh language programming for S4C, particularly news, sport and other programmes, especially the soap opera &quot;Pobol y Cwm&quot; (&#x27;People of the Valley&#x27;) briefly shown on BBC2 across the UK with subtitles in the 1990s. The UK nations also produce a number of programmes that are shown across the UK, such as BBC Scotland&#x27;s comedy series &quot;Chewin&#x27; the Fat&quot;, and BBC Northern Ireland&#x27;s talk show &quot;Patrick Kielty Almost Live&quot;.

During the 1980s, the BBC came under pressure to commission more programmes from independent British production companies, and following the Broadcasting Act 1990 it was legally required to source 25% of its output from such companies by the terms of the Act. This eventually led to the creation of the &quot;WoCC&quot; (Window of Creative Competition) for independent production companies to pitch programmes to the BBC.

Programmes have also been imported mainly from English-speaking countries: notable—though no longer shown—examples include &quot;The Simpsons&quot; from the United States and &quot;Neighbours&quot; from Australia. Programming from countries outside the English-speaking world consisted of feature films, shown in the original language with subtitles instead of being dubbed, with dubbing only used for cartoons and children&#x27;s programmes. These included programmes from Eastern Europe, including &quot;The Singing Ringing Tree&quot; from East Germany, although voice-over translation was used instead of dubbing for budgetary reasons.

Ceefax, the first teletext service, launched on 23 September 1974. This service allowed BBC viewers to view textual information such as the latest news on their television. CEEFAX did not make a full transition to digital television, instead being gradually replaced, from late onwards, by the new interactive BBCi service before being fully closed down on 22 October 2012.

In March 2003 the BBC announced that from the end of May 2003 (subsequently deferred to 14 July) it intended to transmit all eight of its domestic television channels (including the 15 regional variations of BBC1) unencrypted from the Astra 2D satellite. This move was estimated to save the BBC £85 million over the next five years.

While the &quot;footprint&quot; of the Astra 2D satellite was smaller than that of Astra 2A, from which it was previously broadcast encrypted, it meant that viewers with appropriate equipment were able to receive BBC channels &quot;free-to-air&quot; over much of Western Europe. Consequently, some rights concerns have needed to be resolved with programme providers such as Hollywood studios and sporting organisations, which have expressed concern about the unencrypted signal leaking out. This led to some broadcasts being made unavailable on the Sky Digital platform, such as Scottish Premier League and Scottish Cup football, while on other platforms such broadcasts were not disrupted. Later, when rights contracts were renewed, this problem was resolved.

===2006 onwards===
The BBC Television department headed by Jana Bennett was absorbed into a new, much larger group; BBC Vision, in late 2006. The new group was part of larger restructuring within the BBC with the onset of new media outlets and technology.

In 2008, the BBC began experimenting with live streaming of certain channels in the UK, and in November 2008, all standard BBC television channels were made available to watch online via BBC iPlayer.

When Tony Hall became Director General in April 2013, he reverted the division to its original name of BBC Television. As Television it was responsible for the commissioning, scheduling and broadcasting of all programming on the BBC&#x27;s television channels and online, as well as producing content for broadcast.

Following the 2016 Licence Fee settlement, BBC Television was split into two divisions, with in-house television production being separated into a new division called BBC Studios controlled by Mark Linsey and the remaining parts of television (channels and genre commissioning, BBC Sport and BBC iPlayer) being renamed as BBC Content, controlled by Charlotte Moore. As a result, the BBC Television division is now known internally as BBC Content and &quot;BBC Television&quot; as an entity has ceased to exist.

On 8 December 2020, Moore announced a new leadership structure for BBC Content taking effect in April 2021, which will prioritise iPlayer in order to compete with commercial streaming services. The role of Controller for BBC One, Two, and Four will be scrapped, in favour of giving the BBC&#x27;s genre heads autonomy in commissioning programmes without the requirement for a channel controller to provide secondary approval. A team of &quot;portfolio editors&quot; will select from these commissions for carriage on BBC television channels and iPlayer, with iPlayer Controller Dan McGolpin will becoming Portfolio Director for iPlayer and channels. McGolpin and the genre heads will report to Moore.

In July 2022, the BBC announced plans to merge BBC News (for UK audiences) and BBC World News (for international audiences) as one international news network, under the name BBC News, covering news from both the UK and around the world. The merger took effect in April 2023.

In November 2024, six BBC FAST channels were added to Australia&#x27;s 9Now platform.

==Funding==

The BBC domestic television channels do not broadcast advertisements; they are instead funded by a television licence fee which TV viewers are required to pay annually. This includes viewers who watch real-time streams or catch up services of the BBC&#x27;s channels online or via their mobile phone. The BBC&#x27;s international television channels are funded by advertisements and subscription.

<doc id="352311" wikidata="Q17033939" url="?curid=352311" title="Timber slide">
<text>A timber slide is a device for moving timber past rapids and waterfalls. Their use in Canada was widespread in the 18th and 19th century timber trade. At this time, cut timber would be floated down rivers in large timber rafts from logging camps to ports such as Montreal and Saint John, New Brunswick. Rapids and waterfalls would, however, damage the wood and could potentially cause log jams. Thus at these locations timber slides were constructed. These were thin water filled chutes that would run parallel to the river. They would usually only be wide enough for a single log and one at a time the logs would be directed down it. The idea is attributed to Ruggles Wright who introduced the first one in 1829 not far from what is today down-town Hull, Quebec, Canada. Later, the slides could often be up to a kilometre in length. They were most commonly found on the Ottawa River system. The Bonnechere River in Eastern Ontario had five chutes along the waterway before emptying into the Ottawa River.

In some areas the timber slide became a tourist attraction, the most notable being the 1.2 km chute bypassing the Chaudière Falls on the Ottawa River in Ottawa. Its most notable visitors are the Duke of York, who later became King George V, and his wife, the Duchess of York Mary of Teck.

Timber slides disappeared after the construction of canal networks and the decline of the timber trade. They were almost all out of service by the First World War.

<text>Hot Fudge (also known as The Hot Fudge Show) is an American children&#x27;s television series that was produced in Detroit by WXYZ-TV (owned and operated at the time by ABC) and distributed by the Lexington Broadcast Services Company. Originally airing only in Detroit beginning in 1974, the show grew in popularity and was syndicated nationally from 1976 to 1980; a few of WXYZ&#x27;s sister ABC-owned stations (including KGO and WLS) carried the program.

==Overview==
Featuring music, songs, and sketches with live actors and puppets (known as the &quot;Mits&quot;) in a manner similar to &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, the show was originally hosted by Arte Johnson. The duo of the bearded musician Larry (Larry Santos) and green, fuzzy, monster-like puppet Seymour (voiced by producer Bob Elnicky) took over after the first season.

Glenn Denver, a puppet parody of John Denver, released an album titled &quot;Glenn Denver Sings Country Songs from the Hot Fudge T.V. Show&quot;. Three other &quot;Hot Fudge&quot; albums were released; The Electric Fuzz&#x27;s &quot;Rock &#x27;N Roll from the Hot Fudge T.V. Show&quot;, &quot;Larry and Seymour Sing Songs from the Hot Fudge T.V. Show&quot;, and &quot;Hooray For Friendship and 9 Other Hits from the Hot Fudge T.V. Show, Plus Nine More&quot;. All of the albums have been released on CD.

A &quot;Hot Fudge&quot; episode was submitted to the University of Georgia for a Peabody Award in 1974; though not selected for the award itself, it was retained for the university&#x27;s Peabody Awards Collection Archives. The show won a Puppeteers of America ACT AWARD in 1976.

==Sketches and characters==
* Holy Moley!: A sketch where a simple-minded man (Ron Coden) tries to outwit problems, but gets socked back.
* Name That Feeling: Professor Emotion (Ron Coden) hosts a parody of &quot;Name That Tune&quot; in which there were two versions:
::Version 1 (Seasons 1 &amp; 2): The day&#x27;s &quot;Secret Feeling&quot; is revealed, the puppet contestant is introduced and Professor Emotion tries to get the contestant to feel the &quot;Secret Feeling&quot; shown under the window of the contestant&#x27;s &quot;isolation booth&quot;
::Version 2 (Seasons 3 &amp; 4): Puppet contestants watch a video clip of other puppets and try to guess how they feel. This is shown in two parts with an in-show commercial sandwiched in-between.
* Write On!: A segment where many of the puppet characters read jokes or riddles sent in by kids.
* Newsreel: Film footage of various items such as paper being produced would be narrated by various kids in the style of a newsreel.
* Unreasonable Report: News sketches featuring Harry Unreasonable, a parody of news anchor Harry Reasoner.
* Hot Fudge Gang/The Mits/Happening!: Various sketches featuring children and adults.
* Detective Tomato (Ron Coden) giving advice to children then leaving through the door behind him, only to have something happen to him when he goes through.
* Elton Seymour: Seymour playing a tune in the guise of Elton John, usually featured at the beginning of the show.
* Mr. Nasty (Ron Coden), who loves being booed by his audience, gives tips on how to be as nasty as him...only to have the tables turned on him by his landlady in the end, prompting the audience to applaud. 
* Amanda Caruthers (later replaced by Yolanda Williams) portraying various characters in sketches, often giving kindly advice to the inquiring puppets.

==2007 reunion special==
On Wednesday, December 5, 2007, Detroit PBS member station WTVS presented a 90-minute reunion special, featuring the original cast, including Larry and Seymour. The special featured memories of the program interspersed with clips from the series. A rerun of the episode was aired on December 14, 2007.

<text>Europoort (, , also &quot;Europort&quot;) is an area of the Port of Rotterdam and the adjoining industrial area in the Netherlands. Being situated at Southside of the mouth of the rivers Rhine and Meuse with the hinterland consisting of the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium and partly France, Europoort is one of the world&#x27;s busiest ports and considered a major entry to Europe. The port handled 12 million containers in 2015.

The Europoort area is very heavily industrialised with petrochemical refineries and storage tanks, bulk iron ore and coal handling as well as container and new motor vehicle terminals.

Europoort is situated on the South bank of the Nieuwe Waterweg, same as the Maasvlakte area. On the Northern bank of the Nieuwe Waterweg one could find Hook of Holland (in Dutch: Hoek van Holland).

==Development of Europoort==
Rotterdam has developed from a small town into a major harbour city. In earlier centuries, docks were built on the banks of the Nieuwe Maas river. In the 19th century, connections between Rotterdam and the North Sea were poor, with a large estuary/delta area with many small waterways between them. Ships had to sail around Voorne-Putten to go out to sea. This could take several days or even weeks.

To improve the situation, the &quot;Nieuwe Waterweg&quot; (&quot;New Waterway&quot;), a large canal, was designed to connect the Rhine and Meuse rivers to the sea. The &quot;Nieuwe Waterweg&quot;, designed by Pieter Caland, was to be partly dug, then to further deepen the canal bed by the natural flow of the water. Ultimately however, the last part had to be dug also. Nevertheless, Rotterdam from now on had a direct connection between the sea and harbour areas with sufficient depth. The &quot;Nieuwe Waterweg&quot; has since been deepened several times.

Over the years the port was further developed seaward by building new docks and harbour-basins. In the 1970s the port was extended into the sea at the south side of the mouth of the Nieuwe Waterweg by completion of the &quot;Maasvlakte&quot; (Meuse-plain), a large land reclamation area with even more refineries and storage tanks. This project was called &quot;Europoort&quot;, literally the &quot;Gate to Europe&quot;. The Maasvlakte 2 project is extending Europoort even further seaward, but the UK-Netherlands border is set equidistantly from the IJmuiden harbour coast line and remains unaffected by the expansion.

In the past five years the industrialized skyline has been changed by the addition of large numbers of wind turbines taking advantage of the exposed coastal conditions.

==Factors for Europoort&#x27;s success==
The most important factor contributing to the large amount of cargo shipping in and out of Europort is the presence of the Maas (Meuse) and Rhine rivers. Through these rivers, Europoort is connected to the Ruhr Area in Germany as well as Switzerland, Belgium and France. Furthermore, Europoort is connected to its rival, the port of Antwerp by the Scheldt–Rhine Canal. Adding to its transit-function, Rotterdam is connected to Germany by the A15 highway and a railway-network. In 2007, an extra railway connection (the &quot;Betuweroute&quot;) was completed to create an extra connection to the Ruhr area.

The P&amp;O passenger/car/lorry overnight ferry service to Hull, England, operates from Europoort using 2 ferries: the Pride of Rotterdam and the Pride of Hull.

<text>A sawmill (saw mill, saw-mill) or lumber mill is a facility where logs are cut into lumber. Modern sawmills use a motorized saw to cut logs lengthwise to make long pieces, and crosswise to length depending on standard or custom sizes (dimensional lumber). The &quot;portable&quot; sawmill is simple to operate. The log lies flat on a steel bed, and the motorized saw cuts the log horizontally along the length of the bed, by the operator manually pushing the saw. The most basic kind of sawmill consists of a chainsaw and a customized jig (&quot;Alaskan sawmill&quot;), with similar horizontal operation.

Before the invention of the sawmill, boards were made in various manual ways, either rived (split) and planed, hewn, or more often hand sawn by two men with a whipsaw, one above and another in a saw pit below. The earliest known mechanical mill is the Hierapolis sawmill, a Roman water-powered stone mill at Hierapolis, Asia Minor dating back to the 3rd century AD. Other water-powered mills followed and by the 11th century they were widespread in Spain and North Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia, and in the next few centuries, spread across Europe. The circular motion of the wheel was converted to a reciprocating motion at the saw blade. Generally, only the saw was powered, and the logs had to be loaded and moved by hand. An early improvement was the development of a movable carriage, also water powered, to move the log steadily through the saw blade.

By the time of the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century, the circular saw blade had been invented, and with the development of steam power in the 19th century, a much greater degree of mechanisation was possible. Scrap lumber from the mill provided a source of fuel for firing the boiler. The arrival of railroads meant that logs could be transported to mills rather than mills being built beside navigable waterways. By 1900, the largest sawmill in the world was operated by the Atlantic Coast Lumber Company in Georgetown, South Carolina, using logs floated down the Pee Dee River from the Appalachian Mountains. In the 20th century the introduction of electricity and high technology furthered this process, and now most sawmills are massive and expensive facilities in which most aspects of the work are computerized. Besides the sawn timber, use is made of all the by-products including sawdust, bark, woodchips, and wood pellets, creating a diverse offering of forest products.

==Sawmill process==

A sawmill&#x27;s basic operation is much like those of hundreds of years ago: a log enters on one end and dimensional lumber exits on the other end.
* After trees are selected for harvest, the next step in logging is felling the trees, and bucking them to length.
* Branches are cut off the trunk. This is known as &quot;limbing&quot;.
* Logs are taken by logging truck, rail or a log drive to the sawmill.
* Logs are scaled either on the way to the mill or upon arrival at the mill.
* Debarking removes bark from the logs.
* &quot;Decking&quot; is the process for sorting the logs by species, size and end use (lumber, plywood, chips).
* A sawyer uses a head saw (also called head rig or primary saw) to break the log into cants (unfinished logs to be further processed) and flitches (unfinished planks).
* Depending upon the species and quality of the log, the cants will either be further broken down by a resaw or a gang edger into multiple flitches and/or boards.
* &quot;Edging&quot; will take the flitch and trim off all irregular edges leaving four-sided lumber.
* &quot;Trimming&quot; squares the ends at typical lumber lengths.
* &quot;Drying&quot; removes naturally occurring moisture from the lumber. This can be done with kilns or air-dried.
* &quot;Planing&quot; smooths the surface of the lumber leaving a uniform width and thickness.
* &quot;Shipping&quot; transports the finished lumber to market.

==History==
===Pre–Industrial Revolution===

The Hierapolis sawmill, a water-powered stone sawmill at Hierapolis, Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey, then part of the Roman Empire), dating to the second half of the 3rd century, is the earliest known sawmill. It also incorporates a crank and connecting rod mechanism.

Water-powered stone sawmills working with cranks and connecting rods, but without gear train, are archaeologically attested for the 6th century at the Byzantine cities Gerasa (in Asia Minor) and Ephesus (in Syria).

The earliest literary reference to a working sawmill comes from a Roman poet, Ausonius, who wrote a topographical poem about the river Moselle in Germany in the late 4th century AD. At one point in the poem, he describes the shrieking sound of a watermill cutting marble. Marble sawmills also seem to be indicated by the Christian saint Gregory of Nyssa from Anatolia around 370–390 AD, demonstrating a diversified use of water-power in many parts of the Roman Empire.

Sawmills later became widespread in medieval Europe, as one was sketched by Villard de Honnecourt in c. 1225–1235. They are claimed to have been introduced to Madeira following its discovery in c. 1420 and spread widely in Europe in the 16th century.

Prior to the invention of the sawmill, boards were rived (split) and planed, or more often sawn by two men with a whipsaw, using saddleblocks to hold the log, and a saw pit for the pitman who worked below. Sawing was slow, and required strong and hearty men. The topsawer had to be the stronger of the two because the saw was pulled in turn by each man, and the lower had the advantage of gravity. The topsawyer also had to guide the saw so that the board was of even thickness. This was often done by following a chalkline.

Early sawmills simply adapted the whipsaw to mechanical power, generally driven by a water wheel to speed up the process. The circular motion of the wheel was changed to back-and-forth motion of the saw blade by a connecting rod known as a &quot;pitman arm&quot; (thus introducing a term used in many mechanical applications).

Generally, only the saw was powered, and the logs had to be loaded and moved by hand. An early improvement was the development of a movable carriage, also water powered, to move the log steadily through the saw blade.

A type of sawmill without a crank is known from Germany called &quot;knock and drop&quot; or simply &quot;drop&quot; -mills. In these drop sawmills, the frame carrying the saw blade is knocked upwards by cams as the shaft turns. These cams are let into the shaft on which the waterwheel sits. When the frame carrying the saw blade is in the topmost position it drops by its own weight, making a loud knocking noise, and in so doing it cuts the trunk.

A small mill such as this would be the center of many rural communities in wood-exporting regions such as the Baltic countries and Canada. The output of such mills would be quite low, perhaps only 500 boards per day. They would also generally only operate during the winter, the peak logging season.

In the United States, the sawmill was introduced soon after the colonisation of Virginia by recruiting skilled men from Hamburg.
Later the metal parts were obtained from the Netherlands, where the technology was far ahead of that in England, where the sawmill remained largely unknown until the late 18th century. The arrival of a sawmill was a large and stimulative step in the growth of a frontier community.
The Dutch windmill owner Cornelis Corneliszoon van Uitgeest invented in 1594 the wind-powered sawmill, which made the conversion of log timber into planks 30 times faster than before. His wind-powered sawmill used a crankshaft to convert a windmill&#x27;s circular motion into a back-and-forward motion powering the saw, and was granted a patent for the technique.

===Industrial Revolution===
Early mills had been taken to the forest, where a temporary shelter was built, and the logs were skidded to the nearby mill by horse or ox teams, often when there was some snow to provide lubrication. As mills grew larger, they were usually established in more permanent facilities on a river, and the logs were floated down to them by log drivers. Sawmills built on navigable rivers, lakes, or estuaries were called cargo mills because of the availability of ships transporting cargoes of logs to the sawmill and cargoes of lumber from the sawmill.

The next improvement was the use of circular saw blades, perhaps invented in England in the late 18th century, but perhaps in 17th-century Netherlands. Soon thereafter, millers used gangsaws, which added additional blades so that a log would be reduced to boards in one quick step. Circular saw blades were extremely expensive and highly subject to damage by overheating or dirty logs. A new kind of technician arose, the sawfiler. Sawfilers were highly skilled in metalworking. Their main job was to &quot;set&quot; and sharpen teeth. The craft also involved learning how to &quot;hammer&quot; a saw, whereby a saw is deformed with a hammer and anvil to counteract the forces of heat and cutting. Modern circular saw blades have replaceable teeth, but still need to be hammered.
The introduction of steam power in the 19th century created many new possibilities for mills. Availability of railroad transportation for logs and lumber encouraged building of rail mills away from navigable water. Steam powered sawmills could be far more mechanized. Scrap lumber from the mill provided a ready fuel source for firing the boiler. Efficiency was increased, but the capital cost of a new mill increased dramatically as well.

In addition, the use of steam or gasoline-powered traction engines also allowed the entire sawmill to be mobile.

By 1900, the largest sawmill in the world was operated by the Atlantic Lumber Company in Georgetown, South Carolina, using logs floated down the Pee Dee River from as far as the edge of the Appalachian Mountains in North Carolina.

A restoration project for Sturgeon&#x27;s Mill in Northern California is underway, restoring one of the last steam-powered lumber mills still using its original equipment.

==Current trends==

In the twentieth century the introduction of electricity and high technology furthered this process, and now most sawmills are massive and expensive facilities in which most aspects of the work is computerized. The cost of a new facility with capacity is up to CAN$120,000,000. A modern operation will produce between annually.

Small gasoline-powered sawmills run by local entrepreneurs served many communities in the early twentieth century, and specialty markets still today.

A trend is the small portable sawmill for personal or even professional use. Many different models have emerged with different designs and functions. They are especially suitable for producing limited volumes of boards, or specialty milling such as oversized timber. Portable sawmills have gained popularity for the convenience of bringing the sawmill to the logs and milling lumber in remote locations. Some remote communities that have experienced natural disasters have used portable sawmills to rebuild their communities out of the fallen trees.

Technology has changed sawmill operations significantly in recent years, emphasizing increasing profits through waste minimization and increased energy efficiency as well as improving operator safety. The once-ubiquitous rusty, steel conical sawdust burners have for the most part vanished, as the sawdust and other mill waste is now processed into particleboard and related products, or used to heat wood-drying kilns. Co-generation facilities will produce power for the operation and may also feed superfluous energy onto the grid. While the bark may be ground for landscaping barkdust, it may also be burned for heat. Sawdust may make particle board or be pressed into wood pellets for pellet stoves. The larger pieces of wood that will not make lumber are chipped into wood chips and provide a source of supply for paper mills. Wood by-products of the mills will also make oriented strand board (OSB) paneling for building construction, a cheaper and in some use cases more robust alternative to plywood for paneling. Some automatic mills can process 800 small logs into bark chips, wood chips, sawdust and sorted, stacked, and bound planks, in an hour.

<text>Pinus albicaulis, known by the common names whitebark pine, white bark pine, white pine, pitch pine, scrub pine, and creeping pine, is a conifer tree native to the mountains of the western United States and Canada, specifically subalpine areas of the Sierra Nevada, Cascade Range, Pacific Coast Ranges, Rocky Mountains, and Ruby Mountains. It shares the common name &quot;creeping pine&quot; with several other plants.

The whitebark pine is typically the highest-elevation pine tree found in these mountain ranges and often marks the tree line. Thus, it is often found as &quot;krummholz&quot;, trees growing close to the ground that have been dwarfed by exposure. In more favorable conditions, the trees may grow to in height.

==Identification==
Whitebark pine is a member of the white pine group, the &quot;Pinus&quot; subgenus &quot;Strobus&quot;, and the section &quot;Strobus&quot;; like all members of this group, the leaves (needles) are in fascicles (bundles) of five with a deciduous sheath. This distinguishes whitebark pine and its relatives from the lodgepole pine (&quot;Pinus contorta&quot;), with two needles per fascicle, as well as the ponderosa pine (&quot;Pinus ponderosa&quot;) and Jeffrey pine (&quot;Pinus jeffreyi&quot;), which both have three needles per fascicle; all three of these species also have a persistent sheath at the base of each fascicle. Whitebark pine owes its name to the light gray bark of its young specimens.

Distinguishing whitebark pine (&quot;Pinus albicaulis&quot;), from the related limber pine (&quot;Pinus flexilis&quot;), also a member of the white pine group, is much more difficult, and usually requires seed or pollen cones. In &quot;Pinus albicaulis&quot;, the seed-bearing female cones are long, dark purple when immature, and do not open on drying, but the scales easily break when they are removed by the Clark&#x27;s nutcracker to harvest the seeds; rarely are there intact old cones in the litter beneath the trees. Its pollen cones are scarlet.

In &quot;Pinus flexilis&quot;, the cones are long, green when immature, and open to release the seeds; the scales are not fragile. Their pollen cones are yellow, and there are usually intact old cones found beneath them.

Whitebark pine can also be hard to distinguish from the western white pine (&quot;Pinus monticola&quot;) in the absence of cones. However, whitebark pine needles are yellow-green and entire (smooth when rubbed gently in either direction), whereas western white pine needles are silvery green and finely serrated (feeling rough when rubbed gently from tip to base). Whitebark pine needles are also usually shorter, long, though still overlapping in size with the larger needles of the western white pine.

==Distribution==
Whitebark pine (&quot;Pinus albicaulis&quot;) can be found at high elevation in the Rocky Mountains from central British Columbia to western Wyoming. It occurs in the timberline zone of the Cascades and coastal ranges from British Columbia to the Sierra Nevada, as well as most high ranges between the Rockies and Cascades, such as the Blue Mountains. It is also populous in subalpine forests of Montana and Idaho.

==Ecology==
The whitebark pine is an important source of food for many granivorous birds and small mammals, including most importantly the Clark&#x27;s nutcracker (&quot;Nucifraga columbiana&quot;), the major seed disperser of the pine. Clark&#x27;s nutcrackers each cache about 30,000 to 100,000 seeds each year in small, widely scattered caches, usually under of soil or gravelly substrate. Nutcrackers retrieve these seed caches during times of food scarcity and to feed their young. Cache sites selected by nutcrackers are often favorable for germination of seeds and survival of seedlings. Those caches not retrieved by the time the snow melts contribute to forest regeneration. Consequently, whitebark pine often grows in clumps of several trees, originating from a single cache of two to 15 or more seeds.

Other animals also depend upon the whitebark pine. Douglas squirrels cut down and store whitebark pine cones in their middens. Grizzly bears and American black bears often raid squirrel middens for whitebark pine seeds, an important pre-hibernation food. Squirrels, northern flickers, and mountain bluebirds often nest in whitebark pines, and elk and blue grouse use whitebark pine communities as summer habitat.

Fallen needles under these trees serve as beds that are used by deer and wild sheep seeking shelter during stormy weather.

=== Threats ===
The whitebark pine has been classified as endangered by the IUCN. Severe population decline in whitebark pine communities is attributed to various causes, most significantly infection with white pine blister rust, recent outbreaks of mountain pine beetles (2000–2014), disturbances in wildland fire ecology (including fire suppression), forest succession, and climate change. A study in the mid-2000s showed that whitebark pine had declined by 41 percent in the western Cascades due to two primary threats: blister rust and pine beetles. Whitebark deaths in North Cascades National Park doubled from 2006 to 2011.

==== White pine blister rust ====

Many stands of &quot;Pinus albicaulis&quot; across the species&#x27; entire natural range are infected with white pine blister rust (&quot;Cronartium ribicola&quot;), a fungal disease introduced from Europe. In the northern Rocky Mountains of the United States, whitebark pine mortality in some areas exceeds 90 percent, where the disease infests nearly . &quot;Cronartium ribicola&quot; occurs in whitebark pine to the northern limits of the species in the coastal ranges of British Columbia and the Canadian Rocky Mountains. The blister rust has also devastated the commercially valuable western white pine in these areas and made serious inroads in limber pine (&quot;Pinus flexilis&quot;) populations as well. Nearly 80 percent of whitebark pines in Mount Rainier National Park are infected with blister rust.

There is currently no effective method for controlling the spread and effects of blister rust. However, a small number of trees (fewer than 5%) in most populations harbor genetic resistance to blister rust. Restoration efforts undertaken by the U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, and National Park Service in the northern Rocky Mountains involve harvesting cones from potentially and known resistant whitebark pines, growing seedlings, and outplanting seedlings in suitable sites. In California, where the blister rust is far less severe, whitebark pine is still fairly common in the High Sierras.

==== Mountain pine beetle ====
Unusually large outbreaks of mountain pine beetle (&quot;Dendroctonus ponderosae&quot;), a species of bark beetle native to western North America, have also contributed significantly to the widespread destruction of whitebark pine stands. The beetles both lay their eggs and introduce pathogenic fungi into their host trees, which include many other species of pine, and the combination of larval feeding and fungal colonization is typically sufficient to kill old or unhealthy trees. However, the beetles have recently expanded their attacks to younger, healthier trees as well as older trees, and climate change has been implicated as the primary culprit. Since 2000, the climate at high elevations has warmed enough for the beetles to reproduce within whitebark pine, often completing their life cycle within one year and enabling their populations to grow exponentially. Entire forest vistas, like that at Avalanche Ridge near Yellowstone National Park’s east gate, have become expanses of dead gray whitebarks. Scientists have attributed the recent warming trend to anthropogenic global warming.

In 2007, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimated that beetles had killed whitebark pines across in the West, while in 2009, beetles were estimated to have killed trees on , the most since record-keeping began. The pine beetle upsurge has killed nearly 750,000 whitebark pines in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem alone.

==== Fire suppression ====
Fire suppression has led to slow population declines over the last century by altering the health and composition dynamics of stands without the fire ecology balancing their habitat and suppressing insect-disease threats. In the absence of low-level wildfire cycles, whitebark pines in these stands are replaced by more shade-tolerant, fire-intolerant species such as subalpine fir (&quot;Abies lasiocarpa&quot;) and Engelmann spruce (&quot;Picea engelmannii&quot;). In addition, senescent and blister rust-infected pine trees are not destroyed by natural periodic ground fires, further diminishing the whitebark pine forest&#x27;s vitality and survival.

=== Protective efforts ===
In 2012 the Canadian federal government declared whitebark pine endangered in accordance with the Species at Risk Act. Accordingly, it became the first federally listed endangered tree in western Canada. In 2022 the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service also acted. It listed whitebark pine in the lowest category of vulnerability: &quot;threatened.&quot; Four distinct threats were described, beginning with white pine blister rust as &quot;the primary stressor.&quot; Mountain pine beetle, altered fire regimes, and &quot;the effects of climate change&quot; add to the challenges. This listing marks the first occasion in which a tree regarded as ecologically important over a vast range in the United States is acknowledged as vulnerable to extinction.

In response to the ongoing decline of the tree throughout its range, the Whitebark Pine Ecosystem Foundation was formed. Their mission is to raise awareness and promote conservation by sponsoring restoration projects, publishing a newsletter called &quot;Nutcracker Notes&quot;, and hosting an annual science and management workshop for anyone interested in whitebark pine. This U.S. group collaborates closely with the Whitebark Pine Ecosystem Foundation of Canada.

==Uses==

Many Native Americans, including the Salish peoples, have been known to eat the seeds from the cones of this tree. They were roasted, made into porridge, and mixed with dry berries.
