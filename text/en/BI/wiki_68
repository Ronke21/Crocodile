<text>Marriageable age is the minimum legal age of marriage. Age and other prerequisites to marriage vary between jurisdictions, but in the vast majority of jurisdictions, the marriageable age as a right is set at the age of majority. Nevertheless, most jurisdictions allow marriage at a younger age with parental or judicial approval, especially if the female is pregnant. Among most indigenous cultures, people marry at fifteen, the age of sexual maturity for both the male and the female. In industrialized cultures, the age of marriage is most commonly 18 years old, but there are variations, and the marriageable age should not be confused with the age of majority or the age of consent, though they may be the same.

The 55 parties to the 1962 Convention on Consent to Marriage, Minimum Age for Marriage, and Registration of Marriages have agreed to specify a minimum marriageable age by statute law‚ to override customary, religious, tribal laws and traditions. When the marriageable age under a law of a religious community is lower than that under the law of the land, the state law prevails. However, some religious communities do not accept the supremacy of state law in this respect, which may lead to child marriage or forced marriage.

The 123 parties to the 1956 Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery have agreed to adopt a prescribed &quot;suitable&quot; minimum age for marriage. In many developing countries, the official age prescriptions stand as mere guidelines. UNICEF, the United Nations children&#x27;s organization, regards a marriage of a minor (legal child), a person below the adult age, as child marriage and a violation of rights.

Until recently, the minimum marriageable age for females was lower in many jurisdictions than for males, on the premise that females mature at an earlier age than males. This law has been viewed by some to be discriminatory, so that in many countries the marriageable age of females has been raised to equal that of males.

==History and social attitudes==

===Classical antiquity===
====Greece====
In Greece females married as young as 14 or 16. In Spartan marriages, females were around 18 and males were around 25.

====Rome====
In the Roman Empire, the Emperor Augustus introduced marriage legislation, the &quot;Lex Papia Poppaea&quot;, which rewarded marriage and childbearing. The legislation also imposed penalties for both men and women who remained unmarried, or who married but for whatever reason failed to have children. For men it is between the ages of 25 and 60 while for women it is between ages 20 and 50. Women who were Vestal Virgins were selected between the ages of 10 and 13 to serve as priestesses in the temple of goddess Vesta in the Roman Forum for 30 years, after which they could marry.

In Roman law the age of marriage was 12 years for females and 14 years for males, and age of betrothal was 7 years for both males and females. The father had the right and duty to seek a good and useful match for his children. To further the interests of their birth families, daughters of the elite would marry into respectable families. If a daughter could prove the proposed husband to be of bad character, she could legitimately refuse the match. Individuals remained under the authority of the pater familias until his death, and the latter had the power to approve or reject marriages for his sons and daughters, but by the late antique period, Roman law permitted women over 25 to marry without parental consent.

Noblewomen were known to marry as young as 12 years of age, whereas women in the lower social classes were more likely to marry slightly further into their teenage years. 43% of Pagan females married at 12–15 years and 42% of Christian females married at 15–18 years.

In late antiquity, most Roman women married in their late teens to early twenties, but noble women married younger than those of the lower classes, as an aristocratic girl was expected to be virgin until her first marriage. In late antiquity, under Roman law, daughters inherited equally from their parents if no will was produced. In addition, Roman law recognized wives&#x27; property as legally separate from husbands&#x27; property, as did some legal systems in parts of Europe and colonial Latin America.

In 380 C.E., the Emperor Theodosius issued the Edict of Thessalonica, which made Nicene Christianity the official religion of the Roman Empire. The Holy See adapted Roman law into Canon law.

===Medieval Europe===
After the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the rise of the Holy Roman Empire, manorialism also helped weaken the ties of kinship and thus the power of clans. As early as the 9th century in northwestern France, families that worked on manors were small, consisting of parents and children and occasionally a grandparent. The Roman Catholic Church and State had become allies in erasing the solidarity and thus the political power of the clans; the Roman Catholic Church sought to replace traditional religion, whose vehicle was the kin group, and substitute the authority of the elders of the kin group with that of a religious elder. At the same time, the king&#x27;s rule was undermined by revolts by the most powerful kin groups, clans or sections, whose conspiracies and murders threatened the power of the state and also the demands by manorial Lords for obedient, compliant workers.

As the peasants and serfs lived and worked on farms that they rented from the lord of the manor, they also needed the permission of the lord to marry. Couples therefore had to comply with the lord of the manor and wait until a small farm became available before they could marry and thus produce children. Those who could and did not delay marriage were presumably rewarded by the landlord and those who did not marry were presumably denied that reward. For example, marriageable ages in Medieval England varied depending on economic circumstances, with couples delaying marriage until their early twenties when times were bad, but might marry in their late teens after the Black Death, when there was a severe labour shortage; by appearances, marriage of adolescents was not the norm in England.

In medieval Western Europe, the rise of Catholicism and manorialism had both created incentives to keep families nuclear, and thus the age of marriage increased; the Western Church instituted marriage laws and practices that undermined large kinship groups. The Roman Catholic Church prohibited consanguineous marriages, a marriage pattern that had been a means to maintain clans (and thus their power) throughout history. The Roman Catholic Church curtailed arranged marriages in which the bride did not clearly agree to the union.

In the 12th century, the Roman Catholic Church drastically changed legal standards for marital consent by allowing daughters over 12 years old and sons over 14 years old to marry without their parents&#x27; approval, which was previously required, even if their marriage was made clandestinely. Parish studies have confirmed that in the late medieval period, females did sometimes marry without their parents&#x27; approval in England.

In the 12th century, Canon law jurist Gratian, stated that consent for marriage could not take place before the age of 12 years old for females and 14 years old for males; also, consent for betrothal could not take place before the age of 7 years old for females and males, as that is the age of reason. The Church of England, after breaking away from the Roman Catholic Church, carried with it the same minimum age requirements. Age of consent for marriage of 12 years old for girls and of 14 years old for boys were written into English civil law.

The first recorded age-of-consent law, in England, dates back 800 years. The age of consent law in question has to do with the law of rape and not the law of marriage as sometimes misunderstood. In 1275, in England, as part of the rape law, the Statute of Westminster 1275, made it a misdemeanor to have sex with a &quot;maiden within age&quot;, whether with or without her consent. The phrase &quot;within age&quot; was interpreted by jurist Sir Edward Coke as meaning the age of marriage, which at the time was 12 years old. A 1576 law was created with more severe punishments for having sex with a girl for which the age of consent was set at 10 years old. Under English common law the age of consent, as part of the law of rape, was 10 or 12 years old and rape was defined as forceful sexual intercourse with a woman against her will. To convict a man of rape, both force and lack of consent had to be proved, except in the case of a girl who is under the age of consent. Since the age of consent applied in all circumstances, not just in physical assaults, the law also made it impossible for an underage girl (under 12 years old) to consent to sexual activity. There was one exception: a man&#x27;s acts with his wife (females over 12 years old), to which rape law did not apply. Jurist Sir Matthew Hale stated that both rape laws were valid at the same time. In 1875, the Offence Against the Persons Act raised the age to 13 years in England; an act of sexual intercourse with a girl younger than 13 was a felony.

There were some fathers who arranged marriages for a son or a daughter before he or she reached the age of maturity, which is &quot;similar&quot; to what some fathers in ancient Rome did. Consummation would not take place until the age of maturity. Roman Catholic Canon law defines a marriage as consummated when the &quot;spouses have performed between themselves in a human fashion a conjugal act which is suitable in itself for the procreation of offspring, to which marriage is ordered by its nature and by which the spouses become one flesh.&quot; There are recorded marriages of two- and three-year-olds: in 1564, a three-year-old named John was married to a two-year-old named Jane in the Bishop&#x27;s Court in Chester, England.

===Modern history===
The policy of the Roman Catholic Church, and later various protestant churches, of considering clandestine marriages and marriages made without parental consent to be valid was controversial, and in the 16th century both the French monarchy and the Lutheran Church sought to end these practices, with limited success.

In most of Northwestern Europe, marriages at very early ages were rare. One thousand marriage certificates from 1619 to 1660 in the Archdiocese of Canterbury show that only one bride was 13 years old, four were 15, twelve were 16, and seventeen were 17 years old; while the other 966 brides were at least 19 years old.

In England and Wales, the Marriage Act 1753 required a marriage to be covered by a licence (requiring parental consent for those under 21) or the publication of bans (which parents of those under 21 could forbid). Additionally, the Church of England dictated that both the bride and groom must be at least 21 years of age to marry without the consent of their families. In the certificates, the most common age for the brides is 22 years. For the grooms 24 years was the most common age, with average ages of 24 years for the brides and 27 for the grooms. While European noblewomen often married early, they were a small minority of the population, and the marriage certificates from Canterbury show that even among nobility it was very rare to marry women off at very early ages.

The minimum age requirements of 12 and 14 were eventually written into English civil law. By default, these provisions became the minimum marriageable ages in colonial America. On the average, marriages occurred several years earlier in colonial America than in Europe, and much higher proportions of the population eventually got married. Community-based studies suggest an average age at marriage of about 20 years old for women in the early colonial period and about 26 years old for men. In the late 19th century and throughout the 20th century, U.S. states began to slowly raise the minimum legal age at which individuals were allowed to marry. Age restrictions, as in most developed countries, have been revised upward so that they are now between 15 and 21 years of age.

Before 1929, the Scottish law adopted the Roman law in allowing a girl to marry at twelve years of age and a boy at fourteen, without any requirement for parental consent. However, in practice, marriages in Scotland at such young ages was almost unknown.

====France====
In France, until the French Revolution, the marriageable age was 12 years for females and 14 for males. Revolutionary legislation in 1792 increased the age to 13 years for females and 15 for males. Under the Napoleonic Code in 1804, the marriageable age was set at 15 years old for females and 18 years old for males. In 2006, the marriageable age for females was increased to 18, the same as for males. In jurisdictions where the ages are not the same, the marriageable age for females is more commonly two or three years lower than that of males.

===Central Europe===
In 17th century Poland, in the Warsaw parish of St John, the average age of women entering marriage was 20.1, and that of men was 23.7. In the second half of the eighteenth century, women in the parish of Holy Cross married at 21.8, while men at 29.

===Eastern Europe===
In medieval Eastern Europe, the Slavic traditions of patrilocality of early and universal marriage (usually of a bride aged 13–15 years, with menarche occurring on average at age 14) lingered; the manorial system had yet to penetrate into Eastern Europe and generally had less effect on clan systems there. The bans on cross-cousin marriages had also not been firmly enforced.

In Russia, before 1830 the age of consent for marriage was 15 years old for males and 13 years old for females (though 15 years old was preferred for females, so much so that it was written into the Law Code of 1649). Teenage marriage was practised for chastity. Both the female and the male teenager needed consent of their parents to marry because they were under 20 years old, the age of majority. In 1830, the age of consent for marriage was raised to 18 years old for males and 16 years old for females Though 18 years old was preferred for females, the average age of marriage for females was around 19 years old.

===Mesoamerica===

====Aztec society====
Aztec family law generally followed customary law. Men got married between the ages of 20–22, and women generally got married at 15 to 18 years of age.

====Mayan civilization====
Maya family law appears to have been based on customary law. Maya men and women usually got married at around the age of 20, though women sometimes got married at the age of 16 or 17.

==Marriageable age as a right vs exceptions==
In majority of countries, a right to marry at age 18 is enshrined along with all other rights and responsibilities of adulthood. However, most of these countries allow those younger than that age to marry, usually with parental consent or judicial authorization. These exceptions vary considerably by country. The United Nations Population Fund stated:

In recent years, many countries in the EU have tightened their marriage laws, either banning marriage under 18 completely, or requiring judicial approval for such marriages. Countries which have reformed their marriage laws in recent years include Sweden (2014), Denmark (2017), Germany (2017), Luxembourg (2014), Spain (2015), Netherlands (2015), Finland (2019) and Ireland (2019). Many developing countries have also enacted similar laws in recent years: Honduras (2017), Ecuador (2015), Costa Rica (2017), Panama (2015), Trinidad &amp; Tobago (2017), Malawi (2017).

The minimum age requirements of 12 years old for females and 14 years old for males were written into English civil law. By default, these provisions became the minimum marriageable ages in colonial America. This English common law inherited from the British remained in force in America unless a specific state law was enacted to replace them. In the United States, as in most developed countries, age restrictions have been revised upward so that they are now between 15 and 21 years of age.

In Western countries, marriages of teenagers have become rare in recent years, with their frequency declining during the past few decades. For instance, in Finland, where in the early 21st century underage youth could obtain a special judicial authorization to marry, there were only 30–40 such marriages per year during that period (with most of the spouses being aged 17), while in the early 1990s, more than 100 such marriages were registered each year. Since 1 June 2019 Finland has banned marriages of anyone under 18 with no exemptions.

==Relation to the age of majority==

Marriageable age &quot;as a right&quot; is usually the same with the age of majority which is 18 years old in most countries. However, in some countries, the age of majority is under 18, while in others it is 19, 20 or 21 years. In Canada for example, the age of majority is 19 in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, British Columbia,
Newfoundland and Labrador, Northwest Territories, Yukon and Nunavut. Marriage under 19 years in these provinces requires parental or court consent (see Marriage in Canada). In USA for example, the age of majority is 21 in Mississippi and 19 in Nebraska and requires parental consent. In many jurisdictions of North America, married minors become legally emancipated.

==Listed by country==
===Africa===

===Americas===
===Asia===

===Europe===
The marriageable age &quot;as a right&quot; is 18 years in all European countries, with the exception of Andorra and Scotland where it is 16 (regardless of gender). Existing &quot;exceptions&quot; to this general rule (usually requiring special judicial or parental consent) are discussed below. In both the European Union and the Council of Europe the marriage act states: The Istanbul convention, the first legally binding instrument in Europe in the field of violence against women and domestic violence, only requires countries which ratify it to prohibit forced marriage (Article 37) and to ensure that forced marriages can be easily voided without further victimization (Article 32), but does not make any reference to a minimum age of marriage.

==By religion==

===Judaism===

====Classical Antiquity====
In ancient Israel men twenty years old and older would become warriors and when they get married they would get one year leave of absence to be with their wife.

Rabbis estimated the age of maturity from about the beginning of the thirteenth year for women and about the beginning of the fourteenth year for men.

On the practice of Levirate marriage, the Talmud advised against a large age gap between a man and his brother&#x27;s widow. A younger woman marrying a significantly older man, however, is especially problematic: marrying one&#x27;s young daughter to an old man was declared by the Sanhedrin as reprehensible as forcing her into prostitution.

====Post-Classical period====

In Rabbinic Judaism, males cannot consent to marriage until they reach the age of 13 years and a day and have undergone puberty and females cannot consent to marriage until they reach the age of 12 years and a day and have undergone puberty. Males and females are considered minors until the age of twenty. After twenty, males are not considered adults if they show signs of impotence. If males show no signs of puberty or do show impotence, they automatically become adults by age 35 and can marry. Marriage involved a double ceremony, which included the formal betrothal and wedding rites.

The minimum age for marriage was 13 years old for males and 12 years old for females but formal betrothal could take place before that and often did. Talmud advises males to get married at 18 years old or between 16 years old and 24 years old.

A &quot;ketannah&quot; (literally meaning &quot;little [one]&quot;) was any girl between the age of 3 years and that of 12 years plus one day; she was subject to her father&#x27;s authority, and he could arrange a marriage for her without her agreement, and that marriage remains binding even after reaching the age of maturity. If a girl was orphaned from her father, or she was married by his authority and subsequently divorced, she, her mother, or her brother could marry her in a quasi-binding fashion. Until the age of maturity, she could annul the marriage retroactively. After reaching the age of maturity, intercourse with her husband renders her officially married.

====Modern period====
Jewish people follow the law of the land that they live in. In modern Israel, the general age for marriage is 18 years old for males and females but with judicial consent 16 year old males and females can marry.

===Christianity===
Catholic canon law adopted Roman law, which set the minimum age of marriage at 12 years old for females and 14 years old for males. The Roman Catholic Church raised the minimum age of marriage to 14 years old for females and to 16 years old for males in 1917 and lowered the age of majority to 18 years old in 1983. The Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches states the same requirements in canon 800.

====Higher ages set by Conferences of Bishops====
=== Islam ===

==== Golden age ====
Hanafi school of classical Islamic jurisprudence interpret the &quot;age of marriage&quot;, in the Quran (24:59;65:4), as the beginning of puberty; that is 10–11 years old.

Marriages were traditionally contracted by the father or guardian of the bride and her intended husband.

Shafiʽi, Hanbali, Ja&#x27;fari and Maliki schools of classical Islamic jurisprudence interpret the &quot;age of marriage&quot;, in the Quran (24:59), as completion of puberty; that is 14/15–17 years. For Shafiʽi, Hanbali, and Maliki schools of Islamic jurisprudence, in Sunni Islam, the condition for marriage is physical (bulugh) maturity and mental (rushd) maturity.

Büchler and Schlater state that &quot;marriageable age according to classical Islamic law coincides with the occurrence of puberty. The notion of puberty refers to signs of physical maturity such as the emission of semen or the onset of menstruation&quot;.

In his Shafiʽi jurisprudential compilation, &quot;The Stocks of the Sojourner&quot;, Ahmad Ibn Naqib Al-Misri (died 1368 A.D.) writes:
====Modern period====
Marriages are traditionally contracted by the father or guardian of the bride and her intended husband.

The 1917 codification of Islamic family law in the Ottoman empire distinguished between the age of competence for marriage, which was set at 18 years for boys and 17 years for girls, and the minimum age for marriage, which followed the traditional Hanafi minimum ages of 12 for boys and 9 for girls. Marriage below the age of competence was permissible only if proof of sexual maturity was accepted in court, while marriage under the minimum age was forbidden.

During the 20th century, most countries in the Middle East followed the Ottoman precedent in defining the age of competence, while raising the minimum age to 15 or 16 for boys and 15–16 for girls. Marriage below the age of competence is subject to approval by a judge and the legal guardian of the child. Egypt diverged from this pattern by setting the age limits of 18 years for boys and 16 years for girls, without a distinction between competence for marriage and minimum age.

Many senior clerics in Saudi Arabia have opposed setting a minimum age for marriage, arguing that a girl reaches adulthood at puberty.

However in 2019, members of the Saudi Shoura Council in 2019 approved fresh regulations for child marriage that will see to outlaw marrying off 15-year-old children and force the need for court approval for those under 18 years. The Chairman of the Human Rights Committee at the Shoura Council, Dr. Hadi Al-Yami, said that introduced controls were based on in-depth studies presented to the body. He pointed out that the regulation, vetted by the Islamic Affairs Committee at the Shoura Council, has raised the age of marriage to 18 years and prohibited it for those under 15 years.

===Baháʼí Faith===

In the Baháʼí Faith&#x27;s religious book Kitáb-i-Aqdas, the age of marriage is set at 15 years for both boys and girls. It is forbidden to become engaged before the age of 15 years.

===Indian religions===
The Dharmaśāstras state that females can marry only after they have reached puberty. Furthermore, The Legal Age for Marriage in India is being proposed to be amended, thereby increasing the marriageable age for girls in India in 2022 from 18 to 21 years.

<text>Joyce DeWitt (born April 23, 1949) is an American actress best known for playing Janet Wood on the ABC sitcom &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; from 1977 to 1984. Following costar John Ritter&#x27;s death in 2003, DeWitt became the sole surviving cast member to have a starring role in all eight seasons of &quot;Three&#x27;s Company.&quot; As of costar Suzanne Somers&#x27; death in 2023, DeWitt subsequently became the sole surviving cast member in a starring role to be present at the sitcom&#x27;s onset.

==Early life==
Joyce DeWitt was born on April 23, 1949, in Wheeling, West Virginia, and grew up in Speedway, Indiana, a suburb of Indianapolis. She is of Italian descent from her mother. DeWitt began appearing on stage at the age of 13. She competed in speech and debate through the Indiana High School Forensic Association. She graduated from Speedway Senior High School, and once worked at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway ticket office.

She earned her bachelor&#x27;s degree in theater from Ball State University. Subsequently, while she was performing in summer stock, the director convinced her to enroll in UCLA&#x27;s Department of Theater MFA program, where she was awarded the Master of Fine Arts Fellowship as well as the Clifton Webb Scholarship. She graduated in 1974.

==Career==

While attending UCLA, she worked as a secretary until her television debut on an episode of &quot;Baretta&quot;. Contrary to rumors that she was mentored by actor Abe Vigoda, Dewitt has said that the two never met.

DeWitt is best known for her role as Janet Wood during the 1977–1984 run of the sitcom &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;, a job she obtained after being cast in the show&#x27;s second pilot. She also played Janet in a 1979 episode of the spinoff series &quot;The Ropers&quot;.

After &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; ended in 1984, DeWitt appeared in an episode of &quot;Finder of Lost Loves&quot; in 1984, after which she quit acting for several years. She resumed acting with a part in a production of &quot;Noises Off&quot; at Michigan&#x27;s Cherry County Playhouse in June 1991. She later appeared in the 1995 TV comedy film &quot;Spring Fling!&quot; A character based on her, voiced by another actress, appeared in a 1997 episode of &quot;Pinky and the Brain&quot;. She made an appearance in an episode of &quot;Cybill&quot;, and had a cameo on the penultimate episode of &quot;Living Single&quot;. Her 2000s works includes TV shows such as &quot;Hope Island&quot;, &quot;The Nick at Nite Holiday Special&quot; and &quot;Call of the Wild&quot;.

DeWitt co-produced and hosted the 2003 NBC-TV television film &quot;Behind the Camera: The Unauthorized Story of Three&#x27;s Company&quot;. In the film, DeWitt is portrayed by Melanie Paxson.

In 2008, she appeared in the indie film &quot;Failing Better Now&quot;. In 2009, DeWitt starred in a stage production of &quot;Married Alive&quot; in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

In June 2011, DeWitt succeeded Eve Plumb in the title role of the play &quot;Miss Abigail&#x27;s Guide to Dating, Mating &amp; Marriage&quot; at the Downstairs Cabaret Theatre in New York City&#x27;s Times Square. That same year, she appeared in a Canadian stage production of &quot;Dinner with Friends&quot; at Theatre Aquarius in Hamilton, Ontario.

In 2012, DeWitt appeared in two separate stage productions of &quot;Love Letters&quot; starring opposite Tab Hunter and Tony Dow, respectively. In August 2012, she starred with her niece, Katharine DeWitt, in a production of &quot;Remember Me&quot; at the Alhambra Dinner Theatre in Jacksonville, Florida.

Also in 2012, DeWitt appeared on Suzanne Somers&#x27; talk show, &quot;Suzanne Somers: Breaking Through&quot;, during which she and Somers reminisced about their time on &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; together. Somers apologized for the conflict that arose between them, and they exchanged anecdotes about the last time they each spoke to their late co-star John Ritter. DeWitt&#x27;s appearance on Somers&#x27; program marked the first time the two actresses had seen or spoken to each other since having a major falling out 31 years earlier, involving a salary dispute.

In 2018, DeWitt played Mother Superior in a stage production of &quot;Nunsense&quot; at the Hunterdon Hills Playhouse in New Jersey.

==Charity work==
DeWitt participated with members of the House and Senate at the Capitol Hill Forum on Hunger and Homelessness, and has hosted presentations for the Family Assistance Program of Hollywood. She hosted the International Awards Ceremony at the White House for the Presidential End Hunger Awards, and co-hosted, with Jeff Bridges, the World Food Day Gala at the Kennedy Center.

==Personal life==
DeWitt was in a romantic relationship with actor and director Ray Buktenica from 1973 to 1980.

On July 4, 2009, DeWitt was arrested in El Segundo, California, and cited for drunken driving. She was booked at the police station, cited, and released on her own recognizance. On May 27, 2010, she pleaded no contest to one count misdemeanor and was placed on three years&#x27; probation and ordered to undergo a nine-month alcohol program. She was also ordered to pay a $510 fine, plus penalty assessments. In exchange for her plea, a second misdemeanor count was dismissed.

<text>In computing, Resource Directory Description Language (RDDL) is an extension of XHTML Basic 1.0. An RDDL document, called a Resource Directory, provides a package of information about some target. The targets which RDDL was designed to describe are XML namespaces. The specification for RDDL has no official standing and has not been considered nor approved by any organization (e.g., W3C).

RDDL is designed to allow both human readers and software robots to find any sort of resource associated with a particular namespace. Instead of putting one thing at the end of a namespace URI, RDDL puts a document there that lists all the machine-processable documents that might be available, including:

* Document Type Definitions (DTD)
* XML schemas in a variety of languages (including RELAX, Schematron, W3C XML Schema, TREX, and others)
* Cascading Style Sheets, XSLT, and other style sheet specifications
* Specification documents

== rddl:resource ==
An RDDL document identifies each related resource by a resource element in the http://www.rddl.org/ namespace, which is customarily mapped to the rddl prefix. This element is a simple XLink (that is, it has an codice_1 attribute with the value simple) and its codice_2 attribute points to the related resource. Furthermore, the codice_3 attribute identifies the nature of the related resource and the optional codice_4 attribute identifies the purpose of the related resource. An optional codice_5 attribute can provide a brief description of the purpose of the link.

<text>A market basket or commodity bundle is a fixed list of items, in given proportions. Its most common use is to track the progress of inflation in an economy or specific market. That is, to measure the changes in the value of money over time. A market basket is also used with the theory of purchasing price parity to measure the value of money in different places.

The most common type of market basket is the basket of consumer goods used to define the Consumer Price Index (CPI), often called the consumer basket. It is a sample of goods and services, offered at the consumer market.

In the United States, the sample is determined by Consumer Expenditure Surveys conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The price collection is conducted by data collectors on a monthly basis, and is processed further by commodity specialists.

==Food basket==
Food basket can refer to any market basket of food products, but is often used when the products are expected to meet basic nutritional needs. The term &quot;basic food basket&quot; is also used for the latter.

==Other baskets==
Other types of baskets are used to define the Producer Price Index (PPI), previously known as the Wholesale Price Index (WPI), as well as various commodity price indices.

The GDP deflator essentially uses a basket made of every good in the economy, in proportion to the amount produced.

==Issues==

When measuring inflation or PPP, there are difficulties in selecting the goods that are common at both places in time (for inflation) or space (for PPP).

When measuring inflation, we must find goods that exist at different points in time and, ideally, have similar utility to consumers at those times. This is difficult. 
For example, cars might be common purchases today, but they didn&#x27;t exist in 1900, when horses were used for transportation. So, even though transportation is important, putting a car in the basket is problematic. This problem exists over short timespans, because the concept of &quot;car&quot; changes with time. The cars of today last longer and go faster than the cars of only a few years ago. Researchers measuring inflation usually include &quot;transportation&quot; in their basket, because it is an important consumer purchase, but they must account for these differences in the transportation by other means.

When measuring PPP, there are similar issues. In different parts of the world, different goods might play similar roles in the economy. So, a researcher measuring PPP might need to account for rice&#x27;s popularity in China and corn (maize)&#x27;s popularity in the USA. Also, fashion and culture may dictate that certain goods may have drastically different utilities in different places. For example, beef is not valued in Hindu areas and pork is not valued in Muslim areas.

Some approaches account for these differences by having two baskets and averaging the inflation or PPP of them. For example, a basket of goods consumers bought in 1900 and a separate basket of goods consumers buy today. After computing the price of each basket in 1900 and today, the inflation over the time period is an average of the increase in the two baskets. A common usage of this two-basket-averaging is the GDP deflator, where the basket contains every good produced in the economy at a given point in time.

<text>Yerkish is an artificial language developed for use by non-human primates. It employs a keyboard whose keys contain &quot;lexigrams&quot;, symbols corresponding to objects or ideas.

Lexigrams were notably used by the Georgia State University Language Research Center to communicate with bonobos and chimpanzees. Researchers and primates were able to communicate using lexigram boards made in up to three panels with a total of 384 keys.

== Context ==
The Yerkish language was developed by Ernst von Glasersfeld and used by Duane Rumbaugh and Sue Savage-Rumbaugh of Georgia State University while working with primates at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center of Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. Primates were taught to communicate by means of a lexigram board, a computerized array of keys labeled with lexigrams. Von Glasersfeld coined the term &quot;lexigram&quot; in 1971, created the first 120 of them, and designed the grammar that regulated their combination. This artificial language was called Yerkish in honor of Robert M. Yerkes, the founder of the laboratory within which the lexigrams were first used.

The first ape trained to communicate in Yerkish was the chimpanzee Lana, beginning in 1973 within the context of the LANA project. Researchers were hoping Lana would not only interpret the Yerkish language, but would also participate in communication with others through this newfound language.

== Design considerations ==
=== Lexigram concept ===

Research leading to 1973 suggested chimpanzees could acquire and retain symbolic use of visual items. In an attempt to structure the use of symbols as language, Yerkish formalized the use of the &quot;lexigram&quot;, a graphic design which represents a word but is not necessarily indicative of the object to which it refers.

Each lexigram is designed to be semantically and syntactically &quot;unequivocal&quot;, a conscious effort to reduce the ambiguity of English. For example, the use of color conveys semantic code, with red lexigrams identifying ingestible items like food and drink, blue lexigrams designating activities, and violet lexigrams representing animate beings like humans.

Existing technical limitations guided lexigrams to be constructed by 9 single elements which could be combined by being superimposed. The lexigram for &quot;juice&quot;, which is red in color, is a combination of elements 1 (a vertical line), 5 (a circle), and 9 (a wavy line).

Von Glaserfeld created approximately 150 of the first lexigrams in the Yerkish language.

== Interface ==
=== Keyboard ===
A lexigram keyboard was created for Lana with each key representing various nouns or verbs such as food, eat, apple, drink, etc.

Von Glaserfeld used 25 of them in his initial experiment with Lana. Each of these keys was 1 x 1 inch and lit up when pressed.

After pressing a certain key, the corresponding item would emerge from a food dispenser placed next to the keyboard, and through a series of experiments, researchers hoped that Lana would learn to interpret what each key would correlate to and learn to meaningfully communicate her requests.

<text>An ogive ( ) is the roundly tapered end of a two- or three-dimensional object. Ogive curves and surfaces are used in engineering, architecture, woodworking, and ballistics.

==Etymology==
The French Orientalist Georges Séraphin Colin gives as the term&#x27;s origin the Arabic &quot;al-ġubb&quot; () &#x27;cistern&#x27;, pronounced &quot;al-ġibb&quot; () in vernacular Iberian Arabic, through the Spanish &quot;aljibe&quot; or archaically &quot;algibe.&quot;

The earliest use of the word &quot;ogive&quot; is found in the 13th-century sketchbook of Villard de Honnecourt, from Picardy in northern France. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; considers the French term&#x27;s origin obscure; it might come from the Late Latin , the feminine perfect passive participle of , meaning the one who has met or encountered the other. However, Merriam-Webster&#x27;s dictionary says it is from the &quot;Middle English stone comprising an arch, from Middle French diagonal arch&quot;. According to Wiktionary, the French term comes &quot;from Vulgar Latin augīvus, from Latin augēre, as the ogive goes on increasing, and the arch it forms increases the strength of the vault. In Old French we find the phrase arc ogif, itself from Latin arcus augivus. The word was also written as augive in the 17th century.&quot;

==Types and use in applied physical science and engineering==

In ballistics or aerodynamics, an ogive is a pointed, curved surface mainly used to form the approximately streamlined nose of a bullet or other projectile, reducing air resistance or the drag of air. The French word &quot;ogive&quot; can be translated as &quot;nose cone&quot; or &quot;warhead&quot;. 

The traditional or secant ogive is a surface of revolution of the same curve that forms a Gothic arch; that is, a circular arc, of greater radius than the diameter of the cylindrical section (&quot;shank&quot;), is drawn from the edge of the shank until it intercepts the axis.

If this arc is drawn so that it meets the shank at zero angle (that is, the distance of the centre of the arc from the axis, plus the radius of the shank, equals the radius of the arc), then it is called a tangent or spitzer ogive. This is a very common ogive for high velocity (supersonic) rifle bullets.

The sharpness of this ogive is expressed by the ratio of its radius to the diameter of the cylinder; a value of one half being a hemispherical dome, and larger values being progressively more pointed. Values of 4 to 10 are commonly used in rifle bullets, with 6 being the most common.

Another common ogive for bullets is the elliptical ogive. This is a curve very similar to the spitzer ogive, except that the circular arc is replaced by an ellipse defined in such a way that it meets the axis at exactly 90°. This gives a somewhat rounded nose regardless of the sharpness ratio. An elliptical ogive is normally described in terms of the ratio of the length of the ogive to the diameter of the shank. A ratio of one half would be, once again, a hemisphere. Values close to 1 are common in practice. Elliptical ogives are mainly used in pistol bullets.

More complex ogives can be derived from minimum turbulence calculations rather than geometric forms, such as the von Kármán ogive used for supersonic missiles, aircraft and ordnance.

==Architecture==
One of the defining characteristics of Gothic architecture is the pointed arch. 

=== History ===
Pointed arches may have originated as in the Sitamarhi caves in the 3rd century BCE. The free-standing temple of Trivikrama at Ter in Maharashtra (India) (dated to the Satavahana period of the 2nd century BCE to the 3rd century CE) also contains an ogive arch but it is constructed using corbel principles.

Excavations conducted by Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) at Kausambi revealed a palace with foundations from the 8th century BCE until the 2nd century CE, built in six phases. The last phase, dated to 1st–2nd century CE, includes an extensive structure which features four centered pointed arches which were used to span narrow passageways and segmental arches for wider areas. Pointed arches with load-bearing functions were also employed in Gandhara. A two pointed-arch vault-system was built inside the Bhitargaon temple (as noted by Alexander Cunningham) which is dated to the early Gupta period of the 4th–5th centuries CE. Pointed arches also appeared in Mahabodhi temple with relieving arches and vaults between the 6th and 7th centuries CE.

The 5th- or 6th-century CE Romano-Byzantine Karamagara Bridge in Cappadocia (in present-day Turkish Central Anatolia) features an early pointed arch as part of an apparent Romano-Greco-Syrian architectural tradition.

Several scholars see the pointed arch as first established as an architectonic principle in the Middle East in Islamic architecture during the Abbasid Caliphate in the middle of the 8th century CE. Pointed arches appeared in Christian Europe by the 11th century CE.

=== Debate ===
Some scholars have refused to accept an Indian origin of the pointed arch, including Hill (1993); some scholars have argued that pointed arches were used in the Near East in pre-Islamic architecture, but others have stated that these arches were, in fact, parabolic and not pointed arches.

=== Usage ===
Gothic architecture features ogives as the intersecting transverse ribs of arches which establish the surface of a Gothic vault. An ogive or ogival arch is a pointed, &quot;Gothic&quot; arch, drawn with compasses as outlined above, or with arcs of an ellipse as described. A very narrow, steeply pointed ogive arch is sometimes called a &quot;lancet arch&quot;. The most common form is an equilateral arch, where the radius is the same as the width. In the later Flamboyant Gothic style, an &quot;ogee arch&quot;, an arch with a pointed head, like S-shaped curves, became prevalent.

==Glaciology==
In glaciology, the term ogives refers to alternating bands of light and dark coloured ice that occur as a result of glaciers moving through an icefall.

<doc id="350880" wikidata="Q845441" url="?curid=350880" title="Sassarese language">
<text>Sassarese (natively or ; ) is an Italo-Dalmatian language and transitional variety between Sardinian and Corsican. It is regarded as a Corso–Sardinian language because of Sassari&#x27;s historic ties with Tuscany and geographical proximity to Corsica. Despite the robust Sardinian influences (in terms of vocabulary and phonology, as well as syntax), it still keeps its Corsican (and therefore Tuscan) roots, which closely relate it to Gallurese; the latter is linguistically considered a Corsican dialect despite its geographical location, although this claim is a matter of controversy. It has several similarities to the Italian language, and in particular to the old Italian dialects from Tuscany.

Sassarese is spoken by approximately 100,000 people, out of a total population of 175,000, in the northwest coastal areas of Sardinia, Italy. Large Sassarese-speaking communities are present in Sassari, Stintino, Sorso, and Porto Torres. The Sassarese varieties transitioning to Gallurese, known as the &quot;Castellanesi&quot; dialects, can be heard in Castelsardo, Tergu, and Sedini.

Sassarese emerged as an urban &quot;lingua franca&quot; in the late part of the age of the Judicates (13th–14th century), based on a mixture of different languages – namely Sardinian, Corsican/Tuscan, and Ligurian. The neighbouring Logudorese dialects of Sardinian exercised a significant influence on the modern linguistic development, along with some Catalan and Spanish vocabulary. There exist many modern and older works both on and in Sassarese, and a number of cultural, social, and theatre events are held regularly in connection with it.

In 1943 the German linguist Max Leopold Wagner wrote:
== Official status ==
Sassarese is recognized as an official language by the regional government of Sardinia:

<doc id="350885" wikidata="Q35348" url="?curid=350885" title="Campidanese Sardinian">
<text>Campidanese Sardinian (, ) also known as Southern Sardinian () is one of the two written standards of the Sardinian language, which is often considered one of the most, if not the most conservative of all the Romance languages. The orthography is based on the spoken dialects of central southern Sardinia, identified by certain attributes which are not found, or found to a lesser degree, among the Sardinian dialects centered on the other written form, Logudorese. Its ISO 639-3 code is &quot;sro&quot;.

Traditionally the name ( in Italian) refers to the fertile area located around the towns of Guspini and Villacidro. Campidanese dialects can be found across the entire Province of Cagliari and not just the Province of Medio Campidano area. Campidanese also extends into parts of the Province of Nuoro, notably the Ogliastra area and in the southern half of the Province of Oristano, the capital included. However, it is at this point that the dialects merge into Logudorese.

==Subvariants==
There are seven main subdialects of Campidanese Sardinian, namely Western Campidanese, Sarrabese (), Southern Barbagian, and Oristano&#x27;s ( or also ), Ogliastra&#x27;s (), Cagliari&#x27;s (), and the varieties of Sulcis (). is the dialect spoken in the island&#x27;s capital; however, it extends to most of the neighbouring towns and villages within a 15 km radius of Cagliari. In 2009, the provincial administration of Cagliari approved the spelling, phonetics, morphology, and vocabulary rules for Standard Campidanese Sardinian.

==Vocabulary==
Campidanese Sardinian has some borrowed words from Aragonese, Catalan and Spanish. Since the early 20th century, there has been an increase in lexical borrowing from Italian as well; that is particularly evident with technological words for which there is no Campidanese equivalent. However, many words that are from Italian have been changed phonetically so that they sound Sardinian. Italian loan words that end in an &quot;o&quot; are often substituted with a &quot;u&quot;. The strong Campidanese accent also changes the sound of the word.

==Characteristics==
#Singular nouns descending from 3rd declension Latin nouns ending in &quot;-i&quot; (Campidanese &quot;pisci&quot; vs Logudorese )
#Plural definite article of &quot;is&quot; (Campidanese &quot;is terras&quot; vs Logudorese &quot;sas terras&quot;)
#Gerund in &quot;-endi&quot; (Campidanese &quot;èssendi&quot; vs Logudorese &quot;èssende&quot;)
#Conservation of the Latin phoneme &lt;qu&gt; and &lt;gu&gt; ( and ) in words such as &quot;akua&quot; (water) and &quot;sànguni&quot; (blood).
#Palatalisation of Latin word-initial before and (Lat. &quot;centum&quot; &gt; &quot;centu&quot; cf. Logudorese &quot;chentu&quot;). This palatalization is independent from the general Italo-Western development. In medial positions, becomes (Lat. &quot;decem&quot; &gt; &quot;dexi&quot; cf. Logudorese &quot;deghe&quot;) or (Lat. &quot;piscem&quot; &gt; &quot;pisci&quot;)
#Transformation of to , to , to , and , into 
#Epenthetic before word-initial (Lat. &quot;rubeum&quot; &gt; &quot;arrubiu&quot;)
#Metathesis (Logudorese &quot;Carbonia&quot; vs Campidanese &quot;Crabonia&quot;)
#Catalan influence (Words such as &quot;seu&quot; &quot;cathedral&quot; loaned from Catalan)

Campidanese Sardinian is intelligible to those from the central to the southern part of Sardinia, where Logudorese Sardinian is spoken, but it is not to those from the extreme north of the island, where Corsican–Sardinian dialects are spoken.

Italian speakers do not understand Campidanese, like any other dialect of the Sardinian language: Sardinian is an autonomous linguistic group rather than an Italian dialect as it is often noted because of its morphological, syntactic, and lexical differences from Italian.

==Writing system==

Campidanese is written using the Latin alphabet. Like Italian, Campidanese does not use or . Campidanese also uses the digraphs , representing , representing before &quot;e&quot; and &quot;i&quot; vowels, representing and , representing .

In phonetic syntax, final or intervocalic is pronounced as a (es: &quot;issu andat&quot;, meaning &quot;he goes&quot;, is pronounced ) and is pronounced as a , (es. &quot;sa mesa&quot;, meaning &quot;the table&quot;, is pronounced &quot;sa mez̪a&quot;). When there are consonants like &quot;s&quot;, &quot;t&quot; or &quot;nt&quot; at the end of the word, a helping vowel is usually added (es. &quot;sa domu&quot;, &quot;is domus(u)&quot;, the house, the houses).
If preceded by a consonant, an &quot;i&quot; is inserted before the normally-initial &quot;s&quot; (es: &quot;sa scala&quot;, &quot;is (i)scalas(a)&quot;, the staircase, the staircases). The spelling rules were established by the Province of Cagliari with a deliberation on March 17, 2010.

<text>AeroSvit Airlines private stock company (), operating as AeroSvit — Ukrainian Airlines / АероСвіт, was a Ukrainian private airline. Its head office was on the grounds of the Boryspil International Airport in Boryspil.

Aerosvit Ukrainian Airlines was a member of IATA and an IATA IOSA certified carrier. Its main base was Boryspil Airport. The airline was established in March 1994 and started operations in April of the same year with international flights from Kyiv in co-operation with Air Ukraine. , Aerosvit was the largest carrier in Ukraine. Bankruptcy procedures began in January 2013, and in February 2013, AeroSvit ceased operations.

==History==
===Early years===

The airline was established on 25 March 1994, and started operations in that year with flights from Kyiv to Athens, Larnaca, Tel Aviv, Odesa and Thessaloniki in co-operation with Air Ukraine. In of the same year, the carrier started dry-leasing some Boeing 737-200s in connection with the addition of Moscow into the route network. In 1995, new scheduled flights from Kyiv to Almaty, Ashgabad, and Riga were launched, laying the foundations for it to become a transit airline. In 1996, Yekaterinburg, Kharkiv, Lviv, and Simferopol were added to the airline&#x27;s network. Also in 1996, the airline became a member of the International Air Transport Association (IATA). By 1997, Aerosvit Airlines had become a member of IATA Clearing House and purchased its first Boeing 737-200 aircraft. By 1999, Aerosvit had acquired a third Boeing 737-200 aircraft and scheduled flights to Budapest, Sofia and Istanbul were launched.

===Post-millennium expansion and reorganisation===
In 2000, two more Boeing 737-300 aircraft joined Aerosvit Airlines&#x27; fleet. Scheduled flights to Prague and Warsaw were launched, and Aerosvit Airlines carried more passengers than any other Ukrainian airline (over the calendar year). In 2002, a further three Boeing 737-500 aircraft joined the fleet, as did the first Boeing 767-300ER — a 350-seater machine that previously belonged to SAS — on a long-term lease from Boeing Capital, aimed at starting operations to Bangkok. The airliner became the first Western-built wide-body to be operated by a Ukrainian carrier. Also in 2002, Aerosvit took over the long-haul services previously operated by Air Ukraine.
The Kyiv–New York–Kyiv route was launched in 2003 with a twice weekly service. Later that year, flights to Toronto and Delhi began. In this year, the airline also carried its second millionth passenger. Soon after, the company received the JAR-145 certification for performing in house maintenance works in accordance with the European Joint Aviation Authorities&#x27; requirements. With the onset of 2004, Aerosvit increased the number of weekly flights it operated to Bangkok to three and an additional Boeing 737-300 was added to the fleet. Route expansion continued as before, and over the course of the year the number of Aerosvit-operated domestic flights across Ukraine expanded to eleven destinations. However, expansion did not just take place on the domestic market, as Aerosvit introduced new routes from its base in Kyiv, to Beijing, Baku, Chisinau, Cairo, and St. Petersburg. Finally, in 2004, Aerosvit Ukrainian Airlines became the official air carrier of the National Olympic team of Ukraine for the XXVIII Olympic Summer Games held in 2004 in Athens.

Aerosvit&#x27;s ninth Boeing 737 mid-haul aircraft started operating in 2005, with a tenth being added to the fleet soon after. In the same year, e-ticketing was launched on the route New York-Kyiv and Aerosvit Ukrainian Airlines and Azerbaijan Airlines started code-sharing on the Kyiv-Baku route.

In 2006, the carrier became the worldwide in passing the IATA Operational Safety Audit. In that year, Naples was added to the route network, and in the Kyiv–Vilnius and Simferopol–Vilnius routes were launched in codeshare agreement with Lithuania&#x27;s national carrier flyLAL. In , Aerosvit was the first airline to operate both inbound and outbound passenger flights at Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport, and in , the airline celebrated the six-millionth passenger carried since it started operations.
In 2007, thanks to cooperation with Delta Air Lines, the number of destinations in the United States increased, allowing onward travel from New York to cities such as Los Angeles and Portland. It was in the same year that Aerosvit Ukrainian Airlines and Donbassaero began to build (at the initiative of their joint main shareholder Privat Group) the strategic alliance Ukrainian Aviation Group. Also, that year, the fleet was supplemented with a third Boeing 767 long-haul aircraft and the eleventh and twelfth mid-range Boeing 737s, whilst the start of code share flights with Belavia on the Kyiv-Minsk route took place. In , it was announced that a contract was signed with Boeing for the acquisition of seven Boeing 737-800s and purchase rights for another seven; in a deal valued at more than  million, the operation marked the company&#x27;s first direct purchase of aircraft since its foundation. These new aircraft would replace the airline&#x27;s 13-strong Boeing 737 Classic fleet; the first of them was handed over by the manufacturer in . In , the airline began the commercialisation of e-tickets on its website.

At the beginning of 2008, flights from Kyiv to Tbilisi and Almaty were launched by Aerosvit, E-ticketing was introduced on all Aerosvit scheduled flights, and Aerosvit Airlines again became the official air carrier of the Ukrainian National Olympic team for the XXIX Olympic Games held in Beijing. In , Aerosvit acquired a 70-seater Antonov An-148, which was deployed on domestic routes in ; the first international revenue flight for the type with the airline took place in that year, covering the Odesa–Moscow route. Also in , the carrier launched scheduled flights to Astana and Riga.

In 2010, Aerosvit added a second Antonov 148 aircraft to its fleet and new routes including Odesa-Kaliningrad, Simferopol-Kaliningrad, Donetsk-Saint Petersburg, Odesa-Riga, and Dnipro-Berlin were opened (largely with the cooperation of its sister companies Dniproavia and Donbassaero). An Odesa-Milan code-share route was launched. Dniproavia, having come into the Privat Group&#x27;s business portfolio, joined the Ukrainian Aviation Group.

During 2010, the airline opened 21 new international routes, including Bucharest and Yerevan, and signed a codeshare agreement with Hainan Airlines that covered operations on the Kyiv–Beijing route. Ho Chi Minh City was added to the route network in , becoming the first direct air link between Ukraine and Vietnam. Aerosvit took delivery of its first Boeing 737-800 in March 2012.

Additionally, Aerosvit signed a contract with Boeing for delivery of 4 Boeing 737-900ER aircraft in 2013-2014, and a fourth Boeing 767 was added to the fleet. In the first quarter of 2012, the airline received the first of its ordered Embraer 190 aircraft, with deliveries continuing into 2013 or 2014.

As of 25 March 2012, as a result of the Anti-monopoly committee of Ukraine&#x27;s decision to allow the consolidation of the Ukrainian Aviation Group&#x27;s physical and operational assets, Donbassaero and Dniproavia no longer operate flights with their own codes, but rather on behalf of their parent company Aerosvit.

By June 2012, the airline introduced their first Embraer 190. All Embraer 190 were ordered and operated by the partner-airline Dniproavia.

===Financial difficulties and downfall===
Boryspil International Airport&#x27;s suspension of Aerosvit flights in , and a clash over a RUB 95 million debt with Sheremetyevo International Airport late that year indicated Aerosvit&#x27;s financial weakness. , debt was  million (around €403 million), thrice the value of company assets (€138.7 million, ). The airline had not reported the 2012 results, but losses mounted to ₴ 1,456 billion in 2011, a threefold increase year-on-year. Aerosvit&#x27;s last profitable year was 2007.

On 29 December 2012, Aerosvit filed for bankruptcy but intended to restructure and continue to operate. Large minority shareholders claimed they were not informed about the filing. Days prior to initiating the legal procedure, Aerosvit disclosed plans to transfer a number of its international routes to Ukraine International Airlines. After the bankruptcy proceedings were announced, the carrier&#x27;s aircraft were detained at various airports, leaving hundreds of passengers stranded. In mid-, Rosaviatsia stated that it would ban the airline over a  million debt; late that month, Russia barred the airline from operating in its territory. , the company stated that all the Boeing 737s were being returned to the lessors, as well as one Boeing 767. It was disclosed in mid- that the company planned to cut about 1,800 jobs by , including all the Boeing 737-related staff that had already been dismissed.

Despite indications in mid- that Aerosvit would continue to fly between Kyiv and Bangkok, Beijing, Dnipro, Ivano-Frankivsk and New York, the suspension of medium- and short-haul routes was announced, with plans to reestablish services to Bangkok, Beijing and New York in ; however, , the airline ceased long-haul services as well. Part of Aerosvit&#x27;s fleet was transferred to Ukraine International Airlines.

<text>Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (ca. 75 BC – 12 April 45 BC) was a Roman politician and general from the late Republic (1st century BC).

==Biography==
Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus was the elder son of Pompey the Great (Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus) by his third wife, Mucia Tertia. Both he and his younger brother Sextus Pompey grew up in the shadow of their father, one of Rome&#x27;s best generals and not originally a conservative politician who drifted to the more traditional faction when Julius Caesar became a threat. When Caesar crossed the Rubicon in 49 BC, thus starting a civil war, Gnaeus followed his father in their escape to the East, as did most of the conservative senators. Pompey&#x27;s army lost the Battle of Pharsalus in 48 BC, and Pompey himself had to run for his life, only to be murdered in Egypt on 29 September the same year.

After the murder, Gnaeus and his brother Sextus joined the resistance against Caesar in the Africa Province. Together with Metellus Scipio, Cato and other senators, they prepared to oppose Caesar and his army to the end. Here however Cato chastised Gnaeus, saying his father had achieved much more at his age than Gnaeus had. This prompted Gnaeus to launch a solo attack on Mauretania however he was defeated at the Battle of Ascurum. Gnaeus fled to the Balearic Islands, where he was joined by Sextus following Caesar&#x27;s defeat of Metellus Scipio and Cato, who subsequently committed suicide, at the Battle of Thapsus in 46 BC. Together with Titus Labienus, former general in Caesar&#x27;s army, the Pompey brothers crossed over to Hispania (the Iberian Peninsula, comprising modern Spain and Portugal), where they raised yet another army.

Caesar soon followed and, on 17 March 45 BC, the armies met in the Battle of Munda. Both armies were large and led by able generals. The battle was closely fought, but eventually a cavalry charge by Caesar turned events to his side. In the battle and the panicked escape that followed, Titus Labienus and an estimated 30,000 men of the Pompeian side died. Gnaeus and Sextus managed to escape another time but supporters were difficult to find. It was by now clear Caesar had won the civil war. Within a few weeks, Gnaeus Pompeius was cornered and killed by Lucius Caesennius Lento.

His younger brother Sextus Pompeius was able to keep one step ahead of his enemies, and survived his brother for another decade by establishing a semi-independent kingdom in Sicily with a powerful naval fleet, becoming so powerful he had to be accommodated by the Second Triumvirate until Augustus sent his general Marcus Agrippa who fought the Bellum Siculum with Sextus who was eventually defeated and executed.

==Marriage==
Gnaeus Pompeius married Claudia Pulcra, daughter of Appius Claudius Pulcher and sister of Marcus Junius Brutus&#x27; first wife, who survived him; they had no children.

<text>The Alliance was a left-wing political party in New Zealand. It was formed at the end of 1991 by the linking of four smaller parties. The Alliance positioned itself as a democratic socialist alternative to the centre-left New Zealand Labour Party. It was influential throughout the 1990s, but suffered a major setback after its founder and leader, Jim Anderton, left the party in 2002, taking with him several of its members of parliament (MPs). After the remaining MPs lost their seats in the 2002 general election, some commentators predicted the demise of the party.

The Alliance stood candidates in the 2005 general election but won less than 1% of the party vote. It contested Auckland City Council elections under the City Vision banner, in concert with the New Zealand Labour Party and Green Party. The Alliance ran 15 electorate candidates and a total of 30 candidates on the party list in the 2008 general election, increasing its party vote marginally from that in 2005. It was deregistered (can no longer contest for the party vote) at its own request on 26 May 2015.

==Policies==
A democratic socialist party, the Alliance supported free education, free healthcare, full employment and the maintenance of the welfare state. Its policy platform emphasized women&#x27;s rights, environmentalism, and Māori rights. It supported New Zealand&#x27;s nuclear-free policy and opposed military interventionism, particularly during the war in Afghanistan. The Alliance supported proportional representation for elections.

The Alliance advocated a progressive tax, which would mean a higher tax rate for wealthier people and a lower rate for poorer people. It also supported the removal of the Goods and Services Tax, seeing the tax as unfair because the amount paid does not vary according to the purchaser&#x27;s ability to afford it; it advocated replacing this with a financial transaction tax, or Tobin tax.

==History==

===Foundation===
The Alliance was formed at the end of 1991 as an alliance of four parties. The largest of the four was the NewLabour Party (not associated with the later New Labour movement in the UK), established by former Labour Party politician Jim Anderton. The oldest was the Democratic Party (originally known as the Social Credit Political League, and dedicated to Social Credit policies). The others were Mana Motuhake (a Māori party) and the Greens (an environmentalist party).

Until his departure from Labour in 1989, Anderton had been the most vocal Labour MP in his criticism of his party&#x27;s new direction. Led by Roger Douglas, the Minister of Finance, Labour had adopted radical policies of economic liberalisation, free trade, and privatisation of state assets – sharply in contrast both with the party&#x27;s background and its campaign promises. This was deeply unpopular both with a section of the public and with ordinary members, but Douglas and his allies, without effective constraint by Prime Minister David Lange, pressed on with the reforms. Anderton, despite heavy pressure from the party authorities, refused to vote in favour of the measures, and eventually quit the party. He contested the 1990 election under the banner of NewLabour, a party he quickly established. He successfully retained his electorate seat, becoming the first MP to leave a party and not lose their position in the next elections.

NewLabour, the Democrats, and Mana Motuhake, all of which opposed the platform set out by Douglas, gradually began to work together to fight their common political opposition. The Greens, who had policies and electoral support, but not party organisation, also took notice. Initially, this co-operation was limited, but expanded after a joint candidate was successful in an Auckland local-body election. In two concurrent by-elections on the Auckland Regional Council (ARC) in November 1991 the parties coalesced around a single candidate in each race; Bruce Jesson of NewLabour in the Panmure Ward and Ruth Norman from the Greens in the Glenfield Ward. Both were successful giving a huge boost in confidence and publicity to the incipient party.


On 1 December 1991, NewLabour, the Greens, the Democrats, and Mana Motuhake formally agreed to establish the Alliance as an official party. This established the three original pillars of Alliance policy – left-wing economics (represented by NewLabour and the Democrats), environmentalism (represented by the Greens), and Māori issues (represented by Mana Motuhake).

Shortly after the official establishment of the Alliance, a small splinter group from the National Party applied to join. This group, known as the Liberal Party (not to be confused with the original Liberal Party), consisted of two former National Party MPs who were disillusioned with the continuation of Douglas&#x27;s policies by National&#x27;s Ruth Richardson. The Liberals became the fifth member of the Alliance in June 1992. The addition of the two Liberal MPs (Gilbert Myles and Hamish MacIntyre) together with Anderton gave the party more of a presence in parliament. Later at the Alliance&#x27;s inaugural party conference in November 1992 Anderton was officially confirmed as party leader and members elected Sandra Lee of Mana Motuhake and Jeanette Fitzsimons from the Greens as co-deputy leaders.

There were also discussions regarding the Alliance&#x27;s links with Winston Peters, a former National MP who founded the New Zealand First party. Peters was also opposed to the economic reforms being undertaken, was hostile towards big business, and claimed to support ordinary New Zealanders, but was also highly conservative in his social policies. In particular, his views on immigration were incompatible with the Alliance&#x27;s belief in multiculturalism. There were also problems regarding who would lead any merged entity – both the Alliance&#x27;s Anderton and New Zealand First&#x27;s Peters were well regarded for standing up to their old parties, leaving it unclear which of them should be senior. (Some have also claimed that neither Anderton nor Peters would accept being ranked second – both politicians are sometimes accused by their critics of being egotistical and controlling). Regardless of the reason, the Alliance and New Zealand First did not move together. As a result, Myles and several other top figures in the Liberal Party left the Alliance and joined with New Zealand First instead.

===Early electoral performance===
In 1992, the Alliance contested a by-election in the electorate of Tamaki. The former stronghold of Robert Muldoon, a former National Party prime minister, Tamaki was not regarded as an easy run for the Alliance. It was, therefore, surprising when the Alliance nearly took the seat off National after going to first place in several polls. The Alliance candidate, Chris Leitch of the Democrats, finished a close second behind National&#x27;s Clem Simich, pushing Labour into third place.

In February 1992 the Alliance won a third by-election on the ARC when Mike Lee of NewLabour won the Auckland Central Ward giving the party further momentum. Later that year, the Alliance made further gains in the 1992 local-body elections campaigning on a platform of halting the sale of public utilities. After a strong campaign the party gained control of the ARC&#x27;s services trust and was able to cease sales. These two performances helped establish the Alliance as a significant threat to the major parties.

In the 1993 election, the Alliance gained 18% of the vote. However, the electoral system meant that the party only won two seats – one delivered by Jim Anderton, and the other by Sandra Lee in Auckland. Occurring at the same time as this election, however, was the referendum which introduced the mixed-member proportional (MMP) representation electoral system, making it much easier for smaller parties to get representation. The Alliance was a strong supporter of this change.

In 1994, Jim Anderton left the leadership of the Alliance, citing family reasons. Sandra Lee was placed in charge of the party. Later, however, Anderton was persuaded to return, and resumed the leadership.

===Under MMP===
In the 1996 election, the Alliance gained 10% of the vote. Under the new electoral system, this secured the party thirteen MPs. New Zealand First, however, had obtained seventeen MPs, and held the balance of power between Labour and National. Eventually, New Zealand First leader Winston Peters opted to form a coalition with National, leaving both Labour and the Alliance in opposition.

The Labour Party, now led by Helen Clark, had moved away from the policies of Roger Douglas — both Douglas and his strongest supporter, Richard Prebble, had left Labour to found the ACT party, and Clark&#x27;s more traditional faction had taken over. This allowed a gradual reconciliation between Labour and the Alliance, a process assisted by the impression that lack of cooperation had cost both parties support. Eventually, this led to an agreement between the two parties in 1998, with both sides agreeing to cooperate in forming a government should election results allow it.

In 1997, the Greens decided that they would leave the Alliance at the next election, believing that they could perform better individually. However, MP Philida Bunkle left the Greens to remain with the Alliance. Other developments in the Alliance&#x27;s makeup included the formal dissolution of both the NewLabour Party and the Liberal Party, with their members becoming members of the Alliance as a whole rather than of any specific constituent party. This left the Democrats and Mana Motuhake as the only parts of the Alliance with distinct identities.

In the 1999 election, the Alliance gained around 8% of the vote, giving it ten seats. This, combined with Labour&#x27;s forty-nine seats and some support from the Greens, was enough to form a coalition government. Jim Anderton became Deputy Prime Minister, and three other Alliance MPs gained positions in Cabinet. The Alliance claims to have made a number of significant achievements while in government, citing (among other things) the creation of the Ministry of Economic Development, the lifting of the minimum wage, a change in funding systems for schools, and abolition of market rents for state housing. The party also claims to have exerted an important general influence over other governmental decisions.

===Split===
Towards the end of the parliamentary term, however, internal tensions began to grow within the Alliance. This was partly driven by the party&#x27;s low poll ratings, which were often blamed on perceived &quot;subservience&quot; to Labour. In particular, many members of the party organisation were less willing to support Labour than the party&#x27;s MPs were, leading to a rift between parliamentary leader Anderton and party president Matt McCarten.

On 3 April 2002, Anderton and Lee announced they would not stand for the Alliance in the next general election. However, rules regarding changes of party allegiance meant that Anderton and his allies could not officially resign from the Alliance without also resigning from parliament, leading to the awkward situation of Anderton and his allies technically remaining part of the Alliance while actually operating outside of it. 

Anderton, along with the Democrats (with MPs Grant Gillon and John Wright) and Matt Robson (formerly of NewLabour), established the Progressive Coalition Party (later just the Progressive Party). Laila Harré became the leader of the remaining Alliance, supported by MPs Willie Jackson and Liz Gordon. The rest of Mana Motuhake also stayed with the Alliance. The remaining three MPs (Bunkle and Lee supporting Anderton and Kevin Campbell supporting Harré) decided not to stand for parliament again. Labour was largely successful in avoiding being drawn into the dispute. The conflict within the Alliance was one of the reasons cited by Helen Clark for her calling the election several months early in 2002.

===Decline===
In the 2002 election, the Alliance and the Progressives competed against each other. The Alliance, believing that it would struggle to reach 5% (the threshold for a party being awarded representation proportional to its support), needed to win an electorate seat to gain entry to parliament. It chose to focus on (contested by Harré) and (contested by Willie Jackson, leader of Mana Motuhake). In both seats, however, the Alliance came second, losing each time to a Labour candidate, and so failed to gain parliamentary representation. In the list vote, the party failed to meet the threshold, gaining only 1.27% of the Party vote.

After the election, Mana Motuhake chose to leave the Alliance. This left the Alliance without any component parties – all members were now simply members of the Alliance as a whole.

Laila Harré stepped down as the party&#x27;s leader on 30 November 2003, and was replaced by Matt McCarten, the party president who clashed with Anderton. McCarten advocated a policy which would see the Alliance focus less on electoral activity and more on playing a co-ordinating role—he has been a particularly strong advocate of working with the new Māori Party, which the Alliance had been involved with and practically supported during Tariana Turia&#x27;s by-election campaign and the Maori Party launch. There was a debate within the Alliance, given the poll ratings of less than 1%, as to whether the Alliance should contest the list vote in the 2005 election, or instead only stand in electorate seats and encourage its supporters to use their list vote to support the Greens or the Māori Party. Jill Ovens, a former candidate and the new party president, was critical of McCarten&#x27;s support of the Māori Party, saying that working both for the Alliance and the Māori Party at the same time represented a conflict of interest and resigned at one stage over the issue (Ovens subsequently joined the Labour Party in 2006). When no agreement could be reached on the electoral strategy McCarten and Harré disassociated themselves from the Alliance. Gerard Hehir, the outgoing General Secretary, informed the Electoral Commission that the Alliance no longer had the five hundred financial members required for registration. In late 2004 McCarten was replaced as leader by two co-leaders, Jill Ovens and Paul Piesse and the party&#x27;s remaining membership voted to contest the list vote. In the 2005 election, the Alliance gained only 0.07% of the Party vote, placing 12th of the parties.
Following its poor showing in the 2005 election, the Alliance continued after their 2005 conference with two co-leaders Paul Piesse and Len Richards. The party also began to describe itself as socialist for the first time.

At the 2006 conference held in Wellington, no co-leaders were elected with the party deciding to concentrate on internal reorganisation. Victor Billot was elected president. At the 2007 national conference, held in Dunedin, two co-leaders were elected, Victor Billot and Kay Murray, with Paul Piesse returning to his former role as Party President. Speakers at the 2007 national conference included political commentator Chris Trotter and publisher Jack Yan. The Alliance stated its intention to run a list of candidates and electorate candidates in the 2008 general election. In April 2008 the party had between 500 and 600 members.

During the process of regroupment since the 2005 election the Alliance has reaffirmed its role as a broad left-wing political party committed to contesting both electorate seats and a party list. The party continued to release an annual alternative budget, prepared by the Alliance spokesperson on tax, the academic and intelligence researcher Jim Flynn. In 2008 the Alliance adopted a new logo designed by Jack Yan &amp; Associates to signal the changes it has undergone and its intention for renewal and rebuilding.

In the 2008 election the Alliance fielded candidates in all major New Zealand centres, contesting 15 electorate seats and running a party list of 30 candidates under the co-leaders Kay Murray and Andrew McKenzie. The party managed to marginally improve its party vote to 1,721, amounting to 0.08 percent of the party vote and placing the Alliance 7th out of 12 extra-parliamentary parties. The Alliance candidate for Dunedin North, Victor Billot, gathered 448 electorate votes, placing him 6th in that electorate.

After the election of the fifth National government on 8 November 2008, the Alliance pledged to &quot;play a leading role in resisting the attacks against public services, workers, beneficiaries and students that will be a feature of the new National Government.&quot;

The party unsuccessfully contested the 2011 election, gaining just 1,069 party votes, the lowest of any registered party. It did not nominate a list for the 2014 election, and nominated only a single electorate candidate: Mary O&#x27;Neill in Napier in which she came fifth with 59 votes.

The party was formally deregistered with the Electoral Commission at its own request on 26 May 2015. Without registration, the party cannot contest the party vote. , the party&#x27;s website remains online with an active blog. The website describes a conference planned for August 2016 but it is unclear if this went ahead.
In 2020, the former Alliance MP Phillida Bunkle wrote an essay for &quot;Newsroom&quot; about her time in the party, in which she made allegations of a culture of bullying and misuse of funds, and of disruptive power-play by an internal grouping she called &quot;the Faction.&quot;

<text>Gothi or &#x27; (plural &#x27;, fem. &#x27;; Old Norse: &#x27;) was a position of political and social prominence in the Icelandic Commonwealth. The term originally had a religious significance, referring to a pagan leader responsible for a religious structure and communal feasts, but the title is primarily known as a secular political title from medieval Iceland.

==Etymology==
The word derives from , meaning &quot;god&quot;. It possibly appears in Ulfilas&#x27; Gothic language translation of the Bible as for &quot;priest&quot;, although the corresponding form of this in Icelandic would have been an unattested . In Scandinavia, there is one surviving attestation in the Proto-Norse form from the Norwegian Nordhuglo runestone (Rundata N KJ65 U), and in the later Old Norse form from three Danish runestones: DR 190 Helnæs, DR 192 Flemløse 1 and DR 209 Glavendrup. There are a few placenames, such as in Södermanland, Sweden, that probably retain the name. Otherwise, there are no further surviving attestations except from Iceland where the would be of historical significance.

==History==
===Mainland Scandinavia===

From the pagan era in mainland Scandinavia, the only sources for the title are runestones. The Norwegian Nordhuglo stone from around AD 400 seems to place the title in opposition to magic, using a word related to the Old Norse . The inscription&#x27;s means &quot;I, &quot; followed by &quot;he who is immune to sorcery&quot; or &quot;he who does not engage in sorcery&quot;. The three Danish stones are all from Funen. The early Viking Age Helnæs and Flemløse 1 stones provide no details about the function of a , but mention a named Roulv whose name also appears on two other runestones, the lost Avnslev stone and the Flemløse 2 stone. The early 10th-century Glavendrup stone uses the term for a local dignitary who was associated with a , which is a religious structure. It thus attaches the title to a simultaneously secular and religious upper strata.

===Iceland===
The most reliable sources about the in Iceland are the Gray Goose Laws, the and the . After the settlement of Iceland, a was usually a wealthy and respected man in his district, for he had to maintain the communal hall or in which community religious observances and feasts were held. The office over which a had leadership was termed a , a word that only appears in Icelandic sources. Initially many independent were established, until they united under the Althing around 930. In 964, the system was fixed under a constitution that recognized 39 . The role of the as secular leaders is shown in how the word was used synonymously with , meaning &quot;chieftain&quot;. Over time, and especially after 1000, when the Christian conversion occurred in Iceland, the term lost all religious connotations and came to mean liege-lord or chieftain of the Icelandic Commonwealth. A could be bought, shared, traded or inherited. If a woman inherited a she had to leave the leadership to a man. The office was in many respects treated as private property but was not counted as taxable, and is defined in the Gray Goose Laws as &quot;power and not wealth&quot; (); nevertheless the are frequently portrayed in the sagas as concerned with money and expected to be paid for their services.

During the Icelandic Commonwealth, the responsibilities of a or (&quot; man&quot;) included the annual organization of the local assemblies in the spring and in the autumn. At the national Althing, they were voting members of the , the legislative section of the assembly. When quarter courts were introduced in the 960s, the became responsible for nominating judges for the Althing courts. When a court of appeals was established in the early 11th century, they also nominated judges for this court. Further, they had a few formal and informal executive roles, such as confiscating the property of outlaws. They also had a central role in the redistribution of wealth, by holding feasts, giving gifts, making loans, extending hospitality, as well as pricing and helping to distribute imported goods. The holder of the of the descendants of Ingólfr Arnarson, the first Scandinavian to settle permanently in Iceland, had the ceremonial role of sanctifying the Althing each year, and was called the (&quot;all-people &quot;). The followers of a were called . Every free landowner in possession of a certain amount of property was required to be associated with a , although he was free to choose which one—a was not a geographical unit. The would help his to bring cases before the court and to enforce their rights, and the would in return provide the with armed manpower for his feuds and carry out legal sentences.

By the 13th century, all the were controlled by five or six families and often united under office holders who in modern studies are known as (&quot;great &quot;) or (&quot;great chieftains&quot;). These struggled for regional and sometimes national power, and occasionally sought to become retainers for the Norwegian king. The institution came to an end when the major pledged fealty to king Haakon IV of Norway in 1262–1264, signing the Old Covenant, and the Norwegian crown abolished the system.

==Neopaganism==
In the early 1970s, the words , and were adopted by the Icelandic neopagan organization . Following this, , or is often used as a priestly title by modern adherents of various denominations of Germanic neopaganism.

Golden Gate Park forms the neighborhood&#x27;s northern border, and the Pacific Ocean (or, more specifically, the long, flat strand of beach known as Ocean Beach) forms its western border. A section of the Sunset District towards its southeastern end is known as the Parkside neighborhood. Prior to the residential and commercial development of the Sunset District, much of the area was covered by sand dunes and was originally referred to by 19th century San Franciscans as the &quot;Outside Lands.&quot;

The Sunset District and the neighboring Richmond District (on the north side of Golden Gate Park) are often collectively known as The Avenues, because the majority of both neighborhoods are spanned by numbered north–south avenues. When the city was originally laid out, the avenues were numbered from 1st to 49th, and the east–west streets were lettered A to X. In 1909, to reduce confusion for mail carriers, the east–west streets and 1st Avenue and 49th Avenue were renamed. The east–west streets were named in ascending alphabetical order in a southward direction after prominent 19th-century American politicians, military leaders, or explorers; 19th-century Mexican landowners; and Spanish conquistadors. 1st Avenue was renamed Arguello Boulevard, and 49th Avenue was renamed La Playa Street (Spanish for &quot;the beach&quot;).

Today, the first numbered avenue is 2nd Avenue, starting one block west of Arguello Boulevard, and the last is 48th Avenue near Ocean Beach. The avenue numbers increase incrementally, with one exception: what would be 13th Avenue is known as Funston Avenue, named after Frederick Funston, a U.S. Army general known for his exploits during the Spanish–American War and Philippine–American War, and for directing the U.S. Army response to the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.

The east–west streets in the Sunset appear mostly in alphabetical order. These streets are: Lincoln Way (bordering the south side of Golden Gate Park), Hugo (from Arguello to 7th Avenue only), Irving, Judah, Kirkham, Lawton, Moraga, Noriega, Ortega, Pacheco, Quintara, Rivera, Santiago, Taraval, Ulloa, Vicente, Wawona, Yorba, and Sloat Boulevard. &quot;X&quot; was originally proposed to be Xavier, but was changed to Yorba due to a pronunciation controversy.

==History==
The origin of the &quot;Sunset&quot; name is not entirely clear. One claim indicates that Aurelius Buckingham, a developer who owned property in the area, coined the term in 1886. Another claim comes from the California Midwinter Exposition, held in Golden Gate Park in 1894 and also known as &quot;The Sunset City.&quot;

Before construction of the Twin Peaks Tunnel in 1917, the Sunset was a vast, sparsely inhabited area of large sand dunes and coastal scrub land known as the &quot;Outside Lands.&quot; Development was initiated in the 1870s and 1880s with construction of Golden Gate Park, but it did not reach a full scale until after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, when small lots of tract homes and row homes now characteristic of the neighborhood were built into the sand dunes. These tract homes would displace a smaller original settlement built into the dunes called Carville, which was so named for squatters that lived in abandoned horsecars (horse-drawn trolleys) and cable cars that were dumped in the sand dunes. Development increased by the 1930s, as the Sunset was built and developed into a streetcar suburb. The post–World War II baby boom in the 1950s saw the last of the sand dunes leveled down and replaced with more single – and multifamily homes. In these developments, built mostly by Henry Doelger, entire blocks consist mainly of houses of the same general character, differentiated by variations in their stucco facades and mirrored floorplans, with most built upon lots with no free space between houses. Later, Oliver Rousseau built more individualistic homes in the district.

Historically, the Sunset has been an Irish and Italian ethnic enclave. Beginning in the late 1960s the neighborhood saw a steady influx of Asian (mostly Chinese) immigrants following the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 which lifted racial quotas allowing for more nationals of countries outside Western and Northern Europe to immigrate to the United States. Additionally, the Handover of Hong Kong motivated many Chinese to immigrate to the U.S. due to the political and economic uncertainties. In 1999, around 60% of the homeowners in the Sunset and Richmond districts were Chinese.

== Sub-neighborhoods ==
=== Inner Sunset ===

The Inner Sunset is bordered by Lincoln Way to the north, 2nd Ave to the east, Quintara Street to the south, and 19th Avenue to the west. This far-east section of the Sunset is located just west of Mount Sutro. The main commercial area is along Irving Street from 5th Avenue to 12th Avenue, and along 9th Avenue from Lincoln Way to Judah Street, much of which is dotted with a variety of restaurants and shops.

The Inner Sunset hosts a variety of local businesses, including restaurants, bars, breweries, book stores, bakeries, coffee shops, ice cream parlors, clothes and shoe stores, a tattoo parlor, and a wine bar. Many of these establishments are clustered around the intersection of 9th Avenue and Irving Street. Food offered by the restaurants located in the Inner Sunset includes pizza, Mexican, Thai, Persian, Korean, Malaysian, Hawaiian, Greek, Ethiopian, Pakistani, Cajun/Creole, Dim Sum, Turkish, Peruvian, Chinese, Vietnamese, California Cuisine, Mediterranean, Indian, Japanese, Vegetarian.

The Inner Sunset is the 12th wealthiest neighborhood in San Francisco with a median income of $112,050. The median sale price of homes in the Sunset District is $1.5M.

=== Central Sunset ===
The Central Sunset is bounded by Lincoln Way to the north, 19th Avenue to the east, Ortega Street to the south, and Sunset Boulevard to the west. This area is mostly residential with cookie-cutter homes and large lots and a commercial strip along Irving Street from 19th Avenue to 27th Avenue and on Noriega Street from 19th Avenue to 27th Avenue and 30th Avenue to 33rd Avenue. Features of the area include the Sunset Reservoir (which takes up eight square blocks between Ortega and Quintara streets and 24th and 28th avenues), which has a small park surrounding its outer rim; Golden Gate Park; and the Sunset Recreation Center. The Central Sunset is often considered part of the Outer Sunset, including by the Mayor&#x27;s Office of Neighborhood Services.

=== Outer Sunset ===
The Outer Sunset is bordered by Lincoln Way to the north, Sunset Boulevard (between 36th and 37th avenues) to the east, Sloat Boulevard to the south, and Ocean Beach to the west. The primary commercial avenues are Judah, Noriega, and Taraval. The Outer Sunset is the foggiest section in San Francisco due to its close proximity to Ocean Beach. The area&#x27;s main attractions include the San Francisco Zoo, Golden Gate Park, Ocean Beach, and Lake Merced.

==Attractions and characteristics==


The western part of the Sunset borders the cold northern California Pacific Ocean coastline, so it tends to get much of the fog San Francisco is famous for. The Sunset can be foggy and chilly for some days during summer. The Sunset&#x27;s finest weather is usually from August through December, when regional air patterns transition from onshore to offshore weather and the area is free of fog. Sand carried by Pacific Ocean winds can be found on roadways and driveways within the first five to ten blocks east of Ocean Beach.

The Sunset District contains several large park and recreation areas. The San Francisco Zoo is located in the southwestern corner of the neighborhood by Lake Merced, the largest lake within San Francisco. Also within the Lake Merced area are several golf courses: the private Olympic Club and San Francisco Golf Club, and the public TPC Harding Park. Across from Lake Merced is Fort Funston, an old coastal battery, now part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. Fort Funston notably has some of the last remnants of the sand dune ecosystem that once covered the entire Sunset District.

There is a year-round, Sunday morning farmers&#x27; market which is located at 1315 8th Avenue (the parking lot between 8th and 9th Avenues). The market is operated by the Pacific Coast Farmers&#x27; Market Association and is sponsored by the Inner Sunset Park Neighbors. The Inner Sunset Farmers&#x27; Market offers California-grown produce, fish, eggs, and meat, as well as local food vendors and artisans.

Stern Grove, a heavily wooded park and amphitheater located on Sloat Boulevard between 19th and 34th avenues, is known for its annual summer festival.

Three parks lie on the far east border of the district: the northernmost is Grand View Park (also referred to as Turtle Hill) a small, elevated park surrounded by 14th and 15th Avenues, as well as Noriega Street; moving south, next is Golden Gate Heights Park, just east of 14th Avenue north of Quintara; and Hawk Hill Park, also east of 14th Avenue at Santiago. These natural areas belong to a remnant ridge-top system and include some of the last-remaining sand-dune communities in the city.

== Education ==
The San Francisco Unified School District operates public K–12 schools.

Educational institutions include the Parnassus campus and medical center of the University of California, San Francisco, located in Inner Sunset; the main campus of San Francisco State University, located in the southwestern corner of the neighborhood across from Lake Merced; Abraham Lincoln High School, located in the center of the Sunset District; St. Ignatius College Preparatory (a private, coeducational school educating men and women for others in the Jesuit tradition in San Francisco since 1855; one of the oldest, most prestigious, high achieving, top performing secondary schools in the state of California) located since 1969 adjacent to Sunset Boulevard; and Lowell High School, the oldest public high school west of the Mississippi.

== Beach culture ==
The strip near the Pacific Ocean has a notable&lt;ref name=&quot;newyorker/docs-games&quot;&gt;
*
&lt;/ref&gt; population of surfers who take advantage of the sometimes excellent surf conditions of Ocean Beach. Because of the cold Pacific current that brings ocean water from Alaska, it is usually necessary to wear a wetsuit when surfing at Ocean Beach. Several surf shops can be found near the beach in the Outer Sunset.

Several playgrounds are located in the Sunset, including Sunset Playground and Recreation Center, Blue Boat Playground, West Sunset, McCoppin Square, and South Sunset.

==Climate==
Like much of the coast of Northern California, the Sunset district has a cool summer Mediterranean-type climate, albeit with an unusual annual temperature distribution. The warmest days of the year occur in October and then the coldest nights of the year occur just two months later in December. Its climate is strongly influenced by the Pacific Ocean and therefore has even cooler summers and milder winters than downtown San Francisco. Rainfall follows a seasonal pattern with plentiful precipitation in the winter (almost all of this falling as rain) and extremely dry albeit foggy summers.

<doc id="350907" wikidata="Q316217" url="?curid=350907" title="Shūsaku Endō">
<text>was a Japanese author who wrote from the perspective of a Japanese Catholic. Internationally, he is known for his 1966 historical fiction novel &quot;Silence&quot;, which was adapted into a 2016 film of the same name by director Martin Scorsese. He was the laureate of several prestigious literary accolades, including the Akutagawa Prize and the Order of Culture, and was inducted into the Roman Catholic Order of St. Sylvester by Pope Paul VI.

Together with Junnosuke Yoshiyuki, Shōtarō Yasuoka, Junzo Shono, Hiroyuki Agawa, Ayako Sono (also Catholic), and Shumon Miura, Endō is categorized as part of the &quot;Third Generation&quot; (that is, the third major group of Japanese writers to appear after World War II).

== Biography ==
Soon after Endō was born in Tokyo in 1923, his family moved to Dairen, then part of the Kwantung Leased Territory in Manchuria. When his parents divorced in 1933, Endō&#x27;s mother brought him back to Japan to live with an aunt in Kobe. Endō was baptized as a Catholic at the age of 11 or 12 in 1934. Some say this was brought on by his mother, who had converted to Catholicism after her divorce, while others state the aunt instigated the initiation.

Endō first attended Waseda University for the stated purpose of studying medicine, but later decided to switch to the literature programme at Keio University. His studies were interrupted by the war, during which he worked in a munitions factory and also contributed to literary journals. In 1968, he would later become chief editor of one of these, the prestigious &quot;Mita Bungaku&quot;.

Endō was among the first Japanese university students to study in France. His studies at the University of Lyon over the 1950–1953 period deepened his interest in and knowledge of modern French Catholic authors, who were to become a major influence on his own writing.

Upon his return to Japan, his success as a writer was almost immediate. In 1954, a year after completing his studies in France, he won the Akutagawa Prize for &quot;Shiroi Hito&quot; (White Men).

Endō married Okada Junko in 1955. They had one son, Ryūnosuke, born in 1956.

Endō lectured at at least two Tokyo universities. In 1956, he was hired as an instructor at Sophia University, and Seijo University assigned him the role of &quot;Lecturer on the Theory of the Novel&quot; in 1967. He was considered a novelist not a university professor, however.

Throughout his life bouts of disease plagued him, and he spent two years in hospital at one point. In 1952, while studying in France, he came down with pleurisy in Paris. A return visit in 1960 prompted another case of the same disease, and he stayed in hospital (in France and Japan) for the greater part of three years. Among other health problems, he contracted tuberculosis, underwent thoracoplasty, and had a lung removed.

While he lost the 1994 Nobel Prize in Literature to Kenzaburō Ōe, he received the Order of Culture the subsequent year. Endō died shortly thereafter from complications of hepatitis at Keio University Hospital in Tokyo on September 29, 1996.

== Writing style and themes ==
While Endō wrote in several genres, his oeuvre is strongly tied to Christianity. Endō has been called &quot;a novelist whose work has been dominated by a single theme ... belief in Christianity&quot;. Others have said that he is &quot;almost by default ... [labeled] a &#x27;Japanese Catholic author&#x27; struggling to &#x27;plant the seeds of his adopted religion&#x27; in the &#x27;mudswamp&#x27; of Japan&quot;. He often likened Japan to a swamp or fen. In the novel &quot;Silence&quot;, an official tells a priest who has apostatized, &quot;Father, it was not by us that you were defeated, but by this mudswamp, Japan.&quot; In Endō&#x27;s stage version of this story, &quot;The Golden Country&quot;, this official also says: &quot;But the mudswamp too has its good points, if you will but give yourself up to its comfortable warmth. The teachings of Christ are like a flame. Like a flame they set a man on fire. But the tepid warmth of Japan will eventually nurture sleep.&quot; Thus, many of Endō&#x27;s characters are allegories.

Some Christian critics have looked askance at Endō&#x27;s works—for example, as portraying historical Japanese Christian martyrs in too negative a light—but others have embraced him, with positive assessments in Catholic and Christian journals and the award of an honorary degree from the Jesuit John Carroll University—the first the institution had ever bestowed upon an author. 

While not the main focus of his works, a few of Endō&#x27;s books mention Kakure Kirishitans (hidden Christians), though Endō preferred to use the term instead of the more common . Some of his characters (many of whom are allegories) may reference non-Western religions.

His books reflect many of his childhood experiences, including the stigma of being an outsider, the experience of being a foreigner, the life of a hospital patient, and the struggle with tuberculosis. However, his books mainly deal with the moral fabric of life; most of his characters struggle with complex moral dilemmas, and their choices often produce mixed or tragic results. 

His Catholic faith can be seen at some level in all of his books, and it is often a central feature. His work is often compared to that of Graham Greene, with whom he shared a mutual admiration: Greene himself labeled Endō one of the finest writers alive, while it is reported that Endo would re-read Greene&#x27;s novel &quot;The End of the Affair&quot; before beginning a new work of his own.

== Partial list of works ==
* : Published in the November 1954 issue of , a literary journal of Tokyo&#x27;s Keio University.
* (&quot;White Man&quot;) (1955)
* (&quot;Yellow Man&quot;) (1955): A novella in the form of a letter written by a young man, no longer a practising Catholic, to his former pastor, a French missionary.
* (&quot;The Sea and Poison&quot;) (1957): Set largely in a Fukuoka hospital during World War II, this novel is concerned with medical experimentation carried out on downed American airmen. It is written with alternating points of view: the bulk of the story is written with a subjective, limited (but shifting) third-person view; three segments are told in first-person view. Inspired by true events, this novel was made into the 1986 movie &quot;The Sea and Poison&quot;. Directed by Kei Kumai, it stars Eiji Okuda and Ken Watanabe.
* (&quot;Wonderful Fool&quot;) (1959): A story about a kind, innocent, and naïve Frenchman visiting post-war Tokyo. Gaston Bonaparte is a Christ-like figure who comes to live with a Japanese family. He befriends a variety of &quot;undesirables&quot; including stray dogs, prostitutes, and a killer. In spite of this unusual behavior he changes everyone he meets for the better.
* (&quot;Stained Glass Elegies&quot;) (1959): Translated to English in 1984.
* (&quot;Volcano&quot;) (1960): A novel concerning three declining figures: an apostate Catholic priest, the director of a weather station in provincial Japan, and the volcano on which the latter is an expert.
* (&quot;The Girl I Left Behind&quot;) (1964): A story of a young man and his mismatches with an innocent young woman. As Endō writes in the foreword to the English translation, one of the characters has a connection with Otsu, a character in Endo&#x27;s later novel Deep River.
* (1965) Three linked narratives chart the gulf between East and West. Evoking Paris in the 1960s, 17th century Rome, and provincial France in the post-World War II years, Endō acutely conveys the alienation felt by three Japanese students when confronted by the spiritual values and culture of Europe.
* (&quot;Silence&quot;) (1966): Winner of the Tanizaki Prize and Endō&#x27;s most famous work, it is generally regarded as his masterpiece. &quot;Silence&quot; has been published in English by Peter Owen Publishers, London. This historical novel tells the story of a Catholic missionary priest in early 17th century Japan, who apostatizes to save the lives of several people, and then becomes a retainer of the local lord, but continues to keep the Christian faith in private. The character is based on the historical figure of Giuseppe Chiara.
** The book inspired the feature film adaptations &quot;Silence&quot; (1971) by Masahiro Shinoda, &quot;Os Olhos da Ásia&quot; (1996) by Portuguese film director João Mário Grilo, and &quot;Silence&quot; (2016) by Martin Scorsese. The last of these was premiered in Vatican City on November 29, 2016, and was released in the United States on December 23, 2016.
* &quot;The Golden Country&quot; (1966): A play featuring many of the characters who appear in the novel &quot;Silence&quot;.
* (1971): A satirical novel inspired by the historical figure of Yasuke, a 16th-century African man who served as a retinue and weapons-bearer under the daimyo Oda Nobunaga. The novel&#x27;s title is a Japanese racial slur for Black people, equivalent to the word &quot;nigger&quot; in English.
* (&quot;Banks of the Dead Sea&quot;) (1973)
* (&quot;Life of Jesus&quot;) (1973)
* (&quot;When I Whistle&quot;) (1974)
* (&quot;Iron Collar - The Story of Konishi Yukinaga&quot;) (1977): The biography of Konishi Yukinaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi&#x27;s Christian protege, who got caught between Christianity and the samurai code demanding blind obedience to his anti-Christian master.
* (&quot;Marie Antoinette&quot;) (1979): This book inspired the musical &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot; by German musical dramatist and lyricist Michael Kunze.
* (&quot;The Samurai&quot;) (1980): A historical novel set in the 17th century relating the diplomatic mission of a group of samurai, including the protagonist Hasekura Tsunenaga, together with a Spanish missionary, Pedro Velasco, to travel to the Western world: Mexico, Spain, and eventually Rome. Velasco hopes to become primate of Catholic Japan, and his mission is to bargain for a crusade to Japan in return for trading rights.

* 女の一生 (&quot;Sachiko&quot;) (1982): A novel set in Nagasaki during the years between 1930 and 1945 about two young people trying to find love and dealing with their Catholic faith in a period where Japanese Christians were accused of treason disloyalty to their country and Emperor. 
* (&quot;Novels Loved by Me&quot;) &amp; (&quot;Search for the Real Me&quot;) (1985)
* (&quot;Scandal&quot;) (1986): Set in Tokyo, the book is about a novelist who comes face to face with a doppelgänger of himself, who engages in lewd sexual activity. While the protagonist attempts to find his &quot;impostor&quot;, a journalist dogs the author, searching for a scoop.
* (&quot;Deep River&quot;) (1993): Set in India, it chronicles the physical and spiritual journey of a group of five Japanese tourists who are facing a wide range of moral and spiritual dilemmas. Working among the poor, sick, and dying, one of the group finds the man that she seduced long ago at college in an attempt to undermine his faith.

<text>Kind Hearts and Coronets is a 1949 British crime black comedy film directed by Robert Hamer. It features Dennis Price, Joan Greenwood, Valerie Hobson and Alec Guinness; Guinness plays eight characters. The plot is loosely based on the novel &quot;Israel Rank: The Autobiography of a Criminal&quot; (1907) by Roy Horniman. It concerns Louis D&#x27;Ascoyne Mazzini, the son of a woman disowned by her aristocratic family for marrying out of her social class. After her death, a vengeful Louis decides to take the family&#x27;s dukedom by murdering the eight people ahead of him in the line of succession to the title. 

Michael Balcon, the head of Ealing Studios and the producer of &quot;Kind Hearts and Coronets&quot;, appointed Hamer as director. Filming took place from September 1948 at Leeds Castle and other locations in Kent, and at Ealing Studios. Themes of class and sexual repression run through the film, particularly love between classes.

&quot;Kind Hearts and Coronets&quot; was released on 13 June 1949 in the United Kingdom, and was well received by the critics. It has continued to receive favourable reviews over the years and, in 1999, it was number six in the British Film Institute&#x27;s ranking of the Top 100 British films. In 2005, it was included in &quot;Time&quot;″s list of the top 100 films since 1923.

==Plot==
In Edwardian England, Louis D&#x27;Ascoyne Mazzini, 10th Duke of Chalfont, is in prison, awaiting his hanging for murder the following morning. As he writes his memoirs, he recounts the events that led him there in a flashback.

His mother, the youngest daughter of the 7th Duke of Chalfont, eloped with an Italian opera singer named Mazzini and was disowned by her family for marrying beneath her station. The Mazzinis were poor, but happy until Mazzini died shortly after Louis was born. Louis&#x27;s mother brings him up among stories of the history of her family and tells him how, unlike most other peerages, the dukedom of Chalfont can descend through female as well as male heirs. Louis&#x27;s only childhood friends are Sibella Hallward and her brother, the children of a local doctor.

When Louis leaves school, his mother writes to her kinsman Lord Ascoyne D&#x27;Ascoyne, head of a private bank, for assistance in launching her son&#x27;s career, but is rebuffed. Louis is forced to work as an assistant to a draper. When his mother dies, her last request, to be interred in the family burial vault at Chalfont Castle, is denied. Louis proposes marriage to Sibella, but she ridicules him, and marries Lionel Holland, a former school friend of her brother who has a rich father. Soon after this, Louis quarrels with a customer, Ascoyne D&#x27;Ascoyne, the banker&#x27;s arrogant only child, who has him dismissed from his job.

Louis resolves to kill Ascoyne D&#x27;Ascoyne and the other seven family members ahead of him in the order of succession to the dukedom. After arranging a fatal boating accident for Ascoyne D&#x27;Ascoyne and his mistress, Louis writes a letter of condolence to his victim&#x27;s father, Lord Ascoyne D&#x27;Ascoyne, who employs him as a clerk. Upon his later promotion, Louis takes a bachelor flat in St James&#x27;s, London, for assignations with Sibella, who is unhappy in her marriage to the dull Lionel.

Louis next targets Henry D&#x27;Ascoyne, a keen amateur photographer. He meets Henry and is charmed by his wife, Edith. He substitutes petrol for paraffin in the lamp in Henry&#x27;s darkroom, with fatal results. Louis decides that Edith is fit to be his duchess. The Reverend Lord Henry D&#x27;Ascoyne is the next victim. Posing as the Bishop of Matabeleland, Louis poisons Lord Henry&#x27;s after-dinner port. From the window of his flat, Louis then uses a bow and arrow to shoot down the balloon from which the suffragette Lady Agatha D&#x27;Ascoyne is dropping leaflets over London. Admiral Lord Horatio D&#x27;Ascoyne presents a challenge, as he rarely sets foot on land. However, by chance he conveniently insists on going down with his ship after causing a collision at sea. Louis next sends General Lord Rufus D&#x27;Ascoyne a jar of caviar which contains a bomb.

When Edith agrees to marry Louis, they notify Ethelred, the childless, widowed eighth duke. He invites them to spend a few days at Chalfont Castle. When Ethelred casually informs Louis that he intends to remarry in order to produce an heir, Louis arranges a hunting &quot;accident&quot;. Before shooting the duke, he reveals his motive. Lord Ascoyne D&#x27;Ascoyne dies from the shock of learning that he has become the ninth duke, sparing Louis from having to murder his kindly employer. Louis inherits the dukedom, but his triumph proves short-lived.

Sibella&#x27;s husband, Lionel, had made a drunken plea to Louis for financial help to avoid bankruptcy, but Louis turned him down flat. Lionel is later found dead, and a Scotland Yard detective arrests Louis on suspicion of murder. Louis elects to be tried by his peers in the House of Lords. During the trial, Louis and Edith are married. Sibella falsely testifies that Lionel was about to seek a divorce and name Louis as co-respondent. Ironically, Louis is convicted of a murder he had never even contemplated.

Louis is visited by Sibella, who observes that the discovery of Lionel&#x27;s suicide note and Edith&#x27;s death would free Louis and enable them to marry, a proposal to which he agrees. Moments before his hanging, the discovery of the note secures his release. Louis finds both Edith and Sibella waiting for him outside the prison, but is undecided which to choose. When a reporter tells him that &quot;Tit-Bits&quot; magazine wishes to publish his memoirs, Louis suddenly remembers that he has left them behind in his cell (thereby providing the authorities with a complete confession).

==Production==
===Pre-production===

In 1947 Michael Pertwee, a scriptwriter at Ealing Studios, suggested an adaptation of a 1907 Roy Horniman novel, &quot;Israel Rank: The Autobiography of a Criminal&quot;. The writer Simon Heffer observes that the plot of the source novel was dark in places—it includes the murder of a child—and differed in several respects from the resulting film. A major difference was that the main character was the half-Jewish (as opposed to half-Italian) Israel Rank, and Heffer writes that Mazzini&#x27;s &quot;ruthless using of people (notably women) and his greedy pursuit of position all seem to conform to the stereotype that the anti-semite has of the Jew&quot;.

The change from Israel Rank to Louis Mazzini was brought about by the &quot;post-war sensitivity about anti-Semitism&quot;, and the moral stance of the films produced by Ealing. According to the British Film Institute (BFI), the novel is &quot;self-consciously in the tradition&quot; of Oscar Wilde, which is reflected in the snobbery and dandyism portrayed in the film.

The head of Ealing Studios, Michael Balcon, was initially unconvinced by the idea of the film, stating that &quot;I&#x27;m not going to make a comedy about eight murders&quot;; the studio&#x27;s creative staff persuaded him to reconsider. Balcon, who produced the film, chose Robert Hamer as director and warned him that &quot;You are trying to sell that most unsaleable commodity to the British – irony. Good luck to you.&quot; Hamer disliked Pertwee, who withdrew from the project, leaving the scriptwriting to Hamer and John Dighton. Hamer saw the potential of the story and later wrote:

What were the possibilities which thus presented themselves? Firstly, in that of making a film not noticeably similar to any previously made in the English language. Secondly, that of using this English language ... in a more varied and, to me, more interesting way than I had previously had the chance of doing in a film. Thirdly, that of making a picture which paid no regard whatever to established, although not practised, moral convention.

The film was produced at the same time as two other Ealing comedies, &quot;Passport to Pimlico&quot; and &quot;Whisky Galore!&quot;; all three were released into British cinemas over two months. The film&#x27;s title was taken from the 1842 poem &quot;Lady Clara Vere de Vere&quot; by Alfred, Lord Tennyson. The full couplet reads

Kind hearts are more than coronets,
And simple faith than Norman blood.
Alec Guinness was originally offered only four D&#x27;Ascoyne parts, recollecting &quot;I read [the screenplay] on a beach in France, collapsed with laughter on the first page, and didn&#x27;t even bother to get to the end of the script. I went straight back to the hotel and sent a telegram saying, &#x27;Why four parts? Why not eight!?&#x27;&quot;

===Filming===
Production began on 1 September 1948. Exterior filming was undertaken in the Kent villages of Harrietsham and Boughton Monchelsea. Leeds Castle, also in Kent, was used for Chalfont, the family home of the D&#x27;Ascoynes. Additional filming was undertaken at Ealing Studios.

The costumes were designed by Anthony Mendleson, who matched Louis&#x27;s rise through the social ranks with his changing costumes. When employed as a shop assistant, Louis&#x27;s suit was ill-fitting and drab; he is later seen in tailored suits with satin lapels, wearing a brocade dressing gown and waiting for his execution in a quilted-collar velvet jacket. Mendleson later recounted that to dress Guinness in his many roles, the costumes were of less importance than make-up and the actor&#x27;s nuances.

In one shot Guinness appears as six of his characters at once in a single frame. This was accomplished by masking the lens. The film was re-exposed several times with Guinness in different positions over several days. Douglas Slocombe, the cinematographer in charge of the effect, recalled sleeping in the studio to make sure nobody touched the camera.

The death of Admiral Horatio D&#x27;Ascoyne was inspired by the collision between HMS &quot;Victoria&quot; and HMS &quot;Camperdown&quot; off Tripoli in 1893 because of an order given by Vice-Admiral Sir George Tryon. &quot;Victoria&quot; was sunk with the loss of over 350 men.

While filming the scene Hamer asked Guinness if he could hold his pose—a salute, facing the camera while the water rose around him—so that the water went over his head; Hamer wanted to show the admiral&#x27;s cap floating on the surface. Guinness agreed, telling Hamer that as he practised yoga, he could hold his breath for four minutes. Guinness was attached to the deck by wires to keep him steady and the shot was taken; when Hamer called &quot;cut&quot;, the crew began packing up and forgot to release Guinness until four minutes after the scene ended.

The music of the film, played by the Philharmonia Orchestra, is conducted by theatre and film conductor and arranger Ernest Irving who &quot;plunders the works of W.A. Mozart to winning effect; the elegance, refinement, and inherent propriety&quot; of the pieces used offering both a metaphor of an ordered society and a &quot;counterpoint for murder most foul&quot;.

==Themes==

The British Film Institute see &quot;Kind Hearts and Coronets&quot; as &quot;less sentimental&quot; than many of the other Ealing films. Along with &quot;The Man in the White Suit&quot; (1951) and &quot;The Ladykillers&quot; (1955), &quot;Kind Hearts and Coronets&quot; &quot;unleash[es] transgressive &quot;nightmares&quot;, fables of subversive, maverick masculine obsession and action, where the repressed and vengeful bubble up to the surface and lead to a resolutions which were only just contained in the moral strictures permissible in (Balcon&#x27;s) Ealing cinema at the time&quot;.

The film historian Sarah Street identifies the theme of sexual repression running through the film, shown with Louis&#x27; relationship with the manipulative Sibella. The historian Ross McKibbin sees the film as a &quot;sustained satire&quot; in its portrayal of the upper classes, partly because of the intended absurdity of the D&#x27;Ascoyne family being portrayed by Guinness. &quot;Lady Clara Vere de Vere&quot;, the poem from which the film&#x27;s title derived, concerns class tensions surrounding love between classes.

==Release and reception==

&quot;Kind Hearts and Coronets&quot; premiered in London on 13 June 1949. In France, the film was released in 1950, selling 1,310,205 tickets. When the film was released in the US in 1950, it was edited to satisfy the Hays Code. A new ending was added, showing Louis&#x27;s memoirs being discovered before he can retrieve them; the dialogue between Louis and Sibella was altered to play down their adultery; derogatory lines aimed at the Reverend Henry D&#x27;Ascoyne were deleted; and in the nursery rhyme &quot;Eeny, meeny, miny, moe&quot;, &quot;sailor&quot; replaced the word &quot;nigger&quot;. The American version is six minutes shorter than the British original.

&quot;Kind Hearts and Coronets&quot; received a warm reception from the critics. Although they thought the film slightly too long, the critic for &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; thought that overall it was very enjoyable &quot;because of the light satirical touch with which mass-murder is handled, ... words are so seldom treated with any respect in the cinema&quot;. Bosley Crowther, the critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, called the film a &quot;delicious little satire on Edwardian manners and morals&quot;, while the unnamed reviewer for &quot;Time&quot; called it &quot;one of the best films of the year&quot;.

Several reviewers, including C. A. Lejeune of &quot;The Observer&quot;, praised Guinness&#x27;s nine roles. The unknown reviewer from &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote that Guinness played his roles &quot;with intelligence and restraint and show[ed] his power as a character actor&quot;, while Crowther considered that Guinness acted with &quot;such devastating wit and variety that he naturally dominates the film&quot;. Price&#x27;s performance was appreciated by a number of critics, including &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot;, who considered he gave a &quot;brilliant performance&quot;, and Richard L. Coe, the critic for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; thought Price was &quot;splendid&quot;; Crowther wrote that Price was &quot;as able as Mr. Guinness in his single but most demanding role&quot;. Lejeune in &quot;The Observer&quot; dissented, and thought he &quot;seems pitifully outclassed every time he comes up against a Guinness&quot; character.

&quot;Kind Hearts and Coronets&quot; was nominated for the British Academy Film Award for Best British Film, alongside &quot;Passport to Pimlico&quot; and &quot;Whisky Galore!&quot;, although they lost to &quot;The Third Man&quot; (1949). The film was screened as one of Britain&#x27;s entries to the 10th Venice International Film Festival; William Kellner won an award for Best Production Design.

According to Michael Newton, writing for the BFI, &quot;Kind Hearts and Coronets&quot; has retained the high regard of film historians. In 1964 &quot;The Spectator&quot; called it &quot;the most confident comedy ever to come out of a British studio&quot;, and the actor Peter Ustinov considered it the &quot;most perfect achievement&quot; of Ealing Studios, &quot;a film of exquisite construction and literary quality&quot;. &quot;Kind Hearts and Coronets&quot; is listed in &quot;Time&quot;″s top 100 and also at number six in the BFI Top 100 British films. Thirteen critics and directors voted for &quot;Kind Hearts and Coronets&quot; in the 2012 BFI poll of The Greatest Films of All Time, including Terence Davies, Peter Bradshaw and Philip French.

==Adaptations==
The film has been adapted for radio three times. In March 1965, the BBC Home Service broadcast an adaptation by Gilbert Travers-Thomas, with Dennis Price reprising his role as Louis D&#x27;Ascoyne Mazzini. BBC Radio 4 produced a new adaptation in 1980 featuring Robert Powell as the entire D&#x27;Ascoyne clan, including Louis, and Timothy Bateson as the hangman, and another in 1996 featuring Michael Kitchen as Mazzini and Harry Enfield as the D&#x27;Ascoyne family.

In May 2012, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a sequel to the film called &quot;Kind Hearts and Coronets – Like Father, Like Daughter&quot;, written by David Spicer. In it, Unity Holland, the illegitimate daughter of Louis and Sibella, is written out of the title by Edith Duchess of Chalfont. Unity then murders the entire D&#x27;Ascoyne family, with all seven members played by Alistair McGowan.

In September 2004, it was announced that a musical adaption was to be workshopped featuring Raul Esparza, Rebecca Luker, Nancy Anderson and Sean Allan Krill. The workshop had music and lyrics by Steven Lutvak with the book and lyrics by Robert L. Freedman. The musical was produced under the title &quot;A Gentleman&#x27;s Guide to Love and Murder&quot; and opened in 2013 at the Walter Kerr Theatre on Broadway. The show has all the victims played by the same actor, in the original company Jefferson Mays. Though the plot remains essentially the same, most of the names are different: half-Italian Louis Mazzini becomes half-Castilian Montague &quot;Monty&quot; Navarro, the D&#x27;Ascoynes become the D&#x27;Ysquiths and Henry&#x27;s wife Edith becomes Henry&#x27;s sister Phoebe. The musical won four Tony Awards, including Best Musical.

In July 1975 EMI Films announced they would film a remake starring Dick Emery but this did not happen.

In May 2024, A24 announced they would distribute the film &quot;Huntington&quot;, whose original screenplay was heavily inspired by &quot;Kind Hearts and Coronets&quot;. Written and directed by John Patton Ford, and starring Glen Powell, Ed Harris, and Margaret Qualley, production began in June 2024 with principal photography taking place in South Africa.

==Digital restoration==
The Criterion Collection released a two-DVD disc set. Disc one featured the standard version of the film released in the UK and, as a bonus feature, includes the final scene with the American ending. Disc two includes a 75-minutes BBC &quot;Omnibus&quot; documentary &quot;Made in Ealing&quot;, plus a 68-minute talk-show appearance with Guinness on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Parkinson&quot; television programme. The British distributor Optimum Releasing released a digitally restored version for both DVD and Blu-ray in September 2011.

To mark the film&#x27;s 70th anniversary in June 2019, a new 4k restoration scanned from the 35 mm nitrate original negative was released by Studiocanal in British cinemas, along with DVD and Blu-Ray versions.

<doc id="350909" wikidata="Q160877" url="?curid=350909" title="Flag of Saudi Arabia">
<text>The national flag of Saudi Arabia is a green background with Arabic inscription and a sword in white. The inscription is the Islamic creed, or &quot;shahada&quot;: &quot;There is no deity but God; Muhammad is the Messenger of God&quot;. The current design has been used by the government of Saudi Arabia since 15 March 1973.

==Design==
The Arabic inscription on the flag, written in the calligraphic Thuluth Script with the current one by Saleh al-Mansouf, is the &quot;shahada&quot; or Islamic declaration of faith:
: &quot;&quot;
:&#x27;There is no god but God; Muhammad is the Messenger of God.&#x27;
The green of the flag represents Islam and the sword stands for the safety and justice.

The flag is manufactured with identical obverse and reverse sides, to ensure the &quot;shahada&quot; reads correctly, from right to left, from either side. The sword also points to the left on both sides, in the direction of the script.

The usual color of the flag&#x27;s green was approximated by Album des pavillons as Pantone 330 C, while the color used on flags at United Nations is approximately Pantone 349. At the 2012 London Olympics, Pantone 355 was used.

===Construction sheet===


==Use==

Because the &quot;shahada&quot; is considered holy, the flag is not normally used on T-shirts or other items. Saudi Arabia protested against its inclusion on a planned football to be issued by FIFA, bearing all the flags of the participants of the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Saudi Arabian officials said that abusing the shahada was completely unacceptable and sacrilegious. Similarly, an attempt by the U.S. military to win favour with children of the Khost Province of Afghanistan by distributing footballs adorned with flags, including that of Saudi Arabia, ended in demonstrations.

The flag is never lowered to half-mast as a sign of mourning, because lowering it would be considered blasphemous and desecrating. Similarly, the flags of Afghanistan and Somaliland also never at half-mast, and neither is the flag of Iraq because it bears the takbir.

The normal flag cannot be hoisted vertically according to Saudi legislation. Special vertical flags are manufactured where both the inscription (the creed) and the emblem (the sword) are rotated, although this is rare, as most Arab countries traditionally do not hoist flags vertically.

==History==
The precursor states to Saudi Arabia were Nejd and Hejaz. The state flag of Nejd followed today&#x27;s Saudi flag pattern very closely. The state of Hejaz followed the patterns seen in countries like Palestine and Sudan. Caliphs such as Rashiduns, Umayyads and Abbasids used different colors, inscriptions and symbols. After the Siege of Baghdad in 1258, the primary caliphate became the Mamluk Sultanate. In 1517, the Ottomans invaded Egypt and inherited Hejaz and ruled it until the Arab Revolt (1916–18). From 1902 until 1921 a different Arabic inscription was used. One of the primary opponents to the Saudis was the Emirate of Jabal Shammar of the Al Rashid family in the north of the peninsula, until their defeat in 1921.
 
The Al Saud, the ruling family of Saudi Arabia, has long been closely related with Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab. He and the people who followed him, since the 18th century, had used the &quot;shahada&quot; on their flags. In 1921, Abdulaziz Abdulrahman Al-Saud, leader of the Al Saud and the future founder of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, added a sword to this flag. The design of the flag was not standardized prior to 15 March 1973 when its use became official. Variants with two swords and/or a white vertical stripe at the hoist were frequently used. By 1938, the flag had basically assumed its present form, except the sword had a different design (with a more curved blade) and it, along with the &quot;shahada&quot; above, took up more of the flag&#x27;s space.

==Royal Standard==

The Royal Standard consists of a green flag, with an Arabic inscription and a sword featured in white, and with the national emblem embroidered in gold in the lower right canton of the year 1973.

The script on the flag is written in the Thuluth script. It is the &quot;shahada&quot; or Islamic declaration of faith:
: &quot;&quot;
:&quot;There is no god but God; Muhammad is the Messenger of God&quot;



==Other flags==
The civil ensign, for use by merchant vessels at sea, is a green flag with the state flag in the canton with a white border. The royal standard is the state flag with the palm tree and swords in the canton.

<doc id="350913" wikidata="Q313972" url="?curid=350913" title="Maxwell D. Taylor">
<text>Maxwell Davenport Taylor (26 August 1901 – 19 April 1987) was a senior United States Army officer and diplomat during the Cold War. He served with distinction in World War II, most notably as commander of the 101st Airborne Division, nicknamed &quot;The Screaming Eagles.&quot;

After the war, he served as the fifth chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, having been appointed by President John F. Kennedy. He is the father of biographer and historian John Maxwell Taylor and of military historian and author Thomas Happer Taylor. A controversial figure, Taylor was considered, along with Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, to have played a major role during the early days of the Vietnam War in the decision to deploy US combat troops to Vietnam and to escalate the conflict more generally.

==Early life and career==
Taylor was born in Keytesville, Missouri, the only child of attorney John Earle Maxwell Taylor and Pearle (Davenport) Taylor. He was raised in Kansas City, graduated from Northeast High School, and attended Kansas City Polytechnic Institute. In 1918, he passed competitive examinations for Congressional appointment by William Patterson Borland to either the United States Military Academy or United States Naval Academy and then passed the Military Academy entrance examination. Taylor attended West Point, graduated fourth in the Class of 1922, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. He served in Hawaii with the 3rd Engineers from 1923 to 1926.

Taylor transferred to the Field Artillery and, from 1926 to 1927, served with the 10th Field Artillery, receiving promotion to first lieutenant. Having demonstrated a facility for foreign languages, he studied French in Paris and was then assigned to West Point as an instructor in French and Spanish. He graduated from the Field Artillery School in 1933, and he completed the course at the United States Army Command and General Staff College in 1935.

Taylor was promoted to captain in August 1935 and served at the American embassy in Tokyo from 1935 to 1939, including attaché duty in China in 1937. He graduated from the United States Army War College in 1940 and was promoted to major in July 1940.

==World War II==
===Early assignments===
Taylor served on the War Plans Division staff in 1940 and took part in a defense cooperation mission to Latin American countries. He commanded the 1st Battalion of the 12th Field Artillery Regiment from 1940 to 1941, and then served in the Office of the Secretary of the General Staff until 1942. He received temporary promotions to lieutenant colonel in December 1941, colonel in February 1942, and brigadier general in December 1942.

===Combat in Sicily and Italy===
In July 1942, Taylor became chief of staff of the 82nd Infantry Division, a position he held from July until October, by which time the division had been converted into the 82nd Airborne Division. This was followed in November when he was placed in command of the 82nd Airborne Division Artillery and received a promotion to the temporary rank of brigadier general in December. In this role he took part in combat in Sicily and Italy. In the late summer of 1943, during the planning for the Allied invasion of Italy, Taylor&#x27;s diplomatic and language skills resulted in his secret mission to Rome to co-ordinate an 82nd air drop with Italian forces. General Dwight D. Eisenhower, then the Supreme Allied Commander in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations, later said that &quot;the risks he ran were greater than I asked any other agent or emissary to take during the war.&quot;

Hundreds of miles behind the front lines of battle, Taylor was forced by the rules of engagement to wear his American military uniform to prevent himself, if captured, from being shot as a spy. He met with Marshal Pietro Badoglio, who had recently become Italy&#x27;s prime minister, and General Giacomo Carboni, head of Servizio Informazioni Militare, the Italian military&#x27;s intelligence agency. The air drop near Rome to capture the city was called off at the last minute since Taylor realized that German forces were already moving in to cover the intended drop zones. His efforts behind enemy lines got Taylor noticed at the highest levels of the Allied command.

===101st Airborne Division===
After the campaigns in the Mediterranean, Taylor was assigned to become the commanding general (CG) of the 101st Airborne Division, nicknamed &quot;The Screaming Eagles&quot;, which was then training in England in preparation for the Allied invasion of Normandy, after the division&#x27;s first commander, Major General William Lee, suffered a heart attack. Taylor received temporary promotion to major general in May 1944.

Taylor took part in the division&#x27;s parachute jump into Normandy on 6 June 1944 (more commonly known simply as D-Day), the first Allied general officer to land in France on D-Day. He subsequently commanded the 101st in the Battle of Normandy, including in the capture of Carentan on 13 June, and the division continued to fight in the campaign as regular infantry. The 101st Airborne Division was pulled out of the line in late June, having been in almost continuous action for nearly a month, and in early July, he returned to England to rest and refit and absorb replacements, after having suffered over 4,600 casualties.

Having been brought up to strength, Taylor led the 101st in Operation Market Garden in the Netherlands in September 1944. He was not present for the division&#x27;s action during the Siege of Bastogne as part of the Battle of the Bulge since he was attending a staff conference in the United States. The divisional artillery commander, Brigadier General Anthony McAuliffe, exercised command in his absence. Taylor called the defense of Bastogne the 101st Airborne Division&#x27;s &quot;finest hour&quot; of the war and stated that his absence was one of his greatest disappointments of the war. After Bastogne, Taylor&#x27;s 101st saw little further service in the war and was sent to the United States in late 1945, where it was deactivated in November.

==Post-World War II==

On 4 September 1945, Taylor became superintendent of the United States Military Academy. In 1947, he drafted the first official Honor Code publication marking the beginning of the written &quot;Cadet Honor Code&quot; at West Point. He was succeeded by Bryant Moore on 28 January 1949. Afterwards he was the commander of allied troops in West Berlin from 1949 to 1951; when he left that post, he felt like a &quot;Berliner,&quot; more than a decade before John F. Kennedy gave his famous &quot;Ich bin ein Berliner&quot; speech in the city. In July 1951 he was promoted to lieutenant general and assigned as the U.S. Army Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Administration at the Pentagon.

In June 1953, he was sent to Korea, where he commanded the Eighth United States Army during the final combat operations of the Korean War. In 1955, after a brief assignment in Tokyo as military governor of Allied-occupied Japan, Taylor was appointed the Army&#x27;s Chief of Staff—becoming the first officer since 1917 to serve as Chief of Staff without seeing service during World War I—succeeding his former mentor, Matthew B. Ridgway. During his tenure, Taylor attempted to guide the service into the age of nuclear weapons by restructuring the infantry division into a Pentomic formation. Observers such as Colonel David Hackworth have written that the effort gutted the role of US Army company and field grade officers, rendering it unable to adapt to the dynamics of combat in Vietnam.

During 1957, President Dwight D. Eisenhower ordered Taylor to deploy 1,000 troops from the 101st Airborne Division to Little Rock, Arkansas to enforce federal court orders to desegregate Central High School during the Little Rock Crisis.

As Army Chief of Staff, Taylor was an outspoken critic of the Eisenhower administration&#x27;s &quot;New Look&quot; defense policy, which he viewed as dangerously overreliant on nuclear arms and neglectful of conventional forces; Taylor also criticized the inadequacies of the Joint Chiefs of Staff system. Frustrated with the administration&#x27;s failure to heed his arguments, Taylor retired from active service in July 1959. He campaigned publicly against the &quot;New Look,&quot; culminating in the publication in January 1960 of a highly critical book, &quot;The Uncertain Trumpet&quot;.

==Return to active duty==

As the 1960 presidential campaign unfolded, Democratic nominee John F. Kennedy criticized Eisenhower&#x27;s defense policy and championed a muscular &quot;flexible response&quot; policy intentionally aligned with Taylor&#x27;s views as described in &quot;The Uncertain Trumpet&quot;. After the April 1961 failure of the Bay of Pigs Invasion, Kennedy, who felt the Joint Chiefs of Staff had failed to provide him with satisfactory military advice, appointed Taylor to head a task force to investigate the failure of the invasion.

Both President Kennedy and his brother, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, had immense regard for Taylor, whom they saw as a man of unquestionable integrity, sincerity, intelligence, and diplomacy. The Cuba Study Group met for six weeks from April to May 1961 to perform an &quot;autopsy&quot; on the disastrous events surrounding the Bay of Pigs Invasion. In the course of their work together, Taylor developed a deep regard and a personal affection for Robert F. Kennedy, a friendship that was wholly mutual and which remained firm until RFK&#x27;s assassination in 1968.

Taylor spoke of Robert Kennedy glowingly: &quot;He is always on the lookout for a &#x27;snow job,&#x27; impatient with evasion and imprecision, and relentless in his determination to get at the truth.&quot; In January, 1965 Robert Kennedy named his next-to-last son Matthew Maxwell Taylor Kennedy (better known as an adult as &quot;Max&quot;).

Shortly after the investigation concluded, the Kennedys&#x27; warm feelings for Taylor and the President&#x27;s lack of confidence in the Joint Chiefs of Staff led John Kennedy to recall Taylor to active duty and install him in the newly created post of military representative to the president. His close personal relationship with the President and White House access effectively made Taylor the President&#x27;s primary military adviser, cutting out the Joint Chiefs. On 1 October 1962, Kennedy ended this uncomfortable arrangement by appointing Taylor as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a position in which he served until 1964.

==Vietnam War==

Taylor was of crucial importance during the first few years of the Vietnam War, during his time as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and later being appointed Ambassador to the Republic of Vietnam. Whereas Kennedy told Taylor in October 1961 that &quot;the independence of South Vietnam rests with the people and government of that country&quot;, Taylor soon recommended that 8,000 American combat troops be sent to the region at once. After making his report to the Cabinet and the Chiefs of Staff (with Deputy National Security Adviser Walt Rostow), Taylor reflected on the decision to send troops to South Vietnam: &quot;I don&#x27;t recall anyone who was strongly against, except one man, and that was the President. The President just didn&#x27;t want to be convinced that this was the right thing to do... It was really the President&#x27;s personal conviction that U.S. ground troops shouldn&#x27;t go in.&quot;

In May 1963, mass protests and civil disobedience broke out in South Vietnam in response to President Ngo Dinh Diem&#x27;s persecution of the Buddhist majority, which was met with military crackdowns, culminating in nationwide raids on Buddhist temples. In the wake of the raids, the US sent out Cable 243, which called for Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. to lobby for the removal from influence of Diem&#x27;s younger brother and chief political adviser Ngo Dinh Nhu, and to look for alternative leadership options if Diem refused. As it was known that Diem would never sideline Nhu, it was effectively an authorisation for Lodge to encourage a military coup. The cable was prepared and sent out over a weekend when many leading Washington figures were away, under the misunderstanding that higher authorisation had been given. Marine General Victor Krulak signed off on behalf of the military without showing Taylor, who was a supporter of Diem. On Monday, 26 August, at the White House, Kennedy was met with angry comments by Secretary of State Dean Rusk, Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara, CIA Director John McCone and Taylor, all of whom denied authorizing the cable. Kennedy was reported to have said &quot;My God! My government&#x27;s coming apart.&quot; Taylor felt insulted by the final line of the cable which asserted that only the &quot;minimum essential people&quot; had seen its contents. During the acrimonious exchange, he condemned the cable as an &quot;egregious end run&quot; by an anti-Diem faction. Roger Hilsman rebutted Taylor by asserting that Kennedy and representatives of departments and agencies had approved the message. Years afterward, Taylor declared &quot;The anti-Diem group centered in State [department] had taken advantage of the absence of the principal officials to get out instructions which would never have been approved as written under normal circumstances&quot;. Taylor claimed that the message was reflective of Forrestal and Hilsman&#x27;s &quot;well-known compulsion&quot; to remove Diem. He accused them of pulling &quot;a fast one&quot;. Kennedy asked his advisers if they wanted to retract the cable, but they agreed to stand by the original decision to maintain consistency. Taylor said that &quot;You can&#x27;t change American policy in twenty-four hours and expect anyone to ever believe you again.&quot; Taylor also objected to two phone calls on 24 August to Washington from Admiral Harry D. Felt, the commander of US forces in the Pacific, calling for backing to the generals to remove Nhu. Felt said that the mid-level officers would not fight if Nhu was not removed. Taylor became angry that Felt had advised the State Department to move against Diem without first consulting the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Taylor then told Kennedy that Americans would not tolerate their officers selecting the president, and thus they should not usurp the cabinet in doing the same in South Vietnam.

Taylor remained opposed to any moves towards the disposal of Diem. Years afterward, he said that Diem was &quot;a terrible pain in the neck&quot;, but was a devoted servant of his country. Taylor called on Kennedy to support Diem until a better leader had been lined up, pointing out that the officers were divided and therefore could not be relied on to plot and stage a coup.

The junta led by General Duong Van Minh following Diem&#x27;s removal lasted three months until General Nguyen Khanh toppled Minh in January 1964. Taylor and other military officials had disagreed with Minh&#x27;s reluctance to carry out large-scale offensives against the communists and wanted a more aggressive approach. He was known to regard Khanh as the more competent ARVN general. However, Taylor changed his opinion upon being made Ambassador to South Vietnam in July 1964 when Lodge returned to the US.

In August, following widespread Buddhist protests, some senior officers, particularly the Catholic Generals Tran Thien Khiem and Nguyễn Văn Thiệu, decried Khanh&#x27;s concessions to the Buddhists. They plotted Khánh&#x27;s removal and sought out Taylor for a private endorsement, but Taylor did not want any more leadership changes, fearing a corrosive effect on the already-unstable government. This deterred Khiêm&#x27;s group from acting on their plans. On 13 September, another coup attempt led by Catholic Generals Duong Van Duc and Lam Van Phat started while Taylor was on a flight from the US—back to Saigon and catching him off-guard. The coup failed, and Taylor helped organize for Khiêm to be made Saigon&#x27;s representative in Washington. During the coup, Minh had remained silent, angering Khánh and keeping their long-running rivalry going. By the end of October, the Johnson administration had become more supportive of Taylor&#x27;s negative opinion of Minh and eventually paid for Minh to go on a &quot;good will tour&quot; to remove him from the political scene.

Taylor frequently clashed with General Nguyen Khanh and helped to engineer his removal, having supported Khanh&#x27;s deposal of General Duong Van Minh.

==Criticisms==
Taylor received fierce criticism in Major (later Lieutenant General and National Security Advisor) H.R. McMaster&#x27;s book &quot;Dereliction of Duty.&quot; Specifically, Taylor was accused of intentionally misrepresenting the views of the Joint Chiefs to Defense Secretary Robert McNamara and of cutting the Joint Chiefs out of the decision-making process.

Whereas the Chiefs felt that it was their duty to offer unbiased assessments and recommendations on military matters, Taylor was of the firm belief that the chairman should not only support the president&#x27;s decisions but also be a true believer in them. That discrepancy manifested itself during the early planning phases of the war while it was still being decided what the nature of American involvement should be. McNamara and the civilians of the office of the secretary of defense were firmly behind the idea of graduated pressure: to escalate pressure slowly against North Vietnam in order to demonstrate U.S. resolve. The Joint Chiefs, however, strenuously disagreed with that and believed that if the US got involved further in Vietnam, it should be with the clear intention of winning and through the use of overwhelming force. McMaster contends that using a variety of political maneuvering, including liberal use of outright deception, Taylor succeeded in keeping the Joint Chiefs&#x27; opinions away from the President and helped set the stage for McNamara to begin to dominate systematically the U.S. decision-making process on Vietnam.

Taylor was also criticized by Tom Ricks in his book &quot;The Generals&quot; (2012): &quot;Maxwell Taylor arguably was the most destructive general in American history. As Army chief of staff in the 1950s, he steered the US military toward engaging in &#x27;brushfire wars.&#x27; As White House military adviser during the early 1960s, he encouraged President John F. Kennedy to deepen American involvement in Vietnam. As chairman of the Joint Chiefs, he poisoned relations between the military and civilian leadership. He was also key in picking Gen. William Westmoreland to command the war there.&quot;

==Second retirement==
Taylor again retired from the Army on 1 July 1964, having been succeeded as Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff by General Earle Wheeler, and became Ambassador to South Vietnam from 1964 to 1965, succeeding Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. Taylor served in the Pentagon during parts of 1965 as &quot;SACSA&quot;, the Special Advisor for Counterinsurgency Affairs&quot;. He was Special Consultant to the President and Chairman of the Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (1965–1969) and President of the Institute for Defense Analyses (1966–1969).

Afflicted with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (also called &quot;Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease&quot;), Taylor spent his last three months at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, DC, and died at 85 years of age on April 19, 1987. He was interred at Arlington National Cemetery.

==Personal life==
In 1925, Taylor married the former Lydia Gardner Happer (1901–1997). They had two sons: John Maxwell Taylor and Thomas Happer Taylor, the latter being a West Point graduate (Class of 1960) and Army officer.

<text>Chromaticity is an objective specification of the quality of a color regardless of its luminance. Chromaticity consists of two independent parameters, often specified as &quot;hue&quot; (&quot;h&quot;) and &quot;colorfulness&quot; (&quot;s&quot;), where the latter is alternatively called &quot;saturation&quot;, &quot;chroma&quot;, &quot;intensity&quot;, or &quot;excitation purity&quot;. This number of parameters follows from trichromacy of vision of most humans, which is assumed by most models in color science.

==Quantitative description==
In color science, the white point of an illuminant or of a display is a neutral reference characterized by a chromaticity; all other chromaticities may be defined in relation to this reference using polar coordinates. The &quot;hue&quot; is the angular component, and the &quot;purity&quot; is the radial component, normalized by the maximum radius for that hue.

&quot;Purity&quot; is roughly equivalent to the term &quot;saturation&quot; in the HSV color model. The property &quot;hue&quot; is as used in general color theory and in specific color models such as HSL and HSV color spaces, though it is more perceptually uniform in color models such as Munsell, CIELAB or CIECAM02.

Some color spaces separate the three dimensions of color into one luminance dimension and a pair of chromaticity dimensions. For example, the white point of an sRGB display is an ,  chromaticity of (0.3127, 0.3290), where and coordinates are used in the xyY space.

These pairs determine a chromaticity as affine coordinates on a triangle in a 2D-space, which contains all possible chromaticities. These and are used because of simplicity of expression in CIE 1931 (see below) and have no inherent advantage. Other coordinate systems on the same X-Y-Z triangle, or other color triangles, can be used.

On the other hand, some color spaces such as RGB and XYZ do not separate out chromaticity, but chromaticity is defined by a mapping that normalizes out intensity, and its coordinates, such as and or and , can be calculated through the division operation, such as  , and so on.

The xyY space is a cross between the CIE XYZ and its normalized chromaticity coordinates xyz, such that the luminance Y is preserved and augmented with just the required two chromaticity dimensions.

<doc id="350918" wikidata="Q5528298" url="?curid=350918" title="Gavin Wanganeen">
<text>Gavin Adrian Wanganeen (born 18 June 1973) is a former Australian rules footballer who played for the Essendon Football Club and Port Adelaide Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL), and also for the Port Adelaide Magpies in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL).

A Brownlow Medal winner and Australian Football Hall of Fame inductee, Wanganeen was appointed Port Adelaide&#x27;s inaugural captain upon entry into the AFL in 1997 and is the first Indigenous Australian footballer to win the Brownlow Medal and reach the 300-game milestone at senior VFL/AFL level. Since retirement, Wanganeen has taken up painting. He is a descendant of the Kokatha people, a Western Desert people of South Australia, an inheritance he has explored in his art work since retirement. He has had two solo exhibitions and was an ambassador for the Adelaide Fringe in 2019.

==Early life==
Wanganeen was born in Mount Gambier to a footballing family: his great-grandfather had played for the local team, Koonibba Football Club, at the Koonibba mission near Ceduna. 

His family moved from Mount Gambier to Port Lincoln for a few years. When Wanganeen was five, they moved again to Salisbury, a northern suburb of Adelaide.

Wanganeen played junior football for Adelaide based South Australian Amateur Football League club Salisbury North and attended Salisbury East High School.

At the age of 14, Wanganeen joined the Port Adelaide Under 17s side in the SANFL.

== Football career ==

=== Port Adelaide: 1990 ===
Wanganeen made his senior SANFL debut with Port Adelaide in 1990 at only 16 years of age. The 1990 SANFL season was the last year that the competition was the highest level of football in South Australia. He played 24 matches and kicked 46 goals, winning the SANFL Rookie of the Year award, starring in Port Adelaide&#x27;s 1990 SANFL Grand Final win kicking two goals.

===Essendon: 1991–1996===
Wanganeen&#x27;s potential was identified early by Essendon, and after losing another South Australian star, Craig Bradley, to Carlton, Bombers coach Kevin Sheedy was determined to secure Wanganeen. As he recalled in an interview for &quot;The Football Record&quot;: 

We always knew he was an exciting talent. We had spotted him very early and watched his progress through the Port Adelaide Reserves to the seniors and knew he would make the grade at AFL level. A lot of people told us he would not shift from Adelaide, but I suppose that only made us all the more determined to get him across. 

After doing a deal with Melbourne, Essendon secured Wanganeen with Pick number 12 in the 1989 VFL Draft. Wanganeen debuted for the club in 1991, Round 2 in a win against Richmond. He immediately finding a niche as an attacking defender, and his handsome appearance made him popular with female supporters. 

Essendon came from the clouds in 1993 to win their 15th VFL/AFL premiership with a team that became known as the &#x27;Baby Bombers&#x27;. Wanganeen enjoyed a special year individually, with his fearless attacking approach from defence typical of Essendon&#x27;s play that season. He would end up winning the first of his five All-Australian jumpers, then followed by winning the 1993 Brownlow Medal, polling 18 votes (which included four counts of three votes late in the season) to edge out Carlton&#x27;s Greg Williams (who would win his second Brownlow the following season), and North Melbourne&#x27;s Wayne Carey. At 20 years of age, Wanganeen was the youngest winner of the League&#x27;s best and fairest award since Fitzroy&#x27;s Denis Ryan in 1936.

He was also a key player in South Australia&#x27;s State of Origin Carnival Championship, and Essendon&#x27;s Premiership win that year. In 2002, Wanganeen was voted the 19th best Essendon player of all time in the &quot;Champions of Essendon&quot; list.

===Port Adelaide return: 1997–2006===
Wanganeen returned to Port Adelaide in 1997 as the club&#x27;s 59th captain and its inaugural captain in the AFL. He received 11 Brownlow votes for the year, but after his first season injuries conspired to minimise his impact. He relinquished the Port Adelaide captaincy at the end of the 2000 AFL season which saw a return to his best form. In 2003 Wanganeen was favourite to once again win the Brownlow (he finished equal second). In 2004 Wanganeen won his second premiership medal in Port&#x27;s first AFL premiership side. Wanganeen played his 300th AFL game in the 2006 season, but then injured his right knee in an SANFL game for the Port Adelaide Magpies, which led him to retire from football. Wanganeen was the first Aboriginal player to play 300 AFL games. He was honoured by the Power by the naming of the best under 21 medal after him, the Gavin Wanganeen Medal.

==After football==
In 2013, Wanganeen was focused on business interests involving ownership of three Anytime Fitness centres at Modbury, Port Adelaide and Essendon.

He served as a voluntary ambassador for the Australian branch of the White Ribbon Campaign, a men&#x27;s campaign that tackles violence against women, and participated in the 2013 &quot;Cycling for Culture&quot; event to draw attention to the importance of language and culture to Aboriginal well-being, specifically to attract funds to contributing to the further development of the Kaurna language.

In 2013, Wanganeen was appointed senior coach of Pulteney Grammar School&#x27;s football team.

In 2021, Wanganeen competed on &quot;Australian Survivor: Brains V Brawn&quot; as part of the Brawn tribe. After his tribe lost the immunity challenge on day 7, Wanganeen got voted out, being the third person voted out and placing 22nd.

In May 2023, it was announced that Wanganeen would be participating in the twentieth series of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. He was paired with Megan Wragg.

==Art==
Wanganeen found a new passion following the closure of his football career and has become an accomplished visual artist, with two solo exhibitions by 2018 and much of his artwork decorating his home in suburban Adelaide.

In February 2019, Wanganeen was appointed one of three Fringe Ambassadors for the Adelaide Fringe, where he appeared in conversation with Holly Ransom for the &quot;Fringe Talk Show&quot;.

His second exhibition, &quot;Through the Stars&quot;, was part of the South Australian Living Artists Festival in Adelaide.

==Other==
The Gavin Wanganeen Indigenous Scholarship (GWIS) was established at the University of South Australia in 2005 to support disadvantaged Indigenous students to complete a university degree.

The Gavin Wanganeen Medal, for the Best player under 21, was instituted at PAFC in 2006.

==Personal life==
Wanganeen is married to Pippa Hanson. The couple wed in July 2012 and have four daughters together, Kitty, Lulu, Posey and Plum.

Wanganeen also has a daughter Mia, and a son Tex from his previous marriage to Stephanie Richards.

Gavin’s son Tex moved to Melbourne in 2020 to board at Xavier College and play for the Oakleigh Chargers in the NAB League. He also spent time at Essendon&#x27;s father-son academy.

He is the first cousin of AFL players and brothers Aaron and Alwyn Davey, and a third cousin of Rabbit Proof Fence actress Natasha Wanganeen.

<doc id="350919" wikidata="Q2891392" url="?curid=350919" title="Long Crendon">
<text>Long Crendon is a village and civil parish in west Buckinghamshire, England, about west of Haddenham and north-west of Thame in neighbouring Oxfordshire.
The village has been called Long Crendon only since the English Civil War. The &quot;Long&quot; prefix refers to the length of the village at that time, and was added to differentiate it from nearby Grendon Underwood, which used to be known as &quot;Crendon&quot;. This name is Old English and means &#x27;Creoda&#x27;s Hill&#x27; (in 1086 it was listed in the Domesday Book as &quot;Crededone&quot;).

==History==

&quot;Crendon&quot; was the caput of the feudal honour held by Walter Giffard (died 1102), created Earl of Buckingham by William the Conqueror. The Manor in Long Crendon was once a great building that housed the later Earls of Buckingham and over the years the various manorial estates in the village have passed through the hands of the Crown, Oxford University, the Earls of March and the Marquis of Buckingham. The latter is now the Lord of the Manor of Long Crendon.

In 1162, an order of Augustinian monks was founded in the village at nearby Notley Abbey. The park in which the abbey stood was donated to the abbey itself by the incumbent of the manor, the Earl of Buckingham. At the time of the Dissolution of the Monasteries the annual income was calculated as over £437, an immense amount of money for the time. The abbey still stands, but as a secular manor house. In the 20th century it was the marital home of actors Sir Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh.


In 1218, Long Crendon was granted a royal charter to hold a weekly market; the monies from which were to be collected by William Earl Marshall who owned the manor at that time. The town (as it was then) was certainly important in this period as it shared the distinction with Aylesbury as being the only places in the whole of England where needles were made. The royal charter was later rescinded and the market moved and joined with the existing one in nearby Thame.

The Church of England parish church of St Mary dates from the 12th century. The building has undergone several major renovations and refurbishments since 2007. The village has also a Baptist church and a Catholic church.

Long Crendon Courthouse is a 15th-century timber-frame building. Manorial courts were held here from the reign of King Henry V until the Victorian era. The National Trust bought the courthouse in 1900. The lower floor is residential; the upper floor can be visited.

There was a Long Crendon Rural District from 1894 to 1934.

==Amenities==
The village has two public houses, a brewery (the XT Brewing Company), and a Village Association hall. Long Crendon School is a mixed, community school, which has about 240 pupils from the ages of four to 11.

Long Crendon has two youth football clubs. Crendon Corinthians Youth Football Club (CCYFC) has over 250 members, with 18 teams, including four girls&#x27; teams, across 11 age groups, from U6 to U18. The teams compete in three different leagues: the South Bucks Mini Soccer Conference U7-U10, the Booker Wholesale League U11–U16, and the Bucks Girls League (with U11, U13, U15 and U18 teams). The club was awarded FA Charter Standard status in 2004 and was named as the Berks &amp; Bucks FA Charter Standard Club of the Year in June 2010. Long Crendon Youth FC is also an FA Charter Standard club, and fields an U18 team, which competes in the South Bucks Youth League. Long Crendon also has a Bowls Club, established in 1921 and a separate Tennis Club. There is also a Scout Group named Bernwood Forest Group after the ancient hunting forest of Henry VIII that was in the area.

&quot;Midsomer Murders&quot;, the ITV crime series is often filmed in Long Crendon with locals as extras.. Scenes from the series &quot;Jeeves and Wooster&quot;, with Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie, were also filmed in Long Crendon.

<doc id="350922" wikidata="Q740873" url="?curid=350922" title="Rhizophoraceae">
<text>The Rhizophoraceae is a family of tropical or subtropical flowering plants. It includes around 147 species distributed in 15 genera. Under the family, there are three tribes, Rhizophoreae, Gynotrocheae, and Macarisieae. Even though Rhizophoraceae is known for its mangrove members, only the genera under Rhizophoreae grow in the mangrove habitats and the remaining members live in inland forests. 

==Taxonomy ==
This family is now placed in the order Malpighiales, though under the Cronquist system, they formed an order in themselves (Rhizophorales). It is sister group to Erythroxylaceae. The sister group to the tribe Rhizophoreae is Gynotrocheae. The generic relationships within the Macarisiae are not fully resolved.

Within the mangrove tribe Rhizophoreae, there are four genera: &quot;Rhizophora&quot;, &quot;Kandelia&quot;, &quot;Ceriops&quot;, and &quot;Bruguiera&quot;. &quot;Bruguiera&quot; is the basal genus and &quot;Rhizophora&quot; the most derived genus in the tribe. &quot;Rhizophora&quot; is the only pan-tropical genus that is distributed along the intertidal zones of both the Indo-West Pacific (IWP) and Atlantic-East Pacific (AEP) regions. The remaining mangrove genera are restricted to the IWP region.

== Genera ==
, Plants of the World Online accepted these genera:
* &quot;Anopyxis&quot; 
* &quot;Blepharistemma&quot; 
* &quot;Bruguiera&quot; 
* &quot;Carallia&quot; 
* &quot;Cassipourea&quot; 
* &quot;Ceriops&quot; 
* &quot;Comiphyton&quot; 
* &quot;Crossostylis&quot; 
* &quot;Gynotroches&quot; 
* &quot;Kandelia&quot; 
* &quot;Macarisia&quot; 
* &quot;Paradrypetes&quot; 
* &quot;Pellacalyx&quot; 
* &quot;Rhizophora&quot; 
* &quot;Sterigmapetalum&quot; 

== Morphological Characteristics ==
The tribe Macarisieae is characterized by a few plesiomorphies unknown in the rest of the family, such as superior ovary position, the presence of a seed appendage, and the absence of aerial roots. 

Within Gynotrocheae, &quot;Crossostylis&quot; is morphologically distinct from other Gynotrocheae in having capsular fruits that split open at maturity and an appendage on a mature seed. In addition, &quot;Crossostylis&quot; possesses a multi-celled archesporium in ovules just like members in Macarisieae, while the archesporium is one-celled in the other Gynotrocheae.

Among Rhizophoreae, there are three distinctive characters known as the adaptive features to the mangrove habitats: viviparous embryogenesis, high salt tolerance and aerial roots. 

Vivipary: The embryo of Rhizophoreae starts germination without dormancy. It grows out of the seed coat and the fruit while still remain attached to the parent plant. Although vivipary is found in other unrelated mangrove taxa such as &quot;Avicennia&quot; (Acanthaceae), &quot;Nypa&quot; (Arecaceae), and &quot;Pelliciera&quot; (Tetrameristaceae), they only break the seed coat but not the fruit wall before they split open. Vivipary in Rhizophoreae include several embryological characteristics: (1) the active growth of a hypocotyl meristem in the cotyledonary body, with endosperm overflow from the embryo sac. The growth of an endosperm can force open the micropyle, so that the embryo develops out of the integument. 2) The development of cotyledons as a cylindrical body. (3) The development of just one embryo, with other ovules being aborted after anthesis.

Wood anatomy: Rhizophoreae possess narrow and dense vessels. These wood structures keep the xylem sap in high tension to absorb water, resulting in a high sodium chloride concentration and high osmatic potential. Terrestrial species in Rhizophoreae could not survive in the intertidal zone because the osmatic potential in the sea water would be much higher than that in the xylem sap of the tree, resulting in water loss and disruption of cellular functions.

Aerial roots: Instead of having tap roots deep underground, Rhizophoreae develop roots that branch out from the stem some distance above the soil surface. Underground roots, like all plant tissues, require oxygen for respiration. In underground soils of terrestrial habitats, gas exchanges take place at the interstitial pores among the soil particles. In waterlogged soils, the diffusion rate of oxygen is extremely low. Rhizophoreae adapts to the anaerobic soils by having extensive roots above the ground which increases the surface area for gas exchanges. The surface of aerial roots carry numerous gas exchange pores called lenticels, through which oxygen could diffuse into the underground tissues with air-filled spaces.

== Evolutionary history ==
The ancestor of Rhizophoraceae experienced two whole genome duplication events. The first duplication event corresponds to the triplication shared among angiosperms. The second duplication event was dated to ~74.6 million years ago (mya). Around 66 mya, the planet underwent the Cretaceous–Tertiary mass extinction. Then around 56.4 mya, the mangrove lineage diverged from its terrestrial relatives. The divergence happened to occur in the time frame with in the extreme global warming event, the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). During this time period, there is a shift from a terrestrial to a marine, potentially anoxic, sedimentary depositional environment, suggesting a sea level rise. After the dramatic global warming period, the mangrove species within Rhizophoraceae diversified within 10 mya, which is relatively short in evolutionary sense. Although the sequence of the events does not suggest an absolute causal relationships between the former and the latter, a reasonable hypothesis for the diversification of Rhizophoraceae could be formulated: The second event of whole genome duplication increased the adaptability of the ancestor of Rhizophoraceae and chances of survival during the Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction by generating novel genetic materials for evolution to work on. During the PETM global warming period, the terrestrial ancestors of Rhizophoraceae living close to the shore were forced into the intertidal zone because of a large-scale sea-level rise. This sea level change exerted some selective pressure on the ancestors of Rhizophoraceae and those that were successfully adapted to the intertidal zone diverged from their terrestrial relatives and colonized this new habitat. Eventually, differential habitats within the intertidal zone resulted in the speciation within the mangrove lineage of Rhizophoraceae.

<text>Adam Roy Goodes (born 8 January 1980) is a former professional Australian rules footballer who played for the Sydney Swans in the Australian Football League (AFL). Goodes holds an elite place in VFL/AFL history as a dual Brownlow Medallist, dual premiership player, four-time All-Australian, member of the Indigenous Team of the Century and representative of Australia in the International Rules Series. In addition, he has held the record for the most VFL/AFL games played by an Indigenous player, surpassing Andrew McLeod&#x27;s record of 340 during the 2014 AFL season before having his own record surpassed by Shaun Burgoyne during the 2019 AFL season.

Known for his community work and anti-racism advocacy, Goodes was named the Australian of the Year in 2014. From 2013, his outspokenness on racial issues contributed to his being the target of a sustained booing campaign from opposition fans, causing him to take indefinite leave from the AFL and eventually retire from the game at the end of the 2015 season. The &quot;booing saga&quot; sparked a national debate about racism in Australia and became the subject of two documentary films, both released in 2019. That year, the AFL formally apologised to Goodes for not taking greater action to defend him against fan abuse.

==Early life and family==
Goodes was born in Wallaroo, South Australia to Lisa May and Graham Goodes, with siblings Jake and Brett. Goodes&#x27; father is of English, Irish and Scottish ancestry; his mother is an Aboriginal Australian (Adnyamathanha and Narungga), and is one of the Stolen Generation.

Goodes&#x27; parents were separated when he was four; his father moved to Mackay, Queensland while Goodes moved between Wallaroo and Adelaide (in South Australia) and Merbein (in Victoria) with his mother.

Goodes preferred soccer as a boy, playing in South Australia. While at Merbein, he attended primary school at Merbein West Primary School in 1986 and it was there that he began to play Australian rules football as there was no soccer club for him to join. He moved with his family to Horsham, Victoria, where he played football at high school and represented at under-16 and under-18 levels. At age 16, he began playing with the North Ballarat Rebels in the TAC Cup. Goodes played in a winning premiership side with the Rebels, where he was scouted by the Sydney Swans.

Goodes took his mother to the Brownlow Medal ceremony in 2003.

Brett, who is 4 years younger than Adam, played 22 AFL games for the Western Bulldogs between 2013 and 2015.

==AFL career==
===Early career===
Goodes was drafted by Sydney into the Australian Football League as the 43rd pick in the 1997 AFL Draft, Sydney&#x27;s third round draft pick. He spent the 1998 season in the reserves competition, but broke into the first team the following year and went on to win the league&#x27;s Rising Star Award.

During 2000 and 2001, Goodes played in a variety of positions, developing his game but lacking consistency at times. He played every game during this period. In early 2002, however, his form had slumped and it had been suggested that he may be dropped. However, coach Rodney Eade resigned mid-season and under interim (later permanent) coach Paul Roos, Goodes found himself playing more in the ruck. In the second half of that season his form improved immensely. After injuring his knee twice in the ruck, he moved to play on the wing and went on to win two Brownlow Medals.

===2003−2007: Brownlow Medal success===
In 2003, Goodes returned to the ruck position for significant parts of the year in what became his best season to that point. He played a critical role in the Swans&#x27; revival and eventual preliminary final game that year. In particular, his efforts were crucial in the Swans&#x27; win against Port Adelaide in the qualifying finals.

At the end of the season, Goodes won the club&#x27;s best and fairest award (the Bob Skilton Medal) and received All-Australian selection for the first time. However, his greatest achievement was winning the league&#x27;s highest personal honour, the Brownlow Medal, alongside Collingwood&#x27;s Nathan Buckley and Adelaide&#x27;s Mark Ricciuto. This was the second time in the history of the medal that the award was shared between three players (the first time was in 1930). Goodes attributed his success to his longtime mentor John Winter.

Goodes had an indifferent 2004, much like his team, who only managed the semi-finals stage of the finals series. He did not repeat his efforts of 2003, mainly due to knee injuries, yet he still managed to play every game. The knee injuries were due to an awkward fall during the season while playing in the ruck against the West Coast Eagles. Many expected Goodes to have suffered a posterior or anterior knee ligament damage, but he battled on. After this injury, coach Roos announced that Goodes&#x27; rucking days were over and that he would be used in other positions. He played in the backline for the remainder of 2004.

Goodes returned to form in 2005, playing mainly in the midfield. His year was highlighted with a near match-winning 33 disposals in round 18 against the Adelaide Crows. He played well in the 2005 Grand Final, kicked a goal and gathering 20 possessions as the Swans won their first premiership since 1933. He was also awarded life membership of the Swans after playing his 150th game during the year.
In Round 7, 2006, Goodes played his 150th consecutive match, a notable effort with the injuries he had in 2004. By the end of the 2007 season, he had played 191 consecutive matches. He returned to the ruck position in 2005 and 2006, but only occasionally around the ground and not at centre bounces where his knee injury occurred.

In 2006 Goodes had another notable year and again won the Brownlow Medal. He came into the count as a heavy favourite and became the twelfth player to have won two or more Brownlow Medals, the first Aboriginal Australian to win two, and the first player to win two with a non-Victorian club. Goodes said of his performance, &quot;I&#x27;d like to think with another couple of years in the midfield I could improve again.&quot;. Goodes had a poor performance in the first half of the 2006 Grand Final against the West Coast Eagles in a repeat of 2005. However, he turned on the heat in the second half with his team coming close (losing by one point).

At the end of the year he was once again selected in the All-Australian team.

===2007–2011===
Seasons 2007 and 2008 saw Goodes drop off in form but he was still instrumental in Sydney&#x27;s finals campaigns. He had Brownlow Medal-threatening suspensions and charges during both years. In 2008 he missed games either through suspension or injury for the first time since 2000. His 2007 season ended strongly for him as he received 16 of a possible 18 Brownlow Medal votes in the last six games of the year.

Goodes played his 250th game in 2009, against Geelong. He was arguably one of the best players throughout the 2009 season, playing in the forward line because of Barry Hall&#x27;s mid-season departure. He finished the season with 38 goals and averaged 21 disposals. From 2006 to 2009 he received 84 Brownlow votes which equated to 21 per season, easily a winning tally in years gone by considering he had drawn 22 votes during 2003&#x27;s success. From 2007 to 2009 he played career best football in the eyes of some critics and perhaps better than 2003 or 2006 as evidenced by a career high eight goals against Fremantle in 2008 and more accurate goal kicking when in the forward 50. Goodes played some high standard football in 2009 in what was a relatively disappointing season in which the Swans finished 12th and failed to make the finals for the first time in six years. He also polled three Brownlow Medal votes in the Round 7 match against Geelong which Sydney lost by 51 points.

In 2010 Goodes averaged about 20 disposals and two goals a game, having been at the forefront of Sydney&#x27;s revival. They finished the season in fifth position. Having started the season at centre half-forward and providing a target inside 50 for much of the year, Goodes was shifted into the midfield with success. He finished sixth in the Bob Skilton Medal and was named in the initial 40 player All-Australian squad but not in the final side. He was also named captain of the International Rules squad to play in Ireland in October.

After a strong 2009 season and an occasional move to half-forward, Goodes was selected last but managed to sneak into the 2009 All-Australian team on the interchange bench.

Goodes started 2011 playing mostly in the Swans&#x27; forward line. While his ball-winning was considered as good as ever, his goal-kicking became somewhat inconsistent. In a match against that season, Goodes had a chance to win the game for Sydney with his team down by two points, but his shot at goal drifted to the left, losing the game for Sydney by a solitary point.

Goodes played his 300th AFL game when the Sydney Swans tackled in a second semi-final, losing by 36 points. He became the quickest player (though not the youngest) in AFL history to reach the milestone, breaking 2003 joint-Brownlow Medalist Mark Ricciuto&#x27;s record by 274 days. His late-season surge in form saw him selected in the 2011 All-Australian team in the forward pocket. This was his fourth selection in the team.

In 2011 Goodes started as the second favourite for the Brownlow but finished eighth overall, and won the 2011 Sydney Swans&#x27; Best and Fairest, beating Josh Kennedy and Rhyce Shaw, who tied for second.

===2012−2015: Career twilight and retirement ===

Goodes broke the Sydney games record when he played his 304th AFL game with a strong contribution in the Swans&#x27; Round 5, 2012, victory over at York Park in Launceston, Tasmania. He suffered a quad injury in Round 6 and was expected to miss up to six games. Goodes played in his second premiership when Sydney defeated Hawthorn in the 2012 AFL Grand Final.

Goodes announced his retirement from the AFL after the 26-point semi-final loss to in 2015. Goodes declined an invitation to be inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame. This rejection was widely seen as an indication by Goodes that the AFL had acted insufficiently to curb racism.

==Other activities and honours==
Goodes is of Aboriginal descent and is active in the Sydney Indigenous community. He has spent time working with troubled Indigenous youth, including those in youth detention centres, along with his cousin and former teammate Michael O&#x27;Loughlin. Goodes and O&#x27;Loughlin have also helped to start an Indigenous football academy. In September 2009 they launched the Goodes O&#x27;Loughlin Foundation, a foundation aimed at empowering the next generation of Indigenous role models in all walks of life across Australia. Goodes and O&#x27;Loughlin co-chair the foundation, which focuses on education, employment and healthy lifestyles.

In 2014 he was named Australian of the Year.

In September 2017 Goodes was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Sydney for his contribution to Australian society.

A painting of Goodes by Vincent Namatjira won the 2020 Archibald Prize. It was the first win by an Indigenous artist in the almost 100-year history of the Art Prize.

Goodes was patron of the 2020 Indigenous Football Week, an event founded in 2015 by the John Moriarty Foundation, an organisation supporting young Indigenous soccer players.

On 10 October 2023, Goodes was one of 25 Australians of the Year who signed an open letter supporting the Yes vote in the Indigenous Voice referendum. The letter was initiated by psychiatrist Patrick McGorry.

===Publications===
Goodes wrote an essay entitled &quot;The Indigenous Game: A Matter of Choice&quot;, published in &quot;The Australian Game of Football Since 1858&quot; (2008). The essay concerns the Aboriginal ball game, Marngrook, and its theorised link to the origins of Australian rules football. In it, Goodes wrote: &quot;I don&#x27;t know the truth, but I believe in the connection. Because I know that when Aborigines play Australian Football with a clear mind and total focus, we are born to play it.&quot;

Appearing on &quot;The Marngrook Footy Show&quot; on NITV in a discussion about the origins of the game shortly after publication of the book, AFL historian Gillian Hibbins called Goodes a &quot;racist&quot;, adding: &quot;If you define racism as believing a race is superior in something, this is basically what he was doing.&quot; This view was challenged and criticised.

===GO Foundation===
Goodes, Michael O&#x27;Loughlin and James Gallichan founded the GO Foundation in Dareton, New South Wales, in 2011 (or earlier?), where it was involved in various community programs for the local Aboriginal population. In 2014, it started focusing on education for Indigenous Australians and established a board of directors. Founding partners include the Sydney Swans, Allens Linklaters, QBE Insurance and KPMG Australia. After starting with a few scholarships to independent schools, by 2021 GO had expanded into 26 mostly public schools as well as five universities.

==Booing saga==

On 24 May 2013, during the AFL&#x27;s annual Indigenous Round, a 13-year-old Collingwood supporter called Goodes an &quot;ape&quot;. Upon hearing the abuse, Goodes pointed the girl out to security, who ejected her from the stadium. After the game, Collingwood president Eddie McGuire apologised to Goodes on behalf of the club. McGuire said that Collingwood had a zero-tolerance policy towards racism, but also said that the girl, who later apologised to Goodes, did not know that what she had said was a racial slur. Goodes said that he was &quot;&quot; and that he had &quot;never been more hurt&quot; but nevertheless called on the community to support the girl instead of blame her. He spoke to her the following day after she phoned to apologise, saying that she had not realised how deeply it had affected him. Goodes repeated that the girl should not be blamed; the environment that she grew up in had shaped her response. The situation would be inflamed further five days later when McGuire joked on radio that Goodes would be a good person to advertise the new theatrical run of &quot;King Kong&quot;. McGuire, who came to Goodes&#x27; defence just five days prior, would claim three years later that his joke was made while on &quot;heavy-duty painkillers&quot;.

Over the following years, and particularly in 2015, Goodes was repeatedly and loudly booed by opposition fans at most matches. The motivation for, and acceptability of, the booing generated wide public debate, which dominated media coverage from both sports and political commentators for weeks at a time. The then Prime Minister of Australia, Tony Abbott, called on people to treat Goodes with &quot;civility and respect&quot;. Many considered the booing to be unacceptable and motivated by racism—either because those booing felt affronted by his race or by the strong political positions Goodes had taken on racial issues—and called on the AFL to take direct action to stop it. Others, such as commentator Sam Newman, defended the rights of fans to continue booing as a show of disapproval for Goodes&#x27; actions, including a perception that his approach in dealing with the Collingwood fan who called him an ape was heavy-handed, and for statements he had made during his time as Australian of the Year which had been seen to denigrate the history of European settlement of Australia. The booing of Goodes has also been described as a symptom of tall poppy syndrome.

The AFL Players&#x27; Association and captains showed solidarity with Goodes, releasing an open statement that included the words &quot;We encourage supporters to demonstrate zero tolerance and report any behaviour which vilifies a person on the basis of their personal characteristics, such as race, religion, gender or sexual orientation. We would encourage every other fan to follow suit.&quot;

During a match against in May 2015, again during the AFL&#x27;s annual Indigenous Round, Goodes celebrated a goal by performing an Indigenous war dance in which he mimed throwing a boomerang (though widely reported as a spear) in the direction of the Carlton cheer squad. Goodes said after the incident that the dance was based on one he learned from under-16s Indigenous team the Flying Boomerangs and that it was intended as an expression of Indigenous pride during Indigenous Round, not as a means of offending or intimidating the crowd. The &quot;symbolic act&quot; has been compared favourably to Nicky Winmar lifting his guernsey during the 1993 AFL season and Cathy Freeman running with both the Australian and Aboriginal flags at the 1994 Commonwealth Games. However, some spectators were offended by the perceived aggressive nature of the spear-throwing gesture and many considered it retaliatory against the booing he had received in previous weeks. It divided opinion among News Corp commentators, with many viewing it as inflammatory to the situation which had received particularly wide media coverage during the previous week. The booing of Goodes intensified in the months after the war dance, leading further public debate and to the Indigenous affairs minister, Nigel Scullion, calling the booers &quot;ignorant&quot;. Goodes was surprised by the attention and negative reaction to his dance and later apologised for any offence, saying that because he was depicting an &quot;Aboriginal warrior&quot; and the ceremony was a &quot;war cry&quot; it needed to be directed at the opposing team&#x27;s players.

===Departure from the game===
Owing to the stress caused by the booing and attention, Goodes took indefinite leave from the game in August of the 2015 season. Many clubs and players in the AFL supported Goodes in the week of his leave by wearing Indigenous-themed guernseys or armbands and a video was prepared by the eighteen club captains to discourage the crowd from booing. He returned the following week and played for the remainder of the season after an outpouring of support on social media; and from fans, actors, politicians, celebrities and teammates, including two spontaneous standing ovations.

Goodes retired from AFL in September 2015. He did not attend the grand final, where retiring players traditionally take part in a parade, one of only a handful of players to decline this invitation since the parade for retiring players was established.

===Apology===
In April 2019, on the eve of the premiere of one of the documentary films about the controversy and how it affected Goodes, &quot;The Final Quarter&quot;, the AFL and all of its 18 clubs, including Sydney, issued an unreserved apology for the sustained racism and events which drove Goodes out of the game. They said:Adam, who represents so much that is good and unique about our game, was subject to treatment that drove him from football. The game did not do enough to stand with him, and call it out. Failure to call out racism and not standing up for one of our own let down all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander players, past and present. Our game is about belonging. We want all Australians to feel they belong and that they have a stake in the game. We will not achieve this while racism and discrimination exists in our game... We will stand strongly with all in the football community who experience racism or discrimination. We are unified on this, and never want to see the mistakes of the past repeated.

The statement also said that the football community &quot;pledged to continue to fight all forms of racism and discrimination, on and off the field&quot;.

==In media and the arts==
===Advertising===
Goodes has made several television appearances, including in advertisements. In 2006, he appeared along with Shane Crawford in an advertisement for Campbell&#x27;s Chunky soup. In 2007, he appeared, along with teammates, in the Barry Hall series of commercials for the AFL in Sydney. In 2009, he featured in the official advertisement for the AFL, receiving the ball from Chris Judd while striding out in front of horses on a horse racing track, as well as in an advertisement for Powerade. In August 2014, his ancestry was researched and shown on the SBS TV series &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;. In 2024, he was interviewed by autistic journalism students on the ABC TV series &quot;The Assembly&quot;.

In October 2015 David Jones department stores announced the selection of Goodes as a brand ambassador. His role would include advising on matters related to indigenous reconciliation. Besides that Goodes also served as a product ambassador for Qantas; according to the airline&#x27;s online magazine &quot;Travel Insider&quot; he mentioned as having traveled to places such as New York City and East Africa.

=== Literature ===
Goodes was one of the contributors to Anita Heiss&#x27; 2018 biographical anthology &quot;Growing Up Aboriginal In Australia&quot;. His piece, &#x27;The Sporting Life&#x27;, discussed Goodes&#x27; personal experiences of being an Aboriginal Australian athlete and the importance of sport to his culture. He also documented his early years, mentioning the story of his mother of the Adnyamathanha and Narungga peoples who was a member of the Stolen Generations.

===In film===
In 2019, two documentary films addressing the controversial end to Goodes&#x27; career, as well as the wider issues of racism and national identity in Australia, were released.

&quot;The Final Quarter&quot;, by filmmaker Ian Darling, had its world premiere at the Sydney Film Festival. Goodes played no part in the making of &quot;The Final Quarter&quot; but gave it his full support after watching it. On 12 June 2019, Network 10 announced that they and the WIN Network would be airing the film.

&quot;The Australian Dream&quot;, written by Wiradjuri journalist Stan Grant, premiered at the Melbourne International Film Festival in early August 2019, and it was released in Australian cinemas on 22 August 2019.

===Art installation===
The AFL gathers biometric data on its players via a small device worn on their backs when playing. In a project taking four years, the computerised history of Goodes&#x27; performance data was transformed into an art installation commissioned by Adelaide&#x27;s MOD. (Museum of Discovery), entitled &quot;Ngapulara Ngarngarnyi Wirra&quot; (Adnyamathanha for &quot;Our Family Tree&quot;). The tree refers to a 500-year-old sacred red river gum, or &quot;wirra&quot;, that lives on Adnyamathanha land. Sounds have been created by an algorithm that mixes recordings of the wind and Goodes&#x27; voice speaking in the Adnyamathanha language with his performance data, while a 3D scan of the wirra and Goodes&#x27; data were combined in a point cloud, resembling stars in the sky. UNSW technologist Angie Abdilla and artist Baden Pailthorpe collaborated with Goodes in the Tracker Data Project, which is open to the public from February to December 2022.

<text>Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a member of a group of genetic disorders called inherited retinal dystrophy (IRD) that cause loss of vision. Symptoms include trouble seeing at night and decreasing peripheral vision (side and upper or lower visual field). As peripheral vision worsens, people may experience &quot;tunnel vision&quot;. Complete blindness is uncommon. Onset of symptoms is generally gradual and often begins in childhood.
Retinitis pigmentosa is generally inherited from one or both parents. It is caused by genetic variants in nearly 100 genes. The underlying mechanism involves the progressive loss of rod photoreceptor cells that line the retina of the eyeball. The rod cells secrete a neuroprotective substance (rod-derived cone viability factor, RdCVF) that protects the cone cells from apoptosis. When these rod cells die, this substance is no longer provided. This is generally followed by the loss of cone photoreceptor cells. Diagnosis is through eye examination of the retina finding dark pigment deposits caused by the rupture of the underlying retinal pigmented epithelial cells, given that these cells contain melanin. Other supportive testing may include the electroretinogram (ERG), visual field testing (VFT), ocular coherence tomography (OCT) and DNA testing to determine the gene responsible for a person&#x27;s particular type of RP.
There is currently no cure for retinitis pigmentosa. Efforts to manage the problem may include the use of low vision aids, portable lighting, or orientation and mobility training. Vitamin A palmitate supplements may be useful to slow progression. A visual prosthesis may be an option for people with severe symptoms.

There is only one FDA-approved gene therapy that is commercially available to RP patients with Leber congenital amaurosis type 2. It replaces the miscoded RPE65 protein that is produced within the retinal pigmented epithelium. It has been found to be effective in approximately 50% of the patients who receive the therapy. The earlier a child receives the RPE65 therapy, the better their chances are for a positive outcome. There are many other therapies being researched at this time, with the goal of being approved in the next few years.

It is estimated to affect 1 in 4,000 people.

== Signs and symptoms ==

The initial retinal degenerative symptoms of retinitis pigmentosa are characterized by decreased night vision (nyctalopia) and the loss of the mid-peripheral visual field. The rod photoreceptor cells, which are responsible for low-light vision and are orientated mainly in the retinal periphery, are the retinal processes affected first during non-syndromic (without other conditions) forms of this disease. Visual decline progresses relatively quickly to the far peripheral field, eventually extending into the central visual field as tunnel vision increases. Visual acuity and color vision can become compromised due to accompanying loss of the cone photoreceptor cells, which are responsible for color vision, visual acuity, and sight in the central visual field. The progression of disease occurs in both eyes in a similar but not identical pattern. A variety of indirect symptoms characterize retinitis pigmentosa along with the direct effects of the initial rod photoreceptor degeneration and later cone photoreceptor decline. Phenomena such as photophobia in which light is perceived as an intense glare, and photopsia, the presence of blinking, swirling or shimmering lights spontaneously occurring within the visual field, often manifest during the later stages of RP.

Findings related to RP have often been characterized in the fundus (back layer) of the eye as the &quot;ophthalmic triad&quot;. This includes the development of (1) a mottled appearance of the retina and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) that gives the same visual appearance of bone spicule patterns (but are not bone spicules), (2) a waxy yellow appearance of the optic disk, and (3) the attenuation of blood vessels in size and arterial/venous ratio as they enter and exit the optic disk of the retina and transverse it.

Non-syndromic RP (RP appears alone without other co-morbidities) usually presents a variety of the following symptoms:
* Night blindness
* Tunnel vision (due to loss of peripheral vision)
* Latticework vision (due to patchy loss of peripheral vision)
* loss of depth perception
* Photopsia (Spontaneously occurring flashes/blinking/swirling/shimmering lights)
* Photophobia (aversion to bright lights)
* Development of the appearance of melanin pigment in a bone spicule pattern in the fundus (not bone tissue)
* Slow adjustment from dark to light environments and vice versa
* Blurring of vision
* Poor color separation
* Central vision towards the end of progression, because this is a disease of the rods, and the cones are mostly responsible for central vision (macula and fovea)
* Eventual partial or total blindness. The majority of patients do not become totally blind, often retaining limited or non-functional vision.

== Causes ==
RP may be:
(1) non-syndromic, that is, it occurs alone, without any other clinical findings,
(2) syndromic, with other neurosensory disorders, developmental abnormalities, or complex clinical findings, or
(3) secondary to other systemic diseases.
* RP combined with deafness (congenital or progressive) is called Usher syndrome.
* Alport&#x27;s syndrome is associated with RP and an abnormal glomerular-basement membrane leading to nephrotic syndrome. It is inherited as X-linked dominant.
* RP combined with ophthalmoplegia, dysphagia, ataxia, and cardiac conduction defects is seen in the mitochondrial DNA disorder Kearns–Sayre syndrome (also known as Ragged Red Fiber Myopathy).
* RP combined with intellectual disability, peripheral neuropathy, acanthotic (spiked) RBCs, ataxia, steatorrhea, and absence of VLDL is seen in abetalipoproteinemia.
* RP is seen clinically in association with several other rare genetic disorders (including muscular dystrophy and chronic granulomatous disease) as part of McLeod syndrome. This is an X-linked recessive phenotype characterized by a complete absence of XK cell surface proteins, and therefore markedly reduced expression of all Kell red blood cell antigens. For transfusion purposes, these patients are considered completely incompatible with all normal and K0/K0 donors.
* RP associated with hypogonadism, and developmental delay with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern is seen with Bardet–Biedl syndrome.

Other conditions include neurosyphilis, toxoplasmosis and Refsum&#x27;s disease.

Acquired conditions resulting in ophthalmoscopic findings resembling RP include eye inflammation associated with infection in early age (rubella, syphilis, toxoplasmosis, herpesvirus), autoimmune paraneoplastic retinopathy, drug toxicity (phenothiazines and chloroquine, less commonly with thioridazine and hydroxychloroquine), diffuse unilateral subacute neuroretinitis and eye trauma. Acquired conditions may be unilateral or bilateral, and static or progressive.

=== Genetics ===
Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is one of the most common forms of inherited retinal degeneration.

There are multiple genes that code for proteins needed in the visual pathway that, when mutated, can cause the retinitis pigmentosa phenotype. Inheritance patterns of RP have been identified as autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked, and maternally (mitochondrially) acquired, and are dependent on the specific RP gene mutations present in the parental generation. Autosomal Dominant RP Type 11 (PRPF-31) can be inherited as a genotype only because of incomplete penetrance, and is thus coded for in the DNA but does not manifest the disease as a phenotype. In 1989, a mutation of the gene for rhodopsin, a pigment that plays an essential part in the visual transduction cascade enabling vision in low-light conditions, was identified. The rhodopsin gene encodes a principal protein of photoreceptor outer segments. Mutations in this gene most commonly presents as missense mutations or misfolding of the rhodopsin protein, and most frequently follow autosomal dominant inheritance patterns. Since the discovery of the rhodopsin gene, more than 100 RHO mutations have been identified, accounting for 15% of all types of retinal degeneration, and approximately 25% of autosomal dominant forms of RP.

Over 100 mutations have been reported to date in the opsin gene associated with RP since the Pro23His mutation in the intradiscal domain of the protein was first reported in 1990. These mutations are found throughout the opsin gene and are distributed along the three domains of the protein (the intradiscal, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains). One of the main biochemical causes of RP in the case of rhodopsin mutations is protein misfolding, and the disruption of molecular chaperones. The mutation of codon 23 in the rhodopsin gene, in which proline is changed to histidine, accounts for the largest fraction of rhodopsin mutations in the United States. Several other studies have reported various codon mutations associated with retinitis pigmentosa, including Thr58Arg, Pro347Leu, Pro347Ser, as well as deletion of Ile-255. In 2000, a rare mutation in codon 23 was reported causing autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa, in which proline changed to alanine. However, this study showed that the retinal dystrophy associated with this mutation was characteristically mild in presentation and course. Furthermore, there was greater preservation in electroretinography amplitudes than the more prevalent Pro23His mutation.

Autosomal recessive inheritance patterns of RP have been identified in at least 45 genes. This means that two unaffected individuals who are carriers of the same RP-inducing gene mutation in diallelic form can produce offspring with the RP phenotype. A mutation on the USH2A gene is known to cause 10-15% of a syndromic form of RP known as Usher&#x27;s Syndrome when inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion.

Mutations in four pre-mRNA splicing factors are known to cause autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa. These are PRPF3 (human PRPF3 is HPRPF3; also PRP3), PRPF8, PRPF31 and PAP1. These factors are ubiquitously expressed and it is proposed that defects in a ubiquitous factor (a protein expressed everywhere) should only cause disease in the retina because the retinal photoreceptor cells have a far greater requirement for protein processing (rhodopsin) than any other cell type.

The somatic, or X-linked inheritance patterns of RP are currently identified with the mutations of six genes, the most common occurring at specific loci in the RPGR and RP2 genes.

Types include:
== Pathophysiology ==

A variety of retinal molecular pathway defects have been matched to multiple known RP gene mutations. Mutations in the rhodopsin gene (&quot;RHO&quot;), which is responsible for the majority of autosomal-dominantly inherited RP cases, disrupts the rhodopsin protein essential for translating light into decipherable electrical signals within the phototransduction cascade of the central nervous system. Defects in the activity of this G-protein-coupled receptor are classified into distinct classes that depend on the specific folding abnormality and the resulting molecular pathway defects. The Class I mutant protein&#x27;s activity is compromised as specific point mutations in the protein-coding amino acid sequence affect the pigment protein&#x27;s transport to the outer segment of the eye, where the phototransduction cascade is localized. Additionally, the misfolding of Class II rhodopsin gene mutations disrupts the protein&#x27;s conjunction with 11-cis-retinal to induce proper chromophore formation. Additional mutants in this pigment-encoding gene affect protein stability, disrupt mRNA integrity post-translationally, and affect the activation rates of transducin and opsin optical proteins.

Additionally, animal models suggest that the retinal pigment epithelium fails to phagocytose the outer rod segment discs that have been shed, leading to an accumulation of outer rod segment debris. In mice that are homozygous recessive for retinal degeneration mutation, rod photoreceptors stop developing and undergo degeneration before cellular maturation completes. A defect in cGMP-phosphodiesterase has also been documented; this leads to toxic levels of cGMP.

Oxidative damage associated with lipid peroxidation is a potential cause of cone cell death in retinitis pigmentosa.

== Diagnosis ==

An accurate diagnosis of retinitis pigmentosa relies on the documentation of the progressive loss of photoreceptor cell function, confirmed by a combination of visual field and visual acuity tests, fundus and optical coherence imagery, and electroretinography (ERG).

Visual field and acuity tests measure and compare the size of the patient&#x27;s field of vision and the clarity of their visual perception with the standard visual measurements associated with healthy 20/20 vision. Clinical diagnostic features indicative of retinitis pigmentosa include a substantially small and progressively decreasing visual area in the visual field test, and compromised levels of clarity measured during the visual acuity test. Additionally, optical tomography such as fundus and retinal (optical coherence) imagery provide further diagnostic tools when determining an RP diagnosis. Photographing the back of the dilated eye allows the confirmation of bone spicule accumulation in the fundus, which presents during the later stages of RP retinal degeneration. Combined with cross-sectional imagery of optical coherence tomography, which provides clues into photoreceptor thickness, retinal layer morphology, and retinal pigment epithelium physiology, fundus imagery can help determine the state of RP progression.

While visual field and acuity test results combined with retinal imagery support the diagnosis of retinitis pigmentosa, additional testing is necessary to confirm other pathological features of this disease. Electroretinography (ERG) confirms the RP diagnosis by evaluating functional aspects associated with photoreceptor degeneration, and can detect physiological abnormalities before the initial manifestation of symptoms. An electrode lens is applied to the eye as photoreceptor response to varying degrees of quick light pulses is measured. Patients exhibiting the retinitis pigmentosa phenotype would show decreased or delayed electrical response in the rod photoreceptors, as well as possibly compromised cone photoreceptor cell response.

The patient&#x27;s family history is also considered when determining a diagnosis due to the genetic mode of inheritance of retinitis pigmentosa. At least 35 different genes or loci are known to cause nonsyndromic RP. Indications of the RP mutation type can be determined through DNA testing, which is available on a clinical basis for:
* (autosomal recessive, Bothnia type RP)
* (autosomal dominant, RP1)
* (autosomal dominant, RP4)
* (autosomal dominant, RP7)
* (autosomal dominant, RP13)
* (autosomal dominant, RP18)
* CRB1 (autosomal recessive, RP12)
* (autosomal recessive, RP19)
* (autosomal recessive, RP20)

For all other genes (e.g. DHDDS), molecular genetic testing is available on a research basis only.

RP can be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked or Y-linked manner. X-linked RP can be either recessive, affecting primarily only males, or dominant, affecting both males and females, although males are usually more mildly affected. Some digenic (controlled by two genes) and mitochondrial forms have also been described.

Genetic counseling depends on an accurate diagnosis, determination of the mode of inheritance in each family, and results of molecular genetic testing.

== Treatment ==

There is currently no cure for retinitis pigmentosa, but the efficacy and safety of various prospective treatments are currently being evaluated. The efficiency of various supplements, such as vitamin A, DHA, NAC, and lutein, in delaying disease progression remains an unresolved, yet prospective treatment option. Clinical trials investigating optic prosthetic devices, gene therapy mechanisms, and retinal sheet transplantations are active areas of study in the partial restoration of vision in retinitis pigmentosa patients.

=== Stalling of disease ===
Studies have demonstrated the delay of rod photoreceptor degeneration by the daily intake of 15000 IU (equivalent to 4.5 mg) of vitamin A palmitate; thus, stalling disease progression in some patients. Recent investigations have shown that proper vitamin A supplementation can postpone blindness by up to 10 years (by reducing the 10% loss pa to 8.3% pa) in some patients in certain stages of the disease.

=== Bone marrow derived stem cells (BMSC) ===
MD Stem Cells, a clinical research company using autologous bone marrow derived stem cells (BMSC) in the treatment of retinal and optic nerve disease, published results from the Retinitis Pigmentosa cohort within their ongoing NIH registered Stem Cell Ophthalmology Study II (SCOTS2) clinical trial (NCT 03011541). Outcomes were encouraging with 45.5% of eyes showing an average of 7.9 lines of improvement (40.9% LogMAR improvement over baseline) and 45.5% of eyes showing stable acuity over the follow-up. Results were statistically significant(p=0.016). Retinitis Pigmentosa continues to be treated and evaluated in the study.

=== Argus retinal prosthesis ===
The Argus retinal prosthesis became the first approved treatment for the disease in February 2011, and is currently available in Germany, France, Italy, and the UK. Interim results on 30 patients long term trials were published in 2012. The Argus II retinal implant has also received market approval in the US. The device may help adults with RP who have lost the ability to perceive shapes and movement to be more mobile and to perform day-to-day activities. In June 2013, twelve hospitals in the US announced they would soon accept consultation for patients with RP in preparation for the launch of Argus II later that year. The Alpha-IMS is a subretinal implant involving the surgical implantation of a small image-recording chip beneath the optic fovea. Measures of visual improvements from Alpha-IMS studies require the demonstration of the device&#x27;s safety before proceeding with clinical trials and granting market approval.

=== Gene therapy ===
The goal of gene therapy studies is to virally supplement retinal cells expressing mutant genes associated with the retinitis pigmentosa phenotype with healthy forms of the gene; thus, allowing the repair and proper functioning of retinal photoreceptor cells in response to the instructions associated with the inserted healthy gene. Clinical trials investigating the insertion of the healthy RPE65 gene in retinas expressing the LCA2 retinitis pigmentosa phenotype measured modest improvements in vision; however, the degradation of retinal photoreceptors continued at the disease-related rate. Likely, gene therapy may preserve remaining healthy retinal cells while failing to repair the earlier accumulation of damage in already diseased photoreceptor cells. Response to gene therapy would theoretically benefit young patients exhibiting the shortest progression of photoreceptor decline; thus, correlating to a higher possibility of cell rescue via the healthy inserted gene.

=== Drugs ===

One study at UC Berkeley found that disulfiram, a drug used to treat alcoholism in humans, had potential to partially restore vision loss in rats with retinitis pigmentosa, even during late stages of the disease. Efforts to continue research in humans is ongoing.

== Prognosis ==
The progressive nature of and lack of a definitive cure for retinitis pigmentosa contribute to the inevitably discouraging outlook for patients with this disease. While complete blindness is rare, the person&#x27;s visual acuity and visual field will continue to decline as initial rod photoreceptor and later cone photoreceptor degradation proceeds.

Studies indicate that children carrying the disease genotype benefit from presymptomatic counseling in order to prepare for the physical and social implications associated with progressive vision loss. While the psychological prognosis can be slightly alleviated with active counseling the physical implications and progression of the disease depend largely on the age of initial symptom manifestation and the rate of photoreceptor degradation, rather than access to prospective treatments. Corrective visual aids and personalized vision therapy provided by Low Vision Specialists may help patients correct slight disturbances in visual acuity and optimize their remaining visual field. Support groups, vision insurance, and lifestyle therapy are additional useful tools for those managing progressive visual decline.

== Epidemiology ==
Retinitis pigmentosa is the leading cause of inherited blindness, with approximately 1/4,000 individuals experiencing the non-syndromic form of their disease within their lifetime. It is estimated that 1.5 million people worldwide are currently affected. Early onset RP occurs within the first few years of life and is typically associated with syndromic disease forms, while late onset RP emerges from early to mid-adulthood.

Autosomal dominant and recessive forms of retinitis pigmentosa affect both male and female populations equally; however, the less frequent X-linked form of the disease affects male recipients of the X-linked mutation, while females usually remain unaffected carriers of the RP trait. The X-linked forms of the disease are considered severe, and typically lead to complete blindness during later stages. In rare occasions, a dominant form of the X-linked gene mutation will affect both males and females equally.

Due to the genetic inheritance patterns of RP, many isolate populations exhibit higher disease frequencies or increased prevalence of a specific RP mutation. Pre-existing or emerging mutations that contribute to rod photoreceptor degeneration in retinitis pigmentosa are passed down through familial lines; thus, allowing certain RP cases to be concentrated to specific geographical regions with an ancestral history of the disease. Several hereditary studies have been performed to determine the varying prevalence rates in Maine (USA), Birmingham (England), Switzerland (affects 1/7000), Denmark (affects 1/2500), and Norway. Navajo Indians display an elevated rate of RP inheritance as well, which is estimated as affecting 1 in 1878 individuals. Despite the increased frequency of RP within specific familial lines, the disease is considered non-discriminatory and tends to equally affect all world populations.

== Research ==
Future treatments may involve retinal transplants, artificial retinal implants, gene therapy, stem cells, nutritional supplements, and/or drug therapies.

2012: Scientists at the University of Miami Bascom Palmer Eye Institute presented data showing protection of photoreceptors in an animal model when eyes were injected with mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF). Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley were able to restore vision to blind mice by exploiting a &quot;photoswitch&quot; that activates retinal ganglion cells in animals with damaged rod and cone cells.

2015: A study by Bakondi et al. at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center showed that CRISPR/Cas9 can be used to treat rats with the autosomal dominant form of retinitis pigmentosa. Researchers find that two molecules, rod-derived cone viability factor (RdCVF) and Nrf2, can protect cone photoreceptors in mouse models of retinitis pigmentosa.

2016: RetroSense Therapeutics aimed to inject viruses with DNA from light-sensitive algae into the eyes of several blind people (who have retinitis pigmentosa). If successful, they will be able to see in black and white.

In 2017 the FDA approved the gene therapy voretigene neparvovec to treat people with biallelic RPE65 mutation-associated retinal dystrophy.

In 2020, a literature review estimated the experimental therapeutic technique called transcorneal electrical stimulation as &quot;probably effective&quot; (level B) in retinitis pigmentosa, based on the evidence available at that time.

In 2021 an optogenetics application of the protein Channelrhodopsin in a human patient was reported with partial recovery of non-functional vision in a series of one patient only. They did not use standard protocol to measure visual improvement, but created their own criteria. The serendipitous discovery of the novel algal channelrhodopsin used came out of the 1000 Plant Genomes Project.

<doc id="350927" wikidata="Q1367604" url="?curid=350927" title="Rognvald Eysteinsson">
<text>Rognvald Eysteinsson () was the founding Jarl (or Earl) of Møre in Norway, and a close relative and ally of Harald Fairhair, the earliest known King of Norway. In the Norse language he is known as Rǫgnvaldr Eysteinsson (&quot;Mǿrajarl&quot;) and in modern Norwegian as Ragnvald Mørejarl. He is sometimes referred to with bynames that may be translated into modern English as &quot;Rognvald the Wise&quot; or &quot;Rognvald the Powerful&quot;.

The earliest available sources regarding Rognvald are mutually contradictory and were compiled long after he died. The best known are the Norse Sagas, although modern scholars highlight many inconsistencies and improbable claims regarding Rognvald in the sagas, and believe that they must be treated with caution: The texts of the sagas were compiled three centuries after the events described and their accuracy in regard to Rognvald&#x27;s life and historical significance is now questioned. Hence some scholars instead emphasise other accounts, closer to the historical period in question, such as Irish and Scottish sources.

While Rognvald does appear to have had some kind of role in the founding of the Norse Earldom of Orkney, most historians now doubt claims in the Sagas that Rognvald led one particular &quot;great voyage&quot; – a Norwegian expedition that attacked rebel vikings, who had been raiding Norway from bases on Orkney and Shetland, before raiding the Scottish mainland, Ireland and the Isle of Man. It is now generally believed that any such expedition would have occurred after Rognvald&#x27;s lifetime. A modern authority on Orcadian history, William P. L. Thomson, comments that the story of the &quot;great voyage is so thoroughly ingrained in popular and scholarly history, both ancient and modern, that it comes as a bit of a shock to realise that it might not be true.&quot;

Modern scholars also highlight inconsistencies and improbable claims in the sagas&#x27; claims regarding: the relationship between Rognvald and Harald; the names and biographies of Rognvald&#x27;s immediate family; and, the founding of the earldom of Møre.

Rognvald was the father of Torf-Einarr (d. circa 910) an earl of Orkney. Some Norse accounts claimed that another son, Hrólfr, settled in France and, under the name Rollo (d. 930), founded the Duchy of Normandy. However, French sources suggest that Rollo&#x27;s father was an unnamed Danish or Norwegian nobleman, or a viking named Ketill.

==Traditional accounts==
===Sources===
The oldest account that may refer to Rognvald and the Earldom of Orkney appears to be the &quot;Fragmentary Annals of Ireland&quot;. These annals are believed to date from the lifetime of Donnchad mac Gilla Pátraic, who died in 1039, although they survive only as incomplete copies made by Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh (17th century).

These events are placed after an account of the devastation of Fortriu, dated to around 866, and the mention of an eclipse confirms a date of 865.

Dating the &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot; has proven to be controversial but a recent analysis has the &quot;majority of scholars in favour of dates between 1170 and 1220&quot; whilst admitting that &quot;it remains to be established when, why, where, for whom and by whom it was written&quot;. Much of the information it contains is &quot;hard to corroborate&quot;.

Rognvald is also referred to in Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s &quot;Heimskringla&quot; (written c. 1230), written in Iceland.

While the &quot;Historia Norvegiae&quot; (written c. 1505) includes an account of the foundation of the Orkney earldom, as well as some questionable details about pre-Viking Orkney, it has relatively little to say about Rognvald.

===Family===
It is not certain that the Ragnall of the Irish annals is synonymous with Rognvald Eysteinsson. The relevant entry goes on to describe Ragnall&#x27;s older sons raiding in Spain and North Africa, but there is no specific mention of the Earldom of Orkney. There is also a separate piece of circumstantial evidence, suggesting a link between Ragnall and the 9th century figure Ragnar Lodbrok: runic inscriptions found inside Maeshowe, dating from the 12th century, state that the mound was &quot;built before Loðbrók&quot;.

There is no agreement in the available sources on Rognvald&#x27;s parentage. According to the Irish annals, Ragnall was the son of &quot;Halfdan, King of Lochlann&quot;. This is generally understood to mean Halfdan the Black, which would make Ragnall the brother of King Harald Fairhair. This is contradicted by later Norse sagas, which suggest that Halfdan was Rognvald&#x27;s grandfather. The &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot; says that Rognvald was the son of Eystein Ivarsson and grandson of Ívarr Upplendingajarl.

He was married, according to the &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot; to Ragnhild, the daughter of a man named Hrólfr Nose, although in the &quot;Heimskringla&quot; his wife is named Hild.

Both sagas refer to six sons. The oldest, &quot;by concubines&quot;, were Hallad, Einarr and Hrollaug, who were &quot;grown men when their brothers born in marriage were still children&quot;. The latter were Ivar, Hrólfr, and Thorir the Silent. Hrólfr, who &quot;was so big that no horse could carry him&quot;, hence his byname of &quot;Ganger-Hrólf&quot;, (which means &quot;by foot&quot;) is identified by the saga writers with Rollo, founder of the Duchy of Normandy (in 911).

In the &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot; Rognvald was made the Earl of Møre by Harald Fairhair. The &quot;Saga of Harald Fairhair &quot;in &quot;Heimskringla&quot; recounts that Rognvald caused Harald Fairhair to be given his byname by cutting and dressing his hair, which had been uncut for ten years on account of his vow never to cut it until he was ruler of all Norway. Rognvald accompanied the king on a great military expedition. First the islands of Shetland and Orkney were cleared of Vikings who had been raiding Norway and then continued on to Scotland, Ireland and the Isle of Man. During this campaign Rognvald&#x27;s son Ivarr was killed and in compensation Harald granted Rognvald Orkney and Shetland.

Rognvald thereafter returned to Norway, giving the northern isles to his brother Sigurd Eysteinsson. Sigurd had been the forecastleman on Harald&#x27;s ship and after sailing back east the king &quot;gave Sigurd the title of earl&quot;. However, the &quot;Heimskringla&quot; states specifically that Sigurd was the first Earl of Orkney. According to the &quot;Orkneyinga Saga&quot;, after Sigurd became earl he died in a curious fashion, following a battle with Máel Brigte of Moray. Sigurd&#x27;s son Gurthorm ruled for a single winter after this and died childless. Rognvald&#x27;s son Hallad then inherited the title. However, unable to constrain Danish raids on Orkney, he gave up the earldom and returned to Norway, which &quot;everyone thought was a huge joke.&quot; Still, there is a tradition among the folk at Strath Halladale, Sutherland, which is named for Hallad, that he returned and was slain in battle at the beginning of the tenth century and was buried near the battle site in a circular trench ten or twelve feet wide. His sword, it is said, was placed beside him in the grave, and a stone was placed in the center of the circle, part of which was still visible at the beginning of the eighteenth century. The site was near a little town called Dal Halladha, Halladha&#x27;s field.


The Danish raids caused Rognvald to fly into a rage and summon his sons Thorir and Hrolluag. He predicted that Thorir&#x27;s path would keep him in Norway and that Hrolluag was destined seek his fortune in Iceland. Turf-Einar, the youngest, then came forward and offered to go to the islands. Rognvald said: &quot;Considering the kind of mother you have, slave-born on each side of her family, you are not likely to make much of a ruler. But I agree, the sooner you leave and the later you return the happier I&#x27;ll be.&quot; His father&#x27;s misgivings notwithstanding, Torf-Einarr succeeded in defeating the Danes and founded a dynasty which retained control of the islands for centuries after his death.

&quot;Historia Norvegiae&quot; includes some questionable details about pre-Viking Orkney – such as an account of the Picts as a small people who hid in the daytime – as well as the foundation of the Orkney earldom.In the days of Harald Fairhair, king of Norway, certain pirates, of the family of the most vigorous prince Ronald [Rognvald], set out with a great fleet, and crossed the Solundic sea..., and subdued the islands to themselves. And being there provided with safe winter seats, they went in summer-time working tyranny upon the English, and the Scots, and sometimes also upon the Irish, so that they took under their rule, from England, Northumbria; from Scotland, Caithness; from Ireland, Dublin, and the other sea-side towns. This account does not specifically associate Rognvald with the earldom, attributing the &quot;dominion&quot; of the islands to the anonymous kinfolk of his son Hrólfr.

===Death and legacy===
Rognvald was killed by King Harald&#x27;s son Halfdan Hålegg and Gudrod Gleam, who engineered a sudden attack, surrounding the house in which Rognvald was staying, and burned it to the ground with the earl and 60 of his men inside it. Harald &quot;flew into a rage&quot; when he heard about this and sent out a &quot;great force&quot; against Gudrod who was then banished. Halfdan escaped into the western seas and Rognvald&#x27;s death was later avenged by Torf-Einarr, who killed him on North Ronaldsay and then made peace with Harald. Rognvald&#x27;s son Thorir was then made Earl of Møre by Harald, who also gave Thorir his daughter Alof in marriage.

The sagas thus identify Rognvald as the apical figure of the Norse Earls of Orkney who controlled the islands until the early 13th century, and a forerunner of important Icelandic families. Furthermore, through his son Hrolfr, Rognvald is portrayed as an ancestor of the Dukes of Normandy who, following the Norman conquest of England in 1066, became the kings of England.

Rognvald&#x27;s life occurs within the first eight short chapters within the &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot; and it is clear that in this early period it contains generally less detail and historical accuracy than in the later events it describes. Recorded in the 13th century, the sagas are informed by Norwegian politics of the day.

Harald Fairhair&#x27;s supposed expeditions to the west, recounted by Snorri Sturluson in &quot;Heimskringla&quot; are no longer accepted as historical realities by many modern historians, including Thomson. Later (mid-13th century) rivalry between the Norwegians and the Kings of the Scots over the Hebrides and the Isle of Man are seen to have driven Sturluson&#x27;s account. At least in part, the sagas aim to legitimise Norwegian claims to both the Northern Isles and the Kingdom of the Isles in the west. The situation faced by Earl Harald Maddadsson of Orkney in 1195, when he was forced to submit himself to royal authority after an ill-judged intervention in Norwegian affairs, would have made legendary material of this nature of considerable interest in Orkney, at the time that the sagas were written.

It is also clear that elements in the narrative are drawn from the much later expeditions undertaken by Magnus Barefoot. Nonetheless, the view that the Orkney earldom was created by &quot;members of the Møre family&quot; continues to receive academic support.

Harald Fairhair&#x27;s victory in the Battle of Hafrsfjord, which gave him dominion over parts of Norway, is traditionally dated to 872, but was probably later, perhaps as late as 900. What little is known of Scottish events in the period from the &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Alba&quot; would correspond equally well with Harald&#x27;s attacks on Scotland in the reign of Domnall mac Causantín (ruled 889–900). However, this would not correspond with the sequence in the earliest account of the origins of the Orkney earldom, which places this a generation earlier. The entry in the &quot;Fragmentary Annals&quot; at an early date also makes it difficult to reconcile the saga claims that Harald Fairhair was involved in Rognvald&#x27;s conquest of the northern isles.

Other saga material provides an alternative description. In the &quot;Eyrbyggja saga&quot; the same story of a great expedition to punish unruly Vikings who were raiding Norway is undertaken, but here it is Ketil &quot;flatnefr&quot; (Ketil Flatnose) who leads it. Although this is apparently done at Harald&#x27;s behest, Ketil then claims the islands as his own. Once again, the chronology is flawed by Harald&#x27;s inclusion in the tale as other information provided about Ketil gives him a &quot;floruit&quot; of the mid, rather than late, 9th century.

Furthermore, contemporary Irish sources have a great deal to say about Viking raids on the coasts of Ireland and southern Scotland and those who led them, but none mention King Harald. The earliest of the large expeditions again belong to a period—the 840s—that pre-dates the time of Harald&#x27;s kingship.

Smyth (1984) credits the launching of the great voyage to the west to Olaf the White, whom he provides with a royal Vestfold origin along with various military activities in Scotland and for whom, assuming an identification of Olaf with Amlaib &quot;Conung&quot; the King of Dublin, there is a contemporary Irish reference dating to 853. Icelandic sources also have Olaf marrying Aud the Deep-Minded, Ketil &quot;flatnefr&quot;&#x27;s daughter, and the ‘’Annals of Ulster’’ record what may be dynastic in-fighting between Olaf and his father-in-law in 857.

===Founding of the earldom of Orkney===
By implication the &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot; identifies Rognvald as the founder of the earldom, although &quot;Heimskringla&quot; has his brother Sigurd as the first to formally hold the title. Other sources are less specific (see above) and the sagas have been interpreted in various other ways. Smyth (1984), having banished King Harald’s role in the voyage to the west to the realms of myth concludes that the role of the brothers Eysteinsson can be similarly so dispatched and that Torf-Einarr “may be regarded as the first historical earl of Orkney”.

Drawing on Adam of Bremen&#x27;s assertion that Orkney was not conquered until the time of Harald Hardrada, who ruled Norway from 1043 to 1066, Woolf (2007) speculates that Sigurd “the Stout” Hlodvirsson, Torf-Einarr&#x27;s great-grandson, may have been the first Earl of Orkney 

===Rognvald&#x27;s brother and sons===

The notion that Rognvald could hand over his Northern Isles estates to his brother has been interpreted in various ways. For example, it may be that he was aware of ongoing Viking raiding in the area and considered the gift from the king as a mixed blessing. This is also one of a number of instances in which the writer of the &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot; attempts to reconcile the conflicting themes of independence from Norway (Rognvald gifts the islands to Sigurd) and dependence on royal authority (Harald formalises the process by confirming Sigurd as earl). Beuermann (2011) speculates that Rognvald&#x27;s transfer of power to his brother may have been an attempt by the saga writers to imply that the Orkney earldom had more independence from Norway than that of Møre and that Rognvald&#x27;s holdings in Caithness may have allowed for an even greater degree of freedom of action. Such implications are more likely to be rooted in the writer&#x27;s interest in emphasising Orcadian independence at the time of writing rather than the 9th/10th century events they purport to describe.

After Hallad&#x27;s failure in Orkney there is a dialogue between father and sons that has been interpreted as being about Rognvald&#x27;s desire to cement his own position as Earl of Møre and an allusion to the early history of Iceland, where the sagas were written. Thorir is a compliant son who Rognvald is happy to keep at home. Hrollaug is portrayed as a man of peace who will go to Iceland. Einarr is aggressive and a threat to his father&#x27;s position so can be spared for the dangers of Orkney. In the &quot;Landnámabók&quot; version the equally aggressive Hrolfr is also present, and his destiny is anticipated to be in conveniently far-away Normandy.

===Similarities to Ragnall ua Ímair===
Alex Woolf suggests that saga authors may have synthesised elements of the life of Ragnall ua Ímair, a later figure, into the figure of Rognvald Eysteinsson of Møre. Ragnall ua Ímair, who was active between 914 and 921 in the Irish Sea region, was a grandson of Ímar, the &quot;king of the Northmen of all Britain and Ireland&quot;, whose death is recorded in the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot; in 873.

There are at least two major similarities between the two figures include: both are grandsons of an Ímar/Ivarr and; like Rognvald, a close relative of Ragnall named Ímar was killed in battle in Scotland (Ímar ua Ímair, d. 904).

===Broad themes===
There are several recurring themes in the &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot;, including strife between brothers, relationships between the jarls and the Norwegian crown, and raiding in the Hebrides, all of which are touched on during the saga&#x27;s coverage of Rognvald&#x27;s life and times. In part, the saga&#x27;s purpose was to &quot;explore such social and psychological tensions as these in the history of the people of Orkney, and to help them understand themselves through a knowledge of their origins&quot;.

<doc id="350929" wikidata="Q4708736" url="?curid=350929" title="Alastair Lynch">
<text>Alastair Graeme Lynch (born 19 June 1968) is a former professional Australian rules footballer who played in the Australian Football League (AFL). He is best known as a three-time premiership full-forward for the Brisbane Lions.

The Tasmanian began his career in defence, where he became a leading goal-kicker for Fitzroy. He represented his home state at the elite level, and at the peak of his career in 1993 he was acknowledged as one of the league&#x27;s best with All-Australian status. However, he left a financially struggling Fitzroy to join the Brisbane Bears after the club&#x27;s move from the Gold Coast. With the merger of his former club Fitzroy and new club Brisbane, Lynch rejoined with former teammates and became club captain.

A long battle with chronic fatigue syndrome threatened his career; however, after many years in absence, Lynch&#x27;s return to form at a relatively late age in his career was hailed by the football community, and he became part of Brisbane Lions&#x27; celebrated premiership winning formula.

Lynch holds the record for the most combined goals for the merged Brisbane-Fitzroy entity and one of the last remaining former Fitzroy players to play in the AFL.

With a passion for cricket, Lynch went on to represent Australia&#x27;s Over 50&#x27;s team in one match against England in 2018.

==Early life==
Lynch was born in Burnie, north-west coastal Tasmania, the son of Graeme and Mollie Lynch, where he attended Burnie High School. He began playing football with Wynyard club where he played in the U17s and U19s before moving to Hobart. In Hobart he played senior football with the Hobart Football Club under coach Peter Hudson.

==VFL/AFL career==

===Fitzroy Lions career (1988–1993)===
Selected at pick 50 in the 1986 VFL Draft, Lynch began his senior football career at Fitzroy in 1988. He signed his first contract on 5 February. He was an intimidating player in defence, playing full-back and centre half-back. In his early years, his notable abilities were his strong marking (his outstanding aerial abilities were recognised when he won the 1989 Mark of the Year award) and heavy tackling. His titanic battles with key forwards such as Tony Lockett were highlights, and Lockett has commented on Lynch being one of his toughest opponents. In 1993, Fitzroy coach Robert Shaw moved Lynch to full-forward, where he led the club&#x27;s goal-kicking with 68 goals in addition to winning the best and fairest award. Lynch also played full-back in the 1990 Tasmanian State of Origin team, the first Tasmanian team to defeat Victoria in 30 years.

===Brisbane Bears career (1994–1996)===
In 1994, Lynch transferred to the Brisbane Bears. At the time, the Brisbane Bears, like the Fitzroy Football Club, were experiencing lean times, but they were improving somewhat under the coaching of premiership coach Robert Walls. The term of Lynch&#x27;s contract, ten years, was unprecedented; at the time, it was considered by outsiders to be a great risk for the club.

Lynch came full of promise to the Bears. In the early years, he became a poster-boy recruit for the struggling club, which lacked big name players.

In his first few games of the 1994 AFL season, Lynch had suffered a broken collarbone and knee surgery, making him unable deliver his best. In 1995, he contracted a mystery virus (which was later revealed that he was suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome), which sidelined him for the entire 1995 season. Some commentators believe that if Lynch had played that season, the Bears could have won a premiership. Others believed that Lynch contracted chronic fatigue when over-training during his rehabilitation from injury. Lynch was one of the first sportspeople in Australia to experiment with the ice bath, which proved to assist in his recovery, and became a public figure for the illness which was struggling for credibility at the time. After the illness Lynch rarely travelled to Perth, to play the Western Australian teams at home.

In his return the following season, the Bears, struggling for forward-line talent and with an increasingly talented back-line, first experimented playing Lynch up forward to relieve an ageing Roger Merrett with some success. Successive seasons saw him interchanged between the two opposite ends of the ground.

===Brisbane Lions career (1997–2004)===
When Fitzroy merged with the Bears after the 1996 season to form the Brisbane Lions, Lynch was made a semi-permanent forward but was unable to perform at his peak for the next two seasons due to minor recurrence of his illness.

Lynch was appointed as club co-captain with Michael Voss in 1997, a position that he held until 2000, when Voss assumed the full captaincy.

Still struggling with intermittent lapses of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome in 1998, Lynch discovered that the drug he had been prescribed at the beginning of the season, although with the permission of the Australian Sports Drug Agency (official AFL drug agents), had been added to the International Olympic Committee list of banned substances. He took it upon himself to alert the AFL and was controversially charged for taking a prohibited substance before eventually being cleared.

A new beginning for Lynch and the Lions came in 1999 under champion coach Leigh Matthews. He played some games in defence but usually at full-forward. Improvements in his strength, kicking for goal, and positioning during marking contests made him one of the most feared forwards in the competition.

The Brisbane Lions enjoyed great success for the 2001, 2002, and 2003 seasons, with Lynch becoming a multiple goal-kicker against the game&#x27;s most prominent full-backs, including Stephen Silvagni, Matthew Scarlett, and Shane Wakelin from Collingwood, Brisbane&#x27;s ongoing rivals. In this period, Lynch played in three successive premierships. Lynch was in possession of the ball when the final siren sounded at the 2001 Grand Final to signify the club&#x27;s first Premiership in 57 years. He would go on to play a key role in two further Grand Final triumphs. In 2004, he was the competition&#x27;s oldest player at 36 years of age, and became the last remaining player born in the 1960s to play in the VFL/AFL.

Lynch announced his retirement after Brisbane&#x27;s loss in the 2004 AFL Grand Final. It was viewed by some as a disappointing end to his career; he injured his quad early in the game, his only statistic for the day was giving away a free kick which led to Port Adelaide&#x27;s first goal for the match, and he would have missed the first ten matches of 2005 after being reported a record-equalling seven times for exchanging punches in an all-out fight with Port Adelaide&#x27;s Darryl Wakelin, for which Lynch was also fined $15,000. Lynch has since admitted significant regret about his behaviour in the match.

<doc id="350932" wikidata="Q940191" url="?curid=350932" title="Edward Poynings">
<text>Sir Edward Poynings KG (1459 – 22 October 1521) was an English soldier, administrator and diplomat, and Lord Deputy of Ireland under King Henry VII of England.
==Early life==
Edward Poynings was the only son of Sir Robert Poynings (c.1419–1461) and Elizabeth Paston (1429?–1487/8), the only daughter of William Paston (1378–1444). He was likely born at his father&#x27;s house in Southwark, afterwards the Crosskeys tavern, and then the Queen&#x27;s Head. His father had been carver and sword-bearer to Jack Cade, and was killed at the Second Battle of St Albans on 17 February 1461. His mother, who married Robert Poynings in December 1459, inherited her husband&#x27;s property in Kent in spite of opposition from her brother-in-law, Edward Poynings, master of Arundel College. Before 1472 she married a second husband, Sir George Browne of Betchworth Castle, Surrey, by whom she had a son, Matthew, and a daughter. She died in 1487, appointing Edward as her executor. Some of her correspondence is included in the &quot;Paston Letters&quot;.

Poynings was brought up by his mother. In October 1483 he was a leader of the rising in Kent planned to second Buckingham&#x27;s insurrection against Richard III. He was named in the king&#x27;s proclamation, but escaped abroad to follow Henry, Earl of Richmond. He was in Brittany in October 1484, and in August 1485 landed with Richmond at Milford Haven. He was at once made a knight banneret, and in the same year was sworn of the Privy Council.

==Under Henry VII==
In 1488 he was on a commission to inspect the ordnance at Calais, and in 1491 was made a Knight of the Garter. In the following year he was placed in command of fifteen hundred men sent to aid the Emperor Maximilian against his rebellious subjects in the Netherlands. The rebels, under the leadership of Ravenstein, held Bruges, Damme, and Sluys, where they fitted out ships to prey on English commerce. Poynings first cleared the sea of the privateers, and then laid siege to Sluys in August, while the Duke of Saxony blockaded it on land. After some hard fighting the two castles defending the town were taken, and the rebels entered into negotiations with Poynings to return to their allegiance. Poynings then joined Henry VII before Boulogne, but the French war was closed almost without bloodshed by the treaty of Etaples on 3 November.

In 1493 Poynings was acting as deputy or governor of Calais. In July he was sent with Warham on a mission to Archduke Philip to gain Perkin Warbeck&#x27;s expulsion from Burgundy, where he had been welcomed by the dowager duchess Margaret. The envoys obtained from Philip a promise that he would abstain from aiding Warbeck, but the duke asserted that he could not control the actions of the duchess, who was the real ruler of the country.

==In Ireland==
Meanwhile, in Ireland, a Yorkist stronghold, the struggles between the Butlers and Geraldines had reduced royal authority to a shadow even within the English Pale, and Gerald Fitzgerald, 8th Earl of Kildare, the head of the Geraldines and Lord Deputy, was in treasonable relations with Warbeck. Henry appointed Prince Henry as viceroy, and made Poynings the prince&#x27;s deputy.

Poynings landed at Howth on 13 October 1494 with a thousand men, and Henry Deane, bishop of Bangor, to act as chancellor, Hugh Conway as treasurer, and others to control the courts of king&#x27;s bench, common pleas, and exchequer. Poynings&#x27;s first measure was an expedition into Ulster, in conjunction with Kildare, to punish O&#x27;Donnell, O&#x27;Hanlon, Magennis, and other chieftains who had abetted Warbeck&#x27;s first invasion of Ireland. His progress was stopped by the news that Kildare was plotting with O&#x27;Hanlon against his life; some colour was given to the charge by the revolt of Kildare&#x27;s brother James, who seized Carlow Castle, mounted the Geraldine banner, and refused to surrender when summoned in the king&#x27;s name. Poynings abandoned the Ulster invasion, turned south, and with some difficulty reduced Carlow; he then proceeded to Drogheda and summoned a parliament.

===Poynings&#x27; Parliament===
The parliament opened on 1 December 1494, and, after attainting Kildare, proceeded to pass for Poynings numerous acts tending to make Irish administration directly dependent on the Crown and privy council. Judges and others were to hold office during pleasure, and not by patent as hitherto; the chief castles were to be put in English hands; it was made illegal to carry weapons or make private war without license, and it was declared high treason to excite the Irish to take up arms. Further the statutes of Kilkenny passed in 1366, forbidding marriage or intercourse between the English colonists and the Irish, and the adoption by Englishmen of Irish laws, customs, or manners, were also re-enacted.

Over the centuries, the terms &quot;The Statute[s] of Drogheda&quot;, &quot;Poynings&#x27; Law&quot;, or &quot;Poynings&#x27; Act&quot; have been applied variously by politicians, historians, and lawyers, either to the full set (or &quot;statute&quot;, 10 Hen. 7) of acts passed by the parliament, or to one of two specific acts (or &quot;chapters&quot;):
* &quot;An Act that no Parliament be holden in this Land until the Acts be certified into England&quot; (10 Hen. 7 c. 4 (I)): Constitutionally, no parliament should be summoned in Ireland except under the Great Seal of England, or without notice to the English privy council, and that no acts of the Irish parliament should be valid unless previously submitted. This rendered the Irish parliament completely subordinate to that of England. Despite some amendments and promises of repeal, it was not until the Constitution of 1782 that the Irish parliament once more became independent.
* &quot;An Act confirming all the Statutes made in England&quot; (10 Hen. 7 c. 22 (I)): while the act referred to acts &quot;lately made&quot;, it was subsequently interpreted as applying to all acts of the Parliament of England made before 1494.

===Later actions===
While this parliament was sitting, Poynings made another expedition into Ulster, leaving a commission with his chancellor to continue, prorogue, or dissolve it as he thought fit. The Irish retreated, and the second expedition was even less successful than the first. Poynings now negotiated alliances with various septs, chiefly by money payments, and enforced on the inhabitants of the Pale the duty of protecting its borders against Irish incursions. With the help of his under-treasurer, William Hatteclyffe, with whom he was connected by marriage, Poynings endeavoured to reform the finances; but the opposition of subordinate officials largely impaired his success, and Warbeck&#x27;s attack on Waterford in July 1495 interrupted the work. The lord deputy marched in person against Perkin, who blockaded Waterford with eleven ships, while Desmond, with 2,400 men, attacked it on land. The town held out for eleven days, and then, on Poynings&#x27;s approach, Warbeck fled to Scotland.

Poynings was recalled in January 1496. The Yorkists in Ireland had been dealt with, but Henry was disappointed that Poynings, through his system of subsidising Irish chiefs, and the partial failure of his fiscal reforms, had been unable to make Ireland pay her own way; and he now fell back on the cheaper method of governing by the help of the great Anglo-Irish families. Kildare, who had regained favour, was once more appointed deputy, and the Geraldine supremacy lasted till 1534.

==Later life==
After his return to England, Poynings was occupied in the administration of the Cinque ports, of which he was appointed warden in succession to his brother-in-law, Sir William Scot, and Prince Henry. In 1500 he was present at the interview between Henry VII and the Archduke Philip at Calais, and in October 1501 was one of those appointed to meet and conduct Catherine of Aragon to London. He performed a similar office for the Flemish ambassadors who came to England in 1508 to conclude the projected marriage of Henry&#x27;s daughter Mary to Prince Charles of Castile, and some time before the king&#x27;s death became controller of the household. He was one of those trusty councillors who were recommended by Henry VII in his will to his son.

Poynings&#x27;s offices of controller and warden of the Cinque ports were regranted him at the beginning of the new reign. In 1511 he was again on active service. In June he was placed in command of some ships and a force of fifteen hundred men, and despatched to assist Margaret of Savoy, Regent of the Netherlands, in suppressing the revolt in Gelderland. He embarked at Sandwich on 18 July, reduced several towns and castles, and then proceeded to besiege Venlo. After three unsuccessful assaults the siege was raised, and Poynings, loaded with favours by Margaret and Charles, returned to England in the autumn.

He sat in the parliament summoned on 4 February 1512, probably for some constituency in Kent, but the returns are lost. From May to November he was going from place to place in the Netherlands, negotiating a league against France. He was similarly employed early in 1513, with the formation of the &#x27;holy league&#x27; on 5 April between the emperor, the pope, and the kings of England and Spain. With a retinue of five hundred men he was present at the capture of Therouanne on 22 August, and of Tournai on 24 September. He was in bad health, and though made lieutenant of Tournai, on 20 January 1514 William Blount, 4th Baron Mountjoy succeeded him. But through most of 1514 Poynings was in the Netherlands, engaged in diplomatic work.

In October peace was made with France, and in February 1515 Poynings returned to England, with a pension of a thousand marks from Charles, and requested leave to go on a pilgrimage to Rome. In March he was appointed ambassador to the Pope, but the embassy never started; and on 7 May, with William Knight (1476–1547), he was nominated envoy to renew the league of 1505 with Prince Charles. On 14 September Poynings returned to England, after four months&#x27; unsuccessful negotiation. In the same month, however, the victory of France at Marignano once more cemented the league of her enemies, and Poynings, who was recommissioned ambassador to Charles (now king of Spain) on 21 February 1516, succeeded in concluding a treaty with him on 19 April.

This was the last of Poynings&#x27;s major negotiations, and he spent now most of his time at his manor of Westenhanger, Kent, where he rebuilt the castle, or the Cinque Ports. In June 1517 he was deciding disputes between English and French merchants at Calais, and in the same year he became chancellor of the order of the Garter. He is occasionally referred to as Lord Poynings, but never became a peer. In 1518 he was treating for the surrender of Tournai, and in 1520 he took part in the proceedings at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. He was also present at Henry&#x27;s meeting with Emperor Charles V at Gravelines on 10 July. He died at Westenhanger in October 1521.

Poynings&#x27; will is printed in Nicholas Harris Nicolas&#x27;s &quot;Testamenta Vetusta&quot;. His estates passed to Henry Algernon Percy, 5th Earl of Northumberland, the grandson of Poynings&#x27;s first cousin Eleanor, who married Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland.

==Marriage and issue==
Poynings married, before 1485, Isabel or Elizabeth Scott (d. 15 August 1528), daughter of Sir John Scott (d.1485), Marshal of Calais, and sister of Sir William Scott, Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports and Sheriff of Kent, by whom he had a son, John Poynings, who predeceased him without issue. Elizabeth Scott was buried in Brabourne church, where she is commemorated by a brass.

Poynings also had seven illegitimate children:

*Thomas Poynings, 1st Baron Poynings.
*Edward Poynings, captain of the guard at Boulogne, killed in action there in 1546.
*Sir Adrian Poynings, appointed lieutenant to Wyatt at Boulogne in February 1546, captain of Boulogne in the following June, and served for some years under the Lord High Admiral. He was knighted at the accession of Elizabeth, and in 1561 became governor of Portsmouth, where he died on 15 February 1571. His daughter, Anne, married Sir George More of Loseley, Surrey.
*Jane Poynings, who married firstly Thomas Clinton, 8th Baron Clinton (d.1517), by whom she was the mother of Edward Clinton, 1st Earl of Lincoln (d.1585), Lord Admiral of England, and secondly, as his second wife, Sir Robert Wingfield (d.1539), by whom she had no issue.
*Margaret Poynings, who married Edward Barry of Sevington.
*Mary Poynings, who married Thomas Wilsford.
*Rose Poynings (born 1505), who married a husband surnamed Lewknor.

<text>Justin Mark Madden (born 31 May 1961) is a former Australian rules footballer and state politician. He played for both the Essendon Football Club and the Carlton Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL).

After his retirement in 1997, Madden decided to enter Victorian politics, using the experience gained from his presidency of the AFL Players Association to run for candidacy as an Australian Labor Party member. He served in both the Victorian Legislative Assembly and Victorian Legislative Council before retiring from office in November 2014. Madden is also a registered architect in the State of Victoria.

==Early life==
Madden was born in Melbourne, he attended Primary School at St Christopher&#x27;s in Airport West and had his secondary schooling at St. Bernard&#x27;s College in Essendon, a school renowned for its sporting prowess. He then studied teaching at the Institute of Catholic Education (now the Australian Catholic University).

His older brother Simon was also a footballer, playing for Essendon.

==VFL/AFL playing career ==
Madden was still at college when he made his VFL senior debut in 1980 with the Essendon Football Club, where his older brother Simon was an established player. He graduated from college the following year and, in 1982, set about juggling the twin demands of teaching and football careers. In 1980 and 1981, Madden played 45 games for Essendon, but was concerned that he was not getting enough playing time, and transferred to Carlton part way through the 1983 VFL season. Standing at 206 cm (6&#x27; 9&quot;) tall, Madden was one of the tallest men ever to play Australian Rules football, and his potential in this area was fully utilized by Carlton, who used him as their main ruckman. Over the next fifteen seasons, Madden became a mainstay of the Carlton side, and one of the most recognizable players in the league, playing 287 games for the club. He was a member of their 1987 and 1995 premiership teams, and came within one vote of tying with Brad Hardie for the 1985 Brownlow Medal when he polled three votes in five consecutive games.

Madden retired from teaching in 1988, and in 1990, became President of the AFL Players Association, (taking over the role from his older brother Simon) while still playing for Carlton and at the peak of his career. In his seven-year tenure, which continued until his retirement, he oversaw the increasing professionalism of the game with the first players&#x27; collective bargaining agreement, and the expansion of the association to the point where it represented almost every eligible player in the entire league. Despite the increasing demands of AFL football, where most players were becoming professional players, Madden studied at Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology to become an architect. After graduating, he worked in this field while continuing to play football.

==Political career==
After retiring from football in 1997, Madden continued to work as an architect. The Essendon and Carlton Football Clubs agreed to name future contests between the two clubs the &quot;Madden Cup&quot;, in honour of both the Madden brothers. By this time, Madden was also a life member at Carlton.

Madden&#x27;s nomination as a Labor candidate for the Legislative Council seat of Doutta Galla Province in the leadup to the 1999 state election came as a surprise to many. However, he attained pre-selection, and was subsequently elected. When Labor won a surprise victory at the election, Madden found himself appointed Minister for Sport and Recreation, despite having no prior political experience. This was in spite of rumours that he had specifically requested not to be given Sport and Recreation, but instead had asked to be made responsible for Education. He was initially given the additional portfolio of Youth Affairs, but this was replaced with the Commonwealth Games after the 2002 election.

In the wake of reforms to the Legislative Council which cut the number of members, Madden was initially placed in danger of losing his pre-selection, but was saved by intervention from Premier Steve Bracks. This initially saw him pre-selected for the Legislative Assembly seat of Bundoora, vacated by former minister Sherryl Garbutt. However, after the sudden retirement of another former minister, Mary Delahunty, in Northcote, another deal was arranged which saw Madden instead remain in a safe position on the Legislative Council ticket. At the 2006 Victoria State election he was elected to the Legislative Council as a member for the Western Metropolitan Region.

In December 2006, he became the state&#x27;s Minister of Planning. In early 2007, Madden criticised Victorians for building too many large homes. This statement became controversial after it was discovered Madden himself had a sprawling home and had in fact applied to renovate and conduct a major extension onto his home, thus creating much discussion on outspoken journalist Neil Mitchell&#x27;s talk-back radio program on 3AW. The Minister has since completed his extensions and defended his statements.

Madden was a keynote speaker at the 2008 Metropolis Congress in Sydney October 2008. Madden addressed world mayors and industry leaders on urban development and Metropolitan Performance Management.

On 25 February 2010 the ABC revealed an email mistakenly sent from Mr Madden&#x27;s office containing a media strategy document. The document included strategy for dealing with a proposed development: The document said the government would claim it consulted with the community on the plans to develop the Windsor hotel then block the proposal and say it did so because it listened to community views. 

In the 2010 Victoria state election, when the Labor party was defeated, he moved from the Legislative Council and was elected to the Legislative Assembly seat of Essendon.

On 15 November 2013, Madden announced his intention to retire from politics at the next state election.

<text>Mikhail Leontyevich Mil (; 22 November 1909 – 31 January 1970) was a Soviet and Russian aerospace engineer and scientist. He was the founder and general designer of the Mil Moscow Helicopter Plant.

==Biography==
Mil was born to a Russian Jewish family in Irkutsk. His father was an employee of the Trans-Siberian Railway, and his mother was a dentist. His grandfather was a cantonist who had been drafted from Libava (today Liepāja), Latvia, and who settled in Siberia after 25 years in the Imperial Russian Navy.

At age 12 Mil won the first prize in a model glider competition. In 1926 he entered the Siberian Technological Institute in Tomsk; however, since there was no curriculum for aerospace engineering, he decided to transfer in 1928 to the Don Polytechnical Institute in Novocherkassk, where he was able to specialise in aviation. He married a fellow student, P.G. Rudenko, in 1932 and 4 daughters and a son followed.

After graduating from the institute in 1931, Mil began his career at TsAGI, too late to work under its original founder, Nikolay Zhukovsky. He specialised in the design of autogyros, and was an assistant to his future rival, Nikolai Kamov. With the start of World War II, Mil was drafted into the Red Army and fought on the Eastern Front in 1941 near Yelnya. In 1943 he was called back to continue research and development in improving the stability and control of combat aircraft. He completed his dissertations (&quot;Candidate&quot;, 1943, PhD, 1945) and in 1947 headed the Helicopter Lab at TsAGI, which was later turned into the Moscow Helicopter Plant.
Mil&#x27;s creations won many domestic and international awards and set 69 world records. Most notably, the Mil Mi-4 won a gold medal in the Brussels International Exposition in 1958. In 1971, after his death, his Mil Mi-12 (production name of V-12 prototype) won the Sikorsky Prize as the most powerful helicopter in the world. Unlike his Soviet counterpart, Nikolai Kamov, Mil enjoyed great prestige due to his single-rotor helicopters, as Kamov used the co-axial rotor layout, which was more controversial.

He died in 1970 in Moscow and was buried in Yudinskoe Cemetery in the outskirts of Moscow.

<doc id="350939" wikidata="Q805" url="?curid=350939" title="Yemen">
<text>Yemen, officially the Republic of Yemen, is a country in West Asia. Located in southern Arabia, it borders Saudi Arabia to the north, Oman to the northeast, the south-easten part of the Arabian Sea to the east, the Gulf of Aden to the south, and the Red Sea to the west, sharing maritime borders with Djibouti, Eritrea, and Somalia across the Horn of Africa. Covering roughly 455,503 square kilometres (175,871 square miles), with a coastline of approximately , Yemen is the second largest country on the Arabian Peninsula. Sanaa is its constitutional capital and largest city. Yemen&#x27;s estimated population is 34.7 million, mostly Arab Muslims. It is a member of the Arab League, the United Nations, the Non-Aligned Movement and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.

Owing to its geographic location, Yemen has been at the crossroads of many civilisations for over 7,000 years. In 1200 BCE, the Sabaeans formed a thriving commercial kingdom that included parts of modern Ethiopia and Eritrea. In 275 CE, it was succeeded by the Himyarite Kingdom, which spanned much of Yemen&#x27;s present-day territory and was heavily influenced by Judaism. Christianity arrived in the fourth century, followed by the rapid spread of Islam in the seventh century. Yemenite troops played a crucial role in early Islamic conquests. Various dynasties emerged between the 9th and 16th centuries. During the 19th century, the country was divided between the Ottoman and British empires. After World War I, the Kingdom of Yemen was established, which in 1962 became the Yemen Arab Republic (North Yemen) following a coup. In 1967, the British Aden Protectorate became the independent People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Yemen (South Yemen), the first and only officially socialist state in the Arab world. In 1990, the two Yemeni states united to form the modern Republic of Yemen, with Ali Abdullah Saleh serving as the first president until his resignation in 2012 in the wake of the Arab Spring.

Since 2011, Yemen has been enduring a political crisis, marked by street protests against poverty, unemployment, corruption, and President Saleh&#x27;s plan to amend Yemen&#x27;s constitution and eliminate the presidential term limit. By 2015, the country became engulfed by an ongoing civil war with multiple entities vying for governance, including the Presidential Leadership Council of the internationally recognized government, and the Houthi movement&#x27;s Supreme Political Council. This conflict, which has escalated to involve various foreign powers, has led to a severe humanitarian crisis.

Yemen is one of the least developed countries in the world, facing significant obstacles to sustainable development, and is one of the poorest countries in the Middle East and North Africa. In 2019, the United Nations reported that Yemen had the highest number of people in need of humanitarian aid, amounting to about 24 million individuals, or nearly 75% of its population. As of 2020, Yemen ranked highest on the Fragile States Index and second-worst on the Global Hunger Index, surpassed only by the Central African Republic. Additionally, it has the lowest Human Development Index out of all non-African countries.

The term &quot;Yamnat&quot; was first mentioned in the Old South Arabian inscriptions on the title of one of the kings of the second Himyarite Kingdom known as Shammar Yahri&#x27;sh. The term probably referred to the southwestern coastline of the Arabian Peninsula and the southern coastline between Aden and Hadhramaut. Historical Yemen included much greater territory than the current nation, stretching from northern &#x27;Asir in southwestern Saudi Arabia to Dhofar in southern Oman.

One etymology derives Yemen from &quot;ymnt&quot;, meaning literally &quot;South [of the Arabian Peninsula]&quot;, and significantly plays on the notion of the land to the right (). Other sources claim that Yemen is related to &quot;yamn&quot; or &quot;yumn&quot;, meaning &quot;felicity&quot; or &quot;blessed&quot;, as much of the country is fertile, in contrast to the barren land of most of Arabia. The Romans called it &quot;Arabia Felix&quot; (&quot;happy&quot; or &quot;fortunate&quot; Arabia&quot;), as opposed to &quot;Arabia Deserta&quot; (&quot;deserted Arabia&quot;).
Latin and Greek writers referred to ancient Yemen as &quot;India&quot;, which arose from the Persians calling the Abyssinians whom they came into contact with in South Arabia by the name of the black-skinned people who lived next to them.

== History ==

Yemen has existed at the crossroads of its civilisations for more than 7,000 years. The country was home to figures such as the Queen of Sheba who brought a caravan of gifts for King Solomon. For centuries, it became a primary producer of coffee exported in the port of Mocha. From its conversion to Islam in the 7th century, Yemen became a center of Islamic learning, and much of its architecture survived until modern times.

=== Ancient history ===

With its long sea border between eastern and western civilizations, Yemen has long existed at a crossroads of cultures with a strategic location in terms of trade on the west of the Arabian Peninsula. Large settlements for their era existed in the mountains of northern Yemen as early as 5000 BC. The Sabaean Kingdom came into existence in at least the 12th century BC. The four major kingdoms or tribal confederations in South Arabia were Saba, Hadhramaut, Qataban, and Ma&#x27;in.

&quot;Sabaʾ&quot; () is thought to be biblical Sheba and was the most prominent federation. The Sabaean rulers adopted the title Mukarrib generally thought to mean &quot;unifier&quot;, or a &quot;priest-king&quot;, or the head of the confederation of South Arabian kingdoms, the &quot;king of the kings&quot;. The role of the Mukarrib was to bring the various tribes under the kingdom and preside over them all. The Sabaeans built the Great Dam of Marib around 940 BC. The dam was built to withstand the seasonal flash floods surging down the valley.

By the third century BC, Qataban, Hadhramaut, and Ma&#x27;in became independent from Saba and established themselves in the Yemeni arena. Minaean rule stretched as far as Dedan, with their capital at Baraqish. The Sabaeans regained their control over Ma&#x27;in after the collapse of Qataban in 50 BC. By the time of the Roman expedition to Arabia Felix in 25 BC, the Sabaeans were once again the dominating power in Southern Arabia. Aelius Gallus was ordered to lead a military campaign to establish Roman dominance over the Sabaeans.

The Romans had a vague and contradictory geographical knowledge about Arabia Felix. A Roman army of 10,000 men was defeated before reaching Marib. Strabo&#x27;s close relationship with Aelius Gallus led him to attempt to justify his friend&#x27;s defeat in his writings. It took the Romans six months to reach Marib and 60 days to return to Egypt. The Romans blamed their Nabataean guide and executed him for treachery. No direct mention in Sabaean inscriptions of the Roman expedition has yet been found.

After the Roman expedition (perhaps earlier) the country fell into chaos, and two clans, namely Hamdan and Himyar, claimed kingship, assuming the title King of Sheba and Dhu Raydan. Dhu Raydan, &quot;i.e.&quot;, Himyarites, allied themselves with Aksum in Ethiopia against the Sabaeans. The chief of Bakil and king of Saba and Dhu Raydan, El Sharih Yahdhib, launched successful campaigns against the Himyarites and Habashat, &quot;i.e.&quot;, Aksum. El Sharih took pride in his campaigns and added the title Yahdhib to his name, which means &quot;suppressor&quot;; he used to kill his enemies by cutting them to pieces. Sana&#x27;a came into prominence during his reign, as he built the Ghumdan Palace as his place of residence.

The Himyarites annexed Sana&#x27;a from Hamdan around 100 AD. Hashdi tribesmen rebelled against them and regained Sana&#x27;a around 180. Shammar Yahri&#x27;sh had conquered Hadhramaut, Najran, and Tihamah by 275, thus unifying Yemen and consolidating Himyarite rule. The Himyarites rejected polytheism and adhered to a consensual form of monotheism called Rahmanism.
In 354, Roman Emperor Constantius II sent an embassy headed by Theophilos the Indian to convert the Himyarites to Christianity. According to Philostorgius, the mission was resisted by local Jews. Several inscriptions have been found in Hebrew and Sabaean praising the ruling house in Jewish terms for &quot;...helping and empowering the People of Israel.&quot;

According to Islamic traditions, King As&#x27;ad the Perfect mounted a military expedition to support the Jews of Yathrib. Abu Kariba As&#x27;ad, as known from the inscriptions, led a military campaign to central Arabia or Najd to support the vassal Kingdom of Kinda against the Lakhmids. However, no direct reference to Judaism or Yathrib was discovered from his lengthy reign. Abu Kariba died in 445, having reigned for almost 50 years. By 515, Himyar became increasingly divided along religious lines and a bitter conflict between different factions paved the way for an Aksumite intervention. The last Himyarite king Ma&#x27;adikarib Ya&#x27;fur was supported by Aksum against his Jewish rivals. Ma&#x27;adikarib was Christian and launched a campaign against the Lakhmids in southern Iraq, with the support of other Arab allies of Byzantium. The Lakhmids were a bulwark of Persia, which was intolerant to a proselytizing religion like Christianity.

After the death of Ma&#x27;adikarib Ya&#x27;fur around 521, a Himyarite Jewish warlord called Dhu Nuwas rose to power. Emperor Justinian I sent an embassy to Yemen. He wanted the officially Christian Himyarites to use their influence on the tribes in inner Arabia to launch military operations against Persia. Justinian I bestowed the &quot;dignity of king&quot; upon the Arab sheikhs of Kindah and Ghassan in central and northern Arabia. From early on, Roman and Byzantine policy was to develop close links with the powers of the coast of the Red Sea. They were successful in converting Aksum and influencing their culture. The results concerning to Yemen were rather disappointing.

A Kendite prince called Yazid bin Kabshat rebelled against Abraha and his Arab Christian allies. A truce was reached once the Great Dam of Marib had suffered a breach. Abraha died around 570. The Sasanid Empire annexed Aden around 570. Under their rule, most of Yemen enjoyed great autonomy except for Aden and Sana&#x27;a. This era marked the collapse of ancient South Arabian civilization, since the greater part of the country was under several independent clans until the arrival of Islam in 630.

=== Middle Ages ===
==== Advent of Islam and the three dynasties ====

Muhammad sent his cousin Ali to Sana&#x27;a and its surroundings around 630. At the time, Yemen was the most advanced region in Arabia. The Banu Hamdan confederation was among the first to accept Islam. Muhammad sent Muadh ibn Jabal, as well to Al-Janad, in present-day Taiz, and dispatched letters to various tribal leaders. Major tribes, including Himyar, sent delegations to Medina during the &quot;year of delegations&quot; around 630–631. Several Yemenis accepted Islam before 630, such as Ammar ibn Yasir, Al-Ala&#x27;a Al-Hadrami, Miqdad ibn Aswad, Abu Musa Ashaari, and Sharhabeel ibn Hasana. A man named &#x27;Abhala ibn Ka&#x27;ab Al-Ansi expelled the remaining Persians and claimed he was a prophet of Rahman. He was assassinated by a Yemeni of Persian origin called Fayruz al-Daylami. Christians, who were mainly staying in Najran along with Jews, agreed to pay &quot;jizyah&quot; (), although some Jews converted to Islam, such as Wahb ibn Munabbih and Ka&#x27;ab al-Ahbar.

Yemen was stable during the Rashidun Caliphate. Yemeni tribes played a pivotal role in the Islamic expansion into Egypt, Iraq, Persia, the Levant, Anatolia, North Africa, Sicily, and Andalusia. Yemeni tribes who settled in Syria contributed significantly to the solidification of Umayyad rule, especially during the reign of Marwan I. Powerful Yemenite tribes such as Kinda were on his side during the Battle of Marj Rahit.

Muhammad ibn Abdullah ibn Ziyad founded the Ziyadid dynasty in Tihamah around 818. The state stretched from Haly (in present-day Saudi Arabia) to Aden. They nominally recognized the Abbasid Caliphate but ruled independently from Zabid. By virtue of its location, they developed a special relationship with Abyssinia. The chief of the Dahlak islands exported slaves, as well as amber and leopard hides, to the ruler of Yemen. They controlled only a small portion of the coastal strip in Tihamah along the Red Sea, and never exercised control over the highlands and Hadhramaut. A Himyarite clan called the Yufirids established their rule over the highlands from Saada to Taiz, while Hadhramaut was an Ibadi stronghold and rejected all allegiance to the Abbasids in Baghdad.

The first Zaidi imam, Yahya ibn al-Husayn, arrived in Yemen in 893. He was a religious cleric and judge who was invited to come to Saada from Medina to arbitrate tribal disputes. Yahya persuaded local tribesmen to follow his teachings. The sect slowly spread across the highlands, as the tribes of Hashid and Bakil, later known as &quot;the twin wings of the imamate&quot;, accepted his authority. He founded the Zaidi imamate in 897. Yahya established his influence in Saada and Najran. He also tried to capture Sana&#x27;a from the Yufirids in 901 but failed miserably.

==== Sulayhid dynasty (1047–1138) ====
The Sulayhid dynasty was founded in the northern highlands around 1040; at the time, Yemen was ruled by different local dynasties. In 1060, Ali ibn Muhammad Al-Sulayhi conquered Zabid and killed its ruler Al-Najah, founder of the Najahid dynasty. His sons were forced to flee to Dahlak. Hadhramaut fell into Sulayhid hands after their capture of Aden in 1162.

By 1063, Ali had subjugated Greater Yemen. He then marched toward Hejaz and occupied Makkah. Ali was married to Asma bint Shihab, who governed Yemen with her husband. The Khutba during Friday prayers was proclaimed in both her husband&#x27;s name and hers. No other Arab woman had this honor since the advent of Islam.

Ali al-Sulayhi was killed by Najah&#x27;s sons on his way to Mecca in 1084. His son Ahmed Al-Mukarram led an army to Zabid and killed 8,000 of its inhabitants. He later installed the Zurayids to govern Aden. al-Mukarram, who had been afflicted with facial paralysis resulting from war injuries, retired in 1087 and handed over power to his wife Arwa al-Sulayhi. Queen Arwa moved the seat of the Sulayhid dynasty from Sana&#x27;a to Jibla, a small town in central Yemen near Ibb. She sent Ismaili missionaries to India, where a significant Ismaili community was formed that exists to this day.

Queen Arwa continued to rule securely until her death in 1138. She is still remembered as a great and much-loved sovereign, as attested in Yemeni historiography, literature, and popular lore, where she is referred to as &quot;Balqis al-sughra&quot; (&quot;the junior queen of Sheba&quot;). Shortly after Arwa&#x27;s death, the country was split between five competing petty dynasties along religious lines. The Ayyubid dynasty overthrew the Fatimid Caliphate in Egypt. A few years after their rise to power, Saladin dispatched his brother Turan Shah to conquer Yemen in 1174.

==== Ayyubid conquest (1171–1260) ====

Turan Shah conquered Zabid from the Mahdids in 1174, then marched toward Aden in June and captured it from the Zurayids. The Hamdanid sultans of Sana&#x27;a resisted the Ayyubid in 1175, and the Ayyubids did not manage to secure Sana&#x27;a until 1189. The Ayyubid rule was stable in southern and central Yemen, where they succeeded in eliminating the ministates of that region, while Ismaili and Zaidi tribesmen continued to hold out in several fortresses.

The Ayyubids failed to capture the Zaydis stronghold in northern Yemen. In 1191, Zaydis of Shibam Kawkaban rebelled and killed 700 Ayyubid soldiers. Imam Abdullah bin Hamza proclaimed the imamate in 1197 and fought al-Mu&#x27;izz Ismail, the Ayyubid Sultan of Yemen. Imam Abdullah was defeated at first but was able to conquer Sana&#x27;a and Dhamar in 1198, and al-Mu&#x27;izz Ismail was assassinated in 1202.

Abdullah bin Hamza carried on the struggle against the Ayyubid until his death in 1217. After his demise, the Zaidi community was split between two rival imams. The Zaydis were dispersed, and a truce was signed with the Ayyubid in 1219. The Ayyubid army was defeated in Dhamar in 1226. Ayyubid Sultan Mas&#x27;ud Yusuf left for Mecca in 1228, never to return. Other sources suggest that he was forced to leave for Egypt instead in 1223.

==== Rasulid dynasty (1229–1454) ====
The Rasulid dynasty was established in 1229 by Umar ibn Rasul, who was appointed deputy governor by the Ayyubids in 1223. When the last Ayyubid ruler left Yemen in 1229, Umar stayed in the country as caretaker. He subsequently declared himself an independent king by assuming the title &quot;al-Malik Al-Mansur&quot; (the king assisted by Allah).

Umar first established himself at Zabid, then moved into the mountainous interior, taking the important highland centre Sana&#x27;a. However, the Rasulid capitals were Zabid and Taiz. He was assassinated by his nephew in 1249. Omar&#x27;s son Yousef defeated the faction led by his father&#x27;s assassins and crushed several counterattacks by the Zaydi imams who still held on in the northern highland. Mainly because of the victories he scored over his rivals, he assumed the honorific title &quot;al-Muzaffar&quot; (the victorious).

After the fall of Baghdad to the Mongols in 1258, al-Muzaffar Yusuf I appropriated the title of caliph. He chose the city of Taiz to become the political capital of the kingdom because of its strategic location and proximity to Aden. The Rasulid sultans built numerous Madrasas to solidify the Shafi&#x27;i school of thought, which is still the dominant school of jurisprudence amongst Yemenis today. Under their rule, Taiz and Zabid became major international centres of Islamic learning. The kings were educated men in their own right, who not only had important libraries but also wrote treatises on a wide array of subjects, ranging from astrology and medicine to agriculture and genealogy.They had a difficult relationship with the Mamluks of Egypt because the latter considered them a vassal state. Their competition centred over the Hejaz and the right to provide &quot;kiswa&quot; of the Ka&#x27;aba in Mecca. The dynasty became increasingly threatened by disgruntled family members over the problem of succession, combined with periodic tribal revolts, as they were locked in a war of attrition with the Zaydi imams in the northern highlands. During the last 12 years of Rasulid rule, the country was torn between several contenders for the kingdom. The weakening of the Rasulid provided an opportunity for the Banu Taher clan to take over and establish themselves as the new rulers of Yemen in 1454 AD.

==== Tahirid dynasty (1454–1517) ====

The Tahirids were a local clan based in Rada&#x27;a. They built schools, mosques, and irrigation channels, as well as water cisterns and bridges in Zabid, Aden, Rada&#x27;a, and Juban. Their best-known monument is the Amiriya Madrasa in Rada&#x27; District, which was built in 1504. The Tahirids were too weak either to contain the Zaydi imams or to defend themselves against foreign attacks.

Realizing how rich the Tahirid realm was, the Mamluks decided to conquer it. The Mamluk army, with the support of forces loyal to Zaydi Imam Al-Mutawakkil Yahya Sharaf ad-Din, conquered the entire Tahirid realm but failed to capture Aden in 1517. The Mamluk victory was short-lived. The Ottoman Empire conquered Egypt, hanging the last Mamluk Sultan in Cairo. The Ottomans had not decided to conquer Yemen until 1538. The Zaydi highland tribes emerged as national heroes by offering stiff, vigorous resistance to the Turkish occupation. The Mamluks tried to attach Yemen to Egypt and the Portuguese led by Afonso de Albuquerque, occupied the island of Socotra and made an unsuccessful attack on Aden in 1513.

=== Portuguese ===

Starting in the 15th century, Portugal intervened, dominating the port of Aden for about 20 years and maintaining a fortified enclave on the island of Socotra during this period. From the 16th century, the Portuguese posed an immediate threat to Indian Ocean trade. The Mamluks therefore sent an army under Hussein al-Kurdi to fight the intruders The Mamluk sultan went to Zabid in 1515 and entered into diplomatic talks with the Tahiri sultan &#x27;Amir bin Abdulwahab for money that would be needed for the jihad against the Portuguese. Instead of confronting them, the Mamluks, who were running out of food and water, landed on the coast of Yemen and began harassing the villagers of Tihamah to obtain the supplies they needed.

The interest of Portugal on the Red Sea consisted on the one hand of guaranteeing contacts with a Christian ally in Ethiopia and on the other of being able to attack Mecca and the Arab territories from the rear, while still having absolute dominance over trade of spices, the main intention was to dominate the commerce of the cities on the coast of Africa and Arabia. To this end, Portugal sought to influence and dominate by force or persuasion all the ports and kingdoms that fought among themselves. It was common for Portugal to keep under its influence the Arab allies that were interested in maintaining independence from other Arab states in the region.

=== Modern history ===
==== The Zaydis and Ottomans ====

The Ottomans had two fundamental interests to safeguard in Yemen: The Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina, and the trade route with India in spices and textiles—both threatened, and the latter virtually eclipsed, by the arrival of the Portuguese in the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea in the early 16th century. Hadım Suleiman Pasha, the Ottoman governor of Egypt, was ordered to command a fleet of 90 ships to conquer Yemen. The country was in a state of incessant anarchy and discord as Pasha described it by saying:

Imam al-Mutawakkil Yahya Sharaf ad-Din ruled over the northern highlands including Sana&#x27;a, while Aden was held by the last Tahiride Sultan &#x27;Amir ibn Dauod. Pasha stormed Aden in 1538, killing its ruler, and extended Ottoman authority to include Zabid in 1539 and eventually Tihamah in its entirety. Zabid became the administrative headquarters of Yemen Eyalet. The Ottoman governors did not exercise much control over the highlands. They held sway mainly in the southern coastal region, particularly around Zabid, Mocha, and Aden. Of 80,000 soldiers sent to Yemen from Egypt between 1539 and 1547, only 7,000 survived. The Ottoman accountant-general in Egypt remarked:

The Ottomans sent yet another expeditionary force to Zabid in 1547, while Imam al-Mutawakkil Yahya Sharaf ad-Din was ruling the highlands independently. Yahya chose his son Ali to succeed him, a decision that infuriated his other son al-Mutahhar ibn Yahya. Al-Mutahhar was lame, so he was not qualified for the imamate. He urged Oais Pasha, the Ottoman colonial governor in Zabid, to attack his father. Indeed, Ottoman troops supported by tribal forces loyal to Imam al-Mutahhar stormed Taiz and marched north toward Sana&#x27;a in August 1547. The Turks officially made Imam al-Mutahhar a &quot;Sanjak-bey&quot; with authority over &#x27;Amran. Imam al-Mutahhar assassinated the Ottoman colonial governor and recaptured Sana&#x27;a, but the Ottomans, led by Özdemir Pasha, forced al-Mutahhar to retreat to his fortress in Thula. Özdemir Pasha effectively put Yemen under Ottoman rule between 1552 and 1560. Özdemir died in Sana&#x27;a in 1561 and was succeeded by Mahmud Pasha.

Mahmud Pasha was described by other Ottoman officials as a corrupt and unscrupulous governor, and he was displaced by Ridvan Pasha in 1564. By 1565, Yemen was split into two provinces, the highlands under the command of Ridvan Pasha and Tihamah under Murad Pasha. Imam al-Mutahhar launched a propaganda campaign in which he claimed that the prophet Mohammed came to him in a dream and advised him to wage &quot;jihad&quot; against the Ottomans. Al-Mutahhar led the tribes to capture Sana&#x27;a from Ridvan Pasha in 1567. When Murad tried to relieve Sana&#x27;a, highland tribesmen ambushed his unit and slaughtered all of them. Over 80 battles were fought. The last decisive encounter took place in Dhamar around 1568, in which Murad Pasha was beheaded and his head sent to al-Mutahhar in Sana&#x27;a. By 1568, only Zabid remained under the possession of the Turks.

In 1632, Al-Mu&#x27;ayyad Muhammad sent an expeditionary force of 1,000 men to conquer Mecca. The army entered the city in triumph and killed its governor. The Ottomans sent an army from Egypt to fight the Yemenites. Seeing that the Turkish army was too numerous to overcome, the Yemeni army retreated to a valley outside Mecca. Ottoman troops attacked the Yemenis by hiding at the wells that supplied them with water. This plan proceeded successfully, causing the Yemenis over 200 casualties, most from thirst. The tribesmen eventually surrendered and returned to Yemen. Al-Mu&#x27;ayyad Muhammad died in 1644. He was succeeded by Al-Mutawakkil Isma&#x27;il, another son of al-Mansur al-Qasim, who conquered Yemen in its entirety.

Yemen became the sole coffee producer in the world. The country established diplomatic relations with the Safavid dynasty of Persia, Ottomans of Hejaz, Mughal Empire in India, and Ethiopia, as well. In the first half of the 18th century, the Europeans broke Yemen&#x27;s monopoly on coffee by smuggling coffee trees and cultivating them in their own colonies in the East Indies, East Africa, the West Indies, and Latin America. The imamate did not follow a cohesive mechanism for succession, and family quarrels and tribal insubordination led to the political decline of the Qasimi dynasty in the 18th century.

==== Great Britain and the nine regions ====

The British were looking for a coal depot to service their steamers en route to India. It took 700 tons of coal for a round-trip from Suez to Bombay. East India Company officials decided on Aden. The British Empire tried to reach an agreement with the Zaydi imam of Sana&#x27;a, permitting them a foothold in Mocha, and when unable to secure their position, they extracted a similar agreement from the Sultan of Lahej, enabling them to consolidate a position in Aden. The British managed to occupy Aden and evicted the Sultan of Lahej from Aden and forced him to accept their &quot;protection&quot;. In November 1839, 5,000 tribesmen tried to retake the town but were repulsed and 200 were killed.

With emigrants from India, East Africa, and Southeast Asia, Aden grew into a world city. In 1850, only 980 Arabs were registered as original inhabitants of the city. The English presence in Aden put them at odds with the Ottomans. The Turks asserted to the British that they held sovereignty over the whole of Arabia, including Yemen as the successor of Mohammed and the Chief of the Universal Caliphate.

==== Ottoman return ====
The Ottomans were concerned about the British expansion from the British ruled subcontinent to the Red Sea and Arabia. They returned to the Tihamah in 1849 after an absence of two centuries. Rivalries and disturbances continued among the Zaydi imams, between them and their deputies, with the ulema, with the heads of tribes, as well as with those who belonged to other sects. Some citizens of Sana&#x27;a were desperate to return law and order to Yemen and asked the Ottoman Pasha in Tihamah to pacify the country. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 strengthened the Ottoman decision to remain in Yemen. By 1873, the Ottomans succeeded in conquering the northern highlands. Sana&#x27;a became the administrative capital of Yemen Vilayet.

The Ottomans learned from their previous experience and worked on the disempowerment of local lords in the highland regions. They even attempted to secularize the Yemeni society, while Yemenite Jews came to perceive themselves in Yemeni nationalist terms. The Ottomans appeased the tribes by forgiving their rebellious chiefs and appointing them to administrative posts. They introduced a series of reforms to enhance the country&#x27;s economic welfare. However, corruption was widespread in the Ottoman administration in Yemen. This was because only the worst of the officials were appointed because those who could avoid serving in Yemen did so. The Ottomans had reasserted control over the highlands for a temporary duration. The so-called &quot;Tanzimat&quot; reforms were considered heretic by the Zaydi tribes. In 1876, the Hashid and Bakil tribes rebelled against the Ottomans; the Turks had to appease them with gifts to end the uprising.

The tribal chiefs were difficult to appease and an endless cycle of violence curbed Ottoman efforts to pacify the land. Ahmed Izzet Pasha proposed that the Ottoman army evacuate the highlands and confine itself to Tihamah, and not unnecessarily burden itself with continuing military operation against the Zaydi tribes. Imam Yahya Hamidaddin led a rebellion against the Turks in 1904; the rebels disrupted the Ottoman ability to govern. The revolts between 1904 and 1911 were especially damaging to the Ottomans, costing them as many as 10,000 soldiers and as much as 500,000 pounds per year. The Ottomans signed a treaty with imam Yahya Hamidaddin in 1911. Under the treaty, Imam Yahya was recognized as an autonomous leader of the Zaydi northern highlands. The Ottomans continued to rule Shafi&#x27;i areas in the mid-south until their departure in 1918.

==== Mutawakkilite Kingdom ====

Imam Yahya hamid ed-Din al-Mutawakkil was ruling the northern highlands independently from 1911, from which he began a conquest of the Yemen lands. In 1925 Yahya captured al-Hudaydah from the Idrisids. In 1927, Yahya&#x27;s forces were about away from Aden, Taiz, and Ibb, and were bombed by the British for five days; the imam had to pull back. Small Bedouin forces, mainly from the Madh&#x27;hij confederation of Marib, attacked Shabwah but were bombed by the British and had to retreat.

The Italian Empire was the first to recognize Yahya as the king of Yemen in 1926. This created a great deal of anxiety for the British, who interpreted it as recognition of Imam Yahya&#x27;s claim to sovereignty over Greater Yemen, which included the Aden protectorate and Asir. The Idrisis turned to Ibn Saud seeking his protection from Yahya. However, in 1932, the Idrisis broke their accord with Ibn Saud and went back to Yahya seeking help against Ibn Saud, who had begun liquidating their authority and expressed his desire to annex those territories into his own Saudi domain. Yahya demanded the return of all Idrisi dominion.

Negotiations between Yahya and Ibn Saud proved fruitless. After the 1934 Saudi-Yemeni war, Ibn Saud announced a ceasefire in May 1934. Imam Yahya agreed to release Saudi hostages and the surrender of the Idrisis to Saudi custody. Imam Yahya ceded the three provinces of Najran, Asir, and Jazan for 20 years. and signed another treaty with the British government in 1934. The imam recognized the British sovereignty over Aden protectorate for 40 years. Out of fear for Hudaydah, Yahya did submit to these demands.

==== Colonial Aden ====

Starting in 1890, hundreds of Yemeni people from Hajz, Al-Baetha, and Taiz migrated to Aden to work at ports, and as labourers. This helped the population of Aden once again become predominantly Arab after, having been declared a free zone, it had become mostly foreigners. During World War II, Aden had increasing economic growth and became the second-busiest port in the world after New York City. After the rise of labour unions, a rift was apparent between the sectors of workers and the first signs of resistance to the occupation started in 1943. Muhammad Ali Luqman founded the first Arabic club and school in Aden, and was the first to start working towards a union.

The Colony of Aden was divided into an eastern colony and a western colony. Those were further divided into 23 sultanates and emirates, and several independent tribes that had no relationships with the sultanates. The deal between the sultanates and Britain detailed protection and complete control of foreign relations by the British. The Sultanate of Lahej was the only one in which the sultan was referred to as &quot;His Highness&quot;. The Federation of South Arabia was created by the British to counter Arab nationalism by giving more freedom to the rulers of the nations.

The North Yemen Civil War inspired many in the south to rise against the British rule. The National Liberation Front (NLF) of Yemen was formed with the leadership of Qahtan Muhammad Al-Shaabi. The NLF hoped to destroy all the sultanates and eventually unite with the Yemen Arab Republic. Most of the support for the NLF came from Radfan and Yafa, so the British launched Operation Nutcracker, which completely burned Radfan in January 1964.

==== Two states ====

Arab nationalism had an influence in some circles who opposed the lack of modernization efforts in the Mutawakkilite monarchy. This became apparent when Imam Ahmad bin Yahya died in 1962. He was succeeded by his son, but army officers attempted to seize power, sparking the North Yemen Civil War. The Hamidaddin royalists were supported by Saudi Arabia, Britain, and Jordan (mostly with weapons and financial aid, but also with small military forces), whilst the military rebels were backed by Egypt. Egypt provided the rebels with weapons and financial assistance, but also sent a large military force to participate in the fighting. Israel covertly supplied weapons to the royalists to keep the Egyptian military busy in Yemen and make Nasser less likely to initiate a conflict in the Sinai.
After six years of civil war, the military rebels formed the Yemen Arab Republic.
The revolution in the north coincided with the Aden Emergency, which hastened the end of British rule in the south. On 30 November 1967, the state of South Yemen was formed, comprising Aden and the former Protectorate of South Arabia. This socialist state was later officially known as the People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Yemen and a programme of nationalisation was begun.
Relations between the two Yemeni states fluctuated between peaceful and hostile. The South was supported by the Eastern bloc. The North, however, was not able to get the same connections. In 1972, the two states fought a war. The war was resolved with a ceasefire and negotiations brokered by the Arab League, where it was declared that unification would eventually occur. In 1978, Ali Abdullah Saleh was named as president of the Yemen Arab Republic.
After the war, the North complained about the South&#x27;s help from foreign countries. This included Saudi Arabia.

In 1979, fresh fighting between the two states resumed and efforts were renewed to bring about unification. Thousands were killed in 1986 in the South Yemen Civil War. President Ali Nasser Muhammad fled to the north and was later sentenced to death for treason. A new government formed.

==== Unification and civil war ====
In 1990, the two governments reached a full agreement on the joint governing of Yemen, and the countries were merged on 22 May 1990, with Saleh as president. The president of South Yemen, Ali Salim al-Beidh, became vice president. A unified parliament was formed and a unity constitution was agreed upon. In the 1993 parliamentary election, the first held after unification, the General People&#x27;s Congress won 122 of 301 seats.

After the invasion of Kuwait crisis in 1990, Yemen&#x27;s president opposed military intervention from non-Arab states. As a member of the United Nations Security Council for 1990 and 1991, Yemen abstained on a number of UNSC resolutions concerning Iraq and Kuwait and voted against the &quot;...use of force resolution.&quot; The vote outraged the U.S., and Saudi Arabia expelled 800,000 Yemenis in 1990 and 1991 to punish Yemen for its opposition to the intervention.
In the absence of strong state institutions, elite politics in Yemen constituted a &quot;de facto&quot; form of collaborative governance, where competing tribal, regional, religious, and political interests agreed to hold themselves in check through tacit acceptance of the balance it produced. The informal political settlement was held together by a power-sharing deal among three men: President Saleh, who controlled the state; major general Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar, who controlled the largest share of the Yemeni Armed Forces; and Abdullah ibn Husayn al-Ahmar, figurehead of the Islamist al-Islah party and Saudi Arabia&#x27;s chosen broker of transnational patronage payments to various political players, including tribal sheikhs. The Saudi payments have been intended to facilitate the tribes&#x27; autonomy from the Yemeni government and to give the Saudi government a mechanism with which to weigh in on Yemen&#x27;s political decision-making.

Following food riots in major towns in 1992, a new coalition government made up of the ruling parties from both the former Yemeni states was formed in 1993. However, Vice President al-Beidh withdrew to Aden in August 1993 and said he would not return to the government until his grievances were addressed. These included northern violence against his Yemeni Socialist Party, as well as the economic marginalization of the south. Negotiations to end the political deadlock dragged on into 1994. The government of Prime Minister Haydar Abu Bakr Al-Attas became ineffective due to political infighting.

An accord between northern and southern leaders was signed in Amman, Jordan on 20 February 1994, but this could not stop the civil war. During these tensions, both the northern and southern armies (which had never integrated) gathered on their respective frontiers.

=== Contemporary Yemen ===
Ali Abdullah Saleh became Yemen&#x27;s first directly elected president in the 1999 presidential election, winning 96% of the vote. The only other candidate, Najeeb Qahtan Al-Sha&#x27;abi, was the son of Qahtan Muhammad al-Sha&#x27;abi, a former president of South Yemen. Though a member of Saleh&#x27;s General People&#x27;s Congress (GPC) party, Najeeb ran as an independent.

In October 2000, 17 U.S. personnel died after an al-Qaeda suicide attack on the U.S. naval vessel USS &quot;Cole&quot; in Aden. After the September 11 attacks on the United States, President Saleh assured U.S. President George W. Bush that Yemen was a partner in his War on Terror. In 2001, violence surrounded a referendum, which apparently supported extending Saleh&#x27;s rule and powers.

The Houthi insurgency in Yemen began in June 2004 when dissident cleric Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi, head of the Zaidi Shia sect, launched an uprising against the Yemeni government. The Yemeni government alleged that the Houthis were seeking to overthrow it and to implement &quot;Shī&#x27;ite&quot; religious law. The rebels countered that they were &quot;defending their community against discrimination&quot; and government aggression. In 2005, at least 36 people were killed in clashes across the country between police and protesters over rising fuel prices. In the 2006 presidential election, Saleh won with 77% of the vote. His main rival, Faisal bin Shamlan, received 22%. Saleh was sworn in for another term on 27 September.

A suicide bomber killed eight Spanish tourists and two Yemenis in the Marib Governorate in July 2007. A series of bomb attacks occurred on police, official, diplomatic, foreign business, and tourism targets in 2008. Car bombings outside the U.S. embassy in Sana&#x27;a killed 18 people, including six of the assailants in September 2008. In 2008, an opposition rally in Sana&#x27;a demanding electoral reform was met with police gunfire.

=== Revolution and aftermath ===

The 2011 Yemeni revolution followed other Arab Spring mass protests in early 2011. The uprising was initially against unemployment, economic conditions, and corruption, as well as against the government&#x27;s proposals to modify the constitution of Yemen so that Saleh&#x27;s son could inherit the presidency.

In March 2011, police snipers opened fire on a pro-democracy camp in Sana&#x27;a, killing more than 50 people. In May, dozens were killed in clashes between troops and tribal fighters in Sana&#x27;a. By this point, Saleh began to lose international support. In October 2011, Yemeni human rights activist Tawakul Karman won the Nobel Peace Prize, and the UN Security Council condemned the violence and called for a transfer of power. On 23 November 2011, Saleh flew to Riyadh, in neighbouring Saudi Arabia, to sign the Gulf Co-operation Council plan for political transition, which he had previously spurned. Upon signing the document, he agreed to legally transfer the office and powers of the presidency to his deputy, Vice President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi.

Hadi took office for a two-year term upon winning the uncontested presidential elections in February 2012. A unity government—including a prime minister from the opposition—was formed. Al-Hadi would oversee the drafting of a new constitution, followed by parliamentary and presidential elections in 2014. Saleh returned in February 2012. In the face of objections from thousands of street protesters, parliament granted him full immunity from prosecution. Saleh&#x27;s son, General Ahmed Ali Abdullah Saleh, continues to exercise a strong hold on sections of the military and security forces.

AQAP claimed responsibility for a February 2012 suicide attack on the presidential palace that killed 26 Republican Guards on the day that President Hadi was sworn in. AQAP was also behind a suicide bombing that killed 96 soldiers in Sana&#x27;a three months later. In September 2012, a car bomb attack in Sana&#x27;a killed 11 people, a day after a local al-Qaeda leader Said al-Shihri was reported killed in the south.

By 2012, there was a &quot;small contingent of U.S. special-operations troops&quot;—in addition to CIA and &quot;unofficially acknowledged&quot; U.S. military presence—in response to increasing terror attacks by AQAP on Yemeni citizens. Many analysts have pointed out the former Yemeni government role in cultivating terrorist activity in the country. Following the election of President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi, the Yemeni military was able to push Ansar al-Sharia back and recapture the Shabwah Governorate.
The central government in Sana&#x27;a remained weak, staving off challenges from southern separatists and Houthis as well as AQAP. The Houthi insurgency intensified after Hadi took power, escalating in September 2014 as anti-government forces led by Abdul-Malik al-Houthi swept into the capital and forced Hadi to agree to a &quot;unity&quot; government. The Houthis then refused to participate in the government, although they continued to apply pressure on Hadi and his ministers, even shelling the president&#x27;s private residence and placing him under house arrest, until the government&#x27;s mass resignation in January 2015. The following month, the Houthis dissolved parliament and declared that a Revolutionary Committee under Mohammed Ali al-Houthi was the interim authority in Yemen. Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, a cousin of the acting president, called the takeover a &quot;glorious revolution&quot;. However, the &quot;constitutional declaration&quot; of 6 February 2015 was widely rejected by opposition politicians and foreign governments, including the United Nations.

Hadi managed to flee from Sana&#x27;a to Aden, his hometown and stronghold in the south, on 21 February 2015. He promptly gave a televised speech rescinding his resignation, condemning the coup, and calling for recognition as the constitutional president of Yemen. The following month, Hadi declared Aden Yemen&#x27;s &quot;temporary&quot; capital. The Houthis, however, rebuffed an initiative by the Gulf Cooperation Council and continued to move south toward Aden. All U.S. personnel were evacuated, and President Hadi was forced to flee the country to Saudi Arabia. On 26 March 2015, Saudi Arabia announced Operation Decisive Storm and began airstrikes and announced its intentions to lead a military coalition against the Houthis, who they claimed were being aided by Iran and began a force buildup along the Yemeni border. The coalition included the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Jordan, Morocco, Sudan, Egypt, and Pakistan. The United States announced that it was assisting with intelligence, targeting, and logistics. After Hadi troops took control of Aden from Houthis, jihadist groups became active in the city, and some terrorist incidents were linked to them such as Missionaries of Charity attack in Aden on 4 March 2016. In February 2018, Aden was seized by the UAE-backed separatist Southern Transitional Council.

Yemen has been suffering from a famine since 2016 as a result of the civil war. More than 50,000 children in Yemen died from starvation in 2017. Numerous commentators have condemned the Saudi-led coalition&#x27;s military campaign, including its blockade of Yemen, as genocide. The famine is being compounded by an outbreak of cholera that has affected more than one million people. The Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen and blockade of Yemen have contributed to the famine and cholera epidemic. The UN estimated that by the end of 2021, the war in Yemen would have caused over 377,000 deaths, and roughly 70% of deaths were children under age 5.

On 4 December 2017, deposed strongman and former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, accused of treason, was assassinated by Houthis whilst attempting to flee clashes near rebel-held Sana&#x27;a between Houthi and pro-Saleh forces. After losing the support of the Saudi-led coalition, Yemen&#x27;s President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi resigned, and the Presidential Leadership Council took power in April 2022.

Following the outbreak of the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, the Houthis began to fire missiles at Israel and attack ships off Yemen&#x27;s coast in the Red Sea, which they say is in solidarity with the Palestinians and aiming to facilitate entry of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip.

In June 2024, the UAE-backed STC were putting pressure to lease the Aden International Port to Abu Dhabi Ports. The move was opposed by the Parliament and the public. A joint statement by 24 members of Shura Council expressed categorical rejection of the lease agreement. Economists said the Emirates was attempting to control the Aden Port and limit its activities, in order to keep its own ports active. Governor of Aden, Tariq Salam also said the lease attempt aims to devalue the Aden Port and take its international maritime status. Aden International Port had ended its agreement to manage two container terminals with Dubai Ports World in 2012, due to economic decline and failure to fulfill commitments.

== Geography ==

Yemen covers and is located at the southern part of the Arabian Peninsula. It is bordered by Saudi Arabia to the north, the Red Sea to the west, the Gulf of Aden and Guardafui Channel to the south, and Oman to the east.

Several Red Sea islands, including the Hanish Islands, Kamaran, and Perim, as well as Socotra in the Arabian Sea, belong to Yemen; the largest of these is Socotra. Many of the islands are volcanic; Jabal al-Tair Island had volcanic eruptions in 1883 and 2007. Although mainland Yemen is in the southern Arabian Peninsula and thus part of Asia, and its Hanish Islands and Perim in the Red Sea are associated with Asia, the archipelago of Socotra, which lies east of the horn of Somalia and is much closer to Africa than to Asia, is geographically and biogeographically associated with Africa.

=== Regions and climate ===

Yemen can be divided geographically into four main regions: the coastal plains in the west, the western highlands, the eastern highlands, and the Rub&#x27; al Khali in the east. The Tihamah (&quot;hot lands&quot; or &quot;hot earth&quot;) form a very arid and flat coastal plain along Yemen&#x27;s entire Red Sea coastline. Despite the aridity, the presence of many lagoons makes this region very marshy and a suitable breeding ground for malaria-borne mosquitos. Extensive crescent-shaped sand dunes are present. The evaporation in the Tihamah is so great that streams from the highlands never reach the sea, but they do contribute to extensive groundwater reserves. Today, these are heavily exploited for agricultural use.
Near the village of Madar about north of Sana&#x27;a, dinosaur footprints were found, indicating that the area was once a muddy flat. The Tihamah ends abruptly at the escarpment of the western highlands. This area, now heavily terraced to meet the demand for food, receives the highest rainfall in Arabia, rapidly increasing from per year to about in Taiz and over in Ibb. Temperatures are warm in the day but fall dramatically at night.

The central highlands are an extensive high plateau over in elevation. This area is drier than the western highlands because of rain-shadow influences, but still receives sufficient rain in wet years for extensive cropping. Water storage allows for irrigation and the growing of wheat and barley. Sana&#x27;a is in this region. The highest point in Yemen and Arabia is Jabal An-Nabi Shu&#x27;ayb, at about .

Yemen&#x27;s portion of the Rub al Khali desert in the east is much lower, generally below , and receives almost no rain. It is populated only by Bedouin herders of camels.
=== Biodiversity ===

Yemen contains six terrestrial ecoregions: Arabian Peninsula coastal fog desert, Socotra Island xeric shrublands, Southwestern Arabian foothills savanna, Southwestern Arabian montane woodlands, Arabian Desert, and Red Sea Nubo-Sindian tropical desert and semi-desert. The flora is a mixture of the tropical African, Sudanian plant geographical region and the Saharo-Arabian region. The Sudanian element—characterized by relatively high rainfall—dominates the western mountains and parts of the highland plains. The Saharo-Arabian element dominates in the coastal plains, eastern mountain, and the eastern and northern desert plains.

A high percentage of Yemen plants belong to tropical African plants of Sudanian regions. Among the Sudanian element species, the following may be mentioned: &quot;Ficus&quot; spp., &quot;Acacia mellifera, Grewia villosa, Commiphora&quot; spp., &quot;Rosa abyssinica&quot;, &quot;Cadaba farinosa&quot; and others. Among the Saharo-Arabian species, these may be mentioned: &quot;Panicum turgidum, Aerva javanica, Zygophyllum simplex, Fagonia indica, Salsola&quot; spp., &quot;Acacia tortilis, A. hamulos, A. ehrenbergiana, Phoenix dactylifera, Hyphaene thebaica, Capparis decidua, Salvadora persica, Balanites aegyptiaca&quot;, and many others. Many of the Saharo-Arabian species are endemic to the extensive sandy coastal plain (the Tihamah).

Among the fauna, the Arabian leopard, which would inhabit the mountains, is considered rare here.

== Culture ==

=== Media ===
Radio broadcasting in Yemen began in the 1940s. After unification in 1990, the government reformed its corporations and founded some additional radio stations that broadcast locally. However, it drew back after 1994, due to destroyed infrastructure resulting from the 1994 civil war.

Television is the most significant media platform. Given the low literacy rate in the country, television is the main source of news. There are six free-to-air channels currently headquartered in Yemen, of which four are state-owned. The Yemeni film industry is in its early stages; only eight Yemeni films have been released .

=== Theatre ===
Yemeni theatre dates to the early 20th century. Both amateur and professional (government-sponsored) theatre troupes perform in the country&#x27;s major urban centres. Many significant poets and authors, like Ali Ahmed Ba Kathir, Muhammad al-Sharafi, and Wajdi al-Ahdal, have written dramatic works; poems, novels, and short stories by Yemeni authors like Mohammad Abdul-Wali and Abdulaziz Al-Maqaleh have also been adapted for the stage.

There have been Yemeni productions of plays by Arab authors such as Tawfiq al-Hakim and Saadallah Wannous and by Western authors, including Shakespeare, Pirandello, Brecht, and Tennessee Williams. Historically speaking, Aden is the cradle of Yemeni theatre; in recent decades Sana&#x27;a has hosted numerous theatre festivals, often in conjunction with World Theatre Day.

=== Sport ===

Football is the most popular sport. The Yemen Football Association is a member of FIFA and AFC. The Yemeni national football team participates internationally. The country also hosts many football clubs. They compete in the national and international leagues.

Yemen&#x27;s mountains provide many opportunities for outdoor sports, such as biking, rock climbing, trekking, hiking, and other more challenging sports, including mountain climbing. Mountain climbing and hiking tours to the Sarawat Mountains, including peaks of and above, particularly that of An-Nabi Shu&#x27;ayb, are seasonally organized by local and international alpine agencies. The coastal areas and Socotra provide many opportunities for water sports, such as surfing, bodyboarding, sailing, swimming, and scuba diving. Socotra is home to some of the best surfing destinations in the world.

Camel jumping is a traditional sport that is becoming increasingly popular among the Zaraniq tribe on the west coast. Camels are placed side to side and victory goes to the competitor who leaps, from a running start, over the most camels. Tribesmen (women may not compete) tuck their robes around their waists for freedom of movement while running and leaping.

Yemen&#x27;s biggest sports event was hosting the 20th Arabian Gulf Cup in Aden and Abyan in 2010. Yemen was defeated in the first three matches of the tournament.

=== World Heritage sites ===
Among its natural and cultural attractions are four World Heritage sites. The Old Walled City of Shibam in Wadi Hadhramaut, inscribed by UNESCO in 1982, two years after Yemen joined the World Heritage Committee, is nicknamed &quot;Manhattan of the Desert&quot; because of its skyscrapers. Surrounded by a fortified wall made of mud and straw, the 16th-century city is one of the oldest examples of urban planning based on the principle of vertical construction.

The Old City of Sana&#x27;a, at an altitude of more than , has been inhabited for over two and a half millennia, and was inscribed in 1986. Sana&#x27;a became a major Islamic centre in the seventh century, and the 103 mosques, 14 hammams (traditional bathhouses), and more than 6,000 houses that survive all date from before the 11th century.

Close to the Red Sea coast, the historic town of Zabid, inscribed in 1993, was Yemen&#x27;s capital from the 13th to the 15th century, and is an archaeological and historical site. It played an important role for many centuries because of its university, which was a centre of learning for the whole Arab and Islamic world.

The latest addition to Yemen&#x27;s list of World Heritage Sites is the Socotra Archipelago. Mentioned by Marco Polo in the 13th century, this remote and isolated archipelago consists of four islands and two rocky islets delineating the southern limit of the Gulf of Aden. The site has a rich biodiversity. Nowhere else in the world do 37% of Socotra&#x27;s 825 plants, 90% of its reptiles and 95% of its snails occur. It is home to 192 bird species, 253 species of coral, 730 species of coastal fish, and 300 species of crab and lobster, as well as the Dragon&#x27;s Blood Tree (&quot;Dracaena cinnabari&quot;). The cultural heritage of Socotra includes the unique Soqotri language.

== Politics ==


Yemen is a republic with a bicameral legislature. Under the 1991 constitution, an elected president, an elected 301-seat Assembly of Representatives, and an appointed 111-member Shura Council share power. The president is the head of state, and the prime minister is the head of government. In Sana&#x27;a, a Supreme Political Council (not recognized internationally) forms the government.

The 1991 constitution provides that the president be elected by popular vote from at least two candidates endorsed by at least 15 members of the Parliament. The prime minister, in turn, is appointed by the president and must be approved by two-thirds of the Parliament. The presidential term of office is seven years, and the parliamentary term of elected office is six years. Suffrage is universal for people aged 18 and older, but only Muslims may hold elected office.

President Ali Abdullah Saleh became the first elected president in reunified Yemen in 1999 (though he had been president of unified Yemen since 1990 and president of North Yemen since 1978). He was re-elected to office in September 2006. Saleh&#x27;s victory was marked by an election that international observers judged was &quot;partly free&quot;, though the election was accompanied by violence, violations of press freedoms, and allegations of fraud.
Parliamentary elections were held in April 2003, and the General People&#x27;s Congress maintained an absolute majority. Saleh remained almost uncontested in his seat of power until 2011, when local frustration at his refusal to hold another round of elections, as combined with the consequences of the 2011 Arab Spring, resulted in mass protests. In 2012, he was forced to resign from power, though he remained an important factor in Yemeni politics, allying with the Houthis during their takeover in the mid-2010s.

The constitution calls for an independent judiciary. The former northern and southern legal codes have been unified. The legal system includes separate commercial courts and a Supreme Court based in Sana&#x27;a. Sharia is the main source of laws, with many court cases being debated according to the religious basis of law and many judges being religious scholars as well as legal authorities. The Prison Authority Organization Act, Republican decree no. 48 (1981), and Prison Act regulations, provide the legal framework for management of the country&#x27;s prison system.

=== Foreign relations ===

Yemen is a member of the United Nations, the Arab League, and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, and also participates in the nonaligned movement. Yemen has acceded to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.
Since the end of the 1994 civil war, tangible progress has been made on the diplomatic front in restoring normal relations with Yemen&#x27;s neighbors. In the summer of 2000, Yemen and Saudi Arabia signed an International Border Treaty settling a 50-year-old dispute over the location of the border between the two countries. Yemen&#x27;s northern border had been undefined; the Arabian Desert prevented any human habitation there. The Saudi – Yemen barrier was constructed by Saudi Arabia against an influx of illegal immigrants and against the smuggling of drugs and weapons. &quot;The Independent&quot; headed an article with &quot;Saudi Arabia, one of the most vocal critics in the Arab world of Israel&#x27;s &quot;security fence&quot; in the West Bank, is quietly emulating the Israeli example by erecting a barrier along its porous border with Yemen.&quot;

In March 2020, the Trump administration and key U.S. allies, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, cut off tens of millions of dollars for health care programs and other aid to the United Nations&#x27; appeal for Yemen. As a result of funding cuts, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs stated that the UN agencies were forced to either close or reduce more than 75 per cent of its programs that year alone, affecting more than 8 million people. Saudi Arabia had been leading a Western-backed military coalition, including the United Arab Emirates as a key member, which intervened in Yemen in 2015, in a bid to restore the government ousted from power by the Houthi movement. The United Nations described the situation in Yemen, where the war killed tens of thousands of people and left millions on the brink of famine, as the world&#x27;s worst humanitarian crisis.

In January 2024, President Joe Biden announced that the United States, Britain and allies Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands had launched a military assault on Houthi militant targets in Yemen.

=== Military ===
The armed forces of Yemen include the Yemen Army (includes Republican Guard), Navy (includes Marines), Yemeni Air Force (Al Quwwat al Jawwiya al Yamaniya; includes Air Defense Force). A major reorganization of the armed forces continues. The unified air forces and air defenses are now under one command. The navy has concentration in Aden. Total armed forces manning numbers about 401,000 active personnel, including moreover especially conscripts.

The number of military personnel is relatively high; in sum, Yemen has the second largest military force on the Arabian Peninsula after Saudi Arabia. In 2012, total active troops were estimated as follows: army, 390,000; navy, 7,000; and air force, 5,000. In September 2007, the government announced the reinstatement of compulsory military service. Yemen&#x27;s defense budget, which in 2006 represented approximately 40 percent of the total government budget, is expected to remain high for the near term, as the military draft takes effect and internal security threats continue to escalate. By 2012, Yemen had 401,000 active personnel.

=== Human rights ===
Corruption in Yemen is such that it ranked 176 out of 180 countries in the 2022 Corruption Perceptions Index. The government and its security forces have been responsible for torture, inhumane treatment, and extrajudicial executions. There are arbitrary arrests of citizens, especially in the south, as well as arbitrary searches of homes. Prolonged pretrial detention is a serious problem, and judicial corruption, inefficiency, and executive interference undermine due process. Freedom of speech, the press, and religion are all restricted. Journalists critical of the government are often harassed and threatened by the police. Homosexuality is illegal, punishable by death.

Yemen is ranked last of 135 countries in the 2012 Global Gender Gap Report. Human Rights Watch reported on discrimination and violence against women as well as on the abolition of the minimum marriage age of 15 for women. The onset of puberty (interpreted by some to be as low as the age of nine) was set as a requirement for marriage instead. Publicity about the case of ten-year-old Yemeni divorcee Nujood Ali brought the child marriage issue to the forefront worldwide.

In 2017, the UN Human Rights Council voted to create a team of experts to investigate suspected breaches of humanitarian law and human rights in Yemen. In December 2021, The Guardian revealed, Saudi Arabia used &quot;incentives and threats&quot; as part of a pressure campaign to end a UN inquiry into human rights infringements in Yemen. In June 2020, a human rights group revealed the scale of torture and deaths in Yemen&#x27;s unofficial detention centres. UAE and Saudi forces were responsible for some of the most shocking treatment of prisoners, including being hung upside down for hours and sexual torture such as the burning of genitals.

According to 2020 United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) estimates, 6.1 million girls and women were in need of gender-based violence services. The UNFPA also reported a rise in gender-based violence cases amid COVID-19 pandemic, increase in rate of child marriages, most acutely among internally displaced persons (IDPs). One in five girls aged 10 to 19 were married in IDP camps, compared to 1 in 8 in host communities.

The United States Department of State 2013 &quot;Trafficking in Persons&quot; report classified Yemen as a Tier 3 country, meaning that its government does not fully comply with the minimum standards against human trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so. Yemen officially abolished slavery in Yemen in 1962, but it is still being practiced. On 22 June 2020, Human Rights Watch wrote an open letter to the UN Secretary-General on &quot;Children and Armed Conflict&quot; report to improve the protection of children in Yemen and in Myanmar. Amnesty said, United Nations Security Council must urgently fix its monitoring and reporting mechanism for children affected by armed conflict. On 14 September 2020, Human Rights Watch demanded an end to the interference caused by Houthi rebels and other authorities in Yemen aid operations, as millions of lives dependent on the aid operations were being put at risk.

=== Administrative divisions ===
Yemen is divided into twenty-one governorates (&quot;muhafazat&quot;) plus one municipality called &quot;Amanat Al-Asemah&quot; (the latter containing the constitutional capital, Sana&#x27;a). An additional governorate (Soqatra Governorate) was created in December 2013 comprising Socotra Island, previously part of Hadramaut Governorate. The governorates are subdivided into 333 districts (&quot;muderiah&quot;), which are subdivided into 2,210 sub-districts, and then into 38,284 villages (as of 2001).

In 2014, a constitutional panel decided to divide the country into six regions—four in the north, two in the south, and capital Sana&#x27;a outside of any region—creating a federalist model of governance. This federal proposal was a contributing factor toward the Houthis&#x27; subsequent coup d&#x27;état against the government.

== Economy ==


Since its unification in 1990, Yemen has been one of the poorest countries in the Middle East. Yemen had a GDP (PPP) of US$61.63 billion, with an income per capita of $2,500. Services are the largest economic sector (61.4% of GDP), followed by the industrial sector (30.9%), and agriculture (7.7%). Of these, petroleum production represents around 25% of GDP and 63% of the government&#x27;s revenue. After the start of the civil war in 2014, its GDP dropped rapidly by over 50%, thanks to the blockade led by Saudi Arabia and an effective embargo on oil exports imposed by the Houthis.

=== Agriculture ===
Principal agricultural commodities produced include grain, vegetables, fruits, pulses, qat, coffee, cotton, dairy products, fish, livestock (sheep, goats, cattle, camels), and poultry. Most Yemenis are employed in agriculture. However, the role of agricultural sector is limited by the relatively low share of the sector in GDP and the large share of net food-buying households (97%). Sorghum is the most common crop. Cotton and many fruit trees are also grown, with mangoes being the most valuable.

A big problem in Yemen is the cultivation of Khat (or qat), a psychoactive plant that releases a stimulant when chewed, and accounts for up to 40 percent of the water drawn from the Sana&#x27;a Basin each year, and that figure is rising. Some agricultural practices are drying the Sana&#x27;a Basin and displaced vital crops, which has resulted in increasing food prices. Rising food prices, in turn, pushed an additional six percent of the country into poverty in 2008 alone, and led to food riots starting in 2008 in poorer cities. Efforts are being made by the government and Dawoodi Bohra community at northern governorates to replace qat with coffee plantations.

=== Industry ===
The industrial sector is centred on crude oil production and petroleum refining, food processing, handicrafts, small-scale production of cotton textiles and leather goods, aluminum products, commercial ship repair, cement, and natural gas production. In 2013, Yemen had an industrial production growth rate of 4.8%. It also has large proven reserves of natural gas. Yemen&#x27;s first liquified natural gas plant began production in October 2009.

=== Export and import ===
In 2013, exports totaled $6.694 billion. The main export commodities are crude oil, coffee, dried and salted fish, liquefied natural gas. These products were mainly sent to China (41%), Thailand (19.2%), India (11.4%), and South Korea (4.4%). Imports totaled $10.97 billion. The main imported commodities are machinery and equipment, foodstuffs, livestock, and chemicals. These products were mainly imported from the EU (48.8%), UAE (9.8%), Switzerland (8.8%), China (7.4%), and India (5.8%).

=== State budget ===
, the government&#x27;s budget consisted of $7.769 billion in revenues and $12.31 billion in expenditures. Taxes and other revenues constituted roughly 17.7% of the GDP, with a budget deficit of 10.3%. The public debt was 47.1% of GDP. Yemen had reserves of foreign exchange and gold of around $5.538 billion in 2013. Its inflation rate over the same period based on consumer prices was 11.8%. The external debt totaled $7.806 billion. Yemen is missing some international support because, as of 2024, it is one of three countries which have not ratified the Paris Agreement to limit climate change.

=== Water supply and sanitation ===
A key challenge is severe water scarcity, especially in the Highlands, prompting &quot;The Times&quot;, in 2009, to write &quot;Yemen could become first nation to run out of water.&quot; A second key challenge is a high level of poverty, making it difficult to recover the costs of service provision. Access to water supply sanitation is low. Yemen is both the poorest country and the most water-scarce country in the Arab world. Third, the capacity of sector institutions to plan, build, operate and maintain infrastructure remains limited. Last but not least the security situation makes it even more difficult to improve or even maintain existing levels of service.

The average Yemeni has access to only 140 cubic meters of water per year (101 gallons per day) for all uses, while the Middle Eastern average is 1,000 m3/yr, and the internationally defined threshold for water stress is 1,700 cubic meters per year. Groundwater is the main source of water in the country, but the water tables have dropped severely leaving Yemen without a viable source of water. For example, in Sana&#x27;a, the water table was below surface in the 1970s but had dropped to below the surface by 2012. The groundwater has not been regulated by Yemen&#x27;s governments.

Even before the revolution, Yemen&#x27;s water situation had been described as increasingly dire by experts who worried that Yemen would be the first country to run out of water. In part due to the 2015 Yemeni civil war, the infrastructure required to build better access to water has been delayed in construction. It is estimated that as many as 80% of the population struggles to access water to drink and bathe. Bombing has forced many Yemenis to leave their homes for other areas, leaving wells in the new areas under increasing demands.

Together with partners, UNICEF has advanced its efforts and provided access to safe and sustained drinking water to 8.8 million people (5.3 million children). It scaled up its emergency WASH assistance in Yemen to ensure sustainable WASH services through capacity building of local WASH authorities, solarisation of water systems and rainwater harvesting.

== Demographics ==

Yemen&#x27;s population is million by estimates, with 46% of the population being under 15 years old and 2.7% above 65 years. In 1950, it was 4.3 million. By 2050, the population is estimated to increase to about 60 million. Yemen has a high total fertility rate, at 4.45 children per woman. Sana&#x27;a&#x27;s population has increased rapidly, from roughly 55,000 in 1978 to nearly 1 million in the early 21st century.

=== People ===
When the states of North and South Yemen were established, most resident minority groups departed. Yemen is a largely tribal society. There are also hereditary caste groups in urban areas such as Al-Akhdam. There are also Yemenis of Persian origin. According to Muqaddasi, Persians formed the majority of Aden&#x27;s population in the 10th century.

Yemenite Jews once formed a sizable minority with a distinct culture from other Jewish communities in the world. Most emigrated to Israel in the mid-20th century, following the Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries and Operation Magic Carpet. An estimated 100,000 people of Indian origin are concentrated in the southern part of the country, around Aden, Mukalla, Shihr, Lahaj, Mokha and Hodeidah.

Most of the prominent Indonesians, Malaysians, and Singaporeans of Arab descent are Hadhrami people with origins in southern Yemen in the Hadhramaut coastal region. Today there are almost 10,000 Hadramis in Singapore. The Hadramis migrated to Southeast Asia, East Africa and the Indian subcontinent.

The Maqil were a collection of Arab Bedouin tribes of Yemeni origin who migrated westwards via Egypt. Several groups of Yemeni Arabs turned south to Mauritania, and by the end of the 17th century, they dominated the entire country. They can also be found throughout Morocco and in Algeria as well as in other North African countries.

Yemen is the birthplace of the Arabs and the language; Qahtanite Arabs —the original Arabs — originated in Yemen. According to Arab tradition, Ishmael son of Abraham married a woman from the Jurhum tribe.

Yemen is the only country in the Arabian Peninsula that is signatory to two international accords dating back to 1951 and 1967 governing the protection of refugees. Yemen hosted a population of refugees and asylum seekers numbering approximately 124,600 in 2007. Refugees and asylum seekers were predominantly from Somalia (110,600), Iraq (11,000), Ethiopia (2,000), and Syria. Additionally, more than 334,000 Yemenis have been internally displaced by conflict. The Yemeni diaspora is largely concentrated in neighbouring Saudi Arabia, where between 800,000 and 1 million Yemenis reside, and the United Kingdom, home to between 70,000 and 80,000 Yemenis.

=== Languages ===
Modern Standard Arabic is the official language, while Yemeni Arabic is used as the vernacular. In al Mahrah Governorate in the far east and the island of Socotra, several non-Arabic languages are spoken. Yemeni Sign Language is used by the deaf community.

Yemen is part of the homeland of the South Semitic languages. Mehri is the largest South Semitic language spoken in the nation, with more than 70,000 speakers. The ethnic group is called Mahra. Soqotri is another South Semitic language, with speakers on the island of Socotra isolated from the pressures of Arabic on the Yemeni mainland. According to the 1990 census, the number of speakers was 57,000. Yemen was home of the Old South Arabian languages. The Razihi language appears to be the only remaining Old South Arabian language.

English is the most important foreign language, being widely taught and spoken mostly in the south, a former British protectorate.

=== Religion ===

Islam is the state religion. Religion in Yemen consists primarily of two Islamic religious groups. According to a UNHCR report, the Shia &quot;Zaydis make up about 45 percent of the population, Sunnis 53 percent and there are also tiny minorities of other Shia groups—the Ismaili and Twelver communities.&quot; Sunnis are primarily Shafi&#x27;i but also include significant groups of Malikis and Hanbalis. Shias are primarily Zaydi and also have significant minorities of Ismaili and Twelver Shias.

The Sunnis are predominantly in the south and southeast which traditionally have less population. The Zaidis/Shias are predominantly in the north and northwest where the vast majority of the Yemeni population traditionally lives whilst the Ismailis are in the main centres such as Sana&#x27;a and Ma&#x27;rib. There are mixed communities in the larger cities. According to WIN/Gallup International polls, Yemen has the highest share of the population identifying as religious among Arab countries, and one of the highest in the world.

About .05 percent of Yemenis are non-Muslim—adhering to Christianity, Judaism, or Hinduism or having no religious affiliation. Yemen is number five on Open Doors&#x27; 2022 World Watch List, an annual ranking of the 50 countries where Christians face the most extreme persecution. Estimates of the number of Christians in Yemen range from 25,000 to 41,000. A 2015 study estimates 400 Christians from a Muslim background reside in the country. There are approximately 50 or fewer Jews left in Yemen. Some 200 Yemeni Jews were brought to Israel by the Jewish Agency . According to a 2020 estimate, as few as 26 Jews remain in Yemen. However, in 2022 it was estimated that only one Yemeni Jew remained according to a United Nations report about the treatment of religious minorities in conflict zones; however, there are reportedly a handful of &quot;hidden Jews&quot; who have converted to Islam but secretly continue to practice Judaism.

=== Education ===

The adult literacy rate in 2010 was 64%. The government has committed to reduce illiteracy to less than 10% by 2025. Although the government provides for universal, compulsory, free education for children ages six through 15, the U.S. Department of State reports that compulsory attendance is not enforced. The government developed the National Basic Education Development Strategy in 2003 that aimed at providing education to 95% of children between the ages of six and 14 years and also at decreasing the gap between males and females in urban and rural areas.

A seven-year project to improve gender equity and the quality and efficiency of secondary education, focusing on girls in rural areas, was approved by the World Bank in March 2008. Following this, Yemen has increased its education spending from 5% of GDP in 1995 to 10% in 2005.

According to the Webometrics Ranking of World Universities, the top-ranking universities in the country are the Yemeni University of Science &amp; Technology (6532nd worldwide), Al Ahgaff University (8930th) and Sanaa University (11043rd). Yemen was ranked 131st in the Global Innovation Index in 2021, down from 129th in 2019.

=== Health ===

Despite the significant progress the government has made to expand and improve its health care system over the past decade, the system remains severely underdeveloped. Total expenditures on health care in 2002 constituted 3.7 percent of GDP. In that same year, the per capita expenditure for health care was very low, as compared with other Middle Eastern countries—US$58 according to United Nations statistics and US$23 according to the World Health Organization.

According to the World Bank, the number of doctors rose by an average of more than 7 percent between 1995 and 2000, but as of 2004, there were still only three doctors per 10,000 persons. In 2003, Yemen had only 0.6 hospital beds available per 1,000 persons. Health care services are particularly scarce in rural areas. Only 25 percent of rural areas are covered by health services, as compared with 80 percent of urban areas. Emergency services, such as ambulance service and blood banks, are non-existent.

<text>Den Watts is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot;, played by actor Leslie Grantham. He became well known for his tabloid nickname, &quot;Dirty Den&quot;. Den was the original landlord of The Queen Victoria public house from Albert Square who first appeared when the show debuted on 19 February 1985. From then onwards, the character had a turbulent marriage with his alcoholic first wife Angie (Anita Dobson).

In 1986, Den discovers that Angie lied to him about having six months to live and got revenge by giving her divorce papers on Christmas Day 1986, which was watched by over 30 million viewers. Den continued his close relationship with their adopted daughter Sharon (Letitia Dean). Den soon became involved in storylines that mostly contributed to the character&#x27;s magnanimous and &quot;bad boy&quot; persona, such as Den impregnating 16-year-old Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully) – which resulted in a long-standing feud with Michelle&#x27;s mother Pauline (Wendy Richard); teaming up with Pete Beale (Peter Dean) to force their enemy Nick Cotton (John Altman) out of Walford for causing trouble around the square; romancing with his mistress Jan Hammond (Jane How); and getting revenge on business rival James Willmott-Brown (William Boyde) for raping Pete&#x27;s wife Kathy (Gillian Taylforth). Grantham quit the series in 1988, and in February 1989, Den was apparently killed off after getting shot due to his involvement with The Firm.

Despite turning down several offers to return, Grantham reprised the role 14 years later in a highly publicised week in September 2003, where Sharon discovered that Den had survived his shooting and had fled to Spain afterwards. The development of Den&#x27;s return to the show was contributed with the introductions of his and Michelle&#x27;s daughter Vicki (Scarlett Alice Johnson) and his biological son Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman), and later Den&#x27;s second wife Chrissie (Tracy-Ann Oberman). His second stint on the programme saw Den repeatedly clash with Dennis over his romantic feelings for Sharon, and he later has sex with Dennis&#x27; girlfriend Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan) and gets her to lie that she is pregnant. Additionally, Den establishes a rivalry with Sharon&#x27;s ex-boyfriend Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) that ends with him framing the latter for armed robbery; forms a friendship with Dot Cotton (June Brown); has sex with Phil&#x27;s ex-wife Kate Morton (Jill Halfpenny) and his sister Sam (Kim Medcalf) as revenge; and cons Sam into relinquishing her ownership of The Queen Vic back to him. Grantham left in 2004, and Den was ultimately killed off for good on 18 February 2005, during the show&#x27;s 20th anniversary episode, when he is was fatally bludgeoned to death by Chrissie, which was watched by 14.34 million viewers.

==Storylines==
===1985–1989===
Den Watts and his wife Angie (Anita Dobson) are landlords of The Queen Victoria public house in Albert Square, Walford. They have been there since the 1970s. Married since 1968, Angie was unable to have children of her own, and in 1972 they adopted a three-year-old girl called Sharon. 

Den also has a mistress, Jan Hammond (Jane How). He gets Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully), the 16-year-old best friend of his adoptive daughter Sharon (Letitia Dean), pregnant – but she refuses to name the father, fearing repercussions for Den and herself. Den and Angie&#x27;s relationship starts to fall apart when she meets Jan, but when Angie attempts suicide, Den ends his relationship with Jan despite preferring it to be the other way around. When Michelle gives birth to their daughter, Vicki, she refuses to give Den any contact with her – though he financially supports Michelle in secret. For many years the secret is kept hidden but Michelle&#x27;s mother, Pauline (Wendy Richard), is one of the first to realise the truth, igniting a feud between her and Den, which intensifies when he admits to her in January 1988 that he is indeed Vicki&#x27;s father, and she slaps him in response.

Soon enough, Den plans to leave Angie permanently; hoping to stop him, Angie claims that she is dying and has only six months to live in October 1986. Den chooses to stay with her and tries to rebuild their relationship, promising to be there for her until her death. He takes Angie to Venice for a second honeymoon, but meets Jan, who is also there. Feeling guilty about her lie, Angie gets drunk on the way home via the Orient Express and admits to a barman that she is not dying, unaware that Den has overheard her drunken confession. He bides his time and gets revenge by serving her divorce papers on Christmas Day.

The couple&#x27;s divorce is finalised in 1987 and Angie damages Den by demanding a large divorce settlement. Den runs The Queen Vic alone, initially assisted by Jan, but this relationship ends when Jan grows disillusioned with Den&#x27;s treatment of her. Den has a fling with The Queen Vic&#x27;s caterer, Magda Czajkowski (Kathryn Apanowicz), but is scorned when she eventually opts to date the much younger Simon Wicks (Nick Berry) instead. When he discovers that they are seeing each other, he punches Simon, sacks him and throws him out of his home in The Queen Vic. He gets revenge on the two by manipulating an immature Simon into flirting with other women when his relationship with Magda hits a rough patch. Simon eventually starts seeing Donna Ludlow (Matilda Ziegler), and his rejection hurts Magda. Den uses this opportunity. He feigns mock sympathy and seduces her, but before he gets her into bed, he tells her that he has to go on an errand. He instructs Magda to &quot;get ready&quot; for him, telling her that he will be back soon. He then leaves Magda undressed and waiting in his bed for hours, before instructing Simon&#x27;s mother, Pat Wicks (Pam St Clement), to inform her that he is otherwise engaged, leaving her humiliated.

Whilst single again, Den begins to realise that The Queen Vic&#x27;s trade is floundering without Angie. With some meddling from Sharon, Den and Angie decide to reunite as business partners and she returns to live at The Queen Vic. However, it is short-lived, because Angie falls in love with her friend, Sonny. Realising that Angie is planning to leave him, Den visits a solicitor and makes certain that Angie has no claim on The Queen Vic. Angie leaves Walford for Spain in May 1988 with nothing, and they never see each other again.

Having had a lengthy association with the criminal organisation known as The Firm, Den&#x27;s involvement escalates over the summer of 1988. He sells The Queen Vic to Pat and her fiancée Frank Butcher (Mike Reid) and takes over Strokes wine bar, which he runs with Joanne Francis (Pamela Salem). The wine bar is merely a front to the Firm&#x27;s illegal gambling den. When Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth) is raped by James Willmott-Brown (William Boyde), Den manipulates a Firm member, Brad Williams (Jonathan Stratt), to burn down The Dagmar (Wilmott-Brown&#x27;s wine bar) in revenge and the next day, he smugly hints to Wilmott-Brown that he organised it, before pinning him against a wall and threatening him. This, however, is against the Firm&#x27;s wishes, so when the police investigation starts suspecting the Firm&#x27;s involvement and what the Strokes wine bar is really used for, the Firm&#x27;s bosses force Den to take the blame for the arson to distance their organisation from the attack. They take Den to a safe house in Manchester, promising to alter his identity, but Den realises this is a cover and that the Firm are planning to kill him. Den escapes and hands himself in to the police to save his life and is remanded in custody in September 1988 at Dickens Hill prison.

In Dickens Hill, Den struggles initially, as many inmates refuse to trust him. Homosexual inmate Queenie Price (John Labanowski) takes an instant dislike to Den and suspects him of being a &quot;grass&quot;, leading to Queenie and his friends beating him up in his cell. Despite this, Den unveils Queenie as the true prison snitch and gains respect, rising through the ranks to become &quot;No.1&quot; of his landing. On the outside, the Firm still feel that Den is a liability; fearing that he will tell the police about their dealings and decide that Den has to die. They ambush and kidnap Den when he is being accompanied to trial on 23 February 1989, but Den escapes again and makes plans to leave the country. He contacts Michelle, requesting that they meet by a canal where they have held secret meetings in the past, so he can say goodbye to her and Vicki. Unaware that the Firm is following her, Michelle unwittingly brings them to Den, and he is shot by a man who is hiding a gun in a bunch of daffodils. A splash is heard, indicating that Den has fallen into the canal. The police search for Den&#x27;s body but do not find anything until Sharon finds Den&#x27;s signet ring for sale on a market stall in April 1990 and requests that the canal is searched again, unaware that Den was not wearing it when he was shot. This time, a body is found and identified as that of Den.

===2003–2005===
In the intervening years, Sharon and Vicki grow up, although not always living in Walford, and in early 2003, they discover that Den has a son he did not know of, Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman), who joins them in Albert Square. Dennis was the product of Den&#x27;s fling 30 years earlier with a younger woman, Paula Rickman, the daughter of one of Den&#x27;s friends.

Like Den, Dennis has been involved with The Firm, and after some investigating he discovers that Den is not actually dead; after surviving the shooting in 1989, Den fled to Spain with help from Jan and lived there in hiding for the next 14 years, while everyone else in Walford believed he was dead.

The body found in 1990 was in fact that of gangland boss Mr. Vinnicombe, who was murdered as punishment for failing in his attempt to have Den killed.

Hearing this, Vicki traces Den and brings him back to Walford in September 2003. Sharon has mixed emotions, being pleased that he is alive, but angry that he faked his own death, and also berating him for his mistakes that he made before his alleged death. Dennis explains that the body found in the canal was that of Vinnicombe, a senior member of The Firm, who was murdered as punishment for Den&#x27;s escape and dumped in the canal, his teeth having been bricked out to prevent dental identification. Vinnicombe&#x27;s body had wrongly been identified as that of Den, and Jan had assisted in this coverup by planting Den&#x27;s signet ring by the canal to make it appear that the attempt on his life had been successful. 

Den&#x27;s grievances with The Firm are pardoned by its acting boss, Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs), who has taken over from the recently murdered Jack Dalton – who was shot dead by Dennis after revealing that Den had survived the shooting.

Eventually, Sharon forgives him and Den returns to live in Walford to assist Sharon in managing her nightclub, Angie&#x27;s Den. Police soon learn of Den&#x27;s return to Walford and promptly arrest him for perverting the course of justice. However, Den remains silent during intense questioning and the police ultimately decide not to charge him with any crimes, realising that he had still been in Spain when Dalton was killed.

Den soon gets embroiled in a feud with Sharon&#x27;s former boyfriend, Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden), after hearing that Phil hit her and also arranged for Dennis to be beaten up by a gang. As revenge, Den has sex with Phil&#x27;s younger sister Sam (Kim Medcalf) – then dumps her promptly. He later promises another of Phil&#x27;s former girlfriends, Lisa Fowler (Lucy Benjamin), that he will help her get back her daughter Louise, who is in Phil&#x27;s custody. After Phil plants drugs in the club and nearly gets it shut down, Den fakes a truce and talks Phil into accompanying him and Dennis on a warehouse robbery. Den bides his time and organises a scam to get Phil imprisoned. During the robbery, Den takes the money and obstructs Phil&#x27;s getaway, resulting in Phil getting caught by the police and remanded in custody on a charge of armed robbery. Den then helps Lisa flee the country with Louise, after Phil&#x27;s current wife, Kate (Jill Halfpenny), hands her over to Lisa after deciding to cut all ties with Phil. The feud brings Dennis closer to his father. Having lost his wife, his daughter and his freedom, Phil manages to escape several weeks later, confronting Den on Christmas Day; after an intense brawl in which Den hits Phil with a chair to avoid being killed, Den pays Phil off and the latter flees. Den then spends the rest of Christmas happily with his family, before leaving for Spain on Boxing Day to tie up some loose ends.

Family problems arise when Den returns three months later and discovers that Sharon and Dennis are in a romantic relationship; Den considers it to be incest, despite Sharon and Dennis not being blood related. During an intense meeting between the two in The Queen Vic, Den calmly attempts to persuade Dennis to break up with Sharon, but when this fails, he turns nasty and mocks Dennis for believing that their bonding at Christmas was real. This leaves Dennis deeply upset but he recovers, and again refuses to break up with Sharon, leading to Den clashing with him in The Queen Vic. Dennis laughs this off and tells Den that he is leaving to return to Sharon. Playing his last card, Den goads Dennis about his neglected childhood and implies that he suffered sexual abuse whilst in care, successfully provoking Dennis into accidentally hitting Sharon, who had just arrived, whilst trying to attack Den. A guilt-ridden Den later apologises and explains his reasons for not wanting his son and daughter together, because he wants both of them in his life, and he cannot have that if they are in a relationship. Den then tries to explain to Dennis that his feelings for Sharon are simply misguided due to the abuse he supposedly suffered as a child, which leaves Dennis confused and he decides to break up with Sharon to have a father-son relationship.

In the spring of 2004, it is revealed that Den had married his second wife Chrissie (Tracy-Ann Oberman) in Spain in 1999 and left her there when he returned to Walford. She soon arrives in Walford to collect some money from him. She decides to stay in Walford with Den and his children, and the Watts family restore their close bond. Den plays a heroic role when a fairground collapses in Walford and he saves numerous residents. He also tells Pete&#x27;s son Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) that his former wife Laura&#x27;s (Hannah Waterman) baby son Bobby (Kevin Curran), is actually his and encourages him to be a father to him – with Den himself knowing how much a strain his own absence had on Dennis&#x27;s life. Ian had evicted Laura when she revealed she was pregnant, as he had undergone a vasectomy – this led Laura to believe that Garry Hobbs (Ricky Groves) had got her pregnant following an earlier fling. Ian eventually accepts Bobby as his son and asks Den to be godfather at the christening.

However, Den still cannot remain monogamous, and when Chrissie discovers that he has been having an affair with Kate, she leaves Walford. Furious with Den, Sharon and Vicki leave on holiday and contrary to his claims, Den is also troubled by Chrissie&#x27;s departure. To cope with this, Den becomes more reckless and tries to reassert his bachelor status. He hosts a poker game at his house which eventually turns serious when only him and Andy Hunter remain. In a bid to get the Vic back, Den puts his house and club on the line but is narrowly beaten by Andy. Andy neglects to take Den&#x27;s stake but does tell Den to get his life sorted.

Looking for revenge on Andy, Den convinces Pat to help him pull a scam in Andy&#x27;s bookies, where Pat happens to work. The scam is initially successful and Den celebrates. However, Andy discovers the scam and humiliates Den in The Queen Vic by revealing the poker game, just as Sharon returns. The next day, Dennis sends Den home from the club after he nearly gets into a fight with one of his own bouncers. Whilst at home, Den makes a pass at Dennis&#x27;s 20-year-old girlfriend, Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan), which Dennis witnesses. After receiving some harsh words, Den punches Dennis and leaves the house, where he sees a few teenagers breaking into the laundrette. After saving Dot, the two have a heart-to-heart, and Den agrees to call Chrissie. Upon meeting with Chrissie, Den decides he needs to get some time away and returns to Spain for a few weeks.

Den returns in November 2004, apparently a new man. He apologises to Ian, Pat and his family for his earlier mistakes. He also forces an older boyfriend of Vicki&#x27;s to leave after discovering he cheated on her. Chrissie agrees to get back with Den after much convincing but threatens to kill him if he ever cheats again.

To rebuild his family, Den attempts to regain The Queen Vic from the Mitchells just before Christmas 2004, by blackmailing their lawyer Marcus Christie (Stephen Churchett) into convincing Sam that Phil, who is still on the run, needs immediate money. Sam sells The Queen Vic to Den at a vastly reduced price and he reinstates his family at the pub in time for Christmas. Den re-cements his villainous status by kicking the Moon family out on Christmas Eve. With his pub back and his family together, Den looks to the future.

Den&#x27;s downfall ironically begins just hours later on Christmas Eve when he discovers that Sharon and Dennis have resumed their affair. On Christmas Day, he hears that they are planning on leaving for the United States, unless he can accept them both as a couple. To split them up, Den persuades Zoe to lie that she is pregnant with Dennis&#x27;s baby, which is successful, and he gleefully watches as Dennis soon decides to stay with Zoe. However, Den&#x27;s plan backfires when Sharon decides to leave alone instead, as she is unwilling to allow Dennis to leave his unborn child. While trying to persuade Sharon to stay, a panicking Den lets slip that he does not love Vicki as much as he loves her, not realising that Vicki was behind him and overheard everything. Vicki then decides to leave with Sharon. Den is horrified to have lost both of his daughters at Christmas, ironically because of his own lies and deceit, despite having succeeded in splitting up Sharon and Dennis. 

In apparent retribution towards Dennis for inadvertently being the cause of Sharon&#x27;s departure, Den continues his baby lie with Zoe to ensure that Dennis stays. With Sharon gone, Den becomes more evil and twisted, ignoring Chrissie&#x27;s pleading with him to be thankful for the family he still has left with him in Walford. Zoe is unable to find a man to have sex with her in order to create a real pregnancy, so Den manipulates her into having sex with him so that she can get pregnant and pretend the baby is that of Dennis. Following this, an ashamed Zoe attempts to back out of their arrangement, but Den spitefully blackmails her into continuing the lie, revealing his intention to cause misery for her and Dennis for causing Sharon&#x27;s departure. When Zoe decides to tell Chrissie, Den laughs off the threat and reveals he does not care about his marriage. With no options left and desperate to keep Dennis, Zoe carries on the lie with Den.

During this time, Den pretends to care for Dennis, who finally begins to see him as a father figure. Dennis also looks forward to being a father and even begins to feel love for Zoe, who he had initially shunned out of his feelings for Sharon. However, when Dennis eventually catches Zoe and Den in bed together, he rejects the two of them and packs his bags. Despite this, Den appears pleased.

In the wake of this, Dennis leaves in search of Sharon, but not before encountering Chrissie and telling her about Zoe and Den&#x27;s affair. Chrissie does not reveal to Den that she knows what he has done.

Instead, Chrissie slowly plans her revenge and when Zoe discovers she is pregnant with Den&#x27;s child, Chrissie persuades her to abort the baby, not letting on that she knows Den is the baby&#x27;s father. She also concocts a plan of revenge to gain ownership of The Queen Vic from Den. She recruits Zoe and Sam (both also scorned by Den) and they confront him after closing time at The Queen Vic, one evening in February 2005. Den taunts them all for their weaknesses and refuses to sign over The Queen Vic, even when Chrissie threatens to reveal Den&#x27;s true character to the rest of the Square. Den smugly admits to everything he has done but is left stunned when Sharon emerges from the shadows – Chrissie has lured her back from America with the pretence that Den was seriously ill, in order for her to hear Den’s confession to everything that he had done. 

Despite Den&#x27;s desperate explanations, Sharon disowns Den and leaves in a cab. In a rage, Den violently throws Chrissie against a fruit machine and is only stopped by Zoe, who hits him over the head with an iron doorstop in The Queen Vic, and believes she has killed him. Minutes later, whilst Sam and Zoe go upstairs, Den stirs and grabs Chrissie&#x27;s ankle, telling her, &quot;You&#x27;ll never get me out of The Vic!&quot; Chrissie responds by striking him over the head again, finally managing to kill him.

Sam secretly witnesses the fatal blow, but Chrissie continues to allow Zoe to think it is she who has killed Den. The three women bury Den in The Queen Vic cellar and concrete it over. Arguments between the women occur, and Sam and Chrissie become embroiled in a feud to regain ownership of The Queen Vic, with Sam blackmailing Chrissie and eventually digging up Den&#x27;s body in the hope that Chrissie will be imprisoned, and Chrissie subsequently framing Sam for Den&#x27;s murder, which leads to Sam&#x27;s imprisonment. Sharon and Dennis had returned to Walford and married by the time this happened, and she eventually learns the truth when Phil and his brother Grant (Ross Kemp) – who had previously been married to Sharon during Den&#x27;s 14-year absence – return to help their mother Peggy (Barbara Windsor) bring down Chrissie and prove Sam innocent. It is then that both the Mitchell and Watts families found themselves entangled in a conflict with Den&#x27;s old friend, Johnny Allen (Billy Murray), a local mob boss who recently usurped Andy from his position as Walford&#x27;s reigning crime kingpin; on the night of Den&#x27;s murder, Johnny killed Andy by throwing him off a motorway flyover, although the coroner recorded a verdict of suicide.

After working together to extract CCTV footage of Chrissie confessing Den&#x27;s murder to her boyfriend Jake Moon (Joel Beckett) in Johnny&#x27;s nightclub, Dennis and Sharon help the Mitchells prove Sam&#x27;s innocence; the police are called and Chrissie is arrested after Sharon intercepts her attempt to flee the country via the airport, and avenges Den&#x27;s death by punching her whilst echoing the last words she told Den before killing him.

Following Chrissie&#x27;s arrest, she is later sentenced to life imprisonment after pleading guilty, and Den is finally given a proper burial in his &quot;original&quot; grave next to Angie.

In 2015, it is revealed that Den was once in a gang which included Phil&#x27;s father Eric Mitchell, along with his partner-in-crime Gavin Sullivan (Paul Nicholas) and their associates: Henry Hubbard and Ted Hills (Brian Croucher). It soon transpires that Gavin is actually Sharon&#x27;s biological father, and that Den had apparently done a deal with Gavin: he would adopt Sharon in exchange for Gavin partaking in one of Den&#x27;s criminal jobs.

==Character creation==

===Background===
Den Watts was one of the original 23 characters devised by the creators of &quot;EastEnders&quot;, Tony Holland and Julia Smith. The character of Den was originally going to be called Jack and he, his wife and adopted teenage daughter were to be the occupants of the soap&#x27;s local pub, now famously known as The Queen Vic. Holland, who had worked as a barman in his youth, called upon his own personal experiences to invent the Watts family and the pub they lived in. Holland and Smith had always been critical of the way pubs had been portrayed on television feeling they lacked vitality and life, so they were determined that their pub and occupants were going to be more realistic. The Watts family were seen by Holland as integral to the show&#x27;s success, partly because he had already guessed that the pub was going to be a monstrous battleground where emotions would run high on a regular basis, and also because the occupants would be providing the majority of the drama.

Den&#x27;s original character outline as written by Smith and Holland appeared in an abridged form in their book, &quot;EastEnders: The Inside Story&quot;. In this passage, Den will be referred to as Jack, his wife as Pearl, his daughter as Tracey and his dog as Prince (known now as Angie, Sharon and Roly respectively).

:&quot;Jack and Pearl are not criminals. They&#x27;re not angels either. Villains perhaps? Well, he certainly is. They&#x27;ve been married for fifteen years, and haven&#x27;t had sex with each other for thirteen of them. The marriage is a front for the sake of the pub&#x27;s image. The daughter, Tracey is adopted—maybe for the same reason. They have a dog too—Prince—an Alsatian...Even with a marriage on the rocks, Jack still likes the area. His mates are here, it&#x27;s friendly and it&#x27;s his territory. &quot;Local lad makes good&quot;...People look up to him. If you&#x27;ve dragged yourself up by the scruff of the neck and moved up a notch, you need a few people around you who didn&#x27;t quite make it, or you might as well be invisible. He&#x27;s had a mistress for five years...Unlike Pearl, she&#x27;s a very up-market woman, a lady, real class. Jack&#x27;s her bit of rough, and they&#x27;re happy. They actually talk. With Pearl, you shout – or shut up...He&#x27;s a smart dresser. Changes his shirt twice a day and his shoes sparkle. He runs a good pub. He&#x27;s firm and fair with the staff (if you&#x27;ve got any problems—go to him, not her.) The cellars are well organised and spotless. His masculinity is the key to his character. It was called into question at an early stage in his marriage and he&#x27;s defended it ever since. Some call him a ladies&#x27; man (because of his good looks) others – a man&#x27;s man...He&#x27;s a con man and has the gift of the gab. He can defend himself smartly in a brawl. (He&#x27;s only ever thumped Pearly once.) You can accept Jack being a snob—because it&#x27;s not malicious: it&#x27;s done with a grin. Like Pearl, he&#x27;s also trapped by is background...Jack and Pearl&#x27;s relationship is pretty heated...The smooth public face (workers in pubs are always on stage); the trial reconciliations; the rows; the fights and the tears...Will Jack ever bring his mistress into the pub, which is Pearl&#x27;s territory? Will Pearl accept too many free drinks from punters and lose control in public?...They were lovers. They are husband and wife. There was affection...love...if it came to it, could they give each other up? The private grins and winks to each other when they&#x27;re working as a team—which usually means taking money. The love turning to hatred...Jack the lad and the artificial Pearl...They&#x27;re an electric couple.&quot; (page 74).

===Casting controversy===
&quot;EastEnders&quot;&#x27; lead director Matthew Robinson recommended the actor Leslie Grantham for the part. Grantham had previously appeared in London&#x27;s fringe theatre in a stage play Robinson had written and had played a small part, Kiston, in the two-part &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;Resurrection of the Daleks&quot; (1984), which had been directed by Robinson. Julia Smith remembered that she had taught Grantham at the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art and regarded him as a &quot;mature student&quot;, although she had never seen him &quot;in action&quot;. Smith and Holland needed the character of Den to have &quot;panache, charisma and electricity&quot;. They were initially uncertain about casting Grantham, but they both felt that the actor had &quot;something&quot;, which they went on to describe as a &quot;tensed up internal emotion of some sort, that was being held in. There was something behind the eyes, too. Barely contained violence almost...&quot;

After a successful reading with the actress Jean Fennell (who was originally cast as Angie), he was offered the part. However, shortly afterwards Grantham contacted Smith and asked to speak to her urgently. He revealed that he had been found guilty of killing a German taxi driver while on army service in 1966 and spent ten years in prison. Although there were fears that if this story got out the resultant publicity would do enormous damage to the programme and the BBC, Smith decided not to withdraw Grantham from the role. In her opinion, he had paid the full penalty that society requires for a mistake committed in his past and it was a &quot;Christian duty to forgive&quot;.

The story found its way into the British press much faster than expected. Three days after the transmission of episode one, &quot;EastEnders&quot; made the front page of a national newspaper for the first time with the headline &quot;EASTENDERS STAR IS A KILLER.&quot; The security gates at the BBC Elstree Centre (where &quot;EastEnders&quot; is filmed) were swamped with journalists and photographers, and so began a &quot;double-edged&quot; relationship between &quot;EastEnders&quot; and the popular press. The devisers of the programme were quick to realise that whilst a newspaper&#x27;s publicity may sometimes boost a soap&#x27;s position in the ratings, it could equally help to tarnish it. In conjunction, soaps could help to sell newspapers, and from then on stories about &quot;EastEnders&quot; and the cast began to fill their pages. Grantham was hounded by the press and the BBC was forced to put out a statement supporting him and their decision to employ a convicted murderer. To keep the press at bay, Grantham was smuggled out of the studios by the rear entrance and decoy cars were used to lure the press away from his home, all of which put an increasing strain on him. Eventually the furore quietened down, but it never went away entirely and nearly every article written about Grantham during his first stint in the show referenced his past. The press began to blur the characters in the show with the actors and it was at this point that Smith, in an attempt to dispel confusion about reality and fiction, introduced the rule that no actor was ever to appear in public &quot;in character&quot;.

==Character development and impact==
Despite the controversy surrounding Grantham, the Wattses, with Anita Dobson as the newly appointed Angie, were the surprise hit characters of the show. Angie and Den were a livewire couple whose on/off relationship made the Queen Vic pub &quot;exciting and unpredictable&quot; and the viewers tuned in their millions to watch the destruction of their relationship on-screen. Den&#x27;s clashes with Angie brought &quot;EastEnders&quot; to a peak of popularity and removed rival soap &quot;Coronation Street&quot; from the top of the ratings chart.

===&quot;Dirty Den&quot;===
In 1985, Den was the first person to speak on the first episode of &quot;EastEnders&quot;: &quot;Stinks in here dunnit?&quot; just before he found out that Reg Cox (Johnnie Clayton) had been murdered. Early on in the series, the character of Den became central to the programme and was the focus of a controversial storyline involving the teenage pregnancy of Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully). Press interest in the show escalated as journalists continuously tried to predict who had fathered Michelle&#x27;s baby. In true whodunit fashion, the audience had been kept in the dark as to the real identity of the father and were given teasers implicating several residents on the Square. The audience finally discovered the culprit in Episode 66 of the programme, broadcast on 3 October 1985. The episode was written by series co-creator/script editor Tony Holland and directed by co-creator/producer Julia Smith, and was considered to be a landmark episode in the show&#x27;s history. Four possible suspects were seen leaving the Square in the early half of the episode: Tony Carpenter (Oscar James), Ali Osman (Nejdet Salih), Andy O&#x27;Brien (Ross Davidson) and Den Watts. As Michelle waited by their rendezvous point, a car pulled up and finally the fluffy white legs of Roly the poodle bounded out of the car, and gave it all away: Den Watts was the man meeting Michelle and it was he who had fathered her baby. It was when Den was revealed as the father that his famous nickname &quot;Dirty Den&quot; was created by the British press. The rest of the episode consisted of just one long scene, where Den and Michelle discussed whether or not to keep the baby. Up to that time it was the longest scene ever done in a soap opera, lasting fifteen minutes. For a series that in its first eight months of existence had established a reputation for being fast-moving and rapidly cut, this was a bold experiment. It relied on just the one story and two actors to hold the audience for over half an episode. Tony Holland&#x27;s handling of the awkward scene between a teenage girl and the father of her best friend is deemed as one of the highlights of &quot;EastEnders&quot; first year. The finishing touch was the use of an alternative end title music, a variation of the normal one which replaced the dramatic drum beats with a longer, gentler piano solo introduction.

After this storyline the programme started to appear in newspaper cartoons as it moved more and more into the public mainstream. One such cartoon showed the British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, telling her cabinet that the best way to alert the country to the dangers of AIDS was to give the disease to Den.

===Den and Angie mania===
During 1986 the series became dominated by Den and Angie&#x27;s storylines and the focus of the programme was very much concentrated on their volatile relationship. The emphasis began early in 1986 with the arrival of Den&#x27;s mistress Jan Hammond (Jane How). Jan had been a powerful off-screen presence for the first year, a menacing voice at the end of the telephone, which severely affected the mood of both Den and Angie and kept the audience on edge every time the phone rang. Jan&#x27;s physical arrival at the Vic in January 1986 was one of the show&#x27;s dramatic highlights. Her invasion of Angie&#x27;s territory was a springboard to future emotional fireworks and a precursor to Angie&#x27;s further dependence on alcohol and her attempted suicide. The characters were used to advertise the show abroad in countries such as America.

Den and Angie&#x27;s traumatic two-hander episode in October 1986 was another risky experiment for &quot;EastEnders&quot; — A thirty-minute episode with only two people in it had never been attempted in a soap before. Holland and Smith feared that the episode would not hold up, however press and audience alike were in agreement that it did. Once it was done, it set a precedent and the programme has featured two-handers ever since. The episode was structured like a &quot;tennis match&quot; between Angie and Den, with a non-speaking window cleaner forever strolling innocently into the action. It began with Den trying to tell Angie that he wanted a divorce. Angie was shocked and for a moment defeated, but she then dropped her bombshell and told Den that she only had six months to live. At first Den did not believe her, but eventually Angie&#x27;s hysterical performance convinced him. He crumbled and promised to stay with her and only after he left did Angie smile in triumph, letting the audience in on her secret that it was all a big lie. Written by Jane Hollowood and directed by Antonia Bird, this episode is considered to be one of the finest episodes in &quot;EastEnders&quot;&#x27; catalogue.

The Den/Angie/Jan triangle was to continue for many months. The climax was a trip to Venice when Angie – convinced that Den had finished with his mistress – was taken there for a second honeymoon, returning to London on the Orient Express. This gave the writers and producers an opportunity to open the show up from the confines of Albert Square. However the trip to Venice was fraught with problems and Dobson, Grantham and Jane How were hounded by the press at all times. Their photographs appeared in British newspapers, thus ruining the shock surprise that Tony Holland had created, by including Den&#x27;s mistress in the episode. Despite huge efforts from all involved the Venice episodes were only moderately successful, although the revelations discovered by Den in the episode set the scene for one of &quot;EastEnders&quot;&#x27; most renowned episodes, which aired on Christmas Day that year. After over-hearing his wife confess that her illness was fabricated, Den filed for divorce. 30.1 million viewers tuned in on Christmas Day in 1986, to witness Den handing Angie her divorce papers, giving the soap its highest ever episode rating, which has yet to be beaten by any other plotline from any other soap in the UK.

This storyline saw the separation of Den and Angie. Holland and Smith had anticipated that Den and Angie would be popular, but they had not guessed how hysterical the reaction to them would be. It was decided that Den and Angie would have to be played down for a while so that other characters would have the opportunity to shine through. The next 18 months saw Den and Angie struggle to get by without each other, and eventually they reunited as business partners.

===Arrest and demise===
However, at the beginning of 1988 Anita Dobson decided that she wanted to move on after three years of playing Angie. She made her final appearance in May that year. Leslie Grantham had also decided that he wanted to move on, but Julia Smith didn&#x27;t want the programme to suffer the double blow of losing both Den and Angie so close together. The solution to the problem was one of the soap&#x27;s most complicated and creative exercises, that required intricate planning. The idea was to enable Den to stay as an on-screen presence into 1989, while keeping Grantham working for &quot;EastEnders&quot; only until the autumn of 1988. Tony Holland and writer/editor Bill Lyons came up with a story to put Den in prison for a year, intending that material recorded in a block of intensive filming would then be included in the programme for the rest of the year. The programme didn&#x27;t want to make Den into a criminal, however, so he had to be put in prison for doing something that could be justified to the viewing public – otherwise there would be no sympathy for him. The answer lay in a storyline that was running with another character: the rape of Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth). After simultaneously getting in way over his head with a criminal organisation (The Firm), Den torched Kathy&#x27;s rapist&#x27;s wine bar in retaliation, and was then made to take the blame for the deed by the firm. After he refused, went on the run, and was nearly killed by the firm&#x27;s heavies, Den turned himself into the police and was put on remand at Dickens Hill prison in September 1988. For the next five months he was seen, in the company of a small group of new but ultimately short-lived characters also confined in the prison, on a regular basis in &quot;EastEnders&quot;. This material was shot in less than a month at Dartmoor Prison, Devon. When these segments were written and recorded, they were done so entirely in isolation and in advance; the production team had no real idea of other material that would have to fit around it.

The character was eventually to bow out on 23 February 1989 in one of the programme&#x27;s most famous episodes which attracted well over 20 million viewers. After being abducted by a group of gangsters who ambushed the taxi taking him to court, Den escaped from his captors and returned to the famous canal (in Alperton) for one last rendezvous with Michelle. The episode ended with Den being shot by a member of the firm (who was carrying a gun concealed in a bunch of daffodils) and then falling into the canal. The scene where Den actually hit the water had to be taped at the BBC&#x27;s Ealing Film Studios using a water tank, because the waters of the Grand Union Canal were deemed unsafe. When the episode was finished, however, Jonathan Powell, controller of BBC1, requested that the final shot be removed to allow for the possibility of Den returning in the future. In protest, Tony Holland and Julia Smith had their names taken off the episode&#x27;s credits. Den&#x27;s exit ended up being the creators&#x27; final contribution to the show.

===Controversial return===
However, after 14 years presumed dead, executive-producer Louise Berridge made the highly controversial decision to reintroduce the character to the series and reunite him with his daughter Sharon, played by Letitia Dean. Grantham has alleged that the producers of &quot;EastEnders&quot; asked him to reprise the role many times since 1991, but he turned each offer down as he was unhappy with the returning storylines. Subsequent offers between 1995 and 2001 were also rejected because Den&#x27;s screen family were no longer in the show and Grantham felt that a return at this time would have been little more than a publicity stunt. However, he accepted Berridge&#x27;s offer to return in 2003, as he approved of the storyline, and because Den had family ties within the cast – his adoptive daughter Sharon had returned after six years away, his other daughter Vicki was due to return, and Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman), the son Den did not know about, was also due to join.

The reintroduction of Den was part of a plan by scriptwriters to fight back against the continued success of ITV&#x27;s long-running soap, &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. The character made his &quot;dramatic return&quot; in an episode that aired on 29 September 2003. On-screen, Den walked into Sharon&#x27;s nightclub, Angie&#x27;s Den, and greeted his stunned daughter with the words &quot;Hello, princess.&quot; More than 16 million viewers watched his long-awaited homecoming, attracting 62% of the viewing public; it has been voted as the favourite TV soap comeback in an AOL online poll of over 23,000 viewers, taking over a third of the vote (37%).

Despite claims from the British press that the plot was unrealistic and that it questioned the show&#x27;s credibility, Den&#x27;s return sparked a huge increase in ratings for the last few months of 2003. After a successful Christmas storyline, Grantham took a short break from the show after securing a lengthy contract. However, a severe press backlash followed after actor Grantham was outed in an internet sex scandal in May 2004, which coincided with a swift decline in &quot;EastEnders&quot; ratings. Grantham was subsequently suspended for two months and his character departed on 30 August, before returning on the episode broadcast on 11 November. the character was later killed off in a high-profile storyline, which saw his body buried in the cellar of The Queen Vic.

Grantham has denied that he was dismissed from the show as punishment for the internet sex scandal. He has claimed in his autobiography that he only ever intended to return to the soap for 18 months so his character&#x27;s second demise would tie in with the show&#x27;s 20th anniversary.

In 2006, &quot;EastEnders&quot;&#x27; scriptwriter Tony Jordan revealed how it was his idea to bring Den back in 2003. Jordan had started working at &quot;EastEnders&quot; in 1989, after Den had already left the series. Jordan had always wanted to write material for Den and Angie and so he campaigned for the return of Den for many years. He told the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, &quot;At story conferences I&#x27;d say, &#x27;How do we know he&#x27;s dead? They never found a body&#x27;. Eventually, just to shut me up, they made me write an episode where Den&#x27;s body was found and identified by his ring.&quot; Jordan finally got his way in 2003; however, according to the writer, Grantham&#x27;s internet sex scandal spelled the demise of the character. Commenting on this, Jordan said, &quot;If [the scandal] hadn&#x27;t come out I think it would have worked and he&#x27;d still be in the show. When I saw him on screen after those revelations came out, suddenly I couldn&#x27;t believe in the character any more. I was starting to love the character and buying into all of it, but after that I saw him as Leslie Grantham – not Den Watts. He was older, and flawed in all the wrong ways. I think a lot of viewers felt the same, and the cast as well, probably.&quot;

==Reception==
Despite the controversy surrounding Grantham, the character of Den remains one of the most popular and high-profile characters in &quot;EastEnders&quot; history and was voted the 75th greatest television character of all time in a Channel 4 poll. He has also been branded the villain &quot;you most love to hate&quot; and was voted the number one &quot;TV Bastard&quot; in a 2002 poll. In addition, the moment when Den served Angie divorce papers has been voted the number one soap moment of all time in a 2004 poll. In 2020, Sara Wallis and Ian Hyland from The &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; placed Den second on their ranked list of the best &quot;EastEnders&quot; characters of all time, calling him &quot;a swindling love rat&quot; and the &quot;biggest villain of them all&quot; who had a &quot;stormy marriage&quot; to Angie, as well as noting how Den shocked Sharon &quot;and the nation&quot; when he was revealed to be alive in 2003. In a 2021 &quot;Radio Times&quot; poll, Den and Angie were voted as the joint fourth &quot;soap pub landlord&quot;, receiving 8% of the votes.

==Impact on popular culture==
In the short story &quot;Brief Encounter: Mistaken Identity&quot; by Gary Russell, published in &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; Edition 174, the mercenary Lytton meets Den Watts in the Queen Victoria and mistakes him for Davros&#x27;s adjutant Kiston. Leslie Grantham had played Kiston in an early television role in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;Resurrection of the Daleks&quot;.

The 2006 episode of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; entitled &quot;Army of Ghosts&quot; features a scene where Peggy Mitchell tells the &quot;ghost&quot; of Den to &quot;get outta my pub!&quot; as the only spirits that will be served are vodka, whisky and gin. Given that the episode later reveals the &quot;ghosts&quot; to be fully converted Cybermen, Leslie Grantham is not seen in this episode.

In 1986, the duo Whisky and Sofa released a single called &quot;Dirty Den&quot;, with lyrics making direct references to the character.

In an episode of the fifth season of &quot;Old Harry&#x27;s Game&quot;, Satan (the main character), takes control of the BBC and, in an effort to improve human morality, decides to insert moral messages into &quot;EastEnders&quot;, including reintroducing Den as a &quot;force for good&quot;, when executives challenge Den&#x27;s reintroduction, stating that he can no longer feature in the show as he was murdered, Satan replies dismissively &quot;Oh, he&#x27;s always being murdered&quot;, a reference to Den&#x27;s 2003 resurrection.

In the &quot;Gavin &amp; Stacey&quot; Christmas special, Bryn, played by Rob Brydon, mentions that he stopped watching &quot;EastEnders&quot; when Den returned to the show in 2003.

<text>Eliminative materialism (also called eliminativism) is a materialist position in the philosophy of mind. It is the idea that the majority of mental states in folk psychology do not exist. Some supporters of eliminativism argue that no coherent neural basis will be found for many everyday psychological concepts such as belief or desire, since they are poorly defined. The argument is that psychological concepts of behavior and experience should be judged by how well they reduce to the biological level. Other versions entail the nonexistence of conscious mental states such as pain and visual perceptions.

Eliminativism about a class of entities is the view that the class of entities does not exist. For example, materialism tends to be eliminativist about the soul; modern chemists are eliminativist about phlogiston; modern biologists are eliminativist about &quot;élan vital&quot;; and modern physicists are eliminativist about luminiferous ether. Eliminative &quot;materialism&quot; is the relatively new (1960s–70s) idea that certain classes of mental entities that common sense takes for granted, such as beliefs, desires, and the subjective sensation of pain, do not exist. The most common versions are eliminativism about propositional attitudes, as expressed by Paul and Patricia Churchland, and eliminativism about qualia (subjective interpretations about particular instances of subjective experience), as expressed by Daniel Dennett, Georges Rey, and Jacy Reese Anthis.

In the context of materialist understandings of psychology, eliminativism is the opposite of reductive materialism, arguing that mental states as conventionally understood &quot;do&quot; exist, and directly correspond to the physical state of the nervous system. An intermediate position, revisionary materialism, often argues the mental state in question will prove to be &quot;somewhat&quot; reducible to physical phenomena—with some changes needed to the commonsense concept.

Since eliminative materialism arguably claims that future research will fail to find a neuronal basis for various mental phenomena, it may need to wait for science to progress further. One might question the position on these grounds, but philosophers like Churchland argue that eliminativism is often necessary in order to open the minds of thinkers to new evidence and better explanations. Views closely related to eliminativism include illusionism and quietism.

==Overview==

Various arguments have been made for and against eliminative materialism over the last 50 years. The view&#x27;s history can be traced to David Hume, who rejected the idea of the &quot;self&quot; on the grounds that it was not based on any impression. Most arguments for the view are based on the assumption that people&#x27;s commonsense view of the mind is actually an implicit theory. It is to be compared and contrasted with other scientific theories in its explanatory success, accuracy, and ability to predict the future. Eliminativists argue that commonsense &quot;folk&quot; psychology has failed and will eventually need to be replaced by explanations derived from neuroscience. These philosophers therefore tend to emphasize the importance of neuroscientific research as well as developments in artificial intelligence.

Philosophers who argue against eliminativism may take several approaches. Simulation theorists, like Robert Gordon and Alvin Goldman, argue that folk psychology is not a theory, but depends on internal simulation of others, and therefore is not subject to falsification in the same way that theories are. Jerry Fodor, among others, argues that folk psychology is, in fact, a successful (even indispensable) theory. Another view is that eliminativism assumes the existence of the beliefs and other entities it seeks to &quot;eliminate&quot; and is thus self-refuting.

Eliminativism maintains that the commonsense understanding of the mind is mistaken, and that neuroscience will one day reveal that mental states talked about in everyday discourse, using words such as &quot;intend&quot;, &quot;believe&quot;, &quot;desire&quot;, and &quot;love&quot;, do not refer to anything real. Because of the inadequacy of natural languages, people mistakenly think that they have such beliefs and desires. Some eliminativists, such as Frank Jackson, claim that consciousness does not exist except as an epiphenomenon of brain function; others, such as Georges Rey, claim that the concept will eventually be eliminated as neuroscience progresses. Consciousness and folk psychology are separate issues, and it is possible to take an eliminative stance on one but not the other. The roots of eliminativism go back to the writings of Wilfred Sellars, W.V.O. Quine, Paul Feyerabend, and Richard Rorty. The term &quot;eliminative materialism&quot; was first introduced by James Cornman in 1968 while describing a version of physicalism endorsed by Rorty. The later Ludwig Wittgenstein was also an important inspiration for eliminativism, particularly with his attack on &quot;private objects&quot; as &quot;grammatical fictions&quot;.

Early eliminativists such as Rorty and Feyerabend often confused two different notions of the sort of elimination that the term &quot;eliminative materialism&quot; entailed. On the one hand, they claimed, the cognitive sciences that will ultimately give people a correct account of the mind&#x27;s workings will not employ terms that refer to commonsense mental states like beliefs and desires; these states will not be part of the ontology of a mature cognitive science. But critics immediately countered that this view was indistinguishable from the identity theory of mind. Quine himself wondered what exactly was so eliminative about eliminative materialism:

On the other hand, the same philosophers claimed that commonsense mental states simply do not exist. But critics pointed out that eliminativists could not have it both ways: either mental states exist and will ultimately be explained in terms of lower-level neurophysiological processes, or they do not. Modern eliminativists have much more clearly expressed the view that mental phenomena simply do not exist and will eventually be eliminated from people&#x27;s thinking about the brain in the same way that demons have been eliminated from people&#x27;s thinking about mental illness and psychopathology.

While it was a minority view in the 1960s, eliminative materialism gained prominence and acceptance during the 1980s. Proponents of this view, such as B.F. Skinner, often made parallels to previous superseded scientific theories (such as that of the four humours, the phlogiston theory of combustion, and the vital force theory of life) that have all been successfully eliminated in attempting to establish their thesis about the nature of the mental. In these cases, science has not produced more detailed versions or reductions of these theories, but rejected them altogether as obsolete. Radical behaviorists, such as Skinner, argued that folk psychology is already obsolete and should be replaced by descriptions of histories of reinforcement and punishment. Such views were eventually abandoned. Patricia and Paul Churchland argued that folk psychology will be gradually replaced as neuroscience matures.

Eliminativism is not only motivated by philosophical considerations, but is also a prediction about what form future scientific theories will take. Eliminativist philosophers therefore tend to be concerned with data from the relevant brain and cognitive sciences. In addition, because eliminativism is essentially predictive in nature, different theorists can and often do predict which aspects of folk psychology will be eliminated from folk psychological vocabulary. None of these philosophers are eliminativists &quot;tout court&quot;.

Today, the eliminativist view is most closely associated with the Churchlands, who deny the existence of propositional attitudes (a subclass of intentional states), and with Daniel Dennett, who is generally considered an eliminativist about qualia and phenomenal aspects of consciousness. One way to summarize the difference between the Churchlands&#x27; view and Dennett&#x27;s is that the Churchlands are eliminativists about propositional attitudes, but reductionists about qualia, while Dennett is an anti-reductionist about propositional attitudes and an eliminativist about qualia.

More recently, Brian Tomasik and Jacy Reese Anthis have made various arguments for eliminativism. Elizabeth Irvine has argued that both science and folk psychology do not treat mental states as having phenomenal properties so the hard problem &quot;may not be a genuine problem for non-philosophers (despite its overwhelming obviousness to philosophers), and questions about consciousness may well &#x27;shatter&#x27; into more specific questions about particular capacities.&quot; In 2022, Anthis published &quot;Consciousness Semanticism: A Precise Eliminativist Theory of Consciousness&quot;, which asserts that &quot;formal argumentation from precise semantics&quot; dissolves the hard problem because of the contradiction between precision implied in philosophical theory and the vagueness in its definition, which implies there is no fact of the matter for phenomenological consciousness.

==Arguments for eliminativism==

===Problems with folk theories===
Eliminativists such as Paul and Patricia Churchland argue that folk psychology is a fully developed but non-formalized theory of human behavior. It is used to explain and make predictions about human mental states and behavior. This view is often referred to as the theory of mind or just simply theory-theory, for it theorizes the existence of an unacknowledged theory. As a theory in the scientific sense, eliminativists maintain, folk psychology must be evaluated on the basis of its predictive power and explanatory success as a research program for the investigation of the mind/brain.

Such eliminativists have developed different arguments to show that folk psychology is a seriously mistaken theory and should be abolished. They argue that folk psychology excludes from its purview or has traditionally been mistaken about many important mental phenomena that can and are being examined and explained by modern neuroscience. Some examples are dreaming, consciousness, mental disorders, learning processes, and memory abilities. Furthermore, they argue, folk psychology&#x27;s development in the last 2,500 years has not been significant and it is therefore stagnant. The ancient Greeks already had a folk psychology comparable to modern views. But in contrast to this lack of development, neuroscience is rapidly progressing and, in their view, can explain many cognitive processes that folk psychology cannot.

Folk psychology retains characteristics of now obsolete theories or legends from the past. Ancient societies tried to explain the physical mysteries of nature by ascribing mental conditions to them in such statements as &quot;the sea is angry&quot;. Gradually, these everyday folk psychological explanations were replaced by more efficient scientific descriptions. Today, eliminativists argue, there is no reason not to accept an effective scientific account of cognition. If such an explanation existed, then there would be no need for folk-psychological explanations of behavior, and the latter would be eliminated the same way as the mythological explanations the ancients used.

Another line of argument is the meta-induction based on what eliminativists view as the disastrous historical record of folk theories in general. Ancient pre-scientific &quot;theories&quot; of folk biology, folk physics, and folk cosmology have all proven radically wrong. Eliminativists argue the same in the case of folk psychology. There seems no logical basis, to the eliminativist, to make an exception just because folk psychology has lasted longer and is more intuitive or instinctively plausible than other folk theories. Indeed, the eliminativists warn, considerations of intuitive plausibility may be precisely the result of the deeply entrenched nature in society of folk psychology itself. It may be that people&#x27;s beliefs and other such states are as theory-laden as external perceptions and hence that intuitions will tend to be biased in their favor.

===Specific problems with folk psychology===
Much of folk psychology involves the attribution of intentional states (or more specifically as a subclass, propositional attitudes). Eliminativists point out that these states are generally ascribed syntactic and semantic properties. An example of this is the language of thought hypothesis, which attributes a discrete, combinatorial syntax and other linguistic properties to these mental phenomena. Eliminativists argue that such discrete, combinatorial characteristics have no place in neuroscience, which speaks of action potentials, spiking frequencies, and other continuous and distributed effects. Hence, the syntactic structures assumed by folk psychology have no place in such a structure as the brain. To this there have been two responses. On the one hand, some philosophers deny that mental states are linguistic and see this as a straw man argument. The other view is represented by those who subscribe to &quot;a language of thought&quot;. They assert that mental states can be multiply realized and that functional characterizations are just higher-level characterizations of what happens at the physical level.

It has also been argued against folk psychology that the intentionality of mental states like belief implies that they have semantic qualities. Specifically, their meaning is determined by the things they are about in the external world. This makes it difficult to explain how they can play the causal roles they are supposed to in cognitive processes.

In recent years, this latter argument has been fortified by the theory of connectionism. Many connectionist models of the brain have been developed in which the processes of language learning and other forms of representation are highly distributed and parallel. This tends to indicate that such discrete and semantically endowed entities as beliefs and desires are unnecessary.

=== Physics eliminates intentionality ===
The problem of intentionality poses a significant challenge to materialist accounts of cognition. If thoughts are neural processes, we must explain how specific neural networks can be &quot;about&quot; external objects or concepts. We can think about Paris, for instance, but there is no clear mechanism by which neurons can represent a city.

Traditional analogies fail to explain this phenomenon. Unlike a photograph, neurons do not physically resemble Paris. Nor can we appeal to conventional symbolism, as we might with a stop sign representing the action of stopping. Such symbols derive their meaning from social agreement and interpretation, which are not applicable to a brain&#x27;s workings. Attempts to posit a separate neural process that assigns meaning to the &quot;Paris neurons&quot; merely shift the problem without resolving it, as we then need to explain how this secondary process can assign meaning, initiating an infinite regress.

The only way to break this regress is to postulate matter with intrinsic meaning, independent of external interpretation. But our current understanding of physics precludes the existence of such matter. The fundamental particles and forces physics describes have no inherent semantic properties that could ground intentionality. This physical limitation presents a formidable obstacle to materialist theories of mind that rely on neural representations. It suggests that intentionality, as commonly understood, may be incompatible with a purely physicalist worldview. This suggests that our folk psychological concepts of intentional states will be eliminated in light of scientific understanding.

=== Evolution eliminates intentionality ===
Another argument for eliminative materialism stems from evolutionary theory. This argument suggests that natural selection, the process shaping our neural architecture, cannot solve the &quot;disjunction problem&quot;, which challenges the idea that neural states can store specific, determinate propositional content. Natural selection, as Darwin described it, is primarily a process of selection against rather than selection for traits. It passively filters out traits below a certain fitness threshold rather than actively choosing beneficial ones. This lack of foresight or purpose in evolution becomes problematic when considering how neural states could represent unique propositions.

The disjunction problem arises from the fact that natural selection cannot discriminate between coextensive properties. For example, consider two genes close together on a chromosome. One gene might code for a beneficial trait, while the other codes for a neutral or even harmful trait. Due to their proximity, these genes are often inherited together, a phenomenon known as genetic linkage. Natural selection cannot distinguish between these linked traits; it can only act on their combined effect on the organism&#x27;s fitness. Only random processes like genetic crossover—where chromosomes exchange genetic material during reproduction—can break these linkages. Until such a break occurs, natural selection remains &quot;blind&quot; to the linked genes&#x27; individual effects.

Eliminativists argue that if natural selection—the process responsible for shaping our neural architecture—cannot solve the disjunction problem, then our brains cannot store unique, non-disjunctive propositions, as required by folk psychology. Instead, they suggest that neural states contain inherently disjunctive or indeterminate content. This argument leads eliminativists to reject the notion that neural states have specific, determinate informational content corresponding to the discrete, non-disjunctive propositions of folk psychology. This evolutionary argument adds to the eliminativist case that our commonsense understanding of beliefs, desires, and other propositional attitudes is flawed and should be replaced by a neuroscientific account that acknowledges the indeterminate nature of neural representations.

==Arguments against eliminativism==
=== Intentionality and consciousness are identical ===
Some eliminativists reject intentionality while accepting the existence of qualia. Other eliminativists reject qualia while accepting intentionality. Many philosophers argue that intentionality cannot exist without consciousness and vice versa, and so any philosopher who accepts one while rejecting the other is being inconsistent. They argue that, to be consistent, one must accept both qualia and intentionality or reject them both. Philosophers who argue for such a position include Philip Goff, Terence Horgan, Uriah Kriegal, and John Tienson. The philosopher Keith Frankish accepts the existence of intentionality but holds to illusionism about consciousness because he rejects qualia. Goff notes that beliefs are a kind of propositional thought.

===Intuitive reservations===
The thesis of eliminativism seems so obviously wrong to many critics, who find it undeniable that people know immediately and indubitably that they have minds, that argumentation seems unnecessary. This sort of intuition-pumping is illustrated by asking what happens when one asks oneself honestly if one has mental states. Eliminativists object to such a rebuttal of their position by claiming that intuitions often are mistaken. Analogies from the history of science are frequently invoked to buttress this observation: it may appear obvious that the sun travels around the earth, for example, but this was nevertheless proved wrong. Similarly, it may appear obvious that apart from neural events there are also mental conditions, but that could be false.

But even if one accepts the susceptibility to error of people&#x27;s intuitions, the objection can be reformulated: if the existence of mental conditions seems perfectly obvious and is central to our conception of the world, then enormously strong arguments are needed to deny their existence. Furthermore, these arguments, to be consistent, must be formulated in a way that does not presuppose the existence of entities like &quot;mental states&quot;, &quot;logical arguments&quot;, and &quot;ideas&quot;, lest they be self-contradictory. Those who accept this objection say that the arguments for eliminativism are far too weak to establish such a radical claim and that there is thus no reason to accept eliminativism.

===Self-refutation===
Some philosophers, such as Paul Boghossian, have attempted to show that eliminativism is in some sense self-refuting, since the theory presupposes the existence of mental phenomena. If eliminativism is true, then eliminativists must accept an intentional property like truth, supposing that in order to assert something one must believe it. Hence, for eliminativism to be asserted as a thesis, the eliminativist must believe that it is true; if so, there are beliefs, and eliminativism is false.

Georges Rey and Michael Devitt reply to this objection by invoking deflationary semantic theories that avoid analyzing predicates like &quot;x is true&quot; as expressing a real property. They are instead construed as logical devices, so that asserting that a sentence is true is just a quoted way of asserting the sentence itself. To say &quot;&#x27;God exists&#x27; is true&quot; is just to say &quot;God exists&quot;. This way, Rey and Devitt argue, insofar as dispositional replacements of &quot;claims&quot; and deflationary accounts of &quot;true&quot; are coherent, eliminativism is not self-refuting.

=== Correspondence theory of truth ===
Several philosophers, such as the Churchlands and Alex Rosenberg, have developed a theory of structural resemblance or physical isomorphism that could explain how neural states can instantiate truth within the correspondence theory of truth. Neuroscientists use the word &quot;representation&quot; to identify the neural circuits&#x27; encoding of inputs from the peripheral nervous system in, for example, the visual cortex. But they use the word without according it any commitment to intentional content. In fact, there is an explicit commitment to describing neural representations in terms of structures of neural axonal discharges that are physically isomorphic to the inputs that cause them. Suppose that this way of understanding representation in the brain is preserved in the long-term course of research providing an understanding of how the brain processes and stores information. Then there will be considerable evidence that the brain is a neural network whose physical structure is identical to the aspects of its environment it tracks and whose representations of these features consist in this physical isomorphism.

Experiments in the 1980s with macaques isolated the structural resemblance between input vibrations the finger feels, measured in cycles per second, and representations of them in neural circuits, measured in action-potential spikes per second. This resemblance between two easily measured variables makes it unsurprising that they would be among the first such structural resemblances to be discovered. Macaques and humans have the same peripheral nervous system sensitivities and can make the same tactile discriminations. Subsequent research into neural processing has increasingly vindicated a structural resemblance or physical isomorphism approach to how information enters the brain and is stored and deployed.

This isomorphism between brain and world is not a matter of some relationship between reality and a map of reality stored in the brain. Maps require interpretation if they are to be about what they map, and eliminativism and neuroscience share a commitment to explaining the appearance of aboutness by purely physical relationships between informational states in the brain and what they &quot;represent&quot;. The brain-to-world relationship must be a matter of physical isomorphism—sameness of form, outline, structure—that does not require interpretation.

This machinery can be applied to make &quot;sense&quot; of eliminativism in terms of the sentences eliminativists say or write. When we say that eliminativism is true, that the brain does not store information in the form of unique sentences, statements, expressing propositions or anything like them, there is a set of neural circuits that has no trouble coherently carrying this information. There is a possible translation manual that will guide us back from the vocalization or inscription eliminativists express to these circuits. These neural structures will differ from the neural circuits of those who explicitly reject eliminativism in ways that our translation manual will presumably shed some light on, giving us a neurological handle on disagreement and on the structural differences in neural circuitry, if any, between asserting p and asserting not-p when p expresses the eliminativist thesis.

==== Criticism ====
The physical isomorphism approach faces indeterminacy problems. Any given structure in the brain will be causally related to, and isomorphic in various respects to, many different structures in external reality. But we cannot discriminate the one it is intended to represent or that it is supposed to be true &quot;of&quot;. These locutions are heavy with just the intentionality that eliminativism denies. Here is a problem of underdetermination or holism that eliminativism shares with intentionality-dependent theories of mind. Here, we can only invoke pragmatic criteria for discriminating successful structural representations—the substitution of true ones for unsuccessful ones—the ones we used to call false.

Dennett notes that it is possible that such indeterminacy problems remain only hypothetical, not occurring in reality. He constructs a 4x4 &quot;Quinian crossword puzzle&quot; with words that must satisfy both the across and down definitions. Since there are multiple constraints on this puzzle, there is one solution. Thus we can think of the brain and its relation to the external world as a very large crossword puzzle that must satisfy exceedingly many constraints to which there is only one possible solution. Therefore, in reality we may end up with only one physical isomorphism between the brain and the external world.

=== Pragmatic theory of truth ===
When indeterminacy problems arose because the brain is physically isomorphic to multiple structures of the external world, it was urged that a pragmatic approach be used to resolve the problem. Another approach argues that the pragmatic theory of truth should be used from the start to decide whether certain neural circuits store true information about the external world. Pragmatism was founded by Charles Sanders Peirce and William James, and later refined by our understanding of the philosophy of science. According to pragmatism, to say that general relativity is true is to say that it makes more accurate predictions than other theories (Newtonian mechanics, Aristotle&#x27;s physics, etc.). If computer circuits lack intentionality and do not store information using propositions, then in what sense can computer A have true information about the world while computer B lacks it? If the computers were instantiated in autonomous cars, we could test whether A or B successfully complete a cross-country road trip. If A succeeds while B fails, the pragmatist can say that A holds true information about the world, because A&#x27;s information allows it to make more accurate predictions (relative to B) about the world and to move around its environment more successfully. Similarly, if brain A has information that enables the biological organism to make more accurate predictions about the world and helps the organism successfully move around in the environment, then A has true information about the world. Although not advocates of eliminativism, John Shook and Tibor Solymosi argue that pragmatism is a promising program for understanding advancements in neuroscience and integrating them into a philosophical picture of the world.

==== Criticism ====
The reason naturalism cannot be pragmatic in its epistemology starts with its metaphysics. Science tells us that we are components of the natural realm, indeed latecomers in the 13.8-billion-year-old universe. The universe was not organized around our needs and abilities, and what works for us is just a set of contingent facts that could have been otherwise. Once we have begun discovering things about the universe that work for us, science sets out to explain why they do. It is clear that one explanation for why things work for us that we must rule out as unilluminating, indeed question-begging, is that they work for us because they work for us. If something works for us, enables us to meet our needs and wants, there must be an explanation reflecting facts about us and the world that produce the needs and the means to satisfy them.

The explanation of why scientific methods work for us must be a causal explanation. It must show what facts about reality make the methods we employ to acquire knowledge suitable for doing so. The explanation must show that our methods work — for example, have reliable technological application — not by coincidence, still less miracle or accident. That means there must be some facts, events, processes that operate in reality and brought about our pragmatic success. The demand that success be explained is a consequence of science&#x27;s epistemology. If the truth of such explanations consists in the fact that they work for us (as pragmatism requires), then the explanation of why our scientific methods work is that they work. That is not a satisfying explanation.

===Efficacy of folk psychology===
Some philosophers argue that folk psychology is quite successful. Simulation theorists doubt that people&#x27;s understanding of the mental can be explained in terms of a theory at all. Rather they argue that people&#x27;s understanding of others is based on internal simulations of how they would act and respond in similar situations. Jerry Fodor believes in folk psychology&#x27;s success as a theory, because it makes for an effective way of communication in everyday life that can be implemented with few words. Such effectiveness could not be achieved with complex neuroscientific terminology.

==Qualia==
Another problem for the eliminativist is the consideration that human beings undergo subjective experiences and hence their conscious mental states have qualia. Since qualia are generally regarded as characteristics of mental states, their existence does not seem compatible with eliminativism. Eliminativists such as Dennett and Rey respond by rejecting qualia. Opponents of eliminativism see this response as problematic, since many claim that existence of qualia is perfectly obvious. Many philosophers consider the &quot;elimination&quot; of qualia implausible, if not incomprehensible. They assert that, for instance, the existence of pain is simply beyond denial.

Admitting that the existence of qualia seems obvious, Dennett nevertheless holds that &quot;qualia&quot; is a theoretical term from an outdated metaphysics stemming from Cartesian intuitions. He argues that a precise analysis shows that the term is in the long run empty and full of contradictions. Eliminativism&#x27;s claim about qualia is that there is no unbiased evidence for such experiences when regarded as something more than propositional attitudes. In other words, it does not deny that pain exists, but holds that it exists independently of its effect on behavior. Influenced by Wittgenstein&#x27;s &quot;Philosophical Investigations&quot;, Dennett and Rey have defended eliminativism about qualia even when other aspects of the mental are accepted.

=== Quining qualia ===
Dennett offers philosophical thought experiments to argue that qualia do not exist. First he lists five properties of qualia:

# They are &quot;directly&quot; or &quot;immediately&quot; graspable during our conscious experiences.
# We are infallible about them.
# They are &quot;private&quot;: no one can directly access anyone else&#x27;s qualia.
# They are ineffable.
# They are &quot;intrinsic&quot; and &quot;simple&quot; or &quot;unanalyzable.&quot;

==== Inverted qualia ====

The first thought experiment Dennett uses to demonstrate that qualia lack the listed necessary properties to exist involves inverted qualia: consider two people who have different qualia but the same external physical behavior. But now the qualia supporter can present an &quot;intrapersonal&quot; variation. Suppose a neurosurgeon works on your brain and you discover that grass now looks red. Would this not be a case where we could confirm the reality of qualia—by noticing how the qualia have changed while every other aspect of our conscious experience remains the same? Not quite, Dennett replies via the next &quot;intuition pump&quot; (his term for an intuition-based thought experiment), &quot;alternative neurosurgery&quot;. There are two different ways the neurosurgeon might have accomplished the inversion. First, they might have tinkered with something &quot;early on&quot;, so that signals from the eye when you look at grass contain the information &quot;red&quot; rather than &quot;green&quot;. This would result in genuine qualia inversion. But they might instead have tinkered with your memory. Here your qualia would remain the same, but your memory would be altered so that your current green experience would contradict your earlier memories of grass. You would still feel that the color of grass had changed, but here the qualia have not changed, but your memories have. Would you be able to tell which of these scenarios is correct? No: your perceptual experience tells you that something has changed but not whether your qualia have changed. Dennett concludes, since (by hypothesis) the two surgical procedures can yield exactly the same introspective effects while only one inverts the qualia, nothing in the subject&#x27;s experience can favor one hypothesis over the other. So unless he seeks outside help, the state of his own qualia must be as unknowable to him as the state of anyone else&#x27;s. It is questionable, in short, that we have direct, infallible access to our conscious experience.

==== The experienced beer drinker ====

Dennett&#x27;s second thought experiment involves beer. Many people think of beer as an acquired taste: one&#x27;s first sip is often unpleasant, but one gradually comes to enjoy it. But wait, Dennett asks—what is the &quot;it&quot; here? Compare the flavor of that first taste with the flavor now. Does the beer taste exactly the same both then and now, only now you like that taste whereas before you disliked it? Or is it that the way beer tastes gradually shifts—so that the taste you did not like at the beginning is not the same taste you now like? In fact most people simply cannot tell which is the correct analysis. But that is to give up again on the idea that we have special and infallible access to our qualia. Further, when forced to choose, many people feel that the second analysis is more plausible. But then if one&#x27;s reactions to an experience are in any way constitutive of it, the experience is not so &quot;intrinsic&quot; after all—and another qualia property falls.

==== Inverted goggles ====

Dennett&#x27;s third thought experiment involves inverted goggles. Scientists have devised special eyeglasses that invert up and down for the wearer. When you put them on, everything looks upside down. When subjects first put them on, they can barely walk around without stumbling. But after subjects wear them for a while, something surprising occurs. They adapt and become able to walk around as easily as before. When you ask them whether they adapted by re-inverting their visual field or simply got used to walking around in an upside-down world, they cannot say. So as in our beer-drinking case, either we simply do not have the special, infallible access to our qualia that would allow us to distinguish the two cases or the way the world looks to us is actually a function of how we respond to the world—in which case qualia are not &quot;intrinsic&quot; properties of experience.

==== Criticism ====

Edward Feser objects to Dennett&#x27;s position as follows. That you need to appeal to third-person neurological evidence to determine whether your memory of your qualia has been tampered with does not seem to show that your qualia themselves—past or present—can be known only by appealing to that evidence. You might still be directly aware of your qualia from the first-person, subjective point of view even if you do not know whether they are the same as the qualia you had yesterday—just as you might really be aware of the article in front of you even if you do not know whether it is the same as the article you saw yesterday. Questions about memory do not necessarily bear on the nature of your awareness of objects present here and now (even if they bear on what you can justifiably claim to know about such objects), whatever those objects happen to be. Dennett&#x27;s assertion that scientific objectivity requires appealing exclusively to third-person evidence appears mistaken. What scientific objectivity requires is not denial of the first-person subjective point of view but rather a means of communicating inter-subjectively about what one can grasp only from that point of view. Given the relational structure first-person phenomena like qualia appear to exhibit—a structure that Carnap devoted great effort to elucidating—such a means seems available: we can communicate what we know about qualia in terms of their structural relations to one another. Dennett fails to see that qualia can be essentially subjective and still relational or non-intrinsic, and thus communicable. This communicability ensures that claims about qualia are epistemologically objective; that is, they can in principle be grasped and evaluated by all competent observers even though they are claims about phenomena that are arguably not metaphysically objective, i.e., about entities that exist only as grasped by a subject of experience. It is only the former sort of objectivity that science requires. It does not require the latter, and cannot plausibly require it if the first-person realm of qualia is what we know better than anything else.

== Illusionism ==
Illusionism is an active program within eliminative materialism to explain phenomenal consciousness as an illusion. It is promoted by the philosophers Daniel Dennett, Keith Frankish, and Jay Garfield, and the neuroscientist Michael Graziano. Graziano has advanced the attention schema theory of consciousness and postulates that consciousness is an illusion. According to David Chalmers, proponents argue that once we can explain consciousness as an illusion without the need for a realist view of consciousness, we can construct a debunking argument against realist views of consciousness. This line of argument draws from other debunking arguments like the evolutionary debunking argument in the field of metaethics. Such arguments note that morality is explained by evolution without positing moral realism, so there is a sufficient basis to debunk moral realism.

=== Criticism ===

Illusionists generally hold that once it is explained why people believe and say they are conscious, the hard problem of consciousness will dissolve. Chalmers agrees that a mechanism for these beliefs and reports can and should be identified using the standard methods of physical science, but disagrees that this would support illusionism, saying that the datum illusionism fails to account for is not reports of consciousness but rather first-person consciousness itself. He separates consciousness from beliefs and reports about consciousness, but holds that a fully satisfactory theory of consciousness should explain how the two are &quot;inextricably intertwined&quot; so that their alignment does not require an inexplicable coincidence. Illusionism has also been criticized by the philosopher Jesse Prinz.

<text>Faaa International Airport (), also known as Tahiti International Airport , is the international airport of French Polynesia, located in the commune of Faaa, on the island of Tahiti. It is situated southwest of Papeete, the capital city of the overseas collectivity. It opened in 1960. Regional air carrier Air Tahiti and international air carrier Air Tahiti Nui are both based at the airport.

== Overview ==
Faaa International Airport serves both domestic and international flights. Air Tahiti has daily flights to most other islands in French Polynesia and one international service to the Cook Islands. There are intercontinental flights to Canada, Chile, Metropolitan France, Japan, New Zealand and the United States. The airport is on Tahiti, which is an island among the Windward Islands, the eastern part of the Society Islands. Because of limited level terrain, rather than leveling large stretches of sloping agricultural land, the airport is built primarily on reclaimed land on the coral reef just offshore.

The airport is operated by Setil Aéroports and has a single runway, that can accommodate aircraft up to Boeing 747 and Airbus A380 size.

==History==

Prior to the construction of the airport, Papeete was served by Short Sandringham &quot;Bermuda&quot; flying boat seaplanes operated by Reseau Aerien Interinsulaire (RAI). There was a connecting service via Bora Bora Airport (BOB) to Los Angeles with an en route stop in Honolulu flown by Transports Aeriens Intercontinentaux (TAI), which was serving Bora Bora in 1960 with Douglas DC-7C propliners. Later the same year, following the opening of the new airport, TAI began serving Papeete directly with DC-7C flights once a week on a round trip routing of Nouméa (NOU) – Nadi (NAN) – Papeete (PPT) – Honolulu (HNL) – Los Angeles (LAX). U.S. based air carrier South Pacific Air Lines was also serving Papeete in 1960, with weekly nonstop flights to Honolulu operated with Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation propliners. By 1962, South Pacific was operating weekly nonstop Super Constellation service to Pago Pago in American Samoa in addition to its flights to Honolulu.

Transports Aériens Intercontinentaux then introduced Douglas DC-8 jet service and in 1962 was operating nonstop DC-8 flights to Los Angeles, Honolulu and Nadi. The latter flight continued on to Nouméa, with connecting DC-8 service being flown to Paris via Nouméa in association with Air France via a number of intermediate stops en route. TAI subsequently merged with Union Aéromaritime de Transport in 1963 to form Union de Transports Aériens (UTA), which in turn continued to serve Papeete with DC-8 jet flights. In 1964, UTA was operating nonstop DC-8 service to Los Angeles, Honolulu and Nadi as well as direct one stop service to Nouméa, with the flights to Los Angeles offering connecting service to and from Air France nonstop flights between LAX and Paris Orly Airport (ORY).

By the mid 1960s, Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) was operating nonstop Boeing 707 jetliner flights to Los Angeles and Auckland, with direct one stop service to San Francisco via Los Angeles, and also direct to Honolulu via a stop at Pago Pago in American Samoa. By 1976, Pan Am was operating direct 707 service once a week to Dallas/Fort Worth and on to New York JFK Airport via stops in Pago Pago and Honolulu, and by 1979 was operating all of its flights from the airport with Boeing 747 wide body aircraft.

LAN-Chile, the predecessor of LATAM Chile, introduced Douglas DC-6B propliner service between the airport and Santiago, Chile via a stop at Easter Island during the late 1960s, and by 1970 was operating Boeing 707 jet service from Santiago via Easter Island to Papeete, with direct connecting 707 service via its Santiago hub from Buenos Aires and Rio de Janeiro in South America as well as from Madrid, Paris and Frankfurt in Europe. LATAM Chile currently flies the Papeete – Easter Island – Santiago route with Boeing 787 aircraft.

In 1970, Union de Transports Aériens was operating all flights into the airport with long range Douglas DC-8-62 jetliners. UTA then introduced McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 wide body jet service between Papeete and Los Angeles during the mid 1970s. By 1979, UTA was operating all of its Papeete flights with DC-10-30 jets, with nonstops to Los Angeles, Auckland and Nadi, and direct one stop service to Sydney and Nouméa as well as multistop service to Jakarta, Singapore, Bahrain and Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG). In 1983, UTA was operating Boeing 747 service into the airport in addition to its DC-10-30 flights.

The airport was previously served by several other international airlines, including AOM French Airlines and Qantas, with flights not only to their respective home countries but also to Los Angeles. In 1965, Qantas was also operating a service it called the &quot;Fiesta Route&quot; with a Boeing 707 flying round trip once a week on a routing of Sydney – Nadi – Papeete – Acapulco – Mexico City – Nassau – Bermuda – London Heathrow Airport. By 1976, Qantas was operating twice weekly nonstop Boeing 707 service to Vancouver, Canada in addition to its flights to Nadi and Sydney. In 1991, French air carrier Minerve was operating McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 service once a week on a routing of Papeete – San Francisco – Paris Orly Airport.

Air New Zealand has served Tahiti for many years and was operating Douglas DC-8 jet service in 1968 with a routing of Auckland – Papeete – Los Angeles. By 1975, Air New Zealand flew a DC-8 four times a week from Auckland to Papete via Nandi and Rarotonga. In 1983, Air New Zealand was operating direct one stop, no change of plane Boeing 747 service twice a week between London Gatwick Airport (LGW) and Papeete via Los Angeles. By 1987, the airline was operating weekly nonstop Boeing 747 service to Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) with this flight originating in Auckland and continuing on to London Gatwick (LGW) from DFW. Air New Zealand currently operates nonstop Boeing 787-9 service several days a week between the airport and Auckland.

According to the Official Airline Guide (OAG), by the 1980s and 1990s, major air carriers serving Papeete primarily operated wide body jetliners such as the Boeing 747-100, 747-200 (including B747-200 passenger/freighter combi aircraft), 747-300, 747-400, 767-300 or McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 on their flights.

South Pacific Island Airways served the airport during the early 1980s with nonstop Boeing 707 flights to Honolulu. Also during the early 1980s, Air New Zealand, Polynesian Airlines and UTA were all operating Boeing 737-200 service to Papeete from several South Pacific island locations including Apia, Nadi, Niue and Rarotonga while local Tahiti-based air carrier Air Polynesia (also known as Air Polynésie and now Air Tahiti) was serving a number of islands in French Polynesia with Fairchild F-27, Fokker F27 and de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter turboprop aircraft . Hawaiian Airlines was operating nonstop Douglas DC-8 service from Papeete to Honolulu by the late 1980s. By 1987, Continental Airlines was operating nonstop McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 service twice a week from the airport to Los Angeles with this flight continuing on direct to Houston Intercontinental Airport (IAH).

In early 1989, five airlines were operating nonstop wide body jetliner flights from Papeete to Los Angeles (LAX) including Air France, Air New Zealand and Qantas with all three operating Boeing 747 service while at the same time Continental Airlines and UTA were both operating McDonnell Douglas DC-10 service on the route with a combined total of ten nonstops a week being operated by the five air carriers to LAX. From LAX, the Air France flights continued on to Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG) while the Qantas flights continued on to San Francisco (SFO). In addition, UTA was operating three DC-10 flights a week nonstop to San Francisco (SFO) at this same time with two of these flights continuing on to Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG) while the third flight continued on to LAX.

Air Tahiti Nui, which is based at the airport, was operating nonstop service between Papeete and New York JFK Airport during the mid 2000s with Airbus A340-300 aircraft; however, the airline was no longer flying this route by 2009. Air Tahiti Nui currently operates nonstop flights to Auckland, Los Angeles and Tokyo as well as direct service to Paris via Los Angeles and has added new Boeing 787-9 &quot;Dreamliner&quot; aircraft to its fleet.

In October 2017, the airport received its first charter flight from China, a Hainan Airlines Airbus A330.

==Accidents and incidents==

*On 22 July 1973, Pan Am Flight 816, a Boeing 707, crashed into the sea just after take-off, killing 78 of 79 occupants.
*On February 19, 1985, a UTA DC-10 operating from Los Angeles to Auckland via Papeete made an emergency landing at Rangiroa following a telephoned bomb threat. Passengers and luggage were removed and flown to Tahiti onboard French military aircraft. The aircraft was searched and no bomb was found. The aircraft was flown empty to Papeete a week later.
*On 12 September 1993, Air France Flight 072, a Boeing 747–428 from Los Angeles to Papeete, ran off the runway on landing and into a lagoon. The nose of the 747 was submerged in the water. There were no fatalities.
*On 24 December 2000, Hawaiian Airlines Flight 481, a DC-10-10, overshot the runway on landing and slid off the tarmac during a storm. There was one minor injury and no fatalities.
* On 9 August 2007, Air Moorea Flight 1121 crashed into the ocean shortly after takeoff from Moorea Airport on Moorea Island in French Polynesia, killing all 20 people on board. It was bound for Tahiti&#x27;s Fa&#x27;a&#x27;ā International Airport on a regular 7-minute service, one of the shortest on earth, scheduled 40 to 50 times a day. The crash resulted from loss of control due to failure of the airplane&#x27;s elevator cable. Frequent takeoff and landing are believed to have been a major factor in the crash, because of wear and tear on the elevator cables, inspected only at fixed time intervals, regardless of usage. Another factor may have been jet-blast from large planes pushing back from the ramp at Fa&#x27;a&#x27;ā International.

<text>&quot;The New Colossus&quot; is a sonnet by American poet Emma Lazarus (1849–1887). She wrote the poem in 1883 to raise money for the construction of a pedestal for the Statue of Liberty (&quot;Liberty Enlightening the World&quot;). In 1903, the poem was cast onto a bronze plaque and mounted inside the pedestal&#x27;s lower level.

== History ==

This poem was written as a donation to an auction of art and literary works conducted by the &quot;Art Loan Fund Exhibition in Aid of the Bartholdi Pedestal Fund for the Statue of Liberty&quot; to raise money for the pedestal&#x27;s construction. Lazarus&#x27;s contribution was solicited by fundraiser William Maxwell Evarts. Initially, she refused but writer Constance Cary Harrison convinced her that the statue would be of great significance to immigrants sailing into the harbor. Lazarus was involved in aiding Jewish refugees to New York who had fled antisemitic pogroms in eastern Europe, and she saw a way to express her empathy for these refugees in terms of the statue.

&quot;The New Colossus&quot; was the first entry read at the exhibit&#x27;s opening on November 2, 1883. It remained associated with the exhibit through a published catalog until the exhibit closed after the pedestal was fully funded in August 1885, but was forgotten and played no role at the opening of the statue in 1886. It was, however, published in Joseph Pulitzer&#x27;s &quot;New York World&quot; as well as &quot;The New York Times&quot; during this time period. In 1901, Lazarus&#x27;s friend Georgina Schuyler began an effort to memorialize Lazarus and her poem, which succeeded in 1903 when a plaque bearing the text of the poem was put on the inner wall of the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty.

On the plaque hanging inside the Statue of Liberty, the line &quot;Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!&quot; is missing the comma after the word &quot;keep.&quot; The plaque also describes itself as an engraving; it is actually a casting.

The original manuscript is held by the American Jewish Historical Society.

== Interpretation ==

The poem is a Petrarchan sonnet.

The title of the poem and the first two lines reference the Greek Colossus of Rhodes, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, a famously gigantic sculpture that stood beside or straddled the entrance to the harbor of the island of Rhodes in the 3rd century BC. In the poem, Lazarus contrasts that ancient symbol of grandeur and empire (&quot;the brazen giant of Greek fame&quot;) with a &quot;New&quot; Colossus – the Statue of Liberty, a female embodiment of commanding &quot;maternal strength&quot; (&quot;Mother of Exiles&quot;).

The &quot;sea-washed, sunset gates&quot; are the mouths of the Hudson and East Rivers, to the west of Brooklyn. The &quot;imprisoned lightning&quot; refers to the electric light in the torch, then a novelty.

The &quot;air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame&quot; refers to New York Harbor between New York City and Brooklyn, which were separate cities at the time the poem was written, before being consolidated as boroughs of the City of Greater New York in 1898.

The &quot;huddled masses&quot; refers to the large numbers of immigrants arriving in the United States in the 1880s, particularly through the port of New York. Lazarus was an activist and advocate for Jewish refugees fleeing persecution in Imperial Russia.

== Influence ==
===Immigration to the United States===

Paul Auster wrote, &quot;Bartholdi&#x27;s gigantic effigy was originally intended as a monument to the principles of international republicanism, but &#x27;The New Colossus&#x27; reinvented the statue&#x27;s purpose, turning Liberty into a welcoming mother, a symbol of hope to the outcasts and downtrodden of the world.&quot;

John T. Cunningham wrote, &quot;The Statue of Liberty was not conceived and sculpted as a symbol of immigration, but it quickly became so as immigrant ships passed under the torch and the shining face, heading toward Ellis Island. However, it was [Lazarus&#x27;s poem] that permanently stamped on Miss Liberty the role of unofficial greeter of incoming immigrants.&quot;

The poem was quoted in John F. Kennedy&#x27;s book &quot;A Nation of Immigrants&quot; (1958). In 2019, during the first Trump administration, Ken Cuccinelli, whom Trump appointed as acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, revised a line from the poem in support of the administration&#x27;s &quot;public charge rule&quot;, which would have rejected would-be immigrants who lacked adequate income and education to support themselves. Cuccinelli would have rewritten the caveat as, &quot;Give me your tired and your poor who can stand on their own two feet, and who will not become a public charge&quot;. He later suggested that the &quot;huddled masses&quot; should be European, and he downplayed the poem as &quot;not actually part of the original Statue of Liberty.&quot; Cuccinelli&#x27;s remark prompted criticism. The Trump administration rule was later blocked by a federal appeals court.

== Cultural reception ==

Lazarus&#x27;s sonnet appears in various creative works. The 1941 motion picture &quot;Hold Back the Dawn&quot; paraphrases &quot;The New Colossus&quot; in its dialogue. Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s wartime film &quot;Saboteur&quot; (1942) had dialogue near the close, in which a character quotes lines from the sonnet. An Irving Berlin production called &quot;Miss Liberty&quot; ran for about a year around 1949. One of the songs was &quot;Give Me Your Tired, Your Poor&quot;. The musician Joan Baez collaborated on a soundtrack to Italian film &quot;Sacco &amp; Vanzetti&quot; and used text from &quot;The New Colossus&quot; for some of the lyrics. &quot;Give Me Your Tired, Your Poor&quot;—a song from the soundtrack of 1986 animated film &quot;An American Tail&quot;—includes a choral arrangement of &quot;The New Colossus&quot; praised by &quot;The Mary Sue&quot; as &quot;powerful stuff&quot;. By 2020, the American Jewish Historical Society in New York City produced a &quot;New Colossus Project&quot; of exhibitions, videos, and curriculum related to the poem. It also hosts the &quot;Emma Lazarus Translation Project&quot;. Translations of the poem into other languages by poets from around the world are collected.

<doc id="350953" wikidata="Q1386511" url="?curid=350953" title="Ronald Munro Ferguson, 1st Viscount Novar">
<text>Ronald Craufurd Munro Ferguson, 1st Viscount Novar, (6 March 1860 – 30 March 1934) was a British politician who served as the sixth Governor-General of Australia, in office from 1914 to 1920.

Munro Ferguson was born in Kirkcaldy, Fife, Scotland. He attended the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and initially pursued a military career. Munro Ferguson was elected to the House of Commons in 1884, defeated a year later, and re-elected in 1886. A Liberal Imperialist, he was an ally of Lord Rosebery and served as a Junior Lord of the Treasury in his government. Munro Ferguson was overlooked for ministerial office by Henry Campbell-Bannerman and H. H. Asquith, but in 1914 was appointed Governor-General of Australia. He was politically influential, forming a close bond with Prime Minister Billy Hughes, and was committed to his role as nominal commander-in-chief during World War I. His six years in office was a record until being surpassed by another wartime governor-general, Lord Gowrie. Munro Ferguson was raised to the viscountcy once his term ended, and from 1922 to 1924, returned to politics as Secretary of State for Scotland under Bonar Law and Stanley Baldwin. In retirement he held various company directorships.

==Background and education==

Munro Ferguson was born Ronald Craufurd Ferguson at his family home in the Raith area near Kirkcaldy, Fife, Scotland, the son and eldest child of Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Ferguson, a wealthy member of the Commons of old Scottish descent. His mother was Emma Eliza, daughter of James Henry Mandeville of Merton, Surrey. He was a grandson of General Richard C. Ferguson. In 1864, his father inherited the baronies of Novar in Ross-shire and Muirton in Morayshire, and took the additional surname Munro.

Educated at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, he pursued a military career until 1884. Ferguson joined the 1st Fife Light Horse in 1875: a militia regiment of gentlemen. Three years later, he entered RMA Sandhurst. On the officer&#x27;s course for a year, he was gazetted to the Grenadier Guards with a commission. He served in the army for a short service limited commission, leaving in 1884 on returning from India. Ferguson joined the Oswald of Dunnikier Lodge 468 on 24 December 1888.

==Political life, 1884–1914==

In 1884, Munro Ferguson was elected to the House of Commons, but was defeated at the general election of November 1885 by a Crofter candidate in Ross and Cromarty. One historian had accused him of scheming with the Duke of Argyll to corrupt the electoral process. He was defeated again the following year in Dunbartonshire. But at a by-election in July 1886 he secured the nomination at Leith Burghs, principally on the advice of Lord Rosebery. Gladstone had won two unopposed seats but, on refusing Leith to prevent a suspected Unionist Michael Jacks, it became vacant. In August a by-election was held and Home Rule candidate Munro Ferguson was elected.

Gladstone appointed him private secretary to Lord Rosebery, a leading Liberal. Like Rosebery, Munro Ferguson would become a Liberal Imperialist, and a personal friend of the colourful earl. He accompanied Rosebery and his wife, Hannah, on a tour of India in 1886-7 and again in 1892-4. When Rosebery became prime minister, Ferguson was promoted in the Treasury department as a junior whip with responsibilities for Scotland. Ferguson continued to urge radicalism to bring Home Rule for Scotland on his friend, whom he supported in 1887 for the Liberal Party leadership.

He supported the imperial policies of the Conservative government during the Second Boer War, which made him highly unpopular with the radical, anti-war wing of the Liberal Party. Matters came to a head when he was threatened by Grey in a letter on 18 October 1900. The Liberals had lost another general election to the &#x27;Khaki&#x27; Conservatives and so Ferguson disgusted by the derision and division &quot;chucked it&quot; in resigning as Scottish whip. A member of the Liberal Imperialist Council, he was disaffected by the bad treatment of his mentor Rosebery. Nonetheless, he was compelled to work with &#x27;Limps&#x27;, derisively dubbed by republicans, on &quot;lines of speeches&quot; for &quot;the Asquith Committee&quot; which now controlled the party&#x27;s Imperialist wing now renamed The Liberal League. Grey, Haldane and the rest seized control of the organization and its administration: the preface to which was Rosebery&#x27;s remarkable volte face over the South African War, leaving his friend forced to admit to Munro Ferguson &quot;should an Asquith Government be formed he might go abroad.&quot;

He, therefore, had little hope of Cabinet office in the governments of Campbell-Bannerman or Asquith, despite his obvious talents. In December 1905, he requested the new Liberal cabinet make him Governor of Bombay but was refused. Instead, he had to be content with provost of Kirkcaldy. He nursed a burning resentment against &quot;over genial&quot; plebeian Asquith. Increasingly, his job in government and liaison of his group had been taken over by R B Haldane when he made it clear in 1907 his decided opposition &quot;to keep Asquith out of the leadership...He has come to be quite unreliable...&quot; But &quot;the political disaster&quot; that he called Asquith&#x27;s succession made his political career untenable. He was a property owner in Asquith&#x27;s constituency, a neighbour of Haldane, and just like him had gained the patronage of Lord Morley; they were idealists for social reform.

==Governor-General of Australia, 1914–1920==

In February 1914, therefore, Munro Ferguson was happy to accept the post of Governor-General of Australia (he had refused the governorship of South Australia in 1895 and that of Victoria in 1910). He was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG) prior to his appointment on 18 May 1914. His political background, his connections with the Liberal government in London and his imperialist views made him both better equipped and more inclined to play an activist role in Australian politics than any of his predecessors. At the same time, he had enough sense to confine his activism to behind the scenes influence. He was described as &quot;an active Imperial supervisor&quot; by the journalist, Keith Murdoch, using his own cipher to signal London.

During the First World War, which broke out in August 1914, the reciprocal power of the Australian High Commission in London was severely restricted and Government House had a furious falling out with the then Governor of New South Wales, Sir Gerald Strickland. They grew to hate one another and the latter was jealous of Melbourne&#x27;s superior power and location of governance. The British Government underfunded the federal government and ignored the huge debts spent by State Governors on public works but it was the most active government since federation; and Munro-Ferguson its most active ambassador.

He developed close friendships with two judges of the High Court of Australia: Sir Samuel Griffith (the Chief Justice, and former Premier of Queensland) and Sir Edmund Barton (former Prime Minister of Australia). He consulted Griffith and Barton on many occasions, including on the exercise of the reserve powers of the Crown.

===Strickland===

Although &#x27;a genial host and brilliant controversialist&#x27;, Sir Gerald Strickland &#x27;his tactlessness caused some uneasiness&#x27;. The new Governor-General found himself in a struggle over precedence. The post of New South Wales Governor was the oldest in Australia and had long been considered the most powerful. But, by law, the royal appointment to Government House held sway. During the First World War, the strain began to show in the London Liberal government. Ferguson was desperate to keep secrecy, and maintain control over policy access to London. On 3 June 1916, the Colonial Secretary informed Ferguson that a coalition was pending. Strickland, having snubbed the Government in Melbourne, went over the Governor-General&#x27;s head directly to London. Strickland worked up an ANZAC day annual memorial, which proved very popular – but which Strickland claimed was a national celebration. On 1 May 1917, Munro Ferguson confessed to Lord Stamfordham that he had under-estimated the deep emotional loyalty of ordinary Australians. Press belief that Anzacs were the spearhead elite and shocktroops among dominions gave a status in the British Empire&#x27;s armies they sustained throughout the war.

===Australian federal election, 1914===

It was advantageous that Munro Ferguson was politically experienced because he arrived in Melbourne, then the site of the Parliament of Australia, to find himself in the midst of a political crisis. The Liberal government of Joseph Cook had a one-seat majority in the House of Representatives, but the Labor Party had a majority in the Senate and had used it systematically to frustrate the government. Cook was now determined to force a double dissolution election under Section 57 of the Constitution.

On 2 June 1914, barely three weeks after Munro Ferguson had taken office, Cook formally requested a double dissolution. Munro Ferguson had several things to consider. The Parliament elected in 1913 still had two years to run. Cook had not been defeated in the House of Representatives. His sole reason for wanting a dissolution was that he did not control the Senate. This was a situation without precedent in the United Kingdom, where the upper house, the House of Lords, is unelected.

When Munro Ferguson granted Cook a double dissolution, he was furiously denounced by the Labor Party: who maintained that Cook was manipulating the Constitution to gain control of the Senate. Munro Ferguson, influenced by the British House of Lords crisis of 1910, took the view that the lower house should prevail. Paradoxically, it was Cook&#x27;s Liberal Party who argued that the Governor-General should always take the advice of his prime minister, while Labor argued that he should exercise his discretion.

In the middle of the campaign for the 1914 election, news arrived of the outbreak of the First World War. This caused an acute crisis in Australian government. Parliament had been dissolved and the government was in caretaker mode. Furthermore, Australia in 1914 did not have the right to independent participation in international affairs, and so its politicians were completely inexperienced in such.

In these circumstances, Munro Ferguson was the only man with both the constitutional authority and the confidence to act. It was he who convened the Cabinet, implemented the mobilisation plan and communicated with the Cabinet in London. Cook&#x27;s manoeuvring backfired when Labor won the September election and Andrew Fisher was returned to office.

===Australia at war===

The Inspector-General William Bridges was given the task of creating an expeditionary force of 20,000 men. Bridges and General White admired the fact that George Pearce, the Minister for Defence in 1914, had been already converted by the 1911 Imperial Defence Conference to a British world view. There was to be one Corps, this led to a second Australian Corps, and even the possibility of a full army recruited solely from Australia. In 1914, Bridges was replaced by the British Indian Army General William Birdwood.

Munro-Ferguson was an enthusiastic supporter of Australian soldiers. He indicated to Colonial Secretary Bonar Law, that General Hamilton had made tactless remarks about officer&#x27;s class breeding during the Dardanelles campaign. Yet Bonar Law had earlier mentioned Hamilton&#x27;s praise for the Australians by letter on 24 Aug 1915. Winston Churchill did not help when hinting &#x27;wastage&#x27; could be made up from former wounded Australians, and communicating the idea to Munro-Ferguson. A journalist Keith Murdoch tried to take documents from the imperial base at Egypt to London, to meet PM Asquith and Lord Northcliffe of &quot;The Times&quot;. He was intercepted &quot;en route&quot; by British intelligence, under orders from General Hamilton. Bonar Law remained critical of the policy and joined David Lloyd George to bring about a Coalition.

Billy Hughes was the driving force behind the war effort and the policy of conscription. The incoming Labor Premier formed a close relationship with Munro Ferguson, who recognised his ability. Munro Ferguson saw his role in wartime as an agent of the British war effort, not just a representative of the Crown. He openly supported those who were committed to the war, and opposed those who were not. Munro-Ferguson sent secret memos to London.

Against the advice, he warned New Zealand against German cruiser &quot;Emden&quot;. In the Pacific, Japan were allies; but their naval expansionary plans worried. The Colonial Secretary adopted a policy similar to Conservative Sir Stafford Northcote, Governor-General (1904–8). Munro Ferguson was actively travelling the country reviewing troops, meeting dignitaries, and seeing munitions factories. Through an active correspondence with General Birdwood, his influence was felt over senior military appointments. His authority firmly stamped on the Dominion, he favoured Gen Brudenell White over Gen Monash, the eventual commander of AIF.

In October 1915, Fisher resigned and was succeeded as prime minister by Hughes. Munro Ferguson recognised Hughes&#x27;s qualities as a war leader and supported him privately and publicly, in a way that stretched constitutional propriety. Hughes was convinced that only the introduction of conscription would allow Australia to maintain its commitment to the war effort and Munro Ferguson gave him every encouragement. Hughes&#x27; answer was to call-up 50,000 more men – but without planning ahead. Hughes refused to call a debate in the Federal parliament.

Munro Ferguson regarded the defeat of the conscription plebiscites in October 1916 and December 1917 as disasters for Australia and the war effort. He also believed that the British Empire needed an integrationist bluewater policy that mixed Canadian and British troops with Australians in the regimental system. The Governor made it clear that the war was simply and justly a big fight: &quot;The absence of carping here over the premature bombardment, and the postponed list casualties is beyond all praise&quot;, he wrote of the ANZAC at Gallipoli. In Munro-Ferguson&#x27;s opinion the press was a victim of hyperbole on Australian soldiers: &quot;big-noting ...tale of heroism that thrilled the world&quot;.

When Hughes was expelled from the Labor Party after the first plebiscite, Munro Ferguson allowed him to stay in office as a minority prime minister, supported by Cook&#x27;s Liberals. He encouraged Hughes and Cook to form a new party on a &quot;win the war&quot; platform. This party, the Nationalist Party, was formed later in 1916 with Hughes as leader and Cook as deputy leader. During the second plebiscite campaign, Hughes pledged to resign if it were not carried. The plebiscite lost, and Hughes followed through on his promise to resign. However, there were no alternative candidates, and Munro Ferguson used his reserve power to promptly recommission Hughes — thus allowing Hughes to stay in office while fulfilling his promise to stand down.

When David Lloyd George became prime minister in Britain, Hughes communicated directly with him (sometimes in Welsh), causing Munro Ferguson to complain that he was being denied his proper role as the medium of communication between London and Melbourne. Despite Munro Ferguson&#x27;s vigorous assertion of his rights as Governor-General, he could not in the long run halt the decline in the influence of the office.

Once Australia gained the right to independent participation in international affairs, which it did in 1918, Munro Ferguson&#x27;s days of influence were over.

Alone among the Dominion forces, the Defence Force Act 1903 (Cth) reserved the power to confirm a death sentence passed by Australian courts-martial not to the commander-in-chief of the theatre, but to the Governor-General of Australia. Munro Ferguson refused to confirm the sentence on any of the 113 Australian soldiers condemned by courts-martial.

==Post-war==

After the war, trade was restored with Britain, but protectionist and isolationists Conservative policies threatened the Liberal Imperialist vision of unity. In May 1919, Munro Ferguson advised London of his desire to resign. He was pressed to stay on to oversee the Australian tour of the Prince of Wales in 1920. Ferguson left Australia as her most successful Governor-General to date. Australia had played an integral and significant military role in supporting the imperial war effort, but Hughes continued to disrupt imperial unity: the people were now calling for more democracy. He finally departed in October 1920, after more than six years in post.

On his return home, he was raised to the peerage as Viscount Novar, of Raith in the County of Fife and of Novar in the County of Ross on 6 December, named for Novar House, Raith which was the ancestral seat of the Ferguson family. The Liberal PM Lloyd George appointed Novar to be vice-President of the Committee of Council of Education. He was a close political friend of Sir Edward Grey, and took an active part in the business of the Lords. As Vice-President of the Council on Education he was responsible for oversight in 1922.

===Later career===

On the collapse of the Coalition, he was adopted by another Scot, Bonar Law, who made Novar Secretary of State for Scotland. Following an official ceremony, he received the Freedom of Edinburgh in 1923; he took an interest in the history and traditions of his homeland. After the brief interlude of the Labour government he left the Scottish office, and was appointed as Chairman of the Political Honours Committee. Whereas in Scotland he became a Member of the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland and Construction. He remained a Liberal under the new leadership, and was invited to the Board of Trust of National Liberals of Scotland. Taking on directorships he was Chairman of the North British and Mercantile Insurance Company. He was a Director of the Rail Passengers Insurance Company, and of the Union Bank of Scotland: executive posts he held until his death. Novar was granted further honours when he was appointed a Knight of the Thistle (KT) in 1926.

==Personal life and death==

Lord Novar married Lady Helen Hermione (1863 – 9 April 1941), daughter of Lord Dufferin, in 1889. The union was childless. They lived at 18 Portman Square, when in London. He was a member of the Athenaeum Club and Reform Club.

Lady Novar&#x27;s work for the British Red Cross Society, which included converting the ballroom of Melbourne&#x27;s Government House for this purpose, earned her appointment as a Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE) in 1918.

Lord Novar died at his home on 30 March 1934, aged 74, the title Viscount Novar dying with him as he left no issue. The titles Baron of Novar and Baron of Muirton became dormant. His papers are an extremely important source for historians of Australian politics and Australia&#x27;s role in the First World War. He was a close friend of Sir Cecil Spring Rice, with whom he corresponded for many years. Lady Novar died in 1941.

==Legacy==

* Novar Gardens, South Australia were named in 1921 in honour of Viscount Novar. 
* A Sydney Harbour ferry, &quot;Lady Ferguson&quot; (built 1914), was named after Lady Novar, as a continuation of a naming convention whereby ferries were named after wives of Governors-General of Australia and Governors of NSW.

<text>Cabinet Entertainment, previously known as Paradox Entertainment, is a company dealing in intellectual properties and making motion pictures thereof. All business is conducted from the main office in Los Angeles, United States. The company was founded in 2015 by CEO Fredrik Malmberg, previously co-founder of Swedish role-playing game publishing house Target Games and CEO of Paradox Entertainment.

Some of its most famous holdings are trademarks and certain rights related to Conan the Barbarian, a character created by pulp author Robert E. Howard and expanded upon by many other authors over the years. Cabinet owns these rights through Conan Properties International, a wholly owned subsidiary. Other properties held by Cabinet Entertainment include Bran Mak Morn, Kull, Solomon Kane, Mutant, Mutant Chronicles, Warzone, Kult, and Chronopia. Former licences include Heavy Gear.

Cabinet Entertainment is now owned by Tencent via Funcom.

== History ==

Paradox Entertainment started out in 1999, created from the bankrupted Target Games (known at that time as &quot;Target Games Interactive&quot;), a Swedish role-playing games company.

In 2004, the company moved its business to Los Angeles. At this time, the Stockholm operation was spun off into Paradox Interactive.

Paradox Entertainment claims that the company owns the rights to all of Robert E. Howard&#x27;s stories and characters.

On August 21, 2011, the day the 2011 film &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; opened, SLMI (Stan Lee Media Inc.) unsuccessfully sued Paradox Entertainment, Conan Sales Co., Arthur Lieberman, and others over the rights to Conan, as they claim Conan was improperly transferred to Conan Sales Co. and sold to Paradox.

In 2012, rights for Conan movie sequels reverted from Millennium Films Inc. to Conan Properties International, a wholly owned subsidiary of Paradox Entertainment.

In 2015, Cabinet Entertainment, a new company of CEO (through Cabinet Holdings), acquired Paradox Entertainment Inc. and all subsidiaries and their properties, including the Robert E. Howard properties Conan, Kull, and Solomon Kane, as well as the original Target/Paradox properties Mutant Chronicles/Warzone, Kult, Chronopia, and Mutant. The purchase price for all shares in PEINC amounted to $7 million in cash.

In April 2018, Cabinet joined with video game publisher Funcom to set up Heroic Signatures, an outfit intended to develop Cabinet&#x27;s intellectual properties into video games.

In September 2020, it was announced that Netflix will develop a new Conan TV series as a part of a larger deal involving Fredrik Malmberg and Mark Wheeler from Pathfinder Media between Netflix and Conan Properties International, owned by Cabinet Entertainment, for the exclusive rights to their Conan library for the rights for live-action and animated films and TV shows.

In September 2021, Funcom acquired Cabinet Group, the parent company to Cabinet Entertainment. Funcom, which had already developed and published games based on intellectual properties under license from Cabinet, planned to continue to expand on these properties with the acquisition. Cabinet founder Fredrik Malmberg will become president of Heroic Signatures.

== Other company connections ==
Cabinet Entertainment used to be publicly listed in Stockholm, Sweden. The company called Paradox Entertainment listed on OMX Nasdaq is now called Sensori AB and dealt in medical supplies, until it entered into liquidation on 31 August 2020. Specifically, Paradox Entertainment AB (the Swedish, listed, company) sold off all its operations to Paradox Entertainment Inc. (its American subsidiary). The Swedish company acquired its new medical operations by buying Akloma Tinnitus AB and changing its name, while the American company was purchased by its previous CEO Fredrik Malmberg through Cabinet.

Paradox Interactive, based in Stockholm, is a completely separate entity, no longer a part of Paradox Entertainment.

<text>Saale-Holzland (official German name: Saale-Holzland-Kreis) is a &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) in the east of Thuringia, Germany. Neighboring districts are (from the north clockwise) the district Burgenlandkreis in Saxony-Anhalt, the district-free city Gera, the districts Greiz, Saale-Orla, Saalfeld-Rudolstadt, Weimarer Land and the district-free city Jena.

==History==
The district was created in 1994 by merging the previous districts of Eisenberg, Jena and Stadtroda. When the district Roda (later Stadtroda) was originally created in 1922 it already covered nearly the area of the current district. In 1952, together with the abolishment of the federal states (&quot;Bundesländer&quot;) the district was split into the three parts, which were put together again in 1994.
==Geography==
The main river in the district is the Saale, which also gave it its name. The highest elevation with 475 m above sea level is in the south of the district, the lowest with 118 m is in the Saale valley at the boundary to the district Weimarer Land.

==Coat of arms==
In the left of the coat of arms is the silver bar as the symbol of the Lords of Lobdeburg, who owned of the valley of the Saale in the 13th century. In the bottom is the lion of the Counts of Orlamünde, surrounded by 6 hearts. Their county went into the ownership of the Wettin family in 1396. The coat of arms of Saxony in the right is the same as the coat of arms of the Wettin, as they later became the rulers of Saxony. The coat of arms was approved on August 18, 1997.

<doc id="350966" wikidata="Q4354986" url="?curid=350966" title="Emergent materialism">
<text>In the philosophy of mind, emergent (or emergentist) materialism is a theory which asserts that the mind is irreducibly existent in some sense. However, the mind does not exist in the sense of being an ontological simple. Further, the study of mental phenomena is independent of other sciences. The theory primarily maintains that the human mind&#x27;s evolution is a product of material nature and that it cannot exist without material basis.

==Overview==
The view holds that mental properties emerge as novel properties of complex material systems. These are conceptually irreducible as physical properties of the complexes that have them. The theory, however, states that the mind is independent due to the causal influences between body and mind. This is described as a &quot;primitive relation&quot; that is grounded in or dependent on the physical, but with metaphysical necessity. 

Emergent materialism can be divided into emergence which denies mental causation and emergence which allows for causal effect. A version of the latter type has been advocated by John R. Searle, called biological naturalism. 
The other main group of materialist views in the philosophy of mind can be labeled non-emergent (or non-emergentist) materialism, and includes pure physicalism (eliminative materialism), identity theory (reductive materialism), philosophical behaviorism, and functionalism.

<text>Polynesians are an ethnolinguistic group comprising closely related ethnic groups native to Polynesia, which encompasses the islands within the Polynesian Triangle in the Pacific Ocean. They trace their early prehistoric origins to Island Southeast Asia and are part of the larger Austronesian ethnolinguistic group, with an Urheimat in Taiwan. They speak the Polynesian languages, a branch of the Oceanic subfamily within the Austronesian language family. The Indigenous Māori people form the largest Polynesian population, followed by Samoans, Native Hawaiians, Tahitians, Tongans, and Cook Islands Māori.

, there were an estimated 2 million ethnic Polynesians (both full and part) worldwide. The vast majority either inhabit independent Polynesian nation-states (Samoa, Niue, Cook Islands, Tonga, and Tuvalu) or form minorities in countries such as Australia, Chile (Easter Island), New Zealand, France (French Polynesia and Wallis and Futuna), and the United States (Hawaii and American Samoa), as well as in the British Overseas Territory of the Pitcairn Islands. New Zealand had the highest population of Polynesians, estimated at 110,000 in the 18th century.

Polynesians have acquired a reputation as great navigators, with their canoes reaching the most remote corners of the Pacific and allowing the settlement of islands as far apart as Hawaii, Rapanui (Easter Island), and Aotearoa (New Zealand). The people of Polynesia accomplished this voyaging using ancient navigation skills, including reading stars, currents, clouds, and bird movements—skills that have been passed down through successive generations to the present day.

== Origins ==

Polynesians, including Samoans, Tongans, Niueans, Cook Islands Māori, Tahitian Mā&#x27;ohi, Hawaiian Māoli, Marquesans, and New Zealand Māori, are a subset of the Austronesian peoples. They share the same origins as the indigenous peoples of Taiwan, Maritime Southeast Asia, Micronesia, and Madagascar. This is supported by genetic, linguistic and archaeological evidence.
There are multiple hypotheses regarding the ultimate origin and mode of dispersal of the Austronesian peoples, but the most widely accepted theory is that modern Austronesians originated from migrations out of Taiwan between 3000 and 1000 BC. Using relatively advanced maritime innovations such as the catamaran, outrigger boats, and crab claw sails, they rapidly colonized the islands of both the Indian and Pacific oceans. They were the first humans to cross vast distances of water on ocean-going boats. Despite the popularity of rejected hypotheses, such as Thor Heyerdahl&#x27;s belief that Polynesians are descendants of &quot;bearded white men&quot; who sailed on primitive rafts from South America, Polynesians are believed to have originated from a branch of the Austronesian migrations in Island Melanesia. 

The direct ancestors of the Polynesians are believed to be the Neolithic Lapita culture. This group emerged in Island Melanesia and Micronesia around 1500 BC from a convergence of Austronesian migration waves, originating from both Island Southeast Asia to the west and an earlier Austronesian migration to Micronesia to the north. The culture was distinguished by dentate-stamped pottery. However, their eastward expansion halted when they reached the western Polynesian islands of Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga by around 900 BC. This remained the furthest extent of the Austronesian expansion in the Pacific for approximately 1,500 years, during which the Lapita culture in these islands abruptly lost the technology of pottery-making for unknown reasons. They resumed their eastward migrations around 700 AD, spreading to the Cook Islands, French Polynesia, and the Marquesas. From here, they expanded further to Hawaii by 900 AD, Easter Island by 1000 AD, and finally New Zealand by 1200 AD.
===Genetic studies===

Analysis by Kayser &quot;et al.&quot; (2008) found that only 21% of the Polynesian autosomal gene pool is of Australo-Melanesian origin, with the remaining 79% being of Austronesian origin. Another study by Friedlaender &quot;et al.&quot; (2008) also confirmed that some Polynesians are genetically closer to Micronesians, Taiwanese Aborigines, and Islander Southeast Asians. The study concluded that Polynesians moved through Melanesia fairly rapidly, allowing only limited admixture between Austronesians and Papuans. Polynesians predominantly belong to Haplogroup B (mtDNA), particularly to mtDNA B4a1a1 (the Polynesian motif). The high frequencies of mtDNA B4 in Polynesians are the result of genetic drift and represent the descendants of a few Austronesian females who mixed with Papuan males. The Polynesian population experienced a founder effect and genetic drift due to the small number of ancestors. As a result of the founder effect, Polynesians are distinctively different both genotypically and phenotypically from the parent population, due to the establishment of a new population by a very small number of individuals from a larger population, which also causes a loss of genetic variation.

Soares &quot;et al.&quot; (2008) argued for an older pre-Holocene Sundaland origin in Island Southeast Asia (ISEA) based on mitochondrial DNA. The &quot;out of Taiwan&quot; model was challenged by a study from Leeds University published in &quot;Molecular Biology and Evolution&quot;. Examination of mitochondrial DNA lineages indicates that they have been evolving in ISEA for longer than previously believed. Ancestors of the Polynesians arrived in the Bismarck Archipelago of Papua New Guinea at least 6,000 to 8,000 years ago.

A 2014 study by Lipson &quot;et al.,&quot; using whole genome data, supports the findings of Kayser &quot;et al.&quot; Modern Polynesians were shown to have lower levels of admixture with Australo-Melanesians than Austronesians in Island Melanesia. Nonetheless, both groups show admixture, along with other Austronesian populations outside of Taiwan, indicating varying degrees of intermarriage between the incoming Neolithic Austronesian settlers and the preexisting Paleolithic Australo-Melanesian populations of Island Southeast Asia and Melanesia.
Studies from 2016 and 2017 also support the idea that the earliest Lapita settlers mostly bypassed New Guinea, coming directly from Taiwan or the northern Philippines. The intermarriage and admixture with Australo-Melanesian Papuans evident in the genetics of modern Polynesians (as well as Islander Melanesians) occurred after the settlement of Tonga and Vanuatu.

A 2020 study found that Polynesians and the Indigenous peoples of South America came in contact around 1200, centuries before Europeans interacted with either group.

<text>Chichester ( ) is a cathedral city and civil parish in the Chichester district of West Sussex, England. It is the only city in West Sussex and is its county town. It was a Roman and Anglo-Saxon settlement and a major market town from those times through Norman and medieval times to the present day. It is the seat of the Church of England Diocese of Chichester and is home to a 12th-century cathedral.

The city has two main watercourses: the Chichester Canal and the River Lavant. The Lavant, a winterbourne, runs to the south of the city walls; it is hidden mostly in culverts when close to the city centre.

==History==

===Roman period===
There is no recorded evidence that Chichester was a settlement of any size before the coming of the Romans. The area around Chichester is believed to have played a significant part during the Roman invasion of AD 43, as confirmed by evidence of military storage structures in the area of the nearby Fishbourne Roman Palace. The city centre stands on the foundations of the Romano-British city of &quot;Noviomagus Reginorum&quot;, capital of the &quot;Civitas Reginorum&quot;.

The Roman road of Stane Street, connecting the city with London, started at the east gate, while the Chichester to Silchester road started from the north gate. The plan of the city is inherited from the Romans: the North, South, East and West shopping streets radiate from the central market cross dating from medieval times.

The original Roman city wall was over thick with a steep ditch (which was later used to divert the River Lavant). The lower parts of the existing city walls are Roman, but most of the above-ground work is later.

The city was also home to some Roman baths, found down Tower Street when preparation for a new car park was underway. A museum, The Novium, preserving the baths was opened on 8 July 2012.

An amphitheatre was built outside the city walls, close to the East Gate, in around 80 AD. The area is now a park, but the site of the amphitheatre is discernible as a gentle bank approximately oval in shape; a notice board in the park gives more information.

In January 2017, archaeologists using underground radar reported the discovery of the relatively untouched ground floor of a Roman townhouse and outbuilding. The exceptional preservation is due to the fact the site, Priory Park, belonged to a monastery and has never been built upon since Roman times.

===Anglo-Saxon period===
The legendary foundation of Anglo-Saxon Chichester is described by the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; that says that the area was annexed towards the close of the fifth century, by Ælle and his three sons. The city was supposedly renamed after his son, Cissa. It also says that it was the principal city of the Kingdom of Sussex. However, the foundation story is regarded as a myth by historians as there is no archaeological evidence that Chichester was reoccupied after the Romans left until the 9th century.

In the 9th century Alfred the Great set about building a system of fortified towns or forts, known as &quot;burhs&quot;, in response to the Viking threat. This included old Roman settlements where the walls could be rebuilt and strengthened. Chichester was one of these and was rebuilt probably between 878 and 879. The Burghal Hidage is an Anglo-Saxon document that provides a list of over thirty burhs, mainly in the ancient Kingdom of Wessex, and the taxes (recorded as numbers of hides) assigned for their maintenance. For each five hides the town was expected to provide one fully armed soldier in the king&#x27;s service, and one man from every hide was to be liable to do garrison duty for the burhs and to help in their initial construction and upkeep. Chichester was one of the larger burhs and was rated at 1500 hides.

The system was supported by a communication network based on hilltop beacons to provide early warning. It has been suggested that one such link ran from Chichester to London.

===Norman period===
Following the Norman Conquest in 1066, the cathedral that had been founded in 681 at Selsey was moved to Chichester after the Council of London of 1075 decreed that Sees should be centred in cities.

When the Domesday Book of 1086 was compiled, &quot;Cicestre&quot; in the Hundred of Stockbridge (comprising 102 households across the five areas outside the city) comprised 300 dwellings which held a population of 1,500 people, and had an annual value of 25 pounds. There was a mill named Kings Mill that would have been rented to local slaves and villeins. After the Battle of Hastings the township of Chichester was handed to Roger de Mongomerie, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, for courageous efforts in the battle, but it was forfeited in 1104 by the 3rd Earl. Shortly after 1066 Chichester Castle was built by Roger de Mongomerie to consolidate Norman power. In around 1143 the title Earl of Arundel (also known as the Earl of Sussex until that title fell out of use) was created and became the dominant local landowner. In 1216, Chichester Castle, along with Reigate Castle, was captured by the French, but regained the following year, when the castle was ordered to be destroyed by the king. Between 1250 and 1262, the Rape of Chichester was created from the western half of Arundel rape, with the castle as its administrative centre.

===Medieval to Victorian period===

In about 1400 Bishop Robert Reed erected a cross in the Market Place.

At Christmas 1642 during the First English Civil War, the city was besieged and St Pancras church was destroyed by gunfire.

A military presence was established in the city in 1795 with the construction of a depot on land where the Hawkhurst Gang had been hanged. It was named the Roussillon Barracks in 1958.

The military presence had mostly ceased by 2014 and the site was being developed for housing. with the former Guardroom known as The Keep playing host to a detachment of the Army Cadet Force.

At the beginning of the 19th-century, Chichester&#x27;s livestock market was recorded as the second largest in the country.

=== World War II to present ===
Chichester was bombed by the Luftwaffe during World War II, but fared relatively well compared to larger English cities. On 11 May 1944, a United States Army Air Forces Consolidated B-24 Liberator crashed in the city, killing three, injuring 38, and damaging hundreds of local buildings.

A new West Sussex county library was built in Tower Street in 1967, designed by county architect FR Steele. This was listed at Grade II in 2015.

In December 1993 and January 1994, Chichester was affected by the 1993–94 West Sussex floods.

On 21 November 2017, the Chichester District Council adopted a &#x27;Southern Gateway&#x27; plan to redevelop an area from the law courts to the canal basin, including the two railway level crossings.

==Governance==


=== Chichester City Council ===
Historically, Chichester was a city and liberty, thereby largely self-governing. Although it has retained its city status, in 1888 it became a municipal borough, transferring some powers to West Sussex administrative county. In 1974 the municipal borough became part of the much larger Chichester District. The City Council was retained but it only has the powers of a parish council; control of services is largely in the hands of Chichester District Council and West Sussex County Council.

The City Council meets in the Council House on North Street, which dates from 1731. Prior to this the City Council, and its predecessor the City Corporation, had met in Chichester Guildhall. In addition to its own council offices, those of the Chichester District and the West Sussex County Council are located in the city.

The City Council consists of eighteen elected members serving five wards of the city – North, South, East, West, and Central. Elections to the City Council last took place on Thursday 5 May 2023. The current makeup of the City Council is shown below - those marked * are also Chichester District Councillors.
=== Parliament ===
Chichester is represented in the House of Commons by the Chichester constituency, held since the 2024 General Election by Jess Brown-Fuller. From 1660 to 1868, Chichester returned two members of Parliament, this was reduced to one member by the Reform Act 1867. The Conservative Party is dominant, with the constituency returning a Conservative member at every election since 1868, with the exception of the Liberal Charles Rudkin in 1923. Between 1812 and 1894 the constituency was represented exclusively by members of the Lennox family.

==Geography==

The City of Chichester is located on the River Lavant south of its gap through the South Downs. This winterbourne for part of its course now runs through the city in underground culverts. The city&#x27;s site made it an ideal place for settlement, with many ancient routeways converging here. The oldest section lies within the medieval walls of the city, which are built on Roman foundations.

The Chichester conservation area, designated for its architectural and historic interest, encompasses the whole of the Roman town, and includes many Grade I and II listed buildings. Further to the north lies the separate conservation area around the former Graylingwell Hospital, and to the south, the Chichester Conservation Area has been extended recently to include the newly restored canal basin and part of Chichester Canal itself. The Conservation Area has been split into eight &#x27;character&#x27; areas, based on historic development, building type, uses and activities.

===Climate===
Chichester has a maritime climate. With its position in southern England, Chichester has mild winters and cool summers. West Sussex has high sunshine levels compared with other parts of the UK with around 1,900 hours annually.

== Demography ==
The 2011 census recorded a population of 26,795 for the city of Chichester, forming 12,316 households. The 2021 census recorded an increase in population to 29,407, forming 13,263 households. There is a small imbalance in the sex ratio, with 15,701, female residents (53.3%) and 13,706 male residents (46.7%). 26,622 residents (91%) listed their ethnic group as white.

Chichester has one of the highest rates of empty homes in England, with 1 in every 17 houses vacant. In October 2020, 3,444 houses were vacant, of which 3,302 were second homes.

==Economy==

The city has a tourist industry. Several marinas are situated in the area together with related industries. A recent government study suggested that the area has a lot of employment with the public sector (as well as within the tourism and leisure industries), with a growing number of self-employed people in the area.

==Culture==
The city holds an annual four-week arts and music festival (&quot;Festival of Chichester&quot;) held in June and July.

Chichester Cathedral has a year-round programme of music, talks and other events, including free lunchtime concerts of classical music.

Chichester Festival Theatre, is one of the United Kingdom&#x27;s flagship producing and touring theatres, whose annual summer season attracts actors, writers and directors from the West End theatre and the USA.

Pallant House Gallery, winner of the 2007 gallery of the year Gulbenkian Prize, has a major collection of chiefly modern British art and in 2006 opened a new extension that houses the collection of Sir Colin St John Wilson. It has a changing programme of exhibitions.

The Sloe Fair, a funfair that dates back to the 12th Century, is held annually on 20 October in the city&#x27;s Northgate car park.

Chichester Cinema at New Park is the city&#x27;s first and only arthouse cinema. It shows a selection of mainstream, small-budget and older films 7 days a week. It hosts an annual 18-day International Film Festival in August/September. Vice-presidents are Maggie Smith and Kenneth Branagh. There is a larger, multiplex cinema located at Chichester Gate. Chichester&#x27;s previous cinemas were the Olympia Electric on Northgate (1911–1922), the Plaza Cinema on South Street (1920–1960, the Odeon from 1945 and now Iceland supermarket), the Granada Exchange at the Corn Exchange (1922–1980) and the Gaumont on Eastgate Square (1937–1961, later the swimming baths).

The Chichester Open Mic has supported regular programmes of readings by contemporary poets in the city since 2010. It also hosts a high-profile annual event under the banner Poetry and All That Jazz which included performances by Don Paterson in 2010, Sam Willetts in 2011, and David Harsent in 2012.

In 2012 The Novium, Chichester&#x27;s museum, was opened by author Kate Mosse. Designed by the architect Keith Williams, is approximately 2.4 times the size of the previous museum in Little London. Key highlights are Roman Bath House, Jupiter Stone and Chilgrove Mosaic.

In May 2013 Chichester hosted the Chichester Street Art Festival week where international street artists created colourful murals around the city.

Chichester is mentioned in a 1992 episode of &quot;A Bit of Fry and Laurie&quot;, the 2003 film &quot;Bright Young Things&quot; directed by Stephen Fry, the 2005 film &quot;Stoned&quot; about Brian Jones from the Rolling Stones, and also in the 2009 film &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;.

The West Sussex Record Office is in Orchard Street and contains the county archives. On 21 April 2017 it was announced that a second parchment manuscript copy of the United States Declaration of Independence, now termed &quot;The Sussex Declaration&quot;, had been discovered in the archives.

Chichester has one of the highest rates of empty homes in England, with 1 in every 17 houses vacant. In October 2020, 3,444 houses were vacant, of which 3,302 were second homes.

===Music===
Founded in 1881, the Chichester Symphony Orchestra has both amateur and professional players. Three concerts are given each year with the summer concert being part of the Chichester Festivities while the autumn concert is included in the Chichester Cathedral Lunchtime Series. The Chichester Singers, under musical director Jonathan Willcocks, perform classical and contemporary works in concert.

The &quot;Chichester RAJF&quot; (From &quot;Real Ale and Jazz Festival&quot;), was a four-day festival of music and real ale held each July in tents beside the 13th century Guildhall in Priory Park.

==Local media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC South and ITV Meridian. Television signals are received from the Rowridge TV transmitter.

Chichester&#x27;s local radio stations are BBC Radio Sussex on 104.8 FM, Heart South on 96.7 FM, Greatest Hits Radio West Sussex on 96.6 FM and community based radio stations V2 Radio which broadcast online and Chichester Hospital Radio that broadcast on 1431 AM from the St Richard&#x27;s Hospital in the town.

==Landmarks==
Chichester Cross, which is a type of buttercross familiar in old market towns, was built in 1501 as a covered marketplace, and stands at the intersection of the four main roads in the centre of the city.

Chichester Cathedral, formally known as the Cathedral Church of the Holy Trinity, is the seat of the Anglican Bishop of Chichester. It is a Grade I listed building from 1075.

The Butter Market in North Street was designed by John Nash, and was opened in 1808 as a food and produce market.

The Corn Exchange on East Street was built in 1833, one of the first in the country. From the 1880s it was used for drama and entertainment and became a cinema from the 1910s. An attempt to convert it to a bingo hall was refused in 1977. As it could not be converted to a multiplex it was closed on 9 August 1980. It remained closed and unused for six years until the front was opened as a fast food restaurant and the rear converted for offices. From 2005 the front has been used by a clothing retailer.

In 1921, Sir William Robertson unveiled a war memorial in Eastgate Square for soldiers who died in World War I. The memorial was relocated to Litten Gardens in 1940. The city council subsequently added the names of soldiers who died in World War II.

==Transport==

===Railway===
Chichester railway station, on the West Coastway line, has regular services to Brighton, London Victoria via Gatwick Airport, Portsmouth and Southampton.

In the past, there was a branch line to Midhurst in the north and a light railway, built by Colonel H. F. Stephens; it was known as the West Sussex Railway, which ran south to Selsey, and closed in 1935.

===Roads===
Chichester is the hub of several main roads. The most important of these is the A27 coastal trunk road, which connects Eastbourne with Southampton; it passes to the south of the city. The A27 connects Chichester to the M3, M27 and M275 motorways. The secondary coastal road, the A259, which begins its journey at Folkestone in Kent, joins the A27 here and ends in Havant to the west. Both of those roads make east–west connections.

Three roads give Chichester access to the north: the A29 to London joins the A27 several miles to the east of the city; the A285 runs north-east to Petworth and beyond; and the A286 runs northwards towards Haslemere, Surrey.

===Buses===
Chichester bus station, which is adjacent to the railway station, is the local hub for bus services. Operators include Stagecoach in the South Downs and Compass Travel.

===Air===
Chichester/Goodwood Airport is situated north of the city.

===Paths===
There are several long-distance routes for walkers, cyclists and riders in the area; some of these routes, like the &quot;Centurion Way&quot; to West Dean, start here. Centurion Way was opened in the mid-1990s and runs along the former railway line. The name was chosen by Ben Adams, a local schoolboy who won a competition to name the path.

In summer 2020, COVID-19 temporary pop-up segregated cycle lanes were implemented predominately around parts of the city inner ring road and associated routes.

==Education==

There are three secondary schools in Chichester: Chichester Free School (which also has a primary sector in Bognor Regis), Bishop Luffa School and Chichester High School formed after the Chichester High School for Boys and Chichester High School for Girls merged in 2016. In the primary sector there are two infant-only schools: Lancastrian and Rumboldswyke; the Central C of E Junior School; six all-level schools; and two special-needs schools at Fordwater and St Anthony&#x27;s.

In the independent sector there are three-day preparatory schools (Oakwood Preparatory School, The Prebendal School and Westbourne House School).

The higher and further educational institutions include the Chichester High School Sixth Form. It offers a range of A-Level and vocational courses. Bishop Luffa School sixth form also offers a range of A-Level courses and Chichester College, formerly Chichester College of Arts, Science and Technology; offers both foundation-level and degree-equivalent courses, mainly focused towards vocational qualifications for industry.

The University of Chichester was granted degree-awarding body status by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority in October 2005.

==Religion==

Chichester Cathedral, founded in the 11th century, is dedicated to the Holy Trinity, and contains a shrine to Saint Richard of Chichester. Its spire, built of the weak local stone, collapsed and was rebuilt during the 19th century. In the south aisle of the cathedral a glass panel in the floor enables a view of the remains of a Roman mosaic pavement. The cathedral is unusual in Britain in having a separate bell tower a few metres away from the main building, rather than integrated into it. Within the cathedral there is a medieval tomb of a knight and his wife, the inspiration of the poem &quot;An Arundel Tomb&quot;, by Philip Larkin. A memorial statue exists of William Huskisson, once member of parliament for the city, but best remembered as the first man to be run over by a railway engine. Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;Chichester Psalms&quot; were commissioned for the cathedral.

In addition to the cathedral there are five Church of England churches, St Richard&#x27;s Roman Catholic church and nine religious buildings of other denominations. Redundant churches include the Grade I-listed St John the Evangelist&#x27;s Church, an octagonal white-brick proprietary chapel with an impressive three-decker pulpit.

St Mary&#x27;s Hospital Almshouses are a 13th-century religious foundation located at St Martin&#x27;s Square, providing housing and care for elderly people from the Chichester diocese.

<text>Deptford Bridge is a Docklands Light Railway (DLR) station in Deptford, London in England. The station is elevated above both local roads and Deptford Creek, and is adjacent to Lewisham College and Deptford market.

== Location ==
The station is located between Greenwich and Elverson Road stations, and is on the boundary of Travelcard Zone 2 and 3. It is sited in the Royal Borough of Greenwich and is very close to the boundary with the London Borough of Lewisham.

The station layout consists of two elevated side platforms which run roughly north–south over the A2 road and parallel to the River Ravensbourne. The station was proposed in 1989 further north as &#x27;Deptford Creek&#x27; before an island platform in its current location was proposed in 1990 with lift access on both sides of the A2 - the design was changed to the current layout before construction, with lifts only on the south side. 

The station was opened in 1999 as part of the southern extension from Island Gardens to Lewisham.

The station was largely reconstructed and considerably enhanced when it was extended to enable 3-car trains to call at it.

==Services==

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour from Deptford Bridge is:
* 12 tph to Bank
* 12 tph to 

Additional services call at the station during the peak hours, increasing the service to up to 22 tph in each direction, with up to 8 tph during the peak hours running to and from instead of Bank.


==Connections==
London Buses routes 47, 53, 177, 453 and night route N89 serve the station.

<text>Knaresborough ( ) is a market and spa town and civil parish on the River Nidd in North Yorkshire, England. It is east of Harrogate and was in the Borough of Harrogate until April 2023.

==History==

The Knaresborough Hoard, the largest hoard of Romano-British copper-alloy vessels discovered to date in Britain, dates to the 4th century and indicates wealthy Roman presence in the area.
It was probably discovered near Farnham near where two important Roman roads ran: Cade&#x27;s Road on the eastern side and Dere Street to the west, a major route to York and Hadrian&#x27;s Wall. There were a number of wealthy Roman villas in the area and the hoard may have come from one of these.

Knaresborough is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Chenaresburg&quot;, meaning &quot;Cenheard&#x27;s fortress&quot;, in the wapentake of Burghshire, renamed Claro Wapentake in the 12th century. Knaresborough Castle is Norman; around 1100, the town began to grow. It provided a market and attracted traders to service the castle. The parish church, St John&#x27;s, was established around this time. The earliest identified Lord of Knaresborough is around 1115 when Serlo de Burgh held the Honour of Knaresborough from the King.

Hugh de Morville was granted the Honour of Knaresborough in 1158. He was constable of Knaresborough and leader of the group of four knights who murdered Archbishop Thomas Becket at Canterbury Cathedral on 29 December 1170. The four knights fled to Knaresborough and hid at the castle. Hugh de Morville forfeited the lands in 1173, not for his implication in the murder of Thomas Becket, but for &quot;complicity in the rebellion of Henry the Young King&quot;, according to the Early Yorkshire Charters.

The Honour of Knaresborough then passed to the Stuteville family. When the Stuteville line was broken with the death of Robert the 4th (son of Robert 3rd) in 1205, King John effectively took the Honour of Knaresborough for himself. The first Maundy Money was distributed in Knaresborough by King John on 15 April 1210. Knaresborough Forest, which extended far to the south of the town, is reputed to have been one of King John&#x27;s favourite hunting grounds.

Although a market was first mentioned in 1206, the town was not granted a Royal Charter to hold a market until 1310, by Edward II. A market is still held every Wednesday in the market square. In Edward II&#x27;s reign, the castle was occupied by rebels and the curtain walls were breached by a siege engine. Later, Scots invaders burned much of the town and the parish church. In 1328, as part of the marriage settlement, Queen Philippa was granted &quot;the Castle, Town, Forest and Honour of Knaresborough&quot; by Edward III and the parish church was restored. After her death in 1369, the Honour was granted by Edward to their younger son, John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster and since then the castle has belonged to the Duchy of Lancaster. After the accession of Henry IV the castle lost much of its importance in national affairs, but remained a key site in regional administration for another century.

In the English Civil War, following the Battle of Marston Moor in 1644, the castle was besieged by Parliamentary forces. The castle eventually fell and in 1646 an order was made by Parliament for its destruction (but not carried out till 1648). The destruction was mainly done by citizens looting the stone. Many town centre buildings are built of castle stone.

The railway age began in Knaresborough in 1848 with the opening of a railway station on Hay Park Lane; this was replaced with the current one three years later in 1851. The town had a railway line to Boroughbridge until it closed to passengers in 1950; it was dismantled in 1964.

Historically in the West Riding of Yorkshire, Knaresborough became part of North Yorkshire in 1974.

==Culture and community==

Knaresborough House on the town&#x27;s High Street houses Knaresborough Town Council and the Yorkshire Federation of Young Farmers&#x27; Clubs.

Knaresborough hosts an annual Bed Race, organised by the Knaresborough Lions Club. It is held on the second Saturday of June and was first held in 1966.

An annual, town centre arts summer festival, the Festival of Entertainment and Visual Arts, has been staged since 2001.

Since May 2019, a parkrun takes place every Saturday at Conyngham Hall.

Knaresbrough appeared in the first episode, opening election sequence of the ITV comedy series &quot;The New Statesman&quot;. Other exterior shots for the series were also filmed around the town. Knaresbrough was a principal location for the 2019 American television film &quot;A Very British Christmas&quot;.

The Frazer Theatre is close to Knaresbrough&#x27;s High Street.

==Landmarks==
Sights in the town include the remains of Knaresborough Castle, the Courthouse Museum in the castle grounds, Mother Shipton&#x27;s Cave, the House in the Rock, St Robert&#x27;s Cave (dating from the Middle Ages), and the railway viaduct over the River Nidd.

The House in the Rock, also known as Fort Montague, is a local Knaresborough curiosity. In the early 19th century, a strange child appeared in the Hill family. This child had abnormal very blonde woolly hair resembling the fleece of a sheep and was known as the Woolly-Headed Boy of Fort Montague. He conducted visitors around the house and was a great curiosity himself.

The Chapel of Our Lady of the Crag on Abbey Road is a Grade I listed shrine dedicated to the Virgin Mary. It was built in 1408 by John the Mason after his son, who was presumed dead in a rockfall in a local quarry, was found alive, with the son&#x27;s escape having been attributed to the mason&#x27;s frequent prayers to Mary.

Knaresborough is the site of the oldest chemist shop in England, opened in 1720.

The principal areas of public open space are the Knaresborough Castle grounds, Horseshoe Field, the King George V Playing Field and Jacob Smith Park, a parkland on the edge of the town, bequeathed to Knaresborough by Miss Winifred Jacob Smith in 2003. Wildlife is protected in the former flooded quarry, Hay-a-Park Gravel Pit.

Conyngham Hall is close to the town centre. Until the 1980s there was a small zoo in the grounds.

Near to the castle are Bebra Gardens, formerly the Moat Gardens, renamed after Knaresborough&#x27;s twin town in Germany.

The Commercial (formerly Borough Bailiff) public house, owned by the Samuel Smith Old Brewery, was the oldest pub in Knaresborough until it closed.

==Governance==
In the UK parliament the town is in the Harrogate and Knaresborough constituency. This is further divided for council purposes, the town spans four wards, &quot;Knaresborough, Aspin and Calcutt&quot;, &quot;Knaresborough Castle&quot; &quot;Knaresborough Eastfield&quot; and &quot;Knaresborough Scriven Park&quot;. 

From 1974 to 2023 Knaresborough was administered as part of a two tier council system by Harrogate Borough Council, one of the seven district councils in North Yorkshire. The borough council was a non-metropolitan district, responsible for housing, planning, leisure and recreation, waste collection, environmental health and revenue collection. Above the Borough council was North Yorkshire County Council, which was a non-metropolitan county providing education, transport, highways, fire, waste disposal, social and library services. 

In April 2023 both councils were replaced by North Yorkshire Council along with all district councils in North Yorkshire. The unitary authority now provides all the services previously provided separately by the two councils.

At the lowest level of governance Knaresborough has a town council which, for election and administrative purposes.

==Religion==

The town has two Church of England churches, a Roman Catholic church, St. Mary&#x27;s, and Methodist and United Reformed churches.

Knaresborough Primitive Methodist Chapel on High Street was built in the 1850s. The date of closure is not known; a plaque on the building states that it was built in 1851 but there is some debate about this. The chapel premises were used by a coat manufacturer for a good part of the 20th century. In 2001 the premises were converted into four flats. 

Ecumenical services take place at Our Lady of the Crag Shrine (1408).
A plaque in Market Place, placed by the Knaresborough Civic Society, commemorates the 13th century Synagogue to the rear of the Market Place. The plaque indicates that in the 13th century a Jewish community lived and worshipped in Knaresborough. The synagogue was situated at the exit to Synagogue Lane, the exact location of which is unknown. It is believed the Knaresborough Jewish community was dissolved in 1275, before people of the Jewish faith were expelled from England in 1290 on the orders of Edward 1.
