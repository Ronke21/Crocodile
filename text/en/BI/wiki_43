<text>Inagh ( ; ) is a village and civil parish in County Clare, Ireland. It is situated 14 km west of Ennis on the Inagh River. It contains the villages of Inagh and Cloonanaha.

==Location==
The parish is part of the barony of Inchiquin.
The &quot;Parliamentary Gazetteer of Ireland, 1845&quot; describes Inach (then including Kilnamona) as:
==Village==

The village is clustered around seven of the parish&#x27;s townlands that lie north-east of Mount Callan. 
It was once called &quot;Breintir Fearmacach agus Cormacach&quot;, meaning &quot;fetid district of Cinel Fearmaic and Cormaic&quot;. 
It was later called Breintre, then Inagh.
The village is situated on the N85, Ennis - Ennistymon / Lahinch road, making Inagh a tourist route serving north and west Clare.

There are a number of community and sports groups in Inagh including a youth club, angling, walking, golfing, and reading clubs. Hurling and camogie are played at Inagh-Kilnamona GAA. Inagh has had a strong tradition of Irish music and dancing. Inagh is also home to the organic goat cheese farm of St Tola.

==Catholic Parish==
The Catholic parish of Inagh and Kilnamona has its parish office in the village of Inagh.

The first church of &quot;Eidnach&quot; was said to have been built by Mac Creiche in his old age, around 580.
Fragments of the &quot;Teampul na glas aighne&quot; remained in 1839, but were later demolished.
The church at Inagh, called in Irish &quot;Teampul-duv-na-h’Eidhnighe&quot;, does not seem to have had a patron saint. The present church is dedicated to the &quot;Immaculate Conception&quot;.

==Ruins==
As of 1893 there was only one castle in the parish, Bothneil, which was very dilapidated. 
In 1580 the castle was the property of Teige, son of Murrough O&#x27;Brien.
Near the castle is a stone named &quot;cloch-an-agraid&quot;, bearing an inscription in Ogham characters.
According to Professor O&#x27;Looney of the Catholic University, who examined it in 1844 and 1859, the inscription reads: &quot;FAN LIA DO LICA CONAF (N) COLGAC COSOBADA (C)&quot;, meaning &quot;Under this stone is laid Conaf (n) the fierce [and] turbulent.&quot; 
Nearby there was a cromlech named &quot;altoir-na-Gretne&quot; (altar of the sun), where the local people once met on certain days each year.

==Townlands==
The civil parish consists of the following townlands: Ballyduff Beg, Ballyduff More, Ballyea North, Ballyea South, Ballynoe, Bauntlieve, Boolavaun, Boolinrudda, Boolyduff, Boolynamiscaun, Carrowkeel East, Carrowkeel West, Cloonanaha, Cloonmackan, Cloontysmarra, Coolshingaun, Curraghodea, Derry, Derryharriv, Drumanure, Drumcarna, Drumcullaun, Drumduff, Drumlesh, Drumnagah, Formoyle Eighteragh East, Formoyle Eighteragh West, Formoyle Oughteragh East, Formoyle Oughteragh West, Garvillaun, Garvoghil, Glennageer, Gortalougha, Gortbofarna, Knockalassa, Knockogonnell, Kylea, Letterkelly, Maghera, Magherabaun, Meelick, Muckinish, Sileshaun West, Sileshaun East and Skaghvickincrow.

<text>There are a number of communist parties active in various countries across the world and a number that used to be active. They differ not only in method, but also in strict ideology and interpretation, although they are generally within the tradition of Marxism–Leninism.

The formation of communist parties in various countries was first initiated by the Russian Bolsheviks within the Communist International. Since then, communist parties have governed numerous countries, whether as ruling parties in one-party states like the Chinese Communist Party or the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, or as ruling parties in multi-party systems, including majority and minority governments as well as leading or being part of several coalitions.

Many other communist parties did not govern any country, but did govern a state or region within a country. Others have also been represented in national, state, or regional parliaments. Some communist parties and schools of thought reject parliamentarism, instead advocating insurrection or social revolution as well as workers&#x27; councils.

<text>Mode X is a 256-color graphics display mode of the VGA graphics hardware for IBM PC compatibles. It was first publicized by Michael Abrash in his July 1991 column in &quot;Dr. Dobb&#x27;s Journal&quot; and then in chapters 47-49 of Abrash&#x27;s &quot;Graphics Programming Black Book&quot;. The term &quot;Mode X&quot; was coined by Abrash. Mode X is a variant of the Mode 13h with the resolution increased to , giving square pixels instead of the slightly elongated pixels of Mode 13h. It is enabled by entering Mode 13h via an BIOS system call, then changing the values of several VGA registers.

Additionally, Abrash enabled the VGA&#x27;s planar memory mode (also called &quot;unchained mode&quot;). Even though planar memory mode is a documented part of the VGA standard and was used in earlier commercial games, it was first widely publicized in the Mode X articles, leading many programmers to consider Mode X and planar memory synonymous. It is possible to enable planar memory in standard mode, which became known as Mode Y in the Usenet rec.games.programmer group.

Planar memory arrangement splits the pixels horizontally into groups of four. For any given byte in video memory, four pixels on screen can be accessed depending on which plane(s) are enabled. This is more complicated for the programmer, but the advantages gained by this arrangement—primarily the ability to use all 256 KB of VGA memory for one or more display buffers, instead of only one quarter of that (64 KB)—were considered worthwhile by many.

==Variants==
In addition to unchained being called Mode Y, Mode Q (short for &quot;cube&quot;) is sometimes used to refer to a 256-color mode. The Y coordinate can simply be put in the high byte of the address, and the X coordinate in the low byte, forming the address of the pixel without a multiply.

<text>Michael Breckenridge Eisner (born April 26, 1970) is an American television and film director.

== Early life ==
Eisner was born in California, the son of Jane Breckenridge, a business advisor and computer programmer, and Michael Eisner, the former Walt Disney Company chief executive. To avoid confusion with his father, he uses a short version of his middle name/mother&#x27;s maiden name as his professional first name. His mother is a Unitarian of Scottish and Swedish descent while his father is Jewish.

Eisner attended Harvard High School (now Harvard-Westlake School), Georgetown University, majoring in both English and Theatre, and the University of Southern California&#x27;s film school where he received a master&#x27;s degree in film production.

== Career ==
For a directing project at Georgetown, he filmed a contemporary riff on &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, shooting scenes in the vast empty attic of Healy Hall on the campus, as well as in an abandoned circular trolley-car tunnel under Dupont Circle in Northwest, Washington, D.C. He also directed Shakespeare plays on the campus.

His MFA thesis film, &quot;Recon&quot;, a tech noir co-written and co-produced by Steven Cantor, stars Peter Gabriel, Elizabeth Peña and Charles Durning. Set in Los Angeles in 2007, Gabriel plays a weary detective who in order to catch a serial killer uses a new experimental technology, Recon, which allows him to see the last living minutes of the killer&#x27;s victims through their eyes. Gabriel agreed to appear in the film after having been asked to by Cantor who had served with him on a media advisory board. Peña came on board because she wanted to work with Gabriel while Durning had the same agent as Peña. The film, made for a budget of $21,000, was shot in 1994 but completion took until 1996. It screened at the 53rd Venice International Film Festival, the Edinburgh International Film Festival and the Hamptons International Film Festival, among others.

Eisner had used some of Digital Domain&#x27;s processors to render images for his film, and the company suggested he meet with some commercial production houses. Thus began his career as a director of commercials, and after only a year-and-a-half, Eisner had directed 14 high-profile spots. His first commercial was Budweiser&#x27;s Powersurge, which aired during the 1997 Super Bowl. He also took the helm for Rold Gold pretzels&#x27; &quot;Comrades&quot; starring Jason Alexander, which featured Pretzel Boy on a rescue mission to the &quot;Mir&quot; space station. Eisner&#x27;s two anti-smoking spots for the California Department of Health Services, &quot;Gala Event&quot; and &quot;Funeral&quot;, were selected as Best Spots in back-to-back issues of &quot;Adweek&quot;. In addition, Eisner&#x27;s &quot;Mad Dog&quot; for Coors&#x27;s Zima aired during the &quot;Seinfeld&quot; finale and was chosen by &quot;USA Today&quot; &quot;Ad Meter&quot; as the #1 spot. He has also done commercials for Sony, Sega and Coca-Cola.

Eisner&#x27;s success in the commercial world opened the door for him to direct the TV film &quot;The Invisible Man&quot; for the Sci Fi Channel. That led to an episode of DreamWorks Television&#x27;s mini-series &quot;Taken&quot; (2002), executive-produced by Steven Spielberg and starring Dakota Fanning.

His first full-length effort was the crime drama &quot;Thoughtcrimes&quot; (2003), which was produced as a backdoor pilot and went straight to video. His theatrical directorial debut was the film &quot;Sahara&quot; (2005) starring Matthew McConaughey, Penélope Cruz and William H. Macy. The film is considered one of the biggest financial failures in Hollywood history.

Eisner currently works as a director of film and television. In October 2005, it was announced that Eisner would direct a remake of the classic monster film &quot;Creature from the Black Lagoon&quot; which was dropped in 2009 for unnamed reasons, and in February 2008, it was announced that he would direct &quot;The Crazies&quot;, a remake of the film of the same name, released in 2010. In December 2009, it was announced he will direct the remakes of &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; and &quot;The Brood&quot;, though he later backed out of the latter. He is rumored to direct the remake of &quot;Escape from New York&quot;. Eisner is set to direct the film adaptation of the Mark Wheatley comic book &quot;Blood of the Innocent&quot;. In December 2010, he was in talks to direct the film adaption of the Hasbro board game Ouija.

On March 5, 2013, Eisner was set to direct action fantasy film &quot;The Last Witch Hunter&quot; by Summit Entertainment based on Cory Goodman&#x27;s script, Melisa Wallack would re-write the script. Vin Diesel stars as lead with Rose Leslie, Julie Engelbrecht, Michael Caine, Elijah Wood and Ólafur Darri Ólafsson.

In April 2014, Sony Pictures Classics announced that Eisner would direct &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; sequel starring Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan. In June 2014, Eisner left the project because of scheduling conflicts with &quot;The Last Witch Hunter&quot;, released in 2015.

In November 2024, it was announced that a production company &quot;Expanding Universe&quot; co-founded by Eisner with Naren Shankar, Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck has a development deal with Amazon MGM Studios, with their first project, television adaptation of &quot;The Captive&#x27;s War&quot; trilogy, being directed and co-executive produced by Eisner.

== Personal life ==
In 2006, he married Georgia Leigh Irwin in a ceremony officiated by a Roman Catholic priest and held at her parents&#x27; house. Irwin&#x27;s father is a real estate broker in Palm Springs who developed and sold the resort La Mancha; and her maternal grandfather, Carroll Rosenbloom, was the owner of the Los Angeles Rams and the Baltimore Colts.

<text>Ennis ( , meaning &#x27;island&#x27; or &#x27;river meadow&#x27;) is the county town of County Clare, in the mid-west of Ireland. The town lies on the River Fergus, north of where the river widens and enters the Shannon Estuary. Ennis is the largest town in County Clare, with a population of 27,923, making it the 6th largest town, and 11th largest urban settlement, as of the 2022 census. Dating from the 12th century the town&#x27;s Irish name is short for , deriving from its location between two courses of the River Fergus.

Ennis has had considerable success in the Irish Tidy Towns competition. In 2005 and 2021, the town was named Ireland&#x27;s tidiest town, and was named Ireland&#x27;s tidiest large urban centre on multiple occasions.

The town straddles two baronies. Most of the town, including its historic centre, is in the Barony of Islands. However, the eastern and north-eastern edges of the town are in the Barony of Bunratty Upper.

==History==


The name Ennis derives from the Irish word &quot;Inis&quot;, meaning &quot;island&quot;. This name relates to an island called &#x27; (&quot;Calf Island&quot;) or &#x27; (&quot;island of the long rowing meadow&quot;) formed between two courses of the River Fergus. The history of Ennis is closely linked with the O&#x27;Brien dynasty, descendants of Brian Boru. In the 12th century, the O&#x27;Briens, the Kings of Thomond, left their seat of power in Limerick and built a Clonroad Fort in 1210, a royal residence on the banks of the Fergus. In 1240, following the arrival of Franciscan monks, King Donnchadh O&#x27;Brien ordered the construction of an extensive church which he later donated to the Friars. The Friary quickly expanded becoming a centre for theological studies, and by 1375 had 600 students and 350 Friars in residence. As the Friary expanded, so too did the surrounding area, with the town becoming a religious centre until the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Despite its official closure in 1540, the Friary continued to operate in a limited way until 1690, remaining the last school of Catholic Theology to survive the Reformation.

When Clare became a county under the rule of Elizabeth I in 1586, Ennis was chosen as its administrative centre and capital because of its central location and its association with the Earls of Thomond. Ennis received a grant to hold fairs and markets in 1610 and later a Charter for a Corporation with a Provost, Free Burgesses, Commonalty and a Town Clerk.

In the colonial period, a number of landmark structures were constructed, including the Mill and Courthouse. The town contains a number of old military barracks, most notably the Old Military Barracks on the Kilrush road. Many locals served in the British Army in the First World War. The Clare Road and Clonroad areas contain terraced cottages built in the early 20th century to house soldiers. On Station Road, then called Jail Road, a gaol once stood.

As its formation was monastic and not defensive, Ennis never had town walls and instead grew as place of commerce and trade. Over the centuries the market town slowly expanded, and eventually developed as a small manufacturing and distribution centre with commodities moved by river to the port at Clarecastle for shipping abroad. Local industries included textile and clothing manufacturing, the milling of corn and flour, as well as brewing of beer and distillation of whiskey with evidence of these industries still present in the town. The 1845 Famine and its aftermath had a substantial effect on the town with the population declining by over 20% because of famine, disease and emigration.

Ennis was governed by a corporation from the early 17th century. It was a parliamentary borough to the Irish House of Commons until 1801, and was given continued representation at Westminster from 1801 to 1885. The borough corporation was dissolved by the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840. It was later granted town commissioners under the Towns Improvement (Ireland) Act 1854, which was converted to an urban district under the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898, and a town council under the Local Government Act 2001. The Local Government Reform Act 2014 dissolved the town council with the creation of Ennis Municipal District under the authority of Clare County Council. Ennis Town Hall is now used as a banqueting suite for the Old Ground Hotel.

Politically, Ennis was long a Fianna Fáil stronghold. However, in the 2009 local elections, the party was reduced to just one member out of nine on Ennis Town Council. A monument to Éamon de Valera, founder of the party and former President of Ireland, stands outside Ennis Courthouse.

The River Fergus runs through the middle of Ennis and is a well-known trout and salmon fishery. At one time, small sailing boats made their way up river from the Shannon and berthed in the centre of the town at Woodquay. This area of the town along with Parnell Street and Mill Road was routinely susceptible to flooding, but the flood defence system put an end to the event in Parnell Street and the Mill Road areas, although in November 2009 other parts of the town experienced severe flooding. A new pedestrian bridge, Harmony Row Bridge, was built over the river Fergus in June 2009.

==Heritage and economy==
Ennis continued to expand in the following centuries, mainly as a market town and later as a manufacturing and distributing centre. Many commodities were conveyed by river to Clarecastle for shipment abroad.

Ennis is a historically important market town. The market square is still home to market stalls on each Saturday throughout the year, although with the rise in the town&#x27;s commercial retail sector it has shifted from agricultural produce to mainly textiles and home hardware. The market also has an organic farming element.

The town centre consists of medieval narrow streets and laneways, overshadowed by structures built over the last thousand years. Of the main thoroughfares, Parnell Street has been pedestrianised, while the others, O&#x27;Connell Street, Bindon Street and Abbey Street, are one way. The Cathedral of Saint Peter and Saint Paul is on the fringe of the old town centre.

Ennis serves as a major regional hub for County Clare. Among its emergency services, it contains the Ennis Hospital, the HQ of the Clare Divisional Garda, the Clare Fire Brigade and Civil Defence. Ennis also includes many relief organisations, such as The Samaritans, Clare Care and St. Vincent De Paul. Among its civil services, it contains Clare County Council, as well as Social and Family affairs.

Ennis has been a centre for Irish Traditional Music, and since 1974 has hosted the &quot;Fleadh Nua&quot; in late May each year, the second-largest traditional music festival in Ireland. There are other traditional festivals held in the town as well such as the Ennis Trad Festival held annually in November.

==Transport==
Situated 14  km from Shannon Airport, Ennis is served by both bus and rail links to all major cities and towns in Ireland. The main bus depot is adjacent to the town&#x27;s train station and both are about one kilometre from the town centre. Ennis railway station is on the Clon Road toward the east of the town, which links to the main N18 in either direction.

Bus services are provided to Shannon Airport, Galway, Limerick, Cork, Dublin and all routes in between and run nearly every hour. Shannon Airport is 15 minutes from Ennis, providing daily flights to European and US destinations.

The M18 motorway was extended from Ennis to Limerick in 2007. The section from Ennis to Gort was opened in 2010.

Ennis was formerly the starting point of the West Clare Railway, a narrow-gauge railway which ran from Ennis to Ennistymon, Milltown Malbay and onwards to the towns and villages along the West Clare coastline. Trains ran from the same railway station which is still used by mainline Irish railway services. The line was CIÉ&#x27;s last narrow-gauge railway and finally closed in 1961, despite investment in new diesel trains in the early/mid-1950s.

Ennis railway station connects with Galway and with Limerick where onward trains run to Dublin, Cork via Limerick Junction (for connections to Tipperary, Cahir, Clonmel, Carrick-on-Suir and Waterford) and Mallow (for connections to Killarney and Tralee). Ennis is also served by local charity Clare bus which provides a fully wheelchair-accessible bus service around the Clare area.

==Education==
Primary Schools in Ennis include Ennis National School, established in 1897 (formerly Boys National School), Cloughleigh National School, Gaelscoil Mhichíl Cíosóg, Holy Family School, Scoil Chroist Rí, CBS and the multi-denominational Ennis Educate Together National School which opened in 1998. There are several secondary level schools in Ennis, including Rice College, Ennis Community College, Coláiste Muire, St. Flannan&#x27;s College, and Gaelcholaiste an Chláir. Mid-West Management Training is a FETAC approved provider of further education and training up to Level 6 of the National Framework of Qualifications. The Ennis Business college is one of Ennis&#x27;s third-level facilities. Limerick IT opened its Ennis campus in 2019. The IT merged with Athlone IT to become Technological University of the Shannon: Midlands Midwest, in October 2021.

==Culture==
Ennis is a stronghold of traditional music with many musicians in residence and regularly playing locally.
The Ennis Book Club Festival, in association with Clare County Library, runs annually on the first weekend in March. It attracts readers and authors from all over Ireland and beyond. Glór Theatre is a concert and events venue in the town centre.

In 2016 and 2017 Ennis hosted the Fleadh Cheoil na hÉireann music competition. It is the first time that the town has hosted the event since 1977.

==Sports and leisure==
Cusack Park on Francis Street in the town centre is the main county Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) playing grounds and the home of Clare GAA. Ennis has numerous football clubs (soccer, GAA and rugby) that play in various leagues from schoolboys to senior.

The Lees Road Sports and Amenity Park, 1  km from the town centre, is set in of wood and parkland. Among the facilities available are four conventional playing pitches, full size all-weather floodlit playing pitch, a floodlit synthetic running track and a purpose-built cross country running track. There is a children&#x27;s playground and skateboard park and marked walks and trails throughout the woodland area. 
Ennis Leisure Centre has a fully equipped gym with a 25m pool, saunas etc. There are a number of hotels around Ennis that have their own leisure facilities including gyms and 15m to 20m pools.

Within the town, there are six adult soccer clubs (Avenue United, Lifford FC, Ennis Town, Turnpike Rovers, Hermitage FC and Ennis Dons FC), two adult GAA clubs (Éire Óg and The Banner GAA), and one rugby club (Ennis RFC).

==International relations==
Ennis is twinned with Phoenix, Arizona. Each summer an average of four 4th/5th year students partake in the Phoenix Youth Ambassador Program, which is facilitated by the city of Phoenix twinning committee and the Ennis Chamber of Commerce.

It is also twinned with the town of Saint-Paul-de-Fenouillet in southern France.
Ennis is also twinned with the town of Clare, South Australia and the city of Clare, Michigan, United States

==Information Age Town==
In September 1997, Ennis became Ireland&#x27;s first and only Information Age Town. The town was greatly enhanced by the project&#x27;s IR£15 million investment, which saw 4,200 computers provided to residents. A computer lab was provided for every school and every primary school classroom was provided with a computer. Elderly residents were given the chance to become computer users also as a result. The project also gave Ennis Ireland&#x27;s first high-speed ISDN line infrastructure, which connected all the town&#x27;s businesses together. Ennis was also used as a test site for VISA Cash, which allowed users to top up a Chip and PIN card with petty cash and purchase goods in local stores. Funding for the project ran out in 2000.

==Tidy Town==
In 2012, 2013 and 2021, Ennis won the Irish Tidy Towns Competition in the Large Urban Centre category.

<text>The 2004 Summer Paralympics (), the 12th Summer Paralympic Games, were a major international multi-sport event for athletes with disabilities governed by the International Paralympic Committee, held in Athens, Greece, from 17 to 28 September 2004. 3,808 athletes (2,643 Men and 1,165 Women) from 136 countries participated. During these games 304 World Records were broken with 448 Paralympic Games Records being broken across 19 different sports. 8,863 volunteers worked along the Organizing Committee.

Four new events were introduced to the Paralympics in Athens; 5-a-side football for the blind, quads wheelchair tennis, and women&#x27;s competitions in judo and sitting volleyball. Following a scandal at the 2000 Summer Paralympics, in which the Spanish intellectually-disabled basketball team was stripped of their gold medal after it was found that multiple players had not met the eligibility requirements, ID-class events were suspended.

It was also the last time that the old Paralympic symbol was used. The new Paralympic symbol was introduced in 2006.

==Host City Bid Process==
Athens was chosen as the host city during the 106th IOC Session held in Lausanne, Switzerland on 5 September 1997. The Greek capital had lost its bid to organize the 1996 Summer Olympics to the American city of Atlanta nearly seven years before, during the 96th IOC Session in Tokyo, Japan on 18 September 1990. Under the direction of Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, Athens pursued another bid, this time for the right to host the Summer Olympics in 2004. The success of Athens in securing the 2004 Games was based largely on the bid&#x27;s appeal to human values, the history of the Games from the ancient to modern periods and the emphasis that Athens is placed at the pivotal role that Greece and Athens could play in promoting the Modern Olympism and the Olympic Movement. Unlike the 1996 bid committee that was seen arrogant when the city was bidding, the 2004 bid was lauded for its low scale, humility, honest and earnestness, its focused message, and a more real e a detailed bid concept. Unlike, nine years before where concerns and criticisms are raised during the unsuccessful 1996 bid – primarily when was talked in critical subjects about the city&#x27;s infrastructural readiness, its air pollution, its budget and politicization of the Games events and their preparations. Along a successful organization of another events as the 1991 Mediterranean Games,the 1994 FIVB Volleyball Men&#x27;s World Championship,1994 World Fencing Championships and the successful 1997 World Championships in Athletics,one month before the Olympic host city election was crucial in allaying lingering fears and concerns among the sporting community and some IOC members about the Greek ability to host international sporting events. Another factor that contributed to the Greek capital&#x27;s selection was a growing sentiment among some IOC members to restore some original values of the Olympics to the Modern Games, a component which they felt was lost during the 1996 Summer Olympics.

== New rules applied to the Paralympics ==
This was the last edition of the Summer Paralympics in which cities could make the decision whether or not to host the Games. As they were still seen as an optional and second-tier event. International Olympic Committee (IOC) was motivated after the high number of problems concerning the 1996 Summer Paralympics held in Atlanta with a different organization started a strategic partnership with the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) and demanded from all 11 applicant cities their plans regarding the Paralympics for the first time. All the 11 bidding cities agreed to accept these requirements, but only three proposed different organizations.

==Torch relay==
The same torch design used for the Olympics was used for the Paralympic Games.The flame was lit in a ritual carried out at dusk on September 9, 2004, in the Temple of Hephaestus, at the foot of the Acropolis and resulted in the fire raised from a forge and a reenactment of one of the founding myths of the city of Athens.The first torchbearer was the swimmer Kostantinos Fykas who won 2 gold medals in Sydney, 4 years earlier and 1 silver in Atlanta.The relay took it throughout Athens metropolitan area,and its route wanted to contrast with that of the Olympic torch, by demonstrating the modern side of Greece,passing through 54 municipalities and covering a distance of 410 km.

680 torchbearers shared its light and the values of strength, pursuit and noble competition.The journey begun from the heart of Athens, in Thiseio.
After the forge ceremony, the Paralympic Torch sleeped at Odeon of Herodes Atticus.The route also take steps on the Temple of Poseidon, Sounion and Brauron,and the great centers of the classical age,Megara and Elefsina, with their remarkable archaeological museums, all welcomed the Paralympic flame which also shone its light on the magnificent coastal route that runs towards Sounio and the Marathon Dam.On September 17, the Paralympic Flame arrived in the Olympic Stadium during the Opening Ceremony.

==Medal count==
A total of 1567 medals were awarded during the Athens games: 519 gold, 516 silver, and 532 bronze. China topped the medal count for the first time with more gold medals, more silver medals, and more medals overall than any other nation. In the table below, the ranking sorts by the number of gold medals earned by a nation (in this context a nation is an entity represented by a National Paralympic Committee).

Among the top individual medal winners was Mayumi Narita of Japan, who took seven golds and one bronze medal in swimming, setting six world records in the process and bringing her overall Paralympic gold medal total to fifteen. Chantal Petitclerc of Canada won five golds and set three world records in wheelchair racing, while Swedish shooter Jonas Jacobsson took four gold medals. France&#x27;s Béatrice Hess won her nineteenth and twentieth Paralympic gold medals in swimming. Swimmer Trischa Zorn of the United States won just one medal, a bronze, but it was her 55th ever Paralympic medal. She retained her position as the most successful Paralympian of all times.

== Opening ceremony ==

The opening ceremony for the 2004 Summer Paralympics took place on the evening of 17 September,2004 in the Athens Olympic Stadium.The protagonist of the ceremony was a 26 meter high plane tree (with more than 195,000 leaves) acting also as the Tree of Life mounted in the center of the Olympic Stadium which symbolized the force of life and all positive forms of energy.This tree acted as a timeline between antiquity and modernity,contrasting with the symbolism of the olive tree,used during the Olympic Games opening ceremonies. 

The plane is an important part of the literary scenery of Plato&#x27;s dialogue Phaedrus and group of children raised lights to the sky in a visualization of Hippocrates passing on knowledge to future generations,alluding to the father of medicine Hippocrates.It was followed by a unique performance of ancient Greek philosophic concept of basic elements-fire, water, earth and air, in a concept based &quot;a journey to the sun&quot;.The formal part of the ceremony began with the Hymn to Liberty sung by the Games ambassador, the Greek singer Vicky Leandros. Using an allegory with theatrical parts as well as light and music, the show featured the story of human achievement and perseverance in the face of adversity, always falling back to the motif of human achievement and the strength of life being a considerable force in the world. Afterwards, the Parade of Nations started and was accompanied by the music of French composers Yves Stepping and Jean Christophe. The music featured throughout this parade told the story of Hephaestos, a Greek god and son of Zeus and Hera. Being unusually small, he was cast from Mount Olympus and left to die by his mother, but was nursed back to health by Thetis and Eurynome, who also taught him how to work a foundry. Despite all adversities and the impairments he incurred as a result of being cast down, Hephaestos grew up to become the god of Fire and Metallurgy, tying his myth into the topic of overcoming adversity through perseverance and the strength of life.After that, fireworks erupted at the stadium. There were 150 local support staff involved and 400 volunteers. The children were from ages 8 to 17, coming from Australia, France, Spain, Greece and Germany.The actors
Afroditi Simiti, Giannis Zouganelis and the interpreter Sophia Roboli were the Masters of Ceremonies.At the end of the ceremony, Greek tenor Mario Frangoulis performed alongside Kalli Georgelli a special song composed to the event. 
During the speaches,Sir Philip Craven, the President of the International Paralympic Committee, was accompanied by the head of the organizing committee Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, who told the athletes and the audience: &quot;The Olympic flame illuminates athletes. Many of you will leave Athens with medals, but all of you will leave as champions.&quot; Phil Craven quoted Democritus in his speech: &quot;Two thousand years ago, Democritus said &quot;To win oneself is the first and best of all victories.&quot; This holds true for all athletes, but especially for Paralympians. Recognising and cultivating your unique abilities and mastering challenges – you set standards and give expression for many people, young and old, around the world.&quot; The Games were officially declared opened by the President of the Hellenic Republic Konstantinos Stephanopoulos in Greek, accompanied by the Adjutant to the President of the Hellenic Republic Army Lieutenant Colonel Dimitrios Reskos.
The paralympic flame was lit by Georgios Toptsis, a pioneer athlete in Greece. Toptsis was won three medals (one silver and two bronze) between the 1988 and 1996 Games.

== Closing ceremony ==
The closing ceremony for the 2004 Summer Paralympics took place on 28 September 2004. The traditional cultural display was removed from the ceremony as a mark of respect for the deaths of seven teenagers from Farkadona, travelling to Athens, whose bus collided with a truck near the town of Kamena Vourla.

:&quot;The Athens Olympics Organising Committee [ATHOC] has decided to cancel the closing ceremony of the 12th Athens Paralympics as initially planned and scheduled because of the tragic accident that cost the life of pupils. The artistic and entertainment part of the ceremony will not take place.&quot; (official statement)

Flags were flown at half mast and a minute&#x27;s silence was observed. In contrast with the formal nature of the opening ceremony, the athletes entered the stadium for the final time as a collective. This was followed by official matters, including the handover to Beijing, hosts of the 2008 Summer Paralympics, and a cultural presentation by the delegation (which included a presentation of the new Paralympic &quot;agitos&quot; emblem). A procession of young people then made their way to join the athletes in the centre of the stadium carrying paper lanterns, before the Paralympic flame was extinguished.

==Calendar==

==Media coverage controversies==
Although the Paralympic Games were broadcast to around 1.6 billion viewers throughout 49 countries, some controversy was caused when no American television network stayed to broadcast the event. This resulted in some US viewers having to wait almost 2 months until the coverage was broadcast, compared with live feeds in several other countries.

===Paralympic Media Awards===
The BBC won the best broadcaster award.

== Sports ==
Following a scandal at the 2000 Summer Paralympics, in which the Spanish intellectually-disabled basketball team was stripped of their gold medal after it was found that multiple players had not met the eligibility requirements, ID-class events were suspended. During the IPC General Assembly held in December 2001, the IPC decided to remove events for the intellectually disabled and make several changes to other classifications of different events. In addition, the IPC also expanded the number of events for women in various sports such as judo and sitting volleyball (in which the standing event was replaced)There was also an expansion of events in wheelchair tennis with the addition of the open tournament for quads with the addition of the singles and doubles events. A new team event was also added in the program: 5-a-side football for the blind.

<text>Vivian Vance (born Vivian Roberta Jones; July 26, 1909 – August 17, 1979) was an American actress best known for playing landlady Ethel Mertz on the sitcom &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; (1951–1957), for which she won the 1953 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress, among other accolades. She also starred alongside Lucille Ball in &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; from 1962 until she left the series at the end of its third season in 1965. In 1991, she posthumously received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. She is most commonly identified as Lucille Ball’s longtime comedic foil from 1951 until her death in 1979.

==Early life==
Vance was born in Cherryvale, Kansas, the second of six children of Robert Andrew Jones, Sr., and Euphemia Mae (Ragan) Jones. When she was six, her family moved to Independence, Kansas, where she eventually began her dramatic studies at Independence High School with instructor Anna Ingleman. Her love of acting clashed with her mother&#x27;s strict religious beliefs. &quot;Viv&quot; soon rebelled, often sneaking out of her bedroom and staying out after curfew. She changed her surname to Vance and moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico, to find acting work, performing in the first show upon its opening at the Albuquerque Little Theatre in 1930. She appeared there in many other plays, including &quot;This Thing Called Love&quot; and &quot;The Cradle Song&quot;. The local theatre community helped pay her way to New York City to study under Eva Le Gallienne.

==Career==
===Broadway===
Starting in 1932, Vance was in a number of shows on Broadway, usually as a member of the chorus. Eventually, she graduated to supporting parts after understudying Ethel Merman as Reno Sweeney in &quot;Anything Goes&quot;. (She and Merman would appear together in an episode of &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; many decades later.)

Vance succeeded Kay Thompson in the musical &quot;Hooray for What!&quot; (1937). Her most successful stage role was that of Nancy Collister in the Cole Porter musical &quot;Let&#x27;s Face It!&quot; (1941), alongside Danny Kaye and Eve Arden for 547 performances.

===Film===
Following her appearance in a revival of &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot; in 1947, Vance decided to move to California to pursue other theatre projects and opportunities in film. During her stay in Los Angeles, Vance appeared in two films: as chambermaid Leah in &quot;The Secret Fury&quot; (1950), and as Alicia in &quot;The Blue Veil&quot; (1951). She received several positive notices for her performances, but the films did little else to further her screen career. Following her departure from &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; at the end of the third season, Vance signed on to appear in a Blake Edwards film, &quot;The Great Race&quot; (1965); she saw this as an opportunity to restart a movie career, which never really took off. The amusing film was a moderate success, receiving several Academy Award nominations.

===Television===
1951–1958: &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; and success
When Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball were casting their new television sitcom &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; in 1951, director Marc Daniels, who had previously worked with Vance in a theater production, suggested her for the role of landlady Ethel Mertz. Lucille Ball had wanted either Bea Benaderet or Barbara Pepper, both close friends, to play the role. CBS refused Pepper on the grounds she had a serious drinking problem, and Benaderet was already playing Blanche Morton on &quot;The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show&quot;.

Ultimately, the 42-year-old Vance won the role on the new television program, which debuted October 15, 1951, on CBS. Vance&#x27;s Ethel Mertz character was the landlady of a New York City apartment that she and her husband Fred owned on East 68th Street. The role of Fred Mertz was played by William Frawley, who was actually 22 years her senior. Despite their exceptional chemistry, comedic timing, and musical prowess together onscreen, Vance and Frawley did not get along offscreen. According to some reports, things first went sour when Frawley overheard Vance complaining about his age, stating that he should be playing her father instead of her husband. She used to skim through the script before she memorized her lines to see how many scenes she had with &quot;that stubborn-headed little Irishman.&quot;
Honored for her work in 1953, Vance became the first actress to win an Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress; she accepted her award at the Emmy ceremony in February 1954. She was nominated an additional three times (for 1954, 1956, and 1957) before the series ended.

In 1957, after the highly successful half-hour &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; episodes ended, Vance continued playing Ethel Mertz on a series of hour-long specials titled &quot;The Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show&quot; (later retitled &quot;The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour&quot;). When &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; was reformatted into the hour-long &quot;Lucy-Desi&quot; shows in 1957, Desi Arnaz offered Vance and Frawley the opportunity to star in their own &quot;Fred and Ethel&quot; spin-off show. Although Frawley was very interested, Vance declined, mainly because she did not want to work on a one-on-one basis with Frawley, as they already had an acrimonious relationship. Also, she felt the Mertz characters would be unsuccessful in a show without the Ricardos. Vance&#x27;s choice to decline the would-be show intensified the animosity between her and Frawley. Instead, Vance was interested in doing a series based on the life of Babs Hooten, a New York socialite who moves to New Mexico to run a hotel and ranch. Desi Arnaz financed a pilot starring Vance as Hooten titled &quot;Guestward, Ho!&quot;, which was shot in 1958 by Desilu; however, the show was rejected by CBS and Vance continued playing Ethel Mertz. Arnaz later retooled the show with model and actress Joanne Dru taking the lead role, selling the series to ABC, where it was subsequently cancelled after one season.

1962–1977: &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; and later works

In 1962, Lucille Ball was planning to return to television in a new series, &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;. The series starred Ball as Lucy Carmichael, a widow with two children living in Danfield, New York. Vance reluctantly agreed to be her co-star on the condition she be allowed to appear in more glamorous clothes and have her character be named &quot;Vivian&quot;. By this time in her life, Vance had grown tired of the public addressing her as &quot;Ethel&quot;.
After her departure from &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;, Vance appeared occasionally alongside Ball on reunion shows and made several guest appearances on Ball&#x27;s third sitcom, &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot; (1968–1974). In 1973, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. During this period, Vance&#x27;s agent got her an endorsement deal with Maxwell House coffee. Over the next several years, she appeared in numerous commercials for Maxwell House. Vance made a number of TV guest appearances in the 1970s, including a 1975 episode of &quot;Rhoda,&quot; as well as appearing in a number of made-for-TV movies, including &quot;The Front Page&quot; (1970), &quot;Getting Away From it All&quot; (1972), and &quot;The Great Houdini&quot; (1976). Ball and Vance appeared together one last time in the 1977 CBS special &quot;Lucy Calls the President.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Vance was married four times; her first three marriages ended in divorce. She was married to her third husband, actor Philip Ober, for 18 years. Ober was rumored to have physically abused Vance because he was envious of her successful career. On January 16, 1961, Vance married literary agent, editor, and publisher John Dodds. They lived in Stamford, Connecticut, then moved to California in 1974, remaining together until Vance&#x27;s death.

==Death and legacy==
Vance died at age 70 on August 17, 1979, of metastatic breast cancer. After her death, Desi Arnaz said, &quot;It’s bad enough to lose one of the great artists we had the honor and the pleasure to work with, but it’s even harder to reconcile the loss of one of your best friends.&quot;

Family members donated Vance&#x27;s Emmy Award to the Albuquerque Little Theatre after her death. In a 1986 interview, Lucille Ball talked about watching &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; reruns and her feelings about Vance&#x27;s performance:

&quot;I find that now I usually spend my time looking at Viv. Viv was sensational. And back then, there were things I had to do—I was in the projection room for some reason—and I just couldn&#x27;t concentrate on it. But now I can. And I enjoy every move that Viv made. She was something.&quot;
For her achievements in the field of television, Vance was posthumously awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame February 14, 1991, at 7030 Hollywood Boulevard.

Vance is memorialized in the Lucille Ball–Desi Arnaz Center in Jamestown, New York. On January 20, 2010, the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; reported a local antique dealer had inherited many of Vance&#x27;s photos and scrapbooks and a manuscript of her unpublished autobiography when John Dodds died in 1986. Vance and Frawley were both inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame in March 2012.

The story of how Vance was hired to play Ethel Mertz is told in &quot;I Love Lucy: A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Sitcom&quot;, a stage comedy which premiered in Los Angeles on July 12, 2018. Written by Gregg Oppenheimer (son of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; creator-producer-head writer Jess Oppenheimer), it was recorded before a live audience for a nationwide public radio broadcast, and later, online distribution.

Vance was played by Robin Pearson Rose in the 1991 television movie, &quot;Lucy &amp; Desi: Before the Laughter&quot;. Thirty years later, she was portrayed by Tony-winning actress Nina Arianda in the motion picture film, &quot;Being the Ricardos&quot; (2021).

<doc id="346312" wikidata="Q235715" url="?curid=346312" title="Tachinidae">
<text>The Tachinidae are a large and variable family of true flies within the insect order Diptera, with more than 8,200 known species and many more to be discovered. Over 1,300 species have been described in North America alone. Insects in this family commonly are called tachinid flies or simply tachinids. As far as is known, they all are protelean parasitoids, or occasionally parasites, of arthropods, usually other insects. The family is known from many habitats in all zoogeographical regions and is especially diverse in South America.

== Life cycle ==

Reproductive strategies vary greatly between tachinid species, largely, but not always clearly, according to their respective life cycles. Many species are generalists rather than specialists. Comparatively few are restricted to a single host species, so there is little tendency towards the close co-evolution one finds in the adaptations of many specialist species to their hosts, such as are typical of protelean parasitoids among the Hymenoptera.

Larvae (maggots) of most members of this family are parasitoids (developing inside a living host, ultimately killing it). In contrast, a few are parasitic (not generally killing the host). Tachinid larvae feed on the host tissues, either after having been injected into the host by the parent, or penetrating the host from outside. Various species have different modes of oviposition and of host invasion. Typically, tachinid larvae are endoparasites (internal parasites) of caterpillars of butterflies and moths, or the eruciform larvae of sawflies. For example, they have been found to lay eggs in African sugarcane borer larva, a species of moth common in sub-Saharan Africa, as well as the more northerly Arctic woolly bear moth. However, some species attack adult beetles and some attack beetle larvae. Others attack various types of true bugs, and others attack grasshoppers; a few even attack centipedes. Also parasitised are bees, wasps and sawflies.

== Oviposition ==

Probably the majority of female tachinids lay white, ovoid eggs with flat undersides onto the skin of the host insect. Imms mentions the genera &quot;Gymnosoma&quot;, &quot;Thrixion&quot;, &quot;Winthemia&quot;, and &quot;Eutachina&quot; as examples. In a closely related strategy some genera are effectively ovoviviparous (some authorities prefer the term &quot;ovolarviparous&quot;) and deposit a hatching larva onto the host. For example, this occurs in Tachinidae species which parasitize the butterfly &quot;Danaus chrysippus&quot; in Ghana. The free larvae immediately bore into the host&#x27;s body. Illustrative genera include &quot;Exorista&quot; and &quot;Voria&quot;. Many tachinid eggs hatch quickly, having partly developed inside the mother&#x27;s uterus, which is long and often coiled for retaining developing eggs. However, it is suggested that the primitive state probably is to stick unembryonated eggs to the surface of the host.

Many other species inject eggs into the host&#x27;s body, using the extensible, penetrating part of their ovipositor, sometimes called the oviscapt, which roughly translates to &quot;egg digger&quot;. Species in the genera &quot;Ocyptera&quot;, &quot;Alophora&quot;, and &quot;Compsilura&quot; are examples.


In many species only one egg is laid on or in any individual host, and accordingly such an egg tends to be large, as is typical for eggs laid in small numbers. They are large enough to be clearly visible if stuck onto the outside of the host, and they generally are so firmly stuck that eggs cannot be removed from the skin of the host without killing them. Furthermore, scientists have observed in studies with the host cabbage looper that being glued to the host insect helps maggots burrow into the larva, where they remain until fully developed.

Yet another strategy of oviposition among some Tachinidae is to lay large numbers of small, darkly coloured eggs on the food plants of the host species. &quot;Sturmia&quot;, &quot;Zenillia&quot;, and &quot;Gonia&quot; are such genera.

Many tachinids are important natural enemies of major insect pests, and some species actually are used in biological pest control; for example, some species of tachinid flies have been introduced into North America from their native lands as biocontrols to suppress populations of alien pests. Conversely, certain tachinid flies that prey on useful insects are themselves considered as pests; they can present troublesome problems in the sericulture industry by attacking silkworm larvae. One particularly notorious silkworm pest is the Uzi fly (&quot;Exorista bombycis&quot;).

Another reproductive strategy is to leave the eggs in the host&#x27;s environment; for example, the female might lay on leaves, where the host is likely to ingest them. Some tachinids that are parasitoids of stem-boring caterpillars deposit eggs outside the host&#x27;s burrow, letting the first instar larvae do the work of finding the host for themselves. In other species, the maggots use an ambush technique, waiting for the host to pass and then attacking it and burrowing into its body.

Adult tachinids are not parasitic, but either do not feed at all or visit flowers, decaying matter, or similar sources of energy to sustain themselves until they have concluded their procreative activities. Their non-parasitic behaviour after eclosion from the pupa is what justifies the application of the term &quot;protelean&quot;.

==Description==
Tachinid flies are extremely varied in appearance. Some adult flies may be brilliantly colored and resemble blow-flies (family Calliphoridae). Most however are rather drab, some resembling house flies. However, tachinid flies commonly are more bristly and more robust. Also, they usually have a characteristic appearance. They have three-segmented antennae, a diagnostically prominent postscutellum bulging beneath the scutellum (a segment of the mesonotum). They are aristate flies, and the arista usually is bare, though sometimes plumose. The calypters (small flaps above the halteres) are usually very large. Their fourth long vein bends away sharply.

Adult flies feed on flowers and nectar from aphids and scale insects. As many species typically feed on pollen, they can be important pollinators of some plants, especially at higher elevations in mountains where bees are relatively few.

The taxonomy of this family presents many difficulties. It is largely based on morphological characters of the adult flies, but also on reproductive habits and on the immature stage.

==As biological pest control==
Some tachinid flies parasitize pest species. This has allowed them to be used as biological control agents by farmers. Some Tachinidae are generalists; for instance, &quot;Compsilura concinnata&quot; uses, at least, 200 different hosts, and thus are less safe to be used as biological controls because they will attack non-pest species, resulting in population decline. Others are more specialized and are safer; for instance, &quot;Istocheta aldrichi&quot;, which only attacks the Japanese beetle.

==Evolution==

This clade appears to have originated in the middle Eocene. The oldest known putatively tachinid fossil (&quot;Lithexorista&quot;) dates from the Eocene Green River Formation in Wyoming.

<doc id="346315" wikidata="Q12406385" url="?curid=346315" title="Human variability">
<text>Human variability, or human variation, is the range of possible values for any characteristic, physical or mental, of human beings.

Frequently debated areas of variability include cognitive ability, personality, physical appearance (body shape, skin color, etc.) and immunology.
Variability is partly heritable and partly acquired (&quot;nature vs. nurture&quot; debate).
As the human species exhibits sexual dimorphism, many traits show significant variation not just between populations but also between the sexes.

==Sources of human variability==
Human variability is attributed to a combination of environmental and genetic sources including: 
For the genetic variables listed above, few of the traits characterizing human variability are controlled by simple Mendelian inheritance. Most are polygenic or are determined by a complex combination of genetics and environment.

Many genetic differences (polymorphisms) have little effect on health or reproductive success but help to distinguish one population from another. It is helpful for researchers in the field of population genetics to study ancient migrations and relationships between population groups.

===Environmental factors===
====Climate and disease====
Other important factors of environmental factors include climate and disease. Climate has effects on determining what kinds of human variation are more adaptable to survive without much restrictions and hardships. For example, people who live in a climate where there is a lot of exposure to sunlight have a darker color of skin tone. Evolution has caused production of folate (folic acid) from UV radiation, thus giving them darker skin tone with more melanin to make sure child development is smooth and successful. Conversely, people who live farther away from the equator have a lighter skin tone. This is due to a need for an increased exposure and absorbance of sunlight to make sure the body can produce enough vitamin D for survival.

Blackfoot disease is a disease caused by environmental pollution and causes people to have black, charcoal-like skin in the lower limbs. This is caused by arsenic pollution in water and food source. This is an example of how disease can affect human variation. Another disease that can affect human variation is syphilis, a sexual transmitted disease. Syphilis does not affect human variation until the middle stage of the disease. It then starts to grow rashes all over the body, affecting people&#x27;s human variation.

==== Nutrition ====
Phenotypic variation is a combination of one&#x27;s genetics and their surrounding environment, with no interaction or mutual influence between the two. This means that a significant portion of human variability can be controlled by human behavior. Nutrition and diet play a substantial role in determining phenotype because they are arguably the most controllable forms of environmental factors that create epigenetic changes. This is because they can be changed or altered relatively easily as opposed to other environmental factors like location. 

If people are reluctant to changing their diets, consuming harmful foods can have chronic negative effects on variability. One such instance of this occurs when eating certain chemicals through one&#x27;s diet or consuming carcinogens, which can have adverse effects on individual phenotype. For example, Bisphenol A (BPA) is a known endocrine disruptor that mimics the hormone estradiol and can be found in various plastic products. BPA seeps into food or drinks when the plastic containing it is heated up and begins to melt. When these contaminated substances are consumed, especially often and over long periods of time, one&#x27;s risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease increases. BPA also has the potential to alter &quot;physiological weight control patterns.&quot; Examples such as this demonstrate that preserving a healthy phenotype largely rests on nutritional decision-making skills.

The concept that nutrition and diet affect phenotype extends to what the mother eats during pregnancy, which can have drastic effects on the outcome of the phenotype of the child. A recent study by researchers at the MRC International Nutrition Group shows that &quot;methylation machinery can be disrupted by nutrient deficiencies and that this can lead to disease&quot; susceptibility in newborn babies. The reason for this is because methyl groups have the ability to silence certain genes. Increased deficiencies of various nutrients such as this have the potential to permanently change the epigenetics of the baby.

Genetic variation in humans may mean any variance in phenotype which results from heritable allele expression, mutations, and epigenetic changes. While human phenotypes may seem diverse, individuals actually differ by only 1 in every 1,000 base pairs and is primarily the result of inherited genetic differences. Pure consideration of alleles is often referred to as Mendelian Genetics, or more properly Classical Genetics, and involves the assessment of whether a given trait is dominant or recessive and thus, at what rates it will be inherited.  The color of one&#x27;s eyes was long believed to occur with a pattern of brown-eye dominance, with blue eyes being a recessive characteristic resulting from a past mutation. However, it is now understood that eye color is controlled by various genes, and thus, may not follow as distinct a pattern as previously believed. The trait is still the result of variance in genetic sequence between individuals as a result of inheritance from their parents. Common traits which may be linked to genetic patterns are earlobe attachment, hair color, and hair growth patterns.

In terms of evolution, genetic mutations are the origins of differences in alleles between individuals. However, mutations may also occur within a person&#x27;s life-time and be passed down from parent to offspring. In some cases, mutations may result in genetic diseases, such as Cystic Fibrosis, which is the result of a mutation to the CFTR gene that is recessively inherited from both parents. In other cases, mutations may be harmless or phenotypically unnoticeable. We are able to treat biological traits as manifestations of either a single loci or multiple loci, labeling said biological traits as either monogenic or polygenic, respectively. Concerning polygenic traits it may be essential to be mindful of inter-genetic interactions or epistasis. Although epistasis is a significant genetic source of biological variation, it is only additive interactions that are heritable as other epistatic interactions involve recondite inter-genetic relationships. Epistatic interactions in of themselves vary further with their dependency on the results of the mechanisms of recombination and crossing over.

The ability of genes to be expressed may also be a source of variation between individuals and result in changes to phenotype. This may be the result of epigenetics, which are founded upon an organism&#x27;s phenotypic plasticity, with such a plasticity even being heritable. Epigenetics may result from methylation of gene sequences leading to the blocking of expression or changes to histone protein structuring as a result of environmental or biological cues. Such alterations influence how genetic material is handled by the cell and to what extent certain DNA sections are expressed and compose the epigenome. The division between what can be considered as a genetic source of biological variation and not becomes immensely arbitrary as we approach aspects of biological variation such as epigenetics. Indeed, gene specific gene expression and inheritance may be reliant on environmental  influences.

=== Cultural factors ===

Archaeological findings such as those that indicate that the Middle Stone Age and the Acheulean – identified as a specific &#x27;cultural phases&#x27; of humanity with a number of characteristics – lasted substantially longer in some places or &#x27;ended&#x27; at times over 100,000 years apart, highlight a significant spatiotemporal cultural variability in and complexity of the sociocultural history and evolution of humanity. In some cases cultural factors may be intertwined with genetic and environmental factors.

==Measuring variation==
===Scientific===
Measurement of human variation can fall under the purview of several scholarly disciplines, many of which lie at the intersection of biology and statistics. The methods of biostatistics, the application of statistical methods to the analysis of biological data, and bioinformatics, the application of information technologies to the analysis of biological data, are utilized by researchers in these fields to uncover significant patterns of variability. Some fields of scientific research include the following:

Demography is a branch of statistics and sociology concerned with the statistical study of populations, especially humans. A demographic analysis can measure various metrics of a population, most commonly metrics of size and growth, diversity in culture, ethnicity, language, religious belief, political belief, etc. Biodemography is a subfield which specifically integrates biological understanding into demographics analysis.

In the social sciences, social research is conducted and collected data is analyzed under statistical methods. The methodologies of this research can be divided into qualitative and quantitative designs. Some example subdisciplines include:

* Anthropology, the study of human societies. Comparative research in subfields of anthropology may yield results on human variation with respect to the subfield&#x27;s topic of interest.
* Psychology, the study of behavior from a mental perspective. Does a lot of experiments and analysis grouped into quantitative or qualitative research methods.
* Sociology, the study of behavior from a social perspective. Sociological research can be conducted in either quantitative or qualitative formats, depending on the nature of data collected and the subfield of sociology under which the research falls. Analysis of this data is subject to quantitative or qualitative methods. Computational sociology is also a method of producing useful data for studies of social behavior.

===Anthropometry===
Anthropometry is the study of the measurements of different parts of the human body. Common measurements include height, weight, organ size (brain, stomach, penis, vagina), and other bodily metrics such as waist–hip ratio. Each measurement can vary significantly between populations; for instance, the average height of males of European descent is 178 cm ± 7 cm and of females of European descent is 165 cm ± 7 cm. Meanwhile, average height of Nilotic males in Dinka is 181.3 cm.

Applications of anthropometry include ergonomics, biometrics, and forensics. Knowing the distribution of body measurements enable designers to build better tools for workers. Anthropometry is also used when designing safety equipment such as seat belts. In biometrics, measurements of fingerprints and iris patterns can be used for secure identification purposes.

===Measuring genetic variation===
Human genomics and population genetics are the study of the human genome and variome, respectively. Studies in these areas may concern the patterns and trends in human DNA. The Human Genome Project and The Human Variome Project are examples of large scale studies of the entire human population to collect data which can be analyzed to understand genomic and genetic variation in individuals, respectively.
* The Human Genome Project is the largest scientific project in the history of biology. At a cost of $3.8 billion in funding and over a period of 13 years from 1990 to 2003, the project processed through DNA sequencing the approximately 3 billion base pairs and catalogued the 20,000 to 25,000 genes in human DNA. The project made the data available to all scientific researchers and developed analytical tools for processing this information. A particular finding regarding human variability due to difference in DNA made possible by the Human Genome Project is that any two individuals share 99.9% of their nucleotide sequences.
* The Human Variome Project is a similar undertaking with the goal of identification and categorization of the set of human genetic variation, specifically variations which are medically pertinent. This project will also provide a data repository for further research and analysis of disease. The Human Variome Project was launched in 2006 and is being run by an international community of researchers and representatives, including collaborators from the World Health Organization and the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization.

====Genetic drift====

Genetic drift is one method by which variability occurs in populations. Unlike natural selection, genetic drift occurs when alleles decrease randomly over time and not as a result of selection bias. Over a long history, this can cause significant shifts in the underlying genetic distribution of a population. We can model genetic drift with the Wright-Fisher model. In a population of N with 2N genes, there are two alleles with frequencies p and q. If the previous generation had an allele with frequency p, then the probability that the next generation has k of that allele is:

formula_1

Over time, one allele will be fixed when the frequency of that allele reaches 1 and the frequency of the other allele reaches 0. The probability that any allele is fixed is proportional to the frequency of that allele. For two alleles with frequencies p and q, the probability that p will be fixed is p. The expected number of generations for an allele with frequency p to be fixed is:

formula_2

Where &quot;N&quot;&quot;e&quot; is the effective population size.

====Single-nucleotide polymorphism====

Single-nucleotide polymorphism or SNPs are variations of a single nucleotide. SNPs can occur in coding or non-coding regions of genes and on average occur once every 300 nucleotides. SNPs in coding regions can cause synonymous, missense, and nonsense mutations. SNPs have shown to be correlated with drug responses and risk of diseases such as sickle-cell anemia, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, cystic fibrosis, and more.

====DNA fingerprinting====

DNA profiling, whereby a DNA fingerprint is constructed by extracting a DNA sample from body tissue or fluid. Then, it is segmented using restriction enzymes and each segment marked with probes then exposed on X-ray film. The segments form patterns of black bars;the DNA fingerprint. DNA Fingerprints are used in conjunction with other methods in order to individuals information in Federal programs such as CODIS (Combined DNA Index System for Missing Persons) in order to help identify individuals 

==== Mitochondrial DNA ====
Mitochondrial DNA, which is only passed from mother to child. The first human population studies based on mitochondrial DNA were performed by restriction enzyme analyses (RFLPs) and revealed differences between the four ethnic groups (Caucasian, Amerindian, African, and Asian). Differences in mtDNA patterns have also been shown in communities with a different geographic origin within the same ethnic group

====Alloenzymic variation====
Alloenzymic variation, a source of variation that identifies protein variants of the same gene due to amino acid substitutions in proteins. After grinding tissue to release the cytoplasm, wicks are used to absorb the resulting extract and placed in a slit cut into a starch gel. A low current is run across the gel resulting in a positive and negative ends. Proteins are then separated by charge and size, with the smaller and more highly charged molecules moving more quickly across the gel. This techniques does underestimate true genetic variability as there may be an amino acid substitution but if the amino acid is not charged differently than the original no difference in migration will appear it is estimated that approximately 1/3 of the true genetic variation is not expressed by this technique.

====Structural variation====
Structural variation, which can include insertions, deletions, duplications, and mutations in DNA. Within the human population, about 13% of the human genome is defined as structurally variant.

====Phenotypic variation====

Phenotypic variation, which accounts for both genetic and epigenetic factors that affect what characteristics are shown. For applications such as organ donations and matching, phenotypic variation of blood type, tissue type, and organ size are considered.

==Civic==
Measurement of human variation may also be initiated by governmental parties. A government may conduct a census, the systematic recording of an entire population of a region. The data may be used for calculating metrics of demography such as sex, gender, age, education, employment, etc.; this information is utilized for civic, political, economic, industrial, and environmental assessment and planning.

==Commercial==
Commercial motivation for understanding variation in human populations arises from the competitive advantage of tailoring products and services for a specific target market. A business may undertake some form of market research in order to collect data on customer preference and behavior and implement changes which align with the results.

==Social significance and valuation==
Both individuals and entire societies and cultures place values on different aspects of human variability; however, values can change as societies and cultures change. Not all people agree on the values or relative rankings, and neither do all societies and cultures. Nonetheless, nearly all human differences have a social value dimension. Examples of variations which may be given different values in different societies include skin color and/or body structure. Race and sex have a strong value difference, while handedness has a much weaker value difference. The values given to different traits among human variability are often influenced by what phenotypes are more prevalent locally. Local valuation may affect social standing, reproductive opportunities, or even survival.

Differences may vary or be distributed in various ways. Some, like height for a given sex, vary in close to a &quot;normal&quot; or Gaussian distribution. Other characteristics (e.g., skin color) vary continuously in a population, but the continuum may be socially divided into a small number of distinct categories. Then, there are some characteristics that vary bimodally (for example, handedness), with fewer people in intermediate categories.

==Classification and evaluation of traits==
When an inherited difference of body structure or function is severe enough to cause a significant hindrance in certain perceived abilities, it is termed a genetic disease, but even this categorization has fuzzy edges. There are many instances in which the degree of negative value of a human difference depends completely on the social or physical environment. For example, in a society with a large proportion of deaf people (as Martha&#x27;s Vineyard in the 19th century), it was possible to deny that deafness is a disability. Another example of social renegotiation of the value assigned to a difference is reflected in the controversy over management of ambiguous genitalia, especially whether abnormal genital structure has enough negative consequences to warrant surgical correction.

Furthermore, many genetic traits may be advantageous in certain circumstances and disadvantageous in others. Being a heterozygote or carrier of the sickle-cell disease gene confers some protection against malaria, apparently enough to maintain the gene in populations of malarial areas. In a homozygous dose it is a significant disability.

Each trait has its own advantages and disadvantages, but sometimes a trait that is found desirable may not be favorable in terms of certain biological factors such as reproductive fitness, and traits that are not highly valued by the majority of people may be favorable in terms of biological factors. For example, women tend to have fewer pregnancies on average than before and therefore net worldwide fertility rates are dropping. Moreover, this leads to the fact that multiple births tend to be favorable in terms of number of children and therefore offspring count; when the average number of pregnancies and the average number of children was higher, multiple births made only a slight relative difference in number of children. However, with fewer pregnancies, multiple births can make the difference in number of children relatively large. A hypothetical scenario would be that couple 1 has ten children and couple 2 has eight children, but in both couples, the woman undergoes eight pregnancies. This is not a large difference in ratio of fertility. However, another hypothetical scenario can be that couple 1 has three children and couple 2 has one child but in both couples the woman undergoes one pregnancy (in this case couple 2 has triplets). When the proportion of offspring count in the latter hypothetical scenario is compared, the difference in proportion of offspring count becomes higher. A trait in women known to greatly increase the chance of multiple births is being a tall woman (presumably the chance is further increased when the woman is very tall among both women and men). Yet very tall women are not viewed as a desirable phenotype by the majority of people, and the phenotype of very tall women has not been highly favored in the past. Nevertheless, values placed on traits can change over time.

Such an example is homosexuality. In Ancient Greece, what in present terms would be called homosexuality, primarily between a man and a young boy, was not uncommon and was not outlawed. However, homosexuality became more condemned. Attitudes towards homosexuality alleviated in modern times.

Acknowledgement and study of human differences does have a wide range of uses, such as tailoring the size and shape of manufactured items. See Ergonomics.

==Controversies of sociocultural and personal implications==
Possession of above average amounts of some abilities is valued by most societies. Some of the traits that societies try to measure by perception are intellectual aptitude in the form of ability to learn, artistic prowess, strength, endurance, agility, and resilience.

Each individual&#x27;s distinctive differences, even the negatively valued or stigmatized ones, are usually considered an essential part of self-identity.
Membership or status in a social group may depend on having specific values for certain attributes. It is not unusual for people to deliberately try to amplify or exaggerate differences, or to conceal or minimize them, for a variety of reasons. Examples of practices designed to minimize differences include tanning, hair straightening, skin bleaching, plastic surgery, orthodontia, and growth hormone treatment for extreme shortness. Conversely, male-female differences are enhanced and exaggerated in most societies.

In some societies, such as the United States, circumcision is practiced on a majority of males, as well as sex reassignment on intersex infants, with substantial emphasis on cultural and religious norms. Circumcision is highly controversial because although it offers health benefits, such as less chance of urinary tract infections, STDs, and penile cancer, it is considered a drastic procedure that is not medically mandatory and argued as a decision that should be taken when the child is old enough to decide for himself. Similarly, sex reassignment surgery offers psychiatric health benefits to transgender people but is seen as unethical by some Christians, especially when performed on children.

Much controversy surrounds the assigning or distinguishing of some variations, especially since differences between groups in a society or between societies is often debated as part of either a person&#x27;s &quot;essential&quot; nature or a socially constructed attribution. For example, there has long been a debate among sex researchers on whether sexual orientation is due to evolution and biology (the &quot;essentialist&quot; position), or a result of mutually reinforcing social perceptions and behavioral choices (the &quot;constructivist&quot; perspective). The essentialist position emphasizes inclusive fitness as the reason homosexuality has not been eradicated by natural selection. Gay or lesbian individuals have not been greatly affected by evolutionary selection because they may help the fitness of their siblings and siblings&#x27; children, thus increasing their own fitness through inclusive fitness and maintaining evolution of homosexuality. Biological theories for same gender sexual orientation include genetic influences, neuroanatomical factors, and hormone differences but research so far has not provided any conclusive results. In contrast, the social constructivist position argues that sexuality is a result of culture and has originated from language or dialogue about sex. Mating choices are the product of cultural values, such as youth and attractiveness, and homosexuality varies greatly between cultures and societies. In this view, complexities, such as sexual orientation changing during the course of one&#x27;s lifespan, are accounted for.

Controversy also surrounds the boundaries of &quot;wellness&quot;, &quot;wholeness,&quot; or &quot;normality.&quot; In some cultures, differences in physical appearance, mental ability, and even sex can exclude one from traditions, ceremonies, or other important events, such as religious service. For example, in India, menstruation is not only a taboo subject but also traditionally considered shameful. Depending on beliefs, a woman who is menstruating is not allowed to cook or enter spiritual areas because she is &quot;impure&quot; and &quot;cursed&quot;. There has been large-scale renegotiation of the social significance of variations which reduce the ability of a person to do one or more functions in western culture. Laws have been passed to alleviate the reduction of social opportunity available to those with disabilities. The concept of &quot;differently abled&quot; has been pushed by those persuading society to see limited incapacities as a human difference of less negative value.

==Ideologies of superiority and inferiority==
The extreme exercise of social valuation of human difference is in the definition of &quot;human.&quot; Differences between humans can lead to an individual&#x27;s &quot;nonhuman&quot; status, in the sense of withholding identification, charity, and social participation. Views of these variations can change enormously between cultures over time. For example, nineteenth-century European and American ideas of race and eugenics culminated in the attempts of the Nazi-led German society of the 1930s to deny not just reproduction, but life itself to a variety of people with &quot;differences&quot; attributed in part to biological characteristics. Hitler and Nazi leaders wanted to create a &quot;master race&quot; consisting of only Aryans, or blue-eyed, blonde-haired, and tall individuals, thus discriminating and attempting to exterminate those who didn&#x27;t fit into this ideal.

Contemporary controversy continues over &quot;what kind of human&quot; is a fetus or child with a significant disability. On one end are people who would argue that Down syndrome is not a disability but a mere &quot;difference,&quot; and on the other those who consider it such a calamity as to assume that such a child is better off &quot;not born&quot;. For example, in India and China, being female is widely considered such a negatively valued human difference that female infanticide occurs such to severely affect the proportion of sexes.

<doc id="346321" wikidata="Q5241255" url="?curid=346321" title="Sing Tao Daily">
<text>The Sing Tao Daily (also known as Sing Tao Jih Pao; ) is among Hong Kong&#x27;s oldest Chinese language newspapers. It is owned by Sing Tao News Corporation, of which Kwok Ying-shing () is chairman. Its English-language sister is the free newspaper &quot;The Standard&quot;.

Sing Tao&#x27;s Toronto edition is partly owned by Star Media Group, the publisher of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, a Torstar Corporation company.

== History ==

Sing Tao Daily is the oldest Chinese language daily newspaper in Hong Kong, having commenced publication on 1 August 1938.

The first overseas edition of the paper was launched in 1963 in San Francisco, where the group’s first overseas office was set up in May 1964.

In 1992, &quot;Sing Tao Daily&quot;, encountering financial difficulties, established a joint publication with the International Culture Publishing Corporation, a front organization for China&#x27;s Ministry of State Security according to Alex Joske. 

Until 2002, the parent company of &quot;Sing Tao Daily&quot; was Sing Tao Holdings; since then it has been Sing Tao News Corporation.

In June 2021, a real estate developer&#x27;s daughter from mainland China purchased a majority stake in the company.

In August 2021, the U.S. branch of &quot;Sing Tao Daily&quot; started to register as a foreign agent under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) at the order of the United States Department of Justice. The company said the incident involved libel and it would seek legal actions.

== Political stance ==

The &quot;Sing Tao&quot; has a long pro-government history. Before the handover of Hong Kong to China, it supported the Kuomintang and British Hong Kong government; and once Hong Kong was transferred and turned into a special administrative region, the paper turned its support to the Beijing government. Sing Tao’s reporting on China now aligns with that of state-run media from Beijing.

===Reports of Chinese Communist Party influence===
A 2001 article by the Jamestown Foundation claimed that two of &quot;Sing Tao&quot;&#x27;s owners were members of Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference and one editor had previously worked for &quot;China Daily&quot;. According to a Hoover Institution report, Sing Tao was purchased by a pro-Beijing businessman in May 2001, who soon after partnered with the Xinhua News Agency to establish a joint venture, leading to the formation of an information-service company named Xinhua Online. It is another formerly independent Chinese newspaper that has fallen under Beijing’s control. In 2013, an analyst at Freedom House wrote in a report submitted to the Center for International Media Assistance that in recent decades, &quot;Sing Tao&quot;&#x27;s management and owners began practicing &quot;self-censorship,&quot; &quot;high-risk&quot; contributors were terminated, and journalists left due to an &quot;unpalatable editorial policy.&quot; Topics such as the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, human rights in Tibet, and Taiwanese independence were minimized or avoided.

<doc id="346323" wikidata="Q26961344" url="?curid=346323" title="Bow shape">
<text>In archery, the shape of the bow is usually taken to be the view from the side. It is the product of the complex relationship of material stresses, designed by a bowyer. This shape, viewing the limbs, is designed to take into account the construction materials, the performance required, and the intended use of the bow.

There are many different kinds of bow shapes. However, most fall into three main categories: straight, recurve and compound. Straight and recurve are considered traditional bows. If a limb is &#x27;straight&#x27; its effective length remains the same as the bow is drawn. That is, the string goes directly to the nock in the strung (braced) position. The materials must withstand these stresses, store the energy, and rapidly give back that energy efficiently. Many bows, especially traditional self bows, are made approximately straight in side-view profile. Longbows as used by English archers in the Middle Ages at such battles as Crecy and Agincourt were straight limb bows. A recurve bow has tips that curve away from the archer when the bow is strung. By one definition, the difference between recurve and other bows is that the string touches a section of the limb when the bow is strung. Recurve bows made out of composite materials were used by, among other groups, the Persians, Parthians, Scythians, Hyksos, Magyars, Bulgars, Huns, Turks, Mongols, and Chinese.

== Design factors ==

If a limb is &#x27;straight&#x27; its effective length remains the same as the bow is drawn. That is, the string goes directly to the nock in the strung (braced) position. When the limb is recurved (tip of limb away from the archer), the string touches the limb before it gets to the nock. The effective length of the limb, as the draw commences, is therefore shorter. However, as the bow is drawn, the recurve &#x27;unwinds&#x27;, the limb becomes effectively longer, and the mechanical advantage of the archer increases. Counter to this, stresses are building up in the materials of the limbs. The belly of the bow (nearest the archer) is in compression, the back (furthest away from the archer) is in tension, and the line between is in shear.

The materials must withstand these stresses, store the energy, and rapidly give back that energy efficiently. The amount of energy stored is determined by the stresses withstood and the shape of the limb, from the unstrung position to strung (consider as pre-stressed), then de-formed further to full draw as the recurve unwinds. These basic principles of changing mechanical advantage, to efficiently store more energy, and deliver it to accelerate the arrow, were clearly understood in antiquity, as shown by the examples that follow.

== Straight bows ==
Many bows, especially traditional self bows, are made approximately straight in side-view profile. They are generally referred to as straight, despite the minor curves of natural wood and the &quot;set&quot; or curvature that a wooden bow takes after use. When the archer commences the draw, mechanical advantage is at its greatest and the bow limbs are only pre-stressed to the strung position; therefore drawing weight is at a minimum. However, the drawing weight rapidly increases because mechanical advantage reduces (consider the string is pulling more and more directly on the limbs) and stresses are building up in the limbs. Consequently, drawing weight &#x27;stacks&#x27; (very rapidly increases). On release, the reverse happens, the arrow is accelerated by maximum force, and this force rapidly decreases. Hence, the arrow must be sturdy enough to withstand such acceleration and, as the string may decelerate, it is possible for the arrow to leave the string prematurely, which is inefficient.

Longbows as used by English Archers in the Middle Ages at such battles as Crecy and Agincourt were straight limb bows, usually made of yew and with heavy draw weights, used en masse. The arrows were also long and heavy.

== Recurve bows ==

A recurve bow has tips that curve away from the archer when the bow is unstrung. By definition, the difference between recurve and other bows is that the string touches a section of the limb when the bow is strung. A recurve bow stores more energy and delivers energy more efficiently than an equivalent straight-limbed bow, giving a greater amount of energy and speed to the arrow. A recurve will permit a shorter bow than the simple straight limb bow for a given arrow energy and this form was often preferred by archers in environments where long weapons could be cumbersome, such as in brush and forest terrain, or while on horseback.

Recurved limbs also put greater strain on the materials used to make the bow, and they may make more noise with the shot. Extreme recurves make the bow unstable when being strung. An unstrung recurve bow can have a confusing shape and many Native American weapons, when separated from their original owners and cultures, were incorrectly strung backwards and destroyed when attempts were made to shoot them.

The unqualified phrase &quot;recurve bow&quot; or just &quot;a recurve&quot; in modern archery circles usually refers to a typical modern recurve bow, as used by archers in the Olympics and many other competitive events.

== Reflex bows ==

A &quot;reflex bow&quot; is a bow that has curved or curled arms which turn away from the archer throughout their length. When unstrung, the entire length of the bow curves forward from the belly (away from the archer), resembling a &quot;C&quot;; this differentiates a reflex bow from a recurve bow in which only the outer parts of the limbs turn away from the archer. The curves put the materials of the bow under greater stress, allowing a rather short bow to have a high draw weight and a long draw length. This allows a bow that is significantly shorter than a recurve or a longbow to shoot with the same or greater velocity and power. They became the classic weapon of the horse archers who have repeatedly conquered much of Asia and Europe; their short profile compared with longer bows made them ideal for horseback use. However, the materials and workmanship must be of high quality. 

Bows of traditional materials with significant reflex are almost all composite bows, made of the classic three layers of horn, wood, and sinew; they are normally made in the recurve shape. Highly reflexed composite bows are still used in Korea and were common in Turkish and Indian traditional archery. Highly reflexed bows can in some cases require special bracing and stringing methods or tools such as a bracing board.

== Decurve bows ==

A &quot;decurve bow&quot; is a bow that has arms curved or curled at the ends to turn towards the archer. This bow form reduces the strain on the bow when it is used, and the bow may be under no tension at all when strung, so that it can be kept ready for immediate use at all times. It also reduces the energy stored in the bow, and the speed of the arrow. The form is seldom used in modern or historical bows, but was occasionally used by groups such as the Mohave who did not have easy access to good quality bow wood. It allowed them to make effective hunting weapons from the poor-quality material available. A decurve bow is seen in a rock painting from the Tassili plateau in the Sahara.

== Deflex bows ==

A &quot;deflex bow&quot; is a bow that has arms curved or curled at the base, to turn towards the archer when unstrung. This bow form reduces the strain on the limbs and also the energy stored by the weapon. Most modern recurve bows are built with some degree of deflex. It has been used occasionally in traditional bows, for example to make a bow that looks like a traditional hornbow without using any actual horn.

== Compound bows ==

The &quot;compound bow&quot;, not to be confused with a composite bow, is a modern bow that uses a levering system, usually of cables and pulleys, to bend the limbs. The limbs of a compound bow are much stiffer than those of a recurve bow or longbow. This limb stiffness makes the compound bow more energy-efficient than other bows, in conjunction with the pulley/cams. The typical compound bow has its string applied to pulleys (cams), and one or both of the pulleys have one or more cables attached to the opposite limb. When the string is drawn back, the string causes the pulleys to turn. When the draw commences, the archer has reduced mechanical advantage, but during the draw, as the pulley cams rotate, and the archer gains mechanical advantage over the bending limbs, more energy is stored, in comparison with other bows.

== Shaping and tapering ==
Bows usually taper from the handle to the tips. Tapering reduces mass in the outer limb and dissipates the limb stresses; this increases the speed at which the tips move which propels arrows faster. Shapes may be optimized for various purposes, especially maximum speed of the arrow; the details are the subject of active research.

Narrow bows normally taper uniformly. However, the taper of flatbows varies. The working limbs of &quot;paddle&quot; bows maintain width for almost the entire limb length, &quot;pyramid&quot; bows taper uniformly from the handle to a narrow tip, and &quot;Holmegaard-style&quot; bows remain full width to about two-thirds of the way along the limb, then narrow sharply. &quot;Eiffel Tower&quot; bows taper sharply, but smoothly, to a very narrow outer tip.

The optimal cross-section of the bending section of a bow limb is rectangular, and almost all modern bows have such limbs. However, many, perhaps most, traditional bows have had a cross-section closer to circular, with every possible variation being used at some point. Current definitions of the traditional longbow require approximations of a D-shaped cross section.

<doc id="346329" wikidata="Q1035603" url="?curid=346329" title="Hermann and Dorothea">
<text>Hermann and Dorothea is an epic poem, an idyll, written by German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe between 1796 and 1797, and was to some extent suggested by Johann Heinrich Voss&#x27;s &quot;Luise&quot;, an idyll in hexameters, which was first published in 1782–1784. Goethe&#x27;s work is set around 1792 at the beginning of the French Revolutionary Wars, when French forces under General Custine invaded and briefly occupied parts of the Palatinate. The hexameters of the nine cantos are at times irregular.
With the poem as his source, Robert Schumann composed an overture in B minor entitled &quot;Hermann and Dorothea&quot;, his Op. 136. The overture dates from 1851.

==Summary==
Hermann, son of the wealthy innkeeper in a small town near Mainz, is sent by his mother to bring clothes and food to the refugees which have set up camp near their town. They have fled their villages on the western side of the Rhine river, now occupied by the French Revolutionary Army, in order to seek refuge on the eastern side. On his way to the camp, Hermann meets Dorothea, a young maid who assists a woman in her childbed on her flight. Overwhelmed by her courage, compassion, and beauty, Hermann asks Dorothea to distribute his donations among her poor fellow refugees.

Back home, he reveals his affection to his parents. His father brushes away his timid confession, reminding him bluntly that he wants Hermann to choose a wife from a respected local family with a generous dowry. He goes on to express his deep disappointment with Hermann&#x27;s perceived lack of ambition to move forward in life, and lectures him about how he should become a respected citizen. 

After Hermann has left in despair, his mother utters the following timelessly wise and deeply moving verses:

:&quot;Immer bist du doch, Vater, so ungerecht gegen den Sohn! und So wird am wenigsten dir dein Wunsch des Guten erfüllet. Denn wir können die Kinder nach unserem Sinne nicht formen; So wie Gott sie uns gab, so muß man sie haben und lieben, Sie erziehen aufs beste und jeglichen lassen gewähren. Denn der eine hat die, die anderen andere Gaben; Jeder braucht sie, und jeder ist doch nur auf eigene Weise Gut und glücklich.&quot;

:&quot;Why will you always, father, do our son such injustice? That least of all is the way to bring your wish to fulfillment. We have no power to fashion our children as it suits our will; As they are given by God, so we must have them and love them; teach them as best we can, and let each of them follow his nature. One will have talents of one sort, and different talents another. Every one uses his own; in his own individual fashion, each must be happy and good.&quot;

Hermann&#x27;s mother goes after her son and finally finds him in a far corner of their garden. Having been shaken to tears by his father&#x27;s harsh words, Hermann tells his mother that he intends to marry Dorothea or else to stay bachelor for the rest of his life. His mother understands the sincerity and depth of his affections and decides to help him obtain his father&#x27;s permission. They return to Hermann&#x27;s father, who still discourses with his respected neighbors, the town&#x27;s pharmacist and the young and wise parish priest. The two friends offer to collect inquiries among the refugees to find out if Dorothea is virtuous and worthy to be Hermann&#x27;s bride. Moved by his wife&#x27;s and friends&#x27; persuasion, Hermann&#x27;s father grudgingly promises that he will abide by his two friends&#x27; recommendation.

==Background and interpretation==
The story of the well-settled burgher&#x27;s son marrying a poor fugitive was contained in an account of the Salzburg Protestants who, for their religion, in 1731 fled from their old homes into Germany. The inhabitants and conditions of the little town which is the scene of &quot;Hermann and Dorothea&quot; are pictured in contrast to the turmoil of the French Revolution, for they stand for the foundations on which civilization will always rest. The leading characters represent the standard callings of men — the farmer, the merchant, the apothecary-doctor, the minister, the judge. The hero is the true son of mother earth, given to tilling the soil and harvesting his crops.

The life both in family and community is depicted as the fundamental social forms, with some hints of national life. The love story of the young couple is free from wild romance, indeed their love makes them look to the future not with any anticipation of pleasure or extravagance, but with the instinctive conviction that the true blessings of life flow from the performance of necessary tasks. The public spirit of Hermann&#x27;s father germinates also in the son&#x27;s character as his burning patriotism protests against the French invasion. But the spirit that permeates the poem as a whole is that of trust in the future and sympathy with mankind.

Ewald Eiserhardt, a reviewer for &quot;Encyclopedia Americana&quot;, cites the serene flow of presentation, the masterly descriptions of landscape and home, the plastic vigor of the main figures, the balance of color, all as rendering &quot;Hermann and Dorothea&quot; a great work of literary art.

==Schumann&#x27;s overture==

===Composition===
Schumann composed his overture &quot;Hermann und Dorothea&quot; Op. 136 in the December of 1851. He had just completed revision of what would soon be published as his fourth symphony; he began work on the overture the same day as the completion of the symphony, a practice of which he had sometime expressed disapproval, but of which he was often guilty all the same. 

In France, 1851 was the year of the coup d&#x27;état which brought Napoleon III to power; this event, just as well as the revolutionary violence in Germany, brought France, revolution and its difficult personal consequences to the front of Schumann&#x27;s mind. Schumann himself had, as an infant in 1812, borne witness to the pressure placed upon the townsfolk of Zwickau when some 200,000 fighting men of the Grande Armée passed through on their way to eventual defeat in Russia; following the defeat many soldiers returned to Zwickau and other such central European towns in order to extract provisions from their inhabitants. This was the cause of considerable economic hardship, but also of more direct suffering from violence at the hands of a large body of foreign soldiers.

Originally Schumann had considered &quot;Hermann und Dorothea&quot; an apt text for adaptation into a libretto; his fourth symphony had at first been named for his wife Clara, and during work on the revision he was moved to express his devotion to her in a new composition. &quot;Hermann und Dorothea&quot;, with its themes of love against the odds, personal struggle, and familial opposition to marriage, was a natural subject; and Schumann saw in its strong-willed hero and idealised heroine neat ciphers for himself and Clara. Eventually Schumann decided against an opera; the fairly poor reception of his &quot;Genoveva&quot;, which had had its premiere the previous year, might have stayed his eagerness. The overture which he settled upon was completed in two days&#x27; work; it was dedicated to &quot;Seiner lieben Clara&quot;.

===Music===
The overture is scored for piccolo, two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets in A, two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, side drum, and strings with contrabass. It is in common time, though Schumann uses triplets freely in many parts to suggest a time of twelve; it has B minor as its principal key. It is marked &quot;Mäßig&quot; and given a metronome tempo of .

There is some structural departure from the model which Beethoven provided in his overture from &quot;Egmont&quot;, itself incidental music for a play by Goethe, and in his &quot;Coriolan&quot;, also based upon a celebrated work of literature. Schumann does not use sonata form, as in the Egmont overture, and as in Schumann&#x27;s &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, composed at the beginning of the same year; nor does he crib directly from the structure of the poem which was his source, as in Coriolan. Instead the overture is dominated by thematic writing, and melodies introduced early on reoccur freely in many keys, often transformed by inversion, augmentation, fragmentation, recombination, or other devices.
The overture&#x27;s principal theme, shown here, is alternated with extracts from the Marseillaise, and with a brighter second subject for contrast. The dour mood which the first theme evokes associates it by Hermann; the second theme&#x27;s major key and lyricism associate it by Dorothea. The themes are combined throughout the work, and are developed later in the overture; in moments of urgency or great passion they are often joined together contrapuntally. The piece ends with a parallel-major coda in B.

The overture has been arranged several times for four hands, notably by August Horn.

<text>Detached Battalion 4 ( ()) was a special forces unit of the Finnish Army during the Continuation War and Lapland War, serving from July 1943 to November 1944. The battalion was founded under the Intelligence Division of Defence Command from the already operational long-range reconnaissance patrol detachments () created during the Interim Peace.

== History ==
Long-range reconnaissance patrols (LRRP) were not used during the Winter War of 1939–1940. Immediately after the war ended, training was commenced to create patrol detachments for peacetime intelligence and prepare for a possible war. Most of the recruits were veterans from the Winter War; some were refugees from East Karelia and Ingria. Around 150 soldiers were trained and equipped before the Continuation War started on 25 June 1941. Four detachments were mobilized and tasked with missions to destroy enemy personnel and material assets, disrupt supply and communication lines as well as to interrogate prisoners and develop special forces tactics. At first, the detachments comprised only as few as 14 soldiers, but as the war progressed, their ranks were increased up to 40–60 men.

On 1 July 1943, the units were reorganised as companies of Detached Battalion 4 since direct command of the patrols became too consuming for the Intelligence Division. On 23 June 1944, a special operations aviation unit with amphibious Heinkel He 115 transport planes was established to support the battalion with insertions and extractions. Around 350 LRRPs were conducted during the wars. A total of over 650 soldiers served in the patrols during wartime and 90 died or went missing, including 2 from the Lotta Svärd female auxiliaries. The unit played a significant role during the Battle of Ilomantsi disrupting Soviet supply lines. The battalion was demobilized on 30 November 1944 when the Lapland War came to an effective end. The modern Utti Jaeger Regiment was established in Detached Battalion 4&#x27;s footsteps.

== Organisation ==
The operative units of the battalion were created during the Interim Peace and named after their commanders. They were reformed as companies within Detached Battalion 4 in July 1943:
* 1st Company / Detachment Vehniäinen, base of operations in Viipuri
* 2nd Company / Detachment Kuismanen, base of operations in Joensuu
* 3rd Company / Detachment Marttina, base of operations in Kajaani
* 4th Company / Detachment Paatsalo, base of operations in Rovaniemi
* Flight Detachment (or Detachment Jauri), base of operations in Mikkeli – founded 23 June 1944
* Training Center – founded 1 July 1944

<text>The Wasatch Range ( ) or Wasatch Mountains is a mountain range in the western United States that runs about from the Utah-Idaho border south to central Utah. It is the western edge of the greater Rocky Mountains, and the eastern edge of the Great Basin region. The northern extension of the Wasatch Range, the Bear River Mountains, extends just into Idaho, constituting all of the Wasatch Range in that state.

In the language of the native Ute people, Wasatch means &quot;mountain pass&quot; or &quot;low pass over high range.&quot; According to William Bright, the mountains were named for a Shoshoni leader who was named with the Shoshoni term &quot;wasattsi&quot;, meaning &quot;blue heron&quot;. In 1926, Cecil Alter quoted Henry Gannett from 1902, who said that the word meant &quot;land of many waters,&quot; then posited, &quot;the word is a common one among the Shoshones, and is given to a berry basket&quot; carried by women.

==Overview==

Since the earliest days of European settlement, most of Utah&#x27;s population has chosen to settle along the range&#x27;s western front, where numerous rivers exit the mountains. For early settlers, the mountains were a vital source of water, timber, and granite. Today, 85% of Utah&#x27;s population lives within of the Wasatch Range, mainly in the valleys just to the west. This westside concentration is known as the Wasatch Front and has a population of well over 2 million. Salt Lake City lies between the Wasatch Range and the Great Salt Lake.
The range&#x27;s highest point — — is Mount Nebo, a triple peak rising above Nephi, at the southern end of the range. In some places the mountains rise steeply from the valley&#x27;s base elevation of to over . Other notable peaks include Mount Timpanogos, a massive peak that looms over northern Utah County and is especially prominent from Pleasant Grove and Orem; Lone Peak, the Twin Peaks, and Mount Olympus, which overlooks the Salt Lake Valley; Francis Peak overlooking both Morgan and Davis counties; and Ben Lomond and Mount Ogden, both towering over Ogden.
Topping out below , Wasatch peaks are not especially high compared to the Rocky Mountains of Colorado or even the Uinta Mountains (the other main portion of the Rocky Mountains in Utah). However, they are sculpted by glaciers, yielding notably rugged, sweeping upland scenery. They also receive heavy snowfall: more than per year in some places. This great snowfall, with its runoff, made possible a prosperous urban strip of some 25 cities along nearly of mountain frontage. The Wasatch Range is home to a high concentration of ski areas, with 11 stretching from Sundance in northeastern Utah County to Powder Mountain and Nordic Valley Ski Area northeast of Ogden. There are also two ski resorts in the Bear River Mountains (Beaver Mountain and Cherry Peak Resort). Park City alone is bordered by two ski resorts. Due to the low relative humidity in wintertime, along with the added lake-effect from the Great Salt Lake, the snow has a dry, powdery texture which most of the local ski resorts market as &quot;the Greatest Snow on Earth&quot;. The snow and nearby ski resorts helped Salt Lake City gain the right to host the 2002 Winter Olympics.

Several of the canyons in the Lone Peak area, most notably Little Cottonwood Canyon, have several high-quality granite outcroppings, and make up a popular climbing area such as the Pfeifferhorn. Farther north, Big Cottonwood Canyon features tricky climbing on quartzite.

The densely vegetated narrow canyons of the Wasatch Range, such as Big Cottonwood Canyon and Little Cottonwood Canyon, are heavily visited; on 25 September 2005, 1,200 automobiles entered Little Cottonwood in an hour. The canyons sit within of downtown Salt Lake City and the year-round paved roadways can reach higher in elevation above the city within a short distance. Dirt roads readily drivable in passenger cars with moderate clearance stretch up from Park City, Heber, and Big Cottonwood Canyon. These reach about above sea level and provide long-range high country views.

==Geography and geology==

The Wasatch Range&#x27;s origins are rooted in the Sevier Orogeny. As the Farallon plate subducted under the North American plate between the Jurassic and Paleogene, the regional stress regime became a maximum striking east to west. This horizontal compression caused thin skinned imbricated thrust faults resulting in as much as 50% crustal shortening of the western North American Plate. The Wasatch anticlinorium represented the furthest eastern margins of these Sevier origin imbricated thrusts. Once the Farallon plate had largely subducted, the NW moving Pacific plate latched onto the North American Plate, causing a change in regional stress. Sevier thrust ramps were reactivated into normal faults, causing crustal extension as the Pacific plate drags the western margins of the North American plate to the NW. The current Wasatch range continues to grow via normal faults as the valley drops in periodic motion. Mount Nebo, the highest peak of the Wasatch, is at the southern edge of the range. The Colorado Plateau comes to its northwest corner as it meets the southern end of the Rocky Mountains. Immediately west of these two, the Great Basin, which is the northern region of the Basin and Range Province, begins and stretches westward across western Utah and Nevada until it reaches the Sierra Nevada near the Nevada/California border. Geologic faults punctuate the range, chief among them the Wasatch Fault. These faults also formed the Timpanogos Cave.

A series of mountain valleys punctuate the northern Wasatch Range. While the western side of the range drops sharply to the floors of the Wasatch Front valleys, the eastern side of the range is gentler, allowing for the construction of several ski resorts. The Cottonwoods, a particularly rugged and dense area just east of the Salt Lake Valley, shelters small mountain coves that harbor four world-famous ski resorts (Alta, Brighton, Solitude, and Snowbird). The eastern slopes of the Cottonwoods drop to the Snyderville Basin, which contains Park City and its two ski resorts (Park City Mountain Resort and Deer Valley). Much of the eastern side of the range, from north of Salt Lake City to the Bear River Mountains, is especially gentle compared to the rest of the range. The range widens east of Ogden, sheltering a high mountain valley known as the Ogden Valley. Three more ski resorts lie here, as well as several small towns (such as Huntsville, Liberty, and Eden).
North of this, the Wellsville Mountains branch off from the northwest of the range, continuing a line of mountains paralleling the I-15 corridor. This range is exceptionally thin and steep. However, US-89/US-91 is maintained as a four-lane highway through the range at Wellsville Canyon east of Brigham City. Cache Valley, created by the Bear River, is flanked on the west by the Wellsville Mountains and on the east by the much denser and higher Bear River Mountains. The northwestern border of Cache Valley is flanked by the Bannock Range in Idaho. The two highest peaks in this area are Mount Naomi and Mount Logan, each just under .
The southeastern portion of the range across Wasatch County transforms into the relatively flat, windswept Wasatch Plateau at an elevation of about to . At its southeastern edge, just north of Helper, it runs into the Book Cliffs. Further north, the Heber Valley and Weber River Valley separate the Wasatch Range from the Uinta Mountains, while the Bear River Valley and Bear Lake Valley separate it from lower mountain ranges that mark the western edge of the Green River Basin.

The Wasatch Range is traversed by just seven highways, along with several rugged mountain roads and unpaved trails. The most prominent are I-80 through Parley&#x27;s Canyon east of Salt Lake City and I-84 through Weber Canyon southeast of Ogden. They meet near the ghost town of Echo on the eastern slopes of the range and continue northeast as I‑80. Other highways through the range include US-6/US-89 through Spanish Fork Canyon, US-189 through Provo Canyon, Utah State Route 39 extending east from Huntsville (a route which is closed in winter), US‑89/US-91 through Logan Canyon, and along Idaho State Highway 36 near the northern end of the range.

The Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad had a line through the Wasatch Range via Soldier Summit Pass and Spanish Fork Canyon. Now operated by the Union Pacific Railroad, the line is used by freight trains and Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;California Zephyr&quot;.

==Ecology==
The Wasatch Range is part of the Wasatch and Uinta Mountains Level 3 Ecoregion, a temperate coniferous forest. Common trees include Douglas fir (&quot;Pseudotsuga menziesii&quot;), subalpine fir (&quot;Abies bifolia&quot;), Engelmann spruce (&quot;Picea engelmannii&quot;), Colorado blue spruce (&quot;Picea pungens&quot;), and quaking aspen (&quot;Populus tremuloides&quot;). Gambel oak (&quot;Quercus gambelii&quot;) is common on the foothills of the range from just south of Brigham City in the north, to the southern extension of the Wasatch Range. It is not found in the northern portion of the Range. Ponderosa pine (&quot;Pinus ponderosa&quot;), while abundant elsewhere in Utah is not common in this mountain range, except in plantations in Big Cottonwood Canyon southeast of Salt Lake City and in Logan Canyon, east of Logan. Some individual trees have been found in remote areas of the Wasatch Range that appear to be relic individuals from past populations.

Subspecies of big sagebrush (&quot;Artemisia tridentata&quot;) dominate drier portions of the landscapes. Most of the sagebrush that occurs in the Wasatch Range is mountain big sagebrush (&quot;Artemisia tridentata ssp. vaseyana&quot;). Many of the valley bottoms at one time were occupied by basin big sagebrush (&quot;Artemisia tridentata ssp. tridentata&quot;). Most of this subspecies has been removed, however, because it occurred on what constitutes prime agricultural lands. In upper elevations, and on slightly more mesic sites than that of mountain big sagebrush, one can find subalpine big sagebrush (&quot;Artemisia tridenta ssp. spiciformis&quot;). This subspecies occupies productive sites and often has a lush understory of wildflowers and grasses. Wyoming big sagebrush (&quot;Artemisia tridentata ssp. wyomingensis&quot;) occurs at the lowest and driest elevations, although much of the Wasatch Range is above the elevation where this subspecies occurs. All sagebrush species, combined, provide critical habitat to greater sage grouse, a species under consideration for listing by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.

The Wasatch Range is home to several plants that occur nowhere other than in this area. Several of these are rare and restricted to narrow geological formations, while others are more widely distributed throughout the area. Some of the less rare endemics include five-petal cliffbush (&quot;Jamesia americana&quot; var. &quot;macrocalyx&quot;), Sierra fumewort (&quot;Corydalis caseana&quot; ssp. &quot;brachycarpa&quot;), and Utah angelica (&quot;Angelica wheeleri&quot;).

==Recreation==

In addition to ski resorts, there are hundreds of miles of mountain biking and hiking trails winding through the canyons and alpine valleys of the Wasatch Range. These offer backcountry access close to a large metropolitan area. There is rock climbing and mountaineering on the towering limestone, granite, and quartzite peaks and in many of the surrounding canyons.

Winter recreation includes ski touring, ski mountaineering, and snowshoeing.

Alpine lakes and streams offer somewhat overworked fishing opportunities. The Wasatch Mountain Club has regular activities. The Utah Native Plant Society conducts regular walks from spring until fall along the foothills of the central Wasatch Front and in adjoining canyons as the season progresses. Many wildflowers bloom in the late summer in Albion Basin at the top of Little Cottonwood Canyon.

<doc id="346339" wikidata="Q3968414" url="?curid=346339" title="Starship Troopers (board wargame)">
<text>Starship Troopers is a board wargame by Avalon Hill based on the 1959 novel of the same name by Robert A. Heinlein. It was originally released in 1976 and designed by Randall C. Reed. Twenty years later, Avalon Hill redesigned and re-released a &quot;movie&quot; version (entitled &quot;Starship Troopers: Prepare for Battle!&quot;) in 1997 to coincide with the movie&#x27;s release.

The game is a hexagon-based wargame for two players. The player who takes the side of Arachnids has a sheet of paper with a copy of the map-board on which he plots out his bug-hive and tunnel system. The Mobile Infantry player sends in his soldiers and tries to dig them out. A third faction, the Skinnies, starts out playing on the bug side, but switches to the human side during later scenarios.

==Publication==
The game was designed by Randall C. Reed who was the head of The Avalon Hill research and development staff in the late 1970s, and was one of the first new Avalon Hill employees after the Charles S. Roberts era. He later left Avalon Hill to work with wargames for the U.S. Marine Corps.

==Scenarios==
The game is set up as a series of seven scenarios that recreate the battles described in the novel; the first scenario uses the basic rules, and then each succeeding scenario adds a new layer of rules, gradually increasing the complexity of the game as players advance through the scenarios:

*&quot;Feint against the humanoids&quot;: A single squad of Rasczak&#x27;s Roughnecks hits a Skinny colony.
*&quot;Operation Bughouse&quot;: A complete platoon takes on an Arachnid hive.
*&quot;Invasion of Skinny-5&quot;: A platoon&#x27;s attack on a Skinny industrial center.
*&quot;Revolt!&quot;: The Skinnies change sides and attack the Arachnids with the help of the Mobile Infantry.
*&quot;Sheol&quot; (two parts)
**&quot;Operation Corkscrew&quot;: The combat engineers enter the battle 
**&quot;Retreat and Evacuation&quot;: A group of wounded M.I. are rescued.
*&quot;Operation Royalty&quot;: A reinforced platoon takes on two Arachnids complexes to capture a Brain Bug.
*&quot;Klendathu&quot;: Two platoons vs. two Arachnids complexes in a fight to free human prisoners of war.

==Reception==
In Issue 11 of &quot;Perfidious Albion&quot;, Geoff Barnard and Charles Vasey exchanged thoughts about the game. Barnard commented, &quot;This game is remarkably close to the book, and is a splendid compliment to Heinlein to the extent that his ideas can be portrayed in sufficient detail to make such a game as &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; ... The game contains considerable hidden movement for the alien player, and the manner in which the Bug underground hive complexes-cum-fortresses are represented is very well done indeed.&quot; Vasey replied, &quot;Reminiscent of Vietnam War games: One player is all powerful, the other is well hidden ... Though tense, the constant element of surprise makes this a light-hearted and amusing game.&quot; Barnard concluded, &quot;In all the scenarios, the two sides seem well balanced even though the weapons and abilities are quite different. A splendid tactical game.&quot; Vasey concluded, &quot;You really feel like you are handling the Marines and when the Bugs swarm out with their decoy workers you get a sense of the whole book. Splendid.&quot;

In his 1977 book &quot;The Comprehensive Guide to Board Wargaming&quot;, Nicholas Palmer commented that this game &quot;should please anyone who enjoyed the book; others can enjoy it but may be a bit bewildered at times!&quot; He concluded, &quot;The tactical problems are excellently done and true to the book.&quot;

In the August–September 1976 edition of &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; (Issue No. 7), Todd Roseman felt that the game &quot;faithfully recreates the heroic battles of the Terran Mobile Infantry as described in the classic Robert Heinlein novel&quot; and concluded that &quot;for those people who read &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; and said to themselves, &#x27;I know there&#x27;s a great game in there somewhere&#x27;, go out and get a copy of SST... on the bounce!&quot; In the next issue of &quot;The Space Gamer&quot;, Sumner N. Clarren recommended &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;, saying &quot;The game is truly tactical in scale and in flavor.&quot; and that &quot;&quot;Starship Troopers&quot; is a fine tactical science fiction board game from Avalon Hill.&quot;

In 1977, in the inaugural edition of White Dwarf, Martin Easterbrook gave the game an overall rating of 9 out of 10, saying, &quot;All in all this is probably the best SF game currently on the market because it has the well worked out background of Heinlein&#x27;s novel and because it is an extrapolation of current military technology, allowing Avalon Hill to use their experience in game design&quot;

In 1980, in the inaugural edition of &quot;Ares Magazine&quot;, Eric Goldberg gave &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; a rating of 5 out of 9, citing the limited replay value of the game. &quot;&quot;The play of the game will prove interesting for the first few times, but then the simulation value of the game will be exhausted - this cannot stand on its own as a game.&quot;

In the April 1980 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot;, Michael Crane liked the game components, which he said were up to Avalon Hill&#x27;s usual high standards, although he didn&#x27;t enjoy the colors used on the board game, which he called &quot;enough to make the stomach churn.&quot; But he thought the rule book was well thought out, and concluded that &quot;the game does provide a general &#x27;feel&#x27; for the novel&quot;. Crane concluded by recommending the game, calling it &quot;an excellent buy&quot;.

In the 1980 book &quot;The Complete Book of Wargames&quot;, game designer Jon Freeman commented that this game &quot;provides a refreshingly different environment in which to maneuver a fairly standard array of units.&quot; Freeman noted &quot;If the game has a fault, it may be that it&#x27;s &quot;too&quot; conventional — it&#x27;s &quot;PanzerBlitz&quot; in spacesuits.&quot; He gave this game an Overall Evaluation of &quot;Very Good&quot;, concluding, &quot;the action is fast and furious, and the game is exciting as any on the market.&quot;

<doc id="346349" wikidata="Q869598" url="?curid=346349" title="Multiple buffering">
<text>In computer science, multiple buffering is the use of more than one buffer to hold a block of data, so that a &quot;reader&quot; will see a complete (though perhaps old) version of the data instead of a partially updated version of the data being created by a &quot;writer&quot;. It is very commonly used for computer display images. It is also used to avoid the need to use dual-ported RAM (DPRAM) when the readers and writers are different devices.

== Description ==
=== Double buffering Petri net ===
The Petri net in the illustration shows double buffering. Transitions W1 and W2 represent writing to buffer 1 and 2 respectively while R1 and R2 represent reading from buffer 1 and 2 respectively. At the beginning, only the transition W1 is enabled. After W1 fires, R1 and W2 are both enabled and can proceed in parallel. When they finish, R2 and W1 proceed in parallel and so on.

After the initial transient where W1 fires alone, this system is periodic and the transitions are enabled – always in pairs (R1 with W2 and R2 with W1 respectively).

== Double buffering in computer graphics ==

In computer graphics, double buffering is a technique for drawing graphics that shows less stutter, tearing, and other artifacts.

It is difficult for a program to draw a display so that pixels do not change more than once. For instance, when updating a page of text, it is much easier to clear the entire page and then draw the letters than to somehow erase only the pixels that are used in old letters but not in new ones. However, this intermediate image is seen by the user as flickering. In addition, computer monitors constantly redraw the visible video page (traditionally at around 60 times a second), so even a perfect update may be visible momentarily as a horizontal divider between the &quot;new&quot; image and the un-redrawn &quot;old&quot; image, known as tearing.

=== Software double buffering ===
A software implementation of double buffering has all drawing operations store their results in some region of system RAM; any such region is often called a &quot;back buffer&quot;. When all drawing operations are considered complete, the whole region (or only the changed portion) is copied into the video RAM (the &quot;front buffer&quot;); this copying is usually synchronized with the monitor&#x27;s raster beam in order to avoid tearing. Software implementations of double buffering necessarily require more memory and CPU time than single buffering because of the system memory allocated for the back buffer, the time for the copy operation, and the time waiting for synchronization.

Compositing window managers often combine the &quot;copying&quot; operation with &quot;compositing&quot; used to position windows, transform them with scale or warping effects, and make portions transparent. Thus, the &quot;front buffer&quot; may contain only the composite image seen on the screen, while there is a different &quot;back buffer&quot; for every window containing the non-composited image of the entire window contents.

=== Page flipping ===
In the page-flip method, instead of copying the data, both buffers are capable of being displayed. At any one time, one buffer is actively being displayed by the monitor, while the other, background buffer is being drawn. When the background buffer is complete, the roles of the two are switched. The page-flip is typically accomplished by modifying a hardware register in the video display controller—the value of a pointer to the beginning of the display data in the video memory.

The page-flip is much faster than copying the data and can guarantee that tearing will not be seen as long as the pages are switched over during the monitor&#x27;s vertical blanking interval—the blank period when no video data is being drawn. The currently active and visible buffer is called the front buffer, while the background page is called the back buffer.

== Triple buffering ==
In computer graphics, triple buffering is similar to double buffering but can provide improved performance. In double buffering, the program must wait until the finished drawing is copied or swapped before starting the next drawing. This waiting period could be several milliseconds during which neither buffer can be touched.

In triple buffering, the program has two back buffers and can immediately start drawing in the one that is not involved in such copying. The third buffer, the front buffer, is read by the graphics card to display the image on the monitor. Once the image has been sent to the monitor, the front buffer is flipped with (or copied from) the back buffer holding the most recent complete image. Since one of the back buffers is always complete, the graphics card never has to wait for the software to complete. Consequently, the software and the graphics card are completely independent and can run at their own pace. Finally, the displayed image was started without waiting for synchronization and thus with minimum lag.

Due to the software algorithm not polling the graphics hardware for monitor refresh events, the algorithm may continuously draw additional frames as fast as the hardware can render them. For frames that are completed much faster than interval between refreshes, it is possible to replace a back buffers&#x27; frames with newer iterations multiple times before copying. This means frames may be written to the back buffer that are never used at all before being overwritten by successive frames. Nvidia has implemented this method under the name &quot;Fast Sync&quot;.

An alternative method sometimes referred to as triple buffering is a swap chain three buffers long. After the program has drawn both back buffers, it waits until the first one is placed on the screen, before drawing another back buffer (i.e. it is a 3-long first in, first out queue). Most Windows games seem to refer to this method when enabling triple buffering.

== Quad buffering ==
The term quad buffering is the use of double buffering for each of the left and right eye images in stereoscopic implementations, thus four buffers total (if triple buffering was used then there would be &quot;six&quot; buffers). The command to swap or copy the buffer typically applies to both pairs at once, so at no time does one eye see an older image than the other eye.

Quad buffering requires special support in the graphics card drivers which is disabled for most consumer cards. AMD&#x27;s Radeon HD 6000 Series and newer support it.

3D standards like OpenGL and Direct3D support quad buffering.

== Double buffering for DMA ==
The term double buffering is used for copying data between two buffers for direct memory access (DMA) transfers, not for enhancing performance, but to meet specific addressing requirements of a device (esp. 32-bit devices on systems with wider addressing provided via Physical Address Extension). DOS and Windows device drivers are a place where the term &quot;double buffering&quot; is likely to be used. Linux and BSD source code calls these &quot;bounce buffers&quot;.

Some programmers try to avoid this kind of double buffering with zero-copy techniques.

== Other uses ==
Double buffering is also used as a technique to facilitate interlacing or deinterlacing of video signals.

<doc id="346350" wikidata="Q540498" url="?curid=346350" title="Earl Monroe">
<text>Vernon Earl Monroe (born November 21, 1944) is an American former professional basketball player. He played for two teams, the Baltimore Bullets and the New York Knicks, during his career in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Both teams have retired Monroe&#x27;s number. Due to his on-court success and flashy style of play, Monroe was given the nicknames &quot;Black Jesus&quot; and &quot;Earl the Pearl&quot;. Monroe was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1990 and the International Sports Hall of Fame in 2013. In 1996, Monroe was named as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History, and in 2021, Monroe was named as one of the 75 greatest players in NBA history.

==Early life==
Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Monroe was a playground legend from an early age. His high school teammates at John Bartram High School called him &quot;Thomas Edison&quot; because of the many moves he invented.

Growing up in his South Philadelphia neighborhood, Monroe was initially interested in soccer and baseball more than basketball. By age 14, Monroe was 6&#x27;3&quot; and his interest in basketball grew, playing center during most of his youth. Some of his &quot;shake-and-bake&quot; style moves originated while playing on the asphalt playgrounds. &quot;I had to develop flukey-duke shots, what we call la-la, hesitating in the air as long as possible before shooting,&quot; Monroe said. As he was developing as a teenage player, other players would razz him. His mother gave Earl a blue notebook and told him to write down the names of those players. &quot;As you get better than them,&quot; Monroe said his mother instructed, &quot;I want you to scratch those names out.&quot;

After graduating from John Bartram High School, Monroe attended a college preparatory school affiliated with Temple University. He worked as a shipping clerk in a factory, while frequently playing basketball at Leon Whitley&#x27;s recreation center in Philadelphia. Whitley had played at Winston-Salem Teacher College on their 1953 championship team and encouraged Monroe to attend Winston-Salem to play for coach Clarence &quot;Big House&quot; Gaines.

==College career==
Monroe rose to prominence at a national level at then-Division II Winston-Salem State University, located in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Under Hall of Fame Coach Gaines, Monroe averaged 7.1 points his freshman year and Monroe tells a story of when he wanted to return to Philadelphia as a freshman. Coach Gaines called Monroe&#x27;s mother and after a stern talk, Monroe stayed in college.

Monroe then averaged 23.2 points as a sophomore, 29.8 points as a junior and 41.5 points his senior year (1,329 points in that 1966–1967 season). During that 1966–1967 season, Jerry McLeese, a sportswriter for the &quot;Winston-Salem Journal&quot;, called Monroe&#x27;s points &quot;Earl&#x27;s pearls&quot;. Soon after, fans began to chant &quot;Earl, the Super Pearl,&quot; and the nickname was born.

In 1967, Monroe earned NCAA College Division Player of the Year honors, leading the Rams to the 1967 NCAA College Division Championship with a 77–74 victory over SW Missouri State in the Final.

Overall, in his four years at Winston-Salem State University, Monroe averaged 26.7 points, with 2,395 total points in 110 games. He remains the leading scorer in Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association basketball history.

After he finished his collegiate career, Monroe graduated from Winston-Salem and passed the national teaching exam. Monroe was not selected to the 1967 USA Basketball Team to represent the country at the 1967 Pan-American Games after trying out. The 40-person committee failed to select both Monroe and fellow future Hall of Fame player Elvin Hayes. Monroe has said that USA coaches said his style of play was &quot;too street, too playground, too black&quot; adding, &quot;It has always left a very, very bad taste in my mouth.&quot;

==NBA career==

===Baltimore Bullets (1967–1971)===
In 1967, the two-time All-American was drafted number two overall by the Baltimore Bullets (now the Washington Wizards) in the first round of the 1967 NBA draft, behind Jimmy Walker, who was selected by the Detroit Pistons. Monroe then won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award in a season in which he averaged 24.3 points per game. He scored 56 points in a game against the Los Angeles Lakers, the third-highest rookie total in NBA history. It was also a franchise record, later broken by Gilbert Arenas on December 17, 2006.

Monroe and his teammate, future Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame inductee Wes Unseld, quickly became a formidable combination in Baltimore, and Monroe became a cult hero for his ability to run the fast break and for his circus-like shots. He said, &quot;The thing is, I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m going to do with the ball, and if I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;m quite sure the guy guarding me doesn&#x27;t know either.&quot; On February 6, 1970, he set an NBA record with 13 points in one overtime in a double-overtime victory over the Detroit Pistons (another mark since surpassed by Arenas).

In 1968–1969, Monroe averaged 25.8 points, 4.5 assists and 3.9 rebounds, as the Bullets finished 57–25 under coach Gene Shue, capturing the Eastern Division title. However, the Bullets were swept by the New York Knicks 4–0 in the playoffs after receiving a bye.

The Bullets finished 50–32 in 1969–1970, as Monroe averaged 23.4 points, 4.9 assists and 3.1 rebounds, but did not make the NBA All-Star team. Oscar Robertson, Walt &quot;Clyde&quot; Frazier, Tom Van Arsdale, Hal Greer, and Flynn Robinson were the guards selected. The Bullets were again beaten by the Knicks 4–3 in the playoffs.

In 1970–1971, the Bullets finished 42–40 under Coach Shue and captured the Central Division title. Monroe averaged 21.4 points, 4.4 assists and 2.6 rebounds. In the Eastern Conference playoffs, the Bullets defeated the Philadelphia 76ers 4–3, and then defeated the Knicks 4–3 in the Eastern Conference Finals to reach the 1971 NBA Finals. Monroe averaged 23.0 points, 4.0 assists and 3.4 rebounds in the Philadelphia series. He then averaged 24.4 points, 4.3 assists and 3.4 rebounds against the Knicks, including 26 points, 6 assists and 5 rebounds in the 93–91 Bullets&#x27; Game 7 victory.

In the 1971 NBA Finals, the Bullets were matched against the Milwaukee Bucks with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Oscar Robertson and Bobby Dandridge. The Bucks swept the Bullets 4–0. Monroe averaged 16.3 points, 4.0 assists and 4.0 rebounds in the series.

&quot;Put a basketball in his hands and he does wondrous things with it,&quot; Bullets Coach Gene Shue said of Monroe. &quot;He has the greatest combination of basketball ability and showmanship.&quot;

In 328 games with the Bullets, Monroe averaged 23.7 points, 4.6 assists and 3.7 rebounds.

===New York Knicks (1971–1980)===
After the 1970–1971 season, Monroe&#x27;s agent Larry Fleisher informed the Bullets of Monroe&#x27;s wishes to be traded to the Lakers, Chicago Bulls or his hometown Philadelphia 76ers. After four games into the 1971–1972 season, he traveled to Indianapolis to discuss a transfer to the American Basketball Association&#x27;s Indiana Pacers. He had begun the campaign without having signed a contract due to a salary dispute with Bullets management. When his trade request turned into an ultimatum, he was suspended by the team on October 22. He eventually signed a contract immediately after being sent from the Bullets to the New York Knicks for Mike Riordan, Dave Stallworth and an undisclosed amount of cash twenty days later on November 11, 1971.

Upon his arrival with the Knicks, Monroe formed what was known as the &quot;Rolls-Royce backcourt&quot; with the equally flamboyant Walt Frazier. While there were initial questions as to whether Monroe and Frazier could coexist as teammates, the duo eventually meshed to become one of the most effective guard combinations of all time.

In 1971–1972, Monroe averaged 21.7 points in his three games with the Bullets before the trade and he struggled to adjust after the trade, averaging 11.4 points, 2.2 assists and 1.5 rebounds in 60 games with the Knicks. However, the Knicks defeated the Bullets 4–2 and the Boston Celtics 4–1 to reach the 1972 NBA Finals. Monroe averaged 15.8 points and 3.3 assists in the Bullets&#x27; series against his former teammates. In the Celtics series he averaged 13.6 points and 3.8 assists.

In the 1972 NBA Finals, the Knicks were defeated by the Los Angeles Lakers with Jerry West and Wilt Chamberlain 4–1, losing four straight after winning Game 1. Monroe averaged 6.8 points and 2.6 assists in the series.

In 1972–1973, Frazier and Monroe led the Knicks, under future Hall of Fame Coach Red Holtzman to the 1973 NBA Championship, along with future Hall of Fame teammates Bill Bradley, Jerry Lucas and Willis Reed, Dave DeBusschere and Phil Jackson.

After a 57–25 regular season, in which Monroe averaged 15.5 points, 3.8 assists and 2.6 rebounds, his role on the team was defined. The Knicks then defeated the Bullets 4–1 and the Celtics 4–3 to reach the 1973 NBA Finals. The Knicks had a rematch against the Los Angeles Lakers in the finals. The Knicks won the championship, four games to one, with Monroe averaging 16.0 points and 4.2 assists. Bradley averaged 18.6, Frazier 16.6, Reed 16.4 and DeBusschere 15.6 points to illustrate the Knicks&#x27; team play.

In 1973–1974, the Knicks, after defeating the Bullets, were defeated by the eventual NBA Champion Celtics in the Eastern Conference Finals. Monroe averaged 14.0 points and 2.7 assists with 3.0 rebounds in the regular season.

In the next four seasons, Monroe averaged 20.9 points, 20.7 points, 19.9 points and 17.8 points, before injures limited him in games and minutes during his final two seasons.

The Monroe-Frazier pairing is one of few backcourts ever to feature two Hall of Famers and NBA 50th Anniversary Team members. A four-time NBA All-Star, Monroe retired after the 1980 season due to serious knee injuries, which had plagued him throughout his career. In nine seasons and 592 games with the Knicks, Monroe averaged 16.2 points, 3.5 assists and 2.6 rebounds.

Overall, Monroe played in 926 regular season NBA games, scoring 17,454 total points with 3,594 assists on 46% shooting. He averaged 18.8 points, 3.9 assists and 3.0 rebounds in his career. He scored over 1,000 points in nine of his thirteen professional seasons (1968–71, 1973, 1975–78) including a career-high 2,065 (25.8 points per game) in the 1968–69 season.

In 2021, to commemorate the NBA&#x27;s 75th Anniversary &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Monroe as the 58th greatest player in NBA history.

Of his unique, flowing, fluid, silky-smooth on-court style of play, Monroe has said: &quot;You know, I watch the games and even now I never see anyone who reminds me of me, the way I played.&quot; &quot;The ultimate playground player,&quot; is how Bill Bradley once described Monroe.

&quot;If for any reason someone were to remember me,&quot; Monroe said, &quot;I hope they will remember me as a person who could play the game and excite the fans and excite himself.&quot;

<doc id="346360" wikidata="Q155518" url="?curid=346360" title="Cuckoo clock">
<text>A cuckoo clock is a type of clock, not typically pendulum driven, that strikes the hours with a sound like a common cuckoo call and has an automated cuckoo bird that moves with each note. Some move their wings and open and close their beaks while leaning forwards, whereas others have only the bird&#x27;s body leaning forward. The mechanism to produce the cuckoo call has been in use since the middle of the 18th century and has remained almost without variation.

It is unknown who invented the cuckoo clock and where the first one was made. It is thought that much of its development and evolution was made in the Black Forest area in southwestern Germany (in the modern state of Baden-Württemberg), the region where the cuckoo clock was popularized and from where it was exported to the rest of the world, becoming world-famous from the mid-1850s on. Today, the cuckoo clock is one of the favourite souvenirs of travellers in Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Eastern France. It has become a cultural icon of Germany.

==Characteristics==


The design of a cuckoo clock is now conventional. Many are made in the &quot;traditional style&quot;, which are made to hang on a wall. The classical or traditional type includes two subgroups; the carved ones, whose wooden cases are decorated with leaves, animals, etc., and a second one with cases in the shape of a chalet. They have an automaton of a bird that appears through a small trap door when the clock strikes. The cuckoo bird is activated by the clock movement as the clock strikes by means of an arm that is triggered on the hour and half hour.

There are two kinds of movements: one-day (30-hour) and eight-day clockworks. Some have musical devices, and play a tune on a Swiss music box after striking the hours and half-hours. Usually the melody sounds only at full hours in eight-day clocks and both at full and half hours in the one-day timepieces. Musical cuckoo clocks frequently have other automata which move when the music box plays. Today&#x27;s cuckoo clocks are almost always weight driven. The weights are made of cast iron usually in a pine cone shape and the &quot;cuckoo&quot; sound is created by two tiny gedackt pipes in the clock, with bellows attached to their tops. The clock&#x27;s movement activates the bellows to send a puff of air into each pipe alternately when the timekeeper strikes.

Since the 1970s, quartz battery-powered cuckoo clocks have become available. As with their mechanical counterparts, the cuckoo bird emerges from its enclosure and moves up and down, but often on the quartz timepieces it also flaps its wings and open its beak while it sings. Just before the call, and in case it has a door, the single or double door opens and the bird emerges as usual, but only on the full hour, and they do not have a gong wire chime. The movement of the cuckoo in such clocks is regulated by an electromagnet that pulses on and off, attracting a weight, that acts as a fulcrum, connected to the tail of the plastic cuckoo, thus moving the bird up and down in its enclosure.

In quartz cuckoos, different systems have been used to produce the bird&#x27;s call; the usual bellows, a digital recording of a real cuckoo in the wild (with a corresponding echo accompanied by the sound of a waterfall and other birds in the background) or a recording of the bird&#x27;s call only. In musical versions, the hourly chime is followed by the replay of one of twelve popular melodies (one for each hour). Some musical quartz clocks in the chalet style also reproduce many of the popular automata found on mechanical musical clocks, such as beer drinkers, wood-choppers, and jumping deer.

Uniquely, quartz cuckoo clocks often include a sensor, so that when the lights are turned off at night they automatically silence the hourly chime. Others are pre-programmed not to strike between a set of pre-determined hours. Whether this is controlled by a light sensor or pre-programmed, the function is referred to as a &quot;night silence&quot; feature. On quartz wall clocks in the traditional style, the weights are conventionally cast in the shape of pine cones made of plastic rather than iron. The pendulum bob is often another carved leaf. Here, the weights and pendulum are purely ornamental as the clock is driven by battery power.

==History==
===First modern cuckoo clocks===
In 1629, many decades before clockmaking was established in the Black Forest, an Augsburg merchant by the name of Philipp Hainhofer (1578–1647) penned one of the first known descriptions of a modern cuckoo clock. In Dresden, he visited the Kunstkammer (Cabinet of curiosities) of Prince Elector August von Sachsen. One of the rooms contained a chiming clock with a moving bird, a cuckoo announcing every quarter of an hour, which he briefly described as: &quot;A beautiful chiming clock, inside a cuckoo, indicating the quarter hours with its beak and call, the hours with its flapping wings and pour sugar from its tail&quot; (translated from the German). Hainhofer does not describe what this clock may have looked like and who built it. This piece is no longer part of the Dresden Green Vault collection, but appears in a 1619 inventory book as: &quot;In addition, there is also a new entry. 1 Clock with a cuckoo that yells. It stands on a black pedestal made of ebony on the barber&#x27;s chest&quot; (translated from the German).

The Dresden timepiece should not have been unique, because the mechanical cuckoo was considered part of the known mechanical arts in the 17th century. In a widely known handbook on music, &quot;Musurgia Universalis&quot; (1650), the scholar Athanasius Kircher describes a mechanical organ with several automated figures, including a mechanical cuckoo. This book contains the first documented description—in words and pictures—of how a mechanical cuckoo works. Kircher did not invent the cuckoo mechanism, because this book, like his other works, is a compilation of known facts into a handbook for reference purposes. The engraving clearly shows all the elements of a mechanical cuckoo. The bird automatically opens its beak and moves both its wings and tail. Simultaneously, there is heard the whistle—call of the cuckoo, created by two organ pipes, tuned to a minor or major third. There is only one fundamental difference from the Black Forest-type cuckoo mechanism: The functions of Kircher&#x27;s bird are not governed by a count wheel in a strike train, but a pinned program barrel synchronizes the movements and sounds of the bird.

On the other hand, in 1669 Domenico Martinelli, in his handbook on elementary clocks &quot;Horologi Elementari&quot;, suggests using the call of the cuckoo to indicate the hours. Starting at that time the mechanism of the cuckoo clock was known. Any mechanic or clockmaker, who could read Latin or Italian, knew after reading the books that it was feasible to have the cuckoo announce the hours.

Subsequently, cuckoo clocks appeared in regions that had not been known for their clockmaking. For instance, the &quot;Historische Nachrichten&quot; (1713), an anonymous publication generally attributed to Court Preacher Bartholomäus Holzfuss, mentions a musical clock in the Oranienburg palace in Berlin. This clock, originating in West Prussia, played eight church hymns and had a cuckoo that announced the quarter hours. Unfortunately this clock, like the one mentioned by Hainhofer in 1629, can no longer be traced today.

In the 18th century, people in the Black Forest started to build cuckoo clocks.

===First cuckoo clocks made in the Black Forest===

It is not clear who built the first cuckoo clocks in the Black Forest, but there is unanimity that the unusual clock with the bird call very quickly conquered the region. By the middle of the 18th century, several small clockmaking shops between Neustadt and Sankt Georgen were making cuckoo clocks out of wood and shields decorated with paper. After a journey through south-west Germany in 1762, Count Giuseppe Garampi, Prefect of the Vatican Archives, remarked: &quot;In this region large quantities of wooden movement clocks are made, and even if they were not completely unknown earlier, they have now been perfected, and one has started to equip them with the cuckoo&#x27;s call.&quot;

It is hard to judge how large the proportion of cuckoo clocks was among the total production of early days Black Forest clocks. Based on the proportion of pieces surviving to the present, it must have been a small fraction of the total production. Especially 18th century cuckoo clocks, in which all the parts of the movement, including gears, were made of wood. They are extremely rare, Wilhelm Schneider was only able to list a dozen of pieces with wooden movements in his book &quot;Frühe Kuckucksuhren (Early Cuckoo Clocks)&quot; (2008). The cuckoo clock remained a niche product until the middle of the 19th century, made by a few specialized workshops.

Regarding its murky origins, there are two main fables from the first two chroniclers of Black Forest horology which tell contradicting stories about it: The first is from Father Franz Steyrer, written in his &quot;Geschichte der Schwarzwälder Uhrmacherkunst (History of the Art of Clockmaking in the Black Forest)&quot; in 1796. He describes a meeting, happened around 1742, between two clock peddlers (&quot;Uhrenträger&quot;, literally &quot;clock carriers&quot;, who carried the dials and movements on their backs displayed on huge backpacks), Joseph Ganther from Neukirch (Furtwangen) and Joseph Kammerer from Furtwangen, who met a travelling Bohemian merchant who sold wooden cuckoo clocks. When they returned home, they brought with them this novelty, since it had caught their eyes, and show it to Michael Dilger from Neukirch and Matthäus Hummel from Glashütte, who were very pleased with it and began to copy it. Its popularity grew in the region and more and more clockmakers started making them. With regard to this chronicle, the historian Adolf Kistner claimed in his book &quot;Die Schwarzwälder Uhr (The Black Forest Clock)&quot;, published in 1927, that there is not any Bohemian cuckoo clock in existence to verify the thesis that such a clock was used as a sample to copy and produce Black Forest cuckoo clocks. Bohemia had no fundamental clockmaking industry during that period.

The second story is related by another priest, Markus Fidelis Jäck, in a passage extracted from his report &quot;Darstellungen aus der Industrie und des Verkehrs aus dem Schwarzwald (Descriptions of the Industry and Transport of the Black Forest)&quot;, (1810) said as follows: &quot;The cuckoo clock was invented (in the early 1730s) by a clock-master [Franz Anton Ketterer] from Schönwald. This craftsman adorned a clock with a moving bird that announced the hour with the cuckoo-call. The clock-master got the idea of how to make the cuckoo-call from the bellows of a church organ&quot;. Unfortunately, neither Steyrer nor Jäck quote any sources for their claims, making them unverifiable.

As time went on, the second version became the more popular, and is the one generally related today, though evidence suggests its inaccuracy. This type of clock is much older than clockmaking in the Black Forest. As early as 1650, the mechanical cuckoo was part of the reference book knowledge recorded in handbooks. It took nearly a century for the cuckoo clock to find its way to the Black Forest, where for many decades it remained a tiny niche product.

In addition, R. Dorer pointed out in 1948 that Franz Anton Ketterer (1734–1806) could not have been the inventor of the cuckoo clock in 1730, because he had not yet been born. This statement was corroborated by Gerd Bender in the most recent edition of the first volume of his work &quot;Die Uhrenmacher des hohen Schwarzwaldes und ihre Werke (The Clockmakers of the High Black Forest and their Works)&quot; (1998) in which he wrote that the cuckoo clock was not native to the Black Forest and also stated that: &quot;There are no traces of the first production line of cuckoo clocks made by Ketterer&quot;. Schaaf, in &quot;Schwarzwalduhren (Black Forest Clocks)&quot; (1995), provides his own research which leads to the earliest cuckoos having been built in the Franconia and Lower Bavaria area, in the southeast of Germany, (forming nowadays the northern two-thirds of the Free State of Bavaria), in the direction of Bohemia (nowadays the main region of the Czech Republic), which he notes, lends credence to the Steyrer version.

Although the idea of placing an automaton cuckoo bird in a clock to announce the passing of time did not originate in the Black Forest, the cuckoo clock as it is known today (in its traditional form decorated with wood carvings) comes from this region located in southwest Germany. The Black Forest people who created the cuckoo clock industry developed it, and still come up with new designs and technical improvements.

Even though the functionality of the cuckoo mechanism has remained basically unchanged, the appearance has changed as case designs and clock movements evolved in the region. Around 1800, the first lacquered shield clocks appeared, the so-called &quot;Lackschilduhr&quot; (&quot;lacquered shield clock&quot;), characterized by having a painted flat square wooden face behind which all the clockwork was attached. On top of the square was usually a semicircle of highly decorated painted wood which contained the door for the cuckoo. These usually depicted floral motifs, like roses, and often had a painted column, on either side of the chapter ring, others were decorated with fruits as well. Some pieces also bore the names of the bride and bridegroom on the dial, which were normally painted by women. There was no cabinet surrounding the clockwork in this model. This design was the most prevalent during the first half of the 19th century.

By the middle of the 19th century, Black Foresters began to experiment with a variety of forms. In the 1840s, the Beha company had already been selling &quot;Biedermeier&quot; style table cuckoo clocks. Up until now, clocks had mainly been manufactured with a large shield hiding the movement behind, without a case surrounding it. Now, for the first time, timepieces with a real case were produced in large numbers. These clocks with their simple geometric shapes, some with small columns on both sides of the dial for decoration, are reminiscent of the art of the &quot;Biedermeier&quot; period. Such pieces were built between 1840 and the 1890s - and sometimes a cuckoo was included in these simple &quot;&quot;Biedermeier&quot; clocks&quot;. Some models had also a painting of a person or animal with moving eyes.

Towards the middle of the 19th century until the 1880s, picture frame cuckoo clocks also became available. As the name suggests, these wall timepieces consisted of a picture frame, usually with a typical Black Forest scene painted on a wooden background or a sheet metal, lithography and screen-printing were other techniques used. Other common themes depicted were; hunting, love, family, death, birth, mythology, military and Christian religious scenes. Works by painters such as Johann Baptist Laule (1817–1895) and Carl Heine (1842–1882) were used to decorate the fronts of this and other types of clocks. The painting was almost always protected by a glass and some models displayed a person or an animal with blinking or flirty eyes as well, being operated by a simple mechanism worked by means of the pendulum swinging. The cuckoo normally took part in the scene painted, and would pop out in 3D, as usual, to announce the hour.

Another type of picture frame clock (&quot;Rahmenuhr&quot;) produced in the region from the middle of the 19th century, was based on a Viennese model from around 1830. The front of these timepieces was decorated with a serially stamped brass plate. The brass was given a gold-coloured surface by polishing it or treating it with nitric acid. Some of these pieces, which were produced in large numbers up until the 1880s, were also available with a cuckoo mechanism.

As for house-shaped cases, in the 1870s the Beha company marketed table and wall models of considerable size, so-called &quot;Herrenhäusle&quot; (&quot;House of Lords&quot;, a manor house or mansion), whose detailed wooden cases replicated attic windows from where the cuckoo pop out, a shingle roof with chimney, rain gutters and downpipes, etc.

On the other hand, from the 1860s until the early 20th century, cases were manufactured in a wide variety of styles such as; Neoclassical or Georgian (certain pieces also displayed a painting), neo-Gothic, neo-Renaissance, neo-Baroque, Art Nouveau, etc., becoming a suitable decorative object for the bourgeois home. These timepieces are less common than the popular ones looking like gatekeeper-houses (&quot;Bahnhäusle&quot; style clocks) and they could be mantel, wall or bracket clocks.

However, the popular house-shaped &quot;Bahnhäusleuhr&quot; (&quot;railway-house clock&quot;) virtually forced the discontinuation of other styles within a few decades.

===&quot;Bahnhäusle&quot; style, a successful design from Furtwangen===
In September 1850, the first director of the Grand Duchy of Baden Clockmakers School in Furtwangen, Robert Gerwig, launched a public competition to submit designs for modern clockcases, which would allow homemade products to attain a professional appearance.

Friedrich Eisenlohr (1805–1854), who as an architect had been responsible for creating the buildings along the then new and first Badenese Rhine valley railway, submitted the most far-reaching design. Eisenlohr enhanced the facade of a standard railroad-guard&#x27;s residence, as he had built many of them, with a clock dial. His &quot;Wallclock with shield decorated by ivy vines&quot;, (in reality the ornament were grapevines and not ivy) as it is referred to in a surviving, handwritten report from the Clockmakers School from 1851 or 1852, became the prototype of today&#x27;s popular souvenir cuckoo clocks.

Eisenlohr was also up-to-date stylistically. He was inspired by local images; rather than copying them slavishly, he modified them. Contrary to most present-day cuckoo clocks, his case features light, unstained wood and were decorated with symmetrical, flat fretwork ornaments. His idea became an instant hit, because the modern design of the &quot;Bahnhäusle&quot; clock appealed to the decorating tastes of the growing bourgeoisie and thereby tapped into new and growing markets. 

While the Clockmakers School was satisfied to have Eisenlohr&#x27;s clock case sketches, they were not fully realized in their original form. Eisenlohr had proposed a wooden facade; Gerwig preferred a painted metal front combined with an enamel dial. But despite intensive campaigns by the Clockmakers School, sheet metal fronts decorated with oil paintings (or coloured lithographs) never became a major market segment because of the high cost and labour-intensive process, hence they were only produced from the 1850s until around 1880, whether wall or mantel versions.

Characteristically, the makers of the first &quot;Bahnhäusle&quot; clocks deviated from Eisenlohr&#x27;s sketch in only one way: they left out the cuckoo mechanism. Unlike today, the design with the little house was not synonymous with a cuckoo clock in the first years after 1850. This is another indication that at that time cuckoo clocks could not have been an important market segment.

Only in December 1854, Johann Baptist Beha, the best known maker of cuckoo clocks of his time, sold two of them, with oil paintings on their fronts, to the Furtwangen clock dealer Gordian Hettich, which were described as &quot;Bahnhöfle Uhren&quot; (&quot;railway station clocks&quot;). More than a year later, on 20 January 1856, another respected Furtwangen-based cuckoo clockmaker, Theodor Ketterer, sold one to Joseph Ruff in Glasgow.

Concurrently with Beha and Ketterer, other Black Forest clockmakers must have started to equip &quot;Bahnhäusle&quot; clocks with cuckoo mechanisms to satisfy the rapidly growing demand for this type of clock. Starting in the mid-1850s there was a real boom in this market. For example, numerous exhibitors at the trade exhibition in Villingen in 1858 offered cuckoo clocks in the &quot;Bahnhäuschenkasten&quot; or &quot;Bahnwartshaus&quot;.
 And in the annual report of the Furtwangen Clockmakers School of 1857/58 is stated: &quot;The cuckoo clock therefore found a very special market again as soon as the &quot;Bahnhäuschen&quot;, which was so very suitable for it, was used as a clock case.&quot;

By 1862, Johann Baptist Beha started to enhance his richly decorated &quot;Bahnhäusle&quot; clocks with hands carved from bone and weights cast in the shape of fir cones. Even today this combination of elements is characteristic for cuckoo clocks, although the hands are usually made of wood or plastic, white celluloid was employed in the past too. As for the weights, there was during this second half of the 19th century, a few models which featured weights cast in the shape of a Gnome and other curious forms.

Thanks to Eisenlohr&#x27;s design, the cuckoo clock became one of the most successful Black Forest products within a few years. In a report on the exhibition of local products at the 1873 Vienna World&#x27;s Fair, Karl Schott, the then head of the &quot;Furtwanger Landesgewerbehalle&quot; (Furtwangen State Trade Hall), wrote &quot;that today the cuckoo clock is one of the most sought-after clocks in the Black Forest&quot;. At the time of the Vienna exhibition, cuckoo clocks were not only sold on the German domestic market, but in many regions of the world. The main export countries in Europe were Switzerland, England, Russia and the Ottoman Empire. Schott also named overseas sales in his 1873 report: North America, Mexico, South America, Australia, India, Japan, China and even the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii). 

By 1860, the &quot;Bahnhäusle&quot; style had started to develop away from its original, &quot;severe&quot; graphic form, and evolved toward the well-known case with three-dimensional woodcarvings, like the &quot;Jagdstück&quot; (&quot;hunt piece&quot;, design created in Furtwangen in 1861), a cuckoo clock with a carved oak foliage and hunting motives, such as trophy animals, guns and powder pouches. Only ten years after its invention by Friedrich Eisenlohr, all variations of the house-theme had reached maturity. &quot;Bahnhäusle&quot; timepieces and its variations were also available as a mantel clock, but not as many compared to the wall version.

These ornate timepieces were not made by one clockmaker only, otherwise such a complex product could not have been produced at acceptable prices. There were numerous specialists who assisted the clockmakers. In 1873, Karl Schott reported on the division of labour at the Vienna Exhibition: &quot;The birds are mostly carved and painted by women. The pipes are made by a pipe maker. In addition to a number of master craftsmen, there are also a number of large companies involved in the manufacture of cuckoo clocks, and the cuckoo clock maker rarely makes them himself. Rather, he obtains the movements, reworks them with precision, attaches the bellows and pipes and thus puts the finished movement in the case.&quot;

The division of labour meant that different clockmakers purchased completely identical parts from the same suppliers. Therefore, small components in particular, such as hands or dials, showed a tendency towards standardization. But it also happened from time to time that movements from different manufacturers were found in cases that looked the same on the outside, simply because they came from the same case maker.

The basic cuckoo clock of today is the railway-house (&quot;Bahnhäusle&quot;) form, still with its rich ornamentation, and these are known under the name of &quot;carved&quot;, &quot;classic&quot; or &quot;traditional&quot;; which display carved leaves, birds, deer heads (&quot;Jagdstück&quot; design), other animals, etc. The richly decorated &quot;Bahnhäusle&quot; clocks have become a symbol of the Black Forest that is instantly understood anywhere in the world.

The cuckoo clock became successful and world-famous after Friedrich Eisenlohr contributed the &quot;Bahnhäusle&quot; design to the 1850 competition at the Furtwangen Clockmakers School.
===Chalet style, the Swiss contribution===
The chalet style cuckoo clock, whose case reproduce to scale a traditional farmhouse, originated in Switzerland in the late 19th century. 

The miniature Swiss chalets date back to the beginnings of artistic wood carving in Brienz, in the early 19th century. The Brienzerware chalet became a popular souvenir, allowing tourists to take home an explicit reminder of a quintessential Swiss structure, though some were rather grand in scale, measuring three or more feet across. Many of these chalets, crafted in different sizes, doubled as music boxes, jewellery boxes, decorative objects, timepieces, etc. Some of those table clocks had also the added feature of a cuckoo bird or the tandem composed of a cuckoo and quail.

Eventually, Black Forest makers incorporated the chalet style to their production in the early 20th century, and still remains a popular choice, along with the carved ones, among buyers of this cult item. Cases are usually made after the traditional farmhouses of different regions, such as the Black Forest, Swiss Alps, Emmental, Bavaria and Tyrol. They often have a musical movement, as well as moving figurines and some other elements.

Contrary to popular belief, Switzerland is not the birthplace of the cuckoo clock. In the English-speaking world, cuckoo clocks are sufficiently identified with Switzerland that the 1949 film &quot;The Third Man&quot; has an oft-quoted speech (and it even had antecedents) in which the villainous Harry Lime mockingly says: &quot; (...) in Italy, for 30 years under the Borgias, they had warfare, terror, murder and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and the Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love, they had five hundred years of democracy and peace - and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock.&quot;

===In England===
Apart from the Black Forest, the cuckoo clock was also made in England in the 18th century. It seems that very few of these London timepieces were produced, an indication that in those days, before the worldwide popularization of the cuckoo clock from the second half of the 19th century, there was not a high demand for them.

There is at least one example, intended for the Spanish market. It is a circa 1785 George III bracket clock, eight-day time, three-fusee, verge escapement, which announces the quarters on eight bells and gives the hours on a deep toned cuckoo, pull quarter repeat on command. The two pipes and bellows for the bird&#x27;s sound are located at the base of the case, below the movement. Those pipes are placed horizontally, the same position seen in early Black Forest cuckoos. Both the dial and the elaborately engraved back plate, read: &quot;Higgs y / Diego Evans / Londres&quot;.

Robert Higgs and his son Peter were in partnership together as Robert and Peter Higgs, and later, between 1780 and 1785 with James Evans, who sometimes styled himself in Spanish as Diego Evans. They traded musical and other complex clocks, many for the Spanish market.

In the mid-20th century, Camerer, Cuss &amp; Co., London, a retailer of Black Forest clocks, etc., produced a few different models in the shape of a half-timbered Tudor style house. The bird was cast aluminum with movable beak and fixed wings and the weights were cylindrical, rather than pine-cone shaped. They were featured in a Pathé News newsreel in 1950.

According to author Terence Camerer Cuss, the company hoped to produce them in large quantities, but due to the high manufacturing cost, only fifty were made between 1949 and 1951. One of them, marked &quot;01&quot;, was presented by the maker to the then Prince Charles in 1949 and is part of the Royal Collection.

===In the United States===
Cuckoo clocks have been imported to the US by German immigrants for a long time, especially in the 19th century. There are two well-known cuckoo clock manufacturers in the USA: The New England Cuckoo Clock Company was founded in 1958 by W. Kenneth Sessions Jr. and operated in Bristol, Connecticut. The design of the models is clearly American. The clocks were made with Hubert Herr clockworks that were imported from Triberg. The printed and colored paper dials of the clocks are unmistakable, as is the early American design. The clocks were designed by Nils Magnus Tornquist. A kit watch was also offered.

The second is the American Cuckoo Clock Company of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which originated in the 1890s and imported German clocks. Eventually, the company switched to importing clockworks only and building cuckoo clocks in the USA. 

===In Portugal and Brazil===

In the 1940s and 50s cuckoo clocks were made in Portugal by Fábrica Nacional de Relógios A Boa Reguladora, Reguladora from 1953, in Vila Nova de Famalicão. Their models were in the Black Forest traditional style, with wood carved animals and leaves, and they could be spring-driven or weight-driven. Since its early years, the Portuguese clockmaking company was a fully integrated enterprise, making its own cases and movements (until 1995). 
In later catalogues, they sold cuckoos imported from Germany.

In Brazil, they were manufactured between the 1940s and the 1970s, marketed under different brand names such as Astro, Rei, H and Inrebra, the last two by INREBRA (Indústria de Relógios do Brasil Ltda.), São Paulo. Same as the Portuguese cuckoos, they were inspired by Black Forest models, with wood carvings or cases in the shape of a chalet.

===In the Soviet Union and East Asia===

From the early 1950s until the 1990s, cuckoo clocks were made in the former Soviet Union by the Serdobsk Clock Factory, which were sold under the trademark &quot;Маяк&quot; (transliterated as Majak) from 1963. They produced a range of models with a distinctive style; a colourful front painted with floral and vegetal motifs, spruce branches in relief, Russian motifs, basic decoration or any, a deer head on top, etc. One model in particular, composed of a bird on top and five wine leaves was directly based on a Black Forest one.

In Japan, its production began in 1949. Those early timepieces, in the Black Forest style, were marketed under the trademark Poppo by Tezuka Clock Co., Ltd., Tokyo, and usually had stamped &quot;Made in Occupied Japan&quot; on plate and dial. This term was used in items produced in the country between late 1945 and early 1952, after World War II.

In China and South Korea, cuckoo clocks also began to be manufactured in the second half of the 20th century.

===Designer cuckoo clocks===

The early 21st century has seen a revitalization of the iconic timepiece with designs, materials, technologies, shapes and colours never seen before in cuckoo clock manufacturing. These pieces are distinguished by its functional and minimalist aesthetic.

Although simplified designs with simple, clear lines had already been produced in the 20th century, the boom of designer cuckoo clocks was initiated in the 2000s (the first examples dating back to the 1990s), particularly in Italy, Germany and Japan.

There are a wide variety of models, many of them avant-garde creations made of different materials and geometric shapes, such as rhombuses, squares, cubes, circles, rectangles, etc. Without carving, these clocks are usually flat and smooth. Some are painted in a single colour while others are polychromes with abstract or figurative paintings, others include text and phrases, etc. About the clockwork, there are quartz, mechanical and sometimes, digital.

==Museums==
In Europe, museums that display collections are the Cuckooland Museum in the UK with more than 700 clocks, the Deutsches Uhrenmuseum and Dorf- und Uhrenmuseum Gütenbach in Germany.

The James J. Fiorentino Museum has one of the biggest collections in the United States. Located in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It contains more than 300 cuckoo clocks.

<doc id="346362" wikidata="Q1044076" url="?curid=346362" title="List of U.S. state fossils">
<text>Most states in the US have designated a state fossil, many during the 1980s. It is common to designate a fossilized species, rather than a single specimen or a category of fossils. State fossils are distinct from other state emblems like state dinosaurs, state stones, state minerals, state gemstones or state rocks and a state may designate one, a few, or all of those. For example, in Arizona, the state stone is turquoise and the state dinosaur is &quot;Sonorasaurus thompsoni&quot; yet the state fossil is petrified wood.

The two first states to designate a state fossil were Nebraska and North Dakota, both in 1967.

Seven states and the District of Columbia still lack an explicit state fossil:

* Arkansas: still no state fossil in Arkansas, though the state designated &quot;Arkansaurus&quot; as its state dinosaur.
* District of Columbia: &quot;Capitalsaurus&quot; is the state dinosaur of Washington D.C., but the District has not chosen a state fossil.
* Florida: There is no state fossil in Florida, though agatised coral, which is a fossil, is the state stone.
* Hawaii
* Iowa: The crinoid was proposed in 2018.
* Minnesota: The giant beaver was proposed in 2022.
* New Hampshire: The American mastodon (&quot;Mammut americanum&quot;) was considered in 2015.
* Texas: There is no state fossil though the state dinosaur is &quot;Sauroposeidon proteles&quot;.

<doc id="346365" wikidata="Q13517610" url="?curid=346365" title="List of U.S. state birds">
<text>Below is a list of U.S. state birds as designated by each state&#x27;s, district&#x27;s or territory&#x27;s government.

The selection of state birds began with Kentucky adopting the northern cardinal in 1926. It continued when the legislatures for Alabama, Florida, Maine, Missouri, Oregon, Texas and Wyoming selected their state birds after a campaign was started by the General Federation of Women&#x27;s Clubs to name official state birds in the 1920s. The last state to choose its bird was Arizona in 1973.

Pennsylvania never chose an official state bird, but did choose the ruffed grouse as the state game bird. Alaska, California, and South Dakota permit hunting of their state birds. Alabama, Georgia, Massachusetts, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Tennessee have designated an additional &quot;state game bird&quot; for the purpose of hunting. The northern cardinal is the state bird of seven states, followed by the western meadowlark as the state bird of six states.

The District of Columbia designated a district bird in 1938. Of the five inhabited territories of the United States, American Samoa and Puerto Rico are the only ones without territorial birds.

== State birds ==
=== Notes ===
== Other state birds ==
In addition to having a state bird, some states have chosen a state game bird (or state wild game bird), a state waterfowl (or state duck), a state raptor, or a bird as their state symbol of peace.

== States with the same state bird ==
Some state birds are shared between multiple states. Of the 50 states, a total of 32 do not have a unique state bird.

<text>The ATR 42 is a regional airliner produced by Franco-Italian manufacturer ATR, with final assembly in Toulouse, France.

On 4 November 1981, the aircraft was launched with ATR, as a joint venture between French Aérospatiale (now part of Airbus) and Aeritalia (now Leonardo S.p.A.).
The ATR 42-300 performed its maiden flight on 16 August 1984 and type certification was granted during September 1985.
Launch customer Air Littoral operated its first revenue-earning flight in December of that year.
The high-wing airliner is powered by two turboprop engines, Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PW120s.
The number &quot;42&quot; in its name is derived from the aircraft&#x27;s original standard seating capacity of 42 passengers.

Later variants are upgraded with new avionics, a glass cockpit, and newer engine versions.
The ATR 42 is the basis for the stretched ATR 72, introduced in October 1989.

== Development ==

During the 1960s and 1970s, European aircraft manufacturers had, for the most part, undergone considerable corporate restructuring, including mergers and consolidations, as well as moving towards collaborative multinational programmes, such as the newly launched Airbus A300. In line with this trend towards intra-European co-operation, French aerospace manufacturer Aérospatiale and Italian aviation conglomerate Aeritalia commenced discussions on the topic of working together to develop an all-new regional airliner. Prior to this, both companies had been independently conducting studies for their own aircraft concepts, the AS 35 design in the case of Aerospatiale and the AIT 230 for Aeritalia, to conform with demand within this sector of the market as early as 1978.

=== Initial development ===
On 4 November 1981, a formal co-operation agreement was signed by Aeritalia chairman Renato Bonifacio and Aerospatiale chairman Jacques Mitterrand in Paris. This agreement signaled not only the merger of their efforts, but also of their separate concept designs together into a single complete aircraft design for the purpose of pursuing its development and manufacture as a collaborative joint venture.
The consortium then targeted a similar unit cost, but a fuel consumption over a sector, nearly half the required by its 40-50 seat competitors, the British Aerospace HS.748 and Fokker F.27, and planned a 58-seat ATR XX stretch.

This agreement served not only as the basis and origins of the ATR company, but also as the effective launch point of what would become the fledgling firm&#x27;s first aircraft, which was designated as the ATR 42. By 1983, ATR&#x27;s customer services division has been set up, readying infrastructure worldwide to provide support for ATR&#x27;s upcoming aircraft to any customer regardless of location.
On 16 August 1984, the first ATR 42 conducted its maiden flight from Toulouse Airport, France. During September 1985, both the French Directorate General for Civil Aviation (DGCA) and the Italian Italian Civil Aviation Authority awarded type certification for the type, clearing it to commence operational service.

=== Introduction ===
On 3 December 1985, the first production aircraft, designated as the ATR 42-300, was delivered to French launch customer Air Littoral, with the first revenue service, between Béziers Cap d&#x27;Agde Airport and Paris Orly airport taking place on 23 December. During January 1986, already confident of the ATR 42&#x27;s success and of the demand for an enlarged version of the aircraft, ATR announced that the launch of a programme to develop such an aircraft, which was designated as the ATR 72 to reflect its increased passenger capacity.

By the end of 1986, the ATR 42 had accumulated a sizable backlog of orders, which in turn led to a ramping up of the type&#x27;s rate of production. During August 1988, ATR&#x27;s marketing efforts in the lucrative North American market resulted in the securing of a large order of 50 ATR-42-300s from US operator Texas Air Corporation; that same year, another American regional carrier, Trans World Express, received the 100th production aircraft. On 1 July 1989, ATR opened their new global training centre for the type in Toulouse, which provided centralised and modern facilities for the training to airline staff and other personnel across the world. During June 1999, the ATR global training center became one of the first European institutions to be recognised as a Type Rating Training Organization, as defined by the Joint Aviation Authorities.

During September 1989, ATR announced it had achieved its original target of 400 sales of the ATR. That same year, deliveries of the enlarged ATR 72 commenced; shortly thereafter, both types commonly were ordered together. Since the smaller ATR 42 is assembled on the same production line as the ATR 72, along with sharing the majority of subsystems, components, and manufacturing techniques, the two types support each other to remain in production. This factor may have been crucial, as by 2015, the ATR 42 was the only 50-seat regional aircraft that was still being manufactured.

=== ATR 42-300/320 ===

To maintain a technological edge on the highly competitive market for regional airliners during the 1990s, several modifications and improved versions of the ATR 42 were progressively introduced. The initial ATR 42-300 model remained in production until 1996, while the first upgraded (and broadly similar) model, designated as the &#x27;ATR 42-320, was also produced until 1996. The -320 variant principally differed in that it was powered by a pair of the more-powerful PW121 engines, giving it improved performance over the 300. Another variant, the ATR 42-300QC, was a dedicated quick-change (convertible) freight/passenger version of the standard -300 series.

=== ATR 42-500 ===

The next major production version was the ATR 42-500 series, the development of which having been originally announced on 14 June 1993. Performing its maiden flight on 16 September 1994, and awarded certification by the British Civil Aviation Authority and France&#x27;s DGCA during July 1995; the -500 model was an upgraded aircraft, equipped with new PW127 engines, new six-bladed propellers, improved hot and high performance, increased weight capacity, and an improved passenger cabin. On 31 October 1995, the first ATR 42-500 was delivered to Italian operator Air Dolomiti; on 19 January 1996, the first revenue service to be performed by the type was conducted.
On 19 November 2000, 120 min ETOPS were approved.

In addition to new aircraft models, various organisational changes were also implemented. On 10 July 1998, ATR launched its new asset management department. In June 2001, EADS and Alenia Aeronautica, ATR&#x27;s parent companies, decided to reinforce their partnership, regrouping all industrial activities related to regional airliners underneath the ATR consortium. On 3 October 2003, ATR became one of the first aircraft manufacturers to be certified under ISO 9001-2000 and EN/AS/JISQ 9100, the worldwide quality standard for the aeronautics industry. During July 2004, ATR and Brazilian aircraft manufacturer Embraer announced a cooperation agreement on the AEROChain Portal for the purpose of delivering improved customer service. During April 2009, ATR announced the launch of its &#x27;Door-2-Door&#x27; service as a new option in its comprehensive customer-services range.

=== ATR 42-600 ===

The current production version is the ATR 42-600 series. On 2 October 2007, ATR CEO Stéphane Mayer announced the launch of the -600 series aircraft; the ATR 42-600 and ATR 72-600 featured various improvements to increase efficiency, dispatch reliability, and lower fuel burn and operating costs. While broadly similar to the earlier -500 model, differences include the adoption of improved PW127M engines, a new glass cockpit, and a variety of other minor improvements. Using the test registration &quot;F-WWLY&quot;, the prototype ATR 42-600 first flew on 4 March 2010. The first aircraft was delivered to Tanzanian airline Precision Air in November 2012.

As a consequence of strong demand for the -600 series, ATR decided to invest in the establishment of a second, more modern final-assembly line and acquisition of more hangar space at their Toulouse site, along with a new large completion and delivery area; overall, the manufacturing operation expanded to four times the footprint that it had in 2005. Speaking in October 2015, ATR CEO Patrick de Castelbajac stated that the firm was set to produce in excess of 90 aircraft that year, and that the new manufacturing facilities could support a production rate of up to 120 per year. At the time, the company had a backlog of orders for 300 aircraft, sufficient for three years&#x27; of production. During 2017, a new in-house financing and leasing division was established by ATR to offer customers a greater degree of support and expand the company&#x27;s range of services.

Considerable emphasis has been placed upon the continuous development of ATR&#x27;s aircraft models.
Additionally, during the mid-2010s, reports emerged that the development of a further stretched 90-seat ATR model was under consideration as well; allegedly, shareholder Airbus was relatively unenthusiastic on proceeding with such a development, while ATR CEO Fabrice Brégier favoured a focus on resolving manufacturing issues.

=== 42-600S STOL ===

During the late 2010s, ATR conducted a feasibility study into developing the ATR 42&#x27;s short takeoff and landing (STOL) capabilities, potentially enabling the type to make use of runways as short as 800 m (2,625 ft) via the adoption of enhanced brakes and a drastically modified tail unit; the company viewed this measure as expanding the aircraft&#x27;s potential and opening new sales possibilities. It could introduce a steep approach capability and operating costs that compare to 30-seaters.

STOL improvements should be launched in 2019 to reduce landing distance from .
Existing control surfaces would be re-engineered with takeoff flaps extended to 25°, and both spoilers deploying at landing and not only for inflight turns, adding an autobrake system, while the rudder is modified to increase its maximum deflection and the vertical stabilizer&#x27;s size is increased, to counter an engine failure, lowering the minimum control speed.

ATR estimates a market for STOL 20–42 seaters of 800 over 30 years, to serve islands and deliver cargo to short runways.
The ATR 42-600S empty weight will be reduced with lighter seats and galley fittings. The variant was officially announced at the June 2019 Paris Air Show. Irish lessor Elix Aviation Capital will be the launch customer, taking 10 aircraft from 2022 to 2024; commitments from Air Tahiti and another undisclosed customer bring the total order book to 17.

On 9 October 2019, ATR launched the ATR 42-600S at the European Regions Airline Association General Assembly, with 20 commitments including from Elix Aviation Capital (10 aircraft) and Air Tahiti (two aircraft).
Capable of operating from runways with up to 42 passengers, certification is expected for the second half of 2022 before first delivery.
The ATR 42-600S can access close to 500 airports with an runway, expanding its addressable market by 25%. 800 m runway operation is limited to long flights with 70% used seats.

The variant made a 2h 15min maiden flight on 11 May 2022, while the larger rudder will be fitted at the end of 2022 before the certification phase start in 2023.

In November 2024 ATR terminated the development of the 42-600S STOL version, opting instead to focus on improving the efficiency of the entire ATR 42 and ATR 72 families.

== Design ==
The ATR 42 is a straight high-wing airliner with twin turboprops and a T-tail, certified in the transport category, and powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PW120s.
It has deicing boots to fly in icing conditions and a retractable landing gear in fairings under the fuselage, with wheel sides visible in flight.
It has no Auxiliary Power Unit (APU), but can still be autonomous in ground operations, as it has a propeller brake on the starboard engine, allowing the engine to remain running to provide power on the ground.

It has a pressurized cabin with a circular cross-section, with a inside width for four-abreast seating, allowing 48 seats at a seat pitch.
It has a wing area and a wing span, for a wing aspect ratio.
It has a MTOW, for a wing loading.
It can reach a cruise speed of 300 kt (556 km/h) true air speed, with a fuel flow of 811 kg/h (1,788 lb/h): a fuel economy of kg/km ( lb/nmi) or per seat with 48 seats and a jet fuel density of 0.8.

== Operational history ==

On 21 August 1990, US airline American Eagle placed a large order for ATRs, composed of 41 ATR 42s and 59 ATR 72s, further consolidating ATR&#x27;s position in North America. On 5 September 1997, American Eagle took delivery of the 500th ATR to be built. On 5 June 1998, Tarom, the national carrier of Romania, accepted delivery of its first two ATR 42-500s, of a batch of seven aircraft ordered a year earlier. On 28 June 1998, ATR gained a foothold in the Cuban market following an order from airline Cubana de Aviacion for the ATR 42. During 2000, the combined global ATR fleet attained its 10,000,000th flight, during which a cumulative distance around 4 billion km (2.5 billion statute miles) had been traversed, and around 450 million passengers had flown onboard ATR-built aircraft. In 2007, a new record was set for the programme&#x27;s sales; 113 new ATR aircraft having been ordered during a single year.

2011 was another record-breaking year for sales at ATR. According to ATR&#x27;s CEO Filippo Bagnato, sales had continued to grow during the Great Recession despite the downturn experienced by most aviation companies as &quot;fuel consumption that can be half that of the alternatives and [with] lower maintenance costs&quot;. Bagnato noted the strength of Africa as a market for the type, as well as the firm&#x27;s aircraft being capable of serving destinations that would otherwise be inaccessible with other aircraft due to the austere conditions of many airstrips and runways in the region, as well as the ability to operate autonomously without any reliance upon ground support equipment. For 2013, ATR claimed a 48% global market share for regional aircraft deliveries between 50 and 90 seats (comprising both turboprops and jets), making it the dominant manufacturer within this sector of the market. That same year, during which firm orders for 10 ATR 42-600s and 79 ATR 72-600s were recorded, leasing companies were responsible for 70% of these; according to ATR&#x27;s CEO Filippo Bagnato: &quot;Years ago, we were not even considered by the lessors; now they see ATRs as a good investment&quot;.

During May 1997, ATR had achieved its first breakthrough sale in China, placed by operator China Xinjiang Airlines and the CAAC. By 2013, while the Asia Pacific region had comprised the majority of ATR&#x27;s sales when geographically ranked, but orders from Chinese airlines remained elusive; Bagnato ascribed this anomaly to local market conditions dictating the typical use of larger aircraft, as well as a Chinese government policy of imposing high tariffs on the import of foreign-built, fixed-wing aircraft. During late 2014, ATR set up a new office in Beijing, and hired several former Airbus sales personnel with the aim of launching the type on the Chinese market. ATR believed that many of the already-flown routes did not suit larger 150-seat aircraft; however, of the roughly 2,600 commercial aircraft flying in China at that time, only 68 had a capacity less than 90 seats and of these, fewer than 20 aircraft were powered by turboprop engines.

In response to airlines often wanting to phase out their early production ATR models to replace them with the latest generation ATR series, as well as to answer demand from cargo operators for the type, ATR has operated two separate dedicated freighter conversion programmes, known as the Bulk Freighter (tube version) and the ULD Freighter. Both conversions involve complete stripping of furnishings along with the addition of floor strengthening, new window plugs and 9 g restraining nets, six additional longitudinal tracks for added flexibility, and an E-Class cabin; the ULD model can accommodate standard ULD-packaged cargo, such as LD3 containers or 88x108in (2.2x2.7m) pallets, which were loaded via a large cargo door located on the port forward side. Undertaken by a range of companies, such as Alenia subsidiary Aeronavali, Texas-based M7 Aerospace; French firms Indraéro Siren and Aeroconseil, Canadian Infinion Certification Engineering, and Spanish company Arrodisa, by October 2012, in excess of one-fifth of all first-generation ATR 42 and ATR 72 aircraft had already been converted to freighters.

During January 2017, Japanese regional airliner Japan Air Commuter (JAC) has taken delivery of its first ATR 42-600, becoming the first owner-operator of the type in the nation. The aircraft was one of nine to have been ordered by JAC, along with options for a further 14 ATR 42s, as a replacement for its aging Saab 340 fleet; reportedly, JAC is considering replacing its Bombardier Q400s with ATRs, as well.

Silver Airways started to operate the ATR 42-600 on 22 April 2019, making it the first airline to fly the -600 variant in the USA. The carrier has 16 firm orders for ATR turboprops with options to purchase 30 additional aircraft from ATR through lessor Nordic Aviation Capital.

In September 2024, Nepalese airline Buddha Air became the first to retire their ATR 42-320 by completing its economic life cycle of 70000 cycles.

== Variants ==

=== ATR 42-200 ===
The -200 was the original ATR 42 prototype, and only a few were built for testing purposes. It was powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PW120 engines rated at .

=== ATR 42-300 ===
The -300 was the standard production version. This model was manufactured until 1996. It was powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PW120 engines rated at .

=== ATR 42-320 ===
The -320 was an improved version of the -300 powered by PW121 engines (2100 shp). It was designed to have better performance, especially in hot and high conditions.

=== ATR 42-400 ===

The ATR 42-400 is an upgraded version of the -320 using six-bladed propellers on otherwise identical PW121 engines. Three ATR 42-400s were delivered to the government of Italy as the ATR 42 &quot;Surveyor&quot; version. The only two civilian ATR 42-400s produced (msn 487 and 491) were delivered to CSA Czech Airlines in 1995/1996 as an interim upgrade prior to delivery of -500s. In 2006, these two aircraft were sold to Conviasa.

=== ATR 42-500 ===

The ATR 42-500 is a further upgraded version, the first delivery of which occurring during October 1995. It has many improvements for performance and passenger comfort, including new engines, new propellers, a newly designed cabin, and increased weight. It has six-bladed propellers powered by PW127E engines rated at for improved hot and high performance and increased cruise speed. The engines are flat rated for 45 °C. Propellers are electrically controlled and are made from composite. It has an increased maximum takeoff weight, allowing for more cargo and greater range. Due to the six-bladed propellers and better insulation, it has reduced noise levels. The newest version has CATII capability and dual Honeywell HT1000 FMS installation.

=== ATR 42-600 ===

During October 2007, the launch of the ATR 42-600 series was announced. Akin to the ATR 72-500, the -600 series featured the PW127M as its standard engine (providing 5% additional thrust, thus improving performance on short runways, in hot weather, and at high altitude); the &quot;boost function&quot; activates the additional power as needed. It also features a glass cockpit flight deck, complete with five wide LCD screens, that replaced the previous electronic flight instrument system; additionally, a multipurpose computer enhances flight safety and operational capabilities. Avionics supplied by Thales provides CAT III and required navigation performance capabilities. It also includes lighter, more comfortable seats and larger overhead baggage bins. According to the third issue of its EASA&#x27;s Type Certificate, ATR 42-600 is ATR&#x27;s marketing designation for the -500 series when fitted with the new avionics suite) or &quot;glass Cockpit&quot;. The ATR 42-600 designation is not recognised by EASA as a certified aircraft model or variant, and is not used on ATR certified/approved documentation; instead, only &quot;Mod 5948&quot;, &quot;ATR 42-500 with Mod 5948&quot;, &quot;ATR 42-500 fitted with NAS&quot;, or &quot;ATR 42-500 600 version&quot; is used.

=== ATR 42-600S ===

The ATR 42-600S is the STOL (short takeoff and landing) variant of the -600. The aircraft is capable of operating from runways as short as with up to 34 passengers, and fully seated (48 passengers) on short routes. ATR launched the ATR 42-600S at the ERA General Assembly, with 20 commitments including from Elix Aviation Capital (10 aircraft) and Air Tahiti (two aircraft). Certification is expected for the second half of 2022 before first delivery.

=== ATR 42-600/-600S HighLine Edition ===
The ATR 42-600 and ATR 42-600S HighLine had an executive cabin layout, otherwise it is the same as its original counterpart.

=== Other versions ===
; Cargo variant:
Bulk (tube versions) and ULD freighter (large cargo door). An STC exists to convert all ATR-42 variants to all-cargo transport aircraft. FedEx, UPS, and DHL are major operators of the type.

; ATR Surveyor:
The ATR-42 &quot;Surveyor&quot; is a maritime patrol version of the -400.

; Others:
VIP transport and in-flight inspection versions of the -500 also exist.

<doc id="346381" wikidata="Q185086" url="?curid=346381" title="Crown Dependencies">
<text>The Crown Dependencies are three offshore island territories in the British Islands that are self-governing possessions of the British Crown: the Bailiwick of Guernsey and the Bailiwick of Jersey, both located in the English Channel and together known as the Channel Islands, and the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea between Great Britain and Ireland.

They are closely related to the countries of the United Kingdom (UK), although they are not part of them. They have the status of &quot;territories for which the United Kingdom is responsible&quot;, rather than sovereign states. As a result, they are not member states of the Commonwealth of Nations. However, they do have relationships with the Commonwealth and other international organisations, and are members of the British–Irish Council. They have their own teams in the Commonwealth Games.

Each island&#x27;s political development has been largely independent from, though often parallel with, that of the UK, and they are akin to &quot;miniature states with wide powers of self-government&quot;.

As the Crown Dependencies are not sovereign states, the power to pass legislation affecting the islands ultimately rests with the King-in-Council (though this power is rarely exercised without the consent of the dependencies, and the right to do so is disputed). However, they each have their own legislative assembly, with power to legislate on many local matters with the assent of the Crown (the Privy Council, or, in the case of the Isle of Man, in certain circumstances the lieutenant-governor or, in the case of the Bailiwick of Guernsey, the Lieutenant-Governor). In Jersey and the Isle of Man, the head of government is called the chief minister. In Guernsey, the head representative of the committee-based government is the President of the Policy and Resources Committee.

== Terminology ==
The term &#x27;Crown Dependencies&#x27; has been disputed by Gavin St Pier, former Chief Minister of Guernsey. He argues that the term was an administrative invention of Whitehall, which incorrectly implies that the islands are dependent upon the Crown, and advocates instead the use of the term &#x27;Crown Dominion&#x27;.

== List of Crown Dependencies ==

=== Channel Islands ===

Since 1290, the Channel Islands have been governed as:

* the Bailiwick of Guernsey, comprising the islands of Alderney, Brecqhou, Guernsey, Herm, Jethou, Lihou, and Sark;
* the Bailiwick of Jersey, comprising the island of Jersey and uninhabited islets such as the Écréhous and Minquiers.

Each Bailiwick is a Crown dependency and each is headed by a Bailiff, with a Lieutenant Governor representing the Crown in each Bailiwick. Each Bailiwick has its own legal and healthcare systems and its own separate immigration policy, with &quot;local status&quot; in one Bailiwick having no validity in the other. The two Bailiwicks exercise bilateral double taxation treaties. Since 1961, the Bailiwicks have had separate courts of appeal, but generally, the Bailiff of each Bailiwick has been appointed to serve on the panel of appellate judges for the other Bailiwick.

====Bailiwick of Guernsey====

The Bailiwick of Guernsey comprises three separate jurisdictions:

* Alderney, including smaller surrounding uninhabited islands.
* Guernsey, which also includes the nearby islands of Herm, Jethou, Lihou, and other smaller uninhabited islands.
* Sark, which also includes the nearby island of Brecqhou, and other smaller uninhabited islands.

The parliament of Guernsey is the States of Deliberation, the parliament of Sark is called the Chief Pleas, and the parliament of Alderney is called the States of Alderney. The three parliaments together can also approve joint Bailiwick-wide legislation that applies in those parts of the Bailiwick whose parliaments approve it. There are no political parties in any of the parliaments; candidates stand for election as independents.

====Bailiwick of Jersey====

The Bailiwick of Jersey consists of the island of Jersey and a number of surrounding uninhabited islands.

The parliament is the States Assembly, the first known mention of which is in a document of 1497. The &quot;States of Jersey Law 2005&quot; introduced the post of Chief Minister of Jersey, abolished the Bailiff&#x27;s power of dissent to a resolution of the States and the Lieutenant Governor&#x27;s power of veto over a resolution of the States, and established that any Order in Council or Act of the United Kingdom proposed to apply to Jersey must be referred to the States so that the States can express their views on it. There are few political parties, as candidates generally stand for election as independents.

===Isle of Man===


The Isle of Man&#x27;s Tynwald claims to be the world&#x27;s oldest parliament in continuous existence, dating back to 979. (However, it does not claim to be the oldest parliament, as Iceland&#x27;s Althing dates back to 930.) It consists of a popularly elected House of Keys and an indirectly elected Legislative Council. These two branches may sit separately or jointly to consider pieces of legislation, which, when passed into law, are known as &quot;Acts of Tynwald&quot;. Candidates mostly stand for election to the Keys as independents, rather than being selected by political parties. There is a Council of Ministers headed by a chief minister.

Unlike the other Crown Dependencies, the Isle of Man has a Common Purse Agreement with the United Kingdom.

== City status ==
As overseas territories were added to the land conquered by the British, a number of towns and villages began to request formal recognition to validate their importance, and would be accorded a status if deemed to be deserving such as a borough or as a more prestigious city by the monarch. Many cities were designated over several centuries, and as Anglican dioceses began to be created the process of city creation became aligned to that used in England, being linked to the presence of a cathedral.

Despite this, St Patrick&#x27;s Isle adjoining the Isle of Man, which had a medieval cathedral, was never granted privileges of a city. What is now Peel Cathedral was later built nearby, but only raised to the status of a cathedral in the 1980s.

The Channel Islands were at first part of a mainland French diocese, and then came under the Bishop of Winchester after the English Reformation. These islands had no cathedral.

Since the year 2000, the UK government has arranged competitions to grant city status to settlements. In 2021, submissions for city status were invited to mark the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II, with Crown Dependencies and British Overseas Territories being allowed to take part for the first time. In the Dependencies, the only applicants were Douglas and Peel, both on the Isle of Man, and Douglas was granted the honour, making it the first formal city.

==Constitutional status==

According to the 1973 Kilbrandon Report, the Crown Dependencies are &quot;like miniature states&quot;. According to a 2010 Commons Justice Committee, they are independent from the UK and from each other and their relationship is with the Crown. The UK&#x27;s responsibilities derive from that fact.

All &quot;insular&quot; legislation has to receive the approval of the &quot;King in Council&quot;, in effect, the Privy Council in London. Certain types of domestic legislation in the Isle of Man and the Bailiwick of Guernsey, however, may be signed into law by the Lieutenant Governor, using delegated powers, without having to pass through the Privy Council. In Jersey, provisional legislation of an administrative nature may be adopted by means of &quot;triennial regulations&quot; (renewable after three years), without requiring the assent of the Privy Council. Much legislation, in practice, is effected by means of secondary legislation under the authority of prior laws or Orders in Council.

A unique constitutional position has arisen in the Channel Islands as successive monarchs have confirmed the liberties and privileges of the Bailiwicks, often referring to the so-called &quot;Constitutions of King John&quot;, a legendary document supposed to have been granted by King John in the aftermath of 1204. Governments of the Bailiwicks have generally tried to avoid testing the limits of the unwritten constitution by avoiding conflict with British governments. Following the restoration of King Charles II, who had spent part of his exile in Jersey, the Channel Islands were given the right to set their own customs duties, referred to by the Jersey Legal French term as .

=== The Crown ===

The monarch is represented by a Lieutenant Governor in each Crown dependency, but this post is largely ceremonial. Since 2010 the Lieutenant Governors of each Crown dependency have been recommended to the Crown by a panel in each respective Crown dependency; this replaced the previous system of the appointments being made by the Crown on the recommendation of UK ministers. In 2005, it was decided in the Isle of Man to replace the Lieutenant Governor with a Crown Commissioner, but this decision was reversed before it was implemented.

==== The Crown in the Isle of Man ====

&quot;The Crown&quot; is defined differently in each Crown Dependency. Legislation of the Isle of Man defines the &quot;Crown in right of the Isle of Man&quot; as being separate from the &quot;Crown in right of the United Kingdom&quot;. In the Isle of Man the British monarch is styled Lord of Mann, a title variously held by Norse, Scottish and English kings and nobles (the English nobles in fealty to the English Crown) until it was revested into the British monarchy in 1765. The title &quot;Lord&quot; is today used irrespective of the gender of the person who holds it.

==== The Crown in the Channel Islands ====
The Channel Islands are part of the territory annexed by the Duchy of Normandy in 933 from the Duchy of Brittany. This territory was added to the grant of land given in settlement by the King of France in 911 to the Viking raiders who had sailed up the Seine almost to the walls of Paris. William the Conqueror, Duke of Normandy, claimed the title King of England in 1066, following the death of Edward the Confessor, and secured the claim through the Norman conquest of England. Subsequent marriages between Kings of England and French nobles meant that Kings of England had title to more French lands than the King of France. When the King of France asserted his feudal right of patronage, the then-King of England, King John, fearing he would be imprisoned should he attend, failed to fulfill his obligation.

In 1204, the title and lands of the Duchy of Normandy and his other French possessions were stripped from King John of England by the King of France. The Channel Islands remained in the possession of the King of England, who ruled them as Duke of Normandy until the Treaty of Paris in 1259. John&#x27;s son, Henry III, renounced the title of Duke of Normandy by that treaty, and none of his successors ever revived it. The Channel Islands continued to be governed by the Kings of England as French fiefs, distinct from Normandy, until the Hundred Years&#x27; War, during which they were definitively separated from France. At no time did the Channel Islands form part of the Kingdom of England, and they remained legally separate, though under the same monarch, through the subsequent unions of England with Wales (1536), Scotland (1707) and Ireland (1801).

Charles III reigns over the Channel Islands directly, and not by virtue of his role as monarch of the United Kingdom. No specific title is associated with his role as monarch of the Channel Islands. The monarch has been described, in Jersey, as the &quot;King in right of Jersey&quot;, and in legislation as the &quot;Sovereign of the Bailiwick of Jersey&quot; and &quot;Sovereign in right of the Bailiwick of Jersey&quot;.

In Jersey, statements in the 21st century of the constitutional position by the Law Officers of the Crown define it as the &quot;Crown in right of Jersey&quot;, with all Crown land in the Bailiwick of Jersey belonging to the Crown in right of Jersey and not to the Crown Estate of the United Kingdom. In Guernsey, legislation refers to the &quot;Crown in right of the Bailiwick&quot;, and the Law Officers of the Crown of Guernsey submitted that &quot;The Crown in this context ordinarily means the Crown in right of the of the Bailiwick of Guernsey&quot; and that this comprises &quot;the collective governmental and civic institutions, established by and under the authority of the Monarch, for the governance of these Islands, including the States of Guernsey and legislatures in the other Islands, the Royal Court and other courts, the Lieutenant Governor, Parish authorities, and the Crown acting in and through the Privy Council.&quot; This constitutional concept is also worded as the &quot;Crown in right of the Bailiwick of Guernsey&quot;.

===Distinction from Overseas Territories===

Crown Dependencies and British Overseas Territories (BOTs) share a similar geopolitical status. They are both categories of self-governing territories which fall under British sovereignty (the Head of State being the King of the United Kingdom) and for which the UK is responsible internationally. Neither Crown Dependencies nor BOTs are part of the UK and neither send representatives to the UK Parliament.

However, Crown Dependencies are distinct from BOTs. Unlike BOTs, which are remnants of the British Empire, the Crown Dependencies have a much older relationship with the UK, springing from their status as &quot;feudatory kingdoms&quot; subject to the English Crown. The self-governing status of the BOTs evolved through Acts of Parliament and the creation of fairly homogeneous political structures. On the other hand, the political systems of the Crown Dependencies evolved in an ad hoc manner, resulting in particular and unique political structures in each dependency.

==Relationship with the UK==

The United Kingdom, Crown Dependencies and British Overseas Territories collectively form &quot;one, undivided realm&quot; under the British monarchy. Crown Dependencies have the international status of &quot;territories for which the United Kingdom is responsible&quot; rather than sovereign states. The relationship between the governments of the Crown Dependencies and the UK is &quot;one of mutual respect and support, i.e. a partnership&quot;. There is a significant gap between the official and operational relationship between the UK and the islands.

Until 2001, responsibility for the UK Government&#x27;s relationships with the Crown dependencies rested with the Home Office, but it was then transferred first to the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s Department, then to the Department for Constitutional Affairs, and finally to the Ministry of Justice. In 2010, the Ministry of Justice stated that relationships with the Crown Dependencies are the responsibility of the United Kingdom Government as a whole, with the Ministry of Justice holding responsibility for the constitutional relationship and other ministries engaging with their opposite numbers in the Crown Dependencies according to their respective policy areas.

The UK Government is solely responsible for defence and international representation (although, in accordance with 2007 framework agreements, the UK has elected not to act internationally on behalf of the Crown Dependencies without prior consultation). The Crown Dependencies are within the Common Travel Area and apply the same visa policy as the UK, but each Crown dependency has responsibility for its own customs and immigration services.

As in England, but not the United Kingdom as a whole, the Church of England is the established Church in the Isle of Man, Guernsey and Jersey.

The constitutional and cultural proximity of the islands to the UK means that there are shared institutions and organisations. The BBC, for example, has local radio stations in the Channel Islands, and also a website run by a team based in the Isle of Man (which is included in BBC North West). Similarly, ITV Channel Television is a franchise in the UK&#x27;s ITV network, while the Isle of Man falls within the ITV Granada franchise area. While the islands now assume responsibility for their own post and telecommunications, they continue to participate in the UK telephone numbering plan, and they have adopted postcode systems that are compatible with that of the UK.

The growth of offshore finance in all three territories led to a &quot;conflictual relationship&quot; with the UK governments of the 2000s.

The Crown Dependencies, together with the United Kingdom, are collectively known as the British Islands. Since the British Nationality Act 1981 came into effect, they have been treated as part of the United Kingdom for British nationality law purposes. However, each Crown dependency maintains local controls over housing and employment, with special rules applying to British citizens without specified connections to that Crown dependency (as well as to non-British citizens).

Parliament Square, at the northwest end of the Palace of Westminster in the City of Westminster in central London, features all of the British flags alined: the flags of the United Kingdom, those of its four nations, the county flags of these nations, the three flags of the Crown Dependencies and the sixteen heraldic shields of the British Overseas Territories.

On 15 May 2023, the three coats of arms of the Crown Dependencies and the sixteen heraldic shields of the British Overseas Territories, were &#x27;immortalised&#x27; in two new stained glass windows unveiled in the Speaker&#x27;s House at the New Palace of Westminster. The Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, said: &quot;The two windows represent part of our United Kingdom family&quot;.

=== International representation ===

For the purposes of international agreements, the islands were considered part of the British metropolitan territory until a declaration was agreed in 1950 that henceforth the three territories would be considered distinct from the UK and each other.

In 2007–2008, each Crown Dependency and the UK signed agreements that established frameworks for the development of the international identity of each Crown Dependency. Among the points clarified in the agreements were that:

*The UK has no democratic accountability in and for the Crown Dependencies, which are governed by their own democratically elected assemblies;
*The UK will not act internationally on behalf of the Crown Dependencies without prior consultation;
*Each Crown Dependency has an international identity that is different from that of the UK;
*The UK supports the principle of each Crown Dependency further developing its international identity;
*The UK recognises that the interests of each Crown Dependency may differ from those of the UK, and the UK will seek to represent any differing interests when acting in an international capacity; and
*The UK and each Crown Dependency will work together to resolve or clarify any differences that may arise between their respective interests.

While the Parliament of the United Kingdom has the power to legislate for the Crown Dependencies without prior consultation, the United Kingdom is expected to seek permission from the dependencies before doing so.

Generally speaking, the British government will only extend international agreements to the Crown Dependencies with their permission. Under international law, the British government is responsible for ensuring the dependencies comply with any treaties that extend to them.

=== Legislative independence ===
Acts of the UK Parliament do not usually apply to the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, unless explicitly stated. UK legislation does not ordinarily extend to them without their consent. For a UK Act to extend otherwise than by an Order in Council is now very unusual. The States of Jersey Law 2005 and subsequently the 2019 amended version of &quot;The Reform (Guernsey) Law, 1948&quot;, established that all Acts of Parliament and Orders in Council which have application to either island were to be referred to their respective States assemblies for debate before registration in their Royal Court.

When deemed advisable, Acts of Parliament may be extended to the islands by means of an Order in Council (thus giving the UK Government some responsibility for good governance in the islands). An example of this was the Television Act 1954, which was extended to the Channel Islands, so as to create a local ITV franchise, known as Channel Television. By constitutional convention this is only done at the request of the insular authorities, and has become a rare option (thus giving the insular authorities themselves the responsibility for good governance in the islands); the islands usually prefer nowadays to pass their own versions of laws giving effect to international treaties.

Each dependency retains its own distinct law and legal system. The Channel Islands&#x27; law systems are founded in the traditions of Norman law. For all three states, there is a right of judicial appeal to the Crown via the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, whose judgements are binding once approved and promulgated by the King via an Order-in-Council.

Westminster retains the right to legislate for the islands against their will as a last resort, but this is also rarely exercised, and may, according to legal opinion from the Attorney-General of Jersey, have fallen into desuetude – although the Department for Constitutional Affairs did not accept this argument. The Marine, &amp;c., Broadcasting (Offences) Act 1967 was one recent piece of legislation extended to the Isle of Man against the wishes of Tynwald.

There are many highly authoritative assertions of Parliament&#x27;s sovereignty over Jersey, such as the 1861 Civil Commissioners. According to the Kilbrandon Report, the long-standing convention against Parliament intervening in domestic matters did not limit Parliament&#x27;s authority to legislate for the Crown Dependencies without consent. Baroness Hale further asserted this legal opinion in 2014 (quotation above), though she did not hear arguments from Crown Dependency governments in that case.

Conversely, Jeffrey Jowell argues that Parliament&#x27;s powers are &quot;of last resort&quot; and do not therefore constitute paramount power to intervene in the Dependencies&#x27; internal affairs. He argues that as the powers have always been used within the limits of their justification, these have become constitutional law. Henry John Stephen argued that, as the Duchy of Normandy conquered England and its territory has never been annexed into England, the level of parliamentary sovereignty exercised elsewhere in the British Empire may not apply to the Channel Islands.

=== Royal prerogative ===

The UK Government has a monopoly on advising how the royal prerogative – such as giving royal assent to Channel Islands&#x27; legislation – should be exercised in the Crown Dependencies. Gavin St Pier, former Chief Minister of Guernsey, has called in 2023 for the Channel Islands to reconsider their constitutional relationship with the UK, &quot;making us less susceptible to whimsical breach of conventions should the UK continue to convulse politically&quot;. He called for the Islands to have more power of the exercise of the royal prerogative by their appointment of Privy Counsellors.

==International relations==
=== Commonwealth ===

While their constitutional status bears some resemblance to that of the Commonwealth realms, the Crown Dependencies are not independent members of the Commonwealth of Nations. They participate in the Commonwealth of Nations by virtue of their relationship with the United Kingdom, and participate in various Commonwealth institutions in their own right. For example, all three participate in the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and the Commonwealth Games.

All three Crown Dependencies regard the existing situation as unsatisfactory and have lobbied for change. The States of Jersey have called on the British Foreign Secretary to request that the Commonwealth Heads of Government &quot;consider granting associate membership to Jersey and the other Crown Dependencies as well as any other territories at a similarly advanced stage of autonomy&quot;. Jersey has proposed that it be accorded &quot;self-representation in all Commonwealth meetings; full participation in debates and procedures, with a right to speak where relevant and the opportunity to enter into discussions with those who are full members; and no right to vote in the Ministerial or Heads of Government meetings, which is reserved for full members&quot;. The States of Guernsey and the Government of the Isle of Man have made calls of a similar nature for a more integrated relationship with the Commonwealth, including more direct representation and enhanced participation in Commonwealth organisations and meetings, including Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings. The Chief Minister of the Isle of Man has said: &quot;A closer connection with the Commonwealth itself would be a welcome further development of the Island&#x27;s international relationships&quot;

=== European Union ===
The Crown Dependencies have never been EU member states, including during the period when the UK was. During that time, their relationship with the EU was governed by Protocol 3 of the European Communities Act 1972. The Dependencies were part of the EU customs territory (though only the Isle of Man was in the VAT area) and took part in the free movements of goods, but not the free movement of persons, services or capital. The Common Agricultural Policy of the EU never applied to the Crown Dependencies, and their citizens never took part in elections to the European Parliament. Although they were still European citizens, British citizens who had a connection to the Crown Dependencies only were not entitled to freedom of movement rights.

With the Brexit negotiations, the House of Lords produced a report titled &quot;Brexit: the Crown Dependencies&quot;, which stated that the &quot;UK Government must continue to fulfil its constitutional obligations to represent the interests of the Crown Dependencies in international relations, even where these differ from those of the UK, both during the Brexit negotiations and beyond.&quot; In the &quot;Great Repeal Bill&quot; white paper published on 30 March 2017 the UK government stated, &quot;The Government is committed to engaging with the Crown Dependencies, Gibraltar and the other Overseas Territories as we leave the EU.&quot;

The most contentious Brexit issue was an upset to the arrangement of fishing rights of fishermen from France, Jersey, or Guernsey who wished to fish in the territorial waters of a different jurisdiction; proof of historic fishing in the jurisdiction was required in order to obtain a fishing permit, but all communications on the matter had to be routed via national or EU officials in London, Paris, or Brussels, leading to delays. This was resolved after officials in the affected French regions were allowed to communicate directly to counterparts in Guernsey and Jersey.

The UK requirement for EU citizens to present passports to enter the Common Travel Area resulted in a drop of day visitors to Jersey in particular. This issue was resolved in 2022 when Jersey (with UK approval) began to allow French nationals to enter the bailiwick on day trips using just their national ID card. Guernsey followed suit.

==Common Travel Area==

All three Crown Dependencies participate in an open borders area, along with the United Kingdom and Ireland. An informal memorandum of understanding exists between the member countries of the Common Travel Area (CTA) whereby the internal borders of each country are expected to have minimal controls, if any, and can normally be crossed by British and Irish citizens with minimal identity documents (with certain exceptions). Under Irish law, Manx people and Channel Islanderswho were not entitled to take advantage of the European Union&#x27;s freedom of movement provisionsare exempt from immigration control and immune from deportation.

In May 2019, the British and Irish governments signed a Memorandum of Understanding in an effort to secure the rights of British and Irish citizens after Brexit. The document was signed in London, England before a meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, putting the rights of both countries&#x27; citizens, that were already in place under an informal agreement, on a more secure footing.

The agreement, which is the culmination of over two years&#x27; work of both governments, means the rights of both countries&#x27; citizens are protected after Brexit whilst also ensuring that Ireland can continue to meet its obligations under European Union law. The agreement took effect on 31 January 2020 when the United Kingdom left the European Union. The maintenance of the CTA involves considerable cooperation on immigration matters between the British and Irish authorities.

== Customs Union ==

On 26 November 2018 Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man each signed a customs agreement with the United Kingdom to collectively establish a customs union.

On 31 January 2020 the UK–Crown Dependencies Customs Union was officially established.

In 2020 the UK Government made the Customs (Tariff Quotas) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020. These regulations apply in modified form in the Crown Dependencies.

<text>Image analysis or imagery analysis is the extraction of meaningful information from images; mainly from digital images by means of digital image processing techniques. Image analysis tasks can be as simple as reading bar coded tags or as sophisticated as identifying a person from their face.

Computers are indispensable for the analysis of large amounts of data, for tasks that require complex computation, or for the extraction of quantitative information. On the other hand, the human visual cortex is an excellent image analysis apparatus, especially for extracting higher-level information, and for many applications — including medicine, security, and remote sensing — human analysts still cannot be replaced by computers. For this reason, many important image analysis tools such as edge detectors and neural networks are inspired by human visual perception models.

==Digital==
Digital Image Analysis or Computer Image Analysis is when a computer or electrical device automatically studies an image to obtain useful information from it. Note that the device is often a computer but may also be an electrical circuit, a digital camera or a mobile phone. 
It involves the fields of computer or machine vision, and medical imaging, and makes heavy use of pattern recognition, digital geometry, and signal processing. This field of computer science developed in the 1950s at academic institutions such as the MIT A.I. Lab, originally as a branch of artificial intelligence and robotics.

It is the quantitative or qualitative characterization of two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) digital images. 2D images are, for example, to be analyzed in computer vision, and 3D images in medical imaging. The field was established in the 1950s—1970s, for example with pioneering contributions by Azriel Rosenfeld, Herbert Freeman, Jack E. Bresenham, or King-Sun Fu.

==Techniques==
There are many different techniques used in automatically analysing images. Each technique may be useful for a small range of tasks, however there still aren&#x27;t any known methods of image analysis that are generic enough for wide ranges of tasks, compared to the abilities of a human&#x27;s image analysing capabilities. Examples of image analysis techniques in different fields include:
* 2D and 3D object recognition,
* image segmentation, 
* motion detection e.g. Single particle tracking, 
* video tracking, 
* optical flow, 
* medical scan analysis, 
* 3D Pose Estimation.

==Applications==
The applications of digital image analysis are continuously expanding through all areas of science and industry, including:
*anatomy, allows for precise measurements, visualization, and statistical analysis of anatomical structures.
*assay micro plate reading, such as detecting where a chemical was manufactured.
*astronomy, such as calculating the size of a planet.
*automated species identification (e.g. plant and animal species)
*defense
*error level analysis
*filtering 
*machine vision, such as to automatically count items in a factory conveyor belt.
*materials science, such as determining if a metal weld has cracks. 
*medicine, such as detecting cancer in a mammography scan.
*metallography, such as determining the mineral content of a rock sample.
*microscopy, such as counting the germs in a swab.
*automatic number plate recognition;
*optical character recognition, such as automatic license plate detection.
*remote sensing, such as detecting intruders in a house, and producing land cover/land use maps.
*robotics, such as to avoid steering into an obstacle.
*security, such as detecting a person&#x27;s eye color or hair color. 
==Object-based==

Object-based image analysis (OBIA) involves two typical processes, segmentation and classification. Segmentation helps to group pixels into homogeneous objects. The objects typically correspond to individual features of interest, although over-segmentation or under-segmentation is very likely. Classification then can be performed at object levels, using various statistics of the objects as features in the classifier. Statistics can include geometry, context and texture of image objects. Over-segmentation is often preferred over under-segmentation when classifying high-resolution images.

Object-based image analysis has been applied in many fields, such as cell biology, medicine, earth sciences, and remote sensing. For example, it can detect changes of cellular shapes in the process of cell differentiation.; it has also been widely used in the mapping community to generate land cover.

When applied to earth images, OBIA is known as &quot;geographic object-based image analysis&quot; (GEOBIA), defined as &quot;a sub-discipline of geoinformation science devoted to (...) partitioning remote sensing (RS) imagery into meaningful image-objects, and assessing their characteristics through spatial, spectral and temporal scale&quot;.
The international GEOBIA conference has been held biannually since 2006.

OBIA techniques are implemented in software such as eCognition or the Orfeo toolbox.

<text>Rrok Kolë Mirdita (28 September 1939 – 7 December 2015) was an Albanian prelate of the Catholic Church who served as the archbishop of Tiranë-Durrës from 1993 to his death in 2015.

== Biography ==

Mirdita was ordained a priest on 2 July 1965, aged 25, and served in ethnic Albanian parishes in Bronx and Westchester counties of New York.

On 25 December 1992, aged 53, he was appointed the archbishop of Tiranë-Durrës and consecrated on 25 April 1993 by Pope John Paul II and cardinals Camillo Ruini and Jozef Tomko, along with three other bishops (Zef Simoni, and Robert Ashta) during the Pope&#x27;s pastoral visit to Albania. Mirdita was the President of the Episcopal Conference of Albania, as well as the President of Caritas Albania from 1994 to 2000.

On his initiative St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral was built in Tirana. Its triangular architecture, according to the Archbishop&#x27;s idea, symbolizes the cohabitation of Islam, Eastern Orthodoxy and Catholicism in Albania. The first Holy Mass in the new cathedral was celebrated by Cardinal Angelo Sodano, Vatican&#x27;s Secretary of State, and Archbishop Mirdita on 27 January 2002. The Archbishop&#x27;s house was built next to the Eastern Orthodox cathedral and on Christmas 1999, Mirdita and the Eastern Orthodox Archbishop Anastasios (Anastas) greeted parishioners together. Rrok Mirdita was an Honorary Citizen of Tirana, Albania.

He died at Mother Teresa Hospital in Tirana on 7 December 2015.

<text>Franz Ketterer (1676–1749) was an early Black Forest clockmaker from Schönwald im Schwarzwald in Germany. According to historians, he was one of several possible inventors of the cuckoo clock, although historical records from this period are scarce and often conflicting, and no cuckoo clock made by Ketterer can be found today. In his 1976 book Gerd Bender suggested that Franz Ketterer invented prototype cuckoo clocks in 1730. Others have suggested that the cuckoo clock was invented around 1735, 1737, or 1738.

According to author Karl Kochmann, Franz Ketterer and his wife Anna (née Winterhalder) had nine children; their youngest child and only son was born in 1734. Named Franz Anton Ketterer, he also became a clockmaker.

In 1993, the renovated festival hall in Schönwald was dedicated to Franz Ketterer and named the Uhrmacher-Ketterer-Halle. The Black Forest Museum in Schönwald offers information about how Ketterer may have come to invent the cuckoo clock.

<text>A point of presence (PoP) is an artificial demarcation point or network interface point between communicating entities. A common example is an ISP point of presence, the local access point that allows users to connect to the Internet with their Internet service provider (ISP). A PoP typically houses servers, routers, network switches, multiplexers, and other network interface equipment, and is typically located in a data center. ISPs typically have multiple PoPs. PoPs are often located at Internet exchange points and colocation centres.

In the US, this term became important during the court-ordered breakup of the Bell Telephone system. A point of presence was a location where a long-distance carrier (IXC) could terminate services and provide connections into a local telephone network (LATA).

<text>Easy Finder () was a weekly Chinese tabloid magazine which was first published on 13 September 1991 in Hong Kong. Published by Next Media Limited which is owned by Jimmy Lai. It stopped publishing on 23 May 2007. &quot;Easy Finder&quot; was commonly known to participate in Yellow journalism (ex. hidden cameras, aggressive pursuit, harassment, etc.) in collecting story ideas.

==History==
Initially, &quot;Easy Finder&quot; was a free supplementary booklet of &quot;Next Magazine&quot; which mainly provides information on new products. There was a section of job vacancy ads (青雲路) and a section of classified ads. The name of the magazine gives hints that it is originally more an information guide than a normal magazine. It became a separate magazine in 1991. The target readership of &quot;Easy Finder&quot; are youth and students.

Apart from &quot;Easy Finder&quot;, two additional publications (Eat and Travel Weekly (飲食男女) and Trading Express/Auto Express) (交易通/搵車快線) are included free of charge. Those three booklets cover the latest trends, for instance, fashion, hot gossip, horoscopes, food, fitness, etc. The average net circulation per issue reached 118,720 (1 April – 30 June 2003) according to Hong Kong Audit Bureau of Circulations.

&quot;Easy Finder&quot; published its last issue (No 800) on 22 May 2007. &quot;Eat and Travel Weekly&quot; and &quot;Trading Express/Auto Express&quot; continue to published and are included from issue No 801 with FACE Weekly, a new magazine under the same stable of Next Media. The official website of &quot;Easy Finder&quot; is now re-diverted to FACE Weekly&#x27;s new website.

==Magazine sections==
There are twelve sections in &quot;Easy Finder&quot;:
#Ji Zone (激 Zone) (hot gossips)
#Easy Girl (pin-up girls, models)
#Manhuazuo (漫動作) (comics news)
#Qingyunlu (青雲路) (careers, success stories)
#Touwenzi Evolution (頭文字Evolution) (cars, motors)
#Yuletian (娛樂天) (showbiz)
#Chaoliu Wucun (潮流屋村) (fashion, trends)
#Digi Finder (Digital products)
#Xinli Ceyan (心理測驗) (personality test)
#Zhan Me Life (占 Me Life) (horoscope)
#Bianli Bojing (便利波經) (soccer betting)
#Bianli Zhuweng Guangchang (便利諸嗡廣場) (reader&#x27;s forum)

==Positioning==
To attract teenage readers, this magazine uses a lot of Cantonese colloquial words which are very popular in leisure magazines in Hong Kong. Recent examples are &quot;潮&quot; (fashionable) and &quot;界&quot; (to court someone). The use of colloquial Cantonese words, however, does not comply to traditional or &#x27;correct&#x27; written Chinese grammar.

&quot;Easy Finder&quot; maintains a heavy coverage of entertainment news. Since teenagers in Hong Kong are interested in local entertainment and show business, &quot;Easy Finder&quot; puts a lot of emphasis on entertainment news. Even when some of the reports are just rumours without solidity, they still appear on the cover if they are attractive and sensational enough.

&quot;Easy Finder&quot; is a market-oriented publication which tries to supply for what it perceives to be what young people desire. Images of sexy or even half-naked models appear on the cover. It covers a lot of sensitive topics such as sex, drugs, and even suicide. Reports on crimes such as murder and prostitution are often seen in this magazine. Such negative but shocking topics are the selling points of this magazine and these have undoubtedly attracted young readers.

However, it has also raised strong argument among the society. Many people claim that such awful and sexual pictures and topics will bring serious and harmful effects to the teenagers. This makes &quot;Easy Finder&quot; the most controversial magazine in Hong Kong. A lot of people do not accept the magazine, but the circulation stands.

==Electronic Version==
&quot;Easy Finder&quot; publishes an electronic version via PDA version or via internet. In the electronic version, subscribers have access to not only the latest issue but also previous issues up to Issue 479 (2 April 2001) in archives. PDA format is also available.

==Controversies==
===Valentine&#x27;s day romance guide===
For instance, as a protest to its sex-related articles in the booklet of &quot;情人節浪漫手冊&quot; included in volume 366, Rev. Lo Sek Wai (羅錫為牧師), the chief board member of Goodnews Communication International Ltd (福音傳播中心), urged for a boycott of &quot;Easy Finder&quot; and made a complaint to the Television and Entertainment Licensing Authority.

===Gillian Chung dressing room incident===
On 22 August 2006, Hong Kong tabloid magazine Easy Finder published a series of photos of Gillian Chung inside a changing room after a Twins concert at the Arena of Stars in Genting Highlands, Malaysia. The pictures were taken while she was in the changing room with her personal assistant. One of the cover photos shows Chung&#x27;s bare back as she is fixing her bra backstage. Her breasts are not revealed. A second, smaller cover photo shows Chung undressed and naked from the shoulder up. Hong Kong celebrities such as Jackie Chan staged a public protest denouncing the magazine&#x27;s irresponsible actions.

The Hong Kong Television and Entertainment Licensing Authority received 2,875 complaints regarding the revealing photos and the incident was referred to the Obscene Articles Tribunal for further action. On 1 November 2006, Easy Finder lost its appeal against an obscenity ruling on the published article and pictures. In the appeal, a panel consisting of one Magistrate and four lay members, upheld the judgement, branding the article obscene, and saying it was a &quot;calculated act of selling sexuality which is corrupting and revolting&quot;. During an interview of Jimmy Lai (founder of Next Media, Easy Finder&#x27;s publisher) on the television show Be My Guest, he apologized to Gillian and claimed that he will return all the negatives of the photos.

<doc id="346414" wikidata="Q1138279" url="?curid=346414" title="Associated state">
<text>An associated state is the minor partner or dependent territory in a formal, free relationship between a political territory (some of them dependent states, most of them fully sovereign) and a major party—usually a larger state.

The details of such free association are contained in United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1541 (XV) Principle VI, a Compact of Free Association or Associated Statehood Act and are specific to the countries involved. In the case of the Cook Islands and Niue, the details of their free association arrangement are contained in several documents, such as their respective constitutions, the 1983 Exchange of Letters between the governments of New Zealand and the Cook Islands, and the 2001 Joint Centenary Declaration. Free associated states can be described as independent or not, but free association is not a qualification of an entity&#x27;s statehood or status as a subject of international law.

Informally it can be considered more widely: from a post-colonial form of amical protection, or protectorate, to a confederation of unequal members when the lesser partners delegate to the major one (often the former colonial power) some authority normally exclusively retained by a sovereign state, usually in such fields as defence and foreign relations, while often enjoying favourable economic terms such as market access.

==Origin of the concept==
The concept of associated state was originally used to refer to arrangements under which Western powers afforded a (sometimes very limited) degree of self-government to some of their colonial possessions after the end of World War II. Soon after the conclusion of the war, the French colonial territories of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos were designated as &#x27;associated states&#x27; within the newly created French Union. The arrangement afforded these countries a limited degree of internal and external sovereignty (for example, they were allowed to enter into diplomatic relations with a small number of countries), but for the most part reserved for France effective control over foreign relations, as well as military, judicial, administrative, and economic activities. According to some French jurists, the concept of associated state under the 1946 French constitution automatically extended to the territories of Morocco and Tunisia, which up until then had been protectorates of France. However, unlike their counterparts in Southeast Asia, neither Morocco nor Tunisia became part of the French Union. The associated state concept as applied to former French colonial possessions has been described as &#x27;neo-colonial&#x27; as it did not afford them real internal or external sovereignty. All of the aforementioned associated states eventually became fully independent states.

Puerto Rico has been a dependent territory of the United States since the Spanish–American War. In the Spanish-language version of its current (1952) constitution it is officially named , which translates to &quot;Free Associated State of Puerto Rico.&quot; It exercises substantial internal self-government similar to U.S. states, and is under the sovereignty of the U.S. Constitution. Unlike the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and Palau, Puerto Rico is not considered to be an associated state under U.S. domestic law, with the English-language Puerto Rican constitution referring to it as a &#x27;commonwealth.&#x27; The official Spanish name of Puerto Rico can lead observers to believe that its political status is equivalent to that of the associated states of the Cook Islands, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Niue, and Palau. However, unlike these polities, Puerto Rico is not considered a state under international law and scholars usually do not regard it as an associated state similar to the others. Puerto Rico retains the right to choose free association, full independence, or becoming a U.S. state.

When New Zealand offered an associated status to the Cook Islands, they involved the United Nations and included in the agreement the possibility of future independence. These considerations became relevant in later Special Committee on Decolonisation debates on the West Indies Associated States.

==States currently in a formal association==
The Cook Islands and Niue have the status of &quot;self-government in free association&quot;. New Zealand cannot legislate for them, and in some situations they are considered sovereign states. In foreign relations, both interact as sovereign states, and they have been allowed to sign on as a state to United Nations treaties and bodies. Neither has decided to join the UN, as New Zealand has expressed a view that such a move would lead to their loss of right to automatic acquisition of New Zealand citizenship. However, New Zealand has never formally opposed such application, nor has it argued that either country would not be within its sovereign right to do so. Both Niue and the Cook Islands have established their own nationality and immigration regimes.

The Federated States of Micronesia (since 1986), the Marshall Islands (since 1986), and Palau (since 1994) are associated with the United States under what is known as the Compact of Free Association, giving the states international sovereignty and ultimate control over their territory. However, the governments of those areas have agreed to allow the United States to provide defense; the U.S. federal government provides funding grants and access to U.S. social services for citizens of these areas. The United States benefits from its ability to use the islands as strategic military bases.

==Former associated states==
A formal association existed under the West Indies Act 1967 between the United Kingdom and the six West Indies Associated States. These were former British colonies in the Caribbean: Antigua (1967–1981), Dominica (1967–1978), Grenada (1967–1974), Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla (1967–1983), Saint Lucia (1967–1979), and Saint Vincent (1969–1979). Under this arrangement, each state had internal self-government, but the UK retained responsibility for foreign relations and defence. The United Nations never determined whether these associated states had achieved a full measure of self-government within the meaning of the United Nations Charter and General Assembly resolutions. Within a few years after the status of associated state was created, all six of the former associated states requested and were granted full independence, except for Anguilla within the former St. Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla union, which separated from the associated state before independence and became a British dependent territory on its own.

Shortly before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Tatar ASSR unilaterally seceded from the Russian SFSR, as the &quot;sovereign state&quot; of Tatarstan and a &quot;subject of international law&quot;. In 1994 Tatarstan and the Russian Federation entered into a treaty specifying that Tatarstan was &quot;associated&quot; with the latter (rather than being an integral part of it). Through the agreement, Tatarstan delegated certain powers (such as some foreign relations and defence) to Russia. Changes made to Tatarstan&#x27;s constitution in 2002 have been seen by some commentators as fundamentally changing this relationship, with Tatarstan now functioning as essentially an integral part of Russia.

==Proposed associated states==
While Puerto Rico is described as a &#x27;free associated state&#x27; under its Spanish-language constitution, its status is not equivalent to that of a separate state under international law, since it legally remains a U.S. territory. Some scholars and politicians have proposed Puerto Rico sign a Compact of Free Association with the U.S. the &quot;soberanista&quot; movement advocates for the territory to be granted a freely associated status. The 2017 status referendum presented &quot;Independence/Free Association&quot; as an option; if the majority of voters had chosen it, a second round of voting would have been held to choose between free association and full independence. In 2022, the US Congress introduced the Puerto Rico Status Act, which would hold a federally-sponsored referendum on the territory&#x27;s status, with a free association status expected to be presented as an option.similar to those in force in the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and Palau. A similar path has been proposed in order to update the political relationship between the Faroe Islands and Denmark, in which the former would become an associated state of the latter.

The government of the U.S. unincorporated territory of Guam, led by then-Governor Eddie Calvo, started campaigning in early 2011 for a plebiscite on Guam&#x27;s future political status, with free association following the model of the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and Palau as one of the possible options. The plebiscite, however, only allowed &quot;native inhabitants&quot; as defined under Guam law to register for it. A white, non-Chamorro resident, Arnold Davis, filed a federal lawsuit in 2011 for being denied registration for the plebiscite and a July 2019 ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ultimately blocked the plebiscite on the basis that the law was race-based and violated constitutionally protected voting rights; the Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear the Government of Guam&#x27;s appeal in May 2020.

In 2003, then-Basque Country president Juan José Ibarretxe proposed to the Spanish Congress of Deputies a reform that would have transformed the region from an autonomous community within Spain into a state in free association, thus making Spain a confederal state. The proposal was overwhelmingly rejected by the Congress.

Tokelau (a dependent territory of New Zealand) voted on a referendum in February 2006 to determine whether it wanted to remain a New Zealand territory or become the third state in free association with New Zealand (after the Cook Islands and Niue). While a majority of voters chose free association, the vote did not meet the two-thirds threshold needed for approval. A similar referendum in October 2007 under United Nations supervision yielded similar results, with the proposed free association falling 16 votes short of approval.

The establishment of a Bangsamoro Juridical Entity (BJE) was proposed in 2008 by the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and the Philippines. The two parties were to sign a memorandum of agreement on ancestral domain which would lead to the establishment of a new autonomous government in the southern Philippines. However the deal was halted by the Supreme Court of the Philippines, which ruled that the BJE&#x27;s proposed &quot;associative relationship&quot; with the Philippine national government was incompatible with the Constitution of the Philippines.

Some form of free association has been suggested as a solution to occasional calls of self-determination by the people of Tobago, the smaller island within the country of Trinidad and Tobago, either within the single state (analogous to the situation of Scotland within the United Kingdom) or as a separate political entity.

According to statements of officials of Abkhazia and Transnistria (self-proclaimed partially recognized republics seceded from the former USSR&#x27;s constituent republics of Georgia and Moldova respectively), both intend, after recognition of their independence, to become associated states of the Russian Federation. In Transnistria a referendum took place in September 2006, in which secession from Moldova and &quot;future free association&quot; with Russia was approved by a margin of 97%, even though the results of the referendum were internationally unrecognised.

==Other comparable relationships==
Other situations exist where one state has power over another political unit. Dependent territories and the United Kingdom&#x27;s Crown dependencies are examples of this, where an area has its own political system and often internal self-government, but does not have overall sovereignty. In a loose form of association, some sovereign states cede some power to other states, often in terms of foreign affairs and defence.

===States currently ceding power to another state===

===States formerly ceding power to another state===
Iceland, formerly part of Denmark, became a nominally sovereign state in 1918. It remained in a personal union with the Danish Crown and continued to have a common foreign policy with Denmark until 1944, when it became fully independent.

Bhutan, a former protectorate of British India, agreed in a 1949 treaty to allow the newly independent India to guide its foreign relations in a relatively loose form of association, which resulted in Bhutan sometimes being described as a &quot;protected state&quot;. This relationship was updated in a 2007 treaty, in which the provision requiring Bhutan to accept India&#x27;s guidance on foreign policy was rescinded.

==Microstates as modern protected states==
The existence of free relationship based on both delegation of sovereignty and benign protection can be seen as a defining feature of microstates. According to the definition of microstates proposed by Dumienski (2014): &quot;Microstates are modern protected states, i.e. sovereign states that have been able to unilaterally depute certain attributes of sovereignty to larger powers in exchange for benign protection of their political and economic viability against their geographic or demographic constraints.&quot; Adopting this approach permits separating microstates from both small states and autonomies or dependencies. Microstates understood as modern protected states may include such states as Liechtenstein, San Marino, Monaco, Vatican City, Andorra, Niue, the Cook Islands, and Palau.

<doc id="346416" wikidata="Q530200" url="?curid=346416" title="Megachilidae">
<text>Megachilidae is a cosmopolitan family of mostly solitary bees. Characteristic traits of this family are the restriction of their pollen-carrying structure (called a &quot;scopa&quot;) to the ventral surface of the abdomen (rather than mostly or exclusively on the hind legs as in other bee families), and their typically elongated labrum. Megachilid genera are most commonly known as [[mason bee]]s and [[megachile|leafcutter bees]], reflecting the materials from which they build their nest cells (soil or leaves, respectively); a few collect plant or animal hairs and fibers, and are called carder bees, while others use plant resins in nest construction and are correspondingly called resin bees. All species feed on nectar and pollen, but a few are kleptoparasites (informally called &quot;cuckoo bees&quot;), feeding on pollen collected by other megachilid bees. Parasitic species do not possess scopae. The motion of Megachilidae in the reproductive structures of flowers is energetic and swimming-like; this agitation releases large amounts of pollen.

==Life cycle==

===Nonparasites===
Nonparasitic Megachilidae typically divide their nests into cells. Each cell receives a supply of food (pollen or a pollen/nectar mix) and an egg; after finding a suitable spot (often near where she emerged), a female starts building a first cell, stocks it, and oviposits. She builds a wall that separates the completed cell from the next one. The larva hatches from the egg and consumes the food supply. After moulting a few times, it spins a cocoon and pupates. It emerges from the nest as an adult. Males die shortly after mating, but females survive for another few weeks, during which they build new nests.

Nests are often built in natural or artificial cavities. Some embed individual cells in a mass of clay or resin attached to a wall, rock surface, or plant stem. Nest cavities are often linear, for example in hollow plant stems, but not always (snail shells are used by some &quot;Osmia&quot;, and some species readily use irregular cavities).

===Parasites===

Some genera of megachilids are brood parasites, so have no ventral scopa (e.g. &quot;Stelis&quot; and &quot;Coelioxys&quot;). They often parasitize related taxa. They typically enter the nest before it is sealed and lay their eggs in a cell. After hatching, the parasite larva kills the host larva, unless the female parasite has already done so, and then consumes the provisions. Parasitic species are of equal size or smaller than their victims. In 1921, the journal &quot;American Museum Novitates&quot; published a preliminary report on parasitic megachilid bees of the western United States.

==Diversity==

North America has an estimated 630 different megachilid species, including &quot;Megachile&quot;, &quot;Anthidium&quot;, &quot;Hoplitis&quot;, and &quot;Osmia&quot;. Most Megachilidae are native, and a few are introduced, accidentally and intentionally; globally the number of species identified exceeds 4,000. Thus Megachilidae represent 15% to 20% of named species of bees.

The scientific name Megachilidae refers to the genus &quot;Megachile&quot;, translating roughly as &quot;large lipped&quot; (Ancient Greek μέγᾰς (mégas, &quot;big&quot;) + χεῖλος (kheîlos, &quot;lip&quot;); their &quot;large lips&quot; and strong jaws are well-suited for collection of nest building materials.

Most Megachilidae build their nests in above-ground cavities; they all are solitary bees. Their nesting habits means that in some studies of bee diversity, this bee family is most likely to be the one encountered, even though the many ground nesting bees are much greater in species numbers (~70% of all bee species are ground nesters). For example, in Krombein&#x27;s trap-nesting survey (1967), almost all bees that nested in his offerings were Megachilid species—40 of 43 occupying bee species. (They were outnumbered in diversity by almost twice as many species of wasps (75) that utilized the nests).

Because they are (mostly) above-ground nesters and more commonly attracted to artificial nests, megachilid bees are also more commonly cultivated than ground nesting solitary bees. They accept nesting materials made from hollow stems, tubes, and blocks with preformed holes (&quot;nest blocks&quot;), and several megachilids have become important species for agricultural / horticultural pollination. In North America these cultivated bees include the introduced &quot;Megachile rotundata&quot;, (alfalfa leafcutter bees), used extensively in alfalfa pollination, and the western native and frequently raised &quot;Osmia lignaria&quot; (the orchard mason bee or blue orchard bee), used in orchard pollination. Other &quot;Osmia&quot; and &quot;Megachile&quot; species are also in commercial use in North America, Europe and Asia.

A suite of megachilid rely on plant resins for nest construction. These &quot;resin bees&quot; are typically smaller than honey bees, and effective pollinators, although the hard glue-like resins can complicate management of other tunnel nesting bees. Carder bees, &quot;Anthidium&quot;, are unique for using plant fibers; there are 80 to 90 species of them in North America. Ironically, a non-native is best known—&quot;A. manicatum&quot;, the European wool carder bee, was accidentally introduced to the Americas in the late &#x27;60s and has now spread across the continent. It has been described as &quot;... perhaps the most widely distributed unmanaged bee species in the world.&quot; Like most &quot;Anthidium&quot;, rather than cutting leaves or petals, &quot;A. manicatum&quot; scrapes the hairs from leaves to use for nesting material. It is atypical because the male is larger than the female and constantly on patrol, protecting a &quot;harem&quot; by chasing and even attacking all interlopers including honey and bumble bees, its tail equipped with multiple prongs that can knife in between the segments of almost any intruder.&lt;ref name=&quot;HBS / wool carder&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither the introduced &quot;Anthidium&quot; nor its American cousins are considered parasites, only territorial and at times aggressive, though some genera are, including &quot;Coelioxys&quot; (kleptoparasites mostly of leafcutter bees), and &quot;Stelis&quot; (kleptoparasites of leafcutter and mason bees).

While some Megachilidae are extensively studied for their commercial possibilities (or impacts), others are studied by naturalists. Mason bees, not commonly cultivated, are known through extended observation and writings in the last half of the 19th century by Jean-Henri Fabre, with his writings made further famous by his English translator Alexander Teixeira de Mattos (&quot;The Mason Bee&quot;); Fabre wrote many observations, including of other Megachilidae, from his home in France, and his writings inspired many future researchers and enthusiasts, from Charles Darwin to Gerald Durrell.

==Evolution and taxonomy==


The fossil record for megachilid bees is poor, but a Middle Eocene dicotyledonous leaf shows definite semicircular cutouts along its margin, implying that leaf-cutting bees existed at that time. Multiply-cut leaves and rare body fossils from the Eocene of Germany and the Paleocene of France suggest that Megachilinae began cutting leaves early in their evolution. Phylogenetic analysis yields an age consistent with this Eocene origin for the group.

<text>The Bombyliidae are a family of flies, commonly known as bee flies. Some are colloquially known as bomber flies. Adults generally feed on nectar and pollen, some being important pollinators. Larvae are mostly parasitoids of other insects.

== Overview ==
The Bombyliidae are a large family of flies comprising hundreds of genera, but the life cycles of most species are known poorly, or not at all. They range in size from very small (2 mm in length) to very large for flies (wingspan of some 40 mm). When at rest, many species hold their wings at a characteristic &quot;swept back&quot; angle. Adults generally feed on nectar and pollen, some being important pollinators, often with spectacularly long proboscises adapted to plants such as &quot;Lapeirousia&quot; species with very long, narrow floral tubes. Unlike butterflies, bee flies hold their proboscis straight, and cannot retract it. Many Bombyliidae superficially resemble bees and accordingly the prevalent common name for a member of the family is bee fly. Possibly the resemblance is Batesian mimicry, affording the adults some protection from predators.

The larval stages are predators or parasitoids of the eggs and larvae of other insects. The adult females usually deposit eggs in the vicinity of possible hosts, quite often in the burrows of beetles or wasps/solitary bees. Although insect parasitoids usually are fairly host-specific, often highly host-specific, some Bombyliidae are opportunistic and will attack a variety of hosts.

The Bombyliidae include at least 4,500 described species, and certainly thousands more remain to be described. However, most species do not often appear in abundance, and compared to other major groups of pollinators they are much less likely to visit flowering plants in urban parks or suburban gardens. As a result, this is arguably one of the most poorly known families of insects relative to its species richness. The family has a patchy fossil record, with species being known from a handful of localities, the oldest known species are known from the Middle Cretaceous Burmese amber, around 99 million years old.

==Morphology==
===Adult===

Although the morphology of beeflies varies in detail, adults of most bee flies are characterized by some morphological details that make recognition easy. The dimensions of the body vary, depending on the species, from 1.0 mm to 2.5 cm. The form is often compact and the integument is usually covered with dense and abundant hair. The coloration is usually inconspicuous and colours such as brown, blackish- grey, and light colors like white or yellow predominate. Many species are mimics of apoid Hymenoptera. In other species patches of flattened hairs occur that can act as silvery, gilded or copper-tone reflecting mirrors; these perhaps serve as visual signals in conspecific mate/rival recognition, or perhaps imitate reflecting surface particles on bare soils with high content of materials like quartz, mica or pyrite.

The head is round, with a convex face, often holoptic in males. The antennae are of the type aristate composed of three to six segments, with the third segment larger than the others; the stylus is absent (antenna of three segments) or is composed of one to three flagellomeres (antenna of four to six segments). The mouthparts are modified for sucking and adapted for feeding on flowers. The length varies considerably: for example, the Anthracinae have short mouthparts, with the labium terminating in a large fleshy labellum; in Phthiriinae, the tube is considerably longer, and in Bombyliinae more than four times the length of the head.

The legs are long and thin and the front legs are sometimes smaller and more slender than the middle and rear legs. Typically, they are provided with bristles at the apex of the tibiae, without empodia and, sometimes, also without pulvilli. The wings are transparent, often hyaline or evenly colored or with bands. The alula are well developed and in the rest position the wings are kept open and horizontal in a V shape revealing the sides of the abdomen.

The abdomen is generally short and wide, subglobose-shaped, cylindrical, or conical, composed of six to eight apparent urites. The remaining urites are part of the structure of the external genitalia. The abdomen of the females often ends with spinous processes, used in ovideposition. In Anthracinae and Bombyliinae, a diverticulum is present in the eighth urite, in which the eggs are mixed with sand before being deposited.

The wing venation, although variable within the family, has some common characteristics that can be summarized basically in the particular morphology of the branches of the radial sector and the reduction of the forking of the media. The costa is spread over the entire margin and the subcosta is long, often ending on the distal half of the costal margin. The radius is almost always divided into four branches, with fusion of the branches R 2 and R 3, and is characterized by the sinuosity of the end portions of the branches of the radial sector. The venation presents a marked simplification compared to other Asiloidea and, in general, to other lower Brachycera. M 1 is always present and converges on the margin or, sometimes, of R 5. M 2 is present and reaches the margin, or is absent. M 3 is always absent and merged with M 4. The discal cell is usually present. The branch M 3 +4 is separated from the discal cell at the distal posterior vertex, so the mid-cubital connects directly to the posterior margin of the discal cell. The cubital and anal veins are complete and end separately on the margin or converge joining for a short distance Consequently, the cell cup may be open or closed.

Hoverflies of the family Syrphidae often mimic Hymenoptera as well, and some syrphid species are hard to tell apart from Bombyliidae at first glance, especially for bee fly species that lack a long proboscis or long, thin legs. Such bombyliids can still be distinguished in the field by anatomical features such as:

* They usually have an evenly curved or sloping face (hoverflies often have prominent bulges of the facial cuticle and/or beak- to knob-like facial projections).
* The wings lack a &quot;false rear edge&quot; and often have large dark areas with sharp boundaries, or complex patterns of spots (hoverfly wings are often clear or have smooth gradients of tinting, and their veins merge posteriorly into a &quot;false edge&quot; rather than reaching the wing&#x27;s true rear edge).
* The abdomen and thorax hardly ever have large glossy areas formed by exposed cuticle (hoverflies often have glossy cuticular body surfaces).

===Larva===
The larvae of most bee flies are of two types. Those of the first type are elongated and cylindrical in shape and have a metapneustic or amphipneustic tracheal system, provided with a pair of abdominal spiracles and, possibly, a thoracic pair. Those of the second type are stubby and eucephalic and have one pair of spiracles positioned in the abdomen.

==Biology==

Adults favour sunny conditions and dry, often sandy or rocky areas. They have powerful wings and are found typically in flight over flowers or resting on the bare ground exposed to the sun (watch video) They significantly contribute to cross pollination of plants, becoming the main pollinators of some plant species of desert environments. Unlike the majority of glyciphagous dipterans, the bee flies feed on pollen (from which they meet their protein requirements). A similar trophic behavior occurs among the hoverflies, another important family of Diptera pollinators.

As with hoverflies, bee flies are capable of sudden acceleration or deceleration, all but momentum-free high-speed changes of direction, superb control of position while hovering in mid-air, as well as a characteristically cautious approach of a possible feeding or landing site.
Bombyliids are often recognizable by their stocky shapes, by their hovering behavior, and for the particular length of their mouthparts and/or legs as they lean forward into flowers. Unlike hoverflies, which settle on the flower as do bees and other pollinating insects, those bee fly species which have a long proboscis generally feed while continuing to hover in the air, rather like Sphingidae, or while touching the flower with their front legs to stabilize their position - without fully landing or ceasing oscillation of the wings.

Species with shorter proboscis do land and walk on flower heads, however, and can be much harder to distinguish from hoverflies in the field. As noted, many bee fly species spend regular time intervals at rest on or near the ground, while hoverflies hardly ever do so. It can therefore be informative to watch feeding individuals and see whether or not they move down to ground level after a few minutes. Close observation is often easier with feeding individuals than with flies on the ground, as the latter are especially quick to take flight at the first sight of moving silhouettes or approaching shadows.

Mating behavior has only been observed in a handful of species. It can vary from fairly generic swarming or unsolicited mid-air interception, as is common in many Diptera, to courtship behavior involving a context-specific flight pattern and wingbeat pitch of the male, with or without repeated proboscis contact between male and female. Males often seek out smaller or larger clearings on the ground, presumably in vicinity of flowering plants or host nesting habitats that are likely attractive to females. They can return to their chosen perch or patch after every feeding bout or after pursuit of other insects flying over, or they can instead survey their chosen territory while hovering one or more meters above the bare patch.

Gravid females seek out nesting habitats of hosts, and can spend many minutes inspecting for example entrances of smaller burrows in soil. In some species this behavior consists of hovering and repeated split-second foreleg touches of soil near the edge of the burrow&#x27;s entrance, presumably to detect biochemical clues about the burrow&#x27;s constructor such as identity, recency of visiting etc. If a burrow passes scrutiny then the bee fly may proceed to land and insert its posterior abdomen into the soil, laying one or more eggs at the edge or in close vicinity to it. In nine subfamilies including the more frequently observable Bombyliinae and Anthracinae, the females often do not land at all during host burrow inspections, and will proceed to release their eggs from midair by quick flicks of the abdomen while hovering over the burrow&#x27;s entrance.

This remarkable behavior has earned such species the colloquial name of Bomber flies, it can be seen in Roy Kleuker&#x27;s online video clip in YouTube. Female flies with this remarkable oviposition strategy typically have a ventral storage structure known as a sand chamber on the posterior end of the abdomen, which is filled with sand grains gathered before egg laying. These sand grains are used to coat each egg just before their aerial release, which is assumed to improve the female&#x27;s aim as well as the egg&#x27;s survival chances by adding weight, slowing down egg dehydration, masking biochemical cues that could trigger host behavior such as nest cleaning or abandonment - or a combination of all three.


Despite the high number of species of this family, the biology of juveniles of most species is poorly understood. The postembryonic development is of the type hypermetamorphic, with parasitoid or hyperparasitoid larvae. Exceptions are the larvae of Heterotropinae, whose biology is similar to that of other Asiloidea, with predatory larvae that do not undergo hypermetamorphosis. Hosts of bee flies belong to different orders of insects, but mostly are among the holometabolous orders. Among these are Hymenoptera, in particular the superfamilies of Vespoidea and Apoidea, beetles, other flies, and moths. Larvae of some species including &quot;Villa&quot; sp. feed on ova of Orthoptera. &quot;Bombylius major&quot; larvae are parasitic on solitary bees including &quot;Andrena&quot;. &quot;Anthrax anale&quot; is a parasite of tiger beetle larvae, and &quot;A. trifasciata&quot; is a parasite of the wall bee. Several African species of &quot;Villa&quot; and &quot;Thyridanthrax&quot; are parasitic pupae of tsetse flies. &quot;Villa morio&quot; is parasitic on the beneficial ichneumonid species &quot;Banchus femoralis&quot;. The larvae of &quot;Dipalta&quot; are parasitic on antlions.

The behavior of known forms is similar to that of the larvae of Nemestrinoidea: the first instar larva of is a planidium while the other stages have a parasitic habitus. The eggs are laid usually in a future host or at the nest where the host develops. The planidium enters the nest and undergoes changes before starting to feed.

==Zoogeography==
The family is worldwide (Palearctic realm, Nearctic realm, Afrotropical realm, Neotropical realm, Australasian realm, Oceanian realm, Indomalayan realm), but has the greatest biodiversity in tropical and subtropical arid climates. In Europe, 335 species are distributed among 53 genera.

==Systematics==

The systematics of bee flies are the most uncertain of any family of lower Brachycera. Willi Hennig (1973) placed the bee flies in the superfamily of Nemestrinoidea, on the basis of analogies in the behaviour of the larvae, positioning the superfamily in Tabanomorpha inside the infraorder Homoeodactyla
Boris Rohdendorf (1974) dealt with the family in a separate superfamily (Bombyliidea), linking it to the superfamily of Asilidea. Currently the close correlation either positions the bee-flies within the superfamily Asiloidea sensu Rohdendorf (Asilidea) or they are included with the families separated by Rohdendorf in the superfamily of Asiloidea.

The internal systematic of bee-flies is uncertain. In the past, 31 subfamilies were well defined, but the family is thought to be polyphyletic (&quot;sensu lato&quot;). In the 1980s and &#x27;90s, the family has undergone several revisions: Webb (1981) finally moved the genus &quot;Hilarimorpha&quot; into their own family (Hilarimorphidae). Zaitzev (1991) moved the genus &quot;Mythicomyia&quot; and several other minor genera in the family Mythicomyiidae, Yeates (1992, 1994) shifted the entire subfamily of Proratinae, with the exception of &quot;Apystomyia&quot;, into the family of Scenopinidae and subsequently the genus &quot;Apystomyia&quot; into the family Hilarimorphidae. Nagatomi &amp; Liu (1994) moved &quot;Apystomyia&quot; into a family of their own (Apystomyiidae. After these revisions, the bee flies &quot;sensu stricto&quot; have a greater morphological homogeneity, but the monophyly of the family still remains dubious. Phylogenetic analysis of CAD and 28S rDNA gene sequences supports monophyly of only eight subfamilies out of fifteen included in the study, with the Bombyliinae resolving as a highly polyphyletic group.

Overall, the family includes about 4700 described species, distributed among 270 genera. The internal arrangement varies according to the source, according to the different frameworks the authors attribute to tribes and subfamilies. To divide the family, often this scheme is used:

<text>Bidens is a genus of flowering plants in the aster family, Asteraceae. The genus include roughly 230 species which are distributed worldwide. Despite their global distribution, the systematics and taxonomy of the genus has been described as complicated and unorganized. The common names beggarticks, black jack, burr marigolds, cobbler&#x27;s pegs, Spanish needles, stickseeds, tickseeds and tickseed sunflowers refer to the fruits of the plants, most of which are bristly and barbed. The generic name refers to the same character; &quot;Bidens&quot; comes from the Latin &quot;bis&quot; (&quot;two&quot;) and &quot;dens&quot; (&quot;tooth&quot;).

== Phylogeny, taxonomy and diversity ==

Despite their global distribution, the systematics and taxonomy of the genus has been described as complicated and unorganized. The genus include roughly 230 species.

&quot;Bidens&quot; is closely related to the American genus &quot;Coreopsis&quot;, and the genera are sometimes difficult to tell apart; in addition, neither is monophyletic.

==Distribution==
&quot;Bidens&quot; includes roughly 230 species which are distributed worldwide throughout many tropical and warm temperate regions. Species occur in the Americas, Africa, Polynesia, Europe and Asia.

&quot;Bidens&quot; are zoochorous; their seeds will stick to clothing, fur or feathers, and be carried to new habitat. This has enabled them to colonize a wide range, including many oceanic islands. Some of these species occur only in a very restricted range and several are now threatened with extinction, notably in the Hawaiian Islands. Due to the absence of native mammals on these islands, some of the oceanic island taxa have reduced burrs, evolving features that seem to aid in dispersal by the wind instead.

==Human use and interactions==
Nodding beggarticks (&quot;B. cernua&quot;) and hairy beggarticks (&quot;B. pilosa&quot;) are useful as honey plants. Several &quot;Bidens&quot; species are used as food by the caterpillars of certain Lepidoptera, such as the noctuid moth &quot;Hypercompe hambletoni&quot; and the brush-footed butterfly &quot;Vanessa cardui&quot;, the painted lady.

The Bidens mottle virus, a plant pathogen, was first isolated from &quot;B. pilosa&quot;, and it infects many other Asteraceae and plants of other families.

Native Hawaiians drink a special tea out of their leaves (known collectively as &quot;koʻokoʻolau&quot;) back when they were abundant in Hawaii.

<text>In the Ottoman Empire of the 17th century the yerliyya were local Janissaries who had been sent to an urban centre many years earlier and had become fully integrated into their surroundings, often playing important roles in the commercial and political life of the area.

The other sub-group of Janissaries were known as the &quot;kapıkulu&quot;; these were Janissaries that had been sent on direct order from the Ottoman Sultan. In general, the &quot;kapıkulu&quot; were far more loyal to the Porte than the &quot;yerliyya&quot;. In many areas of the empire conflict developed between these two groups of Janissaries, which persisted until the Janissaries were abolished in 1826.

<text>An abrasive is a material, often a mineral, that is used to shape or finish a workpiece through rubbing which leads to part of the workpiece being worn away by friction. While finishing a material often means polishing it to gain a smooth, reflective surface, the process can also involve roughening as in satin, matte or beaded finishes. In short, the ceramics which are used to cut, grind and polish other softer materials are known as abrasives.

Abrasives are extremely commonplace and are used very extensively in a wide variety of industrial, domestic, and technological applications. This gives rise to a large variation in the physical and chemical composition of abrasives as well as the shape of the abrasive. Some common uses for abrasives include grinding, polishing, buffing, honing, cutting, drilling, sharpening, lapping, and sanding (see abrasive machining). (For simplicity, &quot;mineral&quot; in this article will be used loosely to refer to both minerals and mineral-like substances whether man-made or not.)

Files are not abrasives; they remove material not by scratching or rubbing, but by the cutting action of sharp teeth which have been cut into the surface of the file, very much like those of a saw. However, diamond files are a form of coated abrasive (as they are metal rods coated with diamond powder).

== Mechanics of abrasion ==

Abrasives generally rely upon a difference in hardness between the abrasive and the material being worked upon, the abrasive being the harder of the two substances. However, it is not strictly necessary, as any two solid materials that repeatedly rub against each other will tend to wear each other away; examples include, softer shoe soles wearing away wooden or stone steps over decades or centuries or glaciers abrading stone valleys.

Typically, materials used as abrasives are either hard minerals (rated at 7 or above on Mohs scale of mineral hardness) or are synthetic stones, some of which may be chemically and physically identical to naturally occurring minerals but which cannot be called minerals as they did not arise naturally. (While useful for comparative purposes, the Mohs scale is of limited value to materials engineers as it is an arbitrary, ordinal, irregular scale.) Diamond, a common abrasive, for instance occurs both naturally and is industrially produced, as is corundum which occurs naturally but which is nowadays more commonly manufactured from bauxite. However, even softer minerals like calcium carbonate are used as abrasives, such as &quot;polishing agents&quot; in toothpaste.

These minerals are either crushed or are already of a sufficiently small size (anywhere from macroscopic grains as large as about 2 mm to microscopic grains about 0.001 mm in diameter) to permit their use as an abrasive. These grains, commonly called grit, have rough edges, often terminating in points which will decrease the surface area in contact and increase the localised contact pressure. The abrasive and the material to be worked are brought into contact while in relative motion to each other. Force applied through the grains causes fragments of the worked material to break away, while simultaneously smoothing the abrasive grain and/or causing the grain to work loose from the rest of the abrasive.

Some factors which will affect how quickly a substance is abraded include:
*Difference in hardness between the two substances: a much harder abrasive will cut faster and deeper
*Grain size (grit size): larger grains will cut faster as they also cut deeper
*Adhesion between grains, between grains and backing, between grains and matrix: determines how quickly grains are lost from the abrasive and how soon fresh grains, if present, are exposed
*Contact force: more force will cause faster abrasion
*Loading: worn abrasive and cast off work material tends to fill spaces between abrasive grains so reducing cutting efficiency while increasing friction
*Use of lubricant/coolant/metalworking fluid: Can carry away swarf (preventing loading), transport heat (which may affect the physical properties of the workpiece or the abrasive), decrease friction (with the substrate or matrix), suspend worn work material and abrasives allowing for a finer finish, conduct stress to the workpiece.

== Abrasive minerals ==

Abrasives may be classified as either natural or synthetic. When discussing sharpening stones, natural stones have long been considered superior but advances in material technology are seeing this distinction become less distinct. Many synthetic abrasives are effectively identical to a natural mineral, differing only in that the synthetic mineral has been manufactured rather than mined. Impurities in the natural mineral may make it less effective.

Some naturally occurring abrasives are:
* Calcite (calcium carbonate)
* Emery (impure corundum)
* Diamond dust (synthetic diamonds are used extensively)
* Novaculite
* Pumice
* Iron(III) oxide
* Sand
* Corundum
* Garnet
* Sandstone
* Rotten stone (Tripoli)
* Powdered feldspar
* Staurolite

Some abrasive minerals (such as zirconia alumina) occur naturally but are sufficiently rare or sufficiently more difficult or costly to obtain such that a synthetic stone is used industrially. These and other artificial abrasives include:
* Borazon (cubic boron nitride or CBN)
* Ceramic
* Ceramic aluminium oxide
* Ceramic iron oxide
* Corundum (alumina or aluminium oxide)
* Dry ice
* Glass powder
* Steel abrasive
* Silicon carbide (carborundum)
* Zirconia alumina
* Boron carbide
* Slags

== Manufactured abrasives ==
Abrasives are shaped for various purposes. Natural abrasives are often sold as dressed stones, usually in the form of a rectangular block. Both natural and synthetic abrasives are commonly available in a wide variety of shapes, often coming as bonded or coated abrasives, including blocks, belts, discs, wheels, sheets, rods and loose grains.

=== Bonded abrasives ===

A bonded abrasive is composed of an abrasive material contained within a matrix, although very fine aluminium oxide abrasive may comprise sintered material. This matrix is called a binder and is often a clay, a resin, a glass or a rubber. This mixture of binder and abrasive is typically shaped into blocks, sticks, or wheels. The most common abrasive used is aluminium oxide. Also common are silicon carbide, tungsten carbide and garnet. Artificial sharpening stones are often a bonded abrasive and are readily available as a two sided block, each side being a different grade of grit.

Grinding wheels are cylinders that are rotated at high speed. While once worked with a foot pedal or hand crank, the introduction of electric motors has made it necessary to construct the wheel to withstand greater radial stress to prevent the wheel flying apart as it spins. Similar issues arise with cutting wheels, which are often structurally reinforced with impregnated fibres. High relative speed between abrasive and workpiece often makes necessary the use of a lubricant of some kind. Traditionally, they were called coolants as they were used to prevent frictional heat build up which could damage the workpiece (such as ruining the temper of a blade). Some research suggests that the heat transport property of a lubricant is less important when dealing with metals as the metal will quickly conduct heat from the work surface. More important are their effects upon lessening tensile stresses while increasing some compressive stresses and reducing &quot;thermal and mechanical stresses during chip formation&quot;.

Various shapes are also used as heads on rotary tools used in precision work, such as scale modelling.

Bonded abrasives need to be trued and dressed after they are used. Dressing is the cleaning of the waste material (swarf and loose abrasive) from the surface and exposing fresh grit. Depending upon the abrasive and how it was used, dressing may involve the abrasive being simply placed under running water and brushed with a stiff brush for a soft stone or the abrasive being ground against another abrasive, such as aluminium oxide used to dress a grinding wheel.

Truing is restoring the abrasive to its original surface shape. Wheels and stones tend to wear unevenly, leaving the cutting surface no longer flat (said to be &quot;dished out&quot; if it is meant to be a flat stone) or no longer the same diameter across the cutting face. This will lead to uneven abrasion and other difficulties.

=== Coated abrasives ===

A &quot;coated abrasive&quot; comprises an abrasive fixed to a backing material such as paper, cloth, rubber, resin, polyester or even metal, many of which are flexible. Sandpaper is a very common coated abrasive. Coated abrasives are most commonly the same minerals as are used for bonded abrasives. A bonding agent (often some sort of adhesive or resin) is applied to the backing to provide a flat surface to which the grit is then subsequently adhered. A woven backing may also use a filler agent (again, often a resin) to provide additional resilience.

Coated abrasives may be shaped for use in rotary and orbital sanders, for wrapping around sanding blocks, as handpads, as closed loops for use on belt grinders, as striking surfaces on matchboxes, on diamond plates and diamond steels. Diamond tools, though for cutting, are often abrasive in nature.

=== Other abrasives and their uses ===

Sand, glass beads, metal pellets copper slag and dry ice may all be used for a process called sandblasting (or similar, such as the use of glass beads which is &quot;bead blasting&quot;). Dry ice will sublimate leaving behind no residual abrasive.

Cutting compound used on automotive paint is an example of an abrasive suspended in a liquid, paste or wax, as are some polishing liquids for silverware and optical media. The liquid, paste or wax acts as a binding agent that keeps the abrasive attached to the cloth which is used as a backing to move the abrasive across the work piece. On cars in particular, wax may serve as both a protective agent by preventing exposure of the paint of metal to air and also act as an optical filler to make scratches less noticeable. Toothpaste contains calcium carbonate or silica as a &quot;polishing agent&quot; to remove plaque and other matter from teeth as the hardness of calcium carbonate is less than that of tooth enamel but more than that of the contaminating agent.

Very fine rouge powder was commonly used for grinding glass, being somewhat replaced by modern ceramics, and is still used in jewellery making for a highly reflective finish.

Cleaning products may also contain abrasives suspended in a paste or cream. They are chosen to be reasonably safe on some linoleum, tile, metal or stone surfaces. However, many laminate surfaces and ceramic topped stoves are easily damaged by these abrasive compounds. Even ceramic/pottery tableware or cookware can damage these surfaces, particularly the bottom of the tableware, which is often unglazed in part or in whole and acts as simply another bonded abrasive.

Metal pots and stoves are often scoured with abrasive cleaners, typically in the form of the aforementioned cream or paste or of steel wool and non woven scouring pads which holds fine grits abrasives.

Human skin is also subjected to abrasion in the form of exfoliation. Abrasives for this can be much softer and more exotic than for other purposes and may include things like almond and oatmeal. Dermabrasion and microdermabrasion are now rather commonplace cosmetic procedures which use mineral abrasives.

Scratched compact discs and DVDs may sometimes be repaired through buffing with a very fine compound, the principle being that a multitude of small scratches will be more optically transparent than a single large scratch. However, this does take some skill and will eventually cause the protective coating of the disc to be entirely eroded (especially if the original scratch is deep), at which time, the data surface will be destroyed if abrasion continues.

Silicon carbide powders are commonly used as abrasive materials in various machining processes, including grinding, water-jet cutting, and sandblasting. These powders are effective for fine grinding or rough polishing of semiconductors, ceramics, and ferrous materials.

== Choice of abrasive ==
The shape, size and nature of the workpiece and the desired finish will influence the choice of the abrasive used. A bonded abrasive grind wheel may be used to commercially sharpen a knife (producing a hollow grind), but an individual may then sharpen the same knife with a natural sharpening stone or an even flexible coated abrasive (like a sandpaper) stuck to a soft, non-slip surface to make achieving a convex grind easier. Similarly, a brass mirror may be cut with a bonded abrasive, have its surface flattened with a coated abrasive to achieve a basic shape, and then have finer grades of abrasive successively applied culminating in a wax paste impregnated with rouge to leave a sort of &quot;grainless finish&quot; called, in this case, a &quot;mirror finish&quot;.

Also, different shapes of adhesive may make it harder to abrade certain areas of the workpiece. Health hazards can arise from any dust produced (which may be ameliorated through the use of a lubricant) which could lead to silicosis (when the abrasive or workpiece is a silicate) and the choice of any lubricant. Besides water, oils are the most common lubricants. These may present inhalation hazards, contact hazards and, as friction necessarily produces heat, flammable material hazards.

An abrasive which is too hard or too coarse can remove too much material or leave undesired scratch marks. Besides being unsightly, scratching can have other, more serious effects. Excessive abrasion or the presence of scratches may:
*diminish or destroy usefulness (as in the case of scratching optical lenses and compact discs or dulling knives);
*trap dirt, water, or other material;
*increase surface area (permitting greater chemical reactivity such as increased rusting which is also affected by matter caught in scratches);
*erode or penetrate a coating (such as a paint or a chemical or wear resistant coating);
*overly quickly cause an object to wear away (such as a blade or a gemstone);
*increase friction (as in jeweled bearings and pistons).

A finer or softer abrasive will tend to leave much finer scratch marks which may even be invisible to the naked eye (a &quot;grainless finish&quot;); a softer abrasive may not even significantly abrade a certain object. A softer or finer abrasive will take longer to cut, as it tends to cut less deeply than a coarser, harder material. Also, the softer abrasive may become less effective more quickly as the abrasive is itself abraded. This allows fine abrasives to be used in the polishing of metal and lenses where the series of increasingly fine scratches tends to take on a much more shiny or reflective appearance or greater transparency. Very fine abrasives may be used to coat the strop for a cut-throat razors, however, the purpose of stropping is not to abrade material but to straighten the burr on an edge. The final stage of sharpening Japanese swords is called polishing and may be a form of superfinishing.

Different chemical or structural modifications may be made to alter the cutting properties of the abrasive.

Other very important considerations are price and availability. Diamond, for a long time considered the hardest substance in existence, is actually softer than fullerite and even harder aggregated diamond nanorods, both of which have been synthesised in laboratories, but no commercial process has yet been developed. Diamond itself is expensive due to scarcity in nature and the cost of synthesising it. Bauxite is a very common ore which, along with corundum&#x27;s reasonably high hardness, contributes to corundum&#x27;s status as a common, inexpensive abrasive.

Thought must be given to the desired task about using an appropriately hard abrasive. At one end, using an excessively hard abrasive wastes money by wearing it down when a cheaper, less hard abrasive would suffice. At the other end, if the abrasive substance is too soft, abrasion does not take place in a timely fashion, effectively wasting the abrasive as well as any accruing costs associated with loss of time.

== Other instances of abrasion ==
Aside from the aforementioned uses of shaping and finishing, abrasives may also be used to prepare surfaces for application of some sort of paint of adhesive. An excessively smooth surface may prevent paint and adhesives from adhering as strongly as an irregular surface could allow. Inflatable tyre repair kits (which, on bicycles particularly, are actually patches for the inner tube rather than the tyre) require use of an abrasive so that the self-vulcanising cement will stick strongly.

Inadvertently, people who use knives on glass or metal cutting boards are abrading their knife blades. The pressure at the knife edge can easily create microscopic (or even macroscopic) cuts in the board. This cut is a ready source of abrasive material as well as a channel full of this abrasive through which the edge slides. For this reason, and without regard for the health benefits, wooden boards are much more desirable. A similar occurrence arises with glass-cutters. Glass-cutters have circular blades that are designed to roll not slide. They should never retrace an already effected cut.

Undesired abrasion may result from the presence of carbon in internal combustion engines. While smaller particles are readily transported by the lubrication system, larger carbon particles may abrade components with close tolerances. The carbon arises from the excessive heating of engine oil or from incomplete combustion. This soot may contain fullerenes which are noted for their extreme hardness—and small size and limited quantity which would tend to limit their effect.

<text>An iltizam () was a form of tax farm that appeared in the 15th century in the Ottoman Empire. The system began under Mehmed the Conqueror and was abolished during the Tanzimat reforms in 1856.

Iltizams were sold off by the government to wealthy notables, who would then reap up to five times the amount they had paid by taxing the peasants and extracting agricultural production. It was a system that was very profitable and was of great benefit to the Egyptian aristocracy under the Mamluks, and helped create a large and powerful elite. In Egypt, it was abolished by Muhammad Ali as part of his centralization efforts in the early nineteenth century. After confiscating the iltizam lands of the ulema, Muhammad Ali imposed a tax on their significant (and previously tax-exempt) waqf revenues.

The holder of an iltizam was a &quot;mültezim&quot; ()

An iltizam was typically an annual agreement. The malikâne (), developed as a replacement for iltizam, was for life.

<text>Asia Television Limited (, also known as ATV) is a digital media and broadcasting company in Hong Kong. Established as the first television service in Hong Kong as Rediffusion Television () on 29 May 1957, it shifted to terrestrial television on 30 November 1973 and was renamed Asia Television on 24 September 1982. ATV operated two main over-the-air channels: the Cantonese-language ATV Home and the English-language ATV World.

Despite its relatively small market share, ATV received numerous awards for its programmes. One of its successes was the local version of the British game show &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; in 2001, which allowed ATV to enjoy a short-term upturn in its viewing figures. After 2000, ATV faced a gradual decline in production quality and viewership, as well as financial difficulties—a process hastened under the leadership of Wang Zheng. ATV&#x27;s credibility was severely damaged in 2011 after its news department had falsely reported that Jiang Zemin had died.

On 1 April 2015, Hong Kong&#x27;s Executive Council announced that ATV&#x27;s broadcast license would not be renewed. ATV&#x27;s channels ceased over-the-air transmission on 1 April 2016. ATV announced that it planned to continue its business as a digital and satellite broadcaster. Plans for the company&#x27;s subscription-based internet content streaming operations were announced in December 2017.

==History==

===1949–1981: early years===

Rediffusion Television (RTV), the predecessor to ATV, began as a wired radio broadcasting service in 1949. The original office was located on Arsenal Street and Hennessy Road. It launched its subscription-based TV service on 29 May 1957. In 1959, Rediffusion was moved to the offices that were occupied by Fortis Bank Tower.

In 1962, Typhoon Wanda passed over Hong Kong, resulting in 130 deaths. Following the passage of Wanda, Rediffusion broadcast the first-ever fund-raising special. The first televised artiste course broadcast was in 1966 under the title, &quot;Ying Li&#x27;s voice.&quot;

In October 1968, new shows were broadcast on Rediffusion, including variety, sports, and other leisure of interest that attracted more viewers. The most notable show at that time was &quot;Master Q&quot;. It also led the trend in acquiring Japanese anime shows, including Osamu Tezuka&#x27;s &quot;Astro Boy&quot; in 1966.

Rediffusion was given a free-to-air television broadcasting license in 1973 by the Hong Kong Government, which had switched to using wireless television. Rediffusion (later ATV) and TVB (launched on 19 November 1967) have since formed a duopoly in free-to-air terrestrial TV broadcasting in Hong Kong for more than 40 years. A third broadcaster, Commercial Television, entered the market in September 1975, but in the face of intense competition from the two rival broadcasters, ceased transmissions in August 1978.

In 1976, the Hong Kong government introduced Mark Six, a new lottery system that was broadcast twice a week on Rediffusion. The first host of that show was Chun Chau Ha or Xia Chunqiu ().

===1981–2002: development===

In 1981, Rediffusion in the UK sold 61% of its shares in RTV to an Australian consortium. In July 1982, a Chinese enterprise called Far East Group (), owned by the Chiu family, took a stake in the company, such that Far East Group and the Australian consortium each held 50% of RTV&#x27;s shares. The move marked the first time that a Chinese enterprise had played a role in RTV. RTV was renamed &quot;Asia Television&quot; later in the same year. The company that operated ATV frequently recorded losses, and in January 1984, following the withdrawal of the Australian enterprise, the Chiu family bought all of the shares.

In August 1987, the shares of ATV were put up for sale. One year later, Asia Television Limited, the Lim family (led by Lim Por-yen), and the New World Group each owned one-third of the shares. At that time, the members of the board of directors included Deacon Chiu, Lim Por-yen, Fang Li and Cheng Yu-tung.

On 30 January 1989, the Chiu family sold its shares of ATV to New World Group and Lai Sun Group for HK$237.5 million. The New World Group held half of the shares, while the Lam family owned one-third and Lai Sun held one-sixth. At the same time, Sociedade de Turismo e Diversões de Macau (STDM) joined as a minority shareholder. As announced by the board of directors, the new chairman was Cheng Yue-tung and the vice-chairman was Lim Por Yen. The administrative director was Selina Chow.

===2002–2010: ownership shift===
In November 2002, Lai Sun Development, which was heavily indebted following the HK$7 billion acquisition of the Furama Hotel at the height of the property bubble in 1997, announced that it would sell its 32.75% stake to the company&#x27;s chief executive, Chan Wing-kee (陳永棋), for HK$360 million in cash.

In June 2007, Chan, along with Liu Changle (劉長樂), chairman of Phoenix Satellite Television Holdings Limited, established a company that later bought most of ATV&#x27;s shares. Afterwards, Chan Wing-kei took the post of Administrative Director General. With the change of shareholders, there was innovation in the direction of production, marketing strategy, and human resources. One of the significant changes is the increasing purchase of foreign programmes, such as the South Korean Drama &quot;Autumn in My Heart&quot;.

In December 2008, City Telecom chairman Ricky Wong Wai Kay was assigned as new the chief executive while former PCCW deputy chairman Linus Cheung Wing-lam became executive chairman. After just 2 weeks Ricky Wong resigned from his position due to many factors. In early 2009, Taiwanese billionaire Tsai Eng-Meng signed a preliminary agreement to become a key shareholder of Alnery, a company that controls 47.58% of ATV. Tsai has agreed to inject HK$1 billion in the form of convertible bonds. Tsai and Payson Cha have since debated over control of the station.

===2010–2015: decline===
Hong Kong&#x27;s other main television broadcaster, TVB, was regarded as the driving force behind ATV&#x27;s decision to transform its pay TV operation to terrestrial TV broadcasting. For many years, TVB has been the predominant rating leader in Hong Kong, its programmes often capturing 90–95% of the viewing audience. In the last round, ATV had its licence renewed in December 2004 for another 12 years. Under the new terms of the licence, the Broadcasting Authority required that ATV World provide bilingual subtitles on news, weather, and current affairs shows, educational shows, and public service announcements, as well as more cultural and arts shows. In its final years, viewing figures for ATV Home had fallen sharply, as the TV station has begun to cater more to the interests of the mainland Chinese audience, who could now legally receive the channel. In the Pearl River Delta area of China, ATV used to enjoy a 70% ratings share in the late 90s, largely due to rebroadcasting rights. The ratings share has since reduced to 2–3%. The shift resulted in Hong Kong viewers complaining that programmes aired on the channel are &quot;old-fashioned&quot; and not in tune with the preferences of the Hong Kong TV audience.

In 2010, Chinese property businessman Wang Zheng became known as ATV&#x27;s &quot;major shareholder&quot; and began to exercise actual control over the board of directors when his relative-in-law Wong Ben Koon, who is a Hong Kong resident, purchased 52% of ATV&#x27;s shares from Cha&#x27;s brothers and other shareholders, although Wang himself was not a member of the board. This is believed by observers to bypass Hong Kong&#x27;s broadcasting regulations, which forbid non-Hong Kong residents to own and control local television stations. Stating his plan to shape ATV into &quot;Asia&#x27;s CNN&quot; and &quot;Hong Kong&#x27;s conscience&quot;, Wang replaced the production of television drama series with talk shows, which contributed to further loss of ATV&#x27;s audience and advertisers.

On 6 July 2011, ATV News falsely reported the death of Jiang Zemin, former General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party. Wang Zheng, at that time, rumored to be a distant relative of Jiang, was believed to be the source. The Communications Authority fined ATV HK$300,000 for the false news report, and later another HK$1 million after concluding Wang Zheng had been unlawfully interfering with ATV&#x27;s management. Wang&#x27;s cousin James Shing Pan-yu was forced to quit his role as executive director. ATV came under heavy pressure from the community when its &quot;ATV Focus&quot; smeared anti-Moral and National Education pupils and when it broadcast a live show of Wang leading a group of artists dancing in front of the Central Government Offices to call for the government not to issue new free-to-air licences.

On 19 June 2013, the Hop Chung Tourist Car Company – a long-time transport contractor of ATV – filed a lawsuit asking the High Court to wind up ATV over unpaid bills totaling HK$900,000. ATV executive director James Shing denied the station was experiencing financial problems. In 2014, the court ruled in Tsai&#x27;s favour that Wang Zheng was responsible for ATV&#x27;s business failure, and appointed Deloitte to seek a white knight to take over Wong Ben-koon&#x27;s controlling shares.

ATV had also failed to pay wages to its employees; at the end of December 2014, the company said it would shortly pay half the back wages of its staff for September. By early January, the company was still owing the balance of salaries outstanding since November, and there were several terminations and redundancies as a result of the operating difficulties. ATV and its executive director Ip Ka-po received 34 prosecution notices from the Labour Department concerning unpaid wages from July through September. In late-January 2015, the company, still facing liquidity issues, controversially advanced the outstanding salaries for December on condition that employees signed a loan agreement with the company belonging to the major shareholder, Wong Ben-koon.

=== 2015–2017: loss of licence ===
On 31 March 2015, ATV announced during its evening news that its main shareholders had agreed to sell their stake in the company to Ricky Wong&#x27;s Hong Kong Television Network (which was the subject of a failed bid for an over-the-air license before electing to launch as an internet television service instead). Although he had met with ATV staff a few days prior, Wong denied that a deal had been made, while legislators argued that the report was intended to mislead the Executive Council into believing that ATV was in the process of addressing its financial issues.

On 1 April 2015, the Executive Council ruled that it would not renew ATV&#x27;s broadcasting licence. Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Gregory So explained that ATV&#x27;s performance was &quot;unsatisfactory&quot; and had &quot;clearly deteriorated after the mid-term review of its licence&quot;, and that the Communications Authority &quot;[had] serious doubts as to whether ATV would be capable of making the necessary improvements, and whether it has the financial capability to deliver its investment plans, and indeed to continue its business as a going concern.&quot; As federal law requires broadcasters to be given one year&#x27;s notice in the event of license revocation, the license was provisionally extended to 1 April 2016, after which ATV is required to cease broadcasting. Concurrently, the government announced the approval of an over-the-air license to a new broadcasting company, HK Television Entertainment. The government also allowed RTHK to take over ATV&#x27;s analogue broadcast spectrum; RTHK planned to use the spectrum to broadcast an expanded version of its channel 31 service.

On 7 February 2016, after over 200 employees resigned from the company in the previous week, ATV was forced to suspend its news programming due to a lack of staff. The broadcaster planned to restore newscasts following the Chinese New Year holiday. The Communications Authority threatened to fine ATV over the suspension, as it violated conditions of its licence requiring the daily broadcast of the 15-minute evening newscasts in Cantonese and English. On 22 February 2016, the Communications Authority announced that it would issue a 30-day suspension to ATV effective April 2016 for violating licence conditions relating to news programming and missed license fee payments. Although ATV will have ceased broadcasting by then due to the expiration of its licence, the CA stated that it still issued the penalty out of fairness, because not doing so &quot;would send a wrong message to the broadcasting sector, that a beleaguered and cash-strapped licensee would be given a carte blanche to contravene the BO and licence conditions&quot; with few consequences.

On 24 February 2016, the High Court of Hong Kong appointed the firm Deloitte to serve as a provisional liquidator for ATV&#x27;s assets. On 29 February 2016, Deloitte announced that as part of the liquidation process, all of ATV&#x27;s staff would be laid off. On 3 March 2016, Deloitte announced that it was in the process of winding down ATV&#x27;s operations and planned to shut down the network as soon as possible. However, RTHK stated that it would not be ready to take over ATV&#x27;s analogue spectrum with its new programming until 10 March at the latest. On 7 March, only a day after the layoffs took effect, China Cultural Media Group reached a deal to invest in ATV, pay outstanding staff wages for 2016, and operating costs for March, allowing the network to re-hire 160 employees to continue operating ATV in the interim. However, the outstanding wages would not be paid until 2 April. ATV spokesperson stated that the broadcaster was considering alternate outlets for its programming following the shutdown, including the internet.

==== Final day of broadcast ====
The final program aired by ATV Home was a repeat of a special celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Miss Asia Pageant. Although a public relations manager stated that ATV was planning to broadcast one more edition of the Miss Asia Pageant before ATV&#x27;s shutdown, former producer Wingo Ng stated that ATV did not have enough money and staff to produce such a programme.

ATV&#x27;s channels signed off shortly before midnight local time on 1 April. RTHK TV 31 and TV33 (CGTN Documentary) began broadcasting on ATV&#x27;s analogue channels shortly after midnight on 2 April 2016. HKTVE also soft-launched its new digital channel, ViuTV, ahead of its formal launch on 6 April.

==== Debt resolved ====
After ATV formally ceased free TV broadcasting, ATV Investor Secretary Rong Rongbin pledged shares of Star Platinum Corporation, which holds 99% of its shares, to borrow HK$300 million from Xiesheng Xiefeng to save ATV, but did not repay on time; therefore, in July 2016, it acquired the full equity of Star Platinum. It was also reported that about HK$35 million in unpaid wages of 640 former employees and HK$18 million from the Insolvency Fund were also paid after the company had acquired its majority stake.

=== 2017–present: ventures after the loss of licence ===
In December 2017, ATV announced that the company would continue its business with its new mobile app and OTT services, delivering programmes and shows through the internet instead of terrestrial broadcasting. They also announced their new series for the show &quot;Baak Maan Fu Yung&quot; (local version of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;), which is hosted by former general manager of TVB, Stephan Chan. The app also includes previous ATV original dramas and documentaries. The OTT service is operated by ATV&#x27;s subsidiary, Asia Television Digital Media Limited.

In June 2018, ATV announced that they are rebooting the Miss Asia Pageant since the hiatus in 2015. Partnered with South Korean company CJ E&amp;M, the pageant was described as &quot;ATV&#x27;s biggest investment of the year&quot;.

In 2020 ATV announced that they had formed a partnership with UK production company Phoenix Waters Productions to relaunch their drama department and develop a slate of Films, Series, and Variety shows spearheaded by PWP CEO Bizhan Tong. This would start with international thriller Lockdown (2021) to be filmed around the world during the 2020 pandemic and feature a global cast including John Savage, Xander Berkeley, and Anita Chui. In 2021 AMM Global Media was formed where all 19 of Tong&#x27;s creative projects including Lockdown shifted in order to focus entirely on creative entertainment with international appeal, where Tong became its executive director.

On 7 September 2022, the High Court ordered Asia Television Digital Media to be liquidated. ATV then issued a statement stating that only Asia Television Digital Media would be liquidated and that Asia Television Holdings, and its subsidiary Asia Momentum Media would still be providing content.

==Location==

On 21 July 2007, ATV left its long-time home at 81 Broadcast Drive in Kowloon Tong and moved into a new facility in Tai Po. The original home was demolished in 2008–2009 and is now a residential development, called Meridian Hill.

The Tai Po production facilities cover and is three times larger than the old facilities on Broadcast Drive. The Tai Po facilities have four news studios, eight variety show and drama studios and a range of digital broadcasting facilities. The largest studio covers .
The new HQ is the former site of the Lee Kum Kee&#x27;s Hong Kong headquarters and factory operations in Hong Kong.
==News operation==

ATV News was the news-gathering arm of ATV. It produced daily newscasts in Cantonese, Mandarin, and English, which were seen on its Home, World, and News &amp; Business Channels. Additional foreign news coverage was provided by CNN and CBS. The broadcaster was long recognized as pro-Beijing.

==Programming==

ATV aired a range of television programmes, including news, infotainment, drama, and variety shows. In addition to producing its shows, ATV acquired popular TV programmes from overseas markets to cater to changing audience tastes. Of note, ATV bought popular TV dramas from South Korea and Mainland China for broadcast in prime time.

===Channels===
Before 2 April 2016, ATV operated six channels: the 24-hour ATV Home channel in Cantonese; the 24-hour ATV World channel in English; the 24-hour Cantonese satellite channel ATV Overseas, which was accessible in North America via satellite, and three digital DMB-T/H channels: ATV Asia, a 24-hour high-definition channel; CCTV-1, the general channel of China Central Television.

Before 1 April 2009, the following DMB-T/H channels were in operation: News &amp; Business, a 24-hour news and finance news channel; His TV, a 24-hour sports and infotainment channel aimed at men; Her TV, a 24-hour lifestyle infotainment channel aimed at women; Plus TV, a 24-hour documentary channel; and HDTV, a 24-hour high-definition channel.


===Programmes on ATV Home===

ATV produced numerous classic TV dramas, including &quot;Super Stuntman&quot; (狮王之王), &quot;Crocodile Tears&quot; (鱷魚淚), &quot;My Date with a Vampire&quot;, &quot;Fatherland&quot; (大地恩情), &quot;Vampire Hero&quot; (殭屍英雄), &quot;The Legend&quot;, &quot;My Date with a Vampire 2&quot;, &quot;The Legendary Fok&quot; (霍元甲), &quot;My Date with a Vampire 3&quot;, &quot;Central Affairs I and II&quot; (情陷夜中環), &quot;Vampire Expert II&quot; (殭屍道長II) and &quot;Reincarnated&quot; (天蠶變). Productions of note in 1990s include &quot;The Pride of Chaozhou&quot; (我來自潮州), &quot;Who is the Winner?&quot; (勝者為王), &quot;Who is the Winner?! 2: King of Green Bat&quot;, &quot;King of the Gambler&quot; (千王之王重出江湖), and &quot;The Good Old Days&quot; (再見艷陽天).

In the 2000s, ATV created and hosted certain large-scale award shows. The most well-known would probably be &quot;The Annual Most Popular TV Commercial Awards&quot; (十大電視廣告頒獎禮).

Other infotainment programmes like &quot;Stories From Afar&quot; (尋找他鄉的故事) ranked highly in the &quot;Appreciation Index Survey Best Television Awards&quot; (香港電視節目欣賞指數), as reflected by a public review.

Some ATV programmes, such as the entertainment news show &quot;Hong Kong Today&quot; (今日睇真D) and &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; (百萬富翁), proved particularly popular, prompting local rival TVB to offer similar fare.

Asia Television used to air the British Science Fiction Programme &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and were responsible for returning one of their copies to the BBC, when BBC Enterprises wiped many &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serials in the 1970s. The Tomb of the Cybermen returned in late 1991.

===Programmes on ATV World===
ATV World was one of two English-language channels that broadcast in Hong Kong. It offered a variety of programmes, mostly from the United States, ranging from popular serial dramas and films to documentaries and educational shows. Among the shows it aired are &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; (甜心俏佳人), &quot;Survivor&quot; (生還者), &quot;Smallville&quot; (超人外傳), &quot;&quot; (滅罪鑑證科), &quot;Elizabeth I&quot; (伊利沙伯一世傳奇), &quot;&quot; (鑑證行動組), &quot;Cold Case&quot; (鐵證懸案), &quot;&quot; (鑑證紐約), &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; (醫人當自強), &quot;The Closer&quot; (真相追擊), &quot;Doctor Who&quot; (異世奇人), and &quot;Ghost Whisperer&quot; (靈感應). ATV stopped carrying the talk show &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; (大衛牙擦騷) , but there was a grass-roots movement to bring it back. Arts and sports programming were also offered (e.g. local horse racing, in Chinese 賽馬直擊). Mandarin and Korean programmes were available on ATV World at off-peak hours.

ATV World&#x27;s flagship English news programme was &quot;Main News and Weather Report at 7:30&quot;, provided under the collective effort of ATV News.

Given its focus on English-language programming in a predominantly Cantonese-speaking market, ATV World carried relatively little advertising and was subsidized by ATV Home. Free-to-air television companies in Hong Kong are required by the government to provide an English-language service. In the face of competition from TVB Pearl, ATV World switched focus from dramas and movies to documentaries and natural history shows, likely because such programming was less expensive to acquire. Although movies formerly aired on Saturdays, movies acquired by ATV were generally aired on Monday nights, leading to &quot;The Late News&quot; programme.

==Artistes==

===ATV Training Institute===
Asia Television Training Institute was founded to train people who are interested in joining the television industry. There are four faculties including television production, television artwork, television talent and technical production. Some of the graduates are offered work at ATV.

===Actor station-hopping===
Like TVB, ATV used a contract artist system, in which the station acted as both employer and booking agent. Artists were signed to contracts which meant that they could only appear in that station&#x27;s programmes; the artists were kept on a basic wage with additional fees paid on a per episode or per appearance basis. Acting as an artiste&#x27;s booking agent, the station would also have a veto in what personal appearances, endorsements, and advertisements an artiste may take, demanding a cut of all fees. Artistes would also be pushed to take jobs favored by the station, with artistes who rebelled and refused being put &quot;on ice&quot; (Chinese: 被雪, 雪藏), or being forced to see out their contract at the basic wage, but not being used in any of station&#x27;s programs and forbidden from any other work. Being put &quot;on ice&quot; effectively ends an artist&#x27;s career until the contract lapses.

TVB is known to typecast their performers, with some always given lead roles and others always given supporting roles. As such, some actors left TVB for ATV in hopes of better opportunities, although in most cases the change of station could mean a drastic reduction in fame for the artist, as TVB is the dominant station in Hong Kong. The majority of the leading roles were given to veteran TVB actors. While some veteran TVB actors merely switched sides because their contracts ended, some joined because they were offered better compensation and positions than veteran TVB actors. There were several known incidents where TVB had certain dramas planned and were forced to cancel or rewrite scripts because the star(s) of the role left for other opportunities and vice versa. While TVB also acquired ATV actors, the cross-over was higher in frequency with TVB actors to ATV.

With the disbandment of ATV&#x27;s in-house drama department and the station&#x27;s retreat from making its dramas, there was no longer any work for its actors and most have since found alternative employment.

===Past ATV personalities===

==Criticism and controversies==

=== Hitler advertisement ===
In 1994, ATV controversially ran a two-page advertisement in the &quot;South China Morning Post&quot; promoting marketing opportunities, featuring a full-page picture of Adolf Hitler surrounded by members of the Hitler Youth. It suggested that, had Hitler been able to advertise on ATV, he would have &quot;been assured of total domination&quot; and have &quot;had them sieg heiling from Shanghai to Guangzhou&quot; before adding that advertisers should contact the station or their advertising agency, &quot;before you come up with your final solution&quot;.

This was condemned as &quot;extremely tasteless&quot; by the German Consul-General, who added that the advertisement &quot;hurts the feelings of the many victims of totalitarianism and fascism&quot;, and as &quot;outrageous and unbelievable&quot; by his Israeli counterpart. The United Jewish Congregation of Hong Kong also condemned it as &quot;disgusting&quot;, claiming that it &quot;carries the newspaper to the very brink of moral bankruptcy&quot;, and was &quot;an insult to the memories of all of Hitler&#x27;s victims&quot;.

=== Pro-Beijing slant ===
News programmes broadcast by ATV were deemed by some observers to have taken on a pro-Beijing bias, reporting news involving pro-democracy political forces in Hong Kong in a negative light. A short talk show on current affairs that aired after the six o&#x27;clock news frequently invited pro-Beijing advocates to air their views, often praising the PRC&#x27;s policies and criticising pro-democratic parties, especially when these parties invoked a demonstration. There were also other pro-democratic guests, but this did not balance out the pro-Beijing bias. TVB&#x27;s news programming is similarly criticised for its &quot;pro-establishment&quot; stance. Although the Hong Kong media has the freedom of speech, self-censorship is commonly practised at media organisations whose owners have business interests in mainland China. A shift in ownership of ATV in mid-2006 sparked concern that ATV would become even more pro-Beijing.

For example, the pro-democracy 1 July marches usually make the headline news on TVB, but ATV usually makes the pro-Beijing counter protests the headline news. ATV also attempted to dilute the pro-democracy message of the marches by saying the participants had different messages.

In September 2012, there was outrage after ATV broadcast a news article claiming that opponents of Hong Kong&#x27;s pro-CCP &quot;National Education&quot; classes for students were &quot;destructive forces&quot; which were backed by London and Washington and seek to &quot;destroy Hong Kong by all possible means&quot;. Members of the student advocacy group Scholarism were labelled as &quot;naive teenagers&quot; who have allowed themselves to be &quot;exploited by politicians&quot; and are ruining their own futures by &quot;playing with politics&quot;.

<doc id="346464" wikidata="Q1974494" url="?curid=346464" title="Tijuca National Park">
<text>The Tijuca National Park () is an urban national park in the mountains of the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The park is part of the Atlantic Forest Biosphere Preserve, and is administered by the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio).

The area is composed of secondary vegetation, as it is the result of reforestation carried out during the Second Empire, when it became clear that deforestation caused by coffee farms was harming the drinking water supply of the then capital of the Empire. More than 230 species of animals and birds live in the park, including capuchin monkeys, coatis, agoutis, wild dogs, marmosets, hummingbirds and thrushes.

== History ==
The contemporary Tijuca National Park and its surrounding forests are largely the result of reforestation. In the 1700s, forests in the future park around Rio de Janeiro were cleared for fuel, coffee growing, and livestock. The small streams in the former forest were a significant source of the city&#x27;s water supply, and, with variable rainfall, the city began to experience water shortages and flash floods.

Emperor Pedro II of Brazil established federal control over the area in 1861, and efforts began to restore the former forest on the bare slopes and abandoned fields. The re-planting of trees was carried out by 6 enslaved persons. Their names were Eleutério, Constantino, Manuel, Mateus, Leopoldo, and Maria. These people were enslaved by the Portuguese government and under the supervision of the Tijuca Forest manager Major Manuel Gomes Archer. They planted over 100,000 trees from 1861 to 1887. Around this time, a cog railway was built to carry passengers to the top of Corcovado, and between 1922 and 1931 the famous statue &quot;Christ the Redeemer&quot; was built.

In 1961, Tijuca Forest was declared a national park, and in 2011, the Carioca Mosaic was established, including the park. In 2012, UNESCO designated the landscapes around Rio de Janeiro, including the park, as a World Heritage Site.

==Geography==
Tijuca National Park is claimed to be the world&#x27;s largest urban forest, covering some , although this title is disputed with Johannesburg, South Africa.

The park shares its name with the &quot;bairros&quot; (neighborhoods) of Tijuca and Barra da Tijuca nearby. The word &quot;Tijuca&quot; comes from the Tupi language and means &quot;marsh&quot;, a reference to the Tijuca Lagoon in the contemporary Barra da Tijuca.

It is located in a mountainous region which encompasses the Tijuca Massif. Among its impressive peaks are the Pedra da Gávea, Corcovado and Pico da Tijuca. The forest and mountains form a natural boundary that separates the West Zone of Rio from the rest of the city, as well as dividing the North and South Zones.

One favela exists in the Tijuca Forest, called Mata Machado. Its inhabitants are mainly the descendants of those who migrated to the region in the 1930s to take part in the replanting effort. Though conditions have improved recently under the Favela-Bairro Project, it still contributes to environmental degradation in the forest.

Ecology

The Forest is home to hundreds of species of plants and wildlife, many threatened by extinction, and found only in the Atlantic Forest biome. The vegetation is so dense that scientists have estimated that ambient temperatures in surrounding areas have been lowered by up to 9 °C. The forest also contains some 30 waterfalls.

Due to the reforestation efforts of the late 19th century, about half of the area of a park is a mix of about 30 native tree species and ten introduced species. It is currently threatened by frequent, accidental fires set by humans, a problem compounded by colonization by more flammable grasses displacing native vegetation.

==Tourism==

Given its proximity to the city, the park receives heavy use: in 2016, the park received 3,305,010 visitors. The park contains a number of attractions, most famously the colossal sculpture of &quot;Christ the Redeemer&quot;. Other attractions include the Cascatinha Waterfall; the Mayrink Chapel, with murals painted by Cândido Portinari; the pagoda-style gazebo at Vista Chinesa; and a giant granite table called the &quot;Mesa do Imperador&quot; (&quot;Emperor&#x27;s Table&quot;).

There are numerous hiking trails. Common destinations are: Diamantina&#x27;s waterfall, Parrot&#x27;s Beak (Bico do Papagaio), Tijuca&#x27;s Peak (Pico da Tijuca), Cave Circuit (Circuito das Grutas), Archer&#x27;s Hill (Morro do Archer), Anhanguera&#x27;s Hill (Morro da Anhanguera), the Excelsior Lookout (Mirante do Excelsior) and the Bat&#x27;s Cave (Caverna dos Morcegos).

Panshin was the author of the Anthony Villiers series made up of &quot;Star Well&quot;, &quot;The Thurb Revolution&quot;, and &quot;Masque World&quot;. A fourth volume, entitled &quot;The Universal Pantograph&quot;, never appeared, reputedly because of conflicts between the writer and his publisher. Of the Villiers series, noted SF writer Samuel R. Delany writes in the foreword of &quot;Star Well&quot;:

&quot;New Celebrations&quot;, an omnibus volume collecting the first three volumes, has appeared.

Panshin wrote a novel, &quot;Earth Magic&quot; with his wife, Cory Panshin. His works also include a short story collection, &quot;Farewell To Yesterday&#x27;s Tomorrow&quot;.

== Nonfiction ==
Panshin published a study of the prominent American science fiction author Robert A. Heinlein, &quot;Heinlein in Dimension&quot;.

Most of this work was originally published in fanzines, for which Panshin won the Best Fan Writer Hugo award in 1967. The writings were then published in book form by Advent. Panshin discusses reactions to this work on his website &quot;The Abyss of Wonder&quot;.

Panshin&#x27;s general critical work &quot;SF in Dimension&quot; (1976) was also co-written with Cory Panshin, as was his lengthy theoretical-critical &quot;The World Beyond The Hill: Science Fiction and the Quest for Transcendence&quot; (1989), which received a Hugo Award for Best Related Work. A number of Alexei Panshin&#x27;s books (including &quot;The World Beyond the Hill&quot;) are being republished by Phoenix Pick, an imprint of Arc Manor Publishers.

<text>An image retrieval system is a computer system used for browsing, searching and retrieving images from a large database of digital images. Most traditional and common methods of image retrieval utilize some method of adding metadata such as captioning, keywords, title or descriptions to the images so that retrieval can be performed over the annotation words. Manual image annotation is time-consuming, laborious and expensive; to address this, there has been a large amount of research done on automatic image annotation. Additionally, the increase in social web applications and the semantic web have inspired the development of several web-based image annotation tools.

The first microcomputer-based image database retrieval system was developed at MIT, in the 1990s, by Banireddy Prasaad, Amar Gupta, Hoo-min Toong, and Stuart Madnick.

A 2008 survey article documented progresses after 2007.

==Search methods==
Image search is a specialized data search used to find images. To search for images, a user may provide query terms such as keyword, image file/link, or click on some image, and the system will return images &quot;similar&quot; to the query. The similarity used for search criteria could be meta tags, color distribution in images, region/shape attributes, etc.

* Image meta search - search of images based on associated metadata such as keywords, text, etc.
* Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) – the application of computer vision to the image retrieval. CBIR aims at avoiding the use of textual descriptions and instead retrieves images based on similarities in their contents (textures, colors, shapes etc.) to a user-supplied query image or user-specified image features. 
** List of CBIR Engines - list of engines which search for images based image visual content such as color, texture, shape/object, etc.
* Image collection exploration - search of images based on the use of novel exploration paradigms.

==Data scope==
It is crucial to understand the scope and nature of image data in order to determine the complexity of image search system design. The design is also largely influenced by factors such as the diversity of user-base and expected user traffic for a search system. Along this dimension, search data can be classified into the following categories:
* &quot;Archives&quot; - usually contain large volumes of structured or semi-structured homogeneous data pertaining to specific topics.
* &quot;Domain-Specific Collection&quot; - this is a homogeneous collection providing access to controlled users with very specific objectives. Examples of such a collection are biomedical and satellite image databases.
* &quot;Enterprise Collection&quot; - a heterogeneous collection of images that is accessible to users within an organization&#x27;s intranet. Pictures may be stored in many different locations.
* &quot;Personal Collection&quot; - usually consists of a largely homogeneous collection and is generally small in size, accessible primarily to its owner, and usually stored on a local storage media.
* &quot;Web&quot; - World Wide Web images are accessible to everyone with an Internet connection. These image collections are semi-structured, non-homogeneous and massive in volume, and are usually stored in large disk arrays.

==Evaluations==
There are evaluation workshops for image retrieval systems aiming to investigate and improve the performance of such systems.
* ImageCLEF - a continuing track of the Cross Language Evaluation Forum that evaluates systems using both textual and pure-image retrieval methods.
* Content-based Access of Image and Video Libraries - a series of IEEE workshops from 1998 to 2001.

<text>Yvette Marie Stevens (born March 23, 1953), better known by her stage name Chaka Khan ( ), is an American singer. Known as the &quot;Queen of Funk&quot;, her career has spanned more than five decades beginning in the early 1970s as the lead vocalist of the funk band Rufus. With the band she recorded the notable hits &quot;Tell Me Something Good,&quot; &quot;Sweet Thing,&quot; &quot;Do You Love What You Feel,&quot; and the platinum-certified &quot;Ain&#x27;t Nobody.&quot; Her debut solo album featured the number-one R&amp;B hit &quot;I&#x27;m Every Woman&quot; (which became a pop hit for Whitney Houston). Khan scored another R&amp;B charts hit with &quot;What Cha&#x27; Gonna Do for Me&quot; before becoming the first R&amp;B artist to have a crossover hit featuring a rapper, with her 1984 cover of Prince&#x27;s &quot;I Feel for You.&quot; More of Khan&#x27;s hits include &quot;Through the Fire&quot; and a 1986 collaboration with Steve Winwood that produced a number-one hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, &quot;Higher Love.&quot;

Khan has won ten Grammy Awards. With Rufus, she achieved three gold singles, one platinum single, four gold albums, and two platinum albums. In the course of her solo career, Khan achieved three gold singles, three gold albums, and one platinum album with &quot;I Feel for You&quot;. She has also worked with Ry Cooder, Robert Palmer, Ray Charles, Quincy Jones, Guru, Chicago, Joni Mitchell, Gladys Knight, De La Soul, Mary J. Blige, Ariana Grande, and Sia. In December 2016, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine ranked her as the 65th most successful dance club artist of all time. She was ranked at No. 17 in VH1&#x27;s original list of the 100 Greatest Women of Rock &amp; Roll. Khan has been nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame three times as a solo artist and four times as a member of Rufus featuring Chaka Khan, the first time in 2012 as a member of Rufus. In 2023, Khan was picked as an inductee in the Musical Excellence category.

==Early life==
Yvette Marie Stevens was born on March 23, 1953, into an artistic, bohemian household in Chicago, Illinois. The eldest of five children born to Charles Stevens and Sandra Coleman, she has described her father as a beatnik and her mother as &quot;able to do anything.&quot; She was raised in the Hyde Park area, &quot;an island in the middle of the madness&quot; of Chicago&#x27;s rough South Side housing projects. Her parents separated when she was 10 and both remarried.

Her sister Yvonne later became a successful musician in her own right, under the name Taka Boom, while her brother Mark formed the funk group Jamaica Boys and was a member of soul group Aurra. She has two half-sisters, Zaheva Knowles and Tammy McCrary.

Khan was raised as a Catholic and attended the elementary school of St. Thomas the Apostle Church in Hyde Park. She attributed her love of music to her grandmother, who introduced her to jazz as a child. Khan became a fan of rhythm and blues music as a preteen and when she was 11 years old she formed a girl group, the Crystalettes, which included her sister Taka. In the late 1960s, Khan attended several civil rights rallies with her father&#x27;s second wife, Connie, a strong supporter of the movement. She joined the Black Panther Party after befriending a fellow member, activist and Chicago native Fred Hampton in 1967. At the age of 13, she was given the name &quot;Chaka Adunne Aduffe Hodarhi Karifi&quot; by a Yoruba Babalawo during a naming ceremony. In 1969, she left the Panthers and dropped out of high school, having attended Calumet High School and Kenwood High School (now Kenwood Academy). She began to perform in small groups around the Chicago area, first performing with Cash McCall&#x27;s group Lyfe, which included her then-boyfriend Hassan Khan. Chaka and Hassan married in 1970.

Khan was asked to replace Baby Huey of Baby Huey &amp; the Babysitters after Huey&#x27;s death in 1970. The group disbanded a year later. While performing in local bands in 1972, Khan was spotted by two members of a new group called Rufus; the lead singer Paulette McWilliams, decided to leave the band and suggested to Khan that she join. The group caught the attention of musician Ike Turner, who flew them out to Los Angeles to record at his studio Bolic Sound in Inglewood, California. Turner wanted Khan to become an Ikette; she declined, stating that she was &quot;really happy with Rufus. But Ike&#x27;s attention was certainly a boost.&quot;

==Career==
===1973–1978: Early career with Rufus===

In 1973, Rufus signed with ABC Records and released their eponymous debut album. Despite their fiery rendition of Stevie Wonder&#x27;s &quot;Maybe Your Baby&quot; from Wonder&#x27;s acclaimed &quot;Talking Book&quot; and the modest success of the Chaka-led ballad &quot;Whoever&#x27;s Thrilling You (Is Killing Me)&quot;, the album failed to gain attention. That changed when Wonder himself collaborated with the group on a song he had written for Khan. That song, &quot;Tell Me Something Good&quot;, became the group&#x27;s breakthrough hit, reaching No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1974, later winning the group their first Grammy Award. The single&#x27;s success and the subsequent follow-up, &quot;You Got the Love&quot;, which peaked at No. 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and No. 1 on the R&amp;B chart, helped their second parent album, &quot;Rags to Rufus&quot;, go platinum, selling over a million copies. From 1974 to 1979, Rufus released six platinum-selling albums including &quot;Rufusized&quot;, &quot;Rufus Featuring Chaka Khan&quot;, &quot;Ask Rufus&quot;, &quot;Street Player&quot; and &quot;Masterjam&quot;. Hits the group scored during this time included &quot;Once You Get Started&quot;, &quot;Sweet Thing&quot;, &quot;Hollywood&quot;, &quot;At Midnight (My Love Will Lift You Up)&quot;, and &quot;Do You Love What You Feel&quot;.

The band gained a reputation as a live performing act, with Khan becoming the star attraction, thanks to her powerful vocals and stage attire—which sometimes included Native American garb and showing her midriff. Most of the band&#x27;s material was written and produced by the band itself with few exceptions. Khan has also been noted for being an instrumentalist playing drums and bass; she also provided percussion during her tenure with Rufus. Most of her compositions were collaborations with guitarist Tony Maiden. Relations between Khan and the group, particularly between her and drummer Andre Fischer, became stormy. Several members left with nearly every release. While Khan remained in the group, she signed a solo contract with Warner Bros. Records in 1978. While Khan was busy at work on solo material, Rufus released three albums without her participation, including 1979&#x27;s &quot;Numbers&quot;, 1980&#x27;s &quot;Party &#x27;Til You&#x27;re Broke&quot;, and 1983&#x27;s &quot;Seal in Red&quot;. Outside of her work with Rufus, Khan provided backing vocals on singer-songwriter Stephen Bishop&#x27;s first album, &quot;Careless&quot; (1976), on the tracks &quot;Little Italy&quot;, &quot;Save It For A Rainy Day&quot; and &quot;Never Letting Go&quot;. The album went gold.

===1978–1983: Early solo career and final years with Rufus===
In 1978, Warner Bros. Records released Khan&#x27;s solo debut album, which featured the crossover disco hit, &quot;I&#x27;m Every Woman&quot;, written for her by singers-songwriters Ashford &amp; Simpson. The success of the single helped the album go platinum, selling over a million copies. Khan also featured on Quincy Jones&#x27;s hit &quot;Stuff Like That&quot;, also released in 1978, which also featured Ashford &amp; Simpson as co-writers, along with Jones and several others. Ashford &amp; Simpson performed with Khan on the song.

In 1979, Khan reunited with Rufus to collaborate on the Jones-produced &quot;Masterjam&quot;, which featured their hit &quot;Do You Love What You Feel&quot;, which Khan sang with Tony Maiden. Despite her sometimes-acrimonious relationship with some of her bandmates, Khan and Maiden have maintained a friendship over the years. In 1979. she also dueted with Ry Cooder on his album &quot;Bop Till You Drop&quot;. That year, she spent time working on her producing and writing skills at Ike Turner&#x27;s Bolic Sound studio. They had planned to record together. In 1980, while Rufus released &quot;Party &#x27;Til You&#x27;re Broke&quot;, again without Khan, she released her second solo album, &quot;Naughty&quot;, which featured her on the cover with her six-year-old daughter Milini. The album yielded the disco hit &quot;Clouds&quot; and the R&amp;B ballad &quot;Papillon&quot;.

Also in 1980, Khan had a cameo appearance as a church choir soloist in &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; starring John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd. Khan released two albums in 1981, the Rufus release, &quot;Camouflage&quot; and the solo album &quot;What Cha&#x27; Gonna Do for Me&quot;. The latter album went gold. The same year, Khan appeared on three tracks on Rick Wakeman&#x27;s concept album &quot;1984&quot;. In 1982, Khan issued two more solo albums, the jazz-oriented &quot;Echoes of an Era&quot; and a more funk/pop-oriented self-titled album &quot;Chaka Khan&quot;. The latter album&#x27;s track, the jazz-inflected &quot;Be Bop Medley&quot;, won Khan a Grammy and earned praise from jazz singer Betty Carter who loved Khan&#x27;s vocal scatting in the song.

In 1983, following the release of Rufus&#x27;s final studio album, &quot;Seal in Red&quot;, which did not feature Khan, the singer returned with Rufus on a live album, &quot;Stompin&#x27; at the Savoy - Live&quot;, which featured the studio single &quot;Ain&#x27;t Nobody&quot;, which became the group&#x27;s final charting success, reaching No. 22 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number one on the Hot R&amp;B chart, while also reaching the top ten in the United Kingdom. Following this release, Rufus separated for good.

===1984–1996: Solo success===
In 1984, Khan released her sixth studio album, &quot;I Feel for You&quot;. The title track, the first single released, was originally written and recorded by Prince in 1979 and had also been recorded by The Pointer Sisters and Rebbie Jackson. Khan&#x27;s version featured a harmonica solo by Stevie Wonder and an introductory rap by Grandmaster Melle Mel. It became a million-selling smash in the U.S. and United Kingdom and helped to relaunch Khan&#x27;s career. &quot;I Feel for You&quot; topped not only the U.S. R&amp;B and dance charts, but achieved great success on the U.S. pop chart and reached No. 1 in the U.K. The song reached No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in December 1984 and remained on that chart for 26 weeks, well into 1985. Additionally, it hit No. 1 on the Cash Box chart. It was listed as &quot;Billboard&quot;″s No. 5 song for 1985 and netted Prince the 1985 Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Song. In addition to the song&#x27;s successful radio airplay and sales, a music video of Khan with breakdancers in an inner-city setting enjoyed heavy rotation on television and helped to solidify Khan&#x27;s notoriety in popular culture.

Other singles that helped the &quot;I Feel For You&quot; album go platinum included &quot;This is My Night&quot; and the ballad &quot;Through the Fire&quot;, the latter of which was also successful on the adult contemporary chart. Khan was featured in Steve Winwood&#x27;s 1986 number-one hit, &quot;Higher Love&quot;. That same year, a duet was planned with Robert Palmer for the song &quot;Addicted To Love&quot;. However, her manager declined to release the duet, citing the desire not to have too much product from her in the marketplace at one time. She was still credited for the vocal arrangements in the album&#x27;s liner notes, and the song became an international hit. Khan followed up the success of the &quot;I Feel For You&quot; album with 1986&#x27;s &quot;Destiny&quot; and 1988&#x27;s &quot;CK&quot;. Khan found more success in the late 1980s with a remix album, &quot;Life Is a Dance: The Remix Project&quot;, which reached the top ten on the British albums chart. As a result, she performed regularly in the U.K., where she maintained a strong fan base. In 1986, Khan sang alongside Luther Vandross, Cissy Houston and others on David Bowie&#x27;s single &quot;Underground&quot; from the movie &quot;Labyrinth&quot; (1986).

In 1990, she was a featured performer on another major hit when she collaborated with Ray Charles and Quincy Jones on a new jack swing cover of The Brothers Johnson&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Good to You&quot;, which was featured on Jones&#x27;s &quot;Back on the Block&quot;. The song reached No. 18 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 1 on the R&amp;B chart, later winning her and Ray Charles a Grammy for Best R&amp;B Vocal Performance By a Duo or Group. Khan returned with her first studio album in four years in 1992 with the release of &quot;The Woman I Am&quot;, which was a success due to the R&amp;B songs &quot;Love You All My Lifetime&quot; and &quot;You Can Make the Story Right&quot;. Around this time, Khan also did a duet with Peter Cetera on the song &quot;Feels Like Heaven&quot;, which was a minor success. .

Khan also contributed to soundtracks and worked on a follow-up to &quot;The Woman I Am&quot; she titled &quot;Dare You to Love Me&quot;, which was eventually shelved. In 1995, she and rapper Guru had a hit with the duet &quot;Watch What You Say&quot;, in the U.K. That same year, she provided a contemporary R&amp;B cover of the classic standard, &quot;My Funny Valentine&quot;, for the &quot;Waiting to Exhale&quot; soundtrack. In 1996, following the release of her greatest-hits album, &quot;&quot;, Khan abruptly left Warner Bros. after stating the label had neglected her and failed to release &quot;Dare You to Love Me&quot;. 
===1998–2016===
In 1998, Khan signed a contract with Prince&#x27;s NPG Records label and issued &quot;Come 2 My House&quot;, followed by the single &quot;Don&#x27;t Talk 2 Strangers&quot;, a cover of a 1996 Prince song. She later went on a tour with Prince as a co-headlining act. In 2000, Khan departed NPG and she released her autobiography &quot;Chaka! Through The Fire&quot; in 2003. The following year she released her first jazz covers album in twenty-two years with 2004&#x27;s &quot;ClassiKhan&quot;. She also covered &quot;Little Wing&quot; with Kenny Olson on the album &quot;Power of Soul: A Tribute to Jimi Hendrix&quot;.

In 2006, Khan was a featured vocalist on Arif Mardin&#x27;s &quot;All My Friends Are Here&quot; album of his life&#x27;s work, also appearing in the companion documentary &quot;The Greatest Ears In Town&quot;. She performed a jazz vocal for &quot;So Blue&quot;, composed by Mardin in the &#x27;60s with lyrics written for the project by Roxanne Seeman.

After signing with Burgundy Records, Khan released what many critics called a &quot;comeback album&quot; with &quot;Funk This&quot;, produced by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis &amp; Big Jim Wright. The album featured the hit, &quot;Angel&quot;, and the Mary J. Blige duet, &quot;Disrespectful&quot;. The latter track went to No. 1 on the U.S. dance singles chart, winning the singers a Grammy Award, while &quot;Funk This&quot; also won a Grammy for Best R&amp;B Album. The album was also notable for Khan&#x27;s covers of Dee Dee Warwick&#x27;s &quot;Foolish Fool&quot; and Prince&#x27;s &quot;Sign o&#x27; the Times&quot;. In 2008, Khan participated in the Broadway adaptation of &quot;The Color Purple&quot; playing Ms. Sofia to Fantasia Barrino&#x27;s Celie.

In 2002, Chaka Khan provided backing vocals for her sister Taka Boom&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Misti Blu,&quot; a collaboration with the British electronic music group amillionsons.

In December 2004, Khan was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee College of Music during the inauguration of its president, Roger H. Brown.
In a 2008 interview Khan said that she, unlike other artists, felt very optimistic about the current changes in the recording industry, including music downloading. &quot;I&#x27;m glad things are shifting and artists – not labels – are having more control over their art. My previous big record company (Warner Bros.) has vaults of my recordings that haven&#x27;t seen the light of day that people need to hear. This includes Robert Palmer&#x27;s original recording of &#x27;Addicted to Love&#x27; – which they took my vocals off of! We are working on getting it (and other tracks) all back now.&quot; In 2009, Khan hit the road with singers Anastacia and Lulu for Here Come the Girls.

In 2009, Khan was guest singer on the song &quot;Alive&quot; on jazz drummer Billy Cobham&#x27;s album &quot;Drum &#x27; n voice 3&quot;. In 2010, she contributed to vocals for Beverley Knight&#x27;s &quot;Soul Survivor&quot;, collaborated with Clay Aiken on a song for the kids show &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot;, and appeared as a featured artist on &quot;One More Try&quot; and a cover of her song &quot;Through the Fire&quot; on Japanese-American singer-songwriter Ai&#x27;s eighth studio album, &quot;The Last Ai&quot;. Both Khan and Ai won the International Collaboration Special Award at the 2010 &quot;Billboard Japan&quot; Music Awards for the two songs. Khan continues to perform to packed audiences both in her native United States and overseas.

On May 19, 2011, Khan was given the 2,440th Hollywood Walk of Fame star plaque on a section of Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles. Her family was present when the singer accepted the honor, as was Stevie Wonder, who had written her breakout hit &quot;Tell Me Something Good&quot;. On September 27, 2011, the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame committee announced that Khan and her former band Rufus were jointly nominated for induction to the hall. It was the collective&#x27;s first nomination 13 years after they were first eligible. The group were nominated partly due to Khan&#x27;s own storied reputation, including her own solo career in conjunction with her years with Rufus. Recently, Khan rerecorded her song &quot;Super Life&quot; under the title &quot;Super Life: Fear Kills, Love Heals&quot; with Eric Benet, Kelly Price, and Luke James in tribute to Trayvon Martin, a teenager who was killed on February 26, 2012. A number of celebrities also joined in the recording including Loretta Devine, Terry Crews, Eva Pigford, and reporter Kevin Frazier.

On December 6, 2012, Khan performed at a benefit for the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). The IDF originally invited Stevie Wonder; however, after a successful lobbying campaign by the US Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation, Wonder withdrew and was replaced by Khan, who was able to raise $14 million for the IDF. This support contrasted with her earlier support for the Black Panther Party that publicly supported Palestine.

On July 27, 2013, Khan was honored 40 years after signing her first recording contract with a ceremonial renaming of Blackstone Avenue between 50th and 51st street (where her former high school, Kenwood Academy, sits) as Chaka Khan Way and on July 28 the city declared the day Chaka Khan Day. She performed at Millennium Park&#x27;s Pritzker Pavilion on the 28th. In August 2014, Khan served as grand marshal at the 85th annual Bud Billiken Parade and Picnic in her hometown of Chicago.

On August 27, 2015, Khan was announced as one of the celebrities who would compete on season 21 of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. She was paired with professional dancer Keo Motsepe. Khan and Motsepe were the first couple eliminated from the competition on September 21, 2015. In July 2016, she canceled her upcoming concert performances and entered rehab.

=== 2017–present: &quot;Hello Happiness&quot; and beyond ===
In June 2018, she released a new single called &quot;Like Sugar,&quot; a collaboration with Major Lazer member Switch. She later went on to promote the single on the Ellen show. &quot;Like Sugar&quot; is included on her 2019 album &quot;Hello Happiness&quot;. The album was released on February 15, 2019, and is her first album in twelve years.

Khan served as Grand Marshal in the 2019 Pasadena Tournament of Roses Parade on January 1, 2019, in Pasadena, California.

In October 2019, Khan was an honoree at Variety&#x27;s &quot;Power of Women&quot; luncheon for supporting Little Kids Rock. Other honorees were Mariah Carey, Jennifer Aniston, Brie Larson, Awkwafina, and Dana Walden.
In November 2019, Khan collaborated with Ariana Grande on the song &quot;Nobody&quot; from the soundtrack &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;.

In 2020, Khan competed in season three of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Miss Monster.&quot; She was eliminated and unmasked in the third episode.

Khan was invited to sing the National Anthem at the 2020 NBA All-Star Game. Her rendition was heavily criticized on Twitter, drawing comparisons to Fergie&#x27;s rendition in 2018.

In May 2021, Khan appeared at the season 19 &quot;American Idol&quot; finale, where she performed a medley of her hits alongside the contestants. In June 2021, Khan joined YouTuber and performer Todrick Hall on his album &quot;Femuline&quot; for the song &quot;Fabulosity&quot;. In November 2021, Khan participated in a Verzuz battle with singer Stephanie Mills, at which both singers performed hits from their discography.

In July 2022, Khan announced her new single &quot;Woman Like Me&quot;, which was released on July 29.

In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Khan at No. 29 on their list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

In 2023, Chaka Khan was honored with induction into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame, receiving the Musical Excellence Award. The ceremony featured performances by Chan Khan alongside artists such as Jazmine Sullivan, Common, Sia, and H.E.R. Additionally, during the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony, Khan performed &quot;I&#x27;m Every Woman&quot; with Sia.

In 2024, Chaka Khan collaborated with her sister, Taka Boom, and their brother, Mark Stevens, on the single &quot;Misti Blu Two.&quot; This track, released by the British electronic music group amillionsons, is a reimagined version of Taka Boom&#x27;s earlier rendition of &quot;Misti Blu.&quot;

==Personal life==
Khan is the eldest of five children. Her sister, Yvonne Stevens, is professionally known as Taka Boom, and her brother, Mark Stevens. Chaka Khan has been married twice and has two children, daughter Indira Milini and son Damien Holland. Her first marriage was to Hassan Khan, in 1970, when she was 17, and ended in divorce a short time later. Milini&#x27;s birth was the result of a relationship between Chaka Khan and Rahsaan Morris.

Khan married her second husband, Richard Holland, in 1976. The marriage reportedly caused a rift between Khan and several members of Rufus, in particular, Andre Fischer. Holland wanted her to tone down her sexy stage image, but she refused. Following their split in 1979, Khan spent time in the studio with Ike Turner, who she said was a &quot;real inspiration and a catalyst emotionally and in other ways as well&quot; during that difficult time. Holland filed for divorce in 1980, citing &quot;irreconcilable differences.&quot; 

During her solo stardom in the mid-1980s, she dated a Chicago-area schoolteacher. Following their separation, Khan moved to Europe, first settling in London, and later buying a residence in Germany. She lived in Germany for a while &quot;in a little village in the Rhine Valley&quot; and also in Mannheim.

Khan is vegan, saying she adopted the diet to lose weight and combat high blood pressure and Type-2 diabetes. 

In the past, Khan struggled with drug abuse and alcoholism. Her drug use, which at times included cocaine and heroin, ended in the early 1990s. Khan also had an on-and-off struggle with alcoholism until 2005, declaring herself sober.

In 2006, her son Damien Holland was accused of murder after 17-year-old Christopher Bailey was shot dead. Khan testified on her son&#x27;s behalf. Holland claimed the shooting was an accident. He was acquitted in the criminal trial and found liable in the civil suit.

Though she sang at both the 2000 Democratic and Republican conventions, Khan says that she is more of a &quot;Democratic-minded person&quot;.

Khan was featured in a 2013 episode of &quot;Celebrity Ghost Stories&quot;, in which she told the story of a shadow man who followed her on tour for years, until she met a guardian angel who admonished her to change her life or die.

Khan was inducted as an honorary member of Zeta Phi Beta sorority in November 2020.

Khan is a cousin of singer Lou Rawls.

<text>An antique () is an item perceived as having value because of its aesthetic or historical significance, and often defined as at least 100 years old (or some other limit), although the term is often used loosely to describe any object that is old. An antique is usually an item that is collected or desirable because of its age, beauty, rarity, condition, utility, personal emotional connection, and/or other unique features. It is an object that represents a previous era or time period in human history. Vintage and collectible are used to describe items that are old, but do not meet the 100-year criterion.

Antiques are usually objects of the decorative arts that show some degree of craftsmanship, collectability, or an attention to design, such as a desk or an early automobile. They are bought at antiques shops, estate sales, auction houses, online auctions, and other venues, or estate inherited. Antiques dealers often belong to national trade associations, many of which belong to CINOA, a confederation of art and antique associations across 21 countries that represents 5,000 dealers.

==Definition==

The common definition of &quot;antique&quot; is a collectible object such as a piece of furniture or work of art that has an enhanced value because of its considerable age, but it varies depending on the item, its source, the year of its creation, etc. The customary definition of antique requires that an item should be at least 100 years old and in original condition. (Motor vehicles are an exception to this rule, with some definitions requiring an automobile to be as little as 25 years old to qualify as an antique.)

In the United States, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act (para.1811) exempted &quot;...works of art (except rugs and carpets made after the year 1700), collections in illustration of the progress of the arts, works in bronze, marble, terra cotta, parian, pottery, or porcelain, artistic antiquities and &quot;objects of ornamental character or educational value which shall have been produced prior to the year 1830&quot; (emphasis added)&quot;. 1830 was the approximate beginning of mass production in the United States; at the time, 1930, it also marked an age of at least 100 years. These definitions were intended to allow people of that time to distinguish between genuine antique pieces, vintage items, and collectible objects.

In 1979, the British art critic Edward Lucie-Smith wrote that &quot;Antique-dealers ... sometimes insist that nothing is antique which was made after 1830, although the barrier has been broken down in recent years by the enthusiasm of collectors for Art Nouveau and Art Deco.

The alternative term, &quot;antiquities&quot;, commonly refers to the remains of ancient art and everyday items from antiquity, which themselves are often archaeological artifacts. An &quot;antiquarian&quot; is a person who collects and studies antiquities or things of the past.

=== China ===
Traditionally, Chinese antiques are marked by a red seal, known as a &#x27;chop&#x27;, placed there by an owner. Experts can identify previous owners of an antique by reading the chops. The pre-revolution Chinese government tried to assist collectors of Chinese antiques by requiring their Department of Antiquities to provide a governmental chop on the bottom of a Chinese antique. This chop is visible as a piece of red sealing wax that bears the government chop to verify the date of the antique. The government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China has its own definitions of what it considers &quot;antique&quot;. As of the Cultural Revolution and China&#x27;s opening trade to other countries, the government has tried to protect the definition of a Chinese antique.

==Antiquing==
&quot;Antiquing&quot; is the act of shopping, identifying, negotiating, or bargaining for antiques. People buy items for personal use, gifts, or profit. Sources for antiquing include garage sales and yard sales, estate sales, resort towns, antique districts, collectives, and international auction houses.
Note that &quot;antiquing&quot; also means the craft of making an object appear antique through distressing or using the antique-looking paint applications. Often, individuals get confused between these handmade distressed vintage or modern items and true antiques. Would-be antique collectors who are unaware of the differences may find themselves paying a high amount of money for something that would have little value if re-sold.

== Furniture ==
Antique furniture is a popular area of antiques because furniture has obvious practical uses as well as collector value. Many collectors use antique furniture pieces in their homes, and care for them with the hope that the value of these items will remain same or appreciate. This is in contrast to buying new furniture, which typically depreciates from the moment of purchase.

Antique furniture includes dining tables, chairs, bureaus, chests etc. The most common woods are mahogany, oak, pine, walnut, and rosewood. Chinese antique furniture is often made with elm, a wood common to many regions in Asia. Each wood has a distinctive grain and color. Many modern pieces of furniture use laminate or wood veneer to achieve the same effect. There are a number of different styles of antique furniture depending on when and where it was made. Some examples of stylistic periods are: Arts &amp; Crafts, Georgian, Regency, and Victorian.

An important part of some antique furniture is its hardware fittings, the style of which varies from one period to another. For example, Victorian era hardware is different from other period hardware and is perceived to be aesthetically defined; this is the reason for its popularity.

<doc id="346484" wikidata="Q338619" url="?curid=346484" title="Newport Cathedral">
<text>Newport Cathedral (), also known as [[Newport Cathedral|St Gwynllyw&#x27;s]] or St Woolos&#x27; Cathedral, is the cathedral of the Diocese of Monmouth within the Church in Wales, and the seat of the Bishop of Monmouth. Its official title is Newport Cathedral Church of St Woolos, King and Confessor. The English name, Woolos, is an anglicisation of the Welsh name Gwynllyw.

It became a cathedral in 1949 and while it is the size of a large parish church rather than a typical cathedral, its history and development from the sixth to the twentieth century make it arguably one of the most interesting religious buildings in Wales.

== St Gwynllyw ==

The church was founded by St Gwynllyw, who lived in the later fifth century, after the Roman occupation, at a time when Wales was beginning to develop a national identity. Gwynllyw was the king of Gwynllwg, an area which lay between later Glamorgan and Gwent. There seems little doubt of his historical existence as a real person, although miraculous events are associated with his life and burial place. He was alleged to have been originally a merciless warrior against adjoining kingdoms, a robber and a pirate. Later in life, he converted to Christianity, having been told in a dream to follow a white ox to the prominent hill where he built a church, probably of wood. The shape and footprint of this original church is reflected over 1500 years later in St Mary&#x27;s chapel at the west end of the cathedral. The church became his burial place (Welsh: &quot;eglwys y bedd)&quot;, and in succeeding centuries was a significant place of pilgrimage. It was subject to plundering and attack including, it is said, by Irish pirates and Danes, and in 1060 by followers of Harold Godwinson, the last Anglo-Saxon king.

Gwynllyw is venerated in Wales and in the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox traditions. He was the husband of St Gwladys and their son was one of the greatest of all Welsh saints and scholars, Cadoc (Cattwg in Welsh).

== Medieval period ==
After their conquest of South Wales, the Anglo-Normans built the first castle in Newport in the late eleventh century or early twelfth century, close to Gwynllyw&#x27;s church, which would itself have been rebuilt by then, probably in stone.

A much greater transformation took place at the site in the later twelfth century when a large new church was built in the Romanesque style with round-headed arches, favoured by the Normans. Instead of building this new church directly on the original site of Gwynllyw&#x27;s church, it was built to the east, but attached to it, respecting the sanctity of the original site and indicating of the strength of the cult of Gwynllyw.

In the 14th century, the castle was replaced by a new castle on the bank of the River Usk. The town of Newport (&quot;Casnewydd&quot; in Welsh, meaning &#x27;new castle&#x27;) grew near the castle and river. St Gwynllyw&#x27;s church remained prominent on its hill-top in a rural location, well outside the town boundaries and its defensive gates. It retained its status as the parish church of Newport due to its prestige. In the late nineteenth century the church become surrounded by the western suburbs of Newport.

== A tour of the cathedral ==

The cathedral is usually approached from the west door, so the visitor moves from the west towards the east end, passing through the tower, then St Mary&#x27;s chapel and through the Romanesque portal to the larger church beyond and finally to the twentieth-century eastern extensions.

==Tower==

The tower dates from the fifteenth century and is built in the later medieval Perpendicular style with wider and flatter arches than earlier Gothic styles. The headless statue on the outside of the third story of the tower is traditionally associated with Jasper Tudor who may have funded its construction. He had strong Welsh connections and was the uncle of Henry VII, the first king of the Tudor dynasty. Tradition also asserts that his head on the statue was shot down during the English Civil War by Cromwell’s supporters.

The tower contains a ring of 13 bells, the largest ring of bells in Wales. Although a fine tower, it is separated from the main body of the church by St Mary&#x27;s chapel. It is not certain whether there was an earlier tower on the site.

==St. Mary&#x27;s Chapel==

To enter St Mary&#x27;s chapel, which now links the tower with the main body of the cathedral, we pass through a modern glass screen engraved with representations of St Gwynllyw holding his church and of St David (Welsh: &quot;Dewi Sant&quot;), the patron saint of Wales, with a dove on his shoulder.

St Mary&#x27;s was the original site of Gwynllyw’s church, (though much restored and rebuilt in the 11th, 13th and 19th centuries) and the site of his tomb, (Welsh: &quot;bedd y sant&quot;), which is believed to have been on the south side of the building. This chapel is a place to savour the established tradition of Celtic Christianity in Wales, which long predates the arrival of St Augustine to convert England.

Towards the west end of the chapel is a splendid Victorian reconstruction of a Romanesque font based on a surviving fragment of the original which has been incorporated in the later work. The shaft and base of the font look medieval.

Low down on the south side of the chapel, a curious medieval octagonal window has been cut into the fabric which is believed to have been relocated here in 1913 when the south porch (now the cathedral shop) of the main building was remodelled.

== The Romanesque portal ==

It is from St Mary&#x27;s chapel that we first view the chief glory of the cathedral – the wonderful twelfth-century Romanesque portal with its characteristic zig-zag chevron motifs framing the iconic view of the main body of the cathedral. The outer order of decoration is derived from Gloucester Cathedral, while the inner order has parallels in the Herefordshire School of Romanesque Sculpture. There are some remains of paint on parts of the portal, and it was almost certainly fully painted originally. The site of the archway may well mark the site of an opening to an earlier, smaller chancel, perhaps ending in an apse, before the major extension of the church took place.

The most unusual elements are the columns and capitals incorporated in the archway. The columns are definitely Roman in origin and perhaps brought from the Roman Legionary Fortress nearby at Caerleon. One theory is that they had been brought here at a rather earlier date to form part of the shrine which may have previously existed over Gwynllyw’s grave and subsequently relocated into the portal to lead the way into the new building. If so, they would be symbols of the power of his cult and the desire of the Anglo-Norman conquerors of Wales to associate themselves with him.

The capitals are of Roman Composite type and, if they were indeed also originally Roman, they have been recut. Over generations, scholars have debated what the scenes represent. They were thought to be Biblical scenes – the Creation, Fall, Flood, Baptism of Christ, and the Trinity. Scenes from the lives of Gwynllyw and Cattwg have also been suggested. More recently, it has been suggested that they were intended to be understood on two levels as the scenes may have echoes both in the Bible and in the lives of the two saints honoured at this site. The style of the hair and tunics on the figures on the north (left-hand) capital echoes fourth-century Roman art which suggests that we are indeed contemplating sculpture which looks back to the very earliest phase of Christianity in Britain.

== The nave and aisles ==

The nave consists of five Romanesque round arches rising from massive columnar piers on each side – a grand 12th century architectural scheme, but with rather less decoration than the Romanesque portal we have come through. This work was carried out under the patronage of the great abbey of Gloucester, or possibly Robert, Earl of Gloucester.

Above, the rounded clerestory windows would once have let in daylight, but are now internal windows since the aisles to north and south were rebuilt with higher roofs in the Perpendicular style of the 15th century, with characteristically pointed flatter and wider windows. While the principal aim here was to increase the capacity of the church, it might also have been a reaction to fire damage caused during an attack of followers of Owain Glyndwr in 1402, in his attempt to re-establish an independent Wales. Supporting this theory is a tree-ring date (dendrochronology) of the early fifteenth century recently given to the fine medieval wagon roof of the nave.

== The east end of the cathedral ==

The earlier chancel of the cathedral, regarded at the time as Victorian, or at least heavily restored by the Victorians, was demolished and rebuilt on a grander scale between 1960 and 1964 to provide a more cathedral-like chancel at the east end. The scheme also provided for a new chapel for the choir at the end of the south aisle, although the choir was subsequently relocated to its original place in front of the chancel, while the chapel, now dedicated to St Luke, is reserved for private prayer.

The architect of the extensions was Alban Caroe, whose distinguished family architectural partnership also undertook important work over several generations in Wales and elsewhere. Some regard his design as rather lacking in originality, but it does harmonise with the medieval fabric of the cathedral and the scale of the windows provide plenty of light. More controversial aspects are provided at the east end by John Piper and Patrick Reyntiens, incorporating a round window with gold and brown stained glass and a great mural of red, white, black and grey which swirls down from the window to behind the high altar. The interpretation of this art is very much for the individual visitor.

In the north wall of the chancel there is a low thirteenth-century window relocated from the earlier chancel. Tradition asserts that this was a window for lepers to watch services (and in its original position would have been near the ground), but this purpose is not certain.

In the Middle Ages, at the entrance to the chancel, there would have been a rood screen with a loft and a large life-size crucifix above dividing it from the nave. The medieval doorways to the loft can still be seen high above the south west end of the chancel and at ground-level. A modern figure of the Crucified Christ now hangs in the chancel arch, the work of the Singaporean artist Tay Swee Siong.

== Monuments and tombs ==
The more important monuments and tombs include:

St Mary&#x27;s chapel – Several badly mutilated medieval effigies survive in the north wall recesses of the chapel. In the central recess is a sculptured panel of four weepers bearing the heraldic arms of Sir John Morgan of Tredegar, who died in 1493, a member of the Morgan family, which was influential in South Wales for centuries right up to the twentieth century. He was rewarded with important local positions for supporting the seizure of the English crown by Henry Tudor in 1485.

West end of south aisle – The tomb of Sir Walter Herbert (died 1568). Not much of the effigy remains, but the tomb as a whole demonstrates fine Renaissance work.

East end of north aisle, (Crindau Chapel) – Memorial brass to Octavius Morgan MP FSA (1803–1885), distinguished Welsh historian and antiquarian and of the family of Sir John Morgan above. He took a great interest in the history of St Woolos. His house, The Friars, is in the parish of St Woolos. A nearby stained glass window features the arms of the Morgan family and of the Dioceses of Gloucester and Llandaff which had rights over St Woolos before the Diocese of Monmouth was created.

Niche in the last column of the nave, south arcade – Statue of Gwynllyw holding up his church in memory of Noel Morris, who died in 1967 and was the son of Edwin Morris, a former Archbishop of Wales. While there has been speculation that the sculpture may be by Elizabeth Frinck, no artistic or documentary evidence for this has yet come to light.

== Stained glass ==
Apart from two abstract twentieth century windows by Frank Roper in the north side of St Mary&#x27;s Chapel, the glass is Victorian and Edwardian. Some windows have had their decorative backgrounds removed. Several are by John Hardman and Co, including the Good Samaritan in the south wall of the south aisle and Christ blessing Children in the west wall of the north aisle as well as the window of Gwynllyw, Gwladys and Cattwg illustrated above.

== Music in the cathedral ==
There is a long tradition of choral singing at the cathedral and music forms an important part in its life. The cathedral choir consists of three separate groups of singers: boys and girl choristers and adults, providing alto, tenor and bass parts. The choir sings at Sunday services and at Evensong on a Wednesday, as well as at other special services. The repertoire ranges from the seventeenth century to the twenty-first century. The cathedral is also a popular venue for musical and other artistic performances.

The cathedral organ was rebuilt in 1966 by Hill, Norman and Beard, incorporating elements from two organs: one the earlier organ in the cathedral, built by Griffin and Stroud in 1915, and the other an organ built by Hill which was salvaged from the demolished Newport Old Town Hall. This 1966 organ was rebuilt in 1997 by Nicholson of Worcester.

The organist and choirmaster is Thomas Coxhead, who was appointed in 2024.

== Memorial to those shot during the Chartist uprising, 1839 ==

During the Chartist Uprising in favour of democratic rights which centred on Newport on 4 November 1839, at least 22 people were shot by a party of the 45th Regiment of Foot in front of the Westgate Hotel. Many of these would have walked past the cathedral on their way to the town centre. A memorial outside the cathedral to the left of the lychgate commemorates ten of these who were buried in unmarked graves in St. Woolos churchyard. A sculpture of a large pair of nineteenth-century workman&#x27;s boots is placed near the gates to the north-east of the memorial to commemorate the march of the Chartists.

<text>The Far Eastern Economic Review (FEER or The &quot;Review&quot;) was an Asian business magazine published from 1946 to 2009. The English-language news magazine was based in Hong Kong and published weekly until it converted to a monthly publication in December 2004 because of financial difficulties.

The &quot;Review&quot; covered a variety of topics including politics, business, economics, technology, and social and cultural issues throughout Asia, focusing on Southeast Asia and Greater China.

==History==
=== Founding ===
The &quot;Far Eastern Economic Review&quot; was started in 1946 by Eric Halpern, a Jewish immigrant from Vienna. Halpern founded the magazine believing that Asia would become stable after World War II and that English would be widely used in the region among merchants, students and bankers. Before the &quot;Review&quot;, he had settled in Shanghai and worked for &quot;Finance and Commerce&quot;, a biweekly business magazine that shut down in December 1941 after the Japanese military invaded the city during the Second Sino-Japanese War.

The first issue was published on 16 October 1946.

The Kadoorie family, Jardines, and the HSBC provided seed capital for the &quot;Review&quot;.

After Halpern&#x27;s retirement in 1958, Dick Wilson became chief editor and publisher. He operated an office in a colonial building along the waterfront where the Mandarin Hotel is now located. During Wilson&#x27;s tenure, the magazine extended its coverage from China and Hong Kong to other regions, including Japan, Australia, India, and the Philippines.

In 1964 Wilson was succeeded as editor by Derek Davies, a Welsh journalist who had served in the British Foreign Office. Between 1964 and 1989, the &quot;Review&quot; became one of Asia&#x27;s most authoritative magazines, with a circulation of nearly 90,000. At its peak, the &quot;Review&quot; had nearly 100 news staff members in 15 bureaus across Asia, making it the largest editorial team of any regional weekly publication.

In 1972, the &quot;South China Morning Post&quot; gained a majority ownership of the &quot;Review&quot;.

In 1987, Dow Jones, a minority shareholder since 1973, took full control of the &quot;Review&quot; after it acquired the 51% stake owned by the &quot;South China Morning Post&quot;. Davies stepped down as editor in 1989 after he lost a libel case against the Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew.

After serving 25 years as senior editor, Davies was succeeded by Philip Bowring. In 1992, Bowring resigned due to differences with Dow Jones&#x27;s vice-president Karen Elliott House over the magazine&#x27;s editorial direction.

In November 2001, Dow Jones merged the editorial operations of the &quot;Review&quot; and the &quot;Asian Wall Street Journal&quot; to cut costs. Three years later, the magazine became a monthly publication and had fired 80 employees, representing 10% of Dow Jones&#x27;s staff in Asia. Articles were largely commissioned, and only a skeleton editorial staff was retained. David Plott, the magazine&#x27;s editor at the time, said the cuts resulted in a loss of one of the &quot;greatest concentrations of knowledge and expertise about the region assembled anywhere&quot;.

After the &quot;Review&quot; became a monthly in December 2004, most articles were contributed by non-staff specialists, including economists, business-community figures, government policymakers and social scientists.

===Closure ===

The &quot;Review&quot; published its final issue in December 2009 after reducing its staff several times since 2001. Bowring said the magazine declined because of the quick changing of editors, efforts to dumb down the magazine to make it more readable and to move away from hard-hitting, controversial coverage of corporate and financial scandals under the ownership of Dow Jones and House&#x27;s leadership. Former editors David Plott and Michael Vatikiotis said attributing the decline to interference from Dow Jones was unfair, and attributed the &quot;Review&quot;&#x27;s closure to a series of business mismanagement that forced the magazine to reduce its workforce and limited potential revenue from advertising.

In September 2009, Dow Jones announced that the magazine would be shut down permanently because of declining readership and advertising revenue. &quot;The Economist&quot; said the &quot;Review&quot; relied on advertising revenue and its business model failed when Western luxury brands no longer wished to appeal to Asian elites.

Dow Jones said the savings from the death of the &quot;Review&quot; will &quot;catapult the company&#x27;s growth in the burgeoning Asian marketplace&quot;. In response, Jonathan Manthorpe commented, &quot;As the &quot;Review&quot; has been in a vegetative state since at least 2004 when it was made a monthly instead of weekly magazine and its staff was cut from 80 to five, only two of whom are journalists, it is hard to imagine the proceeds of closure catapulting anything anywhere.&quot;

&quot;Dow Jones&#x27;s marketing people didn’t know how to sell it as it competed with the &quot;Asian Wall Street Journal&quot;—they ignored it and killed it by sheer neglect,&quot; said V.G. Kulkarni, a former editor at the Review.

&quot;The final insult to the Review, and indeed to Asia, was Dow Jones&#x27; refusal to sell the title. It has had plenty of offers—which would benefit its own shareholders&quot;, says Bowring, &quot;There is a parallel here between Time and &quot;Asiaweek&quot;. Time bought locally born &quot;Asiaweek&quot; even though it appeared to be in direct competition for readers and advertising. Not so long afterwards, Time closed &quot;Asiaweek&quot; rather than its ailing &quot;Time Asia&quot;. It was corporate imperialism more than commercial sense which brought Dow Jones to buy control of the &quot;Review&quot;, which was a direct competitor for niche regional advertising. It is clear that the closure of the &quot;Review&quot;, as of &quot;Asiaweek&quot;, represents an attack on diversity and further reduction in the variety of print media.&quot;

&quot;The magazine lost its way because people in New York thought they understood what the readers wanted more than those who were on the ground in Asia&quot;, wrote Bowring. Bowring claims that House infused the &quot;Review&quot;″s editorials with the right wing and furiously pro-western sentiments of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;.

Under its previous editor, Derek Davies, the &quot;Review&quot; had carved a name for itself for the excellence of its economic reporting, its refusal to be cowed and its wide-ranging book reviews. When Dow Jones took over the &quot;Review&quot; it introduced pompous &quot;editorials&quot;; indulged in numerous revisions to the format, each more disastrous than the last; brought in large numbers of American journalists and editors at the expense of well-established writers who knew the region; moved the focus from business and politics to &quot;innovation&quot; and &quot;lifestyle&quot;, neither of which was of interest to its core readership; and dramatically reduced the scope of the book review section. When Dow Jones took control of the magazine, efforts to introduce more lifestyle features sparked protests from Review loyalists—as did its decision to make it into a monthly rather than a weekly title.

&quot;I don&#x27;t think Dow Jones ever understood what our culture was and they never really put in the effort to make the magazine succeed&quot;, said John McBeth, who joined the magazine in 1979. Dow Jones turned it into a snappy, happy, trend-conscious delight for the Internet age. It was a failed effort &quot;to lure readers who presumably don&#x27;t care about thoughtful coverage of politics and economics but do want to know which wine goes with which chili pepper.&quot; The reporting staff of the &quot;Review&quot; and the &quot;Asian Wall Street Journal&quot; were merged in 2001. More significantly, at that time the ad sales staff of the two publications were also merged. Two senior correspondents said they had frequently been asked by executives at Asian corporations they covered why the magazine&#x27;s advertising staff were hard to reach and would often not return phone calls. &quot;There was no effort put in&quot;, said one. &quot;They didn&#x27;t
even try.&quot; McBeth gave an account of the closure of the &quot;Review&quot; in a chapter called &#x27;Death of a Magazine&#x27; in his book entitled &quot;Reporter. Forty Years Covering Asia.&quot;

T. J. S. George, co-founder of &quot;Asiaweek&quot;, says, &quot;In due course, Time Inc. killed &quot;Asiaweek&quot; and Dow Jones (now a Murdoch property) killed the &quot;Review&quot;. Murdoch–Dow&#x27;s &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; and Time Inc.&#x27;s &quot;Time&quot; magazine now fly the American flag over Asia, unchallenged by lesser flags.&quot;

==Independent journalistic establishments==
Besides qualified business reports, the &quot;Review&quot; was also the pioneer of independent journalistic establishments throughout Asia. Many of the articles from the first few decades were exclusive sources of information on the development of China, such as the reports on Chairman Mao Zedong, the Cultural Revolution, and the economic opening initiated by Deng Xiaoping.

==Readership==
the &quot;Review&quot; targeted markets in Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Southeast Asia. It reached an elite group of readers from the government, the business world and the academic sector. The magazine had a circulation of 93,055 in 2003. In September 2006, the magazine was banned in Singapore.

==Reports by the &quot;Review&quot;==
&quot;China&#x27;s Elite&quot; was a yearly side-publication by the &quot;Review&quot;. Focusing on China&#x27;s leading executives and their way of business, &quot;China&#x27;s Elite&quot; was often praised as a valuable source of information on statistics, expectations, and objective analysis obtained through in-depth interviews with leading businessmen in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou.

The &quot;Review 200&quot; was a tied publication by the &quot;Far Eastern Economic Review&quot; that ranked the top 200 leading businesses across Asia on an annual basis.

Published every two years since 1989 by the &quot;Review&quot;, &quot;Managing in Asia&quot; provided entrepreneurs with a clear description and explanation of Asia&#x27;s business position. The report offered valuable information in the aspects of economic outlook, business challenges and economic issues, personal investment, technology/office automation, brand perception, ownership of products, travel habits, etc.

The &quot;Asia Lifestyles&quot; was published in alternating years. It conducted surveys on business executives and questioned their lifestyles, habits, and aspirations.

The &quot;Review&quot; regularly published special reports focused on topics that were relevant and significant to Asia. For example, a special report on the HIV/AIDS epidemic was published in its 15 July 2004 issue.

The &quot;Review&quot; regularly interviewed government officials and other important people who had an impact in the region and the business world. In the past, the &quot;Review&quot; has interviewed Colin Powell, the U.S. former secretary of state (issue date: 28 October 2004); Kofi Annan, the secretary-general of United Nations (issue date: 22 July 2004); Chen Shui-bian, the Taiwanese president (issue date: 24 July 2003); Bill Gates, chairman and co-founder of Microsoft (issue date: 14 March 2002); and many more influential people.

In 2002 and 2003 the &quot;Review&quot; was awarded the &quot;Excellence in Specialized Reporting&quot; by the Society of Publishers in Asia (SOPA). In 2004 it was awarded the &quot;Honourable Mention for Magazine Front Cover Design&quot; by SOPA. In 2005 it was awarded the &quot;Excellence in Magazines&quot; and &quot;Honorable Mention for Reporting on the Environment&quot; by the SOPA.

== Legal issues ==
The &quot;Review&quot;&#x27;s China correspondent, Serge Ivanovitch Kost, was arrested there during the Cultural Revolution and sentenced to 15 years&#x27; imprisonment. He later emigrated to Australia.

In late 1970s, Ho Kwon Ping, the &quot;Review&quot;&#x27;s Singapore correspondent, was accused of endangering national security, jailed and held in solitary confinement for two months under the Internal Security Act, performed a televised confession, and was fined S$3,000.

Lee Kuan Yew later charged the &quot;Review&quot; editor, Derek Davies, of participating in &quot;a diabolical international Communist plot&quot; to poison relations between Singapore and neighbouring Malaysia.

In 1987 Lee restricted sale of the &quot;Review&quot; in Singapore after it published an article about the detention of Roman Catholic church workers, reducing circulation of the magazine from 9,000 to 500 copies, on the grounds that it was &quot;interfering in the domestic politics of Singapore.&quot;

Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad filed a lawsuit against the &quot;Review&quot; in 1987 over an article published by the magazine, which claimed that the Malaysian government intended to sell Limbang to Brunei. Both parties reached an out-of-court settlement in March 1991, with the magazine agreeing to publish an apology notice and pay a settlement fee of fifty thousand Malaysian ringgit.

The 4 April 2002 issue of the &quot;Review&quot; was banned in Bangladesh because its cover story, &quot;Bangladesh: Cocoon of Terror&quot;, described the country as besieged by &quot;Islamic fundamentalism, religious intolerance, militant Muslim groups with links to international terrorist groups.&quot;

In 2006, after the publication of an article of an interview with Chee Soon Juan, party leader of the Singapore Democratic Party, on Singapore&#x27;s prime minister Lee Hsien Loong and his father and minister mentor, Lee Kuan Yew, Lee Kuan Yew and Lee Hsien Loong both sued the publication for defamation, alleging the magazine had suggested they were corrupt. The Singapore government banned the sale and distribution of the journal.

In 2007, during the International Bar Association&#x27;s Rule of Law symposium, then-deputy prime minister S. Jayakumar states that the &quot;Review&quot; did not satisfy regulations for foreign publications in Singapore such as appointing a representative to accept service of any notice or legal process, and submitting a security deposit. The lack of compliance to the regulations led to the &quot;Review&quot; not being able to circulate its publication in Singapore and was not due to the legal suit.

On 24 September 2008, the High Court of Singapore, in a summary judgement by Justice Woo Bih Li, ruled that the &quot;Far Eastern Economic Review&quot; and Hugo Restall, its editor, defamed Lee Kuan Yew and his son, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in its October 2006 article &quot;Singapore&#x27;s &#x27;Martyr&#x27;, Chee Soon Juan&quot;. FEER appealed but lost the case when the Court of Appeal ruled in October 2009 that the &quot;Far Eastern Economic Review&quot; did defame the country&#x27;s founder Lee Kuan Yew and his son Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.

== Awards presented by the &quot;Review&quot; ==
The Young Inventors Awards (YIA), which began in 2000, was organised by the &quot;Review&quot; in association with Hewlett-Packard (HP). The purpose of the Awards program was to foster a spirit of scientific invention and innovation among students in the Asia–Pacific regions, including China, Philippines, Singapore, India, and Australia. Students who won the award were socially recognised and financially supported for their outstanding efforts and projects. The &quot;Review&quot; also presented the annual Asian Innovation Awards.

<doc id="346489" wikidata="Q602011" url="?curid=346489" title="Algebraic quantum field theory">
<text>Algebraic quantum field theory (AQFT) is an application to local quantum physics of C*-algebra theory. Also referred to as the Haag–Kastler [[axiomatic framework]] for quantum field theory, because it was introduced by . The axioms are stated in terms of an algebra given for every open set in Minkowski space, and mappings between those.

== Haag–Kastler axioms ==

Let formula_1 be the set of all open and bounded subsets of Minkowski space. An algebraic quantum field theory is defined via a set formula_2 of von Neumann algebras formula_3 on a common Hilbert space formula_4 satisfying the following axioms: 
* &quot;Isotony&quot;: formula_5 implies formula_6.
* &quot;Causality&quot;: If formula_7 is space-like separated from formula_8, then formula_9.
* &quot;Poincaré covariance&quot;: A strongly continuous unitary representation formula_10 of the Poincaré group formula_11 on formula_4 exists such that formula_13
* &quot;Spectrum condition&quot;: The joint spectrum formula_14 of the energy-momentum operator formula_15 (i.e. the generator of space-time translations) is contained in the closed forward lightcone.
* &quot;Existence of a vacuum vector&quot;: A cyclic and Poincaré-invariant vector formula_16 exists.

The net algebras formula_3 are called &quot;local algebras&quot; and the C* algebra formula_18 is called the &quot;quasilocal algebra&quot;.

== Category-theoretic formulation ==
Let Mink be the category of open subsets of Minkowski space M with inclusion maps as morphisms. We are given a covariant functor formula_19 from Mink to uC*alg, the category of unital C* algebras, such that every morphism in Mink maps to a monomorphism in uC*alg (isotony).

The Poincaré group acts continuously on Mink. There exists a pullback of this action, which is continuous in the norm topology of formula_20 (Poincaré covariance).

Minkowski space has a causal structure. If an open set &quot;V&quot; lies in the causal complement of an open set &quot;U&quot;, then the image of the maps

:formula_21

and

:formula_22

commute (spacelike commutativity). If formula_23 is the causal completion of an open set &quot;U&quot;, then formula_24 is an isomorphism (primitive causality).

A state with respect to a C*-algebra is a positive linear functional over it with unit norm. If we have a state over formula_20, we can take the &quot;partial trace&quot; to get states associated with formula_26 for each open set via the net monomorphism. The states over the open sets form a presheaf structure.

According to the GNS construction, for each state, we can associate a Hilbert space representation of formula_27 Pure states correspond to irreducible representations and mixed states correspond to reducible representations. Each irreducible representation (up to equivalence) is called a superselection sector. We assume there is a pure state called the vacuum such that the Hilbert space associated with it is a unitary representation of the Poincaré group compatible with the Poincaré covariance of the net such that if we look at the Poincaré algebra, the spectrum with respect to energy-momentum (corresponding to spacetime translations) lies on and in the positive light cone. This is the vacuum sector.

== QFT in curved spacetime ==
More recently, the approach has been further implemented to include an algebraic version of quantum field theory in curved spacetime. Indeed, the viewpoint of local quantum physics is in particular suitable to generalize the renormalization procedure to the theory of quantum fields developed on curved backgrounds. Several rigorous results concerning QFT in presence of a black hole have been obtained.

<text>Reed is a common name for several tall, grass-like plants of wetlands.

==Varieties==
They are all members of the order Poales (in the modern, expanded circumscription), and include:

===In the grass family, Poaceae=== 
* Common reed (&quot;Phragmites australis&quot;), the original species named reed
* Giant reed (&quot;Arundo donax&quot;), used for making reeds for musical instruments
* Burma reed (&quot;Neyraudia reynaudiana&quot;)
* Reed canary-grass (&quot;Phalaris arundinacea&quot;)
* Reed sweet-grass (&quot;Glyceria maxima&quot;)
* Small-reed (&quot;Calamagrostis&quot; species)

===In the sedge family, Cyperaceae===
* Paper reed or papyrus (&quot;Cyperus papyrus&quot;), the source of the Ancient Egyptian writing material, also used for making boats

===In the family Typhaceae===
* Bur-reed (&quot;Sparganium&quot; species)
* Reed-mace (&quot;Typha&quot; species), also called bulrush or cattail

===In the family Restionaceae===
* Cape thatching reed (&quot;Elegia tectorum&quot;), a restio originating from the South-western Cape, South Africa.
* Thatching reed (&quot;Thamnochortus insignis&quot;), another restio species originating from the same geographic region.

==Use in construction==

Many different cultures have used reeds in construction of buildings of various types for at least thousands of years. One contemporary example is the Marsh Arabs.

===Thatching===
&quot;Phragmites australis&quot;, the common reed, is used in many areas for thatching roofs. In the United Kingdom, common reed used for this purpose is known as &quot;Norfolk reed&quot; or &quot;water reed&quot;. However, &quot;wheat reed&quot; and &quot;Devon reed&quot; are not reeds but long-stemmed wheat straw.

==Use in music==
Ancient Greeks used &quot;Arundo donax&quot; to make flutes known as kalamaulos; this is a compound word, from kalamos (cane) + aulos (flute). At the time, the best cane for flutes came from the banks of river Kephissos, in Attica, Greece. Several kalamaulos tuned differently and tied together, made a syrinx or Panpipes. &quot;A. donax&quot; is still the principal source material of reed makers for clarinets, saxophones, oboes, bassoons, bagpipes, and other woodwind instruments. The Var country in southern France contains the best-known supply of instrument reeds.

==Other uses==
Bamboo and, even more commonly, rattan stems are used as &quot;reed sticks&quot; to wick and disperse the scent of essential oils in aroma diffusers. (See .)

Certain reed species were used in the manufacture of the writing implement, Reed pens, by scribes of antiquity. The use is still in practice today within the field of Art, specifically Calligraphy. (see .)

<doc id="346492" wikidata="Q1079190" url="?curid=346492" title="Switcher locomotive">
<text>A switcher locomotive (American English), shunter locomotive (British English), or shifter locomotive (Pennsylvania Railroad terminology) is a locomotive used for maneuvering railway vehicles over short distances. Switchers do not usually move trains over long distances. Instead, they typically assemble trains in order for another locomotive to take over. Switchers often operate in a railyard or make short transfer runs. They may serve as the primary motive power on short branch lines or switching and terminal railroads.

Switchers are optimized for their role, being relatively low-powered but with a high starting tractive effort for getting heavy cars rolling quickly. Switchers are geared to produce high torque but are restricted to low top speeds and have small diameter driving wheels. Switchers tend to be durable and to remain in service for a long time, such as the Swedish class U.

American, Russian, Indian and Chinese switchers tend to be larger, with bogies to allow them to be used on tight radiuses. Western European shunters tend to be smaller and more often have fixed axles. They also often maintained coupling rods for longer than other locomotive types, although bogie types have long been used where very heavy loads are involved, such as at steelworks.

==Etymology==
A switcher may also be called a yard pilot, switch engine, or yard goat.

The term can also be used to describe the workers operating these engines or engaged in directing shunting operations. Switching locomotives may be purpose-built engines, but may also be downgraded main-line engines, or simply main-line engines assigned to switching. Switchers can also be used on short excursion train rides.

==Power types==
===Diesel===
Diesel switchers tend to have a high cab and often lower and/or narrower hoods (bonnets) containing the diesel engines, for all round visibility. Slugs are often used because they allow even greater tractive effort to be applied. Nearly all slugs used for switching are of the low hood, cabless variety. Good visibility in both directions is critical, because a switcher may be running in either direction; turning the locomotive is time-consuming. Some earlier diesel switchers used cow–calf configurations of two powered units in order to provide greater power.

Modern diesel switchers are usually diesel-electric locomotives.

===Electric===
The majority of modern switchers are diesels, but countries with near-total electrification, like Switzerland, use electric switchers. Prior to the introduction of diesel-electric locomotives, electric shunting locomotives were used to an extent in Great Britain where heavy trains needed to be started on steep gradients. The steeply-graded Quayside Branch in Newcastle upon Tyne was electrified by the North Eastern Railway in 1905, and two steeplecab locomotives were built to handle all traffic on the line. One of these, No. 1, is now part of the National Collection and resides at Locomotion in Shildon. On the opposite side of the Tyne, the electrified lines owned by the Harton Coal Company in South Shields for the movement of coal and colliery waste to shipping facilities on the river was one of the more extensive industrial networks. A number of the early German locomotives built for use on these lines have been preserved. 

Electric locomotives were also extensively employed for moving the coke cars at cokeworks, obtaining power from a side wire, as third rail or overhead line electrification would have been impractical. These specialised locomotives were tall steeple-cab types not seen anywhere else, and operated on a short length of track between the ovens and the quenching tower. Despite their ubiquity, very few have survived into preservation as there is very little scope of operating them due to their unique means of obtaining power, slow speed and the fact they greatly exceed the loading gauge of most railway lines. One example built by Greenwood and Batley in Armley, Leeds is preserved at the Middleton Railway, not far from where it was built.

Small industrial shunters are sometimes battery powered type. An early battery-powered shunting locomotive is shown here. The Tyne and Wear Metro has three battery electric shunters built by Hunslet, which are used to haul engineering trains when the overhead supply is switched off. New Zealand Railways imported and manufactured locally battery-electric shunters in the 1920s: the EB class and the E class (1922)

===Electro-diesel===
Some switchers are electro-diesel, and hence can be powered from onboard diesel engines, or from an external electricity supply.

===Steam===
Steam shunter/switchers are now mostly out of service. Steam switchers were either tank locomotives or had special (smaller) tenders, with narrow coal bunkers and/or sloped tender decks to increase rearward visibility. Headlights, where carried, were mounted on both ends. Most were either side-tank or saddle-tank types, however in the usual departure from its neighbours&#x27; practice, the Great Western Railway used pannier tanks for shunting and branch line work, a practice which the Western Region of BR perpetuated until steam traction was phased out, with several examples joining a 9F as banking engines to assist locomotives on the notoriously arduous ascent of the Lickey Incline, replacing the LMS &quot;Jinties&quot; which had formerly carried out the task alongside &quot;Big Bertha&quot;.

As diesel shunters began to appear in ever-increasing numbers, attempts were made by companies such as Sentinel to adapt the vertical boilers from their steam powered road vehicles for use in shunting locomotives, in order to compete with the newcomers. Although these were found to be equal in power and efficiency to most of the early diesel designs, their development came too late to have any real impact. Outwardly, they bear more resemblance to diesels than steam locomotives. A number have been preserved on heritage railways, although few of these are in working order, being designed very specifically for shunting work and lacking the necessary speed to travel any kind of distance.

Small industrial shunters have sometimes been fireless locomotives and a few of these are still at work in Germany. Again, several have been preserved, but are mostly static displays, as heritage railways and museums lack the large source of high-pressure steam (such as a power station&#x27;s boilers) needed to charge the locomotive&#x27;s accumulator.

==By region==
===United States===
American switchers tend to be larger, and are almost always powered by diesel.

Most American switchers are actually road switchers, which are larger and have greater power output, to be used on mainlines.

===Great Britain===
British shunters are much smaller than those used in the United States. Current British shunters are 0-6-0 diesel-electrics, Class 08 and Class 09, of 350-400 horsepower. These were developed from similar locomotives supplied by the English Electric Company to the Big Four British railway companies in the 1930s and 1940s, e.g. those pioneered by the LMS. Similar locomotives were exported to the Netherlands (e.g. NS Class 600) and Australia (e.g. Victorian Railways F class (diesel)). The use of shunting locomotives saw a sharp decline in Britain in the latter half of the 20th century, largely due to the contraction of the network, increased competition from road traffic and widespread adoption of train-load freight, with fixed rakes of wagons moving mainly bulk products between rapid-loading facilities, as opposed to thousands of sidings and goods depots feeding trains of assorted wagons into the marshalling yards.

===Continental Europe===
In continental Europe 0-6-0 (or &quot;C&quot;) diesel-hydraulics, similar to the short-lived British Rail Class 14, are widely used. A very common type is the DB Class V 60 and its variants. For lightweight shunting of single wagons or short trains, two-axle shunters are common; in Germany these are known as Kleinlokomotive (small locomotive).

<text>Welwyn Garden City ( ) is a town in Hertfordshire, England, north of London. It was the second garden city in England (founded 1920) and one of the first new towns (designated 1948). It is unique in being both a garden city and a new town and exemplifies the physical, social and cultural planning ideals of the periods in which it was built.

== History ==
Welwyn Garden City was founded by Sir Ebenezer Howard in 1920 following his previous experiment in Letchworth Garden City. Howard had called for the creation of planned towns that were to combine the benefits of the city and the countryside and to avoid the disadvantages of both. It was designed to be &#x27;The Perfect Town&#x27;. The Garden Cities and Town Planning Association had defined a garden city as

&quot;a town designed for healthy living and industry of a size that makes possible a full measure of social life but not larger, surrounded by a rural belt; the whole of the land being in public ownership, or held in trust for the community&quot;

In 1919, Howard arranged for the purchase of land in Hertfordshire that had already been identified as a suitable site. A company called Second Garden City Limited was formed in October 1919 to start buying the land and developing the town. On 4 February 1920, the company&#x27;s board decided to call the new garden city Digswell, taking the name of the existing small village which would be surrounded by the development. Six days later they changed their minds, deciding instead to call it Welwyn Garden City, reflecting that the project was already being discussed generally as the &quot;new garden city near Welwyn&quot;. On 29 April 1920, the company changed its name to become Welwyn Garden City Limited. Sir Theodore Chambers chaired the company, whilst Louis de Soissons was appointed as architect and town planner, Charles Purdom as finance director and Frederic Osborn as secretary. The first house was occupied just before Christmas 1920.
The town is laid out along tree-lined boulevards with a neo-Georgian town centre. It has its own environmental protection legislation, the Scheme of Management for Welwyn Garden City. Every road has a wide grass verge. The spine of the town is Parkway, a central mall or scenic parkway, almost a mile long. The view along Parkway to the south was once described as one of the world&#x27;s finest urban vistas. Older houses are on the west side of Parkway and newer houses on the east side

The original planners intended that all the residents of the garden city would shop in one shop and created the Welwyn Stores, a monopoly which caused some local resentment. Commercial pressures have since ensured much more competition and variety, and the Welwyn Stores were in 1984 taken over by the John Lewis Partnership.

In 1948, Welwyn Garden City was designated a new town under the New Towns Act 1946 (9 &amp; 10 Geo. 6. c. 68) and the Welwyn Garden City company handed its assets to the Welwyn Garden City Development Corporation. Louis de Soissons remained as its planning consultant. That year &quot;The Times&quot; compared Welwyn Garden City with Hatfield. It described Welwyn Garden City as a world-famous modern new town developed as an experiment in community planning and Hatfield as an unplanned settlement created by sporadic building in the open country. &quot;Welwyn, though far from perfect, made the New Towns Act possible, just as Hatfield, by its imperfection, made it necessary.&quot; In 1966, the Development Corporation was wound up and handed over to the Commission for New Towns. The housing stock, neighbourhood shopping and green spaces were passed to Welwyn Hatfield District Council between 1978 and 1983.

The New QEII Hospital, completed in June 2015, offers outpatient, diagnostic and ante/postnatal services.

A shopping mall, the Howard Centre, was built in the 1980s, incorporating a replacement for the original &quot;temporary&quot; railway station.

There is a resurgence of interest in the ethos of the garden city and the type of neighbourhood and community advocated by Howard, prompted by the problems of metropolitan and regional development and the importance of sustainability in government policy.

On the outskirts of Old Welwyn village, the Welwyn Roman baths are preserved in a steel vault underneath junction 6 of the A1(M) and are open to visitors.

The local civic society, which aims to preserve and conserve the garden city ethos, is the Welwyn Garden City Society.

The international ecumenical Focolare movement has its British headquarters at Welwyn Garden City.

In 2008, during construction of a site for HSBC, 60 unsecured argonite fire suppressant cylinders discharged, killing one person, injuring six others and causing substantial damage. Three firms were later convicted of health and safety offences.

2020 saw the 100th anniversary for Welwyn Garden City with a series of celebrations planned. They could not all be done amidst the Coronavirus pandemic.

Welwyn Garden City had a population of 46,619 in 2011, and 51,735 (estimated) in 2016.

== Governance ==

Welwyn Garden City is part of the Welwyn Hatfield Borough and comprises seven local authority wards. It is in the county of Hertfordshire and the parliamentary constituency of Welwyn Hatfield. Welwyn Hatfield Borough Council has its offices in Welwyn Garden City. The MP for Welwyn Hatfield is Andrew Lewin (Labour). The nearby town of Hatfield and the village of Welwyn have parish councils with limited responsibilities, but Welwyn Garden City has none, although it had one between 1921 and 1927.

===Administrative history===
The land earmarked for the town in 1920 straddled the parishes of Hatfield, Digswell, Welwyn and Tewin. On 1 October 1921, a civil parish called Welwyn Garden City was created from parts of those four parishes. The new parish was initially part of the Welwyn Rural District. By 1923, the Welwyn Garden City parish council was based in offices on Bridge Road, on the edge of the site identified for the new town centre of the garden city.

===Welwyn Garden City Urban District (19271974)===
The parish of Welwyn Garden City was made an urban district on 1 April 1927, making it independent of the Welwyn Rural District Council.

New offices were built on the site of the former parish council&#x27;s offices at the corner of Bridge Road and The Campus. The new building was formally opened in January 1937. This building served as the headquarters of Welwyn Garden City Urban District Council until its abolition in 1974. Between 20 May 1948 and 31 March 1966 the development of the town was also administered by the Welwyn Garden City Development Corporation, set up under the New Towns Act 1946 (9 &amp; 10 Geo. 6. c. 68).

Welwyn Garden City Urban District Council was granted a coat of arms on 15 December 1958.

Welwyn Garden City Urban District was abolished under the Local Government Act 1972, merging with Welwyn Rural District and Hatfield Rural District to become the district of Welwyn Hatfield on 1 April 1974. There are some successor civil parish created for the town, and so it is governed directly by Welwyn Hatfield District Council (Borough Council after 2006). The Welwyn Garden City Urban District Council&#x27;s former offices at The Campus are still used by Welwyn Hatfield Borough Council as its headquarters.

== Geography ==
Welwyn Garden City experiences a maritime or oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;), in common with the rest of the United Kingdom. The town experiences warm summers and cool winters.

== Economy ==

Ever since its inception as a garden city, Welwyn Garden City has attracted a strong commercial base with several designated employment areas. Among the companies trading in the town are:

*Henleys Medical Supplies Ltd
*Baxters
*British Lead Mills
*Cashbrokers
*The Danish Bacon Company (DBC foodservice)
*Emis Professional Publishing
*Figleaves.com
*HSBC&#x27;s high-security global data centre
*Roche
*Ocado
*PayPoint
*Ratcliff Palfinger
*Duncan Print Group
*Sigma Corporation
*Tesco has its head office at Shire Park, a business park in the north-east of the town. The site was once an ICI chemical works. Tesco gradually moved there from the late 1990s and closed its original Cheshunt head office in favour of additional Shire Park buildings.
*VEGA Group
*Welwyn Tool Group (formerly Welwyn Tool Company)
*Hertfordshire County Council&#x27;s county supplies and contract services centre

Welwyn Garden City was once well known as the home of the breakfast cereal Shredded Wheat, formerly made by Nabisco. With its large white silos, the disused Nabisco Shredded Wheat Factory is a landmark on rail routes between London and the north of England. The factory, designed by de Soissons and built in 1924 by Peter Lind &amp; Company, is a Grade II listed building. Production moved to the Cereal Partners factory at Staverton, Wiltshire in 2007 when the owner, Nestlé, decided that the factory required significant and prohibitive investment, due to the age of the building. Tesco applied to build a supermarket on the site, but planning permission was refused by the local authority in January 2012 after significant public protest. In December 2018, the newly renamed &quot;Wheat Quarter&quot; area had planning permission approved for complete area redevelopment, consisting of 1,454 units, mainly homes, as well as office, retail and community uses.

The former supermarket chain Fine Fare had its head office in the town at one time, as did ICI&#x27;s Plastics Division.

There used to be a Xerox office located in Welwyn Garden City but it closed in 2016.

There is a Sainsbury&#x27;s in the town centre, and a Morrisons in Panshanger.

<text>Tullimonstrum, colloquially known as the Tully monster or sometimes Tully&#x27;s monster, is an extinct genus of soft-bodied bilaterian animal that lived in shallow tropical coastal waters of muddy estuaries during the Pennsylvanian geological period, about 300 million years ago. A single species, T. gregarium, is known. Examples of &quot;Tullimonstrum&quot; have been found only in the Essex biota, a smaller section of the Mazon Creek fossil beds of Illinois, United States. Its classification has been the subject of controversy, and interpretations of the fossil have likened it to molluscs, arthropods, conodonts, worms, tunicates, and vertebrates. This creature had a mostly cigar-shaped body, with a triangular tail fin, two long stalked eyes, and a proboscis tipped with a mouth-like appendage. Based on the fossils, it seems this creature was a nektonic carnivore that hunted in the ocean’s water column. When &quot;Tullimonstrum&quot; was alive, Illinois was a mixture of ecosystems like muddy estuaries, marine environments, and rivers and lakes. Fossils of other organisms like crustacean &quot;Belotelson&quot;, the cnidarian &quot;Essexella&quot;, and the elasmobranch fish &quot;Bandringa&quot; have been found alongside &quot;Tullimonstrum.&quot;

== Description ==

&quot;Tullimonstrum&quot; probably reached lengths of up to ; the smallest individuals are about long.

&quot;Tullimonstrum&quot; had a pair of vertical, ventral fins (though the fidelity of preservation of fossils of its soft body makes this difficult to determine) situated at the tail end of its body, and typically featured a long proboscis with up to eight small sharp teeth on each &quot;jaw&quot;, with which it may have actively probed for small creatures and edible detritus in the muddy bottom. It was part of the ecological community represented in the unusually rich group of soft-bodied organisms found among the assemblage called the Mazon Creek fossils from their site in Grundy County, Illinois.

The absence of a hard part in the fossil implies that the animal did not possess organs composed of bone, chitin or calcium carbonate. There is evidence of serially repeated internal structures. Its head is poorly differentiated. A transverse bar-shaped structure, which was either dorsal or ventral, terminates in two round organs which are associated with dark material which have been identified as melanosomes (containing the pigment melanin). Their form and structure is suggestive of a camera-type eye. &quot;Tullimonstrum&quot; possessed structures which have been interpreted as gills, and a possible notochord or rudimentary spinal cord.

== History of discovery ==
Amateur collector found the first of these fossils in 1955 in a fossil bed known as the Mazon Creek formation. He took the strange creature to the Field Museum of Natural History, but paleontologists were stumped as to which phylum &quot;Tullimonstrum&quot; belonged in. The species &quot;Tullimonstrum gregarium&quot; (&quot;Tully&#x27;s common monster&quot;), as these fossils later were named, takes its genus name from Tully, whereas the species name, &quot;gregarium&quot;, means &quot;common&quot;, and reflects its abundance. The term &quot;monstrum&quot; (&quot;monster&quot;) relates to the creature&#x27;s outlandish appearance and strange body plan.

The fossil remains &quot;a puzzle&quot;, and interpretations liken it to a worm, a mollusc, an arthropod, a conodont, or a vertebrate. Since it appears to lack characteristics of the well-known modern phyla, some speculate that it was representative of a stem group to one of the many phyla of worms that are poorly represented today. Similarities with Cambrian fossil organisms were noted. Chen &quot;et al&quot;. suggested similarities to &quot;Nectocaris pteryx&quot;. Others pointed to a general resemblance between &quot;Tullimonstrum&quot; and &quot;Opabinia regalis&quot;, although Cave &quot;et al&quot;. note that they were too morphologically dissimilar to be related.

== Classification ==
The classification of &quot;Tullimonstrum&quot; has been an ongoing debate since the creature was first described, with many scientists presenting evidence of a vertebrate affinity, and others of an invertebrate affinity.

=== Arguments in favor of vertebrate affinities ===

==== McCoy et al. (2016) ====

In 2016 two studies were released simultaneously showing that &quot;Tullimonstrum&quot; may have been a basal vertebrate, thus a member of the phylum Chordata. McCoy &quot;et al.&quot; undertook a morphological study of several specimens; their analysis indicated that &quot;Tullimonstrum&quot; may be closely related to modern lampreys. This affinity was attributed based on pronounced cartilaginous vertebral structures known as arcualia, a dorsal fin and asymmetric caudal fin, keratinous teeth, a single nostril, and tectal cartilages like in lampreys. While McCoy &quot;et al&quot;. raised the possibility that &quot;Tullimonstrum&quot; belong to the ancestral group of lamprey, it also has many features not found in Cyclostomes (lampreys and hagfishes).

==== Clements et al. (2016) ====
A second study, by Clements &quot;et al.&quot; (2016), came to the conclusion that &quot;Tullimonstrum&quot; was a stem-vertebrate based on its eye anatomy. Close examination revealed that the animal had a camera-like eye, with preserved lenses and the presence of cylindrical and spheroid melanosomes arranged in distinct layers. These ocular pigments and their unique structure was interpreted to be a retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE), offering strong support that the bar organs were indeed eyes. The dark pigments in the eye were chemically tested and found to be fossilized melanin, as opposed to ommochromes or pterins (which are ocular pigments used by many invertebrate groups). While the authors admitted that the ocular pigments of many invertebrate groups have been poorly investigated, at the time of publication the presence of RPE and two distinct melanosome morphology is a uniquely vertebrate trait.

==== McCoy et al. (2020); Wiemann et al. (2022) ====
In 2020, McCoy, Wiemann and colleagues used Raman spectroscopy to identify the molecular bonds present in the organic material preserved with &quot;Tullimonstrum&quot;. Based on samples from multiple points in the body, they identified the organic material as representing the decay products of chordate tissues as opposed to the polysaccharide-based chitin (as is seen in arthropods), offering independent and rather unambiguous evidence for the interpretation that &quot;Tullimonstrum&quot; is a chordate or vertebrate. In 2022, Wiemann and colleagues replicated these spectral signals in collaboration with independent laboratories using Fourier-Transform Infrared spectroscopy. Comparable tissue signatures have been detected in preserved carbonaceous remains of a diversity of other animals.

=== Arguments in favour of non-vertebrate affinities ===

==== Sallan et al. (2017) ====
In 2017 Sallan &quot;et al&quot;. rejected the identification of the Tully monster as a vertebrate. Firstly, they noted that even the presence of the two melanosome types is variable among vertebrates; hagfish lack them altogether, and extant sharks as well as extinct forms found in the Mazon Creek area, such as &quot;Bandringa&quot;, only have spheroid melanosomes. Additionally, the supposed notochord extends in front of the level of the eyes, which is not the case in any other vertebrate, although is seen in lancelets. Even if the structure was a notochord, the presence of notochords is not limited to vertebrates either.

Further criticism was drawn towards the identification of the blocks of the body variously as gill pouches and muscle blocks (myomeres), despite the lack of differentiation in the structure of these blocks. In vertebrates, myomeres are also thinner, and extend along the whole length of the body rather than stopping short of the head. Meanwhile, the gill pouches of lampreys are paired extensions rather than segmented structures, and are usually embedded in a complex gill skeleton, neither of which is the case in &quot;Tullimonstrum&quot;.

Other identifications of soft-tissue structures were considered as being equally problematic. The supposed brain has no associated nervous tissue and is not connected to the eyes, and the purported liver was located under the gills as opposed to being further back as in other vertebrates. The &quot;mouth&quot; at the front of the proboscis was described as possessing gnathostome-like distinct tooth rows, despite lampreys having &quot;tooth fields&quot; on the interior of the mouth. This would necessitate the convergent re-evolution of grasping jaws.

An additional difficulty is that the thin and jointed proboscis is inconsistent with the feeding methods typically used for open-water vertebrates: either ram or suction feeding. The gill pouches would have obstructed the flow of water even further.

Sallan &quot;et al&quot;. note that stalked eyes, tail fins, and brains are also present in anomalocaridids, and that &quot;Opabinia&quot; also has a similar proboscis. Previously arthropod affinities were rejected under the presumption that other Mazon Creek arthropods are preserved in three-dimensions, with carbonization of the exoskeleton, but the arthropods are not actually preserved in that manner. They also suggested that molluscs convergently evolved complex camera-like eyes containing melanosomes, but proponents of the vertebrate interpretation argue that no molluscs are known that have or had melanosomes in two distinct forms. Further similarities (such as the lobed brain, muscle bands, tail fin, proboscis, and &quot;teeth&quot;) could support possible molluscan affinities.

==== Rogers et al. (2019) ====
Regardless, Rogers &quot;et al.&quot; (2019) demonstrated that certain squid (&quot;Loligo vulgaris&quot;) and cuttlefish (&quot;Sepia officinalis&quot;) species do in fact have two different melanosome forms which can decay to look like an RPE-like layer, similar to that observed in vertebrates and &quot;Tullimonstrum&quot; fossils. On a plot of trace metal signatures in the eyes of Mazon Creek fossils, &quot;Tullimonstrum&quot; is clearly distinct from both vertebrates (which have a higher concentration of zinc) and the eyespots of the putative cephalopod &quot;Pohlsepia&quot; (however, no evidence of melanosomes were found in &quot;Pohlsepia&quot;, and some studies deny its affinity as cephalopod) - although it should be noted however that these signals are influenced by the fossilisation process. The authors doubt that &quot;Tullimonstrum&quot; was a cephalopod (in the absence of other supporting traits), they argue that eye structure and chemistry alone cannot disprove invertebrate affinities.

Even if the eye of &quot;Tullimonstrum&quot; is homologous with vertebrates, it is not necessarily a member of Vertebrata. Many vertebrate-like traits are also observed in tunicates (the larvae of which have pigmented eyes and tail fins), lancelets and acorn worms (both of which have gill openings and axial support structures), and the extinct vetulicolians.

==== Mikami et al. (2023) ====

In 2023, Mikami &quot;et al.&quot; (2023) scanned 153 specimens of &quot;Tullimonstrum&quot; by 3D scanner, as well as other taxa from Mazon Creek. They concluded that some of the characters used by McCoy et al. (2016) to justify a vertebrate identity (tri-lobed brain, tectal cartilages, fin rays) are not comparable to those of vertebrates. The authors also determined that &quot;Tullimonstrum&quot; has segmentation extending to the preoptic region, which is clearly different from vertebrates. Alternative classifications were discussed in detail, but &quot;Tullimonstrum&quot; could be a non-vertebrate chordate (due to its segmentation resembling the myomeres of &quot;Esconichthys apopyris&quot;, an enigmatic jawed vertebrate from Mazon Creek) or a protostome.

== Paleoecology ==
&quot;Tullimonstrum&quot; was probably a free-swimming carnivore that dwelt in open marine water, and was occasionally washed to the near-shore setting in which it was preserved. This means it swam freely in the water and not clamped to a hard surface or benthic environment.

=== Taphonomy ===
The formation of the Mazon Creek fossils is unusual. When the creatures died, they were rapidly buried in silty outwash. The bacteria that began to decompose the plant and animal remains in the mud produced carbon dioxide in the sediments around the remains. The carbonate combined with iron from the groundwater around the remains, forming encrusting nodules of siderite. The organism was entombed, retarding decay and allowing an impression or carbonaceous remains of the organism to be preserved. The first insights into the mechanisms of carbonaceous preservation in the Mazon Creek are provided as part of a large fossil data set; however, the details are still subject of ongoing research.

The combination of rapid burial and rapid formation of siderite resulted in excellent preservation of the many animals and plants that were entombed in the mud. As a result, the Mazon Creek fossils are one of the world&#x27;s major &quot;Lagerstätten&quot;, or concentrated fossil assemblages. The rapid burial and compression often caused &quot;Tullimonstrum&quot; carcasses to fold and bend like other Mazon Creek animals.

The proboscis is rarely preserved in its entirety; it is complete in around 3% of specimens. However, some part of the organ is preserved in about 50% of cases.

Many unique fossils have been found alongside &quot;Tullimonstrum&quot; like the sea anemone &quot;Essexella&quot;, the malacostracan &quot;Belotelson&quot;, the eurypterid &quot;Adelophthalmus mazonensis&quot;, horseshoe crabs, the elasmobranch fish &quot;Bandringa&quot;, and the coleoid cephalopod &quot;Jeletzkya.&quot;

== Paleontologist&#x27;s prank ==
A 1966–1968 prank promulgated by paleontologist Bryan Patterson suggested that modern representatives could possibly be found in remote lakes of Kenya, known under the local name &quot;Ekurut Loedonkakini&quot;. These &quot;dancing worms of Turkana&quot; could supposedly kill a man with a bite, produced some sort of milk, and were known even to school-age children.

Patterson had several letters sent from Kenya under various aliases to Eugene Richardson, the Field Museum&#x27;s curator of fossil invertebrates. Patterson had previously been the museum&#x27;s curator of vertebrate paleontology and retained an accomplice there who was aware of the prank (and prevented it from going too far). A planned expedition was cancelled after the hoax was disclosed in a good-natured Christmas letter.

Richardson later recounted the story and published the original letters, poems, and doctored photos in a book under the pseudonym E. Scumas Rory.

== In popular culture ==
In 1989, &quot;Tullimonstrum gregarium&quot; was officially designated the state fossil of Illinois. Artwork of it is featured on U-Haul rental vehicles from the state.
