<text>Curtis Lester Patrick (December 31, 1883 – June 1, 1960) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player and coach associated with the Victoria Aristocrats/Cougars of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA; Western Hockey League (WHL) after 1924), and the New York Rangers of the National Hockey League (NHL). Along with his brother Frank Patrick and father Joseph Patrick, he founded the PCHA and helped develop several rules for the game of hockey. Patrick won the Stanley Cup six times as a player, coach and manager.

Born in Drummondville, Quebec, Patrick moved to Montreal with his family at a young age and grew up there, and started playing hockey at this time while also working for his father&#x27;s lumber company. Patrick first played for a top-level team in 1904 when he spent a season with the Brandon Hockey Club in Manitoba, and subsequently played three years in Montreal, winning the Stanley Cup with the Montreal Wanderers in both 1906 and 1907. Moving west to British Columbia with his family in 1907 Patrick played for a local team in Nelson, British Columbia, and was invited to join the Edmonton Hockey Club for a Cup challenge in 1908. Patrick and his brother Frank were lured back east in 1909 by promises of a large salary to join the Renfrew Creamery Kings of the National Hockey Association, though both returned to Nelson after one season with Renfrew.

In 1911 the brothers formed the PCHA, and Patrick owned, managed, coached, and played for the Victoria team. He led the team to a Cup challenge in 1914, and aside from one season with the Seattle Metropolitans in 1917–18 he was with the team until the league was sold off in 1926. While with Victoria he won the Cup again in 1925, the last team outside the National Hockey League (NHL) to do so. Along with Frank, Patrick would introduce many innovations in the PCHA that remain in hockey today, including the blue line, the penalty shot, and tracking assists, among others.

When the WHL, as the PCHA had been renamed in 1924, was sold to the NHL in 1926, Patrick was hired by the expansion New York Rangers to be their coach and manager. He led the team to Stanley Cup wins in 1928 and 1933, along with three further Finals appearances. He resigned as coach in 1939 though remained as manager, winning the Cup in that role again in 1940, before resigning from that role in 1946.

Patrick&#x27;s sons Lynn and Muzz both played for him on the Rangers, and his grandsons Craig and Glenn also played in the NHL. Lynn, Muzz, and Craig all later coached and served as general managers in the NHL as well, while another grandson, Dick is an executive and part-owner of the Washington Capitals; in 2024, great-grandson Chris was named general manager of the Capitals. Patrick&#x27;s contributions to hockey were recognized with his induction into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1947, and he is also the namesake of the NHL&#x27;s Lester Patrick Trophy, awarded for outstanding contributions to hockey in the United States, and the Patrick Division, which existed in the NHL from 1974 to 1993.

==Early life and career==

Patrick&#x27;s father, Joe, was the son of Irish immigrants: Thomas Patrick had emigrated from County Tyrone in Ireland to Canada in 1848 and settled in Quebec. Joe was born in 1857 and in 1883 married Grace Nelson. They moved to Drummondville, Quebec where Joe worked as a general store clerk and Grace was a schoolmarm. Drummondville was predominantly French-speaking and Catholic at the time, making the Anglophone and Methodist Patrick family a minority in the town. Patrick was born on December 31, 1883, in Drummondville, Quebec, the oldest child of Joe and Grace Patrick. In 1887 the family moved to Carmell Hill, where Joe bought a half-interest in a general store with William Mitchell. As in Drummondville the town was mainly Francophone, leading the family to learn French. Joe and his partners sold their store in 1892 earning a substantial profit of $10,000; Joe used his $5,000 to establish a lumber company and built a mill in Daveluyville, which was west of Quebec City. That winter Patrick and his younger brother Frank received their first pair of skates. In 1893 the family moved again, this time to Montreal, as Joe expanded his lumber company. They first lived in Pointe-Saint-Charles, a rail district, before moving to the more prosperous suburb of Westmount in 1895. While in Montreal the two older Patrick brothers were first introduced to ice hockey. They also met Art Ross at this time, who became a close friend of both brothers and had an extensive career in hockey. Patrick developed into a strong hockey player and would frequently be invited as a ringer to play in important games.

In 1901 Patrick enrolled in McGill University. He played basketball in his first semester as a student, and subsequently joined the hockey team. He was also invited to tryout for the Montreal Shamrocks, a top senior team in the city; however as this would have meant leaving the university, Patrick declined the offer, following the advice of his father. Even so Patrick only studied at McGill for one year before he withdrew. He was more focused on playing sports than studying, and so Joe decided to have Patrick start working for the family business. After initially working in an office role, within a year Patrick was promoted to a branch manager. The company was downsized though and so in June 1903 Patrick decided to move to Calgary in Western Canada in an effort to work on cattle ranches. Upon arriving in Calgary he found the lifestyle was not suitable for him, and instead joined the Canadian Pacific Railway as a rodman and chainman on a survey gang, working until the autumn of that year.

On his way back to Montreal, Patrick stopped in Brandon, Manitoba. He had friends there playing hockey, and was offered spot with the team for $25 per month to cover expenses. He played as cover-point for the season. While points and cover-points were not expected to contribute much to offensive actions, Patrick tried to carry the puck up the ice during a game, scoring a goal. While the club questioned his motive, he argued that it was successful, and the fans enjoyed it, so was allowed to keep doing so. He also advocated for the two defenders to line up side-by-side, rather than one in front of the other as had been the standard since the beginning of hockey; this change was adopted by the team and soon widely adopted in hockey. Brandon challenged the Ottawa Senators for the Stanley Cup in that season, but were defeated in the two-game, total-goal series. After the season Patrick returned to Montreal, arriving by March 1904.
Patrick played the 1904–05 season with Montreal Westmount in the Canadian Amateur Hockey League (CAHL), then the top level league in Canadian hockey. In eight games Patrick had four goals. While back from school during a break in 1905, Frank briefly joined the Montreal Westmount club and played two games; this marked the first time the brothers played together. Preoccupied with work commitments for his father, Patrick frequently missed team workouts and the team did not perform very well. The CAHL was disbanded prior to the start of the 1905–06 season and replaced by a new league, the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association (ECAHA). Patrick joined the Montreal Wanderers, who were admitted to the new league, scoring 17 goals in nine games for them. The Wanderers finished in a tie with Ottawa for first in the league, leading to a two game, total goal playoff was played for the league championship. The Wanders won the series 12 goals to 10, with Patrick scoring the final two goals in the last minutes of the second game, and were thus also awarded the Stanley Cup. The following season the Wanderers again finished first in the ECAHA, though lost the Cup in a challenge against the Kenora Thistles, champions of the Manitoba Hockey Association, in January 1907. In a rematch series in March 1907 the Wanderers defeated Kenora to again win the Cup. Patrick had scored 11 goals in nine regular season games, and a further 10 goals in six Cup challenge games.

In 1907 Joe purchased a tract of land in the Slocan Valley in southeastern British Columbia (BC), and moved the family west to Nelson, British Columbia, a town near the land, to start a new lumber company there. Frank remained in Montreal to complete his studies, as he had one year remaining. In Nelson Patrick played for a local hockey team, scoring 22 goals in 6 games during the 1908–09 season.

During the season Patrick also accepted an offer to join the Edmonton Hockey Club of the Alberta Amateur Hockey Association for their upcoming Cup challenge against his former team, the Wanderers. The team had signed several high-profile players from Eastern Canada to play for the team in the challenge; only two players on the team were from Edmonton, with the rest coming from the east. Patrick and Tommy Phillips, who had played for Kenora, never even reached Edmonton; they met their team in Winnipeg on its way east for the Cup challenge. Edmonton lost the two game, total-goal series 14–9, with Patrick scoring one goal. While other players were paid several hundred dollars for the series, Patrick was given $100 for expenses. In a story he told years later, Patrick noted that after informing his father he only spent $62, he was ordered to reimburse the Edmonton club the remaining $38; Patrick would claim this &quot;must have been the first and last time in history that a hockey player ever returned any part of his expense money.&quot;
The following year a new top-level league, the National Hockey Association (NHA), was established; unlike the ECHA, the NHA was openly professional. Several teams began to send offers to both Patrick brothers, who had decided to return east for the winter and play hockey there. Among the teams making offers were the Renfrew Creamery Kings, owned by J. Ambrose O&#x27;Brien, a wealthy mining magnate, and when Patrick received the offer he replied saying he would join the team for $3,000, an exorbitant salary for the era. Surprised by the offer, Patrick asked for his brother Frank as well, and Frank was offered $2,000 to join the team.

Along with other high-profile players, most famously Cyclone Taylor, who signed for a reported $5,250, the team was nicknamed the &quot;Millionaires&quot;. Along with several teammates, the Patricks lived in a boarding house in Renfrew during the season, and players were often seen together about town. Patrick was the more out-spoken of the brothers, with Frank being quiet and reserved, though his demeanor changed when the topic of hockey came up. He became quite lively and was open about his ideas on how to improve the game, and what type of tactics could be used. Taylor would later recall he was quite impressed by the brothers knowledge and views, stating that &quot;Frank in particular had an amazing grasp of the science of hockey, and they were both already dreaming about changes that would improve the game&quot;.

==Pacific Coast Hockey Association==
Joe sold his lumber company in January 1911, making a profit of around $440,000, of which he gave both Lester and Frank $25,000. In a separate transaction Joe also sold a private interest he had, earning a further $35,000. With this money Joe solicited ideas from his family on what to invest in, and Frank suggested they establish their own hockey league, one based in BC and that they controlled. It was put to a vote, with both Joe and Frank voting in favour and Lester against, so they agreed to move forward, and the family moved to Victoria, British Columbia. They incorporated the new league, the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA), on December 7, 1911.

The initial plan was to place teams in large cities in Western Canada, with one each in Vancouver and Victoria (both in BC), and one in Edmonton and Calgary (both in Alberta). Issues in finding support for the Alberta-based teams meant that the new league would only be based in BC initially. The mild weather on the West Coast meant that unlike Central and Eastern Canada natural ice could not be used for games, and so the Patrick family built two arenas: the Denman Arena in Vancouver and the Patrick Arena in Victoria. While the arenas were being built Patrick went east to recruit players, offering up to twice the salary they were making in the NHA to join the new league, and was able to recruit several high-profile names. Patrick managed and played for the Victoria team, while Frank would do the same for the Vancouver team. Patrick played all 16 games for the team in the inaugural 1912 season, finishing tied for third on the team in scoring with 10 goals. At a height of and weight of Patrick was larger than many other hockey players of the era, and historian Alan Livingstone MacLeod notes that in team photos Patrick was &quot;at least half a head taller than the other players&quot;.

Buoyed by an influx of players from the east (16 of the 23 players in the PCHA&#x27;s first season had played in the NHA previously), the league did well and demonstrated early it could be a serious challenger to the supremacy of the NHA.
Prior to the start of the 1913–14 Patrick broke a bone in his left arm, keeping him from playing until mid-way through the season, though he continued to serve as coach. Victoria started the season badly, but with Patrick returning they finished strong and won the league championship, with 10 wins in 16 games. Patrick played eight of the games, and had ten points. With a new agreement reached between the PCHA and NA, Victoria played the NHA champions, the Toronto Blueshirts, for the Cup. The teams played a best-of-five series, which Toronto won 3 games to 0. Patrick played all three games and had two goals.

In January 1916 the Victoria Arena was commandeered by the Canadian military for use as a training facility for new recruits. Prior to the 1916–17 Patrick moved his team from Victoria to Spokane, Washington, where they were renamed the Spokane Canaries. The reason for the move is not clear, though MacLeod speculates that Patrick thought the military may allow the team to continue to use it, which was not to be the case. After that season the Canaries were disbanded, and Patrick joined the Stanley Cup champion Seattle Metropolitans.

The Aristocrats were revived in 1918 as the Victoria Cougars, and Patrick took over as player-manager. Despite playing in only about half the games, he retired as a player after the 1922 season. Remaining with the Cougars as head coach, Patrick became the last non-NHL coach to win the Stanley Cup in 1925.

In January 1926 Patrick returned to the ice for the Cougars in an effort to help the team, which was playing poorly.

==New York Rangers==

By the early 1920s the PCHA was losing money. Seattle folded in 1924, and with only two teams left (Vancouver and Victoria), the Patricks decided to merge with the Western Canada Hockey League, which was renamed the Western Hockey League (WHL). The WHL continued for two seasons until 1926, though with continued financial difficulties and expansion plans by the NHL (which would add three teams between 1924 and 1926, growing to ten teams overall) it was clear the league would not be sustainable. With the consent of five of the six WHL teams Frank met with the NHL and offered to sell the rights to WHL players to the league for a lump sum, allowing the NHL to quickly stock the expansion teams being set up. This was agreed to, and for $100,000 the Victoria team was transferred to Detroit, (who named themselves the Detroit Cougars in recognition). The Chicago team, later named the Black Hawks, also paid $100,000 for players, receiving the Portland Rosebuds. The Boston Bruins, whose owner Charles Adams and manager Art Ross had helped facilitate the sale, also purchased select players, paying a total of $17,000, netting the WHL owners a total of $267,000.

In October 1926 Patrick was offered the position of coach with the New York Rangers, another expansion team in the NHL. Shortly after he was also named the team&#x27;s general manager, replacing Conn Smythe. He played one regular season game for the Rangers, on March 20, 1927, serving as a substitute defenceman against the New York Americans.

He is famous for an incident which occurred on April 7, 1928, during Game 2 of the 1928 Stanley Cup Finals against the Montreal Maroons. After starting goaltender Lorne Chabot suffered an eye injury when he was hit by the puck in the middle of the second period, Patrick inserted himself into the game as the Rangers&#x27; new netminder, telling the players &quot;Boys, don&#x27;t let an old man down.&quot; At the age of 44 years, 99 days, Patrick remains the oldest man to have played in the Stanley Cup Finals. At the time it was not common for teams to have a backup goaltender, and the opposing team&#x27;s coach had to allow a substitute goaltender. However, Maroons manager-coach Eddie Gerard refused to give permission for the Rangers to use Alec Connell, the Ottawa Senators&#x27; netminder who was in the stands, as well as minor-leaguer Hugh McCormick. Odie Cleghorn, the coach of the Pittsburgh Pirates, stood in for Patrick as coach for the remainder of the game, and directed the Rangers to check fiercely at mid-ice which limited the Maroon players to long harmless shots. Patrick saved 18 to 19 shots while allowing one goal in helping the Rangers to an overtime victory. For the next three games, the league gave permission for the Rangers to use Joe Miller from the New York Americans in goal. The Rangers went on to win the Stanley Cup, their first in franchise history.

The Rangers played in the Stanley Cup Finals in 1929, and again in 1932, though lost both years. They won a second Stanley Cup championship in 1933, defeating the Toronto Maple Leafs. Patrick coached the team to the Finals once more in 1937, though they lost. He resigned as coach in 1939 and was replaced by Frank Boucher, remaining as general manager of the Rangers and serving as an assistant coach to Boucher.

Patrick won the Cup for the final time in 1940 when the Rangers, coached by Boucher, defeated Toronto. However the onset of the Second World War in 1939 had depleted the Rangers, who saw many players enlist in the armed forces of both Canada and the United States. This led to tension between Patrick and Boucher, and with the team continuing to lose Patrick resigned as general manager on February 22, 1946, replaced by Boucher, who took on the dual role of coach and general manager. He stayed on as vice president of Madison Square Garden, finally retiring in 1950. Patrick had also briefly assumed an executive position in the NHL in early 1943: league president Frank Calder collapsed at a board meeting in January, and until his replacement Red Dutton was able to assume the role in May, Patrick and E.W. Bickle of Toronto oversaw the league.

==Later life and legacy==

Patrick developed lung cancer, and his health quickly deteriorated. He died in Victoria after a heart attack on June 1, 1960, aged 76. Exactly four weeks later, he was followed by his brother Frank, who was 74; Frank&#x27;s death was also attributed to a heart attack.

The Lester Patrick Trophy, awarded for outstanding contributions to hockey in the United States, is named for him. He was also the namesake of the Patrick Division, one of the former divisions of the NHL teams. The championships trophy of the Western Hockey League, the Lester Patrick Cup, was renamed after Patrick upon his death in 1960. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1947.

As a coach Patrick described his philosophy to reporters: &quot;It is incumbent upon you initially to build up their morale and then maintain it, and before you do that you must have acquired their confidence in your judgement, and you must know the man.&quot; He was known to be patient with players, and while he would go onto the ice to show plays, he let the players work on it, aware that it took time for some to learn.

The Patrick brothers created many new rules for hockey, and at least 22 remain in the NHL rulebook to this day. They introduced the blue line, the forward pass, and the playoff system, a change adopted by other leagues and sports around the world. After a suggestion by their father Joe, they began using numbers on players&#x27; sweaters and in programs to help fans identify the skaters. A new rule allowed the puck to be kicked everywhere but into the net, and allowed goaltenders to fall to the ice to make a save. They were responsible for crediting assists when a goal was scored, and invented the penalty shot.

With the Rangers Patrick also became an early advocate of the farm team system, in which the parent team sponsored several minor and junior teams in order to retain their playing rights. This allowed teams like the Rangers, who did not have many local players, to acquire talent from other regions, and kept competing teams from signing all the players. The Rangers developed an extensive system in this way, including forming a new league, the Eastern Amateur Hockey League, which had teams in the New York region. In 1933 Patrick started hosting Rangers&#x27; training camps in Winnipeg, in a further effort to expand the search for talent beyond the provinces of Ontario and Quebec where the NHL&#x27;s two Canadian teams (the Toronto Maple Leafs and Montreal Canadiens) were located.

The Patricks have been dubbed &quot;Hockey&#x27;s Royal Family&quot;. Patrick&#x27;s son, Lynn and grandson Craig were both inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. Another son, Muzz, was a player and eventually coach and general manager of the Rangers. Another grandson, Glenn, played in the NHL during parts of the 1970s while another grandson, Dick (Muzz&#x27;s son) has been an executive and minority owner of the Washington Capitals since 1982. Great-grandson Chris, the son of Dick, was named general manager of the Capitals in 2024.

Patrick also played a role in the early development of women&#x27;s hockey. In Nelson his sisters Myrtle, Cynda and Dora were associated with the Nelson Ladies Hockey Club, and in 1911 Patrick would coach the team. In January 1916, the Patrick brothers talked of forming a women&#x27;s league to complement the PCHA and occupy dates for their arenas in Vancouver and Victoria. The proposal included teams from Vancouver, Victoria, Portland, and Seattle. The league never formed but in January 1917, the &quot;Vancouver News-Advertiser&quot; reported that wives of the Seattle Metropolitans had assembled a team. In February 1921, Frank announced a women&#x27;s international championship series that would be played in conjunction with the PCHA. A series of games were held over that month with teams from Seattle, Vancouver, and Victoria, playing during intermissions of PCHA games. Both Seattle and Victoria&#x27;s teams disbanded after the series, and the proposed women&#x27;s league was not further developed.

<text>Autofahrer-Rundfunk-Informationssystem (ARI, German for: Automotive-Driver&#x27;s-Broadcasting-Information) was a system for indicating the presence of traffic information in FM broadcasts used by the German ARD network of FM radio stations from 1974. Developed jointly by IRT and Blaupunkt, it indicated the presence of traffic announcements through manipulation of the 57kHz subcarrier of the station&#x27;s FM signal.

ARI was rendered obsolete by the more modern Radio Data System and the ARD stopped broadcasting ARI signals on March 1, 2005.

== Functionality description ==

=== SK signal ===

The SK signal is actually the 57 kHz subcarrier that is transmitted by the ARI-compliant FM station for this functionality. This frequency, like the RDS subcarrier frequency is chosen because it is the third harmonic of the 19 kHz pilot tone used in the FM-stereo transmission standard. An easy way to understand that is that this frequency is the 19 kHz pilot tone multiplied by 3.

An ARI-equipped radio would illuminate an indicator lamp to show that this function was in force. Most such radios would use this function further to help users search for ARI broadcasts. In the Radio Data System environment, the TP signal is equivalent to this basic function.

The basic method implemented on an analog receiver would be a switch usually marked SDK or VF. Radios that used the &quot;classic&quot; mechanical push-button preset system would have one of these buttons set aside as the VF switch. If this switch was on, the radio would mute unless it was tuned into a station that transmitted this signal.

If the radio was a digitally-tuned receiver, this switch usually engaged an &quot;ARI-seek&quot; mode which had the radio seek for any ARI station if it was out of range of the currently-tuned ARI station.

=== DK signal ===

This function, which is superseded by the RDS TA function, was tied in with the broadcasting studio and would be triggered whenever the traffic-announcement jingle was played. A 125 Hz tone would be modulated on the 57 kHz ARI subcarrier tone while this was happening.

A radio that used a &quot;DK&quot; switch, often part of the &quot;SDK&quot; or &quot;VF&quot; switch, was placed into &quot;traffic-priority&quot; mode. It would pick up on this signal and come out of a muted state or cut over a tape or CD that was playing and play the announcement at a fixed volume level.
There was the ability to switch off such announcements on these sets if the driver found a particular announcement irrelevant or it ran on for too long, but it was not easily explained to people new to the system. This was also confusing because a lot of cheaper implementations used a mechanical toggle switch to engage / disengage ARI mode and it was hard to simply use this switch simply to reset the system.

=== BK signal ===

This function was based on one of six tones that was in this same subcarrier and was reserved for high-end car radios. These were referred to as A, B, C, D, E and F; and they worked as a crude way of machine-based geocoding for Germany&#x27;s broadcast areas.
The set would indicate the current zone that it was in rather than using an &quot;SK&quot; indicator whenever it was on an ARI station. As well, the user could control ARI search behavior based on the current zone, a user-nominated zone such as the neighboring zone or any ARI station in any zone.

==Attempts to deploy ARI in the U.S.==

Blaupunkt even made attempts to roll it out into the US market since 1982 by gaining support from selected FM broadcasters in the big US cities, but it did not catch on. Besides, they were the only company to put ARI-equipped sets on the U.S. marketplace, as a way of differentiating their product from others. There was talk of encouraging other manufacturers to sell ARI-equipped car radios to the U.S., but there was no action even though other manufacturers would roll out ARI-equipped radios to Germany.

==Attempts to deploy ARI in Canada==
ARI was introduced in Toronto, Canada, around the same time as the U.S. CHFI was the station designated for such broadcasts, and ads for new Blaupunkt car stereos announced it, but just like in the U.S., ARI did not seem to catch on.

<doc id="350727" wikidata="Q2547867" url="?curid=350727" title="Wanda Tinasky">
<text>Wanda Tinasky, ostensibly a bag lady living under a bridge in the Mendocino County area of Northern California, was the pseudonymous author of a series of playful, comic, and erudite letters sent to the &quot;Mendocino Commentary&quot; and the &quot;Anderson Valley Advertiser&quot; between 1983 and 1988. These letters were later collected and published as &quot;The Letters of Wanda Tinasky&quot;. In them, Tinasky weighs in on a variety of topics—most notably local artists, writers, poets, and politicians—with an irreverent wit and literate polish. The harshness of the attacks was deemed excessive by the &quot;Commentary&quot; early on, and, as a result, most of the remaining letters appeared in the &quot;AVA&quot;. At the time, the identity of Tinasky was completely unknown, and was subject to much local speculation. Tinasky was thought by many to be novelist Thomas Pynchon until it was demonstrated that Tinasky was likely an obscure Beat Generation poet named Tom Hawkins.

== Thomas Pynchon ==

In 1990, Bruce Anderson, the editor of the &quot;AVA&quot;, read Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s &quot;Vineland&quot;, a novel set-in northern California. Pynchon&#x27;s style reminded Anderson of Tinasky, and Pynchon&#x27;s notorious secrecy fueled speculation that he had been in the area during the 1980s. It occurred to Anderson that perhaps Pynchon was Tinasky. Indeed, Tinasky had written that she was writing a novel based on the local scene in Mendocino County.

Similarities (for example, both Tinasky and Pynchon worked for Boeing) were easy to play up, and discrepancies (for example, Tinasky worked for Boeing ten years before Pynchon) just as easy to play down. This pattern of finding significant matches between Pynchon and Tinasky, while ignoring apparent contradictions, continued in the readings that followed.

Anderson ran his speculations past some Pynchon fans, and received enough encouragement to report in the &quot;AVA&quot; that Pynchon was Tinasky. This announcement attracted little outside interest.

== &quot;The Letters of Wanda Tinasky&quot; ==

* In 1994, Fred Gardner started a &quot;Best of &quot;AVA&quot;&quot; project, came upon the Tinasky letters, and learned from Anderson the latter&#x27;s belief that Pynchon wrote them. Gardner switched to working exclusively on a Tinasky letters project. Receiving a tip that TR Factor (the former Diane Kearney, who appeared in the &quot;AVA&quot; as &quot;C. O. Jones&quot;) might actually be Tinasky, Gardner contacted Factor, and hired her as his assistant.
* In 1995, Gardner sent a letter to Pynchon&#x27;s agent, Melanie Jackson (by then Pynchon&#x27;s wife), in regard to the forthcoming publication of the Tinasky letters. Jackson wrote back that Pynchon did not write the letters, and that his name should not be associated with the project. The suggestion was made that Anderson was merely drumming up publicity for himself and the &quot;AVA&quot;. Gardner did not have as much zeal as Factor after this and quit the project.
* In 1996, Factor self-published &quot;The Letters of Wanda Tinasky&quot; with an introduction by literary critic Steven Moore guardedly supporting the identification of Pynchon with Tinasky, though, under legal duress, the book fell short of making an overt claim of authorship and did not put Pynchon&#x27;s name on the cover. The Pynchon community remained largely undecided, and strong opinions formed on both sides, but the issue was mostly ignored. &quot;Pynchon Notes&quot;, an academic journal, did not review &quot;Tinasky&quot;.

== Don Foster ==

The situation changed in 1998 when Shakespeare scholar and &quot;literary detective&quot; Don Foster—who had gained publicity by correctly identifying Joe Klein as the author of &quot;Primary Colors—&quot;named an obscure Beat poet and writer, Tom Hawkins, as the author of the letters.

Foster&#x27;s previous work was based on direct comparisons between unidentified and identified texts, looking for patterns in vocabulary, usage, and orthography. Foster&#x27;s techniques have aroused some controversy, and his results have been mixed.

The Tinasky identification involved more direct detective work, with the crucial step involving computer searches for works written about writers mentioned in the Tinasky letters. Hawkins&#x27;s name turned up, and Foster then tracked down more information about and writings by Hawkins. Eventually, many minor biographical details appeared, which exactly matched the letters: segments of Hawkins&#x27;s poetry had been reused in the letters, and ultimately the very typewriter Hawkins used was found. Unlike the case with Pynchon, where there were both similarities and discrepancies throughout, the identified mismatches between Hawkins and Tinasky were limited to the Tinasky façade, and a small number of &quot;transparent forgeries&quot;, as Foster calls them, that had been culled ahead of time.

In 2000, Foster published a popular account in his book &quot;Author Unknown&quot;. It has largely ended academic speculation on Tinasky&#x27;s identity. Furthermore, several months after Foster&#x27;s book came out, the Wanda Tinasky Letters page went blank without explanation, and the &quot;Letters&quot; soon went out of print.

== Tom Hawkins ==

Thomas Donald Hawkins (January 11, 1927 – September 23, 1988) was born in Pangurn, Arkansas. He grew up in Port Angeles, Washington, and graduated in 1950 from the University of Washington with a degree in English. He married Kathleen Marie Gallaner and worked for Boeing in the early fifties, then in Beaumont, Texas, in television, for station KFDM, and advertising. In 1960 he moved to San Francisco to join the Beats, supporting himself as a postal worker. After his work was rejected by local Beat publications, he took to self-publishing under the name &quot;Tiger Tim&quot; Hawkins. As a fan of William Gaddis, Hawkins discovered &quot;newspaper&quot;, the self-published Gaddis fansheet of &quot;jack green&quot;. He became convinced that green was Gaddis, a detail that would show up in the Tinasky letters. Tinasky also claimed that &quot;the novels of William Gaddis and Thomas Pynchon were written by the same person.&quot;

After Hawkins retired, he and Kathleen moved to Mendocino County just outside Fort Bragg, where they lived in poverty for most of the eighties. Hawkins engaged in petty scams and thefts and took to disguising himself. Kathleen came into an inheritance and bought a car for herself and a pickup truck for her husband. She also bought a kiln and began a promising career in pottery.

Three weeks after the last (according to Foster) authentic Tinasky letter, Hawkins bludgeoned Kathleen to death, and kept her body inside their house, unburied. After several days, he set fire to their house and drove her car off a cliff into rocky shoals, killing himself.

At the time, no one connected the end of Tinasky with the Hawkinses&#x27; murder–suicide. Indeed, this event didn&#x27;t altogether stem the flow of Tinasky&#x27;s invective: at least one &quot;copycat&quot; letter, by Foster&#x27;s account, had been published while Hawkins was alive, and these continued to trickle out for a short time after his death.

<doc id="350732" wikidata="Q572924" url="?curid=350732" title="Anthony Braxton">
<text>Anthony Braxton (born June 4, 1945) is an American experimental composer, educator, music theorist, improviser and multi-instrumentalist who is best known for playing saxophones, particularly the alto. Braxton grew up on the South Side of Chicago, Illinois, and was a key early member of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians. He received great acclaim for his 1969 double-LP record &quot;For Alto&quot;, the first full-length album of solo saxophone music.

A prolific composer with a vast body of cross-genre work, the MacArthur Fellow and NEA Jazz Master has released hundreds of recordings and compositions. During six years signed to Arista Records, the diversity of his output encompassed work with many members of the AACM, including duets with co-founder and first president Muhal Richard Abrams; collaborations with electronic musician Richard Teitelbaum; a saxophone quartet with Julius Hemphill, Oliver Lake and Hamiet Bluiett; compositions for four orchestras; and the ensemble arrangements of &quot;Creative Orchestra Music 1976&quot;, which was named the 1977 &quot;DownBeat&quot; Critics&#x27; Poll Album of the Year. Many of his projects are ongoing, such as the &quot;Diamond Curtain Wall&quot; works, in which Braxton implements audio programming language SuperCollider; the &quot;Ghost Trance Music&quot; series, inspired by his studies of the Native American Ghost Dance; and &quot;Echo Echo Mirror House Music&quot;, in which musicians &quot;play&quot; iPods containing the bulk of Braxton&#x27;s oeuvre. He has released the first six operas in a series called the &quot;Trillium&quot; Opera Complex.

Braxton identifies as a &quot;trans-idiomatic&quot; composer and has repeatedly opposed the idea of a rigid dichotomy between improvisation and composition. He has written extensively about the &quot;language music&quot; system that forms the basis for his work and developed a philosophy of &quot;world creativity&quot; in his &quot;Tri-Axium Writings&quot;.

Braxton taught at Mills College from 1985 to 1990 and was Professor of Music at Wesleyan University from 1990 until his retirement at the end of 2013. He is the artistic director of the Tri-Centric Foundation, a nonprofit he founded in 1994 to support the preservation and production of works by Braxton and other artists &quot;in pursuit of &#x27;trans-idiomatic&#x27; creativity&quot;.

==Early life==
Braxton was born in Chicago, Illinois, to Julia Samuels Braxton, from Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Clarence Dunbar Braxton Sr., from Greenville, Mississippi; Braxton&#x27;s father worked for the Burlington and Quincy Railroad. His parents divorced when he was young, and his mother remarried Lawrence Fouche, a worker at the Ford Motor Company. Braxton grew up living with his mother, stepfather, and three brothers, but still saw his father regularly. He grew up in a poorer district on the South Side, where he attended Betsy Ross Grammar School and had a paper route delivering &quot;The Chicago Defender&quot;. He sang in a church choir and had an early love of rock music, with Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers and Bill Haley &amp; His Comets among his favorites, but as a child was more excited by rocketships, television, and technology.

As was the case after World War I, post-WWII Chicago faced increased rates of white mob violence against Black people, and Braxton heard about incidents such as the Cicero race riot of 1951, protests at the White City Roller Rink near his home, and the lynching of Chicagoan Emmett Till, who was killed when Braxton was 10.

==Education and military service==

In his early teens, Braxton took his at-home explorations of technology and electronics to Chicago Vocational High School, where drafting courses and time in shop studying wiring schematics set the course for his future compositional diagrams.

After high school Braxton attended Wilson Junior College for one semester, but was unable to continue his studies due to financial difficulties; he instead applied and was admitted to the United States Fifth Army Band in 1963. He was initially stationed in Highland Park, Illinois, where he could continue studies with Jack Gell at the Chicago School of Music, but he later traveled to South Korea with The Eighth Army Band. While in South Korea he met a number of improvising musicians and even led his own group, though many in the barracks did not appreciate the more esoteric works in his collection, and he purchased headphones due to rules restricting his listening time.

After a few years Braxton left the army and moved back to Chicago; he later studied philosophy and music composition at Roosevelt University, though he did not complete his degree.

== Career ==
Shortly after returning to Chicago, Braxton&#x27;s cousin told him about the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians and he attended a concert. Following the performance he met Roscoe Mitchell, who invited him to come practice with, and later join, the group.

Braxton played over ten instruments on his 1968 debut, &quot;3 Compositions of New Jazz&quot;, the influences for which he identified as Paul Desmond, Ornette Coleman, Eric Dolphy, Jackie McLean, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Miles Davis, James Brown, and the Chicago Transit Authority. The album&#x27;s trio arrangement included Leroy Jenkins and Wadada Leo Smith, with Muhal Richard Abrams joining on the B-side recordings.

In 1969, Braxton recorded the double LP &quot;For Alto&quot;. There had previously been occasional unaccompanied saxophone recordings (notably Coleman Hawkins&#x27; &quot;Picasso&quot;), but &quot;For Alto&quot; was the first full-length album for unaccompanied saxophone. The work has been described as &quot;one of the greatest solo saxophone records ever made, and maybe one of the greatest recordings ever issued&quot; and &quot;an album of solo free improvisation that still remains a paragon of technical, aesthetic and emotional excellence&quot;. The album influenced other artists like Steve Lacy, Joe McPhee, and Evan Parker, who went on to record their own solo albums. Tracks on &quot;For Alto&quot; were dedicated to Cecil Taylor and John Cage, among others.

Braxton was initially pessimistic about making a living as a working musician and began hustling chess, but in 1970 he joined pianist Chick Corea&#x27;s trio with Dave Holland (double bass) and Barry Altschul (drums) to form the short-lived avant garde quartet Circle. After Corea left to form the fusion band Return to Forever, Holland and Altschul remained with Braxton for much of the 1970s as part of a quartet that variously included Kenny Wheeler, George E. Lewis, and Ray Anderson. The core trio plus saxophonist Sam Rivers recorded Holland&#x27;s &quot;Conference of the Birds&quot;. In 1970, Muse released his album &quot;Creative Construction Company&quot;, with the group of the same name, consisting of Richard Davis (bass), Steve McCall (drums), Muhal Richard Abrams (piano, cello), Wadada Leo Smith (trumpet), and Leroy Jenkins (violin)--this album was released in the late 1970s by the Italian label, Vedette, under the title, &quot;Muhal&quot;. &quot;Creative Orchestra Music 1976&quot; was inspired by jazz and marching band traditions. Braxton also recorded duets with George Lewis and Richard Teitelbaum in the 1970s.

Braxton&#x27;s regular group in the 1980s and early 1990s was a quartet with Marilyn Crispell (piano), Mark Dresser (double bass) and Gerry Hemingway (drums). In 1981, he performed at the Woodstock Jazz Festival to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the Creative Music Studio.

In 1994, Braxton was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship.

During the 1990s and early 2000s, Braxton created a large body of jazz standard recordings, often featuring him as a pianist rather than saxophonist. He released multidisc sets, including three quadruple-CD sets for Leo that were recorded on tour in 2003. He worked with several groups, including a quintet crediting bassist Mario Pavone as co-leader with Thomas Chapin on saxophone, Dave Douglas on trumpet, and Pheeroan akLaff on drums. From 1995 to 2006, he concentrated what he called &quot;Ghost Trance Music&quot;, which introduced a pulse to his music and allowed the simultaneous performance of any piece by the performers; many of the earliest &quot;Ghost Trance&quot; recordings were released on his Braxton House label.

His &quot;Falling River Musics&quot; compositions were documented on &quot;2+2 Compositions&quot; (482 Music, 2005). In 2005, he was a guest performer with the noise group Wolf Eyes at the FIMAV Festival. &quot;Black Vomit&quot;, a recording of the concert, was described by critic François Couture as sympathetic and effective collaboration: &quot;something really clicked between these artists, and it was all in good fun.&quot;

Braxton is known for a sprawling and extremely diverse discography which has continued to grow in his later career: in introducing his 13-CD box set &quot;Quartet (Standards) 2020&quot;, Bandcamp Daily wrote, &quot;Anthony Braxton&#x27;s discography has been massive for decades. [...] Since 2012, he&#x27;s released two 4-CD operas; a 12-CD set of duos with various partners; a 7-CD set of the music of Lennie Tristano and associated artists; an 11-CD set of Charlie Parker&#x27;s music; a 12-CD set of vocal music; an 8-CD set of duos with Eugene Chadbourne; a 4-CD set of collaborations with Nels Cline, Greg Saunier, and Taylor Ho Bynum; and an audio Blu-Ray of 12 compositions for sextet, septet, and nonet, totaling over 11 hours of music. And that&#x27;s probably not all of it.&quot;

== Compositional style and systems ==
Braxton has written several volumes to explain his theories and works, such as the three-volume &quot;Tri-Axium Writings&quot; and the five-volume &quot;Composition Notes&quot;, both published by Frog Peak Music.

===Titles===

Braxton often titles his compositions with diagrams or numbers and letters. Some diagrams have a clear meaning or signification, as on &quot;For Trio&quot;, where the title indicates the physical positions of the performers. Some letters are identifiable as the initials of Braxton&#x27;s friends and musical colleagues, but many titles remain inscrutable to critics. By the mid-to-late 1980s, Braxton&#x27;s titles began to incorporate drawings and illustrations. He also began to include lifelike images of inanimate objects such as train cars, which were most notably seen after the advent of his Ghost Trance Music system. Braxton settled on a system of opus-numbers to make referring to these pieces simpler, and earlier pieces have had opus-numbers retroactively added to them.

=== Language Music ===
Language Music was Braxton&#x27;s original composition system, first used as an approach to solo improvisation. By limiting the music to a single parameter (for example, trills), Braxton was able to explore beyond the surface particulars of a given parameter. These language &quot;types&quot;, which serve as the vocabulary of his Language Music, are often signaled by hand cues.

He has said that &quot;language music is the basis of my work&quot; and that it also serves as the basis for his other compositional systems. Braxton emphasizes working with &quot;notation as practiced in black improvised creativity&quot;, where it functions &quot;as both a recall-factor as well as a generating factor&quot;. Accordingly, the language types function as both parameters and prompts in ensemble settings, where they may be used to structure improvisation or signal other performers.

While he has catalogued over 100 sound &quot;classifications&quot; or &quot;relationships&quot;, Braxton uses twelve types in most of his work.

=== Collage forms ===
Braxton&#x27;s various quartets in the late 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s were laboratories for his experiments in collage forms, or what he refers to as a constructor set approach to composition, giving musicians different compositions to be performed simultaneously. This collage strategy became an integral feature of Braxton&#x27;s approach to composition and band-leading.

One important part of these collage structures was the pulse-track structures. These pulse tracks were graphic notation given to the rhythm section that allowed them to break free from traditional rhythm section approaches but still play a supportive role behind the other instruments.

=== Ghost Trance Music ===

The &quot;Ghost Trance Music&quot; compositional series comprises approximately 150 pieces written from 1995 to 2006. Inspired by 19th century Native American Ghost Dances, the &quot;GTM&quot; works are written to provide a &quot;gateway to ritual space&quot; with elements &quot;designed to function as pathways between Braxton&#x27;s various musical systems&quot;.

The central thread in a &quot;GTM&quot; composition is a ceaseless &quot;primary melody&quot;, which Braxton describes as &quot;a melody that never ends&quot;. This line of music, which may extend for 80 pages or more, is written to be played in unison by any performer who wishes to participate in the &quot;ritual circle dance&quot;. Musicians are also able to move in and out of the primary melody, with notes marked by a shape—a circle, triangle, or square—signaling opportunities to move to a different composition, or mode of composing, in the system. A circle indicates that a performer can engage in an open or a &quot;language music&quot; improvisation; if the latter, performers may also give visual cues prompting others to follow the logics of a specific Braxtonian &quot;language type&quot;. Triangles and squares are both invitations to play other notated compositions (or &quot;stable identities&quot;). Triangles represent specific &quot;secondary material&quot; included with each &quot;GTM&quot; score, whereas squares signify pre-selected &quot;outside&quot; materials; these tertiary works, chosen prior to a given performance, may include &quot;any&quot; compositions in Braxton&#x27;s oeuvre (including other &quot;Ghost Trance Music&quot; works).

Braxton&#x27;s notational devices also ensure variation within the primary melody itself, often by the orders they refuse to give: for example, a traditional clef assigns a note to a specific line, but the diamond-shaped &quot;open clef&quot; of a &quot;GTM&quot; composition allows performers to choose any clef or transposition. Micro-level interventions include &quot;open accidentals&quot; which may be interpreted as either a sharp or a flat.

The &quot;Ghost Trance Music&quot; works went through four phases over the eleven years of their composition, with each phase considered a different &quot;species&quot; of &quot;GTM&quot;. Changes across species include increasing range and variation of elements such as rhythm, dynamics, and articulation. The escalation in complexity and intensity culminated in &quot;Fourth Species GTM&quot;, also called &quot;Accelerator Class Ghost Trance Music&quot;; these works have been described by a performer as &quot;a labyrinth of hyper-notated activities&quot;, featuring irregular polyrhythms, dynamic extremes, color-coding to denote additional variables––and no geometric invitations to depart.

=== Falling River Musics ===
In his &quot;Falling River Music&quot;, Braxton began to work on &quot;image logics&quot;, resulting in graphic scores with large paintings and drawings with smaller legends of various symbols. Performers must find their own meanings in the symbols and construct a path through the score, balancing &quot;the demands of traditional notation interpretation and esoteric inter-targeting.&quot;

=== Graphic scores ===
The scoring techniques used in 76 are reminiscent of a number of graphic works by other experimental composers. In a lecture about Composition 76, Braxton &quot;cite[d] as inspirations&quot; Karlheinz Stockhausen&#x27;s Zyklus (1959), for a soloist playing thirteen percussion instruments, as well as the five pieces in John Cage&#x27;s Imaginary Landscape series (1939– 1952), some of which employ unconventional percussion akin to the AACM&#x27;s little instruments. All of these pieces are aleatoric— in other words, the performers have to improvise (although Stockhausen and Cage would instead use terms like &quot;intuitive music&quot; and &quot;indeterminacy&quot;). Composition 76 also recalls other improvisatory Stockhausen works for winds, percussion, and voice, including Aus den sieben Tagen (1968) and Sternklang (1971). However, few of the musicians in Stockhausen&#x27;s orbit could have played the dozens of instruments that Braxton wanted to feature in Composition 76. Fortunately, Braxton could turn to another community of musicians, one much closer to home.

==Personal life==
Braxton&#x27;s son Tyondai Braxton is also a musician, and the former guitarist, keyboardist and vocalist with American math rock band Battles.

==Discography==
== Awards ==
Braxton&#x27;s awards include a 1981 Guggenheim Fellowship, a 1994 MacArthur Fellowship, a 2013 Doris Duke Performing Artist Award, a 2014 NEA Jazz Master Award, and a 2020 United States Artists Fellowship.

In 2009, he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Liège in Belgium; fellow honorees included Archie Shepp, Frederic Rzewski, Robert Wyatt, and Arvo Pärt. In 2016, he was awarded an honorary doctorate in music from the New England Conservatory in the United States.

<text>Lythraceae is a family of flowering plants, including 32 genera, with about 620 species of herbs, shrubs, and trees. The larger genera include &quot;Cuphea&quot; (275 spp.), &quot;Lagerstroemia&quot; (56), &quot;Nesaea&quot; (50), &quot;Rotala&quot; (45), and &quot;Lythrum&quot; (35). It also includes the members of the former families of the pomegranate (&quot;Punica granatum&quot;, formerly in Punicaceae) and of the water caltrop (&quot;Trapa natans&quot;, formerly in Trapaceae). Lythraceae has a worldwide distribution, with most species in the tropics, but ranging into temperate climate regions as well.

The family is named after the type genus, &quot;Lythrum&quot;, the loosestrifes (e.g. &quot;Lythrum salicaria&quot; purple loosestrife) and also includes henna (&quot;Lawsonia inermis&quot;). It now includes the pomegranate, formerly classed in a separate family Punicaceae. The family also includes the widely cultivated crape myrtle trees. Botanically, the leaves are usually in pairs (opposite), and the flower petals emerge from the rim of the calyx tube. The petals often appear crumpled.

==Characteristics==
Lythraceae species are most often herbs, and less often shrubs or trees; the shrubs and trees often have flaky bark. Traits shared by species within the Lythraceae that distinguish them from belonging to other plant families are the petals being crumpled in the bud and the many-layered outer integument of the seed.

===Leaves===
The leaves generally have an opposite arrangement, but sometimes are whorled or alternate. They are simple with smooth margins and pinnate venation. Stipules are typically reduced, appearing as a row of minute hairs, or absent.

===Flowers===
The flowers are bisexual, radially or occasionally bilaterally symmetric, with a well-developed hypanthium. The flowers are most commonly quadimerous but can be heximerous, with four to eight sepals and petals. The sepals may be distinct, partially fused to form a tube, or touching without overlapping. The petals are crumpled in the bud and wrinkled at maturity, and are typically distinct and overlapping; they are occasionally absent. Usually, twice as many stamens as petals are seen, arranged in two whorls, and the stamens are often unequal in length. Occasionally, the stamens are reduced to one whorl, or are more numerous with multiple whorls. The ovary is typically superior, infrequently semi-inferior, or rarely inferior. The two to many carpels can be fused together (syncarpous), with two to numerous ovules in each locule, with axile placentation of the ovules.

Heterostyly – the presence of two (distylous) or three (tristylous) distinct flower morphs within a species differing in the lengths of the pistil and stamens – is common within the Lythraceae.

===Fruits and seeds===
The fruit is usually a dry, dehiscent capsule, occasionally a berry. The seeds are usually flattened and/or winged, with a multilayered outer integument. Epidermal hairs that expand and become mucilaginous when wet are found in about half the genera.

==Distribution==
The Lythraceae are widely distributed, but with most species tropical and some temperate. They are absent from the Sahara and most arid regions of Australia. Many species occur in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats (&quot;Decodon&quot;, &quot;Didiplis&quot;, &quot;Rotala&quot;, &quot;Sonneratia&quot;, &quot;Trapa&quot;). The oldest fossils of the family are pollen from the Late Cretaceous (Campanian) of Wyoming in western North America, around 82 to 81&quot; &quot;million years old.

==Economic importance==

Edible crops include the pomegranate (&quot;Punica granatum&quot;) and the water caltrop (&quot;Trapa bicornis&quot; or &quot;T. natans&quot;). The pomegranate is cultivated for the fleshy arils surrounding the seeds, and the water caltrop for its seeds. Henna (&quot;Lawsonia inermis&quot;) is cultivated for the dye of the same name, derived from its leaves.

Ornamentals are grown from a number of genera, including &quot;Cuphea&quot;, &quot;Lagerstroemia&quot; (crape myrtles), and &quot;Lythrum&quot; (loosestrifes).

Purple loosestrife (&quot;Lythrum salicaria&quot;) is an invasive exotic weed of wetlands throughout Canada and the United States.

==Taxonomy==
Within the order Myrtales, the family Lythraceae is most closely related to the Onagraceae, with the Combretaceae sister to both families. Molecular phylogeny work has led to the inclusion of the formerly recognized families Duabangaceae, Punicaceae, Sonneratiaceae, and Trapaceae.

===Genera===
Lythraceae consists of five subfamilies:

<text>Lagerstroemia (), commonly known as crape myrtle (also spelled crepe myrtle or crêpe myrtle), is a genus of around 50 species of deciduous and evergreen trees and shrubs native to the Indian subcontinent, southeast Asia, northern Australia, and other parts of Oceania, cultivated in warmer climates around the world. It is a member of the family Lythraceae, which is also known as the loosestrife family. These flowering trees are beautifully colored and are often planted both privately and commercially as ornamentals.

==Etymology==
The genus &quot;Lagerstroemia&quot; was first described by Carl Linnaeus. It is named after Swedish merchant , a director of the Swedish East India Company, who supplied Linnaeus with plants he collected.

==Description==

Crape myrtles are chiefly known for their colorful and long-lasting flowers, which occur in summer. Most species of &quot;Lagerstroemia&quot; have sinewy, fluted stems and branches with a mottled appearance that arises from having bark that sheds throughout the year. The leaves are opposite and simple, with entire margins, and vary from . While all species are woody in nature, they can range in height from over to under ; most, however, are small to medium, multiple-trunked trees and shrubs. The leaves of temperate species provide autumn color.

Flowers are borne in summer and autumn in panicles of crinkled flowers with a crêpe-like texture. Colors vary from deep purple to red to white, with almost every shade in between. Although no blue-flowered varieties exist, the flowers trend toward the blue end of the spectrum with no orange or yellow except in stamens and pistils. The fruit is a capsule, green and succulent at first, then ripening to dark brown or black dryness. It splits along six or seven lines, producing teeth much like those of the calyx, and releases numerous, small, winged seeds.

Hybrids
* &quot;Lagerstroemia indica × fauriei&quot; – a hybrid originating in the U.S. National Arboretum&#x27;s breeding programs of the mid-20th century
== Ecology ==
&quot;Lagerstroemia&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera (moth and butterfly) species, including &quot;Endoclita malabaricus&quot;.

The leaves of &quot;L. parviflora&quot; are fed on by the &quot;Antheraea paphia&quot; moth, which produces the tassar silk, a form of wild silk of commercial importance in India. 

Crape myrtles are susceptible to several pests and diseases, most notably, fungus-caused powdery mildew, and more recently, bark scale, caused by aphids leaving a black dark fungal infection in their wake.

== Uses ==
In their respective climates, both subtropical and tropical species are common in domestic and commercial landscapes. The timber of some species has been used to manufacture bridges, furniture, and railway sleepers, but in Vietnam&#x27;s Cát Tiên National Park, the dominant stands of &quot;Lagerstroemia calyculata&quot; in secondary forest are thought to have survived (after episodes of logging) due to the low quality of wood. 

=== Cultivation ===

Certain species of crape myrtle are used in landscaping and gardening as screens, lawn specimens, shrub borders, and container plants. Since crape myrtles are found in many places, opinions differ as to how to cultivate them in landscaping. Crape myrtles are best cultivated in warmer southern climates, U.S. zones 7–9, and prefer full sun. They occur in a variety of flowering colors and size. 

Crape myrtles might have been considered messy in the past, but their seedpods cannot stain concrete, so are best planted near swimming pools, decks, and sidewalks.

The common crape myrtle (&quot;L. indica&quot;) from China and Korea was introduced 1790 to Charleston, South Carolina, in the United States, by French botanist André Michaux. In the wild, the species is most often found as a multiple-stemmed, large shrub, but 200 years of cultivation have resulted in a huge number of cultivars of widely varying characteristics. Today, crape myrtle varieties can fulfill many landscaping needs, from tidy street trees to dense barrier hedges to fast-growing dwarf types of less than , which can go from seed to bloom in a season (allowing gardeners in places where the plant is not winter-hardy to still enjoy the intense colors of the frilly flowers). In Europe, crape myrtle is common in the south of France, the Iberian Peninsula, and most of Italy; in the United States, it is an iconic plant of gardens across the Southern United States. It has been cultivated in many parts of Australia, but is most common in the areas of the country with a Mediterranean climate such as the south-east and west.

While not as widely known, the Japanese crape myrtle, &quot;L. fauriei&quot;, from central and southern Japan, is becoming increasingly important, both as a landscaping plant and as a parent in complex hybrids with &quot;L. indica&quot;. This species is distinctly tree-like, with colorful, deciduous bark and dark green leaves, which are more resistant to fungal diseases than are those of its more popular relative. The Japanese name for this tree is , which refers to the smooth, slippery bark. Flowers are as large as those of &quot;L. indica&quot;, but are white with only the slightest pink flush appearing in some individuals. Japanese crape myrtle is hardier to cold than many strains of &quot;L. indica&quot;, a characteristic (along with fungal resistance, tree form, and colorful bark) that makes it valuable as genetic material for hybridization. Cultivars available include &#x27;Kiowa&#x27;, &#x27;Fantasy&#x27;, and &#x27;Townhouse&#x27;.

&quot;L. speciosa&quot;, known as queen crape myrtle, giant crape myrtle, or &quot;banabá&quot;, originates in subtropical and tropical India. It can be grown in any similar climate, but in the United States is suitable only for Florida, southernmost Texas, South Louisiana, coastal southern California, and Hawaii. It is a large evergreen tree with colorful rosy-mauve flowers and striking white bark, suitable for public parks and avenues; only the seed-grown species is commonly available for sale, unlike &quot;L. indica&quot; and &quot;L. fauriei&quot;, which have dozens of cultivars.

<doc id="350746" wikidata="Q1008836" url="?curid=350746" title="Rutland (town), Vermont">
<text>Rutland is a town in Rutland County, Vermont, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 3,924. Rutland Town completely surrounds Rutland City, which is a separate municipality. The villages of the town effectively comprise the inner suburbs of Rutland City.

==History==
The town was originally granted in 1761 by Governor Benning Wentworth as one of the New Hampshire Grants. He named it after John Manners, 3rd Duke of Rutland. It is also recorded that John Murray who was the first named proprietor and from Rutland named it.
It was one of the most successful of those grants because of the excellent farmland and gentle topography.
In the early 19th century, small high-quality marble deposits were discovered in Rutland, and in the 1830s a large deposit of nearly solid marble of high quality was found in what is now West Rutland. By the 1840s small firms had begun operations, but marble quarries only became profitable when the railroad came to Rutland in 1851. As fate would have it, the famous quarries of Carrara in Tuscany, Italy, became largely unworkable because of their extreme depth at the same time, and Rutland quickly became one of the leading producers of marble in the world. This fueled enough growth and investment that in 1886 the marble companies saw to it that the present Rutland City was incorporated as a village, and most of the town was split off as West Rutland and Proctor, which between them contained the bulk of the marble quarries. Proctor was named for and almost completely owned by Senator Redfield Proctor. In 1892 Rutland City was incorporated, and the remaining town of Rutland that encircled it was primarily rural.

==Geography==
Rutland is located at , elevation 164.6 m (540 ft).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Rutland is drained by Otter Creek, Moon Brook, Tenney Brook, East Creek and Mussey Brook.

The town is crossed by U.S. Route 4, U.S. Route 7 and Vermont Route 4A.

The town of Rutland is home to the former Diamond Run Mall and Castleton University&#x27;s Spartan Arena.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2010, there were 4,054 people, 1,691 households, and 1,166 families residing in the town. The population density was 209.7 people per square mile (81.0/km2). There were 1,761 housing units at an average density of 91.5 per square mile (35.3/km2). There were 1,691 households, out of which 28.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 58.1% were married couples living together, 8.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 31.0% were non-families. 26.6% of all households were made up of individuals, and 13.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.35 and the average family size was 2.85.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 22.1% under the age of 18, 4.3% from 18 to 24, 22.9% from 25 to 44, 32.0% from 45 to 64, and 18.8% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 45 years. For every 100 females, there were 89.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 84.4 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $44,420, and the median income for a family was $55,134. Males had a median income of $37,005 versus $25,053 for females. The per capita income for the town was $24,400. About 4.9% of families and 6.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 8.8% of those under the age of 18 and 7.7% of those ages 65 or older.

<text>Rutland is the only city in and the seat of Rutland County, Vermont, United States. As of the 2020 census, the city had a total population of 15,807. It is located approximately north of the Massachusetts state line, west of New Hampshire state line, and east of the New York state line. Rutland is the third largest city in the state of Vermont after Burlington and South Burlington. Rutland City is completely surrounded by Rutland Town, which is a separate municipality. The downtown area of the city is listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places.

==History==

The town of Rutland was chartered in 1761 and named after John Manners, 3rd Duke of Rutland. It was settled in 1770 and served as one of the capitals of the Republic of Vermont. In the early 19th century, small high-quality marble deposits were discovered in Rutland, and in the 1830s a large deposit of nearly solid marble was found in what is now West Rutland. By the 1840s, small firms had begun excavations, but marble quarries proved profitable only after the railroad arrived in 1851. Rutland eventually became one of the world&#x27;s leading marble producers. A large number of Italians with experience in the industry immigrated and brought their families to Rutland.
This fueled enough growth and investment that in 1886 the center of town incorporated as Rutland village. Most of the town was split off as West Rutland and Proctor, which contained the bulk of the marble quarries. Rutland City was incorporated as Vermont&#x27;s third city on November 18, 1892. The new city&#x27;s first mayor was John A. Mead.

The closing of the marble quarries in the area in the 1980s and 1990s led to a loss of jobs in the area.

<text>West Rutland is a town in Rutland County, Vermont, United States. The population was 2,214 at the 2020 census. The town center, located in the south-central portion of the town and where about 87% of the population resides, is defined by the U.S. Census Bureau as a census-designated place (CDP). The town is part of the Rutland micropolitan NECTA.

==Local culture==
West Rutland has many small businesses, many of which are found on Marble Street, the town&#x27;s main street. Other businesses include Boardman Hill Farm (including its associated solar farm) and the Carving Studio &amp; Sculpture Center.
The town has a small public school, West Rutland School, that enrolls students from pre-kindergarten to 12th grade. It is part of the Quarry Valley Unified Union School District.

==History==

The town of Rutland was originally granted in 1761 as one of the New Hampshire Grants and named after Rutland, Massachusetts, the home of the first grantee, John Murrey. It was one of the most successful of those grants because of excellent farmland and gentle topography.

In 1863, there was rioting in West Rutland after the state instituted a draft.

During a strike in 1868, owners evicted Irish-Catholic workers from company-owned homes, then imported dozens of French-Canadian Catholic &quot;strikebreakers&quot; to replace them.

West Rutland petitioned the Vermont legislature to separate from East Rutland. On November 19, 1886, West Rutland was incorporated as its own town.

The Marble Street Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.

=== Marble industry ===

In the early 19th century, small high-quality marble deposits were discovered in Rutland, and in the 1830s a large deposit of nearly solid marble of high quality was found in what is now West Rutland. By the 1840s small firms had begun operations, but marble quarries only became profitable when the railroad arrived in 1851. At the same time, the famous quarries of Carrara in Tuscany, Italy, became largely unworkable because of their extreme depth, and Rutland quickly became one of the leading producers of marble in the world.
This fueled enough growth and investment that in 1886 the marble companies saw to it that when the present Rutland City was incorporated, most of the remainder of the village was split off as West Rutland and Proctor. Although the closing of the marble quarries in the area in the 1980s and 1990s cost the town many jobs, West Rutland has attracted artists and families looking for a semi-rural lifestyle. Because it is a very rural town, much of its economy is dependent on the city of Rutland.

<doc id="350752" wikidata="Q1062702" url="?curid=350752" title="Video game music">
<text>Video game music (VGM) is the soundtrack that accompanies video games. Early video game music was once limited to sounds of early sound chips, such as programmable sound generators (PSG) or FM synthesis chips. These limitations have led to the style of music known as chiptune, which became the sound of the first video games.

With technological advances, video game music has grown to include a wider range of sounds. Players can hear music in video games over a game&#x27;s title screen, menus, and gameplay. Game soundtracks can also change depending on a player&#x27;s actions or situation, such as indicating missed actions in rhythm games, informing the player they are in a dangerous situation, or rewarding them for specific achievements.

Video game music can be one of two kinds: original or licensed.

The popularity of video game music has created education and job opportunities, generated awards, and led video game soundtracks to be commercially sold and performed in concerts.

== History ==
=== Early video game technology and computer chip music ===
At the time video games had emerged as a popular form of entertainment in the late 1970s, music was stored on physical media in analog waveforms such as cassette tapes and phonograph records. Such components were expensive and prone to breakage under heavy use, making them less than ideal for use in an arcade cabinet, though in rare cases such as &quot;Journey&quot;, they were used. A more affordable method of having music in a video game was to use digital means, where a specific computer chip would change electrical impulses from computer code into analog sound waves on the fly for output on a speaker. Sound effects for the games were also generated in this fashion. An early example of such an approach to video game music was the opening chiptune in Tomohiro Nishikado&#x27;s &quot;Gun Fight&quot; (1975).

While this allowed for the inclusion of music in early arcade video games, it was usually monophonic, looped or used sparingly between stages or at the start of a new game, such as the Namco titles &quot;Pac-Man&quot; (1980) composed by Toshio Kai or &quot;Pole Position&quot; (1982) composed by Nobuyuki Ohnogi. The first game to use a continuous background soundtrack was Tomohiro Nishikado&#x27;s &quot;Space Invaders&quot;, released by Taito in 1978. It had four descending chromatic bass notes repeating in a loop, though it was dynamic and interacted with the player, increasing pace as the enemies descended on the player. The first video game to feature continuous, melodic background music was &quot;Rally-X&quot;, released by Namco in 1980, featuring a simple tune that repeats continuously during gameplay. The decision to include any music into a video game meant that at some point it would have to be transcribed into computer code. Some music was original, some was public domain music such as folk songs. Sound capabilities were limited; the popular Atari 2600 home system, for example, was capable of generating only two tones at a time.

As advances were made in silicon technology and costs fell, a definitively new generation of arcade machines and home consoles allowed for great changes in accompanying music. In arcades, machines based on the Motorola 68000 CPU and accompanying various Yamaha YM programmable sound generator sound chips allowed for several more tones or &quot;channels&quot; of sound, sometimes eight or more. The earliest known example of this was Sega&#x27;s 1980 arcade game &quot;Carnival&quot;, which used an AY-3-8910 chip to create an electronic rendition of the classical 1889 composition &quot;Over The Waves&quot; by Juventino Rosas.

Konami&#x27;s 1981 arcade game &quot;Frogger&quot; introduced a dynamic approach to video game music, using at least eleven different gameplay tracks, in addition to level-starting and game over themes, which change according to the player&#x27;s actions. This was further improved upon by Namco&#x27;s 1982 arcade game &quot;Dig Dug&quot;, where the music stopped when the player stopped moving. &quot;Dig Dug&quot; was composed by Yuriko Keino, who also composed the music for other Namco games such as &quot;Xevious&quot; (1982) and &quot;Phozon&quot; (1983). Sega&#x27;s 1982 arcade game &quot;Super Locomotive&quot; featured a chiptune rendition of Yellow Magic Orchestra&#x27;s &quot;Rydeen&quot; (1979); several later computer games also covered the song, such as &quot;Trooper Truck&quot; (1983) by Rabbit Software as well as &quot;Daley Thompson&#x27;s Decathlon&quot; (1984) and &quot;Stryker&#x27;s Run&quot; (1986) composed by Martin Galway.

Home console systems also had a comparable upgrade in sound ability beginning with the ColecoVision in 1982 capable of four channels. However, more notable was the Japanese release of the Famicom in 1983 which was later released in the US as the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1985. It was capable of five channels, one being capable of simple PCM sampled sound. The home computer Commodore 64 released in 1982 was capable of early forms of filtering effects, different types of waveforms and eventually the undocumented ability to play 4-bit samples on a pseudo fourth sound channel. Its comparatively low cost made it a popular alternative to other home computers, as well as its ability to use a TV for an affordable display monitor.

Early games used simple tone generation and/or frequency modulation synthesis to simulate instruments for melodies, and used a &quot;noise channel&quot; for simulating percussive noises. PCM samples were limited to short sound bites (&quot;Monopoly&quot;), or used in place of percussion sounds (&quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot;). Home consoles often shared music channels with sound effects. For example, a spaceship&#x27;s 1400 Hz square wave laser beam sound effect would interrupt any music on that channel.

The mid-to-late 1980s software releases for these platforms had music developed by more people with greater musical experience than before. Quality of composition improved noticeably, and evidence of the popularity of the music of this time period remains even today. Composers who made a name for themselves with their software include Koichi Sugiyama (&quot;Dragon Quest&quot;), Nobuo Uematsu (&quot;Final Fantasy&quot;), Rob Hubbard (&quot;Monty On the Run&quot;, &quot;International Karate&quot;), Koji Kondo (&quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;), Miki Higashino (&quot;Gradius&quot;, &quot;Yie-Ar Kung Fu&quot;, &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;), Hiroshi Kawaguchi (&quot;Space Harrier&quot;, &quot;Hang-On&quot;, &quot;Out Run&quot;), Hirokazu Tanaka (&quot;Metroid&quot;, &quot;Kid Icarus&quot;, &quot;EarthBound&quot;), Martin Galway (&quot;Daley Thompson&#x27;s Decathlon&quot;, &quot;Stryker&#x27;s Run&quot;, &quot;Times of Lore&quot;), David Wise (&quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot;), Yuzo Koshiro (&quot;Dragon Slayer&quot;, &quot;Ys&quot;, &quot;Shinobi&quot;, &quot;ActRaiser&quot;, &quot;Streets of Rage&quot;), Mieko Ishikawa (&quot;Dragon Slayer&quot;, &quot;Ys&quot;), and Ryu Umemoto (visual novels, shoot &#x27;em ups). By the late 1980s, video game music was being sold as cassette tape soundtracks in Japan, inspiring American companies such as Sierra, Cinemaware and Interplay to give more serious attention to video game music by 1988. The Golden Joystick Awards introduced a category for &quot;Best Soundtrack of the Year&quot; in 1986, won by Sanxion.

Some games for cartridge systems have been sold with extra audio hardware on board, including &quot;Pitfall II&quot; for the Atari 2600 and several late Famicom titles. These chips add to the existing sound capabilities.

=== Early digital synthesis and sampling ===
From around 1980, some arcade games began taking steps toward digitized, or sampled, sounds. Namco&#x27;s 1980 arcade game &quot;Rally-X&quot; was the first known game to use a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) to produce sampled tones instead of a tone generator. That same year, the first known video game to feature speech synthesis was also released: Sunsoft&#x27;s shoot &#x27;em up game &quot;Stratovox&quot;. Around the same time, the introduction of frequency modulation synthesis (FM synthesis), first commercially released by Yamaha for their digital synthesizers and FM sound chips, allowed the tones to be manipulated to have different sound characteristics, where before the tone generated by the chip was limited to the design of the chip itself. Konami&#x27;s 1983 arcade game &quot;Gyruss&quot; used five synthesis sound chips along with a DAC, which were used to create an electronic version of J. S. Bach&#x27;s &quot;Toccata and Fugue in D minor&quot;.

Beyond arcade games, significant improvements to personal computer game music were made possible with the introduction of digital FM synth boards, which Yamaha released for Japanese computers such as the NEC PC-8801 and PC-9801 in the early 1980s, and by the mid-1980s, the PC-8801 and FM-7 had built-in FM sound. The sound FM synth boards produced are described as &quot;warm and pleasant sound&quot;. Musicians such as Yuzo Koshiro and Takeshi Abo utilized to produce music that is still highly regarded within the chiptune community. The widespread adoption of FM synthesis by consoles would later be one of the major advances of the 16-bit era, by which time 16-bit arcade machines were using multiple FM synthesis chips.

One of the earliest home computers to make use of digital signal processing in the form of sampling was the Amiga in 1985. The computer&#x27;s sound chip featured four independent 8-bit digital-to-analog converters. Developers could use this platform to take samples of a music performance, sometimes just a single note long, and play it back through the computer&#x27;s sound chip from memory. This differed from &quot;Rally-X&quot; in that its hardware DAC was used to play back simple waveform samples, and a sampled sound allowed for a complexity and authenticity of a real instrument that an FM simulation could not offer. For its role in being one of the first and affordable, the Amiga would remain a staple tool of early sequenced music composing, especially in Europe.

The Macintosh and Amiga home computers offered these features before most others. The Atari ST, the Amiga&#x27;s main rival, used a Yamaha YM2149 Programmable Sound Generator (PSG); but, compared to Amiga&#x27;s proprietary sound engine, Atari&#x27;s PSG could handle only one channel of sound and needed the computer&#x27;s CPU to process data. This was impractical until the 1989 release of the Atari STE, which used DMA techniques to play back PCM samples at up to 50 kHz. The ST remained relevant, however; equipped with a MIDI controller and external ports, it became the choice for many professional musicians as a MIDI programming device.

IBM PC clones in 1985 would not see any significant development in multimedia abilities for a few more years, and sampling would not become popular in other video game systems for several years. Though sampling had the potential to produce much more realistic sounds, each sample required much more data in memory. This was at a time when all memory, solid-state (ROM cartridge), magnetic (floppy disk) or otherwise was still very costly per kilobyte. Sequenced soundchip-generated music, on the other hand, was generated with a few lines of comparatively simple code and took up far less precious memory.

Arcade systems pushed game music forward in 1984 with the introduction of FM (Frequency Modulation) synthesis, providing more organic sounds than previous PSGs. The first such game, Marble Madness used the Yamaha YM2151 FM synthesis chip.

As home consoles moved into the fourth generation, or 16-bit era, the hybrid approach (sampled and tone) to music composing continued to be used. The Sega Genesis offered advanced graphics over the NES and improved sound synthesis features (also using a Yamaha chip, the YM2612), but largely held the same approach to sound design. Ten channels in total for tone generation with one for PCM samples were available in stereo instead of the NES&#x27;s five channels in mono, one for PCM. As before, it was often used for percussion samples. The Genesis did not support 16-bit sampled sounds. Despite the additional tone channels, writing music still posed a challenge to traditional composers and it forced much more imaginative use of the FM synthesizer to create an enjoyable listening experience. The composer Yuzo Koshiro utilized the Genesis hardware effectively to produce &quot;progressive, catchy, techno-style compositions far more advanced than what players were used to&quot; for games such as &quot;The Revenge of Shinobi&quot; (1989) and the &quot;Streets of Rage&quot; series, setting a &quot;new high watermark for what music in games could sound like.&quot; The soundtrack for &quot;Streets of Rage 2&quot; (1992) in particular is considered &quot;revolutionary&quot; and &quot;ahead of its time&quot; for its blend of house music with &quot;dirty&quot; electro basslines and &quot;trancey electronic textures&quot; that &quot;would feel as comfortable in a nightclub as a video game.&quot; Another important FM synth composer was the late Ryu Umemoto, who composed music for many visual novels and shoot &#x27;em ups during the 1990s.

As the cost of magnetic memory declined in the form of diskettes, the evolution of video game music on the Amiga, and some years later game music development in general, shifted to sampling in some form. It took some years before Amiga game designers learned to wholly use digitized sound effects in music (an early exception case was the title music of text adventure game &quot;The Pawn&quot;, 1986). By this time, computer and game music had already begun to form its own identity, and thus many music makers intentionally tried to produce music that sounded like that heard on the Commodore 64 and NES, which resulted in the chiptune genre.

The release of a freely-distributed Amiga program named Soundtracker by Karsten Obarski in 1987 started the era of MOD-format which made it easy for anyone to produce music based on digitized samples. Module files were made with programs called &quot;trackers&quot; after Obarski&#x27;s Soundtracker. This MOD/tracker tradition continued with PC computers in the 1990s. Examples of Amiga games using digitized instrument samples include David Whittaker&#x27;s soundtrack for &quot;Shadow of the Beast&quot;, Chris Hülsbeck&#x27;s soundtrack for &quot;Turrican 2&quot; and Matt Furniss&#x27;s tunes for &quot;Laser Squad&quot;. Richard Joseph also composed some theme songs featuring vocals and lyrics for games by Sensible Software most famous being &quot;Cannon Fodder&quot; (1993) with a song &quot;War Has Never Been So Much Fun&quot; and &quot;Sensible World of Soccer&quot; (1994) with a song &quot;Goal Scoring Superstar Hero&quot;. These songs used long vocal samples.

A similar approach to sound and music developments had become common in the arcades by this time and had been used in many arcade system boards since the mid-1980s. This was further popularized in the early 1990s by games like &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; (1991) on the CPS-1, which used voice samples extensively along with sampled sound effects and percussion. Neo Geo&#x27;s MVS system also carried powerful sound development which often included surround sound.

The evolution also carried into home console video games, such as the release of the Super Famicom in 1990, and its US/EU version Super NES in 1991. It sported a specialized custom Sony chip for both the sound generation and for special hardware DSP. It was capable of eight channels of sampled sounds at up to 16-bit resolution, had a wide selection of DSP effects, including a type of ADSR usually seen in high-end synthesizers of the time, and full stereo sound. This allowed experimentation with applied acoustics in video games, such as musical acoustics (early games like &quot;Super Castlevania IV&quot;, &quot;F-Zero&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot;, &quot;Gradius III&quot;, and later games like &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;), directional (&quot;Star Fox&quot;) and spatial acoustics (Dolby Pro Logic was used in some games, like &quot;King Arthur&#x27;s World&quot; and &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;), as well as environmental and architectural acoustics (&quot;A Link to the Past&quot;, &quot;Secret of Evermore&quot;). Many games also made heavy use of the high-quality sample playback capabilities (&quot;Super Star Wars&quot;, &quot;Tales of Phantasia&quot;). The only real limitation to this powerful setup was the still-costly solid state memory. Other consoles of the generation could boast similar abilities yet did not have the same circulation levels as the Super NES. The Neo-Geo home system was capable of the same powerful sample processing as its arcade counterpart but was several times the cost of a Super NES. The Sega CD (the Mega CD outside North America) hardware upgrade to the Mega Drive (Genesis in the US) offered multiple PCM channels, but they were often passed over instead to use its capabilities with the CD-ROM itself.

The popularity of the Super NES and its software remained limited to regions where NTSC television was the broadcast standard. Partly because of the difference in frame rates of PAL broadcast equipment, many titles released were never redesigned to play appropriately and ran much slower than had been intended, or were never released. This showed a divergence in popular video game music between PAL and NTSC countries that still shows to this day. This divergence would be lessened as the fifth generation of home consoles launched globally, and as Commodore began to take a back seat to general-purpose PCs and Macs for developing and gaming.

Though the Mega CD/Sega CD, and to a greater extent the PC Engine in Japan, would give gamers a preview of the direction video game music would take in streaming music, the use of both sampled and sequenced music continues in game consoles even today. The huge data storage benefit of optical media would be coupled with progressively more powerful audio generation hardware and higher quality samples in the Fifth Generation. In 1994, the CD-ROM equipped PlayStation supported 24 channels of 16-bit samples of up to 44.1 kHz sample rate, samples equal to CD audio in quality. It also sported a few hardware DSP effects like reverb. Many Square titles continued to use sequenced music, such as &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, &quot;Legend of Mana&quot;, and &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot;. The Sega Saturn also with a CD drive supported 32 channels of PCM at the same resolution as the original PlayStation. In 1996, the Nintendo 64, still using a solid-state cartridge, actually supported an integrated and scalable sound system that was potentially capable of 100 channels of PCM, and an improved sample rate of 48 kHz. Games for the N64, because of the cost of the solid-state memory, typically had samples of lesser quality than the other two, however, and music tended to be simpler in construct.

The more dominant approach for games based on CDs, however, was shifting toward streaming audio.

=== MIDI on the PC ===
In the same timeframe of the late 1980s to mid-1990s, the IBM PC clones using the x86 architecture became more ubiquitous, yet had a very different path in sound design than other PCs and consoles. Early PC gaming was limited to the PC speaker, and some proprietary standards such as the IBM PCjr 3-voice chip. While sampled sound could be achieved on the PC speaker using pulse width modulation, doing so required a significant proportion of the available processor power, rendering its use in games rare.

With the increase of x86 PCs in the market, there was a vacuum in sound performance in home computing that expansion cards attempted to fill. The first two recognizable standards were the Roland MT-32, followed by the AdLib sound card. Roland&#x27;s solution was driven by MIDI sequencing using advanced LA synthesizers. This made it the first choice for game developers to produce upon, but its higher cost as an end-user solution made it prohibitive. The AdLib used a low-cost FM synthesis chip from Yamaha, and many boards could operate compatibly using the MIDI standard.

The AdLib card was usurped in 1989 by Creative&#x27;s Sound Blaster, which used the same Yamaha FM chip in the AdLib, for compatibility, but also added 8-bit 22.05 kHz (later 44.1 kHz) digital audio recording and playback of a single stereo channel. As an affordable end-user product, the Sound Blaster constituted the core sound technology of the early 1990s; a combination of a simple FM engine that supported MIDI, and a DAC engine of one or more streams. Only a minority of developers ever used Amiga-style tracker formats in commercial PC games, (&quot;Unreal&quot;) typically preferring to use the MT-32 or AdLib/SB-compatible devices. As general purpose PCs using x86 became more ubiquitous than the other PC platforms, developers drew their focus towards that platform.

The last major development before streaming music came in 1992: Roland Corporation released the first General MIDI card, the sample-based SCC-1, an add-in card version of the SC-55 desktop MIDI module. The comparative quality of the samples spurred similar offerings from Soundblaster, but costs for both products were still high. Both companies offered &#x27;daughterboards&#x27; with sample-based synthesizers that could be later added to a less expensive soundcard (which only had a DAC and a MIDI controller) to give it the features of a fully integrated card.

Unlike the standards of Amiga or Atari, a PC using x86 even then could be using a broad mix of hardware. Developers increasingly used MIDI sequences: instead of writing soundtrack data for each type of soundcard, they generally wrote a fully featured data set for the Roland application that would be compatible with lesser featured equipment so long as it had a MIDI controller to run the sequence. However, different products used different sounds attached to their MIDI controllers. Some tied into the Yamaha FM chip to simulate instruments, some daughterboards of samples had very different sound qualities; meaning that no single sequence performance would be accurate to every other General MIDI device.

All of these considerations in the products reflected the high cost of memory storage which rapidly declined with the optical CD format.

=== Pre-recorded and streaming music ===
Taking entirely pre-recorded music had many advantages over sequencing for sound quality. Music could be produced freely with any kind and number of instruments, allowing developers to simply record one track to be played back during the game. Quality was only limited by the effort put into mastering the track itself. Memory space costs that was previously a concern was somewhat addressed with optical media becoming the dominant media for software games. CD quality audio allowed for music and voice that had the potential to be truly indistinguishable from any other source or genre of music.

In fourth generation home video games and PCs this was limited to playing a Mixed Mode CD audio track from a CD while the game was in play (such as &quot;Sonic CD&quot;). The earliest examples of Mixed Mode CD audio in video games include the TurboGrafx-CD RPG franchises &quot;Tengai Makyō&quot;, composed by Ryuichi Sakamoto from 1989, and the &quot;Ys&quot; series, composed by Yuzo Koshiro and and arranged by in 1989. The &quot;Ys&quot; soundtracks, particularly &quot;Ys I &amp; II&quot; (1989), are still regarded as some of the most influential video game music ever composed.

However, there were several disadvantages of regular CD-audio. Optical drive technology was still limited in spindle speed, so playing an audio track from the game CD meant that the system could not access data again until it stopped the track from playing. Looping, the most common form of game music, was also a problem as when the laser reached the end of a track, it had to move itself back to the beginning to start reading again causing an audible gap in playback.

To address these drawbacks, some PC game developers designed their own container formats in house, for each application in some cases, to stream compressed audio. This would cut back on memory used for music on the CD, allowed for much lower latency and seek time when finding and starting to play music, and also allowed for much smoother looping due to being able to buffer the data. A minor drawback was that use of compressed audio meant it had to be decompressed which put load on the CPU of a system. As computing power increased, this load became minimal, and in some cases, dedicated chips in a computer (such as a sound card) would actually handle all the decompressing.

Fifth generation home console systems also developed specialised streaming formats and containers for compressed audio playback. Games would take full advantage of this ability, sometimes with highly praised results (&quot;&quot;). Games ported from arcade machines, which continued to use FM synthesis, often saw superior pre-recorded music streams on their home console counterparts (&quot;Street Fighter Alpha 2&quot;). Even though the game systems were capable of &quot;CD quality&quot; sound, these compressed audio tracks were not true &quot;CD quality.&quot; Many of them had lower sampling rates, but not so significant that most consumers would notice. Using a compressed stream allowed game designers to play back streamed music and still be able to access other data on the disc without interruption of the music, at the cost of CPU power used to render the audio stream. Manipulating the stream any further would require a far more significant level of CPU power available in the 5th generation.

Some games, such as the &quot;Wipeout&quot; series, continued to use full Mixed Mode CD audio for their soundtracks.

This overall freedom offered to music composers gave video game music the equal footing with other popular music it had lacked. A musician could now, with no need to learn about programming or the game architecture itself, independently produce the music to their satisfaction. This flexibility would be exercised as popular mainstream musicians would be using their talents for video games specifically. An early example is &quot;Way of the Warrior&quot; on the 3DO, with music by White Zombie. A more well-known example is Trent Reznor&#x27;s score for &quot;Quake&quot;.

An alternate approach, as with the &quot;TMNT&quot; arcade, was to take pre-existing music not written exclusively for the game and use it in the game. The game &quot;Star Wars: X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter&quot; and subsequent &quot;Star Wars&quot; games took music composed by John Williams for the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films of the 1970s and 1980s and used it for the game soundtracks.

Both using new music streams made specifically for the game, and using previously released/recorded music streams are common approaches for developing sound tracks to this day. It is common for X-games sports-based video games to come with some popular artists recent releases (&quot;SSX&quot;, &quot;Tony Hawk&quot;, &quot;Initial D&quot;), as well as any game with heavy cultural demographic theme that has tie-in to music (&quot;Need For Speed: Underground&quot;, &quot;Gran Turismo&quot;, and &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot;). Sometimes a hybrid of the two are used, such as in &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot;.

Many sports game titles like Madden NFL, NBA 2K, and FIFA use popular and underground songs in their soundtrack to give their menus atmosphere. The phrase &quot;FIFA song&quot; has become popular in recent years, it describes a song (often not American) that is upbeat and has lots of rhythm. The inclusion on the FIFA soundtrack has given many artists exposure that helped launch their music careers.

Sequencing samples continue to be used in modern gaming where fully recorded audio is not viable. Until the mid-2000s, many larger games on home consoles used sequenced audio to save space. Additionally, most games on the Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS used sequenced music due to storage limitations. Sometimes a cross between sequencing samples, and streaming music is used. Games such as &quot;&quot; (music composed by James Hannigan) and &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Generals&quot; (music composed by Bill Brown) have utilised sophisticated systems governing the flow of incidental music by stringing together short phrases based on the action on screen and the player&#x27;s most recent choices (see dynamic music). Other games dynamically mixed the sound on the game based on cues of the game environment.

As processing power increased dramatically in the 6th generation of home consoles, it became possible to apply special effects in realtime to streamed audio. In &quot;SSX&quot;, a recent video game series, if a snowboarder takes to the air after jumping from a ramp, the music softens or muffles a bit, and the ambient noise of wind and air blowing becomes louder to emphasize being airborne. When the snowboarder lands, the music resumes regular playback until its next &quot;cue&quot;. The LucasArts company pioneered this interactive music technique with their iMUSE system, used in their early adventure games and the &quot;Star Wars&quot; flight simulators &quot;Star Wars: X-Wing&quot; and &quot;Star Wars: TIE Fighter&quot;. Action games such as these will change dynamically to match the amount of danger. Stealth-based games will sometimes rely on such music, either by handling streams differently, or dynamically changing the composition of a sequenced soundtrack.

=== Personalized soundtracks ===

Being able to play one&#x27;s own music during a game in the past usually meant turning down the game audio and using an alternative music player. Some early exceptions were possible on PC/Windows gaming in which it was possible to independently adjust game audio while playing music with a separate program running in the background. Some PC games, such as &quot;Quake&quot;, play music from the CD while retrieving game data exclusively from the hard disk, thereby allowing the game CD to be swapped for any music CD. The first PC game to introduce in-game support for custom soundtracks was Lionhead Studio&#x27;s &quot;Black &amp; White&quot;. The 2001 game included an in-game interface for Winamp that enabled the players to play audio tracks from their own playlists. In addition, this would sometimes trigger various reactions from the player&#x27;s Creature, like dancing or laughing.

Some PlayStation games supported this by swapping the game CD with a music CD, although when the game needed data, players had to swap the CDs again. One of the earliest games, &quot;Ridge Racer&quot;, was loaded entirely into RAM, letting the player insert a music CD to provide a soundtrack throughout the entirety of the gameplay. In &quot;Vib Ribbon&quot;, this became a gameplay feature, with the game generating levels based entirely on the music on whatever CD the player inserted.

Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox allowed music to be copied from a CD onto its internal hard drive, to be used as a &quot;Custom Soundtrack&quot;, if enabled by the game developer. The feature carried over into the Xbox 360 where it became supported by the system software and could be enabled at any point. The Wii is also able to play custom soundtracks if it is enabled by the game (&quot;Excite Truck&quot;, &quot;Endless Ocean&quot;). The PlayStation Portable can, in games like &quot;Need for Speed Carbon: Own the City&quot; and &quot;FIFA 08&quot;, play music from a Memory Stick.

The PlayStation 3 has the ability to utilize custom soundtracks in games using music saved on the hard drive, however few game developers used this function. &quot;MLB 08: The Show&quot;, released in 2008, has a My MLB sound track feature that allows the user to play music tracks of their choice saved on the hard drive of their PS3, rather than the preprogrammed tracks incorporated into the game by the developer. An update to &quot;Wipeout HD&quot;, released on the PlayStation Network, was made to also incorporate this feature.

In the video game &quot;Audiosurf&quot;, custom soundtracks are the main aspect of the game. Users have to pick a music file to be analyzed. The game will generate a race track based on tempo, pitch and complexity of the sound. The user will then race on this track, synchronized with the music.

Games in the &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; series have supported custom soundtracks, using them as a separate in-game radio station. The feature was primarily exclusive to PC versions, and was adopted to a limited degree on console platforms. On a PC, inserting custom music into the stations is done by placing music files into a designated folder. For the Xbox version, a CD must be installed into the console&#x27;s hard drive. For the iPhone version of &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars&quot;, players create an iTunes playlist which is then played by the game.

&quot;Forza Horizon 3&quot; used a similar technology of custom soundtracks with the help of Groove Music.

=== Developments in the 2000s ===

The Xbox 360 supports Dolby Digital software, sampling and playback rate of 16-bit @ 48 kHz (internal; with 24-bit hardware D/A converters), hardware codec streaming, and potential of 256 audio simultaneous channels. While powerful and flexible, none of these features represent any major change in how game music is made from the last generation of console systems. PCs continue to rely on third-party devices for in-game sound reproduction, and SoundBlaster is largely the only major player in the entertainment audio expansion card business.

The PlayStation 3 handles multiple types of surround sound technology, including Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio, with up to 7.1 channels, and with sampling rates of up to 192 kHz.

Nintendo&#x27;s Wii console shares many audio components with the GameCube from the previous generation, including Dolby Pro Logic II. These features are extensions of technology already currently in use.

== Impact and importance ==
Many video game players believe that music can enhance game play and outlets such as &quot;Popular Science&quot; have stated that it is designed to &quot;simultaneously stimulate your senses and blend into the background of your brain, because that&#x27;s the point of the soundtrack. It has to engage you, the player, in a task without distracting from it. In fact, the best music would actually direct the listener to the task.&quot;

Sound effects within game play are also believed to impact game performance. Ambient sounds such as those present in &quot;Resident Evil&quot; are seen to enhance the tension felt by players, something that GameSpot stated was also used in cinema. Speeding up the sound effects and music in games such as &quot;Space Invaders&quot; is also stated to have a strong impact on the gaming experience when done properly. Properly done, this can help create realism within virtuality and alert players to important scenes and information.

Music and sound effects can become memorable, enabling people to instantly recognize music or sound effects as well as hum or mimic the tune or sound effect. Polygon has stated that despite the popularity of video game music, people may not always know the name of the composer.

== Licensing ==
Using licensed music for video games became more popular as the medium used to distribute games grew large enough to accommodate songs alongside a game&#x27;s other assets. Additionally, with the large growth of the video game market in the 2000s, song licensing became a lucrative route for music rights holders to gain part of that revenue. Games like those in the &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; series became showcases of licensed music. Music licensing is generally complicated due to various copyright laws, typically with at least two separate copyrights to consider: the songwriters&#x27; and the performers&#x27; contributions. Most large video game developers and publishers who use licensed music typically have staff proficient in licensing to clear songs for use in video games with the various music labels and other creative persons.

Games with licensed music can have problems well past release if perpetual rights for the music are not secured for the game. Early games before the onset of digital distribution would have perpetual right for the music since there was no practical way to update the game following release at retail to deal with curtailed rights. However, digital distribution platforms, like Steam, Xbox Live, and PlayStation Network keep games up-to-date automatically. Music licenses for games sold through digital distribution may include limited terms, requiring the publisher to re-negotiate rights with the music&#x27;s owner, or otherwise the music must be removed from the game through these updates. Notably, &quot;Alan Wake&quot; by Remedy Entertainment, first released in 2010, had to be pulled from digital sale in 2017 due to expiring music rights. However, with Microsoft&#x27;s help, Remedy was able to re-secure these rights a year later and returned the game for sale. &quot;Alpha Protocol&quot; by Obsidian Entertainment was also pulled from sale in 2019 due to expiring music license rights, though there are no known plans if publisher Sega will seek to renew these.

Due to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, most of the popular video sites use automated forms of detection (like YouTube&#x27;s Content ID), flagging or blocking content that uses copyrighted music. To help players avoid this problem when streaming videos (see Let&#x27;s Play), some games offer a &quot;stream-safe&quot; option, either disabling the music or replacing it with copyright-free or royalty-free music.

== Game music as a genre ==
Many games for the Nintendo Entertainment System and other early game consoles feature a similar style of musical composition that is sometimes described as the &quot;video game genre.&quot; Some aspects of this style continue to influence certain music today, though gamers do not associate many modern game soundtracks with the older style. The genre&#x27;s compositional elements largely developed due to technological restraints, while also being influenced by electronic music bands, particularly Yellow Magic Orchestra (YMO), who were popular during the late 1970s to 1980s. YMO sampled sounds from several classic arcade games in their early albums, most notably &quot;Space Invaders&quot; in the 1978 hit song &quot;Computer Game&quot;. In turn, the band would have a major influence on much of the video game music produced during the 8-bit and 16-bit eras. Video game music of that era was also influenced by Japanese city pop and jazz fusion music.

Features of the video game music genre include:

* Pieces designed to repeat indefinitely, rather than having an arranged ending or fading out (they however create an atmosphere, especially in important scenes of the game. They introduce a philosophical dimension in the game, as they may introduce questioning in the mind of players, in relationship with their next action).
* Pieces lacking lyrics and playing over gameplay sounds.
* Limited polyphony. Only three notes can be played simultaneously on the Nintendo Entertainment System. A great deal of effort was put into composition to create the illusion of more notes playing at once.

Although the tones featured in NES music can be thought of as emulating a traditional four-piece rock band (triangle wave used as a bass, two pulse waves analogous to two guitars, and a white noise channel used for drums), composers would often go out of their way to compose complex and rapid sequences of notes, in part due to the restrictions mentioned above. This is similar to music composition during the Baroque period, when composers, particularly when creating solo pieces, focused on musical embellishments to compensate for instruments such as the harpsichord that do not allow for expressive dynamics. For the same reason, many early compositions also feature a distinct jazz influence. These would overlap with later influences from heavy metal and J-pop music, resulting in an equally distinct compositional style in the 16-bit era.

In an unrelated but parallel course in the European and North American developer scene, similar limitations were driving the musical style of home computer games. Module file format music, particularly MOD, used similar techniques but was more heavily influenced by the electronic music scene as it developed, and resulted in another very distinct subgenre. Demos and the developing demoscene played a big part in the early years, and still influence video game music today.

As technological limitations gradually lifted, composers were given more freedom and, with the advent of CD-ROM, pre-recorded soundtracks came to dominate, resulting in a noticeable shift in composition and voicing style. Popular early CD-ROM titles were released with high-resolution graphics and recorded music. Since the audio was not reliant on a sound-card&#x27;s synthesis, CD-ROM technology ensured that composers and sound designers could know what audio would sound like on most consumer configurations and could also record sound effects, live instruments, vocals, and in-game dialogue.

== Outside video games ==
Appreciation for video game music is strong among fans and composers, particularly for music from the third and fourth generations of home video game consoles, and sometimes newer generations. This appreciation has been shown outside the context of a video game, in the form of CDs, sheet music, public performances, art installations, and popular music.

=== CDs and sheet music ===
Selling video game soundtracks separately as CDs has become increasingly popular in the industry. Interpretive albums, remixes, and live performance albums were also common variations to original soundtracks (OSTs).

Koichi Sugiyama was an early figure in this practice, and following the release of the first &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; game in 1986, a live performance CD of his compositions was released and performed by the Tokyo Strings Ensemble (then later by other groups including the London Philharmonic Orchestra, and Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra).

By 1987, Sega were selling 50,000 to 100,000 game soundtrack CDs annually. Yuzo Koshiro, another early figure, released a live performance of the &quot;Actraiser&quot; soundtrack. Both Koshiro&#x27;s and fellow Falcom composer Mieko Ishikawa&#x27;s contributions to &quot;Ys&quot; music would have such long-lasting impact that there were more albums released of Ys music than of almost all other game-type music.

Like anime soundtracks, these soundtracks and even sheet music books were usually marketed exclusively in Japan. Therefore, interested gamers outside Japan had to import the soundtracks and/or sheet music books through on or offline firms specifically dedicated to video game soundtrack imports. This has been somewhat less of an issue more recently as domestic publishers of anime and video games have been producing western equivalent versions of the OSTs for sale in UK and US, though these are often for more popular titles. Video game music companies like Materia Collective have pursued and produced published book editions of video game music.

The sale of video game soundtracks has created a growing symbiotic relationship between the music industry and the games industry. Commonly, games are being used to promote and sell licensed music, rather than just original score, and recording artists are being used to market and sell games. Music marketing agency Electric Artists conducted a study that revealed a number of interesting statistics surrounding &quot;hard-core gamers&quot; and their music habits: 40% of hard-core gamers bought the CD after hearing a song they liked in a video game, 73% of gamers said soundtracks within games help sell more CDs, and 40% of respondents said a game introduced them to a new band or song, then 27% of them went out and bought what they heard. Some game soundtracks have become so popular they have reached platinum status, such as NBA Live 2003.

=== Public performance ===
Many original composers have publicly exhibited their music through symphonic concert performances. Once again, Koichi Sugiyama was the first to execute this practice in 1987 with his &quot;Family Classic Concert&quot; featuring live performances of &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; music and had continued these concert performances almost annually. In 1991, he also formed a series called Orchestral Game Music Concerts, notable for featuring music of other talented game composers such as Yoko Kanno (&quot;Nobunaga&#x27;s Ambition&quot;, &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, &quot;Uncharted Waters&quot;), Nobuo Uematsu (&quot;Final Fantasy&quot;), Keiichi Suzuki (&quot;Mother/Earthbound&quot;), and Kentaro Haneda (&quot;Wizardry&quot;).

Following suit, compositions by Nobuo Uematsu on &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; were arranged into &quot;Final Fantasy IV: Celtic Moon&quot;, a live performance by string musicians with strong Celtic influence recorded in Ireland. The Love Theme from the same game has been used as an instructional piece of music in Japanese schools.

With the success of Square&#x27;s 1990s games &quot;Final Fantasy VI, Final Fantasy VII&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; by Nobuo Uematsu, and &quot;Chrono Trigger, Xenogears&quot; and &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; by Yasunori Mitsuda, public performance began to gain international popularity. On August 20, 2003, music written for video games such as &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; and &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; was performed for the first time outside Japan, by the Czech National Symphony Orchestra in a Symphonic Game Music Concert in Leipzig, Germany at the Gewandhaus concert hall. This event was held as the official opening ceremony of Europe&#x27;s biggest trading fair for video games, the GC Games Convention and repeated in 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007.

On November 17, 2003, Square Enix launched the &quot;Final Fantasy Radio&quot; on America Online. The radio station has initially featured complete tracks from &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy XI: Rise of Zilart&quot; and samplings from &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; through &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;.

The first officially sanctioned Final Fantasy concert in the United States was performed by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra at Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, California, on May 10, 2004. All seats at the concert were sold out in a single day. &quot;Dear Friends: Music from Final Fantasy&quot; followed and was performed at various cities across the United States. Nobuo Uematsu has also performed a variety of Final Fantasy compositions live with his rock band, The Black Mages.

On July 6, 2005, the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra also held a Video Games Live concert at the Hollywood Bowl, an event founded by video game music composers Tommy Tallarico and Jack Wall. This concert featured a variety of video game music, ranging from &quot;Pong&quot; to &quot;Halo 2&quot;. It also incorporated real-time video feeds that were in sync with the music, as well as laser and light special effects. Media outside the video game industry, such as NPR and &quot;The New York Times&quot;, have covered their subsequent world tours.

On August 20, 2006, the Malmö Symphonic Orchestra with host Orvar Säfström performed the outdoor game music concert Joystick in Malmö, Sweden before an audience of 17,000, holding the current record of attendance for a game music concert. Säfström has since continued to produce game music concerts around Europe under the names Joystick and Score.

From April 20–27, 2007, Eminence Symphony Orchestra, an orchestra dedicated to video game and anime music, performed the first part of their annual tour, the &quot;A Night in Fantasia&quot; concert series in Australia. Whilst Eminence had performed video game music as part of their concerts since their inception, the 2007 concert marked the first time ever that the entire setlist was pieces from video games. Up to seven of the world&#x27;s most famous game composers were also in attendance as special guests. Music performed included Red Alert 3 Theme: Soviet March by James Hannigan and Shadow of the Colossus by Kow Otani.

Since 2010, video games-themed &quot;pops&quot; concerts have become a major proportion of the revenue in many United States concert halls, as traditional classical music performances decline in popularity.

On March 16, 2012, the Smithsonian American Art Museum&#x27;s &quot;The Art of Video Games&quot; exhibit opened featuring a chipmusic soundtrack at the entrance by artists 8 Bit Weapon &amp; ComputeHer. 8 Bit Weapon also created a track called &quot;The art of Video Games Anthem&quot; for the exhibit as well.

The first video game music-focused concert for the BBC Proms was held on August 1, 2022.

=== In popular music ===
In the popular music industry, video game music and sounds have appeared in songs by various popular artists. Arcade game sounds had a particularly strong influence on the hip hop, pop music (particularly synthpop) and electro music genres during the golden age of arcade video games in the early 1980s. Arcade game sounds had an influence on synthpop pioneers Yellow Magic Orchestra, who sampled &quot;Space Invaders&quot; sounds in their influential 1978 debut album, particularly the hit song &quot;Computer Game&quot;. In turn, the band would have a major influence on much of the video game music produced during the 8-bit and 16-bit eras.

Other pop songs based on &quot;Space Invaders&quot; soon followed, including &quot;Disco Space Invaders&quot; (1979) by Funny Stuff, &quot;Space Invaders&quot; (1980) by Playback, and the hit songs &quot;Space Invader&quot; (1980) by The Pretenders and &quot;Space Invaders&quot; (1980) by Uncle Vic. Buckner &amp; Garcia produced a successful album dedicated to video game music in 1982, &quot;Pac-Man Fever&quot;. Former YMO member Haruomi Hosono also released a 1984 album produced entirely from Namco arcade game samples entitled &quot;Video Game Music&quot;, an early example of a chiptune record and the first video game music album. Warp&#x27;s record &quot;Testone&quot; (1990) by Sweet Exorcist sampled video game sounds from YMO&#x27;s &quot;Computer Game&quot; and defined Sheffield&#x27;s bleep techno scene in the early 1990s. In 1991, American alternative rock band Pixies released a cover version of the main theme from the arcade game &quot;Narc&quot; as a B-side to the single &quot;Planet of Sound&quot;.

More recently, &quot;video game beats&quot; have appeared in popular songs such as Kesha&#x27;s &quot;Tik Tok&quot;, the best-selling single of 2010, as well as &quot;U Should Know Better&quot; by Robyn featuring Snoop Dogg, and &quot;Hellbound&quot; by Eminem. The influence of video game music can also be seen in contemporary electronica music by artists such as Dizzee Rascal and Kieran Hebden. Grime music in particular samples sawtooth wave sounds from video games which were popular in East London. English power metal band DragonForce is also known for their &quot;retro video game influenced&quot; sound.

== Video game music education ==
Video game music has become part of the curriculum at the degree, undergraduate, and graduate levels in many traditional colleges and universities. According to the Entertainment Software Association, there are over 400 schools offering courses and degrees in video game design in the United States, many of which include sound and music design. Berklee College of Music, Yale University, New York University, and the New England Conservatory have all introduced game music into their music programs. These programs offer immersive education in music composition, orchestration, editing and production. Other post-secondary schools have more games-focused programs, such as DigiPen Institute of Technology, Columbia College Chicago, and Academy of Art University, who all offer programs in Music and Sound Design. These programs include courses in sound effect creation, interactive sound design, and scripting music.

Similar programs have gained popularity in Europe. The Utrecht School of the Arts (Faculty of Art, Media and Technology) has offered a Game Sound and Music Design program since 2003. The University of Hertfordshire has a program in Music Composition and Technology for Film and Games, Leeds Beckett University offers Sound and Music for Interactive Games, and dBs Music Bristol teaches Sound for Games and Apps.

More informal institutions, like the training seminars at GameSoundCon also feature classes in how to compose video game music.

Extracurricular organizations devoted to the performance of video game music have also been implemented in tandem with these new curriculum programs. The Gamer Symphony Orchestra at the University of Maryland performs self-arranged video game music and the Video Game Orchestra is a semiprofessional outgrowth of students from the Berklee College of Music and other Boston-area schools.

According to the National Association for Music Education, video game music is now being taught at elementary and secondary school levels to aid in the understanding of music composition. Students at Magruder High School in Montgomery County, Maryland have even started a student-run gamer orchestra, and many high school bands perform game music.

== Academic study ==

Academic research on video game music began in the late 1990s, and developed through the mid-2000s. Early research on the topic often involved historical studies of game music, or comparative studies of video game music and film music (see, for instance, Zach Whalen&#x27;s article &quot;Play Along – An Approach to Videogame Music&quot; which includes both). The study of video game music is also known by some as &quot;ludomusicology&quot; – a portmanteau of &quot;ludology&quot; (the study of games and gameplay) and &quot;musicology&quot; (the study and analysis of music) – a term coined independently by Guillaume Laroche and Roger Moseley.

A prominent figure in early video game music and audio research is Karen Collins, who is associate professor at the University of Waterloo and Canada Research Chair in Interactive Audio at the University of Waterloo Games Institute. Her monograph &quot;Game Sound: An Introduction to the History, Theory and Practice of Video Game Music and Sound Design&quot; (MIT Press 2008) is considered a seminal work in the field, and was influential in the subsequent development of video game music studies.

The Ludomusicology Research Group is an inter-university research organisation focusing on the study of music in games, music games and music in video game culture, composed of four researchers: Michiel Kamp, Tim Summers, Melanie Fritsch, and Mark Sweeney. Together they organise an annual international conference held in the UK or Europe (at the time of writing, the most recent was the Ludo2017 conference held at Bath Spa University). The group was founded by Kamp, Summers and Sweeney in August 2011, who have also edited a collection of essays based around the study of game sound entitled &quot;Ludomusicology: Approaches to Video Game Music&quot;, published in July 2016. They also edited a double special issue of &quot;The Soundtrack&quot; and initiated a new book series for the &quot;Study in Game Sound and Music&quot; in 2017. In September 2016, Tim Summers&#x27; book &#x27;Understanding Video Game Music&#x27; was published by Cambridge University Press.
Fritsch officially joined the group in 2016. She had edited the 2nd issue of the online journal &quot;ACT – Zeitschrift für Musik und Performance&quot;, published in July 2011, which included ludomusicological contributions written by Tim Summers, Steven B. Reale and Jason Brame. She had been a regular at the conferences since 2012 and published several book chapters on the topic. Whereas Kamp, Summers and Sweeney have a background in musicology, Fritsch&#x27;s background is in performance studies.

The North American Conference on Video Game Music (NACVGM) is an international conference on video game music held annually in North America since 2014. It is organised by Neil Lerner, Steven Beverburg Reale and William Gibbons.

In late 2016 the Society for the Study of Sound and Music in Games (SSSMG) was launched by the Ludomusicology Research Group in conjunction with the organisers of the North American Conference on Video Game Music and the Audio Mostly conference. The SSSMG has the aim of bringing together both practitioners and researchers from across the globe in order to develop the field&#x27;s understanding of sound and video game music and audio. Its focus is the use of its website as a &quot;hub&quot; for communication and resource centralisation, including a video game music research bibliography (a project initially begun by the Ludomusicology Research Group).

The Ludomusicology Society of Australia was launched by Barnabas Smith in April 2017, during the Ludo2017 conference in Bath, UK; it aims to &quot;offer a centralised and local professional body nurturing game music studies for academics, people in industry and game music fans alike in the Australasian region.&quot;

== Composers ==
Creating and producing video game music requires strong teams and coordination among the different divisions of game development. As the market has expanded, so have the types of jobs in game music. The process often starts with the game designer, who will have a specific musical theme or genre in mind for the game. Their options include contracting original composers or licensing existing music, both of which require other music experts.

During the arcade and early console era (1983 to the mid-1990s), most game music was composed by full-time employees of the particular game company producing the game. This was largely due to the very specialized nature of video game music, where each system had its own technology and tool sets. It was not uncommon for a game company like Capcom or Konami to have a room full of composers, each at their own workstation with headphones writing music.

Once the CD-era hit and studio recorded music became more ubiquitous in games, it became increasingly common for game music to be composed by independent contractors, hired by the game developer on a per-project basis. Most bigger budget games such as &quot;Call of Duty&quot;, &quot;Mass Effect&quot;, &quot;Ghost Recon&quot;, or &quot;Lost Planet&quot; hire composers in this fashion. Approximately 50% of game composers are freelance, the remaining being employees of a game company. Original score and soundtrack may require the hiring of a music director, who will help create the game music as well as help book the resources needed for performing and recording the music. Some music directors may work with a game&#x27;s Sound Designer to create a dynamic score. Notable exceptions include composer Koji Kondo, who remains an employee at Nintendo, and Martin O&#x27;Donnell, who worked at Bungie until early 2014.

The growth of casual, mobile and social games has greatly increased opportunities for game music composers, with job growth in the US market increasing more than 150% over five years. Independently developed games are a frequent place where beginning game composers gain experience composing for video games. Game composers, particularly for smaller games, are likely to provide other services such as sound design (76% of game composers also do some sound design), integration (47% of game composers also integrate their music into audio middleware), or even computer coding or scripting (15%).

With the rising use of licensed popular music in video games, job opportunities in game music have also come to include the role of a music supervisor. Music supervisors work on behalf of a game developer or game publisher to source pre-existing music from artists and music publishers. These supervisors can be hired on a per-project basis or can work in-house, like the Music Group for Electronic Arts (EA) that has a team of music supervisors. A music supervisor is needed to not only help select music that will suit the game, but to also ensure the music is fully licensed in order to avoid lawsuits or conflicts. Music supervisors may also help negotiate payment, which for artists and songwriters is often a one-time buy-out fee, because games do not generate music royalties when they are sold. A growing trend is to contract artists to write original songs for games, to add to their value and exclusivity, and once again supervisors can be a part of that process.

== Awards ==

=== Current ===
=== Defunct ===
=== Other ===
In 2011, video game music made its first appearance at the Grammy Awards when &quot;Baba Yetu&quot;, a song from &quot;Civilization IV&quot;, won the 53rd annual music awards&#x27; Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocalists, making it the first video game music to be nominated for (or to win) a Grammy. The song won for its placement on Christopher Tin&#x27;s album &quot;Calling All Dawns&quot;, but had been used in the game six years prior. In 2022, video game music made another appearance at the Grammy Awards, with The 8-Bit Big Band&#x27;s cover (arranged by Charlie Rosen and Jake Silverman) of &quot;Meta Knight&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, a song from Kirby Super Star, winning the 64th Annual Grammy Awards&#x27; Grammy Award for Best Arrangement, Instrumental or A Capella.

Other video game awards include the International Film Music Critics Association (IFMCA) award for Best Original Score for Interactive Media and Machinima.com&#x27;s Inside Gaming Awards for Best Original Score and Best Sound Design.

In addition to recognizing the composers of original score, the Guild of Music Supervisors offer a GMS Award to the music supervisors that select and coordinate licensed music for video games.

== Fan culture ==
Video game fans have created their own fan sites &quot;dedicated to the appreciation and promotion of video game music&quot;, such as OverClocked ReMix.

Fans also make their own song remixes and compilations, like insaneintherainmusic, and have built online remixing communities through the ease of internet distribution.

The Japanese dōjin music scene is notable for producing albums of arranged videogame music which derived from popular retro franchises such as &quot;Mega Man&quot;, &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; or &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, from dōjin games, such as Touhou Project, studio Key visual novels and &quot;When They Cry&quot; series, from popular franchises on Comiket, such as Type-Moon&#x27;s Fate series or &quot;Kantai Collection&quot;. There have been over six thousand dōjin albums of &quot;Touhou Project&quot; music released.

<text>Tehanu , initially subtitled &quot;The Last Book of Earthsea&quot;,
is a fantasy novel by the American author Ursula K. Le Guin, published by Atheneum in February 1990. It is the fourth novel set in the fictional archipelago Earthsea, published almost twenty years after the first three Earthsea novels (1968–1972), and not the last, despite its original subtitle.

The novel is viewed as an enlargement of the earlier &quot;Earthsea&quot; trilogy (marketed for young adults), as &quot;Tehanu&quot; presents an aging hero and heroine—Ged, a principal character in all three earlier &quot;Earthsea&quot; novels, and Tenar, the protagonist of the second in the series, &quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot;. It won the 1990 Nebula Award for Best Novel, and the 1991 Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel.

==Background==
===Setting===

As described by the author, Le Guin, in a recorded afterward to the 2016 audiobook version, as &quot;Tehanu&quot; opens, approximately 25 years have passed since the events at the end of &quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot;, &quot;time enough for the girl Tenar to become a widow with grown children&quot;; and &quot;a day or two&quot; have passed since the close of &quot;The Farthest Shore&quot; and &quot;Tehanu&quot;&#x27;s Chapter 4, &quot;Kalessin&quot;, &quot;time enough for [that] dragon... to carry Ged from Roke to Gont.&quot;

===Main characters and earlier novels=== 
At the opening of the novel the reader is introduced to a character whose relationships to earlier characters in other &quot;Earthsea&quot; novels is not immediately clear. Eventually an early suggested similarity between the main character, Goha—based on vague historical comments, and her appearance, activities, and relationships (&quot;Tehanu&quot;, Chapter 1)—and the earlier character Tenar from &quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot; is borne out as true, and the novel thus provides information on that persisting character after the end of the earlier novel. Specifically, the novel makes clear that she had rejected the life of an aristocrat in Havnor, and instead decided to reside on Gont. It discloses that she lived with the earlier character, the Archmage Ged&#x27;s old master, the mage Ogion, and that though fond of him, rejected Ogion&#x27;s offer to teach her magic. On Gont, she marries the farmer, Flint, who referred to her as Goha, a local word for a &quot;little, white, web-spinning spider&quot; there, as she was small, and fair-skinned, and a good spinner of wool (&quot;Tehanu&quot;, Chapter 1). Later we will learn that Goha&#x27;s choice to become a goatherd&#x27;s wife and mother &quot;was a disappointment to [Archmage] Ged&quot;.

== Plot ==
Goha lives alone because her farmer husband Flint has died, and her two children, Apple and Spark, are grown. A burned child is brought to her at Oak Farm, and she saves her life. The burns leave scarring on the face, and the fingers of one hand have been fused into a claw. Goha adopts her and gives the child the name Therru, which means flame.

Goha learns that Ogion requests her presence at his deathbed in Re Albi. She sets out to visit him with Therru. On the way, she encounters a group of ruffians, one of whom is Handy, who claims to be Therru&#x27;s uncle. Ogion reveals Goha as Tenar, and he says she must teach Therru. After his death, Tenar stays on at his cottage, assisted by Moss, a local witch, and Heather, a simple village girl. Ged (also called Sparrowhawk) arrives on the back of the dragon Kalessin, unconscious and near death, having spent all his wizardly powers in sealing the gap between the worlds of the living and the dead created by the evil sorceror Cob. Tenar nurses Ged back to health, but when the new king Lebannen sends envoys to bring him back to Havnor for the coronation, Ged cannot face them. He accepts Tenar&#x27;s offer to return to Oak Farm to manage things there in her absence and once more takes up life as a goatherd. While at Re Albi, Tenar is confronted by the local lord&#x27;s wicked mage, Aspen, who attempts to put a curse on her, but is thwarted.

Tenar informs the king&#x27;s men that she cannot reveal Ged&#x27;s whereabouts, and they accept the situation and depart. Tenar is threatened by both Aspen and Handy, and she flees with Therru. Confused by Aspen&#x27;s magic, Tenar is almost overtaken by Handy, but escapes to Gont Port, taking refuge in the king&#x27;s ship. Lebannen takes Tenar and Therru to Valmouth, where Tenar eventually returns to Oak Farm to find that Ged is away tending goats in the mountains for the season. Tenar settles back into life on the farm, until one night when Handy and a few other men attempt to break into the house. They are driven off by Tenar and Ged, and the latter nearly kills one of them with a pitchfork. Tenar and Ged begin a relationship, acknowledging that they had always loved each other. Ged wants to settle down and live an ordinary life. Together, they teach and care for Therru and manage the farm. Tenar&#x27;s son Spark returns home from the sea and demands the farm. Under Gontish law Oak Farm belongs to him.

Tenar receives word that Moss is dying and wants to see her. She, Ged and Therru leave for Re Albi. However, the message was a trap set by Aspen, who reveals himself to be a follower of Cob. Tenar and Ged are led to the lord&#x27;s mansion controlled by Aspen&#x27;s magic. Therru runs to the cliff behind Ogion&#x27;s cottage, where she calls to the dragon Kalessin for help, and reveals her true nature: she is in fact &quot;a double being, half human, half-dragon&quot;. Aspen and his followers bring both Tenar and Ged up to the clifftop. Under the influence of Aspen&#x27;s spell, they are both moving to jump to their deaths when the dragon Kalessin arrives, burning Aspen and his men. Kalessin addresses Therru by her true name Tehanu, calling her its own daughter, and asks her if she would like to leave with it. Tehanu decides to stay with Tenar and Ged. All three settle down to a simple life at Ogion&#x27;s old cottage.

==Major characters==

The primary characters of the novel are:
* Goha, as known by her husband and locals, who is revealed to be &quot;Tenar&quot;, former priestess of the Tombs of Atuan, and the White Lady of Gont.
* Ged, also called &quot;Sparrowhawk&quot;, the Archmage of Roke.
* Aspen, revealed as &quot;Erisen&quot;, a twisted mage and follower of &quot;Cob&quot;.
* Kalessin, a dragon, the eldest.
* Therru, a burned child, revealed as &quot;Tehanu&quot;, and a woman-dragon.

==Focus, pacing, style, and interpretation==

The initial trilogy focuses on the character and quests of Ged, with Tenar introduced as the central character of the second book. Writing for &quot;Reactor Magazine&quot;, Jo Walton writes that &quot;Tehanu&quot; is &quot;a restless book with very strange pacing&quot;, and the novel&#x27;s mood is darker and more introspective. The style of &quot;Tehanu&quot; differs from the initial &quot;Earthsea&quot; trilogy; whereas the trilogy was written around classic fantasy tropes of perilous quests, heroic actions, and larger-than-human forces, &quot;Tehanu&quot; focuses on social interaction and emotional resonance.

&quot;Tehanu&quot; uses the lens of everyday events and a strong anti-patriarchal viewpoint to not only explore the future of the two recurring characters—and of Earthsea itself—but to reinterpret them. In an analysis from a doctoral dissertation chapter—that Le Guin featured on her webpage—Sharada Bhanu argues that &quot;Tehanu&quot;, the fourth &quot;Earthsea&quot; volume, functions with &quot;Tales from Earthsea&quot; and &quot;The Other Wind&quot; as a subsequent trilogy,different in many ways from the first. Sexual experience... finds place in the second... [While] the first three featur[e] an adolescent coming of age... [&quot;Teanu&quot; features] middle-aged protagonists... [and the fact that they and the] one silent child [are] observed till almost the end of the novel from the outside, constitute a change of focus and provide a different emotional tone. Bhanu goes on to note that[t]he second trilogy enlarges, interrogates and deconstructs the first [and that] ...the text has emerged from... a changed cultural ethos, in particular the feminist movement. &#x27;Weak as women’s magic; wicked as women’s magic&#x27; goes a saying in Earthsea, [and] the school of Roke admits no women. ... Tehanu redresses the balance by presenting a woman’s world, interests, magic and problems, through the perspective of Tenar... now a middle aged widow. Women of various ages and professions are pictured, all portraits... sympathetic. The men on the other hand seem weak and limited in vision even when well meaning, [and] misogynistic, depraved and vicious when given up to... evil...
==Reception==
Michael Dirda, writing for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, notes that &quot;Tehanu&quot; &quot;reveal[s] what happened to [the series&#x27;] hero and heroine in old age&quot;, and with its emphasis on these aging, earlier novel protagonists is thus an enlargement of the earlier &quot;Earthsea&quot; trilogy (which was largely just marketed for young adults). &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; comments that &quot;Yes, there are dragons; but the human story and its meaning are primary here. Unlike Ged&#x27;s, Le Guin&#x27;s power is undiminished.&quot; The review notes that Ged and Tenar are &quot;past middle age&quot;, reflecting the slower action, but &quot;even young readers will be beguiled by the flawless, poetic prose, the philosophy expressed in thoughtful, potent metaphor, and the consummately imagined world&quot;. The &quot;Science Fiction Review&quot; summarized the novel as &quot;Great things happen to great people, whatever their station in life, and wherever they may be. An excellent story and a fine capstone to Earthsea.&quot;

&quot;Tehanu&quot; won the 1990 Nebula Award; this made Le Guin the first person to win three Nebula Awards for Best Novel. It also won the Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel, and was nominated for the Mythopoeic Fantasy Award.

<doc id="350757" wikidata="Q5295294" url="?curid=350757" title="Donald Wayne Foster">
<text>Donald Wayne Foster (born 1950) is a retired professor of English at Vassar College in New York. He is known for his work dealing with various issues of Shakespearean authorship through textual analysis. He has also applied these techniques in attempting to uncover mysterious authors of some high-profile contemporary texts. As several of these were in the context of criminal investigations, Foster was sometimes labeled a &quot;forensic linguist&quot;. He has been inactive in this arena, however, since Condé Nast settled a defamation lawsuit brought against one of his publications for an undisclosed sum in 2007.

==Shakespearean scholarship==
Foster first achieved notice for addressing the mystery of the dedication of Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets. In the edition published by Thomas Thorpe, a dedication appears to &quot;Mr. W.H.&quot; as the &quot;onlie begetter&quot; of the sonnets, and the identity of W.H. has aroused much speculation over the years. While in graduate school at the University of California, Santa Barbara, Foster formulated a theory that it was a typographical error. Though not the first to articulate the possibility, his article appeared in the Publication of the Modern Language Association in 1987, after he joined the Vassar faculty. Foster argued that the initials were meant to read either &quot;W.S.&quot; or &quot;W.SH.&quot; for Shakespeare himself, the dedication presumably having been written by Thorpe. Foster pointed to Shakespeare&#x27;s initials being similarly abbreviated in other documents, as well as contemporaneous publications that misspelled authors&#x27; initials in the error-filled manuscripts of the time.

While pursuing his research into these initials, Foster came across another work that led him to believe he had identified a previously unknown Shakespeare piece. This was a 1612 poem, &quot;A Funerall Elegye in memory of the late Vertuous Maister William Peeter&quot;, and would have been the first new Shakespeare identification in over a century. Thorpe, the publisher of the sonnets, had registered this work with the London Stationers, giving the author&#x27;s initials as &quot;W.S.&quot;.

Relying on the internal evidence of the text, Foster argued that Shakespeare could be the author and submitted a manuscript about the &quot;Elegy&quot; to Oxford University Press, but two experts recommended against publication on the grounds that such evidence was insufficient to establish authorship. Foster was not given their names, following normal practice for peer review, although he later related that he was able to identify the reviewers based on the language of their reports . The book was published instead by the University of Delaware Press in 1989.

Initially Foster did not claim that his identification was definitive, but in 1995 another Shakespeare scholar, Richard Abrams of the University of Southern Maine, published an article strengthening Foster&#x27;s claims of the &quot;Elegy&quot;″s Shakespearean authorship. Foster then claimed publicly that the &quot;Elegy&quot; &quot;belongs hereafter with Shakespeare&#x27;s poems and plays&quot; and gained international media attention. He supported his identification with computer analysis based on a database he called SHAXICON, used to compare the poem&#x27;s word choice with that of Shakespeare and his contemporaries. The &quot;Elegy&quot; was subsequently included in some editions of Shakespeare&#x27;s complete works, though with qualifications, and it was never considered to be of great quality.

After considerable debate, Foster&#x27;s theory was eventually rejected by other Shakespeare scholars. In 2002, Gilles Monsarrat, a translator of Shakespeare into French, published an article arguing that the poem&#x27;s true author was John Ford, a younger writer whose works Monsarrat had also edited. Foster conceded that Monsarrat had the better case in a post on the SHAKSPER listserv, saying, &quot;No one who cannot rejoice in the discovery of his own mistakes deserves to be called a scholar.&quot; Foster said he had not previously analyzed Ford&#x27;s works closely enough and had erroneously dismissed him as a possibility.

==Literary analysis in contemporary cases==
Meanwhile, the publicity surrounding Foster&#x27;s analytical skills led to him being called upon to track down the authors of various anonymous and pseudonymous texts. Using a mixture of traditional scholarship and computers to perform textual comparisons, Foster looked for unique and unusual usage patterns. Computer-based statistical techniques for textual analysis had been used by historians before Foster, most notably with the &quot;Federalist Papers&quot;. As Foster has pointed out, however, such methods are not definitive: &quot;The notion has been perpetuated that there&#x27;s a computer program that can identify authorship, and there isn&#x27;t&quot;.

In 1996, Foster was one of the people who helped reveal Joe Klein as the author of the &quot;anonymous&quot; bestseller &quot;Primary Colors&quot;. Foster named Klein in an article for &quot;New York&quot; magazine, following the lead of a former Clinton speechwriter, David Kusnet, who had fingered Klein in the &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; a few weeks earlier. Klein objected, partly because the theories cited similarities between the book and Klein&#x27;s writings on racial issues, and he disliked the way his attitude was being characterized. The matter subsided after additional revelations forced Klein to acknowledge that he wrote the book.

In some instances, Foster has raised arguments challenging whether the person traditionally identified as the author of a text was correct. He has pointed to an obscure Beat writer, Tom Hawkins, as the author of the Wanda Tinasky letters, which some had previously speculated to be the work of Thomas Pynchon. Foster also joined a long-running effort by descendants of Henry Livingston Jr. to show that their ancestor, and not Clement Clarke Moore, wrote the famous poem &quot;A Visit from St. Nicholas&quot;.

Foster provided his account of sleuthing out these and other identifications in his book &quot;Author Unknown&quot; (including the Shakespeare-&quot;Elegy&quot; connection, which he still supported at the time). The chapters on Shakespeare and Klein were praised as particularly lively, although the rest of the book was considered less substantial. One reviewer suggested that he spent too much time on the personal character of the writers he analyzed, such as Klein&#x27;s alleged &quot;issues&quot; with blacks and women, or Moore&#x27;s support for slavery. The reviewer still found Foster&#x27;s arguments about authorship, based on the textual analysis of their writing styles, convincing.

==Assistance to criminal investigations==
On several occasions, Foster has participated in criminal cases that required literary analysis. He was brought into the case of Theodore Kaczynski to compare the Unabomber manifesto with other examples of Kaczynski&#x27;s writing. Originally approached by defense attorneys hoping that he might rebut an FBI analysis and the identification of the writing by Kaczynski&#x27;s brother, Foster ultimately concluded that the evidence of authorship was even stronger than the FBI was claiming.

===Ramsey murder case===

In 1997, Foster became involved in the investigation of JonBenét Ramsey&#x27;s murder, a case in which a ransom note played a significant role.

In his 2000 book on the case, Detective Steve Thomas wrote:
&quot;I finally heard the magic words while seated in the book-lined office of Don Foster, an Elizabethan scholar and professor at Vassar College in upstate New York, who just happened to be a hell of a linguistic detective. &#x27;Steve,&#x27; said Foster, &#x27;I believe I am going to conclude the ransom note was the work of a single individual: Patsy Ramsey.&#x27;&quot;

Thomas described Foster&#x27;s presentation to the Boulder authorities in March 1998: &quot;&#x27;In my opinion, it is not possible that any individual except Patsy Ramsey wrote the ransom note,&#x27; he told a special briefing in Boulder, adding that she had been unassisted in writing it. With his sterling academic reputation and a track record of 152-0 in deciphering anonymous writings, this should have been a thunderbolt of evidence, but the DA&#x27;s office, without telling us, had already discredited and discarded the professor. His coming to Boulder was a big waste of time.&quot;

From a book by FBI profiler John Douglas, also written in 2000: &quot;In 1998, Foster announced he had determined that Patsy Ramsey had written the ransom note, which sounded pretty compelling coming from such an established expert, and (Detective) Steve Thomas has written that he placed great weight on Foster&#x27;s analysis. But then it came out that in the Spring of 1997, he had written to Patsy Ramsey at the Charlevoix, Michigan house to offer his condolences, encouragement and the statement, &quot;I know you are innocent - know it, absolutely and unequivocally. I will stake my personal reputation on it.&quot;&quot;

And from a book by Andrew Hodges: &quot;Based on his comparison of Patsy&#x27;s handwriting with the ransom note, Foster told Hunter that Patsy Ramsey had written the letter. But Foster, as it turned out, had badly compromised himself as an expert witness when, early in the case, he had spontaneously written to Patsy to tell her that his initial opinion was that she was innocent. Not long after that, Foster had also staked his reputation that an internet personality by the name of Jameson was really John Andrew (John Ramsey&#x27;s son), and that he felt John Andrew was behind the murder. These two factors came to light later after Foster had changed his mind and decided Patsy had written the note. But by then, the damage was done, essentially rendering useless Foster&#x27;s 100 page report on the ransom note.&quot;

===Anthrax case===

Foster returned to advise the FBI during the investigation of the 2001 anthrax attacks. He later wrote an article for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; about his investigation of Steven Hatfill, a virologist who had been labeled a &quot;person of interest&quot; by Attorney General John Ashcroft. In an October 2003 article for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, Foster tried to match up Hatfill&#x27;s travels with the postmarks on the anthrax letters, and analyzed old interviews and an unpublished novel by Hatfill about a bioterrorist attack on the United States. Hatfill was identified as a possible culprit. &quot;The Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; published a condensed version of the article in December 2003. The perpetrator of the anthrax attacks turned out to be another government bio-weapons scientist.

Hatfill subsequently sued Donald Foster, Condé Nast Publications, Vassar College, and The Reader&#x27;s Digest Association, seeking $10 million in damages, claiming defamation. The case was settled by Condé Nast in 2007 for an undisclosed amount. Foster ceased any public discussion of the case.

<doc id="350758" wikidata="Q545595" url="?curid=350758" title="Soyuz 14">
<text>Soyuz 14 (, &quot;Union 14&quot;) was a July, 1974, crewed spaceflight to the Salyut 3 space station. &quot;Soyuz 14&quot; is also the name given to the Soyuz spacecraft which was used to bring the cosmonauts to and from the station. The mission was part of the Soviet Union&#x27;s Almaz program to evaluate the military applications of crew spaceflight. The mission&#x27;s crew members were cosmonauts Pavel Popovich and Yuri Artyukhin. At the time, the military nature of this mission and the station itself were not acknowledged by Soviet authorities. 

The flight was the first successful mission to a space station by the Soviets. The mission proved to be the only one for Salyut 3 as Soyuz 15 failed to dock with the station in August 1974 and the station was de-orbited in January 1975. With the American Skylab missions now complete, the flight marked the start of the monopoly of crewed space activities by the Soviets until the 1981 launch of STS-1, the first Space Shuttle flight, save for the joint Apollo–Soyuz flight of 1975.

== Mission highlights ==
With the Salyut 3 space station successfully launched on 24 June 1974, Soyuz 14 was sent into orbit nine days later, on 3 July 1974. The craft docked with the space station the next day, performing a manual approach for the last 100 metres. The crew tested the suitability of Salyut 3 as a crewed military reconnaissance platform. They also tested Almaz station systems, such as the solar arrays. Increased solar activity raised safety issues, but it was decided radiation levels were within safe limits, so the flight continued.

Experiments were described by the Soviets, but analysts presumed that much time was taken up with unreported military activities. Claims were made in the aerospace press that objects were laid out at the Baikonur Cosmodrome to photograph to test a high-resolution camera system on board. Some of the experiments the Soviets described included studies of the heart and circulatory systems in orbit, studies of intracranial pressure, monitoring of blood composition, measuring of lung capacity and inhalation/exhalation rates and the testing of a water purification system which condensed moisture from the station&#x27;s atmosphere.

The cosmonauts exercised for two hours each day to counter the effects of weightlessness. Because of this, they were able to climb from their Soyuz descent module without assistance when their flight ended on 19 July 1974. The crew left enough supplies on Salyut 3 to last the next crew at least six months.

<text>Robert Joseph Cousy ( , born August 9, 1928) is an American former professional basketball player. He played point guard for the Boston Celtics from 1950 to 1963, and briefly with the Cincinnati Royals during the 1969–70 season. A 13-time NBA All-Star and 1957 NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP), Cousy was a core piece during the early half of the Celtics dynasty winning six NBA championships during his 13-year tenure with the Celtics. Nicknamed &quot;The Houdini of the Hardwood&quot;, Cousy was the NBA assists leader for eight consecutive seasons, introducing a new blend of ball-handling and passing skills to the NBA. He is regarded as the first great point guard of the NBA, and was the first to reach the 4,000, 5,000, and 6,000 career assists milestones.

Making his high school varsity squad as a junior, Cousy went on to earn a scholarship to the College of the Holy Cross, where he led the Crusaders to berths in the 1948 NCAA Tournament and the 1950 NCAA Tournament, while winning NCAA All-American honors for three seasons. Cousy entered the 1950 NBA draft and was initially drafted by the Tri-Cities Blackhawks as the third overall pick in the first round, but after he refused to report he was picked up by Boston. Following his playing career with the Celtics he served as a college basketball coach and an NBA head coach for the Cincinnati Royals.

Upon his election to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1971 the Celtics retired his No. 14 jersey and hung it in the rafters of the Garden. Cousy was named to the NBA 25th Anniversary Team in 1971, the NBA 35th Anniversary Team in 1981, the NBA 50th Anniversary All-Time Team in 1996, and the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021 making him one of only four players that were selected to each of those teams. He is also one of only two of these players who is still alive with Bob Pettit as of 2025 and the older of the two living members. He was also the first president of the National Basketball Players Association. On August 22, 2019, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Donald Trump.

==Early life==
Cousy was the only son of poor French immigrants living in New York City. He grew up in the Yorkville neighborhood of Manhattan&#x27;s East Side, in the midst of the Great Depression. His father Joseph was a cab driver, who earned extra income by moonlighting. The elder Cousy was born in Belfort, France, and grew up in Alsace–Lorraine (then a disputed German territory), unwillingly serving in the Imperial German Army during World War I. Shortly after the war, his first wife died of pneumonia, leaving behind a young daughter. He married Juliette Corlet, a secretary and French teacher from Dijon. They lived on a potato farm in Lachapelle-sous-Rougemont before immigrating to the United States when Juliette was pregnant with Bob. At the time of the 1930 census, the family was renting an apartment in Astoria, Queens, for $50 per month. The younger Cousy spoke French for the first 5 years of his life, and started to speak English only after entering primary school. He spent his early days playing stickball in a multicultural environment, regularly playing with Black, Jewish and other ethnic minority children. These experiences ingrained him with a strong anti-racist sentiment, an attitude he prominently promoted during his professional career. When he was 12, his family moved to a rented house in St. Albans, Queens. That summer, the elder Cousy put a $500 down payment for a $4,500 house four blocks away. He rented out the bottom two floors of the three-story building to tenants to help make his mortgage payments on time.

Cousy took up basketball at the age of 13 as a student at St. Pascal&#x27;s elementary school, and was &quot;immediately hooked&quot;. The following year, he entered Andrew Jackson High School in St Albans. His basketball success was not immediate, and in fact he was cut from the school team in his first year. Later that year, he joined the St. Albans Lindens of the Press League, a basketball league sponsored by the &quot;Long Island Press&quot;, where he began to develop his basketball skills and gained much-needed experience. The next year, however, he was again cut during the tryouts for the school basketball team.

That same year, he fell out of a tree and broke his right hand. The injury forced him to play left-handed until his hand healed, making him effectively ambidextrous. In retrospect, he described this accident as &quot;a fortunate event&quot; and cited it as a factor in making him more versatile on the court. During a Press League game, the high school basketball coach saw him play. He was impressed by the budding star&#x27;s two-handed ability and invited Cousy to come to practice the following day to try out for the junior varsity team. He did well enough to become a permanent member of the JV squad. He continued to practice day and night, and by his junior year was sure he was going to be promoted to the varsity; but failing his citizenship course made him ineligible for the first semester. He joined the varsity squad midway through the season, however, scoring 28 points in his first game. He had no intention of attending college, but after he started to make a name for himself on the basketball court he started to focus on improving in both academics and basketball skills to make it easier for him to get into college.

He again excelled in basketball his senior year, leading his team to the Queens divisional championship and amassing more points than any other New York City high school basketball player. He was even named captain of the &quot;Journal-American&quot; All-Scholastic team. He then began to plan for college. His family had wanted him to attend a Catholic school, and he wanted to go somewhere outside New York City. Boston College recruited him, and he considered accepting the BC offer, but it had no dormitories, and he was not interested in being a commuter student. Soon afterward, he received an offer from the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, about forty miles (64 kilometers) west of Boston. He was impressed by the school, and accepted the basketball scholarship it offered him. He spent the summer before matriculating working at Tamarack Lodge in the Catskill Mountains and playing in a local basketball league along with a number of established college players.

==College career==
Cousy was one of six freshmen on the Holy Cross Crusaders&#x27; varsity basketball team in 1946–47. From the start of the season, coach Doggie Julian chose to play the six freshmen off the bench in a two-team system, so that each player would get some time on the court. As members of the &quot;second team&quot;, they would come off the bench nine and a half minutes into the game, where they would relieve the &quot;first team&quot; starters. They would sometimes get to play as much as a third or even half of the game, but even at that Cousy was so disappointed with the lack of playing time that he went to the campus chapel after practice to pray that Julian would give him more of a chance to show off his talents on the court. Early in the season, however, he got into trouble with Julian, who accused him of being a showboater. Even as late as that 1946–47 season, basketball was a static game, depending on slow, deliberate player movement and flat-footed shots. Far different was Cousy&#x27;s up-tempo, streetball-like game, marked by ambidextrous finesse play and notable for behind-the-back dribbling and no-look, behind-the-back and half-court passing. Even so, he had enough playing time in games to score 227 points for the season, finishing with the third-highest total on the team. Led by stars George Kaftan and Joe Mullaney, the Crusaders finished the 1946–47 basketball season 24–3.

On the basis of that record, Holy Cross got into the 1947 NCAA Tournament as the last seed in the then only eight-team tournament. In the first game, they defeated Navy 55–47 in front of a sell-out crowd at Madison Square Garden. Mullaney led the team in scoring with 18 points, thanks to Navy coach Ben Carnevale&#x27;s decision to have his players back off from Mullaney, who was reputed as being more of a playmaker than a shooter. In the semifinal game, the Crusaders faced CCNY, coached by Nat Holman, one of the game&#x27;s earliest innovators. Led by Kaftan&#x27;s 30 points, Holy Cross easily defeated the Beavers 60–45. In the championship game, the Crusaders faced Oklahoma, coached by Bruce Drake, in another sold-out game at Madison Square Garden. Kaftan followed up his 30-point semifinal heroics with a mere 18 points in the title game, which was far more than enough for the team to defeat the Sooners 58–47. Cousy played poorly, however, scoring only four points on 2-for-13 shots. Holy Cross became the first New England college to win the NCAA tournament. On their arrival back in Worcester, the team was given a hero&#x27;s welcome by about 10,000 cheering fans who met their train at Union Station.

The following season Julian limited Cousy&#x27;s playing time, to the point that the frustrated sophomore contemplated transferring out of Holy Cross. Cousy wrote a letter to coach Joe Lapchick of St. John&#x27;s University in New York, informing him that he was considering a transfer there. Lapchick wrote back to Cousy that he considered Julian &quot;one of the finest basketball coaches in America&quot; and that he believed Julian had no bad intentions in restricting his playing time. He told Cousy that Julian would use him more often during his later years with the team. Lapchick alerted Cousy that transferring was a very risky move: according to NCAA rules, the player would be required to sit out a year before becoming eligible to play for the school to which he transferred. Cousy still managed to lead the Crusaders in scoring and was an AP Third Team All American. Cousy again led the team in scoring in his junior year, and was named a Second Team All American by multiple services, including the AP.

During Cousy&#x27;s senior year of 1949–1950, with 5 minutes to go and Holy Cross trailing in a game against Loyola of Chicago at Boston Garden, the crowd started to chant &quot;We want Cousy!&quot; until coach Julian relented. In these few minutes, Cousy scored 11 points and hit a game-winning buzzer-beater coming off a behind-the-back dribble. The performance established him as a team leader, and he then led Holy Cross to 26 straight wins and a Number 4 national ranking. He was a consensus First Team All-American, and led the team in scoring for the third straight season with 19.4 points per game. A three-time All-American, Cousy ended his college career in the 1950 NCAA Tournament, when Holy Cross fell to North Carolina State in an opening-round game at Madison Square Garden. CCNY would go on to win the tournament.

==Professional career==
===Boston Celtics (1950–1963)===
====Early years (1950–1956)====
Cousy turned pro and made himself available for the 1950 NBA draft. The Boston Celtics had just concluded the 1949–50 NBA season with a poor 22–46 win–loss record and had the first draft pick. It was strongly anticipated that they would draft the highly coveted local favorite Cousy. However, coach Red Auerbach snubbed him for center Charlie Share, saying: &quot;Am I supposed to win, or please the local yokels?&quot; The local press strongly criticized Auerbach, but other scouts were also skeptical about Cousy, viewing him as flamboyant but ineffective. One scout wrote in his report: &quot;The first time he tries that fancy Dan stuff in this league, they&#x27;ll cram the ball down his throat.&quot;

As a result, the Tri-Cities Blackhawks drafted Cousy, but the point guard was unenthusiastic about his new employer. Cousy was trying to establish a driving school in Worcester, Massachusetts and did not want to relocate to the Midwestern triangle of the three small towns of Moline, Rock Island and Davenport. As compensation for having to give up his driving school, Cousy demanded a salary of $10,000 from Blackhawks owner Ben Kerner. When Kerner offered him only $6,000, Cousy refused to report. Cousy was then picked up by the Chicago Stags, but when they folded, league Commissioner Maurice Podoloff declared three Stags available for a dispersal draft: team scoring leader Max Zaslofsky, Andy Phillip and Cousy. Celtics owner Walter A. Brown was one of the three club bosses invited. He later made it clear that he was hoping for Zaslofsky, would have tolerated Phillip, and did not want Cousy. When the Celtics drew Cousy, Brown confessed: &quot;I could have fallen to the floor.&quot; Brown reluctantly gave him a $9,000 salary.
It was not long before both Auerbach and Brown changed their minds. With averages of 15.6 points, 6.9 rebounds and 4.9 assists a game, Cousy received the first of his 13 consecutive NBA All-Star selections and led a Celtics team with future Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famers Ed Macauley and Bones McKinney to a 39–30 record in the 1950–51 NBA season. However, in the 1951 NBA Playoffs, the Celtics were beaten by the New York Knicks. With future Hall-of-Fame guard Bill Sharman on board the next season, Cousy averaged 21.7 points, 6.4 rebounds and 6.7 assists per game en route to his first All-NBA First Team nomination. Nonetheless, the Celtics lost to the Knicks in the 1952 NBA Playoffs.

In the following season, Cousy made further progress. Averaging 7.7 assists per game, he won the first of his eight consecutive assists titles. These numbers were made despite the fact that the NBA had not yet introduced the shot clock, making the game static and putting prolific assist givers at a disadvantage. Powered by Auerbach&#x27;s quick fastbreak-dominated tactics, the Celtics won 46 games and beat the Syracuse Nationals 2–0 in the 1953 NBA Playoffs. Game 2 ended 111–105 in a 4-overtime thriller, in which Cousy had a much-lauded game. Despite having an injured leg, he scored 25 points after four quarters, scored 6 of his team&#x27;s 9 points in the first overtime, hit a clutch free throw in the last seconds, and scored all 4 of Boston&#x27;s points in the second overtime. He scored 8 more points in the third overtime, among them a 25-ft. buzzer beater. In the fourth overtime, he scored 9 of Boston&#x27;s 12 points. Cousy played 66 minutes, and scored 50 points after making a still-standing record of 30 free throws in 32 attempts. This game is regarded by the NBA as one of the finest scoring feats ever, in line with Wilt Chamberlain&#x27;s 100-point game. However, for the third time in a row, the Knicks beat Boston in the next round.

In the next three years, Cousy firmly established himself as one of the league&#x27;s best point guards. Leading the league in assists all 3 seasons, and averaging 20 points and 7 rebounds, the versatile Cousy earned himself three more All-NBA First Team and All-Star honors, and was also Most Valuable Player of the 1954 NBA All-Star Game. In terms of playing style, Cousy introduced an array of visually attractive street basketball moves, described by the NBA as a mix of ambidextrous, behind-the-back dribbling and &quot;no-look passes, behind-the-back feeds or half-court fastbreak launches&quot;. Cousy&#x27;s modus operandi contrasted with the rest of the NBA, which was dominated by muscular low post scorers and deliberate set shooters. Soon, he was called &quot;Houdini of the Hardwood&quot; after the magician Harry Houdini. Cousy&#x27;s crowd-pleasing and effective play drew the crowd into the Boston Garden and also won over coach Auerbach, who no longer saw him as a liability, but as an essential building block for the future.

The Celtics eventually added two talented forwards, future Hall-of-Famer Frank Ramsey and defensive specialist Jim Loscutoff. Along with Celtics colleague Bob Brannum, Loscutoff also became Cousy&#x27;s unofficial bodyguard, retaliating against opposing players who would try to hurt him. The Celtics were unable to make their mark in the 1954 NBA Playoffs, 1955 NBA Playoffs, and 1956 NBA Playoffs, where they lost three times in a row against the Nationals. Cousy attributed the shortcomings to fatigue, stating: &quot;We would get tired in the end and could not get the ball&quot;. As a result, Auerbach sought a defensive center who could get easy rebounds, initiate fast breaks and close out games.

====Celtics dynasty years (1957–1963)====

Before the 1956–57 NBA season, Auerbach drafted two future Hall-of-Famers: forward Tom Heinsohn, and defensive center Bill Russell. Powered by these new players, the Celtics went 44–28 in the regular season, and Cousy averaged 20.6 points, 4.8 rebounds and a league-leading 7.5 assists, earning his first NBA Most Valuable Player Award; he also won his second NBA All-Star Game MVP award. The Celtics reached the 1957 NBA Finals, and powered by Cousy on offense and rugged center Russell on defense, they beat the Hawks 4–3, who were noted for future Hall-of-Fame power forward Bob Pettit and former teammates Macauley and Hagan. Cousy finally won his first title.

In the 1957–58 NBA season, Cousy had yet another highly productive year, with his 20.0 points, 5.5 rebounds and 8.6 assists per game leading to nominations into the All-NBA First Team and the All-Star team. He again led the NBA in assists. The Celtics reached the 1958 NBA Finals against the Hawks, but when Russell succumbed to a foot injury in Game 3, the Celtics faded and bowed out four games to two. This was the last losing NBA playoff series in which Cousy would play.

In the following 1958–59 NBA season, the Celtics got revenge on their opposition, powered by an inspired Cousy, who averaged 20.0 points, 5.5 rebounds and a league-high 8.6 assists a game, won another assists title and another pair of All-NBA First Team and All-Star team nominations. Late in the season, Cousy reasserted his playmaking dominance by setting an NBA record with 28 assists in a game against the Minneapolis Lakers. While that record was broken 19 years later, Cousy also set a record for 19 assists in a half which has never been broken. The Celtics stormed through the playoffs and, behind Cousy&#x27;s 51 total assists (still a record for a four-game NBA Finals series), defeated the Minneapolis Lakers in the first 4–0 sweep ever in the 1959 NBA Finals.

In the 1959–60 NBA season, Cousy was again productive, his 19.4 points, 4.7 rebounds and 9.5 assists per game earning him his eighth consecutive assists title and another joint All-NBA First Team and All-Star team nomination. Again, the Celtics defeated all opposition and won the 1960 NBA Finals 4–3 against the Hawks. A year later, the 32-year-old Cousy scored 18.1 points, 4.4 rebounds and 7.7 assists per game, winning another pair of All-NBA First Team and All-Star nominations, but failing to win the assists crown after eight consecutive seasons. However, the Celtics won the 1961 NBA Finals after convincingly beating the Hawks 4–1.

In the 1961–62 NBA season, the aging Cousy slowly began to fade statistically, averaging 15.7 points, 3.5 rebounds and 7.8 assists, and was voted into the All-NBA Second Team after ten consecutive First Team nominations. Still, he enjoyed a satisfying postseason, winning the 1962 NBA Finals after 4–3 battles against two upcoming teams, the Philadelphia Warriors and Los Angeles Lakers. The Finals series against the Lakers was especially dramatic, because Lakers guard Frank Selvy failed to make a last-second buzzer beater in Game 7 which would have won the title. Finally, in the 1962–63 NBA season, the last of his career, Cousy averaged 13.2 points, 2.5 rebounds and 6.8 assists, and collected one last All-Star and All-NBA Second Team nomination. In the 1963 NBA Finals, the Celtics again won 4–2 against the Lakers, and Cousy finished his career on a high note: in the fourth quarter of Game 6, Cousy sprained an ankle and had to be helped to the bench. He went back in with Boston up 1. Although he did not score again, he was credited with providing an emotional lift that carried the Celtics to victory, 112–109. The game ended with Cousy throwing the ball into the rafters.

===Retirement===
At age 34, Cousy held his retirement ceremony on March 17, 1963, in a packed Boston Garden. The event became known as the Boston Tear Party, when the crowd&#x27;s response overwhelmed Cousy, left him speechless, and caused his planned 7-minute farewell to go on for 20. Joe Dillon, a water worker from South Boston, Massachusetts, and a devoted Celtics fan, screamed &quot;We love ya, Cooz&quot;, breaking the tension and the crowd went into cheers. As a testament to Cousy&#x27;s legacy, President John F. Kennedy wired to Cousy: &quot;The game bears the indelible stamp of your rare skills and competitive daring, and it will serve as a living reminder of your long and illustrious career so long as it is played.&quot;

===Cincinnati Royals (1969–1970)===
During the 1969–70 NBA season, the then 41-year-old Cousy, who was also the head coach for the Royals, made a late-season comeback as a player for seven games. Cousy averaged 0.7 points per game for the now Sacramento Kings.

==Coaching career==
===Boston College (1963–1969)===
After retiring as a player, Cousy published his autobiography &quot;Basketball Is My Life&quot; in 1963, and in the same year became coach at Boston College. In the 1965 ECAC Holiday Basketball Festival at Madison Square Garden, Providence defeated Boston College 91–86 in the title game, when the Friars were led by Tourney MVP and All-American Jimmy Walker. Providence was coached by Joe Mullaney, who was Cousy&#x27;s teammate at Holy Cross when the two men were players there in 1947. In his six seasons there, he had a record of 114 wins and 38 losses and was named New England Coach of the Year for 1968 and 1969. Cousy led the Eagles to three NIT appearances, including a berth in the 1969 NIT Championship and two National Collegiate Athletic Association tournaments, including the 1967 Eastern Regional Finals.

===Cincinnati Royals / Kansas City-Omaha Kings (1969–1973)===
Cousy grew bored with college basketball and returned to the NBA as coach of the Cincinnati Royals, team of fellow Hall-of-Fame point guard Oscar Robertson. He later said about this engagement, &quot;I did it for the money. I was made an offer I couldn&#x27;t refuse.&quot; He continued as coach of the team after it moved from Cincinnati to Kansas City-Omaha, but stepped down as the Kings&#x27; coach early in the 1973–74 NBA season with a 141–209 record.

==Legacy==
In 1954, the NBA had no health benefits, pension plan, minimum salary, and the average player&#x27;s salary was $8,000 ($82,000 in 2021 dollars) a season. To combat this, Cousy organized the National Basketball Players Association, the first trade union among those in the four major North American professional sports leagues. Cousy served as its first president until 1958.

In his 13-year, 924-game NBA playing career, Cousy finished with 16,960 points, 4,786 rebounds and 6,955 assists, translating to averages of 18.4 points, 5.2 rebounds and 7.5 assists per game. He was regarded as the first great point guard of the NBA, winning eight of the first 11 assist titles in the league, all of them en bloc, and had a highly successful career, winning six NBA titles, one MVP award, 13 All-Star and 12 All-NBA First and Second Team call-ups and two All-Star MVP awards. With his eye-catching dribbling and unorthodox passing, Cousy popularized modern guard play and raised the profile of the Boston Celtics and the entire NBA. His fast-paced playing style was later emulated by the likes of Pete Maravich and Magic Johnson.

In recognition of his feats, Cousy was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1971 and in 1963, the Celtics retired his uniform number, 14, the first of two numbers retired (the other was Ed Macauley&#x27;s number 22). Celtics owner Walter Brown said: &quot;The Celtics wouldn&#x27;t be here without him [Cousy]. He made basketball in this town. If he had played in New York he would have been the biggest thing since [New York Yankees baseball legend] Babe Ruth. I think he is anyway.&quot; In addition, on May 11, 2006, ESPN.com rated Cousy as the fifth-greatest point guard of all time, lauding him as &quot;ahead of his time with his ballhandling and passing skills&quot; and pointing out he is one of only seven point guards ever to win an NBA Most Valuable Player award.

On November 16, 2008, Cousy&#x27;s college uniform number, 17, was hoisted to the Hart Center rafters. During halftime of a game between the Holy Cross Crusaders and St. Joseph&#x27;s Hawks, the uniform numbers of Cousy, George Kaftan, Togo Palazzi, and Tommy Heinsohn became the first to hang from the gymnasium&#x27;s ceiling.

On July 1, 2019, Cousy informed &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; that he had received an official letter notifying him that he would receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Donald Trump on August 22, 2019. He received the medal at a ceremony in the Oval Office. A statue of Cousy was installed outside the DCU Center in Worcester, Massachusetts (the current home venue of the Holy Cross basketball program). The statue of Cousy was dedicated in June 2021.

Cousy has been the recipient of several basketball awards being named after him. The Bob Cousy Award has been presented annually since 2004 by the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame to the top men&#x27;s collegiate point guard. In 2022, the NBA renamed its Eastern Conference championship trophy in honor of Cousy.

After the death of Bob Harrison in March 2024, Cousy is now the oldest living NBA champion.

==Off the court==
===Soccer league commissioner===
Despite his unfamiliarity with the sport, Cousy was appointed Commissioner of the American Soccer League on December 19, 1974. His most notable act as commissioner was to declare the New York Apollo and Boston Astros co-champions after both teams played 67 minutes of extra time without resolution in the second and deciding leg of the league&#x27;s championship series on September 20, 1975. He was relieved of his duties on December 1, 1979. Pennsylvania Stoners club owner Willie Ehrlich explained the dismissal by stating, &quot;After five years as commissioner, Cousy still goes around telling people he knows nothing about soccer.&quot;

===Personal life===
Cousy married his college sweetheart, Missie Ritterbusch, in December 1950, six months after he graduated from Holy Cross. They lived in Worcester, Massachusetts, and had two daughters. His wife died on September 20, 2013, after suffering from dementia for several years.

Cousy was well-known, both on and off the court, for his public stance against racism, a result of his upbringing in a multicultural environment. In 1950, the Celtics played a game in the then-segregated city of Charlotte, North Carolina, and teammate Chuck Cooper—the first African-American in NBA history to be drafted—would have been denied a hotel room. Instead of taking the hotel room, Cousy insisted on travelling with Cooper on an uncomfortable overnight train. He described their visit to a segregated men&#x27;s toilet—Cooper was prohibited from using the clean &quot;for whites&quot; bathroom and had to use the shabby &quot;for colored&quot; facility—as one of the most shameful experiences of his life. He also sympathized with the plight of black Celtics star Bill Russell, who was frequently a victim of racism.

He was close to his Celtics mentor, head coach Red Auerbach, and was one of the few permitted to call him &quot;Arnold,&quot; his given name, instead of his nickname &quot;Red&quot;.

He was a color analyst on Celtics telecasts during the 1980s.&quot; In addition, he had a role in the 1994 basketball film &quot;Blue Chips&quot;, in which he played a college athletic director.

He is currently a marketing consultant for the Celtics, and occasionally makes broadcast appearances with Mike Gorman (and with ex-Celtic teammate Tom Heinsohn prior to Heinsohn&#x27;s death on November 9, 2020).

<text>Yuri Petrovich Artyukhin (; 22 June 1930 – 4 August 1998) was a Soviet Russian cosmonaut and engineer who made a single flight into space.

Artyukhin graduated from the Soviet Air Force Institute with a doctorate in engineering, specializing in military communication systems. He was selected for the space programme in 1963 and would have flown on the Voskhod 3 mission had it not been canceled. He made his single flight on Soyuz 14 in 1974, where his area of expertise was presumably put to good use.

He left the space programme in 1982 and held various positions in space-related fields. Most notably, he was involved in the development of the Soviet space shuttle Buran and in cosmonaut training.

He died of cancer on 4 August 1998.

He was awarded:
*Hero of the Soviet Union
*Pilot-Cosmonaut of the USSR
*Order of Lenin
*Order of the Red Star
*Medal &quot;For Distinction in Guarding the State Border of the USSR&quot;
*Jan Krasicki Cross (Poland)

<text>Maude is an American television sitcom that was originally broadcast on the CBS network from September 12, 1972, until April 22, 1978. The show was the first spin-off of &quot;All in the Family&quot;, on which Bea Arthur had made two appearances as Maude Findlay, Edith Bunker&#x27;s favorite cousin. Like &quot;All in the Family&quot;, &quot;Maude&quot; was a sitcom with topical storylines created by producers Norman Lear and Bud Yorkin.

&quot;Maude&quot; stars Bea Arthur as Maude, an outspoken, middle-aged, politically liberal woman living in suburban Tuckahoe, New York with her fourth husband, household appliance store owner Walter Findlay (Bill Macy). Maude embraces the tenets of women&#x27;s liberation, always votes for Democratic Party candidates, and advocates for civil rights and racial and gender equality. Her overbearing and sometimes domineering personality often gets her into trouble when speaking about these issues.

Unusually for an American sitcom, several episodes (such as &quot;Maude&#x27;s Night Out&quot; and &quot;The Convention&quot;) featured only the characters of Maude and her husband Walter, in what amounted to half-hour &quot;two-hander&quot; teleplays. In the season four episode &quot;The Analyst&quot; (sometimes referred to as &quot;Maude Bares Her Soul&quot;), Arthur as Maude, speaking to an unseen psychiatrist, was the sole actor on screen for the entire episode.

The show&#x27;s theme song, &quot;And Then There&#x27;s Maude&quot;, was written by Alan and Marilyn Bergman and Dave Grusin, and performed by Donny Hathaway.

== Characters ==
Maude first appears in two season-two episodes of &quot;All in the Family&quot;: the first in December 1971 as a visitor to the Bunker home, and the second, a backdoor pilot setting up the premise of the &quot;Maude&quot; series, in March 1972. She is Edith Bunker&#x27;s (Jean Stapleton) favorite cousin who has been married four times. Her first husband, Barney, died shortly after their marriage. She divorced the next two, Albert and Chester. Albert was never portrayed on screen, but the episode &quot;Poor Albert&quot; revolved around his death, while her second former husband Chester appeared once on the show, played by Martin Balsam.

Her fourth and current husband, Walter Findlay (played by Bill Macy), owns an appliance store called Findlay&#x27;s Friendly Appliances. Maude and Walter met just before the 1968 presidential election. Maude sometimes gets in the last word during their many arguments with her hallmark catchphrase, &quot;God&#x27;ll get you for that, Walter&quot;, which came directly from Bea Arthur. Maude&#x27;s deep, raspy voice is also an occasional comic foil whenever she answers the phone and explaining in one episode, &quot;No, this is not Mr. Findlay; this is Mrs. Findlay! Mr. Findlay has a much higher voice.&quot;

Maude&#x27;s daughter, Carol Traynor, played by Adrienne Barbeau – in the &quot;All in the Family&quot; pilot episode the character was played by Marcia Rodd – is also divorced and has one child, like Maude. Carol and her son, Phillip (played by Brian Morrison in seasons 1-5 and by Kraig Metzinger in the sixth), live with the Findlays. Though single, Carol maintains her reputation of dating many men.

She dates various men throughout the early seasons, later forming a serious relationship with a man named Chris (played by Fred Grandy). Grandy left at the end of the second season. Like her mother, Carol is an outspoken liberal feminist who is not afraid to speak her mind, though they often clash. There are conflicting accounts as to whether Carol&#x27;s father was Maude&#x27;s first or second husband. In the series&#x27; first episode, &quot;Maude&#x27;s Problem&quot;, Maude reveals to Carol&#x27;s psychiatrist that Carol&#x27;s father was her second husband.
The Findlays&#x27; next-door neighbors are Dr. Arthur Harmon (Conrad Bain), a stuffy, sardonic Republican, and his sweet but scatterbrained second wife Vivian (Rue McClanahan). McClanahan confirmed in an interview with the Archive of American Television that she was approached by Norman Lear during the taping of the &quot;All in the Family&quot; episode &quot;The Bunkers and the Swingers&quot; (1972) to take on the role as a late replacement for Doris Roberts, the original choice for the part.

Arthur has been Walter&#x27;s best friend since the two served together in World War II. He was the one who brought Walter and Maude together in 1968 and &quot;affectionately&quot; calls Maude &quot;Maudie.&quot; Vivian and Maude have been best friends since college. At the beginning of the series, Arthur is a widower. Vivian is introduced in a guest appearance that focused on her split with her first husband. She later got involved with Arthur as a divorcée.

=== The housekeepers ===

For the entire run of the show, Maude also has a housekeeper. At the beginning of the series, Maude hires Florida Evans (Esther Rolle), a no-nonsense Black woman who often has the last laugh at Maude&#x27;s expense. Maude often makes a point of conspicuously and awkwardly demonstrating how open-minded and liberal she is. Florida almost quits because of this. Despite Florida&#x27;s status as a maid, Maude emphasizes to Florida that they are &quot;equals,&quot; and insists she enter and exit the house via the front door, even though the back door is more convenient for Florida.
Rolle&#x27;s character was so popular that, in 1974, she became the star of her own series, &quot;Good Times&quot;. In the second-season episode titled &quot;Florida&#x27;s Goodbye&quot;, Florida&#x27;s husband Henry (John Amos) gets a promotion at his job, and Florida quits to become a full-time housewife. Whereas &quot;Maude&quot; took place in New York, &quot;Good Times&quot; took place in Chicago, with numerous other differences in Florida&#x27;s situation, such as her husband being called James Evans – &quot;Henry&quot; being the name of James&#x27;s long-lost father.

After Florida&#x27;s departure in 1974, Maude hires a new housekeeper, Mrs. Nell Naugatuck (Hermione Baddeley), an elderly, somewhat vulgar, British widow who drinks excessively and lies compulsively. Unlike Florida, who commuted to work, Mrs. Naugatuck lives with the Findlays. She meets and begins dating Bert Beasley (J. Pat O&#x27;Malley), an elderly cemetery security guard, in 1975. In 1977, they marry and move to Ireland to care for Bert&#x27;s mother. Mrs. Naugatuck&#x27;s frequent sparring with Maude is, arguably, just as comically popular as Florida&#x27;s sparring. The difference is that Mrs. Naugatuck often seems to dislike Maude, whereas Florida, on occasion, finds Maude frustrating.

Lear said the last name &quot;Naugatuck&quot; was taken directly from the town of Naugatuck, Connecticut, which he found amusing. Due to the popularity of &quot;Maude&quot;, Baddeley visited the town in the late 1970s and was given a warm, official welcome ceremony at the town green.

Maude then hires Victoria Butterfield (Marlene Warfield), a native of Saint Norman (perhaps a nod to Norman Island in the British Virgin Islands) in the West Indies, whom Maude initially accuses of stealing her wallet on the subway. Victoria remains until the end of the series in 1978. The character of Victoria was never as popular as her two predecessors, and she was seen only sporadically and was not credited as a series regular.

== Series history, topicality, and controversy ==
The character of Maude Findlay was loosely based on creator Norman Lear&#x27;s then-wife Frances. She first appeared on two episodes of &quot;All in the Family&quot; as Edith Bunker&#x27;s cousin. A &quot;Cousin Maud,&quot; with a similar role, had also appeared on an episode of &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot;, the British series on which &quot;All in the Family&quot; had been based. Maude represented everything Archie Bunker did not: she was a liberal, feminist, upper-middle-class Democrat, whereas Archie was a conservative, prejudiced, working-class Republican.

Maude&#x27;s political beliefs were closer to those of the series creators than Archie Bunker&#x27;s, but the series often lampooned Maude as a naive &quot;limousine liberal&quot;. They did not show her beliefs and attitudes in an entirely complimentary light. Just before the show&#x27;s premiere in September 1972, &quot;TV Guide&quot; described the character of Maude as &quot;a caricature of the knee-jerk liberal.&quot;

While the show was conceived as a comedy, the scripts also incorporated much darker humor, drama and controversy. Maude took Miltown, a mild tranquilizer, and also Valium; she and her husband Walter began drinking in the evening. Maude had an abortion in November 1972, two months before the &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; decision made abortion legal throughout the U.S., and the episodes that dealt with the situation are probably the series&#x27; most famous and most controversial. Maude, at age 47, was dismayed to find herself unexpectedly pregnant. Her daughter Carol brought to her attention that abortion had become legal in the state of New York.

After some soul-searching, and discussions with Walter, who agreed that raising a baby at their stage of life was not what they wanted to do, Maude decided at the end of the two-part episode that abortion was probably the best choice for their lives and their marriage. Noticing the controversy around the storyline, CBS decided to rerun the episodes in August 1973, and members of the country&#x27;s clergy reacted strongly to the decision. Thirty-nine stations pre-empted the episode. The two-part episode was written by Susan Harris, who would work with Bea Arthur again later on &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;.

The producers and the writers of the show tackled other controversies. In a story arc that opened the 1973–74 season, Walter came to grips with his alcoholism and subsequently had a nervous breakdown. The beginning of the story arc had Maude, Walter, and Arthur enjoying a night of revelry. However, Maude panicked when she awoke the following morning to find Arthur in her bed. This alarmed her to the point that both of them swore off alcohol entirely. Walter could not do it (&quot;Dean Martin gets a million dollars for his buzz&quot;) and became so frustrated during his attempts to stop that he struck Maude. Afterward, he suffered a breakdown as a result of his alcoholism and guilt over the domestic violence incident. The arc, which played out in two parts, was typically controversial for the show but gained praise for highlighting how social drinking can lead to alcoholism.

The first-season episode &quot;The Grass Story&quot; tackled the then-recent Rockefeller Drug Laws, as Maude and her well-meaning housewife friends try to get arrested in protest over a grocery boy&#x27;s tough conviction for marijuana possession. The severity of the marijuana laws contrasted with the characters&#x27; lax attitudes toward drinking and prescription pill abuse.

In season four, Maude had a session with an analyst, in which she revealed insecurities about her life and marriage and talked through memories from her childhood. The episode was a solo performance by Beatrice Arthur.

During the fifth season, Walter suffered another nervous breakdown, this time even attempting suicide, when he saw his business go bankrupt.

The Nielsen ratings for &quot;Maude&quot; were high, in particular, during the first seasons of the program, during the heyday of topical sitcoms, which its presence helped to create, when it was regularly one of the top-ten highest-rated American television programs in any given week.

In Great Britain, &quot;Maude&quot; was not shown nationally. It was shown beginning in 1975 in the ITV regions of Scottish, Westward, Border, Tyne Tees, Anglia, Yorkshire, Granada and Channel. Satellite station Sky One ran the series in the early/mid-1990s.

== Series ending ==

In the fifth season, &quot;Maude&quot; dropped from No. 4 to No. 31 in the Nielsen ratings as its lead-ins &quot;Rhoda&quot; and &quot;Phyllis&quot; began to struggle. Public taste had abruptly shifted from &quot;relevant&quot; Norman Lear productions and the MTM company&#x27;s sophisticated comedies toward escapist fare like ABC&#x27;s &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot; and &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;. In the sixth season, ratings dived further, and Lear revamped the format. In the last three episodes of that season, the fictional governor of New York appointed Maude as a congresswoman from Tuckahoe, as a Democrat during the 1978 U.S. midterm elections. She helped campaign for a congresswoman who unexpectedly died in her home. Maude and husband Walter moved to Washington, D.C., and the rest of the regular cast would be written out of the show in a prospective season seven.

In spring 1978, Bea Arthur said she would leave the series. At least one TV columnist reported that CBS had already decided to cancel the show because of low ratings, and Arthur&#x27;s announcement was an attempt to save face. Lear still liked the concept of a member of a minority group in Congress, and it evolved into the pilot &quot;Mr. Dugan&quot;, with Cleavon Little replacing Arthur as the lead character. The show was scheduled for a March 1979 premiere, but negative feedback from black members of Congress, granted an advance screening, resulted in CBS deciding not to air the three episodes taped. Lear reworked the project into &quot;Hanging In&quot;, with Bill Macy playing a former professional football player turned university president. Hanging In premiered in the summer of 1979 but was canceled after four episodes.

<text>Whangārei () is the northernmost city in New Zealand and the largest settlement of the Northland region. It is part of the Whangarei District, created in 1989 from the former Whangarei City, Whangarei County and Hikurangi Town councils to administer both the city and its hinterland. The city population was estimated to be an increase from 47,000 in 2001.

==Etymology==

The origin of the name Whangārei is unclear, as a number of (Māori traditional stories) are associated with the harbour. One major tradition involves the sisters Reitū and Reipae of the &quot;Tainui&quot; migratory waka, who either flew from the Waikato north on the backs of birds, or in the form of birds.

Other traditions describe the meaning of Whangārei as &quot;lying in wait to ambush&quot;, referring to warriors watching over the harbour from Te Tihi-o-Kahukura / Castle Rock, or Whangārei meaning &quot;to gather&quot;, referring to the harbour as a gathering place for whales or for important rangatira.

==History==

The harbour is known from traditional histories as a landing point for many of the migratory waka which reached New Zealand, including &quot;Tūnui-ā-rangi&quot; and &quot;Te Arawa&quot;. Many stories involving the Whangārei Harbour involve the legendary chief Manaia. Whangārei was traditionally an important location for trade during much of pre-European Māori history, linking the Muriwhenua iwi of the far north, the residents of the Hauraki Gulf islands, and Tāmaki Māori iwi to the south. An overland route, the Mangapai portage, allowed waka to be hauled between the Whangārei Harbour in the east, and the Wairoa River and Kaipara Harbour to the west along the Mangapai River.

A number of Māori iwi are associated with the early history of Whangārei, including Ngare Raumati, Ngāi Tāhuhu, Ngātiwai and Te Parawhau. In the late 18th century, Ngāpuhi expanded south into the Whangārei area.

Captain James Cook and the crew of the &quot;Endeavour&quot; were the first Europeans to sight the Whangārei Harbour entrance. On 15 November 1769 they caught about a hundred fish in the harbour, which they classified as &quot;bream&quot; (probably snapper), prompting Cook to name the area Bream Bay. In the early 19th century, when Europeans began visiting the harbour more regularly, Ngāpuhi occupied Whangārei, and the Te Parawhau hapū lived at the head of the harbour.

In the 1820s, the area was repeatedly attacked by Waikato and Ngāti Paoa raiders during the Musket Wars. The first European settler was William Carruth, a Scotsman and trader, who arrived in 1839 and was joined six years later by Gilbert Mair and his family. Relations between the settlers and local Māori were generally friendly, but in February 1842, all settler farms were plundered in revenge for transgressions of tapu. In April 1845, during the Flagstaff War, all settlers fled from Whangārei. Most of the original settlers never returned, but by the mid-1850s there were a number of farmers and orchardists in the area. From 1855, a small town developed, driven by the kauri gum trade. Today&#x27;s &#x27;Town Basin&#x27; on the Hatea River was the original port. Early exports included kauri gum and native timber, followed later by coal from Whau Valley, Kamo, and Hikurangi. Coal from the Kiripaka field was exported via the Ngunguru River. By 1864, the nucleus of the present city was established.

Fire bricks made from fire clay deposits near the Kamo mines supported a brickworks over several decades. Good quality limestone was quarried at Hikurangi, Portland and Limestone Island, and initially sold as agricultural lime, and later combined with local coal to produce Portland cement at the settlement of Portland on the south side of the harbour. Local limestone is still used in cement manufacture, but the coal is now imported from the West Coast of the South Island.

Whangārei was the most urbanised area in Northland towards the end of the 19th century, but grew slowly in the 20th century. The district slowly exhausted most of its natural resources but was sustained by agriculture, especially dairying. Shipping was the main transport link until the North Auckland railway line reached the town in 1925, and the road from Auckland was not suitable for travel in poor weather until 1934. These terrestrial travel routes forced a rapid decline in coastal shipping but stimulated Whangārei to become the service centre for Northland. The population was 14,000 in 1945, but grew rapidly in the 1960s, incorporating Kamo and other outlying areas. In 1964, Whangārei was declared a city. Its population the following year was 31,000.

The second half of the twentieth century brought the establishment and expansion of the oil refinery at Marsden Point on Bream Bay, the adjacent development of timber processing and the establishment of Northland Port, which is mainly focused on timber exporting.

Building of the Hundertwasser Art Centre with Wairau Māori Art Gallery commenced in 2018 after the funding target of $20.97 million was raised by a volunteer team in time for a June 2017 deadline, and the centre opened in February of 2022.

===Future===
A container port could follow, linked by rail to Auckland. The extensive, flat undeveloped land around Northport is a suggested solution to excess population growth in Auckland and the associated lack of industrial land.

==Geography==
===Geographical features===

Mount Parihaka is a volcanic dome rising to the northeast of the city centre and part of the Whangārei volcanic field. It is about 20 million years old, and aligns with the Harbour Fault, which also aligns with the volcanoes of Parakiore near Kamo, and Hikurangi near the town of the same name. The dome is surrounded by the Parihaka Scenic Reserve. There is road access to the summit of Parihaka and walking tracks through the reserve, and a bridge linking it to Mair Park. The dome is frequently called Mount Parahaki, but the original Māori spelling of Parihaka was confirmed by the government in 2005.

The Hatea River flows south through the city and empties into Whangārei Harbour. The river has a spectacular waterfall in Tikipunga, north of the city.

Matakohe, or Limestone Island, lies in the harbour close to the city. Owned by Whangarei District, it is subject to ecological island restoration by the Friends of Matakohe/Limestone Island Society.

===Suburbs===

Whangārei Central is the main business district. The city&#x27;s urban area spreads through the valleys of the surrounding area. The suburbs are:

Whangārei has an oceanic climate (Köppen &quot;Cfb&quot;). The climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows. Summer days occasionally exceed 30 °C, and there is plentiful rainfall spread relatively evenly throughout the year.

=== Local ===
At a local level, Whangārei comes under the Northland Regional Council, of which the city is the seat.

Whangārei is governed locally by the Whangarei District Council. The city is split into two of the council wards, Denby, which takes the northern suburbs, and Okara, which takes the southern half of the city.

Whangārei is covered by the Northland Police District, which is split into two areas, Whangārei/Kaipara and Mid/Far North.

Judicially, the town is served by the Whangarei District Court and is also the base of the region&#x27;s only High Court.

==Transport==
State Highway 1 from Auckland to Cape Reinga passes through Whangārei. State Highway 14 from Dargaville connects to State Highway 1 in Whangārei.

Whangārei Airport is located southeast of the city centre, in the suburb of Onerahi.

In July 2013, a second road crossing of the Hatea River was opened, in the form of a bascule bridge.

There are several cycle/walk ways under development connecting the city centre with the outer suburbs. These include Kamo (currently under construction), Onerahi (completed) and Raumanga/Maunu (several sections completed). The Hatea Loop (Huarahi o te Whai) is a central mixed space walkway connecting the Town Basin, Hihiaua Peninsula, Okara, Pohe Island and Riverside areas of the central city.

Whangārei is served by Northport, a seaport at Marsden Point. It was previously served by Port Whangārei, in the upper harbour near the city, which was operated by the Northland Harbour Board until 1988, when it was transferred to the Northland Port Corporation. The first two berths at Marsden Point opened in 2002, and Port Whangārei closed to commercial shipping in 2007 when the remaining cargo operations were transferred to Marsden Point.

<text>Sharif Ali bin al-Hussein (; 1956 – 14 March 2022) was the leader of the Iraqi Constitutional Monarchy political party and claimed to be the legitimate heir to the position of King of Iraq, based on his relationship to the last monarch, the late King Faisal II.

== Early life ==
After the loss of Mecca, Sharif Ali&#x27;s parents settled in Iraq where his mother&#x27;s Badiya sister, Aliya bint Ali, was queen consort. He was born in Iraq and his maternal first cousin was Faisal II of Iraq, the last king of Iraq, his maternal grandfather was Ali bin Hussein, last King of Hejaz, and his paternal grandfather was the uncle of both Faisal I of Iraq and Ali bin Hussein. &#x27;Abd al-Ilah was his uncle.

On 14 July 1958, when Colonel Abdul Karim Qassim took control of the Kingdom of Iraq by a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;, the royal family was ordered to leave the palace in Baghdad: King Faisal II; Crown Prince &#x27;Abd al-Ilah; Princess Hiyam, Abdul Ilah&#x27;s wife; Princess Nafissa, Abdul Ilah&#x27;s mother; Princess Abdiya, the king&#x27;s maternal aunt; and several servants. When they all arrived in the courtyard, they were told to turn towards the palace wall, and they were all shot down by Captain Abdus Sattar As Sab’, a member of the coup led by Colonel Abd al-Karim Qasim. Nuri as-Said, the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Iraq, was killed by supporters of Colonel Abd al-Karim Qasim on 15 July 1958.

Ali bin al-Hussein&#x27;s mother Princess Badia (1920-2020), her husband Sharif al-Hussein bin Ali, and their three children spent a month in the embassy of Saudi Arabia in Baghdad. The coup leaders insisted that they leave Iraq and travel to Egypt on ordinary passports. They lived for a while in Lebanon and finally in London, where Ali bin al-Hussein built up a successful career in investment banking.

== Education ==
Ali bin al-Hussein earned his high school diploma from Brummana High School in Lebanon, a BA in Economics from the Trent Polytechnic Nottingham, and an MA in Economics from the University of Essex.

== Political movement ==
Ali bin Al-Hussein remained an opponent of the rule of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. In 1991, he quit his job managing investment funds and became a member of the Iraqi National Congress, which had the purpose of fomenting the overthrow of Hussein.

On 28 October 2003, representing the Iraqi National Conference Bloc, Sharif Ali Bin al-Hussein met Syria&#x27;s Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa in Damascus. They agreed on viewpoints that included ending the occupation and forming an Iraqi government in a way that both satisfied the Iraqi people&#x27;s aspirations and maintained Iraqi unity.

He had close ties to the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.

== Death ==
Sharif Ali died in Amman, Jordan on 14 March 2022, at the age of 65. He is survived by his son Faisal.

== Awards ==
* He was awarded the Royal Order of the Drum by the late Kigeli V, the former King of Rwanda, for his goal of establishing a way out of Iraq&#x27;s political crisis and of ending the tragic ordeal of a people who lived under terror and tyranny.

== Quotes ==
* &quot;It would have been the perfect transition from dictatorship to democracy,&quot; he said. &quot;It would have been a way to unite the country around a figure whose history transcended sect and ethnicity.&quot; In 2003, Sharif Ali bin al-Hussein said, he pressed American officials to bring him in as soon as Saddam Hussein fell.
* &quot;I don&#x27;t believe there is a military solution right now in Iraq for either side, for the Americans or the insurgents,&quot; he said. &quot;We must start with negotiations.&quot;
*&quot;There is no risk of a breakup of Iraq. There is no risk of a civil war.&quot;

<text>The Northland region (), officially Northland Region, is the northernmost of New Zealand&#x27;s 16 local government regions. New Zealanders sometimes refer to it as the Winterless North because of its mild climate all throughout the year. The major population centre is the city of Whangārei, and the largest town is Kerikeri. At the 2018 New Zealand census, Northland recorded a population growth spurt of 18.1% since the previous 2013 census, placing it as the fastest growing region in New Zealand, ahead of other strong growth regions such as the Bay of Plenty region (2nd with 15%) and Waikato (3rd with 13.5%).

==Geography==

The Northland region occupies the northern 80% () of the Northland Peninsula, the southernmost part of which is in the Auckland region. It is bounded to the west by the Tasman Sea, and to the east by the Pacific Ocean. The land is predominantly rolling hill country. Farming and forestry occupy over half of the land and are two of the region&#x27;s main industries.

Although many of the region&#x27;s kauri forests were felled during the 19th century, some areas still exist where this rare giant grows tall. New Zealand&#x27;s largest tree, Tāne Mahuta, stands in the Waipoua Forest south of the Hokianga Harbour. These kauri forests are also home to Te Raupua at , the highest point in the region. Northland has many endemic plant and invertebrate species such as the endangered snail pūpū harakeke (&quot;Placostylus ambagiosus&quot;), stick insects and the Northland green tree gecko (&quot;Naultinus grayii&quot;).

The western coast is dominated by several long straight beaches, the most famous of which is the inaccurately-named 88 km stretch of Ninety Mile Beach in the region&#x27;s far north. The slightly longer Ripiro Beach lies further south. Two large inlets are also located on this coast, the massive Kaipara Harbour in the south, which Northland shares with the Auckland region, and the convoluted inlets of the Hokianga Harbour.

The east coast is more rugged, and is dotted with bays and peninsulas. Several large natural harbours are found on this coast, from Parengarenga close to the region&#x27;s northern tip, then Whangaroa Harbour, and past the famous Bay of Islands down to Whangārei Harbour, on the shores of which is situated the largest population centre. Numerous islands dot this coast, notably the Cavalli Islands, the Hen and Chicken Islands, Aorangaia Island and the Poor Knights Islands.

The northernmost points of the North Island mainland lie at the top of Northland. These include several points often confused in the public mind as being the country&#x27;s northernmost points: Cape Maria van Diemen, Spirits Bay, Cape Reinga, and North Cape. The northernmost point of the North Island is actually the Surville Cliffs, close to North Cape although the northernmost point of the country is further north, in the Kermadec chain of islands. Cape Reinga and Spirits Bay, however, have a symbolic part to play as the end of the country. In Māori mythology, it is from here that the souls of the dead depart on their journey to the afterlife.

==Climate==
Northland has an oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot; in the Köppen climate classification), but a subtropical climate in the Trewartha climate classification, with warm humid summers and mild wet winters. Due to its latitude and low elevation, it has the country&#x27;s highest average annual temperature, although, as with other parts of New Zealand, the weather is changeable. In summer, maximum temperatures range from 22 °C to 26 °C, not often rising above 30 °C. In winter, maximum temperatures vary between 14 °C and 17 °C, while minima vary between 7 °C and 12 °C.

Ground frosts are rare due to the region being encircled by the moderating Pacific and Tasman waters, but light frosts do occur infrequently around Dargaville in the lowlands. The hottest months are January and February. In January 2009, excessive sunlight hours and below-average rainfall resulted in the region being declared a drought zone.

Typical annual rainfall for the region is 1500–2000 mm but varies at different altitudes. Northland has an average of 2000 sunshine hours annually. Winds are predominantly from the southwest. Occasionally in summer, the region experiences stormy conditions from former tropical cyclones, which generally become much weaker once they leave tropical latitudes.

==Government==
The Northland region has been governed by the present Northland Regional Council since 1989. The seat of the council is in Whangārei.

Regional council members represent 8 constituencies: Far North, Bay of Islands-Whangaroa, Mid North, Coastal Central, Coastal South, Whangārei City, Kaipara and Te Raki. 

There are three territorial authorities in the region:
* Far North District Council, based in Kaikohe
* Whangarei District Council, based in the city centre. 
* Kaipara District Council, based in Dargaville

Until 1989 Northland was governed by several councils and an earlier Northland Regional Council known as the Northland United Council. (It had been part of Auckland Province from 1853 until government was centralised in 1876. Long after Auckland Province ceased, the region continued to be known as North Auckland.) In 1989, Kaitaia Borough, Mangonui County, Whangaroa County, Bay of Islands County, Hokianga County, and Kaikohe Borough were amalgamated to become the Far North District. Whangarei City, Whangarei County, and Hikurangi Town Councils became the Whangarei District, with Dargaville Borough and Otamatea County becoming the Kaipara District. The Northland Regional Council became a tier of local government above these territorial authorities.

A proposal to merge the three district councils and the regional council into a unitary authority to be known as the Northland Council was rejected by the Local Government Commission in June 2015.

===Timeline of councillors===

==Demography==
Northland region covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.


Northland region had a population of 194,007 in the 2023 New Zealand census, an increase of 14,931 people (8.3%) since the 2018 census, and an increase of 42,318 people (27.9%) since the 2013 census. There were 95,697 males, 97,776 females and 528 people of other genders in 71,778 dwellings. 2.4% of people identified as LGBTIQ+. The median age was 43.2 years (compared with 38.1 years nationally). There were 38,067 people (19.6%) aged under 15 years, 29,856 (15.4%) aged 15 to 29, 83,790 (43.2%) aged 30 to 64, and 42,288 (21.8%) aged 65 or older.

People could identify as more than one ethnicity. The results were 73.0% European (Pākehā); 37.4% Māori; 4.9% Pasifika; 4.8% Asian; 0.7% Middle Eastern, Latin American and African New Zealanders (MELAA); and 2.3% other, which includes people giving their ethnicity as &quot;New Zealander&quot;. English was spoken by 97.0%, Māori language by 10.1%, Samoan by 0.4% and other languages by 7.1%. No language could be spoken by 1.9% (e.g. too young to talk). New Zealand Sign Language was known by 0.5%. The percentage of people born overseas was 16.9, compared with 28.8% nationally.

Religious affiliations were 31.2% Christian, 0.7% Hindu, 0.2% Islam, 3.8% Māori religious beliefs, 0.5% Buddhist, 0.5% New Age, 0.1% Jewish, and 1.2% other religions. People who answered that they had no religion were 54.2%, and 7.8% of people did not answer the census question.

Of those at least 15 years old, 20,514 (13.2%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, 87,414 (56.1%) had a post-high school certificate or diploma, and 41,562 (26.7%) people exclusively held high school qualifications. The median income was $33,100, compared with $41,500 nationally. 11,367 people (7.3%) earned over $100,000 compared to 12.1% nationally.

Māori refer to Northland – and by extension its Māori people – as Te Taitokerau (the northern tide) and Māori language and traditions are strong there. Major tribal groups include Ngāpuhi, Te Aupōuri, Te Rarawa, Ngāti Kahu, Ngāti Kurī and Ngāti Whātua. Several of these tribes form a loose association known as the Muriwhenua.

Approximately one third of the region&#x27;s population are Māori; the majority of the remainder is of European lineage. Compared to the rest of the country, Pacific Islanders are under-represented in Northland. Although most of the region&#x27;s European population are British (as is true with the rest of the country), certain other ethnicities are represented as well. These include a sizeable Croatian community from the Dargaville area north, particularly around Kaitaia.
=== Urban areas ===
Northland is New Zealand&#x27;s least urbanised region, with 50% of the population of living in urban areas. Whangārei is the largest urban area of Northland, with a population of The region&#x27;s population is largely concentrated along the east coast, due to the west coast being more rugged and less suitable for urbanisation.
==History==

According to Māori legend, the North Island of New Zealand was an enormous fish, caught by the demigod Māui. For this reason, Northland is sometimes referred to as &quot;The tail of the fish&quot;, &quot;Te Hiku o Te Ika&quot;.

Northland iwi claim that Kupe made landfall at the Hokianga (although others claim this was at Taipa) in the northwest of Northland, and thus the region claims that it was the birthplace of New Zealand. Some of the oldest traces of Māori (fishing villages) can be found here.

If the Māori regard the region as the legendary birthplace of the country, there can be no doubt that it was the European starting-point for the modern nation of New Zealand. Traders, whalers and sealers were among the first arrivals, and the gum and timber of the mighty kauri trees brought more colonisers.

In the Bay of Islands, Russell, formerly known as Kororareka, was the first permanent European settlement and Kerikeri contains many historic buildings, including the Stone Store, New Zealand&#x27;s oldest extant building. The nearby settlement of Waitangi was of even more significance, as the signing place of New Zealand&#x27;s founding document, the Treaty of Waitangi between the Māori tribes and the British Crown, on 6 February 1840.

Between 1870 and 1920, the major industry in Northland was kauri gum digging, which by the 1910s was centred around the townships of Ahipara and Houhora.

==Economy==
The subnational gross domestic product (GDP) of Northland was estimated at NZ$7.86 billion in the year to March 2019, 2.6% of New Zealand&#x27;s national GDP. The regional GDP per capita was estimated at $42,104 in 2019, the lowest of all New Zealand regions. In the year to March 2018, primary industries contributed $984 million (13.1%) to the regional GDP, goods-producing industries contributed $1.59 billion (21.2%), service industries contributed $4.30 billion (57.1%), and taxes and duties contributed $645 million (8.6%)
The region&#x27;s economy is based on agriculture (notably beef cattle and sheep), fishing, forestry, and horticulture. Northland has of horticultural land as of 2017. Significant crops include avocadoes, kumara, kiwifruit, citrus fruit and olives.

Extensive forests are a feature of the Northland landscape. For this reason wood and paper manufacturing industries also make a large contribution to the region&#x27;s economy. The railway system, which once ran as far north as Okaihau, has been historically important for the transport of timber to Auckland.

Northland is a favourite tourist destination, especially to the Bay of Islands and the historic town of Kerikeri. Diving and fishing are also popular visitor activities, especially around the Bay of Islands and the Poor Knights Islands.

Northland was formerly home to New Zealand&#x27;s only oil refinery, located in Marsden Point, a town, close to Whangārei across the harbour. New Zealand&#x27;s natural fuel resources in Taranaki account for a little under half of the refinery&#x27;s intake, with the rest coming predominantly from the Middle East. The nearby Marsden A thermal power station originally utilised heavy oil from the refinery for electricity production, but no longer does so.

<text>The Message: The Bible in Contemporary Language (MSG) is a paraphrase of the Bible in contemporary English. Authored by Eugene H. Peterson and published in segments from 1993 to 2002.

A Catholic version, &quot;The Message&quot; &quot;– Catholic / Ecumenical Edition&quot;, was published in 2013.

== Features ==
According to the Introduction to the New Testament of &quot;The Message&quot;, its &quot;contemporary idiom keeps the language of the Message (Bible) current and fresh and understandable&quot;. Peterson notes that in the course of the project, he realized this was exactly what he had been doing in his thirty-five years as a pastor, &quot;always looking for an English way to make the biblical text relevant to the conditions of the people&quot;.

== Translation consultants ==

The publisher states: &quot;Peterson&#x27;s work has been thoroughly reviewed by a team of recognized Old and New Testament scholars to ensure that it is accurate and faithful to the original languages.&quot;

Old Testament team:
* Robert L. Hubbard Jr., North Park Theological Seminary (chair)
* Richard E. Averbeck, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School
* Bryan E. Beyer, Columbia International University
* Lamar E. Cooper Sr., Criswell College
* Peter E. Enns, Eastern University
* Duane A. Garrett, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary
* Donald R. Glenn, Dallas Theological Seminary
* Paul R. House, Beeson Divinity School, Samford University
* V. Philips Long, Regent College
* Tremper Longman, Westmont College
* John N. Oswalt, Asbury Theological Seminary
* Richard L. Pratt Jr., Reformed Theological Seminary, Third Mill Ministries 
* John H. Walton, Wheaton College
* Prescott H. Williams Jr., Austin Presbyterian Theological Seminary
* Marvin R. Wilson, Gordon College

New Testament team:
* William W. Klein, Denver Seminary (chair)
* Darrell L. Bock, Dallas Theological Seminary
* Donald A. Hagner, Fuller Theological Seminary
* Moises Silva, Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary
* Rodney A. Whitacre, Trinity School of Ministry

=== Catholic version ===
Deuterocanonical book translator:
*William Griffin, St. Lawrence Seminary

== Comparison to other translations ==
&quot;The Message&quot; was translated by Peterson from the original languages. It is a highly idiomatic translation, using contemporary slang from the US rather than a more neutral International English, and it falls on the extreme dynamic end of the dynamic and formal equivalence spectrum. Some scholars, like Michael J. Gorman, consider some of Peterson&#x27;s idiomatic renderings unconventional. The work was awarded the Evangelical Christian Publishers Association Gold Medallion in 2003 for being the title retailers prized.

<text>The Second Battle of Panipat was fought on 5 November 1556, between Akbar and the king of Delhi, Hemchandra Vikramaditya, also known as Hemu. Hemchandra had conquered Delhi and Agra a few weeks earlier by defeating Mughal forces under Tardi Beg Khan in the battle of Delhi. He crowned himself Maharaja Vikramaditya at Purana Quila in Delhi. 

On learning of the loss, Akbar and his guardian Bairam Khan marched to reclaim those territories. The two armies clashed at Panipat, not far from the site of the First battle of Panipat of 1526.

During the battle, Hemchandra was wounded by an arrow and fell unconscious. Seeing their leader going down, his army panicked and dispersed. Unconscious and almost dead, Hemu was captured and subsequently beheaded by Bairam Khan after Akbar refused to behead him to assume the title of Ghazi.

==Background==

Humayun, the successor of Babur, the founder of the Mughal Empire, had lost his inheritance when he was chased out of India by Sher Shah Suri, who established the Sur Empire in 1540. Delhi and Agra fell into Sher Shah&#x27;s hands, but he died soon after in 1545 at Kalinjar. He was succeeded by his younger son, Islam Shah Suri, who was a capable ruler. However, upon his death in 1554, the Sur Empire was caught up in a succession battle and was plagued by rebellion and the secession of provinces. Humayun made use of this discord to recapture what was lost and on 23 July 1555, the Mughals defeated Sikandar Shah Suri and finally regained control over Delhi and Agra.

Islam Shah&#x27;s rightful successor, his 12-year-old son, Firoz Khan, had been murdered by his maternal uncle, who had taken the throne as Adil Shah Suri. The new ruler was, however, more interested in the pursuit of pleasure than in the affairs of his state. Those were left mainly to Hemchandra, an old Hindu associate of Sher Shah Suri from Rewari, who had risen from humble circumstances to become both Adil Shah&#x27;s Chief Minister as well as the general of the Suri army. He was in Bengal when Humayun died on 27 January 1556. The Mughal emperor&#x27;s death provided an ideal opportunity for Hemu to defeat the Mughals and reclaim lost territory.

Hemchandra started a rapid march from Bengal and drove the Mughals out of Bayana, Etawah, Bharthana, Bidhuna, Lakhna, Sambhal, Kalpi, and Narnaul. In Agra, the governor evacuated the city and fled without a fight upon hearing of Hemchandra&#x27;s impending invasion. In pursuit of the governor, Hemchandra reached Tughlaqabad, a village just outside Delhi where he ran into the forces of the Mughal governor of Delhi, Tardi Beg Khan, and defeated them in the Battle of Tughlaqabad. He took possession of Delhi after a day&#x27;s battle on 7 October 1556 and claimed royal status assuming the title of Vikramaditya (or &quot;Bikramjit&quot;).

==Prelude==
On hearing the disastrous news from Tughlaqabad, Humayun&#x27;s successor, the 13-year-old Akbar and his guardian, Bairam Khan, soon set off for Delhi. In a stroke of luck, Ali Quli Khan Shaibani (later &quot;Khan-i-Zaman&quot;), who had been sent ahead with a 10,000-strong cavalry force, chanced upon Hemchandra&#x27;s artillery, which was being transported under a weak guard. He could easily capture the entire train of artillery from the Afghans, who abandoned the guns and fled without making a stand. That proved to be a costly loss for Hemu.

On 5 November 1556, the Mughal army met Hemu&#x27;s army at the historic battlefield of Panipat. Akbar and Bairam Khan stayed in the rear, eight miles from the battleground.

==Formation==
The Mughal army was led by Ali Quli Khan Shaibani, with his 10,000 cavalry in the centre, Sikandar Khan Uzbak on the right, and Abdulla Khan Uzbak towards the left. The vanguard was led by Husain Quli Beg and Shah Quli Mahram and included Bairam Khan&#x27;s detachment of Turks.

Hemu&#x27;s army was numerically superior, counting among its ranks a 30,000-strong cavalry force consisting of Afghan horse riders and an elephant contingent numbering 500. Each war elephant was protected by plate armour and mounted by musketeers and crossbowmen. Hemchandra led his army himself into battle atop an elephant named &quot;Hawai&quot;. His left was led by his sister&#x27;s son, Ramya, and the right by Shadi Khan Kakkar. His army was an experienced and confident lot and Hemu had, by this time, been victorious in 22 battles from Bengal to Punjab. In this battle, however, Hemchandra had no artillery.

==Battle==
Hemchandra began the attack himself and loosed his elephants among the right and left wings of the Mughals. Those soldiers who were able to escape the rampage, rather than retreating, chose to veer to the sides and attack the flanks of Hemu&#x27;s cavalry, pelting them with their superior archery. The Mughal centre also advanced and took up a defensive position before a deep ravine. Neither Hemchandra&#x27;s elephant nor his horse units were able to cross the chasm to reach their opponents and were vulnerable to the projectile weapons being fired from the other side. Meanwhile, the Mughal cavalry, on their swift mounts, had made inroads into the Afghan ranks from the flanks and the rear and began targeting the elephants, either slashing at the legs of the great beasts or taking out their riders. Hemchandra pulled back his elephants, and the Afghan attack relented.

Seeing the Afghan attack slackening, Ali Quli Khan led his cavalry out, circling around and falling upon the Afghan centre from the rear. Hemu, monitoring the battlefield from his howdah atop Hawai, immediately hurried to counter this charge. Even after seeing Shadi Khan Kakkar and another of his able lieutenants, Bhagwan Das, go down, he continued to lead counterattacks against the Mughals, running down any who challenged his elephants. It was a desperately contested battle, but the advantage seemed to have tilted in favour of Hemu. Both the wings of the Mughal army had been driven back, and Hemu moved his contingent of war elephants and cavalry forward to crush their centre. It was at this point that Hemchandra, possibly on the cusp of victory, was wounded when he was struck in the eye by a chance Mughal arrow and collapsed unconscious. Seeing him going down triggered a panic in his army which broke formation and fled. The battle was lost; 5,000 dead lay on the field of battle and many more were killed while fleeing.

==Aftermath==
The elephant carrying the unconscious and almost dead Hemchandra was captured after several hours of finishing the battle and led to the Mughal camp. Bairam Khan asked the 13-year-old Akbar to behead Hemchandra. According to Akbar&#x27;s later courtier Abu&#x27;l-Fazl ibn Mubarak, he refused to take the sword to a dead man. However, this is not attested by contemporary writer Muhammad Arif Qandhari (composed Tarikh e Akbari), who mentioned that Akbar followed Bairam Khan&#x27;s advice and himself beheaded Hemchandra and took the title of Ghazi. The account of Akbar&#x27;s refusal to kill Hemu is probably a later invention of his courtiers. Hemchandra&#x27;s head was sent to Kabul to be hanged outside Delhi Darwaja, while his body was gibbeted on a gate in Purana Quila, Delhi, where he had his coronation on 6 October. Several supporters and relatives of Hemchandra were beheaded, and a minaret 
was later erected. The painting of this minarette is one of the popular 56 paintings of Akbar&#x27;s life in his copy of the &quot;Akbarnama&quot;. A memorial for Hemchandra was erected at the spot in Panipat where he was beheaded. It is now known as &quot;Hemu&#x27;s Samadhi Sthal&quot;.

With the passing of Hemchandra, Adil Shah&#x27;s fortunes also took a turn for the worse. He was defeated and killed by Khizr Khan, son of Muhammad Khan Sur of Bengal, in April 1557. The spoils from the battle at Panipat included 120 of Hemu&#x27;s war elephants, whose destructive rampages so impressed the Mughals that the animals soon became an integral part of their military strategies.

<text>Conrad Stafford Bain (February 4, 1923 – January 14, 2013) was a Canadian-American actor. His television credits include a leading role as Phillip Drummond in the sitcom &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; (1978–1986), as Dr. Arthur Harmon on &quot;Maude&quot; (1972–1978), and as Charlie Ross in &quot;Mr. President&quot; (1987–1988).

==Early life==
Conrad Bain was born in Lethbridge, Alberta, the son of Jean Agnes (née Young) and Stafford Harrison Bain, 
who was a wholesaler. He was an identical twin. His twin brother, Bonar Bain, was also an actor. 

Conrad studied at the Banff School of Fine Arts before serving in the Canadian Army during World War II. He later studied in New York at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, graduating in 1948; one of his classmates was comedian Don Rickles. 

Bain became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1946.

==Career==
After a stint at the Stratford Festival in Canada, Bain had further success as a stage actor in the 1956 revival of Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;The Iceman Cometh&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewer noted that his role was &quot;especially well acted.&quot; Bain&#x27;s Broadway theatre credits include &quot;Candide&quot;, &quot;Advise and Consent&quot;, &quot;An Enemy of the People&quot;, &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot;, and &quot;On Borrowed Time&quot;. Off Broadway, he appeared in the original run of &quot;Steambath&quot;. While doing stage work in New York City, Bain also found work on television, appearing in the cult supernatural soap opera &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; as the town innkeeper, Mr. Wells, during seasons 1 and 2. His character was killed off by werewolf Chris Jennings (Don Briscoe).

In the early 1960s, Bain was one of the principal organizers of the Actors Federal Credit Union. In an article in the &quot;Credit Union Times&quot;, he recalled that &quot;the effort grew out of the fact that, at least in the world of financial services, actors and other performers got no respect and, more importantly, no access to credit.&quot;

He wrote:

Bain served as the credit union&#x27;s first president.

In the early 1970s, Bain appeared in New York–based films like &quot;Lovers and Other Strangers&quot; and Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Bananas&quot; before achieving national recognition for his work in television. He is best known for his roles as Dr. Arthur Harmon, Bea Arthur&#x27;s title character&#x27;s conservative nemesis, who married her best friend, Vivian, in &quot;Maude&quot; (1972–78). He then starred in &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; (1978–86) as Park Avenue millionaire Phillip Drummond, who adopted two African-American orphaned boys from Harlem, Willis and Arnold, to live with him and his daughter, Kimberly, and housekeeper, Mrs. Garrett. In 1979, he played Phillip Drummond in an episode of &quot;The Facts of Life&quot;. In 1996, Bain reprised his role of Phillip Drummond alongside Gary Coleman as Arnold Jackson on the series finale of &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;.

==Personal life==
Bain had two sons and a daughter with Monica Sloan (1923–2009), to whom he wed in 1945; they remained married until her death in 2009. Bain&#x27;s identical twin brother was actor Bonar Bain (1923–2005), who once played Arnold Harmon, the twin brother of Conrad&#x27;s &quot;Maude&quot; character, Arthur Harmon.

==Death==
Bain died from a stroke on January 14, 2013, in Livermore, California, at the age of 89. His body was cremated.

<doc id="350800" wikidata="Q868671" url="?curid=350800" title="North Shore, New Zealand">
<text>The North Shore ( or ) is one of the major geographical regions of Auckland, the largest city in New Zealand. The area is defined as the northern shores of the Waitematā Harbour as far north as the Ōkura River.

The North Shore is primarily uplifted Waitemata Group sandstone from the Miocene, and includes the northernmost features of the Auckland volcanic field, such as Lake Pupuke, the oldest known feature of the field. Settled by Tāmaki Māori in the 13th or 14th centuries, the Waitematā Harbour headlands became important places for harvesting seasonal resources and for controlling transportation across the region. European settlers arrived in the North Shore in the 1840s, and by the turn of the 20th century, the inland area has become a hub for fruit growing, while the eastern coast had developed into a tourism destination for Aucklanders.

The North Shore rapidly suburbanised after the construction of the Auckland Harbour Bridge in 1959, and by 1989 the five local authorities in the area amalgamated to create North Shore City, which existed until 2010.

==Definition and etymology==

The name North Shore has been used in English as far back as 1843, and has traditionally been defined as the area north of the Waitematā Harbour as far as Lucas Creek and Ōkura River. Other areas referred to as part of the North Shore include Pāremoremo, Lucas Heights, and Dairy Flat, the latter of which is the home of North Shore Aerodrome. Ōkura and Redvale, rural villages located between metropolitan Auckland and the Hibiscus Coast, are considered a part of the North Shore. Major centres on the North Shore include Albany, Birkenhead, Browns Bay, Devonport, Glenfield, Northcote and Takapuna.

 and are the two most commonly used Māori language names for the North Shore. (&quot;The Greater Lands of Kahu&quot;) name refers to Kahu, the granddaughter of Maki, the namesake ancestor of the iwi Te Kawerau ā Maki. Kahu was among the members of Te Kawerau ā Maki who was based on the North Shore. is a name that has been in use since at least the 1980s, and is found in the names of organisations such as Te Kura Kaupapa Māori o Te Raki Paewhenua, Te Raki Paewhenua Committee, and the health and social service organisation Te Puna Hauora o te Raki Paewhenua.

In the mid-19th century, Māori language texts predominantly use the names Takapuna, or Awataha, to describe the North Shore. Takapuna, a name originally given to a spring at Maungauika / North Head, had gradually grown to refer to the wider southern North Shore area before the early colonial era.

==Geology==
The North Shore is primarily uplifted Waitemata Group sandstone, that was deposited on the sea floor during the Early Miocene, between 22 and 16 million years ago, and uplifted due to tectonic forces. The sedimentary layers of Waitemata sandstone can be clearly seen in the eroding cliff faces of the bays along the Hauraki Gulf. Basement rocks in the area are greywacke and argillite, and a number of the headlands are formed from harder Parnell grit rocks, produced by lahars during the Miocene. The North Shore and wider Rodney area feature small areas of Albany Conglomerate rock.

===Volcanic features===

The North Shore is home to the northernmost features of the Auckland volcanic field. Lake Pupuke, a volcanic maar located in Takapuna, is one of the oldest known features of the Auckland volcanic field, erupting an estimated 193,200 years ago. During the eruption of Lake Pupuke, two lava flows travelled eastwards through the area, burning vegetation and encasing the lower 1–2 metres of the tree trunks in lava. The lava solidified into basalt rock, creating the Takapuna Fossil Forest, which was exposed an estimated 7,000 years ago due to coastal erosion.

There are two volcanic maars found on the eastern coastline of Northcote: Tank Farm, also known as Tuff Crater or , joined to the south by Onepoto (also known as ). Onepoto and Tank Farm erupted an estimated 187,600 and 181,000 years ago respectively.

Three volcanic features can be found at Devonport: Takarunga / Mount Victoria, the highest volcano on the North Shore at , and Maungauika / North Head, the south-east headland of the North Shore located at the mouth of the Waitematā Harbour. The third feature, Takararo / Mount Cambria, was quarried in tis entirety by the 1970s. Of these three features, Maungauika / North Head is significantly older, dated to approximately 87,000 years ago. Takararo / Mount Cambria is estimated to have erupted 43,000 years ago, while Takarunga / Mount Victoria erupted approximately 35,000 years ago.

While not located on the North Shore, the Rangitoto Island, dominates the horizon for many of the bays along the eastern coast. The island is the youngest feature of the field, having erupted around the year 1,500.

==Geography==

The North Shore comprises a large suburban area to the north of downtown Auckland; linked to the rest of the greater Auckland metropolitan area by two harbour bridges – the Auckland Harbour Bridge crosses the inner Waitematā Harbour to the Auckland isthmus and Auckland City Centre, while the Upper Harbour Bridge on State Highway 18 provides a connection to West Auckland, across the Upper Waitematā Harbour.

Three major estuaries of the Waitematā Harbour flow through the North Shore. Oruamo or Hellyers Creek flows through the central west North Shore, separating Glenfield and Beach Haven from Greenhithe in the north-west. Further to the north is Lucas Creek, which separates Greenhithe from Pāremoremo. Shoal Bay is found to the south, which separates Northcote from Takapuna and Devonport in the east. To the east of Shoal Bay is the Devonport peninsula. The southern Devonport peninsula was formerly a presque-isle, only joined to the mainland at Narrow Neck by a small spit, until much of Ngataringa Bay was reclaimed for the Waitemata Golf Course in the 1870s. Traditional histories tell that during king tides, the tombolo was completely submerged.

The highest point on the North Shore is a hill (A9L5) in the Albany hills, which is the origin point of the Ōkura River. The highest point in metropolitan North Shore is an hill (A5X2) to on Pupuke Road in Northcote, referred informally by residents in the early 20th century as Clay Hill. The hill is the location of the Pupuke Road Reservoir and Pump Station.

===Climate===

==Flora==
Prior to human settlement, the inland North Shore area was primarily a northern broadleaf podocarp forest, dominated by kauri, tōtara, mataī, miro, kauri and kahikatea trees. Pōhutukawa trees were a major feature of the coastline. By the 19th century, much of the North Shore primarily scrubland, vegetated by plants such as mānuka, tutu, harakeke flax and ferns.

Some kauri remnant forest remains in areas around Birkenhead, including Kauri Park and Le Roys Bush, while Smiths Bush in the Onewa Domain is a remnant native forest dominated by kahikatea and taraire trees. Fernhill Escarpment in Albany is a remnant forest which had tōtara trees estimated to be 800 years old.

In 1974, Graeme Platt established the first commercial native plant nursery in New Zealand. Many of his plants were local to the Albany area, meaning many native plants across New Zealand planted in the 1970s and 1980s originate from North Shore forests. This includes the tōtara cultivar Aurea, also known by the name Albany Gold.

==History==
===Māori history===
Tāmaki Māori settlement of the Auckland Region began around the 13th or 14th centuries. The Devonport area was one of the earliest settled in the region, known to be settled by Tāmaki Māori ancestor Peretū. Toi-te-huatahi and his followers settled and intermarried with these early peoples. Around the year 1350, the &quot;Tainui&quot; migratory canoe visited the North Shore, stopping at the freshwater spring southwest of Maungauika / North Head, and at the Waiake Lagoon (Deep Creek).

Boat Rock (, &quot;The Rat&#x27;s Tooth&quot;) in the Waitematā Harbour southwest of Birkenhead was a location of great significance to Tāmaki Māori. The rock was the location where Te Arawa chief Kahumatamomoe placed a mauri stone (a stone of religious significance), naming the Waitematā (&quot;The Waters of the Stone&quot;) after the stone.

Over time, many of the early Tāmaki Māori people of the North Shore identified as Ngā Oho. While the poor soils of the central North Shore acted as a barrier to agriculture and settlement, people settled the coastal margins, most notably the volcanic south-east, Long Bay (), Kauri Point in Chatswood, and Tauhinu at Greenhithe. Stonefield gardens were constructed on the volcanic hills to the south-east, where crops such as uwhi yam, Taro and kūmara.

An (traditional path) connected Lucas Creek and the Ōkura River. This was used as a portage, where waka could be hauled overland between the two bodies of water. Numerous archaeological sites are found on the banks of the Lucas Creek and the Ōteha valley, because of its importance as a transportation node. Similar portages linked Shoal Bay () at St Leonards Bay, and (&quot;Scratched Waka&quot;), a portage between Ngataringa Bay and Narrow Neck Beach, located underneath the reclaimed land at Waitemata Golf Club, which was underwater during king tides. Browns Bay was often a stopping point on journeys, for Māori travelling between the north and Tāmaki Makaurau to the south.

For much of Māori history, the North Shore acted as a buffer zone, between Te Tai Tokerau Māori in the north and Tāmaki Māori tribes in the south.

====Te Kawerau ā Maki, Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki and Ngāti Manuhiri ====
Likely in the 17th century, the warrior Maki migrated from the Kāwhia Harbour to his ancestral home in the Auckland Region. Maki conquered and unified many of the Tāmaki Māori tribes as Te Kawerau ā Maki, including those of the North Shore. After Maki&#x27;s death, his sons settled different areas of his lands, creating new hapū. His younger son Maraeariki settled the North Shore and Hibiscus Coast, who based himself at the head of the Ōrewa River. Maraeariki&#x27;s daughter Kahu succeeded him, and she is the namesake of the North Shore, (&quot;The Greater Lands of Kahu&quot;). Many of the iwi of the North Shore, including Ngāti Manuhiri, Ngāti Maraeariki, Ngāti Kahu, Ngāti Poataniwha, Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki and Ngāti Whātua, can trace their lineage to Kahu. Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki settlements during this period included in Northcote, the volcanic hills of Takarunga / Mount Victoria and Maungauika / North Head, and Ōmangaia Pā at Browns Bay.

The focal point of Te Kawerau ā Maki on the North Shore was (&quot;The Brow of Mana&quot;), a headland pā at Kauri Point in modern-day Chatswood likely constructed in the 17th century, and (&quot;Wind Shelter&quot;), the kāinga below the cliffs at Kendall Bay. The pā was of strategic importance due to its commanding view of the Waitematā Harbour, and its proximity to a renowned , a shark fishery which brought seasonal visitors from across Tāmaki Makurau and the Hauraki Gulf in the summer, including important rangatira such as Kiwi Tāmaki of Waiohua, and later Tarahawaiki of Ngāti Whātua. was named after the ancestor Manaoterangi, who was the rangatira of the pā in the mid-18th century. The pā was spared from the conflicts of the early 18th century between Ngāti Whātua and Waiohua, as Manaoterangi was a close relative of Tuperiri of the Ngāti Whātua, and was married to Waikahuia, the sister of Kiwi Tāmaki. At the end of his life, Manaoterangi entrusted his people to Tuperiri and the iwi that grew to become Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei.

====Expansion of Ngāti Pāoa, and early contact with Europeans====
By the early 18th century, the Marutūāhu iwi Ngāti Paoa had expanded their influence to include the islands of the Hauraki Gulf and the North Shore. The ancestor Kapetaua was marooned at Te Toka-o-Kapetaua (Bean Rock) as a child by his brother-in-law Taramokomoko, Waiohua chief of Kohimarama Pā, as punishment for stealing from kūmara pits. Taramokomoko was rescued by his sister Taurua, and fled to Waiheke Island, where he spent the rest of his childhood training to become a skilled warrior. Around the year 1700, Kapetaua formed a taua and pursued Taramokomoko, leading to the sacking of pā around the North Shore, including Te Rahopara o Peretū (Castor Bay), Onewa (Northcote), and Tauhinu (Greenhithe). After periods of conflict, peace had been reached by the 1790s.

Ngāti Paoa settled in areas such as (Torpedo Bay), (Narrow Neck), and at Northcote. Ngāti Whātua periodically occupied and Maungauika / North Head. The Hauraki Gulf coast of the North Shore was increasingly difficult to permanently settle due to skirmished between from Te Tai Tokerau Māori and Ngāti Manuhiri to the north, and Te Kawerau ā Maki chiefs encouraged Ngāti Paoa to refortify Maungauika / North Head. Ngāpuhi sieged Maungauika / North Head in the winter of 1793, after which the Ngāti Paoa residents at Maungauika / North Head fled to Waiheke Island. The leader of the northern alliance, Te Hōtete (father of Hongi Hika) settled at Takapuna for a period, returning to the north after peace with Ngāti Paoa had been made.

The earliest known European to visit the North Shore was French explorer Jules Dumont d&#x27;Urville, who anchored the &quot;Astrolabe&quot; at Torpedo Bay in 1827. Lottin, the ship&#x27;s surveyor, climbed Takarunga / Mount Victoria, and noted the pā fortifications, huts and stonefield gardens in the area. d&#x27;Urville was the first person to record the name Takapuna for the lower North Shore, when he labelled the area Taka Pouni on an 1833 map.

Early contact with Europeans in the late 18th century caused many Tāmaki Māori to die of , respiratory diseases. By the first half of the 19th century, the Upper Waitematā Harbour area near modern-day Greenhithe area was one of the most densely settled areas of the North Shore.

During the early 1820s, most Māori of the North Shore fled for the Waikato or Northland due to the threat of Ngāpuhi war parties during the Musket Wars. Pā and kāinga along the coastline were attacked, including Maungauika / North Head. Ngāti Whātua left an ahi kā presence at Tauhinu pā in Greenhithe: a small number of warriors posted to maintain claim to land.

When people returned in greater numbers to the Auckland Region in the mid-1830s, Ngāti Whātua focused resettlement in the Māngere-Onehunga area, while Te Kawerau ā Maki focused settlement at Te Henga / Bethells Beach and Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki primarily focused resettlement in East Auckland and the Pōhutukawa Coast. Ngāti Pāoa primarily focused live at Wharekawa and Waiheke Island, and were more confident occupying the North Shore, after peace had been forged between Ngāpuhi and Ngāti Pāoa in 1833. Hetaraka Takapuna and his people resettled the Northcote area in the 1830s, living on the shores of Tank Farm into the 1890s. His people were members of the te Kawerau ā Maki hapū of Ngāti Kahu and Ngāti Poataniwha, who had close associations to Ngāti Taimanawaiti (Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki) and Ngāti Paoa.

===Early European settlement===

Most early European settlers of the 1830s were not attracted to the North Shore, due to few Māori inhabitants in the area, and the shore&#x27;s resources being difficult to extract. The earliest private land sales took place on 17 April 1837, when Ngāti Whātua rangatira Nanihi and Tuire sold Te Pukapuka, a block to American whaler William Webster, at the northeastern headwaters of Oruamo or Hellyers Creek, near Bayview. Webster on-sold the land to Thomas Hellyer on 13 October 1840, who established the Retreat, a house which included a kauri sawpit, a hut, and a workshop. The Retreat became well known among sailors, who would stop at the Retreat for fresh water and beer from the Retreat&#x27;s brewhouse. On 22 December 1841, Hellyer&#x27;s body was discovered at the Retreat, and while an investigation took place, no person was convicted of his murder.

When Auckland was declared the capital of New Zealand in 1840, settlers and land speculators began to take more interest in the North Shore. The North Shore was included in the Mahurangi Block, an area purchased by the Crown on 13 April 1841. The Crown negotiated this sale with some iwi with customary interests in the area, such as Ngāti Paoa, other Marutūāhu iwi and Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki, but not others, such as Te Kawerau ā Maki or Ngāti Rango; spending until 1873 rectifying this sale.

In 1840, the first European building was constructed at Devonport, a powder magazine built at what is now Windsor Reserve. Devonport was of immediate importance to the Royal Navy, due to its proximity to Auckland, and because large vessels could be anchored at the deep water harbour. In 1841 a signal station was constructed on the peak, to better facilitate traffic to the Port of Auckland, Captain Robert Snow was employed as the first signal master, and he and his family became the first permanent residents of Devonport. The area was administered by the crown, and grew to be a settlement known as Flagstaff. Snow&#x27;s family were joined by others from 1842 onwards, who were predominantly naval personnel.

Members of Ngāti Paoa continued to live at Devonport in the 1840s, including Takarangi (baptised as Rīria), sister of Te Kupenga, a chief of Ngāti Paoa. Her husband Eruera Maihi Patuone was a Ngāpuhi chief, who spent time between different trading posts across the Hauraki Gulf, including Waiheke and Devonport. The settlement at (Torpedo Bay) was known for gardens of potatoes and cabbages, pig farming, and as a place where shark meat was suspended to dry.

In 1847, flames were seen rising from the Snow family residence, and the family had found to be murdered. Many feared that Māori had done this, and that Snow&#x27;s death was a sign of an imminent invasion. To ease tensions, Eruera Maihi Patuone investigated who could have undertaken the murder. Police suspected Thomas Duder, who had followed Snow as the signalman in 1843. Duder was arrested, and later their neighbour Joseph Burns was found guilty of the murders. Burns became the first European to be executed in New Zealand.

Outside of Devonport, European settlements across the North Shore briefly focused on kauri logging. The supply was exhausted by the early 1840s, after which itinerant kauri gum diggers roamed the North Shore. In the early 1840s, Daniel Clucas established a flax mill at Lucas Creek (Albany), where a small settlement developed, and the Callan family settled at Northcote in 1843, where Phillip Callan established industry at Sulphur Beach, establishing a brickyard and soapworks.

While Auckland grew throughout the 1850s, North Shore settlements remained sparse. Farming, while possible in the volcanic south-east, was much more difficult on the inner North Shore, due to the clay soil. The inner North Shore was covered in a mix of mānuka and bracken fern scrubland, and dense forests, which over time developed into sheep and cattle farms.

In 1852, the Crown granted of land south of Lake Pupuke to Barry&#x27;s Point / Awataha to Eruera Maihi Patuone. Patuone seen as trusted presence by the colonial government, and he was gifted land in order to create a shield for the City of Auckland against the threat of potential invasion from northern and Hauraki tribes. Patuone&#x27;s people lived in the area until the 1880s. Patuone named his settlement , meaning &quot;Waters of Wharariki&quot;, a mat made of harakeke flax. Patuone&#x27;s lands at included a peach tree orchard and a village of twenty huts. Many Ngāpuhi from the settlement worked on the farms at Lake Pupuke, establishing a network of fences for the properties. By the early 1860s, as many Māori lived on the North Shore as Europeans.

===Invasion of the Waikato===

The colonial government of Auckland had become increasingly concerned about potential invasions by Māori by the early 1860s. On 9 July 1863, due to fears of the Māori King Movement, Governor Grey proclaimed that all Māori living in the South Auckland area needed to swear loyalty to the Queen and give up their weapons. Most people refused due to strong links to Tainui, leaving for the south, before the Government instigated the Invasion of the Waikato.
 On the North Shore, a curfew was placed on all Māori vessels, and most Māori residents of the North Shore quickly left, including the kāinga at (Torpedo Bay), which European residents reported was evacuated overnight.

Māori made up a large proportion of the kauri gum diggers until the invasion. By the 1880s, Dalmatian immigrants had become a large part of the kauri gum digging workforce, along with British, Fijian and Pasifika people.

===Military forts, Chelsea and strawberries===

Devonport had grown into a centre for boatbuilding in New Zealand by the mid-1860s, and rural communities were gradually being established at Northcote and Birkenhead due to ferry services linking these communities to Auckland township. By the 1880s, Birkenhead, Northcote, Takapuna and Albany had developed into rural centres, while at the same time Devonport had developed into a commuter suburb for Auckland. By this time, the population of the North Shore had grown to 2,000 people, of whom 65% lived at Devonport. Almost all residents of the North Shore during this period were from the British Isles.

Fruit growing became a major industry for the central North Shore from the 1860s, most notably for growing varieties of strawberries that flourished in clay soils. Birkenhead grew as a community after 1884 when the Colonial Sugar Refining Company established the Chelsea Sugar Refinery. By the 1890s, Albany had become the leading fruit growing area in Auckland. 30,000 to 50,000 cases of apples and pears were being produced each year, with many being exported to Australia.

Fears of invasion by the expanding Russian Empire were common among New Zealanders in the 1870s, especially due to the founding of Russia&#x27;s Pacific port at Vladivostok. An 1884 report by Sir William Jervois, the Governor of New Zealand, included recommendations for military forts to be constructed at the country&#x27;s four main ports at Auckland, leading to the establishment of three military forts: North Head, Fort Takapuna, and Fort Victoria at Takarunga / Mount Victoria. The defense works led to growth at Devonport due to the arrival of military personnel, and by 1885 a reliable ferry service had been established between Devonport and Auckland.

===Tourism and the tramway===

By the late 1880s, Takapuna had developed into a destination for tourists, with Lake Pupuke being the main attraction until the late 1900s, when Takapuna Beach rose in prominence. Takapuna and Milford quickly became popular spots for wealthy businessmen building summer homes to entertain in a rural surrounding. Eventually, many moved here permanently, commuting to work in Auckland via ferry. The East Coast Bays became popular vacation destinations in the 1910s and 1920s, with visitors primarily arriving by steam ship.

In 1910, a private tramway was established, which conveyed passengers between the ferry at Bayswater to Milford. Planned as a way to improve land prices by a group of local businessmen, the tram led to Milford and Takapuna rapidly developing, and helped communities further north develop. The tramway soon became unpopular, and closed only 17 years after opening.

Fruit growing on the North Shore was no longer as profitable, and began disappearing by the 1930s. During World War II, coastal defenses were established along the coast, between Takapuna and Long Bay.

===Auckland Harbour Bridge and rapid development===

In 1959, the Auckland Harbour Bridge was constructed, which led to rapid suburbanisation across the North Shore. The population grew from 55,000 in 1959 to over 107,000 by 1971. While there were few opportunities for employment on the North Shore in the 1950s, this changed with the establishment of industrial areas at Wairau Valley and Barrys Point. The mid to late-20th century saw an influx in Urban Māori populations, alongside immigrants from the Pacific Islands, the Netherlands and Britain, many drawn by industrial jobs and by the seaside atmosphere of the eastern bays, or to the semi-rural lifestyle blocks around Albany.

In 1963, the Second National Government of New Zealand requisitioned of Albany under the Public Works Act, in order to construct a state housing project. Work was rapidly halted in 1969, and plans for the state housing area were abandoned. In 1977, Centrepoint was established as a commune at Albany. It became one of the most influential communes in New Zealand, at its peak had over 200 residents. In the 1990s, commune leaders including founder Bert Potter were charged on child sexual abuse and drug charges, and the commune was shut down in 2000.

The Upper Harbour Bridge was opened in 1975, connecting the North Shore to West Auckland, and leading to the development of Greenhithe and the surrounding areas. Population growth in the North Shore slowed by the 1980s, and by the early 1990s Takapuna and the East Coast Bays had become popular with retirees.

In 1989, the five local authorities on the North Shore amalgamated, forming the North Shore City. The new city revisited the idea to develop Albany, which quickly became the fastest developing area of the North Shore. The area continued to develop throughout the 2000s, and saw the construction of a vastly expanded Albany Shopping Centre. During the same time period, Long Bay developed suburban housing, due to changes in zoning laws.

In 2007, the Upper Harbour Motorway was opened, creating a motorway connection between West Auckland and the North Shore. In 2008, the Northern Busway was opened along the Northern Motorway.

On 1 November 2010 the North Shore boundaries were amalgamated with the rest of the entire Auckland Region, and the North Shore City Council was abolished and replaced by a single unitary city authority. All council services and facilities are now under authority of the Auckland Council.

==Transportation==
Commuting within the North Shore itself can be done relatively easily, but those who commute to the Auckland CBD and need to cross the Auckland Harbour Bridge face severe traffic congestion. The alternative route through western suburbs is also prone to nose-to-tail traffic at peak times. As with the greater Auckland area, there has been much discussion regarding the problem at both national and local government levels, but very little concrete action, mostly related to the high cost and difficulty of providing additional crossings over the Waitematā Harbour. Several options for new bridges and tunnels have been studied in depth, but at the moment, the official position is to mitigate congestion effects instead of providing new infrastructure. In May 2021, the government announced a $685 million cycling/walking bridge that would cross the Waitematā Harbour, after a bike protest shut down two lanes of the Auckland Harbour Bridge. However, just four months later in October, the government decided to scrap the project.

The Northern Busway running alongside the Northern Motorway, together with park and ride or drop-off areas at most of its stations, serves as the spine of a bus-based rapid transit system for North Shore and Hibiscus Coast citizens. The busway was fully operational between Constellation and Akoranga in February 2008.

A number of North Shore suburbs have a regular ferry service operated by Fullers360 to the Auckland CBD, including Devonport, Stanley Bay, Bayswater, Birkenhead. Others are planned for Takapuna and Browns Bay. A plan in the mid-2000s to turn North Shore streets into a venue for a three-day V8 supercar race generated controversy; traffic experts were hired by the North Shore City Council to assess whether such a race was possible &quot;without causing mayhem on the roads.&quot;

== Politics ==

The North Shore was first administered by highway districts, which operated from the 1860s onwards, pooling local residents&#x27; resources in order to improve infrastructure. In 1876, the Waitemata County was established across the North Shore and West Auckland after the abolition of the Auckland Province, and was one of the largest counties created in New Zealand. Between 1886 and 1954, areas of the North Shore voted to become independent areas separate from the council, establishing boroughs. The first of these was Devonport in 1886, soon followed by Birkenhead in 1888. Northcote was declared a borough in 1908, and Takapuna in 1913. The final borough that split from the Waitemata County was East Coast Bays in 1954. From 1898 until 1967, Rangitoto Island was administered by the Devonport Borough.

With the construction of the Auckland Harbour Bridge in 1959, the North Shore was opened up for expansion - vehicle volumes on the bridge became three times the forecast volume within the first decade, and began turning parts of it into a dormitory town for people working in the Auckland City Centre or further south. In 1961, Glenfield became a county town within the Waitemata County, led by chairman Stan Compton until his death in 1965, and later by Arthur Gibbons.

In the early 1960s, the Auckland Regional Planning Authority began looking for ways to better develop the county. When the dissolution of the county began to be discussed, a new body was proposed for the western North Shore, formed from the growing centres of Albany and Glenfield, which the ARA predicted would have a greater population than Takapuna City by 1986. The new body was voted on and the measure rejected, meaning that Albany and Glenfield would be incorporated into the City of Takapuna instead. On 1 August 1974, the Waitemata County was dissolved, leading to Glenfield, Albany and Long Bay, to be incorporated into Takapuna City.

In 1989, Devonport, Birkenhead, Northcote, Takapuna and East Coast Bays amalgamated, to form North Shore City. The city was run by a 15-member council (North Shore City Council) and mayor, democratically elected every three years using the First Past the Post voting system. North Shore City was amalgamated into Auckland Council in November 2010. The final mayor prior to 2010 amalgamation was Andrew Williams, who was a strong critic of the &#x27;Super City&#x27; proposals which would see North Shore City amalgamated into a larger Auckland authority, Auckland Council.

Since the 2010 local government reforms, the North Shore has been split between four local boards. Two local boards are found entirely within the North Shore: Kaipātiki local government area governed by the Kaipātiki Local Board to the southwest, and Devonport-Takapuna, governed by the Devonport-Takapuna Local Board to the southeast. The combined areas of these two districts form the North Shore ward, which elects two councillors to the Auckland Council. Additionally, the northwestern North Shore is a part of the Upper Harbour local government area, which also administers northeastern West Auckland, and is governed by the Upper Harbour Local Board. The East Coast Bays are a part of the Hibiscus and Bays local government area, governed by the Hibiscus and Bays Local Board. Similar to the North Shore ward, the Upper Harbour and Hibiscus and Bays areas combine to form the Albany ward, which elects two councillors to the Auckland Council.

For national elections, there are currently three electorates found entirely within the North Shore: North Shore, Northcote and East Coast Bays. Half of the area of the Upper Harbour electorate can be found on the North Shore, and the North Shore is entirely contained within the Māori electorate of Te Tai Tokerau.

==Economy==
There are over 22,000 businesses located on the North Shore, contributing to over 6% of New Zealand&#x27;s GDP. The city topped the nation&#x27;s growth rates for numbers of businesses between 1998 and 2002, growing 29.3%.

The suburb Albany has become the commercial centre of the North Shore. A number of retailers like Westfield are building or have built &quot;super stores&quot; in the area, anticipating ongoing commercial growth and expansion. The area has also experienced the construction of intense cheaper housing, and thousands of acres of farmland has been turned into mini-suburbs comprising hundreds of houses all of a similar design. As such, the Albany area has attracted hundreds of millions of investment dollars.

The Royal New Zealand Navy has its main base in Devonport and is a significant employer and industry.

Residential development on the North Shore continues to rapidly sprawl northwards. The Rodney township of Orewa and the Whangaparāoa Peninsula, 25 kilometres north of Takapuna, were once holiday resorts. They are now linked by the Northern Motorway and may eventually be contiguous with the North Shore&#x27;s northward urban expansion.

Some parts of the North Shore boast some of the most expensive real estate in New Zealand. The stretch of coast that runs north from Takapuna Beach to Milford, often referred to as the &quot;Golden Mile&quot;, has many properties there that have sold for several million dollars (NZ$) particularly because of the beaches, Lake Pupuke, popular schools and shopping centres such as Shore City. In 2005, one beachfront property sold for $12.8 million. Rents and property prices on the North Shore are high in relative terms, with average weekly rents (in 2002) of $243 versus $237 for Wellington and $236 for Auckland.

==Television==
The North Shore is the onscreen home of New Zealand&#x27;s most successful soap opera: Shortland Street (It was previously primarily filmed there but still has scenes on the North Shore). Go Girls is another popular show set on the North Shore. Prime TV channel has its studios and based in Albany.

==Sports==
The North Shore is home to the North Harbour Rugby Union, who field a team in the Mitre 10 Cup. They are based at North Harbour Stadium in Albany. North Shore Rugby Football Club, who play in Devonport, are the oldest rugby union club in the Auckland Region and one of the oldest in New Zealand. The North Shore is also home to North Shore United, founded in 1886, the oldest surviving association football club in New Zealand.

<text>Eddi-Rue McClanahan (February 21, 1934 – June 3, 2010) was an American actress. She was best known for her roles on television sitcoms, including Vivian Harmon on &quot;Maude&quot; (1972–78), Aunt Fran Crowley on &quot;Mama&#x27;s Family&quot; (1983–84), and Blanche Devereaux on &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; (1985–92), and its spin-off series &quot;The Golden Palace&quot; (1992–93).

McClanahan won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series in 1987 for her role in &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;.

==Early life==
Eddi-Rue McClanahan was born in Healdton, Oklahoma, on February 21, 1934. She was the daughter of Dreda Rheua-Nell (née Medaris), a beautician, and William Edwin &quot;Bill&quot; McClanahan, a building contractor. Her name combined her father&#x27;s middle name of &quot;Edwin&quot;, to create Eddi, and her mother&#x27;s middle name of &quot;Rheua&quot;, to create Rue. She stopped using &quot;Eddi&quot; because it was mistaken for a male name, and once led to her accidentally receiving a conscription notice.

She was raised Methodist and was of Irish and Choctaw ancestry. Her Choctaw great-grandfather was named Running Hawk, according to her autobiography, &quot;My First Five Husbands... and the Ones Who Got Away&quot; (2007). Due to her father&#x27;s work, her family moved frequently. She graduated from Ardmore High School in Ardmore, Oklahoma, where she acted in school plays and won the gold medal in oration. A National Honor Society member, McClanahan earned a Bachelor of Arts degree, &quot;cum laude&quot;, at the University of Tulsa, where she majored in both German and theater and joined the Kappa Alpha Theta sorority, serving as vice president.

==Career==
A life member of the Actors Studio, McClanahan made her professional stage début at Pennsylvania&#x27;s Erie Playhouse in 1957, in the play &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot;. She began acting off-Broadway in New York City in 1957, but did not make her Broadway début until 1969, when she portrayed Sally Weber in the original production of John Sebastian and Murray Schisgal&#x27;s play with music, &quot;Jimmy Shine&quot;, with Dustin Hoffman in the title role.

Her role as Caroline Johnson on the TV show &quot;Another World&quot; (from July 1970 to September 1971) brought her notice. Once her role on &quot;Another World&quot; ended, McClanahan joined the cast of the CBS soap opera &quot;Where the Heart Is&quot;, in which she played Margaret Jardin. 
In the 1972 episode of &quot;All in the Family&quot; &quot;The Bunkers and the Swingers,&quot; McClanahan and Vincent Gardenia play a swinging couple who meet the unsuspecting Bunkers. McClanahan first worked with actress Bea Arthur on the sitcom &quot;Maude&quot; (1972–78). Arthur played Maude Findlay, and McClanahan played Maude&#x27;s best friend Vivian Cavender, who eventually married Maude&#x27;s next-door neighbor Dr. Arthur Harmon (played by Conrad Bain).

After &quot;Maude&quot;, McClanahan starred in &quot;Apple Pie&quot;, a series created for her by Norman Lear, but which aired only two episodes before it was canceled. In an interview, McClanahan said she also did another of the pilot episodes &quot;The Baxters&quot; for Lear but told him she did not want to do the series itself. It is unknown if her appearance was in the actual pilot or an unaired pilot, presumably the latter given she is not credited and the show is not attributed to her anywhere. It is also possible she never actually filmed the episode but was just considering it. Many years later, a script binder entitled &quot;The Baxters&quot; was discovered to be a part of her collection.

On &quot;Mama&#x27;s Family&quot; (1983–90), McClanahan portrayed Fran, an uptight spinster sister to Mama Thelma Harper (Vicki Lawrence). Fran was a journalist for the local paper. Also in the cast was McClanahan&#x27;s future &quot;Golden Girls&quot; costar Betty White. McClanahan and White appeared on the first two seasons before the show was canceled by NBC and then retooled for first run syndication.

On &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; (1985–92) and its short-lived spin-off &quot;The Golden Palace&quot; (1992–93), McClanahan portrayed man-crazed Southern belle Blanche Devereaux, owner of the house she lived in and rented out to her three roommates and best friends: Dorothy Zbornak (Arthur), Rose Nylund (White), and Sophia Petrillo (Estelle Getty). McClanahan received four Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for her work on the show, winning the award in 1987.

She appeared as a leader of Al-Anon in a 1970s informational film called &quot;Slight Drinking Problem&quot;, in which Patty Duke played the enabling and eventually self-empowered wife of an alcoholic. In feature films, she appeared in &quot;The Rotten Apple&quot; (1961) and &quot;Walk the Angry Beach&quot; (1968). She appeared in the Walter Matthau-Jack Lemmon comedy &quot;Out to Sea&quot; (1997).

On television, she appeared as Matilda Joslyn Gage, mother-in-law of L. Frank Baum in the made-for-TV movie &quot;The Dreamer of Oz&quot; (1990). She made guest appearances on &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; and &quot;Newhart&quot;. In the early 1990s, McClanahan appeared as Margaret Becker in a trilogy of made-for-television films: &quot;Children of the Bride&quot;, &quot;Baby of the Bride&quot;, and &quot;Mother of the Bride&quot;. She voice-acted in cartoons, voicing Scarlett in the 1997 Fox Christmas special &quot;Annabelle&#x27;s Wish&quot;. She played the role of Steve&#x27;s grandmother in the Blue&#x27;s Clues video &quot;Blue&#x27;s Big Treasure Hunt&quot; (1999). On &quot;Spider-Man: The Animated Series&quot;, she appeared in the 1994 episode &quot;Doctor Octopus: Armed And Dangerous&quot; as Anastasia Hardy. She played a biology teacher in 1997&#x27;s &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;. She voiced the role of Bunny in a 2007 episode of &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, &quot;Hair Today, Gone Today.&quot; In 2009, she appeared in an episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; as a woman who had an affair with John F. Kennedy.

On Broadway, McClanahan appeared in the all-woman cast of &quot;The Women&quot; in 2001-2002, alongside Cynthia Nixon, Jennifer Coolidge, among others. She replaced Tammy Grimes as &quot;The Visitor from New York&quot; (Hannah Warren) in the Neil Simon comedy &quot;California Suite&quot; from April 4, 1977, until the show closed on July 2 of that same year.

In 2003, she appeared alongside Mark Hamill in the two-hander &quot;Six Dance Lessons in Six Weeks&quot; at the Coconut Grove Playhouse in Miami, Florida. She chose not to continue with the production and was replaced by Polly Bergen for the Broadway performances. The same year, she appeared in the musical romantic comedy film &quot;The Fighting Temptations&quot; as Nancy Stringer, which costarred Cuba Gooding, Jr., Beyoncé Knowles, Mike Epps, and Steve Harvey. On Broadway, she replaced Carole Shelley as Madame Morrible in the musical &quot;Wicked&quot; on May 31, 2005. She played the role for eight months until January 8, 2006. She was replaced by Carol Kane on January 10, 2006.

Her autobiography, &quot;My First Five Husbands ... and the Ones Who Got Away&quot;, was released in 2007. In June 2008, &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; was awarded the Pop Culture award at the Sixth Annual TV Land Awards; McClanahan accepted the award with co-stars Arthur and White. McClanahan&#x27;s final acting role was as Peggy Ingram in the cable series &quot;Sordid Lives&quot; on the Logo network, which premiered July 23, 2008.

==Activism==
An animal rights advocate and vegetarian, McClanahan was one of the first celebrity supporters of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. She supported Alley Cat Allies, a nonprofit advocacy organization dedicated to transforming communities to protect and improve the lives of cats, and appeared in a public service announcement for the organization in early 2010.

McClanahan was a supporter of gay rights, including advocating for same-sex marriage in the United States. In January 2009, she appeared in the star-studded &quot;Defying Inequality: The Broadway Concert—A Celebrity Benefit for Equal Rights&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
McClanahan was married six times, and had a son.

In June 1997, McClanahan was diagnosed with breast cancer, for which she was treated successfully.

On November 4, 2009, McClanahan underwent triple bypass surgery after being hospitalized for cardiac related symptoms. An event scheduled for November 14, 2009, to honor her lifetime achievements, &quot;Golden: A Gala Tribute to Rue McClanahan&quot;, at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco, California, had to be postponed. On January 14, 2010, &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; reported that while recovering from surgery, the actress suffered a minor stroke. In March 2010, fellow &quot;Golden Girls&quot; cast member Betty White reported on &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot; that McClanahan was doing well and that her speech had returned to normal.

McClanahan died on June 3, 2010, at age 76, at NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital after she suffered a brain hemorrhage. After cremation, her ashes were given to her family.
White told &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; that McClanahan was a &quot;close and dear friend.&quot;

McClanahan was survived by her sixth husband, Morrow Wilson (from whom she separated in 2009); her son from her first marriage, Mark Bish (of Austin, Texas); her sister, Melinda Lou McClanahan (of Silver City, New Mexico); and other family, including her niece, actress and author Amelia Kinkade.

No funeral service was held for McClanahan; her family created an official memorial page on Facebook, and memorial services were held during the summer of 2010 in New York and Los Angeles. On June 10, 2010, her New York apartment went on the market for an asking price of $2.25 million.

In February 2017, a &quot;Golden Girls–&quot;themed eatery named Rue La Rue Cafe, owned by McClanahan&#x27;s close friend Michael La Rue (who inherited many of the star&#x27;s personal belongings and in turn decorated the restaurant with them), opened in the Washington Heights section of the New York City borough of Manhattan. However, after less than a year in business, the cafe closed in November 2017.

<doc id="350805" wikidata="Q6837459" url="?curid=350805" title="Michigan Battle Cats">
<text>The Michigan Battle Cats were a Minor League Baseball team which began playing in the Midwest League in 1995 and called C.O. Brown Stadium in Battle Creek, Michigan, home. The franchise had previously been located in Madison, Wisconsin, in 1994 where they were called the Madison Hatters. Prior to that the team was located in Springfield, Illinois, and was known as the Springfield Cardinals. Upon moving to Battle Creek the team initially sought the name Battle Creek Golden Kazoos to help create a regional tie-in with the city of Kalamazoo, Michigan, but legal disputes led to the adoption of the Battle Cats moniker. The team became known as the Battle Creek Yankees beginning with their affiliation with the New York Yankees in 2003, and again changed names and affiliations in 2005 and became the Southwest Michigan Devil Rays. In 2007, citing declining attendance, the team moved to Midland, Michigan and became the Great Lakes Loons.

==Team history==
===Boston Red Sox affiliate: 1995 to 1998===
By September 1994, the city of Battle Creek had committed to stadium improvements in order to bring the Madison Hatters franchise to their city. C.O. Brown Stadium had been constructed in 1989 for amateur baseball, and it was substantially improved prior to obtaining the Midwest League franchise. After temporarily being known as the Battle Creek Golden Kazoos, the team adopted the name of Michigan Battle Cats. The team agreed to become an affiliate of the Boston Red Sox (the Madison Hatters had been affiliated with the St. Louis Cardinals, but St. Louis switched its Midwest League affiliate to Peoria).

The league also reorganized its 14 franchises from two divisions to three and adopted a three-round post-season playoff including first- and second-half winners from each division plus wildcards. Michigan played in the Eastern Division. The league&#x27;s records recognize both the winner of the post-season playoffs and the team with the highest overall season record as champions.

In 1995, their first season, the Battle Cats won the first half division championship with a 36–32 record, while their second half record of 39–31 left them one game behind the Fort Wayne Wizards. Their overall season record of 75–63 was fourth in the league. In the first round of playoffs they beat Fort Wayne two games to none, and in the second round they defeated the West Michigan Whitecaps two games to one. In the championship round, however, they were swept in three games by the Beloit Snappers. Battle Cats manager DeMarlo Hale was named the league&#x27;s Manager of the Year. Shortstop Donnie Sadler hit .283 with 9 home runs, led the league in runs scored with 103, and was named to the post-season all-star team. Pitcher Carl Pavano went 6–6 with a 3.44 earned run average and 138 strikeouts. The team&#x27;s attendance, 171,794, was eighth in the 14-team league and a marked improvement over the Madison Hatters&#x27; attendance of 69,060 the year before.

The 1996 season was less successful, as the Battle Cats finished in fourth place in the five-team division in both the first and second halves, with a 31–38 in the first half and 29–40 in the second half. The only player from the 1996 team who went on to a long major league career was their weak-hitting shortstop, Rafael Betancourt (who hit just .167); he would later find success as a relief pitcher.

In 1997 the Battle Cats went 38–31 in the first half, but that was only good for second place, 11 games behind West Michigan. In the second half they dropped to fourth place with a 32–36 record. They nevertheless qualified for the playoffs as a wildcard team, but they lost in the first round to the Lansing Lugnuts two games to one. Second baseman Jim Chamblee hit .300 with 22 home runs and 73 runs batted in and led the league with 112 runs scored. First baseman Shea Hillenbrand hit .290 with 3 home runs. Pitcher Chris Reitsma went 4–1 with a 2.90 earned run average and 41 strikeouts.

In the first half of the 1998 season, the Battle Cats went 36–36 and finished in fourth place in the Eastern Division. In the second half, though, they improved to 43–25 and won the division. For the overall season they finished tied for second place in the standings for the entire league, four games behind the West Michigan Whitecaps. In the playoffs the Battle Cats lost to West Michigan in the first round, two games to one. Manager Billy Gardner, Jr. won the league&#x27;s Manager of the Year award. Shea Hillenbrand moved to catcher and hit .349 with 19 home runs, leading the league with a .546 slugging percentage.

===Houston Astros affiliate: 1999 to 2002===
In 1999, the Michigan Battle Cats switched their affiliation from the Boston Red Sox to the Houston Astros. Previously, the Quad City River Bandits had been the Astros&#x27; Midwest League affiliate. The Battle Cats finished the first half of the season in second place with a 35–34 record, but went 41–28 in the second half to win the division. In the first round of the playoffs they lost two games to none to Lansing. First baseman Aaron McNeal hit .310, led the league in hits (with 166), home runs (with 38), and runs batted in (with 131), and captured the league&#x27;s Most Valuable Player award. Second baseman Aaron Miles hit .317 with 10 home runs and was named, along with McNeal, to the post-season all-star team. Pitcher Roy Oswalt went 13–4 with a 4.46 earned run average and 143 strikeouts, and Tim Redding went 8–6 with a 4.97 earned run average and 141 strikeouts.

In 2000, the Midwest League reorganized into two divisions; Michigan played in the six-team Eastern Division, while the Western Division comprised the other eight teams. The playoffs continued to last three rounds and to include eight teams. In the first half, the Battle Cats&#x27; 34–34 record placed them in fourth place in their division, but in the second half they won the division with a 48–22 record. (Their overall season record of 82–56 was second in the league.) In the playoffs, they beat the Fort Wayne Wizards in the first round, two games to one, and the Dayton Dragons in the second round, two games to none. In the championship round they swept the Beloit Snappers in three straight games to become the Midwest League champions. Catcher John Buck hit .282 with 10 home runs. Left fielder Jason Lane hit .299 with 23 home runs and his 104 runs batted in tied for the league lead. Pitcher Carlos Hernández went 6–6 with a 3.82 earned run average and 115 strikeouts. On May 28, Hernández pitched a no-hitter, beating the West Michigan Whitecaps 2–0.

The next season the Battle Cats finished the first half in second place in the division with a 38–30 record, two games behind. They won the division in the second half, 44–25. In the playoffs they lost in the first round to the South Bend Silver Hawks, two games to none. Shortstop Chris Burke hit .300 with 3 home runs. Pitcher Chad Qualls tied for the league lead in victories, going 15–6 with a 3.72 earned run average and 125 strikeouts. Despite the on-field success, attendance continued to drop, as it had almost every seasonsince the franchise had moved to Battle Creek, and only 66,088 fans attended. For the second straight summer the team was sold.

In 2002, the Battle Cats won the Eastern Division&#x27;s first half with a 42–28 record. They finished the second half tied for third with a 37–33 record. In the playoffs, they lost in the first round to Lansing, two games to one. Pitcher Mike Burns went 14–9 with a 2.49 earned run average, and D. J. Houlton went 14–5 with a 3.14 earned run average. The team was sold again and after the season they switched their affiliation to the New York Yankees and renamed the franchise as the Battle Creek Yankees.

<text>Adrienne Jo Barbeau (born June 11, 1945) is an American actress and author. She came to prominence in the 1970s as Broadway&#x27;s original Rizzo in the musical &quot;Grease&quot;, and as Carol Traynor, the divorced daughter of Maude Findlay (played by Bea Arthur) on the sitcom &quot;Maude&quot; (1972–1978). In 1980, she began appearing in horror and science fiction films, including &quot;The Fog&quot; (1980), &quot;Escape from New York&quot; (1981), &quot;Creepshow&quot; (1982), and &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; (1982). She also provided the voice of Catwoman in the DC Animated Universe. In the 2000s, she appeared on the HBO series &quot;Carnivàle&quot; (2003–2005) as Ruthie.

==Early life==
Barbeau was born on June 11, 1945, in Sacramento, California, the daughter of Armene (née Nalbandian) and Joseph Barbeau, who was a public relations executive for Mobil Oil. Her mother was of Armenian descent and her father&#x27;s ancestry was French Canadian, Irish, and German. She has a sister, Jocelyn, and a half brother on her father&#x27;s side, Robert Barbeau, who still resides in the Sacramento area. She attended Del Mar High School in San Jose, California. After graduating in 1963, she enrolled at Foothill College in Los Altos Hills, California, but dropped out at age 19 to participate in a USO Tour with the San Jose Light Opera. In her autobiography, Barbeau says that she first caught the show business bug while entertaining troops at army bases throughout Southeast Asia, touring with the San Jose Civic Light Opera.

==Career==
===1960s–1989===
In the late 1960s, Barbeau moved to New York City and worked &quot;for the mob&quot; as a go-go dancer. She made her Broadway debut in the chorus of &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; and later took the role of Hodel, Tevye&#x27;s daughter; Bette Midler played her character&#x27;s sister Tzeitel. She left &quot;Fiddler&quot; in 1971 to play the leading role of Cookie Kovac in the off-Broadway nudie musical &quot;Stag Movie&quot;. Barbeau, as Cookie Kovac, and Brad Sullivan, as Rip Cord, were &quot;quite jolly and deserve to be congratulated on the lack of embarrassment they show when, on occasion, they have to wander around stark naked. They may not be sexy but they certainly keep cheerful,&quot; wrote &quot;The New York Times&quot; theater critic Clive Barnes in an otherwise negative review. Barbeau went on to star in more than 25 musicals and plays, including &quot;Women Behind Bars&quot;, &quot;The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas&quot;, and &quot;Grease&quot;. She received a Theater World Award and a 1972 Tony Award nomination for her portrayal of tough-girl Rizzo in &quot;Grease&quot;.

During the 1970s, Barbeau starred as Carol Traynor, the daughter of Bea Arthur&#x27;s title character, on the comedy series &quot;Maude&quot;, which ran from 1972 to 1978 (actress Marcia Rodd had originated the role of Carol in a 1972 episode of &quot;All in the Family&quot;, also titled &quot;Maude,&quot; alongside Arthur). In her autobiography, &quot;There Are Worse Things I Could Do&quot;, Barbeau remarked: &quot;What I didn&#x27;t know is that when I said [my lines] I was usually walking down a flight of stairs and no one was even listening to me. They were just watching my breasts precede me.&quot; During the last season of &quot;Maude&quot;, Barbeau did not appear in the majority of the episodes. In a 2009 &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; TV interview, Barbeau mentioned that she had good on- and off-camera chemistry with Arthur; she said that the two stayed close until Arthur&#x27;s death on April 25, 2009. Barbeau and Arthur reunited on camera during a 2007 taping of &quot;The View&quot;, reminiscing about their long-running friendship and their years as co-stars on &quot;Maude&quot;. About her relationship with Arthur, Barbeau said in a 2018 interview with Dread Central:
&quot;I was doing an interview for this one-woman show that I am doing and the interviewer asked, &#x27;What do people usually ask you,&#x27; and I said, &#x27;They always want to know what it was like working with Bea.&#x27; She was fantastic and, you know, I realized years later how much I took it for granted because it was my first experience on television. I just assumed that everyone was as giving as she was, as professional as she was, that everyone who was doing a TV show showed up knowing their lines and showed up on time and was willing to say to the writers, &#x27;I think this line was funnier if Adie had said it or Conrad had said it or Bill had said it.&#x27; I mean, she was just the best, she was the best, very funny. She was not Maude when she wasn&#x27;t saying those lines. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d say she was quiet. She was a homebody. She had her sons, her dog and her cooking and she wasn&#x27;t into the celebrity scene and she was a great lady. I loved her dearly and we had a great cast and they were my family for six years. I loved each of them and all of them and it was the best experience anyone could&#x27;ve had, being introduced to television like that!&quot;

Barbeau was cast in numerous television films and series such as &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, &quot;Valentine Magic on Love Island&quot;, and &quot;Battle of the Network Stars&quot;. In her autobiography, she claimed: &quot;I actually thought CBS asked me to be on &quot;Battle of the Network Stars&quot; because they thought I was athletic. My husband clued me in: who cared if I won the race, as long as I bounced when I ran?&quot;

The popularity of Barbeau&#x27;s 1978 cheesecake poster confirmed her status as a sex symbol. Barbeau&#x27;s popularity stemmed partly from what critic Joe Bob Briggs referred to as the &quot;two enormous talents on that woman,&quot; and her typecasting as a &quot;tough broad&quot;. Despite her initial success, she said at the time that she thought of Hollywood as a &quot;flesh market&quot; and that she would rather appear in films that &quot;explore the human condition&quot; and &quot;deal with issues&quot;.

Barbeau&#x27;s then-husband, director John Carpenter, cast her in his horror film, &quot;The Fog&quot; (1980), which was her first theatrical film appearance. The film was released on February 1, 1980, and was a theatrical success, grossing over $21 million in the United States alone, and establishing Barbeau as a genre film star. She subsequently appeared in a number of early-1980s horror and science fiction films, including &quot;Escape from New York&quot; (1981) (also from Carpenter), &quot;Creepshow&quot; (1982) and &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; (1982). Of her screen work with Carpenter, Barbeau has stated: &quot;John is a great director. He knows what he wants and he knows how to get it. It&#x27;s simple and it&#x27;s easy [working with him].&quot;

She also appeared in the Burt Reynolds comedy &quot;The Cannonball Run&quot; (1981), and as the shrewish wife of Rodney Dangerfield&#x27;s character in &quot;Back to School&quot; (1986). Barbeau also starred in the comedy &quot;Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death&quot; (1989).

===1990s–present===
In the 1990s, Barbeau mostly appeared in made-for-television films such as Scott Turow&#x27;s &quot;The Burden of Proof&quot; (1992), as well as playing Oswald&#x27;s mother on &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot; and gaining new fame among animation fans as Catwoman on &quot;Batman: The Animated Series&quot; and &quot;Gotham Girls&quot;.

She also worked as a television talk show host and a weekly book reviewer for KABC talk radio in Los Angeles. In 1999, she guest starred in the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;Inter Arma Enim Silent Leges&quot; as Romulan Senator Kimara Cretak.

In 1998, Barbeau released her debut album as a folk singer, the self-titled &quot;Adrienne Barbeau&quot;. She starred in the cartoon series &quot;Totally Spies!&quot; doing the voice of villainess Helga Von Guggen in seasons 1, 2 and 4.

From 2003 to 2005, she starred on the HBO series &quot;Carnivàle&quot;. From March to May 2006, she starred as Judy Garland in the off-Broadway play &quot;The Property Known as Garland&quot;.

in 2007, Barbeau played a cameo role in Rob Zombie&#x27;s &quot;Halloween&quot;, a &quot;reimagining&quot; of the 1978 film of the same name, written and directed by her first husband, John Carpenter. Her scene was cut from the theatrical version of the film but is included in the DVD version.

In 2009, Barbeau was cast as &quot;The Cat Lady&quot; in the family comedy &quot;The Dog Who Saved Christmas&quot;, as Scooter&#x27;s mother in the 3D animated feature &quot;Fly Me to the Moon&quot;, and as a hospice patient in the love story &quot;Reach for Me&quot;.

Also in 2009, Barbeau had guest spots in the first episode of Showtime&#x27;s hit series &quot;Dexter&quot; (Season 4).

She voiced the Greek goddess Hera in the video game &quot;God of War III&quot; released for the PlayStation 3 in March 2010. In August 2010, she began a role on the long-running ABC daytime drama &quot;General Hospital&quot;.That same year, she had a short-lived role as Victoria Grayson’s (Madelyn Stowe)mother on the hit ABC drama Revenge. In 2014 Barbeau returned in the final season of Revenge. On her death bed she revealed a shocking secret about Victoria’s real father. 

In 2012, she voiced UNSC scientist Dr. Tilson in the highly anticipated game &quot;Halo 4&quot;, released on the Xbox 360 in November 2012. She voiced characters in the 2015 &quot;Mad Max&quot; video game.

She appears in &quot;Argo&quot; (2012), playing the former wife of Alan Arkin&#x27;s character.

Barbeau reprised her role as Catwoman in an animated remake of the third trailer for &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot;. This trailer was made to both celebrate the upcoming film as well as to promote Hub&#x27;s ten episode marathon of &quot;Batman: The Animated Series&quot;.

In 2015, she assumed the role of Berthe in &quot;Pippin&quot; with the Broadway Touring Company of the renowned musical.

In 2021, Barbeau voiced the role of Queen Gehenna in the sci-fi musical audio series, &quot;The World to Come&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1978, Barbeau met director John Carpenter on the set of his television film &quot;Someone&#x27;s Watching Me!&quot; The couple wed on January 1, 1979, and lived in Coldwater Cyn, Studio City side, reportedly remaining &quot;totally outside Hollywood&#x27;s social circles.&quot; They remained together for five years, but separated shortly after the birth of their son John &quot;Cody&quot; Carpenter on May 7, 1984. The couple divorced later that year.

In 1991, Barbeau met actor/playwright/producer Billy Van Zandt, when she was cast in the West Coast premiere of his play &quot;Drop Dead!&quot;. They wed in 1992. On March 17, 1997, at the age of almost 52, Barbeau gave birth to twin boys, Walker Steven and William Dalton Van Zandt, quipping that she was the only one on the maternity ward who was a member of AARP. The couple filed for divorce in 2018.

<text>Hans Thomas Reiser (born December 19, 1963) is an American computer programmer, entrepreneur, and convicted murderer. In April 2008, Reiser was convicted of the first-degree murder of his wife, Nina Reiser, who disappeared in September 2006. He subsequently pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of second-degree murder, as part of a settlement agreement that included disclosing the location of Nina Reiser&#x27;s body, which he revealed to be in a shallow grave near the couple&#x27;s home.

Prior to his incarceration, Reiser created the ReiserFS computer file system, which may be used by the Linux kernel but is now removed, as well as its attempted successor, Reiser4. In 2004, he founded Namesys, a corporation meant to coordinate the development of both file systems.

==Childhood, education, and career==
Hans Thomas Reiser was born in Oakland, California to Ramon and Beverly (née Kleiber) Reiser and grew up in the same city. He dropped out of junior high school when he was 13 because of his disdain for what he considered an overly rigid, conventional schooling system, and for constantly being ridiculed and bullied by his peers. Reiser stated in interviews that, at the age of 15, he was accepted into the University of California, Berkeley. Reiser attended the university off and on until he received a BS in computer science in 1992 at age 28.
==Namesys and ReiserFS==
Reiser and his company Namesys developed the journaled computer file systems ReiserFS and Reiser4. ReiserFS has been available in the Linux operating system since version 2.4.1 and has, at times, been the default filesystem on several Linux distributions including, until 2006, Novell&#x27;s SUSE Linux Enterprise.

Following Reiser&#x27;s 2006 arrest on suspicion of murder, people in the free software community expressed concern over the future of Reiser&#x27;s newer filesystem (Reiser4). Jonathan Corbet, editor of LWN.net, argued that the immaturity of Reiser4&#x27;s feature set and Reiser&#x27;s extensive combative relationship with the community meant that the filesystem&#x27;s future had been limited in any event.

Shortly after Reiser&#x27;s arrest, the employees of Namesys stated that they would continue to work, that the arrest had no immediate effect on the rate of the software&#x27;s development, and if the case expanded over a longer time, they would seek solutions to ensure the long-term future of the company. On December 21, 2006, Reiser announced that he was selling the company to raise money for his increasing legal fees. According to an interview with Namesys employee Edward Shishkin, as of January 2008, the commercial activity of the company had ceased, but it had not been sold.

In November 2023, Reiser wrote a letter to Fredrick Brennan from prison, who forwarded it with Reiser&#x27;s permission to the Linux kernel mailing list (LKML), in which Reiser recounts his regrets regarding how he interacted with the Linux community.

In November of 2024, ReiserFS has been removed from the Linux Kernel. 

==Murder of Nina Reiser==

===Marriage===
In 1998, while working in Saint Petersburg, Russia, Reiser arranged to meet a Russian woman he selected from a mail-order bride catalog. To communicate with the woman, Reiser hired an interpreter, Nina Sharanova (). Five months later, he married Nina. Nina was a Russian-born and trained obstetrician and gynecologist. They had two children. 

Hans&#x27;s father, Ramon, became suspicious of his new daughter-in-law when she took the title of CFO at Namesys at that time. Ramon was trained in military interviewing techniques and claimed that Nina lied to him when he confronted her about the fast-shrinking reserves of Namesys. 

The Reisers separated in May 2004. Nina filed for divorce three months later, citing irreconcilable differences and alleging that their children &quot;hardly know their father&quot; because he was out of the country on business for most of the year, according to court records. She was granted sole legal custody of the children and shared physical custody with her husband. The divorce was not finalized when she disappeared.

Nina obtained a temporary restraining order against Hans in December 2004 after he pushed her at the height of the divorce proceedings. She dropped the temporary restraining order in late 2005 because the heat of the divorce had chilled over time. In exchange, Hans agreed to be bound by a one-year civil restraining order which prohibited him from &quot;contacting, harassing or disturbing the peace&quot; of Nina. In May, Nina alleged in court filings that her husband had failed to pay 50 percent medical expenses and childcare expenses as ordered by a judge and was in arrears for more than $12,000.

===Nina Reiser&#x27;s murder and disappearance===
According to a later confession by Hans to authorities, on September 3, 2006, Nina dropped their children off with Hans at his mother&#x27;s house, where he was living at the time. The pair got into a heated argument, and Hans strangled her. He buried her body in an isolated area over the course of two nights.

Nina was reported missing on September 5, 2006. She had last been seen on September 3, when she dropped the children off at Hans&#x27;s mother&#x27;s house.

Nina&#x27;s minivan, with groceries inside, was found on September 9. It was reported by police that neighbors first spotted the parked minivan on September 5.

Hans&#x27;s neighbors said that they saw him hosing something down in the driveway for half an hour shortly after Nina went missing and said that his car disappeared shortly after, and his mother rented a car so Hans could drive hers. Police searched his property.

Following Nina&#x27;s disappearance, Hans attempted to obtain custody but was unsuccessful. Oakland police testified against Hans Reiser at the custody hearing, though they did not reveal the evidence on which they based their concerns.

===Murder investigation===
Later that month, Oakland police briefly detained Hans Reiser, served him with a search warrant on his person, and obtained a DNA sample. On October 10, 2006, following the second search of his home, Oakland police and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) investigators removed a number of items. HSI had been investigating Reiser for money laundering. Police arrested Reiser for the murder of Nina and charged him.

On October 11, 2006, law enforcement officials said that blood spatter had been found in Reiser&#x27;s house and car. Forensic testing could neither confirm nor rule out Nina as the source of the blood. Daniel Horowitz, a high-profile defense attorney, joined the defense team and dropped the case on November 28, citing Reiser&#x27;s inability to pay for his services. 

Namesys&#x27;s employees said that Reiser felt that the police would suspect him from the start. Reiser was arraigned on Thursday, October 12, where he delayed entering a plea until his next court appearance on November 28. He was held without bail. On November 28, Reiser entered a not guilty plea and invoked his right to a speedy trial, forcing the state to schedule a preliminary hearing for December 11.

On December 2, at the request of the Oakland police, search and rescue teams combed an area less than from Hans Reiser&#x27;s house, but no new major findings were announced.

===Trial===
On March 9, the judge ruled that Reiser would stand trial and set Reiser&#x27;s arraignment for March 23.

On March 23, Reiser pleaded not guilty. Shortly after, the court learned of a complication in the trial regarding a former friend of Reiser, Sean Sturgeon. Sturgeon, who had previously dated Nina Reiser, claimed responsibility for eight murders and &quot;possibly&quot; a ninth. In an interview with Wired News, Sturgeon denied that Nina Reiser was one of them. The police doubted that the murders ever took place, and Judge Clay issued a gag order against discussing Sturgeon at the trial.

Hans Reiser&#x27;s murder trial began on November 6. Reiser denied responsibility for the murder throughout the trial. When Reiser testified in his own defense, his implausible claims and erratic behavior in the courtroom largely undermined his claim of innocence. Psychiatrist Beverly Parr testified that he &quot;possibly&quot; exhibited symptoms of Asperger syndrome but did not make a diagnosis.

The prosecutor concluded by urging jurors to convict Hans Reiser. On April 28, 2008, Hans Reiser was found guilty of first degree murder.

=== Recovery of Nina&#x27;s body and sentencing ===
Prosecutors agreed to a deal whereby Reiser would reveal the location of Nina&#x27;s body in exchange for being allowed to plead guilty to second-degree murder. On Monday, July 7, 2008, Reiser led police to Nina&#x27;s grave. Oakland homicide detective Lt. Ersie Joyner recalled that Reiser led them directly to the exact site, without any hesitation or confusion. On July 8, the coroner identified the skeletal remains as those of Nina.

On August 29, 2008, Reiser was sentenced to 15 years to life, the maximum sentence for second-degree murder. As a result of his plea bargain, Reiser cannot appeal his conviction or sentence.

=== Time in prison ===
On September 5, 2008, Reiser arrived at San Quentin State Prison to begin his sentence. Reiser tried to appeal his second-degree murder conviction on October 30, 2008. The request was denied on November 13, 2008. 

On January 10, 2009, it was reported that Reiser was recovering after having been beaten by several prisoners. On January 28, 2009, he was transferred to Mule Creek State Prison. In February 2011, he was transferred to Pleasant Valley State Prison. In 2020, Reiser was housed at the Correctional Training Facility near Soledad, California. As of November 2021, he is in the California Health Care Facility.

In September 2011, Hans Reiser filed a civil lawsuit. In his complaint, he named more than 70 defendants, including trial judges and his attorney, William Du Bois. He claimed, among other things, that his attorney had conspired with the judge to file motions against him, which were impossible to appeal, and that his attorney had forced him to take the stand against his will. The lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice. 

In July 2012, a jury awarded Reiser&#x27;s children $60 million against their father for the death of Nina Reiser. Hans Reiser acted as his own attorney during the trial and tried to argue that he killed his wife to protect their children.

<doc id="350819" wikidata="Q18860" url="?curid=350819" title="Red-necked stint">
<text>The red-necked stint (Calidris ruficollis) is a small migratory wader. The genus name is from Ancient Greek &quot;kalidris&quot; or &quot;skalidris&quot;, a term used by Aristotle for some grey-coloured waterside birds. The specific &quot;ruficollis&quot; is from Latin &quot;rufus&quot;, &quot;red&quot; and &quot;collum&quot;, &quot;neck&quot;.

==Description==
These birds are among the smallest of waders, very similar to the little stint, &quot;Calidris minuta&quot;, with which they were once considered conspecific. The red-necked stint&#x27;s small size, fine dark bill, dark legs and quicker movements distinguish this species from all waders except the other dark-legged stints. It measures in length, in wingspan and in body mass. It can be distinguished from the western sandpiper and the semipalmated sandpiper in all plumages by its combination of a fine bill tip, unwebbed toes, and longer primary projection.

The breeding adult has an unstreaked orange breast, bordered with dark markings below, and a white V on its back. In winter plumage identification is difficult, although it is shorter legged and longer winged than the little stint. Juveniles have more contrasting mantle plumage and weaker white lines down the back than their relative. The call is a hoarse &quot;stit&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
Red-necked stints are strongly migratory, breeding along the Arctic littoral of eastern Eurasia and spending the non-breeding season in South East Asia and Australasia as far south as Tasmania and New Zealand. They are rare vagrants to western Europe, with most records from Ireland. They are often seen in western Alaska and occasionally elsewhere in the Americas.

==Behaviour==
Red-necked stints are highly gregarious and will form flocks with other small &quot;Calidris&quot; waders, such as sharp-tailed sandpipers and curlew sandpipers in their non-breeding areas.

===Breeding===
Their breeding habitat is tundra. They nest on the ground and breed from spring to summer.

===Diet===
They forage in wet grassland and soft mud, mainly picking up food by sight. In their non-breeding habitat they feed on intertidal mudflats and along the muddy margins of freshwater lakes. They mainly eat insects and other small invertebrates.

<text>&quot;Kīngi&quot; Tāwhiao (Tūkaroto Matutaera Pōtatau Te Wherowhero Tāwhiao, ; c. 1822 – 26 August 1894), known initially as Matutaera, reigned as the Māori King from 1860 until his death. After his flight to the King Country, Tāwhiao was also Paramount Chief of Te Rohe Pōtae for 17 years, until 1881. A rangatira, and a religious figure – a tohunga ariki – Tāwhiao amassed power and authority during a time of momentous change, to become &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the Waikato tribes. He was a member of the Ngati Mahuta hapū and the &quot;kāhui ariki&quot;, the Kīngitanga royal family.

The son of &quot;kīngi&quot; Pōtatau te Wherowhero, Tāwhiao was elected the second Māori King after his father&#x27;s death in 1860. Unlike his unenthusiastic father, Tāwhiao embraced the kingship, and responded immediately to the challenge of ongoing Raukawa and Tainui support for Te Āti Awa during the First Taranaki War. In 1863, Tāwhiao was baptised into the Pai Mārire faith, taking his regnal name, before leading the response to the invasion of the Waikato. After the Kīngitanga suffered a heavy defeat at the Battle of Rangiriri and war crimes at the trading centre of Rangiaowhia, Tāwhiao led the exodus of Tainui to the land of Ngāti Maniapoto, establishing a secessionist state called Te Rohe Pōtae (the King Country). Warning all Europeans that they risked death if they crossed the border, he governed Te Rohe Pōtae as an independent state for almost twenty years. Tāwhiao&#x27;s power began to decline significantly in the 1880s, as his relations with Raukawa ki Ngāti Maniapoto deteriorated. He formally sued for peace with George Grey at Pirongia on 11 July 1881, allowing the construction of the North Island Main Trunk railway line, which first opened the King Country up to the outside world. Attempts by Tāwhiao to regain personal sovereignty or establish co-governance in accordance with the Treaty of Waitangi failed, and the Kīngitanga began to lose its supporters. The king died suddenly in August 1894, and was succeeded by his son Mahuta Tāwhiao.

Tāwhiao&#x27;s legacy includes building the kingitanga from a union of mid-Northern tribes into &quot;one of New Zealand’s most enduring political institutions,&quot; becoming a powerful adversary of the Crown that endured even after the exodus into the King Country and the eventual loss of its sovereignty. He is credited with establishing several key Kīngitanga institutions, including Te Whakakitenga, the bicameral legislature of Waikato Tainui, and the annual Poukai conference, as well as the initial Kīngitanga Bank, which collapsed, and then the successful Bank of Aotearoa. Tāwhiao has also been the subject of controversy, in connection with the forfeiture of the Kīngitanga Bank, and his conversion to Mormonism.

==Early life and name==
Tūkaroto Pōtatau Te Wherowhero (Tainui orthonography: &quot;Tuukaroto Pootatau Te Wherowhero&quot;) was born around 1822 at Ngāruawāhia. His father, Te Wherowhero, was arguably the Paramount Chief of the Waikato people, and his mother, Whakaawi, was Te Wherowhero&#x27;s senior wife. Te Wherowhero the younger was raised through whāngai by his mother&#x27;s parents, making him distant from his father. He was named Tūkāroto in commemoration of his father&#x27;s stand at the siege of Mātakitaki pā in May 1822 against Ngāpuhi. After the Waikato were defeated by musket-armed Ngāpuhi led by Hongi Hika in a battle at Matakitaki (Pirongia) in 1822, they retreated to Orongokoekoea Pā, in what is now the King Country, and lived there for several years. Tāwhiao was born at Orongokoekoea in about 1825 and was named Tūkaroto to commemorate, it is said, his father&#x27;s stand at Matakitaki.

Tāwhiao&#x27;s name changed throughout his life. Initially known as Tūkaroto, he was later baptised Matutaera (Methuselah) by Anglican missionary Robert Burrows, a name he would repudiate in 1867. Te Ua Haumēne, the Hauhau prophet and founder of the Pai Mārire faith, sought counsel with the king in the 1860s. After the invasion of the Waikato in 1863, Matutaera travelled to Te Namu pā in Ōpunake to meet him. There, Matutaera was baptised into the Pai Mārire faith, taking the name &quot;Tāwhiao&quot;, meaning &quot;encircle the world&quot;.

== Biography ==

In 1858 Tāwhiao&#x27;s father, Pōtatau Te Wherowhero, was installed as the first Māori King (taking the name Pōtatau), his purpose being to promote unity among the Māori people in the face of Pākehā encroachment. Pōtatau was an unwilling ruler, and acquiesced to accept the crown as merely a transitional holder. Several rūnanga were held to discuss the proposal for the elderly Te Wherowhero to ascend to the Kingitanga. One such hui was an 1857 meeting known as Te Puna o te Roimata (the wellspring of tears), at Haurua, south of Ōtorohanga, hosted by Tainui kin Ngāti Maniapoto. Tanirau, a powerful Ngāti Maniapoto chief, announced the iwi&#x27;s at-large decision to support Pōtatau as king. Pōtatau replied, ‘E Tā, kua tō te rā’ (O sir, the sun is about to set), a proverb commenting on his advanced age and poor health, implying he had not much longer to live. Tanirau replied, ‘E tō ana i te ahiahi, e ara ana i te ata, e tū koe he Kīngi’ (it sets in the evening to rise again in the morning; thou art raised up a king). This referred to the possibility of introducing hereditary rule to the monarchy; Tanirau later espoused support for Tāwhiao (then known as Matutaera) or his siblings to succeed Pōtatau Te Wherowhero upon the latter&#x27;s death. Pōtatau replied, ‘E pai ana’ (it is good), and ascended to the kingship, and to Waikato the role of kaitiaki of the Kīngitanga. The Kīngitanga remains a hereditary monarchy, and is yet to leave the hands of Waikato Tainui.

When Pōtatau died in 1860, Tāwhiao, his sister Te Paea Tiaho, and Wiremu Tamihana Tarapipipi of Ngāti Hauā were candidates to succeed him. Tāwhiao was chosen and reigned for thirty-four years during one of the most difficult and discouraging periods of Māori history. During this period there were two governments &quot;de jure&quot;; English law and governance prevailed within the British settlements and Māori custom over the rest of the country, although the influence of the King was largely confined to the Waikato and even there chiefs such as Rewi Maniapoto only cooperated with the king when it suited them. However the Pākehā population was increasing rapidly while the Māori population was unknown as there was no reliable census of Maori and Pākehā / Maori for 80 years. Because Maori separated themselves from Pākehā, many believed, wrongly, that the Maori population was declining rapidly. This was also the period when British industrial, trade and political power was at its height. The presence of an independent native state in the central North Island was officially ignored by the government until it developed the potential to undermine the colonial government&#x27;s sovereignty.

After Tāwhiao converted to the Pai Mārire faith in early 1863, he and Te Ua Haumene established Te Kīwai o te Kete, the military pact forged between Taranaki and Tainui Māori during the New Zealand Wars. The two iwi had recently allied in 1860, during the First Taranaki War, when Kingitanga forces under the command of Epiha Tokohihi had come to the aid of Taranaki leader Wiremu Kīngi Te Rangitāke. Pōtatau Te Wherowhero had died in June 1860, making the First Taranaki War Tāwhiao&#x27;s first major challenge. Tāwhiao supported the Kīngitanga&#x27;s uniting principle of opposition to the sale of Māori land, to prevent the spread of British sovereignty, but as a pacifist he was divided over how to respond. Both Wiremu Kīngi and the Colonial Government had made repeated diplomatic approaches to Pōtatau to ask him for military and diplomatic support, but by early May Pōtatau seemed to have decided to offer at least token support to Taranaki Māori, sending a Kingite war party to the district under the control of war chief Epiha Tokohihi. Tāwhiao eventually opted to maintain this policy.

== Invasion of the Waikato ==
In 1863, after Maniapoto warriors ambushed and killed British soldiers escorting a detained British soldier along the beach to New Plymouth to stand trial, the Government attacked the Kingitanga in Waikato, to suppress the King movement and remove a supposed threat to neighbouring Auckland. Having succeeded the inefficient Thomas Gore Browne as Governor, George Grey had convinced the government of a supposed invasion of Auckland by Waikato Tainui. According to Browne, in response to his belligerence in the First Taranaki War, Kingite leaders formed plans to launch a raid on Auckland on 1 September and burn the town and slaughter most of its residents. This has since been dismissed by such historians as James Belich as being fear-mongering from Browne in order to try and gain military support. Browne&#x27;s invasion plan was suspended when he was replaced by Grey in September that year, and the Kingites in turn abandoned their plan for their uprising. Grey had held a grudge against the Kīngitanga since falling out with Tāwhiao&#x27;s father, his old friend Pōtatau Te Wherowhero, with whom he had once had a &quot;wonderful relationship&quot;, according to historian Rahui Papa. According to Brad Totorewa, Grey had begged Te Wherowhero to protect Auckland from Ngāpuhi, but Te Wherowhero had refused; after a meeting in which Grey demanded Te Wherowhero to relinquish his power or face seven years of war, Te Wherowhero had threatened to eat him.

With his longstanding desire to destroy the Kingitanga in mind, on 9 July 1863 Grey issued a new ultimatum, ordering that all Māori living between Auckland and the Waikato take an oath of allegiance to Queen Victoria or be expelled south of the river. As many young men retreated into the bush with their weapons, officials began seizing others—including the ill and aged—who declined to swear the oath, imprisoning them without charge. Two days later Grey issued a proclamation directed to the &quot;Chiefs of Waikato&quot; as opposed to Tāwhiao in particular, which read:Within a day—before the proclamation had even reached the Tāwhiao—Grey ordered the invasion of Tāwhiao&#x27;s territory. Though Grey claimed it was a defensive action, historian B. J. Dalton has claimed Grey&#x27;s reports to London had been &quot;a deliberate and transparent falsehood&quot; and that the invasion was an act of &quot;calculated aggression&quot;. According to historian Vincent O&#x27;Malley, there was a total of 18,000 troops involved in the invasion of the Waikato, who had the advantage of a ready supply of food and ammunition. The campaign lasted for nine months, from July 1863 to April 1864. The invasion was aimed at crushing Kingite power (which European settlers saw as a threat to colonial authority) and also at driving Waikato Māori from their territory in readiness for occupation and settlement by European colonists.

Tāwhiao&#x27;s response was to abandon his pacifism and fight. He relied on his junior chiefs to help sustain the population and engineer defences and palisades to protect pā and areas of economic importance, such as flour mills. Te Wharepu, a leading Waikato chief, was the mastermind behind the defences of Rangiriri, a one kilometre-long system of deep trenches and high parapets that ran between the Waikato River and Lake Waikare. Despite this, the Battle of Rangiriri of 20–21 November 1863 was lost by the Waikato Māori, at a higher cost to both sides than any other single engagement of the New Zealand Wars. Further atrocities committed at Rangiaowhia made the situation even more desperate for Tāwhiao&#x27;s leadership.

The Battle of Ōrākau was a turning point, and arguably the Waikato War&#x27;s decisive engagement, which &quot;signified the end of one form of resistance and the beginning of another&quot;. The battle was commanded by Tāwhiao, Wiremu Tamihana, and Rewi Maniopoto between 31 March and 2 April 1864, against the forces of Duncan Cameron. According to Michael Belgrave, when Cameron offered the forces of Tāwhiao and Rewi Manipoto surrender, the defenders replied, ‘E hoa, ka whawhai tonu ahau ki a koe, ake, ake!’ (‘Friend, I shall fight against you for ever, for ever!’). When the women and children were offered safe passage, a voice from the pā called out, &quot;Ki te mate nga tane, me mate ano nga wahine me nga tamariki&quot; (&quot;If the men die, the women and children must die as well&quot;). Belgrave says that although their escape &quot;was marked by rape and the brutal killing of the surrendered&quot;, the bravery of the last defenders of Ōrākau played no part in the myth that emerged.

Described as &quot;Rewi&#x27;s Last Stand&quot;, the battle was remembered by Pākehā historians in the coming decades as the &quot;dying act of a doomed people pitted against.. a superior European world&quot;. According to Belgrave, George Grey used the events at Ōrākau to describe Māori resistance as &quot;an act of unconquerable courage upon the part of . . . adversaries, who fell before superior numbers and weapons – an act which the future inhabitants of New Zealand will strive to imitate, but can never surpass&quot;. Belgrave has argued that this undermines the resilience of Waikato Tainui, as evident by their exodus to the King Country.

=== Surrender and flight ===
After the defeat of the Kīngitanga at Ōrākau, Cameron prepared to assault Wiremu Tamihana&#x27;s pā, Te Tiki o te Ihingarangi, about 25 km northeast of Ōrākau near modern-day Lake Karapiro, where Tāwhiao had escaped to. The &quot;pā&quot; formed part of a long line of &quot;pā&quot; the Kingites called &quot;aukati&quot;, or boundary. Cameron assessed the &quot;pā&quot; as too strong to assault and incapable of outflanking. On 2 April he settled his troops in front of it, and prepared to shell it. On 5 April, the pā&#x27;s inhabitants fled, and began their long exodus southeast to Ngāti Maniapoto whenua - the King Country.

Killing thousands and forcing their exile, the invasion of the Waikato was devastating for the Kīngitanga. According to Vincent O&#x27;Malley, &quot;it is clear that Waikato Māori suffered horrendous losses... overall estimates for those killed and wounded during the Waikato War have ranged from about 500 to 2,000 casualties on the Kīngitanga side&quot;. O&#x27;Malley has compared the losses for Waikato to the heavy casualties of New Zealand soldiers during the First World War, in which 5.8% of the national population of just over 1 million served, 1.7% of whom were killed. O&#x27;Malley says that although &quot;this staggering level of carnage is rightly remembered today, [it] may have been eclipsed by the casualty rate suffered by Waikato Māori in 1863 and 1864&quot;, in which he estimates 7.7 per cent of their total population fought and just under 4 per cent were killed. The conquered land was confiscated, altogether about a million acres (4,000 km2).

== Te Rohe Pōtae ==

Tāwhiao and his people had moved southwards, into the territory of the Ngāti Maniapoto, the area of New Zealand that is still known as the King Country. He established Te Rohe Pōtae, a secessionist independent state which he and other rangatira governed for 20 years. This name translates as &quot;Area of the Hat&quot;, and is said to have originated when Tāwhiao put his white top hat on a large map of the North Island and declared that all land covered by the hat would be under his &quot;mana&quot; (or authority).

According to Massey University professor Michael Belgrave, the Rohe Pōtae also became &quot;the refuge for Māori who had taken up armed resistance to the Crown&quot;. A notable example of this was Te Kooti, who resided under the protection of Tāwhiao from 1872. According to Belgrave: &quot;for years, [Tawhiao] sat audaciously beyond the legal authority of the Queen and the vengeance of those communities he had ravaged on the East Coast... the establishment of the Rohe Pōtae, in the aftermath of the war, created an independent constitutional entity with its own borders and its own centralised authority. Belgrave has compared the invasion of the Waikato to the American Civil War, as it led to the creation of an &quot;independent breakaway state&quot;. According to Belgrave, &quot;between the battle of Ōrākau and the mid-1880s, the Rohe Pōtae remained an independent and unified state, but that unity was precarious&quot;, owing to the disunity between the iwi of Tainui and the increased resentment of monarchical rule. 

For the next twenty years Tāwhiao lived an itinerant lifestyle, travelling among his people in Taranaki and Maniapoto settlements reminding them that war always had its price and the price was always higher than expected. He considered himself the anointed leader of a chosen people wandering in the wilderness. But he also predicted that the Māori people would find justice and restitution for the wrongs they had suffered. He preached that Kingites should keep separate from Pākehā. He was strongly against Maori children going to school to get an education. As a result, when the railway went through Kingite territory Kingites were only able to get unskilled jobs such as bush clearing. This strong anti education stance started a Kingite tradition that led to increasing isolation and lower standard of living than Maori experienced elsewhere in New Zealand. It was not until after the turn of the century that Kingites were finally persuaded to abandon their hatred of formal education in schools.

Tāwhiao was now leader of his own secessionist kingdom, but was utterly isolated. According to Belgrave &quot;the Rohe Pōtae was an enclosed territory surrounded by land with a Crown title,&quot;. This stretched from the Aotea Harbour east to the boundary where the land confiscation in the Waikato had occurred, and then &quot;along the boundaries of the Maungatautari and Pātetere blocks, to the Waipapa stream then south to Taupō. After that the line crossed the middle of the lake and ran to the top of the Kaimanawa range, looped through the central plateau between Ruapehu and Ngāruahoe, and then crossed the Whanganui River at Kirikau and headed west until it joined the Taranaki confiscation block.&quot; To the west was Kāwhia, Te Rohe Pōtae&#x27;s major port, and to the east were Te Arawa, who were loyal to the British crown. The &quot;kūpapa&quot; among their highest ranks had prevented reinforcements from allies on the East Cape coming to support Tāwhiao during the invasion of the Waikato. To the south was the Taranaki confiscation and a largely ambivalent assortment of Māori living in Whanganui, who despite the great friendship Tāwhiao had professed as existing between the Waikato and Taranaki, were divided on supporting the king. The Rohe Pōtae, although an untouchable secessionist state, remained outflanked on all sides. The Kīngitanga was soon facing threats from the renegade chiefs it was sheltering from the Crown, including Tītokowaru and Te Kooti, who &quot;directly threatened the King’s authority to speak for dissident Māori throughout the country&quot;. 

In 1878, the New Zealand Government with George Grey as Premier approached Tāwhiao with the proposal that some of their Waikato land would be restored to them if they would accept the integration of the King Country with the rest of New Zealand. On the advice of his council Tāwhiao rejected the offer. However it was accepted three years later in a modified form.

The decline of the king&#x27;s power was hastened by the lessening generosity of Ngāti Maniopoto in hosting the Kīngitanga; the iwi were increasingly impatient for Tāwhiao to return to the Waikato homeland. After his symbolic declaration of peace in July 1881, Tawhiao began to lose his authority, and after 1882, the King &quot;could no longer exercise a unifying role, and tribes were forced to find another constitutional basis for maintaining their independent authority&quot;. Although they would still have control over their whenua until at least 1886, Manipoto began to experience challenges in maintaining order and making decisions with Tāwhiao gone. According to Belgrave, despite the efforts of a willing Ngāti Maniapoto leadership, it became extremely difficult and at times impossible for them and other leaders, &quot;to maintain a coherent constitutional entity within the aukati&quot;, Achieving a degree of consensus among Ngāti Maniapoto alone was apparently a &quot;tortuous process&quot;, making it easier for Native Minister John Bruce to eye up the previously restricted territory.

== Later reign ==

=== Visit to the United Kingdom ===

In the early 1880s there had already been two failed petitions taken to the British government by Maori. By 1884, there were only 1,000 kingite supporters left, according to Claudia Orange. King Tāwhiao went around the North Island collecting money. This netted 3,000 pounds. He withdrew all the funds that had been deposited in the Kingitanga Bank by the many Maori land sellers, and travelled to London to see Queen Victoria with Western Maori MP Wiremu Te Wheoro to lead a deputation with a petition to the Crown to try to persuade her to honour the treaty between their peoples. Tāwhiao&#x27;s petition was different from the previous failed ones. He asked for nothing less than the complete, separate, Maori self-government, drawing on Section 71 of the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852. Although Tāwhiao saw the queen as no more than &quot;a remote and benign figure of little relevance&quot; – as had been the Kingitanga&#x27;s position since its establishment – he believed she could shepherd in respect for the Treaty of Waitangi.

The journey was aided by Governor George Grey, who met with Tāwhiao at a summit on Kawau Island beforehand. He convinced the king and his fellow rangatira Rewi Maniapoto and Te Whēoro to sign a pledge to act with the “propriety and dignity which became his position”. This was a veiled reference to Tāwhiao&#x27;s alcoholism; Grey was &quot;determined to limit the likelihood of a drunk monarch turning up at a royal garden party&quot;, according to &quot;The Spinoff&quot;. This was apparently successful, and during his stay Tāwhiao drank ginger ale instead.

Despite his best attempts at temperance, however, Victoria refused to grant him an audience. Tāwhiao did, however, wrangle a meeting with Lord Derby, Secretary of State for the Colonies, who said the question of Māori self-determination was an issue for the New Zealand government to resolve internally. Returning to New Zealand, the premier, Robert Stout, insisted that all events happening prior to 1863 were the responsibility of the Imperial Government. The Maori bank depositors, finding their money gone, raided the bank, looking for their cash and finding none, burnt it down in 1884. Thoroughly disillusioned, Tāwhiao tried various initiatives to promote the independence and welfare of his people but he had been effectively marginalized. His problems were not solely due to the attitude of the New Zealand government. The King Movement had never represented all the Māori people and as it lost its mana or standing they became even more disunited.

Undeterred, Tāwhiao resolved to establish a new bank, the Bank of Aotearoa (&quot;Te Peeke o Aotearoa&quot;), at Parawera in 1886. Quickly expanding to Maungatatauri and Maungakawa. Cheques were issued by customers, but the bank issued no banknotes nor minted coins. It provided banking and monetary services to Māori (particularly those within the King Country). Sample banknotes bore the text &quot;E whaimana ana tenei moni ki nga tangata katoa&quot; (this money is valid for all people). Cheques issued on the Bank of Aotearoa let customers transfer large amounts of money without using cash.

=== Hui at Pīrongia ===
On 11 July 1881, Tāwhiao, escorted by between five hundred and six hundred men, many of them armed, rode into Pirongia from the Tainui settlement at Hikurangi, modern-day Taumarunui. A pacifist, Tāwhiao had finally elected to sue for peace. Chiefs accompanying him included Wahanui and Manuhiri. It was Major William Mair, the Government Native Officer in the Upper Waikato, who was sent by Governor George Grey to meet Tawhiao, and there in the main street of the township the Maori King laid down his gun at Mair&#x27;s feet. Scores of his men followed his example, until seventy-seven guns were lying on the road in front of the Government officer. According to James Cowan, Wahanui came forward and said: “Do you know what this means, Mair? This is the outcome of Tawhiao&#x27;s word to you that there would be no more trouble. This means peace.” Mair replied that that was self-evident, and said &quot;I call to mind the words that Tawhiao uttered at Tomotomo-waka (Te Kopua) that there would be no more fighting. This is the day that we all have been waiting for. We know now that there will be no more trouble.”

In spite of this, the next decade would result in further impoverishment for Tainui, as the &quot;aukati&quot; was dissolved and their last stronghold was exposed to European settlers. The construction of the North Island Main Truck Railway would spell the end of the Rohe Pōtae as an independent state.

=== Establishment of the Kauhanganui and decline ===
Back in New Zealand in 1886 and seeking Māori solutions to Māori problems through Māori institutions, he petitioned Native Minister John Ballance for the establishment of a Māori Council &quot;for all the chiefs of this Island&quot;. When this proposal, too, was ignored, he set up a Kīngitanga parliament at Maungakawa in 1892; initially called the Kauhanganui, it was later renamed Te Whakakitenga. Though all North Island iwi were invited to attend, participation was confined mainly to the Waikato, Maniapoto and Hauraki people who were already part of the King Movement. The assembly&#x27;s discussions included proceedings in the national Parliament, interpretations of the Treaty of Waitangi, the confiscation issue and conditions for land sales, but its deliberations and recommendations were either ignored or derided by the Parliament and public servants. The establishment of Tāwhiao&#x27;s Kauhanganui coincided with the formation of a Māori Parliament at Waipatu Marae in Heretaunga. This parliament, which consisted of 96 members from the North and South Islands under Prime Minister Hāmiora Mangakāhia, was formed as part of the Kotahitanga (unification) Movement, which Tāwhiao refused to join.

== Death ==
During the remainder of his life Tāwhiao was respected and treated as royalty by many New Zealanders, both Māori (Kīngitanga-affiliated or not) and Pākehā. But he was allowed almost no influence over political events, as he had no legal authority within English law, which had displaced tikanga.

Tāwhiao died suddenly on 26 August 1894, aged 71 or 72. As is Tainui custom, he was buried at Mount Taupiri in an unmarked grave, as a sign of equality among his people. His tangihanga was held in September and was attended by thousands. He was succeeded as king by his son Mahuta Tāwhiao, who won the election to replace him.

==Religion and philosophy==
Encouraged by his veteran father&#x27;s encouragement to become a man of peace, Tāwhiao was a deeply spiritual man throughout his life. The King was both a Christian and a follower of indigenous Māori religion, and although not a tohunga himself he was well versed in the ancient rites of the Tainui priesthood. In later years Tāwhiao&#x27;s sayings were considered prophecies for the future, and passed down as &quot;taonga tuku iho&quot;. Tāwhiao&#x27;s fundamentally pacifist nature led him to formally denounce conflict between Māori and Pākehā, and campaign for peaceful coexistence and Māori autonomy under Section 71 of the New Zealand Constitution Act. Tāwhiao was quoted by his descendant Robert Mahuta as having said: &quot;Beware of being enticed to take up the sword. The result of war is that things become like decaying, old dried flax leaves. Let the person who raises war beware, for he must pay the price.&quot;

After his baptism into the faith by the prophet Te Ua Haumene in Ōpunake in 1863, Tāwhiao&#x27;s connection to the Pai Mārire religion grew stronger. The two men helped established The faith was initially called Hauhau, or Hauhauism especially by its detractors; the name &quot;Pai Mārire&quot; itself (good and gentle) was taken from a Waikato ritual chant. Tāwhiao also highly valued the relationship between Waikato and Taranaki. During a visit to Taranaki about 1864, Tāwhiao was famously quoted as saying: &quot;You, Taranaki, have one handle of the kit, and I, Waikato, have the other. A child will come some day and gather together its contents&quot;.

In 1875, he issued a &quot;whakapuakitanga&quot; declaring his own version of the faith, which was called Tariao (morning star) – as the official faith of the King movement. Tāwhiao&#x27;s granddaughter, Te Puea, ensured the continuance of Pai Mārire into modern times, recalling the story of how, just before his death, Tāwhiao told his people, &#x27;I shall return this gift to the base of the mountains, leaving it there to lie. When you are heavily burdened, then fetch it to you.&#x27;

=== Connection to Mormonism ===
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) was active in New Zealand from 1867. In the 1880s, a Wairarapa newspaper quoted Tāwhiao as claiming a belief in Mormonism: &quot;I was some time ago converted to a belief in the Mormon faith, and I now altogether hold to it. My people in the North are believers also in Mormonism, and it is my wish that all the Maori should be of that faith.&quot;

Although the LDS Church has no record of Tāwhiao being baptized, other Māori joined the church based on a prophecy they claimed Tāwhiao made in the 1860s—that messengers of God would come from over the Sea of Kiwa (the Pacific Ocean), travelling in pairs and teaching the Māori people in their own language. When some who heard Tāwhiao&#x27;s prophecy observed pairs of Mormon missionaries from the United States teaching in Māori language, they immediately accepted Mormonism.

It was also claimed by some Māori converts that Tāwhiao accurately predicted the site of the LDS Church&#x27;s Hamilton New Zealand Temple, which was built in 1958.

There is little direct contemporary evidence of Tāwhiao being a convert to Mormonism. The widely published accounts of his tangihanga make no mention of Mormonism but speak instead of &quot;native priests.&quot; or tohunga. What is beyond doubt, however, is that he and other Māori leaders of the time did meet with Mormon missionaries.
==Family==
Tāwhiao had nine children with his three wives and other women. His main wife was Hera Ngāpora, daughter of his advisor Tāmati Ngāpora and his cousin. Their children were:
*Tiahuia Tāwhiao (1850–1898). Maori Princess, had descendants, including Te Puea Hērangi.
*Mahuta Tāwhiao (1855–1912). 3rd Maori King, had descendants.
*Te Rata Tāwhiao (1857–1900). Maori Prince.
*Tāwhiao Te Wherowhero (1860–1911). Maori Prince Regent.

His second wife was called Rangiaho Taimana, and they had two children:
*Pokaia Tāwhiao (1844–1927). Maori Prince, had descendants.
*Haunui Tāwhiao (1882–1945). Maori Prince, had descendants.

His third wife was Aotea Te Paratene, also a cousin. They had only one daughter:
*Te Aouru Puahaere Te Popoke Tāwhiao (1856–1920). Maori Princess, had descendants.

He had a lover, Hinepau Tamamotu, daughter of a Maori Leader. They had two daughters:
*Irihapeti Peeti Te Paea Tāwhiao (1850–1900). Maori Princess, had descendants.
*Hui Hui Tāwhiao (1851–1910). Maori Princess, had descendants.

<text>In mathematics, the Laplace transform is a powerful integral transform used to switch a function from the time domain to the s-domain. The Laplace transform can be used in some cases to solve linear differential equations with given initial conditions.

First consider the following property of the Laplace transform:

:formula_1

:formula_2

One can prove by induction that

:formula_3

Now we consider the following differential equation:

:formula_4

with given initial conditions

:formula_5

Using the linearity of the Laplace transform it is equivalent to rewrite the equation as

:formula_6

obtaining

:formula_7

Solving the equation for formula_8 and substituting formula_9 with formula_10 one obtains

:formula_11

The solution for &quot;f&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is obtained by applying the inverse Laplace transform to formula_12

Note that if the initial conditions are all zero, i.e.

:formula_13

then the formula simplifies to

:formula_14

==An example==
We want to solve

:formula_15
with initial conditions &quot;f&quot;(0) = 0 and &quot;f′&quot;(0)=0.

We note that

:formula_16

and we get

:formula_17

The equation is then equivalent to

:formula_18

We deduce

:formula_19

Now we apply the Laplace inverse transform to get

:formula_20

<text>Biggar is a town in central Saskatchewan, Canada. It is on Highway 14, west of Saskatoon.

Biggar has become well known for its unusual town slogan, an Olympic athlete, and a world-record deer. The town was featured on American morning newsmagazine &quot;The Today Show&quot; in February 2010 as part of an ongoing Canadian-oriented segment during the 2010 Winter Olympics.

==History==
Biggar was incorporated as a village in 1909. It was named after William Hodgins Biggar, general counsel of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway (GTP), which had come through the area in 1908. Prior to that, the major means of transportation was via the nearby Swift Current-Battleford Trail. The GTP made Biggar a divisional point on its line, building a large station and roundhouse. The population grew as Biggar became a home terminal where train crews were changed.

In 1911 Biggar was incorporated as a town. Settlement continued and the population increased to greater than 2,000 by the mid-1920s, peaking at 2,755 in 1966. According to the 2011 census, Biggar is now home to 2,161 people.

The town is known for its slogan &quot;New York is big, but this is Biggar.&quot; It was created in 1914 by a survey crew who painted it onto a town sign as a drunken prank. According to The Biggar Museum and Gallery, the graffiti remained unchanged until 1954 when the slogan was officially adopted.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Biggar had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.
==Economy==
The Biggar railway station was constructed in 1909–1910 and is serviced by Via Rail, with &quot;The Canadian&quot; serving the station four times a week (twice going east, twice going west). Biggar&#x27;s prosperity was directly tied to the railway for many years. Up to 500 local people were at one time employed by Canadian National Railway (CN), which took over the GTP. That number has now dropped to under 200. As the railway industry has decreased, Biggar has shifted its economy to agriculture and related industries.

Biggar is home to Prairie Malt Limited, a large barley processing plant. The malthouse has an annual capacity of 220,000 metric tonnes. Malt is a primary ingredient in beer and whisky. Prairie Malt employs approximately 70 full-time employees. It creates significant spin-off employment among local trucking firms such as Biggar Transport, with a fleet of over 50 trucks.

, the Town of Biggar listed more than 150 businesses and services on its website. These included a manufacturer of petroleum and hazardous material containment tanks, a sodium sulphate plant, a large greenhouse and a variety of financial, farm and health services.
==Education==
Two school divisions operate in Biggar.

;Current schools 
The public school is Biggar Central 2000, a kindergarten to grade twelve school a part of Sun West School Division. Greater Saskatoon Catholic Schools operates St. Gabriel School, a Catholic kindergarten to grade nine school.

Great Plains College offers post-secondary certificates and diplomas in nursing, emergency medical technician, electrician and truck driving.

;Former schools
* Biggar&#x27;s original classroom was on the second floor of the Biggar Hotel (2 Jan 1910 – May 1910) while Biggar Public School was being built.
* Biggar Public School was built in 1910, and was demolished in 1962.
* Thornton School was built in 1924, demolished in 1972.

== Parks and recreation ==
Biggar has several recreational facilities and parks in and around town. There is an ice rink, curling rink, ball diamonds, and aquatic centre. About one kilometre north of town is Biggar &amp; District Regional Park, which has a campground and golf course.

== Notable people ==
* Coldwell, James (Major) Biggar elected Major James Coldwell, the leader of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, as their Member of Parliament from 1935 to 1958. He was noted as the person that fought for and won old-age pensions, as well as other social democratic reforms in both the William Lyon Mackenzie-King and Louis St. Laurent governments.
* Cutler, David – Longtime Edmonton Eskimos kicker Dave Cutler was born in Biggar.
* Schmirler, Sandra – Biggar is the hometown of Sandra Schmirler, a 1998 Olympic gold medalist and three-time world champion in women&#x27;s curling. Schmirler died in 2000 at the age of 36 of cancer. Her funeral was broadcast nationally by CBC Television and TSN, a first for a Canadian athlete. Biggar honoured Schmirler&#x27;s contributions to sport and her hometown by constructing the Sandra Schmirler Olympic Gold Park, which houses a gazebo, playground, memorial and wall of fame.
* Weekes, Randall (Randy) Percival – Canadian politician. Member of the Saskatchewan Legislative Assembly (1999 – ) Born in Biggar (1956).

==Government==
Biggar&#x27;s current mayor is Jim Rickwood. The town of Biggar is within the Rural Municipality of Biggar No. 347. Provincially, Biggar is represented by MLA Randy Weekes of the Saskatchewan Party. Federally the town is within the riding of Carlton Trail-Eagle Creek, whose current MP is Kelly Block of the Conservative Party of Canada.

==Climate==
Biggar experiences a humid continental (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;).

The highest temperature ever recorded in Biggar was on 4 July 1937, 24 June 1941, and 6 August 1949. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on 16 February 1936.

<doc id="350835" wikidata="Q614239" url="?curid=350835" title="Software protection dongle">
<text>A software protection dongle (commonly known as a dongle or key) is an electronic copy protection and content protection device. When connected to a computer or other electronics, they unlock software functionality or decode content. The hardware key is programmed with a product key or other cryptographic protection mechanism and functions via an electrical connector to an external bus of the computer or appliance.

In software protection, dongles are two-interface security tokens with transient data flow with a pull communication that reads security data from the dongle. In the absence of these dongles, certain software may run only in a restricted mode, or not at all. In addition to software protection, dongles can enable functions in electronic devices, such as receiving and processing encoded video streams on television sets.
==Etymology==
The Merriam-Webster dictionary states that the &quot;First known use of dongle&quot; was in 1981 and that the etymology was &quot;perhaps [an] alteration of dangle.&quot;

Dongles rapidly evolved into active devices that contained a serial transceiver (UART) and even a microprocessor to handle transactions with the host. Later versions adopted the USB interface, which became the preferred choice over the serial or parallel interface.

A 1992 advertisement for Rainbow Technologies claimed the word dongle was derived from the name &quot;Don Gall&quot;. Though untrue, this has given rise to an urban myth.

== Usage ==

Efforts to introduce dongle copy-protection in the mainstream software market have met stiff resistance from users. Such copy-protection is more typically used with very expensive packages and vertical market software such as CAD/CAM software, cellphone flasher/JTAG debugger software, MICROS Systems hospitality and special retail software, digital audio workstation applications, and some translation memory packages.

In cases such as prepress and printing software, the dongle is encoded with a specific, per-user license key, which enables particular features in the target application. This is a form of tightly controlled licensing, which allows the vendor to engage in vendor lock-in and charge more than it would otherwise for the product. An example is the way Kodak licenses Prinergy to customers: When a computer-to-plate output device is sold to a customer, Prinergy&#x27;s own license cost is provided separately to the customer, and the base price contains little more than the required licenses to output work to the device.

USB dongles are also a big part of Steinberg&#x27;s audio production and editing systems, such as Cubase, WaveLab, Hypersonic, HALion, and others. The dongle used by Steinberg&#x27;s products is also known as a Steinberg Key. The Steinberg Key can be purchased separately from its counterpart applications and generally comes bundled with the &quot;Syncrosoft License Control Center&quot; application, which is cross-platform compatible with both Mac OS X and Windows.

Some software developers use traditional USB flash drives as software license dongles that contain hardware serial numbers in conjunction with the stored device ID strings, which are generally not easily changed by an end-user. A developer can also use the dongle to store user settings or even a complete &quot;portable&quot; version of the application. Not all flash drives are suitable for this use, as not all manufacturers install unique serial numbers into their devices.

Although such medium security may deter a casual hacker, the lack of a processor core in the dongle to authenticate data, perform encryption/decryption, and execute inaccessible binary code makes such a passive dongle inappropriate for all but the lowest-priced software. A simpler and even less secure option is to use unpartitioned or unallocated storage in the dongle to store license data. Common USB flash drives are relatively inexpensive compared to dedicated security dongle devices, but reading and storing data in a flash drive are easy to intercept, alter, and bypass.

===Issues===
There are potential weaknesses in the implementation of the protocol between the dongle and the copy-controlled software. For example, a simple implementation might define a function to check for the dongle&#x27;s presence, returning &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot; accordingly, but the dongle requirement can be easily circumvented by modifying the software to always answer &quot;true&quot;.

Modern dongles include built-in strong encryption and use fabrication techniques designed to thwart reverse engineering. Typical dongles also now contain non-volatile memory — essential parts of the software may actually be stored and executed on the dongle. Thus dongles have become secure cryptoprocessors that execute program instructions that may be input to the cryptoprocessor only in encrypted form. The original secure cryptoprocessor was designed for copy protection of personal computer software (see US Patent 4,168,396, Sept 18, 1979) to provide more security than dongles could then provide. See also bus encryption.

Hardware cloning, where the dongle is emulated by a device driver, is also a threat to traditional dongles. To thwart this, some dongle vendors adopted smart card product, which is widely used in extremely rigid security requirement environments such as military and banking, in their dongle products.

A more innovative modern dongle is designed with a code porting process which transfers encrypted parts of the software vendor&#x27;s program code or license enforcement into a secure hardware environment (such as in a smart card OS, mentioned above). An ISV can port thousands of lines of important computer program code into the dongle.

In addition, dongles have been criticized because as they are hardware, they are easily lost and prone to damage, potentially increasing operational costs such as device cost and delivery cost.

==Game consoles==
Some unlicensed titles for game consoles (such as &quot;Super 3D Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot; or &quot;Little Red Hood&quot;) used dongles to connect to officially licensed ROM cartridges, in order to circumvent the authentication chip embedded in the console.

Some cheat code devices, such as the GameShark and Action Replay use a dongle. Typically it attaches to the memory card slot of the system, with the disc based software refusing to work if the dongle is not detected. The dongle is also used for holding settings and storage of new codes, added either by the user or through official updates, because the disc, being read only, cannot store them. Some dongles will also double as normal memory cards.

<doc id="350837" wikidata="Q376747" url="?curid=350837" title="James Harlan (Iowa politician)">
<text>James Harlan (August 26, 1820 – October 5, 1899) was an attorney and politician, a member of the United States Senate, a U.S. Cabinet Secretary at the United States Department of Interior under President Andrew Johnson, and a Federal Judge.

==Early life==
Harlan was born on August 26, 1820, in Clark County, Illinois, and raised in Indiana. He was the son of Silas Harlan (1792–1868) and Mary (née Connolly) Harlan (1796–1896).

As a boy, Harlan attended local schools before graduating from Indiana Asbury University (now DePauw University) in 1845.

==Career==
In 1845, he moved to Iowa City, Iowa, where he served as Superintendent of Schools. He also studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1850. He joined the Whig Party and became active in politics. In 1850, Harlan declined the Whig nomination for Governor of Iowa. From 1853 to 1855, Harlan was president of Iowa Wesleyan College in Mount Pleasant, Iowa.

===First Senate tenure===
In 1855, Harlan was elected by the Iowa legislature to the United States Senate as a Free Soil Party candidate. In 1857, the U.S. Senate declared the seat vacant because of irregularities in that legislative election. He was re-elected by the legislature and seated as a Republican, serving until 1865. In 1861, Harlan was a Delegate to the Peace Conference that tried to arrange a compromise to prevent the American Civil War.

===Secretary of the Interior===
Harlan was a close friend of President Abraham Lincoln and his family. In 1865, after Lincoln&#x27;s assassination, he resigned from the Senate when he was appointed as Secretary of the Interior under President Andrew Johnson, an appointment he held until 1866. As secretary he announced that he intended to &quot;clean house&quot; and fired &quot;a considerable number of incumbents who were seldom at their respective desks&quot;. He had done so after requesting, in late May 1865, a report listing all employees who (1.) uttered disloyal statements since the bombardment of Fort Sumter, (2.) all those not known to entertain loyal sentiments or who had associated with those known to be disloyal, (3.) those who were inefficient or not necessary to transact public business, (4.) all such persons &quot;as disregard in their conduct, habits, and associations, the rules of decorum, [and] propriety proscribed by a christian civilization.&quot;

Among this group was the poet Walt Whitman, then working as a clerk in the department, who received his dismissal note on June 30, 1865. Harlan had found a copy of &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; on Whitman&#x27;s desk as the poet was making revisions and found it to be morally offensive. &quot;I will not have the author of that book in this Department&quot;, he said. &quot;If the President of the United States should order his reinstatement, I would resign sooner than I would put him back.&quot; Twenty-nine years later, Harlan defended his firing of Whitman, saying that the clerk was dismissed solely &quot;on the grounds that his services were not needed&quot;.

Harlan was a member of the Southern Treaty Commission that renegotiated treaties with Indian Tribes that had sided with the Confederacy, such as the Cherokee and Choctaw. As part of the new treaties, they had to emancipate their slaves, as was being done by amendment within the United States, and offer them full citizenship in the tribes if they chose to stay in Indian Territory. If they left, the freedmen would become United States citizens. (Membership issues related to the Cherokee Freedmen and Choctaw Freedmen have become significant since the late 20th century.) Harlan resigned from the post in 1866 when he no longer supported the policies of President Johnson.

===Second Senate tenure===
In 1867, he was elected again by the Iowa legislature to the United States Senate and served until the end of his term in January 1873. During his senate service, Harlan was chairman of the committees of Public Lands; District of Columbia; Education; and Indian Affairs.

===Later career===
Harlan was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1872, and was also an unsuccessful candidate for governor in 1895. After his Senate career ended, Harlan turned a previous house of his into the Harlan House Hotel.

From 1882 to 1886, Harlan was appointed by President Chester A. Arthur as presiding judge for the Court of Commissioners, which heard cases related to the Alabama claims.

==Personal life==
On November 5, 1845, Harlan was married to Ann Eliza Peck (1824–1884) by President Matthew Simpson, who later became a bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Ann was the daughter of James Peck and Eunice (née Knight) Peck, both of whom died during Cholera epidemic of 1832. Together, Ann and James were the parents of:

* Mary Eunice Harlan (1846–1937), who married Lincoln&#x27;s son Robert Todd Lincoln in 1868. The couple lived during the summers at Harlan&#x27;s home in Mount Pleasant.
* Silas James Harlan (1850–1850), who died in infancy.
* William Aaron Harlan (1852–1876), who was a close friend of Tad Lincoln.
* Julia Josephine Harlan (1856–1862), who died young.

Harlan died on October 5, 1899, at his hotel in Mount Pleasant, which become his residence in the early 1890s.

===Legacy===
Harlan&#x27;s residence, today known as the Harlan-Lincoln House, has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Operated as a house museum, it exhibits memorabilia from both the Harlan and Lincoln families. The Harlan House Hotel is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

A commemorative sculpture of Harlan resided in the United States Capitol, along with one of pioneer Iowa Governor Samuel Kirkwood (each state may install two statues for display in the Capitol). The Harlan statue was located in the Hall of Columns until it was replaced in 2014 by a statue of Norman Borlaug. The Harlan statue is now on display at Iowa Wesleyan College.

The city of Harlan, Iowa, in Shelby County was named for him.

<doc id="350841" wikidata="Q220918" url="?curid=350841" title="Emilio Estevez">
<text>Emilio Estevez (; born May 12, 1962) is an American actor and filmmaker.

He is the son of actor Martin Sheen and the older brother of Charlie Sheen. Estevez made his theatrical film debut in drama film &quot;Tex&quot; (1982). As one of the actors associated with Brat Pack, he is notable for starring in coming-of-age drama films such as &quot;The Outsiders&quot; (1983), &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; (1985), &quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire&quot; (1985), as well as the cult science fiction / comedy film &quot;Repo Man&quot; (1984). He subsequently starred in films in various genres such as &quot;Judgment Night&quot; (1993), &quot;Loaded Weapon 1&quot; (1993), and &quot;&quot; (1996). Estevez also starred in three film franchises: &quot;Stakeout&quot; (1987) and its 1993 sequel, &quot;Young Guns&quot; (1988) and its 1990 sequel, and &quot;The Mighty Ducks&quot; (1992–1996; 2021).

Estevez made his directorial debut with the drama film &quot;Wisdom&quot; (1986) and also directed the comedy film &quot;Men at Work&quot; (1990). Since mid-1990s, Estevez starred mostly in the films he directed such as &quot;The War at Home&quot; (1996), &quot;Rated X&quot; (2000), &quot;Bobby&quot; (2006) and &quot;The Way&quot; (2010). For his work on &quot;Bobby&quot;, he was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award.

==Early life==
Estevez was born in Staten Island, the eldest child of artist Janet Sheen and actor Martin Sheen (legally Ramón Estévez). His siblings are Ramon Estevez, Charlie Sheen (born Carlos Estévez), and Renée Estevez. Estevez&#x27;s paternal grandparents were Irish and Spanish immigrants. His father is a &quot;devout Catholic&quot; and his mother is a &quot;strict Southern Baptist&quot;.

Estevez initially attended school in the New York City public school system but transferred to a private academy once his father&#x27;s career took off. He lived on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper West Side until his family moved west in 1968 when his father was cast in &quot;Catch-22&quot;. Growing up in Malibu, California, Estevez attended Santa Monica High School.

When Estevez was 11 years old, his father bought the family a portable movie camera. Estevez also appeared in &quot;Meet Mr. Bomb&quot;, a short anti-nuclear power film produced at his high school. Estevez was 14 when he accompanied his father to the Philippines, where Sheen was shooting &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;. Estevez had a role as an extra in &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, but his scenes were deleted.

When they returned to Los Angeles, Estevez co-wrote and starred in a high school play about Vietnam veterans called &quot;Echoes of an Era&quot; and invited his parents to watch it. Sheen recalls being astonished by his son&#x27;s performance, and &quot;began to realize: my God, he&#x27;s one of us.&quot; After graduating from Santa Monica High School in 1980, he refused to go to college and instead went into acting. Unlike his brother Charlie, Estevez and his other siblings did not adopt their father&#x27;s stage name. Emilio reportedly liked the alliteration of the double &#x27;E&#x27; initials, and &quot;didn&#x27;t want to ride into the business as &#x27;Martin Sheen&#x27;s son&#x27;.&quot; Upon his brother&#x27;s using his birth name Carlos Estevez for the film &quot;Machete Kills&quot;, Estevez mentioned that he was proud of his Spanish heritage and was glad that he never adopted a stage name, taking advice from his father who regretted adopting the name Martin Sheen as opposed to using his birth name, Ramón Estévez.

==Career==
His first role was in a drama produced by the Catholic Paulist order. Soon after, he made his stage debut with his father in &quot;Mister Roberts&quot; at Burt Reynolds&#x27; dinner theater in Jupiter, Florida (this was the only job his father ever placed him in). Later, father and son worked together in the 1982 ABC-TV film about juveniles in jail, &quot;In the Custody of Strangers&quot;, in which Estevez did the casting.

===Brat Pack years===
Estevez received much attention during the 1980s for being a member of the Brat Pack and was credited as the leader of the group of young actors. Estevez and Rob Lowe established the Brat Pack when cast as supporting &quot;Greasers&quot; in an early Brat Pack movie, &quot;The Outsiders&quot; based on the novel. Lowe was cast as C. Thomas Howell&#x27;s older brother Sodapop and Estévez as Two-Bit Mathews. During production, he approached his character as a laid-back guy and thought up Two-Bit&#x27;s interest in Mickey Mouse, shown by his uniform of Mickey Mouse T-shirts and watching of cartoons.

Besides his roles in &quot;In the Custody of Strangers&quot; and &quot;The Outsiders&quot;, his credits include NBC-TV&#x27;s thrillers &quot;Nightmares&quot; and &quot;Tex&quot;, the 1982 film version of another S.E. Hinton story. He bought the movie rights to a third Hinton book, &quot;That Was Then, This Is Now&quot;, and wrote the screenplay. His father predicted he would have to direct to feel the full extent of his talents, describing him as &quot;an officer, not a soldier.&quot;

After &quot;The Outsiders&quot;, Estevez appeared as the punk-rocker turned car-repossessor Otto Maddox in the film &quot;Repo Man&quot; before co-starring in &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; and &quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire&quot;. Following the success of these back-to-back Brat Pack films, he starred in &quot;That Was Then, This Is Now&quot; (which he co-wrote), the horror film &quot;Maximum Overdrive&quot; (for which he was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award), and the crime drama &quot;Wisdom&quot; (with fellow Brat Packer Demi Moore). Estevez was originally cast in &quot;Platoon&quot; to be Private Chris Taylor but was forced to drop out after production was delayed for two years; the role eventually went to his younger brother Charlie Sheen. He went on to lead roles in the comedy/action film &quot;Stakeout&quot; and the westerns &quot;Young Guns&quot; and &quot;Young Guns II&quot;.

===1990–present===
In the early 1990s, Estevez directed, wrote, and starred with his brother Charlie in a comedy about garbagemen, &quot;Men at Work&quot;. Estevez later stated, &quot;People come up to me on the street and say, &quot;Men at Work&quot; is the funniest movie I ever saw in my life. But, you know, I do have to question how many movies these people have seen.&quot;

In 1992, he found the career longevity that escaped other Brat Packers by starring in &quot;The Mighty Ducks&quot; as Coach Gordon Bombay, a lawyer and former pee wee star and minor hockey prodigy looking to forget the past, forced into coaching a pee wee hockey team as a form of community service. The film turned out to be one of Disney&#x27;s most successful franchises. It was followed by two sequels. The following year Estevez starred in three films: the dark thriller &quot;Judgment Night&quot;, the spoof comedy &quot;Loaded Weapon 1&quot; in which his brother Charlie Sheen has a cameo, and comedy/action film &quot;Another Stakeout&quot;, which was the sequel to his earlier film &quot;Stakeout&quot;.

Estevez has acted alongside his father several times. He starred in (and directed) the 1996 &quot;The War at Home&quot; in which he played a Vietnam War veteran dealing with posttraumatic stress disorder, while Martin Sheen played his unsympathetic father.

Estevez appeared in an uncredited role in the feature film &quot;&quot;. From 1998 to 1999, he appeared in three television films: the spaghetti Western &quot;Dollar for the Dead&quot; (1998), the comedy &quot;Late Last Night&quot; (1999), and &quot;Rated X&quot; (2000), which he directed. In 2000, Estevez starred in the Moxie! Award-winning thriller &quot;Sand&quot; as part of an ensemble cast that also included Denis Leary, Jon Lovitz, Harry Dean Stanton, and Julie Delpy.

In 2003, he made his voice acting debut when he helped create the English dubbed version of &quot;The 3 Wise Men&quot; with his father. Later, Estevez starred in &quot;The L.A. Riot Spectacular&quot; and voiced the English version of the film &quot;Arthur and the Invisibles&quot;. In 2008, he guest-starred on his brother&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; as an old friend of Charlie Sheen&#x27;s character. (His father Martin Sheen had also guest-starred in 2005.)

In an interview a month after the 2010 Oscar tribute to John Hughes he explained his absence as publicity shyness: &quot;I&#x27;ve never been a guy that went out there to get publicity on myself. I never saw the value in it.&quot;

In 2017, his appearance in films was found to generate the highest return on investment (ROI) on average of all Hollywood actors.

Estevez reprised his role as Coach Gordon Bombay in the 2021 Disney+ TV series, &quot;The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers&quot;. It was reported in November 2021 that Estevez would not return in the show&#x27;s second season due to a contract dispute and creative differences.

===Directing career===
Aside from acting, Estevez has also directed television shows and motion pictures. He made his directorial debut with the 1986 film &quot;Wisdom&quot;, which made Estevez the youngest actor ever to write, direct, and star in a single major motion picture. Most recently he has directed episodes of the television series &quot;Cold Case&quot;, &quot;Close to Home&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Numb3rs&quot;. The films he has directed include &quot;Men at Work&quot; and &quot;The War at Home&quot;.

He directed the 2006 film &quot;Bobby&quot;, which took over six years to write. Producing the film nearly bankrupted him as the domestic box office gross was not able to cover production costs. The movie gained him fans outside the US, mainly in Europe. He won a Hollywood Film Award and received a seven-minute standing ovation at the Venice Film Festival.

In 2010, Estevez filmed a new project, &quot;The Way&quot;, in Spain where he directed his father in a story about a man who decides to make the Camino de Santiago after the death of his son in the French Pyrénées. It was released in the United States on October 7, 2011.

In 2018, Estevez released &quot;The Public&quot;, a film featuring Estevez himself as writer, director, and cast member. The film, also starring Alec Baldwin, Christian Slater, and Jena Malone, premiered worldwide at the Toronto International Film Festival.
===Music videos===
Estevez appeared in John Parr&#x27;s &quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire (Man in Motion)&quot; music video, from the soundtrack of his film with the same name, where he played Kirby Keger. The music video featured all seven of the main cast members of the film, looking sadly through the foggy windows of a run-down and fire-damaged version of the St. Elmo&#x27;s Bar set.

Estevez is a close friend of Jon Bon Jovi. He appeared in Bon Jovi&#x27;s music video &quot;Blaze of Glory&quot; as Billy the Kid. In turn, Bon Jovi made a cameo appearance in &quot;Young Guns II&quot;. &quot;Blaze of Glory&quot; was in the &quot;Young Guns II&quot; soundtrack and was nominated for an Academy Award. In 2000, Estevez made an appearance in another Bon Jovi video, &quot;Say It Isn&#x27;t So&quot;, along with Matt LeBlanc, Claudia Schiffer, and Arnold Schwarzenegger.

==Personal life==
In the early 1980s, Estevez dated actress Mimi Rogers. He was involved off and on with Carey Salley, a Wilhelmina model. They have a son and a daughter. Their relationship overlapped with Estevez&#x27;s high-profile engagement to Demi Moore, whom he was with intermittently from 1984 to 1986. In 1986, Salley filed a $2 million paternity suit against Estevez. Estevez acknowledged paternity of Salley&#x27;s children on June 1, 1987.

On April 29, 1992, Estevez married singer-choreographer Paula Abdul. They filed for divorce in May 1994, with Abdul later stating that the reason for the divorce was that she wanted children while Estevez, who already had two children, did not.

Estevez has stated that his religion is a &quot;work in progress&quot;. He has said &quot;film is an illusion, fame is ephemeral, faith and family are what will endure.&quot;

<text>Rodney District was a local government area in the northernmost part of New Zealand&#x27;s Auckland Region from 1989 to 2010. It included Kawau Island. It was created from the amalgamation of Helensville Borough and Rodney County in 1989. The seat of Rodney District Council was at Orewa. Rodney District and Rodney County each took their names from Cape Rodney (opposite Little Barrier Island), which Captain James Cook named on 24 November 1769 after Admiral Sir George Brydges Rodney.

Auckland Council has governed the area since 1 November 2010. The Rodney ward of the Auckland Region now covers much of the land area, but not the Hibiscus Coast or the former council seat of Orewa, which are in the Albany ward.

The district was, in the final electoral term (2007–2010) of its existence, led by mayor Penny Webster and 12 councillors.

==Mayors==
During its 21-year existence, Rodney District had four mayors:

<doc id="350844" wikidata="Q1418248" url="?curid=350844" title="Queer Eye (2003 TV series)">
<text>Queer Eye is an American reality television series that premiered on the Bravo network in July 2003, initially broadcast as Queer Eye for the Straight Guy. The series was created by executive producers David Collins and Michael Williams along with David Metzler through their company, Scout Productions. Each episode features a team of gay professionals in the fields of fashion, personal grooming, interior design, entertaining, and culture collectively known as the &quot;Fab Five&quot; performing a makeover (in the parlance of the show, a &quot;make-better&quot;): revamping wardrobe, redecorating, and offering lifestyle advice.

&quot;Queer Eye for the Straight Guy&quot; quickly became a surprise success, winning an Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality Program in 2004, with subsequent merchandising, international franchising of the concept, and a woman-oriented spin-off, &quot;Queer Eye for the Straight Girl&quot;. The series name was abbreviated to &quot;Queer Eye&quot; at the beginning of its third season to include making over individuals regardless of gender or sexual orientation.

&quot;Queer Eye&quot; ended production in June 2006 and the final episode aired October 30, 2007. During September 2008, the Fine Living Network briefly aired &quot;Queer Eye&quot; in syndication. The series was also run again by the CBS-affiliated Twist network in 2023.

Netflix revived the series in 2018 with a new Fab Five.

==Format==
The majority of &quot;Queer Eye&quot; episodes use the same basic format. The episode begins with the Fab Five in an SUV (usually in New York City, where the series was based) discussing their heterosexual client. The Five review details of the subject&#x27;s personal life and note problems in their various areas of expertise. The Five usually have a specific event for which they plan to prepare the client. These included everything from throwing a backyard barbecue for friends to preparing to ask for a salary increase to proposing marriage.

Upon arriving at the subject&#x27;s home, the Fab Five go through his belongings, performing a running commentary of catty remarks about the state of his wardrobe, home decor, cleanliness, and grooming. They also speak with the subject and family members to get an idea of the sort of style they like and their goals for the experience and to discuss the planned event.
The remainder of the first half of the episode follows the Fab Five as they escort the subject to various locales to select new furniture and clothes. Often, Ted demonstrates how to select and prepare food for a particular dish that the subject will prepare for the special event, and Kyan takes him for spa treatments and a new haircut. Each such segment includes a style tip superimposed on the screen, summarizing the style issues addressed in the segment. Interspersed with this are interview segments in which friends and family members of the subject discuss his style issues.

In the next section, the subject returns to a completely redecorated home and models articles of his new wardrobe for the Fab Five. Each of the Five offer final words of advice and encouragement, accompanied by supplies of grooming products, food and kitchenware, and in some cases expensive electronics items such as entertainment centers and computers.

The final section follows the subject as he prepares for the special event, with the Fab Five watching edited footage of his preparations and critiquing how well or how poorly he followed their advice. Finally, the subject is followed through the event itself, with the Five again performing a running commentary and the subject often expressing his deep gratitude to the Fab Five for their counsel. A final tip from each of the Fab Five, usually relating to one of the topics covered in the episode, plays just before the credits.

Special episodes of &quot;Queer Eye&quot; that deviated from this formula included episodes in which the Fab Five journeyed outside the greater New York area, including shows filmed in England, Texas, and Las Vegas. In two episodes, the Fab Five made over homosexual men (both of which aired during June, Gay Pride Month, during 2004 and 2006), and in one episode made over a transgender man. The show also featured makeovers of members of the Boston Red Sox after their 2004 World Series victory, several holiday specials, and, in the final season, a &quot;Mister Straight Guy&quot; pageant featuring subjects from the series&#x27; history.

===&quot;Fab Five&quot; experts===

* Ted Allen: &quot;Food and Wine Connoisseur&quot;, expert on alcohol, beverages, food preparation, and presentation
* Kyan Douglas: &quot;Grooming Guru&quot;, expert on hair, grooming, personal hygiene, and makeup
* Thom Filicia: &quot;Design Doctor&quot;, expert on interior design and home organization
* Carson Kressley: &quot;Fashion Savant&quot;, expert on clothing, fashion, and personal styling
* Jai Rodriguez: &quot;Culture Vulture&quot;, expert on popular culture, relationships and social interaction

==Production==
Producers Collins and Metzler were given approval by Bravo to develop &quot;Queer Eye&quot; after the ratings success the network experienced when it counterprogrammed a marathon of its 2002 series &quot;Gay Weddings&quot; at the same time as Super Bowl XXXVII during 2003 January. The pilot episode was filmed in Boston, Massachusetts during June 2002. Of the eventual Fab Five, only Kressley and Allen appeared. The culture, design, and grooming roles were filled by James Hannaham, Charles Daboub Jr., and Sam Spector, respectively.

The pilot was delivered to Bravo in September 2002 and was well received in audience testing. Soon thereafter, NBC purchased Bravo and ordered 12 episodes of the series. NBC promoted the show extensively, including billboard campaigns and print advertisements in national magazines.

Kyan Douglas and Thom Filicia joined the show for these episodes, along with Blair Boone in the role of &quot;culture guy&quot;. Boone filmed two episodes (which were broadcast as the second and third episodes and for which he was credited as a &quot;guest culture expert&quot;) but was replaced by Rodriguez beginning with production of the third episode. Each episode was shot over a span of four days and edited to create the perception that the events of the episode took place in a single day.

==Series overview==

==Broadcast history and release==
The series aired alongside &quot;Boy Meets Boy&quot; as part of Bravo&#x27;s gay programming block.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;Queer Eye for the Straight Guy&quot; debuted on July 15, 2003, and the series quickly attained high ratings, peaking during September of that year with 3.34 million viewers per episode. The popularity of the series established the Fab Five as media celebrities, with high-profile appearances at the Emmys and a &quot;make-better&quot; of Jay Leno and his &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; set in August of that year. The members parlayed their statuses into endorsement deals, most notably when Thom Filicia became the spokesperson for Pier 1 Imports.

American press reviews were largely positive. &quot;Out&quot; magazine listed the Fab Five in its &quot;OUT 100&quot;, the &quot;greatest gay success stories&quot; of 2003. &quot;Instinct&quot; magazine declared Kressley one of the &quot;Leading Men&quot; of 2004.

The series attracted criticism for making generalizations about sexual identity, often objecting to ideas that homosexual men are inherently more fashionable and stylish than heterosexuals. Among those making this critique were Tom Shales in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; (&quot;stereotypes on parade&quot;), Richard Goldstein in &quot;Village Voice&quot; (&quot;Haven&#x27;t fags always been consigned to the role of body servant?&quot;) and United States Congressman Barney Frank speaking to the &quot;New York Post&quot;. Author Gustavus Stadler presents similar critiques of &quot;Queer Eye&quot; emphasizing the expectation placed on homosexual men by society. &quot;Queer Eye,&quot; Stadler claims, is an example of an unrealistic world in which all queer men are fashionable, hip, witty, and very much enjoy helping a straight man to reach their straight potential. Similarly, Stadler claims this is why heterosexual men find enjoyment in watching &quot;Queer Eye&quot;, as they envy the &quot;simple&quot; imaginary gay lifestyle held by queer men; a life free from divorce rates, children, and demanding jobs. Anthropologist Lionel Tiger criticized the show&#x27;s portrayal of heterosexual men: &quot;Heteromales are the last group it is acceptable to bash as a class. The homosexual fellows on &quot;Queer Eye&quot; seem to provide riveting hilarity to especially female viewers. What if there were 5 Swedes telling Kenyans how to live elegantly and fashionably? What if 5 Catholics told Jews how to dress, decorate, and court? The program is degraded and degrading&quot;.

Before same-sex marriage was legalized throughout the United States, there was a study on the distribution of attitudes about gay marriage from residents in Louisiana, Arizona, and Minnesota. Reportedly in this study, 60.9% disagreed with gay marriage with the &quot;intensity of disagreement also stronger for those who disagree compared to those who agree&quot;. While &quot;Queer Eye for the Straight Guy&quot; did last from 2003 to 2007, the attitudes of the U.S audience during these years might have had an effect on the show&#x27;s popularity during their airing.

With the success of the first season, original &quot;culture guy&quot; Blair Boone sued the show for breach of contract, claiming he should be paid not just for two episodes but for the season that he had been contracted to film.

The popularity of the series inspired a number of parodies. Comedy Central hosted a satirical television series named &quot;Straight Plan for the Gay Man&quot;, which featured four heterosexual men teaching homosexual men how to be more stereotypically straight, redecorating their homes with neon beer signs and teaching them about sports. &quot;South Park&quot; spoofed the show and its hosts in the episode &quot;South Park Is Gay!&quot;, in which the protagonists learn that the Fab Five are actually the disguises of evil Crab People aiming for world domination by converting heterosexual men into metrosexuals.

&quot;Queer Eye&quot; won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality Program during 2004 and was nominated for another Emmy in the same category during 2005. The series also received GLAAD Media Awards for Outstanding Reality Program during 2004 and 2005, and was nominated for a third during 2006.

In the second season, ratings decreased, averaging about 1.8 million viewers per episode with an average of 804,000 viewers in the important 18–40 demographic. Despite this, new episodes continued to be broadcast for two more seasons. After Bravo confirmed in early 2007 that &quot;Queer Eye&quot; had been cancelled, the remaining fifth-season episodes were billed as &quot;Queer Eye: The Final Season&quot; and aired twice weekly beginning October 2, 2007.

The show attracted more criticism than other similar television series from the same time period. James Keller asserts that the title itself seems to cross a boundary; gay men objectifying straight men. Keller also criticizes the exemplification of stereotypes on both sides; gay men who are effeminate, only pursuing artistic careers, while straight men are rude, uncultured and uncivilized.  The largest criticism from Keller to be that even if the stereotypes are correct, the show tended to take too simplistic of a view, relying on a sophisticated audience.

Joshua Gamson praised the series and its portrayal of gay men on television saying that it has &quot;produced a fascinating reversal of fortune&quot; where gay men are admired, and straight men are praised for being more like gay men.

===Cultural impact===
Creators David Collins and Michael Williams joined Vice President Kamala Harris in June 2024, alongside original and revival cast members, to discuss the series and franchise influence over two decades.

== Spin-offs ==
During January 2005, Scout Productions premiered the spin-off series &quot;Queer Eye for the Straight Girl&quot;, set in Los Angeles. It featured a cast of four lifestyle experts (three men and a woman, known as the &quot;Gal Pals&quot;) who performed makeovers for women. The show was cancelled after one season.

==International adaptations==
&quot;Queer Eye&quot;″s American success caused television networks in several countries to syndicate the American episodes, with a number of countries creating their own local versions of &quot;Queer Eye&quot; for broadcast in their countries. However, few of these homegrown versions have proven as successful as the original, and most did not last long before cancellation. Licensing of the format is managed by NBCUniversal.

NBCU licensed UK television production house vialondon.tv to produce local versions for Europe, with Flextech&#x27;s Living channel doing the same to produce the United Kingdom&#x27;s version after a first attempt at a UK production by &quot;Making Time&quot; was abandoned.

The first episode of the Finnish version, &quot;Sillä silmällä&quot;, created controversy for the blatant product placement considered to be a transgression of a Finnish law against surreptitious advertising.

===Soundtrack===


The soundtrack for &quot;Queer Eye for the Straight Guy&quot; was released February 10, 2004, in the USA. It reached number one on the electronic music chart, number two on the soundtrack charts and the top 40 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart. In Australia, the soundtrack was released for the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, and the popularity of the series in Australia resulted in the soundtrack scoring in the top 10 of the Australian album chart on March 8, 2004. It was certified gold in Australia in March 2004. The song &quot;Superstar&quot; by Jamelia from the soundtrack also went to number one on the Australian singles charts in the same week, and the theme song of the show, &quot;All Things (Just Keep Getting Better)&quot; by Widelife, went to the top 20 that month. &quot;All Things&quot; scored a 2005 Juno Award for &quot;Dance Recording of the Year&quot; for Widelife (Rachid Wehbi &amp; Ian Nieman). Rob Eric was the executive producer for the album.

==Revival==

Netflix ordered eight new episodes of &quot;Queer Eye&quot; in January 2017, to feature a new Fab Five. Scout Productions has contributed involvement with the revival, which trades the original New York setting for Georgia in the first two seasons, and Missouri in the third and fourth. The revival Fab Five are Bobby Berk (design), Karamo Brown (culture), Tan France (fashion), Antoni Porowski (food and wine), and Jonathan Van Ness (grooming). 

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the season holds an approval rating of 100% based on 13 reviews, and an average rating of 7.35/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Queer Eye&quot; adapts for a different era without losing its style, charm, or sense of fun, proving that the show&#x27;s formula remains just as sweetly addictive even after a change in location and a new group of hosts.&quot; On Metacritic, the season has a weighted average score of 73 out of 100, based on 7 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Following its success, Netflix has subsequently renewed it for seven seasons.

<doc id="350847" wikidata="Q1423849" url="?curid=350847" title="Reality Bites">
<text>Reality Bites is a 1994 American romantic comedy-drama film written by Helen Childress and directed by Ben Stiller in his feature directorial debut. It stars Winona Ryder, Ethan Hawke, and Stiller, with supporting roles by Janeane Garofalo and Steve Zahn. The film follows an aspiring videographer, working on a documentary about the disenchanted lives of her friends and roommates.

Childress wrote the initial screenplay on spec in 1990, inspired by the lives of her friends and herself during the U.S. economic recession in the early 1990s. Stiller was hired as director in 1991, but later starred in the film after working with Childress on the final screenplay, which was completed in December 1992. The film faced production delays until Ryder committed to the project, after which Hawke and Zahn were cast. Garofalo was fired during filming but returned after Ryder stepped in on her behalf. Principal photography lasted 42 days in 1993, with filming taking place in Houston and Los Angeles.

&quot;Reality Bites&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for the performances of Ryder, Hawke and Garofalo. It grossed $41 million worldwide. It appeared on some critics&#x27; year-end lists for 1994 and 1995 and has since gained cult status for its depiction of the early careers and young adult lifestyles of Generation X.

Four friends who are recent college graduates live together in Houston, Texas. Coffeehouse guitarist Troy Dyer and budding filmmaker Lelaina Pierce are attracted to each other, although they have not acted on their feelings except for one brief, drunken encounter years ago.

Troy is floundering, having lost several minimum-wage jobs—the last of which he loses for stealing a candy bar from his employer. Lelaina was valedictorian of her university and aspires to make documentaries, although initially has to settle for a position as production assistant to a rude and obnoxious TV host.

Lelaina meets Michael Grates when throwing a lit cigarette into his convertible causes him to crash into her car. They begin dating. He works as an executive at an MTV-like channel called In Your Face, and after seeing a documentary she has been working on, wants to get it aired on his network.

Lelaina&#x27;s roommate Vickie has a series of one-night stands and short relationships with dozens of men; her promiscuity leads her to face a very real risk of contracting HIV after a former fling tests positive for the virus. Working as a sales associate for the Gap, Vickie is later promoted to manager and is content with her new job. Her friend Sammy Gray is gay; he remains celibate, not due to a fear of AIDS, but because forming a relationship would force him to come out to his conservative parents.

After an impulsive act of retribution against her boss, Lelaina loses her job, which causes some tension with her roommates. Eventually, Vickie&#x27;s HIV test comes back negative and Sammy comes out to his parents (and he even starts dating) and the two manage to resume their lives.

Meanwhile, Lelaina&#x27;s relationship with Michael dissolves after he helps her sell the documentary to his network, only to let them edit it into a stylized montage that compromises her artistic vision. Lelaina and Troy have a heart-to-heart which leads to them sleeping together and confessing their feelings. The morning after, he avoids her, and after a messy confrontation, leaves town. When Troy&#x27;s father dies, it forces him to reevaluate his life, deciding to attempt a relationship with Lelaina.

Troy and Lelaina reunite and make amends once he returns from his father&#x27;s funeral in Chicago. While we do not see what happens to Michael, during the credits there is an abrupt break where two characters, &quot;Elaina&quot; and &quot;Roy&quot;, who are obvious parodies of Lelaina and Troy, have an argument about their relationship. As the &quot;show&#x27;s&quot; credits roll, Michael&#x27;s name is revealed as the creator, implying that he has turned the relationship between Lelaina and Troy into the subject of a new show on his network.

==Cast==

In addition to Garofalo, director Stiller gave cameos to Andy Dick (as a sleazy boss) and John F. O&#x27;Donohue (as a convenience store manager), both cast members of &quot;The Ben Stiller Show&quot;. Stiller also cast fellow &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; alumnus David Spade in an uncredited appearance as the manager during Lelaina&#x27;s job interview at Wienerschnitzel. Stiller&#x27;s girlfriend Jeanne Tripplehorn also makes an uncredited appearance, parodying Cindy Crawford and MTV&#x27;s show &quot;House of Style&quot;. Renée Zellweger appears as Tami, a one-night stand of Troy&#x27;s. Soul Asylum&#x27;s lead singer Dave Pirner and The Lemonheads&#x27; frontman Evan Dando also made cameos.

==Production==

=== Development ===
In 1991, producer Michael Shamberg had an idea to make a film about people in their twenties. He had read a screenplay entitled &quot;Blue Bayou&quot;, written by Helen Childress on spec in 1990. He liked it and met with her, and she proceeded to tell him about her life and friends, and their struggle to find work during a recession in the United States at the time. For three years, she wrote and rewrote &quot;Reality Bites&quot;, generating 70 different drafts. Childress decided to use her friends, their personalities and experiences as the basis for her film.

The film&#x27;s producers saw the pilot episode for &quot;The Ben Stiller Show&quot; and approached Stiller to direct it, but not act in it. He signed on to direct in 1992 and worked with Childress for nine to ten months developing the script. Initially, Childress, working with producer Stacey Sher, had figured out the characters of Lelaina and Troy, but could not come up with a credible character to complete the love triangle. Stiller suggested that he could play that third person. As a result, the Michael character changed from a 35-year-old advertising executive trying to market Japanese candy bars in America to a television executive in his twenties. They also changed the structure of the film. Originally, Vickie, Sammy and Troy had more fleshed out storylines, but Stiller felt that he could not tell them fully and decided to focus on the relationship between Lelaina and Troy.

By December 1992, Childress and Stiller had a script that was ready to be filmed for TriStar Pictures, but the studio put it into turnaround. Sher, Stiller and Childress managed to convince the Film Commission of Texas to fund a location scouting trip to Houston, despite no studio backing, no budget and no cast. The film had been turned down by all Hollywood studios because it tried to capture the Generation X market like &quot;Singles&quot;, which was not a box office success. When Sher, Stiller and Childress arrived in Houston, they received a phone call informing them that Winona Ryder had read the script, wanted to do it and that Universal Pictures had agreed to finance the film.

After completing several period pieces, Ryder was drawn to &quot;Reality Bites&quot; because she was looking &quot;for something a little more contemporary because I really wanted to wear blue jeans for a change&quot;. She read the script in one sitting while making &quot;The House of the Spirits&quot; and &quot;found it very true to life.&quot; She further speculated in an interview, &quot;I think my character is very close to what I would probably have ended up as if I hadn&#x27;t become an actress&quot;. Ethan Hawke was at this point unhappy with the direction his career was taking; the actor recalled that his career was in a lull after the buzz from &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot; had faded. Ryder was a fan of his work and stipulated in her contract that her involvement in the film was dependent on Hawke starring opposite her.

Janeane Garofalo knew Stiller from working together on &quot;The Ben Stiller Show&quot;, and the film&#x27;s producers felt that her style of comedy was perfect for the character of Vickie. She said that Parker Posey, Anne Heche, and Gwyneth Paltrow were all up for the role. The studio wanted Paltrow, but Ryder supported Garofalo for the role after making a connection with her. Before filming began, Garofalo was fired from the production because Stiller did not like her attitude during rehearsal. Garofalo was rehired after Ryder stepped in on her behalf. Garofalo stated later that she has a really poor work ethic and hates to rehearse. Stiller met Steve Zahn through Hawke, with whom Zahn was starring in a play, and he was impressed by how funny Zahn was. The actor went to Los Angeles, California, and tested for the film. He felt strongly about playing a gay character coming out of the closet.

According to Childress, the title of the film isn&#x27;t meant to be interpreted as &quot;reality sucks.&quot; During the run-up to the 1992 United States presidential election, Childress kept hearing references to &quot;sound bites,&quot; which made her think of Lelaina&#x27;s recorded vignettes of her friends as &quot;little bites of reality.&quot;

===Shooting===
Principal photography lasted 42 days, on a budget of $11.5 million. The filmmakers shot many of the exteriors in Houston (including a scene on top of the Two Shell Plaza building), where the film is set, but most of the interiors were shot in Los Angeles, because it was cheaper to do so there. During filming, Stiller encouraged Childress to be on location and talk with the actors about their characters.

==Soundtrack==

RCA met with the film&#x27;s music supervisor Karyn Rachtman, and Stiller, three weeks into filming, to discuss the soundtrack album. They finalized a deal and the label opened its roster to the director, who picked only one band: Me Phi Me. RCA aggressively marketed the album and had five tracks on rotation on radio and MTV. The video for Crowded House&#x27;s &quot;Locked Out&quot; was updated to include footage from the film. In addition, the video for &quot;Spin the Bottle&quot; by the Juliana Hatfield Three was directed by Stiller and featured clips from the film as well. The soundtrack sold 1.2 million units and reached #13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album also earned a No. 1 single with Lisa Loeb&#x27;s &quot;Stay (I Missed You)&quot;. The soundtrack peaked at number 2 in Australia and was certified platinum.

The film&#x27;s soundtrack includes songs by World Party, Squeeze, the Knack (a remixed version of &quot;My Sharona&quot; featured prominently in one scene from the film), Juliana Hatfield, Social Distortion, and two contributions from Crowded House (&quot;Locked Out&quot; and &quot;Something So Strong&quot;), in addition to the runaway hit &quot;Stay (I Missed You)&quot; by Lisa Loeb, which earned Loeb the distinction of being the first artist to top the Hot 100 before being signed to any record label and &quot;Baby I Love Your Way&quot; by Big Mountain. It also includes &quot;Conjunction Junction&quot; from &quot;Schoolhouse Rock!&quot;, another song brought into the foreground of a film full of pop culture references.

==Release==
&quot;Reality Bites&quot; went through four test screenings with a fairly decent reaction, before it premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 1994, and was theatrically released in the United States on February 18, 1994.

===Box office===
The film grossed $5.1 million in 1,149 theaters on its opening weekend. Initially, &quot;Reality Bites&quot; did not perform as well at the box office as the studio had hoped. In six weeks, it grossed $18.3 million, more than the film&#x27;s $11 million production budget. Bruce Feldman, Universal Pictures&#x27; Vice President of Marketing, said, &quot;The media labeled it as a Generation X picture, while we thought it was a comedy with broad appeal&quot;. The studio placed advertisements during programs chosen for their appeal to 12- to 34-year-olds, and in interviews Stiller was careful not to mention the phrase, &quot;Generation X&quot;. The film went on to be a moderate hit for Universal and make $20.9 million in the United States and Canada and $20 million internationally, for a worldwide total of $40.9 million.

===Critical reception===
The film received positive reviews. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 62% of 60 critics gave the film a positive review, with a rating average of 6.1/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;&quot;Reality Bites&quot; may be too slick to fulfill its promise as a profound statement on Generation X, but an appealing ensemble and romantic sizzle make for an entertaining dive into the ennui of youth.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a score of 67 out of 100 based on reviews from 26 critics. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B+ on scale of A to F.

Caryn James, in her review for &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Like the generation it presents so appealingly, it doesn&#x27;t see any point in getting all bent out of shape and overambitious. But it knows how to hang out and have a great time&quot;. In his review for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Desson Howe wrote, &quot;By aiming specifically—and accurately—at characters in their twenties, debuting screenwriter Helen Childress and first-time director Stiller achieve something even greater: they encapsulate an era&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s Richard Schickel wrote, &quot;the movie bobs along on this stream of funny offhandedness, never losing its balance. If it&#x27;s 10 o&#x27;clock, and you want to know where your supposedly grownup children are, this is a good place to look for them&quot;.

When asked in 2007 how well &quot;Reality Bites&quot; had aged, Janeane Garofalo replied, &quot;I think it means a lot more to people younger than me. I was not the target audience. I was 29 playing a 21-year-old, so I don&#x27;t think I understand why younger people like it.&quot;

In 2013, Stiller proposed a television series sequel.

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2002: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Passions – Nominated

=== Year-end lists ===
* 4th – Scott Schuldt, &quot;The Oklahoman&quot;
* Honorable mention – Michael MacCambridge, &quot;Austin American-Statesman&quot;
* Honorable mention – David Elliott, &quot;The San Diego Union-Tribune&quot;

==Lawsuit==
In 2005, the real Dyer (a film financier) sued writer Childress, producer DeVito, and director Stiller. Dyer claimed that screenwriter Childress stated on audio commentary tracks that she wrote the story based on her actual college friends and roommates, and that he was then forced to deal with past and potential clients&#x27; &quot;inquiries as to whether he was the fictional character&quot; as well as internet users attributing outlandish, caustic, unprofessional and immature quotations lifted from the film’s dialogue as being ideas and jargon of his own. The defendants attempted to seek shelter under California&#x27;s anti-SLAPP statutes, but in early 2007 the appeals court denied them SLAPP protection. The suit was quickly settled after Dyer received a written document from Childress stating he was not the person portrayed in the film.

==Television series==
In May 2022, it was reported that a television series adaptation of the film is in the works at Peacock with Childress, DeVito, Jenna Bans, Michael Shamberg, Stacey Sher and Casey Kyber serving as executive producers.

<text>Kaipara District is a territorial authority district in the Northland Region of New Zealand.

==History==
Kaipara District was formed through the 1989 New Zealand local government reforms and was constituted on 1 November 1989. It was made up of five former boroughs and counties: all of Hobson County, Dargaville Borough, Otamatea County, and parts of Rodney County and Whangarei County. In addition, it took over the functions of the Raupo Drainage Board, Kaiwaka Reserve Board, and the Pahi Reserve Boards.

==Geography==
Kaipara District is located in the rolling hills around the northern shores of the Kaipara Harbour, a large natural harbour open to the Tasman Sea. Kaipara District Council shares management of the harbour with various other organisations, most notably Northland Regional Council (in the north) and Auckland Council to the south.

The roughly triangular district stretches from a thinning of the Northland Peninsula south of Kaiwaka and Mangawhai in the southeast to the Waipoua Forest in the northwest. The district&#x27;s western boundary is defined by Ripirō Beach, which stretches down Northland&#x27;s west coast from Maunganui Bluff and the Waipoua Forest in the north, to Pouto at the entrance to Kaipara Harbour. The region is bisected by the northern Wairoa River and its tributaries, which flow into the northern end of Kaipara Harbour.

===Population centres===
The district has a population of most of whom live rurally, with the rest in small settlements scattered amongst the rolling hills or nestled on the shores of the harbour. Dargaville, located in the west, is the largest town, the primary service centre and seat of the district council, with residents. Other towns and villages include Ruawai, Matakohe, Paparoa, Maungaturoto, Kaiwaka, Mangawhai, Te Kōpuru, Kaihu and the harbour villages of Pahi, Tinopai and Whakapirau. The district has no major urban centre; the nearest one is the city of Whangārei, 45 kilometres northeast of Dargaville.

The area around Dargaville is noted for the high proportion of residents of Dalmatian descent and has an active Dalmatian Club. Community spirit is strong in the rural communities, as evidenced by the numerous local clubs, volunteer organisations and other initiatives. Dargaville has an annual Arts and Crafts Festival run by the local Rotary club and also features weekly Riverside Produce Markets on Thursday afternoons. Maungaturoto has a monthly market on a Friday from 4pm to 7pm at the Maungaturoto Hall and also has a volunteer group (Maungaturoto Residents Association) dedicated to beautifying the town. A similar volunteer group exists in Ruawai and Paparoa (Progressive Paparoa).

==Demographics==
Kaipara District covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.

Kaipara District had a population of 25,899 in the 2023 New Zealand census, an increase of 3,030 people (13.2%) since the 2018 census, and an increase of 6,936 people (36.6%) since the 2013 census. There were 12,960 males, 12,849 females and 84 people of other genders in 10,191 dwellings. 2.2% of people identified as LGBTIQ+. The median age was 46.8 years (compared with 38.1 years nationally). There were 4,734 people (18.3%) aged under 15 years, 3,480 (13.4%) aged 15 to 29, 11,376 (43.9%) aged 30 to 64, and 6,309 (24.4%) aged 65 or older.

People could identify as more than one ethnicity. The results were 83.7% European (Pākehā); 25.4% Māori; 4.8% Pasifika; 3.6% Asian; 0.5% Middle Eastern, Latin American and African New Zealanders (MELAA); and 3.0% other, which includes people giving their ethnicity as &quot;New Zealander&quot;. English was spoken by 97.7%, Māori language by 4.7%, Samoan by 0.3% and other languages by 6.3%. No language could be spoken by 1.7% (e.g. too young to talk). New Zealand Sign Language was known by 0.4%. The percentage of people born overseas was 15.7, compared with 28.8% nationally.

Religious affiliations were 30.5% Christian, 0.5% Hindu, 0.2% Islam, 2.3% Māori religious beliefs, 0.4% Buddhist, 0.6% New Age, 0.1% Jewish, and 1.1% other religions. People who answered that they had no religion were 56.0%, and 8.5% of people did not answer the census question.

Of those at least 15 years old, 2,391 (11.3%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, 12,051 (56.9%) had a post-high school certificate or diploma, and 6,009 (28.4%) people exclusively held high school qualifications. The median income was $31,600, compared with $41,500 nationally. 1,557 people (7.4%) earned over $100,000 compared to 12.1% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 8,946 (42.3%) people were employed full-time, 3,240 (15.3%) were part-time, and 546 (2.6%) were unemployed.

==Local government==
Prior to 2022, Kaipara District was divided into four wards:

* West Coast-Central
* Dargaville
* Otamatea
* Kaiwaka-Mangawhai

Since 2022, it is now reverted back into three wards (which is the last amount since the 2016 elections). This time both West Coast-Central and Dargaville Wards were merged to form into Wairoa Ward.

On 6 September 2012, commissioners were appointed by the Minister of Local Government to take over the governance of the Kaipara District Council. The appointment followed the completion of the work of the review team, which had been put in place by the Minister of Local Government in June 2012 to assess the financial management and governance challenges facing the council. The review team concluded that the challenges were beyond the ability of the mayor and councillors to manage. The elected council agreed and asked the Minister to appoint commissioners. The Kaipara District Council commissioners were John Robertson (chairman), Richard Booth, Colin Dale and Peter Winder.

In 2016, a new Kaipara District Council was elected, with Peter Winder guiding the council as Crown manager. In 2019, the council returned to full self-management.

<doc id="350850" wikidata="Q1071151" url="?curid=350850" title="Chevrolet Corvair">
<text>The Chevrolet Corvair is a rear-engined, air-cooled compact car manufactured and marketed by Chevrolet over two generations between 1960 and 1969. A response to the Volkswagen Beetle, it was offered in 4-door sedan, 2-door coupe, convertible, 4-door station wagon, passenger van, commercial van, and pickup truck body styles in its first generation (1960–1964), and as a 2-door coupe, convertible or 4-door hardtop in its second (1965–1969). Total production was approximately 1.8 million vehicles from 1960 until 1969.

The name &quot;Corvair&quot; was first applied in 1954 to a Corvette-based concept with a hardtop fastback-styled roof, part of the Motorama traveling exhibition. When applied to the production models, the &quot;air&quot; part referenced the engine&#x27;s cooling system.

A prominent aspect of the Corvair&#x27;s legacy derives from controversy surrounding its handling, articulated aggressively by Ralph Nader&#x27;s &quot;Unsafe at Any Speed&quot; and tempered by a 1972 Texas A&amp;M University safety commission report for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) which found that the 1960–1963 Corvair possessed no greater potential for loss of control in extreme situations than contemporary compacts.

To better counter popular inexpensive subcompact competitors, notably the Beetle and Japanese imports such as the Datsun 510, GM replaced the Corvair with the more conventional Chevrolet Vega in 1970. Today the Corvair has a devoted following among owners and collectors as average prices for Corvairs have steadily increased.

==History==

In 1952, Ed Cole was promoted to chief engineer of the Chevrolet Motor Division of General Motors. Four years later, in July 1956, he was named general manager of Chevrolet (GM&#x27;s largest automotive division) and became a GM vice president. At Chevrolet, Cole pushed for many of the major engineering and design advancements introduced in the Chevrolet car and truck lines between 1955 and 1962. He was completely involved in the development and production of the air-cooled rear-engine Corvair, a ground-breaking car in its day. As chief engineer, Cole was also heavily involved in the development of the Corvette sports car. He is also known as the &quot;father&quot; of the small-block Chevy V8, one of the most celebrated engines in American automotive history.

The first time Chevrolet manufactured an air-cooled engine was briefly in 1923 with the Chevrolet Series M Copper-Cooled, which due to engineering challenges, was deemed a failure.

By the late 1950s, the physical size of the entry-level models offered by the Big Three American domestic auto manufacturers (General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler) had grown considerably; effectively abandoning the market for the smaller vehicles that had been available in the past. A successful modern &quot;compact car&quot; market segment was established in the U.S. by the 1950 Nash Rambler. Growing sales of imports from Europe, such as Volkswagen, Renault, Fiat and others, showed that demand existed in the U.S. market for small cars, often as a second car or an alternative for budget-minded consumers. While the &quot;Big Three&quot; continued to introduce ever-larger cars during the 1950s, the new American Motors Corporation (AMC) focused its business strategy on smaller-sized and fuel-efficient automobiles, years before a real need for them existed. AMC, a far smaller company than the &quot;Big Three&quot;, positioned itself as an underdog; its compact Rambler models helped push AMC to third place in domestic automobile sales. American Motors also reincarnated its predecessor company&#x27;s smallest Nash model as the &quot;new&quot; 1958 Rambler American for a second model run, an almost unheard-of phenomenon in automobile history. In 1959, Studebaker followed AMC&#x27;s formula by restyling its mainstream economy-model sedan, calling it the Lark and billing it as a compact. The Lark success helped give Studebaker a respite for several years before the company ceased automobile production in 1966.

During 1959 and 1960, the Big Three automakers planned to introduce their own &quot;compact&quot; cars. Ford and Chrysler&#x27;s designs were scaled-down versions of the conventional American car, using industry default inline six-cylinder engines, and with bodies about 20% smaller than their standard cars.

An exception to this strategy was the Chevrolet Corvair. Chevrolet designed a car that deviated from traditional American norms of design, powered by an air-cooled, horizontally opposed six-cylinder engine with many major components in aluminum. The engine was mounted in the rear of the car, driving the rear wheels through a compact transaxle. The suspension was independent on all four wheels. Bodywork used monocoque rather than body-on-frame construction. The tires were a wider, low-profile design mounted on wider wheels. The clean, boxy styling was unconventional for Detroit, with no tail-fins or chrome grille (as the car had no radiator). Its engineering earned numerous patents, and it was highly praised and very warmly received upon its introduction and well thereafter.

While the Corvair was being developed, a Pontiac version, named Polaris, was proposed. A number of full-size mockups were built by the General Motors Styling Studios, but the project went no farther than styling markup before Pontiac division chief John Z. DeLorean turned it down, being suspicious of its air-cooled rear engine and drivetrain.

===Reception===
&quot;Time&quot; featured Ed Cole and the 1960 Corvair on its cover for the Corvair introduction in 1959, and &quot;Motor Trend&quot; named the Corvair as the 1960 &quot;Car of the Year&quot;.

Said &quot;Time&quot;: &quot;its fresh engineering is hailed as the forerunner of a new age of innovation in Detroit.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; reported in 1960: Chevrolet sold 26,000 Corvairs its first two days on the market, taking over 35% of Chevy&#x27;s two-day total of 75,000. Chevrolet had intended to sell one Corvair for every five Chevrolets. By March 1960, the Corvair comprised 13% of Chevrolet&#x27;s sales. Shortly after its introduction, the Corvair faced competition from the Ford Falcon and Mercury Comet and was plagued by problems,  although according to a 1960 &quot;Time&quot; report, &quot;many were the minor bugs that often afflict a completely new car.&quot; Problems included an engine cooling fan belt that tended to pop off its 2-axis pulleys (unless the fan ran constantly, the air-cooled engine would overheat and seize), carburetor icing and poor fuel mileage &quot;which sometimes runs well under 20 m.p.g.&quot; The 1960 model gasoline heater was cited as a problem, which itself could consume up to a quart of gas an hour – with Chevrolet engineers quickly modifying the Corvair&#x27;s carburetors to improve economy.

The 1960 Corvair and designers William L. &quot;Bill&quot; Mitchell and styling staff received an Industrial Designers Institute (IDI of NY) award.

==Generations==
===Overview===
The Corvair was sold in two generations, the first from 1960 to 1964, the second from 1965 to 1969. It sold more than 200,000 units in each of its first six model years, and 1,835,170 in all.

Chevrolet positioned the under $2,000 car as an economy compact, and highlighted its rear-engine design, which offered a low silhouette, flat passenger compartment floor, and spacious interior. There was excellent traction, no need for power-assisted steering or brakes, good ride quality, and balanced braking. The design also attracted customers of other makes, primarily imports. The Corvair stood out, being larger, more powerful, and offering more features than comparable imports, and engineering unique from other American offerings. It used GM&#x27;s Z-body, with design and engineering that advanced the rear-engine/rear-wheel-drive layout, which at the time had recently been popularized by the exploding success of the Volkswagen Beetle.

The Corvair&#x27;s engine was an overhead-valve aluminum, air-cooled flat-six, later enlarged, first to and then to . Power peaked with the 1965–66 turbocharged Corsa engine option. The first generation model&#x27;s swing axle rear suspension, which offered a comfortable ride. The design was replaced in 1965 model year with a fully independent trailing arm rear suspension similar to that of the Corvette Sting Ray.
===First generation (1960–1964)===
====1960====
The 1960 Corvair Body Styles 569 and 769 four-door sedans were conceived as economy cars offering few amenities to keep the price competitive, with the 500 Series selling for $2,038 ($ in dollars ). Powered by the Chevrolet Turbo-Air 6 engine with and mated to a three-speed manual or optional extra-cost two-speed Powerglide automatic transmission (RPO 360), the Corvair was designed to have comparable acceleration to the six-cylinder full-sized Chevrolet Biscayne. The Corvair&#x27;s unique design included the &quot;Quadri-Flex&quot; independent suspension and &quot;Unipack Power Team&quot; of engine, transmission, and rear axle combined into a single unit. Similar to designs of European cars such as Porsche, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, and others, &quot;Quadri-Flex&quot; used coil springs at all four wheels with independent rear suspension arms incorporated at the rear. Specially designed 6.5 by 13-inch four-ply tires mounted on 5.5 by 13 inch wheels were standard equipment. Available options included RPO 360, the Powerglide two-speed automatic transmission ($146), RPO 118, a gasoline heater ($74), RPO 119, an AM tube radio ($54), and by February 1960, the rear folding seat (formerly $32) was made standard. Chevrolet produced 47,683 of the 569 model and 139,208 769 model deluxe sedans in 1960.
In January 1960 two-door coupe models were introduced designated as the 527 and 727 body styles. Despite their late January introduction of the coupe, these cars sold well; about 14,628 base model 527 coupes, 36,562 model 727 deluxe coupes. Following the success of the upmarket &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Monza&quot; styling concept cars at the 1960 Chicago Auto Show, management approved the neatly appointed bucket-seat DeLuxe trim of the 900 series Monza as a two-door club coupe only. The new Monza began arriving at Chevrolet dealers in April 1960 with sales of 11,926 Monza club coupes, making the coupe one of the most popular Corvairs.

The success of the Monza model showed Chevrolet management that the compact Corvair was viewed as more of a specialty car than a competitor in the economy segment to the conventionally designed Ford Falcon or Chrysler&#x27;s Valiant. Chevrolet began a design program that resulted in the 1962 Chevy II, a conventional layout compact.

The option of a more powerful engine for the Corvair was introduced in February 1960. The RPO 649, marketed as &quot;Super Turbo Air&quot;, included a hotter camshaft, revised dual-spring cylinder heads, and a lower restriction 2-inch muffler to deliver at 4,800 rpm and of torque at 2,800 rpm. In its first year, it was available on any Corvair model with a manual transmission.

The advertised February introduction of a full synchromesh, four-speed transmission (RPO 651) was postponed until the 1961 model year. This was due to casting problems with the aluminum three-speed transmission case which resulted in technical service bulletins to dealers advising of the potential for differential failure due to external leaks at the front of the transmission&#x27;s counter gear shaft. The revision of the four-speed transmission designated for 1961 introduction incorporated a cast-iron case and a redesign of the differential pinion shaft to interface with a longer transmission output shaft and a concentric pilot for the revised transmission case. These are among many of the improvements undertaken by Chevrolet by the end of the 1960 model year.

The Corvair was &quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazine&#x27;s Car of the Year for 1960.

====1961====
In 1961, Chevrolet introduced the Monza upscale trim to the four-door sedans and the club coupe body styles. With its newly introduced four-speed floor-mounted transmission, DeLuxe vinyl bucket seats, and upscale trim, the Monza Club Coupe gained in sales, as nearly 110,000 were produced along with 33,745 Monza four-door sedans. The four-speed Monza caught the attention of the younger market and was sometimes referred to as &quot;the poor man&#x27;s Porsche&quot; in various car magazines. The Monza series contributed to about half of the Corvair sales in 1961.

A station wagon, marketed as the Lakewood, joined the lineup in 1961 with its engine located under the cargo floor and offering 68 ft³ (1.9 m³) of cargo room; 58 ft³ in the main passenger compartment, and another 10 ft³ in the front trunk. The Corvair engine received its first size increase to via a slight increase in bore size and was rated at . The base engine was still rated at when paired with the manual transmissions but this increased to when mated to the optional automatic transmission in Monza models. To increase luggage capacity in the front trunk, the spare tire was relocated to the engine compartment (in cars without air conditioning) and new &quot;direct air&quot; heater directed warmed air from the cylinders and heads to the passenger compartment. The gasoline heater remained available as an option through 1963. Factory air conditioning was offered as a mid-1961 option introduction. The condenser lay flat atop the horizontal engine fan. A large, green-painted reverse rotation version of the standard GM Frigidaire air-conditioning compressor was used, and an evaporator housing was added under the dash with integrated outlets surrounding the radio housing. Air conditioning was not available on wagons, Greenbrier/Corvair 95, or the turbocharged models introduced later, due to space constraints. Chevrolet also introduced the Corvair 95 line of light-duty trucks and vans, using the Corvair Powerpack with forward-control, or &quot;cab over&quot;, with the driver sitting over the front wheels, as in the Volkswagen Type 2.

The Greenbrier Sportswagon used the same body as the &quot;Corvan 95&quot; panel van with the side windows option, but was marketed as a station wagon and was available with trim and paint options similar to the passenger cars. The &quot;Corvan 95&quot; model was also built in pickup versions; the Loadside was a fairly typical pickup of the era, except for the rear engine, forward controls, and a pit in the middle of the bed. The more popular Rampside had a unique, large, fold-down ramp on the side of the bed for ease of loading wheeled items.
====1962====
In 1962, Chevrolet introduced the Corvairs with few changes at the beginning of the year. The bottom line 500 series station wagon was dropped and the 700 became the base station wagon. The &quot;Lakewood&quot; name was dropped. The ever-popular Monza line then took on a wagon model to round out the top of the line. In spring of 1962, Chevrolet committed itself to the sporty image they had created for the Corvair by introducing a convertible version, then offering a high-performance turbocharged &quot;Spyder&quot; option for Monza coupes and convertibles, making the Corvair the second production automobile supplied with a turbocharger as a factory option, with the Oldsmobile F-85 Turbo Jetfire having been released earlier in 1962. Corvair station wagons were discontinued at that point in favor the new Corvair Convertible and Chevy II (built at the same assembly plant). The slow-selling Loadside pickup was discontinued at the end of the model year. The rest of the Corvair 95 line of Forward Control vehicles continued. Optional equipment on all passenger cars (except wagons) included metallic brake linings and a heavy-duty suspension consisting of a front anti-roll bar, rear-axle limit straps, revised spring rates, and recalibrated shock absorbers. These provided a major handling improvement by reducing the potentially violent camber change of the rear wheels when making sharp turns at high speeds. The Turbocharged Spyder equipment group featured a multi-gauge instrument cluster which included a tachometer, cylinder head temperature, and intake manifold pressure gauges, Spyder fender script, and Turbo logo deck emblems, in addition to the high-performance engine.

The Monza Coupe was the most popular model with 151,738 produced out of 292,531 total Corvair passenger car production for 1962. John Fitch, chose the Corvair as the basis for &quot;Sprint&quot; models. These included various performance improvements along with appearance modifications. Individual components were available to customers and several Chevrolet dealers became authorized to install the &quot;Sprint&quot; conversions.

====1963====
The 1963 model year had the optional availability of a long 3.08 gear for improved fuel economy, but the Corvair otherwise remained largely carryover with minor trim and engineering changes. Self-adjusting brakes were new for 1963. Of all the Corvairs sold in 1963, fully 80% were Monzas. The convertible model accounted for over 20% of all the Monzas sold.

====1964====
Significant engineering changes were introduced for 1964, while the model lineup and styling remained relatively unchanged. The engine displacement was increased from by an increase in stroke. The base engine power increased from , and the high-performance engine increased from . The Spyder engine rating remained at despite the displacement increase of the engine. In 1964, an improvement in the car&#x27;s swing axle rear suspension occurred with the addition of a transverse leaf spring along with softer rear coil springs designed to diminish rear roll stiffness and foster more neutral handling. Spring rates could now be softer at both ends of the car compared to previous models. The heavy-duty suspension was no longer optional, although all models now had a front anti-roll bar as standard. Brakes were improved with finned rear drums. The remaining pickup, the Rampside, was discontinued at the end of the model year.

Despite a vastly improved 1964 model, Corvair sales declined by close to 73,000 units that year. This was attributed to a number of factors, including the basic styling being 5 years old, the lack of a pillarless hardtop (which virtually all competing compact models had), the lack of a V8 engine, and the introduction of the Ford Mustang on 17 April, which broke all records for sales of a new car (and cut into Corvair sales).
===Second generation (1965–1969)===
====1965====
The Corvair second generation arrived for model year 1965, noted for its lack of a &quot;B&quot; pillar and a new fully independent suspension replacing the original swing axle rear suspension. The Corvair used coil springs at each wheel.

&quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine&#x27;s David E. Davis Jr. showed enthusiasm for the 1965 Corvair in their October 1964 issue:

And it is here too, that we have to go on record and say that the Corvair is in our opinion—the most important new car of the entire crop of &#x27;65 models, and the most beautiful car to appear in this country since before World War II. ...When the pictures of the &#x27;65 Corvair arrived in our offices, the man who opened the envelope actually let out a great shout of delight and amazement on first seeing the car, and in thirty seconds the whole staff was charging around, each wanting to be the first to show somebody else, each wanting the vicarious kick of hearing that characteristic war-whoop from the first-time viewer. […] Our ardor had cooled a little by the time we got to drive the cars—then we went nuts all over again. The new rear suspension, the new softer spring rates in front, the bigger brakes, the addition of some more power, all these factors had us driving around like idiots—zooming around the handling loop dragging with each other, standing on the brakes—until we had to reluctantly turn the car over to some other impatient journalist. […] The &#x27;65 Corvair is an outstanding car. It doesn&#x27;t go fast enough, but we love it.

The standard and optional engines were carried forward from 1964. The previous Spyder engine was replaced by the normally aspirated for the new Corsa. The engine was unusual in offering four single-throat carburetors, to which were added larger valves and a dual exhaust system. A turbocharged engine was optional on the Corsa, which offered either standard three-speed or optional (US$92) four-speed manual transmissions. The engine was optional on 500 and Monza models with manual or Powerglide transmissions. All engines got some of the heavy-duty internal parts from the Turbocharged engine for better durability.

New refinements appeared on the 1965 redesign. The Corsa came standard with an instrument panel featuring a speedometer with resettable trip odometer, a 6,000 rpm tachometer, cylinder head temperature gauge, analog clock with a sweeping second hand, a manifold vacuum/pressure gauge, and fuel gauge; a much better heater system, larger brakes borrowed from the Chevelle, a stronger differential ring gear, an alternator (replacing the generator), and significant chassis refinements were made; a new fully articulated rear suspension virtually eliminated the danger of the previous generation&#x27;s swing axles and was based on the contemporary Corvette Sting Ray (Corvair used coil springs while the Sting Ray uses a transverse leaf). Additionally, an AM/FM stereo radio, in-dash All Weather Air Conditioning, telescopically adjustable steering column, and a Special Purpose Chassis Equipment (&quot;Z17&quot;) handling package, consisting of a special performance suspension and quick ratio steering box, were new options for 1965. The Monza and Corvair 500 Sport Sedans were the only compact cars ever available in the U.S. as pillarless four-door hardtops.

The station wagon, panel van, and pickup body styles had all been dropped and 1965 was the last year for the Greenbrier window van, which was retained mainly for fleet orders, with 1,528 being built. In all, 235,528 Corvairs were built in 1965, an increase of 30,000 units over 1964. Chevrolet replaced the Corvair-based vans with the Chevrolet Sportvan/GMC Handi-Van, which used a traditional front-engine/rear-drive axle borrowed from the Chevy II.

====1966====
The 1966 lineup remained essentially unchanged from 1965. One change of note was a new four-speed synchromesh transmission using the standard Saginaw gear set with 3.11:1 first gear ratio used by other GM 6-cylinder vehicles. The steering column was changed to a two-piece design with a universal joint, lessening the danger of intrusion during a front-end collision (actually a mid-1965 running change). A plastic air dam was installed below the front valence panel to conceal the front suspension and underbody, and lessen crosswind sensitivity. In front, The &quot;lock door&quot; emblem (covering the lockset for the trunk lock) was changed from red to blue and featured a shorter bar. At the rear, new larger taillight lenses were used featuring a thin chrome ring around the center of the light. Air conditioned cars received a new condenser that was mounted in front of the engine, eliminating the previous unit mounted atop the engine, requiring its removal for most engine service. The Corvair script nameplate was moved from atop the trunk lid to a position next to the driver&#x27;s side headlight bezel. Sales began a decline as a result of Ralph Nader&#x27;s book highlighting the Corvair&#x27;s deficiencies – and the new Mustang offering V8s up to compared to the Corvair&#x27;s top powertrain. Rumors of the upcoming &quot;Panther&quot; – the code name for the forthcoming Camaro, slated as a direct competitor for the Mustang – further undercut sales. A decision was made to discontinue further development of the Corvair. Production for the model year was down to 103,743.

====1967====

In 1967, the Corvair line was trimmed to the 500 and Monza Hardtop Coupes and Hardtop Sedans, and the Monza Convertible. This model year was the first with a collapsible steering column. A dual circuit master cylinder with warning light, nylon reinforced brake hoses, stronger steel (instead of aluminum) door hinges, &quot;mushroomed&quot; instrument panel knobs, and a vinyl-edged day/night mirror were all made standard equipment. Bucket seats in Monza models were now of the same &quot;Astro&quot; style as those on the new-for-1967 Camaro, featuring a new-thin-shell design. Chevrolet introduced a engine warranty on all Chevrolet models including the Corvair. Chevrolet was still actively marketing the Corvair in 1967, including color print ads and an &quot;I Love My Corvair&quot; bumper sticker campaign by dealers, but production and sales continued to fall off drastically. Only 27,253 copies were built. The chrome rings around the center of the taillights were made thicker.

====1968====
In 1968, the four-door hardtop was discontinued, leaving three models – the 500 and Monza Hardtop Coupes and the Monza Convertible. Air conditioning was dropped as an option, due to concerns about thermal loading added by the now-standard Air Injection Reactor (&quot;smog pump&quot;) which probably hurt sales as factory air became more popular generally in automobiles. The GM multiplex stereo system was also discontinued when new units changed wiring adapters; the Corvair&#x27;s 9-pin connector would no longer fit the new units. Additional safety features, including side marker lights, and shoulder belts for closed models, were fitted per the federal government&#x27;s requirements. The steering wheel for 500s was the same as the base Nova&#x27;s, while Monzas got the same wheel as the Camaro. An Impala-style &quot;Deluxe&quot; steering wheel was optional. All advertising was stopped and sales were down to 15,400.

====1969====
The final 1969 model-year Corvairs were assembled with the Nova in Willow Run, Michigan, the same facility Corvairs had been built from the beginning. A total of 6,000 Corvairs were produced of which only 521 were Monza Convertibles. The Corvair was the only GM car in 1969 that did not get a locking steering column. Demand for Novas was high and a decision was made in November 1968 to move Corvair assembly to a special off-line area in the plant, dubbed the &quot;Corvair Room&quot;, making Corvairs produced between that time and 14 May 1969 essentially hand-built by a dedicated Corvair team. Assembled bodies arrived from Fisher Body and awaited final assembly in the off-line area.

===End of production===
While the 1965 Corvair was received as a well-engineered high-performance driver&#x27;s car, that accomplishment was overshadowed by the phenomenal market success of the Ford Mustang. GM saw advantages to the route adopted by Ford with the Mustang, a four-seat semi-coupe body on a standard compact (Falcon) chassis with a small-block V8 motor and four-on-the-floor offered as power options. The Corvair was not cheap to produce; developing and marketing a Mustang-style model based on the Nova platform had cost advantages. Unlike the Corvair, a derivative model could evolve within GM&#x27;s standard lines of manufacturing technology. The 1965 publication of &quot;Unsafe at Any Speed&quot; sullied the reputation of the Corvair line, although the issues had nothing to do with the current model. Under competition from the Mustang and the publicity hit of &quot;Unsafe,&quot; Corvair sales plummeted by over half in 1966. GM saw the advantages of developing the Camaro, not the Corvair.

According to GM historian Dave Newell, Chevrolet had planned on ending Corvair production after the 1966 model year. Development and engineering changes were halted in 1966 on the year-old, redesigned second-generation cars with mainly federally mandated emissions and safety changes made thereafter. An increasing lack of interest from the company, especially from Chevrolet&#x27;s general manager John DeLorean, and a complete absence of Corvair advertising after 1967 reflected the company&#x27;s priorities, including promotion of three redesigned models for 1968 – the Corvette, Chevelle, and Chevy II Nova. The Corvair was referred to as &quot;the phantom&quot; by &quot;Car Life&quot; magazine in their 1968 Monza road test, and by 1969 Chevrolet&#x27;s Corvair four-page brochure was &quot;by request only&quot;. During its final year of production, 6,000 cars were produced.

Chevrolet had proposed a third generation (1970 onward) Corvair, essentially a re-skin of the 1965–69 model resembling the 1973 GM A Body intermediates, particularly the 1973 Pontiac Grand Am, retaining Corvair proportions. Having passed the point of full-scale clay models, Chevrolet stopped developing the model in early 1968. Unlike the Turbo Hydramatic 400, the Turbo Hydramatic 350 transmission, introduced in the 1968 Camaro and later adopted by most Chevrolet models had been configured for use in the third generation Corvair.

====Model designations====

500 – base model Corvair with lowest trim level. Always came with rubber mats, bench seats, and very little trim.

700 – next trim level up from the 500 model. These models also came with rubber mats and bench seats, but had more extensive exterior trim and additional features as standard. (this model was discontinued after 1964).

Lakewood – Corvair station wagon (1961–62) available as a 500 or 700. The Monza wagon was available in 1962 and is not really a Lakewood. All window glass was specific to this model due to its taller roofline.

Monza (900) – the top of the trim line for 1960–1963 only. In 1964, it was below the Monza Spyder, which was now its own model. For the 1965–66 model year, the Monza ranked below the Corsa in trim level. After the Corsa model was dropped, the Monza was once again at the top of the Corvair line for 1967 through 1969. Monzas usually came with bucket seats (although special bench seats were available in some years). Monzas had carpeting and special trim packages.

Spyder – the Monza Spyder was an option package during the 1962 and 1963 model years, and for 1964 became a full-fledged model. It was equipped with a turbocharged engine, &quot;full instrumentation&quot;, special emblems, and all the &quot;Monza&quot; trim items.

Corsa – top of the line sport model for 1965–66. It was the only model available with the optional turbocharged flat-six. The base engine was the new four-carburetor &quot;big valve&quot; engine. Corsas had &quot;full instrumentation&quot;, special emblems, and trim with a special &quot;argent&quot; silver painted rear cove area and pinstriping on the 1965 models. The optional 180 hp engine delivered an increase in power over the 1964 150 hp engine of the same displacement by slightly enlarging the carburetor, and increasing the size of the internal impeller and turbine blades.

Corvan (95) – Corvair panel van that was available 1961–1964

Rampside – Corvair pickup with a ramp on one side that was available 1961–1964

Greenbrier – a windowed van that was available 1961–1965

Loadside – Corvair pickup without the ramp which was available 1961 and 1962

Deluxe – option package of upgraded interior and trim available on some of the &quot;van&quot; models

F.C. (forward control) – a Chevy term that applied to all Corvair 95 van models indicating that the driver and controls were forward of the front wheels

==Handling issues==
The first-generation Corvair featured a &quot;rear engine + swing axle design&quot; similar to that of the Renault Dauphine and Volkswagen Beetle – a design which eliminates universal joints at the wheels and keeps the rear wheels perpendicular to the half-shafts, rather than the road surface. The design can allow rear tires to undergo large camber angle changes during fast cornering due to side g-forces causing &quot;rebound&quot; camber and decreasing the tread contact with the road surface, leading to a loss of rear wheel grip and oversteer – a dynamically unstable condition where a driver can lose control and spin. The problem is most severe in combinations having the engine and swing axle at the same end of the car: in most cases this is at the rear, and the Corvair is no exception. The rebound camber is worse because of the greater inertial mass over the rear wheels with this combination; the higher center of gravity during rebound causes additional problems. A station wagon body also exacerbates the tendency because it increases the weight at the rear (and raises the center of gravity). Oversteer is exacerbated by deceleration during cornering due to increased side g-force and lightened load on rear tires (lift-off oversteer). Understeer is common in front-engine cars due to more weight, and inertia, on the front tires. Both conditions are dangerous when a car is driven at its cornering limits. Design options to ameliorate swing axle handling:
* Anti-roll bar: As a production option, engineers had advocated but management rejected the inclusion of a front anti-roll bar on the original 1960 Corvair, which would have ameliorated the car&#x27;s handling – shifting weight transfer to the front outboard tire, considerably reducing rear slip angles – thereby avoiding potential oversteer.
* Tire pressure differential: As with the Renault Dauphine and pre-1968 Volkswagen Beetle, Corvair engineers relied on a cost-free &quot;tire pressure differential&quot; to eliminate oversteer characteristics – low front and high rear tire pressure –a strategy which induced understeer (increasing front slip angles faster than the rear). Nonetheless, the strategy offered a significant disadvantage: owners and mechanics could inadvertently but easily re-introduce oversteer characteristics by over-inflating the front tires (i.e., to typical pressures for other cars with other, more prevalent suspension systems). The recommended low front tire pressure also compromised the tire load capacity.

While the Corvair &quot;sedan&quot; offered competent handling, &quot;the average buyer more accustomed to front-engined cars, did not take [into] account the car&#x27;s different handling characteristics.&quot; Chevrolet made a succession of improvements to the first-generation Corvair suspension. For the 1962 model year, the front anti-roll bar became available as an option. For the 1964 model year, the front anti-roll bar became standard equipment and the rear suspension was modified to include a camber compensating, transverse-mounted leaf spring extending between the rear wheels to limit rear wheel camber change, and carrying much of the rear weight combined with softer coil springs. Also in 1962, two Corvairs were tested around Riverside for 24 hours: one managed to survive the test, despite crossing the finish line with no fuel, at an average speed of , and burned a quart of oil, while the other one crashed around the esses.

For the 1965 model year, the Corvair received a fully independent rear suspension closely resembling that of the contemporary Corvette. The redesigned suspension reduced the rear roll center to half its previous height, using fully articulated half-axles that offered constant camber on the rear tires in all driving situations. This eliminated the handling problems of the first-generation models.

===Legal fallout===
Consumer protection activist Ralph Nader addressed the handling issues of the first-generation (1960–1963) Corvair in his 1965 book, &quot;Unsafe at Any Speed&quot;. GM had over 100 lawsuits pending in connection with crashes involving the Corvair, which subsequently became the initial material for Nader&#x27;s investigations. The book highlighted crashes related to the Corvair&#x27;s suspension and identified the Chevrolet suspension engineer who had fought management&#x27;s decision to omit – for cost reasons – the front anti-roll bar installed on later models. Nader said during subsequent Congressional hearings, the Corvair is &quot;the leading candidate for the un-safest-car title&quot;. Subsequently, Corvair sales fell from 220,000 in 1965 to 109,880 in 1966. By 1968, production fell to 14,800. Public response to the book played a role in the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act in 1966.

A 1972 safety commission report conducted by Texas A&amp;M University concluded that the 1960–1963 Corvair possessed no greater potential for loss of control than its contemporary competitors in extreme situations. The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) issued a press release in 1972 describing the findings of NHTSA testing from the previous year. NHTSA had conducted a series of comparative tests in 1971 studying the handling of the 1963 Corvair and four contemporary cars – a Ford Falcon, Plymouth Valiant, Volkswagen Beetle, and Renault Dauphine – along with a second-generation Corvair (with its completely redesigned, independent rear suspension). The 143-page report reviewed NHTSA&#x27;s extreme-condition handling tests, national crash-involvement data for the cars in the test as well as General Motors&#x27; internal documentation regarding the Corvair&#x27;s handling. NHTSA went on to contract an independent advisory panel of engineers to review the tests. This review panel concluded that &quot;the 1960–63 Corvair compares favorably with contemporary vehicles used in the tests [...] the handling and stability performance of the 1960–63 Corvair does not result in an abnormal potential for loss of control or rollover, and it is at least as good as the performance of some contemporary vehicles both foreign and domestic.&quot; Former GM executive and automotive engineer John DeLorean asserted in his book &quot;On a Clear Day You Can See General Motors&quot; that Nader&#x27;s criticisms were valid.

Journalist David E. Davis, in a 2009 article in &quot;Automobile Magazine&quot;, noted that despite Nader&#x27;s claim that swing-axle rear suspension was dangerous, Porsche, Mercedes-Benz, Tatra, and Volkswagen all used similar swing-axle concepts during that era. (The handling of other rear-engine swing-axle cars, particularly the Volkswagen Type I and II, has been criticized as well.) Some contend that Nader&#x27;s lack of an automotive engineering degree or a driver&#x27;s license at the time he wrote &quot;Unsafe at Any Speed&quot; disqualifies him as a critic of automotive safety. In response to Nader&#x27;s book, &quot;Mechanix Illustrated&quot; reviewer Tom McCahill tried to get a 1963 Corvair to flip, at one point sliding sideways into a street curb, but could not turn over the vehicle.

===Vindication===
The Corvair&#x27;s reputation and legacy, as well as those of General Motors, were tarnished by accusations about its handling ability; the car was scrutinized in Ralph Nader&#x27;s 1965 book &quot;Unsafe at Any Speed&quot;. Ralph Nader&#x27;s accusations were proven false by the 1972 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration safety commission report. Support for the tests, conducted at College Station, Texas, was provided by the Texas Transportation Institute (TTl) Texas A&amp;M University Research Foundation. The investigation concluded:

==Legacy==
===Design influence===
The first-generation Corvair (1960–1964) has been credited with influencing car design worldwide. Styled in GM&#x27;s advanced styling studio in 1957, under the leadership of then director Ned Nickels, the compact design was made using cues from earlier Oldsmobile and Chevrolet models. The most notable design feature, its high, wrap-around beltline, was &quot;borrowed&quot; by other carmakers not long after the Corvair&#x27;s release. These cars included the BMW 1602/2002, NSU Prinz, Hillman Imp, Fiat 1300/1500, Volkswagen Type 34 Karmann Ghia and the Mazda 800.

The Corvair&#x27;s combination of power and light weight introduced European manufacturers to an American market niche for small popular-priced sedans with more power and driveability than the contemporary European economy sedans and a more versatile and practical design than European sports cars. That overall concept was exemplified by Volkswagen&#x27;s Type 34 Karmann Ghia and Type 3 &quot;notchback&quot; in 1961 and BMW&#x27;s &quot;New Class&quot; sedans in 1962. BMW developed the concept further by mass-marketing higher performance high-quality sedans, setting the trend of the &quot;sport sedan&quot; category that would soon include offerings from a variety of European, and eventually Japanese, manufacturers.

==Concept cars==
The Corvair spawned a number of innovative concept vehicles including the Corvair SS, Monza GT, Monza SS, and Astro I. In Europe, Italian coachbuilder Bertone designed a very advanced one-off prototype for the 1963 Geneva Motor Show; the &quot;Chevrolet Testudo&quot;. This was among the first designs of Giorgetto Giugiaro, the chief designer at Bertone at the time. The Testudo later suffered a collision with another Bertone concept car, the Alfa Romeo Canguro, while on track at the Monza circuit. There was also a Pininfarina built concept called the &quot;Corvair Speciale&quot;, and two other Pininfarina concepts known as &quot;Coupe I&quot; and &quot;Coupe II&quot;.

The Chevrolet Corvair Monza GT coupe toured together with the Monza SS (Spyder) in early 1963, making a public appearance at the New York International Auto Show. Although both cars were based on the Corvair drivetrain, each represented a futuristic development of the Corvair design. In the SS convertible, the engine (with a four-carburetor setup) was left in its stock location behind the transaxle, allowing for a shorter () wheelbase. The Monza GT is housed at the GM&#x27;s Heritage Center in Detroit.

A 1966 concept vehicle, the Electrovair II was a 1966 Monza 4-door hardtop modified with a 532 volt, electric motor replacing the gasoline engine – following a 1964 version known as Electrovair I. With the 1966 model, silver-zinc batteries were used and placed in the trunk and engine compartment, and the body was slightly modified to accept the conversion. The car was handicapped by the high cost of the batteries ($160,000), a limited driving range (), and short battery life.
==Racing and modified Corvairs==
===Yenko Stinger===

Don Yenko, who had been racing Corvettes, could not compete successfully against the Carroll Shelby Mustangs after they arrived on the scene. Yenko decided to race modified Corvairs, beginning with the 1966 model. As the stock Corvair did not fit into any of the SCCA categories, Yenko modified four-carburetor Corsas into &quot;sports cars&quot; by removing the back seat and introducing various performance improvements. As the SCCA required 100 cars to be manufactured to homologate the model for production racing, Yenko completed 100 Stingers in one month in 1965. Although all were white, as the SCCA required for American cars at the time, [the normal competition trim for U.S.-built cars was white with 2 blue stripes] there was a great deal of variety between individual cars; some had exterior modifications including fiberglass engine covers with spoilers, some did not; some received engine upgrades developing 160, 190, 220, or 240 hp (119, 142, 164, or 179 kW). All were equipped by the Chevrolet factory with heavy-duty suspension, four-speed transmission, quicker steering ratio, &quot;positraction&quot; limited-slip differentials (50 with 3.89 gears, and 50 with 3.55 after Chevrolet discontinued the 3.89) and dual brake master cylinders (the first application of this by Chevrolet, to become standard equipment the next year). Because most of the engine cooling in air-cooled engines is done by circulating oil, an oil cooler was necessary for competition use, this was mounted externally on the rear body section above the left wheel.

The Stingers competed in Class D production dominated by the Triumph TR4. In its first race in January 1966, the Stinger finished in second by only one second. By the end of the 1966 season, Jerry Thompson had won the Central Division Championship and placed fifth in the 1966 Nationals, Dick Thompson, a successful Corvette race driver, had won the Northeast Division Championship, and Jim Spencer had won the Central Division Championship, with Dino Milani taking second place. The next year, Chevrolet dropped the Corsa line. The Monza line was initially not available with the 4-carburetor engine. These were eventually offered as a special performance option, along with the 3.89 differential. The Monza instrumentation did not have a tachometer or head temperature gauges, which had to be separately installed. The SCCA, on the other hand, had relaxed its ruling regarding color, and the cars were available in red or blue. It is believed that only fourteen 1967 Stingers were built. Dana Chevrolet distributed Stingers on the U.S. West coast and ordered an additional three similar cars to be built to Stinger specifications, but with the AIR injection system to meet California emissions laws, with Yenko&#x27;s permission. A total of 185 Stingers are believed to have been built, the last being YS-9700 built for Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company as a tire test vehicle in 1969–1970.

===Fitch Sprint===
Longtime roadracer John Fitch was particularly interested in the Corvair as the basis for a spirited road and track-oriented car, due to its handling. The basic Sprint received only minor modifications to the engine, bringing it to , but upgrades to the shock absorbers and springs, adjustments to the wheel alignment, quicker steering ratio, alloy wheels, metallic brake linings, the obligatory wood-rimmed steering wheel (leather available for an additional $9.95), short-throw shifter and other such minor alterations made it extremely competitive with European sports cars costing much more. Racing stripes and front mesh gravel screen were available. Body options for the 1965-1969 cars such as spoilers were also available, but the most visually remarkable option was the &quot;Ventop&quot;, a fiberglass overlay for the C-pillars and rear of the roof that gave the car a &quot;flying buttress&quot; profile.

Fitch went on to design and build a prototype of the Fitch Phoenix, a Corvair-based two-seat sports car, superficially resembling a smaller version of the Corvette based Mako Shark. With a total weight of , even with a steel body, and with the Corvair engine modified with Weber carburetors to deliver , the car delivered spirited performance for $8,760. The ability to produce automobiles on a small scale, along with Chevrolet&#x27;s decision to terminate production of the Corvair, meant the end of Fitch&#x27;s plan. He still retained the prototype, and occasionally exhibited it at car shows until his death. On 1 June 2014, the Fitch Phoenix went to auction at Bonhams in the Greenwich Concours and sold for 230,000 US dollars. The car is still in Connecticut with the new owner.

In the early 1970s, Fitch sold his inventory to Art Hershberger of Princeton, Wisconsin. Hershberger made minor styling modifications to several Corvairs and sold them as Solar Sprints and Solar Cavaliers. The main distinguishing feature of the Solar was its Camaro taillights.

===Winfield Reactor and Piranha===
Automotive customizer Gene Winfield built two models in the mid 1960s that used the unique qualities of the lightweight and low Corvair engine.
The Reactor came when Winfield was tasked with showing the benefits of an aluminum bodied car. What he developed was an extremely low slung two seat front-mid-engine, front-wheel-drive car. He used the 180 hp turbocharged engine from the Corvair Corsa. Other drivetrain components came from the Citroën DS, including the front wheel drive transaxle and height adjustable suspension. Winfield was able to place this vehicle in the 1960s television programs Star Trek, Batman, and Bewitched.

A sports racing car – the Piranha – was developed around the same time, to demonstrate the use of a new plastic for the structural parts of the automobile – Cyclic ABS. This lightweight (1,400 lb) vehicle was developed in several generations, using a rear-mounted Corvair engine. Model car company Aluminum Model Toys began small scale production of actual cars through their division run by Gene Winfield. Winfield was able to obtain feature placement of this car on television as The U.N.C.L.E. Car in &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;

===Custom, dune buggies and aircraft===
Corvair flat-six engines were a popular alternative to Volkswagen engines in dune buggy applications and off-road racing. Corvair engines have been used to power light and experimental aircraft designs by Pietenpol, Zenith, and Sonex. Much development work on the conversion of Corvair engines into flight-worthy powerplants has been carried out by William Wynne, who among others has been refining the process since the 1980s.

===Trans Am===
A Corvair was driven by Spurgeon May and Donna Mae Mims in the Trans Am Series in 1966.

=== The Morrvair ===
Matthew Wetzel, owner of the &quot;Matt&#x27;s Off Road Recovery&quot; YouTube channel, uses a highly modified Corvair Station Wagon nicknamed &quot;The Morrvair&quot; to recover stuck and disabled vehicles from the deserts of Southern Utah. The Morrvair has been modified to be a front engine vehicle, and features an LS engine, Dana 60 and Dana 70 Axles, a custom built lift kit, and many other modifications typical of an off road vehicle.

<doc id="350853" wikidata="Q1014616" url="?curid=350853" title="Papakura District">
<text>Papakura District was a local council territory in New Zealand&#x27;s Auckland Region that was governed by the Papakura District Council from 1989 until 2010. The area makes up the southernmost part of the Auckland metropolitan area.

The area was originally a small independent city, until it became &quot;Papakura District&quot; in the 1989 reorganisation of New Zealand&#x27;s local governments, and has now been overtaken by Auckland&#x27;s urban sprawl. The district is flanked by beaches on the Manukau Harbour to the west, Manukau City to the north and east, and had Franklin District to the south.

==Geography==
In 2010, Papakura District boundaries covered 123 square kilometres and the centre of the district was located 32 km from downtown Auckland.

The geography of the district encompasses fertile plains, the inlets and foreshores of the Manukau Harbour, and the rolling foothills of the Hunua Range; a relatively narrow but strategically well positioned narrow span of land between the Hauraki Gulf and the Manukau Harbour. Much of the district – particularly in the west – is flat to rolling land. There is extensive peat soil in the Takanini area, which was once a vast wetland and peat bog. In the east, low-to-medium-sized foothills lead out into the Hunua range.

Keri Hill has pastoral lifestyle blocks overlooking Ardmore; Pukekiwiriki offered a strategic vantage point for the indigenous Maori people, but is now a popular suburb; Pahurehure has a harbourside setting on the eastern reaches of Manukau Harbour. Drury is the first genuine country town south of Auckland, and Takanini is Papakura&#x27;s main industrial zone.

===Suburbs===
The district was arranged into four wards during the existence of the Papakura District Council, now the entire area makes up a Papakura Local Board in the new Auckland Council territory.
==History==
In the major reformation of local government in 1989, Papakura became a district. Prior to that time, a smaller area was known as Papakura City, which was a small city of New Zealand, but the new area included parts of the surrounding rural countryside that had previously been part of Manukau City. After the major change Papakura City became Papakura District, part of the Auckland Region. The whole district counted as part of the Auckland urban area for statistical purposes, forming part of its southern boundary.

On 1 November 2010, the Papakura District Council was merged into the new Auckland Council. All council facilities and services were handed over to the new council.

==People==
Papakura District&#x27;s population is estimated to be growing at three times the rate of New Zealand as a whole and is predominantly European.
Over 60% residents living in Papakura District belong to the European ethnic group and 36% belong to Maori and Pacific Islander group. The city council is planning for Papakura&#x27;s population to more than double by 2050.

==Local facilities==
===Government===
In addition to the local council chambers, Papakura is served by a large Police Department; one of Auckland&#x27;s busiest stations, a District Courthouse, and a WINZ office. In 2004, the Papakura Courthouse acted as the Supreme Court for Pitcairn Island.

==== Papakura District Court ====
The Papakura District Court was opened by the Hon. Geoffrey Palmer, then Minister of Justice, on 19 May 1986. At present, it is home to two Resident District Court Judges. It has 2 main court rooms used primarily for criminal hearings, a smaller court room used for Family Court hearings, a disputes hearing room and Registrar&#x27;s hearing room for all criminal first appearances. One of the criminal court rooms is fitted out to hold jury trials, but is no longer used for that purpose, with all trials arising out of local incidents being held at the much larger Manukau District Court.

===Armed Forces===
Papakura once served a significant military population, but now only the SAS special forces are based at Papakura. Nearby houses were originally Army Homes, but are now privately owned homes.

A significant war memorial is located on the corner of Great South Road and Opaheke Road, where Anzac Day commemorations and other commemorative occasions take place, such as the Armistice Day Centenary on Sunday 11 November 2018.

===Transport===

Auckland&#x27;s southern motorway and the North Island Main Trunk railway run through the Papakura District and a large airfield is located nearby at Ardmore. Train and bus services provide the bulk of public transport, with frequent trains on the Southern Line between Papakura and the CBD (Britomart). Recent investment has focused on upgrading and refurbishing the region&#x27;s trains and suburban railway stations, most recently with the opening of a modern station facility at the town centre. Papakura is the final stop for most southbound public transport in Auckland, and Papakura is the third busiest station on the rail network. Drawn by frequent services into and out of the city, rail commuters come from Papakura itself, Franklin County and the northern Waikato. Though the motorway and Great South Road flow relatively freely at peak times, road commuters are affected by the acute traffic congestion as they get closer to metropolitan Auckland.

===Ardmore Airport===
Ardmore Airport serves recreational aviators, private and commercial flights. It is the busiest airport in New Zealand based on aircraft movements, and is home to a wide range of innovative small to medium-sized aerospace businesses and popular among the non-commercial aviation sector.
===Recreation===
Some notable sports facilities include an indoor-outdoor swimming pool, an international-quality athletics track, a sports stadium, and venues for rugby, netball, golf, tennis, badminton, soccer, and many other sports. The council also operates a library and a theatre. Papakura also has a number of skate parks, a skate bowl and an extensive BMX track that regularly hosts major cycling events.

<text>Temminck&#x27;s stint (Calidris temminckii) is a small wader. This bird&#x27;s common name and Latin binomial commemorate the Dutch naturalist Coenraad Jacob Temminck. The genus name is from Ancient Greek &quot;kalidris&quot; or &quot;skalidris&quot;, a term used by Aristotle for some grey-coloured waterside birds.

Temminck&#x27;s stint is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

==Description==
These birds are very small waders, at length. They are similar in size to the little stint (&quot;Calidris minuta&quot;) but shorter legged and longer winged. The legs are yellow and the outer tail feathers white, in contrast to little stint&#x27;s dark legs and grey outer tail feathers.

This is a rather drab wader, with mainly plain brown upperparts and head, and underparts white apart from a darker breast. The breeding adult has some brighter rufous mantle feathers to relieve the generally undistinguished appearance. In winter plumage, the general appearance recalls a tiny version of common sandpiper.

The call is a loud trill.

==Breeding==
This stint&#x27;s breeding habitat is bogs and marshes in the taiga of Arctic northern Europe and Asia. It will breed in southern Scandinavia and occasionally Scotland. It has a distinctive hovering display flight. It nests in a scrape on the ground, laying 3–4 eggs. Temminck&#x27;s stint is strongly migratory, wintering at freshwater sites in tropical Africa, the Indian Subcontinent and parts of Southeast Asia.

Temminck&#x27;s stints have an intriguing breeding and parental care system in which males and female parents incubate separate clutches, typically in different locations. Males establish small territories and mate with a female who lays a first clutch of eggs. She then moves to a second territory and mate, and lays a second clutch that she incubates herself. Concurrently, her first male may mate with an incoming second female, who lays her second clutch on his territory. The male thereafter incubates his first mate&#x27;s first clutch alone.

An apparent hybrid between this species and the little stint has been reported from the Netherlands.

==Feeding==
These birds forage in soft mud with some vegetation, mainly picking up food by sight. They have a distinctive mouse-like feeding behaviour, creeping steadily along the edges of pools. They mostly eat insects and other small invertebrates. They are not as gregarious as other &quot;Calidris&quot; waders, and rarely form large flocks.
