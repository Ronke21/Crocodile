<text>A suit, also called a lounge suit, business suit, dress suit, or formal suit is a set of clothes comprising a suit jacket and trousers of identical textiles generally worn with a collared dress shirt, necktie, and dress shoes. A skirt suit is similar, but with a matching skirt instead of trousers. It is currently considered semi-formal wear or business wear in contemporary Western dress codes, however when the suit was originally developed it was considered an informal or more casual option compared to the prevailing clothing standards of aristocrats and businessmen. The lounge suit originated in 19th-century Britain as sportswear and British country clothing, which is why it was seen as more casual than at that time, with the roots of the suit coming from early modern Western Europe formal court or military clothes. After replacing the black frock coat in the early 20th century as regular daywear, a sober one-coloured suit became known as a lounge suit.

Suits are offered in different designs and constructions. Cut and cloth, whether two- or three-piece, single- or double-breasted, vary, in addition to various accessories. A two-piece suit has a jacket and trousers; a three-piece suit adds a waistcoat. Hats were almost always worn outdoors (and sometimes indoors) with all men&#x27;s clothes until the counterculture of the 1960s in Western culture. Informal suits have been traditionally worn with a fedora, a trilby, or a flat cap. Other accessories include handkerchief, suspenders or belt, watch, and jewelry.

Other notable types of suits are for what would now be considered formal occasions—the tuxedo or dinner suit (black tie) and the black lounge suit (stroller)—both which originally arose as less formal alternatives for the prior formal wear standards known as white tie, which incorporated items such as the dress coat, and of morning dress, which incorporated items such as the morning coat with formal trousers.

Originally, suits were always tailor-made from the client&#x27;s selected cloth. These are now known as &quot;bespoke&quot; suits, custom-made to measurements, taste, and style preferences. Since the 1960s, most suits have been mass-produced ready-to-wear garments. Currently, suits are offered in roughly four ways:
*&quot;bespoke&quot;, in which the garment is custom-made by a tailor from a pattern created entirely from the customer&#x27;s measurements, giving the best fit and free choice of fabric;
*&quot;made to measure&quot;, in which a pre-made pattern is modified to fit the customer, and a limited selection of options and fabrics is available;
*&quot;ready-to-wear&quot;, &quot;off-the-peg&quot; (Commonwealth English), or &quot;off-the-rack&quot; (American English), sold ready-made, although minor tailor alterations are possible;
*&quot;suit separates&quot;, where lounge jacket and trousers are sold separately in order to minimize alterations needed, including also odd-colored blazers or sports coats as smart casual options

==Terminology==
The word &quot;suit&quot; derives from the French &quot;suite&quot;, meaning &quot;following,&quot; from some Late Latin derivative form of the Latin verb &quot;sequor&quot; = &quot;I follow,&quot; because the component garments (jacket and trousers and waistcoat) follow each other and have the same cloth and colour and are worn together.

As a suit (in this sense) covers all or most of the wearer&#x27;s body, the term &quot;suit&quot; was extended to a single garment that covers all or most of the body, such as boilersuits, diving suits, and spacesuits.

==History==
The suit&#x27;s origins trace the simplified, sartorial standard established by the English king Charles II in the 17th century, following the example of his one-time host King Louis XIV&#x27;s court at Versailles, who decreed that in the English Court men would wear a long coat, a waistcoat (then called a &quot;petticoat&quot;), a cravat (a precursor of the necktie), a wig, knee breeches (trousers), and a hat. The paintings of Jan Steen, Pieter Bruegel the Elder, and other painters of the Dutch Golden Era reveal that such an arrangement was already used in Holland, if not Western Europe as a whole.

The current styles, founded in the Great Male Renunciation of the late 18th century, sharply changed the elaborately embroidered and jewelled formal clothing into the simpler clothing of the British Regency period, which gradually evolved to the stark formality of the Victorian era. In the late 19th century, it was in the search for more comfort that the loosening of rules gave rise to the modern lounge suit.

Brooks Brothers is generally credited with first offering the &quot;ready-to-wear&quot; suit, a suit that was sold already manufactured and sized, ready to be tailored, while Haggar Clothing first introduced the concept of suit separates in the U.S., which are widely found in the marketplace today.

==Elements==
There are many possible variations in the choice of the style, the garments, and the details of a suit.

===Cut===

The silhouette of a suit is its outline. Tailored balance created from a canvas fitting allows a balanced silhouette so a jacket need not be buttoned and a garment is not too tight or too loose. A proper garment is shaped from the neck to the chest and shoulders to drape without wrinkles from tension. Shape is the essential part of tailoring that often takes hand work from the start. The two main cuts are &quot;double-breasted&quot; suits, a conservative design with two columns of buttons, spanned by a large overlap of the left and right sides; and &quot;single-breasted&quot; suits, in which the sides meet in the centre of the torso with a single column of buttons, overlapping only enough for one, two or three buttons to close, with by convention the jacket front cut so that the lowest button is not designed to close.

Good tailoring anywhere in the world is characterised by strongly tapered sides and minimal shoulder, whereas rack suits are often padded to reduce labour . More casual suits are characterised by less construction and tailoring, much like the sack suit, a loose American style.

There are three ways to buy suits:
# Ready-made and altered &quot;sizes&quot; or precut patterns, a convenience that often is expressed over time with wrinkles from poor shaping, leading to distortion;
# The made-to-measure suit, in which a pre-existing pattern is altered to reflect the individual&#x27;s preference or nuances of physique to achieve things like the style, lengths, shoulder slope and point-to-point and trouser fitting;
# The custom, bespoke, or tailoring-designed suit, which has at least one basted fitting in which a half-made coat (usually just scraps of cloth basted together) is worn by the client in order to let the tailor readjust the pattern several times before finishing the garment. This process can take the tailor easily 80 hours.

The acid test of authentic tailoring standards is the wrinkle that comes from poor tailoring. Rumples can be pressed out. For interim fittings, &quot;Rock Of Eye&quot; (which means trained freehand based on an experienced artistic eye to match the item to the wearer, trusting the eye over unyielding scripted approach), drawing and cutting inaccuracies are overcome by the fitting.

===Fabric===
Suits are made in a variety of fabrics, but most commonly from wool, silk or cotton. The two main yarns produce worsteds (where the fibres are combed before spinning to produce a smooth, hard wearing cloth) and woollens (where they are not combed, thus remaining comparatively fluffy in texture). These can be woven in a number of ways, producing flannel, tweed, gabardine, and fresco among others. These fabrics all have different weights and feels, and some fabrics have an S (or Super S) number describing the fineness of the fibres measured by average fibre diameter, e.g., Super 120; the finer the fabric, the more delicate and thus less likely to be long-wearing it will be. Although wool has traditionally been associated with warm, bulky clothing meant for warding off cold weather, advances in making finer and finer fibre have made wool suits acceptable for warmer weather, as fabrics have accordingly become lighter and more supple. Wool fabric is denominated by the weight of a one-square yard piece; thus, the heavier wools, suitable for winter only, are 12–14 oz.; the medium, &quot;three-season&quot; (i.e., excluding summer) are 10–11 oz.; and summer wools are 7–8 oz. (In the days before central heating, heavier wools such as 16 oz. were used in suits; now they are used mainly in overcoats and topcoats.) Other materials are used sometimes, either alone or blended with wool, such as cashmere. Silk alone or blended with wool is sometimes used. Synthetic materials, e.g., polyester, while cheaper, are very rarely recommended by experts. At most, a blend of predominantly wool may be acceptable to obtain the main benefit of synthetics, namely resistance to wrinkling, particularly in garments used for travel; however, any synthetic, blended or otherwise, will always be warmer and clammier than wool alone. For hot weather, linen is also used, and in the Southern United States, cotton seersucker is worn.
The main four colours for suits worn in business are black, light grey, dark grey, and navy, either with or without patterns. In particular, grey flannel suiting has been worn very widely since the 1930s. In non-business settings or less-formal business contexts, brown is another important colour; olive also occurs. In summer, lighter shades such as tan or cream are popular.
For non-business use, tweed has been popular since Victorian times and still is commonly worn. A wide range of colour is available, including muted shades of green, brown, red, and grey. Tweeds are usually checked, or plain with a herringbone weave, and are most associated with the country. While full tweed suits are not worn by many now, the jackets are often worn as sports jackets with odd trousers (trousers of different cloth).
The most conventional suit has two or three buttons and is either medium-to-dark grey or navy. Other conservative colours are grey, black, and olive. White and light blues are acceptable at some events, especially in the warm season. Red and the brighter greens are usually considered &quot;unconventional&quot; and &quot;garish&quot;. Tradition calls for a gentleman&#x27;s suit to be of decidedly plain colour, with splashes of bright colour reserved for shirts, neckties or kerchiefs.

In the United States and the United Kingdom, around the start of the 20th century, lounge suits were never traditionally worn in plain black, this colour instead being reserved for formal wear (including dinner jackets or strollers) and for undertakers. However, the decline of formal wear since the 1950s and the rise of casual wear in 1960s allowed the black suit to return to fashion, as many designers began wanting to move away from the business suit toward more fashion suits.

Traditional business suits are generally in solid colours or with pinstripes; windowpane checks are also acceptable. Outside business, the range of acceptable patterns widens, with plaids such as the traditional glen plaid and herringbone, though apart from some very traditional environments such as London banking, these are worn for business now, as well. The colour of the patterned element (stripes, plaids, and checks) varies by gender and location. For example, bold checks, particularly with tweeds, have fallen out of use in the US, while they continue to be worn as traditional in Britain. Some unusual old patterns such as diamonds are now rare everywhere.

Inside the jacket of a suit, between the outer fabric and the inner lining, there is a layer of sturdy interfacing fabric to prevent the wool from stretching out of shape; this layer of cloth is called the canvas after the fabric from which it was traditionally made. Expensive jackets have a &quot;floating canvas&quot;, while cheaply manufactured models have a &quot;fused&quot; (glued) canvas. A fused canvas is less soft and, if poorly done, damages the suppleness and durability of the jacket, so many tailors are quick to deride fused canvas as being less durable, particularly since they may tend to permanently pucker along the jacket&#x27;s edges after some use or a few dry cleanings. However, some selling this type of jacket claim that the difference in quality is very small. A few London tailors state that all bespoke suits should use a floating canvas.

===Jacket===
====Front buttons====

Most single-breasted suits have two or three buttons, and four or more buttons are unusual. Dinner jackets (&quot;black tie&quot;) usually have only one button. It is rare to find a suit with more than four buttons, although zoot suits can have as many as six or more due to their longer length. There is also variation in the placement and style of buttons, since the button placement is critical to the overall impression of height conveyed by the jacket. The centre or top button will typically line up quite closely with the natural waistline. The bottom button is usually not meant to be buttoned and so the jacket is cut such that buttoning the bottom button would ruin the lines and drape of the jacket. It is customary to keep the jacket buttoned while standing and to unbutton the jacket while seated.

Double-breasted jackets have only half their outer buttons functional, as the second row is for display only, forcing them to come in pairs. Some rare jackets can have as few as two buttons, and during various periods, for instance the 1960s and 70s, as many as eight were seen. Six buttons are typical, with two to button; the last pair floats above the overlap. The three buttons down each side may in this case be in a straight line (the &#x27;keystone&#x27; layout) or more commonly, the top pair is half as far apart again as each pair in the bottom square. A four-button double-breasted jacket usually buttons in a square. The layout of the buttons and the shape of the lapel are co-ordinated in order to direct the eyes of an observer. For example, if the buttons are too low, or the lapel roll too pronounced, the eyes are drawn down from the face, and the waist appears larger. There seems to be no clear rule as to on which side the overlap should lie. It usually crosses naturally with the left side to the fore but not invariably. Generally, a hidden button holds the underlap in place.

====Lapels====


The jacket&#x27;s lapels can be notched (also called &quot;stepped&quot;), peaked (&quot;pointed&quot;), shawl, or &quot;trick&quot; (Mandarin and other unconventional styles). Each lapel style carries different connotations and is worn with different cuts of suit. Notched lapels, the most common of the three, are usually only found on single-breasted jackets and are the most informal style. They are distinguished by a 75-to-90 degree &quot;notch&quot; at the point where the lapel meets the collar. Peaked lapels have sharp edges that point upward towards the shoulders. Double-breasted jackets usually have peaked lapels, although peaked lapels are sometimes found on single breasted jackets as well. Shawl lapels are a style derived from the Victorian informal evening wear, and as such are not normally seen on suit jackets except for tuxedos or dinner suits. For black tie events, only jackets with pointed and shawl lapels should be worn.

In the 1980s, double-breasted suits with notched lapels were popular with power suits and the New Wave style.

In the late 1920s and 1930s, a design considered very stylish was the single-breasted peaked-lapel jacket. This has gone in and out of vogue periodically, being popular once again during the 1970s, and is still a recognised alternative. The ability to properly cut peaked lapels on a single-breasted suit is one of the most challenging tailoring tasks, even for very experienced tailors.

The width of the lapel is a varying aspect of suits and has changed over the years. The 1930s and 1970s featured exceptionally wide lapels, whereas during the late 1950s and most of the 1960s suits with very narrow lapels—often only about wide—were in fashion. The 1980s saw mid-size lapels with a low gorge (the point on the jacket that forms the &quot;notch&quot; or &quot;peak&quot; between the collar and front lapel). Current (mid-2000s) trends are towards a narrower lapel and higher gorge. Necktie width usually follows the width of the jacket lapel.

Lapels also have a buttonhole, intended to hold a boutonnière, a decorative flower. These are now only commonly seen at more formal events. Usually, double-breasted suits have one hole on each lapel (with a flower just on the left), while single-breasted suits have just one on the left.

====Pockets====

Most jackets have a variety of inner pockets and two main outer pockets, which are generally either patch pockets, flap pockets, or jetted (&quot;besom&quot;) pockets.
The patch pocket is, with its single extra piece of cloth sewn directly onto the front of the jacket, a sporting option, sometimes seen on summer linen suits or other informal styles. The flap pocket is standard for side pockets, and has an extra lined flap of matching fabric covering the top of the pocket. A jetted pocket is most formal, with a small strip of fabric taping the top and bottom of the slit for the pocket. This style is most often on seen on formalwear, such as a dinner jacket.

A breast pocket is usually found at the left side, where a pocket square or handkerchief can be displayed.

In addition to the standard two outer pockets and breast pocket, some suits have a fourth, the ticket pocket, usually located just above the right pocket and roughly half as wide. While this was originally exclusively a feature of country suits, used for conveniently storing a train ticket, it is now seen on some town suits. Another country feature also worn sometimes in cities is a pair of hacking pockets, which are similar to normal ones, but slanted; this was originally designed to make the pockets easier to open on horseback while hacking.

====Sleeves====
Suit jackets in all styles typically have three or four buttons on each cuff, which are often purely decorative (the sleeve is usually sewn closed and cannot be unbuttoned to open). Five buttons are unusual and are a modern fashion innovation. The number of buttons is primarily a function of the formality of the suit; a very casual summer sports jacket might traditionally (1930s) have had only one button, while tweed suits typically have three and city suits four. In the 1970s, two buttons were seen on some city suits. Today, four buttons are common on most business suits and even casual suits.

Although the sleeve buttons usually cannot be undone, the stitching is such that it appears they could. Functional cuff buttons may be found on high-end or bespoke suits; this feature is called a &quot;surgeon&#x27;s cuff&quot; and &quot;working button holes&quot; (U.S.). Some wearers leave these buttons undone to reveal that they can afford a bespoke suit, although it is proper to leave these buttons done up. Modern bespoke styles and high-end off-the-rack suits equipped with surgeon&#x27;s cuffs have the last two buttons stitched off-centre, so that the sleeve hangs more cleanly should the buttons ever be undone. Certainty in fitting sleeve length must be achieved, as once working button holes are cut, the sleeve length essentially cannot be altered further.

A cuffed sleeve has an extra length of fabric folded back over the arm, or just some piping or stitching above the buttons to allude to the edge of a cuff. This was popular in the Edwardian era, as a feature of formalwear such as frock coats carried over to informalwear, but is now rare.

====Vents====
A vent is a slit in the bottom rear (the &quot;tail&quot;) of the jacket. Originally, vents were a sporting option, designed to make riding easier, so are traditional on hacking jackets, formal coats such as a morning coat, and, for practicality, overcoats. Today there are three styles of venting: the single-vented style (with one vent at the centre), the ventless style, and the double-vented style (one vent on each side). Vents are convenient, particularly when using a pocket or sitting down, to improve the hang of the jacket, so are now used on most jackets. Ventless jackets are associated with Italian tailoring, while the double-vented style is typically British. Dinner jackets traditionally have no vents.

===Waistcoats===
Waistcoats (called &quot;vests&quot; in American English) were almost always worn with suits prior to the 1940s. Due to rationing during World War II, their prevalence declined, but their popularity has gone in and out of fashion from the 1970s onwards. A pocket watch on a chain, one end of which is inserted through a middle buttonhole, is often worn with a waistcoat; otherwise, since World War I, when they came to prominence of military necessity, men have worn wristwatches, which may be worn with any suit except the full evening dress (white tie). Although many examples of waistcoats worn with a double-breasted jacket can be found from the 1920s to the 1940s, that would be unusual today (one point of a double-breasted jacket being, it may be supposed, to eliminate the waistcoat). Traditionally, the bottom button of a waistcoat is left undone; like the vents in the rear of a jacket, this helps the body bend when sitting. Some waistcoats can have lapels; others do not.

===Trousers===
Suit trousers are always made of the same material as the jacket. Even from the 1910s to 1920s, before the invention of sports jackets specifically to be worn with odd trousers, wearing a suit jacket with odd trousers was seen as an alternative to a full suit. However, with the modern advent of sports jackets, suit jackets are always worn with matching trousers, and the trousers are worn with no jacket or the appropriate jacket.

Trouser width has varied considerably throughout the decades. In the 1920s, trousers were straight-legged and wide-legged, with a standard width at the cuff of . After 1935, trousers began to be tapered in at the bottom half of the leg. Trousers remained wide at the top of the leg throughout the 1940s. By the 1950s and 1960s, a more slim look had become popular. In the 1970s, suit makers offered a variety of styles of trousers, including flared, bell bottomed, wide-legged, and more traditional tapered trousers. In the 1980s, these styles disappeared in favor of tapered, slim-legged trousers.

One variation in the design of trousers is the use or not of pleats. The most classic style of trouser is to have two pleats, usually forward, since this gives more comfort sitting and better hang standing. This is still a common style, and for these reasons of utility has been worn throughout the 20th century. The style originally descended from the exaggeratedly widened Oxford bags worn in the 1930s in Oxford, which, though themselves short-lived, began a trend for fuller fronts. The style is still seen as the smartest, featuring on dress trousers with black and white tie. However, at various periods throughout the last century, flat-fronted trousers with no pleats have been worn, and the swing in fashions has been marked enough that the more fashion-oriented ready-to-wear brands have not produced both types continuously.

Turn-ups on the bottom of trousers, or cuffs, were initially popularised in the 1890s by Edward VII, and were popular with suits throughout the 1920s and 1930s. They have always been an informal option, being inappropriate on all formalwear.

Other variations in trouser style include the rise of the trouser. This was very high in the early half of the 20th century, particularly with formalwear, with rises above the natural waist, to allow the waistcoat covering the waistband to come down just below the narrowest point of the chest. Though serving less purpose, this high height was duplicated in the daywear of the period. Since then, fashions have changed, and have rarely been that high again, with styles returning more to low-rise trousers, even dropping down to have waistbands resting on the hips. Other changing aspects of the cut include the length, which determines the break, the bunching of fabric just above the shoe when the front seam is marginally longer than height to the shoe&#x27;s top. Some parts of the world, such as Europe, traditionally opt for shorter trousers with little or no break, while Americans often choose to wear a slight break.

A final major distinction is made in whether the trousers take a belt or braces (suspenders). While a belt was originally never worn with a suit, the forced wearing of belts during wartime years (caused by restrictions on use of elastic caused by wartime shortages) contributed to their rise in popularity, with braces now much less popular than belts. When braces were common, the buttons for attaching them were placed on the outside of the waistband, because they would be covered by a waistcoat or cardigan, but now it is more frequent to button on the inside of the trouser. Trousers taking braces are rather different in cut at the waist, employing extra girth and also height at the back. The split in the waistband at the back is in the &quot;fishtail&quot; shape. Those who prefer braces assert that, because they hang from the shoulders, they always make the trousers fit and hang exactly as they should, while a belt may allow the trouser waist to slip down on the hips or below a protruding midsection, and requires constant repositioning; also, they allow, indeed work best with, a slightly looser waist which gives room for natural expansion when seated.

Suit trousers, also known as dress pants in the US, are a style of trousers intended as formal, semi-formal, or informal wear. They are often made of either wool or polyester (although many other synthetic and natural textiles are used) and may be designed to be worn with a matching suit jacket. Suit trousers often have a crease in the front of each pant leg, and may have one or more pleats. Suit trousers can be worn at many formal and semi-formal occasions combined with a shirt that has no tie and a more relaxed fashion, which can be considered smart casual dress.

===Breeches===
As an alternative to trousers, breeches (or &quot;knickers&quot; in variations of English where this does not refer to underwear) may be worn with informal suits, such as tweed. These are shorter, descending to just below the knees, fastened closely at the top of the calf by a tab or button cuff. While once common, they are now typically only worn when engaged in traditional outdoor sports, such as shooting or golf. The length and design is closely related to the plus-fours (and plus-sixes etc.) worn for sport, but differ in having no bagginess. They are usually designed to be worn with long socks meeting just below the knee, but riding breeches, worn with long boots such as top boots, are long enough to meet the boot and display no sock.

===Accessories===
Accessories for suits include neckties, shoes, wristwatches and pocket watches, pocket squares, cufflinks, tie clips, tie tacks, tie bars, bow ties, lapel pins, and hats.

== Etiquette ==

===Buttoning the suit jacket===
The buttoning of the jacket is primarily determined by the &quot;button stance&quot;, a measure of how high the buttons are in relation to the natural waist. In some (now unusual) styles where the buttons are placed high, the tailor would have intended the suit to be buttoned differently from the more common lower stance. Nevertheless, some general guidelines are given here.

Double-breasted suit coats are almost always kept buttoned. When there is more than one functional buttonhole (as in a traditional six-on-two arrangement), only one button need be fastened; the wearer may elect to fasten only the bottom button, in order to present a longer line (a style popularised by Prince George, Duke of Kent).

Single-breasted suit coats may be either fastened or unfastened. In two-button suits the bottom button is traditionally left unfastened except with certain unusual cuts of jacket, e.g. the paddock. Legend has it that King Edward VII started the trend of leaving the bottom button of a suit as well as waistcoat undone. The reasoning for having only the top buttons and not the bottom button to continue being fastened is to avoid stressing of the fabric and is more comfortable for the wearer.

When fastening a three-button suit, the middle button is fastened, and the top one sometimes, but the bottom is traditionally not designed to be. Although in the past some three-button jackets were cut so that all three could be fastened without distorting the drape, this is no longer the case. A four-button suit is uncommon. The one-button suit has regained some popularity (it is also one of the classic styles of Savile Row tailoring). With a single-breasted suit, the buttons are usually unfastened while sitting down to avoid an ugly drape. A double-breasted suit is often able to be left buttoned, to avoid the difficulty of constantly redoing the inner button (the &quot;anchor button&quot;) when standing up.

===Shirts with suits===
===Socks with suits===
In the United States it is common for socks to match either the shoe (particularly black socks with black shoes) or the trouser leg. This latter is preferred as it makes the leg appear longer, provides a smoother visual transition between the pant leg and the shoe, and minimises the attention drawn by a trouser leg tailored to be too short. A more general rule is for socks to be darker than the shade of the trousers, but potentially a different, instead matching some other part of the outfit such as the shirt or necktie. With patterned socks, ideally the background colour of the sock should match the primary colour of the suit and the other colors should coordinate with other parts of the outfit.

Socks are preferably at least mid-calf height, if not knee-height (&quot;over-the-calf&quot;), and are usually made predominantly of cotton or wool, though luxury or dress socks may use more exotic blends such as silk and cashmere. Before World War II, patterned socks were common, and a variety of designs like Argyle or contrasting socks were commonly seen. After WWII, socks became more subdued in colour. In lieu of over-the-calf length (which will stay up by itself), some men still use garters to hold up their socks, but this is unusual.

===Women===


Suit-wearing etiquette for women generally follows the same guidelines used by men, with a few differences and more flexibility.

For women, the skirt suit or dress suit are both acceptable; a blouse, which can be white or coloured, usually takes the place of a shirt. Women&#x27;s suits can also be worn with coloured tops or T-shirts. Also, women usually wear suits in professional settings, rather than as general formal attire, as men do.

Women&#x27;s suits come in a larger variety of colours, such as darks, pastels, and gem colours.

Women generally do not wear neckties with their suits, but some do. Fancy silk scarves that resemble a floppy ascot tie became popular in North America in the 1970s. By the 1980s, women were entering the white-collar workforce in increasing numbers, and their dress fashions adopted looks not dissimilar from men&#x27;s business wear. By the early to mid-1980s, conservatively tailored skirt suits were the norm, in the same colours and fabrics considered standard in men&#x27;s suits. These were typically worn with buttoned-up collared blouses, usually white or some pastel in colour. These were frequently accessorised with a version of the bow tie, usually the same fabrics, colours, and patterns as men&#x27;s neckties and bow ties, but tied in a fuller bow at the collar. Pantyhose are worn with the skirt suit in black, nude or white.

==Fashion==
=== Western world ===

Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, the tailors of England, Italy, Spain, and France have been the leaders in the design of men&#x27;s suits. The slim-fitting mohair and sharkskin suits developed in London and Milan during the 1960s were widely imitated by the mod subculture, and underwent a large scale revival during the late 2000s to mid 2010s due to their association with James Bond and Don Draper from &quot;Mad Men&quot;.

Elsewhere in the Mediterranean, suits are considered impractical without constant air conditioning. As a result, most non-conservative businesses, regardless of size or wealth, tend to use casual clothes even in formal meetings. Some professions, such as banking, law, and certain government employees that deal directly with the public do have a more formal dress code.

==== United States ====
Because wearing a suit conveys a respectable image, many people wear suits during the job interview process. An interview suit is usually a conservative style, and often made of blue or grey fabric. Interview suits are frequently composed of wool or wool-blend fabric, with a solid or pin stripe pattern. The style of an interview suit, however, will depend on the organizational culture of the industry in which a person seeks employment.

In the Southwestern United States, men&#x27;s suits often feature detailing inspired by traditional Western wear, such as a pointed yoke and arrow pockets. Suit coats similar in appearance to the Ike jacket are also widespread, and it is common practice to wear cowboy boots instead of conventional dress shoes. Country music singers and modern pop stars like Post Malone or Brandon Flowers of The Killers sometimes wear flashy Nudie suits with rhinestones and intricate embroidery.

In modern society, men&#x27;s suits have become less common as an outfit of daily wear. During the 1990s, driven in part by the meteoric rise of newly successful technology companies with different cultural attitudes, the prevailing management philosophy of the time moved in favour of more casual attire for employees; the aim was to encourage a sense of openness and egalitarianism. &quot;Business casual&quot; dress still tends to be the norm for most workers up to and sometimes including mid-level management. Traditional business dress as an everyday style has been prevalent in middle- and upper-level corporate management (now sometimes collectively referred to as &quot;suits&quot;), and the professions (particularly law). Over time, suits have become less common at the executive level aside for job candidates and formal events, remaining in widespread use at other lives such as among middle-class hotel clerks and salespeople. Casual dress has also become common in Western academic institutions, with traditional business attire falling in popularity.

For many men who do not wear suits for work, particularly in Western society, wearing a suit is reserved for special occasions, such as weddings, funerals, court appearances, and other more formal social events. Hence, because they are not a daily outfit for most men, they are often viewed as being &quot;stuffy&quot; and uncomfortable. The combination of a tie, belt and waistcoat can be tight and restrictive compared to contemporary casual wear, especially when these are purchased at minimal cost and quality for rare occasions, rather than being made to be worn comfortably. This tendency became prevalent enough that the Christian Science Monitor reported that a heavy jacket combined with a necktie and flimsy slacks was &quot;a design that guarantees that its wearer will be uncomfortable&quot; at any temperature. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, men&#x27;s suits became less commonly worn, in much the same way that skirts and dresses were dropped by many women in favour of trousers. This was seen as a liberation from the conformity of earlier periods and occurred concurrently with the women&#x27;s liberation movement.

Also remarkable is that the suit now frequently appears in Rock, Heavy Metal and Gothic happenings, even though such groups were once known for a rather rebellious tradition of clothing. Artists and bands such as Nick Cave, Interpol, Marilyn Manson, Blutengel, Albert Hammond Jr of The Strokes and Akercocke are known for the use of formal clothing in music videos and stage performances. The suit also appears when fans dress for styles such as Lolita, Victorian and Corporate Gothic.

===East and South Asia===
In 20th-century China, the Communist regime encouraged citizens to wear the Mao suit due to its egalitarian and utilitarian design.

After the independence of India, there was a backlash against Western fashions due to their association with the previous colonialist regime. Instead, professional Indian men began wearing the five button Nehru suit, made from khadi to support the local textile industry. During the 1960s, these suits became fashionable among the British mod subculture due to their use by The Beatles. These made a brief comeback during the mid 2000s, but since 2010 they have been out of fashion in the West.

In the tropical Philippines, a former colony of the United States of America, a suit is called &quot;terno&quot;; the jacket that comes with it is called &quot;amerikana&quot;. Because of the hot tropical climate, this formal wear is worn only when necessary, including formal, social or business events. Filipinos rarely wear a suit, and the youth would probably wear one only to a high school or college prom, in which case it might be rented. At any occasion where a suit is worn, it would also be acceptable to wear a long-sleeved or a short-sleeved barong tagalog, the national dress of the Philippines.

<text>The White River National Wildlife Refuge (officially Dale Bumpers White River National Wildlife Refuge) is a wildlife refuge located in Desha, Monroe, Phillips, and Arkansas counties in the U.S. state of Arkansas. The refuge is managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. White River NWR borders on Cache River National Wildlife Refuge at its northern boundary. In 1974, the White River Sugarberry Natural Area was designated as a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service.

In 2013, the FWS proposed the gradual expansion of the refuge up to a maximum of .

==Description==

White River National Wildlife Refuge was created in 1935. The refuge is wide and encompassing of the lower of the White River. It also includes of the Arkansas Post Canal which is part of the Army Corps of Engineers&#x27; McClellan-Kerr Navigation System on the Arkansas River.

This refuge has the largest concentration of wintering mallard ducks in the Mississippi Flyway. It also has large concentrations of snow and Canada geese. This refuge is home to four active bald eagle nests and a black bear population. Black bears have increased in numbers from about 25 in the 1940s to more than 300.

The refuge lies with the Mississippi lowland forests ecoregion. Within the refuge, the Sugarberry Natural Area includes a old-growth bottomland hardwood forest of varied composition. The area contains four forest types: American sweetgum, Nuttall&#x27;s oak, willow oak; sugarberry, American elm, green ash; American sycamore, pecan, American elm; and baldcypress.

The refuge has 356 natural and man-made lakes which make up of the refuge. There are of forestland, of agricultural land, and of grassland.

The refuge is classified as a Wetland of International Importance.

==Expansion proposal==

In 2013, federal government designated the White River watershed as the nation&#x27;s second &quot;National Blueway&quot;. Later that year, the Fish and Wildlife Service proposed that the White River NWR be expanded. 
The expansion proposal calls for the refuge to be expanded from the present to as much as . The expansion would be carried out by purchasing land from willing sellers as funds are available from Federal Duck Stamps, the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund, and the Land and Water Conservation Fund.

The proposed expansion would add to the refuge 9 miles of White River floodplain, 26 miles of the Arkansas River, and 34 miles of the west bank of the Mississippi River. The land would provide additional habitat for a variety of birds, fishes, and other animals. The expansion would also be important for the preservation and restoration of Arkansas&#x27;s &quot;Big Woods,&quot; a floodplain forest of which less than 10 percent remains intact.

The Fish and Wildlife Service has also proposed expansion of the Cache River National Wildlife Refuge, which borders the White River NWR on the north. The proposed expansions, if fully implemented, would preserve almost of land in the White River watershed. Additional parcels of conservation land owned by the state of Arkansas and private conservation groups are contiguous with the national wildlife refuges.

==Name of refuge==
In 2014, the refuge was officially renamed &quot;Dale Bumpers White River National Wildlife Refuge&quot;, in honor of former Arkansas Governor and Senator Dale Bumpers. At a dedication ceremony, Daniel M. Ashe, Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, said:

The Service is proud to recognize the many contributions Senator Bumpers has made to give many future generations the same opportunity to enjoy Arkansas&#x27; natural beauty as we have had. He is a giant among conservationists and a visionary who followed an unconventional path to set aside some of Arkansas&#x27; last wild places. It is fitting that he will be forever linked with the White River.

<doc id="339787" wikidata="Q57428" url="?curid=339787" title="George V of Hanover">
<text>George V (Georg Friedrich Alexander Karl Ernst August; 27 May 1819 – 12 June 1878) was the last king of Hanover, reigning from 18 November 1851 to 20 September 1866. The only child of King Ernest Augustus and Queen Frederica, he succeeded his father in 1851. George&#x27;s reign was ended by the Austro-Prussian War, after which Prussia annexed Hanover.

==Early life==

George was born on 27 May 1819 in Berlin, the only son of Prince Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale. Ernest Augustus was the fifth son of George III of the United Kingdom and his wife, Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. Prince George&#x27;s mother was Princess Frederica, niece of Queen Charlotte, the daughter of Charles II, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz and Frederica of Hesse-Darmstadt. George was seventh in the line of succession to the British throne at birth and later became the son of the heir presumptive.

Prince George was baptised on 8 July 1819 at a hotel in Berlin where his parents were staying, by the Rev. Henry Thomas Austen (brother of author Jane Austen). His godparents were the Prince Regent (represented by the Duke of Cumberland), the King of Prussia, the Emperor of Russia, the Crown Prince of Prussia, Prince William of Prussia, Prince Frederick of Prussia, Prince Henry of Prussia, Prince and Princess William of Prussia, the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, Duke Charles of Mecklenburg, the Dowager Empress of Russia, the Queen of the Netherlands, Princess Augusta Sophia of the United Kingdom, the Hereditary Princess of Hesse-Homburg, the Duchess of Gloucester and Edinburgh, Princess Sophia of the United Kingdom, Princess Alexandrine of Prussia, the Hereditary Princess of Hesse-Kassel, the Duchess of Anhalt-Dessau, Princess Ferdinand of Prussia, Princess Louisa of Prussia, and Princess Radziwiłł.

George spent his childhood in Berlin and in Great Britain. He lost the sight of one eye following a childhood illness in 1828, and in the other eye following an accident in 1833. His father had hoped that the young prince might marry his cousin, the future Queen Victoria, who was older by three days, thus keeping the British and Hanoverian thrones united. However, nothing came of the plan.

==Crown Prince==
Upon the death of King William IV and the accession of Queen Victoria to the British throne, the 123-year personal union of the British and Hanoverian thrones ended because Hanover&#x27;s semi-Salic law prevented a woman from ascending its throne. The Duke of Cumberland succeeded to the Hanoverian throne as Ernest Augustus, and Prince George became the Crown Prince of Hanover. As a legitimate descendant of George III in the male line, he remained a member of the British royal family and second in line to the British throne until the birth of Queen Victoria&#x27;s first child, Victoria, Princess Royal, in 1840. Since he was totally blind, there were doubts as to whether the Crown Prince was qualified to succeed as king of Hanover, but his father decided that he should do so.

==Marriage==
George married, on 18 February 1843, at Hanover, Princess Marie of Saxe-Altenburg, the eldest daughter of Joseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg, by his wife, Duchess Amelia of Württemberg.

==King of Hanover==
The Crown Prince succeeded his father as the King of Hanover and Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg as well as Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale, in the Peerage of Great Britain and Earl of Armagh, in the Peerage of Ireland, on 18 November 1851, assuming the style George V.

From his father and from his maternal uncle, Prince Charles Frederick of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, one of the most influential men at the Prussian court, George had learned to take a very high and autocratic view of royal authority. During his 15-year reign, he engaged in frequent disputes with the Hanoverian &quot;Landtag&quot; (parliament).

Unlike his father, the King had a deep aversion to Prussia, which bordered on the Kingdom of Hanover in the west and east. George was generally supportive of the Austrian Empire in the Diet of the German Confederation. He also refused Prussia permission to build the railway line from the Prussian garrison town of Minden to the Prussian naval port in Wilhelmshaven.

Against the decision of his parliament, he refused to agree to the Prussian demand for neutrality and thus a break with the German Confederation in the upcoming German War, but joined the other loyal central states. As the Austro-Prussian War started, the Prussian government sent a dispatch on 15 June 1866 demanding that Hanover enter into an alliance with them and Hanoverian troops submit to their authority or face war. Despite previously having concluded that Hanover could not win an armed confrontation with Prussia, George remained protective of his throne and refused the ultimatum. Contrary to the wishes of the parliament, Hanover joined the Austrian camp in the war. As a result, the 20,600-strong Hanoverian Army surrendered on 29 June 1866 following the Battle of Langensalza, although tactically successful but hopelessly outnumbered in soldiers. George V had joined his army headquarters in Göttingen. The Kingdom of Hanover was then occupied by Prussian troops. Austria lost the war and several of its Central German allies were annexed by Prussia, such as the Electorate of Hesse and the Duchy of Nassau. George firmly rejected an abdication in favour of his son Ernest Augustus, as suggested by Queen Marie in order to be able to possibly save the existence of the Kingdom.

The Prussian government formally annexed Hanover on 20 September 1866, despite the King of Prussia, William I, being a first cousin of King George V of Hanover; their mothers were sisters. The deposed King never renounced his rights to the defunct throne or acknowledged Prussia&#x27;s actions. He went into exile in Austria. While the Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I successfully campaigned for the continuation of the Kingdom of Saxony at the Prague peace negotiations, he did nothing to prevent the annexation of Hanover. The Prussian interest in the land bridge between the two parts of Prussia seemed to leave him little hope.

Queen Marie with their children stayed at Marienburg Castle (Hanover) for a year, but then followed her husband. They initially lived in Vienna, where George bought a house that is now the Czech Embassy, but in 1868 bought a summer villa in Gmunden, Austria, which they soon used as their main residence.

From exile he appealed in vain for the European great powers to intervene on behalf of Hanover. From 1866 to 1870, George V maintained the Guelphic Legion partially at his own expense, hoping that a Franco-Prussian war would lead to the reconquest of his kingdom. In Paris he had the magazine &quot;Situation&quot; published, which daily attacked the new order of things in Germany in the most violent terms and fueled France&#x27;s hatred of a Germany that was becoming more and more Prussian. Much to his disappointment, Napoleon III lost the Franco-Prussian War in 1871.

All of this ultimately led to Prussia suspending financial compensation that had already been promised and confiscating his private assets. The Prussian Prime Minister Otto von Bismarck had the sequestered assets, the so-called &quot;Guelph Fund&quot;, managed by a special Prussian commission in Hanover and used the proceeds &quot;to combat Guelph activities&quot;.

While in exile, he was appointed an honorary full general in the British army in 1876.

==Death==
George V died at his residence in the Rue de Presbourg, Paris, on 12 June 1878. He had come there to seek financial and political support for a re-establishment of his legion. After a funeral service in the Lutheran Church at the Rue Chaucat, his body was removed to England and buried in St George&#x27;s Chapel at Windsor Castle.

==Legacy==
The King supported industrial development. In 1856 the &quot;Georgs-Marien-Bergwerks- und Hüttenverein&quot; was founded which was named after him and his wife. The company erected an iron and steel works which gave the city Georgsmarienhütte its name.

<text>Television news in the United States has evolved over many years. It has gone from a simple 10- to 15-minute format in the evenings, to a variety of programs and channels. Today, viewers can watch local, regional and national news programming, in many different ways, any time of the day.

==Origin of television news==

Lowell Thomas hosted the first-ever, regularly scheduled news broadcast on American television in March 1940; it was a simulcast of his nightly 6:45 PM NBC network radio newscast, with the television broadcast seen only in New York City over what was then experimental TV station W2XBS. The television simulcast lasted for only a few months. In June 1941, W2XBS became pioneering NBC television station WNBT (now WNBC).

The first serious attempt at dedicated television news broadcasts in the United States was by CBS. Upon becoming commercial station WCBW (now WCBS-TV) in 1941, the pioneer New York CBS television station broadcast two daily news programs, at 2:30 and 7:30 p.m. weekdays, most of the newscasts featuring Richard Hubbell reading a script with only occasional cutaways to a map or still photograph.

When Pearl Harbor was bombed on Sunday, December 7, 1941, Ray Forrest, WNBT’s announcer, broke into the broadcast of the movie Millionaire Playboy with news of the attack. According to The Magic Window: American Television, 1939-1953, news of the attack on Pearl Harbor constituted television’s first bulletin and Sam Cuff of WNBT’s &quot;Face of the War&quot; stood in front of a map showing viewers where the Japanese attacks occurred.

WCBW (which was usually off the air on Sunday to give the engineers a day off), took to the air at 8:45 PM with an extensive special report. The national emergency even broke down the unspoken wall between CBS radio and television. WCBW executives convinced radio announcers and experts such as George Fielding Elliot and Linton Wells to come down to the Grand Central Station studios during the evening and give information and commentary on the attack. The WCBW special report that night lasted less than ninety minutes, but that special broadcast pushed the limits of live television in 1941 and opened up new possibilities for future broadcasts. As CBS wrote in a special report to the FCC, the unscheduled live news broadcast on December 7 “was unquestionably the most stimulating challenge and marked the greatest advance of any single problem faced up to that time.” Additional newscasts were scheduled in the early days of the war.

In May 1942, WCBW (like almost all television stations) sharply cut back its live program schedule and the newscasts were canceled, since the station temporarily suspended studio operations, resorting exclusively to the occasional broadcast of films. This was primarily due to the fact that much of the staff had either joined the service or were redeployed to war related technical research, and to prolong the life of the early, unstable cameras which were now impossible to repair due to the wartime lack of parts. In May, 1944, as the war began to turn in favor of the Allies, WCBW reopened the studios and the newscasts returned, briefly anchored by Ned Calmer, and then by Everett Holles.

After the war, expanded news programs appeared on the WCBW schedule—renamed WCBS-TV in 1946—first anchored by Milo Boulton, and later by Douglas Edwards. On May 3, 1948, Douglas Edwards began anchoring &quot;CBS Television News&quot;, a regular 15-minute nightly newscast on the rudimentary CBS Television Network, including WCBS-TV. It aired every weeknight at 7:30 PM, and was the first regularly scheduled, network television news program featuring an anchor (as mentioned, the nightly Lowell Thomas NBC radio network newscast was simulcast on television locally on NBC&#x27;s WNBT—now WNBC—for a time in the early 1940s and the previously mentioned Richard Hubbell, Ned Calmer, Everett Holles and Milo Boulton on WCBW in the early and mid-1940s, but these were local television broadcasts seen only in New York City). The NBC Television Network&#x27;s regularly scheduled news offering at the time &quot;NBC Television Newsreel&quot; was simply film with voice narration.

In 1950, the name of the nightly news was changed to &quot;Douglas Edwards and the News&quot;, and the following year, it became the first news program to be broadcast on both coasts, thanks to a new coaxial cable connection, prompting Edwards to use the greeting &quot;Good evening everyone, coast to coast.&quot; The broadcast was renamed the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; when Walter Cronkite replaced Edwards in 1962. Edwards remained with CBS News with various daytime television newscasts and radio news broadcasts until his retirement on April 1, 1988.

==History of network news==

There were irregularly scheduled, quasi-network newscasts originating from NBC&#x27;s WNBT in New York City and reportedly fed to WPTZ (now KYW-TV) in Philadelphia and WRGB in Schenectady, NY prior to the regularly scheduled &quot;NBC Television Newsreel&quot;, such as Esso sponsored news features as well as &quot;The Face of War&quot; and &quot;The War As It Happens&quot;. In the final days of World War II, irregularly scheduled NBC television news and newsreel programs were broadcast which were also seen in New York, Philadelphia and Schenectady on the relatively few (roughly 5,000) television sets which existed at the time (early to mid 1940s). Later in 1948, when sponsored by Camel Cigarettes, &quot;NBC Television Newsreel&quot; was renamed &quot;Camel Newsreel Theatre&quot; and then, when John Cameron Swayze was added as an on-camera anchor in 1949, the program was renamed &quot;Camel News Caravan&quot;.

On CBS in 1948, &quot;CBS Television News&quot; premiered on the network in May with on-camera anchor Douglas Edwards, later retitled &quot;Douglas Edwards and the News.&quot; CBS Television also featured public affairs programs such as &quot;Longines Chronoscope&quot; which featured newsworthy public figures, and which ran from June 1951 to April 1955 at 11pm ET.

The DuMont Television Network had &quot;The Walter Compton News&quot; (June 1947 – 1948), &quot;I.N.S. Telenews&quot; and &quot;Camera Headlines&quot; (1948–1949), and &quot;DuMont Evening News&quot; (September 1954 – 1 April 1955).

However, Edward R. Murrow is widely regarded as the most important figure in the early days of U.S. television news. On his weekly news show &quot;See It Now&quot; on CBS, Murrow presented live reports from journalists on both the east and west coasts of the United States—the first program with live simultaneous transmission from coast to coast. &quot;See It Now&quot; focused on a number of controversial issues, but its most memorable moment was a 30-minute special on March 9, 1954, entitled &quot;A Report on Senator Joseph McCarthy,&quot; which contributed to the eventual political downfall of the senator.

===Expansion from 15 to 30 minutes===
NBC&#x27;s &quot;Camel Newsreel Theatre&quot; was later expanded to 15 minutes and renamed &quot;Camel News Caravan&quot; when John Cameron Swayze was added as an on-camera anchor in 1949. The show was succeeded by the &quot;Huntley-Brinkley Report&quot; in 1956, featuring a duo-anchor format with Chet Huntley and David Brinkley. On September 9, 1963, the &quot;Huntley-Brinkley Report&quot; expanded to 30 minutes, following a similar move by CBS. It was renamed &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; in 1970, after Huntley&#x27;s retirement. Initially, &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; was presented by two anchors from a rotating group of three: Brinkley, John Chancellor, and Frank McGee. A year later, Chancellor became sole anchor, and Brinkley provided commentaries. (McGee became host of &quot;Today&quot;.) In 1976, Brinkley rejoined the program as co-anchor. He continued in that role until 1979, when Chancellor resumed anchoring the program solo. Chancellor moved to the role of commentator in 1982 and was succeeded by a team of Tom Brokaw in New York and Roger Mudd in Washington. Brokaw became sole anchor in 1983.

CBS launched &quot;CBS Television News&quot; in May 1948 to compete against the NBC newsreel programs, hosted on camera by Douglas Edwards, it was renamed &quot;Douglas Edwards with the News&quot; in 1950. In 1962, Walter Cronkite landed the anchor seat, which he would hold until 1981, and the program&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;. On September 2, 1963, the show expanded from 15 to 30 minutes. In the 1970s, &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; was the dominant newscast on American television, and Cronkite was often cited as the &quot;most trusted man in America.&quot; After Cronkite&#x27;s retirement in 1981, Dan Rather became the anchor of &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;. He was joined by co-anchor Connie Chung from 1993 to 1995.

&quot;ABC Evening News&quot; began airing in 1953, hosted by John Charles Daly. Daly had been a well-known CBS radio correspondent, though today he is best remembered as the emcee of CBS&#x27;s long-running game show, &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, which he hosted while serving as ABC&#x27;s anchorman. Daly left ABC in 1960 and was succeeded by a frequently expanding list of successors that included John Cameron Swayze, Bill Laurence, Bill Sheehan, Ron Cochran, a young Peter Jennings, and Bob Young. In 1968, Frank Reynolds became anchor of the program, and it soon expanded from 15 minutes to 30 minutes. A year later, Howard K. Smith joined as co-anchor, reporting from Washington. In early 1971, Harry Reasoner left CBS News and replaced Reynolds as the New York anchor. Reasoner became the sole anchor in 1975, and Smith provided commentaries. In 1976, Barbara Walters joined the program as Reasoner&#x27;s co-anchor in New York, thus becoming the first woman to serve as a regular network news anchor. (Marlene Sanders had previously served as an occasional substitute anchor). Other women who would occasionally appear in daytime and weekend anchor roles in earlier days were Pauline Frederick of ABC and NBC and Nancy Dickerson of NBC. From the early 1970s forward, females such as Lesley Stahl of CBS, Carole Simpson of ABC and Jessica Savitch of NBC began to appear in significant on-camera newscasting roles. Reasoner was very unhappy with the addition of Walters, and the two did not work well together. With Roone Arledge as President of ABC News, the ABC Evening News was rebranded as &quot;ABC World News Tonight&quot; around 1977 with a trio of anchors: Frank Reynolds, Peter Jennings and Max Robinson. Jennings assumed solo anchor responsibility in 1983 following Reynolds&#x27;s death.

===Jennings, Rather, Brokaw era===
Brokaw, Rather, and Jennings became the familiar faces of network news for more than two decades. But changes began in December 2004, when Brian Williams took over from Brokaw as anchor of &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;, after Brokaw&#x27;s well-anticipated retirement, announced in 2002. Rather also retired from the anchor seat of &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; in March 2005, albeit quite abruptly, after it was discovered that CBS used documents whose authenticity could not be verified in a report on George W. Bush&#x27;s Air National Guard record. Jennings stepped away from the network anchor seat as well in April 2005, after he announced that he had lung cancer and would undergo chemotherapy. After the announcement, &quot;ABC World News Tonight&quot; was hosted by Bob Woodruff and Elizabeth Vargas.

Jennings died in August 2005 and ABC named Vargas and Woodruff as co-anchors of the broadcast in January 2006. Later that month, Woodruff and cameraman Doug Vogt were injured in a roadside bomb attack while on assignment in Iraq. His injuries were so severe, it became apparent he would not return to the anchor chair, although he eventually recovered enough to return as an occasional correspondent. Vargas continued on the broadcast, until May 2006, when she announced she was stepping down and going on maternity leave.

===Post Jennings, Rather, Brokaw era===
On May 29, 2006, ABC named Charles Gibson as sole anchor of &quot;ABC World News Tonight&quot;. Two months later, ABC renamed the program &quot;World News with Charles Gibson&quot;. In February 2007, the program achieved the number one spot in the Nielsen ratings for nightly news broadcasts, overtaking &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;. This was ABC&#x27;s first victory since the week Peter Jennings died in August 2005, and the first time since 1996. &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; subsequently reclaimed the lead and currently maintains a steady lead over the other programs. On September 2, 2009, ABC announced that Mr. Gibson would retire from broadcasting at the end of 2009, and then be succeeded by Diane Sawyer. Sawyer in turn would leave the broadcast in 2014, and was replaced by David Muir.

At CBS, Bob Schieffer took over the anchor chair at &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; on an interim basis. In an effort by CBS to reach a younger audience, &quot;Today&quot;&#x27;s Katie Couric was made the new anchorperson. She is the first solo female anchor of a broadcast network&#x27;s flagship evening newscast. She stepped down in 2011 and was replaced by Scott Pelley. In 2017, it was abruptly announced that Scott Pelley would be leaving CBS Evening News. Anthony Mason acted as interim anchor until Jeff Glor was announced as the new anchor and took over on December 4, 2017. Glor would leave the CBS Evening News in May 2019, with Norah O&#x27;Donnell succeeding him as anchor in July of that year.

Scandal enveloped NBC&#x27;s Brian Williams after controversy over his accounts from the Iraq War and Hurricane Katrina, causing NBC to suspend Williams for six months starting February 2015. Lester Holt was named the broadcast&#x27;s interim anchor, and in June of that year, would become the permanent anchor for the &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;; Holt is the first African-American to be named as the sole weeknight anchor of a major network news broadcast.

==Today&#x27;s television news==

Today, electronic news gathering has enabled reporters to capture video and audio at greater ease and edit the footage faster than when film was used. Journalists have also employed microwave and satellite.

Television news programming in the U.S. can be separated into categories: local news, network news, and cable news.

===Local news===

Many local broadcast television stations have in-house news departments that produce their own newscasts. The content of the newscasts are geared towards viewers in specific Designated Market Areas in which the stations operate. In other words, the stories have a strong local focus, and are relevant to local lives. National or international stories may also make the top stories but local perspectives/reactions are featured in these stories.

Weather reports also play a very important role in local news as they are found in every local newscast. Compared to national news, local news provides more in-depth, regular and frequent coverage of weather reports relevant to a station&#x27;s viewing area. Traffic reports are featured especially during weekday morning newscasts. Sports news are also a major regular feature during evening newscasts, especially for local sports teams.

A station typically produces around five to seven hours of local news on weekdays and airs fewer hours on weekends. Some stations focus more on news, currently KTLA in the Greater Los Angeles area offers 73 and 1/2 hours per week in newscasts (Most of any US Broadcast Station). (11.5 hours each weekday, 6.5 hours on Saturdays and 7.5 hours on Sunday). Some stations produce newscasts for other stations. For instance, WPVI in Philadelphia produces a 22.00 newscast of Action News aired on WPHL.

===National network news===

Walt Disney Television, CBS Entertainment Group, and NBCUniversal Television and Streaming all operate news divisions, named ABC News, CBS News, and NBC News respectively. Their schedules are broadly similar, with minor exceptions.

Early weekday mornings, at 4:00AM Eastern Time, all three air half-hour programs, &quot;Good Morning America First Look&quot; on ABC, &quot;CBS News Mornings&quot; on CBS, and &quot;Early Today&quot; on NBC. &quot;Early Today&quot; is the highest rated of these programs. Most but not all of the networks&#x27; stations across the country air these early morning national newscasts.

Following local news, &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, &quot;CBS This Morning&quot;, and the &quot;Today&quot; show air. As of 2013, &quot;Good Morning America&quot; is the most watched morning news show in the United States, followed by &quot;Today&quot; and &quot;CBS This Morning&quot;. &quot;Good Morning America&quot; also airs on weekends, as does &quot;Weekend Today&quot;. &quot;CBS This Morning&quot; only has a Saturday edition. On Sundays, CBS instead airs &quot;CBS News Sunday Morning&quot;, a long-running arts and culture anthology. The top stories come in the first few segments of the show but as the minutes pass, the stories presented gradually shift to more lifestyle-oriented and light-hearted ones. These national morning newscasts have cut-ins to local weather and newscasts every half-hour. On weekdays, the shows air at 7:00 in each and every time zone but on weekends, they either air live or with a 1-hour tape delay from the original broadcast in all time zones. ABC&#x27;s and CBS&#x27; morning shows are two hours long, while &quot;Today&quot; has expanded to four hours. A mix of NBC, CBS, Fox, and The CW stations that air &quot;Live with Kelly and Ryan&quot;, especially in the east coast, tape-delay the hours preempted by this program.

On Sunday mornings, the networks air political interview programs. &quot;Meet the Press&quot; (which premiered November 6, 1947 on the NBC television network and is currently the world&#x27;s longest running television program) leads &quot;Face the Nation&quot; on CBS, &quot;This Week&quot; on ABC, and &quot;Fox News Sunday&quot; on the Fox network.

News briefs, a two-minute segment with a basic rundown of the largest stories of the day, formerly aired much more frequently on all four networks, including primetime. Currently however, the only network newsbreaks are carried by ABC and CBS in the afternoon leading out of their daytime lineups.

In the evenings, &quot;ABC World News Tonight with David Muir&quot;, &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;, and &quot;NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt&quot; are the networks&#x27; flagship news programs. After years of being largely similar, the programs have evolved to their own niches. &quot;World News&quot; emphasizes &quot;stories relevant to viewer&#x27;s lives&quot; delivered in Muir&#x27;s laid back style; the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; focuses prominently on business, political, and international stories delivered in a no-nonsense style; and &quot;Nightly News&quot; takes a middlebrow, folksy approach with a balance of &quot;hard&quot; and &quot;soft&quot; stories. All three shows air seven nights a week, but their titular hosts only appear on weeknights unless there is major breaking news during weekends. On weekdays, the evening newscasts air at 6:30 in most Eastern Time Zone and Los Angeles stations and 5:30 local time in most other time zones.

During primetime, all three networks air newsmagazine programs. ABC airs &quot;20/20&quot; Fridays at 10PM and &quot;Primetime&quot; Wednesdays at 10PM. &quot;20/20&quot; often airs 2 hour editions beginning at 9PM and &quot;Primetime&quot; is often expanded to multiple airings per week to fill holes in the schedule. &quot;Dateline NBC&quot; currently airs Tuesdays and Saturdays at 8PM on NBC, but like ABC&#x27;s programs frequently switches, adds, and drops timeslots to fill primetime. &quot;60 Minutes&quot; is the most popular of these programs, and also the most respected journalistically, but they rarely directly compete with one another.

On late weeknights, ABC aired &quot;Nightline&quot; at 11:30 PM for many years. The program is now seen at 12:35 a.m.. From 2 to 8 AM, CBS offers &quot;CBS News Roundup&quot;, a program consisting of repeats of features from other CBS News programs, interspersed with new news, weather, and sports updates. Few affiliates air the entire broadcast, but most air a substantial portion of it. ABC airs its eclectic &quot;World News Now&quot; from 2AM to 3:30AM, and many affiliates repeat a portion of it to fill time until &quot;America This Morning&quot;. NBC airs a repeat of the fourth hour of &quot;Today&quot; and talk show encores in these time periods.

Unlike ABC, CBS and NBC, Fox does not air national news programs or newsmagazines on weekdays. On Sundays it airs &quot;Fox News Sunday&quot;, produced by its sister channel Fox News. Fox does provide coverage of breaking news of major events such as presidential debates.

===Cable news===

The advent of cable television in the United States led to the eventual birth of cable news. On June 1, 1980, Ted Turner launched CNN, the first 24-hour cable news operation, and sister channel Headline News followed in 1982. CNN gained reputation significantly with its 1991 coverage of the Gulf War. The success of CNN inspired many other 24-hour cable news stations. In 1996, Fox News and MSNBC were launched to compete with CNN.

In 1981, the Financial News Network was launched, with a focus on finance and business news. CNBC was launched in 1989, and bought FNN in 1991. Bloomberg Television was launched in 1994, CNNfn in 1995, and Fox Business Network in 2007.

Regional cable news operations, such as New England Cable News, NY1, and Pittsburgh Cable News Channel, have also gained prominence among regional viewers.

The programming styles vary among these cable news channels, but often feature morning shows, along with blocks of rolling news coverage hosted by various personalities throughout the day. During the evening and primetime hours on weekdays, most cable news networks devote their lineups to opinion-based news and interview programs hosted by pundits. Most U.S. cable news networks do not provide live programming during the overnight hours aside from short updates at the top of the hour, electing to air repeats of their evening programming instead. Some networks may source late-night programming from a sister international news service, such as CNN International for CNN.

An increasing trend, especially in recent years is that cable networks have become more opinion-driven during the daytime. Fewer stories are covered but are reported with greater depth and opinion. Panelists representing both sides of an issue appear during most newscasts to discuss them, especially on issues of a political nature. Cable news networks also increasingly utilize newspaper reporters, particularly those affiliated with the New York Times and Washington Post to provide more details and offer their insights on top political stories. Since the 21st century, more explicitly ideological channels have arisen; in 2000, the left-wing nonprofit Free Speech TV took its modern form, while later entries included four conservative for-profit channels (Blaze TV, i24, OAN, Newsmax TV) and the alt-right InfoWars.

==Current development==

===Internet===
As the Internet becomes more prevalent in American lives, television news operations learn to adapt and embrace new technologies. Today, most television news operations would publish the text of the stories aired during their newscasts on their websites. Some of them, including all the network and national cable news operations, post videos of the stories for visitors to their websites. Most stations now offer a livestream of their local newscasts on their websites or mobile apps. This makes it possible for viewers outside a local station&#x27;s viewing area to see its newscasts. However some footage, notably sport footage, may be blocked from the livestream for rights reasons. Broadcast networks also offer their evening newscasts on their website and/or as a podcast. Cable networks provide livestreams of their channels as well as reruns of some of their programmes through their websites and mobile apps but access to those channels is restricted to viewers with an existing cable/satellite subscription that includes the channels in question.

Some anchors, reporters, and notable news programs also have blogs that take viewers behind the scenes of their news operation or provide a forum for either the personalities or viewers to air their opinions. In recent years, these news outlets have also provided an avenue for amateurs with digital or mobile phone cameras to send video created by them to be used in the broadcast and website.

Television journalists are acquiring skills for the convergence between television and the Internet. Social media has also become a fixture on the news as most networks, news programmes and key personalities maintain Facebook and Twitter accounts to let viewers get late breaking news, find out what&#x27;s going on behind the scenes, as well as give comments and questions.

=== Production and Newsgathering ===
Technological advancement is also changing the ways news is gathered and edited. The newsreel days are long gone. Reporters do not use film anymore. Television journalists are capturing images and sound on video and DV. Some stations even begin gathering and reporting news in high-definition television. Even editing and archiving systems are evolving, as more and more stations convert to non-linear editing systems, and storing file footage on computer servers rather than tapes.

With digital cable comes on-demand news programming. News operations slowly begin to feel the burden to generate news content on a 24-hour news cycle, while keeping material fresh on their regularly scheduled newscasts. This means around-the-clock coverage. Rather than having a certain deadline for scheduled newscasts to meet, reporters have to file stories as fast as they can. Producers, on the other hand, have to find more ways to keep news stories &quot;fresh&quot; to the viewers.

==Formats==

Over the years, television news in the U.S. has evolved into a variety of formats. Local news and network news, once similar in having slow paces and low story counts, are now quite different in styles and tunes.

===Traditional===

In the early days, local newscasts were seen more as a public service. The style was straightforward. A newscast was divided into three &quot;blocks&quot;: news, sports, and weather. The news block was divided into national, international, and local stories. These newscasts usually had a solo anchor, with others announcing sports and weather as well. The stories aired were generally not covering controversial or upsetting conflicts because the main purpose was to attract a wide audience in order to sell expensive commercial air time. This format is retained by some stations, though usually in smaller markets or higher education broadcasting training departments where there are not an abundance of everyday news stories.

===Eyewitness News===
In the late 1960s, Westinghouse Broadcasting, a division of Westinghouse Electric Corporation, devised a new format of local news called &quot;Eyewitness News&quot;. Reporters were hired to go out of the newsroom, become &quot;eyewitnesses&quot; of news stories, and record them on film. Later, these reporters were also asked to join the anchors in the studio to talk about the stories.

Al Primo created the format, which was first used on KYW-TV in Philadelphia. In 1968, Primo brought the format to WABC-TV in New York. The &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; format helped to introduce different anchor combinations to local newscasts. The format quickly became popular and was imitated by stations across the country.

Today, most television news operations in the United States utilize some variation of the &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; format.

===Action News===
&quot;Action News&quot; was introduced in 1970 by WPVI-TV in Philadelphia to compete against the &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; format at rival station KYW-TV. This format features short stories, high story counts, and a strong focus on spot news. It was called &quot;Action News&quot; because it produced a fast-paced style of newscast. Mel Kampmann of WPVI and Irv Weinstein of WKBW-TV in Buffalo, both owned by Capital Cities Communications, are credited with developing the key tenets of the &quot;Action News&quot; format. On May 11, 1977, Jim Gardner took over as solo anchor of the 6 PM and 11 PM newscasts at WPVI-TV until his retirement in 2022, and along with the theme song Move Closer to Your World, would define the Action News format for decades.

===Breaking news===

Formerly referred to as &quot;news bulletins,&quot; &quot;breaking news&quot; refers to any news of sufficient importance to warrant an interruption of regularly scheduled programming.

On a national network, programming interruptions are restricted to extremely urgent news. On the other hand, such breaks are now common on 24-hour news channels which often have an anchor available for live interruption at any time. However, in recent times, a &#x27;breaking news&#x27; banner has been used more frequently on cable news networks to often refer to a programme&#x27;s lead story.

===Franchise news===

&quot;Franchise news&quot; is a variation of Eyewitness News. Some stations decide to brand their news with slogans such as &quot;News you can use,&quot; &quot;Coverage you can count on,&quot; or &quot;On your side.&quot; The newscasts at these stations tend to focus more on franchises—stories that cover a topic important to local viewers. The most successful franchises are health and consumer news. Other franchises include parenting, pets, the environment, and crime fighting.

Almost every news operation uses some franchises, but a few stations build their news identities around these topical stories.

===News during sweeps===

During &quot;sweeps,&quot; newscasts often feature stories that are more sensationalized, in order to attract more viewers. Some stations save highly controversial investigative stories covered earlier for airing during sweeps.

News departments at television stations work closely with promotions departments during sweeps to create promotional spots throughout the day that will entice viewers to tune into the newscasts.

<doc id="339791" wikidata="Q701037" url="?curid=339791" title="Wang Zhaojun">
<text>Wang Qiang (Wang Ch&#x27;iang; 王牆, also 王檣 and 王嬙), commonly known by her courtesy name Wang Zhaojun () was known as one of the Four Beauties of ancient China. Born in Baoping Village, Zigui County (in current Hubei Province) in the Western Han dynasty (206 BC–8 AD), she was sent by Emperor Yuan to marry Chanyu Huhanye of the Xiongnu Empire in order to establish friendly relations with the Han dynasty through marriage.

In the most prevalent version of the &quot;Four Beauties&quot; legend, it is said that Wang Zhaojun left her hometown on horseback on a bright autumn morning and began a journey northward. Along the way, the horse neighed, making Zhaojun extremely sad and unable to control her emotions. As she sat on the saddle, she began to play sorrowful melodies on a &quot;pipa&quot; (a round-bodied lute that was later called &quot;ruanxian&quot;). A flock of geese flying southward heard the music, and saw the beautiful young woman riding the horse; they immediately forgot to flap their wings, and fell to the ground. From then on, Zhaojun acquired the nickname &quot;fells geese&quot; or &quot;drops birds.&quot;

==Life==
===Entering the harem===
Wang was born to a prominent family of Baopin Village, Zigui County (now Zhaojun Village, Xingshan County, Hubei) in the south of the Western Han empire. As she was born when her father was very old, he regarded her as &quot;a pearl in the palm&quot;. Wang Zhaojun was endowed with dazzling beauty with an extremely intelligent mind. She was adept in playing the pipa and also mastered the ancient &quot;Four Arts of the Chinese Scholar&quot; – the guqin, go, calligraphy and Chinese painting.

In 36 BC, Emperor Yuan of Han chose his concubines from the whole state. Because of Wang&#x27;s fame in the county, she was his first choice as concubine Nan County. Emperor Yuan issued an edict that Wang should enter his harem soon. Wang&#x27;s father said that his daughter was too young to enter the harem, but could not violate the decree. Wang left her hometown and entered the harem of Emperor Yuan in early summer. According to the custom in the palace, when choosing a new wife, the Emperor was first presented with portraits of all the candidate women. It is said that because of Wang&#x27;s confidence of beauty and temperament, she refused to bribe the artist Mao Yanshou as the other maids did. As a reprisal, Mao Yanshou painted a mole of widowed tears on Wang&#x27;s portrait. As a result, during her time in the Lateral Courts, Wang Zhaojun was never visited by the Emperor and remained as a palace lady-in-waiting. Wang Zhaojun&#x27;s portrait was either never viewed by the Emperor or was inaccurate, and therefore the Emperor overlooked her.

===Departing for the frontier===

In 33 BC, Huhanye visited Chang&#x27;an as part of the tributary system that existed between the Han and Xiongnu governments. He took the opportunity to request to become an imperial son-in-law, which is recorded by Lou Jingde.

Typically the daughter of a concubine would then be offered, but unwilling to honour Huhanye with a real princess, Emperor Yuan ordered that the plainest girl in the harem be selected. He asked for volunteers and promised to present her as his own daughter. The idea of leaving their homeland and comfortable life at court for the grasslands of the far and unknown north was abhorrent to most of the young women, but Wang Zhaojun accepted. When the matron of the harem sent her unflattering portrait to the Emperor, he merely glanced at it and nodded his approval. Only when summoned to court was Wang Zhaojun&#x27;s beauty revealed.

The Emperor considered retracting his decision, but it was too late by then, and he regretfully presented Wang Zhaojun to Huhanye, who was delighted. Relations with the Xiongnu subsequently improved, and artist Mao Yanshou was subsequently executed for deceiving the Emperor.

===Life with the Xiongnu===

Wang Zhaojun became a favourite of Huhanye Chanyu, giving birth to two sons. Only one, Yituzhiyashi (伊屠智牙師), seems to have survived. They also had two daughters, Yun (雲) known as Subu Juci (须卜居次) and Dangyu Juci(当于居次). Yun was created Princess Yimuo and would later become a powerful figure in Xiongnu politics.

When Huhanye died in 31 BC, Wang Zhaojun requested to return to China. Emperor Cheng, however, ordered that she follow Xiongnu levirate custom and become the wife of the next Chanyu, the eldest brother (or her stepson, born by her husband&#x27;s first wife) of her husband. In her new marriage, she had two daughters. Wang was honoured as Ninghu Yanzhi (寧胡閼氏 &quot;Hu-Pacifying Chief-Consort&quot;).

==Cultural legacy==

Statistics show that there are about 700 poems and songs and 40 kinds of stories and folktales about Wang Zhaojun from more than 500 famous writers, both ancient (Shi Chong, Li Bai, Du Fu, Bai Juyi, Li Shangyin, Zhang Zhongsu, Cai Yong, Wang Anshi, Yelü Chucai) and modern (Guo Moruo, Cao Yu, Tian Han, Jian Bozan, Fei Xiaotong, Lao She, Chen Zhisui).

<text>The City and Guilds of London Institute is an educational organisation in the United Kingdom. Founded on 11 November 1878 by the City of London and 16 livery companies to develop a national system of technical education, the institute has been operating under royal charter, granted by Queen Victoria, since 1900. The Prince of Wales, later King Edward VII, was appointed the first president of the institute.

The City and Guilds of London Institute is also a registered charity and is the awarding body for City &amp; Guilds and ILM qualifications, offering many accredited qualifications mapped onto the Regulated Qualifications Framework. The institute&#x27;s president is the Princess Royal who accepted this role in June 2011 (following her father the Duke of Edinburgh, who held the position for nearly 60 years), and the Chair of Council is Dame Ann Limb, who took office in 2021. City &amp; Guilds is composed of a number of businesses including ILM, Kineo, The Oxford Group, Digitalme, and Gen2.

==History==
A meeting of 16 of the City of London&#x27;s livery companies in 1876 led to the foundation of the City and Guilds of London Institute for the Advancement of Technical Education (CGLI), which aimed to improve the training of craftsmen, engineering technicians, engineering technologists, and professional engineers. The two main objectives were to create a Central Institution in London and to conduct a system of qualifying examinations in technical subjects.

Unable at once to find a large enough site within the City of London for their Central Institution, the CGLI occupied a building on land alongside Exhibition Road in South Kensington, although its headquarters were in Gresham College in the City. At the time John Watney was both secretary to the Gresham Committee and the CGLI. Evening classes were offered at a school on Cowper Street, off City Road, enabling instruction in chemistry and physics to be provided to those who wished to continue their education after working during the day. The school proved such a success that new premises had to be found in nearby Leonard Street, which was formally opened on 19 February 1893 as Finsbury Technical College. The institute&#x27;s director at the time was Sir Philip Magnus, later University MP. Finsbury College was intended as the first of a number of feeder colleges for the Central Institution but was almost the only one founded. Finsbury College continued its separate existence until 1926.

The City &amp; Guilds of London Art School was established in 1854, as one of the first Government Schools of Design, in Kennington, south London. It was originally named Lambeth School of Art and was set up to provide training in carving, modelling, and architectural decoration. In 1879 the art school began a close working relationship with the City and Guilds Institute. This lasted until 1971 when the art school became an independent charity. The art school focuses on undergraduate and postgraduate study of fine art, stone, and wood carving, and the conservation of three-dimensional cultural artefacts, books, and paper. The City and Guilds Institute maintains a link with the art school through its charitable grant support of projects delivering Widening Participation activity.

Since 2015, the City &amp; Guilds Group has moved back into delivering training as well as offering qualifications. This was originally through its acquisition of the Oxford Group but has since included the acquisition of Adelaide-based e3Learning, an Australian corporate e-learning and compliance provider, and the Cumbrian-based specialist nuclear industry training provider Gen2.

===City and Guilds College===

Faced with their continuing inability to find a substantial site, the companies were eventually persuaded by the secretary of the Science and Art Department, General Sir John Donnelly (who was also a Royal Engineer) to found their institution on the 87-acre (350,000 m2) site at South Kensington bought by the 1851 Exhibition Commissioners (for £342,500) for &#x27;purposes of art and science&#x27; in perpetuity.

The Central Technical College building was designed by Alfred Waterhouse, better known as the architect of the Natural History Museum. Located adjacent to the Central Institute on the site were the Royal School of Mines and the Royal College of Science.

In 1907, the latter two colleges were incorporated by royal charter into the Imperial College of Science and Technology, and the CGLI Central Technical College was renamed the City and Guilds College in 1907, but not incorporated into Imperial College until 1910.

Although the City and Guilds College was for much of its life governed through Imperial College, the City and Guilds Institute, together with a number of livery companies in their own right, maintained seats on the governing body (the Court) of Imperial College until its reorganisation in 2002. In 2002, under Imperial College&#x27;s new faculty structure, City and Guilds College, along with the other constituent colleges, ceased to exist as a separate entity. In September 2013 the Mechanical and Aeronautical engineering building at Imperial College was renamed City and Guilds Building to acknowledge the historical legacy. Its name also survives however in the City &amp; Guilds College Union (CGCU)—the student union for the Imperial College Faculty of Engineering and the Imperial College Business School—and in the City &amp; Guilds College Association (CGCA).

Alumni of the CGLI Central Technical College, the City and Guilds College, and the new Imperial College Faculty of Engineering, unite under the City &amp; Guilds College Association. Established in 1897 as the Old Centralians, the Association adopted its current name in 1992.

===CGLI examination and accreditation bodies===
In 1953 the Associated Examinations Board (AEB) was established and administered by City &amp; Guilds.

1964 saw the creation of the National Examining Board for Supervisory Management (NEBSM) as part of the City &amp; Guilds group, specialising in qualifications for supervisors and junior managers.

In 1973, the Technician Education Council (TEC) was created to unify technical education, eventually taking over the validation of courses in further and higher education. These courses led to Ordinary National Certificates and Diplomas (ONC/Ds) and Higher National Certificates and Diplomas (HNC/Ds), which were previously the responsibility of professional bodies. It also saw the introduction of the City &amp; Guilds Mnemonic Code for computer teaching.

In 1974, the Business Education Council (BEC) was established, again administered by City &amp; Guilds. This had the remit to rationalise and improve the relevance of sub-degree vocational education in Further Education and Higher Education colleges and in Polytechnics. Within 18 months, BEC took over responsibility for non-technical ONCs, ONDs, HNCs, HNDs, and other qualifications.

BEC merged with TEC in 1984 to form the separately administered Business &amp; Technology Education Council (BTEC). This then merged with the University of London Examinations &amp; Assessment Council (ULEAC) in 1996 to form Edexcel.

In 1990 City &amp; Guilds purchased the Pitman Examinations Institute, and Pitman Qualifications Single Subject awards in business and administration and English language proved to be successful worldwide.

In 2002, the Institute of Leadership &amp; Management (ILM) was formed through the merger of NEBSM and the Institute of Supervisory Management (ISM) and became part of the City &amp; Guilds Group.

In 2004, the National Proficiency Tests Council (NPTC) – specialists for agricultural land-based qualifications – became part of the City &amp; Guilds Group.

In 2005, the Hospitality Awarding Body (HAB) – specialists in awards for hospitality and catering – became part of the City &amp; Guilds Group. In January 2010, all active candidates were transferred to City &amp; Guilds courses to remove duplicate award provisions across the Group.

In 2008, the City &amp; Guilds Centre for Skills Development was formed as part of the City &amp; Guilds Group. Its mission is to influence and improve skills policy and practice worldwide through an evidence-based approach.

===Professional Engineering Qualifications===

City &amp; Guilds offers graduate (level 6) and postgraduate (level 7) diplomas in engineering. These have been designed in conjunction with professional engineering bodies to ensure that holders can apply for professional registration as an Incorporated Engineer (IEng) with the Graduate Diploma or Chartered Engineer (CEng) with the Postgraduate Diploma. Candidates for professional registration are considered individually through the normal assessment procedures of the relevant professional body for their specific discipline.

The graduate and post graduate diplomas are offered in five areas: civil engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, electronic and telecommunication engineering, and information technology. These qualifications can lead to professional registration (IEng or CEng as appropriate) through the following three discipline-specific professional engineering institutions:
*Civil Engineering – Institution of Civil Engineers
*Mechanical Engineering – Institution of Mechanical Engineers
*Electrical Engineering; Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering; Information Technology – Institution of Engineering and Technology

<doc id="339806" wikidata="Q217117" url="?curid=339806" title="Burlesque">
<text>A burlesque is a literary, dramatic or musical work intended to cause laughter by caricaturing the manner or spirit of serious works, or by ludicrous treatment of their subjects. The word is loaned from French and derives from the Italian &#x27;, which, in turn, is derived from the Italian&#x27; – a joke, ridicule or mockery.

Burlesque overlaps with caricature, parody and , and, in its theatrical form, with extravaganza, as presented during the Victorian era. The word &quot;burlesque&quot; has been used in English in this literary and theatrical sense since the late 17th century. It has been applied retrospectively to works of Chaucer and Shakespeare and to the Graeco-Roman classics. Contrasting examples of literary burlesque are Alexander Pope&#x27;s &quot;The Rape of the Lock&quot; and Samuel Butler&#x27;s &quot;Hudibras&quot;. An example of musical burlesque is Richard Strauss&#x27;s 1890 Burleske for piano and orchestra. Examples of theatrical burlesques include W. S. Gilbert&#x27;s &quot;Robert the Devil&quot; and the A. C. Torr – Meyer Lutz shows, including &quot;Ruy Blas and the Blasé Roué&quot;.

A later use of the term, particularly in the United States, refers to performances in a variety show format. These were popular from the 1860s to the 1940s, often in cabarets and clubs, as well as theatres, and featured bawdy comedy and female striptease. Some Hollywood films attempted to recreate the spirit of these performances from the 1930s to the 1960s, or included burlesque-style scenes within dramatic films, such as 1972&#x27;s &quot;Cabaret&quot; and 1979&#x27;s &quot;All That Jazz&quot;, among others. There has been a resurgence of interest in this format since the 1990s.

==Literary origins and development==

The word first appears in a title in Francesco Berni&#x27;s &quot;Opere burlesche&quot; of the early 16th century, works that had circulated widely in manuscript before they were printed. For a time, burlesque verses were known as &quot;poesie bernesca&quot; in his honour. &quot;Burlesque&quot; as a literary term became widespread in 17th century Italy and France, and subsequently England, where it referred to a grotesque imitation of the dignified or pathetic. Shakespeare&#x27;s Pyramus and Thisbe scene in &quot;Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; and the general mocking of romance in Beaumont and Fletcher&#x27;s &quot;The Knight of the Burning Pestle&quot; were early examples of such imitation.

In 17th century Spain, playwright and poet Miguel de Cervantes ridiculed medieval romance in his many satirical works. Among Cervantes&#x27; works are &quot;Exemplary Novels&quot; and the &quot;Eight Comedies and Eight New Interludes&quot; published in 1615. The term burlesque has been applied retrospectively to works of Chaucer and Shakespeare and to the Graeco-Roman classics.

Burlesque was intentionally ridiculous in that it imitated several styles and combined imitations of certain authors and artists with absurd descriptions. In this, the term was often used interchangeably with &quot;pastiche&quot;, &quot;parody&quot;, and the 17th and 18th century genre of the &quot;mock-heroic&quot;. Burlesque depended on the reader&#x27;s (or listener&#x27;s) knowledge of the subject to make its intended effect, and a high degree of literacy was taken for granted.

17th and 18th century burlesque was divided into two types: High burlesque refers to a burlesque imitation where a literary, elevated manner was applied to a commonplace or comically inappropriate subject matter as, for example, in the literary parody and the mock-heroic. One of the most commonly cited examples of high burlesque is Alexander Pope&#x27;s &quot;sly, knowing and courtly&quot; &quot;The Rape of the Lock&quot;. Low burlesque applied an irreverent, mocking style to a serious subject; an example is Samuel Butler&#x27;s poem &quot;Hudibras&quot;, which described the misadventures of a Puritan knight in satiric doggerel verse, using a colloquial idiom. Butler&#x27;s addition to his comic poem of an ethical subtext made his caricatures into satire.

In more recent times, burlesque true to its literary origins is still performed in revues and sketches. Tom Stoppard&#x27;s 1974 play &quot;Travesties&quot; is an example of a full-length play drawing on the burlesque tradition.

==In music==
===Classical music===
Beginning in the early 18th century, the term burlesque was used throughout Europe to describe musical works in which serious and comic elements were juxtaposed or combined to achieve a grotesque effect. As derived from literature and theatre, &quot;burlesque&quot; was used, and is still used, in music to indicate a bright or high-spirited mood, sometimes in contrast to seriousness.

In this sense of farce and exaggeration rather than parody, it appears frequently on the German-language stage between the middle of the 19th century and the 1920s. Burlesque operettas were written by Johann Strauss II (&quot;Die lustigen Weiber von Wien&quot;, 1868), Ziehrer (&quot;Mahomed&#x27;s Paradies&quot;, 1866; &quot;Das Orakel zu Delfi&quot;, 1872; &quot;Cleopatra, oder Durch drei Jahrtausende&quot;, 1875; &quot;In fünfzig Jahren&quot;, 1911) and Bruno Granichstaedten (&quot;Casimirs Himmelfahrt&quot;, 1911). French references to burlesque are less common than German, though Grétry composed for a &quot;drame burlesque&quot; (&quot;Matroco&quot;, 1777). Stravinsky called his 1916 one-act chamber opera-ballet &quot;Renard&quot; (&quot;The Fox&quot;) a &quot;Histoire burlesque chantée et jouée&quot; (&quot;burlesque tale sung and played&quot;) and his 1911 ballet &quot;Petrushka&quot; a &quot;burlesque in four scenes&quot;. A later example is the 1927 burlesque operetta by Ernst Krenek entitled &quot;Schwergewicht&quot; (&quot;Heavyweight&quot;) (1927).

Some orchestral and chamber works have also been designated as burlesques, of which two early examples are the Ouverture-Suite &quot;Burlesque de Quixotte&quot;, TWV 55, by Telemann and the Sinfonia Burlesca by Leopold Mozart (1760). Another often-performed piece is Richard Strauss&#x27;s 1890 Burleske for piano and orchestra. Other examples include the following:
*1901: Six Burlesques, Op. 58 for piano four hands by Max Reger
*1904: Scherzo Burlesque, Op. 2 for piano and orchestra by Béla Bartók
*1911: Three Burlesques, Op. 8c for piano by Bartók
*1920: Burlesque for Piano, by Arnold Bax
*1931: Ronde burlesque, Op. 78 for orchestra by Florent Schmitt
*1932: Fantaisie burlesque, for piano by Olivier Messiaen
*1956: Burlesque for Piano and Chamber Orchestra, Op. 13g by Bertold Hummel
*1982: Burlesque for Wind Quintet, Op. 76b by Hummel

Burlesque can be used to describe particular movements of instrumental musical compositions, often involving dance rhythms. Examples are the Burlesca, in Partita No. 3 for keyboard (BWV 827) by Bach, the &quot;Rondo-Burleske&quot; third movement of Symphony No. 9 by Mahler, and the &quot;Burlesque&quot; fourth movement of Shostakovich&#x27;s Violin Concerto No. 1.

===Jazz===
The use of burlesque has not been confined to classical music. Well-known ragtime travesties include &quot;Russian Rag&quot;, by George L. Cobb, which is based on Rachmaninoff&#x27;s Prelude in C-sharp minor, and Harry Alford&#x27;s &quot;Lucy&#x27;s Sextette&quot; based on the sextet, &#x27;Chi mi frena in tal momento?&#x27;, from &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; by Donizetti.

==Victorian theatrical burlesque==
Victorian burlesque, sometimes known as &quot;travesty&quot; or &quot;extravaganza&quot;, was popular in London theatres between the 1830s and the 1890s. It took the form of musical theatre parody in which a well-known opera, play or ballet was adapted into a broad comic play, usually a musical play, often risqué in style, mocking the theatrical and musical conventions and styles of the original work, and quoting or pastiching text or music from the original work. The comedy often stemmed from the incongruity and absurdity of the classical subjects, with realistic historical dress and settings, being juxtaposed with the modern activities portrayed by the actors. Madame Vestris produced burlesques at the Olympic Theatre beginning in 1831 with &quot;Olympic Revels&quot; by J. R. Planché. Other authors of burlesques included H. J. Byron, G. R. Sims, F. C. Burnand, W. S. Gilbert and Fred Leslie.

Victorian burlesque related to and in part derived from traditional English pantomime &quot;with the addition of gags and &#x27;turns&#x27;.&quot; In the early burlesques, following the example of ballad opera, the words of the songs were written to popular music; later burlesques mixed the music of opera, operetta, music hall and revue, and some of the more ambitious shows had original music composed for them. This English style of burlesque was successfully introduced to New York in the 1840s.

Some of the most frequent subjects for burlesque were the plays of Shakespeare and grand opera. The dialogue was generally written in rhyming couplets, liberally peppered with bad puns. A typical example from a burlesque of &quot;Macbeth&quot;: Macbeth and Banquo enter under an umbrella, and the witches greet them with &quot;Hail! hail! hail!&quot; Macbeth asks Banquo, &quot;What mean these salutations, noble thane?&quot; and is told, &quot;These showers of &#x27;Hail&#x27; anticipate your &#x27;reign. A staple of burlesque was the display of attractive women in travesty roles, dressed in tights to show off their legs, but the plays themselves were seldom more than modestly risqué.

Burlesque became the speciality of certain London theatres, including the Gaiety and Royal Strand Theatre from the 1860s to the early 1890s. Until the 1870s, burlesques were often one-act pieces running less than an hour and using pastiches and parodies of popular songs, opera arias and other music that the audience would readily recognize. The house stars included Nellie Farren, John D&#x27;Auban, Edward Terry and Fred Leslie. From about 1880, Victorian burlesques grew longer, until they were a whole evening&#x27;s entertainment rather than part of a double- or triple-bill. In the early 1890s, these burlesques went out of fashion in London, and the focus of the Gaiety and other burlesque theatres changed to the new more wholesome but less literary genre of Edwardian musical comedy.

==American burlesque==
American burlesque shows were originally an offshoot of Victorian burlesque. The English genre had been successfully staged in New York from the 1840s, and it was popularised by a visiting British burlesque troupe, Lydia Thompson and the &quot;British Blondes&quot;, beginning in 1868. New York burlesque shows soon incorporated elements and the structure of the popular minstrel shows. They consisted of three parts: first, songs and ribald comic sketches by low comedians; second, assorted olios and male acts, such as acrobats, magicians and solo singers; and third, chorus numbers and sometimes a burlesque in the English style on politics or a current play. The entertainment was usually concluded by an exotic dancer or a wrestling or boxing match.
The entertainments were given in clubs and cabarets, as well as music halls and theatres. By the early 20th century, there were two national circuits of burlesque shows competing with the vaudeville circuit, as well as resident companies in New York, such as Minsky&#x27;s at the Winter Garden. The transition from burlesque on the old lines to striptease was gradual. At first, soubrettes showed off their figures while singing and dancing; some were less active but compensated by appearing in elaborate stage costumes. The strippers gradually supplanted the singing and dancing soubrettes; by 1932 there were at least 150 strip principals in the US. Star strippers included Sally Rand, Gypsy Rose Lee, Tempest Storm, Lili St. Cyr, Blaze Starr, Ann Corio and Margie Hart, who was celebrated enough to be mentioned in song lyrics by Lorenz Hart and Cole Porter. By the late 1930s, burlesque shows would have up to six strippers supported by one or two comics and a master of ceremonies. Comics who appeared in burlesque early in their careers included Fanny Brice, Mae West, Eddie Cantor, Abbott and Costello, W. C. Fields, Jackie Gleason, Danny Thomas, Al Jolson, Bert Lahr, Phil Silvers, Sid Caesar, Danny Kaye, Red Skelton and Sophie Tucker.
The uninhibited atmosphere of burlesque establishments owed much to the free flow of alcoholic liquor, and the enforcement of Prohibition was a serious blow. In New York, Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia clamped down on burlesque, effectively putting it out of business by the early 1940s. It lingered on elsewhere in the US, increasingly neglected, and by the 1970s, with nudity commonplace in theatres, reached &quot;its final shabby demise.&quot; Both during its declining years and afterwards there have been films that sought to capture American burlesque, including &quot;Lady of Burlesque&quot; (1943), &quot;Striporama&quot; (1953), and &quot;The Night They Raided Minsky&#x27;s&quot; (1968).
In recent decades, there has been a revival of burlesque, sometimes called Neo-Burlesque, on both sides of the Atlantic. A new generation, nostalgic for the spectacle and perceived glamour of the classic American burlesque, developed a cult following for the art in the early 1990s at Billie Madley&#x27;s &quot;Cinema&quot; and later at the &quot;Dutch Weismann&#x27;s Follies&quot; revues in New York City, &quot;The Velvet Hammer&quot; troupe in Los Angeles and The Shim-Shamettes in New Orleans. Ivan Kane&#x27;s Royal Jelly Burlesque Nightclub at Revel Atlantic City opened in 2012. Notable Neo-burlesque performers include Dita Von Teese, and Julie Atlas Muz and Agitprop groups like Cabaret Red Light incorporated political satire and performance art into their burlesque shows. Annual conventions such as the Vancouver International Burlesque Festival and the Miss Exotic World Pageant are held.

<doc id="339810" wikidata="Q7701574" url="?curid=339810" title="Teranesia">
<text>Teranesia is a 1999 science fiction novel by Greg Egan. The novel follows protagonist Prabir Suresh, who lives on an island in the South Moluccas with his biologist parents, who are investigating the unique evolutionary traits of butterflies on the island. As civil war erupts in Indonesia, Prabir and his baby sister Madhusree must escape the islands. When they grow up, Madhusree becomes a biology student, motivated to carry on her parents&#x27; legacy in uncovering the evolutionary phenomenon. Prabir reluctantly follows her, as he must navigate and confront the truth that shaped his past.

The novel encircles notions of sexuality and free will. Where Egan is regarded as a hard science fiction author, Teranesia stands out as one of his few character driven novels. Egan&#x27;s personal interest in migration politics permeates through Teranesia, as he explores the migration experience of Prabir and Madhusree as they seek asylum in Canada. Teranesia received critical acclaim, as well as award nominations and wins. The novel won the 2000 Ditmar Award for Best Novel but Egan declined to accept the award.

==Plot==
9-year-old Prabir Suresh lives on a small tropical island among the South Moluccas where strange mutations generate unique plants, birds and creatures. His life revolves around the jungle, which he calls Teranesia; school; and friendships he makes on the internet. Prabir lives on the island with his baby sister, Madhusree and parents who are both research biologists, currently studying the evolution of a species of butterflies that strays from conventional evolution.

Civil war breaks out in Indonesia, with heated attacks against the Javanese empire. One day planes fly by and drop mines, some falling in Prabir&#x27;s family garden. While tending to the garden the next day, Prabir&#x27;s father is gravely injured by a mine. Prabir and his mother attempt to help pull his father out of the garden, but his mother loses her balance and Prabir witnesses them both die after falling on another mine. Shocked from the explosion and sudden death of his parents, Prabir escapes the island with his fifteen-month-old sister. As the civil war expands across the area, they scramble on a boat to the nearest inhabited island, where they are taken to Australia, and seek asylum with their aunt in Canada, far way away from Teranesia and their family&#x27;s homeland of India.

Prabir dedicates his life to parenting Madhusree over the next 20 years, while navigating his sexuality as a gay man and being separated from his homeland. He starts work at a bank and Madhusree grows to pursue biology, carrying the lineage of their parents&#x27; passion for evolutionary research. One day, reports emerge of an abnormal species of plants and animals that have mutated throughout the South Moluccas region that are going out of control, including on the island Prabir called Teranesia. Prabir recognises the similarity in these characteristics to the butterflies his parents were studying many years ago. Madhusree decides to go on a scientific expedition to explore these strange mutations. Prabir suffers anxiety and apprehension at the thought of revisiting the islands they grew up in. He tries desperately to convince Madhusree not to go, but this only motivates her more strongly. Prabir, left alone, broods about the meaninglessness of his life and attempts suicide. In the last minute, he decides to chase her to the islands instead, still distressed at the thought of her revisiting Teranesia.

Traveling to back to the islands, Prabir undergoes a traumatic realisation of his past. When Prabir was young, he exchanged messages with a professor in the United States, posing as his father. While trying to reassure her of the growing unrest, he made statements that made him sound like an insurgent. He assumes the messages were intercepted, and believes he&#x27;s the reason the militia plane flew to their home, ultimately causing his parents&#x27; deaths. In considering his past, Prabir realises his effort to prevent Madhusree from traveling to the islands was more to protect himself than her.

Now invigorated to uncover the mystery of the mutations, Prabir encounters Martha Grant, a biologist who is also studying them. Grant is working under a pharmaceutical company, which forbids her to publish her results. They strike a deal – Prabir will guide her to the island Teranesia if she promises to publish her results on the internet. Grant challenges Prabir, asking if he had ever tried to protect Madhusree for another reason than the fact she&#x27;s his sister. Prabir becomes agitated at the thought that his inclination to take care of Madhusree was genetically determined rather than a choice he made of his free will.

A research team identifies the gene causing the unusual mutations as the São Paulo protein. A physicist on the team suggests the protein uses quantum superposition to figure out which mutation is most beneficial to the organism. They realise this is how the mutations are propagating at such a rapid pace. 
Prabir gets scratched by mutant shrubs that are native to the island. After exploring his family&#x27;s former home, disgusted by his behaviour as a child, he proceeds to the mine-infested garden in a suicide attempt. Grant, having pretended to return to their boat but realizing something is off, uses multiple tranquilizer darts to stop Prabir and convince him that his parents&#x27; death wasn&#x27;t his fault. In a moment Prabir ends up regretting, he and Grant begin to kiss, but she rebuffs him when coming to her senses.

When they return to the island where Madhusree&#x27;a expedition is camping, Grant and Prabir encounter Christian militia, who end up testing him for the mutant gene, only to find that he carries the São Paulo protein in his bloodstream. The militia commander starts interrogating Prabir, asking if he had raped Grant. Prabir, being gay, realises his uncharacteristic sexual urges towards Grant were probably due to the high libido associated with the protein. Upon reflection of his behaviour and the speed of propagation of the protein, he discerns the protein must have some consciousness in how to breed most successfully.

The militia group immediately s Prabir on an offshore boat, only for him to be rescued by Madhusree, who keeps him in an isolation raft. She continuously monitors his condition as they hurry to the nearest hospital, while Prabir&#x27;s physicality changes in extreme ways. He starts to grow a rigid carapace rendering him immobile. Prabir senses the gene has enabled him to undergo an intense metamorphosis. In the havoc of this change, he realises the gene is going seize all elements of human consciousness - love, intelligence, honesty and reflection. The gene&#x27;s sole aim is to procreate above everything else, stripping him of his sentience and agency.

He tells Madhusree to tranquilize and burn him, in an attempt to end his life before he is taken over and stop the spread of the São Paulo protein. She is unable to knock him out due to the protein adapting to the tranquilizing agent. Madhusree has an epiphany and realizes the protein is somehow sentient and is reacting to their attempts to destroy or stop it. She extracts a sample from Prabir&#x27;s last remaining spot of human flesh, and makes a promise to give it a new host to propagate in. Prabir rapidly returns to normal, and promises to take Madhusree to a festival in Calcutta, where their parents tested the limits of the human body before they were born.

==Background==
Teranesia is a product of Egan&#x27;s interest in quantum mechanics, Indonesian civil politics during the 1990s and rationalism. Karen Burnham, an engineer and science fiction literary critic, stated how Egan&#x27;s novels dive into scientific and socio-political discourse in an &quot;elegant&quot; way to contribute to these conversations. Burnham wrote a book dedicated to Greg Egan&#x27;s hard science fiction craft and artistic agenda, with an exclusive interview with notoriously private Egan.

Greg Egan received a Bachelors of Science degree in mathematics from University of Western Australia. In Teranesia, American literary critic N. Katherine Hayles analyses how Egan conceptualised how quantum mechanics can intersect with consciousness in Teranesia, a reflection of his studies into mathematical theories. Egan dives into the foundations of quantum mechanics in a series called &#x27;Foundations&#x27;, where he explains modern physics concepts for fans who yearn to understand the scientific theory in his fictions. 
Egan has been vocal about his disdain in Australia&#x27;s treatment of refugees and asylum seekers. In the Afterword for Teranesia, Egan remarks the austere conditions of Australia&#x27;s detention centres and the 2001 Tampa Affair which roused Australia&#x27;s border protection policy. He concludes he feels a &quot;melancholic duty to report&quot; these &quot;atrocities&quot;. Egan dedicated himself to the refugee support movement, visiting refugees who had been detained and welcoming his home to those released from detention centres seeking a new life in Australia. This highlights Egan&#x27;s field of research and inspiration when building the landscape of Teranesia. The refugee experience and impacts of migration can be seen in an array of his novels such as Distress (1995), Zendegi (2010) and Teranesia (1999), where Prabhir and Madhursee seek asylum in Canada. Steven Shaviro, an American philosopher and cultural critic states how Teranesia explores ramifications of inter-ethnic and religious conflict in Indonesia through migration.
In the acknowledgements of Teranesia, Egan shows appreciation toward The Malay Archipelago (1869) by Alfred Russel Wallace, a journal of scientific exploration around the Dutch East Indies, also known as Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia. He also mentions &#x27;The Spice Islands Voyage&#x27; by Tim Severin which recounts Severin&#x27;s expedition of where Wallace had initially explored 140 years later. This inspired Egan&#x27;s take on the ecology of the islands of the South Mollacus in the novel. Egan references documentary &quot;Guru Busters&quot;, directed and produced by Robert Eagle, which follows members of the Indian Rationalist Association journey in debunking those who claim supernatural powers.

==Themes==
This novel involves intersecting commentary on sexuality and gender, biological evolution, consciousness and rationality.

===Sexuality===
In numerous interviews leading up to the publication of Teranesia, Egan states that a central theme of Teranesia is biological evolution and &quot;sexuality&quot;. Christopher Palmer, a fiction author with expertise in science fiction dissects Egan&#x27;s take on dismantling gender stereotypes in Teranesia. Kate Burnham shares this perspective of Egan, stating how he is a pioneer in &quot;shaping social pressures&quot; placed on women in fields of science, as well as the science fiction genre. Palmer highlights a pattern of Prabir being saved by women through the story - female scientist saves him from a python, Grant prevents him from suicide, Madhusree rescues him from Christian militia and treats him as gene overrides the physicality of his body.

Burnham calls attention to Egan&#x27;s satirical take on postmodern intellectual fads that rose in the 1990s. In Teranesia, Prabir&#x27;s aunt makes a comment on how computers are reinforcing the patriarchy due to the sexist nature of ones and zeros which are the foundation of binary numbers. Burnham deciphers this as a satirical comment from Egan as his way of demonstrating how claiming the &quot;practice of science&quot; has been hostile to women is different to how &quot;science itself&quot; is inherently patriarchal.

===Free Will and Consciousness===
In an article in The New York Review of Science Fiction, Kate Burnham comments on Egan&#x27;s affinity to explore free will, but &quot;not without its limits&quot;. Palmer supports this idea, voicing how in Teranesia, Egan has a clear inclination to tell stories regarding rationalism and self-willed decision making. He continues to state as Teranesia is one of Egan&#x27;s character-driven novels, emphasis on Prabir&#x27;s self-determinism and rational thought roots from his father&#x27;s involvement with the Indian Rationalist Association. In an exclusive interview between Burnham and Egan, Egan extends the rationalist mindset to religion. He proclaims its &quot;absurd&quot; to abstain from asking the logical implications of religious claims to the existence of an &quot;afterlife&quot; or &quot;immaterial soul&quot;.

In N. Katherine Hayles&#x27; journal article surrounding the notions of cognitive consciousness in Teranesia, she transcends this state of mind to a perpetuating motif in the novel. Hayles analyses the climax of the novel - when biologist Grant finds that the gene is propagating through quantum superposition to find which quantum state will reproduce most successfully. She offers these moments to draw parallels on the consciousness of a non-conscious gene, to offer a &quot;millennial reassessment&quot; of what consciousness means with the intersection of technology and biology. Burnham notes Egan&#x27;s fascination across novels of bioethical complications that will become pertinent with the rise of technology.

==Reception==
Teranesia has received polarising reviews on Greg Egan&#x27;s style and narrative arc. Egan has received a positive reception regarding his integration of scientific concepts through his narratives. Egan is regarded as a &quot;hard science fiction pioneer&quot;, integrating complex scientific or mathematic notions in his narratives. Simon Petrie, a recognised science fiction writer and judge of the Aurealis Awards, comments on how &#x27;Teranesia&#x27; is unique amongst the rest of Egan&#x27;s novels being more character driven than science driven.

Greg L Johnson, a writer for the New York Review of Science Fiction, and Petrie both state the real strength of Egan&#x27;s Teranesia is in the character development, notably the protagonist Prabir, where responders are more concerned with Prabir&#x27;s emotional crisis than the scientific discoveries. Johnson critiques the pace of the narrative, expressing the last chapters were too rushed in comparison to the rest of the novel.

Science fiction writer and academic Jon Courtenay Grimwood shares the notion of Egan&#x27;s contribution to science fiction, stating that in &#x27;Teranesia&#x27; Egan can make the &quot;passion of science appear understandable to non-scientists&quot;. Grimwood then critiques how Egan doesn&#x27;t fully explore pertinent themes in the narrative such as religion, political strife and Indonesian imperialism in detail, leaving fallacies when constructing motivations for the protagonist Prabir.

Some academic critics praise Egan&#x27;s study into human sentience and consciousness. N. Katherine Hayles, whose specialty lies in the literary intersection of technology and science, claims that Egan&#x27;s novels, including &#x27;Teranesia&#x27; offers a &quot;millennial reassessment&quot; to the concepts of consciousness. Literary and science fiction expert and author Christopher Palmer asserts how Egan intertwines biological concepts of evolution to exemplify human flaws such as misjudgements and impulse.

==Awards==
Teranesia&#x27;s critical acclaim was supported by multiple award nominations and wins. Teranesia was nominated for the 2000 Ditmar Award of Best Novel of the Year, but declined the award. Based on an email Greg Egan had sent to the Dimtar Award Subcommittee, Egan rejected the award based on the &quot;lack of permanent rules governing the Ditmar Awards from year to year&quot;. In 1996, Egan had requested his work no longer be considered for Ditmar Awards.

<text>Roosevelt Bernard &quot;Rosie&quot; Douglas (15 October 1941 – 1 October 2000) was a politician and human rights activist from Dominica. He served as Prime Minister of Dominica from February 2000 until his death in office eight months later.

==Early life==
Rosie Douglas was the son of the late Robert Bernard Douglas, a wealthy businessman, coconut farmer, and conservative politician who named his boys after world statesmen (he had brothers named Eisenhower, Attlee, and Adenauer).
He was schooled in Dominica&#x27;s capital, Roseau, before being accepted to study agriculture at the Ontario Agricultural College.

==In Canada==
===University===
After growing frustrated with the bureaucratic delays in obtaining his visa to enter Canada, he made a phone call to then Canadian Prime Minister, John Diefenbaker. Mr. Diefenbaker was able to assist Douglas, aged 18 at the time, and sent local MP Bruce Robinson to collect him at the airport. Douglas became involved in politics as a member of the young Conservative Party of Canada, under the guidance of the right honourable John Diefenbaker. Upon completing his studies in agriculture, he moved to Montreal where he enrolled in political science at Sir George Williams University.

===Student politics===
While attending Sir George Williams, Douglas, who worked as a teachers assistant in the Political Science Department, became President of the Conservative Student Union becoming friends with Canadian political leaders including Pierre Trudeau and René Lévesque. Douglas used his platform within the Tory Party to advocate on behalf of Caribbean women who came to Canada under the domestic scheme, better housing conditions for blacks living in substandard conditions, particularly in North Preston, Nova Scotia, equal employment opportunities for blacks in Canada, and addressing racism in Canada as part of the Tories&#x27; national platform. However, Douglas left the conservatives when national student leader Joe Clark refused to address the issue of racism on a national level. His political views also changed radically when he went to live on Indian reserves in Quebec, and visited Nova Scotia&#x27;s black communities in the 1960s. The impoverished conditions of black people there affected him to the point he decided &quot;there and then&quot; that he would devote his life to improving the lot of black people around the world. By the late 1960s, after hearing Martin Luther King Jr. speak at the Massey Lectures at the University of Toronto, Douglas had become an active supporter of the civil rights movement taking place in the United States, befriending the likes of King and Stokely Carmichael.

Douglas, along with community leaders like Vincentian cricketer and political activist Alphonso Theodore Roberts, Nova Scotian human rights activist Rocky Jones, and Antiguan political activist Tim Hector, organized The Montreal Congress of Black Writers. This group featured renowned black economists, scholars, and activists from around the world, including Guyanese Pan-Africanist Walter Rodney, Trinidadian Marxist C. L. R. James, American civil rights leader Angela Davis, and Black Panther Party leader Bobby Seale.

===Sir George Williams affair and imprisonment===
When black students began to protest racism at Sir George Williams University, Douglas had by then had moved on to his master&#x27;s program at McGill University. Meanwhile, he had developed strong leadership credentials in the Tory party, served as president of the Association of British West Indian Students, and was serving as Vice President of the Verdun Cricket Club. He emerged as the media-savvy leader of what has come to be known as the Sir George Williams affair of 1969. He, along with future Canadian Senator Anne Cools and others led an anti-racism sit-in at Sir George Williams University, Montreal, which resulted in the peaceful occupation of the computer centre as negotiations took place between the administration and the student leadership. However, once an agreement was reached, the riot police infiltrated the occupation, escalating the matter into a violent conflict and fire, resulting in mayhem and destruction of the computer centre. Douglas, who was not present at the time of the conflict, maintained that the fire was set by agent provocateurs, but was identified as the ring leader and charged with mischief. He served 18 months in prison before being deported in hand cuffs and leg irons, vowing that he would only return as &quot;Prime Minister of my own country&quot;.

While in prison, Douglas wrote an extensive report on prison reform in Canada, set up literacy classes for prisoners, and wrote the book &quot;Chains or Change&quot;. According to Douglas, &quot;I learned a lot about injustices in Canadian society when I went to jail...The truth is that I didn&#x27;t become committed to the fight for equality in Dominica. I became committed to the movement in Canada.&quot; Upon his release from prison Douglas, who had embarked on a cross Canada black unity tour building solidarity with native Canadians, was placed under RCMP surveillance as revealed by the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Certain Activities of the RCMP and in 1976 the Solicitor General Warren Allmand signed an order declaring Douglas a dangerous risk to Canada&#x27;s national security, forcing his deportation.

==Return to Dominica and international activities==
After his deportation, Douglas pursued a broad range of political activity on the world stage getting involved with the Socialist International, building relations with Cuba, The People&#x27;s Republic of China, and the Soviet Union securing hundreds of scholarships for Dominican students. Through his Dominica/China Friendship Association, Douglas led Dominica&#x27;s first diplomatic mission to China in 1984 along with then Portsmouth mayor Renwick Jean Pierre securing a commitment from the Chinese Government of US$1 million for projects for the town of Portsmouth. In a press statement in 1984 Douglas wrote: &quot;Attempts to build relations exclusively with Taiwan as is the case with the Government of the Commonwealth of Dominica is shortsighted, reactionary, and not in keeping with current political and economic relations on the world&quot;.

Douglas also became the Executive Chairman of the Libyan-based World Mathaba, a group that trained and advised guerrilla resistance movements worldwide. In this capacity he persuaded Colonel Gaddafi to begin negotiations with the British for the trial of suspects in the Lockerbie bombing, and supported anti-apartheid movements such as the African National Congress (ANC), which provided critical support to the toppling of apartheid and the freeing of Nelson Mandela. In Douglas&#x27;s view, there was nothing extremist about his activities, centred as they were on defeating despots and freeing Nelson Mandela, who was steadfastly supported by the Gaddafi regime. “All Dominicans supported the freedom of Mandela,” he says. “And the freedom of Mandela wasn&#x27;t a cakewalk on a Sunday morning - it was a revolutionary struggle in which people fought, died, and killed.” Douglas, in his capacity as Executive Chairman of the World Mathaba, was also part of a negotiating team seeking an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait to avert the Gulf War. Speaking at the anti-sanctions forum in New York on 20 January 1996, Douglas stated: &quot;I visited Iraq in 1990. In fact, left Baghdad two days before the war really began, on probably the last flight out. They had first imposed sanctions in August 1990. So even at that time, children were already dying because of a lack of medicines. I visited hospitals and saw it. And that was six months into the sanctions and before the war actually began. So you can imagine how after five years, with a tightening of those sanctions, the children of Iraq are suffering. All children have a right to a decent life, all children have the right to benefit from the fruits and resources of their country. What is good for the children of America is also good for the children of Iraq, Iran, Cuba, Vietnam, China all over the world.&quot;

==National politics==
Back at home, in his native Dominica, Douglas launched the Popular independence Committee which agitated for full political independence from Great Britain, helping to pave the way for Dominica to become an independent nation in 1978. After serving as a senator in the post-independence government, Douglas won the election for his Paix Bouche constituency, becoming an MP in 1985. He served as the International Secretary of the Dominica Labour Party, eventually becoming leader in 1992 after the death of his brother Michael Douglas.

===Prime minister===
During his political career, Douglas appealed to the cause of socialist radical reformers. At the parliamentary elections on 31 January 2000, he led the DLP to victory against the governing United Workers&#x27; Party of Prime Minister Edison James. He formed a coalition with the moderate Dominica Freedom Party and began office on 3 February 2000.

True to his promise, in May 2000 Douglas returned to Canada on an official state visit as the Prime Minister of Dominica, holding bilateral talks with his Canadian counterparts. He was quoted in the Canadian press at the time as stating: &quot;Yes, I feel the sacrifice was worth it,&quot; referring to his time in jail and deportation from Canada: &quot;I feel exonerated.&quot;

As Prime Minister Douglas set out on an ambitious agenda of establishing transforming Dominica into a high-income economy. He signed a US$300 million MOU with the Chinese for the building of an international airport, sought to establish a special relationship with the European Union with Dominica being sandwiched between two Departments of France, built stronger ties with the British Labour Party of Tony Blair the French Socialist Party of Lionel Jospin, the German Social Democratic Party of Gerhard Schroder and other social democratic parties in Scandinavia, Italy and Portugal. Douglas also sought increased development spending from Canada, Swedish assistance in transforming Dominica into an information technology centre, foreign direct investment in eco-tourism and medical tourism, and increased economic cooperation with Africa. He appealed directly to African Americans to invest in Dominica, and for the Congressional Black Caucus to lobby for the Caribbean in Washington in same way American Jews did for Israel.

After only eight months in office, Douglas was found dead on 1 October 2000 in his house in Portsmouth. He had returned the day before from state visits to Australia, Taiwan, Canada and Libya for the reconvening for the World Mathaba. Among the leaders addressing the conference in Tripoli in addition to Douglas were President of Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe, Burkina Faso President Blaise Compaore, Namibia President Sam Nujoma, Chad President Idriss Deby, Mali President Alpha Oumar Konaré, Gambia President Yahya Jammeh, Senegal President Abdoulaye Wade, Nation of Islam Leader Louis Farrakhan, leader of the Sandinistian Liberation Front Daniel Ortega, and Colonel Muammar Gaddafi. Douglas, as the only Caribbean Mathaba leader, sought greater connections between Caribbean, African, and African-American groups to confront global political and economic challenges.

Pierre Charles was named as his successor, but died in office in January 2004, paving the way for Roosevelt Skerrit to assume the position as Prime Minister of Dominica.

<doc id="339814" wikidata="Q78759878" url="?curid=339814" title="Coat of arms and flag of New Jersey">
<text>The coat of arms of the state of New Jersey includes:
*A shield with three plows, representative of New Jersey&#x27;s agricultural tradition.
*A forward-facing helmet.
*A horse&#x27;s head as the crest of the helmet.
*The female figures Liberty and Ceres, representative of the state&#x27;s motto (see next item). Liberty is holding a staff supporting a stylized Phrygian cap; Ceres is holding an overflowing cornucopia.
*The streamer at the foot of the emblem contains the State Motto of New Jersey, &quot;Liberty and Prosperity&quot;, and the year of statehood, 1776.

It was originally designed by Pierre Eugene du Simitiere in 1777 and was modified slightly in 1928.

The seal is the central motif in the flag of New Jersey and the great seal of the state of New Jersey.

The coat of arms contains a horse&#x27;s head; beneath that is a helmet, showing that New Jersey governs itself, and it has three plows on a shield to highlight the state&#x27;s agriculture tradition, which shows why the state has the nickname “Garden State.” The two Goddesses represent the state motto, “Liberty and Prosperity.” Liberty is on the left. She is holding a staff with a liberty cap on it, and the word “LIBERTY” is underneath her. The goddess on the right is Ceres, goddess of agriculture. She is holding a cornucopia with the word “PROSPERITY” written below her.

According to the minutes of the New Jersey General Assembly for May 11, 1896, the date on which the Assembly officially approved the flag as the state emblem, the buff color is due indirectly to George Washington, who had ordered on September 14, 1779, that the uniform coats of the New Jersey Continental Line be dark (Jersey) blue, with buff facings. Buff-colored facings had until then been reserved only for his own uniform and those of other Continental generals and their aides. Then, on February 14, 1780, the Continental War Officers in Philadelphia directed that the uniform coat facings of all regiments were to be the same as the background color of the regiments&#x27; state flag.

The seal is described in New Jersey statute Title 52, §2-1:

In 2015 a circular letter issued by the State of New Jersey Department of the Treasury addressed the issue of unapproved and incorrect versions of &quot;The Great Seal of the State of New Jersey&quot;. Many incorrectly show the underskirt in blue and not argent.
NJ Advance Media and NJ.com ran a contest in 2016 to create a new flag for New Jersey. A winning design by Andrew Maris of Fair Haven was chosen, but no legislative action has been taken to authorize a new flag.

==Flag==

The flag of the state of New Jersey includes the coat of arms of the state on a buff-colored background. In a 1965 law, the specific color shades of Jersey blue and buff were defined by the state. Using the Cable color system developed by the Color Association of the United States, Jersey Blue was defined as Cable No. 70087; Buff was defined as Cable No. 65015. The Office of the Secretary of State of New Jersey gives the blue and buff color hexadecimal equivalents as #2484C6 and #E1B584, respectively.

<doc id="339815" wikidata="Q1293269" url="?curid=339815" title="Pierre Charles (Dominican politician)">
<text>Pierre Charles (30 June 1954 – 6 January 2004) was a Dominican politician who served as Prime Minister of Dominica from 2000 to his death in 2004. At the time of his death, he was also serving as Member of Parliament for Grand Bay since 1985.

==Biography==
Charles was born in Grand Bay in Saint Patrick parish. He began his high-school education at the Dominica Grammar School and completed it at the St. Mary&#x27;s Academy before pursuing studies at the local teachers&#x27; college. He served as a teacher and community organizer before entering elective office.

He became ill in February 2003, and had angioplasty surgery. Concerns about his health led to calls for him to step down. However, he continued to serve as prime minister until his death, which occurred during a medical leave of absence. Osborne Riviere acted as Prime Minister in Charles&#x27; stead. However, upon return from his medical leave of absence, Charles succumbed at the age of 49 to a heart attack while being driven home from a Cabinet meeting.

==Political ascendancy==

In 1979, at the age of 25, Charles was appointed a Senator in Dominica’s Parliament. In the general elections of 1985, he contested the Grand Bay seat, and won, though his Dominica Labour Party (DLP) – led by Rosie Douglas’s brother Michael Douglas – lost to the incumbent Dominica Freedom Party (DFP) under the leadership of the formidable Dame Eugenia Charles (no relation), Dominica&#x27;s longest serving head of government at the time. For the next 15 years, Pierre Charles remained in that position, as irremovable from Grand Bay as Rosie Douglas was from Portsmouth.

When the DLP (in coalition with the DFP) came to power in 2000 under the leadership of Rosie Douglas, Charles was appointed Minister of Public Works and Communications. During the eight months of Douglas’s rule, Charles was often called upon to function as the acting Prime Minister. When Douglas suddenly died in October 2000, Charles was elevated as Douglas’s successor. He continued in office until his sudden death in January 2004.

Charles was an Honorary Member of The International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation.

<text>Nicholas Joseph Orville Liverpool (9 September 1934 – 1 June 2015) was a politician and jurist from Dominica who served as the sixth President of Dominica from 2 October 2003 to 17 September 2012.

== Biography ==
In 1957, Liverpool entered the University of Hull and obtained an LL.B (Hons.) degree in 1960. He was called to the bar at Inner Temple in 1961. He received a Ph.D degree from University of Sheffield in 1965. After returning to the Caribbean, he spent 18 years as a law lecturer at the University of the West Indies in Barbados and in 1992 became dean of its law school. He served as a regional judge and then an appeal court judge in several countries in the Caribbean including Belize and Grenada. He also served as a high court judge in Antigua and Montserrat and served on a number of tribunals and commissions for legal reform. In 2002 he was chairman of the constitutional review commission for Grenada. The University of Hull awarded him a degree of Doctor of Laws in July 2011.

Liverpool became Ambassador to the United States in March 1998, serving in that capacity until 2001.
In the same year as elected president, Liverpool was awarded the Dominica Award of Honour. Between 2002 and 2003 he also served as a Member of the UNESCO governing board. In July 2008 he agreed to serve a second term as president upon the expiration of his first term, following a joint nomination by Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit and Opposition Leader Earl Williams.

Nicholas Liverpool died on 1 June 2015 in Miami, Florida, where he was receiving medical treatment. He was 80 years old.

<doc id="339817" wikidata="Q56513" url="?curid=339817" title="Wichita language">
<text>Wichita is a Caddoan language spoken in Anadarko, Oklahoma by the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes. The last fluent heritage speaker, Doris Lamar-McLemore, died in 2016, although in 2007 there were three first-language speakers alive. This has rendered Wichita functionally extinct; however, the tribe offers classes to revitalize the language and works in partnership with the Wichita Documentation Project of the University of Colorado, Boulder.

==Dialects==
When the Europeans began to settle North America, Wichita separated into three dialects; Waco, Tawakoni, and Kirikirʔi꞉s (aka, Wichita Proper). However, when the language was threatened and the number of speakers decreased, dialect differences largely disappeared.

==Status==
As late as 2007 there were three living native speakers, but the last known fluent native speaker, Doris Lamar-McLemore, died on 30 August 2016. This is a sharp decline from the 500 speakers estimated by Paul L. Garvin in 1950.

==Classification==
Wichita is a member of the Caddoan language family, along with modern Caddo, Pawnee, Arikara, and Kitsai.

==Phonology==
The phonology of Wichita is unusual, with no pure labial consonants (though there are two labiovelars /kʷ/ and /w/). There is only one nasal (depending on conflicting theory one or more nasal sounds may appear, but all theories seem to agree that they are allophones of the same phoneme, at best), and possibly a three vowel system using only height for contrast.

===Consonants===

Wichita has 10 consonants. In the Americanist orthography generally used when describing Wichita, is spelled , and is .

Though neither Rood nor Garvin include nasals in their respective consonant charts for Wichita, Rood&#x27;s later inclusion of nasals in phonetic transcription for his 2008 paper (&quot;Some Wichita Recollections: Aspects of Culture Reflected in Language&quot;) support the appearance of at least .
* Labials are generally absent, occurring in only two roots: kammac &quot;to grind corn&quot; and camma:ci &quot;to hoe, to cultivate&quot; (⟨c⟩ = ).
* Apart from the in these two verbs, nasals are allophonic. The allophones and are in complementary distribution: It is before alveolars ( and in geminate ) and initially before a vowel, and elsewhere. Thus its initial consonant clusters are and , and its medial &amp; final clusters are .
* Final &quot;r&quot; and &quot;w&quot; are voiceless: 
* Glottalized final consonants: One aspect of Wichita phonetics is the occurrence of glottalized final consonants. Taylor asserts that when a long vowel precedes a glottal stop (ʔ), there is no change to the pronunciation. However, when the glottal stop is preceded by a short vowel, the vowel is eliminated. If the short vowel was preceded by a consonant, then the consonant is glottalized. Taylor hypothesizes that these glottalized final consonants show that the consonant was not originally a final consonant, that the proto form (an earlier language from which Wichita split off, that Taylor was aiming to reconstruct in his paper) ended in a glottal stop, and that a vowel has been lost between the consonant and glottal stop.

: - long vowel
: V - short vowel
: C - consonant
: # - preceding sound ends word
* Taylor also finds that previous phonetic transcriptions have recorded the phoneme (aka ), as occurring after , while is recorded when preceded by .
* The merger; or Why Wichita Has No :
** In Wichita the sounds and are not differentiated when they begin a word, and word-initial *p has become . This is unusual, in that the majority of Caddoan languages pronounce words that used to begin with *w with . In Wichita, the three sounds were also merged when preceded by a consonant. Wichita shifted consonant initial *p to with other medial occurrences of *p. and remain distinct following a vowel. For example, the word for &#x27;man&#x27; is in Wichita, but in South Band Pawnee and in Skiri Pawnee.

===Phonological rules===
* The coalescence of morpheme-final and subsequent morpheme-initial or to :

* changes to whenever it follows a consonantal segment which is not or :
* changes to before or . The most numerous examples involve the collective-plural prefix &quot;r-&quot; before a morpheme beginning with :

* with a following or to give :

* changes to before or any non-vowel:

* changes to before :

* , , and change to after or :
===Vowels===

Wichita has either three or four vowels, depending on analysis:

These are transcribed as .

Word-final vowels are devoiced.

Though Rood employs the letter in his transcriptions, Garvin instead uses , and asserts that is a separate phoneme. However, considering the imprecision in vowel sound articulation, what is likely important about these transcriptions is that they attest to a back vowel that is not low.

Taylor uses Garvin&#x27;s transcription in his analysis, but theorizes a shift of *u to medially in Wichita, but does not have enough examples to fully analyze all the possible environments. He also discusses a potential shift from *a to , but again, does not have enough examples to develop a definitive hypothesis. Taylor finds only occurs with intervocalic glottal stops.

Rood argues that is not phonemic, as it is often equivalent to any vowel + + any vowel. For example, is frequently contracted to (the high tone is an effect of the elided consonant). There are &quot;relatively&quot; few cases where speakers will not accept a substitution of vowel + + vowel for ; one of them is &#x27;eagle&#x27;.

Rood also proposes that, with three vowels that are arguably high, mid, and low, the front-back distinction is not phonemic, and that one may therefore speak of a &#x27;vertical&#x27; vowel inventory (see below). This also has been claimed for relatively few languages, such as the Northwest Caucasian languages and the Ndu languages of Papua New Guinea.

There is clearly at least a two-way contrast in vowel length. Rood proposes that there is a three-way contrast, which is quite rare among the world&#x27;s languages, although well attested for Mixe, and probably present in Estonian. However, in Wichita, for each of the three to four vowels qualities, one of the three lengths is rare, and in addition the extra-long vowels frequently involve either an extra morpheme, or suggest that prosody may be at work. For example,

:: &#x27;the strong one&#x27;
:: &#x27;the strong ones&#x27;

:: &#x27;let him find you&#x27;
:: &#x27;let him find it for you&#x27;

:: &#x27;there&#x27;
:: &#x27;here it is&#x27; (said when handing something over)
:: &#x27;that one&#x27;

(Note that it is common in many languages to use prosodic lengthening with demonstratives such as &#x27;there&#x27; or &#x27;that&#x27;.)

This contrasts with Mixe, where it is easy to find a three-way length contrast without the addition of morphemes.

Under Rood&#x27;s analysis, then, Wichita has 9 phonemic vowels:

===Tone===

There is also a contrastive high tone, indicated here by an acute accent.

===Syllable and phonotactics===

While vowel clusters are uncommon (unless the extra-long vowels are clusters), consonant clusters are ubiquitous in Wichita. Words may begin with clusters such as () and (). The longest cluster noted in Wichita is five consonants long, counting as a single consonant : &#x27;while sleeping&#x27;. However, Wichita syllables are more commonly CV or CVC.

==Grammar and morphology==

Wichita is an agglutinative, polysynthetic language, meaning words have a root verb basis to which information is added; that is, morphemes (affixes) are added to verb roots. These words may contain subjects, objects, indirect objects, and possibly indicate possession. Thus, surprisingly complex ideas can be communicated with as little as one word. For example, means &quot;one makes himself a fire&quot;.

Nouns do not distinguish between singular and plural, as this information is specified as part of the verb. Wichita also does not distinguish between genders, which can be problematic for English language translation.

Sentence structure is much more fluid than in English, with words being organized according to importance or novelty. Often the subject of the sentence is placed initially. Linguist David S. Rood, who has written many papers concerning the Wichita language, recorded this example, as spoken by Bertha Provost (a native speaker, now deceased) in the late 1960s.

The subject of the sentence is ancestors, and thus the sentence begins with it, instead of God, or creation (when.he.made.us.dwell). This leads one to conclude Wichita has a largely free word-order, where parts of the sentence do not need to be located next to each other to be related.

The perfective tense demonstrates that an act has been completed; on the other hand, the intentive tense indicates that a subject plans or planned to carry out a certain act. The habitual aspect indicates a habitual activity, for example: &quot;he smokes&quot; but not &quot;he is smoking.&quot; Durative tense describes an activity, which is coextensive with something else.

Wichita has no indirect speech or passive voice. When using past tense, speakers must indicate if this knowledge of the past is based in hearsay or personal knowledge. Wichita speakers also use a morpheme which amounts to two versions of &quot;we&quot;; one that includes the listener, and one that does not. Wichita also differentiates between singular, dual and plural number, instead of the simpler singular or plural designations commonly found.

===Affixes===
Some Wichita affixes are:

:
:imperfective.future.quotative
:&#x27;I heard she&#x27;ll be cooking it.&#x27;

===Instrumental suffixes===

The suffix is Rá:hir, added to the base. Another means of expressing instrument, used only for body parts, is a characteristic position of incorporation in the verb complex.
# ha:rhiwi:cá:hir &#x27;using a bowl&#x27; (ha:rhiwi:c &#x27;bowl&#x27;)
# ika:rá:hir &#x27;with a rock&#x27; (ika:ʔa &#x27;rock&#x27;)
# kirikirʔi:sá:hir &#x27;in Wichita (the language)&#x27; (kirikirʔi:s &#x27;Wichita)
# iskiʔo:rʔeh &#x27;hold me in your arms&#x27; (iskiʔ &#x27;imperative 2nd subject, 1st object&#x27;; a &#x27;reflexive possessor&#x27;; ʔawir &#x27;arm&#x27;; ʔahi &#x27;hold&#x27;).
# keʔese:cʔíriyari &#x27;you will shake your head&#x27; (keʔes &#x27;future 2nd subject&#x27;; a &#x27;reflexive possessor&#x27;; ic &#x27;face&#x27;; ʔiriyari &#x27;go around&#x27;. Literally: &#x27;you will go around, using your face&#x27;).

===Tense and aspect===
One of these tense-aspect prefixes must occur in any complete verb form.

Note: kara (ought), alone, always means &#x27;subject should&#x27;, but in complex constructions it is used for hypothetical action, as in &#x27;what would you do if...&#x27;)

The aspect-marking suffixes are:
Other prefixes and suffixes are as follows:
* The exclamatory inflection indicates excitement. 
* The imperative is used as the command form.
* The directive inflection is used in giving directions in sequences, such as describing how one makes something.
** This occurs only with 2nd or 3rd person subject pronouns and only in the singular.
* The optative is usually translated &#x27;I wish&#x27; or &#x27;subject should&#x27;.
* Although ought seems to imply that the action is the duty of the subject, it is frequently used for hypothetical statements in complex constructions.
* The unit durative suggests that the beginning and ending of the event are unimportant, or that the event is coextensive with something else.
* Indicative is the name of the most commonly used Wichita inflection translating English sentences out of context. It marks predication as a simple assertion. The time is always non-future, the event described is factual, and the situation is usually one of everyday conversation.
** The prefix is ti- with 3rd persons and ta- otherwise
* The aorist is used in narratives, stories, and in situations where something that happened or might have happened relatively far in the past is meant.
* The future may be interpreted in the traditional way. It is obligatory for any event in the future, no matter how imminent, unless the event is stated to be part of someone&#x27;s plans, in which case intentive is used instead.
* The perfect implies recently completed.
** It makes the fact of completion of activity definite, and specifies an event in the recent past.
* The aorist intentive means &#x27;I heard they were going to ... but they didn&#x27;t.&#x27;
* The indicative intentive means &#x27;They are going to ... &#x27; without implying anything about the evidence on which the statement is based, nor about the probability of completion.
* The optional inflection quotative occurs with the aorist, future, or perfect tenses.
** If it occurs, it specifies that the speaker&#x27;s information is from some source other than personal observation or knowledge.
*** &#x27;I heard that ... &#x27; or &#x27;I didn&#x27;t know, but ... &#x27;
** If it does not occur, the form unambiguously implies that evidence for the report is personal observation.

Examples:
ʔarasi &#x27;cook&#x27;
===Modifiers===

===Case===

In the Wichita language, there are only case markings for obliques. Here are some examples:

====Instrumental case====
* The suffix Rá:hir, added to the base
* Another means of expressing instrument, used only for body parts, is a characteristic position of incorporation in the verb complex
** ha:rhiwi:cá:hir &#x27;using a bowl&#x27; (ha:rhiwi:c &#x27;bowl&#x27;)
** ika:rá:hir &#x27;with a rock&#x27; (ika:ʔa &#x27;rock&#x27;)

====Locative case====
Most nouns take a locative suffix kiyah:
But a few take the verbal :
Any verbal participle (i.e. any sentence) can be converted to a locative clause by the suffix 
* &#x27;it is a creek&#x27;
* &#x27;where the creek is&#x27;

===Predicates and arguments===
Wichita is a polysynthetic language. Almost all the information in any simple sentence is expressed by means of bound morphemes in the verb complex. The only exception to this are (1) noun stems, specifically those functioning as agents of transitive verbs but sometimes those in other functions as well, and (2) specific modifying particles. A typical sentence from a story is the following:

Note that &quot;squirrel&quot; is the agent and occurs by itself with no morphemes indicating number or anything else. The verb, in addition to the verbal units of quotative, aorist, repetitive, and imperfective, also contain morphemes that indicate the agent is singular, the patient is collective, the direction of the action is to the top, and all the lexical information about the whole patient noun phrase, &quot;big quantity of meat.&quot;

==Gender==
In the Wichita language, there is no gender distinction (WALS).

==Person and possession==
The verb &#x27;have, possess&#x27; in Wichita is /uR ... ʔi/, a combination of the preverb &#x27;possessive&#x27; and the root &#x27;be&#x27;. Possession of a noun can be expressed by incorporating that noun in this verb and indicating the person of the possessor by the subject pronoun:

==Number marking==
Nouns can be divided into those that are countable and those that are not. In general, this correlates with the possibility for plural marking: Countable nouns can be marked for dual or plural; if not so marked, they are assumed to be singular. Uncountable nouns cannot be pluralized.

Those uncountable nouns that are also liquids are marked as such by a special morpheme, &quot;kir&quot;.

Those incountable nouns that are not liquid are not otherwise marked in Wichita. This feature is labeled dry mass. Forms such as &quot;ye:c&quot; &#x27;fire&#x27;, &quot;kirʔi:c&quot; &#x27;bread&#x27;, and &quot;ka:hi:c&quot; &#x27;salt&#x27; are included in this category.

Wichita countable nouns are divided into those that are collective and those that are not. The collective category includes most materials, such as wood; anything that normally comes in pieces, such as meat, corn, or flour; and any containers such as pots, bowls, or sacks when they are filled with pieces of something.

Some of the noncollective nominals are also marked for other selectional restrictions. In particular, with some verbs, animate nouns (including first and second person pronouns) require special treatment when they are patients in the sentence. Whenever there is an animate patient or object of certain verbs such as &quot;u...raʔa&quot; &#x27;bring&#x27; or &quot;irasi&quot; &#x27;find&#x27;, the morpheme |hiʔri|(/hirʔ/, /hiʔr/, /hirʔi/) also occurs with the verb. The use of this morpheme is not predictable by rule and must be specified for each verb in the language that requires it.

Like &quot;hiʔri&quot; &#x27;patient is animate&#x27;, the morpheme &quot;wakhahr&quot;, means &#x27;patient is an activity&#x27;.

Countable nouns that are neither animate nor activities, such as chairs, apples, rocks, or body parts, do not require any semantic class agreement morphemes in the surface grammar of Wichita.

The morpheme |ra:k| marks any or all non-third persons in the sentence as plural.

The morpheme for &#x27;collective&#x27; or &#x27;patient is not singular&#x27;. The shape of this varies from verb to verb, but the collective is usually |ru|, |ra|, or |r|.

The noncollective plural is usually |ʔak|. Instead of a morpheme here, some roots change form to mark plural. Examples include:
A surface structure object in the non-third-person category can be clearly marked as singular, dual, or plural. The morpheme &quot;ra:k&quot; marks plurality; a combination oh &quot;hi&quot; and &quot;ʔak&quot; marks dual. Singular is marked by zero.

If both agent and patient are third person, a few intransitive verbs permit the same distinctions for patients as are possible for non-third objects: singular, dual, and plural. These verbs (such as &#x27;come&#x27; and &#x27;sit&#x27;) allow the morpheme &quot;wa&quot; to mark &#x27;dual patient&#x27;. In all other cases the morphemes &quot;ru&quot;, &quot;ra&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, or &quot;ʔak&quot; means &#x27;patient is plural&#x27;.
* |hi| subject is nonsingular
* |ʔak| third person patient is nonsingular
* |ra:k| non-third-person is plural. If both the subject and object are non-third person, reference is to the object only.
* |hi ... ʔak| non-third-person is dual
* |ra:kʔak| combine meanings of &quot;ra:k&quot; and &quot;ʔak&quot;
* zero singular

==Endangerment==
According to the Ethnologue Languages of the World website, the Wichita language is &quot;dormant&quot;, meaning that no one has more than symbolic proficiency. The last native speaker of the Wichita language, Doris Jean Lamar McLemore, died in 2016. The reason for the language&#x27;s decline is because the speakers of the Wichita language switched to speaking English. Thus, children were not being taught Wichita and only the elders knew the language. &quot;Extensive efforts to document and preserve the language&quot; are in effect through the Wichita Documentation Project.

==Revitalization efforts==
The Wichita and Affiliated Tribes offered language classes, taught by Doris McLemore and Shirley Davilla. The tribe created an immersion class for children and a class for adults. Linguist David Rood has collaborated with Wichita speakers to create a dictionary and language CDs. The tribe is collaborating with Rood of the University of Colorado, Boulder to document and teach the language through the Wichita Documentation Project.

<text>The Battle of Fort Sumter (also the Attack on Fort Sumter or the Fall of Fort Sumter) (April 12–13, 1861) was the bombardment of Fort Sumter near Charleston, South Carolina, by the South Carolina militia. It ended with the surrender of the fort by the United States Army, beginning the American Civil War.

Following the declaration of secession by South Carolina on December 20, 1860, its authorities demanded that the U.S. Army abandon its facilities in Charleston Harbor. On December 26, Major Robert Anderson of the U.S. Army surreptitiously moved his small command from the vulnerable Fort Moultrie on Sullivan&#x27;s Island to Fort Sumter, a substantial fortress built on an island controlling the entrance of Charleston Harbor. An attempt by U.S. President James Buchanan to reinforce and resupply Anderson using the unarmed merchant ship &quot;Star of the West&quot; failed when it was fired upon by shore batteries on January 9, 1861. The ship was hit three times, which caused no major damage but nonetheless kept the supplies from reaching Anderson.

During the early months of 1861, the situation around Fort Sumter increasingly began to resemble a siege. In March, Brigadier General P. G. T. Beauregard, the first general officer of the newly formed Confederate States Army, was placed in command of Confederate forces in Charleston. Beauregard energetically directed the strengthening of batteries around Charleston harbor aimed at Fort Sumter. Conditions in the fort deteriorated due to shortages of men, food, and supplies as the Union soldiers rushed to complete the installation of additional guns.

The resupply of Fort Sumter became the first crisis of the administration of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln, inaugurated March 4, 1861, following his victory in the election of November 6, 1860. He notified the governor of South Carolina, Francis Wilkinson Pickens, that he was sending supply ships, which resulted in an ultimatum from the Confederate government for the immediate evacuation of Fort Sumter, which Major Anderson refused. Beginning at 4:30 a.m. on April 12, the Confederates bombarded the fort from artillery batteries surrounding the harbor. Although the Union garrison returned fire, they were significantly outgunned and, after 34 hours, Major Anderson agreed to evacuate. There were no deaths on either side as a direct result of this engagement, although a gun explosion during the surrender ceremonies on April 14 caused the death of two U.S. Army soldiers. The event often regarded as the &quot;First Bloodshed of the Civil War&quot; was the Baltimore riot of 1861, one week later.

Following the battle, there was widespread support from both North and South for further military action. Lincoln&#x27;s immediate call for 75,000 volunteers to suppress the rebellion resulted in an additional four Southern states also declaring their secession and joining the Confederacy. The battle is usually recognized as the first of the American Civil War.

==Background==
===Secession===
On December 20, 1860, shortly after Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s victory in the presidential election of 1860, South Carolina adopted an ordinance declaring its secession from the United States of America, and by February 1861 six more Southern states had adopted similar ordinances of secession. On February 7, the seven states adopted a provisional constitution for the Confederate States of America and established their temporary capital at Montgomery, Alabama. A February peace conference met in Washington, D.C., but failed to resolve the crisis. The remaining eight slave states declined pleas to join the Confederacy.

The seceding states seized Federal properties within their boundaries, including buildings, arsenals, and fortifications. President James Buchanan protested but took no action. Buchanan was concerned that an overt action could cause the remaining slave states to leave the Union, and while he thought that there was no constitutional authority for a state to secede, he could find no constitutional authority for him to act to prevent it.

===Forts of Charleston===

Several forts had been constructed in Charleston&#x27;s harbor, including Fort Sumter and Fort Moultrie, which were not among the sites seized initially. Fort Moultrie on Sullivan Island was the oldest—it was the site of fortifications since 1776—and was the headquarters of the U.S. Army garrison. However, it had been designed as a gun platform for defending the harbor, and its defenses against land-based attacks were feeble; during the crisis, the Charleston newspapers commented that sand dunes had piled up against the walls in such a way that the wall could easily be scaled. When the garrison began clearing away the dunes, the papers objected.

Major Robert Anderson of the 1st U.S. Artillery regiment had been appointed to command the Charleston garrison that fall because of rising tensions. A native of Kentucky, he was a protégé of Winfield Scott, the general in chief of the Army, and was thought more capable of handling a crisis than the garrison&#x27;s previous commander, Col. John L. Gardner, who was nearing retirement. Anderson had served an earlier tour of duty at Fort Moultrie and his father had been a defender of the fort (then called Fort Sullivan) during the American Revolutionary War. Throughout the fall, South Carolina authorities considered both secession and the expropriation of federal property in the harbor to be inevitable. As tensions mounted, the environment around the fort increasingly resembled a siege, to the point that the South Carolina authorities placed picket ships to observe the movements of the troops and threatened to attack when forty rifles were transferred to one of the harbor forts from the U.S. arsenal in the city.

In contrast to Moultrie, Fort Sumter dominated the entrance to Charleston Harbor and, though unfinished, was designed to be one of the strongest fortresses in the world. In the fall of 1860 work on the fort was nearly completed, but the fortress was thus far garrisoned by a single soldier, who functioned as a lighthouse keeper, and a small party of civilian construction workers. Under the cover of darkness on December 26, six days after South Carolina declared its secession, Anderson abandoned the indefensible Fort Moultrie, ordering its guns spiked and its gun carriages burned, and surreptitiously relocated his command by small boats to Sumter.

===President Buchanan and the &quot;Star of the West&quot;===
South Carolina authorities considered Anderson&#x27;s move to be a breach of faith. Governor Francis Wilkinson Pickens believed that President Buchanan had made implicit promises to him to keep Sumter unoccupied and suffered political embarrassment as a result of his trust in those promises. Buchanan, a former U.S. Secretary of State and diplomat, had used carefully crafted ambiguous language to Pickens, promising that he would not &quot;immediately&quot; occupy it. From Major Anderson&#x27;s standpoint, he was merely moving his existing garrison troops from one of the locations under his command to another. He had received instructions from the War Department on December 11, written by Major General Don Carlos Buell, Assistant Adjutant General of the Army, approved by Secretary of War John B. Floyd:

Pickens, therefore, ordered that all remaining Federal positions except Fort Sumter were to be seized. State troops quickly occupied Fort Moultrie (capturing 56 guns), Fort Johnson on James Island, and the battery on Morris Island. On December 27, an assault force of 150 men seized the Union-occupied Castle Pinckney fortification, in the harbor close to downtown Charleston, capturing 24 guns and mortars, while the small U.S. Army garrison retired to Fort Sumter to join Major Robert Anderson. On December 30, the Federal arsenal in Charleston was captured, resulting in the acquisition of more than 22,000 weapons by the militia. The Confederates promptly made repairs at Fort Moultrie and dozens of new batteries and defense positions armed with weapons captured from the arsenal were constructed throughout the Charleston harbor area, including an unusual floating battery.

President Buchanan was surprised and dismayed at Anderson&#x27;s move to Sumter, unaware of the authorization Anderson had received. Nevertheless, he refused Pickens&#x27;s demand to evacuate Charleston harbor. Since the garrison&#x27;s supplies were limited, Buchanan authorized a relief expedition of supplies, small arms, and 200 soldiers. The original intent was to send the Navy sloop-of-war USS &quot;Brooklyn&quot;, but it was discovered that Confederates had sunk some derelict ships to block the shipping channel into Charleston and there was concern that &quot;Brooklyn&quot; had too deep a draft to negotiate the obstacles. Instead, it seemed prudent to send an unarmed civilian merchant ship, &quot;Star of the West&quot;, which might be perceived as less provocative to the Confederates. As &quot;Star of the West&quot; approached the harbor entrance on January 9, 1861, it was fired upon by a battery on Morris Island, which was staffed by cadets from The Citadel, among them William Stewart Simkins, who were the only trained artillerymen in the service of South Carolina at the time. Batteries from Fort Moultrie joined in and &quot;Star of the West&quot; was forced to withdraw. Major Anderson prepared his guns at Sumter when he heard the Confederate fire, but the secrecy of the operation had kept him unaware that a relief expedition was in progress and he chose not to start a general engagement.

In a letter delivered January 31, 1861, Pickens demanded of President Buchanan that he surrender Fort Sumter because, &quot;I regard that possession is not consistent with the dignity or safety of the State of South Carolina.&quot;

===Preparations for war===

Conditions at the fort were difficult during the winter of 1860–1861. Rations were short and fuel for heat was limited. The garrison scrambled to complete the defenses as best they could. Fort Sumter was designed to mount 135 guns, operated by 650 officers and men, but construction had met with numerous delays for decades and budget cuts had left it only about 90 percent finished in early 1861. Anderson&#x27;s garrison consisted of just 85 men, primarily made up of two small artillery companies: Company E, 1st U.S. Artillery, commanded by Capt. Abner Doubleday, and Company H, commanded by Capt. Truman Seymour. There were six other officers present: Surgeon Samuel W. Crawford, First Lt. Theodore Talbot of Company H, First Lt. Jefferson C. Davis of the 1st U.S. Artillery, and Second Lt. Norman J. Hall of Company H. Capt. John G. Foster and First Lt. George W. Snyder of the Corps of Engineers were responsible for the construction of the Charleston forts, but they reported to their headquarters in Washington, not directly to Anderson. The remaining personnel were 68 noncommissioned officers and privates, eight musicians, and 43 noncombatant workmen.

By April the Union troops had positioned 60 guns, but they had insufficient men to operate them all. The fort consisted of three levels of enclosed gun positions, or casemates. The second level of casemates was unoccupied. The majority of the guns were on the first level of casemates, on the upper level (the parapet or barbette positions), and on the center parade field. Unfortunately for the defenders, the original mission of the fort—harbor defense—meant that it was designed so that the guns were primarily aimed at the Atlantic, with little capability of protecting from artillery fire from the surrounding land or from infantry conducting an amphibious assault.
In March, Brig. Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard took command of South Carolina forces in Charleston; on March 1, President Jefferson Davis had appointed him the first general officer in the armed forces of the new Confederacy, specifically to take command of the siege. Beauregard made repeated demands that the Union force either surrender or withdraw, and took steps to ensure that no supplies from the city were available to the defenders, whose food was running low. He also increased drills amongst the South Carolina militia, training them to operate the guns they manned. Major Anderson had been Beauregard&#x27;s artillery instructor at West Point; the two had been especially close, and Beauregard had become Anderson&#x27;s assistant after graduation. Both sides spent March drilling and improving their fortifications to the best of their abilities.

Beauregard, a trained military engineer, built up overwhelming strength to challenge Fort Sumter. Fort Moultrie had three 8-inch Columbiads, two 8-inch howitzers, five 32-pound smoothbores, and four 24-pounders. Outside of Moultrie were five 10-inch mortars, two 32-pounders, two 24-pounders, and a 9-inch Dahlgren smoothbore. The floating battery next to Fort Moultrie had two 42-pounders and two 32-pounders on a raft protected by iron shielding. Fort Johnson on James Island had one 24-pounder and four 10-inch mortars. At Cummings Point on Morris Island, the Confederates had emplaced seven 10-inch mortars, two 42-pounders, a British 12-pound Blakely rifle, and three 8-inch Columbiads, the latter in the so-called Iron Battery, protected by a wooden shield faced with iron bars. About 6,000 men were available to man the artillery and to assault the fort, if necessary, including the local militia, young boys, and older men.

===Decisions for war===
On March 4, 1861, Abraham Lincoln was inaugurated as president. He was almost immediately confronted with the surprise information that Major Anderson was reporting that only six weeks of rations remained at Fort Sumter. A crisis similar to the one at Fort Sumter had emerged at Pensacola, Florida, where Confederates threatened another U.S. fortification—Fort Pickens. Lincoln and his new cabinet struggled with the decisions of whether to reinforce the forts, and how. They were also concerned about whether to take actions that might start open hostilities and which side would be perceived as the aggressor as a result. Similar discussions and concerns were occurring in the Confederacy.

After the formation of the Confederate States of America in early February, there was some debate among the secessionists whether the capture of the fort was rightly a matter for South Carolina or for the newly declared national government in Montgomery, Alabama. Pickens was among the states&#x27; rights advocates who thought that all property in Charleston harbor had reverted to South Carolina upon that state&#x27;s secession as an independent commonwealth. This debate ran alongside another discussion about how aggressively the installations—including Forts Sumter and Pickens—should be obtained. President Davis, like his counterpart in Washington, preferred that his side not be seen as the aggressor. Both sides believed that the first side to use force would lose precious political support in the border states, whose allegiance was undetermined; before Lincoln&#x27;s inauguration on March 4, five states had voted &quot;against&quot; secession, including Virginia, and Lincoln openly offered to evacuate Fort Sumter if it would guarantee Virginia&#x27;s loyalty. When asked about that offer, Abraham Lincoln commented, &quot;A state for a fort is no bad business.&quot;

The South sent delegations to Washington, D.C., and offered to pay for the Federal properties and enter into a peace treaty with the United States. Lincoln rejected any negotiations with the Confederate agents because he did not consider the Confederacy a legitimate nation and making any treaty with it would be tantamount to recognition of it as a sovereign government. However, Secretary of State William H. Seward, who wished to give up Sumter for political reasons—as a gesture of good will—engaged in unauthorized and indirect negotiations that failed.

On April 4, as the supply situation on Sumter became critical, President Lincoln ordered a relief expedition, to be commanded by a former naval captain (and future Assistant Secretary of the Navy) Gustavus V. Fox, who had proposed a plan for nighttime landings of smaller vessels than the &quot;Star of the West&quot;. Fox&#x27;s orders were to land at Sumter with supplies only, and if he was opposed by the Confederates, to respond with the U.S. Navy vessels following and to then land both supplies and men. This time, Maj. Anderson was informed of the impending expedition, although the arrival date was not revealed to him. On April 6, Lincoln notified Pickens that &quot;an attempt will be made to supply Fort Sumter with provisions only, and that if such attempt be not resisted, no effort to throw in men, arms, or ammunition will be made without further notice, [except] in case of an attack on the fort.&quot;

Lincoln&#x27;s notification had been made to the governor of South Carolina, not the new Confederate government, which Lincoln did not recognize. Pickens consulted with Beauregard, the local Confederate commander. Soon President Davis ordered Beauregard to repeat the demand for Sumter&#x27;s surrender, and if it did not, to reduce the fort before the relief expedition arrived. The Confederate cabinet, meeting in Montgomery, endorsed Davis&#x27;s order on April 9. Only Secretary of State Robert Toombs opposed this decision: he reportedly told Jefferson Davis the attack &quot;will lose us every friend at the North. You will only strike a hornet&#x27;s nest. ... Legions now quiet will swarm out and sting us to death. It is unnecessary. It puts us in the wrong. It is fatal.&quot;

Beauregard dispatched aides—Col. James Chesnut, Col. James A. Chisholm, and Capt. Stephen D. Lee—to Fort Sumter on April 11 to issue the ultimatum. Anderson refused, although he reportedly commented, &quot;I shall await the first shot, and if you do not batter us to pieces, we shall be starved out in a few days.&quot; The aides returned to Charleston and reported this comment to Beauregard. At 1 a.m. on April 12, the aides brought Anderson a message from Beauregard: &quot;If you will state the time which you will evacuate Fort Sumter, and agree in the meantime that you will not use your guns against us unless ours shall be employed against Fort Sumter, we will abstain from opening fire upon you.&quot; After consulting with his senior officers, Maj. Anderson replied that he would evacuate Sumter by noon, April 15, unless he received new orders from his government or additional supplies. Col. Chesnut considered this reply to be too conditional and wrote a reply, which he handed to Anderson at 3:20 a.m.: &quot;Sir: by authority of Brigadier General Beauregard, commanding the Provisional Forces of the Confederate States, we have the honor to notify you that he will open fire of his batteries on Fort Sumter in one hour from this time.&quot; Anderson escorted the officers back to their boat, shook hands with each one, and said &quot;If we never meet in this world again, God grant that we may meet in the next.&quot;

==Bombardment==

At 4:30 a.m. on April 12, 1861, Lt. Henry S. Farley, acting upon the command of Capt. George S. James, fired a single 10-inch mortar round from Fort Johnson. (James had offered the first shot to Roger Pryor, a noted Virginia secessionist, who declined, saying, &quot;I could not fire the first gun of the war.&quot;) The shell exploded over Fort Sumter as a signal to open the general bombardment from 43 guns and mortars at Fort Moultrie, Fort Johnson, the floating battery, and Cummings Point. Under orders from Beauregard, the guns fired in a counterclockwise sequence around the harbor, with 2 minutes between each shot; Beauregard wanted to conserve ammunition, which he calculated would last for only 48 hours. Edmund Ruffin, another noted Virginia secessionist, had traveled to Charleston to be present at the beginning of the war, and after the signal round, fired one of the first shots at Sumter, a 64-pound shell from the Iron Battery at Cummings Point. The shelling of Fort Sumter from the batteries ringing the harbor awakened Charleston&#x27;s residents (including diarist Mary Chesnut), who rushed out into the predawn darkness to watch the shells arc over the water and burst inside the fort.

Major Anderson held his fire, awaiting daylight. His troops reported for a call at 6 a.m. and then had breakfast. At 7 a.m., Capt. Abner Doubleday fired a shot at the Ironclad Battery at Cummings Point, but he missed. Given the available manpower, Anderson could not take advantage of all of his 60 guns. He deliberately avoided using guns that were situated in the fort where casualties were most likely. The fort&#x27;s best cannons were mounted on the uppermost of its three tiers—the barbette tier—where his troops were most exposed to incoming fire from overhead. The fort had been designed to withstand a naval assault, and naval warships of the time did not mount guns capable of elevating to shoot over the walls of the fort. However, the land-based cannons manned by the Confederates were capable of high-arcing ballistic trajectories and could therefore fire at parts of the fort that would have been out of naval guns&#x27; reach. Fort Sumter&#x27;s garrison could only safely fire the 21 working guns on the lowest level, which themselves, because of the limited elevation allowed by their embrasures, were largely incapable of delivering fire with trajectories high enough to seriously threaten Fort Moultrie. Moreover, although the Federals had moved as many of their supplies to Fort Sumter as they could manage, the fort was quite low on ammunition and was nearly out at the end of the 34-hour bombardment. A more immediate problem was the scarcity of cloth gunpowder cartridges or bags; only 700 were available at the beginning of the battle and workmen sewed frantically to create more, in some cases using socks from Anderson&#x27;s personal wardrobe. Because of the shortages, Anderson reduced his firing to only six guns: two aimed at Cummings Point, two at Fort Moultrie, and two at the Sullivan&#x27;s Island batteries.

Ships from Fox&#x27;s relief expedition began to arrive on April 12. Although Fox himself arrived at 3 a.m. on his steamer &quot;Baltic&quot;, most of the rest of his fleet was delayed until 6 p.m., and one of the two warships, USS &quot;Powhatan&quot;, never did arrive. Unbeknownst to Fox, it had been ordered to the relief of Fort Pickens in Florida. As small craft were sent toward the fort with supplies, the artillery fire deterred them and they pulled back. Fox decided to wait until after dark and for the arrival of his warships. The next day, heavy seas made it difficult to load the small boats with men and supplies and Fox was left with the hope that Anderson and his men could hold out until dark on April 13.

Although Sumter was a masonry fort, there were wooden buildings inside for barracks and officer quarters. The Confederates targeted these with heated shot (cannonballs heated red hot in a furnace), starting fires that could have proven more dangerous to the men than explosive artillery shells. At 7 p.m. on April 12, a rain shower extinguished the flames and, at the same time, the Union gunners stopped firing for the night. They slept fitfully, concerned about a potential infantry assault against the fort. During the darkness, the Confederates reduced their fire to four shots each hour. The following morning, the full bombardment resumed and the Confederates continued firing hot shot against the wooden buildings. By noon most of the wooden buildings in the fort and the main gate were on fire. The flames moved toward the main ammunition magazine, where 300 barrels of gunpowder were stored. The Union soldiers frantically tried to move the barrels to safety, but two-thirds were left when Anderson judged it was too dangerous and ordered the magazine doors closed. He ordered the remaining barrels thrown into the sea, but the tide kept floating them back together into groups, some of which were ignited by incoming artillery rounds. He also ordered his crews to redouble their efforts at firing, but the Confederates did the same, firing the hot shots almost exclusively. Many of the Confederate soldiers admired the courage and determination of the Yankees. When the fort had to pause its firing, the Confederates often cheered and applauded after the firing resumed and they shouted epithets at some of the nearby Union ships for failing to come to the fort&#x27;s aid.

==Surrender==
The fort&#x27;s central flagpole was knocked down at 1 p.m. on April 13, raising doubts among the Confederates about whether the fort was ready to surrender. Col. Louis Wigfall, a former U.S. senator, had been observing the battle and decided that this indicated the fort had endured enough. He commandeered a small boat and proceeded from Morris Island, waving a white handkerchief from his sword, dodging incoming rounds from Sullivan&#x27;s Island. Meeting with Major Anderson, he said, &quot;You have defended your flag nobly, Sir. You have done all that it is possible to do, and General Beauregard wants to stop this fight. On what terms, Major Anderson, will you evacuate this fort?&quot; Anderson was encouraged that Wigfall had said &quot;evacuate,&quot; not &quot;surrender.&quot; He was low on ammunition, fires were burning out of control, and his men were hungry and exhausted. Satisfied that they had defended their post with honor, enduring over 3,000 Confederate rounds without losing a man, Anderson agreed to a truce at 2:00 p.m.

Fort Sumter raised Wigfall&#x27;s white handkerchief on its flagpole as Wigfall departed in his small boat back to Morris Island, where he was hailed as a hero. The handkerchief was spotted in Charleston and a delegation of officers representing Beauregard—Stephen D. Lee, Porcher Miles, a former mayor of Charleston, and Roger Pryor—sailed to Sumter, unaware of Wigfall&#x27;s visit. Anderson was outraged when these officers disavowed Wigfall&#x27;s authority, telling him that the former senator had not spoken with Beauregard for two days, and he threatened to resume firing. Meanwhile, General Beauregard himself had finally seen the handkerchief and sent a second set of officers, offering essentially the same terms that Wigfall had presented, so the agreement was reinstated.

The Union garrison formally surrendered the fort to Confederate personnel at 2:30 p.m., April 13. No one from either side was killed during the bombardment. During the 100-gun salute to the U.S. flag—Anderson&#x27;s one condition for withdrawal—a pile of cartridges blew up from a spark, mortally wounding privates Daniel Hough and Edward Galloway, and seriously wounding the other four members of the gun crew; these were the first military fatalities of the war. The salute was stopped at fifty shots. Hough was buried in the Fort Sumter parade ground within two hours after the explosion. Galloway and Private George Fielding were sent to the hospital in Charleston, where Galloway died a few days later; Fielding was released after six weeks. The other wounded men and the remaining Union troops were placed aboard a Confederate steamer, the &quot;Isabel&quot;, where they spent the night and were transported the next morning to Fox&#x27;s relief ship &quot;Baltic&quot;, resting outside the harbor bar.


Anderson carried the Fort Sumter Flag with him north, where it became a widely known symbol of the battle and rallying point for supporters of the Union. This inspired Frederic Edwin Church to paint &quot;Our Banner in the Sky&quot;, described as a &quot;symbolic landscape embodying the stars and stripes.&quot; A chromolithograph was then created and sold to benefit the families of Union soldiers.
==Aftermath==
The bombardment of Fort Sumter was the first military action of the American Civil War. Following the surrender, Northerners rallied behind Lincoln&#x27;s call for all states to send troops to recapture the forts and preserve the Union. With the scale of the rebellion apparently small so far, Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers for 90 days. Some Northern states filled their quotas quickly. There were so many volunteers in Ohio that within 16 days they could have met the full call for 75,000 men by themselves. Other governors from border states were undiplomatic in their responses. For example, Gov. Claiborne Jackson wrote, &quot;Not one man will the state of Missouri furnish to carry on any such unholy crusade&quot;, and Gov. Beriah Magoffin wrote, &quot;Kentucky will furnish no troops for the wicked purpose of subduing her sister Southern states.&quot; The call for 75,000 troops triggered four additional slave states to declare their secession from the Union and join the Confederacy. The ensuing war lasted four years, effectively ending in April 1865 with the surrender of General Robert E. Lee&#x27;s Army of Northern Virginia at New Appomattox Court House.

Charleston Harbor was completely in Confederate hands for almost the entire four-year duration of the war, leaving a hole in the Union naval blockade. Union forces conducted major operations in 1862 and 1863 to capture Charleston, first overland on James Island (the Battle of Secessionville, June 1862), then by naval assault against Fort Sumter (the First Battle of Charleston Harbor, April 1863), then by seizing the Confederate artillery positions on Morris Island (beginning with the Second Battle of Fort Wagner, July 1863, and followed by a siege until September). After pounding Sumter to rubble with artillery fire, a final amphibious operation attempted to occupy it (the Second Battle of Fort Sumter, September 1863), but was repulsed and no further attempts were made. The Confederates evacuated Fort Sumter and Charleston in February 1865 as Union Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman outflanked the city in the Carolinas campaign. On April 14, 1865, four years to the day after lowering the Fort Sumter Flag in surrender, Robert Anderson (by then a major general, although ill and in retired status) returned to the ruined fort to raise the flag he had lowered in 1861.

Two of the cannons used at Fort Sumter were later presented to Louisiana State University by General William Tecumseh Sherman, who was president of the university before the war began.

===Tributes===

The U.S. Post Office Department released the Fort Sumter Centennial issue as the first in the series of five stamps marking the Civil War Centennial on April 12, 1961, at the Charleston post office. The stamp was designed by Charles R. Chickering. It illustrates a seacoast gun from Fort Sumter aimed by an officer in a typical uniform of the time. The background features palmetto leaves akin to bursting shells. The state tree of South Carolina, the palmettos suggest the geopolitical area opening Civil War hostilities. This stamp was produced by an engraving and printed by the rotary process in panes of fifty stamps each. The Postal Department authorized an initial printing of 120 million stamps.

<text>Clive Charles Hamilton AM FRSA (born 12 March 1953) is an Australian public intellectual currently serving as Professor of Public Ethics at the Centre for Applied Philosophy and Public Ethics (CAPPE) and the Vice-Chancellor&#x27;s Chair in Public Ethics at Charles Sturt University. He is a member of the board of the Climate Change Authority of the Australian Government, and is the founder and former executive director of The Australia Institute. He regularly appears in the Australian media and contributes to public policy debates. Hamilton was granted the award of Member of the Order of Australia on 8 June 2009 for &quot;service to public debate and policy development, particularly in the fields of climate change, sustainability and societal trends&quot;.

==Education and academic career==
Hamilton graduated from the Australian National University with a Bachelor of Arts in history, psychology and pure mathematics in 1975 and completed a Bachelor of Economics with First Class Honours from the University of Sydney in 1979. He was an Overseas Commonwealth Postgraduate Scholar and completed his Doctorate at the Institute of Development Studies at the University of Sussex in 1984. His thesis was titled &quot;A general equilibrium model of South Korean development&quot;.

He was a postdoctoral fellow and research fellow at the Research School of Pacific Studies of the Australian National University from 1984 to 1988 and the director of the Graduate Program in the Economics of the Development at the National Centre for Development Studies of the Australian National University from 1986 to 1988. From 1994 to 1997 he was a senior lecturer in public policy and from 1997 to 2002 he was a fellow in public policy at the Australian National University and he was a Visiting Fellow of the National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health in 2004.

From 1988 to 1990 he was a senior research economist at the Bureau of Industry Economics of the Federal Department of Industry, Science and Resources (now the Productivity Commission).

Hamilton founded the Australia Institute in 1993 and was executive director until 2008.

He has been an academic visitor at the Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics, a visiting lecturer at the Oxford Martin School and a visiting professor at the Faculty of Philosophy of the University of Oxford.

He is a Life Member of Clare Hall, University of Cambridge and was a visiting scholar of the Department of Land Economy of the University of Cambridge.

He was a senior visiting fellow of the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies of Yale University.

==Works==
Hamilton has written about the issue of climate change politics over a period of some 15 years. His book &quot;Requiem for a Species&quot; (Earthscan 2010) explores climate change denial and its implications. His earlier books, &quot;&quot; (2007) and &quot;Running from the Storm&quot; (2001), were critical of the Australian Government&#x27;s efforts, especially in relation to the Kyoto Protocol. Hamilton&#x27;s general view about climate change is that the &quot;world is on a path to a very unpleasant future and it is too late to stop it&quot;. Hamilton argues that to believe anything else is to deny the climate change truth and engage in wishful thinking.

Hamilton has written several books relating to consumerism and overconsumption. &quot;Growth Fetish&quot; (2003) became an Australian best-seller and suggests that the unthinking pursuit of economic growth has become a fetish, which has not led to any real improvements in levels of happiness. In &quot;Growth Fetish&quot;, Hamilton advocates the politics of wellbeing over economic growth. In &quot;&quot; (2005), Hamilton describes how these themes play out at a personal level, as he explores the shallowness of modern consumer life. In &quot;What&#x27;s Left?&quot; (2006) Hamilton comments on topics written about in &quot;Growth Fetish&quot; and &quot;Affluenza&quot;. He argues that there is an emergence of new types of &quot;alienation and exploitation&quot;, in the form of ravages of the free market, which have &quot;robbed life of its meaning&quot;. &quot;The Freedom Paradox&quot; (2008) relates to the nature and consequences of advanced consumer capitalism. In the book Hamilton proposes a system of &quot;post-secular ethics&quot; that will serve as a challenge to the &quot;moral malaise&quot; occasioned by the &quot;freedom of the marketplace&quot;.

&quot;Silencing Dissent: How the Australian Government is Controlling Public Opinion and Stifling Debate&quot;, edited with Sarah Maddison was published in 2007.

In February 2018 Hamilton published the book &quot;Silent Invasion: China&#x27;s influence in Australia&quot; on the increasing involvement of the Chinese Communist Party in Australian civil society and politics.

In June 2020, British businessman and advocate of closer China-UK economic relations Stephen Perry and the 48 Group Club launched a defamation lawsuit in a failed attempt to block the release of Hamilton&#x27;s &quot;Hidden Hand: Exposing How The Chinese Communist Party Is Reshaping The World&quot;.

==Political candidate==

On 23 October 2009, Hamilton was announced as the Australian Greens candidate for the by-election in the federal seat of Higgins. He ran against nine others for the seat, and came second, receiving 32.40 percent of primary votes and 39.77 percent of preferred votes. The Australian Labor Party did not run a candidate in the election.

<doc id="339825" wikidata="Q525362" url="?curid=339825" title="Sonny Perdue">
<text>George Ervin &quot;Sonny&quot; Perdue III (born December 20, 1946) is an American politician, veterinarian, and businessman who served as the 31st United States secretary of agriculture from 2017 to 2021. 
A member of the Republican Party, he previously served as the 81st governor of Georgia from 2003 to 2011 and as a member of the Georgia State Senate from 1991 to 2002.

Founder and partner in an agricultural trading company, Perdue was elected governor of Georgia in 2002, defeating incumbent Roy Barnes and becoming the first Republican to hold the office since the Reconstruction era. He was reelected in 2006 with nearly 60% of the vote. He later served from 2012 to 2017 on the Governors&#x27; Council of the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington, D.C.

On January 18, 2017, President-elect Donald Trump announced that he would nominate Perdue to be Secretary of Agriculture. His nomination was transmitted to the U.S. Senate on March 9, 2017. His nomination was approved by the Senate Agriculture Committee by a 19–1 voice vote on March 30. His appointment was approved by an 87–11 vote by the Senate on April 24. He became the second secretary of agriculture from the Deep South, after Mike Espy of Mississippi. Perdue served as Secretary of Agriculture throughout Trump&#x27;s term.

On March 1, 2022, the Board of Regents of University System of Georgia appointed Perdue as the system&#x27;s 14th chancellor, effective April 1, 2022.

==Early life and education==
Perdue was born in Perry, Georgia, the son of Ophie Viola (Holt), a teacher, and George Ervin Perdue Jr., a farmer. He grew up and still lives in Bonaire, an unincorporated area between Perry and Warner Robins. Born George Ervin Perdue III, Perdue has been known as Sonny since childhood, and prefers to be called by that name; he was sworn in and signs official documents as &quot;Sonny Perdue&quot;. Perdue is the first cousin of former U.S. Senator David Perdue by their grandfather George Ervin Perdue I.

Perdue played quarterback at Warner Robins High School and was a walk-on at the University of Georgia, where he was also a member of the &quot;Beta-Lambda&quot; chapter of Kappa Sigma fraternity.

In 1971, Perdue earned his Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) from the University of Georgia College of Veterinary Medicine, and worked as a veterinarian before becoming a small business owner, eventually starting three small businesses.

Perdue is not related to the family who owns and operates Perdue Farms (commonly associated with the brand &quot;Perdue Chicken&quot;).

==Career==



Perdue served in the U.S. Air Force, rising to the rank of captain before his discharge.

===State senator (1991–2002)===
After serving as a member of the Houston County Planning &amp; Zoning Commission in the 1980s, Perdue ran as a Democrat for a seat in the Georgia General Assembly. He defeated Republican candidate Ned Sanders in 1990 and succeeded Democratic incumbent Ed Barker as the senator representing the 18th district.

Perdue was elected as a Democrat in 1991, 1994, and 1996. He served as his party&#x27;s leader in the Senate from 1994 to 1997 and as president pro tempore. After his first year in office, Senator Perdue wrote then Lt. Governor Pierre Howard asking for more responsibilities, and Howard obliged. He shortly thereafter became a committee chairman, then climbed the leadership ladder to majority leader and to Senate president pro tempore. Many credit Pierre Howard for helping Perdue build the early foundation of what would become his future political career.

His committee assignments included Ethics, Finance &amp; Public Utilities, Health &amp; Human Services, Reapportionment, and Economic Development, Tourism &amp; Cultural Affairs.

He switched party affiliation from Democrat to Republican in 1998 amid feuding with then-Majority Leader Charles Walker and was re-elected to the State Senate as a Republican. He also won reelection in 2000.

==Governor of Georgia (2003–2011)==
===Elections===
====2002====

In December 2001, Perdue resigned as state senator and devoted himself entirely to running for the office of Governor of Georgia. He won the 2002 Georgia gubernatorial election, defeating Democratic incumbent Roy Barnes 51% to 46%, with Libertarian candidate Garrett Michael Hayes taking 2% of the vote. He became the first Republican governor of Georgia in 131 years since Benjamin F. Conley.

====2006====

In 2006, Perdue was re-elected to a second term in the 2006 Georgia gubernatorial election, winning nearly 58% of the vote. His Democratic opponent was Lieutenant Governor Mark Taylor. Libertarian Garrett Michael Hayes was also on the ballot.

===Political positions===
====Economic issues====

Perdue advocated reforms designed to cut waste in government, most notably the sale of surplus vehicles and real estate. Prior to Perdue&#x27;s becoming governor, no state agency had compiled an inventory of what assets were owned by the state.

In January 2003, Perdue signed an executive order prohibiting himself and all other state employees from receiving any gift worth more than $25. During his governorship, Perdue collected at least $25,000 in gifts, including sporting event tickets and airplane flights.

Late in the evening of March 29, 2005, the penultimate day of the legislative session, Representative Larry O&#x27;Neal, who also worked part-time as Perdue&#x27;s personal lawyer, introduced legislation making capital gains tax owed on Georgia land sales deferrable if the income goes to purchase out-of-state land, also, unusually, making the tax break retroactive. Perdue signed the legislation into law on April 12, 2005, three days before tax day. Perdue then used the new law on his 2004 tax return to defer $100,000 in taxable gains from the sale of land.

In 2007, Perdue convinced a skeptical legislature to approve a $19 million fishing tourism program he called Go Fish Georgia. Perdue then decided that the Go Fish Education Center would be built down the road from his home.

====Education reform====
On education, Perdue promoted the return of most decision-making to the local level. After Perdue took office, in 2003 and 2004, Georgia moved up from last place in the country in SAT scores. Although it returned to last place in 2005, Georgia rose to 49th place in 2006 in the combined math and reading mean score, including the writing portion added to the test that year. In 2007, Georgia moved up to 46th place. In 2008, Georgia moved up again, to 45th place. Perdue also created additional opportunities for charter schools and private schools.

====Georgia state flag====
In 2001, Democratic governor Roy Barnes replaced the 1956 state flag, which incorporated the battle flag of the Confederacy, and which had been adopted by Georgia largely as a protest against desegregation. In his 2002 election campaign, Perdue promised that he would let the state&#x27;s citizens vote to determine the state flag. The choices were a modified version of the First National Flag of the Confederate States of America, with the Georgia State Seal prominently displayed inside a circle of 13 stars, or the flag created in 2001 by the Roy Barnes administration. The design of the 2001 Georgian flag was widely unpopular, being derisively named the &quot;Barnes flag&quot;. The North American Vexillological Association had deemed it the ugliest U.S. state flag. Perdue disappointed some Georgians by not making the 1956 flag one of the choices on the ballot, despite a campaign promise to do so. However, Perdue was faced with a Democratic House that would not allow the 1956 flag to be included in the referendum, due to its Confederate origins, and he needed support for a tobacco tax he wanted to pass to raise revenue.

====Environmental issues====
In 2004, Perdue sued the Environmental Protection Agency to block environmental regulations on reformulated gasoline. In a 2014 editorial published by &quot;National Review&quot;, Perdue criticized attempts by &quot;some on the left or in the mainstream media&quot; to connect climate change to weather events. Perdue wrote that &quot;liberals have lost all credibility when it comes to climate science because their arguments have become so ridiculous and so obviously disconnected from reality.&quot;

====Immigration====
In 2006, Perdue signed a law that gave Georgia &quot;some of the nation&#x27;s toughest measures against illegal immigrants.&quot;

====Georgia drought====

On November 13, 2007, while Georgia suffered from one of the worst droughts in several decades, Perdue led a group of several hundred people in prayer on the steps of the state Capitol. Perdue addressed the crowd, saying &quot;We&#x27;ve come together here simply for one reason and one reason only: to very reverently and respectfully pray up a storm&quot; and &quot;God, we need you; we need rain.&quot; According to &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot;, &quot;As the vigil ended, the sun shone through what had been a cloudy morning. In fact, for the next two weeks after the prayer, the state&#x27;s epic dry streak grew worse.&quot;

====African-Americans in the Confederacy====
According to a March 5, 2008, proclamation by Perdue, &quot;Among those who served the Confederacy were many African-Americans, both free and slave, who saw action in the Confederate armed forces in many combat roles. According to the Georgia government&#x27;s website on Confederate History Month, they also participated in the manufacture of products for the war effort, built naval ships, and provided military assistance and relief efforts...&quot; The proclamation was criticized by historians for its historical inaccuracies, although there were, in fact, African-Americans who served the Confederacy. However, most served in the early years of the war and were either forced at gunpoint or feared reprisals for disloyalty.

====Disaster preparedness====
In 2008, Perdue worked with the Georgia Emergency Management Agency to implement Ready Georgia, a campaign to increase disaster preparedness throughout the state. The next year, Georgia was affected by the September floods, which were the most severe in Georgia&#x27;s recorded history. The floods resulted in Perdue declaring a state of emergency in 17 counties.

====Go Fish Education Center criticism====
Beginning in 2007, Governor Perdue began to pursue the goal of making Georgia the &quot;bass-fishing tourism mecca&quot;. The administration began acquiring bond money for the Go Fish Education Center near his home in Perry, GA. According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, payments on the Go Fish bonds, approved by Perdue and the General Assembly in 2007, runs through December 2027 with most payments $1 million a year in bond money.

Upon the end of Perdue&#x27;s term as governor, many in the Georgia General Assembly condemned the project and Perdue after an advisory council (appointed by Perdue) began to funnel additional bond money to the project located in his home county. &quot;To me it was a boondoggle because of the amount of money they were spending and the location,&quot; said Rep. Alan Powell, R-Hartwell, a member of the House Appropriations Committee. &quot;You have got to have stuff where there is a lot of traffic. It&#x27;s a little off the beaten path.&quot;

The project overall has been scrutinized as a waste of taxpayer money due to mismanagement of bond money and extremely low visitors. The Georgia Department of Natural Resources figures showed 21,101 people visited the Perry facility in fiscal 2015, which ended June 30. It generated $102,077 in revenue or about 11 cents for every dollar it cost to run the center in years past.

====Ethics complaints====
During his governorship, the Georgia State Ethics Commission received 13 complaints against Perdue. The State Ethics Commission ruled against Perdue twice, finding that he had taken improper campaign contributions from donors including SunTrust Banks and that he had improperly used one of his family business&#x27;s airplanes on the campaign, for which the commission fined the sitting governor.

====Land purchases====
In mid-2003, Perdue purchased of land next to his Houston County, Georgia, home. The land was adjacent to the Oaky Woods preserve being sold by Weyerhaeuser. The land was eventually sold to developers; however, the state was evaluating bidding on the property and keeping it as a reserve. After the state dropped out of the bidding and the land was sold to developers, the value of Perdue&#x27;s property more than doubled. Perdue failed to disclose his ownership of the property in required financial disclosure forms. In December 2004, Perdue bought $2 million worth of land near Disney World from a developer who he had previously appointed to the state&#x27;s economic development board. A 2005 tax bill passed by the Georgia Legislature allowed residents to gain a tax break if they sold a property in Georgia to buy similar property in another state, and made the change retroactive to 2004. The new law saved Perdue $100,000 in state taxes.

===Post-governorship===
Perdue was constitutionally ineligible to seek a third consecutive term as governor in the 2010 Georgia gubernatorial election. In 2011, he founded Perdue Partners, which facilitated the export of U.S. goods and services. During meetings with Georgia state port officials, then-Governor Perdue discussed his family business&#x27;s use of a terminal, then started a new export company in Savannah soon after leaving office.

==Secretary of Agriculture (2017–2021)==

===Nomination and confirmation===

On January 18, 2017, President Donald Trump announced that he would nominate Perdue to be United States secretary of agriculture. The United States Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry overwhelmingly approved his nomination on March 30, with a 19–1 vote. The sole vote against him came from Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY). Senator David Perdue (R-GA) abstained, as they are first cousins. He was confirmed by the Senate on April 24, with Bernie Sanders and nine Democrats voting against him. He was sworn in by Supreme Court associate justice and fellow Georgian Clarence Thomas.

===Tenure===
In September 2017, Politico reported that, according to 42 reviewed resumes, the department hired 22 former Trump campaign workers, many of which had no significant agricultural knowledge or experience with federal policies.

Perdue was the designated survivor on January 30, 2018, for President Trump&#x27;s first State of the Union address.

During his tenure as Secretary of Agriculture, Perdue focused on helping new farmers get started in agriculture. In August 2017, he announced a mentoring program for new farmers. Other issues addressed by Perdue include assisting rural communities, helping farmers operate with less regulation, increasing exports, passing the 2018 farm bill, and addressing crop damage caused by dicamba. In December 2018, he changed the nutrition standards for school lunches to allow more refined grains, allow milk with added sugar, and increased sodium.

In June 2019, in an interview, Purdue said climate change can be attributed to &quot;weather patterns&quot;.

In July 2019, Perdue ordered two USDA agencies—the Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture—to move from the USDA&#x27;s headquarters in Washington, D.C. to the Kansas City metropolitan area. Two-thirds of the reassigned USDA employees chose to quit rather than accept relocation. The attrition rate was particularly high in the Resource and Rural Economics Division (90%) and in the Food Economics Division (up to 89%). Current and former employees of the ERS were strongly critical of the relocation to Kansas City, saying the resulting exodus of scientific and economic talent caused disruption to federal research, especially on climate change and food security.

Under Perdue, the Department of Agriculture (USDA) was accused of suppressing scientific publications for political reasons. Economists in the USDA&#x27;s research branch were told to include disclaimers in their peer-reviewed publications stating that the findings were &quot;preliminary&quot; and &quot;should not be construed to represent any agency determination or policy&quot;. In August 2019, Lewis Ziska, a USDA plant physiology climate scientist, quit after department administrators attempted to impede the publication of one of his studies in the journal &quot;Science Advances&quot;. The USDA&#x27;s press office rejected CNN&#x27;s request to interview Ziska, but not Politico&#x27;s, where he went on to describe the department as internally fearful of Perdue&#x27;s open skepticism towards climate change, which, according to Ziska, has led officials to &quot;go to extremes to obscure their work to avoid political blowback&quot;.

In February 2020, Perdue endorsed putting a price on carbon dioxide, a climate change policy favored by many economists. He stated that “legitimate, measurable carbon trading” could spur so-called carbon sequestration by giving farmers an incentive to innovate. He was the only member of the Trump administration to endorse such a plan.

In August 2020, Perdue supported the president&#x27;s re-election while promoting the Farmers to Families Food Box Program; Perdue was fined for violating the Hatch Act.

===Financial controversies===
In June 2021, a news story broke of financial dealings Perdue had after his nomination as Secretary of Agriculture but before his confirmation. On December 30, 2016, Perdue&#x27;s company AGrowStar purchased property and a facility from Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM), a large American agribusiness corporation that the Department of Agriculture regulates. The property (in Estill, South Carolina) had originally been purchased by ADM for 5.5 million dollars, and independent assessments and government tax assessors agree on that as a fair range; however, AGrowStar was offered the property for US$250,000, a fraction of its value. After the sale, the huge boiler on the property was sold for approximately $500,000, easily covering the cost of the purchase even if the rest of the land had been valueless. A low-ball estimate of the value of storage in the grain silos was US$3 million. Critics argued that the deal should be investigated, and speculated that ADM, which spends millions of dollars on lobbying regardless, used the property sale as a bribe for favorable treatment.

Perdue&#x27;s assets during his time as Secretary were placed in blind trusts, as is common to prevent financial conflicts of interest. The complex arrangements were criticized as breaking the spirit of the rule, however, and that Perdue and his family&#x27;s ties to his corporation were not distanced as much as the law intended. AGrowStar (including the assets acquired as part of the Estill deal) was sold by Perdue&#x27;s trusts in 2018 for 12 million dollars, but due to the secretive nature of the trusts, this was not widely disclosed.

Regardless of whether the deal was intended to influence Perdue&#x27;s actions, and if it was if it actually had any impact, the Perdue years were good ones for ADM. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; detailed several wish-list items that ADM achieved: loosening of regulations on pork production, fewer inspections, helping lobby against proposed government bans on glyphosate by Thailand and Vietnam, and promoting ethanol and biodiesel.

Perdue currently makes an annual salary of $523,900 serving as Chancellor of the University System of Georgia. 

==Personal life==
Perdue and his wife, Mary (née Ruff), were married in 1972 after dating for four years. They have four children (Leigh, Lara, Jim, and Dan), 14 grandchildren (six boys and eight girls), and have also been foster parents for many children. Perdue lives in Bonaire, Georgia.

Perdue is an avid sportsman. He enjoys flying and, in a 2003 incident, was accused of flying a state helicopter without a license.

In 2006, while still governor, Perdue made a cameo appearance as the coach of the East Carolina Pirates football team in the movie &quot;We Are Marshall&quot;, large portions of which were filmed in Georgia.

In 2006, Perdue&#x27;s financial disclosure forms revealed that he had a net worth of approximately $6 million and received compensation of $700,000 that year.

<doc id="339826" wikidata="Q538331" url="?curid=339826" title="Brad Henry">
<text>Charles Bradford Henry (born July 10, 1963) is an American lawyer and politician who served as the 26th governor of Oklahoma from 2003 to 2011. A Democrat, he previously served in the Oklahoma Senate from 1992 to 2003.

Henry was elected governor in 2002 with 43.2% of the vote and reelected for a second term in 2006 with 66.5% of the vote. He was the third governor and second Democrat in Oklahoma history to serve two consecutive terms, along with Democrat George Nigh and Republican Frank Keating. Henry was unable to seek a third term in the 2010 election due to term limits set by the Oklahoma Constitution. He was succeeded as governor by Republican former Lieutenant Governor and former U.S. Representative Mary Fallin on January 10, 2011.

Henry had been mentioned as a possible candidate for the U.S. Senate, but declined to run in the 2014 special election to replace Tom Coburn.

As of 2024, Henry is the last Democrat to serve as and/or be elected Governor of Oklahoma.

==Early life and education==
Brad Henry was born in Shawnee, Oklahoma, the son of Charles Henry, a prominent judge and former state representative. After graduating from Shawnee High School in 1981, Henry attended the University of Oklahoma as a President&#x27;s Leadership Scholar and earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in economics in 1985. He was a member of Delta Tau Delta fraternity. In 1988, he was awarded his J.D. degree from the University of Oklahoma College of Law, where he served as managing editor of the Law Review.

Henry practiced law in Shawnee, Oklahoma before running for the Oklahoma State Senate. He served as a state senator from 1992 until he became governor.

==Gubernatorial campaigns==
===2002===
In the 2002 election for governor, Henry defeated State Senator Enoch Kelly Haney and businessman Vince Orza in the primary election. In the general election, he defeated former Republican Congressman Steve Largent, an NFL Hall of Famer, by just over one-half of one percent of the vote, in a race that also included Independent candidate Gary Richardson, a retired federal prosecutor. Henry received 448,143 votes (43.27%) to Largent&#x27;s 441,277 votes (42.61%). Richardson, a former Republican candidate, received 146,200 votes (14%).

Henry ran a campaign of &quot;barnstorming&quot; rural areas, and stopping at Wal-Mart stores in an RV with supporters. Henry was endorsed by football coach Barry Switzer, who has widespread popularity in Oklahoma and accompanied Henry to many campaign events.

On the policy side of the campaign, Henry branded himself as the &quot;education governor.&quot; He argued for increasing teachers&#x27; salaries and funding for higher education in the state by approving a state lottery to raise money.

===2006===
In the Democratic Party primary election on July 25, 2006, Henry received 218,712 votes, 86% of the vote.

In the November 7 general election, Henry faced Fifth District U.S. Congressman Republican Ernest Istook and won with 66% of the vote. He won with a higher total than any gubernatorial candidate in almost fifty years. He only lost the three counties of the Panhandle, and won by large margins in a number of counties that normally vote Republican.

==Governor of Oklahoma==
Henry was sworn in as Oklahoma&#x27;s 26th governor on January 13, 2003, with the oath of office being administered by his cousin, federal appeals court judge Robert Harlan Henry. As governor, he was a member of the National Governors Association, the Southern Governors&#x27; Association, and the Democratic Governors Association. He was the president of the Council of State Governments in 2007.

Henry was generally seen as a moderate Democrat. Henry is pro-choice and has vetoed legislation to mandate ultrasound viewings prior to abortion procedures. He has a mixed view of racial affirmative action, supporting it in college and graduate schools, but not in hiring for the bureaucracy. Henry supports expanding public healthcare and holding HMOs accountable for poor care; however, he also is in favor of upholding the death penalty and is against gun control. The governor supports tax cuts for the lower and middle classes and believes in keeping the income tax; he also supports using the &quot;War on Drugs&quot; strategy to combat methamphetamine use within his state.

Henry made national headlines by giving sanctuary from the controversial redistricting warrant to Texas Democrats in that state&#x27;s legislature by allowing them to travel across state lines into Oklahoma en masse to deny a quorum for voting on a redistricting plan. &quot;Our position is that, without a warrant signed by a judge, we have no authority. Even under those circumstances, we are hesitant to get pulled into a Texas political battle. If we&#x27;re going to do battle with Texas, we prefer that it be on the football field,&quot; Henry said through his spokesman.

On May 27, 2004, Governor Brad Henry issued Executive Order 04-21, which created the Governor&#x27;s Ethnic American Advisory Council. The Ethnic American Advisory Council then published an English translation of the Quran embossed with the Oklahoma State seal which was then distributed to 149 Oklahoma state legislators. There were 35 lawmakers who declined to accept the copy of the Quran that they were offered. After refusing the copy of the Quran, Republican State Representative Rex Duncan wrote a letter to his colleagues explaining, &quot;Most Oklahomans do not endorse the idea of killing innocent women and children in the name of ideology.&quot;

In 2003, Henry signed bills into law that: made downloading child pornography a crime, strengthened the financial oversight of HMOs by the state, created a $300,000 cap on noneconomic damages for obstetric and emergency room cases except in wrongful death cases or if negligence is shown and made other changes to regulate medical liability actions, penalized predatory lending, authorized payday lending, and placed a moratorium on the sale of water from a sole source aquifer. He also was a strong supporter of a ballot proposal to establish a statewide lottery to benefit schools.

In 2004, he signed a bill into law that set out a total of $2,100 in across-the-board salary increases for state employees, public school teachers and state troopers. He also signed legislation to limit the sale of pseudoephedrine used to make crystal meth.

In 2008, he vetoed an anti-abortion measure which required, among other things, women to get an ultrasound before having an abortion. The veto was overridden and was the first override in Oklahoma since 1994, when Gov. David Walters was in office. That law was struck down by a state district court, but passed again in April 2010, whereupon Henry again vetoed it. His veto was again overridden. However, that same year, Henry signed legislation that would prevent women from getting abortions based on the gender of the fetus, require that only qualified physicians administer mifepristone and protect employees who refuse to participate in abortions.

Despite high job approval ratings and avoidance of controversy, Oklahoma voters approved a term limit holding the governor to a total length of time of eight years in office. The law already provided for a term limit of two consecutive terms for the governor. This effectively prohibited Henry, then 47, from making a comeback attempt at a later date.

===Oklahoma Supreme Court appointments===
Governor Henry appointed the following Justices to the Oklahoma Supreme Court:

* James E. Edmondson2003
* Steven W. Taylor2004
* Tom Colbert2004, making Henry the first governor to appoint an African American justice to the Court.
* John F. Reif2007
* Doug Combs2010
* Noma Gurich2010

===Budget proposals===
Governor Henry submitted the following budgets to the Oklahoma Legislature:
2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011.

==Post-gubernatorial career==
Henry was seen as a candidate for President of the University of Central Oklahoma. However, the state&#x27;s largest newspapers, The Daily Oklahoman and The Tulsa World, both editorialized against the appointment of Henry as UCO president by the UCO Board of Regents, which was appointed by Henry. Another candidate, Don Betz, was named to the position. Henry was considered a likely choice to be Dean of the Oklahoma City University School of Law. However, U.S. Federal Magistrate Valerie Couch was appointed. As governor, Henry appointed 5 members of the Oklahoma Supreme Court and delivered the 2010 commencement address at the OCU School of Law.

In 2013, supporters had asked Henry to run in the 2014 elections against incumbent Republican governor Mary Fallin, but he declined. However, Henry said the term limit initiative voters passed didn&#x27;t apply to him as he had already been term limited by the State Constitution before the proposition was approved. Henry was considered a contender for the 2014 U.S. Senate Special Election, but ultimately did not run. He would also be sought out for the election for a full term 2 years later, but again, was not a candidate.

On June 8, 2016, Henry joined the law firm Spencer Fane.

<doc id="339827" wikidata="Q332247" url="?curid=339827" title="Steve Largent">
<text>Stephen Michael Largent (born September 28, 1954) is an American former professional football wide receiver and politician who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 14 seasons with the Seattle Seahawks. A member of the Republican Party, he served in the U.S. House of Representatives for Oklahoma&#x27;s 1st congressional district from 1994 to 2002. He was also the Republican nominee in the 2002 Oklahoma gubernatorial election.

Largent played college football at Tulsa University, where he studied biology, and began his NFL career with the expansion Seahawks in 1976. Regarded as one of the greatest wide receivers of all time, he held all major NFL receiving records at the time of his retirement. Largent was inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1995.

Following his playing career, Largent was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1994 and served four terms, winning over 60% of the vote in each election. He resigned from his seat in 2002 to run for governor of Oklahoma, which he narrowly lost to Democratic state senator Brad Henry.

==Football career==
In 1974 at the University of Tulsa, Largent had 884 yards receiving and 14 touchdown catches. In 1975, he had 51 catches for 1,000 yards and 14 touchdowns.

Despite an All-American career at Tulsa, Largent was not selected until the fourth round of the 1976 NFL draft by the Houston Oilers with the 117th pick. After four preseason games, he was slated to be cut. According to Largent, Bum Phillips called him into his office and told Largent he had all the receivers they needed, and that Houston would be releasing him. Largent feared his career was over before it began.

However, his college offensive coordinator, Jerry Rhome, was now the quarterbacks and receivers coach of the expansion Seattle Seahawks. Rhome convinced head coach Jack Patera to trade a 1977 eighth-round draft pick for Largent. His first practice with the team went horribly, as he was suffering from nine days of sleep deprivation while financially struggling to care for his mother and three younger brothers after their mother left her alcoholic and violent second husband. Despite this unpromising start, he made the roster of the expansion team&#x27;s first season. 

Largent spent his entire 14-year career with the Seahawks. While not particularly fast, he was extremely sure-handed and able to get open due to his precise route-running. Between 1976 and 1981, he and quarterback Jim Zorn—a fellow rookie in 1976—had more completions and yardage than any other pair in the league. He became the first Seahawk selected to the Pro Bowl, in 1978, and was selected six more times during his career. In 1979 he led the league in receiving yards with 1,237, and six years later did it again with 1,287 in 1985. His 1985 receiving yardage was a Seahawks franchise record that stood for 35 years until broken by DK Metcalf in 2020.

In 1987, Largent returned to play in a game against the Detroit Lions just before the end of the National Football League Players Association strike. Facing replacement players, he amassed 15 catches for 261 yards and three touchdowns. With the retirement of Charlie Joiner the previous year, Largent became the NFL&#x27;s active leader in career receiving yards, retaining that lead until his retirement in 1989. He broke Joiner&#x27;s all-time record for receiving yards (12,146) in week 3 of 1988. 

In the same season, he was knocked unconscious and suffered a concussion and two cracked teeth when he was hit in the head with a forearm by Mike Harden of the Denver Broncos; Harden was fined $5000 by the league. Fourteen weeks later, in a rematch, Harden intercepted Dave Krieg&#x27;s pass in the end zone, but Largent raced over and inflicted a blindside hit that caused Harden to fall to the ground and fumble the ball, which Largent then recovered; the play was negated by a defensive penalty, but Largent had gotten his revenge.

In 1989, Largent became the first Seahawks player to win the Steve Largent Award for his spirit, dedication, and integrity.

During his playing career, Largent was given the nickname &quot;Yoda&quot; for his ability to catch anything thrown at him. He attributed this ability to a skeet shooting buddy, a sport that focuses only on the edge of the skeet, as he only focused on the tip of the ball to track and catch balls, in the era where receivers and defensive backs did not wear gloves. This also allowed him to quickly adjust from catching balls thrown by left-handed Jim Zorn to right-handed Dave Krieg.

When Largent retired, he held all major NFL receiving records, including most receptions in a career (819), most receiving yards in a career (13,089), and most touchdown receptions (100). He also had a then-record streak of 177 consecutive regular-season games with a reception. He also holds the distinction as the first receiver in NFL history to grab 100 touchdown receptions in his career; his record stood until 1992 when it was broken by Jerry Rice. Largent was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1995, his first year of eligibility. In 1999, he was ranked number 46 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot; list of the 100 Greatest Football Players, the only Seahawk to make the list. His #80 was retired in 1992; Largent is the first Seahawk player to be so honored. During Jerry Rice&#x27;s stint with the Seahawks in 2004, Largent&#x27;s #80 was temporarily &quot;unretired&quot; after a conversation between Rice (who idolized Largent growing up) and Largent that was reportedly initiated by then Seahawks president Bob Whitsitt. Largent remains the most prolific receiver in team history. On October 26, 2008, Largent&#x27;s University of Tulsa #83 was also retired.

==Political career==
=== Tenure in Congress ===
In 1994, Oklahoma&#x27;s 1st District Congressman Jim Inhofe resigned to run in a special election to succeed Senator David Boren. Largent won the election to succeed Inhofe in Congress; pursuant to an Oklahoma statute, Governor David Walters designated the special election in which Largent was elected to serve the remainder of Inhofe&#x27;s term in the 103rd Congress before beginning his term in the 104th Congress.

Largent took office on November 29, 1994, and was reelected to the three succeeding Congresses, never winning less than 60 percent of the vote in the heavily Republican Tulsa-based district.

Like many in the Republican freshman class elected in 1994, when the Republicans took control of the House for the first time in 40 years, Largent&#x27;s voting record was solidly conservative. Largent was one of the &quot;true believers&quot; in that freshman class, devoting most of his time to issues important to conservative Christians.

One of his first bills was a &quot;parental rights&quot; bill that died in committee after it attracted opposition even from other Christian conservatives. Another of his bills would have abolished the federal tax code at the end of 2001. He opposed ending the 1995 federal government shutdown and played a role in the failed attempt to oust Newt Gingrich as Speaker. Largent introduced a bill that would ban adoptions by gay and lesbian parents in Washington, D. C. Before taking office, in 1993, Largent wrote a letter in which he said &quot;many homosexual practices are immoral and downright repugnant&quot;.

He was accused of being anti-Catholic due to his line of questioning of a House of Representatives chaplain in 2000, though he denied this.

After the Republicans lost five seats in the 1998 midterm elections, Largent tried to take advantage of discontent with Majority Leader Dick Armey by challenging Armey for the post. Although Armey was not popular in the Republican caucus, Largent was thought to be far too conservative for the liking of some moderate Republicans, and Armey won on the third ballot. However, when Bob Livingston of Louisiana stood down as Speaker-elect, Armey was still too wounded to make a bid for the job.

=== Run for governor ===
Largent decided to run for governor of Oklahoma in 2002. He easily won the Republican nomination and resigned his House seat on February 15 to devote his energy to the race. Initially seen as an overwhelming favorite against Democratic state senator Brad Henry, Largent lost by just under 7,000 votes.

Largent&#x27;s loss has been attributed by analysts to factors that included:
* The presence of a well-funded independent (Gary Richardson, a former Republican) on the general election ballot;
* Henry&#x27;s support of cockfighting, garnering a last minute endorsement by rural cockfighting interests that turned out in large numbers in the election in which the legality of cockfighting was on the ballot;
* Largent used a vulgarity, &quot;bullshit,&quot; in response to an Oklahoma City television reporter who repeatedly asked where he was at the time of the September 11, 2001 attacks. Largent had been on a hunting trip and did not know about the attacks until then.

==Post-political career==
Largent became president and CEO of CTIA-The Wireless Association in November 2003 and served until May 2014. CTIA is an international nonprofit membership organization founded in 1984, representing all sectors of wireless communications: cellular, personal communication services, and enhanced specialized mobile radio.

==Personal life==
In 1990, Largent received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

&quot;People&quot; magazine named Largent to its 1996 list of &quot;Most Beautiful People&quot;.

Largent has a son Kramer James (b. November 11, 1985) with spina bifida. He and his wife, Terry, also had three older children, sons Kyle and Kelly and daughter Casie.

<text>Verve Records is an active American record label owned by Universal Music Group (UMG). Founded in 1956 by Norman Granz, the label is home to the world&#x27;s largest jazz catalogue, which includes recordings by artists such as Ella Fitzgerald, Cal Tjader, Nina Simone, Stan Getz, Bill Evans, Billie Holiday, Oscar Peterson, Jon Batiste, and Diana Krall among others as well as a diverse mix of other recordings that fall outside of jazz including albums from disparate artists like the Velvet Underground, Kurt Vile, Arooj Aftab, Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention and many more. It absorbed the catalogues of Granz&#x27;s earlier label, Clef Records, founded in 1946; Norgran Records, founded in 1953; and material which was previously licensed to Mercury Records.

The label has continued to be the home to an eclectic mix of modern artists, including Kurt Vile, Everything But the Girl, Samara Joy and Arooj Aftab. The restructured Verve Records is now part of the Verve Label Group (VLG), a subsidiary of Universal Music Group. This company is also home to historic imprints including Verve Forecast, Impulse! and Decca Records.

==History==
Norman Granz created Verve to produce new recordings by Ella Fitzgerald, whom he managed; the first album the label released was &quot;Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Cole Porter Song Book&quot;. The catalog grew throughout the 1950s and 1960s to include Charlie Parker, Bill Evans, Stan Getz, Billie Holiday, Oscar Peterson, Ben Webster, and Lester Young.

By 1960 Milton Rudin, Granz&#x27; attorney, represented Frank Sinatra and knew that Sinatra wanted his own label. Sinatra and Granz made a handshake deal, but negotiations broke down over price and Sinatra&#x27;s desire that Granz remain head of the label. Granz sold Verve to MGM in 1960. Sinatra established Reprise Records and hired Mo Ostin, an executive at Verve, to run it. At Verve, Creed Taylor was made head producer. Taylor adopted a more commercial approach, terminating several contracts. He brought bossa nova to America with the release of &quot;Jazz Samba&quot; by Stan Getz and Charlie Byrd, &quot;Getz/Gilberto&quot;, and &quot;Rain Forest&quot; by Walter Wanderley. Verve&#x27;s arrangers included Claus Ogerman and Oliver Nelson. According to Ogerman in &quot;Jazzletter&quot;, he arranged 60–70 albums for Verve from 1963 to 1967.

In 1964, Taylor supervised the creation of a folk music subsidiary named Verve Folkways which was later renamed Verve Forecast. Taylor left Verve in 1967 to form CTI Records. Aside from jazz, Verve&#x27;s catalogue included the Righteous Brothers, the Velvet Underground, Frank Zappa &amp; the Mothers of Invention, Rare Earth, and the Blues Project, as well as a series of &quot;Sound Impressions of an American on Tour&quot; records which was produced in cooperation with &quot;Esquire&quot; Magazine.

The late 1960s relationship between Verve and other MGM labels is illustrated in the promotional &quot;Music Factory&quot; radio series for college stations hosted by A&amp;R man Tom Wilson (record producer), with studio guests from a variety of MGM labels: Janis Ian, Dave Van Ronk, Richie Havens, the Cowsills, Lovin&#x27; Spoonful and more. Meanwhile, the program&#x27;s conversations and advertisements pitched everything from Nico and the Velvet Underground (produced by Wilson) and the Bosstown Sound bands (Beacon Street Union, Ultimate Spinach and Orpheus), to MGM movie-soundtrack LPs like &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;.

While the Velvet Underground&#x27;s first records did not initially sell well, the band became a major influence in independent rock music. See &quot;The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico&quot; and their second album, &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot;.

In the 1970s, Verve became part of PolyGram, incorporating the Mercury/EmArcy jazz catalog, which Philips, part owners of PolyGram had earlier acquired. Verve Records became the Verve Music Group after PolyGram was merged with Seagram&#x27;s Universal Music Group in 1999. The jazz holdings from the merged companies were folded into this sub-group.

In 1990, British group Talk Talk signed to Polydor after conflicts with their previous label EMI regarding a lack of commercial allure on their fourth album, &quot;Spirit of Eden&quot;. Their fifth and final album, &quot;Laughing Stock&quot;, was released through Verve on September 16, 1991 and, while being slightly divisive at the time, has since been reconsidered by critics and fans as their masterpiece and a precursor to the post-rock movement.

In the 1990s, as part of PolyGram Classics and Jazz, Verve signed Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Joe Henderson, Roy Hargrove, John Scofield, Shirley Horn, Betty Carter, Abbey Lincoln, Chris Botti, Jeff Lorber, Gino Vannelli, Art Porter, Will Downing, and Incognito.

When Universal and Polygram merged in 1998, Verve&#x27;s holdings were merged with Universal&#x27;s GRP Recording Company to become Verve Music Group. Verve was corporately aligned with Universal Music Enterprises (UMe) in 2006 and was no longer a stand-alone label within UMG during that time.

Under this regime, led by UMe&#x27;s President, Bruce Resnikoff, Verve won the Grammy for album of the year, the first time a jazz record had garnered this award since another Verve album, Stan Getz&#x27;s Getz/Gilberto, won in 1965.

Verve Records went through several other leadership changes in the aughts (including stints by Danny Bennett and David Foster) before Jamie Krents took over with a revamped label team in 2019. Notable moments during this period include the signing of Jon Batiste, Samara Joy, Kurt Vile and Arooj Aftab. Verve has had particularly strong showings at the Grammy&#x27;s since 2019 with Jon Batiste leading the music industry in 2022 with 11 nominations and 5 wins, including album of the year, as well as a win for Aftab in Best Global Performance, and Samara Joy winning Best New Artist in 2023, a first in the label&#x27;s 67-year history.

The Verve imprint itself manages much of the jazz catalog that once belonged to PolyGram (not including recordings by Herb Alpert for his A&amp;M Records label which Alpert acquired in a legal settlement with Universal Music and are licensed to Shout! Factory), while the Impulse! Records imprint manages the portion of Universal&#x27;s catalog that was acquired from ABC Records, which itself includes the jazz catalog of the Famous Music Group, which was once owned by Paramount Pictures/Gulf+Western, but which was sold to ABC in 1974. Meanwhile, GRP manages the rest of MCA/Universal&#x27;s jazz catalog, including some releases once issued on the Decca and Chess labels.

==Verve Label Group==
The Verve Label Group is the American contemporary, classic and jazz division of Universal Music Group in the US. Labels in the group include Verve and Impulse! Records labels and Universal Music Classics. Verve labels are Verve Records and Verve Forecast. 
Universal Music Classical consists of Decca Gold label plus represents the European imprints Decca Records, Decca Classics, Deutsche Grammophon, Philips Classics and Mercury KX plus ECM Records distributed label.

On May 20, 2016, the newly-formed Verve Label Group appointed industry veteran Danny Bennett as its president and CEO. Besides Verve, the label group was formed with Decca Records, Decca Classics, Deutsche Grammophon, Mercury Classics, and distributed label ECM. The group relocated to New York City.

The label group in March 2019 was further restructured to its global classical and jazz unit. Dickon Stainer, President and CEO of Universal Classics and Jazz, would lead the group with Bennett exiting his post. The Decca Broadway label for original cast recording was relaunched in May 2019.

The Verve Label Group has expanded its output beyond jazz to include crossover classical music, progressive pop, and show tunes (by absorbing Decca Records&#x27; Broadway label and taking over ownership of the label&#x27;s library including EMI&#x27;s, MGM Records&#x27;, and MCA Records&#x27; musical theater catalogs).

<text>James Edward Doyle Jr. (born November 23, 1945) is an American attorney and politician who served as the 44th governor of Wisconsin from 2003 to 2011. In his first election to the governorship, he narrowly defeated incumbent Republican governor Scott McCallum. Although in 2002 Democrats increased their number of governorships, Doyle was the only one of them to unseat a Republican. 

Prior to the governorship, Doyle served as Wisconsin Attorney General from 1991 to 2003. He is currently an attorney &#x27;of counsel&#x27; in the Madison, Wisconsin office of the law firm of Foley &amp; Lardner and serves on the corporate board of Epic Systems and Exact Sciences.

==Early life and education==
Jim Doyle was born on November 23, 1945, in Washington, D.C., the son of Ruth Bachhuber Doyle and James Edward Doyle, who were influential leaders of the post-1946 Democratic Party of Wisconsin. Doyle Sr. ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1954 and was appointed as a federal judge in 1965. Ruth Bachhuber Doyle was the first woman from Dane County to be elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly in 1948.

Doyle, who graduated from Madison West High School in 1963, attended Stanford University for three years, then returned home to Madison to finish his senior year at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. After graduating from college and inspired by John F. Kennedy&#x27;s call to public service, Doyle worked as a teacher with his wife, Jessica Doyle in Tunisia as part of the Peace Corps from 1967 to 1969.

In 1972, Doyle earned his Juris Doctor from Harvard Law School. He then moved to the Navajo Indian Reservation in Chinle, Arizona, where he worked as an attorney in a federal legal services office.

==Early political career==
In 1975, Doyle returned to Madison, Wisconsin, and served three terms as Dane County District Attorney, from 1977 to 1982. After leaving that office, he spent eight years in private practice. Doyle was elected Wisconsin Attorney General in 1990, and reelected in 1994 and 1998. Between 1997 and 1998, he served as the president of the National Association of Attorneys General. During his twelve years as attorney general, Doyle was considered tough on crime, but not unsympathetic to its causes. He also gained recognition as a result of several successful lawsuits against tobacco companies in the state.

==Campaigns for governor==

===2002 gubernatorial election===
Doyle ran against Republican Scott McCallum, the former lieutenant governor who had assumed the office of governor in 2001 after Tommy Thompson left to become Secretary of Health and Human Services in the Bush administration.

The 2002 governor&#x27;s race is considered by some to have been the most negative campaign in the state&#x27;s history. In response, Libertarian Ed Thompson (brother of Tommy), publicly critical of the negative campaigning of both major party candidates, who became a more viable option for some voters, garnered 10% of the vote.

On election day, Doyle defeated McCallum by over four percent of the vote, becoming the first Democratic governor in the state since Anthony Earl was defeated in 1986. Doyle was sworn in on January 6, 2003 at the State Capitol in Madison.

===2006 gubernatorial election===
Doyle defeated Republican Congressman Mark Green in 2006. Doyle topped Green 53% to 45% in a year in which no incumbent Democratic governor, senator, or congressman lost their reelection bid.

During the campaign, Doyle was dogged by charges that Georgia Thompson, a state employee, had steered a travel agency contract to a firm whose principals had donated $20,000 to his campaign. Thompson was convicted in federal court in late 2006 and sentenced to 18 months in prison. The conviction was reversed by the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in April 2007, with one judge calling the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s case &quot;beyond thin&quot;.

===Retirement===

Doyle raised about $500,000 for a campaign fund in the first half of 2007, leading political analysts to think he would have been financially ready to run for a third term as governor. In a speech to the state Democratic Party convention on July 6, 2007, he said, &quot;And at the end of these four years of working together, who knows, maybe we&#x27;ll need four more.&quot; He had changed his campaign website to JimDoyle2010.com, which had been seen a further indication of a re-election run. However, on August 17, 2009, Doyle announced that he would not seek a third term.

==Governor of Wisconsin==
Upon Doyle&#x27;s taking office, Wisconsin faced a $3.2 billion deficit. The state ended the year 2003 with a deficit of $2.15 billion. Proposals for new programs were constrained by continued budget-cutting and his decision to honor a campaign pledge to not raise taxes. Facing political pressure, he signed a property tax freeze that has resulted in an anticipated decrease in average statewide property taxes in 2003. Doyle&#x27;s stated priorities were investing in public schools, including the University of Wisconsin System; lowering property taxes; regional economic development; transportation reform; and funding of stem cell research.
On January 2, 2009, Doyle joined the governors of four states in urging the federal government to provide $1 trillion in aid to the country&#x27;s 50 state governments to help pay for education, welfare and infrastructure as states struggled with steep budget deficits amid a deepening recession.

On May 19, 2009, Doyle proposed a 75-cent-per-pack increase in the cigarette tax, an &quot;assessment&quot; against oil companies to help pay for road improvements, imposition of sales tax on music downloads and cell phone ringtones, and a 1 percent hike in the state income tax for individuals earning above $300,000 a year (approximately 1 percent of the state&#x27;s population).

Doyle served as chair of the Midwestern Governors Association in 2007.

In October 2007, the Republican-led Assembly, Democratic-controlled Senate, and Governor Doyle passed a balanced budget that approved transferring $200 million from a medical malpractice fund to the Medical assistance trust fund. In July 2010, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled that the transfer was illegal and that the state must restore the money to the malpractice fund.

== Personal life and family ==
Jim Doyle is a fifth generation state officeholder in Wisconsin. His mother, Ruth Bachhuber Doyle, represented Dane County in the Wisconsin State Assembly in the 1940s; his maternal grandfather, Frank E. Bachhuber, represented Marathon County in the Assembly in the 1930s; his great-grandfather and great-great-grandfather, Andrew Bachhuber and Max Bachhuber, represented Dodge County in the Assembly in the 19th century.

Doyle is married to Jessica Laird Doyle, niece of former Congressman Melvin Laird, and great-granddaughter of William D. Connor, who was lieutenant governor of Wisconsin from 1907–1909, and great-great-granddaughter of Wisconsin State Representative Robert Connor. They have two adopted sons, Gus and Gabe, a daughter-in-law, Carrie, a grandson, Asiah, and granddaughters Lily and Lucy.

<doc id="339831" wikidata="Q7237" url="?curid=339831" title="Emperor Ai of Han">
<text>Emperor Ai of Han, personal name Liu Xin (劉欣; 25 BC – 15 August 1 BC), was an emperor of China&#x27;s Han dynasty. He ascended the throne when he was 20, having been made heir by his childless uncle Emperor Cheng, and he reigned from 7 to 1 BC.

The people and the officials were initially excited about his ascension, as he was viewed by them (as well as Emperor Cheng) to be intelligent, articulate, and capable. However, under Emperor Ai, corruption became even more prevalent and heavy taxes were levied on the people. Furthermore, Emperor Ai was highly controlled by his grandmother Consort Fu (consort of his grandfather and his predecessor&#x27;s father Emperor Yuan), who demanded the title of Grand Empress Dowager—even though she had never been an empress previously and therefore did not properly hold that title, and this led to the unprecedented and unrepeated situation of four women possessing empress dowager titles at the same time—Empress Wang Zhengjun (Emperor Cheng&#x27;s mother and Emperor Yuan&#x27;s wife), Empress Zhao Feiyan (Emperor Cheng&#x27;s wife), Consort Fu, and Consort Ding (Emperor Ai&#x27;s mother). Consort Fu&#x27;s control of the political scene extended until her death in February 2 BC. 

During Emperor Ai&#x27;s reign, he also stripped the Wang clan (Empress Wang&#x27;s clan), which had been powerful during Emperor Cheng&#x27;s reign, of much of their power, and substituted members of the Fu and Ding clans in their stead (which, ironically, caused the people, who were not enamored with the Wangs initially, to long for their return to power, as they associated the departure of the Wangs from power with Emperor Ai&#x27;s incompetence in administration). 

In an unpopular act, Emperor Ai had his prime minister Wang Jia (王嘉, unrelated to the Wang clan mentioned above) put to death for criticizing him, an act that made him appear tyrannical. Emperor Ai&#x27;s shortcomings quickly led to the demoralization of the people towards the government and the acquisition of power by Wang Mang, in a backlash, after Ai died in 1 BC.

Many regarded Emperor Ai as the most effusive homosexual emperor of the Han dynasty, although the Han Dynasty included many emperors that had male lovers. Traditional historians characterized the relationship between Emperor Ai and Dong Xian as one between homosexual lovers and referred to their relationship as &quot;the passion of the cut sleeve&quot; (斷袖之癖) after a story that one afternoon after falling asleep for a nap on the same bed, Emperor Ai cut off his sleeve rather than disturb the sleeping Dong Xian when he had to get out of bed. During Emperor Ai&#x27;s reign, officials became aware of the promises tied to his favoritism, beginning to dress in a highly ornate fashion. Ironically, Dong was noted for his relative simplicity in contrast and given progressively higher and higher posts as part of the relationship, eventually becoming the supreme commander of the armed forces by the time of Emperor Ai&#x27;s death. Dong was afterward forced to die by suicide.

Emperor Ai also became an influential figure in a Chinese historical anthology called Duanxiupian (断袖篇) focusing on homosexuality in ancient China. Additionally, Emperor Ai is an important figure in Chinese pop culture, especially in online Dan Mei pieces. Online literature referring to him have been emerging on websites such as 晋江文学城 (Jinjiang Wenxuecheng; JinJiang Literature City). 

==Family background and early life as the Prince of Dingtao==
Emperor Ai was born to Liu Kang (劉康), Prince of Dingtao, a brother of then-reigning Emperor Cheng and son of Emperor Yuan, and his concubine Consort Ding, in 25 BC, presumably at Prince Kang&#x27;s principality (roughly modern Heze, Shandong). From birth, he was raised by his paternal grandmother, the domineering Consort Fu, and not by his mother. Prince Kang died in September or October 23 BC, and the two-year-old Prince Xin became the Prince of Dingtao.

In 9 BC, the then-18-year-old Prince Xin impressed his uncle Emperor Cheng when on an official visit to the capital Chang&#x27;an, when he brought three key officials of his principality—his teacher, his prime minister, and the commander of his capital&#x27;s defense forces—to accompany him and cited the proper legal regulations that, in his opinion, required and allowed him to bring them with him (even though it was customary that princes would bring only their teachers). He also showed clear understanding of the Confucian classic &quot;Shi Jing&quot;, further impressing Emperor Cheng. At that time, the sonless Emperor Cheng was beginning to consider making either his younger brother Liu Xing, Prince of Zhongshan (中山王劉興) or his nephew Prince Xin his heir. Emperor Cheng became convinced that Prince Xin was more capable, and at the same time, Prince Xin&#x27;s grandmother Consort Fu was endearing herself to Emperor Cheng&#x27;s wife Empress Zhao Feiyan, her sister and Emperor Cheng&#x27;s favorite Consort Zhao Hede, and Emperor Cheng&#x27;s uncle Wang Gen with lavish gifts, and so the Zhaos and Wang Gen both praised Prince Xin as well. Emperor Cheng therefore seriously considered making Prince Xin his heir.

In 8 BC, Emperor Cheng summoned several key officials to discuss with him who would be the more proper heir. The majority, perhaps seeing that Emperor Cheng was leaning toward Prince Xin, recommended him, citing the general rule of succession that when one lacked an heir, he should adopt a brother&#x27;s child to be his own son and heir; one official recommended Prince Xing under the rationale that he was closer in bloodline with the emperor. Emperor Cheng, whose mind was fairly made up, created him Crown Prince Xin. In an act praised one as showing humility, Prince Xin declined the honor of living at the crown prince&#x27;s palace, stating that he was only at the capital to serve Emperor Cheng until Emperor Cheng would produce an heir and that he should stay at the Dingtao mission in the capital.

==As crown prince==
Whether Emperor Cheng was formally &quot;adopting&quot; Prince Xin would quickly become a major controversy. Emperor Cheng viewed his recognition of Prince Xin as crown prince as formal adoption, and he believed that Prince Xin was now his son, no longer Prince Kang&#x27;s. When he created a cousin to be the new Prince of Dingtao to serve as Prince Kang&#x27;s heir in December 8 BC, Prince Xin, grateful that his father would continue to be worshipped as an ancestor, submitted a formal note of thanksgiving—at which Emperor Cheng was highly offended, believing that Prince Xin should not be grateful any more for whatever is done for his birth father.

Emperor Cheng&#x27;s desire to have Prince Xin act as only his son extended to the arena of Prince Xin&#x27;s relationship with his grandmother Consort Fu and his mother Consort Ding. Emperor Cheng decreed that Consort Fu (now princess dowager of Dingtao) and Consort Ding be required to remain in Dingtao and not be allowed to come to Chang&#x27;an to visit Prince Xin. Some time later, Emperor Cheng&#x27;s mother Empress Dowager Wang, not wanting to continue these harsh regulations, decreed that Princess Dowager Fu be allowed to see Prince Xin, under the rationale that she, having raised him, was merely in the role of a wet nurse. Consort Ding, however, would continue to not be allowed to see Prince Xin.

Emperor Cheng died suddenly in April 7 BC, apparently from a stroke (although historians also report the possibility of an overdose of aphrodisiacs given to him by Consort Zhao Hede). Crown Prince Xin ascended the throne as Emperor Ai. Empress Dowager Wang, as his step-grandmother (and &quot;legal&quot; grandmother) became grand empress dowager, and Empress Zhao became empress dowager. He created Consort Fu, the daughter of his grandmother Princess Dowager Fu&#x27;s cousin Fu Yan (傅晏), empress.

==As emperor==
===Early reign—optimism===
Emperor Ai, aged 20 at his ascension, quickly ended Emperor Cheng&#x27;s practice of delegating imperial authorities to his uncles and cousins of the Wang clan and appeared diligent in his rule. He also reduced national expenditure greatly. Both the officials and the people thought that after the reigns of the indecisive Emperor Yuan and the impulsive and lavish spending Emperor Cheng, there would finally be a capable emperor.

In addition, Emperor Ai ordered Liu Xin to compile texts of the &quot;Seven Arts&quot; (Qi Lue), a crucial historical bibliographical work, often referred to as the first systemic compiled text of the genre in Chinese history. 

In 7 BC, under Emperor Ai&#x27;s auspices, a major proposal to reduce involuntary servitude was made by several officials—princes would be limited to 200 servants (it was as many as they like before), marquesses and princesses to 100 servants (it was 200 before), and other nobility and commoners to 30 servants (it was 100 before, and that servants would be set free after a service of three years) . However, after the proposal was leaked, many slave owners pushed to have the proposal tabled, and Emperor Ai only issued a limited version of the proposal—freeing servants over age 50.

===Optimism shattered===
The issue of the roles of Princess Dowager Fu and Consort Ding (and what honor, if any, to posthumously bestow on Emperor Ai&#x27;s biological father Prince Kang), however, would quickly again erupt into a major controversy. Initially, Grand Empress Dowager Wang decreed that Princess Dowager Fu and Consort Ding see him periodically, every 10 days. However, Princess Dowager Fu quickly began to visit her grandson everyday, and she insisted that two things be done: that she receive an empress dowager title, and that her relatives be granted titles, like the Wangs. Grand Empress Dowager Wang, sympathetic of the bind that Emperor Ai was in, first granted Prince Kang the unusual title of &quot;Emperor Gong of Dingtao&quot; (定陶共皇) and then, under the rationale of that title, granted Princess Dowager Fu the title &quot;Empress Dowager Gong of Dingtao&quot; (定陶共皇太后) and Consort Ding the title &quot;Empress Gong of Dingtao&quot; (定陶共皇后). Several members of the Fu and Ding clans were created marquesses. Grand Empress Dowager Wang also ordered her paternal nephew Wang Mang, the commander of the armed forces, to resign and transfer power to the Fus and the Dings. Emperor Ai declined and begged Wang Mang to stay in his administration.

Several months later, however, Wang Mang would come into direct confrontation with now-Empress Dowager Fu. At a major imperial banquet, the official in charge of seating placed Empress Dowager Fu&#x27;s seat next to Grand Empress Dowager Wang&#x27;s. When Wang Mang saw this, he rebuked the official and ordered that Empress Dowager Fu&#x27;s seat be moved to the side, which drew great ire from Empress Dowager Fu, who refused to attend the banquet. To soothe her anger, Wang Mang resigned, and Emperor Ai approved his resignation. After Wang Mang&#x27;s resignation, the Wangs gradually and inexorably began to lose their power. At Empress Dowager Fu&#x27;s behest, the Fus and the Dings were installed in their place.

Empress Dowager Fu was not satisfied with what she saw was her inferior title (as only empress dowager, not grand empress dowager, and with the qualifier &quot;of Dingtao&quot;). Several key officials who opposed her move were reduced to commoner status without any other fault—including the prime minister Kong Guang (孔光) and the prime inspector Shi Dan (師丹)—two of the top three officials of the administration. The third one, Empress Dowager Fu&#x27;s cousin Fu Xi (傅喜), who also opposed Empress Dowager Fu&#x27;s actions notwithstanding his relationship with her, was removed from his position and sent back to his march.

In 6 BCE, Empress Dowager Fu would further display her power and at the same time cause the people to be even more disappointed in Emperor Ai. Emperor Ai&#x27;s cousin Liu Jizi (劉箕子), the Prince of Zhongshan (Prince Xing&#x27;s son), had a congenital heart disorder, and his grandmother Feng Yuan, the princess dowager, cared for his treatment and often worshipped gods to pray for his healing. Emperor Ai, up on hearing his cousin&#x27;s illness, sent imperial physicians along with his attendant Zhang You (張由) to go to Zhongshan (roughly modern Baoding, Hebei) to treat Prince Jizi. Zhang, however, was himself afflicted with a psychiatric condition (probably bipolar disorder), and when he got to Zhongshan, he suddenly, in a rage, left there and returned to Chang&#x27;an. Once he did and was ordered to explain his conduct, he made up a false reason—that he had discovered that Princess Dowager Feng was using witchcraft to curse Emperor Ai and Empress Dowager Fu. Empress Dowager Fu and Princess Dowager Feng were romantic rivals when they were both consorts to Emperor Yuan, and Empress Dowager Fu decided to use this opportunity to strike at Princess Dowager Feng. She sent a loyal eunuch, Shi Li (史立), to serve as investigator, and Shi tortured a good number of Princess Dowager Feng&#x27;s relations (including her sister Feng Xi (馮習) and her sister-in-law Junzhi (君之)), some to death, but still could not build a solid case against Princess Dowager Feng. Shi Li decided to show Princess Dowager Feng who was actually behind the investigation, by referring to an incident in which then-Consort Feng defended Emperor Yuan against a bear which had broken loose. Princess Dowager Feng, realizing that Empress Dowager Fu was behind the investigation, went back to her palace and died by suicide. In total, 17 members of the Feng clan died as a result of the investigations. This was immediately viewed as a political case, and officials and the people all became disappointed in Emperor Ai.

In 5 BC, Empress Dowager Fu would finally get what she wanted. Emperor Ai removed the qualification &quot;of Dingtao&quot; from his father&#x27;s posthumous title (thus making him simply &quot;Emperor Gong&quot;), and then gave his grandmother a variation of the grand empress dowager title (&quot;ditaitaihou&quot; (帝太太后), compared to Grand Empress Dowager Wang&#x27;s title &quot;taihuangtaihou&quot; (太皇太后)) and his mother a variation of the empress dowager title (&quot;ditaihou&quot; (帝太后), compared to Empress Dowager Zhao&#x27;s title &quot;huangtaihou&quot; (皇太后)), and there were therefore now four official empresses dowager in the capital, each with a full budget. That year, the new Empress Dowager Ding died on 9 July.

During these years, other than the palatial infighting, what plagued Emperor Ai&#x27;s administration (not unlike how it plagued his uncle Emperor Cheng&#x27;s administration) was the general situation where good proposals would be made to Emperor Ai, and then he would approve of them personally but not take any actual actions on them. Further, he was harsh in his punishments of officials who disagreed with him—including, but not limited to, the issue of his grandmother and mother&#x27;s titles. He would often backtrack in these punishments as well after some time, which also made him appear indecisive. He would also quickly promote officials that he saw as capable and honest and then, as soon as that capability or honesty offended him in some way, demote them. His temper might have been related to the fact that he was also constantly ill, although the nature of the illness is not known.

===The rise of Dong Xian===
Circa 4 BC, Emperor Ai began to favor the minor official Dong Xian, and historians largely believe that they had a homosexual relationship. Both men were married, but that would not have been seen as conflicting with a homosexual love affair, as it was typical for Chinese men of the time to have multiple sexual relationships. Ai came from a long line of emperors, all married of course, with male companions listed in their official histories.

Ai bestowed honors on Dong at a rate which alarmed the court. Dong and his wife moved into the palace, and Dong&#x27;s sister became an imperial consort. Dong&#x27;s father was made an acting marquess (關內侯). Emperor Ai also ordered that a residence as luxurious as an imperial palace be built for Dong. All who opposed these honors for Dong were severely punished.

In 3 BC, against opposition by his prime minister Wang Jia (王嘉), Emperor Ai created Dong the Marquess of Gao&#x27;an. The following year, the prime minister submitted a report to Emperor Ai, in which he urged that the honors bestowed on Dong be curbed. This report was carefully worded to appear to be looking out for Dong. It warned that Dong might suffer the same fate of Emperor Wen&#x27;s favorite lover Deng Tong (鄧通), who starved to death after his assets were confiscated by Emperor Wen&#x27;s heir, or of Emperor Wu&#x27;s favorite Han Yan (韓嫣), who was executed by Empress Dowager Wang after being accused of improperly assuming imperial style.

Later in 2 BC, when Wang Jia opposed the expansion of Dong&#x27;s march, Emperor Ai had him accused falsely of crimes and forced him to die by suicide through fasting. On January 1 BC, Dong was made the commander of the armed forces—at age 22 (by East Asian reckoning) —and effectively the most powerful official in the administration. Several members of the Dong clan became important court officials as well, displacing the Fus and the Dings after Grand Empress Dowager Fu died in February 2 BC.

==Death==

Emperor Ai died in August 1 BC. It is not clear what the exact cause of death was, but he appeared to succumb to illnesses from which he had always suffered. On his deathbed, Ai ordered that his throne be passed on to Dong Xian, but this was ignored by imperial counselors.

The Grand Empress Dowager acted quickly to seize his seal and to take power back from Dong Xian, reinstating Wang Mang as the regent. Dong Xian and his wife was forced to die by suicide. Emperor Ai would officially be succeeded by his cousin, Prince Jizi, as Emperor Ping, but this was merely a pretext for Wang Mang to seize the throne nine years later. Emperor Ai&#x27;s abuse of power, first influenced by his grandmother and then by his love for Dong, caused the people and the officials to yearn for the return of the Wangs.

<doc id="339832" wikidata="Q351214" url="?curid=339832" title="Scott McCallum">
<text>James Scott McCallum (born May 2, 1950) is an American businessman and former politician. A member of the Republican Party, he was the 43rd governor of Wisconsin, ascending from the Lieutenant Governorship when Tommy Thompson resigned in 2001 to accept appointment as U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services. Prior to becoming Governor, McCallum served 14 years as Thompson&#x27;s Lieutenant Governor and 10 years in the Wisconsin State Senate.

==Early life and education==
James Scott McCallum was born in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, the eldest of four children. His father worked as a construction worker and his mother was a homemaker and bank teller. In 1967, he attended a youth leadership program, Badger Boys State, as a representative chosen from Lowell P. Goodrich High School.

He graduated from Macalester College in 1972 with a degree in economics and political science. He earned his master&#x27;s degree in international economics from Johns Hopkins University in 1974. He earned a PhD from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. He is of the Christian Science religion. McCallum is married to Laurie McCallum; they have three children and reside in Lodi, Wisconsin.

==Political career==

===Early career===
In 1976 at the age of 26, McCallum won a seat in the Wisconsin State Senate, defeating a 20-year incumbent. McCallum won the Republican nomination for the United States Senate in 1982, but lost in the general election to incumbent William Proxmire. During his 10 years (1976–1986) as state senator, McCallum was allied with the New Republican Conference, a now-defunct movement of fiscally conservative, but socially liberal, GOP activists. McCallum&#x27;s legislative accomplishments included increasing penalties for drunk driving offenses and assaults on prison guards; creating a health insurance risk pool for people considered uninsurable; sunsetting outdated legislation; and indexing individual income taxes to account for inflation.

===Lieutenant Governor and Governor of Wisconsin===
In 1986, McCallum ran for lieutenant governor on the Republican ticket with Tommy Thompson, who was running for governor; both candidates won. McCallum chaired the National Council of Lieutenant Governors and was appointed to the Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s advisory council by President George H. W. Bush. The Thompson-McCallum ticket served the state of Wisconsin for 14 years, having been reelected in 1990, 1994 and 1998. In 2001, President George W. Bush appointed Thompson to be Secretary of Health and Human Services. McCallum thus served out the final two years of Thompson&#x27;s fourth term, and appointed State Senator Margaret Farrow of Pewaukee, Wisconsin, to be the state&#x27;s first female lieutenant governor.

As the Wisconsin governor, McCallum was cited by the Wall Street Journal during the economic slowdown in 2001 as being one of the &#x27;political tough guys&#x27; for balancing the budget without raising taxes. As a governor he was commander-in-chief of the Wisconsin National Guard, directing emergency operations following the September 11 attacks, which resulted in his receiving the 2002 U.S. National Guard Award for his work.

In 2001, McCallum launched &quot;Invest Wisconsin,&quot; a new program to focus on the needs of state businesses and communities for investment capital. The public and private partnership was designed to increase awareness of business financing options by engaging statewide networks and professional associations.

As governor he created the Department of Electronic Government and the state&#x27;s first CIO through consolidation of various departments. This action saved $50 million in its first year while expanding service. Today, the department is known as the &quot;Division of Enterprise Technology&quot; of the Wisconsin Department of Administration. Governor McCallum aggressively used the veto pen to cut expenditures throughout his time in office. It was estimated that Wisconsin taxpayers saved $62.9 million through this action. McCallum ran for a full term in 2002, but was defeated in the election by Democratic Attorney General Jim Doyle. The other major party candidate running in 2002 was Libertarian Ed Thompson (brother of Tommy Thompson).

===Post-political career===

After his public sector service, McCallum was president and CEO of Aidmatrix for nine years. The company is a non-profit based in Texas that matches charitable corporate donations of surplus food and supplies with organizations that need them. Currently, Governor McCallum owns and operates The McCallum Group, a consulting firm in the State of Wisconsin.

McCallum was named a senior fellow at the Discovery Institute. He is also an adjunct professor and honorary fellow in the School of Public Health and Medicine at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. McCallum has also taught executive MBA marketing courses at Sun Yat-sen University and Harbin University.

In March 2013, McCallum was named by &quot;Government Technology&quot; magazine as one of the &quot;Top 25 Doers, Dreamers, and Drivers&quot; in US technology. McCallum has also received the 21st Century Achievement Award from &quot;Computerworld&quot;, the Distinguished Citizen Award from Macalester College, and the Ernst and Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award.

McCallum is now an adjunct professor of Public Affairs at the University of Wisconsin-Madison&#x27;s La Follette School of Public Affairs and the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.

<text>Growth Fetish is a book about economics and politics by the Australian progressive political theorist Clive Hamilton. Published in 2003 it became a best-seller in Australia.

The book argues that the policies of unfettered capitalism pursued by the west for the last 50 years has largely failed, since the underlying purpose of the creation of wealth is happiness, and Hamilton claims that people in general are no happier now than 50 years ago, despite the huge increase in personal wealth. Hamilton goes on to claim that the pursuit of growth has become a fetish, pursued at a tremendous cost in terms of the environment, erosion of democracy, and the values of society as a whole.

==Background==
Clive Hamilton is the former executive director of The Australia Institute, an independent think-tank which has been cited as playing a significant role in debate over social and environmental policies. Hamilton resigned from the Australia Institute in 2007. &quot;Growth Fetish&quot; itself reflects many of the findings from TAI&#x27;s report &quot;Overconsumption in Australia&quot;, which found that 62 per cent of Australians believe they cannot afford everything they need, even though in real terms their incomes have never been higher.

==Synopsis==
Hamilton&#x27;s catchphrase &quot;People buy things they don&#x27;t need, with money they don&#x27;t have, to impress people they don&#x27;t like&quot;—an axiom &quot;borrowed&quot; from actor Walter Slezak—sums up his philosophy on consumerism.

Hamilton proposes that where a society has developed to the point at which the majority of people live reasonably comfortably, the pursuit of growth is pointless and should be curtailed. The surplus wealth could then be diverted into the essential infrastructure and to other nations that have not reached this level of wealth. Hamilton adapted the term &quot;Eudemonism&quot; to denote a political and economic model that does not depend on ever increasing and ultimately unsustainable levels of growth, but instead (page 212) &quot;promotes the full realisation of human potential through ... proper appreciation of the sources of wellbeing&quot;, among which he identifies social relationships, job satisfaction, religious belief for some, and above all a sense of meaning and purpose.

Hamilton relates the fetish for growth to a &quot;development mentality&quot;, and to a neoliberal &quot;instrumental value theory [which] maintains that, while humans are valuable in and of themselves, the non-human world is valuable only insofar as it contributes to the well-being of humans&quot; (page 191). To this he contrasts the stance of the &quot;transpersonal ecology&quot; described by Warwick Fox: this is &quot;centred on the notion that only the ego-involved, contracted self can imagine itself to be distinct from the natural world and that expansion of the self beyond the boundaries of the personal necessarily means that one&#x27;s awareness, and ground of concern, extends to the natural world&quot; (page 194).

<text>North Dakota State University (NDSU, formally North Dakota State University of Agriculture and Applied Sciences) is a public land-grant research university in Fargo, North Dakota, United States. It was founded as North Dakota Agricultural College in 1890 as the state&#x27;s land-grant university. As of 2021, NDSU offers 94 undergraduate majors, 146 undergraduate degree programs, 5 undergraduate certificate programs, 84 undergraduate minors, 87 master&#x27;s degree programs, 51 doctoral degree programs of study, and 210 graduate certificate programs. It is classified among &quot;R1-Doctoral Universities – Very High Research Activity&quot;.

NDSU is part of the North Dakota University System. The university also operates North Dakota&#x27;s agricultural research extension centers distributed across the state on . In 2015, NDSU&#x27;s economic impact on the state and region was estimated to be $1.3 billion a year according to the NDUS Systemwide Economic Study by the School of Economics at North Dakota State University. As of 2022, it was also the sixth-largest employer in the state of North Dakota.

==History==

===19th century===
The bill founding North Dakota Agricultural College (NDAC) was signed on March 8, 1890, one year after North Dakota became a state and seven years after initial plans to start an agricultural college in the northern portion of the Dakota Territory. NDAC was established as North Dakota&#x27;s land-grant institution.

On October 15, 1890, Horace E. Stockbridge became the first NDAC president and the board of trustees was formed. Classes were initially held in six classrooms rented from Fargo College. The first class of students were admitted on September 8, 1891. College Hall (Old Main) was completed in 1892 and was the first building on campus.

===20th century===
In 1908, the school&#x27;s alma mater &quot;The Yellow and The Green&quot; was written and a year later the school&#x27;s official colors, Yellow and Green, were selected. In 2015 a change was made where only the first verse of the alma mater is recognized by the university, due to ethnic references in the third stanza.

NDAC continued to grow and was renamed North Dakota State University on November 8, 1960, after a statewide referendum. The name change was to reflect the increasing field of study breadth of the institution.

A area including twelve historic buildings was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as North Dakota State University District in 1986.

===21st century===

Around the start of the 21st century, NDSU began a phase of growth.

NDSU surpassed 10,000 students in the fall of 2000 for the first time, and by the fall semester of 2009, it increased enrollment by another 10% to 14,189 students. Enrollment in 2018 stood at 13,650.

Research, athletic programs, and campus facilities benefited from increases in student enrollment. Between 2000 and 2007, NDSU added a number of undergraduate programs and thirty-one graduate programs. Several buildings have been built or expanded and remodeled over the past seven years, including the Wallman Wellness Center, Memorial Union, and the College of Business.

In 2004, all athletic programs moved to Division I.

In 2023, President David Cook outlined plans to merge two out of the seven colleges into five in an attempt to save $7.6 million. This also resulted in some majors with high program costs and lower enrollment being eliminated. There are plans to create new majors to meet workforce needs for the future.

==Campuses==





North Dakota State University is primarily located in Fargo, North Dakota. NDSU consists of several campuses including: the main campus, NDSU downtown, and several agricultural research extension centers.

<text>Molecular genetics is a branch of biology that addresses how differences in the structures or expression of DNA molecules manifests as variation among organisms. Molecular genetics often applies an &quot;investigative approach&quot; to determine the structure and/or function of genes in an organism&#x27;s genome using genetic screens. 

The field of study is based on the merging of several sub-fields in biology: classical Mendelian inheritance, cellular biology, molecular biology, biochemistry, and biotechnology. It integrates these disciplines to explore things like genetic inheritance, gene regulation and expression, and the molecular mechanism behind various life processes.

A key goal of molecular genetics is to identify and study genetic mutations. Researchers search for mutations in a gene or induce mutations in a gene to link a gene sequence to a specific phenotype. Therefore molecular genetics is a powerful methodology for linking mutations to genetic conditions that may aid the search for treatments of various genetics diseases.

== History ==
The discovery of DNA as the blueprint for life and breakthroughs in molecular genetics research came from the combined works of many scientists. In 1869, chemist Johann Friedrich Miescher, who was researching the composition of white blood cells, discovered and isolated a new molecule that he named nuclein from the cell nucleus, which would ultimately be the first discovery of the molecule DNA that was later determined to be the molecular basis of life. He determined it was composed of hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and phosphorus. Biochemist Albrecht Kossel identified nuclein as a nucleic acid and provided its name deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). He continued to build on that by isolating the basic building blocks of DNA and RNA; made up of the nucleotides: adenine, guanine, thymine, cytosine. and uracil. His work on nucleotides earned him a Nobel Prize in Physiology.

In the early 1800s, Gregor Mendel, who became known as one of the fathers of genetics, made great contributions to the field of genetics through his various experiments with pea plants where he was able to discover the principles of inheritance such as recessive and dominant traits, without knowing what genes where composed of. In the mid 19th century, anatomist Walther Flemming, discovered what we now know as chromosomes and the separation process they undergo through mitosis. His work along with Theodor Boveri first came up with the Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance, which helped explain some of the patterns Mendel had observed much earlier.

For molecular genetics to develop as a discipline, several scientific discoveries were necessary.  The discovery of DNA as a means to transfer the genetic code of life from one cell to another and between generations was essential for identifying the molecule responsible for heredity. Molecular genetics arose initially from studies involving genetic transformation in bacteria. In 1944 Avery, McLeod and McCarthy isolated DNA from a virulent strain of &quot;S. pneumoniae&quot;, and using just this DNA were able to convert a harmless strain to virulence. They called the uptake, incorporation and expression of DNA by bacteria &quot;transformation&quot;. This finding suggested that DNA is the genetic material of bacteria. Bacterial transformation is often induced by conditions of stress, and the function of transformation appears to be repair of genomic damage.

In 1950, Erwin Chargaff derived rules that offered evidence of DNA being the genetic material of life. These were &quot;1) that the base composition of DNA varies between species and 2) in natural DNA molecules, the amount of adenine (A) is equal to the amount of thymine (T), and the amount of guanine (G) is equal to the amount of cytosine (C).&quot; These rules, known as Chargaff&#x27;s rules, helped to understand of molecular genetics. In 1953 Francis Crick and James Watson, building upon the X-ray crystallography work done by Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins, were able to derive the 3-D double helix structure of DNA. 

The phage group was an informal network of biologists centered on Max Delbrück that contributed substantially to molecular genetics and the origins of molecular biology during the period from about 1945 to 1970. The phage group took its name from bacteriophages, the bacteria-infecting viruses that the group used as experimental model organisms. Studies by molecular geneticists affiliated with this group contributed to understanding how gene-encoded proteins function in DNA replication, DNA repair and DNA recombination, and on how viruses are assembled from protein and nucleic acid components (molecular morphogenesis). Furthermore, the role of chain terminating codons was elucidated. One noteworthy study was performed by Sydney Brenner and collaborators using &quot;amber&quot; mutants defective in the gene encoding the major head protein of bacteriophage T4. This study demonstrated the co-linearity of the gene with its encoded polypeptide, thus providing strong evidence for the &quot;sequence hypothesis&quot; that the amino acid sequence of a protein is specified by the nucleotide sequence of the gene determining the protein. 

The isolation of a restriction endonuclease in &quot;E. coli&quot; by Arber and Linn in 1969 opened the field of genetic engineering. Restriction enzymes were used to linearize DNA for separation by electrophoresis and Southern blotting allowed for the identification of specific DNA segments via hybridization probes. In 1971, Berg utilized restriction enzymes to create the first recombinant DNA molecule and first recombinant DNA plasmid.  In 1972, Cohen and Boyer created the first recombinant DNA organism by inserting recombinant DNA plasmids into &quot;E. coli&quot;, now known as bacterial transformation, and paved the way for molecular cloning.  The development of DNA sequencing techniques in the late 1970s, first by Maxam and Gilbert, and then by Frederick Sanger, was pivotal to molecular genetic research and enabled scientists to begin conducting genetic screens to relate genotypic sequences to phenotypes. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Taq polymerase, invented by Mullis in 1985, enabled scientists to create millions of copies of a specific DNA sequence that could be used for transformation or manipulated using agarose gel separation. A decade later, the first whole genome was sequenced (&quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;), followed by the eventual sequencing of the human genome via the Human Genome Project in 2001. The culmination of all of those discoveries was a new field called genomics that links the molecular structure of a gene to the protein or RNA encoded by that segment of DNA and the functional expression of that protein within an organism. Today, through the application of molecular genetic techniques, genomics is being studied in many model organisms and data is being collected in computer databases like NCBI and Ensembl. The computer analysis and comparison of genes within and between different species is called bioinformatics, and links genetic mutations on an evolutionary scale.

== Central dogma ==

The central dogma plays a key role in the study of molecular genetics. The central dogma states that DNA replicates itself, DNA is transcribed into RNA, and RNA is translated into proteins. Along with the central dogma, the genetic code is used in understanding how RNA is translated into proteins. Replication of DNA and transcription from DNA to mRNA occurs in the nucleus while translation from RNA to proteins occurs in the ribosome. The genetic code is made of four interchangeable parts othe DNA molecules, called &quot;bases&quot;: adenine, cytosine, uracil (in RNA; thymine in DNA), and guanine and is redundant, meaning multiple combinations of these base pairs (which are read in triplicate) produce the same amino acid. Proteomics and genomics are fields in biology that come out of the study of molecular genetics and the central dogma.

== Structure of DNA ==
An organism&#x27;s genome is made up by its entire set of DNA and is responsible for its genetic traits, function and development. The composition of DNA itself is an essential component to the field of molecular genetics; it is the basis of how DNA is able to store genetic information, pass it on, and be in a format that can be read and translated.

DNA is a double stranded molecule, with each strand oriented in an antiparallel fashion. Nucleotides are the building blocks of DNA, each composed of a sugar molecule, a phosphate group and one of four nitrogenous bases: adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine. A single strand of DNA is held together by covalent bonds, while the two antiparallel strands are held together by hydrogen bonds between the nucleotide bases. Adenine binds with thymine and cytosine binds with guanine. It is these four base sequences that form the genetic code for all biological life and contains the information for all the proteins the organism will be able to synthesize.

Its unique structure allows DNA to store and pass on biological information across generations during cell division. At cell division, cells must be able to copy its genome and pass it on to daughter cells. This is possible due to the double-stranded structure of DNA because one strand is complementary to its partner strand, and therefore each of these strands can act as a template strand for the formation of a new complementary strand. This is why the process of DNA replication is known as a semiconservative process.

==Techniques==
===Forward genetics===

Forward genetics is a molecular genetics technique used to identify genes or genetic mutations that produce a certain phenotype. In a genetic screen, random mutations are generated with mutagens (chemicals or radiation) or transposons and individuals are screened for the specific phenotype. Often, a secondary assay in the form of a selection may follow mutagenesis where the desired phenotype is difficult to observe, for example in bacteria or cell cultures. The cells may be transformed using a gene for antibiotic resistance or a fluorescent reporter so that the mutants with the desired phenotype are selected from the non-mutants.

Mutants exhibiting the phenotype of interest are isolated and a complementation test may be performed to determine if the phenotype results from more than one gene. The mutant genes are then characterized as dominant (resulting in a gain of function), recessive (showing a loss of function), or epistatic (the mutant gene masks the phenotype of another gene). Finally, the location and specific nature of the mutation is mapped via sequencing. Forward genetics is an unbiased approach and often leads to many unanticipated discoveries, but may be costly and time consuming. Model organisms like the nematode worm &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot;, the fruit fly &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;, and the zebrafish &quot;Danio rerio&quot; have been used successfully to study phenotypes resulting from gene mutations.
===Reverse genetics===

Reverse genetics is the term for molecular genetics techniques used to determine the phenotype resulting from an intentional mutation in a gene of interest. The phenotype is used to deduce the function of the un-mutated version of the gene. Mutations may be random or intentional changes to the gene of interest. Mutations may be a missense mutation caused by nucleotide substitution, a nucleotide addition or deletion to induce a frameshift mutation, or a complete addition/deletion of a gene or gene segment. The deletion of a particular gene creates a gene knockout where the gene is not expressed and a loss of function results (e.g. knockout mice). Missense mutations may cause total loss of function or result in partial loss of function, known as a knockdown. Knockdown may also be achieved by RNA interference (RNAi). Alternatively, genes may be substituted into an organism&#x27;s genome (also known as a transgene) to create a gene knock-in and result in a gain of function by the host. Although these techniques have some inherent bias regarding the decision to link a phenotype to a particular function, it is much faster in terms of production than forward genetics because the gene of interest is already known.

== Molecular genetic tools ==
Molecular genetics is a scientific approach that utilizes the fundamentals of genetics as a tool to better understand the molecular basis of a disease and biological processes in organisms. Below are some tools readily employed by researchers in the field.

=== Microsatellites ===
Microsatellites or single sequence repeats (SSRS) are short repeating segment of DNA composed to 6 nucleotides at a particular location on the genome that are used as genetic marker. Researchers can analyze these microsatellites in techniques such DNA fingerprinting and paternity testing since these repeats are highly unique to individuals/families. a can also be used in constructing genetic maps and to studying genetic linkage to locate the gene or mutation responsible for specific trait or disease. Microsatellites can also be applied to population genetics to study comparisons between groups.

=== Genome-wide association studies ===
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are a technique that relies on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to study genetic variations in populations that can be associated with a particular disease. The Human Genome Project mapped the entire human genome and has made this approach more readily available and cost effective for researchers to implement. In order to conduct a GWAS researchers use two groups, one group that has the disease researchers are studying and another that acts as the control that does not have that particular disease. DNA samples are obtained from participants and their genome can then be derived through lab machinery and quickly surveyed to compare participants and look for SNPs that can potentially be associated with the disease. This technique allows researchers to pinpoint genes and locations of interest in the human genome that they can then further study to identify that cause of the disease.

=== Karyotyping ===
Karyotyping allows researchers to analyze chromosomes during metaphase of mitosis, when they are in a condensed state. Chromosomes are stained and visualized through a microscope to look for any chromosomal abnormalities. This technique can be used to detect congenital genetic disorder such as down syndrome, identify gender in embryos, and diagnose some cancers that are caused by chromosome mutations such as translocations.

== Modern applications ==

=== Genetic engineering ===
Genetic engineering is an emerging field of science, and researcher are able to leverage molecular genetic technology to modify the DNA of organisms and create genetically modified and enhanced organisms for industrial, agricultural and medical purposes. This can be done through genome editing techniques, which can involve modifying base pairings in a DNA sequence, or adding and deleting certain regions of DNA.

=== Gene editing ===
Gene editing allows scientists to alter/edit an organism&#x27;s DNA. One way to due this is through the technique Crispr/Cas9, which was adapted from the genome immune defense that is naturally occurring in bacteria. This technique relies on the protein Cas9 which allows scientists to make a cut in strands of DNA at a specific location, and it uses a specialized RNA guide sequence to ensure the cut is made in the proper location in the genome. Then scientists use DNAs repair pathways to induce changes in the genome; this technique has wide implications for disease treatment.

=== Personalized medicine ===
Molecular genetics has wide implications in medical advancement and understanding the molecular basis of a disease allows the opportunity for more effective diagnostic and therapies. One of the goals of the field is personalized medicine, where an individual&#x27;s genetics can help determine the cause and tailor the cure for a disease they are afflicted with and potentially allow for more individualized treatment approaches which could be more effective. For example, certain genetic variations in individuals could make them more receptive to a particular drug while other could have a higher risk of adverse reaction to treatments. So this information would allow researchers and clinicals to make the most informed decisions about treatment efficacy for patients rather than the standard trial and error approach.

=== Forensic genetics ===
Forensic genetics plays an essential role for criminal investigations through that use of various molecular genetic techniques. One common technique is DNA fingerprinting which is done using a combination of molecular genetic techniques like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and gel electrophoresis. PCR is a technique that allows a target DNA sequence to be amplified, meaning even a tiny quantity of DNA from a crime scene can be extracted and replicated many times to provide a sufficient amount of material for analysis. Gel electrophoresis allows the DNA sequence to be separated based on size, and the pattern that is derived is known as DNA fingerprinting and is unique to each individual. This combination of molecular genetic techniques allows a simple DNA sequence to be extracted, amplified, analyzed and compared with others and is a standard technique used in forensics.

<doc id="339841" wikidata="Q313381" url="?curid=339841" title="Tom Brady">
<text>Thomas Edward Patrick Brady Jr. (born August 3, 1977) is an American former professional football quarterback and current sports broadcaster who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 23 seasons. He spent his first 20 seasons with the New England Patriots and was a central contributor to the franchise&#x27;s dynasty from 2001 to 2019. In his final three seasons, he was a member of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Brady is widely regarded as the greatest quarterback of all time.

After playing college football for the Michigan Wolverines, Brady was selected 199th overall by the Patriots in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL draft, later earning him a reputation as the NFL&#x27;s biggest draft steal. He became the starting quarterback during his second season, which saw the Patriots win their first Super Bowl title in Super Bowl XXXVI. As the team&#x27;s primary starter for18 seasons, Brady led the Patriots to17 division titles (including11 consecutive from 2009 to 2019),13 AFC Championship Games (including eight consecutive from 2011 to 2018), nine Super Bowl appearances, and six Super Bowl titles, all NFL records for a player and franchise. He joined the Buccaneers in 2020 and won Super Bowl LV, extending his individual records to10 Super Bowl appearances and seven victories. In 2024, Brady became the lead color commentator for the &quot;NFL on Fox&quot; and a partial owner of the Las Vegas Raiders.

Brady holds many major quarterback records, including most career passing yards, completions, touchdown passes, and games started. He is the NFL leader in career quarterback wins, quarterback regular season wins, quarterback playoff wins, and Super Bowl Most Valuable Player (MVP) Awards, and the only Super Bowl MVP for two different franchises. Additional accolades held by Brady include the most Pro Bowl selections and the first unanimous NFL MVP. The only quarterback to win a Super Bowl in three separate decades, Brady is also noted for the longevity of his success. He was the oldest NFL MVP at age40, the oldest Super Bowl MVP at age43, and the oldest quarterback selected to the Pro Bowl at age44. Brady is the only NFL quarterback named to two all-decade teams (2000s and 2010s) and was unanimously named to the 100th Anniversary All-Time Team in 2019.

== Early life ==

Brady was born in San Mateo, California, on August 3, 1977, the only son and fourth child of Galynn Patricia () and Thomas Brady Sr. Brady was raised as a Catholic. His mother has Swedish, Norwegian, German, and Polish ancestry, while his father is of Irish descent. Brady has said that his father is 100% Irish.

In the 1980s, Brady regularly attended San Francisco 49ers games at Candlestick Park, where he was a fan of quarterback Joe Montana; Brady has called Montana his idol and one of his inspirations. At age four, Brady attended the 1981 NFC Championship, against the Dallas Cowboys, in which Montana threw &quot;The Catch&quot; to Dwight Clark. As a child, Brady attended football camp at the College of San Mateo, where he was taught to throw the football by camp counselor and future NFL/AFL quarterback Tony Graziani. Despite the rivalry between the two teams, Brady grew up as a Los Angeles Lakers and Boston Celtics fan.

Brady attended Junípero Serra High School in San Mateo, where he graduated in 1995. He played football, basketball, and baseball in high school. He played against Bellarmine College Preparatory rival Pat Burrell in both football and baseball. Brady began his football career as the backup quarterback on the Padres junior varsity team. At first, Brady was not good enough to start on the 0–8 junior varsity team, which had not scored a touchdown all year. Brady ascended to the starting position when the starting quarterback was injured. He became the varsity starter in his junior year and held the position until he graduated. By Brady&#x27;s senior year, he was striving to be noticed by college coaches. He created highlight tapes and sent them to schools he considered attending. This led to strong interest from many football programs.

The process of recruiting was much different during Brady&#x27;s time when athletes&#x27; rankings were not as prominent. In terms of recruiting in the 2000s, Brady would have been considered a three or four-star recruit. He was a highly rated prospect. Brady was also on Blue Chip Illustrated as well as a Prep Football Report All-American selection. After his recruiting process, he narrowed his list to five schools. &quot;Probably the ones that we did hear from and ultimately pared the list to were Cal–Berkeley, UCLA, USC, Michigan and Illinois,&quot; his father said. As a Cal-Berkeley fan, his father hoped that Brady would attend the nearby school, where Brady was a silent commit, and that he would be able to watch his son play.

Brady was also known as a great baseball player in high school. He was a left-handed-batting catcher with power. His skills impressed MLB scouts, and he was drafted in the 18th round of the 1995 MLB Draft by the Montreal Expos, after the team brought Brady to Candlestick Park to work out with players, a very unusual decision. The Expos projected Brady as a potential All-Star, with then-GM Kevin Malone claiming that he had the potential to be &quot;one of the greatest catchers ever&quot;. The team offered him money typical of that offered to a late second-round or early third-round pick, but Brady was recruited by Michigan football assistant Bill Harris, signing to play for the University of Michigan in 1995. Brady would become the last active athlete drafted by the Expos. He finished his high school football career by completing 236 of 447 passes (52.8%) for 3,702 yards and31 touchdowns. Brady also won All-State and All-Far West honors and the team&#x27;s Most Valuable Player Award.

During the summer of 1998 and 1999, Brady was an intern at Merrill Lynch. He was inducted into the Junípero Serra High School Hall of Fame in 2003. When Brady visited the school in 2012, two weeks after Super Bowl XLVI, administrators announced that they named the football stadium Brady Family Stadium.

== College career ==
Brady played college football at the University of Michigan for the Wolverines from 1995 to 1999. After redshirting in 1995, Brady spent the next two years as a backup quarterback, while teammate and future NFL quarterback Brian Griese led the 1997 Wolverines to an undefeated season, which was capped by a victory in the Rose Bowl and a share of the national championship. When he initially enrolled at Michigan, Brady was seventh on the depth chart, and struggled to get playing time. At one point, Brady hired a sports psychologist to help him cope with frustration and anxiety; he even considered transferring to the University of California, Berkeley. He worked closely with assistant athletic director Greg Harden, who met with Brady every week to build his confidence and to maximize his performance. Brady told &quot;60 Minutes&quot; in 2014: &quot;He will always be somebody I rely on for sound advice and mentorship. He has helped me with my own personal struggles in both athletics and in life. Greg really pushed me in a direction that I wasn&#x27;t sure I could go.&quot;

On September 28, 1996, Brady appeared in his first collegiate game after Michigan was up 35–3 against UCLA late in the fourth quarter. His first-ever pass attempt was intercepted by Phillip Ward and returned for a 42-yard touchdown.

Under Michigan head coach Lloyd Carr, Brady battled for the starting job with Drew Henson and ultimately started every game in the 1998 and 1999 seasons. Brady was All-Big Ten Conference honorable mention both seasons and was the team captain in his senior year.

During his first full year as the starter, he set new Michigan records for most pass attempts and completions in a season, for a total of 214. He set a school record for completions in a 31–16 loss against Ohio State in 1998, a season in which Michigan shared the Big Ten title. Brady capped that season with a 45–31 win over Arkansas in the Citrus Bowl.

In the 1999 season, Brady had to once again hold off Henson for the starting job. The two players platooned during the season&#x27;s first seven games, with Brady playing the first quarter, Henson the second, and Carr then deciding upon a quarterback for the second half. The 1999 Michigan Wolverines started with a 5–0 record, including a 26–22 win over Notre Dame, and a road win against eventual powerhouse Wisconsin. Against Michigan State, Brady was not chosen to play the second half; however, after being reinserted into the game with Michigan down by17 points, he nearly led Michigan all the way back before losing 34–31. After a 300-yard passing game the following week, Carr went exclusively with Brady for the remainder of the season. On October 30 against Indiana, Brady played the entire game for the first time in the season and threw for 226 yards, his fifth straight game throwing for 200 yards, to lead Michigan out of a close game, which ended in a 34–31 win. Against Penn State, Brady led Michigan to another 4th-quarter comeback in a 31–27 win, heading into the regular season&#x27;s final game as winners of three straight.

Michigan concluded the regular season against Ohio State; this was a dramatic game with a trip to the Orange Bowl on the line. With five minutes left, tied 17–17, Brady led Michigan to the winning score. He led Michigan to an overtime win in the Orange Bowl over Alabama, throwing for 369 yards and four touchdowns, leading the team back from a pair of 14-point deficits in regulation (14–0 in the first half, and 28–14 in the second). He threw the game-winning score on a bootleg play to tight end Shawn Thompson. Michigan won the game when Alabama missed an extra point following its touchdown.

In the two seasons that Brady started at Michigan, he posted a 20–5 record, including wins at the 1999 Citrus Bowl and the 2000 Orange Bowl. Brady finished his career ranking third in Michigan history with 710 attempts and 442 completions, fourth with 5,351 yards and 62.3 completion percentage, and fifth with 35 touchdown passes. He graduated from Michigan in December 1999 with a Bachelor of Arts in General Studies.

==Professional career==
=== Overview ===
Brady&#x27;s success as a passer has been attributed to his work ethic, competitive spirit, pocket awareness, and intelligence. Brady started 333 regular season and 48 playoff games. in23 seasons, the most for an NFL quarterback. His first20 seasons were with the Patriots, which is the most for an NFL quarterback with one franchise. He served as the primary starter in21 of his seasons, holding a backup role during his rookie campaign and missing nearly all the 2008 season due to injury. The 2008 season marks the only time Brady did not start because of injury. During his21 seasons as the primary starter, he missed the playoffs only once (in 2002) and had only one losing season (in 2022). Throughout his 23 seasons in the NFL, Brady never played a snap in which his team was mathematically eliminated from playoff contention. With the Patriots, Brady led the team to17 AFC East titles. He led the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2020 to a wild card berth, the only time his team did not make the playoffs as a division winner, and NFC South titles the following two seasons.
The winningest quarterback in NFL history, Brady won 251 regular season games and35 postseason games. Brady holds a winning percentage. He is the only NFL quarterback to win 200 regular season games and his35 postseason victories are more than twice those of any other quarterback. Brady is the only NFL quarterback to win all 16 regular season games (2007). In 2021, Brady became one of four quarterbacks to defeat all32 NFL teams. Brady has the most Pro Bowl selections in NFL history at15 and was named league MVP three times in 2007, 2010 and 2017. His 2010 MVP was awarded in a unanimous decision; the first time this distinction was achieved. Brady was named Male Athlete of the Year in 2007. He is one of only three players to win multiple NFL MVP and Super Bowl MVP awards.

Brady&#x27;s 21 seasons as the primary starter led to seven Super Bowl titles, the most of any player and more than any NFL franchise. Overall, he appeared in a record10 Super Bowls; just under half of the seasons in which he was the primary starter and more than any NFL franchise other than the Patriots. He and Peyton Manning are the only starting quarterbacks to win the Super Bowl for more than one franchise, with Brady winning six for the Patriots and one for the Buccaneers. In his seven victories, Brady set the record for Super Bowl MVP awards with five. Having earned Super Bowl MVP honors with both New England and Tampa Bay, Brady is the only player to win the award with multiple franchises.

Holding nearly every major quarterback record, Brady is the regular season and playoff NFL leader in passing yards, attempts, and touchdown passes. He is the only NFL quarterback to have 600 passing touchdowns in the regular season. Brady holds regular and postseason records for completions. In his 333 career starts, he is the only NFL quarterback to have three separate streaks of consecutive starts of over 100 games. Brady&#x27;s 111 consecutive starts from 2001 to 2008 ended because of his injury, and his 112 consecutive starts from 2009 to 2016 ended after he was suspended. For the remainder of his career, Brady had 110 consecutive starts from 2016 to 2022. His longevity led to him setting age records. Brady is the NFL&#x27;s oldest quarterback to be named to the Pro Bowl (age44), be named Super Bowl MVP (43), win a Super Bowl as the starting quarterback (43), and be named league MVP (40). Up until his retirement, he was the last player drafted before 2004 on an NFL roster.

On the Patriots, Brady and head coach Bill Belichick formed the NFL&#x27;s most successful quarterback–head coach tandem. They were consistently credited with the Patriots&#x27; dynasty from 2001 to 2019, resulting in the dynasty being named the Brady–Belichick era after them. The dynasty is regarded as one of the greatest in sports history, with Brady&#x27;s successes helping the Patriots set the records for Super Bowl appearances(11) and wins with the Pittsburgh Steelers). During Brady&#x27;s first season as the primary starter, the franchise won its first championship in Super Bowl XXXVI, with consecutive titles following in 2003 and 2004. The Patriots won an NFL-record21 consecutive games (regular season and playoffs) during this period, while Brady won10 consecutive postseason games (also his first10 postseason games), another NFL record.

Brady maintained the Patriots&#x27; status as perennial postseason contenders throughout his tenure, although they did not win another Super Bowl until a decade after their third. His next two appearances both ended in upset defeats to the New York Giants; the first loss in 2007&#x27;s Super Bowl XLII also prevented Brady and the Patriots from obtaining a perfect 19–0 season. Brady returned to dominant postseason form in 2014 when he led the Patriots to their fourth title in Super Bowl XLIX. This was followed by Brady making three consecutive Super Bowl appearances from 2016 to 2018, which secured New England&#x27;s fifth and sixth titles in Super Bowl LI and Super Bowl LIII.

When Brady signed with Tampa Bay in 2020, the team had not reached the postseason since 2007 or won a playoff game since 2002. Brady helped end both droughts en route to the Buccaneers winning Super Bowl LV. In 2021, he set the season record for completions and led the league in passing yards and touchdowns; his passing yards were also a career-high. In his final season, despite finishing with a losing record for the first time, Brady broke his single-season completion record and set the season record for attempts.
One of the NFL&#x27;s most decorated and accomplished players, Brady is widely cited as the greatest quarterback of all time. He is considered one of NFL&#x27;s greatest players of all time and one of the greatest athletes in sports history.

===New England Patriots===
====2000: Draft and rookie season on the bench====
Brady was a lightly regarded prospect coming out of college, with an unimpressive NFL Scouting Combine performance reinforcing this reputation. As a result, he was not selected until the sixth round of the 2000 NFL draft by the New England Patriots, 199th overall, a compensatory pick the Patriots earned due to the loss of punter Tom Tupa to free agency in 1999, and was the seventh quarterback taken. He and his family believed Brady would be drafted in the second or third round; they watched the draft on television, stunned as six other quarterbacks were drafted before he was. Brady was so embarrassed he briefly left the family home during the sixth round and cried when recalling the experience for an interview 11 years later. Brady later said that when the Patriots notified him that he would be drafted, he was grateful he would not &quot;have to be an insurance salesman&quot;. According to Michael Holley&#x27;s book &quot;Patriot Reign&quot;, the Patriots were considering Brady and Tim Rattay, both of whom had received positive reviews from then-quarterbacks coach Dick Rehbein. Ultimately, the Patriots front office chose Brady. Considering his subsequent success, many analysts have called Brady the best NFL draft pick of all time. Patriots owner Robert Kraft recalled: &quot;I still have the image of Tom Brady coming down the old Foxboro Stadium steps with that pizza box under his arm, a skinny beanpole, and when he introduced himself to me and said &#x27;Hi Mr. Kraft,&#x27; he was about to say who he was, but I said &#x27;I know who you are, you&#x27;re Tom Brady. You&#x27;re our sixth round draft choice,&#x27;&quot; recalled Kraft. &quot;And he looked me in the eye and said &#x27;I&#x27;m the best decision this organization has ever made.&#x27; It looks like he could be right.&quot;

Brady started the 2000 season as the fourth-string quarterback, behind starter Drew Bledsoe and backups John Friesz and Michael Bishop; by the end of the season, he was number two on the depth chart behind Bledsoe. During his rookie season, he was 1-for-3 passing, for six yards. Tight end Rod Rutledge caught Brady&#x27;s first and only completed pass of the season in a 34–9 loss to the Detroit Lions on November 23.

====2001: Taking over as starter and first Super Bowl victory====
With Bledsoe as the starting quarterback, the Patriots opened the 2001 season with a 23–17 road loss to the Cincinnati Bengals. In their second game and home opener on September 23, the Patriots squared off against their AFC East rivals, the New York Jets. Bledsoe was again the starter; in the fourth quarter, he suffered internal bleeding after a hit from Jets linebacker Mo Lewis. Bledsoe returned for the next series, but was replaced with Brady for the Patriots&#x27; final series of the game. New York held on to win 10–3, and the Patriots fell to 0–2 on the season. Brady was named the starter for the season&#x27;s third game, against the Indianapolis Colts, in which the Patriots posted a 44–13 win.

In the Patriots&#x27; fifth game, Brady began to find his stride. Trailing the visiting San Diego Chargers 26–16 in the fourth quarter, he led the Patriots on two scoring drives to force overtime, and another in overtime to set up a winning field goal for a 29–26 victory. Brady finished the game with 33 of 54, for 364 yards and two touchdowns, and was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week for the first time in his career. The following week, Brady again played well during the rematch at Indianapolis, with a passer rating of 148.3 in a 38–17 win. Brady won his second AFC Offensive Player of the Week nomination after a four-touchdown day in a 34–17 win over the New Orleans Saints in Week 11. The Patriots went on to win eleven of the fourteen games Brady started, and six straight to finish the regular season, winning the AFC East and entering the NFL playoffs with a first-round bye. He finished the 2001 season with 2,843 passing yards and 18 touchdowns, earning an invitation to the Pro Bowl.

In Brady&#x27;s first playoff game, he threw for 312 yards against the Oakland Raiders and led the Patriots back from a ten-point fourth-quarter deficit to send the game to overtime, where they won on an Adam Vinatieri field goal 16–13. A controversial play occurred in the fourth quarter of that game. Trailing by three points, Brady lost control of the ball after being hit by Raiders cornerback and former Michigan teammate Charles Woodson. Oakland initially recovered the ball but, citing the &quot;tuck rule&quot;which states that any forward throwing motion by a quarterback begins a pass even if the quarterback loses possession of the ball as he is attempting to tuck it back toward his bodyreferee Walt Coleman overturned the call on instant replay, ruling it an incomplete pass rather than a fumble. Brady finished the game 32-of-52 for 312 passing yards and one interception.

In the AFC Championship Game against the Steelers, Brady injured his knee, and was relieved by Bledsoe. The Patriots won the game by a score of 24–17. Subsequently, Las Vegas oddsmakers positioned them as 14-point underdogs against the NFC champion St. Louis Rams in Super Bowl XXXVI.

Brady returned from his knee injury in the AFC Championship Game to start in the Super Bowl a week later at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans. Despite being heavy underdogs, the Patriots played well, holding the Rams&#x27; high-powered offense in check through the first three quarters. The Rams rallied from a 17–3 deficit to tie the game with 1:30 left in regulation. The Patriots then got the ball back at their own 17-yard line with no timeouts remaining. Sportscaster and former Super Bowl-winning coach John Madden argued that the Patriots should run out the clock and try to win the game in overtime. Instead, Brady drove the Patriots&#x27; offense down the field to the Rams&#x27; 31-yard line before spiking the ball with seven seconds left. Kicker Adam Vinatieri converted a 48-yard field goal as time expired to give the Patriots a 20–17 win and their first ever league championship. When discussing the game winning drive, Madden stated that &quot;what Tom Brady just did, gives me goosebumps&quot;. Brady was named Super Bowl MVP while throwing for 145 yards, one touchdown, and no interceptions. At the age of 24 years and six months, Brady became the youngest quarterback to win a Super Bowl, surpassing Joe Namath (III) and Joe Montana (XVI). Bledsoe was traded to the Buffalo Bills in April, which cemented Brady&#x27;s status as the Patriots&#x27; starting quarterback in 2002.

====2002 season====
In the Patriots&#x27; season opener, Brady had 294 passing yards and three touchdowns in the 30–14 win over the Steelers, and earned his third AFC Offensive Player of the Week title. In Week 9, Brady won his second AFC Offensive Player of the Week title for a three-touchdown game in a 38–7 win over Buffalo. Brady and the Patriots finished the season at 9–7, tied with the Jets and Miami Dolphins for the best record in the division; however, the Patriots lost the division title to the Jets on tiebreakers. Additionally, the Patriots lost the tiebreaker to the Cleveland Browns for the final wild card spot, causing them to miss the playoffs entirely. Though Brady posted a career-low single-season passer rating of 85.7 and a career-high of 14 interceptions, he threw for a league-leading 28 touchdown passes.

====2003 and 2004 seasons: Back-to-back Super Bowl wins====
After opening the 2003 season at 2–2, Brady led the Patriots to twelve consecutive victories to finish the regular season at 14–2 to win the AFC East. In Week 14, a 12–0 victory over the Dolphins, he recorded a 36-yard punt. He won AFC Offensive Player of the Week twice in the 2003 season, in Week 9 and Week 17. Brady finished with 3,620 passing yards and 23 touchdowns, and was third in NFL MVP voting to co-winners Peyton Manning and Steve McNair.

After earning a first-round bye, the Patriots defeated the Tennessee Titans in the Divisional Round, 17–14. In the AFC Championship Game, they defeated the Colts, 24–14. In Super Bowl XXXVIII, Brady led the Patriots to a 32–29 victory over the NFC champion Carolina Panthers and was named Super Bowl MVP for the second time. During the game, Brady threw for 354 yards with three touchdowns and set the record for most completions by a quarterback in a Super Bowl with 32. With 1:08 left in the fourth quarter and the score tied 29–29, Brady led a drive with five completions to put the Patriots in position for the game-winning 41-yard field goal by Adam Vinatieri.
During the 2004 season, Brady helped the Patriots set an NFL record with 21 straight wins dating from the previous year, an accomplishment honored in the Pro Football Hall of Fame (though for official records, the NFL considers it an 18-game regular season winning streak; it does not count playoff games). New England finished with a 14–2 record, equaling their 2003 record and the best regular-season record ever for a defending champion. The Patriots also won the AFC East title for the third time in four years. Brady threw for 3,692 yards and 28 touchdowns, with a 92.6 passer rating, and was voted to his second Pro Bowl.

In the playoffs, Brady led the Patriots to wins over the Colts in the Divisional Round by a score of 20–3 and the Steelers in the AFC Championship by a score of 41–27. Brady played his best game of the year in Pittsburgh despite requiring intravenous treatment the previous night when he ran a temperature of 103 °F. Against the NFL&#x27;s best defense, he recorded a quarterback passer rating of 130.5, his highest of the season. In Super Bowl XXXIX, the Patriots narrowly defeated the Philadelphia Eagles, 24–21, capturing their third championship in four years. They became the first franchise since the Dallas Cowboys to do so. Up until the 2023 season, the 2004 New England Patriots were the last NFL team to win a second straight Super Bowl. Brady threw for 236 yards and two touchdowns in the win.

====2005 and 2006 seasons====
During the 2005 season, injuries suffered by running backs Corey Dillon, Patrick Pass, and Kevin Faulk forced the Patriots to rely more on Brady&#x27;s passing. Brady also had to adjust to new center Russ Hochstein and running back Heath Evans. Brady won AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his Week 5 350-yard, three-touchdown victory over the Falcons. Brady finished the season with 4,110 yards and 26 touchdowns, the former of which led the league. He and the Patriots finished with a 10–6 record, winning their third straight AFC East title. He was named to his third Pro Bowl at the end of the season.

In the playoffs, Brady recorded 201 passing yards and three passing touchdowns to help lead the Patriots to a 28–3 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars in the Wild Card Round. In the Divisional Round the Patriots lost 27–13 to the Denver Broncos. Brady threw for 341 yards in the game with one touchdown and two interceptions in the first playoff loss of his career after ten consecutive victories. After the season&#x27;s end, it was revealed that Brady had been playing with a sports hernia since December.

In 2006, Brady led the Patriots to a 12–4 record and the fourth seed in the AFC playoffs. Brady finished the regular season with 3,529 yards and 24 touchdowns. He was not among the players initially selected to the Pro Bowl, although he was offered an injury-replacement selection when Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers was forced to withdraw. Brady ended up declining the invitation.

In the postseason, the Patriots first hosted their division rivals, the Jets, in the Wild Card Round. The Patriots defeated the Jets 37–16, as Brady went 22–34 for 212 yards and two touchdowns. The Patriots traveled to San Diego to take on the Chargers in the Divisional Round. This was Brady&#x27;s first playoff game in his home state of California. Brady and the Patriots struggled against the Chargers, whom many had picked as favorites to win Super Bowl XLI. With eight minutes left in the fourth quarter and the Patriots down by eight points, Brady and the Patriots started a key drive that would ultimately decide the game. During the drive, Brady threw a fourth-down interception to safety Marlon McCree, but wide receiver Troy Brown forced a fumble on McCree that wide receiver Reche Caldwell recovered to convert the first down. With a new set of downs, Brady threw a touchdown pass to Caldwell and Faulk scored the two-point conversion to tie the game. On what would be the Patriots&#x27; final drive, Brady threw a 49-yard pass play to Caldwell, setting up a Stephen Gostkowski field goal that gave New England a 24–21 lead with 1:10 remaining. The Chargers drove down the field, but Nate Kaeding missed a game-tying field goal attempt, as the Patriots held on to win.

In the AFC Championship, the Patriots traveled to Indianapolis to play the Colts, marking the third time the Patriots played the Colts in four postseasons. The Patriots led at halftime, 21–6; however, Peyton Manning led the Colts to a comeback. Brady threw a late-game interception and the Patriots lost the game to the Colts, 38–34. Brady finished the loss 21 of 34 for 232 yards, one touchdown, and one interception.

====2007: Perfect regular season and first MVP====

Playing with an overhauled receiver corps—in the 2007 off-season, the Patriots acquired wide receivers Donté Stallworth, Wes Welker, Kelley Washington, and Randy Moss; tight end Kyle Brady; and running back Sammy Morris—Brady enjoyed what many sportswriters described as one of the best seasons by a quarterback. Brady was named AFC Offensive Player of the Month for both September and October. Brady led the Patriots to the first 16–0 regular-season record in NFL history, outscoring opponents by an average score of 37–17. He also attained numerous career, franchise, and NFL records and milestones in the process. He was named as the AFC Offensive Player of the Week five times that year. In a Week 6 game against the Dallas Cowboys, he had a career-high five passing touchdowns in a 48–27 win. The win tied him with Hall of Fame quarterback Roger Staubach for the most wins ever by a starting quarterback in his first 100 regular-season starts, with 76. The next week, in part of a 49–28 win against the Dolphins, he had another record day, with a career-high six passing touchdowns, setting a franchise record. He also had the first game with a perfect passer rating of his career. Two weeks later, as part of a come-from-behind 24–20 victory against the Colts, he threw for another three touchdowns, the ninth consecutive game in which he had done so, breaking Peyton Manning&#x27;s NFL record of eight. During the last game of the season against the Giants in which the Patriots won 38–35, Brady threw his 50th touchdown of the season, breaking Peyton Manning&#x27;s single-season record of 49 from the 2004 season.
Brady finished the season with 4,806 passing yards, 50 touchdown passes, eight interceptions, and a career-high 117.2 passer rating. It was unanimously voted the greatest passing season of all time by ESPN in 2013. His 50:8 touchdown to interception ratio was, at the time, an NFL record. He became the first quarterback to pass for 50 touchdowns. He led the Patriots to the first undefeated regular season since the 16-game schedule was implemented in 1978. He directed an offense that scored a then-NFL record 589 points and 75 total touchdowns. The team&#x27;s 50 total touchdown passes is the fourth-most ever in a season. For his efforts, Brady was named the Most Valuable Player and Offensive Player of the Year. He was also honored by the Associated Press as their Male Athlete of the Year, the first time an NFL player earned the honor since Joe Montana won the award in 1990. He was named as a First-Team All-Pro and to his fourth career Pro Bowl as a result of his historic season.

In the Patriots&#x27; first playoff game, a Divisional Round game against the Jaguars, Brady began the game with an NFL postseason record 16 consecutive completed passes, and finished the game with 26 completions in 28 attempts, a completion rate of 92.9% as the Patriots won 31–20. That mark was the highest single-game completion percentage (with at least 20 attempts) in NFL history, regular season or postseason. With the win, the Patriots matched the undefeated 1972 Miami Dolphins as the only team to win 17 consecutive games in one season.

Statistically, Brady did not fare as well in the AFC Championship Game against the Chargers, throwing for 209 yards, two touchdowns, and three interceptions. Nevertheless, the Patriots won their 18th game of the season, 21–12, to advance to the Super Bowl for the fourth time in seven seasons. Brady, with the 100th win of his career, also set an NFL record for the fewest games needed by a starting quarterback to do so: his 100–26 record is sixteen games better than Joe Montana&#x27;s.
In Super Bowl XLII against the New York Giants, Brady was pressured heavily and sacked five times. The Patriots managed to take the lead with a Brady touchdown to Moss with less than three minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, but the Giants were able to drive and score a last-minute touchdown to upset the Patriots 17–14, taking away what would have been the first perfect season since the NFL expanded its regular season to 16 games.

====2008: Injury====
In the Patriots&#x27; season opener against the Kansas City Chiefs at Gillette Stadium (in which the Patriots won 17–10), Brady&#x27;s left knee was seriously injured midway through the first quarter on a hit by Chiefs safety Bernard Pollard; Brady left the game and did not return. The team later confirmed that he would require surgery, and it would prematurely end his 2008 season. Brady tore both his anterior cruciate ligament and medial collateral ligament. The injury ended Brady&#x27;s streak of 111 consecutive starts. Dr. Neal ElAttrache performed the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction at the Los Angeles Kerlan-Jobe Orthopaedic Clinic on October 6, using Brady&#x27;s patellar tendon graft to replace the torn ligament, and also repaired his medial collateral ligament, through a separate incision in his left knee. An infection in the wound resulted in further debridement surgery several times since the original procedure. Brady received IV antibiotics for this infection which, at the time, threatened to delay his rehab. Despite Brady&#x27;s absence, the Patriots managed to finish the 2008 season with an 11–5 record; however, due to tiebreakers, the Patriots not only failed to win the AFC East division title, but missed the playoffs altogether for the first time since the 2002 season.

====2009: Return from injury====

In the 2009 season opener against the Bills, Brady&#x27;s first game in more than a year, he threw for 378 yards and two touchdowns. In the final three minutes of the game, the Patriots were down 24–13 before Brady and tight end Benjamin Watson connected on two straight touchdowns to lead the Patriots to a 25–24 win. He won AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance against the Bills.

On October 18, 2009, under blizzard conditions, Brady set an NFL record against the Titans for most touchdowns in a quarter, throwing five in the second quarter. Brady finished the game with six touchdowns, tying his career-high from the 2007 season, and 380 yards, completing 29-of-34 attempts, finishing with a nearly perfect passer rating of 152.8. The Patriots&#x27; 59–0 victory over the Titans tied the record for the largest margin of victory since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger, and set a record for largest halftime lead in NFL history, which was 45–0. He won AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his game against the Titans. Brady was later named AFC Offensive Player of the Month for October. For Week 16, Brady won AFC Offensive Player of the Week for a four-touchdown game in a 35–7 win over the Jaguars.

Brady finished the 2009 regular season with 4,398 yards passing and 28 touchdowns for a 96.2 rating, despite a broken right ring finger and three fractured ribs, which were suffered over the course of the season. He was selected as a reserve to the 2010 Pro Bowl and named the 2009 NFL Comeback Player of the Year.

Brady ended the 2009 season throwing for 154 passing yards, two touchdowns, and three interceptions in a 33–14 Wild Card Round loss to the Baltimore Ravens. This was his first career home playoff loss and the Patriots&#x27; first home playoff loss since 1978.

====2010: Second MVP====

On September 10, 2010, Brady signed a four-year, $72 million contract extension, making him the highest-paid player in the NFL. The extension included $48.5 million in guaranteed money.

Brady became the fastest quarterback to achieve 100 regular season wins by helping his team defeat the Dolphins 41–14 on October 4. On November 25, in a Thanksgiving Day game against the Lions, he earned a perfect passer rating for the second time in his career as the Patriots won 45–24. The next week, a 45–3 victory over the Jets, Brady set a record of 26 consecutive regular-season home wins, breaking Brett Favre&#x27;s record. He won AFC Offensive Player of the Week for the two games against the Lions and Jets. For December, Brady was named AFC Offensive Player of the Month. Brady threw for 3,900 yards with 36 touchdowns and only four interceptions on the season.

Brady was selected as a starter to the 2011 Pro Bowl. However, he pulled out of the game (and was replaced by his former backup Matt Cassel, who then played for the Chiefs) after undergoing surgery for a stress fracture in his right foot dating back to 2008. Brady was also the only unanimous selection for the AP All-Pro Team and was named the 2010 AP NFL Offensive Player of the Year. By unanimous decision, he won the MVP award for the second time in his career. On the inaugural &quot;NFL Top 100 Players&quot; list, Brady was ranked as the best player in the NFL by his peers.

After earning the #1 seed and a bye week, the Patriots lost to the Jets in the Divisional Round, 28–21. Brady finished the game 29-of-45 for 299 yards, two touchdowns, and one interception which ended his NFL record of consecutive pass attempts without an interception at 340.

====2011: Loss in Super Bowl XLVI====

In Week 1 of the 2011 season, Brady threw for a career-high 517 yards, four touchdowns, and one interception in a 38–24 win over the Dolphins and earned AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors. In the game, he threw a record-tying 99-yard touchdown pass to Wes Welker. Brady won AFC Offensive Player of the Week for the following game against the Chargers. He had 423 yards and three touchdowns in the 35–21 victory. Brady closed out the season being named AFC Offensive Player of the Month for November and December. In addition, he was the Week 16 AFC Offensive Player of the Week. Brady had a statistically successful season, and in the regular season finale against the Bills (a 49–21 win), he became the fourth quarterback to throw for 5,000 yards in a season, finishing with 5,235; although Brady surpassed Dan Marino&#x27;s longstanding record of 5,084 passing yards, he finished the season second in passing yards behind Drew Brees&#x27; 5,476. The Patriots finished the season 13–3 and clinched the AFC&#x27;s #1 seed. For his efforts in the 2011 season, Brady was named to the Pro Bowl and was named as the fourth-best player in the NFL on the &quot;NFL Top 100 Players of 2012&quot; by his peers.

Brady led the Patriots to a 45–10 win over the Broncos in the Divisional Round, where he tied an NFL playoff record shared by Daryle Lamonica and Steve Young, throwing for six touchdown passes. The win gave Brady and Patriots head coach Bill Belichick sole possession of the NFL record for postseason wins by a quarterback–head coach duo with 15. In the AFC Championship game against the Ravens, Brady failed to throw a touchdown pass for the first time in 36 games, though he did score a one-yard rushing touchdown late in the game. A missed field goal from Ravens kicker Billy Cundiff gave Brady and the Patriots a 23–20 victory, sending Brady to his fifth Super Bowl.

In Super Bowl XLVI, Brady and the Patriots met the Giants in a rematch of Super Bowl XLII, which the Giants won 21–17. On the Patriots&#x27; first offensive series, Brady was penalized for intentional grounding in the end zone, giving up a safety which gave the Giants an early 2–0 lead. Brady would bounce back from this early blunder, leading a Super Bowl record-tying 96-yard touchdown drive to close the first half and at one point completing 16 consecutive passes to give him a 20-of-23 mark partway into the third quarter, another Super Bowl record. However, as was also the case four years earlier, the Patriots could not hold a late lead and allowed Eli Manning to lead the Giants to a game-winning touchdown with less than a minute left, giving Brady his second career Super Bowl loss.

====2012 and 2013 seasons====
Brady started all 16 regular season games of the 2012 season and led the Patriots to a 12–4 record. He earned AFC Offensive Player of the Week three times that year in Weeks 4, 8, and 14. He became the first quarterback to lead his team to ten division titles. With a 557-point total, the Patriots became the first team to score at least 500 points in a season four different times, with Brady leading all four squads, also a record. He finished the season with 4,827 passing yards, 34 touchdowns, only eight interceptions, and a passer rating of 98.7. Brady was named to the Pro Bowl for the eighth time in his career. On the &quot;NFL Top 100 Players of 2013&quot;, Brady was ranked fourth by his fellow players for the second consecutive year.

Brady led the Patriots to a 41–28 win over the Houston Texans in the Divisional Round. With the victory, Brady surpassed Joe Montana for most career playoff wins, with 17. The Patriots were then upset by the eventual Super Bowl XLVII champion Ravens, 28–13, in the AFC Championship. He suffered his first career loss at home when leading by halftime, in which he was previously 67–0.

On February 25, 2013, Brady and the Patriots agreed on a three-year contract extension, which kept him with the team through 2017. Sportswriter Peter King called it an &quot;amazing&quot; deal and also noted that it reflected Patriots owner Robert Kraft&#x27;s desire to make sure that Brady retired as a Patriot.
Brady and the Patriots began the season with much upheaval on the offensive side of the ball. Tight end Rob Gronkowski was injured and Aaron Hernandez was arrested. Wes Welker departed to the Broncos, Danny Woodhead left in free agency for the Chargers, and Brandon Lloyd was released from the team. In order to replace the five players, the Patriots signed Danny Amendola in free agency from the Rams, drafted rookie wide receivers Aaron Dobson and Josh Boyce, and signed undrafted rookie free agent wide receiver Kenbrell Thompkins. In the first two games of the season, Brady completed 52% of his passes and had three touchdowns and one interception.

Brady was in pursuit of Drew Brees&#x27; record of at least one touchdown in 54 consecutive regular season games and saw the streak end at 52 games in a Week 5 13–6 loss against the Bengals. Brady earned AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his Week 12 overtime victory over the Broncos.

Brady and the Patriots would go on to finish the season well, as Brady was named to the Pro Bowl for the ninth time in his career and was ranked third on the &quot;NFL Top 100 Players of 2014&quot; list in the off-season. The Patriots finished the season 12–4 to earn the second seed in the AFC and a first-round bye. In the Divisional Round matchup against the Colts, Brady made his 25th playoff appearance, breaking Brett Favre&#x27;s career record for playoff appearances by a quarterback. The Patriots won 43–22 behind a four-touchdown performance from running back LeGarrette Blount. The following week, the Patriots lost 26–16 to the Broncos in the AFC Championship.

====2014: Fourth Super Bowl win====

Brady started the 2014 season with a 33–20 loss to the Dolphins. It was Brady&#x27;s first opening day loss since the 2003 season. After going 2–1 in the next three games, Brady helped lead the Patriots to a seven-game winning streak. In that stretch, Brady had two games with four touchdown passes and one game with five. He won AFC Offensive Player of the Month for October. Brady clinched his NFL record 12th AFC East division title with a Week 14 win against the San Diego Chargers, later in the season. Brady was named to his tenth career Pro Bowl and was ranked third by his fellow players on the &quot;NFL Top 100 Players of 2015&quot; list.

In a 35–31 Divisional Round win over the Ravens, Brady threw for three touchdowns and ran in a fourth, breaking Curtis Martin&#x27;s club record for rushing touchdowns in the playoffs; Brady also broke Joe Montana&#x27;s record for playoff touchdowns with 46. After the Ravens scored on their first two possessions, the Patriots were quickly down 14–0, but would end up tying the game 14–14. Brady threw an interception at the end of the first half, which wound up leading to a Baltimore 21–14 halftime lead. Down 28–14, Brady engineered an 80-yard drive, culminating in a touchdown to Rob Gronkowski to cut the lead to 28–21. The Patriots tied the game once again at 28 off of a trick play where Brady passed laterally to Julian Edelman who then threw a 51-yard touchdown to Amendola. Ravens kicker Justin Tucker converted a 25-yard field goal to give Baltimore a 31–28 fourth quarter lead. Brady got the ball back, and threw a 23-yard touchdown to wide receiver Brandon LaFell to give the Patriots their first lead, 35–31, with 5:13 remaining. After a Duron Harmon interception and a Joe Flacco Hail Mary attempt failed, Brady clinched his record ninth AFC Championship Game appearance. It was his fourth straight overall. After a 45–7 blowout of the Colts, Brady advanced to play in his sixth Super Bowl, breaking a tie with John Elway for most career Super Bowl appearances by a quarterback.

In Super Bowl XLIX, Brady completed 37-of-50 passes for 328 yards, four touchdowns, and two interceptions. He guided a then-record ten-point fourth quarter comeback as the Patriots defeated the Seattle Seahawks 28–24 to give Brady his fourth Super Bowl ring, tying him with Joe Montana and Terry Bradshaw for most Super Bowl victories by a starting quarterback. He was named Super Bowl MVP for the third time, tying Montana&#x27;s record. Brady&#x27;s 37 completed passes in the game set a Super Bowl record at the time, which Brady himself would break in Super Bowl LI two years later.

=====Deflategate report=====
On May 6, 2015, the NFL published a 243-page report regarding the deflation of footballs used in the previous season&#x27;s AFC Championship Game. The report concluded that, more likely than not, Brady was at least generally aware of the intentional deflation. On May 11, Brady was suspended for four games by the NFL for his involvement based on &quot;substantial and credible evidence&quot; that Brady knew Patriots employees were deflating footballs and that he was uncooperative with the investigators. That day, Troy Vincent—NFL Executive Vice President of Football Operations—penned a letter to Brady that stated in part: &quot;Your actions as set forth in the report clearly constitute conduct detrimental to the integrity of and public confidence in the game of professional football.&quot; Brady, through the NFL Players Association, appealed the suspension on May 14.

On July 28, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell upheld Brady&#x27;s four-game suspension. Goodell cited Brady&#x27;s destruction of his cell phone as a critical factor in his decision to uphold Brady&#x27;s suspension. The NFL also filed papers in federal court seeking to confirm Roger Goodell&#x27;s decision. Brady gave permission to the NFLPA to appeal the suspension in federal court, and released a statement on his Facebook page that expressed disappointment in and criticism of Goodell&#x27;s decision to uphold the suspension.

Commentary on the initial punishment was mixed. Bleacher Report writer Mike Freeman made a statement agreeing with Goodell&#x27;s decision, saying the penalties were &quot;brutal, but it deserved to be&quot;. Various commentators also implied that the prior reputation of the Patriots organization as a team that bends rules appeared to factor into the harshness of the punishment. Others described the punishment as &quot;firm but fair&quot;.

On September 3, Judge Richard M. Berman of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York vacated Brady&#x27;s suspension; this ruling allowed Brady to play in the first four games of the 2015 NFL season. In his decision, Judge Berman cited the NFL&#x27;s failure to provide proper notice to Brady of the charges against him and the potential for a suspension. Post-appeal commentary also criticized Goodell for &quot;manipulating Brady&#x27;s testimony&quot; at the appeal hearing in his decision.

In February 2022, sportswriter Mike Florio revealed that the NFL falsified data and hid information that would have cleared Brady and the Patriots of wrongdoing. In his book &quot;Playmakers: How the NFL Really Works (And Doesn&#x27;t)&quot;, Florio revealed that NFL executives, specifically vice president Troy Vincent, jumped to conclusions about the air pressure inside the Patriots&#x27; footballs at halftime of the AFC Championship game. He also noted that 11 of the 12 Patriot footballs used in the game were actually not outside the predicted range of Ideal Gas Law, and the other was only slightly below. 

Florio also revealed that NFL general counsel Jeff Pash ordered that the records of all PSI data gathered from the 2015 season be deleted. Leaked transcripts revealed that NFL senior VP of football operations Dave Gardi used false numbers in his letter to the Patriots which ordered that the team was to be investigated. It was also shown that Vincent did not instruct anyone to record the timing of the measurements taken, the temperature in the room during testing, if the footballs tested were wet or dry, and that he did not know which of the two air pressure gauges was used to make the pregame measurements. Vincent also admitted that he and other NFL executives never heard of the Ideal Gas Law and were unaware that PSI in a football can change in certain environments.

====2015 season====

In the NFL Kickoff Game, Brady led the Patriots to a 28–21 win over the Steelers. He threw for 288 yards and four touchdowns, three of them to Rob Gronkowski. The Patriots&#x27; victory was the 161st victory of Brady&#x27;s career, all with the Patriots, which surpassed the record held by former Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre for most regular season wins by a starting quarterback with a single team. In Week 2, Brady threw for 466 yards and three touchdowns in a 40–32 win against the Bills. Through the first five games of the season, Brady threw a total of 14 touchdowns with one interception and had a quarterback rating of 118.4. Brady was named AFC Offensive Player of the Month for September. In Week 8, a 36–7 victory over the Dolphins, he had 356 passing yards and four touchdowns to earn his 25th career AFC Offensive Player of the Week title.

Despite Brady&#x27;s success, the Patriots were hit by many injuries to key players on offense, including wide receiver Julian Edelman, and the Patriots eventually lost their first game against the Broncos 30–24 in overtime, who were without Peyton Manning, in Denver following a 10–0 start. The Patriots then lost three of their remaining five games to finish 12–4 for a fourth straight season, earning the 2-seed in the AFC. Brady finished the regular season with a league-leading 36 touchdown passes and seven interceptions. He was named to his 11th Pro Bowl (seventh straight), and was ranked as the second best player on the &quot;NFL Top 100 Players of 2016&quot; behind only league MVP Cam Newton.

With the return of Julian Edelman from a foot injury, the Patriots defeated the Chiefs in the Divisional Round by a score of 27–20 after advancing with a first round bye. Brady completed 28 of 42 passes for 302 yards and two passing touchdowns and one rushing touchdown as he led the team to their fifth consecutive appearance in the AFC Championship. The Patriots advanced to the AFC Championship to face Peyton Manning and the Broncos at Sports Authority Field at Mile High. It would turn out to be the 17th and final meeting between the two storied quarterbacks, as Manning would announce his retirement after the season ended. The Broncos&#x27; top-ranked defense limited Brady, who completed 27-of-56 passes, for 310 yards, two interceptions and a passing touchdown, all day, and the Patriots eventually lost the game 20–18 after a potential game-tying two-point conversion attempt failed with less than half a minute remaining.

=====Deflategate suspension=====
On February 29, 2016, Brady signed a two-year contract extension covering the 2018 and 2019 seasons. On March 3, the NFL appealed Judge Richard M. Berman&#x27;s 2015 decision to vacate Brady&#x27;s four-game suspension as punishment for his alleged role in the Deflategate scandal. At the hearing, the three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit questioned Players Association lawyer Jeffrey L. Kessler and NFL lawyer Paul Clement, with Circuit Judge Denny Chin stating that &quot;the evidence of ball tampering is compelling, if not overwhelming.&quot;

On April 25, the decision to vacate Brady&#x27;s four-game suspension was overturned by the U.S. Appeals Court. Circuit Judge Barrington Daniels Parker Jr., joined by Circuit Judge Chin, wrote that they could not &quot;second-guess&quot; the arbitration but were merely determining it &quot;met the minimum legal standards established by the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947&quot;. Circuit Chief Judge Robert Katzmann dissented, writing that the NFL&#x27;s fines for using stickum was &quot;highly analogous&quot; and that here &quot;the Commissioner was doling out his own brand of industrial justice.&quot; On May 23, Brady appealed for his case to be reheard by the full U.S. 2nd Circuit Court. The 2nd Circuit Court denied Brady&#x27;s request for an &quot;en banc&quot; hearing on July 13. On July 15, Brady announced that he would give up his Deflategate fight and accept his suspension for the first four regular season games of the 2016 season.

====2016: Fifth Super Bowl win====

After serving his four-game suspension, Brady made his 2016 season debut on October 9 on the road against the Browns; he completed 28-of-40 passes for 406 yards and three touchdowns in a 33–13 victory to earn AFC Offensive Player of the Week. Brady&#x27;s outstanding numbers during his first four games following the suspension earned him the AFC Offensive Player of the Month award for October.

In Week 11, Brady recorded four touchdowns and no interceptions in a 30–17 road win against the 49ers. Those four touchdown passes gave him a total of 444 career regular season touchdown passes with one team, breaking Brett Favre&#x27;s record with the Green Bay Packers. The following week, Brady completed 30-of-50 passes for 286 yards and two touchdowns in a 22–17 road victory against the Jets. The win was also the Patriots&#x27; 500th victory (including playoffs) in franchise history. During this victory, Brady also became the fifth quarterback to record 60,000 career regular season passing yards, joining Peyton Manning, Brett Favre, Drew Brees, and Dan Marino. The following week, Brady and the Patriots defeated the Los Angeles Rams by a score of 26–10, giving Brady his record-201st career victory, including playoff games.

With a 16–3 victory over the Broncos, the Patriots clinched an eighth consecutive AFC East title and a seventh consecutive first-round bye in the playoffs, both NFL records. On December 20, 2016, Brady was named to the Pro Bowl for the eighth straight season and 12th time overall. Brady ended the regular season with 28 passing touchdowns and only two interceptions for the regular season, breaking the previous TD:INT ratio record of Nick Foles&#x27;s 27:2 figure set in 2013 with the Eagles. Brady was named to the AP All-Pro Second Team. Brady was also ranked first on the &quot;NFL Top 100 Players of 2017&quot; as the best player in the league, becoming the first player to be named as #1 twice since the listing began.

Brady and the Patriots began their postseason run in the Divisional Round, hosting the Texans, which held the league&#x27;s No. 1 total defense. Brady completed 18-of-38 passes for 287 yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions as the Patriots won 34–16, clinching a record sixth consecutive trip to the AFC Championship Game. In the AFC Championship, the Patriots hosted the Steelers. Brady completed 32-of-42 passes for 384 yards, three touchdowns, and no interceptions in the 36–17 victory. The win gave Brady and Patriots head coach Bill Belichick their record seventh conference title as a quarterback–head coach tandem, and the Patriots an NFL record ninth Super Bowl appearance.

Brady and the Patriots faced the NFC champion Atlanta Falcons, who boasted the league&#x27;s highest-scoring offense, in Super Bowl LI. Brady threw for 43 completions on 62 attempts for 466 passing yards—all Super Bowl records at the time. Brady also threw for two touchdowns and an interception, which was returned for a touchdown by Robert Alford in the second quarter. After trailing 28–3 midway through the third quarter, Brady and the Patriots scored 25 unanswered points to tie the game at the end of regulation. This resulted in the first overtime in Super Bowl history. After winning the overtime coin toss, Brady led the Patriots down the field to score a touchdown and win the game by a score of 34–28, completing the largest comeback win in both team history and Super Bowl history. With the victory, Brady won his fifth Super Bowl, which set a record for most Super Bowl victories of any quarterback in history and tied defensive player Charles Haley for the most Super Bowl victories for any player. In addition, Brady set another record by winning his fourth Super Bowl MVP award for his clutch performance. On a personal note, this game was also special for Brady because it was the first game this season that his mother had attended in person, after having been previously diagnosed with cancer.

====2017: Third MVP and loss in Super Bowl LII====
On May 12, 2017, Brady was announced as the cover athlete for &quot;Madden NFL 18.&quot; In a CBS interview on May 17, Charlie Rose asked Brady&#x27;s wife, Gisele Bündchen, if she wanted Brady to retire, despite the fact that he was still playing at a high level. Bündchen mentioned that Brady suffered from a concussion in 2016, saying, &quot;I mean he has concussions pretty much every—I mean we don&#x27;t talk about—but he does have concussions. I don&#x27;t really think it&#x27;s a healthy thing for anybody to go through.&quot; Following the Bündchen interview, the NFL released a statement: &quot;We have reviewed all reports relating to Tom Brady from the unaffiliated neurotrauma consultants and certified athletic trainer spotters who worked at Patriots&#x27; home and away 2016 season games as well as club injury reports that were sent to the league office. There are no records that indicate that Mr. Brady suffered a head injury or concussion, or exhibited or complained of concussion symptoms. Today we have been in contact with the NFLPA and will work together to gather more information from the club&#x27;s medical staff and Mr. Brady&quot;. Brady&#x27;s agent, Don Yee, said that Brady was not diagnosed with a concussion during the 2016 season.

The Patriots opened up their 2017 season with a 42–27 loss in the NFL Kickoff Game to the Chiefs. In Week 2, Brady&#x27;s three touchdown passes and 447 passing yards in a 36–20 win over the New Orleans Saints earned him his 28th AFC Offensive Player of the Week award, breaking the record previously held by Peyton Manning for the most AFC Offensive Player of the Week awards in a career. He won the AFC Offensive Player of the Week again in the following week for his 378-yard, five-touchdown game in a 36–33 win over the Texans. In Week 6, the Patriots defeated the Jets, 24–17. Brady obtained his 187th career win, setting the record for most regular season wins in NFL history. In Week 10, Brady won his third AFC Offensive Player of the Month for his three-touchdown game in a 41–16 win over the Broncos. For the month of November, Brady won AFC Offensive Player of the Month. On December 19, Brady was selected to the Pro Bowl for the 13th time in his career. At age 40, Brady became the oldest quarterback ever to start all of his team&#x27;s games in an NFL regular season. Brady finished the regular season with a league-leading 4,577 passing yards, making him the oldest player ever to lead the league in passing yards. He was named a first-team All-Pro by the Associated Press for the third time in his career. Earning 40 of 50 votes, Brady was named the NFL Most Valuable Player for the third time in his career. For the second straight year and third time overall, Brady was ranked No. 1 by his fellow players on the &quot;NFL Top 100 Players of 2018&quot;.
Brady and the Patriots began their postseason run by defeating the Titans, 35–14, in the Divisional Round of the playoffs. With the win, the Patriots advanced to the AFC Championship Game for the seventh straight year. Days after the divisional round, it was revealed that Brady had a minor cut on his right hand, which required stitches. Despite this injury, Brady managed to start the AFC Championship Game, where the Patriots hosted the Jaguars. Brady led a fourth quarter comeback to lead the Patriots to a 24–20 victory. The win gave Brady and Patriots head coach Bill Belichick their eighth conference title as a quarterback–head coach tandem, and the Patriots a berth in Super Bowl LII, their tenth Super Bowl appearance as a team, both of which extended NFL records.

In Super Bowl LII, the Patriots faced the Eagles and their second-string quarterback Nick Foles. Brady completed 28-of-48 attempts for three passing touchdowns, no interceptions, and a Super Bowl record 505 yards–which set a new postseason game record for the most passing yards in NFL history. With roughly two minutes remaining in the game and the Eagles leading 38–33, Brady was strip-sacked by Brandon Graham. The Eagles recovered the fumble and cemented their 41–33 win with a field goal, securing their first franchise Super Bowl victory in a game with the most combined total yardage in NFL history. This was the third time overall that Brady had lost in a Super Bowl, becoming the fourth starting quarterback in Super Bowl history to lose at least three Super Bowls joining Jim Kelly, Fran Tarkenton, and John Elway.

==== 2018–2019: Sixth Super Bowl win and last years with New England ====
Brady started his 19th NFL season with 277 passing yards, three touchdowns, and one interception in a 27–20 victory over the Texans in the season opener. In Week 5, in a 38–24 win against the Colts, Brady&#x27;s 500th career touchdown pass went to Josh Gordon, who became the 71st different player to catch a touchdown from Brady, breaking a record previously held by Vinny Testaverde. In Week 6, in a 43–40 win against the Chiefs, Brady secured his 200th career regular season win, making him the only quarterback in NFL history to accomplish that feat. In Week 15, Brady reached 70,000 passing yards, becoming the fourth quarterback in NFL history to accomplish the feat. During Week 16 against the Bills, Brady was limited to 126 passing yards, but the Patriots won 24–12, clinching the AFC East pennant for the 10th consecutive season and 16th time in 18 years. In Week 17, Brady helped the Patriots clinch a first-round bye, with a 38–3 win against the Jets. Brady finished the season completing 375-of-570 passes, 4,355 yards, 29 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions. He earned his 14th career Pro Bowl nomination. He was ranked sixth by his fellow players on the &quot;NFL Top 100 Players of 2019&quot;.

Following their first-round bye, the Patriots started their playoff run at home against the Los Angeles Chargers in the Divisional Round. The Patriots jumped out to a 35–7 halftime lead en route to a 41–28 win. With the win, the Patriots advanced to the AFC Championship Game for an eighth consecutive year, this time to face the Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium. The Patriots went into halftime with a 14–0 lead. However, the Chiefs led by young quarterback Patrick Mahomes battled back in the second half and sent the game into overtime with a score of 31–31. The Patriots won the coin toss to start overtime and elected to receive the ball. Brady led the Patriots on a 75-yard drive that resulted in a game-winning two-yard rushing touchdown by Rex Burkhead, to win the game 3731. With the victory, Brady earned a third consecutive and ninth overall Super Bowl appearance for his career.

In Super Bowl LIII, Brady completed 21-of-35 passes for 262 passing yards and an interception as the Patriots won 13–3 over the Rams in the lowest-scoring Super Bowl in history. This was the first time in his nine Super Bowl appearances in which Brady did not have a passing touchdown, though with the game tied 3–3 and less than eight minutes left he successfully connected with Rob Gronkowski down the sideline between three defenders to set up the go-ahead touchdown. With the victory, the Patriots became the second NFL team to win six Super Bowls, tying the Steelers for the most in NFL history. In addition, Brady became the oldest quarterback at41 years of age to win a Super Bowl, as well as the first player ever to win six Super Bowls, breaking a tie with Charles Haley.

On August 4, 2019, Brady signed a two-year contract extension worth $70million through the 2021 season; the terms of the contract allowed Brady to become a free agent after the 2019 season. Against the 2019 Patriots salary cap, Brady was the highest-paid player on the team at $21.5million. Belichick was unwilling to offer a longer-term deal that Brady sought.

Brady began the season by completing24 of36 passes for 341 yards and three touchdowns in a 33–3 win over the Steelers. During a 33–7 victory against the Washington Redskins in Week5, Brady surpassed Brett Favre for third place on the all-time passing yards list. The following week in a 35–14 win against the Giants, Brady overtook Peyton Manning for second place on the all-time passing yards list, behind only Drew Brees. Although the Patriots&#x27; defense was performing well, the offense was notedly stagnant, and Brady told friends that he &quot;felt Belichick had taken the offense for granted because of how good it had been for so long&quot;; he said to NBC that he was the &quot;most miserable8–0 quarterback in the NFL.&quot; Brady and the Patriots struggled during the second half of the season, losing three of their next five games following the 8–0 start, including back-to-back losses in Weeks13 and 14 against the Texans (28–22) and Chiefs (23–16). In Week17, Brady&#x27;s final regular-season game as a Patriot, he threw for 221 yards and two touchdowns, but also threw an interception that was returned by former Patriots teammate Eric Rowe for a touchdown in a 27–24 loss to the Miami Dolphins. Although the Patriots finished the regular season with a 12–4 record and won the AFC East for the 11th consecutive year, this loss, combined with a win by the Chiefs, denied New England a first-round bye for the first time since 2009. Personally, however, Brady passed Peyton Manning for the second-most touchdown passes in NFL history, with 541.

The Patriots began their postseason run in the Wild Card Round, where they faced the Titans. With his team trailing 14–13 and pinned back on its 1-yard line with15 seconds left in the game, Brady&#x27;s final pass attempt of the gameand his last as a Patriotwas intercepted and returned for a touchdown by Titans cornerback and former teammate Logan Ryan, which effectively sealed the 20–13 win for Tennessee. During the NFL&#x27;s celebration of their 100th season, Brady was named to the NFL 100 All-Time Team. He was ranked 14th by his fellow players on the &quot;NFL Top 100 Players of 2020&quot;.

On March 17, 2020, the day before his contract with the Patriots expired, Brady announced that he would not re-sign with the team for the 2020 season, ending his 20-year tenure in New England. After Brady signed with Tampa Bay, billboards thanking Brady for his services were posted alongside the Massachusetts Turnpike and eleven other locations around New England.

===Tampa Bay Buccaneers===
====2020 season: Seventh Super Bowl win====

Brady signed with the Buccaneers on March 20, 2020. The two-year contract was worth $50 million in fully guaranteed money, with up to $4.5 million each year in incentives. The deal included a no-trade and a no-franchise tag clause. Although his career number of 12 was assigned to Chris Godwin, Godwin offered it to Brady as a sign of respect and switched his number to 14. In April 2020, Brady was reunited with former Patriots teammate Rob Gronkowski when the tight end came out of retirement and was traded to the Buccaneers. Head coach Bruce Arians stated that it was Brady who was adamant for the team to trade for Gronkowski.

Making his Buccaneers debut in New Orleans against the Saints on September 13, Brady completed 23-of-36 passes for 239 yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions, and additionally scored a rushing touchdown as the Saints defeated the Buccaneers 34–23. Brady bounced back with three solid performances as the Buccaneers won their next three games, including a Week 4 performance against the Chargers in which he completed 30 of 46 passes for 369 yards, five touchdowns, and an interception. Brady&#x27;s five touchdowns in the Buccaneers&#x27; 38–31 win against the Chargers marked the seventh time in his career he had five touchdowns in a game and, at age 43, made him the oldest quarterback to have a five-touchdown game. Brady&#x27;s Week 4 performance earned him the NFC Offensive Player of the Week award for the first time in his career. For the month of October, Brady won NFC Offensive Player of the Month. In Week 9 against New Orleans, Brady threw for 209 yards and three interceptions during the 38–3 loss. This was the most lopsided loss of Brady&#x27;s career, as well as the first time in his 20-year career that he had been swept by a divisional opponent.

Brady later said that playing behind closed doors from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the NFL made it easier for him to execute his new team&#x27;s unfamiliar football playbook. In Week 16 against the Lions, Brady completed 22-of-27 attempts with 348 yards, four touchdowns, and a perfect passer rating of 158.3 in the first half before being rested in the second half of the 47–7 victory. The win ended a 13-year playoff drought for the Buccaneers. Overall, he finished the 2020 season with 4,633 passing yards, 40 passing touchdowns, and 12 interceptions. Due to the Saints winning the division, the Buccaneers settled for a wild card spot, marking a career-first for Brady.

In the Wild Card Round against the Washington Football Team, Brady threw for 381 yards and two touchdowns in the 31–23 win. During the game, he became the oldest player to throw a touchdown pass in NFL postseason history. In the Divisional Round against the Saints, Brady threw for 199 yards and two touchdowns and rushed for a touchdown in the 30–20 win. As Brady and Saints quarterback Drew Brees were both over 40 years old and were first and second in career touchdown passes and career passing yards, the game was hyped as the potential final matchup between the two stars (which it indeed turned out to be, as Brees retired following the season). Brady extended his record of Conference Championship game appearances to 14. In the NFC Championship, Brady threw for 280 yards, three touchdowns and three interceptions in a 31–26 win over Aaron Rodgers and the Packers at Lambeau Field. It was another highly anticipated matchup since Brady and Rodgers were two of the most statistically efficient quarterbacks, and this was their first postseason matchup. The win gave Brady his record-extending tenth Super Bowl appearance, making Brady the fourth quarterback to lead two different teams to the Super Bowl, joining Craig Morton, Kurt Warner, and Peyton Manning, and the second after Morton to reach the Super Bowl from both conferences. The Buccaneers became the first team to play in a Super Bowl in its home stadium.

Super Bowl LV was the first title game where both starting quarterbacks, Brady and his opposing counterpart Patrick Mahomes, have won the AP NFL MVP and Super Bowl MVP awards; as Brady is Mahomes&#x27; senior by 18 years, some billed the matchup as comparable to Michael Jordan versus LeBron James. Brady threw for 201 yards and three touchdowns in Tampa Bay&#x27;s 31–9 win over the Chiefs. He had led the Buccaneers to become only the seventh Wild Card team to win the Super Bowl and only the fifth to do so by winning three road games. Brady was awarded Super Bowl MVP for the game. His two touchdown passes to tight end Rob Gronkowski set a record for most postseason touchdown passes for a passer-receiver duo, with 14, breaking the mark previously held by Joe Montana and Jerry Rice. Brady extended his record for most Super Bowl wins by a player with his seventh and extended his record for Super Bowl MVP awards, with five. Brady became the second quarterback, joining Peyton Manning, to lead two different teams to Super Bowl wins, but the first to win Super Bowl MVP with two different teams. He was the first quarterback to win the Super Bowl with teams from different conferences. Brady became the player with the most championships in NFL history and tied Otto Graham for the most league championships in professional football history by a player at seven. With the win, Brady became the oldest quarterback in Super Bowl history to start, play, win, and receive the MVP award. He was ranked seventh by his fellow players on the &quot;NFL Top 100 Players of 2021&quot;.

====2021 season====

On February 11, 2021, it was revealed that Brady had knee discomfort through most of the 2020 season and would require a minor arthroscopy for a routine cleanup. Brady signed a one-year contract extension through the 2022 season with the Buccaneers on March 12, 2021. On July 15, it was revealed that Brady had a torn MCL in the knee that had to undergo surgery, an injury that had plagued him for the entire 2020 season. The NFL declined to comment on the Buccaneers&#x27; failure to disclose this injury.

In the NFL Kickoff Game against the Cowboys, Brady threw for 379 yards, four touchdowns, and two interceptions leading the Buccaneers to a 31–29 win. Brady and tight end Rob Gronkowski became the second passer-receiver duo to record 100 touchdown passes, joining Peyton Manning and Marvin Harrison. In Week 3, against the Rams, Brady threw for 432 yards, and had two touchdowns, and joined Drew Brees as the only players in NFL history to record 80,000 passing yards during the 34–24 loss. In his return to New England in Week 4 against Belichick and rookie quarterback Mac Jones, Brady surpassed Brees, who coincidentally was on the sidelines as an analyst for &quot;NBC Sunday Night Football&quot;, for the most passing yards in National Football League history. He broke the record on a 28-yard completion to Mike Evans in the first quarter. With the victory over his former team, Brady became the fourth quarterback in NFL history to record a win against all 32 current teams in the league, joining Brett Favre, Peyton Manning, and Drew Brees. In addition, he became the sixth quarterback to have a victory against every incumbent NFL franchise after Fran Tarkenton and Joe Montana, as the league only had 28 teams during the latter two&#x27;s respective tenures.

In Week 5, Brady threw for 411 yards and five touchdowns in a 45–17 win over the Dolphins, earning NFC Offensive Player of the Week. In Week 7, Brady became the first quarterback in NFL history to record 600 touchdown passes, with a nine-yard pass to Evans in a win against the Chicago Bears. In Week 14, Brady surpassed Brees for most all-time pass completions list in NFL history and became the first quarterback to record 700 touchdown passes in regular season and postseason combined with a game-winning 58-yard pass to Breshad Perriman against the Bills. Brady finished the 2021 season with an NFL record 485 pass completions for a career-high 5,316 passing yards, 43 passing touchdowns, and 12 interceptions. Brady became the oldest player in NFL history to pass for at least 5,000 yards and his passing yards total marked the third-most for a single season in NFL history. He was named to the Pro Bowl for the 15th time.

In the Wild Card Round, the Buccaneers faced off against the Eagles, as a rematch of their Week 6 regular season game. Brady completed 29 of 37 passes for 271 yards and 2 touchdowns as they won 31–15. Brady and the Buccaneers advanced to the Divisional Round to face off against the Rams, to whom they previously lost in the regular season. Brady and the Buccaneers fell behind 27–3 in the third quarter, until Brady was able to lead the team to 24 unanswered points and a tie game; however, the Rams scored a field goal in the closing seconds to defeat the Buccaneers 30–27. Brady finished the game with 329 yards, a touchdown, and an interception. The Rams later went on to win Super Bowl LVI.

Brady announced his retirement on February 1, 2022, after 22 seasons. In Brady&#x27;s first two years with Tampa, the Buccaneers posted a regular season record of 24–9, which were the two most successful back-to-back seasons in franchise history. Their 13–4 regular season record in 2021 was the best result in franchise history, eclipsing the 12–4 record of the 2002 Super Bowl winning team. Prior to Brady&#x27;s arrival, the franchise had an all-time playoff record of 6–9; at the time of Brady&#x27;s retirement, the all-time playoff record for Tampa Bay stood at 11–10. He was ranked first by his fellow players on the &quot;NFL Top 100 Players of 2022&quot;, his fourth time being ranked first.

====2022 season====
On March 13, 2022, just 40 days after initially announcing his retirement, Brady announced he would return to the Buccaneers for the 2022 season. In the Buccaneers&#x27; season-opening game against the Cowboys, Brady became the oldest quarterback to start a game in NFL history. In Week 3 against the Packers, Brady became the first quarterback in NFL history to reach 85,000 career passing yards. Brady and the Buccaneers lost in Weeks 6, 7, and 8, dropping the team to 3–5. It was the first three-game losing streak for Brady since his 2002 season with the Patriots. In Week 8 against the Ravens, Brady was sacked by Justin Houston just before halftime. In turn, Brady became the most sacked quarterback in NFL history with 555 sacks taken, passing Ben Roethlisberger.

In Week 9 against the Rams, Brady became the first quarterback in NFL history to reach 100,000 passing yards in his career (combined regular season and postseason). With nine seconds left in regulation, Brady completed a touchdown pass to rookie tight end Cade Otton to win 16–13. The game-winning drive was the 55th of Brady&#x27;s career, passing Peyton Manning for the most all-time. The following week, Brady led the Buccaneers to a 21–16 victory over the Seahawks in a game played in Germany, making Brady the first quarterback to win NFL games in three different countries outside the U.S. (having won games played in England and Mexico while he was with New England).

On November 27, Brady saw a streak end. He was 218–0 when his team was leading by at least seven points in the final two minutes of regulation. Facing the Browns, the Buccaneers led by seven until the final thirty seconds when the Browns tied the game on a touchdown in an eventual overtime win by Cleveland. In a Week 13 matchup against the Saints, Brady threw a touchdown pass to Rachaad White with three seconds remaining to complete a 13-point comeback. This was the second time in Brady&#x27;s career that he had surmounted a fourth quarter deficit of 13-plus points, the first being versus the Falcons in Super Bowl LI when the Patriots came back after being down 28–3 to win in overtime.

In Week 17, against the Panthers, he passed for 432 yards and three touchdowns in the 30–24 victory. In Week 18 against the Falcons, Brady broke his own NFL record for completions in a season, as well as Matthew Stafford&#x27;s 2012 record for pass attempts in a season. However, the Buccaneers lost 30–17, giving Brady his first career losing season as the starter. 2022 marked the first season in which Brady lost eight or more games. Brady was pulled in the second quarter to prevent injury, as the Buccaneers had clinched their playoff position the previous week by winning the NFC South. Against the Dallas Cowboys in the Wild Card Round, Brady passed for 351 yards, two touchdowns, and one interception in the 31–14 loss. In the loss, Brady set postseason single-game franchise records for pass attempts (66) and pass completions (35). The loss to the Cowboys marked the first time since 2013 that Brady lost in the playoffs in consecutive seasons.

===Retirement===
On February 1, 2023, Brady announced on social media that he was retiring &quot;for good&quot;. He filed his retirement papers with the NFL and NFLPA nine days later. During a halftime ceremony on September 10, 2023, the Patriots&#x27; week one game of the 2023 season, Patriots owner Robert Kraft announced that he would waive the traditional four-year post-retirement waiting period required for Brady&#x27;s candidacy to the Patriots Hall of Fame, as well as directly inducting him without the customary ballot. His induction took place on June 12, 2024 (the date chosen in reference for the number of championships Brady won in New England, as June is the sixth month of the year, combined with his jersey number representing the day), in the first ever Patriots Hall of Fame induction ceremony to take place within Gillette Stadium. Brady was also the first person in Gillette Stadium history to become a &quot;Keeper of the Light&quot;, ringing the bell in the newly redesigned lighthouse. With his family in attendance, along with current and former members of the Patriots, Brady delivered a heartfelt speech in front of the crowd, declaring: &quot;All our lives take us on different journeys, they take us to different places, they bring different people into our lives, but one thing I am sure of — and that will never change — is that I am a Patriot for life.&quot;

On June 12, 2024, prior to Brady&#x27;s Patriots Hall of Fame induction ceremony, Governor Maura Healey declared June 12 officially &quot;Tom Brady Day&quot; in Massachusetts. In the presence of his family, former teammates, coaches, friends, as well as a crowd of over 60,000 fans at Gillette Stadium, the Patriots celebrated Brady&#x27;s career with the franchise in a dedicated three-hour event. After multiple speaker panels and video tributes, he was inducted as the 35th member of the Patriots Hall of Fame. In addition to his induction, Kraft announced that the franchise would formally retire Brady&#x27;s number 12 jersey and revealed that a 12-feet-tall statue of Brady was being constructed to be placed at the Patriots Hall of Fame building.

==Broadcasting career==
On May 10, 2022, Fox Sports announced that Brady would join the network as the lead color commentator. Brady&#x27;s deal with Fox will reportedly pay him $375 million over 10 years, making Brady the highest paid sports commentator in history. Brady began his broadcasting career during the 2024 UFL Championship Game&#x27;s second quarter, and made his &quot;NFL on Fox&quot; debut alongside play caller Kevin Burkhardt starting with the 2024 NFL season. Brady was also a part of the Fox broadcast team for Super Bowl LIX.

However, the NFL has put several restrictions on Brady after he submitted a bid to become part owner of the Las Vegas Raiders. Brady may not attend in-person or online broadcast production meetings, nor is he allowed to have access to team facilities, coaches, or players. He also must follow rules in the NFL constitution and bylaws that prohibit owners or prospective owners from publicly criticizing game officials and other teams.

In May 2023, Brady and his business partner, Knighthead Capital Management co-founder Tom Wagner, entered into an agreement to purchase 10% of the Las Vegas Raiders from majority owner Mark Davis. However, the original deal was initially delayed due to concerns from NFL owners that Brady was receiving too big of a discount from Davis. On October 15, 2024, a revised agreement was unanimously approved by NFL owners, with Brady owning a 5% stake and Wagner also owning a 5% stake.

On September 6, 2023, it was announced that Delta Air Lines had hired Brady as a strategic advisor. In January 2024, Brady agreed to merge his health and apparel brands with NoBull and to become its second largest shareholder.

== Personal life ==

Brady was raised as Catholic, but in a 2015 interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, expressed he was less religious than he is spiritual.

During his career with the Patriots, Brady and his family lived in the Boston suburb of Brookline, Massachusetts, and in New York City. They own several homes and spend time during the summer at the Yellowstone Club near Big Sky, Montana, and at their home at Silo Ridge in Amenia, New York. When Brady signed with the Buccaneers, he rented a mansion in Tampa, Florida. In December 2020, Brady and Bündchen reportedly bought a home in Indian Creek, Florida.
===Family and relationships===

Brady dated actress Bridget Moynahan from 2004 until early December 2006. Brady and Moynahan ended their relationship soon after Moynahan became pregnant. On February 18, 2007, Moynahan confirmed to &quot;People&quot; magazine that she was more than three months pregnant with Brady&#x27;s child. Their son, John Edward Thomas &quot;Jack&quot; Moynahan, was born in August 2007.

Brady began dating Brazilian model Gisele Bündchen in December 2006. Brady and Bündchen married on February26, 2009, in a Catholic ceremony at St. Monica Catholic Church in Santa Monica, California. Together, they have two children: a son, Benjamin Rein Brady, born in December 2009, and a daughter, Vivian Lake Brady, born in December 2012. In October 2022, the couple announced their divorce.

Brady and baseball player Kevin Youkilis became brothers-in-law in 2012 when Youkilis married Brady&#x27;s sister Julie. Brady&#x27;s niece, Maya Brady, is a college softball player for the UCLA Bruins. Brady is also a distant cousin of former MLB pitcher and left fielder Pete Meegan.

=== Politics ===

Brady attended the 2004 State of the Union Address as a special guest of then-President George W. Bush. Brady told &quot;ESPN The Magazine&quot; in 2004 that being a U.S. Senator would be his &quot;craziest ambition.&quot;
Brady is a friend of current President Donald Trump. At a political event in New Hampshire on the day before the 2016 presidential election, Trump said he had received a call from Brady, and that Brady told him: &quot;Donald, I support you, you&#x27;re my friend, and I voted for you.&quot; However, after his wife was asked directly on Instagram whether she and Brady backed Trump, Bündchen answered &quot;NO!&quot; After a Trump campaign &quot;Make America Great Again&quot; cap was photographed in Brady&#x27;s locker, Brady said that Bündchen told him to not discuss politics anymore, which he thought was a &quot;good decision.&quot; Brady did not join the New England Patriots in visiting Trump at the White House in April 2017 after their Super Bowl victory, citing &quot;personal family matters.&quot;

In an interview with Howard Stern on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; in April 2020, Brady explained that Trump had reached out to him to speak at the 2016 Republican National Convention, and that he declined, saying, &quot;It was uncomfortable for me because you can&#x27;t undo things, not that I would undo a friendship, but political support is totally different than the support of a friend.&quot; Brady said that he has known Trump since 2001 and that Trump asked him to be a judge in the Miss USA pageant, after Brady led the Patriots to victory in Super Bowl XXXVI. Brady explained that Trump used to come to Patriots games and would call him and golf with him occasionally. However, Brady said that he did not see the benefit of getting involved in an event as polarizing as a presidential election. Brady said in 2022 that he had not spoken with Trump in &quot;years&quot; and that his relationship with Trump had been mischaracterized by the media.

While there has been speculation that Brady would run for political office, in a 2015 interview he stated he had no interest in doing so. Brady reiterated in 2022 that he would avoid a political career because, &quot;I don&#x27;t think anyone&#x27;s fond of politics these days.&quot;

In 2018, Brady endorsed Republican Helen Brady (no relation) for State Auditor of Massachusetts.

=== Diet and lifestyle ===

Brady&#x27;s health regimen includes transcendental meditation, yoga, hydrating, an 80/20 diet (meaning 80% alkaline and 20% acidic), early bedtime, resistance training, and neuroplasticity training.

Brady and his family adhere to his controversial and strict diet, dubbed the TB12 Method. Brady advocates a daily water intake in ounces of half of one&#x27;s body weight in pounds and personally consumes &quot;a couple hundred ounces&quot; daily. He avoids most fruits, mushrooms, tomatoes, peppers, eggplants, coffee, Gatorade, white sugar, flour, gluten, dairy, soda, cereal, white rice, potatoes, and bread. In 2022, Brady said he prefers a diet consisting of organic food. &quot;You&#x27;ve got to see the process of food being grown,&quot; he said. &quot;If I need nutrients, I need that from soil.&quot;

One of Brady&#x27;s friends and former teammates, tight end Rob Gronkowski, has followed Brady and Alex Guerrero&#x27;s plant-based diet plan since 2017. Other professional athletes who follow Brady&#x27;s diet include quarterback Kirk Cousins and hockey player Mark Scheifele.

<text>In theology and philosophy, probabilism (from Latin &quot;probare&quot;, to test, approve) is an ancient Greek doctrine of academic skepticism. It holds that in the absence of certainty, plausibility or truth-likeness is the best criterion. The term can also refer to a 17th-century religious thesis about ethics, or a modern physical–philosophical thesis.

==Philosophy==
=== Ancient ===

In ancient Greek philosophy, probabilism referred to the doctrine which gives assistance in ordinary matters to one who is skeptical in respect of the possibility of real knowledge: it supposes that though knowledge is impossible, a man may rely on strong beliefs in practical affairs. This view was held by the skeptics of the New Academy. Academic skeptics accept probabilism, while Pyrrhonian skeptics do not.

=== Modern ===
In modern usage, a probabilist is someone who believes that central epistemological issues are best approached using probabilities. This thesis is neutral with respect to whether knowledge entails certainty or whether skepticism about knowledge is true.

Probabilist doctrines continue to be debated in the context of artificial general intelligence, as a counterpoint to the use of non-monotonic logic, as the proper form for knowledge representation remains unclear.

==Theology==
In moral theology, especially Catholic, it refers especially to the view in casuistry that in difficult matters of conscience one may safely follow a doctrine that is probable, for example is approved by a recognized Doctor of the Church, even if the opposite opinion is more probable.

This view was advanced by the Spanish theologian Bartolomé de Medina (1527–1581) and defended by many Jesuits. It was heavily criticised by Blaise Pascal in his &quot;Provincial Letters&quot; and by St. Alphonsus Ligourí in his &quot;Theologia Moralis&quot;, as leading to moral laxity. Opposed to probabilism is probabiliorism (Latin &quot;probabilior&quot;, &quot;more likely&quot;), which holds that when there is a preponderance of evidence on one side of a controversy one is obliged to follow that side, and tutiorism (Latin &quot;tutior&quot;, &quot;safer&quot;), which holds that in case of doubt one must take the morally safer side. A more radical view, &quot;minus probabilissimus&quot;, holds that an action is permissible if a single opinion allowing that action is available, even if the overwhelming weight of opinion proscribes it.

The doctrine became particularly popular at the start of the 17th century, as it could be used to support almost any position. By mid-century, such thinking, termed Laxism, was recognized as scandalous.

<doc id="339861" wikidata="Q7244" url="?curid=339861" title="Emperor Ping of Han">
<text>Emperor Ping of Han (9 BC – 3 February 6 AD), personal names Liu Jizi and later Liu Kan, was the eleventh emperor of the Chinese Han dynasty, reigning from 1 BC to AD 6. He ascended the throne at the age of eight following the death of his cousin, the childless Emperor Ai. Wang Mang was appointed regent by Grand Empress Dowager Wang Zhengjun. Dissatisfied with his father&#x27;s dictatorial regency, in AD 3, Wang&#x27;s son Wang Yu (王宇) conspired with Emperor Ping&#x27;s maternal uncles of the Wei clan against the regent, but after they were discovered, Wang Mang had not only Wang Yu and the Weis (except Consort Wei) put to death, but also used this opportunity to accuse many actual or potential political enemies as being part of the conspiracy and to execute or exile them. From then onwards, the Han dynasty existed only in name. Furthermore, Wang Mang also designated his daughter as the empress consort to Emperor Ping to codify his legitimacy to power. Emperor Ping was allegedly poisoned by Wang Mang after reigning less than six years because Wang was concerned that he would avenge his uncles, and his successor, the infant Ruzi Ying, would be chosen by none other than Wang Mang himself.

== Family background and life as imperial prince ==
Liu Jizi was born in 9 BC. His father Liu Xing (劉興) was the youngest son of Emperor Yuan and a younger brother of Emperor Cheng. His mother was one of Prince Xing&#x27;s consorts, Consort Wei (衛姬). Prince Jizi had three sisters (whose names are not recorded in history) but no brother. He was born with a heart ailment, which, when afflicting him, causes him to have circulation problems, manifesting itself outwardly as having his lips and appendages turn blue. He was raised by his paternal grandmother Consort Feng Yuan, a concubine of Emperor Yuan, who then had the title princess dowager in Prince Xing&#x27;s principality.

Around the time of Prince Jizi&#x27;s birth, Prince Xing was considered a potential imperial heir, because Emperor Cheng had no heirs, but eventually Emperor Cheng chose his nephew (Prince Jizi&#x27;s cousin) Liu Xin (劉欣), because Emperor Cheng considered Prince Xin to be more capable than Prince Xing, and also wanted to adopt Prince Xin and make him his own son. When Emperor Cheng died in April 7 BC, Prince Xin took the throne as Emperor Ai.

Also in 7 BC, when Prince Jizi was just 2, Prince Xing died, and Prince Jizi inherited his principality as the Prince of Zhongshan (roughly modern Baoding, Hebei). He continued to be periodically afflicted with his heart disorder. As a result, his grandmother Princess Dowager Feng hired many physicians and often prayed to the gods. In 6 BC, Emperor Ai, hearing about his cousin&#x27;s illness, sent imperial physicians along with his attendant Zhang You (張由) to go to Zhongshan to treat Prince Jizi. This, however, would have dire consequences of Princess Dowager Feng.

The imperial attendant Zhang was himself afflicted with a psychiatric condition (probably bipolar disorder), and when he got to Zhongshan, he suddenly, in a rage, left there and returned to the capital Chang&#x27;an. Once he did and was ordered to explain his conduct, he made up a false reason—that he had discovered that Princess Dowager Feng was using witchcraft to curse Emperor Ai and his grandmother, Empress Dowager Fu. Empress Dowager Fu and Princess Dowager Feng had been romantic rivals when they had been both consorts to Emperor Yuan, and Empress Dowager Fu decided to use this opportunity to strike at Princess Dowager Feng. She sent a eunuch, Shi Li (史立), to serve as investigator, and Shi tortured a good number of Princess Dowager Feng&#x27;s relations (including her sister Feng Xi (馮習) and her sister-in-law Junzhi (君之)), some to death, but still could not build a solid case against Princess Dowager Feng. Shi Li decided to show Princess Dowager Feng who was actually behind the investigation, by referring to an incident in which then-Consort Feng defended Emperor Yuan against a bear which had broken loose. Princess Dowager Feng, realizing that Empress Dowager Fu was behind the investigation, went back to her palace and committed suicide. In total, 17 members of the Feng clan died as a result of the investigations. Prince Jizi, then still a toddler, was spared. (Princess Dowager Feng&#x27;s reputation would be restored, and her accusers severely punished, in 1 BC, after the deaths of Emperor Ai and Empress Dowager Fu.)

In August 1 BC, Emperor Ai died without an heir. His stepgrandmother, Grand Empress Dowager Wang, quickly seized power back from Emperor Ai&#x27;s male favorite (and probable lover) Dong Xian, and recalled her nephew Wang Mang as regent. Wang Mang quickly carried out a wave of retaliation against Dong Xian and Emperor Ai&#x27;s Fu and Ding (relatives of his mother Consort Ding) relations, purging them from government. At the same time, he also purged many actual or potential political enemies, while pretending to Grand Empress Dowager Wang to be still loyal to the Han dynasty. Prince Jizi, as the only surviving male descendant of Emperor Yuan (both Emperors Cheng and Ai having died without issue), was considered the logical successor, and he was welcomed to Chang&#x27;an to succeed his cousin.

== Early reign and Wang Mang&#x27;s aggrandization of power ==
Almost immediately after Emperor Ping took the throne, Wang Mang began to carry out a regime to return governmental structure to ancient days of the Zhou dynasty and the even more ancient Xia dynasty and Shang dynasty. He also aggressively pursued a program to build up a personality cult about himself, wanting to have himself recognized as a holy regent on the scale of the Duke of Zhou. In 1 CE, for example, after having his political allies convincing Grand Empress Dowager Wang of his great faithfulness and great achievements, he was created the Duke of Anhan (安漢公, literally &quot;Duke who made Han secure&quot;), even though there had not been a single duke created in Han history up to that point. Further, to appease both the disaffected nobility and the people, Wang Mang instituted a program to restore marquess titles to descendants of past imperial princes and marquesses, started a pension system for retired officials, and reduced taxes. He also bribed vassal states into making offerings of rare animals, viewed as signs of heavenly blessing, to Han. With all people praising Wang Mang, he managed to persuade Grand Empress Dowager Wang, then already 69 years old, to have him make the important state decisions, rather than have her do so, and Wang Mang immediately became the most powerful figure in the empire.

To prevent Emperor Ping&#x27;s Wei relations from becoming powerful potential rivals at court, Wang Mang limited the titles of Emperor Ping&#x27;s uncles to acting marquesses (關內侯) and his mother Consort Wei to &quot;Princess Xiao of Zhongshan&quot; (&quot;Prince Xiao&quot; being Prince Xing&#x27;s posthumous name), and only created Emperor Ping&#x27;s three sisters ladies (君). He also ordered that the Weis, including Consort Wei, and Emperor Ping&#x27;s sisters not to be allowed to go to Chang&#x27;an to see him, but were to remain in Zhongshan.

In 2 CE, to reduce the burden of the people in naming taboo, Emperor Ping&#x27;s name was changed to Kan (衎), since Ji and Zi were commonly used characters.

Also in 2 CE, Wang Mang decided to have his daughter married to Emperor Ping to further affirm his position. Initially, he started a selection process of eligible noble young ladies (after declaring, in accordance with ancient customs, that Emperor Ping would have one wife and 11 concubines). However, then, in an act of false modesty intended to create the opposite result, he petitioned Grand Empress Dowager Wang that his daughter not be considered—and then started a petition drive by the people to have his daughter be selected as empress. The petitioners stormed the outside of the palace, and Grand Empress Dowager Wang, overwhelmed by the display of affection for Wang Mang, ordered that Wang Mang&#x27;s daughter be made empress.

== The Lü Kuan Incident and Wang Mang&#x27;s seizure of absolute power ==
Wang Mang&#x27;s son Wang Yu (王宇) disagreed with his father&#x27;s dictatorial regime and program to build up his personality cult, afraid that in the future the Wangs would receive a backlash when Emperor Ping was grown. He therefore formed friendships with Emperor Ping&#x27;s Wei uncles, and told Consort Wei to offer assurances to Wang Mang that she would not act as Emperor Ai&#x27;s mother and grandmother did, trying to become an empress dowager. Wang Mang still refused to let her visit the capital.

In 3 CE, Wang Yu formed a conspiracy with his teacher Wu Zhang (吳章), his brother-in-law Lü Kuan (呂寬), and the Weis, to try to see what they can do to break Wang Mang&#x27;s dictatorial hold. They decided that they would create what appear to be supernatural incidents to make Wang Mang concerned, and then have Wu try to persuade Wang Mang to transfer power to the Weis. Wang Yu told Lü to toss a bottle of blood onto Wang Mang&#x27;s mansion door to create that effect—but Lü was discovered by Wang Mang&#x27;s guards. Wang Mang then arrested Wang Yu, who then committed suicide, and his wife (Lü Kuan&#x27;s sister) Lü Yan (呂焉) was executed. Wang Mang then executed the entire Wei clan, except for Consort Wei. Wu was cut in half and then drawn and quartered. (It is not known what happened to Lü, but it would appear that there would be no way for him to escape death.)

Wang Mang then took this opportunity to further wipe out potential enemies—by torturing Wang Yu and Lü&#x27;s coconspirators and then arrest anyone that they mentioned, and then have them either executed or forced them to commit suicide. The victims of this purge included Emperor Yuan&#x27;s sister Grand Princess Jingwu (敬武長公主), Wang Mang&#x27;s own uncle Wang Li (王立), and his own cousin Wang Ren (王仁). He told Grand Empress Dowager Wang, however, falsely, that they had died of illnesses. Many other officials who were not willing to follow Wang Mang were also victimized in this purge. After this, Wang Mang&#x27;s hold on power became absolute.

In 4 CE, Emperor Ping officially married Wang Mang&#x27;s daughter and created her empress.

In 5 CE, Wang Mang revived an ancient ceremony intended for those who have made great contributions to the state, and had himself given the nine bestowments. (The &quot;nine bestowments&quot; would, after Wang Mang, thereafter become a customary step for usurpers to receive before they usurp the throne.)

== Death ==
Circa 5 AD, Emperor Ping, having grown older, appeared to have grown out of his earlier heart condition, and it became fairly plain that he resented Wang Mang for slaughtering his uncles and not allowing his mother to visit him in Chang&#x27;an. Wang Mang therefore resolved to murder the emperor. In winter 5 AD, Wang Mang submitted pepper wine (considered in those days to be capable of chasing away evil spirits) to the 13-year-old emperor, but had the wine spiked with poison. As the emperor was suffering the effects of the poison, Wang Mang wrote a secret petition to the gods, in which he offered to substitute his life for Emperor Ping&#x27;s, and then had the petition locked away. (Historians generally believed that Wang Mang had two motives in doing this—one was, in case Emperor Ping recovered from the poisoning, to use this to try to absolve himself of involvement in the poisoning, and the second was to leave for posterity evidence of his faithfulness.) After a few days of suffering, Emperor Ping died. The throne would lie vacant for the next few years, as although Emperor Ping&#x27;s cousin-once-removed, the infant Emperor Ruzi, would be selected as emperor, he would never actually take the throne. Wang Mang would serve as acting emperor and usurp the Han throne officially in 8 AD.

===Tomb===
Emperor Ping&#x27;s burial mound is found in Zhouling district of Xianyang. The grave sits in a field with only a rudimentary sign and low fence to distinguish it. The latter has not proven effective in discouraging climbers, as there are worn paths leading up and down the hill.

<doc id="339864" wikidata="Q4500472" url="?curid=339864" title="Houghton University">
<text>Houghton University is a private Christian liberal arts college in Houghton, New York, United States. Houghton was founded in 1883 by Willard J. Houghton and is affiliated with the Wesleyan Church. Houghton serves roughly 1000 students and has 54 degree majors for primarily undergraduate students.

==History==
Houghton University began in 1883 as Houghton Seminary, a coeducational high school founded by Willard J. Houghton, a Wesleyan Methodist minister. In 1899, the first few college classes were offered. James S. Luckey was appointed president in 1908 and Houghton College received its provisional charter from New York in 1923. A permanent charter was granted in 1927, and accreditation by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools came in 1935. Stephen Paine was appointed president in 1937. When the former Buffalo Bible Institute merged with Houghton College in 1969, the West Seneca campus was created. Wilber Dayton was appointed president in 1972 and he was succeeded by Daniel R. Chamberlain in 1976. The university initiated its first master&#x27;s degree program in 2004 and currently offers nine such degrees. Shirley Mullen was appointed president in 2006, and was succeeded by Wayne Lewis in 2023. From 2012 to 2013, the university set new records of giving to the institution for two years in a row. Despite this, Houghton University faced financial and enrollment challenges which led to academic budget cuts for the 2014–2015 academic year. This led to a &quot;strategic reallocation of resources&quot; which led to the development of several new majors including Music Industry, Sports Management, and Data Science. Houghton was approved to become a university in July 2022.

==Campus==
Houghton University&#x27;s main campus is in the hamlet of Houghton, in Allegany County, New York, about southeast of Buffalo, New York, and southwest of Rochester, New York. The of campus sit on the Allegheny Plateau at roughly , on the site of the former Caneadea Indian Reservation.

==Academics==
Houghton University grants associate and bachelor&#x27;s degrees in 46 majors. The university also offers six graduate degrees, including through the Greatbatch School of Music.

===Rankings===
Houghton University is ranked tied for #124 in National Liberal Arts Colleges in the 2020 Best Colleges rankings by &quot;U S News &amp; World Report&quot;.

===First Year Honors===
A First Year Honors Program is for qualified first-year students. There are two options: London Honors, and Science Honors. Previously the university offered a Contemporary Contexts program, but was replaced by London Honors in 2014. During London Honors, students spend their spring semester in London studying the development of the western world. East Meets West involves taking integrated classes during normal semester then traveling abroad during &quot;May Term&quot;, exploring the roots of Western culture. Science Honors takes place during both first-year semesters at Houghton, involving research in recent real-world issues such as fuel-efficiency, climate change, and energy sources. The theme for 2012-13 was Global Warming and ways in which to improve Houghton&#x27;s efforts in environmentalism. As part of this commitment, the school has built one of the largest solar arrays in the state of New York, with a ribbon cutting ceremony on April 17, 2015.

==Student life==
There are four traditional residence halls and four townhouses residences. Two of the traditional residence halls, Gillette Hall and Lambein Hall, are female residences. Rothenbuhler Hall and Shenawana Hall are male residences. Sophomore, Junior and senior students have the option to live in the townhouses. Houghton University is a distinctly residential campus but does allow for upper class students the opportunity to apply to live in approved off-campus housing, called Community Living Opportunities (CLOs). Many organizations and clubs are available for students to join or found their own.

==Athletics==
The Houghton athletic teams are called the Highlanders. The university is a member of the Division III level of the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA), primarily competing in the Empire 8 Athletic Conference (a.k.a. Empire 8) since the 2012–13 academic year. The Highlanders previously competed in the defunct American Mideast Conference of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) from 2001–02 to 2011–12.

Houghton competes in 17 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, soccer, track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor) and volleyball; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, field hockey, soccer, softball, tennis, track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor) and volleyball.

===Accomplishments===
Houghton&#x27;s first national champion was Kaitlin Fadden who won the 2008 NAIA Outdoor Track and Field marathon event in a time of 2:57:10. It was the first NAIA national championship, either for a team or individual, for Houghton College.

May 2012 graduate Danielle Brenon was the NAIA Outdoor Track and Field national champion in the marathon.

In 2014, the university opened the Kerr-Pegula Athletic Complex thanks to a $12 million gift from 1991 graduate Kim Pegula. The complex is named after Kim&#x27;s father Ralph Kerr, an instructor in Houghton&#x27;s Adult Education program, and her husband Terrence Pegula. Three lighted turf facilities are home to the Houghton Highlander soccer, baseball, softball, field hockey, and outdoor track. The multipurpose field house includes an eight-lane, 200-meter track and six tennis courts, offering a competition venue for the indoor track and tennis programs. It also provides dedicated practice space for outdoor sports over the winter and during inclement weather and serves as a hub of involvement for the campus and the surrounding communities of Northern Allegany County and Western New York.

===Club and intramural sports===
The university also offers club and intramural sports for men and women, including flag football, soccer, volleyball, basketball, and indoor soccer. Co-ed club and intramural sports are handball, water polo, and volleyball. Co-ed ultimate frisbee is also a popular sport. Club disc golf was added in 2021, and the university features two on-campus 18-hole disc golf courses.

==Controversies==
In 2020 two Houghton alumni presented an exhibition called &quot;We Are All Houghton&quot; to highlight the voices of LGBTQ+ students at Houghton and their negative experiences on campus. This project had a mixed reception by students and alum as some thought it was a much needed discussion, while others thought it promoted anti-biblical principles.

In April 2023, Houghton fired two employees, stating in both their termination letters that one of the reasons was because they included their gender pronouns in their email signatures, which violated institutional policy forbidding the use of pronouns in signatures.

==Notable alumni==

<doc id="339868" wikidata="Q262642" url="?curid=339868" title="Boutros Ghali">
<text>Boutros Ghali (12 May 1846 – 21 February 1910; , ; styled Boutros Ghali Bey later Boutros Ghali Pasha) was an Egyptian politician, who served as the Prime Minister of Egypt from 1908 to 1910.

==Early life==
BBoutros Ghali was born on 12 May 1846 to a Coptic Christian family in Kiman-al-&#x27;Arus, a village of Beni Suef, Egypt, in 1846. His father was Ghali Nayruz, the steward of Prince Mustafa Fazıl Pasha. Boutros Ghali studied Arabic, Ottoman Turkish, Persian, English, and French.

==Career==
After graduation, Ghali became a teacher at the patriarchal school. Ghali&#x27;s public career began in 1875 with his appointment to the post of clerk in the newly constituted Mixed Court by Sharif Pasha. Next he became the representative of the Egyptian government on the Commission of the Public Debt. Ghali began to work in the justice ministry in 1879 and was appointed secretary general of the ministry with the title of Bey. His following post was as first secretary of the council of ministers to which he was appointed in September 1881. However, in October 1881 he again began to work in the justice ministry. Upon the request of Mahmoud Sami al-Barudi, Ghali was awarded the rank of Pasha, being the first Coptic recipient of such an honour in Egypt. In 1886, he was appointed head of a commission for the selection of Sharia court judges, which was an unusual appointment due to his religious background, leading to protests by Muslims.

Ghali&#x27;s first ministerial portfolio was the minister of finance in 1893. Then he was made foreign minister in 1894.

In 1901 he was decorated as the 650th Grand-Cross of the Royal Military Order of Our Lady of the Concepcion of Vila Viçosa of Portugal. The same year Ghali joined the freemason lodge of Egypt.

He was appointed prime minister on 8 November 1908, replacing Mustafa Fahmi Pasha in the post. He also retained the post of foreign minister during his premiership. Ghali remained in office until 21 February 1910 and was replaced by Muhammad Said Pasha.

==Death==
Ghali was accused of favouring the British in the Denshawai incident. On 20 February 1910, Ghali was shot by Ibrahim Nassif al-Wardani, a twenty-three-year-old pharmacology graduate, who had just returned from Britain. Ghali was leaving the ministry of foreign affairs when Wardani fired five shots, three of which lodged in the premier&#x27;s body. Ghali died a day later, on 21 February.

The assassin, who confessed to the killing of Ghali, had been educated in Lausanne, Paris, and London and was a member of Mustafa Kamil Pasha&#x27;s Watani Party. His father was a governor and his uncle was a Pasha. Wardani was executed on 28 June 1910.

The assassination of Ghali was the first of a series of assassinations that continued until 1915. It was also the first public assassination of a senior statesman in Egypt in more than a century.

==Family==
Ghali had &quot;many sons&quot;, the most notable being: 
* Yusuf Boutros-Ghali
** Father of Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who was named after his grandfather and served as deputy prime minister of Egypt and as United Nations Secretary-General.
** grandfather of internet entrepreneur Teymour Boutros-Ghali 
** grandfather of Youssef Boutros Ghali, Minister of Finance from 2004 to 2011
* Wasif Boutrus Pasha Ghali or Wasif Boutrus Ghali Pasha (1878–1958), legislator and diplomat, foreign minister.
* Najib Boutros-Ghali, agriculture minister in 1921.
* Mirrit Boutros-Ghali, writer, businessman, and lawyer

Boutros Ghali&#x27;s brother Amin Ghali (1865–1933) was a public prosecutor; Amin&#x27;s son Ibrahim Amin Ghali was a diplomat who worked to rehabilitate his uncle&#x27;s reputation.

<doc id="339877" wikidata="Q192264" url="?curid=339877" title="Simeon I of Bulgaria">
<text>Simeon I the Great (; ; ) ruled over Bulgaria from 893 to 927, during the First Bulgarian Empire. Simeon&#x27;s successful campaigns against the Byzantines, Magyars and Serbs led Bulgaria to its greatest territorial expansion ever, making it the most powerful state in contemporary Eastern and Southeast Europe. His reign was also a period of unmatched cultural prosperity and enlightenment later deemed the Golden Age of Bulgarian culture.

During Simeon&#x27;s rule, Bulgaria spread over a territory between the Aegean, the Adriatic and the Black seas. The newly independent Bulgarian Orthodox Church became the first new patriarchate besides the Pentarchy, and Bulgarian Glagolitic and Cyrillic translations of Christian texts spread all over the Slavic world of the time. It was at the Preslav Literary School in the 890s that the Cyrillic alphabet was developed. Halfway through his reign, Simeon assumed the title of &quot;emperor&quot; (&quot;Tsar&quot;), having prior to that been styled &quot;prince&quot; (&quot;Knyaz&quot;).

==Background and early life==
Simeon was born in 864 or 865, as the third son of Knyaz Boris I of Krum&#x27;s dynasty. As Boris was the ruler who Christianized Bulgaria in 865, Simeon was a Christian all his life. Because his eldest brother Vladimir was designated heir to the Bulgarian throne, Boris intended Simeon to become a high-ranking cleric, possibly Bulgarian archbishop, and sent him to the University of Constantinople to receive theological education when he was thirteen or fourteen. He took the name Simeon as a novice in a monastery in Constantinople. During the decade (ca. 878–888) he spent in the Byzantine capital, he received an excellent education and studied the rhetoric of Demosthenes and Aristotle. He also learned fluent Greek, to the extent that he was referred to as &quot;the half-Greek&quot; in Byzantine chronicles. He is speculated to have been tutored by Patriarch Photios I of Constantinople, but this is not supported by any source.

Around 888, Simeon returned to Bulgaria and settled at the newly established royal monastery of Preslav &quot;at the mouth of the Tiča&quot;, where, under the guidance of Naum of Preslav, he engaged in active translation of important religious works from Greek to Medieval Bulgarian (currently referred to as Church Slavonic), aided by other students from Constantinople. Meanwhile, Vladimir had succeeded Boris, who had retreated to a monastery, as ruler of Bulgaria. Vladimir attempted to reintroduce paganism in the empire and possibly signed an anti-Byzantine pact with Arnulf of Carinthia, compelling Boris to re-enter political life. Boris had Vladimir imprisoned and blinded, and then appointed Simeon as the new ruler. This was done at an assembly in Preslav which also proclaimed Bulgarian as the only language of state and church and moved the Bulgarian capital from Pliska to Preslav, to better cement the recent conversion. It is not known why Boris did not place his second son, Gavril, on the throne, but instead preferred Simeon.

==Reign==

===Trade war with Byzantium and Magyar invasions===

With Simeon on the throne, the long-lasting peace with the Byzantine Empire established by his father was about to end. A conflict arose when Byzantine Emperor Leo VI the Wise, allegedly acting under pressure from his mistress Zoe Zaoutzaina and her father Stylianos Zaoutzes, moved the marketplace for Bulgarian goods from Constantinople to Thessaloniki, where the Bulgarian merchants were heavily taxed. The Bulgarians sought protection by Simeon, who in turn complained to Leo. However, the Byzantine emperor ignored his embassy.

Unable to effectively respond to the Bulgarian campaign due to the engagement of their forces against the Arabs, the Byzantines convinced the Magyars to attack Bulgaria, promising to transport them across the Danube using the Byzantine navy. Leo VI may have also concluded an agreement with Arnulf to make sure that the Franks did not support Simeon against the Magyars. In addition, the talented commander Nikephoros Phokas was called back from southern Italy to lead a separate army against Bulgaria in 895 with the intention to merely overawe the Bulgarians. Simeon, unaware of the threat from the north, rushed to meet Phokas&#x27; forces, but the two armies did not engage in a fight. Instead, the Byzantines offered peace, informing him of both the Byzantine foot and maritime campaign, but intentionally did not notify him of the planned Magyar attack. Simeon did not trust the envoy and, after sending him to prison, ordered the Byzantine navy&#x27;s route into the Danube closed off with ropes and chains, intending to hold it until he had dealt with Phokas.

Despite the problems they encountered because of the fencing, the Byzantines ultimately managed to ferry the Magyar forces led by Árpád&#x27;s son Liüntika across the Danube, possibly near modern Galaţi, and assisted them in pillaging the nearby Bulgarian lands. Once notified of the surprise invasion, Simeon headed north to stop the Magyars, leaving some of his troops at the southern border to prevent an attack by Phokas. Simeon&#x27;s two encounters with the enemy in northern Dobruja resulted in Magyar victories, forcing him to retreat to Drǎstǎr. After pillaging much of Bulgaria and reaching Preslav, the Magyars returned to their lands, but not before Simeon had concluded an armistice with Byzantium towards the summer of 895. A complete peace was delayed, as Leo VI required the release of the Byzantine captives from the trade war.

=== Anti-Magyar campaign and further wars with Byzantium ===
Having dealt with the pressure from the Magyars and the Byzantines, Simeon was free to plan a campaign against the Magyars looking for retribution. He negotiated a joint force with the Magyars&#x27; eastern neighbours, the Pechenegs, and imprisoned the Byzantine envoy Leo Choirosphaktes in order to delay the release of the captives until after the campaign against the Magyars. This would allow him to renegotiate the peace conditions in his favour. In an exchange of letters with the envoy, Simeon refused to release the captives and ridiculed Leo VI&#x27;s astrological abilities.

Using a Magyar invasion in the lands of the neighbouring Slavs in 896 as a &quot;casus belli&quot;, Simeon headed against the Magyars together with his Pecheneg allies, defeating them completely in the Battle of Southern Buh and making them leave Etelköz forever and settle in Pannonia. Following the defeat of the Magyars, Simeon finally released the Byzantine prisoners in exchange for Bulgarians captured in 895.

Claiming that not all prisoners had been released, Simeon once again invaded Byzantium in the summer of 896, heading directly to Constantinople. He was met in Thrace by a hastily assembled Byzantine army, but annihilated the Byzantine forces in the Battle of Bulgarophygon (at modern Babaeski, Turkey). Arming Arab captives and sending them to fight with the Bulgarians as a desperate measure, Leo VI managed to repel the Bulgarians from Constantinople, which they had besieged. The war ended with a peace treaty which formally lasted until around Leo VI&#x27;s death in 912 and under which Byzantium was obliged to pay Bulgaria an annual tribute. Under the treaty, the Byzantines also ceded an area between the Black Sea and Strandža to the Bulgarian Empire. Meanwhile, Simeon had also imposed his authority over Serbia in return for recognizing Petar Gojniković as their ruler.

Simeon often violated the peace treaty with Byzantium, attacking and conquering Byzantine territory on several occasions, such as in 904, when the Bulgarian raids were used by Arabs led by the Byzantine renegade Leo of Tripoli to undertake a maritime campaign and seize Thessaloniki. After the Arabs plundered the city, it was an easy target for Bulgaria and the nearby Slavic tribes. In order to dissuade Simeon from capturing the city and populating it with Slavs, Leo VI was forced to make further territorial concessions to the Bulgarians in the modern region of Macedonia. With the treaty of 904, all Slavic-inhabited lands in modern southern Macedonia and southern Albania were ceded to the Bulgarian Empire, with the border line running some 20 kilometres north of Thessaloniki.

=== Recognition as emperor ===

The death of Leo VI on 11 May 912 and the accession of his infant son Constantine VII under the guidance of Leo&#x27;s brother Alexander, who expelled Leo&#x27;s wife Zoe from the palace, constituted a great opportunity for Simeon to attempt another campaign against Constantinople, the conquest of which remained the dream of his life. In early 913, Simeon&#x27;s envoys, who had arrived in Constantinople to renew the peace of 896, were sent away by Alexander, who refused to pay the annual tribute, urging Simeon to prepare for war.

Before Simeon could attack, Alexander died, on 6 June 913, leaving the empire in the hands of a regency council headed by Patriarch Nicholas Mystikos. Many residents of Constantinople did not recognize the young emperor and instead supported the pretender Constantine Doukas, which, exacerbated by revolts in southern Italy and the planned Arab invasion in eastern Anatolia, was all to Simeon&#x27;s advantage. Nicholas Mystikos tried to discourage Simeon from invading Byzantium in a long series of pleading letters, but the Bulgarian ruler nevertheless attacked in full force in late July or August 913, reaching Constantinople without any serious resistance.

The anarchy in Constantinople had ceased after the murder of the pretender Constantine Doukas, however, and a government had promptly been formed with Patriarch Nicholas at the head. This urged Simeon to raise his siege and enter peace negotiations, to the joy of the Byzantines. The protracted negotiations resulted in the payment of the arrears of Byzantine tribute, the promise that Constantine VII would marry one of Simeon&#x27;s daughters, and, most importantly, Simeon&#x27;s official recognition as Emperor of the Bulgarians by Patriarch Nicholas in the Blachernae Palace.

Shortly after Simeon visited Constantinople, Constantine&#x27;s mother Zoe returned to the palace on the insistence of the young emperor and immediately proceeded to eliminate the regents. Through a plot, she managed to assume power in February 914, practically removing Patriarch Nicholas from the government, disowning and obscuring his recognition of Simeon&#x27;s imperial title, and rejecting the planned marriage of her son to one of Simeon&#x27;s daughters. Simeon had to resort to war to achieve his goals. He invaded Thrace in the summer of 914 and captured Adrianople. Zoe was quick to send Simeon numerous presents in order to conciliate him, and she managed to convince him to cede back Adrianople and withdraw his army. In the following years, Simeon&#x27;s forces were engaged in the northwestern Byzantine provinces, around Drač (Durrës) and Thessaloniki, but did not make a move against Constantinople.

=== Victories at Acheloos and Katasyrtai ===

By 917, Simeon was preparing for yet another war against Byzantium. He attempted to conclude an anti-Byzantine union with the Pechenegs, but his envoys could not match the financial resources of the Byzantines, who succeeded in outbidding them. The Byzantines hatched a large-scale campaign against Bulgaria and also tried to persuade the Serbian Prince Petar Gojniković to attack the Bulgarians with Magyar support.

In 917, a particularly strong Byzantine army led by Leo Phokas the Elder, son of Nikephoros Phokas, invaded Bulgaria accompanied by the Byzantine navy under the command of Romanos Lekapenos, which sailed to the Bulgarian Black Sea ports. En route to Mesembria (Nesebǎr), where they were supposed to be reinforced by troops transported by the navy, Phokas&#x27; forces stopped to rest near the river of Acheloos, not far from the port of Anchialos (Pomorie). Once informed of the invasion, Simeon rushed to intercept the Byzantines, and attacked them from the nearby hills while they were resting disorganized. In the Battle of Acheloos of 20 August 917, one of the largest in medieval history, the Bulgarians completely routed the Byzantines and killed many of their commanders, although Phokas managed to escape to Mesembria. Decades later, Leo the Deacon would write that &quot;piles of bones can still be seen today at the river Acheloos, where the fleeing army of the Romans was then infamously slain&quot;.

The planned Pecheneg attack from the north also failed, as the Pechenegs quarrelled with admiral Lekapenos, who refused to transport them across the Danube to aid the main Byzantine army. The Byzantines were not aided by Serbs and Magyars either: the Magyars were engaged in Western Europe as Frankish allies, and the Serbs under Petar Gojniković were reluctant to attack Bulgaria because Michael of Zahumlje, an ally of Bulgaria, had notified Simeon of their plans.

Simeon&#x27;s army quickly followed up the victory of Acheloos with another success. The Bulgarians sent to pursue the remnants of the Byzantine army approached Constantinople and encountered Byzantine forces under Leo Phokas, who had returned to the capital, at the village of Katasyrtai in the immediate proximity of Constantinople. The Bulgarian regiments attacked and again defeated the Byzantines, destroying some of their last units before returning to Bulgaria.

=== Suppression of Serbian unrest and late campaigns against Byzantium ===
Immediately after that campaign, Simeon sought to punish the Serbian ruler Petar Gojniković who had attempted to betray him by concluding an alliance with the Byzantines. Simeon sent an army led by two of his commanders, Theodore Sigrica and Marmais, to Serbia. The two managed to persuade Petar to attend a personal meeting, during which he was enchained and carried off to Bulgaria, where he died in a dungeon. Simeon put Pavle Branović, prior to that an exile in Bulgaria, on the Serbian throne, thus restoring the Bulgarian influence in Serbia for a while.

Meanwhile, the Byzantine military failures forced another change of government in Constantinople: the admiral Romanos Lekapenos replaced Zoe as regent of the young Constantine VII in 919, forcing her back into a convent. Romanos betrothed his daughter Helena Lekapene to Constantine and advanced to the rank of co-emperor in December 920, effectively assuming the government of the empire, which was largely what Simeon had planned to do.

No longer able to climb to the Byzantine throne by diplomatic means, the infuriated Simeon once again had to wage war to impose his will. Between 920 and 922, Bulgaria increased its pressure on Byzantium, campaigning in the west through Thessaly reaching the Isthmus of Corinth and in the east in Thrace, reaching and crossing the Dardanelles to lay siege on the town of Lampsacus. Simeon&#x27;s forces appeared before Constantinople in 921, when they demanded the deposition of Romanos and captured Adrianople, and 922, when they were victorious at Pigae, burned much of the Golden Horn and seized Bizye. In the meantime, the Byzantines attempted to ignite Serbia against Simeon, but he substituted Pavle with Zaharije Pribisavljević, a former refugee at Constantinople that he had captured.

Desperate to conquer Constantinople, Simeon planned a large campaign in 924 and sent envoys to the Fatimid caliph Ubayd Allah al-Mahdi Billah, who possessed a powerful navy which Simeon needed. The caliph agreed and sent his own representatives back with the Bulgarians to arrange the alliance. However, the envoys were captured by the Byzantines at Calabria. Romanos offered peace to the Arabs, supplementing this offer with generous gifts, and ruined their union with Bulgaria.

In Serbia, Zaharije was persuaded by the Byzantines to revolt against Simeon. Zaharije was supported by many Bulgarians exhausted from Simeon&#x27;s endless campaigns against Byzantium. The Bulgarian emperor sent his troops under Sigrica and Marmais, but they were routed and the two commanders beheaded, which forced Simeon to conclude an armistice with Byzantium in order to concentrate on the suppression of the uprising. Simeon sent an army led by Časlav Klonimirović in 924 to depose Zaharije. He was successful, as Zaharije fled to Croatia. After this victory, the Serbian nobility was invited to come to Bulgaria and bow to the new Prince. However, he did not appear at the supposed meeting and all of them were beheaded. Bulgaria annexed Serbia directly.

In the summer of 924, Simeon nevertheless arrived at Constantinople and demanded to see the patriarch and the emperor. He conversed with Romanos on the Golden Horn on 9 September 924 and arranged a truce, according to which Byzantium would pay Bulgaria an annual tax, but would be ceded back some cities on the Black Sea coast. During the interview of the two monarchs, two eagles are said to have met in the skies above and then to have parted, one of them flying over Constantinople and the other heading to Thrace, as a sign of the irreconcilability of the two rulers. In his description of this meeting, Theophanes Continuatus mentions that &quot;the two &quot;emperors&quot;... conversed&quot;, which may indicate renewed Byzantine recognition of Simeon&#x27;s imperial claims.

=== War with Croatia and death ===

Most likely after (or possibly at the time of) Patriarch Nicholas&#x27; death in 925, Simeon raised the status of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church to a patriarchate. This may be linked to Simeon&#x27;s diplomatic relations with the Papacy between 924 and 926, during which he demanded and received Pope John X&#x27;s recognition of his title as &quot;Emperor of the Romans&quot;, truly equal to the Byzantine emperor, and possibly the confirmation of a patriarchal dignity for the head of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church.

In 926, Simeon&#x27;s troops under Alogobotur invaded Croatia, at the time a Byzantine ally, but were completely defeated by the army of King Tomislav in the Battle of the Bosnian Highlands. Fearing a Bulgarian retribution, Tomislav agreed to abandon his union with Byzantium and make peace on the basis of the &quot;status quo&quot;, negotiated by the papal legate Madalbert. In the last months of his life, Simeon prepared for another conflict with Constantinople despite Romanos&#x27; desperate pleas for peace.

On 27 May 927, Simeon died of heart failure in his palace in Preslav. Byzantine chroniclers tie his death to a legend, according to which Romanos decapitated a statue which was Simeon&#x27;s inanimate double, and he died at that very hour.

He was succeeded by his son Peter I, with George Sursubul, the new emperor&#x27;s maternal uncle, initially acting as a regent. As part of the peace treaty signed in October 927 and reinforced by Peter&#x27;s marriage to Maria (Eirene), Romanos&#x27; granddaughter, the existing borders were confirmed, as were the Bulgarian ruler&#x27;s imperial dignity and the head of the Bulgarian Church&#x27;s patriarchal status.

H.H.Howorth opined &quot;If he had lived, or if he had been succeeded by princes of the same martial character, it is very probable that a great Slav state reaching from the Adriatic to the Black Sea, which would have been a barrier to the Turks, might have been formed south of the Danube.&quot;

== Culture and religion ==
During Simeon&#x27;s reign, Bulgaria reached its cultural apogee, becoming the literary and spiritual centre of Slavic Europe. In this respect, Simeon continued his father Boris&#x27; policy of establishing and spreading Slavic culture and attracting noted scholars and writers within Bulgaria&#x27;s borders. It was in the Preslav Literary School and Ohrid Literary School, founded under Boris, that the main literary work in Bulgaria was concentrated during the reign of Simeon in the new Cyrillic alphabet which was developed there.

The late 9th and early 10th centuries constitute the earliest and most productive period of medieval Bulgarian literature. Having spent his early years in Constantinople, Simeon introduced Byzantine culture to the Bulgarian court, but eliminated its assimilative effect by means of military power and religious autonomy. The disciples of Cyril and Methodius, among whom were Clement of Ohrid, Naum and Constantine of Preslav, continued their educational work in Bulgaria, actively translating Christian texts, such as the Bible and the works of John Chrysostom, Basil of Caesarea, Cyril of Alexandria, Gregory of Nazianzus, and Athanasius of Alexandria, as well as historic chronicles such as those of John Malalas and George Hamartolus, to Bulgarian. The reign of Simeon also witnessed the production of a number of original theological and secular works, such as John Exarch&#x27;s &quot;Six Days&quot; (&quot;Šestodnev&quot;), Constantine of Preslav&#x27;s &quot;Alphabetical Prayer&quot; and &quot;Proclamation of the Holy Gospels&quot;, and Černorizec Hrabǎr&#x27;s &quot;An Account of Letters&quot;. Simeon&#x27;s own contribution to this literary blossoming was praised by his contemporaries, for example in the &quot;Praise to Tsar Simeon&quot; preserved in the &quot;Zlatostruj&quot; collection and &quot;Simeon&#x27;s Collection&quot;, to which the tsar personally wrote an addendum.

Simeon turned the new Bulgarian capital Preslav into a magnificent religious and cultural centre, intended more as a display of his realm&#x27;s heyday and as a royal residence than as a military fortress. With its more than twenty cross-domed churches and numerous monasteries, its impressive royal palace and the Golden (or Round) Church, Preslav was a true imperial capital. The development of Bulgarian art in the period is demonstrated by a ceramic icon of Theodore Stratelates and the Preslav-style illustrated ceramics.

== Family ==
Simeon was married twice. By his first wife, whose identity is unknown, Simeon had a son called Michael. Possibly because his mother was of inferior birth, he was excluded from the succession and sent to a monastery.

By his second wife, the sister of the influential noble George Sursubul, he had three sons: Peter, who succeeded as Emperor of Bulgaria in 927 and ruled until 969; Ivan, who unsuccessfully conspired against Peter in 929 and then fled to Byzantium; and Benjamin (Bajan), who, according to Lombard historian Liutprand of Cremona, &quot;possessed the power to transform himself suddenly into a wolf or other strange animal&quot;.

Simeon also had several daughters, including one who was arranged to marry Constantine VII in 913. The marriage was annulled by Constantine&#x27;s mother Zoe once she had returned to the court.

== Legacy and popular culture ==

Tsar Simeon I has remained among the most highly valued Bulgarian historical figures, as indicated by popular vote in the &quot;Velikite Bǎlgari&quot; (a spin-off of &quot;100 Greatest Britons&quot;) television programme, which in February 2007 placed him fourth among the greatest Bulgarians ever. Simeon the Great has been regularly featured in fiction. Bulgarian national writer Ivan Vazov dedicated a children&#x27;s patriotic poem to him, &quot;Tsar Simeon&quot;, and it was later arranged as a song, &quot;Kray Bosfora šum se vdiga&quot; (&quot;A Clamour Rises by the Bosphorus&quot;). An eleven-episode drama series filmed in 1984, &quot;Zlatniyat vek&quot; (&quot;The Golden Age&quot;), retells the story of Simeon&#x27;s reign. In the series, the tsar is played by Marius Donkin. A historical drama play called &quot;Tsar Simeon Veliki – Zlatniyat vek&quot; produced by Stefan Staychev, director of the Silistra Theatre, premiered in December 2006. Ivan Samokovliev stars in the part of Simeon.

The painting, &quot;The Bulgarian Tsar Simeon&quot; is part of the 20-canvas work by Alfons Mucha, &quot;The Slav Epic&quot;.

The last Bulgarian monarch, Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, was named after Simeon I. A brand of high-quality grape rakija, &quot;Car Simeon Veliki&quot;, also bears his name, and an Antarctic peak on Livingston Island of the South Shetland Islands was named Simeon Peak in his honour by the Antarctic Place-names Commission.

<text>Escuintla () is an industrial city in Guatemala, its land extension is 4,384 km2, and it is nationally known for its sugar agribusiness. Its capital is a municipality with the same name. Citizens celebrate from December 6 to 9 with a small fair in honor to The Immaculate Conception.

In 2002 the city had a population of 86,678. It is located on the border of the central highlands and the Pacific coastal plain.

== Etymology ==
Many of the names of the municipalities of Guatemala consist of one of two things: the name of a catholic saint to worship the day the city was founded or a description with Náhuatl roots. These influences are due to the troops in command of Pedro de Alvarado who invaded the region in 1520. These troops were composed of Spanish soldiers and indigenous Tlaxcaltecs.

The name Escuintla, comes from the indigenous language nahuatl «Itzcuintlán», which is a word composed of two words:

· «Itzcuintli»: means &quot;dog&quot;

· «tlan»: means &quot;abundance&quot;

Therefore, Escuintla means &quot;abundance or place of dogs&quot;.

<doc id="339881" wikidata="Q2974437" url="?curid=339881" title="Citgo">
<text>Citgo Petroleum Corporation, or Citgo (stylized as CITGO), is a United States–based refiner, transporter and marketer of transportation fuels, lubricants, petrochemicals and other industrial products. Headquartered in the Energy Corridor area of Houston, it is majority-owned by PDVSA, a state-owned company of the Venezuelan government (although due to U.S. sanctions in 2019, they no longer economically benefit from Citgo).

==History==
===Cities Service period===
The company traces its heritage back to the early 1900s and oil entrepreneur Henry Latham Doherty. After quickly climbing the ladder of success in the manufactured gas and electric utility world, Doherty in 1910 created Cities Service Company to supply gas and electricity to small public utilities. He began by acquiring gas-producing properties in the mid-continent and southwest.

The company then developed a pipeline system, tapping dozens of gas pools. To make this gas available to consumers, Doherty moved to acquire distributing companies and tied them into a common source of supply. Cities Service became the first company in the mid-continent to use the slack demand period of summer to refill depleted fields near its market areas. Thus, gas could be conveniently and inexpensively withdrawn during peak demand times. In 1931, Cities Service completed the nation&#x27;s first long-distance high-pressure natural gas transportation system, a 24-inch pipeline 1,000 miles long from Amarillo, Texas to Chicago.

A logical step in the company&#x27;s program for finding and developing supplies of natural gas was its entry into the oil business. This move was marked by major discoveries at Augusta, Kansas, in 1914, and in El Dorado a year later. In 1928, a Cities Service subsidiary, Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Company, discovered the Oklahoma City field, one of the world&#x27;s largest. Another participated in the discovery of the East Texas field, which, in its time, was the most sensational on the globe.

Over three decades, the company sponsored the &quot;Cities Service Concerts&quot; on NBC radio. The long run of these musical broadcasts was heard on NBC from 1925 to 1956, encompassing a variety of vocalists and musicians. In 1944, it was retitled &quot;Highways in Melody&quot;, and later the series was known as &quot;The Cities Service Band of America&quot;. In 1964, the company moved its headquarters from Bartlesville, Oklahoma, to Tulsa.

At the height of Cities Service&#x27;s growth, Congress passed the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, which forced the company to divest itself of either its utility operations or its oil and gas holdings. Cities Service elected to remain in the petroleum business. The first steps to liquidate investments in its public utilities were taken in 1943 and affected over 250 different utility corporations.

At the same time, the government was nearing completion of a major refinery at Rose Bluff just outside Lake Charles, Louisiana, which would become the foundation of the company&#x27;s manufacturing operation. Using designs developed by Cities Service and the Kellogg Co., the plant was dedicated only 18 months after groundbreaking. A month before Allied troops landed in France, it was turning out enough 100-octane aviation gasoline to fuel 1,000 daily bomber sorties from England to Germany. Government funding through the Defense Plant Corporation (DPC) also prompted Cities Service to build plants to manufacture butadiene, used to make synthetic rubber, and toluene, a fuel octane booster and solvent.
In the years that followed, Cities Service grew into a fully diversified oil and gas company with global operations. Its green, expanding circle marketing logo became a familiar sight across much of the nation. During this time CEOs such as W. Alton Jones and Burl S. Watson ran the company.

Cities Service Company inaugurated use of the Citgo brand in 1965 (officially styled &quot;CITGO&quot;) for its refining, marketing and retail petroleum businesses (which became known internally as the RMT Division, for Refining, Marketing and Transportation). CITGO continued to be only a trademark, and not a company name, until the 1983 sale of what had been the RMT Division of Cities Service to Southland Corporation (now 7-Eleven Inc.).

===Demise of Cities Service and birth of Citgo Petroleum Corporation===
In 1982, T. Boone Pickens, founder of Mesa Petroleum, offered to buy Cities Service Company. Citgo responded by offering to buy Mesa, which was the first use of what became known as the &quot;Pac-Man&quot; take-over defense; i.e., a counter-tender offer initiated by a takeover target. Cities Service also threatened to dissolve itself by incremental sales rather than being taken over by Mesa, stating that it believed that the pieces would sell for more than Pickens was offering for the whole. Cities Service Company located what they thought would be a &quot;white knight&quot; to give them a better deal and entered into a merger agreement with Gulf Oil Corporation. Late in the summer of 1982, Gulf Oil terminated the merger agreement claiming that Cities Service&#x27;s reserve estimates were over-stated. Over fifteen years of litigation resulted. (For a more detailed discussion of the Cities Service vs. Gulf Oil litigation, see Gulf Oil#Demise.) Ironically, two years later, Gulf Oil itself would collapse as a result of a Pickens-initiated takeover attempt.

In the chaos that ensued after Gulf Oil&#x27;s termination of its deal, Cities Service eventually entered into a merger agreement with, and was acquired by, Occidental Petroleum Corporation—a deal that was closed in the fall of 1982. That same year, Cities Service Company transferred all of the assets of its Refining, Marketing and Transportation division (which comprised its refining and retail petroleum business) into the newly formed Citgo Petroleum Corporation subsidiary, to ease the divestiture of the division, which Occidental had no interest in retaining. Pursuant to an agreement entered into in 1982, Citgo and the Citgo and Cities Service brands were sold by Occidental in 1983 to Southland Corporation, original owners of the 7-Eleven chain of convenience stores.

===Venezuelan ownership===
Fifty percent of Citgo was sold to Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA) in 1986, which acquired the remainder in 1990, resulting in the current ownership structure. In September 2010, in connection with the centennial of its original owner, Cities Service Company, Citgo unveiled a new retail design. Within five years, Citgo planned for all locations to display the new street image. With full ownership of Citgo, PDVSA at its peak controlled 10% of the US domestic oil market, creating a lucrative export chain from Venezuelan oil to American consumers, as the two largest buyers of Venezuelan petroleum are the United States and China, respectively.

In October 2010, then President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, announced the intention to have PDVSA sell its Citgo subsidiary calling it a &quot;bad business&quot; and citing low profits since 2006. The minimum sale price was set at 10 billion US dollars; however, PDVSA has been unable to find a buyer at that price. It was confirmed in January 2015 that Citgo would not be sold, but rather bonds were sold by Citgo to give a dividend to PDVSA. The Bonds sold included a $1.5bn five-year bond and a $1.3bn term loan to be fully repaid in three and a half years.

In a 2016 deal, Venezuela pledged 49.9% of Citgo to Russian oil firm Rosneft as collateral for a $1.5 billion loan. Both Republicans and Democrats in the United States urged oversight on this deal, describing Citgo&#x27;s sale to Russia as a risk to the national security of the United States.

In November 2017, six executives working for Citgo, including five American citizens, were arrested while attending a meeting at the headquarters of PDVSA in Caracas, and as of June 2020 remained imprisoned without consular access and without a trial. Although granted house arrest in Venezuela in December 2019, the six men were transferred to harsher conditions in El Helicoide prison following U.S. President Donald Trump&#x27;s hosting of opposition leader Juan Guaido at the 2020 State of the Union Address. 

Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called for their release on humanitarian grounds, stating that they were &quot;wrongfully detained&quot; and that they had been incarcerated without evidence presented against them for over two years. On March 9, 2022, one of the Citgo 6 was released following a visit by US officials, including US Ambassador to Venezuela James B. Story, to Venezuela, where they met with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. Later that year, on October 1, the remaining five members of the Citgo 6 were released following a prisoner exchange. 

Other Venezuelan oil executives were arrested in what Bloomberg News described as a &quot;purge&quot; designed to bolster more economic power behind the President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. Asdrúbal Chávez, cousin of late Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez, was chosen as president of Citgo in November 2017.

Citgo also has a much earlier connection to Venezuela, dating to the turn of the 20th century. Predecessor Warner-Quinley Asphalt&#x27;s principal business was competition to the &quot;Asphalt Trust&quot; by means of a bitumen resources concession it held in Venezuela.

====Crisis in Venezuela====

Following the death of Hugo Chávez in 2013, his successor Nicolás Maduro presided in office through an era of economic depression caused by decreasing oil prices and sanctions. The destabilized economy resulted in hyperinflation, an economic depression, shortages in Venezuela and drastic increases in poverty, disease, child mortality, malnutrition, and crime. As a result of the crisis, Venezuela&#x27;s debt to China and Russia – two political allies – increased. Due to the financial burden of this debt, Venezuela offered Citgo as collateral for Russian debt in 2016, raising the possibility that the Russian government could own Citgo due to Venezuela&#x27;s high risk of default.

In July 2018, Citgo president Asdrúbal Chávez had his work and tourist visas revoked by the United States and was ordered to leave the country within thirty days.

====2019 U.S. sanctions====
On January 28, 2019, the U.S. Government imposed sanctions on PDVSA, freezing its assets in the U.S., and barring any U.S. firms and citizens from doing business with it. In February, Citgo cut ties with the PdVSA, and halted payments to them, placing them in a &quot;blocked account&quot;. However, the sanctions limited Citgo&#x27;s ability to refinance debt. In March, at the behest of the U.S. Treasury, 35 financial institutions secured a $1.2 billion loan to fund Citgo&#x27;s daily operations and refinancing, allaying concerns about Citgo&#x27;s ability to continue operating in the U.S.

On June 6, 2019, the U.S. Treasury expanded the sanctions, clarifying that exports of diluents to Venezuela could be subject to sanctions.

====2020 bond====
In 2020, Citgo borrowed money in the form of a bond, and used 50.1% of the company&#x27;s equity as collateral. If the bond is not repaid, the institutional investors that lent the money will obtain ownership of the 50.1%.

====Possible bankruptcy====
In May 2024, Bloomberg reported that opposition-appointed executives of Petroleos de Venezuela were considering placing Citgo into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to slow down or completely block the sale of oil assets under the company&#x27;s control. The opposition&#x27;s plan would help it retain control of its most important overseas asset, which is up for auction.

====Legal action against Citgo====
On May 30, 2024, two former Citgo executives who were imprisoned by the Venezuelan government, sued Citgo for over $400 million, claiming that their imprisonment was a conspiracy and was wrongful, refused to keep them protected from harm, and increased emotional distress on both of them.

==Controversies==
===United States–Venezuela relations===

 Texaco sold some Citgo gas stations in the southeast when Chevron gained exclusive rights to the Texaco brand name in the U.S. in June 2006. On September 27, 2006, the 7-Eleven chain of convenience stores announced its 20-year contract with Citgo was coming to an end and would not be renewed. 7-Eleven spokeswoman Margaret Chabris said &quot;Regardless of politics, we sympathize with many Americans&#x27; concern over derogatory comments about our country and its leadership recently made by Venezuela&#x27;s president. Certainly Chavez&#x27;s position and statements over the past year or so didn&#x27;t tempt us to stay with Citgo.&quot;

7-Eleven stations subsequently went either unbranded or switched to competitor brands, most notably Marathon, which owned rival chain Speedway at the time. (Marathon coincidentally sold Speedway to 7-Eleven in 2021.) Marathon purchased Citgo&#x27;s assets in Ohio during this time and led to the near-complete withdrawal of the Citgo brand from the state except in the Youngstown area, which were supplied by Citgo terminals in neighboring Pennsylvania due to its proximity to the Ohio-Pennsylvania border. In the years since, Marathon has had periods of considering buying Citgo outright, with the Venezuelan ownership being a major roadblock. In 2024, the Folk Oil Company of Homer, Michigan began rebranding 43 PS Marts from Sunoco to Citgo. The rebranding spans south east Michigan and Northwest Ohio.

Citgo launched a national ad campaign in the fall of 2006 emphasizing the company&#x27;s corporate social responsibility. National television ads featuring Joe Kennedy also aired through February 2007 featuring ordinary Americans thanking Citgo and Venezuela for providing discounted heating oil to low-income people.

===Environmental and safety concerns===
During the 2000s, Citgo faced several legal actions over the operation of its Corpus Christi, Texas oil refinery. In 2007, it was convicted of a violation of the Clean Air Act for operating an oil-water separator without proper pollution-control equipment. It was found not guilty of a charge of emitting illegal levels of benzene into the environment. In 2009, a fire at the alkylation unit of the same plant resulted in the release of toxic hydrofluoric acid and the injury of two workers, one with severe burns. In February 2011, the company was fined over $300,000 for the incident.

In 2015, Amazon Watch said 11 percent of crude oil processed at the Corpus Christi refinery and 1 percent processed at the Lake Charles refinery was sourced from the Amazon rainforest.

=== Former refineries ===
In 1901, the Warner-Quinlan Asphalt Company purchased several properties in Linden, New Jersey for use as an asphalt manufacturing plant at the Tremley Point development, later a part of the planned Montgomery Terminal. In 1937, Cities Services took over substantially all assets of Warner-Quinlan under a bankruptcy reorganization, including the Linden plant. The plant suffered several major fires and explosions. A tank exploded in July 1914, and two major fires occurred at the plant, one in June, 1921 (still under Warner-Quinlan), and another in October, 1938 (under Cities Services). The 1921 fire destroyed almost the entire plant.

==Other brands==
In addition to Citgo&#x27;s own brand of lubricants, they also own the Clarion and Mystik brand names.

Although primarily associated with lubricants, starting on October 1, 2003, Citgo began offering the Mystik brand name as a retail name.

==Sponsorships==
Citgo has sponsored several motorsport ventures. The company was a sponsor of the No. 21 Wood Brothers racing team in NASCAR for many years, with drivers such as Michael Waltrip, Elliott Sadler, Kyle Petty, Neil Bonnett, Morgan Shepherd and Dale Jarrett. They also sponsored the No. 99 Roush Racing team of Jeff Burton from late 2000 until pulling out of the sport in 2003. The company sponsored the Citgo Pontiac-Riley of Venezuelan car driver Milka Duno in the Rolex Sports Car Series. Duno has three overall wins in the Rolex Series and finished second at the 2007 24 Hours of Daytona, becoming the highest-finishing female in the history of the famous race. Midway through the 2007 season, Citgo sponsored the No. 23 SAMAX Motorsport entry in the IndyCar Series for Duno. In 2008 and 2009 this sponsorship went with Duno to the Dreyer &amp; Reinbold Racing No. 23 entry. She took the sponsorship to Dale Coyne Racing in 2010. Citgo was the major sponsor of E. J. Viso of KV Racing (2012) and Andretti Autosport (2013), and remained with Viso when he began racing in the Stadium Super Trucks in 2014.

Citgo is a major sponsor of the Bassmaster Fishing Tournaments, and is also the sponsor of a charity golf tournament benefiting the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA). The company&#x27;s relationship with the MDA goes back to its 1983 purchase by Southland, an existing MDA sponsor. Citgo is MDA&#x27;s biggest corporate sponsor, and its executives have appeared on the Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon. Consistent with its former sponsorship of the Boston Marathon, Citgo has for the past few years sponsored an elite level multisport team that competes in both adventure racing and triathlon events throughout the United States.

A Citgo billboard sign overlooking Kenmore Square in Boston is widely associated with the Boston Red Sox baseball team, as it is visible from within Fenway Park overlooking its left field wall, the Green Monster. The sign&#x27;s association with the team has also led to similar signs being installed at other baseball parks, including the Houston Astros&#x27; Daikin Park as part of their sponsorship of the team (until 2012, the sign was also in left field, much like the Red Sox; Occidental Petroleum now holds the placement). and Whataburger Field, home field of one of the Astros&#x27; minor league affiliates, the Corpus Christi Hooks.

=== Donald Trump inauguration ===
According to filings with the U.S. Federal Election Commission, Citgo donated US$ (US$ in 2020 dollars) towards Donald Trump&#x27;s presidential inauguration.

==Simón Bolívar Foundation==
In 2006, Citgo established the Simón Bolívar Foundation (SBF) as a 501(c)(3) non-profit, charitable private foundation to &quot;transform lives by connecting non-profits and community leaders to better improve the quality of life through the support of health initiatives&quot;. In 2020, the SBF provided grants of one $1M to provide humanitarian aid to Venezuela. The SBF runs a programme to help Venezuelan cancer patients travel abroad from for transplants and for other life-saving treatment. The programme was endangered by US sanctions on Venezuela. In 2021, the United Nations called on the US and other countries &quot;to respect, protect and fulfil the human rights of every person affected by direct international action&quot;.

==Headquarters==

Citgo has its headquarters in the Energy Corridor area of Houston, Texas, United States.

Before it was headquartered in Houston, Citgo had its headquarters in Tulsa, Oklahoma. In 2003, the Oklahoma governor Brad Henry met an executive of Citgo to discuss possible incentives that would keep the Citgo headquarters in Oklahoma. For eight months the company debated whether to move its headquarters or to keep its headquarters in Oklahoma. In 2004, the company announced that its headquarters were moving to Houston.

At that point the company had not decided which location in Houston would have the headquarters. The company wanted of office space to house 700 employees. Citgo considered the 1500 Louisiana building in Downtown Houston, the Williams Tower in Uptown Houston, the BMC Software headquarters complex in Westchase, and the Aspentech Building in the Energy Corridor. In June of that year the company signed a lease in the five-storey Aspentech building so it could serve as a headquarters. In September 2004 the company began moving its headquarters, and by September 24 Citgo had already relocated 150 employees to the Energy Corridor offices.

<doc id="339885" wikidata="Q310301" url="?curid=339885" title="Ebers Papyrus">
<text>The Ebers Papyrus, also known as Papyrus Ebers, is an Egyptian medical papyrus of herbal knowledge dating to (the late Second Intermediate Period or early New Kingdom). Among the oldest and most important medical papyri of Ancient Egypt, it was purchased at Luxor in the winter of 1873–1874 by the German Egyptologist Georg Ebers. It is currently kept at the Leipzig University Library in Germany.

==Manuscript==
The papyrus was written in Ancient Egypt in , during the late Second Intermediate Period or early New Kingdom, but it is believed to have been copied from earlier Egyptian texts. The Ebers Papyrus is a 110-page scroll, which is about 20 meters long.

Along with the Kahun Gynaecological Papyrus (), the Edwin Smith Papyrus (), the Hearst papyrus (), the Brugsch Papyrus (), and the London Medical Papyrus (), the Ebers Papyrus is among the oldest preserved medical documents. The Brugsch and the London Medical papyri share some of the same information as the Ebers Papyrus.

One side of another document, the Carlsberg papyrus VIII, is identical to the Ebers Papyrus, though the provenance of the former is unknown.

==Medical knowledge==
The Ebers Papyrus is written in hieratic Egyptian writing and represents the most extensive and best-preserved record of ancient Egyptian medicine known.

The scroll contains some 700 magical formulas and folk remedies. It contains many incantations meant to turn away disease-causing demons and there is also evidence of a long tradition of empiricism.

The papyrus contains a &quot;treatise on the heart&quot;. It notes that the heart is the centre of the blood supply, with vessels attached for every member of the body.

The ancient Egyptians seem to have known little about the kidneys and made the heart the meeting point of a number of vessels which carried all the fluids of the body—blood, tears, urine and semen.

Mental disorders are detailed in a chapter of the papyrus called the Book of Hearts. Disorders such as depression and dementia are covered. The descriptions of these disorders suggest that Egyptians conceived of mental and physical diseases in much the same way.

The papyrus contains chapters on contraception, diagnosis of pregnancy and other gynecological matters, intestinal disease and parasites, eye and skin problems, dentistry, the surgical treatment of abscesses and tumors, bone-setting, and burns.

The &quot;channel theory&quot; was prevalent at the time of writing of the Ebers papyrus; it suggested that unimpeded flow of bodily fluids is a prerequisite for good health.

The Ebers papyrus may be considered a precursor of ancient Greek humeral pathology and the subsequently established theory of humorism, providing a historical connection between ancient Egypt, ancient Greece, and medieval medicine.

==Examples of medical remedies==
Examples of remedies in the Ebers Papyrus include:
*Birth control: &quot;To prevent conception, smear a paste of dates, acacia, and honey to wool and apply as a pessary.&quot;
*Diabetes mellitus: &quot;Drink a mixture including elderberry, &quot;asit&quot; plant fibres, milk, beer-swill, cucumber flowers, and green dates.&quot; It is not known what &quot;asit&quot; is.
*Guinea-worm disease: &quot;Wrap the emerging end of the worm around a stick and slowly pull it out.&quot; 3,500 years later, this remains the standard treatment.
*Bleary eyes: Combine the following ingredients into a paste to apply to the bleary eyed patient. &quot;Myrrh, Onions, Verdigris, and Cyperus from the North, with Antelope dung, Clear Oil, and Entrails of the qadit animal. This could be painted on with a Vulture&#x27;s feather.&quot;
*To drive Blood from the eyes: create two substances one from powdered fruit of the donpalm and milk of a woman who has borne a son. The other Cow&#x27;s Milk. Then in the morning bathe both eyes from the first mixture then wash the eyes with the Cow&#x27;s milk four times for six days.
*Xanthelasma: Use a combination of red lead, Goose Grease, and Ginger to coat the eyes with.
*Pterygium: apply a mixture of red lead, powdered wood from Arabia, Iron from Apollonopolis parvis, Calamine, Egg of an ostrich, Saltpeter from upper Egypt, Sulfur, and honey to the eyes.
*Trichiasis: Combine Myrrh, Lizard&#x27;s blood, Bat&#x27;s Blood and then tear out the Hairs and Put thereon in order to make him well. Then use a mixture of Incense ground in lizard&#x27;s dung, Cow&#x27;s blood, Donkey&#x27;s Blood, Pig&#x27;s blood, Dog&#x27;s blood, Stag&#x27;s blood, Collyrium, and Incense to prevent the hair from growing back into the eye after being pulled out.
*Blindness: Use two eyes of a pig with the water removed from them, True Collyrium, red lead, and Wild Honey to create a powder and inject it into the ear. while mixing you must repeat &quot;I HAVE BROUGHT THIS THING AND PUT IT IN ITS PLACE. THE CROCODILE IS WEAK AND POWER- LESS. (Twice).&quot;
*Constipation: Chew bits of berry along with beer and it will relieve the constipation.
*Migraines: A clay effigy of a crocodile with herbs stuffed into its mouth was firmly bound to the head of the patient by a linen strip. The linen strip is inscribed with the names of Egyptian gods. This treatment was said to get rid of the ghosts and demons that were causing the pain. This remedy likely reduced the pain by cold compression of the head.
*Headaches: Combine the inner of an onion, fruit of the am tree, natron, setseft seeds, cooked bones of a swordfish, cooked redfish, cooked crayfish skull, honey, and abra ointment. Apply to the head for four days.
*Burn wound prevention: use a frog and warm it in oils and rub the afflicted spot, or warm an electric eel&#x27;s head in oils and apply it to the burn site.
*Diabetes: cakes, wheat, corn and grits.
*Miosis: small shavings of ebony wood and saltpeter.
*Corneal Opacity : place powdered granite in a cloth and place upon the afflicted eye.
*Bilharzia/Hookworm: warm the Jochauflegung of the sau wood in oil and give to the patient.
*To strengthen the nervous system: use a poultice of flesh of a fat cow applied to the body part which needs the strengthening.
*Coryza: &quot;Spit it out, thou Slime, Son of Slime: Grasp the bones, touch the skull, smear with tallow, give the patient, seven openings in the head, serve the god Ra, thank the god Thoth. Then I brought thy remedy for thee, thy drink for thee, to drive away, to heal it: Milk-of-a-Woman-who-has-Borne-a-Son and Fragrant Bread. The Foulness rises form out the Earth! The Foulness!(Four times). to be spoken over the Milk-of-a-Woman-who-has-Borne-a-Son and Fragrant Bread. put in the nose.&quot;
One of the more common remedies described in the papyrus is ochre, or medicinal clay. It is prescribed for intestinal and eye complaints. Yellow ochre is also described as a remedy for urological complaints.

==Animal repellents==
The use of animal and insect repellents derived from plants and other organisms found in nature is known from the time of the Ebers Papyrus. Several examples of such repellents can be found in the text.

* To prevent fleas and lice, Egyptians would mix in date-meal and water in bowls and cook the mixture until warm. They would then drink it and spit it out.
* To protect their grain from rodents and vermin, they would spread gazelle dung and mice urine around the fire in the granary.

==Calendar==
In the time of Amenhotep I a calendar table was written on the verso side of the papyrus. Since 1906 we have a transcript by Kurt Sethe. Some rate this table to be &quot;the most valuable chronological tool from Egypt that we are ever likely to possess&quot;.

==Modern history of the papyrus==
Like the Edwin Smith Papyrus, the Ebers Papyrus came into the possession of Edwin Smith in 1862.

The source of the papyrus is unknown, but it was said to have been found between the legs of a mummy in the El-Assasif district of the Theban necropolis.

The papyrus remained in the collection of Edwin Smith until at least 1869, when there appeared—in the catalog of an antiquities dealer—an advertisement for &quot;a large medical papyrus in the possession of Edwin Smith, an American farmer of Luxor.&quot;

The papyrus was purchased in 1872 by the German Egyptologist and novelist, Georg Ebers, after whom it is named.

==Translations==
In 1875, Ebers published a facsimile with an English-Latin vocabulary and introduction. It was not until 1890, however, that it was translated by H. Joachim. In the early 1900s, Dr. Carl H. von Klein, alongside his daughter Edith Zitelmann, created a direct-to-English translation of the Ebers Papyrus. Ebers retired from his chair of Egyptology at Leipzig on a pension and the papyrus remained in the University of Leipzig library. An English translation of the papyrus was published by Paul Ghalioungui. The papyrus was published and translated by different researchers.

The Ebers Papyrus is available online, at a dedicated website, with translations in English and German.

<text>Theridiidae, also known as the tangle-web spiders, cobweb spiders and comb-footed spiders, is a large family of araneomorph spiders first described by Carl Jakob Sundevall in 1833. This diverse, globally distributed family includes over 3,000 species in 124 genera, and is the most common arthropod found in human dwellings throughout the world.

Theridiid spiders are both entelegyne, meaning that the females have a genital plate, and ecribellate, meaning that they spin sticky capture silk instead of woolly silk. They have a comb of serrated bristles (setae) on the tarsus of the fourth leg.

The family includes some model organisms for research, including the medically important widow spiders. They are important to studies characterizing their venom and its clinical manifestation, but widow spiders are also used in research on spider silk and sexual biology, including sexual cannibalism. &quot;Anelosimus&quot; are also model organisms, used for the study of sociality, because it has evolved frequently within the genus, allowing comparative studies across species, and because it contains species varying from solitary to permanently social. These spiders are also a promising model for the study of inbreeding because all permanently social species are highly inbred.

The Hawaiian &quot;Theridion grallator&quot; is used as a model to understand the selective forces and the genetic basis of color polymorphism within species. &quot;T. grallator&quot; is known as the &quot;happyface&quot; spider, as certain morphs have a pattern resembling a smiley face or a grinning clown face on their yellow body.

==Webs==
They often build tangle space webs, hence the common name, but Theridiidae has a large diversity of spider web forms. Many trap ants and other ground dwelling insects using elastic, sticky silk trap lines leading to the soil surface. Webs remain in place for extended periods and are expanded and repaired, but no regular pattern of web replacement has been observed.

The well studied kleptoparasitic members of Argyrodinae (&quot;Argyrodes&quot;, &quot;Faiditus&quot;, and &quot;Neospintharus&quot;) live in the webs of larger spiders and pilfer small prey caught by their host&#x27;s web. They eat prey killed by the host spider, consume silk from the host web, and sometimes attack and eat the host itself.

Theridiid gumfoot-webs consist of frame lines that anchor them to surroundings and of support threads, which possess viscid silk. These can either have a central retreat (&quot;Achaearanea&quot;-type) or a peripheral retreat (&quot;Latrodectus&quot;-type). Building gum-foot lines is a unique, stereotyped behaviour, and is likely homologous for Theridiidae and its sister family Nesticidae.

Among webs without gumfooted lines, some contain viscid silk (&quot;Theridion&quot;-type) and some that are sheet-like, which do not contain viscid silk (&quot;Coleosoma&quot;-type). However, there are many undescribed web forms.

==Genera==



The largest genus is &quot;Theridion&quot; with over 600 species, but it is not monophyletic. &quot;Parasteatoda&quot;, previously &quot;Achaearanea&quot;, is another large genus that includes the North American common house spider.

<text>Omoa is a town and municipality with a population of 10,550 (2023 calculation) in the Department of Cortés in Honduras. Omoa is located on a small bay of the same name 18 km west of Puerto Cortés on the Caribbean Sea coast.

== Geography ==
Omoa is both a municipality and a small town located along the Northwest Caribbean coast of Honduras. It is populated by about 30,000 people distributed within an area of 382.8 km².

== History ==
In 1536 Omoa was a small &quot;pueblo de indios&quot; allocated in repartimiento by Pedro de Alvarado to Luis del Puerto along with the nearby Indian town of Chachaguala; by 1582 Omoa had ceased to exist as a viable community.

Repeated pirate raids on coastal towns along the Caribbean coast of Central America led the Spanish Crown as early as 1590 to begin looking for a new defensible port for the Captaincy General of Guatemala to export its goods to Spain. This initial study by Antonelli, and many subsequent ones, all pointed to the bay at Omoa as the most defensible location along the coast west of Trujillo (which already had a fort).

Omoa was founded again in 1752 as a Spanish colonial town. The then-governor of Honduras, Pantaleón Ibánez, described that the town they planned would include a hospital, a building for the royal treasury, a church, warehouses, barracks for soldiers, and houses for the officers. The town itself was to house the people who would build and occupy the two Spanish forts (El Real, and San Fernando de Omoa) which would guard the bay. Construction of El Real began in 1752 and was finished around 1756. 
El Real was used to defend the port town while the much larger fort of San Fernando de Omoa was built next to it. San Fernando de Omoa was finished around 1774. This historic place had as its main purpose to protect against the pirates that targeted the silver cargos originating from the mines of San Miguel of Tegucigalpa that often left from Omoa to Spain. Ironically, the construction of the fortress did not end until piracy had significantly declined. After the independence of Honduras in 1821, the fortress was used as a prison by the Honduran authorities through the 1950s. The English briefly occupied the town in 1779 and reportedly burned its 200 buildings.

In the late 18th century, Omoa had a diverse population of Spanish, Indians (mostly from central Honduras), enslaved Africans (the four contracts of royal slaves deployed to build and maintain the fort), mulattos, and free blacks (escaped English slaves, mostly from Belize).

For a very long time, Omoa was one of the most important ports in Honduras. Nevertheless, that importance began to fade in the 1820s when the place was destroyed a couple of times by fires, the bay began to silt up, and nearby Puerto Cortes was developed. Then the first railroad connecting Puerto Cortes with San Pedro Sula was developed in the 1880s, reducing Omoa to a fishing village.

== Economy ==

Historically, Omoa had a cattle industry, with most of the cattle being maintained for Honduran use. Omoa has a large fishing industry. Other sources of income come from tourism and of the fortress of San Fernando, the largest of Central America and one of the few surviving colonial fortresses in the Americas.

== San Fernando of Omoa ==
Omoa&#x27;s most striking feature is the Fortaleza de San Fernando de Omoa, an 18th-century Spanish fort, though there are actually two forts there. The earlier Fort Real was started in 1752, and remodelled in 1759. Next to Fort Real, the Fort of San Fernando de Omoa was constructed from 1756 through 1775. A naval packet ship (&quot;paquebote&quot;) mounting 18 guns was built here for the Spanish Navy in 1757 that also carried the name &quot;San Fernando&quot;.On 15 October 1779 the Royal Navy ships and were with a small squadron which arrived off the Honduras coast. They were accompanied by , , a schooner and other small craft, and were hoping to intercept some treasure ships in the bay of Dulce. They found two Spanish ships which took shelter under the guns of the fortress of San Fernando de Omoa, and an unsuccessful attempt was made to capture the town from the sea. They fell in with the sloop and some troop transports returning from driving the Spaniards from St George&#x27;s. On 16 October, this was followed by a landing some 9 miles away at Puerto Caballo by seamen and marines from the ships, a detachment of the Royal Irish Regiment and 250 Baymen to make an overland attempt on Omoa. They underestimated the difficulties of marching first through swamps, and then wild, mountainous country and only covered three miles during the night. However, when they reached the town the following afternoon it soon fell, but they were unable to take the fort because the Baymen had dropped the scaling ladders they were carrying. They were supported during the attack by fire from &quot;Charon&quot; and &quot;Lowestoffe&quot;, the latter being badly damaged when she grounded for a while as she tried to get closer.

The bombardment from the sea, supplemented by fire from some guns which had been landed from &quot;Pomona&quot;, continued on the night of 19 October, occupying the garrison which did not notice storming parties of seamen, marines and soldiers infiltrating the fort. The surprise was complete and there were only six British casualties. The treasure found in the fort and on board two treasure ships was worth some two million dollars. Two hundred and fifty quintals (equivalent to 14 metric tons) of mercury were also found in the fort. The fort itself was abandoned by the British at the end of November before a Spanish counterattack arrived. The craters from the British bombardment are still visible in the walls of the fort today.

Omoa was the last Spanish stronghold in Central America after the region declared its independence. The Spanish fort was captured by the Central American Republicans under Colonel Juan Galindo.

The fort was one of the few structures left standing after 1974&#x27;s Hurricane Fifi destroyed the town and was a point of rescue operations afterward.

<text>Puerto Cortés, originally known as Puerto de Caballos, is a port city and municipality on the north Caribbean coast of Honduras, right on the Laguna de Alvarado, north of San Pedro Sula and east of Omoa, with a natural bay. The present city was founded in the early colonial period. It grew rapidly in the twentieth century, thanks to the then railroad, and banana production. In terms of volume of traffic the seaport is the largest in Central America and the 36th largest in the world. The city of Puerto Cortés has a population of 73,150 (2023 calculation).

==History==

Gil González Dávila founded the city in 1524 and called Villa de la Natividad de Nuestra Señora, now known as Cieneguita. In 1526 Hernán Cortés came to punish González Dávila and when he arrived on Honduras&#x27; coast from Mexico and started unloading horses and cargo from the ships, several horses were drowned, and for that reason, Cortés called it Puerto Caballos. By 1533, a local native leader, called Çiçumba (or Çoçumba, or Socremba, or Joamba – the Spanish recorded many variants of his name) had destroyed the town, reportedly taking a woman from Seville, Spain captive. After Çiçumba&#x27;s defeat in 1536 by Pedro de Alvarado, a new town, Puerto de Caballos was founded on the southern shore of the body of water known as the Laguna de Alvarado.

The English attacked Puerto Caballos as they did other places along the Honduran coast. Christopher Newport briefly occupied the town in the Battle of Puerto Caballos, part of the Anglo–Spanish War. Because it was vulnerable to pirates until the building of the Spanish fort at Omoa in the 18th century, it had few permanent residents in the 16th and 17th centuries. People preferred to come out to the coast from San Pedro when a ship came into port. In 1869 Puerto Caballos changed its name to Puerto Cortés in honour of Hernán Cortés.

===Bananas, railroads and development in the twentieth century===

The proposal to construct an &quot;inter-oceanic railway&quot; (&quot;Ferrocarril Interoceánico&quot;) in 1850, a product of the demand for transport from the Atlantic to the Pacific caused by the United States Gold Rush of 1849, began with the anchoring of the railroad at Puerto Cortés. The rail line construction had many problems. In 1876 President Marco Aurelio Soto nationalised the Trans-Oceanic Railroad, which only reached to San Pedro Sula. When the Panama Canal was completed in 1903, the alternative plan to connect the coasts was abandoned. The region became an early centre for banana production in Honduras through cultivation and export, and the port was a leader in the export of bananas.

The early banana export industry came to be dominated by foreigners; among the first foreigners to obtain a government concession was William Frederick Streich of Philadelphia in 1902. His concession was in the vicinity of Omoa and both banks of the Cuyamel River. However, in 1910 Samuel Zemurray&#x27;s Cuyamel Fruit Company purchased these 5,000 acres, but soon branched out, both with more land and with political and tax concessions, especially after Zemurray installed Manuel Bonilla in office as president using mercenaries hired in the area and abroad. In addition to awarding Cuyamel additional land, Bonilla also waived the company&#x27;s tax obligations. Cuyamel had built port facilities at Omoa, but also began using the facilities at Puerto Cortés and soon came to dominate them to the point that local shippers had to ask Cuyamel&#x27;s permission to use the port. In 1918, Cuyamel constructed a railroad spur into Puerto Cortés, and in 1920 he obtained effective control over the National Railroad, and from this and a network of clandestine railroads the company effectively controlled all transport to the port. When Zemurray sold Cuyamel Fruit to United Fruit in 1929, the giant company had great influence in Puerto Cortés and in Honduras as a whole.

==The city==

During two weeks in August, Puerto Cortés celebrates its local patronal festivities. The last day (a Saturday) is known as Noche Veneciana (&#x27;Venice Night&#x27;). 15 August is a local holiday in honor of the Virgen de la Asunción (Puerto Cortés&#x27;s local patroness saint).

In September 2001, the Laguna de Alvarado Bridge was rebuilt and inaugurated after the old bridge, a 50-year-old structure, was badly damaged by Hurricane Mitch in 1998. A concrete wall that surrounds and protects a portion of the coastline in the bay area was built near the northern end of the bridge. This wall is known as El Malecón (Spanish for &#x27;The Breakwater&#x27;).

The first four-lane highway in Honduras was inaugurated in 1996, connecting Puerto Cortés and the city of San Pedro Sula.

==Seaport==
In 1966, the Empresa Nacional Portuaria (Honduras National Port Authority) was created. A free trade zone was created in 1976.

Among all worldwide seaports that export containers with goods with destination to USA, Puerto Cortés is the 36th in terms of volume.

Because of its proximity to US seaports in the Gulf of Mexico and on the East Coast and its seaport infrastructure, Puerto Cortés was included in the US Container Security Initiative (CSI), the first such port in Central America. In December 2005, the US government signed an agreement with Honduras&#x27;s government and opened a US Customs Office in Puerto Cortés. Under this agreement, all containers exported from Puerto Cortés that are destined for any US seaport are checked by US Customs officials in Honduras.

In March 2007, under the Megaport initiative, three RPMs (Radiation Portal Monitors) were already installed in Puerto Cortés by US DOE to inspect all containers with destination to USA, checking for possible dangerous radioactive threats. On 2 April 2007 the RPMs became operative.

==Sports==
Puerto Cortés is home of a football team known as &quot;Platense&quot;, which in 1966 won its first Honduran National Football Champion. In 2001 the team won its second national championship. They play their home games at the Estadio Excélsior. Atlético Portuario was briefly another football club based in the city.

<doc id="339894" wikidata="Q2560317" url="?curid=339894" title="Histone methyltransferase">
<text>Histone methyltransferases (HMT) are histone-modifying enzymes (e.g., histone-lysine N-methyltransferases and histone-arginine N-methyltransferases), that catalyze the transfer of one, two, or three methyl groups to lysine and arginine residues of histone proteins. The attachment of methyl groups occurs predominantly at specific lysine or arginine residues on histones H3 and H4. Two major types of histone methyltranferases exist, lysine-specific (which can be SET (Su(var)3-9, Enhancer of Zeste, Trithorax) domain containing or non-SET domain containing) and arginine-specific. In both types of histone methyltransferases, S-Adenosyl methionine (SAM) serves as a cofactor and methyl donor group. 
The genomic DNA of eukaryotes associates with histones to form chromatin. The level of chromatin compaction depends heavily on histone methylation and other post-translational modifications of histones. Histone methylation is a principal epigenetic modification of chromatin that determines gene expression, genomic stability, stem cell maturation, cell lineage development, genetic imprinting, DNA methylation, and cell mitosis.

== Types ==
The class of lysine-specific histone methyltransferases is subdivided into SET domain-containing and non-SET domain-containing. As indicated by their monikers, these differ in the presence of a SET domain, which is a type of protein domain.

Human genes encoding proteins with histone methyltransferase activity include:
* ASH1L
* DOT1L
* EHMT1, EHMT2, EZH1, EZH2
* MLL, MLL2, MLL3, MLL4, MLL5
* NSD1
* PRDM2
* SET, SETBP1, SETD1A, SETD1B, SETD2, SETD3, SETD4, SETD5, SETD6, SETD7, SETD8, SETD9, SETDB1, SETDB2
* SETMAR, SMYD1, SMYD2, SMYD3, SMYD4, SMYD5, SUV39H1, SUV39H2, KMT5B, SUV420H2

=== SET domain-containing lysine-specific ===

==== Structure ====

The structures involved in methyltransferase activity are the SET domain (composed of approximately 130 amino acids), the pre-SET, and the post-SET domains. The pre-SET and post-SET domains flank the SET domain on either side. The pre-SET region contains cysteine residues that form triangular zinc clusters, tightly binding the zinc atoms and stabilizing the structure. The SET domain itself contains a catalytic core rich in β-strands that, in turn, make up several regions of β-sheets. Often, the β-strands found in the pre-SET domain will form β-sheets with the β-strands of the SET domain, leading to slight variations to the SET domain structure. These small changes alter the target residue site specificity for methylation and allow the SET domain methyltransferases to target many different residues. This interplay between the pre-SET domain and the catalytic core is critical for enzyme function.

==== Catalytic mechanism ====

In order for the reaction to proceed, S-Adenosyl methionine (SAM) and the lysine residue of the substrate histone tail must first be bound and properly oriented in the catalytic pocket of the SET domain. Next, a nearby tyrosine residue deprotonates the ε-amino group of the lysine residue. The lysine chain then makes a nucleophilic attack on the methyl group on the sulfur atom of the SAM molecule, transferring the methyl group to the lysine side chain.

=== Non-SET domain-containing lysine-specific ===

Instead of SET, non-SET domain-containing histone methyltransferase utilizes the enzyme Dot1. Unlike the SET domain, which targets the lysine tail region of the histone, Dot1 methylates a lysine residue in the globular core of the histone, and is the only enzyme known to do so. A possible homolog of Dot1 was found in archaea which shows the ability to methylate archaeal histone-like protein in recent studies.

==== Structure ====

The N terminal of Dot1 contains the active site. A loop serving as the binding site for SAM links the N-terminal and the C-terminal domains of the Dot1 catalytic domain. The C-terminal is important for the substrate specificity and binding of Dot1 because the region carries a positive charge, allowing for a favorable interaction with the negatively charged backbone of DNA. Due to structural constraints, Dot1 is only able to methylate histone H3.

=== Arginine-specific ===

There are three different types of protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) and three types of methylation that can occur at arginine residues on histone tails. The first type of PRMTs (PRMT1, PRMT3, CARM1⧸PRMT4, and Rmt1⧸Hmt1) produce monomethylarginine and asymmetric dimethylarginine (Rme2a). The second type (JBP1⧸PRMT5) produces monomethyl or symmetric dimethylarginine (Rme2s). The third type (PRMT7) produces only monomethylated arginine. The differences in methylation patterns of PRMTs arise from restrictions in the arginine binding pocket.

==== Structure ====

The catalytic domain of PRMTs consists of a SAM binding domain and substrate binding domain (about 310 amino acids in total). Each PRMT has a unique N-terminal region and a catalytic core. The arginine residue and SAM must be correctly oriented within the binding pocket. SAM is secured inside the pocket by a hydrophobic interaction between an adenine ring and a phenyl ring of a phenylalanine.

==== Catalytic mechanism ====

A glutamate on a nearby loop interacts with nitrogens on the target arginine residue. This interaction redistributes the positive charge and leads to the deprotonation of one nitrogen group, which can then make a nucleophilic attack on the methyl group of SAM. Differences between the two types of PRMTs determine the next methylation step: either catalyzing the dimethylation of one nitrogen or allowing the symmetric methylation of both groups. However, in both cases the proton stripped from the nitrogen is dispersed through a histidine–aspartate proton relay system and released into the surrounding matrix.

== Role in gene regulation ==
Histone methylation plays an important role in epigenetic gene regulation. Methylated histones can either repress or activate transcription as different experimental findings suggest, depending on the site of methylation. For example, it is likely that the methylation of lysine 9 on histone H3 (H3K9me3) in the promoter region of genes prevents excessive expression of these genes and, therefore, delays cell cycle transition and/or proliferation. In contrast, methylation of histone residues H3K4, H3K36, and H3K79 is associated with transcriptionally active euchromatin.

Depending on the site and symmetry of methylation, methylated arginines are considered activating (histone H4R3me2a, H3R2me2s, H3R17me2a, H3R26me2a) or repressive (H3R2me2a, H3R8me2a, H3R8me2s, H4R3me2s) histone marks. 
Generally, the effect of a histone methyltransferase on gene expression strongly depends on which histone residue it methylates. See Histone#Chromatin regulation.

== Disease relevance ==
Abnormal expression or activity of methylation-regulating enzymes has been noted in some types of human cancers, suggesting associations between histone methylation and malignant transformation of cells or formation of tumors. In recent years, epigenetic modification of the histone proteins, especially the methylation of the histone H3, in cancer development has been an area of emerging research. It is now generally accepted that in addition to genetic aberrations, cancer can be initiated by epigenetic changes in which gene expression is altered without genomic abnormalities. These epigenetic changes include loss or gain of methylations in both DNA and histone proteins.

There is not yet compelling evidence that suggests cancers develop purely by abnormalities in histone methylation or its signaling pathways, however they may be a contributing factor. For example, down-regulation of methylation of lysine 9 on histone 3 (H3K9me3) has been observed in several types of human cancer (such as colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, and lung cancer), which arise from either the deficiency of H3K9 methyltransferases or elevated activity or expression of H3K9 demethylases.

==DNA repair==

The methylation of histone lysine has an important role in choosing the pathway for repairing DNA double-strand breaks. As an example, tri-methylated H3K36 is required for homologous recombinational repair, while dimethylated H4K20 can recruit the 53BP1 protein for repair by the pathway of non-homologous end joining.

== Further research ==
Histone methyltransferase may be able to be used as biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of cancers. Additionally, many questions still remain about the function and regulation of histone methyltransferases in malignant transformation of cells, carcinogenesis of the tissue, and tumorigenesis.

<text>Scouse ( ), more formally known as Liverpool English or Merseyside English, is an accent and dialect of English associated with the city of Liverpool and the surrounding Liverpool City Region. The Scouse accent is highly distinctive, as it was heavily influenced by Irish and Welsh immigrants who arrived via the Liverpool docks, as well as Scandinavian sailors who also used the docks. People from Liverpool are known as Liverpudlians, but are usually called Scousers; the name comes from scouse, a stew originating from Scandinavian lobscouse eaten by sailors and locals.

Liverpool&#x27;s development since the 1950s has spread the accent into nearby areas such as the towns of Runcorn and Skelmersdale. Variations of Scouse have been noted: the accent of Liverpool&#x27;s city centre and northern neighbourhoods is usually described as fast, harsh, and nasal, while the &quot;Beatles-like&quot; accent found in Liverpool&#x27;s southern suburbs is typically described as slow, soft, and dark. Popular colloquialisms have shown a growing deviation from the historical Lancashire dialect previously found in Liverpool, as well as a growth in the influence of the accent in the wider area. Scouse is often considered by other Britons one of the country&#x27;s least popular accents due to its difficulty, but it also performs very well in polls of British accents that people perceive as happy and friendly.

==Etymology==
The word is a shortened form of lobscouse, the origin of which is uncertain. It is related to the Norwegian &quot;lapskaus&quot;, Swedish &quot;lapskojs&quot;, Danish &quot;labskovs (skipperlabskovs)&quot;, and the Low German &quot;labskaus&quot;, and refers to a stew of the same name commonly eaten by sailors. In the 19th century, poorer people in Liverpool, Birkenhead, Bootle and Wallasey commonly ate scouse as it was a cheap dish familiar to the families of seafarers. Outsiders called these people &quot;scousers&quot;. In &quot;The Lancashire Dictionary of Dialect, Tradition and Folklore&quot;, Alan Crosby suggests that the word became known nationwide only with the popularity of the BBC sitcom &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot; (19651975), which featured a Liverpudlian socialist and a Cockney conservative in a regular argument.

==Origins==
Originally a small fishing village, Liverpool developed as a port. After the 1700s, it developed into a major international trading and industrial centre. The city consequently became a melting pot of several accents and dialects as sailors and migrants from different areas such as Wales and especially Ireland) established themselves in the area. Until the mid-19th century, the dominant local accent was similar to that of neighbouring areas of Lancashire. For instance, the comedian and actor Robb Wilton (1881–1957), despite coming from the Everton district of Liverpool, spoke with a dry Lancashire accent rather than a Scouse accent.

The influence of immigrants from Ireland (especially Dublin) and Northern Wales, as well as visiting Scandinavian sailors, contributed to a distinctive local Liverpool accent. The first reference to a distinctive Liverpool accent was in 1890. Linguist Gerald Knowles suggested that the accent&#x27;s nasal quality may have derived from poor public health in the 19th century, by which the prevalence of colds among many people over a long time resulted in a nasal accent coming to be regarded as the norm and copied by newer incomers learning the dialect of the local area. Scousers tend to speak at a higher pitch than most other English speakers, sometimes approaching falsetto.

==Academic research==
The Victorian phonetician Alexander John Ellis said that Liverpool and Birkenhead &quot;had no dialect proper&quot;, as he conceived of dialects as speech that had been passed down through generations from the earliest English speakers. Ellis did research some locations on the Wirral, but these respondents spoke in the traditional Cheshire dialect at the time and not in Scouse. The 1950s Survey of English Dialects recorded traditional Lancastrian dialect from the town of Halewood, finding no trace of Scouse influence. The phonetician John C. Wells wrote that &quot;the Scouse accent might as well not exist&quot; in &quot;The Linguistic Atlas of England&quot;, which was the Survey&#x27;s principal output.

An academic study of Scouse was undertaken by Gerald Knowles at the University of Leeds in 1973. He identified a key problem: that traditional dialect research had focused on developments from a single proto-language, but Scouse (and many other urban dialects) had resulted from interactions between an unknown number of languages.

==Phonology==

The phonemic notation used in this article is based on the set of symbols used by .

===Vowels===

* The square–nurse merger in Scouse renders minimal pairs such as &quot;fair&quot;-&quot;fur&quot;, &quot;stare&quot;-&quot;stir&quot; and &quot;pair&quot;-&quot;purr&quot; homophonous as , and . The actual realization is variable, but the current mainstream pronunciation is close to , as shown on the vowel chart. Other allophones include , , , and as well as the rounded and , with all but being more conservative than . In addition to those, there also exist the diphthongal variants and . Middle class speakers may differentiate from by using the front for the former (so that &quot;fair&quot;, &quot;stare&quot; and &quot;pair&quot; are rendered ) and the central for the latter (so that &quot;fur&quot;, &quot;stir&quot; and &quot;purr&quot; are rendered ), much like in RP.
* As other Northern English varieties, Scouse lacks the foot–strut split, so that words like &quot;cut&quot; , &quot;luck&quot; and &quot;up&quot; have the same phoneme as &quot;bull&quot; , &quot;foot&quot; and &quot;put&quot; . Speakers attempting to distinguish between the two typically use a stressed for the former set: , resulting in a Welsh English-like strut–schwa merger. However, this often leads to hypercorrection, so that &quot;good luck&quot; may be pronounced .
* Words such as &quot;grass&quot;, &quot;path&quot; and &quot;sample&quot; have a short , rather than the long due to the lack of the trap–bath split: . As with the foot–strut split, an attempt to use in an RP-like way may lead to hypercorrections such as (RP ).
* The words &quot;book&quot;, &quot;cook&quot; and &quot;look&quot; are typically pronounced with the vowel of rather than that of , which is true within other parts of Northern England and the Midlands. This causes minimal pairs such as &quot;book&quot; and &quot;buck&quot;, &quot;cook&quot; and &quot;cuck&quot;, and &quot;look&quot; and &quot;luck&quot;. The use of a long in such words is more often used in working-class accents; recently, however, this feature has been becoming more recessive, being found less often among younger people.
* The weak vowel merger is in transition, making some instances of unstressed merge with , so that &quot;eleven&quot; and &quot;orange&quot; are pronounced and . The typical g-dropped variant of &quot;ing&quot; is , which is subject to syllabic consonant formation (as in &quot;disputing&quot; ). As in Geordie, for standard may also occur, as in &quot;maggot&quot; .
* In final position, tend to be fronting/backing diphthongs with central onsets . Sometimes this also happens before in words such as &quot;school&quot; .
* The vowel is tense and is best analysed as belonging to the phoneme.
* There is not a full agreement on the phonetic realisation of :
** According to , it is back , with front being a common realisation for some speakers.
** According to and , it is typically front .
* The vowel is typically central , and it may be even fronted to so that it becomes the rounded counterpart of .
* The vowel typically has a front second element .
* The vowel is typically diphthongal , rather than being a monophthong that is commonly found in other Northern English accents.
* The vowel has a considerable allophonic variation. Its starting point can be open-mid front , close-mid front or mid central (similarly to the vowel), whereas its ending point varies between fairly close central and a more back . The most typical realisation is , but and an RP-like are also possible. John Wells also lists and , which are more common in Midland English and younger Northern English. To him, variants with central or front onsets sound &#x27;incongruously &quot;posh in combination with other broad Scouse vowels.
* The vowel can be monophthongised to in certain environments. According to and , the diphthongal realisation is quite close to the conservative RP norm (), but according to it has a rather back starting point ().
* The vowel is , close to the RP norm.

===Consonants===
* H-dropping, as in many other varieties of Northern England English. This renders &quot;hear&quot; , &quot;high&quot; and &quot;hold&quot; variably homophonous with &quot;ear&quot; , &quot;eye&quot; and &quot;old&quot; .
* NG-coalescence is not present as with other Northern English accents, for instance realising &quot;along&quot; as .
* Like many other accents around the world, G-dropping also occurs, with being the most common realization of the sequence.
* has several allophones depending on environment:
** Intervocalically (including at word boundaries), it is typically pronounced or , which is found in several other Northern English varieties.
**Pre-pausally, it may be debuccalised to , with older speakers only doing this in function words with short vowels: &quot;it&quot;, &quot;lot&quot;, &quot;not&quot;, &quot;that&quot;, &quot;what&quot; pronounced respectively. On the other hand, younger speakers may further debuccalise in polysyllabic words in unstressed syllables, hence &quot;aggregate&quot; . This is not differentiated from in this article.
**T-glottalisation is rarer than in the rest of England, with occurring before and syllabic consonants.
** Affrication of as word-initially and lenition to intervocalically and word-finally. The latter type of allophony does not lead to a loss of contrast with as the articulation is different; in addition, is also longer. For female speakers, the fricative allophone of is not necessarily but rather a complex sequence , so that &quot;out&quot; is pronounced , rather than . In this article, the difference is not transcribed and is used for the latter two allophones.
* can turn into an affricate or a fricative, determined mostly by the quality of the preceding vowel. If fricative, a palatal, velar or uvular articulation ( respectively) is realised. This is seen distinctively with words like &quot;book&quot; and &quot;clock&quot;.
* can be fricatised to , albeit rarely.
* As with other varieties of English, the voiceless plosives are aspirated word-initially, except when precedes in the same syllable. It can also occur word- and utterance-finally, with potential preaspirated pronunciations (which is often perceived as glottal noise or as oral friction produced in the same environment as the stop) for utterance-final environments, primarily found in female speakers.
* The voiced plosives are also fricatised, with particularly being lenited to the same extent as , although the fricative allophone is frequently devoiced.
* Under Irish influence, the dental stops are often used instead of the standard dental fricatives , leading to a phonemic distinction between dental and alveolar stops. The fricative forms are also found, whereas th-fronting is not as common.
* The accent is non-rhotic, meaning is not pronounced unless followed by a vowel. When it is pronounced, it is typically realised as a tap between vowels (as in &quot;mirror&quot; ) and sometimes in initial clusters as well (as in &quot;breath&quot; ) and as an approximant otherwise, a variant sometimes also used in lieu of the tap.

==International recognition==

Scouse is highly distinguishable from other English dialects. Because of this international recognition, Keith Szlamp made a request to IANA on 16 September 1996 to make it a recognised Internet dialect. After citing a number of references, the application was accepted on 25 May 2000 and now allows Internet documents that use the dialect to be categorised as Scouse by using the language tag &quot;en-Scouse&quot;.

Scouse has also become well-known globally as the accent of the Beatles. While the members of the band are famously from Liverpool, their accents have more in common with the older Lancashire-like Liverpool dialect found in the southern suburbs; the accent has evolved into Scouse since the 1960s.

<text>Thomas Ravenscroft ( – 1635) was an English musician, theorist and editor, notable as a composer of rounds and catches, and especially for compiling collections of English folk music.

==Biography==
Little is known of Ravenscroft&#x27;s early life. He probably sang in the choir of St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral from 1594, when a &quot;Thomas Raniscroft&quot; was listed on the choir rolls and remained there until 1600 under the directorship of Thomas Giles. He received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1605 from Cambridge.

Ravenscroft&#x27;s principal contributions are his collections of folk music, including catches, rounds, street cries, vendor songs, &quot;freeman&#x27;s songs&quot; and other anonymous music, in three collections: &quot;Pammelia&quot; (1609), &quot;Deuteromelia&quot; or &quot;The Second Part of Musicks Melodie&quot; (1609) and &quot;Melismata&quot; (1611), which contains one of the best-known works in his collections, The Three Ravens. Some of the music he compiled has acquired extraordinary fame, though his name is rarely associated with the music; for example &quot;Three Blind Mice&quot; first appears in &quot;Deuteromelia.&quot; He moved to Bristol where he published a metrical psalter (&quot;The Whole Booke of Psalmes&quot;) in 1621.

As a composer, his works are mostly forgotten but include 11 anthems, 3 motets for five voices and 4 fantasias for viols.

As a writer, he wrote two treatises on music theory. &quot;The Briefe Discourse of the True (but Neglected) Use of Charact&#x27;ring the Degrees&quot; (London, 1614) includes 20 songs as examples: seven by John Bennet, two by Edward Pearce and the rest by Ravenscroft himself. Of these, the group of dialect songs &#x27;Hodge und Malkyn&#x27; from the fifth a final section was nominated by Jeffrey Mark as the earliest example of a song-cycle in English music history. There is also &quot;A Treatise of Musick&quot;, which remains in manuscript (unpublished).

==Hymns==
* Hark the glad sound! the Saviour comes (to the words of Philip Doddridge)
* The Alternative version of &#x27;Dundee&#x27; hymn tune, 1615: Melody in the tenor part, harmonised, 1621.

<text>HMQS &quot;Gayundah was a [[flat-iron gunboat]] operated by the [[Colonial navies of Australia#Queensland|Queensland Maritime Defence Force]] and later the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (asHMAS &quot;Gayundah). She entered service in 1884 and was decommissioned and sold to a civilian company in 1921. She then served as sand and gravel barge in Brisbane until the 1950s, when she was scrapped. In 1958, &quot;Gayundah&quot; was run aground at Woody Point near Redcliffe, to serve as a breakwater structure.

==Construction==

In the 1870s the British military presence in Australia had declined and the individual colonies had begun planning for their own defence, culminating in the Jervois-Scratchley reports. Amidst concerns about Russian influence in the Pacific, in 1884 the Queensland Maritime Defence Force was established. The same year, the colony placed an order for its first vessels: a torpedo boat, HMQS &quot;Mosquito&quot;, and two gunboats, &quot;Gayundah&quot; and HMQS &quot;Paluma&quot;. 
Both &quot;Gayundah&quot; and &quot;Paluma&quot; belonged to a class of vessels that were built to a type B1 flat-iron gunboat design by builders Sir W.G. Armstrong, Mitchell &amp; Co. The very similar HMVS &quot;Albert&quot; was also built in 1884 and served with the colony of Victoria.

The ship displaced 360 tons, and she was long, had a beam and a draught of . &quot;Gayundah&quot; was propelled by horizontal direct action compound steam engines, which drove two screws that were capable of producing , giving her a range of at a cruising speed of . She also had sails to back up her engines. As built, her armament consisted of one BL gun, one BL gun, two 1.5-inch Nordenfelt guns and two machine guns. She had a complement of 55 men all ranks; her name was an Aboriginal word for &quot;lightning&quot;.

HMQS &quot;Gayundah&quot; was launched at Newcastle upon Tyne on 13 May 1884 and commissioned in the United Kingdom during October after completing trials. Construction cost 35,000 pounds sterling. &quot;Gayundah&quot; sailed for Australia in November 1884, under the command of Captain Henry Townley Wright. Having travelled via the Suez Canal, the ship arrived at Brisbane on 27 March 1885.

==Operational history==
During the first years of the gunboat&#x27;s operation, Wright, who was also the head of the Queensland Maritime Defence Force, found that his expenses exceeded his salary, and turned to appropriating government stores and alcohol for his own use. This, along with his conduct and attitude towards running the colony&#x27;s navy prompted the Queensland government to seek his removal in late 1887, although plans to immediately dismiss him were cancelled and it was determined that Wright was kept on until his appointment concluded at the end of 1888, with the proviso that he had not authority to acquire stores for &quot;Gayundah&quot;. In September 1888, Wright sought a leave of absence until the end of the year and the payment of his remaining salary as a lump sum: the former was agreed to, but Wright&#x27;s pay would continue to occur monthly, and he was ordered to turn &quot;Gayundah&quot; over to his second in command, Lieutenant Francis Pringle Taylor.

In response, Wright threatened to report what he saw as an insult to his position to the Admiralty, and had the gunboat loaded with coal and stores, ready to depart for Sydney. On 24 October, the Under Colonial Secretary instructed Taylor to take command of the ship. Wright interpreted Taylor&#x27;s actions as a mutiny, had him arrested, wrote several letters of protest to his superiors and others, ordered &quot;Gayundah&quot;″s aft 6-inch gun to be aimed at the Queensland Parliament, and threatened to take the gunboat to sea if further challenges to his authority were made. The colonial government dismissed him from his roles within the Maritime Defence Force, and a party of Queensland police boarded the ship with the intention of removing Wright by force if necessary. After failing to order them off his ship, Wright composed another letter of protest, released Taylor, and allowed himself to be escorted ashore by the police.

Over the next few years, &quot;Gayundah&quot; served as a training ship, and conducted the first ship to shore radio transmissions in Australia. However, with the depression of the 1890s, &quot;Gayundah&quot; was assigned to reserve duties in 1892, being reactivated yearly for Easter training. In 1899, the ship was refitted and her armament updated, with the 6-inch BL being replaced by a QF 4.7-inch gun and the two Nordenfelts being replaced by two QF 12-pounder guns.

Following the Federation of Australia, &quot;Gayundah&quot; and sister ship HMQS &quot;Paluma&quot; joined the Commonwealth Naval Forces in 1901. On 9 April 1903, the &quot;Gayundah&quot; transmitted the first wireless message received from a ship at sea to an Australian wireless station. The historic message sent to the receiving station in Brisbane read: &quot;Gun drill continued this afternoon and was fairly successful – blowing squally and raining – prize firing tomorrow. Marconi insulators were interfered with by rain but easily rectified and communication since has been good. Good night.&quot; The ship&#x27;s aerial was a tall bamboo pole lashed to the mast.
In March 1911, the Commonwealth Naval Forces became the Royal Australian Navy and &quot;Gayundah&quot; was redesignated HMAS &quot;Gayundah&quot;. From 22 April to 25 August 1911, at the instigation of the Departments of External Affairs and Trade &amp; Customs, &quot;Gayundah&quot; sailed under the command of Commander G.A.H. Curtis from Brisbane to Broome, Western Australia, to enforce Australia&#x27;s territorial boundary and fishing zone along the north-west coast of the continent. At Scott Reef, on 25 May, &quot;Gayundah&quot; boarded and detained two Dutch schooners with illegal catches of trepang (sea cucumber) and trochus shell, and escorted them into Broome on 29 May. She remained at Broome until mid-July so the ship&#x27;s officers could appear as witnesses in the resulting court case against the masters of the schooners. For this cruise, the 6-inch bow gun was removed to provide greater bunkering for coal and thereby increase the ship&#x27;s range.

Between January and August 1914 &quot;Gayundah&quot; underwent a significant refit at the Cockatoo Dockyard in Sydney. Changes during this time included work on her forecastle, improvement of her accommodation and sea-keeping characteristics, and the replacement of her 8-inch gun by a 4.7-inch gun. With the outbreak of World War I, &quot;Gayundah&quot; was assigned to coastal patrols of Moreton Bay and the east coast of Australia. In July 1915, one of &quot;Gayundah&quot;″s 12-pounder guns was removed. In 1917, due to the threat posed by German raiders such as , &quot;Gayundah&quot; patrolled off Port Jackson and in the Spencer Gulf, although she made no contact with enemy ships during this time.

==Decommissioning and fate==

Having reached the end of her naval career, &quot;Gayundah&quot; was paid off on 23 August 1918 in Melbourne. In 1921, she was sold to a civilian company, Brisbane Gravel Pty Ltd. Returning to Queensland, she was used to haul sand and gravel on the Brisbane River. In October 1930, while moored at Melton Reach, &quot;Gayundah&quot; sank, although she was raised soon after. She remained in service into the 1950s, when the decision was made to sell her for scrap. Early in 1958 she was taken to Bulimba Wharf under tow and stripped. The hull was later sold to the Redcliffe Town Council. &quot;Gayundah&quot; was beached on 2 June 1958, and now serves as a breakwater off the Woody Point cliffs near Redcliffe.

The guns were subsequently used for coastal defence. The 6 inch gun is preserved at the Australian War Memorial, as is a scale model of the ship acquired from Armstrong Whitworth &amp; Co. Ltd. in 1925.

<doc id="339908" wikidata="Q4996627" url="?curid=339908" title="Bull Shoals-White River State Park">
<text>Bull Shoals-White River State Park is a Arkansas state park in Baxter and Marion Counties, Arkansas in the United States. Containing one of the nation&#x27;s best trout-fishing streams, the park entered the system in 1955 after the United States Army Corps of Engineers built Bull Shoals Dam on the White River. The park runs along the shoreline of Bull Shoals Lake and the White River above and below the dam, and contains picnic areas, a marina, boat rentals, interpretive programs, and a visitors&#x27; center with gift shop.

==History==

Initially a flood control and power generation measure, construction on Bull Shoals Dam began in 1947 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Upon completion in 1951, the Corps rented the shoreline to Arkansas, who used the site as a primitive camping spot with no amenities. The state began to upgrade the services at its parks in 1975, adding a wastewater treatment plant, restrooms, and campsites to the park. The park roads were also paved. A run down lodge, formerly used as an overnight stay for dam workers, was removed in 1979.

==Recreation==

The park offers 103 riverside campsites, 30 class AAA, 1 class AA, 4 class A, 48 class B, and 20 tent sites. Two rent-a-camp and two rent-a-RV sites are also available. Picnic areas and pavilions are scattered throughout the park, along with trails through the surrounding woods. A marina contains boating equipment and also rents boats. The visitors&#x27; center offers programs, workshops, camps, boating and fishing exhibits and an aquarium. Tours of the power generation plant and other dam facilities are available for a fee.

Bull Shoals Lake is Arkansas&#x27;s largest lake, and is well known as a trout hot spot. Rainbow trout and brown trout of record size have been caught in the lake, with bream, catfish, crappie and largemouth bass also plentiful. Swimming and other watersports are also welcome at the lake.

<text>Cane Creek State Park is a Arkansas state park in Lincoln County, Arkansas in the United States. Straddling the Gulf Coastal Plain and the Mississippi Delta, the park includes the Cane Creek Lake, a wooded lake which borders Bayou Bartholomew, the world&#x27;s longest bayou. The park became a reality when the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Soil Conservation Service said it would provide federal funds to the project in 1973, prompting the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission (AGFC) to pledge to build and maintain the lake within the park. The park is characterized by rolling wooded hills, deep draws, and steeply sloping ridges.

==Recreation==
Cane Creek State Park offers many different opportunities for outdoor fun such as kayaking, fishing, mountain biking, backpacking, hiking, and geocaching. The Cane Creek Lake Trail is trail available for hiking or biking that offers hunting along the portion owned by the AGFC. The trail features several unique geological formations as a result of the Gulf Coast Plain meeting the Delta. The camping facilities include 29 class B campsites and one rent-a-RV. A climate-controlled pavilion and traditional pavilion as well as picnic tables are also available for use.

Visitors can rent kayaks and canoes for use on the lake, or spend time in the visitors&#x27; center, which contains exhibits and a gift shop.

<doc id="339916" wikidata="Q5051846" url="?curid=339916" title="Category killer">
<text>A category killer is a retailer, often a big-box store, that specializes in and carries a large product assortment of a given category. Through their wide merchandise selections, low pricing, deep supply, large buying power, and market penetration, they have a comparative advantage over other, smaller retailers, and can greatly reduce the sales of rival retailers within that category, in the area and beyond it.

In essence, they are a price- or discount-based specialist mass-retailer. Chains such as OfficeMax, Best Buy, Barnes &amp; Noble, and Hobby Lobby have been considered category killers.

Once typically found in power centers, increasingly they are found in or adjacent to (as an outbuilding of) repurposed traditional malls.

Large category killer stores are mostly in mid- and large-sized cities, because a large population is required to be feasible.

== Impact ==
Local merchants in cities with category killers &quot;may suffer a substantial reduction in sales,&quot; and stores in a wider radius can be affected by the draw. Between 1983 and 1993, Iowans spent 31% less in hardware stores, translating to a loss of 37% in the same time to those stores as a result of category killer stores.

== Canadian retailers ==


== United States retailers ==
Sporting goods stores that are category killers range in footprint from .Home Depot carries 30,000 items in stores.

<doc id="339918" wikidata="Q7958518" url="?curid=339918" title="W postcode area">
<text>The W (Western and Paddington) postcode area, also known as the London W postcode area is a group of postcode districts covering part of central and part of West London, England. The area originates from the Western (W1) and Paddington (W2-14) districts of the London postal district. This area covers 35 postcode districts and around 18,554 live postcodes.

==Postal administration==
The Western district consists of the single original W1 postal district. The area that it covers is high-density and so has been subdivided into a number of smaller postcode districts. When districts are used for purposes other than the sorting of mail, such as use as a geographic reference and on street signs, the W1 subdivisions continue to be classed as one &#x27;district&#x27;. In June 2000, there was a recoding of the area, with the W1M, W1N, W1P, W1R, W1V, W1X and W1Y districts being replaced.

The mail centre for W1 is London Central, and that for W2-14 is Greenford.

Deliveries for W1 (and for WC1 and WC2) came from the Western District Office on Rathbone Place until it was decommissioned. It was a stop on the former London Post Office Railway, which has been mothballed since 2003. The Western District Office was initially on Wimpole Street, which was also a stop on the London Post Office Railway.

The Paddington district has 13 postcode districts (W2–14). Other than W2, the districts are arranged alphabetically, run from W3 (Acton) to W14 (West Kensington) and radiate westwards. The Paddington Head District Sorting Office was the western terminus of the London Post Office Railway, which ran to the Eastern District Office, at Whitechapel.

==Boundaries==
Postcode districts W1 and W2 are central to London, and W3 to W14 are mostly further west. The boundaries of the area and its numbered districts have changed over time and are the result of the working requirements of the Royal Mail. The boundaries do not coincide with the local authority areas. W1 is almost entirely in the City of Westminster, with a small part in the London Borough of Camden. W2 to W14 cover the northwestern part of the City of Westminster, the northern parts of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham and the eastern parts of the London Boroughs of Ealing and Hounslow, as well as very small parts of the London Boroughs of Brent and Camden.

==In popular culture==
The TV series &quot;W1A&quot; satirises the goings-on at the BBC&#x27;s Broadcasting House in Portland Place, whose memorable postcode is W1A 1AA.

AJ Tracey released the 2020 track &quot;West Ten&quot;, which refers to the Ladbroke Grove area.
