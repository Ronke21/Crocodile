<text>Rawalpindi (Pothwari, ; ) is the third-largest city in the Pakistani province of Punjab. It is a commercial and metropolitan city, being the fourth most populous in Pakistan. It is located near the Soan River in north-western Punjab, and is the largest Pothwari-speaking city in the world. Rawalpindi is situated adjacent to Pakistan&#x27;s capital Islamabad, and the two are jointly known as &quot;twin cities&quot; because of the social and economic links between them. Prior to Islamabad&#x27;s establishment, Rawalpindi served as the country&#x27;s secondary capital from 1959 to 1967.

Located on the Pothohar Plateau of northern Punjab, Rawalpindi remained a small town of little importance up until the 18th century. The region is known for its ancient heritage, for instance the neighbouring city of Taxila, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In 1765, the ruling Gakhars were defeated and the city came under Sukerchakia Misl. During the Sikh-era, Rawalpindi, from a small regional town, became an important city in regards to trade and its strategic location within Punjab. The city&#x27;s &quot;Babu Mohallah&quot; neighbourhood was once home to a community of Jewish traders who had fled Mashhad, Persia, in the 1830s.

Punjab was conquered by the East India Company in 1849, in the aftermath of Second Anglo-Sikh War, and in the late 19th century Rawalpindi became the largest garrison town of the British Indian Army&#x27;s Northern command as its climate suited the British authorities. The city was established as the headquarters of the Rawalpindi Division of British Punjab, this elevated Rawalpindi&#x27;s status to one the largest metropolitan centres in colonial Punjab. Following the partition of British India in 1947, the city became home to the headquarters of the Pakistan Army.

In 1951, the Rawalpindi conspiracy took place in which leftist army officers conspired to depose the first elected-Prime Minister of Pakistan, Liaquat Ali Khan. Rawalpindi later became site of Liaquat Ali Khan&#x27;s assassination. On 27 December 2007, it was the site of the assassination of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto.

Construction of Pakistan&#x27;s new purpose-built national capital city of Islamabad in 1961 led to greater investment in the city provided by Imf and local banks, as well as a brief stint as the country&#x27;s capital before the completion of Islamabad. Modern Rawalpindi is socially and economically intertwined with Islamabad, and the greater metropolitan area. The city is also home to numerous suburban housing developments that serve as bedroom-communities for workers in Islamabad. As home to the GHQ of the Pakistan Army, Joint Staff Headquarters (JS HQ), and PAF Base Nur Khan, and with connections to the M-1 and M-2 motorways, Rawalpindi is a major logistics and transportation centre for northern Pakistan. The city is also home to historic havelis and temples, and serves as a hub for tourists visiting Rohtas Fort, Azad Kashmir, Taxila and Gilgit-Baltistan.

== Etymology ==
Previously known as &quot;Fatehpur Baori&quot;, the city fell into decay during the Mongol invasions of the fourteenth century. Afterwards, the ruined city came in hand of the Gakhars and a chief named &quot;Jhanda Khan&quot; restored it naming it Rawalpindi in 1493, literally meaning the &quot;Village of Rawal&quot;. Some accounts propose that a group of yogis (ascetics) named Rawals arrived in this area with their leader, a head yogi named &#x27;Rawal&#x27;, and settled here with their followers.

Another theory suggests that the city was named after Bappa Rawal for his role in leading a strong resistance against invasions from Middle Eastern countries; however, this is the most credible historical evidence that is available to date.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
The region around Rawalpindi has been inhabited for thousands of years. Rawalpindi falls within the ancient boundaries of Gandhara, and is thus in a region containing many Buddhist ruins. In the region north-west of Rawalpindi, traces have been found of at least 55 stupas, 28 Buddhist monasteries, 9 temples, and various artifacts in the Kharoshthi script.

To the southeast are the ruins of the Mankiala stupa – a second-century stupa where, according to the Jataka tales, a previous incarnation of the Buddha leapt off a cliff in order to offer his corpse to seven hungry tiger cubs. The nearby town of Taxila is thought to have been home to one of the early universities or education centres of South Asia.

=== Medieval ===
The first mention of Rawalpindi&#x27;s earliest settlement dates from when Mahmud of Ghazni destroyed Rawalpindi and the town was restored by &quot;Gakhar&quot; chief &quot;Kai Gohar&quot; in the early 11th century. The town fell into decay again after Mongol invasions in the 14th century. Situated along an invasion route, the settlement did not prosper and remained deserted until 1493, when &quot;Jhanda Khan&quot; Gakhar re-established the ruined town, and named it &quot;Rawal&quot;.

=== Mughal ===

During the Mughal era, Rawalpindi remained under the rule of the Ghakhar clan, who in turn pledged allegiance to the Mughal Empire. The city was developed as an important outpost in order to guard the frontiers of the Mughal realm. Gakhars fortified a nearby caravanserai, in the 16th century, transforming it into the Rawat Fort in order to defend the Pothohar plateau from Sher Shah Suri&#x27;s forces. Construction of the Attock Fort in 1581 after Akbar led a campaign against his brother Mirza Muhammad Hakim, further securing Rawalpindi&#x27;s environs. In December 1585, the Emperor Akbar arrived in Rawalpindi, and remained in and around Rawalpindi for 13 years as he extended the frontiers of the empire, in an era described as a &quot;glorious period&quot; in his career as Emperor.

With the onset of chaos and rivalry between Gakhar chiefs after the death of Kamal Khan in 1559, Rawalpindi was awarded to Said Khan by the Mughal Emperor. Emperor Jehangir visited the royal camp in Rawalpindi in 1622, where he first learned of Shah Abbas I of Persia&#x27;s plan to invade Kandahar.

=== Sikh Misl ===
Rawalpindi declined in importance as Mughal power declined, until the town was captured in the mid-1760s from Muqarrab Khan Gakhar by the Sikhs under Sardar Gujjar Singh and his son Sahib Singh. The city&#x27;s administration was handed to Sardar Milkha Singh, who then invited traders from the neighbouring commercial centers of Jhelum and Shahpur to settle in the territory in 1766. The city then began to prosper, although the population in 1770 is estimated to have been only about 300 families. Rawalpindi became for a time the refuge of Shah Shuja, the exiled king of Afghanistan, and of his brother Shah Zaman in the early 19th century.

=== Sikh Empire ===
Sikh ruler Maharaja Ranjit Singh allowed the son of Sardar Milkha Singh to continue as Governor of Rawalpindi, after Ranjit Singh seized the district in 1810. Sikh rule over Rawalpindi was consolidated by defeat of the Afghans at Haidaran in July 1813. The Sikh rulers allied themselves with some of the local Gakhar tribes, and jointly defeated Syed Ahmad Barelvi at Akora Khattak in 1827, and again in 1831 in Balakot. Jews first arrived in Rawalpindi&#x27;s &quot;Babu Mohallah&quot; neighbourhood from Mashhad, Persia in 1839, in order to flee from anti-Jewish laws instituted by the Qajar dynasty. In 1841, Diwan Kishan Kaur was appointed &quot;Sardar&quot; of Rawalpindi.

On 14 March 1849, Sardar Chattar Singh and Raja Sher Singh of the Sikh Empire surrendered to General Gilbert near Rawalpindi, ceding the city to the British. The Sikh Empire then came to an end on 29 March 1849.

=== British ===
Following Rawalpindi&#x27;s capture by the British East India Company, 53rd Regiment of the company army took quarters in the newly captured city. The decision to man a permanent military cantonment in the city was made in 1851 by the Marquess of Dalhousie.

The city saw its first telegraph office in the early 1850s. The city&#x27;s Garrison Church was built shortly after in 1854, and is the site where Robert Milman, Bishop of Calcutta, was buried following his death in Rawalpindi in 1876. The city was home to 15,913 people in the 1855 census. During the 1857 Sepoy Mutiny, the area&#x27;s Gakhars and Janjua tribes remained loyal to the British.
Numerous civil and military buildings were built during the British era, and the Municipality of Rawalpindi was constituted in 1867, while the city&#x27;s population as per the 1868 census was 19,228, with another 9,358 people residing in the city&#x27;s cantonment.

The city was also connected to railways that offered connection to India and the northwest frontier in Peshawar in the 1880s. The Commissariat Steam Flour Mills were the first such mills in Punjab, and supplied most of the needs of British cantonments throughout Punjab. Rawalpindi&#x27;s cantonment served as a feeder to other cantonments throughout the region.

Rawalpindi flourished as a commercial centre, though the city remained largely devoid of an industrial base during the British era. A large portion of Kashmir&#x27;s external trade passing through the city; in 1885, 14% of Kashmir&#x27;s exports, and 27% of its imports passed through the city. A large market was opened in central Rawalpindi in 1883 by Sardar Sujan Singh, while the British further developed a shopping district for the city&#x27;s elite known as &quot;Saddar&quot; with an archway built to commemorate Brigadier General Massey.

Rawalpindi&#x27;s cantonment became a major centre of military power of the Raj after an arsenal was established in 1883. Britain&#x27;s army elevated the city from a small town, to the third largest city in Punjab by 1921. In 1868, 9,358 people lived in the city&#x27;s cantonment – by 1891, the number rose to 37,870. In 1891, the city&#x27;s population excluding the Cantonment was 34,153. The city was considered to be a favourite first posting for newly arrived soldiers from England, owing to the city&#x27;s agreeable climate, and the nearby hill station of Murree.

In 1901, Rawalpindi was made the winter headquarters of the Northern Command and of the Rawalpindi military division. Riots broke out against British rule in 1905, following a famine in Punjab that peasants were led to believe was a deliberate act.

During World War I, Rawalpindi District &quot;stood first&quot; among districts in recruiting for the British war effort, with greater financial assistance from the British government channeled into the area in return.

By 1921, Rawalpindi&#x27;s cantonment had overshadowed the city – Rawalpindi was one of seven cities of Punjab in which over half the population lived in the cantonment district. Communal riots erupted between Rawalpindi&#x27;s Sikh and Muslim communities in 1926 after Sikhs refused to silence music from a procession that was passing in front of a mosque.

 was launched as an ocean liner in 1925 by Harland and Wolff, the same company which built . The ship was converted into an armed vessel, and was sunk in October 1939. Scientists from Porton Down carried out poison gas tests on British Indian Army soldiers during the Rawalpindi experiments over the course of more than a decade beginning in the 1930s.

=== Partition ===

On 5 March 1947, members of Rawalpindi&#x27;s Hindu and Sikh communities took a procession against the formation of a Muslim ministry within the Government of Punjab. Policemen fired upon protestors, while Hindus and Sikhs fought against weaker Muslim counter-protestors. The area&#x27;s first Partition riots erupted the next day on 6 March 1947, when the city&#x27;s Muslims, angered by the actions of Hindus and Sikhs and encouraged by the Pir of Golra Sharif, raided nearby villages after they were unable to do so in the city on account of Rawalpindi&#x27;s heavily armed Sikhs.

At the dawn of Pakistan&#x27;s independence in 1947 following the success of the Pakistan Movement, Rawalpindi was 43.79% Muslim, while Rawalpindi District as a whole was 80% Muslim. The region, on account of its large Muslim majority, was thus awarded to Pakistan. Rawalpindi&#x27;s Hindu and Sikh population, who had made up 33.72% and 17.32% of the city, migrated &quot;en masse&quot; to the newly independent Dominion of India after anti-Hindu and anti-Sikh pogroms in western Punjab, while Muslim refugees from India settled in the city following anti-Muslim pogroms in eastern Punjab and northern India.

=== Modern ===

In the years following independence, Rawalpindi saw an influx of Muhajir, Pashtun and Kashmiri settlers. Having been the largest British Cantonment in the region at the dawn of Pakistan&#x27;s independence, Rawalpindi was chosen as headquarters for the Pakistani Army, despite the fact that Karachi had been selected as the first capital.

In 1951, the Rawalpindi conspiracy took place in which leftist army officers conspired to depose the first elected Prime Minister of Pakistan, Liaquat Ali Khan. Rawalpindi later became the site of the Liaquat Ali Khan&#x27;s assassination, in what is now known as Liaquat Bagh Park. In 1958, Field Marshal Ayub Khan launched his &quot;coup d&#x27;etat&quot; from Rawalpindi. In 1959, the city became the interim capital of the country under Ayub Khan, who had sought the creation of a new planned capital of Islamabad in the vicinity of Rawalpindi. As a result, Rawalpindi saw most major central government offices and institutions relocate to nearby territory, and its population rapidly expand.

The construction of Pakistan&#x27;s new capital city of Islamabad in 1961 led to greater investment in Rawalpindi. Rawalpindi remained the headquarters of the Pakistani Army after the capital shifted to Islamabad in 1969, while the Pakistan Air Force continues to maintain an airbase in the Chaklala district of Rawalpindi. The military dictatorship of General Zia ul Haq hanged Pakistan&#x27;s deposed Prime Minister, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, in Rawalpindi in 1979.

In 1980, tens of thousands of Shia protestors led by Mufti Jaffar Hussain marched to Rawalpindi to protest a provision of Zia ul Haqs Islamization programme. A spate of bombings in September 1987 took place in the city killing 5 people, in attacks that are believed to have been orchestrated by agents of Afghanistan&#x27;s communist government.

On 10 April 1988, Rawalpindi&#x27;s Ojhri Camp, an ammunition depot for Afghan mujahideen fighting against Soviet forces in Afghanistan, exploded and killed many in Rawalpindi and Islamabad. At the time, the New York Times reported more than 93 were killed and another 1,100 wounded; many believe that the toll was much higher.

Riots erupted in Rawalpindi in 1992 as mobs attacked Hindu temples in retaliation for the destruction of the Babri Masjid in India. On 27 December 2007, Rawalpindi was the site of the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.

Modern Rawalpindi is socially and economically intertwined with Islamabad, and the greater metropolitan area. The city is also home to numerous suburban housing developments that serve as bedroom-communities for workers in Islamabad. In June 2015, the Rawalpindi-Islamabad Metrobus, a new bus rapid transit line with various points in Islamabad, opened for service.

== Geography ==


=== Climate ===

Rawalpindi features a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: Cwa) with hot and wet summers, a cooler and drier winter. Rawalpindi and its twin city Islamabad, during the year experiences an average of 91 thunderstorms, which is the highest frequency of any plain elevation city in the country. Strong windstorms are frequent in the summer during which wind gusts have been reported by Pakistan Meteorological Department to have reached . In such thunder/wind storms, which results in some damage of infrastructure. The weather is highly variable due to the proximity of the city to the foothills of Himalayas.

The average annual rainfall is , most of which falls in the summer monsoon season. However, westerly disturbances also bring quite significant rainfall in the winter. In summer, the record maximum temperature has soared to recorded in June 1954, while it has dropped to a minimum of several occasions, though the last of which was in January 1967.

=== Cityscape ===

Social structures in Rawalpindi&#x27;s historic core centre around neighbourhoods, each known as a &quot;Mohallah&quot;. Each neighbourhood is served by a nearby bazaar (market) and mosque, which in turn serves as a place where people can gather for trade and manufacturing. Each &quot;Mohallah&quot; has narrow &quot;gallies&quot; (streets), and the grouping of houses around short lanes and cul-de-sacs lends a sense of privacy and security to residents of each neighbourhood. Major intersections in the neighbourhood are each referred to as a &quot;chowk&quot;.

Rawalpindi is relatively a new city contrasted with Pakistan&#x27;s millennia-old cities such as Lahore, Multan, and Peshawar. South of Rawalpindi&#x27;s historic core, and across the Lai Nullah, are the wide lanes of the Rawalpindi Cantonment. With tree-lined avenues and historic architecture, the cantonment was the main European area developed during British colonial rule. British colonialists also built the Saddar Bazaar south of the historic core, which served as a retail center geared towards Europeans in the city. Beyond the cantonment are the large suburban housing developments that serve as bedroom communities for Islamabad&#x27;s commuter population.

== Demographics ==
The population of Rawalpindi is 2,098,231 in 2017. 84% of the population is Pothwari, 9% is Pashtun, and 7% is from other ethnic groups.

96.7% of Rawalpindi&#x27;s population is Muslim, 3.1% is Christian, 0.2% belong to other religious groups. The city&#x27;s &quot;Kohaati Bazaar&quot; is site of large Shia mourning-processions for Ashura. The neighbourhoods of &quot;Waris Shah Mohallah&quot; and &quot;Pir Harra Mohallah&quot; form the core of Muslim settlement in Rawalpindi&#x27;s old city.

Prior to partition there was a sizable Sikh and Hindu community living in Rawalpindi. Today, the city is still home to a few hundred Hindu families. Despite the fact that the vast majority of the city&#x27;s Hindus fled &quot;en masse&quot; to India after Partition, most Hindu temples in the old city remain standing, although in disrepair and often abandoned. Many of the old city&#x27;s neighbourhoods continue to bear Hindu and Sikh names, such as Krishanpura, Aria Mohallah, Akaal Garh, Mohanpura, Amarpura, Kartarpura, Bagh Sardaraan, Angatpura.

Rawalpindi was a majority Hindu and Sikh city prior to the Partition of India in 1947, combined composing 51.05 percent of the total population according to the 1941 census. The same census detailed Muslims made up 43.79 percent of the total population. The Baba Dyal Singh Gurdwara in Rawalpindi was where the reformist Nirankari movement of Sikhism originated. The city still has a small Sikh population, but has been bolstered by the arrival of Sikhs fleeing political instability in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

The Shri Krishna Mandir is the only functional Hindu temple in Rawalpindi. It was built in the Kabarri Bazaar in 1897. Other temples are abandoned or were repurposed. Rawalpindi&#x27;s large Kalyan Das Temple from 1880 has been used as the &quot;Gov&#x27;t. Qandeel Secondary School for the Blind&quot; since 1973. The Ram Leela Temple in &quot;Kanak Mandi&quot;, and the Kaanji Mal Ujagar Mal Ram Richpal Temple in the Kabarri Bazaar, are both currently used to house Kashmiri refugees. Mohan Temple in the &quot;Lunda Bazaar&quot; remains standing, but is abandoned and the building no longer used for any purpose. The city&#x27;s &quot;Shamshan Ghat&quot; serves as the city&#x27;s cremation grounds, and was partly renovated in 2012.

The city&#x27;s &quot;Babu Mohallah&quot; neighbourhood was once home to a community of Jewish traders who had fled Mashhad, Persia in the 1830s.

In the British era many churches were built for the British soldiers to come to the churches for Sunday prayer because
Rawalpindi Cantonment was the home for the British Army.

<text>The Kola Superdeep Borehole SG-3 () is the deepest human-made hole on Earth (since 1979), which attained maximum true vertical depth of in 1989. It is the result of a scientific drilling effort to penetrate as deeply as possible into the Earth&#x27;s crust conducted by the Soviet Union in the Pechengsky District of the Kola Peninsula, near the Russian border with Norway.

SG (СГ) is a Russian designation for a set of superdeep () boreholes conceived as part of a Soviet scientific research programme of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. Aralsor SG-1 (in the Pre-Caspian Basin of west Kazakhstan) and Biyikzhal SG-2 (in Krasnodar Krai), both less than deep, preceded Kola SG-3, which was originally intended to reach deep. Drilling at Kola SG-3 began in 1970 using the &quot;Uralmash-4E&quot;, and later the &quot;Uralmash-15000&quot; series drilling rig. A total of five boreholes were drilled, two branching from a central shaft and two from one of those branches.

In addition to being the deepest human-made hole on Earth, Kola Superdeep Borehole SG-3 was, for almost three decades, the world&#x27;s longest borehole in measured depth along its bore, until surpassed in 2008 by a hydrocarbon extraction borehole at the Al Shaheen Oil Field in Qatar.

==Drilling==
Drilling at Kola SG-3 began on 24 May 1970 using the Uralmash-4E, a serial drilling rig used for drilling oil wells. The rig was slightly modified to be able to reach a depth. In 1974, the new purpose-built Uralmash-15000 drilling rig was installed onsite, named after the new target depth, set at .

On 6 June 1979, the world depth record then held by the Bertha Rogers hole in Washita County, Oklahoma, United States, at , was broken by Kola SG-3. In October 1982, Kola SG-3&#x27;s first hole reached . 

The second hole was started in January 1983 from a depth of the first hole. In 1983, the drill passed in the second hole, and drilling was stopped for about a year for numerous scientific and celebratory visits to the site. This idle period may have contributed to a breakdown after drilling resumed; on 27 September 1984, after drilling to , a section of the drill string twisted off and was left in the hole. Drilling was restarted in September 1986, from the first hole.

The third hole reached in 1989. In that year, the hole depth was expected to reach by the end of 1990 and by 1993. In June 1990, a breakdown occurred in the third hole at of depth.

The drilling of the fourth hole was started in January 1991 from of depth of third hole. The drilling of the fourth hole was stopped in April 1992 at of depth. 

Drilling of the fifth hole started in April 1994 from of depth of the third hole. Drilling was stopped in August 1994 at of depth due to lack of funds, and the well itself was .

==Research==
The stated areas of study of the Kola Superdeep Borehole were the deep structure of the Baltic Shield, seismic discontinuities and the thermal regime in the Earth&#x27;s crust, the physical and chemical composition of the deep crust and the transition from upper to lower crust, lithospheric geophysics, and to create and develop technologies for deep geophysical study. Drilling penetrated about a third of the way through the Baltic Shield of the continental crust, estimated to be around deep, reaching Archean rocks at the bottom. Numerous unexpected geophysical discoveries were made:

* During the drilling process, the expected basaltic layers at down were never found, nor were basaltic layers at any depth. There were instead more granites, deeper than predicted. The prediction of a transition at 7 kilometres was based on seismic waves indicating discontinuity, which could have been caused by a transition between rocks, or a metamorphic transition in the granite itself. 
* Water pooled below the surface,&lt;ref name=&quot;95/01953&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; having percolated up through the granite until it reached a layer of impermeable rock. This water did not naturally vaporize at any depth in the borehole.
* The drilling mud that flowed out of the hole was described as &quot;boiling&quot; with an unexpected level of hydrogen gas.
* Microscopic plankton fossils were found below the surface.

In 1992, an international geophysical experiment obtained a reflection seismic crustal cross-section through the well. The Kola-92 working group consisted of researchers from the universities of Glasgow and Edinburgh in the United Kingdom, the University of Wyoming in the United States, and the University of Bergen in Norway, as well as several Russian earth science research institutions.
The experiment was documented in a video recorded by Professor David Smythe,
which shows the drilling deck in action during an attempt to recover a tool dropped down the hole.

==Status==

The drilling ended in 1995 due to a lack of funding. The scientific team was transferred to the federal state unitary subsidiary enterprise &quot;Kola Superdeep,&quot; downsized, and given the new task of thoroughly studying the exposed section. In 2007, the scientific team was dissolved and the equipment was transferred to a private company and partially liquidated.

In 2008, the company was liquidated due to unprofitability, and the site was abandoned. It is still visited by sightseers, who report that the structure over the borehole has been partially destroyed or removed.

==Similar projects==
* The United States had embarked on a similar project in 1957, dubbed Project Mohole, which was intended to penetrate the shallow crust under the Pacific Ocean off Mexico. After initial drilling, the project was abandoned in 1966 when funding was cut off. This program inspired the Ocean Drilling Program, Integrated Ocean Drilling Program, and the present International Ocean Discovery Program.
* The KTB superdeep borehole (German Continental Deep Drilling Programme, 1987–1995) at Windischeschenbach in northern Bavaria was drilled to a depth of , reaching temperatures of more than . Its ambitious measuring program used high-temperature logging tools that were upgraded specifically for KTB.
* In 2023, China embarked on a super-deep borehole in the Tarim Basin in the Xinjiang region for scientific, oil and gas exploration. In March 2024, drilling of the borehole, which is known as Shendi Take 1, reached a depth of 10,000 metres.

==Records==
The deep Kola Superdeep Borehole has been the world&#x27;s deepest borehole since 1979. It was also the longest borehole in the world from 1979 to 2008. Its record length was surpassed in May 2008 by the curved extended reach drilling bore of well BD-04A in the Al Shaheen Oil Field in Qatar, which attained a total length of but depth of just .

<text>Emperor Chong of Han (; 143 – 15 February 145) was an emperor of the Chinese Han dynasty and the ninth emperor of the Eastern Han period.

Emperor Chong was the only son of Emperor Shun. He ascended the throne at the age of one and reigned less than six months. During his reign, Empress Dowager Liang and her brother Liang Ji presided over all government affairs. While the empress dowager herself appeared to be open-minded and honest, she overly trusted her corrupt brother, and this led to corruptions and as a result the peasants suffered greatly.

Emperor Chong died in February 145. He was just two years old.

==Family background==
Then-Prince Bing was born to Emperor Shun and his concubine Consort Yu in 143. Virtually nothing is known about his mother, other than that she entered the palace when she was 12 (but it is not known what year that was), and that she was also the mother of Prince Bing&#x27;s sister Princess Sheng. He was Emperor Shun&#x27;s only son.

On 3 June 144, Emperor Shun, apparently already ill, created Prince Bing crown prince. Less than four months later, Emperor Shun died, and Crown Prince Bing, at the age of one, ascended the throne as Emperor Chong.

==Brief reign==
As Emperor Chong was only a toddler, Emperor Shun&#x27;s wife Empress Dowager Liang served as regent. She apparently was fairly diligent and open-minded in her duties, but her major fault was in trusting her corrupt and violent brother Liang Ji (), who was the most powerful official in the administration. (While Emperor Shun was still alive, Liang Ji was already the most powerful official, but the near-absolute power that he wielded became even more evident after Emperor Shun&#x27;s death.) When the capable official Huangfu Gui (; uncle of Huangfu Song) submitted a report that, in circumspect language, suggested that Liang Ji and his brother Liang Buyi () be humble and live more thriftly, Liang removed Huangfu from his post and tried several times to falsely accuse him of capital crimes.

During Emperor Chong&#x27;s reign, agrarian revolts, which were already a problem late in Emperor Shun&#x27;s reign, became more serious—and even the tomb of Emperor Shun was dug up by bandits.

In February 145, Emperor Chong died. Empress Dowager Liang was initially going to keep Emperor Chong&#x27;s death a secret until she would decide on who the successor would be, but she listened to the key official Li Gu () and decided to properly and publicly announce Emperor Chong&#x27;s death immediately. She summoned Emperor Chong&#x27;s third cousins Liu Suan (), the Prince of Qinghe, and Liu Zuan (), the son of Liu Hong (), Prince Xiao of Bohai, to the capital, and considered the two of them. Liu Suan was apparently an adult (although history did not record his age) and was described as solemn and proper, and the officials largely favored him. However, Liang Ji wanted a younger emperor so that he could remain in absolute control longer, and he persuaded Empress Dowager Liang to make the seven-year-old Prince Zuan as emperor (as Emperor Zhi).

Emperor Chong, having died in young childhood, was buried in his father&#x27;s tomb complex in order to save costs.

Long after Emperor Chong&#x27;s death, in November 175, Emperor Ling bestowed on Emperor Chong&#x27;s mother Consort Yu a more elevated imperial consort title (貴人, &quot;Guiren&quot;) than her original title (美人, &quot;Meiren&quot;) in recognition of her status as an emperor&#x27;s mother.

<text>Harkness Tower is a masonry tower at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. Part of the Collegiate Gothic Memorial Quadrangle complex completed in 1922, it is named for Charles William Harkness, brother of Yale&#x27;s largest benefactor, Edward Harkness.

==History==

The tower was constructed between 1917 and 1921 as part of the Memorial Quadrangle donated to Yale by Anna M. Harkness in honor of her recently deceased son, Charles William Harkness, an 1883 Yale graduate. When the residential college system was inaugurated in 1933, the tower became part of Branford College.

It was designed by James Gamble Rogers, a Yale College classmate of Anna Harkness&#x27;s other son, Edward S. Harkness. James S. Hedden was the contractor&#x27;s supervisor for the project and took many photographs of the construction&#x27;s progress.

The tower underwent renovations from September 2009 to May 2010 to repair its masonry and ornament.

==Influence==
Harkness Tower was the first &quot;couronne&quot; (&quot;crown&quot;) tower in English Perpendicular Gothic style built in the modern era. James Gamble Rogers, who designed the tower and many of Yale&#x27;s Collegiate Gothic structures, said it was inspired by the 15th-century Boston Stump, the tower of the parish church of St Botolph in Boston, Lincolnshire and tallest parish church tower in England. Rogers also based some details on the 16th-century tower of St Giles&#x27; Church in Wrexham, Wales, where Elihu Yale is buried. In turn, Harkness Tower has been identified as the direct influence for the tower of the Cathedral of Christ the King in Hamilton, Ontario.

The tower&#x27;s image was adopted by the &quot;Yale Herald&quot;, a weekly student newspaper, for its masthead.

==Design==

Harkness Tower is 216 feet (66 m) tall, one foot for each year since Yale&#x27;s founding at the time it was built. From a square base, it rises in stages to a double stone crown on an octagonal base, and at the top are stone finials. From the street level to the roof, there are 284 steps.

Midway to the top, four openwork copper clockfaces tell the hours. The bells of the carillon are behind the clockfaces, fixed to a frame made of steel I-beams. The playing console of the carillon is at the level of the balconies immediately below the clock faces. Lower levels of the tower house a water tank (no longer used), two practice carillons, the old chimes playing console, office space for the Yale University Guild of Carillonneurs, and a memorial chapel.

===Materials===
The tower was built of separate stone blocks, and reinforced with steel in 1966 to handle the new bells in the carillon.
Yale tour guides frequently mention the legend that the tower was the world&#x27;s tallest free-standing stone structure until it required reinforcement after an eccentric architect or philanthropist ordered acid to be poured down the walls to make it look older. In reality, the Washington Monument was the country&#x27;s tallest such structure long before Harkness Tower was built.

===Ornamentation===
The tower&#x27;s decorative elements were sculpted by Lee Lawrie. The lowest level of sculpture depicts Yale&#x27;s &quot;Eight Worthies&quot;: Elihu Yale, Jonathan Edwards, Nathan Hale, Noah Webster, James Fenimore Cooper, John C. Calhoun, Samuel F. B. Morse, and Eli Whitney. The second level of sculpture depicts Phidias, Homer, Aristotle, and Euclid. The next level of sculpture consists of allegorical figures depicting Medicine, Business, Law, the Church, Courage and Effort, War and Peace, Generosity and Order, Justice and Truth, Life and Progress, and Death and Freedom. The gargoyles on the top level depict Yale&#x27;s students at war and in study (a pen-wielding writer, a proficient athlete, a tea-drinking socialite, and a diligent scholar), along with masks of Homer, Virgil, Dante, and Shakespeare.

==Reception==

The witticism, attributed to various modernist architects, that had they to choose any place in New Haven to live s/he would select the Harkness Tower, for then they &quot;would not have to look at it,&quot; is apparently apocryphal, derivative of a similar story told of Guy de Maupassant and the Eiffel Tower.

==Carillon==
The tower contains the Yale Memorial Carillon, a 54-bell carillon. It is a transposing instrument; the C bell sounds a concert B. Ten bells were installed in 1922 and 44 added in 1966. The instrument is played by members of a student-run group set up for the purpose, the Yale Guild of Carillonneurs, and selected guest carillonneurs. During the school year, the instrument is played twice per day: a half-hour session at 12:30 p.m. and a one-hour session at 5:30 p.m. (Some residents of Branford College and Saybrook College, of which the tower forms a part of the periphery, have been known to refer to the daily performances as &quot;Heavy Metal.&quot;) In summer it is played only in the evening, plus a summer series of Friday concerts. Carillon play was suspended in 2009 and 2010 during the tower&#x27;s renovation.

<text>The Yale Memorial Carillon (sometimes incorrectly referred to as the &quot;Harkness Carillon&quot;) is a carillon of 54 bells in Harkness Tower at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.

This carillon is a transposing instrument pitched in B. Its 54 bells are chromatically arranged from G (1.5 octaves below middle-C) to C (3 octaves above middle-C) for a total of 4.5 octaves. The lowest bell is an F♯ concert pitch, and weighs 13,400 pounds. Each bell is engraved with the year it was cast, the seal of the foundry, the seal of Yale, and the motto &quot;For God, For Country, and For Yale.&quot;

==Origin==

Harkness Tower, the Memorial Quadrangle that surrounds it, and the Harkness Memorial Chime were all part of a gift to Yale made by Anna M. Harkness in memory of her son, Charles William Harkness. Its original 10 bells (an instrument with a range of less than two octaves is referred to as a chime - the &quot;Harkness Memorial Chime&quot; - rather than a carillon) were cast by the John Taylor Bellfounders of Loughborough, England, in 1921. They were installed in Harkness Tower in 1922 and were first rung by John Taylor on June 9, 1922. The chimes were rung regularly by the university organist, Samuel H. Smith, until 1946 when this duty was assumed by a student, Elliot H. Kone &#x27;49. On his graduation in 1949, Kone formed a student organization, the &quot;Guild of Yale Bellringers,&quot; to continue with four rings per day.

==Expansion==

In 1966, the instrument was expanded by the installation of an additional 44 bells, made possible by a gift from Florence S. Marcy Crofut and also cast by the John Taylor Bellfounders. The original chime had 10 pitches, which were named in concert pitch (F♯-G-A-B-C-C♯-D-E-F♯-G); the expansion kept the same bell as bourdon, but the notes were renamed to make the bourdon a G (it is common practice to make carillons transposing instruments so that composers can assume a standard range). The new fully chromatic 4.5 octave carillon was named the &quot;Yale Memorial Carillon&quot; to avoid showing preference to either the Harkness or the Crofut gift. At this point the Guild renamed itself the Yale University Guild of Carillonneurs.

Before the additional bells arrived, a practice carillon was installed in the tower to allow Guild members to learn the new instrument ahead of time. The practice carillon has a keyboard and pedalboard identical to those of the carillon, but the keys strike small tone bars instead of full-sized bells. The practice carillon allows Guild members to practice at a volume comparable to that of most other instruments instead of at the full volume of the carillon, which can be heard for several blocks. A second practice carillon was installed in April, 2006, adding greater flexibility to practicing schedules.

Yale tour guides like to perpetuate the myth that Harkness Tower was once the tallest free-standing stone structure in the world, but needed to be reinforced because an eccentric architect poured acid down the walls to make the tower look older. However, the Washington Monument has been the tallest free-standing stone structure in the United States since it was completed, long before Harkness Tower was built. Furthermore, it was the weight of the additional bells in 1966 that necessitated the reinforcement of the tower with a steel frame structure to carry the additional weight.

== Current use ==

The instrument is currently rung by members of the Yale University Guild of Carillonneurs twice a day when classes are in session, and in the evening during the summer. The Guild is a group of approximately twenty undergraduate and graduate students. From September to May, rings occur at 12:30 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. During the summer, the Guild hosts a concert series of guest carillonneurs on Friday evenings. Free tours are led by students throughout the year and can be arranged using the Guild&#x27;s website.

Every fall semester, all students from Yale College and the Yale Graduate Schools are invited to learn to play the carillon and can audition for a place in the Yale University Guild of Carillonneurs. These students undergo an intensive five-week training program led by experienced members of the guild concluding with an audition. The most skilled students are admitted to the group, and perform regularly on the carillon.

<text>Martin Yan (; born 22 December 1948) is a Chinese-American chef and food writer. He has hosted his award-winning PBS-TV cooking show &quot;Yan Can Cook&quot; since 1982.

== Early years and education ==
With ancestral roots in Hoiping, Yan was born in Guangzhou, Guangdong, China to a restaurateur father and a grocer mother. Yan began to cook at the age of 12. When he was 13, he moved to Hong Kong, where he attended the Munsang College in Kowloon City. During this time in Munsang College, he worked at his uncle&#x27;s Chinese restaurant and learned the traditional method of Chinese barbecue. He received a diploma from the Overseas Institute of Cookery of Hong Kong and later left for Canada for continued study. Ten years after his arrival in North America, Yan received a Master of Science degree in food science from University of California, Davis, in 1975.

He is not related to Chinese-Canadian chef Stephen Yan of &quot;Wok With Yan&quot;, though for a year in the 1970s, Martin Yan worked for Stephen Yan who trained him as one of Stephen Yan&#x27;s &#x27;Flying Squad&#x27; of six chefs who flew across Canada to do demonstrations in Chinese cooking for events like the Calgary Stampede, the Klondike Days in Edmonton and houseware demonstrations at Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company stores.

==Career==
Yan began teaching Chinese cooking for a college extension program. While in Calgary helping a friend open a restaurant he appeared on a talk show on CFAC-TV, (now CICT-DT), to do a cooking segment resulting in his being asked back repeatedly. This led to 250 daily editions of his original series &quot;Yan Can&quot; being produced and syndicated from CFAC for four years until moving to KQED in San Francisco in 1982 becoming &quot;Yan Can Cook&quot;.

He has hosted over 3,500 episodes of the PBS cooking show &quot;Yan Can Cook&quot; since 1982. His shows have been broadcast in over 50 countries. He currently hosts &quot;Martin Yan – Quick &amp; Easy&quot;. He also hosts &quot;Martin Yan&#x27;s Chinatowns&quot;, where he tours Chinatowns around the globe as well as &quot;Martin Yan&#x27;s Hidden China.&quot;

Yan has opened a chain of Yan Can Restaurants and founded the Yan Can International Cooking School in San Francisco. He has written over two dozen cookbooks. The American Culinary Federation has designated him a Master Chef.

Yan is one of the lead actors of the Singapore/Hong Kong film &quot;Rice Rhapsody&quot; (海南雞飯, 2005).

In 2007, he supported and endorsed the establishment of the World Association of Master Chefs.

He has appeared as a guest judge on several episodes of &quot;Iron Chef America&quot; and appeared on the cartoon talk show &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;. He also appeared as a guest judge on the Season 10 finale of &quot;Top Chef&quot; as well as a Season 11 episode of &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;.

He is not related to Chinese Canadian chef Stephen Yan of the CBC Television series &quot;Wok with Yan&quot;, though Martin was an employee and had worked for Stephen Yan in the 1980s as demonstrator for Stephen&#x27;s products.

In 2023, Yan said that he planned on reopening his M.Y. China restaurant in San Francisco. He said that he had considering reopening the restaurant in the former home of Cathay House restaurant (which was closed in 2018).

<doc id="343538" wikidata="Q1947304" url="?curid=343538" title="Cushing's disease">
<text>Cushing&#x27;s disease is one cause of Cushing&#x27;s syndrome characterised by increased secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary (secondary hypercortisolism). This is most often as a result of a pituitary adenoma (specifically pituitary basophilism) or due to excess production of hypothalamus CRH (corticotropin releasing hormone) (tertiary hypercortisolism/hypercorticism) that stimulates the synthesis of cortisol by the adrenal glands. Pituitary adenomas are responsible for 80% of endogenous Cushing&#x27;s syndrome, when excluding Cushing&#x27;s syndrome from exogenously administered corticosteroids. The equine version of this disease is Pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction.

This should not be confused with ectopic Cushing syndrome or exogenous steroid use.

== Signs and symptoms ==
The symptoms of Cushing&#x27;s disease are similar to those seen in other causes of Cushing&#x27;s syndrome. Patients with Cushing&#x27;s disease usually present with one or more signs and symptoms secondary to the presence of excess cortisol or ACTH. Although uncommon, some patients with Cushing&#x27;s disease have large pituitary tumors (macroadenomas). In addition to the severe hormonal effects related to increased blood cortisol levels, the large tumor can compress adjacent structures. These tumors can compress the nerves that carry information from the eyes, causing a decrease in peripheral vision. Glaucoma and cataracts also may occur in Cushing&#x27;s syndrome. In children, the two main symptoms are obesity and decreased linear growth.

The clinical diagnosis must be based on the presence of one or more of the symptoms listed below because the syndrome itself has no true pathognomonic signs or symptoms.
The most common symptoms seen in male patients are purple striae, muscle atrophy, osteoporosis, and kidney stones.

=== Common ===
Common signs and symptoms of Cushing&#x27;s disease include the following:
* weight gain
* high blood pressure
* poor short-term memory
* irritability
* excess hair growth (women)
* Impaired immunological function
* red, ruddy face
* extra fat around neck, &quot;Buffalo Hump&quot;
* moon face
* fatigue
* red stretch marks
* poor concentration
* irregular menstruation
=== Less common ===
The less-common signs and symptoms of Cushing&#x27;s disease include the following:
* insomnia
* recurrent infection
* thin skin and stretch marks
* easy bruising
* weak bones
* acne
* balding (women)
* depression
* hip and shoulder weakness
* swelling of feet/legs
* diabetes mellitus
* erectile dysfunction
== Diagnosis ==
Diagnosis is made first by diagnosing Cushing&#x27;s syndrome (hypercortisolism), which can be difficult to do clinically since the most characteristic symptoms only occur in a minority of patients. Some of the biochemical diagnostic tests used include salivary and blood serum cortisol testing, 24-hour urinary free cortisol (UFC) testing, the dexamethasone suppression test (DST). No single test is perfect and multiple tests should always be used to achieve a proper diagnosis. Diagnosing Cushing&#x27;s disease is a multidisciplinary process involving doctors, endocrinologists, radiologists, surgeons, and chemical pathologists. Often, it is hard to differentiate true Cushing&#x27;s from pseudo-Cushing&#x27;s (non-neoplastic hypercortisolism).

=== ACTH blood test ===
Once Cushing&#x27;s syndrome has been diagnosed, the first step towards finding the cause is measuring plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) concentration. A concentration consistently below 1.1 pmol/L is classified as corticotropin-independent and does not lead to a diagnosis of Cushing&#x27;s disease. In such cases, the next step is adrenal imaging with CT.
If plasma corticotropin concentrations are consistently above 3.3 pmol/L, then corticotropin-dependent Cushing&#x27;s syndrome is most likely. Any intermediate values need to be cautiously interpreted and a corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) test is advised in order to confirm corticotropin dependency. If corticotropin-dependent Cushing&#x27;s syndrome is determined then the next step is to distinguish between Cushing&#x27;s disease and ectopic corticotropin syndrome. This is done via a combination of techniques including CRH, high-dose DST, pituitary MRI and bilateral inferior petrosal sinus sampling (IPSS).

=== Dexamethasone suppression test ===
Two dexamethasone suppression tests (DSTs) are generally used, the overnight test and the 48 hour test. For both tests, a plasma cortisol level above 50 nmol/L is indicative of Cushing&#x27;s disease. However, 3–8% of patients with Cushing&#x27;s disease will test negative due to a retention of dexamethasone suppression abilities. For non-Cushing or healthy patients, the false-positive rate is 30%. The 48-h DST is advantageous since it is more specific and can be done by outpatients upon proper instruction. In the high-dose 48-h DST, 2 mg of dexamethasone is given every 6 hours for 48 hours or a single dose of 8 mg is given. This test is not needed if the 48-h low-dose DST has shown suppression of cortisol by over 30%. These tests are based on the glucocorticoid sensitivity of pituitary adenomas compared to non-pituitary tumors.

=== ACTH stimulation test ===
An ACTH stimulation test involving administration of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) or another agent can differentiate this condition from ectopic ACTH secretion. In a patient with Cushing&#x27;s disease, the tumor cells will be stimulated to release corticotropin and elevated plasma corticotropin levels will be detected. This rarely occurs with ectopic corticotropin syndrome and thus is quite useful for distinguishing between the two conditions. If ectopic, the plasma ACTH and cortisol levels should remain unchanged; if this is pituitary related, levels of both would rise. The CRH test uses recombinant human or bovine-sequence CRH, which is administered via a 100μg intravenous bolus dose. The sensitivity of the CRH test for detecting Cushing&#x27;s disease is 93% when plasma levels are measured after fifteen and thirty minutes. However, this test is used only as a last resort due to its high cost and complexity.

=== Imaging ===
A CT or MRI of the pituitary may also show the ACTH-secreting tumor if present. However, in 40% of Cushing&#x27;s disease patients MRI is unable to detect a tumor. In one study of 261 patients with confirmed pituitary Cushing&#x27;s disease, only 48% of pituitary lesions were identified using MRI prior to surgery. The average size of tumor, both those that were identified on MRI and those that were only discovered during surgery, was 6 mm.

=== Inferior petrosal sinus sampling ===
IPSS (inferior petrosal sinus sampling) or BIPSS (bilateral IPSS) is a more accurate but invasive test used to differentiate pituitary from ectopic or adrenal Cushing&#x27;s syndrome. A corticotropin gradient sample via BIPSS is required to confirm diagnosis when pituitary MRI imaging and biochemical diagnostic tests have been inconclusive. A basal central:peripheral ratio of over 2:1, or a ratio over 3:1 when CRH is administered, is indicative of Cushing&#x27;s disease. This test has been the gold standard for distinguishing between Cushing&#x27;s disease and ectopic corticotropin syndrome, with a sensitivity and specificity of 94% for Cushing&#x27;s disease, and a very low rate of complications.

=== Urinary free cortisol test ===
Another diagnostic test used is the urinary free cortisol (UFC) test, which measures the excess cortisol excreted by the kidneys into the urine. Results of 4x higher cortisol levels than normal are likely to be Cushing&#x27;s disease. This test should be repeated three times in order to exclude any normally occurring periods of hypercortisolism. The UFC test has a specificity of 81% and thus has a high rate of false-positives that are due to pseudo-Cushing states, sleep apnea, polycystic ovary syndrome, familial glucocorticoid resistance, and hyperthyroidism.

=== Late night (midnight) salivary cortisol test ===
The late-night or midnight salivary cortisol test has been gaining support due to its ease of collection and stability at room temperature, therefore it can be assigned to outpatients. The test measures free circulating cortisol and have both a sensitivity and specificity of 95–98%. This test is especially useful for diagnosing children.

== Treatment ==
The first-line treatment of Cushing&#x27;s disease is surgical resection of ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma; this surgery involves removal of the tumor via transsphenoidal surgery (TSS).
There are two possible options for access to the sphenoidal sinus, including of endonasal approach (through the nostril) or sublabial approach (through an incision under the upper lip); many factors such as the size of nostril, the size of the lesion, and the preferences of the surgeon cause the selection of one access route over the other. Some tumors do not contain a discrete border between the tumor and pituitary gland; therefore, careful sectioning through the pituitary gland may be required to identify the location of the tumor. The probability of successful resection is higher in patients where the tumor was identified at initial surgery in comparison to patients where no tumor was found initially; the overall remission rates in patients with microadenomas undergoing TSS are in range of 65%–90%, and the remission rate in patients with macroadenomas are lower than 65%. Patients with persistent disease after initial surgery are treated with repeated pituitary surgery as soon as the active persistent disease is evident; however, reoperation has a lower success rate and increases the risk of pituitary insufficiency.

Pituitary radiation therapy is another option for treatment of postoperative persisting hypercortisolemia following unsuccessful transsphenoidal surgery. External-beam pituitary RT is more effective treatment for pediatric CD in children with cure rates of 80–88%. Hypopituitarism specifically growth hormone deficiency has been reported as the only most common late morbidity of this treatment; GHD has been reported in 36% and 68% of the patients undergoing post-pituitary RT for Cushing&#x27;s disease.

Bilateral adrenalectomy is another treatment that provides immediate reduction of cortisol level and control of hypercortisolism. However, it requires education of patients, because lifelong glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement therapy is needed for these patients. One of the major complications of this treatment is progression of Nelson&#x27;s syndrome which is caused by enhance level of tumor growth and ACTH secretion post adrenalectomy in 8–29% of patients with CD.

During post-surgical recovery, patients collect a 24-hour urine sample and blood sample for detecting the level of cortisol with the purpose of cure test; level of cortisol near the detection limit assay corresponds to cure. Hormonal replacement such as steroid is given to patients because of steroid withdrawal. After the completion of collecting urine and blood samples, patients are asked to switch to glucocorticoid such as prednisone to decrease symptoms associated with adrenal withdrawal. Mitotane is also used

A study of 3,525 cases of TSS for Cushing&#x27;s disease in the nationally representative sample of US hospitals between 1993 and 2002 was conducted and revealed the following results: the in-hospital mortality rate was 0.7%; the complication rate was 42.1%. Diabetes insipidus (15%), fluid and electrolyte abnormalities (12.5%), and neurological deficits (5.6%) were the most common complications reported. The analyses of the study show that complications were more likely in patients with pre-operative comorbidities. Patients older than 64 years were more likely to have an adverse outcome and prolonged hospital stay. Women were 0.3 times less likely to have adverse outcomes in comparison to men.

== Epidemiology ==
Cases of Cushing&#x27;s disease are rare, and little epidemiological data is available on the disease. An 18-year study conducted on the population of Vizcaya, Spain reported a 0.004% prevalence of Cushing&#x27;s disease. The average incidence of newly diagnosed cases was 2.4 cases per million inhabitants per year. The disease is often diagnosed 3–6 years after the onset of illness. Several studies have shown that Cushing&#x27;s disease is more prevalent in women than men at a ratio of 3–6:1, respectively. Moreover, most women affected were between the ages of 50 and 60 years. The prevalence of hypertension, and abnormalities in glucose metabolism are major predictors of mortality and morbidity in untreated cases of the disease. The mortality rate of Cushing&#x27;s disease was reported to be 10–11%, with the majority of deaths due to vascular disease. Women aged 45–70 years have a significantly higher mortality rate than men. Moreover, the disease shows a progressive increase with time. Reasons for the trend are unknown, but better diagnostic tools and a higher incidence rate are two possible explanations.

== History ==
The disease associated with this increased secretion of cortisol was described by the American neurosurgeon Harvey Cushing in 1912 after he was presented with a unique case of the disease in 1910 a 23-year-old woman called Minnie G. whose symptoms included painful obesity, amenorrhea, hypertrichosis (abnormal hair growth), underdevelopment of secondary sexual characteristics, hydrocephalus and cerebral tension. This combination of symptoms was not yet described by any medical disorder at the time. However, Cushing was confident that Minnie&#x27;s symptoms were due to dysfunction of the pituitary gland and resembled those associated with an adrenal tumor. Given this conviction, and his knowledge of the three anterior pituitary cell types, Cushing hypothesized that if acidophil hyperpituitarism (excess secretion from the acidophil cells) caused acromegaly, then an excess of basophil cells must be involved in another pituitary disorder that involves sexual dysfunction (amenorrhea in females and erectile dysfunction in males) and could explain Minnie&#x27;s symptoms. Experimental evidence and case reports by Cushing led to his publication in 1932 on pituitary basophilism as the cause of Cushing&#x27;s disease. In this publication, the clinical symptoms of the disease, named after Cushing, were described. Out of the 12 cases with hypercortisolism described in Cushing&#x27;s monograph on the pituitary body, 67% died within a few years after symptom presentation, whereas Minnie G. survived for more than 40 years after symptom presentation, despite the fact that she did not receive any treatments for a pituitary tumor. The prolonged survival made Minnie&#x27;s case unique at the time. The reason behind this survival remains a mystery since an autopsy of Minnie was refused after her death. However, the most likely explanation, proposed by J. Aidan Carney and based on statistical evidence, was that the basophil adenoma Minnie might have harbored underwent partial infarction, leading to symptom regression. The other hypothesis was that Minnie might have had Primary Pigmented Nodular Adrenocortical Disease (PPNAD), which when associated with Cushing&#x27;s syndrome (Carney complex) can infrequently cause spontaneous symptom regression of the latter.

In 1924, the Soviet neurologist Nikolai Itsenko reported two patients with pituitary adenoma. The resulting excessive adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion led to the production of large amounts of cortisol by the adrenal glands. Considering this impact, the name of Itsenko was added to the title in some East European and Asian countries, and the disease is called Itsenko-Kushing disease.

<doc id="343540" wikidata="Q7293" url="?curid=343540" title="Emperor Zhi of Han">
<text>Emperor Zhi of Han (; 138 – 26 July 146) was an emperor of the Chinese Han dynasty. He was a great-great-grandson of Emperor Zhang. His reign was dominated by Liang Ji, the brother of Empress Dowager Liang, who eventually poisoned the young emperor. He was the 10th emperor of the Eastern Han dynasty.

Emperor Zhi ascended the throne when he was seven when his third cousin, two-year-old Emperor Chong died, and although he was still a child, Emperor Zhi was remarkably intelligent and he knew and was offended by the immense power Liang Ji had over the government—leading to him once commenting that Liang Ji was &quot;an arrogant general.&quot; This act of defiance angered Liang Ji, who proceeded to poison the emperor. Emperor Zhi was only eight when he died.

== Family background and accession to the throne ==
Liu Zuan, the future Emperor Zhi was born to Liu Hong (), the Prince of Le&#x27;an, and his wife Consort Chen, in 138. (Eventually, after his son became emperor, Prince Hong would be moved from his very humid and small principality of Le&#x27;an to the larger and drier principality of Bohai.) Prince Hong was a great-grandson of Emperor Zhang. Other than these facts, virtually nothing else is known about Prince Hong or his wife.

In February 145, when the two-year-old Emperor Chong died, he had no close male relative to inherit his throne. His stepmother Empress Dowager Liang (the wife of Emperor Shun) therefore summoned two of his third cousins—Liu Suan (), the Prince of Qinghe, and Liu Zuan, then seven-years-old, to the capital, to examine them as potential heir to the throne. (Prince Suan and Zuan were first cousins of each other, through their grandfather Liu Chong (), Prince Yi of Le&#x27;an.) Liu Suan was apparently an adult (although history did not record his age) and was described as solemn and proper, and the officials largely favored him. However, Empress Dowager Liang&#x27;s autocratic and violent brother Liang Ji wanted a younger emperor so that he could remain in absolute control longer, and he persuaded Empress Dowager Liang to make the seven-year-old Zuan as emperor. To avoid having a person without an official title becoming emperor directly, he was first created the Marquess of Jianping, and then the same day he ascended the throne as Emperor Zhi.

== Brief reign ==
Empress Dowager Liang served as Emperor Zhi&#x27;s regent, and while she overly trusted her brother Liang Ji, who was violent and corrupt, she herself was diligent and interested in governing the country well—in particular, entrusting much of the important matters to the honest official Li Gu (, who was Grand Commandant). For example, the agrarian rebellions that started during Emperors Shun and Chong&#x27;s reigns were largely quelled in 145, after she selected the right generals to lead the armies. She also encouraged the young scholars from over the empire to come to the capital Luoyang to study at the national university.

Emperor Zhi, as young as he was, was keenly aware of how much Liang Ji was abusing power (but befitting of a young child, not aware of how Liang Ji also had the power to do him harm), and on one occasion, at an imperial gathering, he blinked at Liang Ji and referred to him as &quot;an arrogant general.&quot; Liang Ji became angry and concerned. In the summer of 146, he had his underlings poison a bowl of pastry soup and had it given to the emperor. After the young emperor consumed the soup, he quickly suffered great pain, and he summoned Li immediately and also requested for water, believing that water would save him. However, Liang, who was by the emperor&#x27;s side, immediately ordered that the emperor not be given any water, and the young emperor immediately died. Li advocated a full investigation, but Liang was able to have the investigation efforts suppressed.

After Emperor Zhi&#x27;s death, Liang Ji, under pressure by the key officials, was forced to summon a meeting of the officials to decide whom to enthrone as the new emperor. The officials were again largely in favor of Prince Suan, but Liang Ji was still concerned about how he would be difficult to control. Rather, he persuaded Empress Dowager Liang to make the 14-year-old Liu Zhi (), the Marquess of Liwu, a great-grandson of Emperor Zhang, to whom Liang Ji&#x27;s younger sister Liang Nüying () was betrothed, emperor (as Emperor Huan).

Long after Emperor Zhi&#x27;s death, in November 175, Emperor Ling bestowed on Emperor Zhi&#x27;s mother Lady Chen the honorific title of Princess Xiao of Bohai, in recognition of her status as mother of an emperor.

<doc id="343550" wikidata="Q647300" url="?curid=343550" title="Cough/Cool">
<text>&quot;Cough/Cool&quot; is the first single released by the horror punk band the Misfits. It was released in August 1977 on singer Glenn Danzig&#x27;s label Blank Records. 500 copies were produced on black 7&quot; vinyl. Both songs from the single were re-recorded and re-released in various versions over the following twenty years.

==Background==
The Misfits had formed in February 1977 in Lodi, New Jersey, with a lineup including Danzig (who also played electric piano), bassist Jerry Only, and drummer Manny Martínez. the band was without a guitar player for six months. Danzig therefore used his electric piano to fill out the rhythm on the two songs &quot;Cough/Cool&quot; and &quot;She&quot;, which were recorded in June 1977 at the Rainbow Studio and mastered at Spectrum Sound in Brooklyn, New York, by Rich Flores. By the time of the single&#x27;s release in August 1977 the band had added First guitarist Franché Coma and Danzig phased out the piano in favor of singing exclusively.

Caiafa&#x27;s surname was misspelled on the single&#x27;s sleeve as &quot;Caifa&quot;, leading him to insist that from then on he be credited as &quot;Jerry, only Jerry&quot;. &quot;Jerry Only&quot; soon became his pseudonym, which he has continued to use throughout the rest of his career.

The subject of the song &quot;She&quot; is not mentioned in the lyrics, but Misfits associate Eerie Von noted in The Misfits box set in 1996 that the song was about Patty Hearst. The lyrics reference Hearst&#x27;s participation in a San Francisco bank robbery in 1974: &quot;She walked out with empty arms, machine gun in her hand/She is good and she is bad, no one understands/She walked in in silence, never spoke a word/She&#x27;s got a rich daddy, she&#x27;s her daddy&#x27;s girl&quot;.

==Re-releases and other versions==
&quot;Cough/Cool&quot; and &quot;She&quot; were re-recorded and re-released in several versions in subsequent years. &quot;She&quot; was re-recorded in January 1978, with guitar in place of the electric piano, for the &quot;Static Age&quot; album. The album was not released in its intended form for 20 years, though many of its songs saw release in various versions over the years. &quot;She&quot; had been one of three songs from the sessions that were never mixed, however, and so this version was not released until 1997, when &quot;Static Age&quot; was finally issued in its entirety. A third version of &quot;She&quot; was released in 1985 on the compilation album &quot;Legacy of Brutality&quot;, with overdubbed guitar and bass tracks by Danzig. This version was reissued on &quot;Misfits&quot; the following year. A new version of &quot;Cough/Cool&quot; appeared on &quot;Collection II&quot; in 1995; this version was recorded in 1987 by Danzig and former Misfits photographer &quot;Eerie Von &quot;. Danzig used the drum track from the original recording, but Danzig overdubbed guitar and drum machine tracks and new vocals. The original mixes of both &quot;Cough/Cool&quot; and &quot;She&quot;, from the original single, were included in The Misfits box set (1996) along with the alternative versions from &quot;Legacy of Brutality&quot; and &quot;Collection II&quot;.

==Cover versions==
&quot;Cough/Cool&quot; has been covered by English rock band The Wytches on their album Home Recordings, and by Washington DC rock band Adam West on their first fan club 7&quot; single in 1993. Cover versions of &quot;She&quot; have appeared on two Misfits tribute albums, though these are based on later versions of the song that have guitar rather than electric piano. Snapcase covered the song for &quot;Violent World: A Tribute to the Misfits&quot; (1997), while the Demons covered it for &quot;Hell on Earth: A Tribute to the Misfits&quot; (2000). The Murder City Devils also covered the song for the compilation album &quot;Free the West Memphis 3&quot; (2000) and the re-issue of their album &quot;In Name and Blood&quot;.

==Collector&#x27;s value==
Like other early Misfits recordings, original pressings of this single are highly collectible. In 2021, one copy of it sold for over $10,000.00.

<doc id="343552" wikidata="Q84483575" url="?curid=343552" title="Phthalates">
<text>Phthalates ( ), or phthalate esters, are esters of phthalic acid. They are mainly used as plasticizers, i.e., substances added to plastics to increase their flexibility, transparency, durability, and longevity. They are used primarily to soften polyvinyl chloride (PVC). While phthalates are commonly used as plasticizers, not all plasticizers are phthalates. The two terms are specific, unique, and not used interchangeably.

Lower-molecular-weight phthalates are typically replaced in many products in the United States, Canada, and European Union over health concerns. They are being replaced by higher molecular-weight phthalates as well as non-phthalic plasticizers.

Phthalates are commonly ingested in small quantities via the diet. There are numerous forms of phthalates not regulated by governments. One of the most commonly known phtalates is bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP). In many countries, DEHP is regulated as a toxin, and is banned from use in broad categories of consumer goods, such as cosmetics, children&#x27;s toys, medical devices, and food packaging.

==Production==
Phthalate esters are produced industrially by the reaction of phthalic anhydride with excess alcohol. Often the phthalic anhydride is molten. The monoesterification occurs readily, but the second step is slow:
:

The conversion is conducted at high temperatures to drive off the water. Typical catalysts are based on tin or titanium alkoxides or carboxylates.

The properties of the phthalate can be varied by changing the alcohol. Around 30 are, or have been, commercially important. Phthalates&#x27; share of the global plasticisers market has been decreasing since around 2000 however total production has been increasing, with around 5.5 million tonnes made in 2015, up from around 2.7 million tonnes in the 1980s. The explanation for this is the increasing size of the plasticiser market, largely due driven by increases in PVC production, which nearly doubled between 2000 and 2020. The People&#x27;s Republic of China is the largest consumer, accounting for around 45% of all use. Europe and the United States together account for around 25% of use, with the remainder widely spread around the world.

==Uses==
===PVC plasticisers===
Between 90 and 95% of all phthalates are used as plasticisers for the production of flexible PVC. They were the first commercially important compounds for this role, a historic advantage that has led to them becoming firmly embedded in flexible PVC technology. Among the common plastics, PVC is unique in its acceptance of large amounts of plasticizer with gradual changes in physical properties from a rigid solid to a soft gel. Phthalates derived from alcohols with 7-13 carbon atoms occupy a privileged position as general purpose plasticizers, suitable for almost all flexible PVC applications. Phthalates larger than this have limited compatibility in PVC, with di(isotridecyl) phthalate representing the practical upper limit. Conversely, plasticizers derived from alcohols with 4-6 carbon atoms are too volatile to be used on their own, but have been used alongside other compounds as secondary plasticizers, where they improve low-temperature flexibility. Compounds derived from alcohols with 1-3 carbon atoms are not used as plasticizers in PVC at all, due excessive fuming at processing temperatures (typically 180-210 °C).

Historically DINP, DEHP, BBP, DBP, and DIHP have been the most important phthalates, however many of these are now facing regulatory pressure and gradual phase-outs. Almost all phthalates derived from alcohols with between 3 and 8 carbons are classed as toxic by ECHA. This includes Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP or DOP), which has long been the most widely used phthalate, with commercial production dating back to the 1930s. In the EU, the use of DEHP is restricted under REACH and it can only be used in specific cases if an authorisation has been granted; similar restrictions exist in many other jurisdictions. Despite this, the phase-out of DEHP is slow and it was still the most frequently used plasticizer in 2018, with an estimated global production of 3.24 million tonnes. DINP and DIDP are used as a substitutes for DEHP in many applications, as they are not classified as hazardous. Non-phthalate plasticizers are also being increasingly used.

Almost 90% of all plasticizers are used in PVC, giving this material improved flexibility and durability. The majority is used in films and cable sheathing. Flexible PVC can consist of over 85% plasticizer by mass, however unplasticized PVC (UPVC) should not contain any.

===Non-PVC plasticisers===
Phthalates see use as plasticisers in various other polymers, with applications centred around coatings such as lacquers, varnishes, and paints. The addition of phthalates imparts some flexibility to these materials, reducing their tendency to chip.
Phthalates derived from alcohols with between 1-4 carbon atoms are used as plasticisers for cellulose-type plastics, such as cellulose acetate, nitrocellulose and cellulose acetate butyrate, with commonly encountered applications including nail polish. Most phthalates are also compatible with alkyds and acrylic resins, which are used in both oil and emulsion based paints.

Other plasticised polymer systems include polyvinyl butyral (particularly the forms used to make laminated glass), PVA and its co-polymers like PVCA. They are also compatible in nylon, polystyrene, polyurethanes, and certain rubbers; but their use in these is very limited.

Phthalates can plasticise ethyl cellulose, polyvinyl acetate phthalate (PVAP) and cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP), all of which are used to make enteric coatings for tablet and capsule medications. These coatings protect drugs from the acidity of the stomach, but allow their release and absorption in the intestines.

===Solvent and phlegmatizer===
Phthalate esters are widely used as solvents for highly reactive organic peroxides. Thousands of tonnes are consumed annually for this purpose. The great advantage offered by these esters is that they are phlegmatizers, i.e. they minimize the explosive tendencies of a family of chemical compounds that otherwise are potentially dangerous to handle. Phthalates have also been used for producing plastic explosives such as Semtex.

===Other uses===
Relatively minor amounts of some phthalates find use in personal-care items such as eye shadow, moisturizer, nail polish, liquid soap, and hair spray. Low-molecular-weight phthalates like dimethyl phthalate and diethyl phthalate are used as fixatives for perfumes. Dimethyl phthalate has been also used as an insect repellent and is especially useful against ixodid ticks responsible for Lyme disease. and species of mosquitoes such as &quot;Anopheles stephensi, Culex pipiens and Aedes aegypti&quot;,

Diallyl phthalate is used to prepare vinyl ester resins with good electrical insulation properties. These resins are used to manufacture of electronics components.

==History==
The development of cellulose nitrate plastic in 1846 led to the patent of castor oil in 1856 for use as the first plasticizer. In 1870, camphor became the more favored plasticizer for cellulose nitrate. Phthalates were first introduced in the 1920s and quickly replaced the volatile and odorous camphor. In 1931, the commercial availability of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and the development of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) began the boom of the plasticizer PVC industry.

==Properties==
Phthalate esters usually refers to dialkyl esters of phthalic acid (also called 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid, not be confused with the structurally isomeric terephthalic or isophthalic acids); the name &quot;phthalate&quot; derives from phthalic acid, which itself is derived from the word &quot;naphthalene&quot;. When added to plastics, phthalates allow the polyvinyl polymers to slide against one another. The phthalates have a clear syrupy liquid consistency and show low water solubility, high oil solubility, and low volatility. The polar carboxyl group contributes little to the physical properties of the phthalates, except when R and R&#x27; are very small (such as ethyl or methyl groups). Phthalates are colorless, odorless liquids produced by the reaction of phthalic anhydride with alcohols.

The mechanism by which phthalates and related compounds plasticize polar polymers has been a subject of intense study since the 1960s. The mechanism is one of polar interactions between the polar centres of the phthalate molecule (the C=O functionality) and the positively charged areas of the vinyl chain, typically residing on the carbon atom of the carbon-chlorine bond. For this to be established, the polymer must be heated in the presence of the plasticizer, first above the Tg of the polymer and then into a melt state. This enables an intimate mix of polymer and plasticizer to be formed, and for these interactions to occur. When cooled, these interactions remain and the network of PVC chains cannot reform (as is present in unplasticized PVC, or PVC-U). The alkyl chains of the phthalate then screen the PVC chains from each other as well. They are blended within the plastic article as a result of the manufacturing process.

Because they are not chemically bonded to the host plastics, phthalates are released from the plastic article by relatively gentle means. For example, they can be extracted by extraction with organic solvents and, to some extent, by handling.

===Alternatives===

Being inexpensive, nontoxic (in an acute sense), colorless, noncorrosive, biodegradable, and with easily tuned physical properties, phthalate esters are nearly ideal plasticizers. Among the numerous alternative plasticizers are dioctyl terephthalate (DEHT) (a terephthalate isomeric with DEHP) and 1,2-cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid diisononyl ester (DINCH) (a hydrogenated version of DINP). Both DEHT and DINCH have been used in high volumes for a variety of products used in contact with humans as alternative plasticizers for DEHP and DINP. Some of these products include medical devices, toys, and food packaging. DEHT and DINCH are more hydrophobic than other phthalate alternatives such as bis(2-ethylhexyl) adipate (DEHA) and diisodecyl adipate (DIDA). Since alternative plasticizers such as DEHT and DINCH are more likely to bind to organic matter and airborne particles indoors, exposure occurs primarily through food consumption and contact with dust.

Many bio-based plasticizers based on vegetable oil have been developed.

==Occurrence and exposure==
===Human exposure===
Due to the ubiquity of plasticized plastics, people are often exposed to phthalates. For example, most Americans tested by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have metabolites of multiple phthalates in their urine. Exposure to phthalates is more likely in women and people of color. Differences were found between Mexican-Americans, blacks, and whites in terms of the overall risk of disturbance of glucose homeostasis. With Mexican-Americans having a fasting blood glucose (FBG) increase of 5.82 mg/dL, blacks having a fasting blood glucose increase of 3.63 mg/dL, and whites having a fasting blood glucose increase of 1.79 mg/dL, there was evidence of an increased risk for minorities. Overall, the study concludes that phthalates may alter glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. Higher levels of some phthalate metabolites were associated with elevated FBG, fasting insulin, and insulin resistance. Non-Hispanic black women and Hispanic women have higher levels of some phthalate metabolites.

Higher dust concentrations of DEHP were found in homes of children with asthma and allergies, compared with healthy children&#x27;s homes. The author of the study stated, &quot;The concentration of DEHP was found to be significantly associated with wheezing in the last 12 months as reported by the parents.&quot; Phthalates were found in almost every sampled home in Bulgaria. The same study found that DEHP, BBzP, and DnOP were in significantly higher concentrations in dust samples collected in homes where polishing agents were used. Data on flooring materials was collected, but there was not a significant difference in concentrations between homes where no polish was used that have balatum (PVC or linoleum) flooring and homes with wood. High frequency of dusting did decrease the concentration.

In general, children&#x27;s exposure to phthalates is greater than that of adults. In a 1990s Canadian study that modeled ambient exposures, it was estimated that daily exposure to DEHP was 9 μg/kg bodyweight/day in infants, 19 μg/kg bodyweight/day in toddlers, 14 μg/kg bodyweight/day in children, and 6 μg/kg bodyweight/day in adults. Infants and toddlers are at the greatest risk of exposure, because of their mouthing behavior. Body-care products containing phthalates are a source of exposure for infants. The authors of a 2008 study &quot;observed that reported use of infant lotion, infant powder, and infant shampoo were associated with increased infant urine concentrations of [phthalate metabolites], and this association is strongest in younger infants. These findings suggest that dermal exposures may contribute significantly to phthalate body burden in this population.&quot; Although they did not examine health outcomes, they noted that &quot;Young infants are more vulnerable to the potential adverse effects of phthalates given their increased dosage per unit body surface area, metabolic capabilities, and developing endocrine and reproductive systems.&quot;

Infants and hospitalized children are particularly susceptible to phthalate exposure. Medical devices and tubing may contain 20–40% Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) by weight, which &quot;easily leach out of tubing when heated (as with warm saline / blood)&quot;. Several medical devices contain phthalates including, but not limited to, IV tubing, gloves, nasogastric tubes, and respiratory tubing. The Food and Drug Administration did an extensive risk assessment of phthalates in the medical setting and found that neonates may be exposed to five times greater than the allowed daily tolerable intake. This finding led to the conclusion by the FDA that, &quot;[c]hildren undergoing certain medical procedures may represent a population at increased risk for the effects of DEHP&quot;.

In 2008, the Danish Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) found a variety of phthalates in erasers and warned of health risks when children regularly suck and chew on them. The European Commission Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER), however, considers that, even in the case when children bite off pieces from erasers and swallow them, it is unlikely that this exposure leads to health consequences.

In 2008, the United States National Research Council recommended that the cumulative effects of phthalates and other antiandrogens be investigated. It criticized U.S. EPA guidances, which stipulate that, when examining cumulative effects, the chemicals examined should have similar mechanisms of action or similar structures, as too restrictive. It recommended instead that the effects of chemicals that cause similar adverse outcomes should be examined cumulatively. Thus, the effect of phthalates should be examined together with other antiandrogens, which otherwise may have been excluded because their mechanisms or structure are different.

====Food====
Phthalates are found in food, especially fast food items. Phthalate DnBP was detected in 81 percent of the samples, while DEHP was found in 70 percent. Diethylhexyl terephthalate (DEHT), the main alternative to DEHP, was detected in 86%. A 2024 study by Consumer Reports found phthalates in all but one of the grocery store products and fast foods they tested.

Diet is believed to be the main source of DEHP and other phthalates in the general population. Fatty foods such as milk, butter, and meats are a major source. Studies show that exposure to phthalates is greater from ingestion of certain foods, rather than exposure via water bottles, as is most often first thought of with plastic chemicals. Low-molecular-weight phthalates such as DEP, DBP, BBzP may be dermally absorbed. Inhalational exposure is also significant with the more volatile phthalates.

One study, conducted between 2003 and 2010 analysing data from 9,000 individuals, found that those who reported that they had eaten at a fast food restaurant had much higher levels of two separate phthalates—DEHP and DiNP—in their urine samples. Even small consumption of fast food caused higher presence of phthalates. &quot;People who reported eating only a little fast food had DEHP levels that were 15.5 percent higher and DiNP levels that were 25 percent higher than those who said they had eaten none. For people who reported eating a sizable amount, the increase was 24 percent and 39 percent, respectively.&quot;

====Air====
Outdoor air concentrations are higher in urban and suburban areas than in rural and remote areas. They also pose no acute toxicity.

Common plasticizers such as DEHP are only weakly volatile. Higher air temperatures result in higher concentrations of phthalates in the air. PVC flooring leads to higher concentrations of BBP and DEHP, which are more prevalent in dust. A 2012 Swedish study of children found that phthalates from PVC flooring were taken up into their bodies, showing that children can ingest phthalates not only from food but also by breathing and through the skin.

===Natural occurrence===
Various plants and microorganisms produce small amounts of phthalate esters, the so-called endogenous phthalates. Biosynthesis is believed to involve a modified Shikimate pathway The extent of this natural production is not fully known, but it may create a background of phthalate pollution.

===Biodegradation===
Phthalates do not persist due to rapid biodegradation, photodegradation, and anaerobic degradation.

==Research==

Phthalates are under research as a class of possible endocrine disruptors, substances that may interfere with normal hormonal responses in varied environmental conditions. The concern has sparked demands to ban or restrict the use of phthalates in baby toys.

A 2024 review indicated that exposure of mothers to environmental phthalates may have adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as a higher miscarriage rate and lower birth weights. Another review showed small reductions in lung function in adolescents and children who had been exposed to phthalates.

A 2017 review indicated ways to avoid exposure to phthalates: (1) eating a balanced diet to avoid ingesting too many endocrine disruptors from a single source, (2) eliminating canned or packaged food in order to limit ingestion of DEHP phthalates leached from plastics, and (3) eliminating use of any personal product such as moisturizer, perfume, or cosmetics that contain phthalates. Exposure to phthalates may increase the risk of asthma.

A 2018 study indicated that exposure to phthalates during developmental stages in childhood may negatively affect adipose tissue function and metabolic homeostasis, possibly increasing the risk of obesity.

==Legal status==
The governments of Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the US, and California have determined that many phthalates are not harmful to human health or the environment in amounts typically found, and therefore are legally unregulated. The focus for regulation in these jurisdictions has been mainly on diethyl phthalate (DEHP), which is generally regarded as a carcinogenic toxin requiring regulation.

The European Chemicals Agency (European Union, EU) regards ortho-phthalates, such as DEHP, dibutyl phthalate, diisobutyl phthalate, and benzyl butyl phthalate as potentially harmful to fertility, unborn babies, and the endocrine system. The EU also regulates some phthalates to protect the environment.

===Australia and New Zealand===
A 2017 survey of foods and packaging in Australia and New Zealand led to recognition of DEHP and diisononyl phthalate as among possible contaminants posing a risk to human health, resulting in several regulations on these phthalates in both countries. Australia has a permanent ban on certain children&#x27;s products containing DEHP, which is considered poisonous if products containing it are placed in the mouths of children up to three years old.

===Canada===
In 1994, a Health Canada assessment found that DEHP and another phthalate product, B79P, were harmful to human health. The Canadian federal government responded by banning their use in cosmetics and restricting their use in other applications, such as soft toys and child-care products. In 1999, DEHP was put on the national List of Toxic Substances, under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999, and in 2021, it was deemed a risk to the environment. It is on the List of Ingredients that are Prohibited for Use in Cosmetic Products.

Twenty of the 28 phthalate substances under national screening programs are considered possible risks to human health or the environment. As of 2021, regulations to protect the environment against DEHP and B79P have not been enacted.

===European Union===

Some phthalates have been restricted in the European Union for use in children&#x27;s toys since 1999. DEHP, BBP, and DBP are restricted for all toys; DINP, DIDP, and DNOP are restricted only in toys that can be taken into the mouth. The restriction states that the amount of these phthalates may not be greater than 0.1% mass percent of the plasticized part of the toy.

Generally, the high molecular weight phthalates DINP, DIDP, and DPHP have been registered under REACH and have demonstrated their safety for use in current applications. They are not classified for any health or environmental effects.

The low molecular weight products BBP, DEHP, DIBP, and DBP were added to the Candidate list of Substances for Authorisation under REACH in 2008–9, and added to the Authorisation list, Annex XIV, in 2012. This means that from February 2015 they are not allowed to be produced in the EU unless authorisation has been granted for a specific use, although they may still be imported in consumer products. The creation of an Annex XV dossier, which could ban the import of products containing these chemicals, was being prepared jointly by the ECHA and Danish authorities, and expected to be submitted by April 2016.

Since 2021, the European Waste Framework Directive requires manufacturers, importers and distributors of products containing phthalates on the REACH Candidate List to notify the European Chemicals Agency.

In November 2021, the European Commission added endocrine disrupting properties to DEHP and other phthalates, meaning that companies must apply for REACH authorization for some uses that were previously exempted, including in food packaging, medical devices, and drug packaging.

====Legislation, additional====

===United States===
During August 2008, the United States Congress passed and President George W. Bush signed the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA), which became public law 110–314. Section 108 of that law specified that as of February 10, 2009, &quot;it shall be unlawful for any person to manufacture for sale, offer for sale, distribute in commerce, or import into the United States any children&#x27;s toy or child care article that contains concentrations of more than 0.1 percent of&quot; DEHP, DBP, or BBP and &quot;it shall be unlawful for any person to manufacture for sale, offer for sale, distribute in commerce, or import into the United States any children&#x27;s toy that can be placed in a child&#x27;s mouth or child care article that contains concentrations of more than 0.1 percent of&quot; DINP, DIDP, and DnOP. Furthermore, the law requires the establishment of a permanent review board to determine the safety of other phthalates. Prior to this legislation, the Consumer Product Safety Commission had determined that voluntary withdrawals of DEHP and diisononyl phthalate (DINP) from teethers, pacifiers, and rattles had eliminated the risk to children, and advised against enacting a phthalate ban.

In 1986, California voters approved an initiative to address concerns about exposure to toxic chemicals. That initiative became the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, also called Proposition 65. In December 2013, DINP was listed as a chemical &quot;known to the State of California to cause cancer&quot; Beginning in December 2014, companies with ten or more employees manufacturing, distributing or selling the product(s) containing DINP were required to provide a clear and reasonable warning for that product. The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, charged with maintaining the Proposition 65 list and enforcing its provisions, has implemented a &quot;No Significant Risk Level&quot; of 146 μg/day for DINP.

The CDC provided a 2011 public health statement on diethyl phthalate describing regulations and guidelines concerning its possible harmful health effects. Under laws for Superfund sites, the Environmental Protection Agency named diethyl phthalate as a hazardous substance. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration stated that the maximum amount of diethyl phthalate allowed in workroom air during an 8-hour workday, 40-hour workweek, is 5 milligrams per cubic meter.

==Identification in plastics==

Phthalates are used in some, but not all, PVC formulations, and there are no specific labeling requirements for phthalates. PVC plastics are typically used for various containers and hard packaging, medical tubing and bags, and are labeled &quot;Type 3&quot;. However, the presence of phthalates rather than other plasticizers is not marked on PVC items. Only unplasticized PVC (uPVC), which is mainly used as a hard construction material, has no plasticizers. If a more accurate test is needed, chemical analysis, for example by gas chromatography or liquid chromatography, can establish the presence of phthalates.

Polyethylene terephthalate (PET, PETE, Terylene, Dacron) is the main substance used to package bottled water and many sodas. Products containing PETE are labeled &quot;Type 1&quot; (with a &quot;1&quot; in the recycle triangle). Although the word &quot;phthalate&quot; appears in the name, PETE does not use phthalates as plasticizers. The terephthalate polymer PETE and the phthalate ester plasticizers are chemically different substances. Despite this, however, many studies have found phthalates, such as DEHP in bottled water and soda. One hypothesis is that these may have been introduced during plastic recycling.

<doc id="343554" wikidata="Q44077" url="?curid=343554" title="Jessica Alba">
<text>Jessica Marie Alba ( ; born April 28, 1981) is an American actress, businesswoman, and entrepreneur. She began her acting career at age 13 in &quot;Camp Nowhere&quot;, followed up by &quot;The Secret World of Alex Mack&quot; (both 1994), and rose to prominence at age 19 as the lead actress of the television series &quot;Dark Angel&quot; (2000–2002), for which she received a Golden Globe nomination.

Her big screen breakthrough came in &quot;Honey&quot; (2003). She soon established herself as a Hollywood actress, and has starred in numerous box office hits throughout her career, including &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; (2005), &quot;Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer&quot; (2007), &quot;Good Luck Chuck&quot; (2007), &quot;The Eye&quot; (2008), &quot;Valentine&#x27;s Day&quot; (2010), &quot;Little Fockers&quot; (2010), and &quot;&quot; (2016). She is a frequent collaborator with director Robert Rodriguez, having starred in &quot;Sin City&quot; (2005), &quot;Machete&quot; (2010), &quot;Spy Kids: All the Time in the World&quot; (2011), &quot;Machete Kills&quot; (2013), and &quot;Sin City: A Dame to Kill For&quot; (2014). From 2019 to 2020, Alba starred in the Spectrum action crime series &quot;L.A.&#x27;s Finest&quot;.

In 2011, Alba co-founded The Honest Company, a consumer goods company that sells baby, personal and household products. A number of magazines, including &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot;, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; and &quot;FHM&quot;, have included Alba on their lists of the world&#x27;s most beautiful women.

== Early life ==
Jessica Marie Alba was born in Pomona, California on April 28, 1981, to Catherine Louisa (&quot;née&quot; Jensen) and Mark David Alba. Her mother has Danish, Welsh, German, English and French ancestry, while her paternal grandparents, who were born in California, were children of Mexican immigrants. She has a younger brother, Joshua. Her third cousin, once removed, is writer Gustavo Arellano. Her father&#x27;s Air Force career took the family to Biloxi, Mississippi, and Del Rio, Texas, before they settled in Claremont, California when she was nine years old. Alba has described her family as &quot;very conservative… a traditional, Catholic, Latin American family&quot;, and herself as very liberal; she says she identified as a &quot;feminist&quot; as early as age five.

Alba&#x27;s early life was marked by a multitude of physical maladies. During childhood, she suffered from pneumonia four to five times a year and had partially collapsed lungs twice as well as a ruptured appendix and tonsillar cyst. She has also had asthma since she was a child. She became isolated from other children at school because she was hospitalized so often, no one knew her well enough to befriend her. She has said that her family&#x27;s frequent moving also contributed to her isolation from her peers. She graduated from Claremont High School at age 16 and subsequently attended the Atlantic Theater Company.

== Acting career ==

=== 1992–1999: Beginnings ===
Alba expressed an interest in acting from age five. In 1992, the eleven year old Alba persuaded her mother to take her to an acting competition in Beverly Hills, where the grand prize was free acting classes. She won the grand prize, and took her first acting lessons. An agent signed her nine months later. Her first film appearance was a small role in the 1994 feature &quot;Camp Nowhere&quot; as Gail. She was originally hired for two weeks but her role turned into a two-month job when one of the prominent actresses dropped out.

Alba appeared in two national television commercials for Nintendo and J. C. Penney as a child. She was later featured in several independent films. She branched out into television in 1994 with a recurring role as the vain Jessica in three episodes of the Nickelodeon comedy series &quot;The Secret World of Alex Mack&quot;. She then performed the role of Maya in the first two seasons of the 1995 television series &quot;Flipper&quot;. Under the tutelage of her lifeguard mother, Alba learned to swim before she could walk, and was a PADI certified scuba diving skills which were put to use on the show, which was filmed in Australia.

In 1998, she appeared as Melissa Hauer in a first-season episode of the Steven Bochco crime drama &quot;Brooklyn South&quot;, as Leanne in two episodes of &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;, and as Layla in an episode of &quot;Love Boat: The Next Wave&quot;. In 1999, she appeared in the Randy Quaid comedy feature &quot;P.U.N.K.S.&quot;. After Alba graduated from high school, she studied acting with William H. Macy and his wife, Felicity Huffman, at the Atlantic Theater Company, which was developed by Macy and Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright and film director, David Mamet. Alba rose to greater prominence in Hollywood in 1999 after appearing as a member of a snobby high school clique tormenting an insecure copy editor in the romantic comedy &quot;Never Been Kissed&quot;, opposite Drew Barrymore, and as the female lead in the little seen comedy horror film &quot;Idle Hands&quot;, alongside Devon Sawa.

=== 2000–2006: Worldwide recognition ===
Her big break came when James Cameron picked Alba from over 1000 candidates for the role of the genetically engineered super-soldier Max Guevara on the FOX sci-fi television series &quot;Dark Angel&quot;. The series ran for two seasons, until 2002, and earned Alba critical acclaim, a Golden Globe nomination, the Teen Choice Award for Choice Actress, and a Saturn Award for Best Actress. Her role has been cited as a feminist character and is considered a symbol of female empowerment. Writing for the University of Melbourne, Bronwen Auty considered Max &quot;the archetypal modern feminist hero—a young woman empowered to use her body actively to achieve goals&quot;, citing Max&#x27;s refusal to use firearms and instead using martial arts and knowledge as weapons. In 2004, Max was ranked #17 in &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s list of &quot;25 Greatest Sci-Fi Legends&quot;. Her &quot;Dark Angel&quot; role led to significant parts in films. She had her big screen breakthrough in 2003 when she starred as an aspiring dancer-choreographer in &quot;Honey&quot;. Rotten Tomatoes&#x27; critical consensus was: &quot;An attractive Jessica Alba and energetic dance numbers provide some lift to this corny and formulaic movie&quot;. Budgeted at US$18 million, the film made US$62.2 million.

Alba next played exotic dancer Nancy Callahan, as part of a long ensemble cast, in the neo-noir crime anthology film &quot;Sin City&quot; (2005), written, produced, and directed by Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller. It is based on Miller&#x27;s graphic novel of the same name. She had not heard about the novel prior to her involvement with the film, but was eager to work with Rodriguez. The film was a critical darling and grossed US$158.8 million. She received a MTV Movie Award for Sexiest Performance.

Alba portrayed the Marvel Comics character Invisible Woman in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; (also 2005), alongside Ioan Gruffudd, Chris Evans, Michael Chiklis, and Julian McMahon. &quot;The Guardian&quot;, in its review for the film, noted: &quot;Feminists and non-feminists alike must absorb the &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;&#x27;s most troubling paradox: having been admitted to the story on the grounds of her beauty, [Alba&#x27;s] superpower is to be invisible&quot;. The film was a commercial success despite negative reviews, grossing US$333.5 million worldwide. At the 2006 MTV Movie Awards, Alba earned nominations for Best Hero and Best On-Screen Team. Her last 2005 film was the thriller &quot;Into the Blue&quot;, where she portrayed, opposite Paul Walker, one half of a couple who find themselves in trouble with a drug lord after finding the illicit cargo of a sunken airplane. The film saw moderate box office returns, with a US$44.4 million worldwide gross. She hosted the 2006 MTV Movie Awards and performed sketches spoofing the movies &quot;King Kong&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;.

=== 2007–2010: Romantic comedies ===
Alba reprised her role in &quot;Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer&quot;, released in June 2007. According to Alba, Tim Story&#x27;s direction during an emotional scene almost made her quit acting. &quot;[He told me] &#x27;It looks too real. It looks too painful. Can you be prettier when you cry? Cry pretty, Jessica.&#x27; He was like, &#x27;Don&#x27;t do that thing with your face. Just make it flat. We can CGI the tears in.&#x27;&quot; According to Alba, this experience filled her with self-doubt: &quot;And then it all got me thinking: Am I not good enough? Are my instincts and my emotions not good enough? Do people hate them so much that they don&#x27;t want me to be a person? Am I not allowed to be a person in my work? And so I just said, &#x27;Fuck it. I don&#x27;t care about this business anymore.&#x27;&quot; The film grossed globally.

In &quot;Good Luck Chuck&quot; (also 2007), Alba portrayed the love interest of a womanizer dentist. She posed for one of the &quot;Good Luck Chuck&quot;″s theatrical posters parodying the well-known &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; cover photographed by Annie Leibovitz featuring John Lennon and Yoko Ono in similar poses. While the film was heavily panned by critics, it made almost US$60 million upon its release. Her third starring vehicle in 2007 was the psychological thriller &quot;Awake&quot;, portraying the girlfriend of a wealthy man who is about to have a heart transplant. Reviews were lukewarm, but Roger Ebert praised her performance, and budgeted at around US$8 million, the film made US$32.7 million.

In February 2008, she hosted the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences&#x27; Science and Technical Awards. Alba made her acting transition to the horror genre in the film &quot;The Eye&quot;, a remake of the Hong Kong original, in which she obtained the role of a successful classical violinist who receives an eye transplant that allows her to see into the supernatural world. Though the film was not well received by critics, her performance itself received mixed reviews. She garnered a Teen Choice for Choice Movie Actress: Horror–Thriller and a Razzie Award nomination for Worst Actress (shared with &quot;The Love Guru&quot;). In 2008, she also played a salesgirl in the independent romantic comedy &quot;Meet Bill&quot;, alongside Logan Lerman and Elizabeth Banks, and starred in the comedy &quot;The Love Guru&quot;, as a woman who inherits the Toronto Maple Leafs hockey team, opposite Mike Myers and Justin Timberlake. Mick LaSalle, of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, noting that she was &quot;prominently&quot; in the film, felt that she &quot;finally seems relaxed on camera&quot;. &quot;The Love Guru&quot; was a critical and commercial flop.
While Alba did not have any film release in 2009, five high-profile films released throughout 2010 featured her in significant roles. Her first role in the year was that of a prostitute in &quot;The Killer Inside Me&quot;, an adaptation of the book of the same name, opposite Kate Hudson and Casey Affleck, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival to polarized reactions from critics. Her next film was the romantic comedy &quot;Valentine&#x27;s Day&quot;, in which she played the girlfriend of a florist as part of a long ensemble cast consisting of Jessica Biel, Bradley Cooper, Taylor Lautner and Julia Roberts, among others. Despite negative reviews, the film was a commercial success, with a worldwide gross of US$216.5 million. In the action film &quot;Machete&quot;, Alba reunited with director Robert Rodriguez, taking on the role of an immigration officer torn between enforcing the law and doing what is popular in the eyes of her family. &quot;Machete&quot; made over US$44 million globally.

The drama &quot;An Invisible Sign of My Own&quot;, which Alba filmed in late 2008, premiered at the Hamptons Film Festival. In it, she portrayed a painfully withdrawn young woman. Her last 2010 film was the comedy &quot;Little Fockers&quot;, in which she played an extrovert drug representative, reuniting with Robert De Niro, who was also in &quot;Machete&quot;. Despite negative reviews from critics, the film grossed over US$310 million worldwide. For all her 2010 roles, she received a Razzie Award for Worst Supporting Actress.

=== 2011–present: action and independent media productions ===
In 2011, Alba worked for the third time with Robert Rodriguez in the film &quot;Spy Kids: All the Time in the World&quot;, portraying a retired spy who is called back into action. To bond with her new stepchildren, she invites them along. The film paled at the box office in comparison to the previous films in the franchise, but was still a moderate success, taking in US$85 million around the globe. Alba next appeared with Adam Scott, Richard Jenkins, Jane Lynch, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and Catherine O&#x27;Hara in the comedy &quot;A.C.O.D.&quot; (2013), portraying what the &quot;Washington Post&quot; described as a &quot;fellow child of divorce&quot;, with whom Scott&#x27;s character &quot;almost cheats on&quot; her girlfriend. &quot;ScreenRant&quot; critic Ben Kendrick wrote: &quot;[Winstead] and [Alba] also deliver in their contributions – though both of their characters are mainly designed to be mirrors for Carter to examine his own life and choices.&quot; &quot;A.C.O.D.&quot; received a limited theatrical run in North America. In 2013, Alba also made her voice acting debut in the moderately successful animated film &quot;Escape from Planet Earth&quot;.

Alba worked once again with director Rodriguez for two film sequels. She reprised her role of an Immigration Officer, in an uncredited cameo appearance, in &quot;Machete Kills&quot; (2013), which flopped with critics and audiences, and her much larger role of stripper Nancy Callahan, seeking to avenge her late protector, in &quot;Sin City: A Dame to Kill For&quot;, which was released in August 2014, on 2D and 3D. Unlike the first film, &quot;A Dame to Kill For&quot; was a commercial failure, grossing US$39 million against its US$65 million production budget, and received mixed reviews from film critics. &quot;Variety&quot; felt it was a &quot;late, limp attempt to turn Alba&#x27;s character from an exploited figure into an empowered one&quot;. She next took on the roles of a cabaret show performer in the dramedy &quot;Dear Eleanor&quot; (2014), the athletic girlfriend of a successful and well-respected English professor in the romantic comedy &quot;Some Kind of Beautiful&quot; (2014), a receptionist at a limo company in the thriller &quot;Stretch&quot; (also 2014), an emotionally vulnerable weapons trafficker in the crime comedy &quot;Barely Lethal&quot; (2015), and that of a documentary filmmaker in the horror film &quot;The Veil&quot; (2016); all films were released for limited theatrical runs and VOD.

In the action film &quot;&quot; (2016), alongside Jason Statham, Alba played the girlfriend of a retired hitman. She did Krav Maga to get into shape for the film, and was drawn to the strength her character exhibited, remarking: &quot;I think for these types of movies you don&#x27;t often get to see the female romantic lead kind of kick butt. I mean, it&#x27;s usually she&#x27;s being saved by the guy, and so it&#x27;s nice that I got to come to the table with a toughness, and a real heart&quot;. The film made US$125.7 million worldwide.

She will star in and executive produce a new documentary series for Disney+ called &quot;Parenting Without Borders&quot; (working title) which will focus on families around the world and their beliefs and culture.

== Other endeavors ==
=== The Honest Company ===
In January 2012, Alba and business partner Christopher Gavigan launched The Honest Company, selling a collection of household goods, diapers, and body care products. The company was successful, and was valued at US$1 billion .

In early 2013, Alba released her book, &quot;The Honest Life,&quot; based on her experiences creating a natural, non-toxic life for her family. The book became a &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller. In October 2015, Alba launched a collection of skin care and beauty products called Honest Beauty.

As of April 2022, Alba owned 6.5 percent of the company. She was employed as the company&#x27;s chief creative officer, receiving an annually base salary of $700,000 and restricted stock valued $1,500,000. Alba stepped down as chief creative officer in April 2024.

=== Charity and activism ===
Alba posed for a bondage-themed print advertising campaign by Declare Yourself, a campaign encouraging voter registration among youth for the 2008 United States presidential election. The ads, photographed by Mark Liddell, feature Alba wrapped in and gagged with black tape, and drew national media attention. Alba said of doing the advertisements that &quot;it didn&#x27;t freak me out at all.&quot; Alba also said, &quot;I think it is important for young people to be aware of the need we have in this country to get them more active politically...People respond to things that are shocking.&quot;

Alba endorsed and supported Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama during the 2008 primary season. She also endorsed Hillary Clinton&#x27;s campaign for president.

In June 2009, while filming &quot;The Killer Inside Me&quot; in Oklahoma City, Alba was involved in a controversy with residents when she pasted posters of sharks around town. Alba said that she was trying to bring attention to the diminishing population of great white sharks. Media outlets speculated that Alba would be pursued and charged with vandalism. On June 16, 2009, Oklahoma City police said that they would not pursue criminal charges against Alba, because none of the property owners wanted to pursue it. Alba apologized in a statement to &quot;People&quot; magazine and said that she regretted her actions. She later donated an undisclosed amount of money (over US$500) to the United Way, whose billboard she had obscured with one of the shark posters.

In 2011, Alba participated in a two-day lobbying effort in Washington D.C. in support of the Safe Chemicals Act, a revision of the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976. Alba returned to Capitol Hill in 2015 to lobby lawmakers as they once again debated a replacement for the 1976 Substances Control Act. She has also been a strong supporter of gay rights and on June 27, 2013, she expressed her delight with the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision to strike down DOMA on her Twitter account. She tweeted &quot;#equality #love&quot;.

Alba&#x27;s charity work has included participation with Clothes Off Our Back, Habitat for Humanity, National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, Project HOME, RADD, Revlon Run/Walk for Women, SOS Children&#x27;s Villages, Soles4Souls, Step Up and Baby2Baby. Alba is an ambassador for the 1Goal movement to provide education to children in Africa. She has also served as a Baby2Baby &quot;angel&quot; ambassador, donating and helping to distribute items such as diapers and clothing to families in Los Angeles.
In 2015, Alba and The Honest Company sponsored a laboratory at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. The lab was announced to be a specialized room designed to keep out dust and particles, where a team of epidemiologists would research links between household chemicals and autism.

== Public image ==
Alba has received attention for her looks over the years and has been included in several publications&#x27; lists of the most attractive celebrities of the time. She was included in &quot;Maxim&quot; magazine&#x27;s Hot 100 list multiple times from 2001 to 2014. On this she has said, &quot;I have to go to certain lengths to use sexuality to my advantage, while guiding people to thinking the way I want them to.&quot;
In 2002, she was voted the fifth Sexiest Female Star in a Hollywood.com poll. In 2005, she was named one of &quot;People&quot; Magazine&#x27;s 50 Most Beautiful People, and appeared in the magazine&#x27;s 100 Most Beautiful list in 2007. She has also been named on &quot;FHM&quot;&#x27;s Sexiest Women lists.

Alba was named among &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;25 Sexiest Celebrities&quot; in 2006, and appeared on its cover that year. She was involved in litigation against &quot;Playboy&quot; for its use of her image on this cover (from a promotional shot for &quot;Into the Blue&quot;) without her consent, which she contended gave the impression that she was featured in the issue in a &quot;nude pictorial&quot;. She later dropped the lawsuit after receiving a personal apology from &quot;Playboy&quot; owner Hugh Hefner, who agreed to make donations to two charities Alba had supported. Also in 2006, readers of AskMen.com voted Alba #1 on its &quot;99 Most Desirable Women&quot; list. In 2007, Alba was ranked No.4 on &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Sexiest Movie Stars&quot;. Both &quot;GQ&quot; and &quot;InStyle&quot; had Alba on their June 2008 covers. She appeared in the 2009 Campari calendar, which featured photos of her posing; Campari printed 9,999 copies of the calendar. In 2011, she was named one of the &quot;100 Hottest Women of All-Time&quot; by &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot;, and in 2012 &quot;People&quot; named her one of the year&#x27;s &quot;Most Beautiful at Every Age&quot;.

In 2010, reports surfaced that a 21-year-old Chinese girl was seeking plastic surgery to resemble Alba in order to win back an ex-boyfriend; the star spoke out against the perceived need to change one&#x27;s appearance for love.

Alba has commented on her fears of being typecast as a sex kitten based on the bulk of parts offered to her. In an interview, Alba said she wanted to be taken seriously as an actress but believed she needed to do movies that she would otherwise not be interested in to build her career, stating that eventually she hoped to be more selective in her film projects.

Alba has been quoted saying she will not do nudity for a role. She was given the option to appear nude in &quot;Sin City&quot; by the film&#x27;s directors, Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez, but declined the offer, saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t do nudity. I just don&#x27;t. Maybe that makes me a bad actress. Maybe I won&#x27;t get hired in some things. But I have too much anxiety&quot;. She remarked of a &quot;GQ&quot; shoot in which she was scantily clad, &quot;They didn&#x27;t want me to wear the granny panties, but I said, &#x27;If I&#x27;m gonna be topless I need to wear granny panties.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Alba was raised a Catholic throughout her teenage years but left the Catholic Church due to feeling unaccepted because of her multi-ethnic appearance. After a four-year stint as a born-again Christian, she backed away from religion because she felt she was being judged for her appearance, explaining, &quot;Older men would hit on me, and my youth pastor said it was because I was wearing provocative clothing, when I wasn&#x27;t. It just made me feel like if I was in any way desirable to the opposite sex that it was my fault and it made me ashamed of my body and being a woman.&quot;

Alba also had objections to the church&#x27;s condemnations of premarital sex and homosexuality, and what she saw as a lack of strong female role models in the Bible, explaining: &quot;I thought it was a nice guide, but it certainly wasn&#x27;t how I was going to live my life.&quot; Her &quot;religious devotion [began] to wane&quot; at age 15 when she guest-starred as a teenager with gonorrhea in the throat in a 1996 episode of the television series &quot;Chicago Hope&quot;. Her friends at church reacted negatively to her role, making her lose faith in the Church. However, she has stated that she still holds a belief in God.

While filming &quot;Dark Angel&quot; in January 2000, Alba began a three-year relationship with her co-star Michael Weatherly. Weatherly proposed to Alba on her 20th birthday, which she accepted. In August 2003, they announced that they had ended their relationship. In July 2007, Alba spoke out about the breakup, saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t know [why I got engaged]. I was a virgin. He was 12 years older than me. I thought he knew better. My parents weren&#x27;t happy. They&#x27;re really religious. They believe God wouldn&#x27;t allow the Bible to be written if it wasn&#x27;t what they are supposed to believe. I&#x27;m completely different.&quot;

Alba met Cash Warren, son of actor Michael Warren, while filming &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; in 2004. They were married in Los Angeles in May 2008. They have three children: daughters Honor Marie, born in June 2008, and Haven Garner born in August 2011, and a son, Hayes, born in December 2017. The first pictures of her eldest daughter, which appeared in the July 2008 issue of &quot;OK!&quot; magazine, reportedly earned Alba US$1.5 million. On January 16, 2025, Alba announced that they had separated. 

In 2014, Alba appeared in Henry Louis Gates Jr.&#x27;s genealogy series &quot;Finding Your Roots&quot;, which documented her learning about her lineage, which was traced back to the ancient Maya civilization. The show&#x27;s research indicated that her surname was not inherited from a Spanish man, since her father&#x27;s paternal line (Y-DNA) was Haplogroup Q-M3, being Indigenous American in origin. His matrilineal line (mtDNA) was Jewish and revealed that lawyer Alan Dershowitz is a genetic relative of hers. Alba&#x27;s global admixture was 72.7% European, 22.5% East Asian and Native American, 2% Sub-Saharan African, 0.3% Middle Eastern and North African, 0.1% South Asian and 2.4% &quot;no match&quot;.

<text>An interval signal, or tuning signal, is a characteristic sound or musical phrase used in international broadcasting, numbers stations, and by some domestic broadcasters, played before commencement or during breaks in transmission, but most commonly between programs in different languages.

It serves several purposes:
* It helps a listener using a radio with an analog tuner to find the correct frequency.
* It informs other stations that the frequency is in use.
* It serves as a station identifier even if the language used in the subsequent broadcast is not one the listener understands.

The practice began in Europe in the 1920s and 1930s and was carried over into shortwave broadcasts. The use of interval signals has declined with the advent of digital tuning systems, but has not vanished. Interval signals were not required on commercial channels in the United States, where jingles were used as identification.

<text>Koei Co., Ltd. was a Japanese video game publisher, developer, and distributor founded in 1978. The company is known for its historical simulation games based on the novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, as well as simulation games based on pseudo-historical events.

The company found mainstream success in a series of loosely historical action games, the flagship titles of which are the &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; and &quot;Samurai Warriors&quot; series, also known as the &quot;Musō&quot; series. Koei also owned a division known as Ruby Party, which focuses on otome games.

On April 1, 2009, Koei merged with Tecmo to create the Tecmo Koei Holdings holding company. After operating as subsidiaries of Tecmo Koei Holdings for exactly a year, Koei merged with Tecmo on April 1, 2010 and combined both companies as one under the name Tecmo Koei Games (with Koei as the actual surviving corporation).

==History==
Koei was established in July 1978 by (also known as ) and . Yoichi was a student at Keio University, and when his family&#x27;s rural dyestuffs business failed, he decided to pursue his interest in programming. The company has remained located in the Hiyoshi area of Yokohama.

The company initially focused on personal computer sales and made-to-order business software. In 1982, the company released the erotic title (eroge) , which was an early role-playing adventure game with color graphics, owing to the eight-color palette of the PC-8001 computer. It became a hit, helping Koei become a major software company. In March the same year Koei released &quot;Underground Exploration&quot;, the earliest known Japanese RPG. In 1983 it released , a historical strategy game set during the Sengoku period of Japanese history. The game went on to receive numerous awards, and Koei produced several more such games set against the backdrop of world history, including &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, set during the Three Kingdoms period of Chinese history, and , set in Portugal during the Age of Exploration.

In 1988, Koei established a North American subsidiary, Koei America Corporation, in California. This subsidiary localized Koei games for export to all territories outside Japan, as well as producing original games and concepts with the leadership of designer Stieg Hedlund, like &quot;Liberty or Death&quot;, &quot;Celtic Tales: Balor of the Evil Eye&quot;, &quot;Gemfire&quot; and &quot;&quot;. After Hedlund&#x27;s departure, this subsidiary ceased game development in 1995, focusing instead on localization, sales and marketing.

Though none of Koei&#x27;s historical simulations achieved mass market success, they acquired a loyal cult following. This following allowed Koei to remain profitable, since they could reliably predict how many copies of their games would sell (especially important during the cartridge era, when a surplus of unsold cartridges on a single game was often enough to bankrupt a company).

A Canadian subsidiary, Koei Canada, Inc. was established in early 2001, and a European subsidiary, Koei Limited was established in early 2003 in Hertfordshire, United Kingdom. Koei also maintains subsidiaries in mainland China, Korea, Taiwan and Lithuania. Recently, Koei created a Singapore branch for game development such as &quot;Sangokushi Online&quot;.

Koei&#x27;s Ruby Party division specializes on games labeled as Neoromance: GxB dating sims, usually with extra side-quests. Out of the three Neoromance series, the best known is Angelique, which has been in production since 1994. Harukanaru Toki no Naka de is a newer Neoromance hit, with many sequels and an anime television series based on it. The newest game in the series, Kin&#x27;iro no Corda, is gaining popularity partially because the manga series it was based on, has been recently licensed by &quot;Viz&quot; for English language publishing. It gaining more popularity though, and an anime television series based on it began airing in October 2006. A sequel was also released on the PlayStation 2 in March 2007.

On September 4, 2008, Koei announced that it was in talks to purchase ailing competitor Tecmo. They agreed in November 2008 to merge on April 1, 2009 to form Tecmo Koei Holdings. On January 26, 2009 the two companies approved the merger, the holding company formed on April 1, 2009 as planned.

Koei changed its name to Tecmo Koei Games on April 1, 2010 by absorbing Tecmo, and again on July 1, 2014, to Koei Tecmo Games. Koei&#x27;s subsidiaries in the United States, Europe and Korea already had their names changed months before the Japanese parent. The developing operations of the original Koei and Tecmo companies were spun off on March 15, 2010 as new separate subsidiaries under the names of Koei Co., Ltd and Tecmo Co., Ltd respectively, but they were absorbed the following year by Tecmo Koei Games, on April 1, 2011.

<text>Desidae is a family of spiders, some of which are known as intertidal spiders. The family is named for the genus &quot;Desis&quot;, members of which inhabit the intertidal zone. The family has been reevaluated in recent years and now includes inland genera and species as well, such as &quot;Badumna&quot; and &quot;Phryganoporus&quot;. In 2017, the family Amphinectidae was merged into Desidae and the family Toxopidae was separated from it. Those intertidal spiders that are truly marine commonly live in barnacle shells, which they seal up with silk; this allows them to maintain an air bubble during high tide. They emerge at night to feed on various small arthropods that live in the intertidal zone.

==Distribution==
As now circumscribed, the family Desidae is mainly found in South America and Australasia, with some species reaching north to Malaysia.

&quot;Metaltella simoni&quot; has been introduced in a large part of the Southern United States (records exist from California, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Florida). It is feared that it could extirpate the native titanoecid species &quot;Titanoeca brunnea&quot;.

<doc id="343559" wikidata="Q7297" url="?curid=343559" title="Emperor Huan of Han">
<text>Emperor Huan of Han (; 132 – 25 January 168) was the 27th emperor of the Han dynasty after he was enthroned by the Empress Dowager and her brother Liang Ji on 1 August 146. He was a great-grandson of Emperor Zhang. He was the 11th emperor of the Eastern Han dynasty.

After Emperor Zhi was poisoned to death by the powerful official Liang Ji in July 146, Liang Ji persuaded his sister, the regent Empress Dowager Liang to make the 14-year-old Liu Zhi, the Marquess of Liwu, who was betrothed to their sister Liang Nüying (), emperor. As the years went by, Emperor Huan, offended by Liang Ji&#x27;s autocratic and violent nature, became determined to eliminate the Liang family with the help of eunuchs. Emperor Huan succeeded in removing Liang Ji in September 159 but this only caused an increase in the influence of these eunuchs over all aspects of the government. Corruption during this period had reached a boiling point. In 166, university students rose up in protest against the government and called on Emperor Huan to eliminate all corrupt officials. Instead of listening, Emperor Huan ordered the arrest of all students involved. Emperor Huan has largely been viewed as an emperor who might have had some intelligence but lacked wisdom in governing his empire; and his reign contributed greatly to the downfall of the Eastern Han dynasty.

&quot;Hou Hanshu&quot; (&quot;Book of the Later Han&quot;) recounts that one Roman envoy (perhaps sent by emperor Marcus Aurelius) reached the Chinese capital Luoyang in 166 and was greeted by Emperor Huan.

Emperor Huan died in January 168 after reigning for more than 21 years; he was 36. He was succeeded by Emperor Ling of Han.

==Family background and ascension==
Liu Zhi was born in 132, to Liu Yi (), the Marquess of Liwu, and his concubine Yan Ming ().

Liu Yi was the son of Liu Kai (), Prince Xiao of Hejian (and therefore a grandson of Emperor Zhang), and he had initially been made the Prince of Pingyuan as the heir of his cousin Liu Sheng () by Empress Dowager Deng Sui, the regent for Emperor An, who was impressed with his abilities. That led to rumors that Empress Deng was looking to replace Emperor An, Prince Yi&#x27;s cousin, with Prince Yi. After Empress Dowager Deng died in April 121, Emperor An, bearing a grudge against Prince Yi, demoted him to the rank of Marquess of Duxiang and exiled him to his father&#x27;s principality. During the reign of Emperor Shun, Prince Kai requested that he be allowed to give Liwu County, part of his principality, to his son, and Emperor Shun permitted it. Marquess Yi thus became the Marquess of Liwu.

By 146, Liu Zhi had inherited his father&#x27;s title and was betrothed to Liang Nüying, the younger sister of the regent Empress Dowager Liang Na and her violent and corrupt brother, Grand Marshal Liang Ji. That year, Liang Ji, bearing a grudge against the eight-year-old Emperor Zhi for calling him an &quot;arrogant general,&quot; murdered the young emperor by poison. The officials largely favored Emperor Zhi&#x27;s first cousin Liu Suan () the Prince of Qinghe, who was described as a solemn and proper man. Prince Suan&#x27;s age was not given in history, though he appeared to be an adult by this time. However, Liang Ji was hesitant to yield authority to an able emperor. Because Marquess Zhi was betrothed to his sister and relatively young, Liang Ji felt that he could control him and insisted on making him emperor. Marquess Zhi took the throne later that year as Emperor Huan.

==Early reign under Empress dowager Liang regency and under Liang Ji&#x27;s shadow==
After Emperor Huan&#x27;s ascension at age 14, Empress Dowager Liang continued to serve as regent. However, her brother Liang Ji came to take on more and more control, even more than the empress dowager. Emperor Huan posthumously honored his grandfather and father as emperors but, because the empress dowager was regent, did not honor his mother Yan Ming as an empress dowager; rather, she was given the title of an imperial consort. His father&#x27;s wife, Lady Ma, was belatedly honored as an imperial consort as well in 148. In 147, he married Empress Dowager Liang and Liang Ji&#x27;s sister Liang Nüying, making her empress. It appeared that, while the Liangs were in control, Emperor Huan was not a complete puppet. Instead, as a sign of bad things to come, he trusted eunuchs in his decision-making.

That same year, Liang Ji, in conjunction with the eunuchs Tang Heng () and Zuo Guan (), but with Emperor Huan&#x27;s clear approval, falsely accused the honest officials Li Gu () and Du Qiao () of conspiring to overthrow Emperor Huan and replace him with Prince Suan. Li and Du were executed, while Prince Suan was demoted to marquess status and committed suicide.

In 150, Empress Dowager Liang announced that she was retiring and returning imperial authority to Emperor Huan. Later that year, she died. Emperor Huan then honored his mother as an empress dowager. However, without his sister to curb his power, Liang Ji came to be even more powerful than before. His violence and corruption increased and he stamped out all dissent with threats of death. He even threw his humble and peace-loving brother Liang Buyi () out of the government.

In May 152, Empress Dowager Yan died. Because Emperor Huan had inherited the throne through a collateral line, he was not permitted by customs to be the mourner. Instead, his brother Liu Shi () the Prince of Pingyuan served as chief mourner.

In 153, the first major public confrontation between an official and a powerful eunuch occurred—foreshadowing many to come. Zhu Mu (), the governor of Ji Province (modern central and northern Hebei) had found out that the father of the powerful eunuch Zhao Zhong () had been improperly buried in a jade vest, an honor that was reserved to imperial princes. He ordered an investigation: Zhao&#x27;s father was exhumed and the jade vest was stripped away, an act that angered Zhao and Emperor Huan. Zhu was not only removed from his post but was sentenced to hard labor.

==Coup d&#x27;état against Liang Ji==
As the years went by, Emperor Huan became increasingly disgruntled at Liang Ji&#x27;s control of the government and was also angered by Empress Liang&#x27;s behavior. Because of her position as Empress Dowager Liang and Liang Ji&#x27;s sister, Empress Liang was wasteful in her luxurious living, far exceeding any past empress, and was exceedingly jealous. She did not have a son and, because she did not want any other imperial consorts to have sons, she would find some way to murder pregnant consorts. Emperor Huan did not dare to react to her due to Liang Ji&#x27;s power, but rarely had sexual relations with her. In 159, angry and depressed that she had lost her husband&#x27;s favor, Empress Liang died.

This death started a chain of events that led to Liang Ji&#x27;s downfall later that year. Liang, in order to continue to control Emperor Huan, had adopted his wife&#x27;s beautiful cousin (the stepdaughter of her uncle Liang Ji (梁紀—note different characters despite the same pronunciation)), Deng Mengnü (), as his own daughter, changing her family name to Liang. He and Sun gave Liang Mengnü to Emperor Huan as an imperial consort. After Empress Liang&#x27;s death, they hoped that she would eventually be made empress. To completely control her, Liang Ji planned to have her mother, Lady Xuan (), killed: he sent assassins against her but the assassination was foiled by the powerful eunuch Yuan She (), a neighbor of Lady Xuan.

Lady Xuan reported the assassination attempt to Emperor Huan, who was greatly angered. He entered into a conspiracy with eunuchs Tang Heng, Zuo Guan, Shan Chao (), Xu Huang (), and Ju Yuan () to overthrow Liang—sealing the oath by biting open Dan&#x27;s arm and swearing by his blood. Liang Ji had some suspicions about what Emperor Huan and the eunuchs were up to, and began an investigation. The five eunuchs quickly reacted. They had Emperor Huan openly announce that he was taking back power from Liang Ji and mobilized the imperial guards to defend the palace against a counterattack by Liang. They surrounded Liang&#x27;s house and forced him to surrender. Liang and Sun were unable to respond and committed suicide. The entire Liang and Sun clans (except for Liang Ji&#x27;s brothers Liang Buyi and Liang Meng [梁蒙], who had previously already died) were arrested and slaughtered. A large number of officials were executed or deposed for close association with Liang—so many that the government was almost unable to function for some time. Liang and Sun&#x27;s properties were confiscated by the imperial treasury, which allowed the taxes to be reduced by 50% for one year. The people greatly celebrated Liang Ji&#x27;s death.

==Late reign: empowerment of the eunuchs==
After Liang Ji&#x27;s death, Emperor Huan made Liang Mengnü empress. However, he disliked her family name and therefore ordered her to take the family name Bo (). He later found out that her original family name was actually Deng, and therefore had her family name restored.

The people had great expectations for Emperor Huan&#x27;s administration after the death of Liang Ji. However, having been unable to overthrow Liang Ji without the five eunuchs&#x27; help, Emperor Huan greatly rewarded them, making them and several other eunuchs who participated in the coup d&#x27;état marquesses and further giving them governmental posts that conferred tremendous power. Further, the five eunuch-marquesses openly engaged in massive corruption and became extremely wealthy with Emperor Huan&#x27;s approval. A song written about the four remaining eunuch-marquesses following Dan&#x27;s death described them in this way:

:&quot;Zuo can reverse heaven&#x27;s decision. Ju sits by himself without match. Xu is a lying wolf. Tang&#x27;s power is as prevalent as the falling rain.&quot;

Emperor Huan himself was also corrupt and unwilling to accept any criticism. In 159, when the honest county magistrate Li Yun () submitted a petition urging him to curb the power of the eunuchs, Emperor Huan was deeply offended that he included the phrase, &quot;Is the emperor turning blind?&quot;; despite intercessions by a number of officials and even some fair-minded eunuchs, had Li and his friend Du Zhong () both executed.

In 161, apparently in reaction to spending due to renewed Qiang rebellions and new agrarian revolts, Emperor Huan issued an edict offering minor offices for sale—including imperial guard officer positions. This practice set a bad precedent and would become even more prevalent and problematic under Emperor Huan&#x27;s successor, Emperor Ling. While Emperor Huan actually was able to find competent generals to suppress the rebellions or to persuade the rebels to surrender, the rampant corruption came to cause new rebellions as soon as the old ones are quelled.

In 165, perhaps finally fed up with the eunuchs&#x27; excess, Emperor Huan demoted Ju, the only eunuch remaining of the original five. Several other corrupt eunuchs were also demoted or deposed. However, soon thereafter, the eunuchs&#x27; powers were restored again. For the rest of Emperor Huan&#x27;s reign, there would be a cycle of rise and fall of power of the eunuchs after conflicts with officials, but inexorably the eunuchs would return, becoming more powerful than before. This cycle would continue until the reign of Emperor Ling, when an army led by the regent He Jin and the powerful noblemen Yuan Shao and Yuan Shu marched into the imperial capitol of Luoyang and massacred the eunuchs.

Later that year, apparently tired of Empress Deng and sick of her disputes with a favorite consort of his, Consort Guo, Emperor Huan deposed and imprisoned her. She died in anger, and several of her family members were executed. He wanted to make another consort, Tian Sheng () empress, but officials opposed this on the basis that she was of lowly birth. They recommended that he make Consort Dou Miao (), the daughter of Dou Wu (), a Confucian scholar and a descendant of Dou Rong (), who had contributed much to the establishment of the Eastern Han dynasty, empress. Even though he did not favor Consort Dou, Emperor Huan gave in to pressure and made her empress.

In 166, a major public confrontation between university students and eunuchs evolved into a major incident. The governor of the capital province (modern western Henan and central Shaanxi), Li Ying, had arrested and executed a fortuneteller named Zhang Cheng (), who had had his son kill a man, having predicted that a general pardon was coming. Li was arrested and 200 some university students signed a petition requesting his release. This further angered Emperor Huan, who had the students arrested. Only after about a year and Dou Wu&#x27;s intercession were Li and the university students released, but all of them had their citizenship rights stripped. This incident was later known as the first Disaster of Partisan Prohibition.

In January 168, Emperor Huan died without a son. Empress Dou, jealous of how he favored Consort Tian, had her immediately put to death. She conducted a survey among the members of the imperial clan and decided on the 11-year-old Liu Hong (), the Marquess of Jieduting, who then ascended the throne as Emperor Ling. On 9 March 168, Emperor Huan was buried and given the temple name &quot;Weizong&quot;, but this temple name was later revoked in 190 during the reign of Emperor Xian of Han.

The following year he took a supporting dramatic turn in the Gus Van Sant drama &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry, He Won&#x27;t Get Far on Foot&quot; (2018). The film received critical acclaim and starred Joaquin Phoenix, Rooney Mara and Jonah Hill. He reprised his role in &quot;Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle&quot;&#x27;s sequel, &quot;&quot; (2019), which like its predecessor was also a box-office success, becoming one of the highest-grossing films of 2019.

Tenacious D can be seen performing in the 90s-era Pauly Shore film &quot;Bio-Dome&quot; where the duo is performing its song &quot;The Five Needs&quot; at a &quot;Save the Environment&quot; party. Black was also a guest star on an episode of &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot; entitled &quot;Ellen the Musical&quot;, alongside Broadway star Kristin Chenoweth and teenage singer-actress Olivia Olson. On the show, besides singing, he discussed his then-upcoming film &quot;Nacho Libre&quot; with the host.

Black, as a member of Tenacious D, won the award for Best Metal Performance at the 57th Grammy Awards. The song &quot;The Last in Line&quot; won the award, a cover of the song of the same name by Dio that appeared on the tribute album &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;.

On July 14, 2024, Tenacious D celebrated Gass&#x27; birthday during their performance at the ICC Sydney Theater. A birthday cake was brought out and Black encouraged Gass to make a wish. Gass responded, &quot;Don&#x27;t miss Trump next time,&quot; referring to the attempted assassination of Donald Trump the day before. Two days later, Black wrote on social media that he was &quot;blindsided&quot; by Gass&#x27; comment and that he did not condone hate speech or political violence &quot;in any form&quot;. Tenacious D canceled the rest of their world tour, and Black said their &quot;creative plans are on hold&quot;. Gass apologized on social media, calling his comment &quot;highly inappropriate, dangerous and a terrible mistake&quot;. Gass deleted his apology later that week.

=== YouTube channel ===
On December 21, 2018, Black created a YouTube channel called &quot;Jablinski Games&quot;. Within one week of its launch, it had amassed over 1 million subscribers. The videos published on the channel are typically either candid vlogs involving Black and his two sons, or gaming content. Black created the channel largely to bond with his son, who serves as videographer and editor of the channel. On July 21, 2019, Black took part in a Minecraft stream with popular YouTuber PewDiePie to raise money for the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), in the wake of the suicide of Etika in June 2019. After two days of streaming, they raised $30,479 with the stream being broadcast live both on YouTube and on the streaming platform DLive. As of June 2023, Jablinski Games has 5.04 million subscribers and 216 million video views.

=== Production company ===
In August 2006, Black registered his own production company, Electric Dynamite Productions, Inc. The company&#x27;s first work produced was the 2009 mockumentary &quot;Branson&quot;, which was a co-production with BranMo Productions and Perfect Weekend. In 2011, the company would produce two TV-movies, My Life As an Experiment and Shredd. In 2013, the company notably produced TV series &quot;Ghost Ghirls&quot; for the now-defunct Yahoo! Screen, as well as obtained the rights to adapt the UK mockumentary &quot;Wizard&#x27;s Way&quot; into a feature film. The company would also be a producer credit on &quot;The D Train&quot; (2015) and &quot;The Polka King&quot; (2017), both of which featured Black in the starring role. The company produced &quot;The Aquabats! RadVentures!&quot; in 2018, the dark-comedy film &quot;Happily&quot; in 2021.

===Accolades===
== Personal life ==
At age 14, Black struggled with cocaine use. He said, &quot;I was having a lot of troubles with cocaine... I was hanging out with some pretty rough characters. I was scared to go to school because one of them wanted to kill me. I wanted to get out of there.&quot; One of Black&#x27;s brothers, Howard, died of AIDS in 1991 at age 36. His oldest brother, Neil Siegel, is an engineer, scientist, and musician.

Black dated actress Laura Kightlinger between 1996 and 2005. In January 2006, Black became engaged to singer Tanya Haden, a daughter of jazz bassist Charlie Haden. They had both attended Crossroads School, and 15 years after graduating they met again at a friend&#x27;s birthday party. They married on March 14, 2006, in Big Sur, California. Their sons were born in 2006 and 2008.

Although an atheist, Black identifies as nominally Jewish, and fatherhood influenced his decision to raise his children in the Jewish faith.

Black endorsed Barack Obama&#x27;s 2012 re-election campaign. In 2015, he visited Kampala as part of Comic Relief USA&#x27;s Red Nose Day. Black is an outspoken critic of Donald Trump. On the day of Trump&#x27;s 2017 presidential inauguration, he and Tenacious D bandmate Kyle Gass performed their 2006 protest song &quot;The Government Totally Sucks&quot;. Black said to the audience beforehand, &quot;We haven&#x27;t played it for years, because it just never felt appropriate—but now, we&#x27;re happy to unleash the beast. The government totally sucks.&quot; Before the 2022 election, Black hosted a letter and text writing party to rally VoteRiders volunteers engaged in educating eligible voters about voter ID requirements in their states. Of the 2022 midterms, he said, &quot;[S]o much is on the ballot this cycle. We&#x27;ve got a woman&#x27;s right to choose. The environment is on the ballot, environmental protections. And not to mention democracy is on the ballot. There&#x27;s so, there&#x27;s so many divides in this country right now.&quot; Black said he viewed a potential reelection bid by Trump as a threat that is &quot;always lurking in the background.&quot;

<text>James Edward Abbott, (August 18, 1942 – July 26, 2020) was a Canadian politician, a Conservative member of the House of Commons of Canada. Abbott was a member of the Reform Party from 1993 to 2000 and a member of the Canadian Alliance from 2000 to 2004. Originally representing the riding of Kootenay East, he had represented Kootenay—Columbia since the boundaries were redrawn, and the name changed, in 1997. Before retiring, Abbott was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for International Cooperation (Canada). On October 15, 2007, he was sworn in as a member of the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada, and as such was entitled to the style &quot;The Honourable&quot; for life.

On June 30, 2010, he attended the inauguration of President Benigno Aquino III in the Philippines, as the representative of Canada.

Abbott died in Cranbrook, British Columbia on July 26, 2020, at the age of 77.

<text>Diane Ablonczy (née Broadway; ; born May 6, 1949) is a former Canadian Member of Parliament who served in the House of Commons of Canada. Ablonczy represented Calgary ridings from 1993 to 2015, sitting first with the Reform Party of Canada, then with the Canadian Alliance, and finally with the Conservative Party of Canada. She served as the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Americas and Consular Affairs) from January 4, 2011 to July 15, 2013. She was previously appointed Minister of State (Seniors) on January 19, 2010. She held the position of Minister of State (Small Business and Tourism) from October 30, 2008, Secretary of State (Small Business and Tourism) from August 14, 2007, and served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance from February 2006. Previously, Ablonczy served as Chief Opposition Critic for Citizenship and Immigration, Health, and Human Resources Development.

Ablonczy was first elected to the House of Commons in 1993 as the Reform Party Member of Parliament (MP) for Calgary North. In the riding redistribution of 1996, the riding of Calgary North ceased to exist and Ablonczy was re-elected as MP for Calgary—Nose Hill in 1997 (Reform Party), 2000 (Canadian Alliance), 2004, 2006, 2008, and 2011 (Conservative Party). On July 4, 2013, Ablonczy announced she would not seek re-election in the 2015 federal election.

==Background==
Diane Broadway was born in 1949 in Peoria, Illinois, United States, as the oldest of six children. A year later the family moved to Three Hills, Alberta, and Ablonczy grew up in a variety of places in rural Alberta. In 1967 she graduated from high school in Lac La Biche. In 1973 she received her Education degree from the University of Calgary and subsequently taught English, creative writing, and other subjects.

She married Tom Ablonczy, a well site engineer and refugee of the 1956 Hungarian revolution. They had one daughter. They ran a barley-growing operation, and in 1980 Diane earned her law degree from the University of Calgary. The family moved to Calgary where she had her general law practice from 1981–1991. She was widowed in 1984 and is now married to Ron Sauer. She has one daughter, four stepchildren, and eight grandchildren.

==Political career==

Ablonczy&#x27;s first political involvement was in 1982, when she briefly belonged to the Western Canada Concept party, but left to join the Provincial Rights Association (PRA) a few months later. Since the PRA was formed too late to gain official political party status, she ran as an independent candidate in Calgary-Mountain View in the 1982 Alberta provincial election.

In early 1987, Ablonczy joined the Reform Association of Canada, and later that year became a founding member of the Reform Party of Canada. She was elected as the first Party Chairman and served two terms in this role. As Chair she was active in developing the Party&#x27;s organization, administration, and communications structure, acting as a senior Party spokesperson and encouraging the growth of the Party&#x27;s membership. In 1991, she set aside her law practice and went on staff for the Party as a special assistant to Reform Party Leader Preston Manning, with responsibility for Party communications and strategic planning.

In the 1993 federal election, Ablonczy was elected to Parliament as the Reform Party candidate for the federal riding of Calgary North. In the following years, she continued to participate in Party affairs as a member of the Reform Party Strategy Committee. She also was a member of the Reform Party Expansion Committee, and she chaired the Reform Party Task Force on the Reform of Social Programs.

In 1998 and 1999, Ablonczy promoted the United Alternative process to create a new federal political party on the political right. As co-chair of the UA policy committee, she took part in developing a comprehensive draft policy document and guiding it through a series of public consultations across the country. The resulting Declaration of Policy was approved as official Party Policy by members at the Founding Convention of the Canadian Alliance on March 25, 2000. The Reform Party was dissolved, and the Canadian Alliance was created. Ablonczy was re-elected under the new party&#x27;s banner in the 2000 federal election.

In December 2001, Ablonczy entered the 2002 Canadian Alliance leadership contest on a platform of promoting &quot;a process to combine the Canadian Alliance, the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, and other interested partners into an effective, unified opposition party before the next election.&quot; She placed third with 3.8% of the vote. In late 2003, the Progressive Conservative Party merged with the Canadian Alliance to create the new Conservative Party of Canada.

On November 18, 2002, Ablonczy posed a question in the House of Commons concerning the government&#x27;s system of &quot;screening and security checks&quot; as related to Maher Arar, a dual Canadian and Syrian citizen who had recently been deported from the United States to Syria as a terror suspect. Based on newly released information Ablonczy asked what the government &quot;is doing to protect Canadian security&quot; and why &quot;the U.S. could uncover this man&#x27;s background so quickly&quot; when the Canadian government failed to find what she described as &quot;his al-Qaeda links&quot;. Ablonczy also criticized the Chrétien government for &quot;chastising the U.S. for sending Arar back to Syria where he is also a citizen&quot;. Arar was imprisoned for over a year in Syria and was repeatedly tortured by Syrian authorities. The RCMP later confirmed that Arar has no ties to any terrorist organizations.

On July 6, 2009, Conservative Member of Parliament Brad Trost indicated that several Conservative parliamentarians were surprised by Ablonczy&#x27;s decision to provide funding for the Toronto Pride Week Festival. Ablonczy later lost authority over such funding projects to another cabinet minister. This was denied by government spokesman Darren Cunningham, as reported in the national media.

In a cabinet shuffle on January 19, 2010, Diane Ablonczy changed portfolios to become the Minister of State for Seniors. The move was widely seen as a demotion in response to her decision to provide funding to the Toronto Pride Week Festival; a move which resulted in backlash among some of her supporters.

On January 4, 2011, she received a promotion to Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Americas and Consular Affairs).

On July 4, 2013, Ablonczy announced her retirement from parliament at the next election.

In 2015, Ablonczy opposed amendments to Bill C-51 proposed by the Green Party that called for consideration for &quot;rule of law&quot; and &quot;principles of fundamental justice&quot;, by using air quotes when saying those two legal principles and because &quot;action would be pretty much at a stalemate.&quot;

<text>William Peter Adams, (17 April 1936 – 28 September 2018), commonly known as Peter Adams, was a Canadian politician from Ontario. He was a Liberal member of Canada&#x27;s House of Commons from 1993 to 2006 representing the riding of Peterborough. Previously, Adams represented the provincial riding of Peterborough in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1987 to 1990, sitting as a member of the Ontario Liberal Party.

==Background==
Adams was born in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom and educated at the University of Sheffield and McGill University. He served as director of the subarctic research laboratory in Schefferville, Quebec, and was a member of the Geography department and coordinator of Northern Studies at Trent University in Peterborough, where he was later Emeritus Professor. Adams also served as Vice President – Academic while at Trent. Adams has authored many books and articles, and co-edited the regional history &quot;Peterborough and the Kawarthas&quot;. In 1981, he was named as Peterborough&#x27;s Citizen of the Year.

==Provincial politics==
In 1977, Adams ran as the Liberal candidate in the 1977 provincial election, but finished third against Progressive Conservative John Turner and incumbent New Democrat Gill Sandeman. He ran again in the 1981 provincial election, and finished second against Turner.

Adams ran for the seat again in the 1987 provincial election, and won by a comfortable majority amid a landslide provincial victory for the Liberal Party. He served as a backbench supporter of David Peterson and was appointed as parliamentary assistant to Minister of the Environment Jim Bradley from 1989 to 1990.

The Liberals were defeated by the New Democratic Party in the 1990 provincial election, and Adams lost his seat to NDP candidate Jenny Carter by 185 votes.

==Federal politics==
Adams was elected to the Canadian House of Commons in the federal election of 1993, defeating Progressive Conservative incumbent Bill Domm by almost 16,000 votes. He was re-elected in the elections of 1997, 2000, and 2004, each time by a comfortable margin.

He was for many years a prominent supporter of Jean Chrétien, opposing Paul Martin&#x27;s bid to succeed Chrétien as party leader. Adams was appointed by Martin as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development and Minister responsible for Democratic Renewal on 20 July 2004. He did not stand for re-election in the 2006 federal election.

In 2012 he was made a member of the Order of Ontario.

<doc id="343585" wikidata="Q43060" url="?curid=343585" title="Digital music store">
<text>A digital music store is a business that sells digital audio files of music recordings over the Internet. Customers gain ownership of a license to use the files, in contrast to a music streaming service, where they listen to recordings without gaining ownership. Customers pay either for each recording or on a subscription basis. Online music stores generally also offer partial streaming previews of songs, with some songs even available for full length listening. They typically show a picture of the album art or of the performer or band for each song. Some online music stores also sell recorded speech files, such as podcasts, and video files of movies.

==History==
===Early years===
The first free, high-fidelity online music archive of downloadable songs on the Internet was the Internet Underground Music Archive (IUMA), which was started by Rob Lord, Jeff Patterson and Jon Luini from the University of California, Santa Cruz in 1993. Sony Music Entertainment Japan launched the first digital music store in Japan on 20 December 1999, entitled Bitmusic, which initially focused on A-sides of singles released by Japanese domestic musicians.

The realization of the market for downloadable music grew widespread with the development of Napster, a music and file sharing service created by Shawn Fanning that made a major impact on the Internet scene in 2000. Some services have &quot;tethered&quot; downloads, meaning that playing songs requires an active membership. Napster was founded as a pioneering peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing Internet service that emphasized sharing audio files, typically music, encoded in MP3 format. The original company ran into legal difficulties over copyright infringement, ceased operations and was eventually acquired by Roxio. In its second incarnation Napster became an online music store until Rhapsody acquired it from Best Buy on 1 December 2011. Later companies and projects successfully followed its P2P file sharing example such as Gnutella, Freenet, Kazaa, Bearshare, and many others. Some services, like LimeWire, Scour, Grokster, Madster, and eDonkey2000, were brought down or changed due to similar circumstances.

In 2000, Factory Records entrepreneur Tony Wilson and his business partners launched an early online music store, Music33, which sold MP3s for 33 pence per song.

The major record labels eventually decided to launch their own online stores, allowing them more direct control over costs and pricing and more control over the presentation and packaging of songs and albums. Sony Music Entertainment&#x27;s service did not do as well as was hoped. Many consumers felt the service was difficult to navigate and use. Sony&#x27;s pricing of US$3.50 per song track also discouraged many early adopters of the service. Furthermore, as &quot;MP3 Newswire&quot; pointed out in its review of the service, users were actually only renting the tracks for that $3.50, because the patron did not own the audio file. After a certain point the files expired and could not be played again without repurchase. The service quickly failed.

Undaunted, the record industry tried again. Universal Music Group and Sony Music Entertainment teamed up with a service called Duet, later renamed pressplay. EMI, AOL/Time Warner and Bertelsmann Music Group teamed up with MusicNet. Again, both services struggled, hampered by high prices and heavy limitations on how downloaded files could be used once paid for. In the end, consumers chose instead to download music using illegal, free file sharing programs, which many consumers felt were more convenient and easier to use.

Non-major label services like eMusic, Cductive and Listen.com (now Rhapsody) sold the music of independent labels and artists. The demand for digital audio downloading skyrocketed after the launch of Apple&#x27;s iTunes Store (then called iTunes Music Store) in April 2003 and the creation of portable music and digital audio players such as the iPod. These players enabled music fans to carry their music with them, wherever they went.

Amazon launched its Amazon MP3 service for the US in September 2007, expanding it gradually to most countries where Amazon operates.

===Rise===

An increasing number of new services appeared in the 2000s that enabled musicians to sell their music directly to fans without an intermediary. These type of services usually use e-commerce-enabled web widgets that embed into many types of web pages. This turns each web page into the musician&#x27;s own online music store. Furthermore, there had been a boom in &quot;boutique&quot; music stores that cater to specific audiences.

On October 10, 2007, English rock band Radiohead released the album &quot;In Rainbows&quot; as a download. Listeners were allowed to purchase the album for whatever price they wanted to pay, legally allowing them to download the album for free. About one-third of people who downloaded the album paid nothing, with the average price paid being £4. After three months online the album was taken down by the band and released on compact disc (CD). , the largest online music store was the iTunes Store, with around 80% of the market. On 3 April 2008, the iTunes Store surpassed Wal-Mart as the biggest music retailer in the United States, a milestone in the music industry as it was the first time in history that an online music retailer exceeded those of physical music formats (e.g., record shops selling CDs).

In the early 2010s, online music stores—especially iTunes—experienced a marked increase in sales. Consumer spending shifted away from the purchase of CDs in favor of purchasing albums from online music stores, or more commonly, purchasing individual songs. The iTunes platform has been the main reason for this shift, as it originally sold every song in its library for 99 cents. Historically, albums would be sold for about five times the cost of a single, but iTunes was selling every song for a tenth of the price of an album. However, in order to increase album sales, iTunes instituted &quot;Complete My Album&quot;, which offered a discounted price on the full album when a consumer had already purchased one or more songs. Furthermore, with the rising popularity of Cyber Monday, online music stores have further gained ground over other music distribution sources.

iTunes rolled out an Instant Gratification (instant grat) service, in which some individual tracks or bonus tracks were made available to customers who have pre-ordered albums. The instant-grat tracks have changed the criteria for the UK Official Charts&#x27;s singles. In 2013, David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Where Are We Now?&quot; was not allowed to chart because it was a pre-order for the album &quot;The Next Day&quot;, but Official Charts later ruled that effective February 10, 2013, certain instant grats could be allowed to appear in the Top 40. Instant grats have also been offered on other online music stores including Amazon and Spotify.

==Compared to file sharing==

Much controversy surrounds file sharing, so many of these points are disputed.

===Advantages of legal online stores===
* The sale of licensed content adheres to copyright laws
* More consistent and higher-quality metadata, because the entering of the metadata is more centralized and done with more oversight.
* Music download companies are more accountable to users than creators of file-sharing programs
* A centralized repository of music makes it easier to find the songs you want.
* Notably, Apple Computer CEO Steve Jobs claimed in his introduction of the iTunes Store that downloading from file-sharers is theoretically working for less than minimum wage - &quot;By spending an hour of your time to save less than four dollars, he calculated, &#x27;you&#x27;re working for less than minimum wage!&#x27;&quot;.

===Disadvantages of online stores===
* Many major online music stores only offer music in one audio format. 
* Most online music stores sell music encoded in a lossy file format, compared to an audio CD. For the most part, music that is sold in lossy MP3 format is not sold at higher bit rate encoding.
* Few online music stores offer music in lossless, metadata-enabled formats such as FLAC or ALAC, but instead stick to WAV files in which no metadata can generally be embedded. AIFF files with metadata are offered but in larger size files than FLAC or ALAC without advantage in sound quality. In contrast, lossless rips of CDs in FLAC format are widely available on the web for illegal downloading.
* Some stores use digital rights management technology, which limits the use of music files on certain devices. The restrictions vary between different services, and sometimes even between different songs from the same service.
*Online stores charge for downloading songs and other content, whereas illegal file sharing does not have any fees (although illegal song downloaders may face fines and prosecution in some jurisdictions and illegal files may contain computer viruses)

==Internet radio==
Online music stores receive competition from online radio, as well as file sharing. Online radio is the free distribution of webcasts on the Internet via streaming. Listeners can create customizable &quot;stations&quot; based on a genre, artists, or song of their choice. Notable Internet Radio service providers are Pandora, Last FM and recently Spotify, with Pandora being the largest. Pandora holds 52% of the market share in Internet radio, with over 53 million registered users and almost one billion stations from which users can choose.

<doc id="343586" wikidata="Q5246944" url="?curid=343586" title="Dear World">
<text>Dear World is a musical with music and lyrics by Jerry Herman and book by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee. With its opening, Herman became the first composer-lyricist in history to have three productions running simultaneously on Broadway. It starred Angela Lansbury, who won the Tony Award for Leading Actress in a Musical in 1969 for her performance as the Countess Aurelia. 

Based on &quot;The Madwoman of Chaillot&quot; by French dramatist Jean Giraudoux, as adapted by Maurice Valency, the plot follows the eccentric Countess Aurelia and her struggles against the straitlaced authority figures in her life. She and her Chaillot cohort defend their Parisian neighborhood against scheming and corrupt developers. The forces of idealism, love, and poetry win over those of greed, materialism, and science.

==Productions and background==
The musical had a notably troubled preview period that included multiple changes to the script and score. Lucia Victor, Gower Champion&#x27;s assistant and a director of several revivals, including &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;, was hired as director, but resigned shortly thereafter, due to &quot;artistic differences&quot; with the musical&#x27;s star, Angela Lansbury, and the authors, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Peter Glenville was then hired, but resigned following negative reviews during tryouts in Boston, Massachusetts. Producer Alexander H. Cohen stated (in an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; of November 19, 1968) that &quot;there was no friction between Mr. Glenville and Miss Lansbury, the composer, the authors or the producer... an advance arrangement had been made with Mr. Glenville to direct the show through last week only.&quot; The show&#x27;s final director, Joe Layton, was then hired, also replacing the choreographer Donald Saddler.

The musical opened on Broadway at the Mark Hellinger Theatre on February 6, 1969 and closed on May 31, 1969 after 132 performances and 45 previews. In addition to direction and choreography by Joe Layton, scenic design was by Oliver Smith, costume design was by Freddy Wittop and lighting design was by Jean Rosenthal.

===Subsequent productions===
Originally conceived as a chamber musical, &quot;Dear World&quot; fell victim to a massive production that effectively overwhelmed the simplicity of the original tale. After the Broadway closing, Herman, Lawrence, and Lee rewrote the show, &quot;putting back the intimacy that had been undermined on Broadway.&quot;

A revised version was produced at Goodspeed Musicals (Connecticut) in November–December 2000, with Sally Ann Howes as Aurelia. This version had a revised book by David Thompson plus three songs written after the musical closed. A concert version was staged by 42nd Street Moon in San Francisco, September 6–24, 2000. This production used the revision by Herman, Lawrence and Lee.

A further revised version was produced at the Sundance Theatre (Utah) from June to August 2002 with Maureen McGovern playing Aurelia. This is the version currently available for licensing. Thompson revised his previous revision of the book and the score was reshuffled with some new or previously cut songs included. &quot;A Sensible Woman,&quot; about how the &quot;madwoman&quot; feels one&#x27;s life should be led, opens the show (as it did at the Goodspeed). &quot;One Person,&quot; cut at Goodspeed, is back in, ending Act One. The title song is sung by the three madwomen, as a kind of lullaby that leads into &quot;One Person.&quot; The song called &quot;Through the Bottom of the Glass&quot; that opened the original production does not appear in the revised show, and the song &quot;Have a Little Pity on the Rich,&quot; sung by the Sewerman during Broadway previews but cut before opening night, has been restored. The original 26-person Philip J. Lang orchestrations (26 was the minimum for the Mark Hellinger Theatre in 1969) have been distilled for a chamber ensemble with 8 players.

The Canadian premiere of this revised version was presented by the Toronto Civic Light Opera Company in May 2012. Directed by Joe Cascone, the production starred Barbara Boddy as Aurelia, David Haines as the Sewerman and featured Elizabeth Rose Morriss and Daniel Cornthwaite as the young lovers.

The musical had its UK premiere at London&#x27;s Charing Cross Theatre from February 4 through March 16, 2013. The production was directed and choreographed by Gillian Lynne and starred Betty Buckley as Aurelia, Paul Nicholas as Sewerman and Stuart Matthew Price as Julian. Set design was by Matt Kinley, costumes by Ann Hould-Ward, lighting by Mike Robertson, musical direction by Ian Townsend, sound by Mike Walker, and orchestrations were by Sarah Travis.

The York Theatre Company (New York City) presented the musical from February 25 to March 5, 2017, starring Tyne Daly as Countess Aurelia. Daly had previously starred in a concert version of &quot;Dear World&quot; at the Valley Performing Arts Center in Los Angeles on September 30, 2016. The concert featured Steven Weber as the Sewerman and Vicki Lewis and Bets Malone as Aurelia&#x27;s friends.

New York City Center Encores! presented a staged concert from March 15 to March 19, 2023 directed by Josh Rhodes using the original full orchestrations. The production starred Donna Murphy as Countess Aurelia.

==Plot==
A corporation has discovered oil under the streets of Paris, directly under a bistro. The Countess Aurelia (known as &quot;The Madwoman of Chaillot&quot;) lives in the bistro&#x27;s basement, driven mad because of a lost lover and reminiscing about her past. When the corporation decides to blow up the bistro to get the oil, a young executive, Julian, helps to foil the plan because he has fallen in love with Nina, the bistro&#x27;s waitress. Aurelia lures the corporation executives to the underground in the sewer system.

==Awards and nominations==

===Original Broadway production===
==Critical response==
The show received mostly negative reviews. &quot;Time&quot; magazine called the songs &quot;a total zero,&quot; while Martin Gottfried, noting that the plot line had been cut to ribbons, found &quot;the story impossible to follow.&quot;

Walter Kerr wrote that the musical &quot;is in the main quite charming...the actress [Lansbury]...is endearing throughout the evening and at her commanding best here.&quot; Her song &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Know&quot; is &quot;a song surprised by its own unexpected passion. The effect doesn&#x27;t always work out for composer Jerry Herman...&#x27;Dear World&#x27; is attractive when it is staying close to its addled Good People...it is in trouble whenever it turns to the Bad People...Oliver Smith&#x27;s settings are perfect.&quot;
Clive Barnes in &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave Lansbury a positive review: &quot;The minor miracle is Miss Lansbury...no connoisseur of musical comedy can afford to miss Miss Lansbury&#x27;s performance. It is lovely.&quot;

According to Steven Citron, &quot;[Sally Ann] Howes and the majority of critics now believe that with a rewritten libretto it could be turned into a successful musical.&quot;

<text>Emperor Ling of Han (156/157 – 13 May 189), personal name Liu Hong, was the 12th emperor of the Eastern Han dynasty. He was also the last Eastern Han emperor to exercise effective power during his reign. Born the son of a lesser marquis who descended directly from Emperor Zhang (the third Eastern Han emperor), Liu Hong was chosen to be emperor in February 168 around age 12 after the death of his predecessor, Emperor Huan, who had no son to succeed him. He reigned for about 21 years until his death in May 189.

Emperor Ling&#x27;s reign saw another repetition of corrupt eunuchs dominating the eastern Han central government, as was the case during his predecessor&#x27;s reign. Zhang Rang, the leader of the eunuch faction (十常侍), managed to dominate the political scene after defeating a faction led by Empress Dowager Dou&#x27;s father, Dou Wu, and the Confucian scholar-official Chen Fan in October 168. After reaching adulthood, Emperor Ling was not interested in state affairs and preferred to indulge in women and a decadent lifestyle. At the same time, corrupt officials in the Han government levied heavy taxes on the peasants. He exacerbated the situation by introducing a practice of selling political offices for money; this practice severely damaged the Han civil service system and led to widespread corruption. Mounting grievances against the Han government led to the outbreak of the peasant-led Yellow Turban Rebellion in early 184.

Emperor Ling&#x27;s reign left the Eastern Han dynasty weak and on the verge of collapse. After his death, the Han Empire disintegrated in chaos for the subsequent decades as various regional warlords fought for power and dominance. (See End of the Han dynasty.) The Han dynasty ended in late 220 when Emperor Ling&#x27;s son, Emperor Xian, abdicated his throne – an event leading to the start of the Three Kingdoms period in China.

== Family background and accession to the throne ==
Liu Hong was a hereditary marquis – the Marquis of Jiedu Village (). In the Han dynasty, a village marquis&#x27;s marquisate usually comprised only one village or, in rarer cases, two or three villages. He was the third person in his family to hold this title; his father Liu Chang () and grandfather Liu Shu () were also formerly Marquis of Jiedu Village. His great-grandfather, Liu Kai (), Prince Xiao of Hejian (), was the sixth son of Emperor Zhang, the third emperor of the Eastern Han dynasty. His mother, Lady Dong, was Liu Chang&#x27;s formal spouse.

When Emperor Huan died on 25 January 168 without a son to succeed him, his empress, Empress Dou, became empress dowager, and she examined the genealogy of the imperial clan to choose a candidate to be the next emperor. For reasons unknown, her assistant Liu Shu () recommended Liu Hong, the Marquis of Jiedu Village. After consulting with her father Dou Wu and the Confucian scholar-official Chen Fan, Empress Dowager Dou installed a 12-year-old Liu Hong on the throne on 17 February 168, and continued ruling on his behalf as regent. The newly enthroned Emperor Ling bestowed posthumous titles on his grandfather, father and grandmother, honouring them as emperors and an empress respectively. His mother, Lady Dong, did not become empress dowager and instead received the title of an Honoured Lady.

== Early reign ==
Dou Wu and Chen Fan, who became the most important officials in the central government, sought to purge the eunuch faction. Later in 168, they even proposed to exterminate all the powerful eunuchs, a proposal that Empress Dowager Dou rejected. However, word of the plot was leaked, and the eunuchs, after kidnapping the empress dowager and taking the young emperor into custody (after persuading him that it was for his own protection) arrested and executed Chen Fan. Dou Wu resisted but was eventually defeated and forced to commit suicide. The Dou clan was slaughtered. The powerful eunuchs, led by Cao Jie () and Wang Fu (), became the most powerful individuals in the central government.

After the destruction of the Dou clan, in 169, Emperor Ling promoted his mother to the position of empress dowager, though he continued honouring Empress Dowager Dou, now under house arrest, as empress dowager as well. Members of the Dong clan began to enter government, but did not have substantial influence. Later that year, the eunuchs persuaded Emperor Ling that the &quot;partisans&quot; (i.e., Confucian officials and those who supported them) were plotting against him, and a large number of partisans were arrested and killed; the others had their civil liberties stripped completely, in an event historically known as the second Disaster of Partisan Prohibitions.

Empress Dowager Dou died in 172. Despite suggestions by eunuchs to have her only buried as an imperial consort and not be honoured as Emperor Huan&#x27;s wife, Emperor Ling had her buried with full honours befitting an empress dowager in Emperor Huan&#x27;s mausoleum. In the aftermaths of her death, a vandal wrote on the palace gate: &quot;All that is under the heaven is in upheaval. Cao and Wang murdered the empress dowager. The key officials only know how to be officials and had nothing faithful to say.&quot;

The angry eunuchs ordered an investigation which led to over 1,000 arrests, but nothing conclusive was found. In that year, the eunuchs also falsely accused Emperor Huan&#x27;s brother, Liu Kui (), the Prince of Bohai, of treason and forced him to commit suicide. The members of his entire household, including his wife, concubines, children, assistants and principality officials, were all rounded up and executed. As the Han government became more corrupt, the people received heavier tax burdens. As Emperor Ling grew older, he not only took no remedial action, but continued to tolerate the eunuchs&#x27; corruption for the most part. A major defeat of the Han army by the Xianbei tribes in 177 further drained the imperial treasury.

In 178, Emperor Ling&#x27;s wife Empress Song, whom he made empress in 171 but did not favour, fell victim to the eunuchs&#x27; treachery. Her aunt, Lady Song, was Liu Kui&#x27;s wife, so the eunuchs were worried that she would seek vengeance on them. Thus, by collaborating with other imperial consorts who wanted to replace the empress, the eunuchs falsely accused Empress Song of using witchcraft to curse Emperor Ling. The emperor believed them and deposed the empress, who was imprisoned and died in despair. Her father, Song Feng (), and the rest of her family were exterminated.

== Middle reign ==
In 178, Emperor Ling introduced the practice of selling political offices for money – a practice which severely damaged the Han civil service system (chajuzhi, Chinese: 察举) and led to widespread corruption. The people who paid for these positions perpetuated corruption upon taking office. That was exactly what Emperor Ling had in mind: he allowed the officials to pay by instalments after taking office if they could not afford the initial amount.

In January 181, Emperor Ling instated Lady He as the new empress and appointed her brother, He Jin, as a key official in his government. (According to legends, she managed to enter Emperor Ling&#x27;s imperial harem because her family bribed the eunuchs in charge of selecting women for the emperor.) She received the position of empress because she bore Emperor Ling a son, Liu Bian; the emperor had other sons but they died prematurely before Liu Bian&#x27;s birth.

During these years, Emperor Ling became interested in building imperial gardens so he ordered the commandery and principality officials throughout the Han Empire to pay their tributes to him directly, so he could use the money to finance his construction projects. This, in turn, created pressures on the officials to resort to corrupt practices so they could extract a larger tribute from their jurisdictions for the emperor. In spite of all his flaws, Emperor Ling occasionally heeded good advice from his subjects but was not consistent in doing so. His subjects often found it frustrating to try to convince him on policy issues because he only listened to them when he wanted to.

== The Yellow Turban Rebellion ==

Sometime before 183, a major Taoist rebel movement had started in Ji Province – the Taiping Sect (), led by Zhang Jiao, who claimed he had magical powers to heal the sick. By 183, his teachings and followers had spread to eight of the empire&#x27;s thirteen provinces – Ji, Qing, Xu, You, Jing, Yang, Yan, and Yu. Several key imperial officials became concerned about Zhang Jiao&#x27;s hold over his followers, and suggested that the Taiping Sect be disbanded. Emperor Ling did not listen to them.

Zhang Jiao had in fact planned a rebellion. He commissioned 36 military commanders, set up a shadow government, and wrote a declaration: &quot;The Azure sky has perished; behold, the Yellow sky will soon rise. When the year is &quot;jiazi&quot;, there will be prosperity under Heaven!&quot; (Under the traditional Chinese sexagenary cycle calendar method, 184 would be the first year of the cycle, known as &quot;jiazi&quot;.) Zhang Jiao had his supporters write &quot;jiazi&quot; in large characters with white talc everywhere they could – including on the doors of government offices in the imperial capital and other cities. One of Zhang Jiao&#x27;s followers, Ma Yuanyi (), plotted with two eunuchs to start an uprising inside the palace.

Early in 184, this plot was discovered, and Ma Yuanyi was immediately arrested and executed. Emperor Ling ordered that Taiping Sect members be arrested and executed, and Zhang Jiao immediately declared a rebellion. Every member of the rebellion wore a yellow turban or headscarf as their symbol – and therefore the rebellion became known for it. Within a month, Zhang Jiao controlled large areas of territory. Under suggestion by the eunuch Lü Qiang (), who was sympathetic to the partisans, Emperor Ling pardoned the partisans to ward off the possibility they would join the Yellow Turbans. (Lü Qiang himself became a victim, however, when the other eunuchs, in retaliation, falsely accused him of wanting to depose the emperor, and he committed suicide later that year.)

Emperor Ling sent out a number of military commanders against the Yellow Turbans, and in these campaigns several of them distinguished themselves –
including Huangfu Song, Cao Cao, Fu Xie (), Zhu Jun, Lu Zhi, and Dong Zhuo. A key military development with great implications later was that the Yellow Turbans fought mainly with troops deployed from the battle-tested Liang Province who had been accustomed to suppressing rebellions by the Qiang tribes. In late 184, Zhang Jiao was killed, and while the rest of the Yellow Turbans were not defeated immediately, they gradually dissipated by the following year (although several of the minor rebellions would not be put down until 205 AD). Because of the Liang Province forces&#x27; contributions to the campaign, they began to be feared and began to look down on troops from all other provinces. During and in the aftermaths of the Yellow Turban Rebellion, many people from other provinces, in order to ward off pillaging by Yellow Turbans or governmental forces, also organised themselves into military groups, and a good number resisted government forces, and even after the Yellow Turbans were defeated, the central government&#x27;s control of the provinces was no longer what it used to be.

== Late reign ==
Even after the Yellow Turban Rebellion was suppressed, Emperor Ling did not change his wasteful and corrupt ways. He continued to levy heavy taxes and continued to sell offices. As a result, other agrarian and military rebellions multiplied. In 185, when a fire broke out in the southern part of the imperial palace, the Ten Attendants suggested to Emperor Ling to levy a tax of ten maces from every &quot;mu&quot; of farmland to raise funds for rebuilding the palace. Emperor Ling then ordered the officials in Taiyuan (), Hedong () and Didao () commanderies to transport wood and patterned rocks to Luoyang (the imperial capital) as construction materials. When the shipments reached the palace, the eunuchs who received them scolded the labourers for delivering materials of poor quality, and insisted on paying them far below market prices – to as low as a tenth of the market price. They then resold the materials to other eunuchs, who refused to buy. Over time, the accumulated piles of wood started decaying. The construction works were thus delayed for years. In order to please Emperor Ling, some regional officials levied heavier taxes and forced the people to produce greater quantities of construction materials – this led to greater resentment from the common people.

Emperor Ling appointed cavalry officers to serve as his messengers whenever he issued orders for things to be delivered to Luoyang. These officers, known as &quot;zhongshi&quot; (中使; &quot;central emissaries&quot;), abused their power by forcing the regional officials, who were afraid of them, to give them bribes. The appointment of officials below the position of Inspector () was decided by the amount of money they could pay to fund the army and palace construction. Before assuming office, these officials had to undergo an assessment to determine their &quot;value&quot;. Some who could not afford the required amount committed suicide, while others who refused to take up their appointments were forced into accepting.

Around the time, there was one Sima Zhi (), who had been newly appointed as the Administrator () of Julu Commandery (). As he had a reputation for being an honest official, he was required to pay less – three million maces. Upon receiving the order, he lamented, &quot;I should be like a parent to the common people, but I have been forced to exploit them to satisfy (the Emperor&#x27;s) needs. I can&#x27;t bear to do this.&quot; He attempted to resign, claiming that he was ill, but his request was denied. When he reached Meng Ford () near Luoyang, he wrote a memorial to point out all the problems with the government and cite historical examples to warn the emperor. He then committed suicide by consuming poison. After reading Sima Zhi&#x27;s memorial, Emperor Ling temporarily stopped collecting funds for rebuilding the palace, but quickly resumed his construction projects later. He built a hall within the western gardens and filled it with treasures and silk taken from the agriculture department. He also visited his birthplace in Hejian Commandery, where he acquired land and used it to build mansions and towers. As Emperor Ling came from a relatively poor background as a lesser marquis, he had a strong desire to accumulate as much personal wealth as possible – especially after he saw that his predecessor, Emperor Huan, did not leave behind a large family fortune for him. He drew his wealth not just from the imperial treasuries, but also from the low-ranking eunuchs who attended to him.

Emperor Ling often said, &quot;Regular Attendant Zhang (Rang) is my father, Regular Attendant Zhao (Zhong) is my mother.&quot; As the eunuchs were highly trusted and favoured by Emperor Ling, they behaved lawlessly and abused their power. They even built lavish mansions for themselves in the same design as the imperial palace. When Emperor Ling once visited Yong&#x27;anhou Platform (), a high viewing platform, the eunuchs were worried that he would see their mansions and become suspicious. Thus, they told him, &quot;Your Majesty shouldn&#x27;t put yourself on higher ground. If you do so, the people will scatter.&quot; The emperor believed them and stopped visiting high towers and viewing platforms.

In 186, Emperor Ling tasked the eunuchs Song Dian () and Bi Lan () with overseeing new construction projects, including a new palace hall, four large bronze statues, four giant bronze bells and water-spouting animal sculptures, among others. He also ordered coins to be minted and widely circulated. Many people perceived this to be a display of the emperor&#x27;s extravagance, and pointed to signs showing that the coins will eventually scatter everywhere. This turned out to be true when chaos broke out in Luoyang after Emperor Ling&#x27;s death. Emperor Ling appointed Zhao Zhong as &quot;General of Chariots of Cavalry&quot; () but removed him from office after some 100 days.

In 188, under the suggestions of Liu Yan, Emperor Ling greatly increased the political and military power of the provincial governors and selected key officials to serve as provincial governors.

In 189, as Emperor Ling became critically ill, a succession issue came into being. Emperor Ling had two surviving sons – Liu Bian, the son of Empress He, and Liu Xie, the son of Consort Wang. Because Emperor Ling had, earlier in his life, frequently lost sons in childhood, he later believed that his sons needed to be raised outside the palace by foster parents. Therefore, when Liu Bian was born, he was entrusted to Shi Zimiao (), a Taoist, and referred to &quot;Marquis Shi.&quot; Later, when Liu Xie was born, he was raised by Emperor Ling&#x27;s mother, Empress Dowager Dong, and was known as &quot;Marquis Dong.&quot; Liu Bian was born of the empress and was older, but Emperor Ling viewed his behaviour as being insufficiently solemn and therefore considered making Liu Xie crown prince, but hesitated and could not decide.

When Emperor Ling died later that year, a powerful eunuch whom he trusted, Jian Shuo, wanted to first kill Empress He&#x27;s brother, General-in-Chief He Jin, and then make Liu Xie emperor, and therefore set up a trap at a meeting he was to have with He Jin. He Jin found out, and peremptorily declared Liu Bian emperor.

<text>Reginald B. Alcock, (April 16, 1948 – October 14, 2011) was a Canadian politician. He represented the riding of Winnipeg South in the House of Commons of Canada from 1993 to 2006 and was a cabinet minister in the government of Prime Minister Paul Martin. Alcock was a member of the Liberal Party of Canada.

==Early life and career==
Alcock was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Simon Fraser University and a master&#x27;s degree in public administration from Harvard University. He was the director of Manitoba Child and Family Services from 1983 to 1985 and in this capacity spearheaded an effort to rewrite the province&#x27;s child protection legislation. As a result of his efforts, Manitoba became the first province in Canada to introduce official protocols to deal with instances of child sex abuse. Alcock was also active with the Harvard Policy Group, which studies the effects of information technology on the public sector. He began his political career at the provincial level, working as an organizer for the Manitoba Liberal Party in the early 1980s.

Alcock was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba for the Winnipeg division of Osborne in the 1988 provincial election, in which the Manitoba Liberal Party rose from one seat to twenty under the leadership of Sharon Carstairs. He later worked as campaign manager for high-profile Liberal incumbent Lloyd Axworthy in the 1988 federal election in Winnipeg South Centre. Alcock served as official opposition house leader and finance critic and was re-elected in the 1990 provincial election despite a shift against his party. He endorsed Jean Chrétien&#x27;s bid to lead the federal Liberal Party in 1990, and declared his own intention to enter federal politics in 1992.

Alcock won the Liberal nomination for Winnipeg South in early 1993, defeating rival candidate Linda Asper by only five votes on the third ballot of what proved to be a divisive contest. He won a convincing victory over incumbent Progressive Conservative incumbent Dorothy Dobbie in the 1993 federal election and entered the House as a government backbencher.

==Government backbencher==
Alcock soon developed a reputation as one of the most technologically savvy members of parliament. In 1994, he became the first MP to coordinate his parliamentary office from his riding electronically instead of relying on permanent staff in Ottawa. At around the same time, he became the first Canadian MP to host an official website. He was appointed to the House&#x27;s standing committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade in 1995, and was named chair of the standing committee on Transport in 1997.

The Chrétien government called a new federal election for June 2, 1997, only three and a half years into its five-year mandate. The election timing was controversial in Manitoba, as it coincided with significant flooding from the Red River into Winnipeg. Alcock, along with other Manitoba Liberal MPs, requested a delay until the flooding was under control. When Chrétien called the election anyway, Alcock transformed his campaign office into a volunteer relief centre. He was personally involved in sandbagging and evacuation efforts and did not actively campaign in the first period of the election. He was nonetheless returned by a significant margin. From 1998 to 2000, he served as parliamentary secretary to the President of the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. In 1998, he brought forward a private member&#x27;s bill to overturn Louis Riel&#x27;s conviction for high treason and recognize him as a Father of Confederation.

Alcock was never appointed to the Chrétien Cabinet. His professional relationship with Chrétien deteriorated after 2000, and in 2002 he became the primary Manitoba organizer for Paul Martin&#x27;s bid to replace Chrétien as party leader. In the same year, he became one of the first Liberal MPs to call openly for Chrétien&#x27;s resignation. Alcock increased his public profile in 2003, after chairing a committee which forced privacy commissioner George Radwanski to resign from office after revelations of lax spending habits.

==Cabinet minister==
When Paul Martin became Prime Minister of Canada on December 12, 2003, he appointed Alcock to cabinet as President of the Treasury Board, Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board, and political minister responsible for Manitoba. He was also named to the government&#x27;s priorities and planning committee, described as the &quot;inner circle&quot; of cabinet, and was appointed chair of a cabinet committee that conducted a comprehensive review of government spending.

===Policy===
As president of the Treasury Board, Alcock was responsible for overseeing the Canadian civil service and the spending details of government agencies. He also played a leading role in coordinating the Martin government&#x27;s response to the federal sponsorship scandal, in which some bureaucrats and advertising agents in Quebec with ties to the Liberal Party had misappropriated public monies. Alcock announced a new appointment process for Crown corporation executives in 2004, and the following year he issued a new policy of management control for government agencies. He argued that these reforms would prevent similar scandals from occurring in the future. One of his more notable initiatives was the establishment of a chief audit executive for each government department and agency.

In total, Alcock brought forward 158 separate reforms for the public service in late 2005, and promised that another eighty would follow. Critics considered this to be excessive and some suggested that Alcock was micro-managing his department.

Alcock also released a comprehensive proposal for reforming Canada&#x27;s regulatory system in March 2005. He argued that his reforms would reduce delays for patent drug approval and avoid the duplication of existing foreign research without compromising safety standards. Critics of the plan suggested that it could jeopardize Canadian sovereignty and lead to the adoption of American regulatory standards.

In February 2004, the &quot;National Post&quot; identified Alcock as a leading cabinet supporter of private-public partnerships.

===Other===
In early 2005, Alcock publicly criticized his government&#x27;s opposition to the legalization of marijuana, saying, &quot;If we actually wanted to break the back of organized crime, we would be better off to control it. When you have these things underground, what you end up fuelling is organized crime.&quot;

==2006 election==
Alcock unexpectedly lost his seat in the 2006 federal election, losing to Conservative challenger Rod Bruinooge by just 111 votes in Winnipeg South. Bruinooge had previously challenged Alcock in 2004. He took personal responsibility for the loss and acknowledged that he did not spend enough time campaigning in his own riding. Alcock also said that being the government&#x27;s point person for the sponsorship scandal did not help his electoral prospects, though he ultimately defended his government&#x27;s actions.

One of Alcock&#x27;s final acts in office was to approve a payment of up to $40,000 to assist Jean Pelletier with legal fees in a court challenge against the Gomery Commission. Representatives of other parties criticized this payment, saying that the government should only cover legal costs for working civil servants. Pelletier&#x27;s lawyer argued that it followed a long-standing government policy for high-ranking functionaries in judicial proceedings.

==Out of parliament==
In March 2006, Alcock announced that he would support Belinda Stronach if she entered the contest to succeed Paul Martin as Liberal leader. Stronach announced in early April that she would not be a candidate. Several of members of Alcock&#x27;s political organization later worked for Ken Dryden&#x27;s campaign, and Alcock himself endorsed Dryden at the leadership convention. Dryden dropped off after the second ballot and endorsed Bob Rae and then eventual winner Stéphane Dion.

In January 2007, Alcock was appointed to the faculty of the University of Manitoba as an executive in residence at the I. H. Asper School of Business. He was also appointed as a research affiliate with the Leadership Network at the Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University.

==Death==
Alcock died on October 14, 2011, after suffering an apparent heart attack at James Richardson International Airport in Winnipeg. He was 63 years old.

==Trivia==
*In September 2005, Alcock donated an original painting entitled, &quot;The view from my seat in the House of Commons, May 19, 6:10 p.m.&quot;, to a charity auction in Winnipeg. The work, a parody of Edvard Munch&#x27;s The Scream, depicted Alcock&#x27;s impression of the opposition Conservative caucus moments after the Liberals won a crucial confidence vote that could have forced early elections. Alcock acknowledged that the painting was mostly traced. It sold for $2,200.
*Alcock suffered weight-related health problems during his political career. Facing the prospect of severe diabetes, he reduced his weight from 430 pounds to 295 pounds in the mid-2000s.

<text>Margaret Joan Trudeau ( Sinclair, formerly Kemper; born September 10, 1948) is a Canadian activist and the mother of Justin Trudeau, the 23rd prime minister of Canada. She married Pierre Trudeau, the 15th prime minister of Canada, in 1971, three years after he became prime minister. They divorced in 1984, during his final months in office. She is also the mother of the journalist and author Alexandre &quot;Sacha&quot; Trudeau, and Michel Trudeau (now deceased) with Trudeau, and of son Kyle (born 1984), and daughter Alicia (born 1988), with Ottawa real-estate developer Fried Kemper. She is the first woman in Canadian history to have been both the wife and the mother of prime ministers. Trudeau is an advocate for people with bipolar disorder, with which she has been diagnosed.

==Early life==
Trudeau was born at West Vancouver General Hospital in West Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, the daughter of Scottish-born James &quot;Jimmy&quot; Sinclair, a former Liberal member of the Parliament of Canada and Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, and Doris Kathleen (Bernard) Sinclair. Her grandmother, Rose Edith (Ivens) Bernard, with whom she had an especially close relationship, lived in Roberts Creek, British Columbia, in later life, and was from Virden, Manitoba. Her grandfather, Thomas Kirkpatrick Bernard, was born in Makassar, Dutch Celebes, now in Sulawesi, Indonesia, and immigrated in 1906 at age 15 with his family to Penticton, British Columbia, eventually working as a payroll clerk for Canadian Pacific Railway.

The Bernards were the descendants of colonists in the Straits Settlements, the Dutch East Indies, and British Malaya, nowadays respectively Singapore, Indonesia, and Malaysia, including Francis James Bernard, a London, England-born Anglo-Irishman whose great-grandfather, Arthur Bernard, was a member of the Irish House of Commons for Bandonbridge, and brother of Francis Bernard, Solicitor-General for Ireland, and ancestor of the Earls of Bandon. Francis James Bernard was the founder of the Singapore Police Force in 1819, &quot;The Singapore Chronicle&quot;, the first newspaper in Singapore, was established with Bernard as owner, publisher, and editor in 1824 and he opened up Katong, now a densely populated-residential enclave, the first to cultivate a coconut estate there in 1823. In 1818, Bernard married Margaret Trudeau&#x27;s 3rd great-grandmother, Esther Farquhar. She was the eldest daughter of Scotsman William Farquhar, a colonial leader in the founding of modern Singapore, by Farquhar&#x27;s first wife, Antoinette &quot;Nonio&quot; Clement, who was the daughter of a French father and an ethnic Malaccan mother.

Another great-grandmother, Cornelia Louisa Intveld, married in 1822 to Royal Navy officer and merchant, William Purvis, from Dalgety Bay, Scotland, and a first cousin of American abolitionist Robert Purvis; she was a noted fine soprano and a beauty of her era. Upon glimpsing her across the auditorium at the opera in London, England, British King William IV sent his equerry to invite her to his box. After she refused, the King sent the equerry back just to ask her name. Intveld was born in Padang, present-day West Sumatra, Indonesia. At the time of Intveld&#x27;s birth, Padang was in the territory of the Pagaruyung Kingdom, where her father, who came from humble beginnings in Hellevoetsluis, South Holland, rose up through the Dutch East India Company to become the Dutch Resident of Padang. Her maternal grandmother was an Ono Niha &quot;ranee&quot; (a term covering every rank from chieftain&#x27;s daughter to princess) who married a prominent Dutch colonial official and merchant. Acclaimed British harpsichordist Violet Gordon-Woodhouse, and Hawaiian settler Edward William Purvis, according to popular belief, was the namesake of the ukulele, are Margaret Trudeau&#x27;s first cousins, three times removed. Trudeau explored her mother&#x27;s family&#x27;s roots in Singapore during an episode of &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;

Trudeau&#x27;s family moved to a large house in Rockcliffe Park, Ontario, in 1952 after her father was appointed to the Cabinet, and she attended Rockcliffe Park Public School although they returned to North Vancouver after he lost his re-election bid in 1958. She attended Hamilton Junior Secondary School and Delbrook Senior Secondary School in North Vancouver. Trudeau graduated in 1969 from Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British Columbia with a Bachelor of Arts in sociology.

==Marriage to Pierre Trudeau==
Sinclair met Pierre Trudeau, who was then Minister of Justice, while vacationing in Tahiti with her family when she was 18. Sinclair did not recognize him, and she in fact thought little of their encounter, but Trudeau, then 47, was captivated by the carefree &quot;flower child&quot; and began to pursue her.

Pierre Trudeau was a bachelor before he became Prime Minister in 1968. They kept their romance private, so Canadians were shocked after the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation led its morning radio broadcast about Prime Minister Trudeau honeymooning at Alta Lake, British Columbia, at the foot of Whistler Blackcomb Ski Resort the day after a surprise wedding in North Vancouver, British Columbia, on March 4, 1971. Although she had accompanied Pierre Trudeau in public a year before to ice skate and dance at an event at Rideau Hall, official residence of Canada&#x27;s Governor General, it was a complete secret except to immediate family members and close friends that she was in a romantic relationship, then in a six-month engagement to the Prime Minister.

As Pierre Trudeau was a Catholic, she converted to the Catholic Church for their marriage. When asked about her role in a marriage to the prime minister, Trudeau said, &quot;I want to be more than a rose in my husband&#x27;s lapel.&quot;

In 1971, the Trudeaus took a second honeymoon in the Caribbean to Barbados and an unidentified nearby island then Tobago, then to Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (including both Bequia and St. Vincent) with Pierre taking a side-trip to Trinidad while Margaret stayed in Tobago.

After Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s government&#x27;s near defeat in 1972 (Margaret herself was uninvolved in the campaign), she decided to become much more active for the 1974 federal election. At a rally in Vancouver, she told a crowd of 2,000 her husband taught her &quot;a lot about loving.&quot; The remark was wildly mocked and dismissed in public during the campaign by members of the press gallery as well as by her husband&#x27;s main political rivals Progressive Conservative Party of Canada leader Robert Stanfield and New Democratic Party leader David Lewis.

Liberal party organizers considered her a top campaign asset, and sent her off alone to help local candidates in hotly contested ridings while, as critics noted, the wives of Stanfield and Lewis were on the campaign trail but rarely spoke and stood behind their husbands at events. Political observers also found Pierre Trudeau noticeably more relaxed at events while Margaret came along. Initially, she brought her six-month-old son Sacha on the trail with her, and one veteran reporter said, &quot;It&#x27;s the first campaign plane for the first thing off is a crib and a diaper bag.&quot; Later, she left her sons with her parents in North Vancouver while campaigning. Asked at the time if she thought her campaigning was helping Pierre Trudeau pick up votes, she replied, &quot;I won&#x27;t know until July 8th. But 52 per cent of the voters in this country are women...an awful lot ...&quot; Her husband&#x27;s party returned to a majority-government.

&quot;From the day I became Mrs. Pierre Elliott Trudeau,&quot; she writes in her memoirs, &quot;a glass panel was gently lowered into place around me, like a patient in a mental hospital no longer considered able to make decisions and cannot be exposed to a harsh light.&quot; The couple had three children: Justin (born December 25, 1971), Alexandre (Sacha) (born December 25, 1973), and Michel (October 2, 1975 – November 13, 1998).

Trudeau tore apart a quilt made by Canadian conceptual artist Joyce Wieland on the wall in the prime-minister&#x27;s official residence in Ottawa because it celebrated &quot;reason over passion&quot;. (Her husband&#x27;s personal motto was &quot;Reason before passion&quot;.)

Over time, the marriage disintegrated to the point where, as recounted in her 1982 book &quot;Consequences&quot;, Trudeau had affairs with Jack Nicholson, Ryan O&#x27;Neal, Lou Rawls, and a friendship with US Senator Ted Kennedy. She was also associated with members of the Rolling Stones, including Ronnie Wood and, according to Keith Richards&#x27; autobiography, &quot;Life&quot;, Mick Jagger.

She separated from her husband in 1977. Pierre Trudeau won custody of the children and did not pay spousal support. Margaret Trudeau had a difficult time earning a living after her marriage. She wrote the 1979 book &quot;Beyond Reason&quot; about her marriage.

On the eve of the 1979 election, in which Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s party lost the majority of seats in the House of Commons, she was dancing at Studio 54 nightclub in New York City. A photo of her at the disco was featured on many front pages across Canada.

==Divorce and second marriage==
Margaret Trudeau filed for a no-fault divorce at the Ontario Supreme Court on November 16, 1983, which was finalized on April 2, 1984. On April 18, 1984, with her three sons attending, she married Ottawa real-estate developer Fried Kemper in a civil ceremony in the chambers of Judge Hugh Poulin. She had two children with him: son Kyle (born 1984), and daughter Alicia (born 1988).

==Later life==
In November 1998, the Trudeaus&#x27; youngest son, Michel, an avid outdoorsman, was killed when an avalanche swept him to the bottom of British Columbia&#x27;s Kokanee Lake. The loss of her son was devastating.

When Pierre Trudeau died in 2000, Margaret was at his bedside with their surviving sons Justin and Alexandre. Speaking in 2010 about her marriage to Trudeau, she said: &quot;Just because our marriage ended didn&#x27;t mean the love stopped.&quot;

On October 19, 2015, her eldest son, Justin Trudeau, led the Liberal Party to a majority government, becoming the 23rd Prime Minister of Canada. During the campaign, she was involved, but avoided campaigning in public as the Conservative campaign&#x27;s main attack line against Justin was &quot;Just Not Ready&quot; and she feared they would suggest her son was &quot;so unready he needs his mummy.&quot;

On April 27, 2020, Trudeau was hospitalized with smoke inhalation after a fire broke out in her apartment building.

==Work, advocacy and writing==

From 2002 to 2017, Trudeau was the honorary president of WaterAid Canada, an Ottawa-based organization dedicated to helping the poorest communities in developing countries build sustainable water supply and sanitation services. In 2014, she visited Mali as an ambassador of WaterAid Canada.

On May 5, 2006, Trudeau announced she has bipolar disorder. Since then, she advocated for reducing the social-stigma of mental illness—bipolar disorder in particular—with speaking engagements across North America. In May 2019, she presented the one-woman-show &quot;Certain Woman of an Age&quot; in Chicago as part of the city&#x27;s &quot;Wellness Week&quot;. She is an honorary patron of the Canadian Mental Health Association. In July 2019, she attended an opening ceremony of WE College in Narok County (Kenya) with former Prime Minister of Canada Kim Campbell, Kenyan First Lady Margaret Kenyatta and Craig Kielburger, a co-founder of WE Charity organization.

In 2010, she authored &quot;Changing My Mind&quot;, a book about her personal experience with bipolar disorder.

==Award==
In 2013, Trudeau received an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws from the University of Western Ontario in recognition of her work to combat mental illness.

<doc id="343596" wikidata="Q107280570" url="?curid=343596" title="Bullet (Misfits song)">
<text>&quot;Bullet&quot; is the second single released by the horror punk band the Misfits. The four tracks comprising the EP were recorded, along with thirteen others, in early 1978 for the proposed &quot;Static Age&quot; album. When the band could not find a record label to release the album, they instead released four of the songs as &quot;Bullet&quot; on singer Glenn Danzig&#x27;s label Plan 9 Records. The songs were re-released in different versions over subsequent years, until &quot;Static Age&quot; was finally released in its entirety in 1996.

==Background==
In August 1977 the Misfits released their debut single &quot;Cough/Cool&quot; on Blank Records, a label operated by singer Glenn Danzig. Several months later Mercury Records issued a Pere Ubu record on their own Blank Records imprint, unaware that Danzig held a trademark on the name. They offered him thirty hours of studio time in exchange for the rights to the Blank Records name, which he accepted. In January and February 1978 the Misfits, then consisting of Danzig, guitarist Franché Coma, bassist Jerry Only, and drummer Mr. Jim, recorded seventeen songs at C.I. Recordings in New York City with engineer and producer Dave Achelis. Because of the time constraints they recorded the songs live in the studio with only a few takes each and very few overdubs. They mixed fourteen of them with Achelis for their proposed first album, to be titled &quot;Static Age&quot;. However, the band were unable to find a record label interested in releasing the album, and instead released four of the tracks as the &quot;Bullet&quot; EP in June 1978 on Danzig&#x27;s new label Plan 9 Records.

The song &quot;Bullet&quot; references the 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy, with sexually explicit lyrics directed at his wife Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis: &quot;Texas is an outrage when your husband is dead/Texas is an outrage when they pick up his head/Texas is the reason that the President&#x27;s dead/You gotta suck, suck, Jackie, suck&quot;.

==Pressing information==
The first pressing of &quot;Bullet&quot; consisted of 1,000 copies on black 7&quot; vinyl with a gatefold cover and lyrics sheet. These copies had &quot;distributed by Ork&quot; printed on the back sleeve, as a distribution deal with Ork Records had been planned, but distribution through Ork never took place. A second pressing of 2,000 on red vinyl had a different back cover, removing the band photo and mention of Ork and replacing it with artwork of a bullet hole and the words &quot;better dead on red&quot;. 7,000 additional copies were later pressed on black vinyl with the same cover as the second pressing.

==Re-releases and other versions==
All four songs from &quot;Bullet&quot; were reissued on the &quot;Beware&quot; EP in January 1980, and a live version of &quot;We Are 138&quot; appeared on the &quot;Evilive&quot; EP in 1982. The compilation album &quot;Misfits&quot; (1986), released three years after the band&#x27;s breakup, included &quot;Bullet&quot; and &quot;Hollywood Babylon&quot;, while &quot;Collection II&quot; (1995) included &quot;We Are 138&quot; and &quot;Attitude&quot;.

The Misfits box set in 1996 presented the complete &quot;Static Age&quot; album for the first time, including all four tracks from the &quot;Bullet&quot; single. &quot;Static Age&quot; was also released as a separate album that July.

==Cover versions==
&quot;Bullet&quot; was covered by Refused for the &quot;Children In Heat&quot; compilation, and the Hellacopters covered it on the tribute album &quot;Hell on Earth: A Tribute to the Misfits&quot; (2000). Entombed also covered &quot;Hollywood Babylon&quot; on the same album. &quot;Attitude&quot; was covered by Sum 41, the Slackers, and Guns N&#x27; Roses. In 2014, Energy covered the song as part of their 7-song Misfits tribute EP.

<doc id="343602" wikidata="Q7301" url="?curid=343602" title="Liu Bian">
<text>Liu Bian (176 – 6 March 190), also known as Emperor Shao of Han and the Prince of Hongnong, was the 13th emperor of the Eastern Han dynasty in China. He became emperor around the age of 13 upon the death of his father, Emperor Ling, and ruled briefly from 15 May to 28 September 189 before he was deposed, after which he became known as the &quot;Prince of Hongnong&quot;. His emperor title, &quot;Emperor Shao&quot; (literally &quot;young emperor&quot;), was also used by other emperors who were in power for very short periods of time. In March 190, he was poisoned by Dong Zhuo, the warlord who deposed him and replaced him with his younger half-brother, Liu Xie (Emperor Xian).

== Family background ==
Liu Bian was born in 176 to Liu Hong (Emperor Ling) and one of his consorts, Lady He. At the time of his birth, he was Emperor Ling&#x27;s only son because the emperor&#x27;s other sons who were born before Liu Bian died prematurely. As Emperor Ling believed that he lost his previous sons due to bad luck, he ordered Shi Zimiao (), a Taoist, to raise his newborn son; Liu Bian was given the title &quot;Marquis Shi&quot; (). Liu Bian&#x27;s mother, Lady He, became empress in 180. In 181, another of Emperor Ling&#x27;s consorts, Beautiful Lady Wang (), gave birth to a son, Liu Xie. Empress He, in her jealousy, had Beautiful Lady Wang poisoned to death. The motherless Liu Xie was raised by his grandmother, Empress Dowager Dong, and given the title &quot;Marquis Dong&quot; ().

When his subjects asked him to name one of his sons as crown prince, Emperor Ling had a dilemma between Liu Bian and Liu Xie, his only two surviving sons. He felt that Liu Bian was unfit to be emperor because he was frivolous and unable to command respect, so he preferred Liu Xie. However, he was also worried that if he chose Liu Xie, Empress He would turn to her half-brother, He Jin, for help. He Jin held the position of General-in-Chief () and was a highly influential figure in the imperial court. He ultimately did not name either of his sons as crown prince.

== Reign ==
When Emperor Ling became critically ill in 189, he secretly entrusted an eight-year-old Liu Xie to a close aide and eunuch, Jian Shuo. Upon the emperor&#x27;s death, Jian Shuo attempted to lure He Jin into a trap in the palace, assassinate him, and then install Liu Xie on the throne. Jian Shuo&#x27;s plan to make Liu Xie emperor ultimately failed, so a 13-year-old Liu Bian was enthroned and became historically known as Emperor Shao. Empress He, as the emperor&#x27;s mother, became empress dowager and attended imperial court sessions alongside her son. As Emperor Shao was still young, General-in-Chief He Jin and Grand Tutor Yuan Wei () served as his regents.

In the summer of 189, after learning that Jian Shuo wanted to assassinate him, He Jin and his supporters launched a preemptive move against the eunuch and had him arrested and executed. Months later, Yuan Shao suggested to He Jin to eliminate the eunuch faction and consolidate power. Although Empress Dowager He strongly objected to He Jin&#x27;s plan, the General-in-Chief, acting on Yuan Shao&#x27;s advice, attempted to push his idea. He instigated a few regional warlords to lead their troops into the vicinity of Luoyang, the imperial capital, and openly demand that the eunuchs be executed – in the hope of pressuring Empress Dowager He into agreeing. The empress dowager, however, sided with and protected the eunuchs. In retaliation, the eunuchs hatched a plot to assassinate He Jin: they issued a fake imperial order in Empress Dowager He&#x27;s name, instructing He Jin to enter the imperial palace, where he fell into an ambush and was killed by the eunuchs.

After He Jin&#x27;s death, his subordinates Wu Kuang () and Zhang Zhang (), along with Yuan Shao, Yuan Shu and others, led their troops to storm the palace and kill the eunuchs in revenge. They indiscriminately slaughtered anyone who looked like a eunuch; some young men who had no facial hair, in desperation, dropped their pants in front of the soldiers to prove that they were not eunuchs. During the attack, the eunuchs took Emperor Shao, the Prince of Chenliu (Liu Xie) and Empress Dowager He hostage and tried to flee from the palace. Lu Zhi intercepted the eunuch Duan Gui () and saved the empress dowager from him. He Jin&#x27;s younger brother, He Miao, who was sympathetic towards the eunuchs, was killed by Wu Kuang and Dong Min (). Over 2,000 people died in the attack.

Emperor Shao and Liu Xie, who were taken out of the palace by the eunuchs during the chaos, were eventually found near the riverbank and saved by Lu Zhi and Min Gong (). As Lu Zhi and Min Gong were escorting the emperor and prince back to the imperial palace, they were intercepted by forces under the command of Dong Zhuo, one of the warlords initially summoned by He Jin to put pressure on Empress Dowager He. When Dong Zhuo met them, Emperor Shao was so shocked that he could not express his thoughts clearly. In contrast, Liu Xie had no difficulty in describing what happened and, in Dong Zhuo&#x27;s impression, behaved more like an emperor than Emperor Shao. Dong Zhuo thus conceived the idea of deposing Emperor Shao and replacing him with Liu Xie.

== Deposal and death ==
After escorting the emperor and prince back to Luoyang, Dong Zhuo took advantage of the power vacuum created by the conflict between He Jin and the eunuch faction to seize control of the central government and imperial court. Many officials and the imperial troops stationed in Luoyang felt intimidated by the elite, battle-tested soldiers whom Dong Zhuo brought along with him from Liang Province. Dong Zhuo eventually had Emperor Shao deposed and replaced with Liu Xie, who became historically known as Emperor Xian. The former Emperor Shao was given the honorary title &quot;Prince of Hongnong&quot;. Later that year, Dong Zhuo had Empress Dowager He poisoned to death in Yong&#x27;an Palace ().

In early 190, after a coalition of warlords launched a campaign against Dong Zhuo in the name of freeing Emperor Xian and the central government from his control, Dong Zhuo became worried that the warlords might restore the Prince of Hongnong to the throne and hence threaten the legitimacy of the government he controlled in Luoyang. Within a month after the campaign started, Dong Zhuo sent his adviser Li Ru to force the prince to commit suicide by drinking poisoned wine. The prince was allowed to bid his wife, Consort Tang, and other concubines farewell before succumbing to his fate. However, in &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, the former emperor writes a poem that upsets Dong Zhuo who then sends Li Ru to kill him. He was buried in a tomb originally constructed for the eunuch Zhao Zhong and later posthumously honoured as &quot;Prince Huai of Hongnong&quot; ().

<text>Early Christian art and architecture (or Paleochristian art) is the art produced by Christians, or under Christian patronage, from the earliest period of Christianity to, depending on the definition, sometime between 260 and 525. In practice, identifiably Christian art only survives from the 2nd century onwards. After 550, Christian art is classified as Byzantine, or according to region.

It is hard to know when distinctly Christian art began. Prior to 100, Christians may have been constrained by their position as a persecuted group from producing durable works of art. Since Christianity as a religion was not well represented in the public sphere, the lack of surviving art may reflect a lack of funds for patronage, and simply small numbers of followers. The Old Testament restrictions against the production of graven (an idol or fetish carved in wood or stone) images (see also Idolatry and Christianity) may also have constrained Christians from producing art. Christians may have made or purchased art with pagan iconography, but given it Christian meanings, as they later did. If this happened, &quot;Christian&quot; art would not be immediately recognizable as such.

Early Christianity used the same artistic media as the surrounding pagan culture. These media included fresco, mosaics, sculpture, and manuscript illumination. Early Christian art used not only Roman forms but also Roman styles. Late classical style included a proportional portrayal of the human body and impressionistic presentation of space. Late classical style is seen in early Christian frescos, such as those in the Catacombs of Rome, which include most examples of the earliest Christian art.
Early Christian art and architecture adapted Roman artistic motifs and gave new meanings to what had been pagan symbols. Among the motifs adopted were the peacock, Vitis viniferavines, and the &quot;Good Shepherd&quot;. Early Christians also developed their own iconography; for example, such symbols as the fish (&quot;ikhthus&quot;) were not borrowed from pagan iconography.

Early Christian art is generally divided into two periods by scholars: before and after either the Edict of Milan of 313, bringing the so-called Triumph of the Church under Constantine, or the First Council of Nicea in 325. The earlier period being called the Pre-Constantinian or Ante-Nicene Period and after being the period of the First seven Ecumenical Councils. The end of the period of early Christian art, which is typically defined by art historians as being in the 5th–7th centuries, is thus a good deal later than the end of the period of early Christianity as typically defined by theologians and church historians, which is more often considered to end under Constantine, around 313–325.

==Symbols==
During the persecution of Christians under the Roman Empire, Christian art was necessarily and deliberately furtive and ambiguous, using imagery that was shared with pagan culture but had a special meaning for Christians. The earliest surviving Christian art comes from the late 2nd to early 4th centuries on the walls of Christian tombs in the catacombs of Rome. From literary evidence, there may well have been panel icons which, like almost all classical painting, have disappeared. Initially Jesus was represented indirectly by pictogram symbols such as the &quot;Ichthys&quot; (fish), peacock, Lamb of God, or an anchor (the &quot;Labarum&quot; or &quot;Chi-Rho&quot; was a later development). Later personified symbols were used, including Jonah, whose three days in the belly of the whale pre-figured the interval between the death and resurrection of Jesus, Daniel in the lion&#x27;s den, or Orpheus&#x27; charming the animals. The image of &quot;The Good Shepherd&quot;, a beardless youth in pastoral scenes collecting sheep, was the most common of these images, and was probably not understood as a portrait of the historical Jesus. These images bear some resemblance to depictions of &quot;kouros&quot; figures in Greco-Roman art. The &quot;almost total absence from Christian monuments of the period of persecutions of the plain, unadorned cross&quot; except in the disguised form of the anchor, is notable. The Cross, symbolizing Jesus&#x27; crucifixion on a cross, was not represented explicitly for several centuries, possibly because crucifixion was a punishment meted out to common criminals, but also because literary sources noted that it was a symbol recognised as specifically Christian, as the sign of the cross was made by Christians from very early on.

The popular conception that the Christian catacombs were &quot;secret&quot; or had to hide their affiliation is probably wrong; catacombs were large-scale commercial enterprises, usually sited just off major roads to the city, whose existence was well known. The inexplicit symbolic nature of many early Christian visual motifs may have had a function of discretion in other contexts, but on tombs, they probably reflect a lack of any other repertoire of Christian iconography.

The dove is a symbol of peace and purity. It can be found with a halo or celestial light. In one of the earliest known Trinitarian images, &quot;the Throne of God as a Trinitarian image&quot; (a marble relief carved in the collection of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation), the dove represents the Spirit. It is flying above an empty throne representing God, in the throne are a &quot;chlamys&quot; (cloak) and diadem representing the Son. The Chi-Rho monogram, XP, apparently first used by Constantine I, consists of the first two characters of the name &#x27;Christos&#x27; in Greek.

==Christian art before 313==
A general assumption that early Christianity was generally aniconic, opposed to religious imagery in both theory and practice until about 200, has been challenged by Paul Corby Finney&#x27;s analysis of early Christian writing and material remains (1994). This distinguishes three different sources of attitudes affecting early Christians on the issue: &quot;first that humans could have a direct vision of God; second that they could not; and, third, that although humans could see God they were best advised not to look, and were strictly forbidden to represent what they had seen&quot;. These derived respectively from Greek and Near Eastern pagan religions, from Ancient Greek philosophy, and from the Jewish tradition and the Old Testament. Of the three, Finney concludes that &quot;overall, Israel&#x27;s aversion to sacred images influenced early Christianity considerably less than the Greek philosophical tradition of invisible deity apophatically defined&quot;, so placing less emphasis on the Jewish background of most of the first Christians than most traditional accounts. Finney suggests that &quot;the reasons for the non-appearance of Christian art before 200 have nothing to do with principled aversion to art, with other-worldliness, or with anti-materialism. The truth is simple and mundane: Christians lacked land and capital. Art requires both. As soon as they began to acquire land and capital, Christians began to experiment with their own distinctive forms of art&quot;.

In the Dura-Europos church, of about 230–256, which is in the best condition of the surviving very early churches, there are frescos of biblical scenes including a figure of Jesus, as well as Christ as the Good Shepherd. The building was a normal house apparently converted to use as a church. The earliest Christian paintings in the Catacombs of Rome are from a few decades before, and these represent the largest body of examples of Christian art from the pre-Constantinian period, with hundreds of examples decorating tombs or family tomb-chambers. Many are simple symbols, but there are numerous figure paintings either showing orants or female praying figures, usually representing the deceased person, or figures or shorthand scenes from the bible or Christian history.

The style of the catacomb paintings, and the entirety of many decorative elements, are effectively identical to those of the catacombs of other religious groups, whether conventional pagans following Ancient Roman religion, or Jews or followers of the Roman mystery religions. The quality of the painting is low compared to the large houses of the rich, which provide the other main &quot;corpus&quot; of painting surviving from the period, but the shorthand depiction of figures can have an expressive charm. A similar situation applies at Dura-Europos, where the decoration of the church is comparable in style and quality to that of the (larger and more lavishly painted) Dura-Europos synagogue and the Temple of Bel. At least in such smaller places, it seems that the available artists were used by all religious groups. It may also have been the case that the painted chambers in the catacombs were decorated in similar style to the best rooms of the homes of the better-off families buried in them, with Christian scenes and symbols replacing those from mythology, literature, paganism and eroticism, although we lack the evidence to confirm this. We do have the same scenes on small pieces in media such as pottery or glass, though less often from this pre-Constantinian period.

There was a preference for what are sometimes called &quot;abbreviated&quot; representations, small groups of say one to four figures forming a single motif which could be easily recognised as representing a particular incident. These vignettes fitted the Roman style of room decoration, set in compartments in a scheme with a geometrical structure (see gallery below). Biblical scenes of figures rescued from mortal danger were very popular; these represented both the Resurrection of Jesus, through typology, and the salvation of the soul of the deceased. Jonah and the whale, the Sacrifice of Isaac, Noah praying in the Ark (represented as an orant in a large box, perhaps with a dove carrying a branch), Moses striking the rock, Daniel in the lion&#x27;s den and the Three Youths in the Fiery Furnace () were all favourites, that could be easily depicted.

Early Christian sarcophagi were a much more expensive option, made of marble and often heavily decorated with scenes in very high relief, worked with drills. Free-standing statues that are unmistakably Christian are very rare, and never very large, as more common subjects such as the Good Shepherd were symbols appealing to several religious and philosophical groups, including Christians, and without context no affiliation can be given to them. Typically sculptures, where they appear, are of rather high quality. One exceptional group that seems clearly Christian is known as the Cleveland Statuettes of Jonah and the Whale, and consists of a group of small statuettes of about 270, including two busts of a young and fashionably dressed couple, from an unknown find-spot, possibly in modern Turkey. The other figures tell the story of Jonah in four pieces, with a Good Shepherd; how they were displayed remains mysterious.

The depiction of Jesus was well-developed by the end of the pre-Constantinian period. He was typically shown in narrative scenes, with a preference for New Testament miracles, and few of scenes from his Passion. A variety of different types of appearance were used, including the thin long-faced figure with long centrally-parted hair that was later to become the norm. But in the earliest images as many show a stocky and short-haired beardless figure in a short tunic, who can only be identified by his context. In many images of miracles Jesus carries a stick or wand, which he points at the subject of the miracle rather like a modern stage magician (though the wand is a good deal larger).

Saints are fairly often seen, with Peter and Paul, both martyred in Rome, by some way the most common in the catacombs there. Both already have their distinctive appearances, retained throughout the history of Christian art. Other saints may not be identifiable unless labelled with an inscription. In the same way some images may represent either the Last Supper or a contemporary agape feast.

==Christian architecture after 313==

In the 4th century, the rapidly growing Christian population, now supported by the state, needed to build larger and grander public buildings for worship than the mostly discreet meeting places they had been using, which were typically in or among domestic buildings. Pagan temples remained in use for their original purposes for some time and, at least in Rome, even when deserted were shunned by Christians until the 6th or 7th centuries, when some were converted to churches. Elsewhere this happened sooner. Architectural formulas for temples were unsuitable, not simply for their pagan associations, but because pagan cult and sacrifices occurred outdoors under the open sky in the sight of the gods, with the temple, housing the cult figures and the treasury, as a windowless backdrop.

The usable model at hand, when Emperor Constantine I wanted to memorialize his imperial piety, was the familiar conventional architecture of the basilica. There were several variations of the basic plan of the secular basilica, always some kind of rectangular hall, but the one usually followed for churches had a center nave with one aisle at each side, and an apse at one end opposite to the main door at the other. In, and often also in front of, the apse was a raised platform, where the altar was placed and the clergy officiated. In secular buildings this plan was more typically used for the smaller audience halls of the emperors, governors, and the very rich than for the great public basilicas functioning as law courts and other public purposes.

This was the normal pattern used for Roman churches, and generally in the Western Empire, but the Eastern Empire, and Roman Africa, were more adventurous, and their models were sometimes copied in the West, for example in Milan. All variations allowed natural light from windows high in the walls, a departure from the windowless sanctuaries of the temples of most previous religions, and this has remained a consistent feature of Christian church architecture. Formulas giving churches with a large central area were to become preferred in Byzantine architecture, which developed styles of basilica with a dome early on. Within the dome architecture Christian churches used them to venerate icons at a larger than life scale, while Christians remained covered and inside. 

A particular and short-lived type of building, using the same basilican form, was the funerary hall, which was not a normal church, though the surviving examples long ago became regular churches, and they always offered funeral and memorial services, but a building erected in the Constantinian period as an indoor cemetery on a site connected with early Christian martyrs, such as a catacomb. The six examples built by Constantine outside the walls of Rome are: Old Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica, the older basilica dedicated to Saint Agnes of which Santa Costanza is now the only remaining element, San Sebastiano fuori le mura, , Santi Marcellino e Pietro al Laterano, and one in the modern park of Villa Gordiani.

A martyrium was a building erected on a spot with particular significance, often over the burial of a martyr. No particular architectural form was associated with the type, and they were often small. Many became churches, or chapels in larger churches erected adjoining them. With baptistries and mausolea, their often smaller size and different function made martyria suitable for architectural experimentation.

Among the key buildings, not all surviving in their original form, are:
* Constantinian Basilicas:
** Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran
** St Mary Major
** Old Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica
** Church of the Holy Sepulchre
** Church of the Nativity
** Saint Sofia Church, Sofia
* Centralized Plan
** Santa Constanza, built as an Imperial mausoleum adjoining a funerary hall, part of the wall of which survives.
** Church of St. George, Sofia

==Christian art after 313==

With the final legalization of Christianity, the existing styles of Christian art continued to develop, and take on a more monumental and iconic character. Before long very large Christian churches began to be constructed, and the majority of the rich elite adapted Christianity, and public and elite Christian art became grander to suit the new spaces and clients. Hans Belting wrote that &quot;in late antiquity... Christianity adopted the cult images of the &quot;pagans&quot;, in a complete reversal of its original attitude, and developed an image practice of its own.&quot; But large free-standing sculpture, the medium for the most prominent pagan images, continued to be distrusted and largely shunned for some centuries, and virtually up to the present day in the Orthodox world.

Although borrowings of motifs such as the Virgin and Child from pagan religious art had been pointed out as far back as the Protestant Reformation, when John Calvin and his followers gleefully used them as a stick with which to beat all Christian art, the belief of André Grabar, Andreas Alföldi, Ernst Kantorowicz and other early 20th-century art historians that Roman Imperial imagery was a much more significant influence &quot;has become universally accepted&quot;. A book by Thomas F. Mathews in 1994 attempted to overturn this thesis, very largely denying influence from Imperial iconography in favour of a range of other secular and religious influence, but was roughly handled by academic reviewers.

More complex and expensive works are seen, as the wealthy gradually converted, and more theological complexity appears, as Christianity became subject to acrimonious doctrinal disputes. At the same time a very different type of art is found in the new public churches that were now being constructed. Somewhat by accident, the best group of survivals of these is from Rome where, together with Constantinople and Jerusalem, they were presumably at their most magnificent. Mosaic now becomes important; fortunately this survives far better than fresco, although it is vulnerable to well-meaning restoration and repair. It seems to have been an innovation of early Christian churches to put mosaics on the wall and use them for sacred subjects; previously, the technique had essentially been used for floors and walls in gardens. By the end of the period the style of using a gold ground had developed that continued to characterize Byzantine images, and many medieval Western ones.

With more space, narrative images containing many people develop in churches, and also begin to be seen in later catacomb paintings. Continuous rows of biblical scenes appear (rather high up) along the side walls of churches. The best-preserved 5th-century examples are the set of Old Testament scenes along the nave walls of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome. These can be compared to the paintings of Dura-Europos, and probably also derive from a lost tradition of both Jewish and Christian illustrated manuscripts, as well as more general Roman precedents. The large apses contain images in an iconic style, which gradually developed to centre on a large figure, or later just the bust, of Christ, or later of the Virgin Mary. The earliest apses show a range of compositions that are new symbolic images of the Christian life and the Church.

No panel paintings, or &quot;icons&quot; from before the 6th century have survived in anything like an original condition, but they were clearly produced, and becoming more important throughout this period.

Sculpture, all much smaller than lifesize, has survived in better quantities. The most famous of a considerable number of surviving early Christian sarcophagi are perhaps the Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus and Dogmatic sarcophagus of the 4th century. A number of ivory carvings have survived, including the complex late-5th-century Brescia Casket, probably a product of Saint Ambrose&#x27;s episcopate in Milan, then the seat of the Imperial court, and the 6th-century Throne of Maximian from the Byzantine Italian capital of Ravenna.

===Gold glass===

Gold sandwich glass or gold glass was a technique for fixing a layer of gold leaf with a design between two fused layers of glass, developed in Hellenistic glass and revived in the 3rd century. There are a very fewer larger designs, but the great majority of the around 500 survivals are roundels that are the cut-off bottoms of wine cups or glasses used to mark and decorate graves in the Catacombs of Rome by pressing them into the mortar. The great majority are 4th century, extending into the 5th century. Most are Christian, but many pagan and a few Jewish, and had probably originally been given as gifts on marriage, or festive occasions such as New Year. Their iconography has been much studied, although artistically they are relatively unsophisticated. Their subjects are similar to the catacomb paintings, but with a difference balance including more portraiture of the deceased (usually, it is presumed). The progression to an increased number of images of saints can be seen in them. The same technique began to be used for gold tesserae for mosaics in the mid-1st century in Rome, and by the 5th century these had become the standard background for religious mosaics.

<text>Sir William Petty (26 May 1623 – 16 December 1687) was an English economist, physician, scientist and philosopher. He first became prominent serving Oliver Cromwell and the Commonwealth in Ireland. He developed efficient methods to survey the land that was to be confiscated and given to Cromwell&#x27;s soldiers. He also remained a significant figure under King Charles II and King James II, as did many others who had served Cromwell.

Petty was also a scientist, inventor, and merchant, a charter member of the Royal Society, and briefly a member of the Parliament of England. However, he is best remembered for his theories on economics and his methods of &quot;political arithmetic&quot;. He was knighted in 1661.

==Life==

=== Early life ===
Petty was born in London, where his father and grandfather were clothiers. He was a precocious and intelligent youth and in 1637 became a cabin boy. His readiness to provide caricatures of fellow crew members won him few friends. He also learnt of his defective sight when he failed to spot a landmark he had been told to look for. The captain, who had by this time seen the landmark from the deck for himself &quot;drubbed him with a cord&quot;. He was subsequently set ashore in Normandy after breaking his leg on board. After this setback, he applied in Latin to study with the Jesuits in Caen, supporting himself by teaching English. After a year, he returned to England, and had by now a thorough knowledge of Latin, Greek, French, mathematics, and astronomy.

=== Career ===
===At Oxford===
After the Third Siege of Oxford had resulted in the garrison surrendering to the parliamentarians on 24 June 1646, Petty arrived in the town and was offered a fellowship at Brasenose College and studied medicine at the University. He befriended Hartlib and Boyle and became a member of the Oxford Philosophical Club.
==== Musician, doctor, academic and surveyor ====
By 1651, Petty was an anatomy instructor at Brasenose College, Oxford, as deputy to Thomas Clayton the younger. With a second doctor, Thomas Willis, Petty was involved in treating Anne Greene, a woman who survived her own hanging and was subsequently pardoned because her survival was widely held to be an act of divine intervention. The event was widely written about at the time, and helped to build Petty&#x27;s career and reputation. He was also appointed Gresham Professor of Music by the Corporation of the City of London in 1650, retaining the post until 1660.

In 1652, he took a leave of absence and travelled with Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s army in Ireland as physician-general, responsible to Cromwell&#x27;s son-in-law, Charles Fleetwood. His opposition to conventional universities, being committed to &#x27;new science&#x27; as inspired by Francis Bacon and imparted by his afore-mentioned acquaintances, perhaps pushed him from Oxford. He was pulled to Ireland perhaps by a sense of ambition and desire for wealth and power. He secured the contract for charting Ireland in 1654, so that those who had lent funds to Cromwell&#x27;s army might be repaid in land – a means of ensuring the army was self-financing. This enormous task, which he completed in 1656, became known as the Down Survey, later published (1685) as &quot;Hiberniae Delineatio&quot;. As his reward, he acquired approximately in Kenmare, in southwest Ireland, and £9,000. This personal gain to Petty led to persistent court cases on charges of bribery and breach of trust, until his death.

Back in England, as a Cromwellian supporter, he ran successfully for Parliament in 1659 for West Looe.

==== Projector ====

Petty gained possession of the three baronies of Iveragh, Glanarought and Dunkerron in County Kerry. He soon became a projector, developing extensive plans for an ironworks and a fishery on his substantial estates in Kerry. Although he had great expectations of his application of his scientific methods to improvement, little came of these. He began by applying his political arithmetic to his own estates, surveying the population and livestock to develop an understanding of the land&#x27;s potential. The ironworks was established in 1660.

==== Natural philosopher ====
Despite his political allegiances, Petty was well-treated at the Restoration in 1660, although he lost some of his Irish lands. Charles II, at their first meeting, brushed aside Petty&#x27;s apologies for his past support for Cromwell, &quot;seeming to regard them as needless&quot;, and discussed his experiments into the mechanics of shipping instead.

In 1661 he was elected as a Member of Parliament for Inistioge in the Parliament of Ireland. In 1662, he was admitted as a charter member of the Royal Society of the same year. This year also saw him write his first work on economics, &quot;Treatise of Taxes and Contributions&quot;. Petty counted naval architecture among his many scientific interests. He had become convinced of the superiority of double-hulled boats, although they were not always successful; a ship called the &quot;Experiment&quot; reached Porto in 1664, but sank on the way back.

=== Ireland and later life ===
Petty was knighted in 1661 by Charles II and served as MP for Inistioge from 1661-66. He remained in Ireland until 1685. He was a friend of Samuel Pepys.

The events that took him from Oxford to Ireland marked a shift from medicine and the physical sciences to the social sciences, and Petty lost all his Oxford offices. The social sciences became the area that he studied for the rest of his life. His focus became greater income from Irish colonization, and his works describe that country and propose many remedies for what he characterized as its backward condition. He helped found the Dublin Society in 1682. Returning ultimately to London in 1685, he died in 1687. He was buried in Romsey Abbey.

==Family==
William Petty married Elizabeth Waller in 1667. She was a daughter of the regicide Sir Hardress Waller (whose life was spared after the Restoration) and Elizabeth Dowdall. She had been previously married to Sir Maurice Fenton, who died in 1664. She was given the title Baroness Shelburne for life. They had three surviving children:
* Charles Petty, 1st Baron Shelburne
* Henry Petty, 1st Earl of Shelburne
* Anne, who married Thomas Fitzmaurice, 1st Earl of Kerry.

Neither Charles nor Henry had male issue and the Shelburne title passed by a special remainder to Anne&#x27;s son John Petty, 1st Earl of Shelburne, who took his mother&#x27;s surname, and whose descendants hold the title Marquis of Lansdowne. Her grandson William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne, praised her as a woman of strong character and intelligence, the only person who could manage her bad-tempered and tyrannical husband.

==Economic works and theories==

Two men crucially influenced Petty&#x27;s economic theories. The first was Thomas Hobbes, for whom Petty acted as personal secretary. According to Hobbes, theory should set out the rational requirements for &quot;civil peace and material plenty&quot;. As Hobbes had centred on peace, Petty chose prosperity.

The influence of Francis Bacon was also profound. Bacon, and indeed Hobbes, held the conviction that mathematics and the senses must be the basis of all rational sciences. This passion for accuracy led Petty to famously declare that his form of science would only use measurable phenomena and would seek quantitative precision, rather than rely on comparatives or superlatives, yielding a new subject that he named &quot;political arithmetic&quot;. Petty thus carved a niche for himself as the first dedicated economic scientist, amidst the merchant-pamphleteers, such as Thomas Mun or Josiah Child, and philosopher-scientists occasionally discussing economics, such as John Locke.

He was indeed writing before the true development of political economy. As such, many of his claims for precision are of imperfect quality. Nonetheless, Petty wrote three main works on economics, &quot;Treatise of Taxes and Contributions&quot; (written in 1662), &quot;Verbum Sapienti&quot; (1665) and &quot;Quantulumcunque Concerning Money&quot; (1682). These works, which received great attention in the 1690s, show his theories on major areas of what would later become economics. What follows is an analysis of his most important theories, those on fiscal contributions, national wealth, the money supply and circulation velocity, value, the interest rate, international trade and government investment.

Many of his economic writings were collected by Charles Henry Hull in 1899 in &quot;The Economic Writings of Sir William Petty&quot;.

Hull, in his scholarly article &#x27;Petty&#x27;s Place in the History of Economic Theory&#x27; (1900) proposed a division of the economic writings of Petty in three (or four) groups:
* the first group, written when Petty had returned to London after finishing his &quot;Down Survey&quot; in Ireland, consists mainly of &quot;A Treatise of Taxes &amp; Contributions&quot; (written and first published 1662) and &quot;Verbum Sapienti&quot; (written 1665, printed 1691). These texts relate to the discussions about fiscal issues, following the Restoration and the expenses of the first Dutch war.
* the second group holds &quot;The Political Anatomy of Ireland&quot; and &quot;Political Arithmetick.&quot; These texts were written some ten years later in Ireland. As Hull writes, the &quot;direct impulse to their writing came from Dr. Edward Chamberlayne&#x27;s &quot;Present State of England&quot;, published 1669&quot;.
* Again ten years later the third group of pamphlets was written, that were contributions to the dispute whether London was a larger city than Paris, and that are titled the &quot;Essays in Political Arithmetick&quot; by Hull. This group of pamphlets had a close relation to John Graunt&#x27;s &quot;Observations upon the Bills of Mortality of London.&quot;
* The &quot;Quantulumcunque concerning Money&quot; (written in 1682, and printed in 1695, and perhaps in 1682), can probably be considered as belonging to a group of its own.
The division given here was still used by scholars at the end of the twentieth century.

=== Fiscal contributions ===
By Petty&#x27;s time, England was engaged in war with Holland, and in the first three chapters of &quot;Treatise of Taxes and Contributions&quot;, Petty sought to establish principles of taxation and public expenditure, to which the monarch could adhere, when deciding how to raise money for the war. Petty lists six kinds of public charge, namely defence, governance, the &quot;pastorage of men&#x27;s souls&quot;, education, the maintenance of &quot;impotents of all sorts&quot; and infrastructure, or &quot;things of universal good&quot;. He then discusses general and particular causes of changes in these charges. He thinks that there is great scope for reduction of the first four public charges, and recommends increased spending on care for the elderly, sick, orphans, etc., as well as the government employment of &quot;supernumeraries&quot;.

Petty was interested in the extent to which taxes could be raised without inciting rebellion On the issue of raising taxes, Petty was a definite proponent of consumption taxes. He recommended that in general taxes should be just sufficient to meet the various types of public charges that he listed. They should also be horizontally equitable, regular and proportionate. He condemned poll taxes as very unequal and excise on beer as taxing the poor excessively. He recommended a much higher quality of statistical information, to raise taxes more fairly. Imports should be taxed, but only in such a way that would put them on a level playing field with domestic produce. A vital aspect of economies at this time was that they were transforming from barter economies to money economies. Linked to this, and aware of the scarcity of money, Petty recommends that taxes be payable in forms other than gold or silver, which he estimated to be less than 1% of national wealth. To him, too much importance was placed on money, &quot;which is to the whole effect of the Kingdom… not [even] one to 100&quot;.

=== National income accounting ===
In making the above estimate, Petty introduced in the first two chapters of &quot;Verbum Sapienti&quot; the first rigorous assessments of national income and wealth. To him, it was all too obvious that a country&#x27;s wealth lay in more than just gold and silver. He worked off an estimation that the average personal income was £6 13s 4d per annum, with a population of six million, meaning that national income would be £40m. Petty&#x27;s theory produced estimates, some more reliable than others, for the various components of national income, including land, ships, personal estates and housing. He then distinguished between the stocks (£250m) and the flows yielding from them (£15m). The discrepancy between these flows and his estimate for national income (£40m) leads Petty to postulate that the other £25m is the yield from what must be £417m of labour stock, the &quot;value of the people&quot;. This gave a total wealth for England in the 1660s of £667m.

=== Statistics ===

Petty&#x27;s only statistical technique is the use of simple averages. He would not be a statistician by today&#x27;s standards but during his time a statistician was merely one that employed the use of quantitative data. Because obtaining census data was difficult, if not impossible, especially for Ireland, he applied methods of estimation. The way in which he would estimate the population would be to start with estimating the population of London. He would do this by either estimating it by exports or by deaths. His method of using exports is by considering that a 30 per cent increase in exports corresponds to a similar proportionate increase in population. The way he would use deaths would be by multiplying the number of deaths by 30 – estimating that one out of thirty people dies each year. To obtain the population of all of England he would multiply the population of London by 8. Such a simple use of estimation could have easily have been abused and Petty was accused more than once of doctoring the figures for the Crown. (Henry Spiegel)

=== Money supply and circulation ===
This figure for the stock of wealth was contrasted with a money supply in gold and silver of only £6m. Petty believed that there was a certain amount of money that a nation needed to drive its trade. Hence it was possible to have too little money circulating in an economy, which would mean that people would have to rely on barter. It would also be possible for there to be too much money in an economy. But the topical question was, as he asks in chapter 3 of &quot;Verbum Sapienti&quot;, would £6m be enough to drive a nation&#x27;s trade, especially if the King wanted to raise additional funds for the war with Holland?

The answer for Petty lay in the velocity of money&#x27;s circulation. Anticipating the quantity theory of money often said to be initiated by John Locke, whereby economic output (&quot;Y&quot;) times price level (&quot;p&quot;) = money supply (&quot;MS&quot;) times velocity of circulation (&quot;v&quot;), Petty stated that if economic output was to be increased for a given money supply and price level, &#x27;revolutions&#x27; must occur in smaller circles (i.e. velocity of circulation must be higher). This could be done through the establishment of a bank. He explicitly stated in &quot;Verbum Sapienti&quot; &quot;nor is money wanting to answer all the ends of a well-policed state, notwithstanding the great decreases thereof which have happened within these Twenty years&quot; and that higher velocity is the answer. He also mentions that there is nothing unique about gold and silver in fulfilling the functions of money and that money is the means to an end, not the end itself:

Nor were it hard to substitute in the place of Money [gold and silver] (were a comptency of it wanting) what should be equivalent unto it. For Money is but the Fat of the Body-Politick, whereof too much doth often hinder its agility, as too little makes it sick... so doth Money in the State quicken its Action, feeds from abroad in the time of Dearth at home.&#x27;

What is striking about these passages is his intellectual rigour, which put him far ahead of the mercantilist writers of earlier in the century. The use of biological analogies to illustrate his point, a trend continued by the physiocrats in France early in the 18th century, was also unusual.

=== Theory of value ===
On value, Petty continued the debate begun by Aristotle, and chose to develop an input-based theory of value: &quot;all things ought to be valued by two natural Denominations, which is Land and Labour&quot; (p. 44). Both of these would be prime sources of taxable income. Like Richard Cantillon after him, he sought to devise some equation or par between the &quot;mother and father&quot; of output, land and labour, and to express value accordingly. He still included general productivity, one&#x27;s &quot;art and industry&quot;. He applied his theory of value to rent. The natural rent of a land was the excess of what a labourer produces on it in a year over what he ate himself and traded for necessities. It was therefore the profit above the various costs related to the factors involved in production.

=== Interest rate ===
The natural rate of rent is related to his theories on usury. At the time, many religious writers still condemned the charging of interest as sinful. Petty also involved himself in the debate on usury and interest rates, regarding the phenomenon as a reward for forbearance on the part of the lender. Incorporating his theories of value, he asserted that, with perfect security, the rate of interest should equal the rent for land that the principal could have bought – again, a precocious insight into what would later become general equilibrium findings. Where security was more &quot;casual&quot;, the return should be greater – a return for risk. Having established the justification for usury itself, that of forbearance, he then shows his Hobbesian qualities, arguing against any government regulation of the interest rate, pointing to the &quot;vanity and fruitlessness of making civil positive laws against the laws of nature&quot;.

=== &quot;Laissez-faire&quot; governance ===
This is one of the major themes of Petty&#x27;s writings, summed up by his use of the phrase &quot;vadere sicut vult&quot;, from which &quot;laissez-faire&quot; is derived. As mentioned earlier, the motif of medicine was also useful to Petty, and he warned against over-interference by the government in the economy, seeing it as analogous to a physician tampering excessively with his patient. He applied this to monopolies, controls on the exportation of money and on the trade of commodities. They were, to him, vain and harmful to a nation. He recognised the price effects of monopolies, citing the French king&#x27;s salt monopoly as an example. In another work, &quot;Political Arithmetic&quot;, Petty also recognised the importance of economies of scale. He described the phenomenon of the division of labour, asserting that a good is both of better quality and cheaper, if many work on it. Petty said that the gain is greater &quot;as the manufacture itself is greater&quot;.

=== Foreign exchange and control of trade ===
On the efflux of specie, Petty thought it vain to try to control it, and dangerous, as it would leave the merchants to decide what goods a nation buys with the smaller amount of money. He noted in &quot;Quantulumcunque concerning money&quot; that countries plentiful in gold have no such laws restricting specie. On exports in general, he regarded prescriptions, such as recent Acts of Parliament forbidding the export of wool and yarn, as &quot;burthensome&quot;. Further restrictions &quot;would do us twice as much harm as the losse of our said Trade&quot; (p. 59), albeit with a concession that he is no expert in the study of the wool trade.

On prohibiting imports, for example from Holland, such restrictions did little other than drive up prices, and were only useful if imports vastly exceeded exports. Petty saw far more use in going to Holland and learning whatever skills they have than trying to resist nature. Epitomizing his viewpoint, he thought it preferable to sell cloth for &quot;debauching&quot; foreign wines, rather than leave the clothiers unemployed.

=== Division of labour ===
In his Political Arithmetick, Petty made a practical study of the division of labour, showing its existence and usefulness in Dutch shipyards. Classically the workers in a shipyard would build ships as units, finishing one before starting another. But the Dutch had it organised with several teams each doing the same tasks for successive ships. People with a particular task to do must have discovered new methods that were only later observed and justified by writers on political economy.

Petty also applied the principle to his survey of Ireland. His breakthrough was to divide up the work so that large parts of it could be done by people with no extensive training.

=== Urban society ===
Petty projected the growth of the city of London and supposed that it might swallow the rest of England – not so far from what actually happened:

Now, if the city double its people in 40 years, and the present number be 670,000, and if the whole territory be 7,400,000, and double in 360 years, as aforesaid, then by the underwritten table it appears that A.D. 1840 the people of the city will be 10,718,880, and those of the whole country but 10,917,389, which is but inconsiderably more. Wherefore it is certain and necessary that the growth of the city must stop before the said year 1840, and will be at its utmost height in the next preceding period, A.D. 1800, when the number of the city will be eight times its present number, 5,359,000. And when (besides the said number) there will be 4,466,000 to perform the tillage, pasturage, and other rural works necessary to be done without the said city.
He imagined a future in which &quot;the city of London is seven times bigger than now, and that the inhabitants of it are 4,690,000 people, and that in all the other cities, ports, towns, and villages, there are but 2,710,000 more&quot;. He expected this some time around 1800, extrapolating existing trends. Long before Malthus, he noticed the potential of the human population to increase. But he also saw no reason why such a society should not be prosperous.

==Legacy==
Petty is best remembered for his economic history and statistical writings, preceding the work of Adam Smith, and for being a founding member of the Royal Society. Of particular interest were his forays into statistical analysis. Petty&#x27;s work in political arithmetic, along with the work of John Graunt, laid the foundation for modern census techniques. This work in statistical analysis, when further expanded by writers like Josiah Child documented some of the first expositions of modern insurance. Vernon Louis Parrington notes him as an early expositor of the labour theory of value as discussed in &quot;Treatise of Taxes&quot; in 1692.

He influenced several future economists, including Richard Cantillon, Adam Smith, Karl Marx, and John Maynard Keynes. Petty and Adam Smith shared a worldview that believed in a harmonious natural world. They both saw the benefits of specialisation and the division of labour. Smith said nothing about Petty in &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;. In his published writings, there is nothing apart from a reference in a letter to Lord Shelburne, one of Petty&#x27;s aristocratic descendants.

Karl Marx imitated Petty&#x27;s belief that the total effort put in by the aggregate of ordinary workers represented a far greater contribution to the economy than contemporary ideas recognised. This belief led Petty to conclude that labour ranked as the greatest source of wealth. By contrast, Marx&#x27;s conclusions were that surplus labour was the source of all profit, and that the labourer was alienated from his surplus and thus from society. Marx&#x27;s high esteem of Adam Smith is mirrored in his consideration of Petty&#x27;s analysis, testified for by countless quotations in his major work &quot;Das Kapital&quot;. John Maynard Keynes demonstrated how governments could manage aggregate demand to stimulate output and employment, much as Petty had done with simpler examples in the 17th century. Petty&#x27;s simple £100-through-100-hands multiplier was refined by Keynes and incorporated into his model.

Some consider Petty&#x27;s achievements a matter of good fortune. Petty was a music professor before being apprenticed to the brilliant Thomas Hobbes. He arrived upon his laissez-faire view of economics at a time of great opportunity and growth in the expanding British Empire. Laissez-faire policies stood in direct contrast to his supervisor Hobbes&#x27;s Social Contract, developed from Hobbes&#x27;s experiences during the greatest depression in England&#x27;s history, the General Crisis.

=== Monument ===
In 1858 Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 3rd Marquess of Lansdowne, one of Petty&#x27;s descendants, erected a memorial and likeness of Petty in Romsey Abbey. The text on it reads: &quot;A true patriot and a sound philosopher who, by his powerful intellect, his scientific works and indefatigable industry, became a benefactor to his family and an ornament to his country&quot;. A monumental slab on the floor of the south choir aisle of the Abbey reads &quot;HERE LAYES SIR WILLIAM PETY&quot;. The third Marquess also erected the Lansdowne Monument on Cherhill Down in Wiltshire.

<doc id="343614" wikidata="Q7225689" url="?curid=343614" title="Pollinator decline">
<text>Pollinator decline is the reduction in abundance of insect and other animal pollinators in many ecosystems worldwide that began being recorded at the end of the 20th century. Multiple lines of evidence exist for the reduction of wild pollinator populations at the regional level, especially within Europe and North America. Similar findings from studies in South America, China and Japan make it reasonable to suggest that declines are occurring around the globe. The majority of studies focus on bees, particularly honeybee and bumblebee species, with a smaller number involving hoverflies and lepidopterans.

The picture for domesticated pollinator species is less clear. Although the number of managed honey bee colonies in Europe and North America declined by 25% and 59% between 1985-2005 and 1947-2005 respectively, overall global stocks increased due to major hive number increases in countries such as China and Argentina. Nevertheless, in the time managed honeybee hives increased by 45% demand for animal pollinated crops tripled, highlighting the danger of relying on domesticated populations for pollination services.

Pollinators participate in the sexual reproduction of many plants by ensuring cross-pollination, essential for some species and a major factor in ensuring genetic diversity for others. Since plants are the primary food source for animals, the possible reduction or disappearance of pollinators has been referred to as an &quot;armageddon&quot; by some journalists.

==Evidence==

The declines in abundance and diversity of insect pollinators over the twentieth century have been documented in highly industrialized regions of the world, particularly northwestern Europe and eastern North America.

Colony collapse disorder has attracted much public attention. According to a 2013 blog the winter losses of beehives had increased in recent years in Europe and the United States, with a hive failure rate up to 50%.

A 2017 German study, using 1,500 samples from 63 sites, indicated that the biomass of flying insects in that area had declined by three-quarters in the previous 25 years. One 2009 study stated that while the bee population had increased by 45% over the past 50 years, the amount of crops which use bees had increased by 300%; although there is absolutely no evidence this has caused any problems, the authors propose it might cause &quot;future pollination problems&quot;.

In mathematical models of the networks linking different plants and their many pollinators, such a network can continue to function very well under increasingly harsh conditions, but when conditions become extremely harsh, the entire network fails simultaneously.

A 2021 study described as the &quot;first long-term assessment of global bee decline&quot;, which analyzed GBIF-data of over a century, found that the number of bee species declined steeply worldwide after the 1990s, shrinking by a quarter in 2006–2015 compared to before 1990.

== Possible explanations ==
Although the existence of pollinator decline can be difficult to determine, a number of possible reasons for the theoretical concept have been proposed, such as exposure to pathogens, parasites, and pesticides; habitat destruction; climate change; market forces; intra- and interspecific competition with native and invasive species; and genetic alterations.

Honey bees are an invasive species throughout most of the world where they have been introduced, and the constant growth in the amount of these pollinators may possibly cause a decrease in native species. Light pollution has been suggested a number of times as a possible reason for the possible decline in flying insects. One study found that air pollution, such as from cars, has been inhibiting the ability of pollinators such as bees and butterflies to find the fragrances of flowers. Pollutants such as ozone, hydroxyl, and nitrate radicals bond quickly with volatile scent molecules of flowers, which consequently travel shorter distances intact. Pollinators must thus travel longer distances to find flowers.

Pollinators may also face an increased risk of extinction because of global warming due to alterations in the seasonal behaviour of species. Climate change can cause bees to emerge at times in the year when flowering plants were not available.

== Consequences ==
Seven out of the ten most important crops in the world, in terms of volume, are pollinated by wind (maize, rice and wheat) or have vegetative propagation (banana, sugar cane, potato, beet, and cassava) and thus do not require animal pollinators for food production. Additionally crops such as sugar beet, spinach and onions are self-pollinating and do not require insects. Nonetheless, an estimated 87.5% of the world&#x27;s flowering plant species are animal-pollinated, and 60% of crop plant species use animal pollinators. This includes the majority of fruits, many vegetables, and also fodder. According to the USDA 80% of insect crop pollination in the US is due to honey bees.

A study which examined how fifteen plant species said to be dependent on animals for pollination would be impacted by pollinator decline, by excluding pollinators from them with domes, found that while most species do not suffer any impacts from decline in terms of reduced fertilization rates (seed set), three species did.

The expected direct reduction in total agricultural production in the US in the absence of animal pollination is expected to be 3 to 8%, with smaller impacts on agricultural production diversity. Of all the possible consequences, the most important effect of pollinator decline for humans in Brazil, according to one 2016 study, would be the drop in income from high-value cash crops, and would impact the agricultural sector the most. A 2000 study about the economic effects of the honey bee on US food crops calculated that it helped to produce US$14.6 billion in monetary value. In 2009 another study calculated the worldwide value of the 100 crops that need pollinators at €153 billion (not including production costs). Despite the dire predictions, the theorised decline in pollinators has had no effect on food production, with yields of both animal-pollinated and non-animal-pollinated crops increasing at the same rate, over the period of supposed pollinator decline.

=== Possible nutritional consequences ===
A 2015 study looked at the nutritional consequences of pollinator decline. It investigated if four third world populations might in the future potentially be at possible risk of malnutrition, assuming humans did not change their diet or have access to supplements, but concluded that this cannot be reliably predicted. According to their model, the size of the effect that pollinator decline had on a population depends on the local diet, and vitamin A is the most likely nutrient to become deficient, as it is already deficient.

More studies also identified vitamin A as the most pollinator-dependent nutrient. Another 2015 study also modeled what would happen should 100% of pollinators die off. In that scenario, 71 million people in low-income countries would become deficient in vitamin A, and the vitamin A intake of 2.2 billion people who are already consuming less than the recommended amount would further decline. Similarly, 173 million people would become deficient in folate, and 1.23 million people would further lessen their intake. Additionally, the global fruit supply would decrease by 22.9%, the global vegetable supply would decrease by 16.3%, and the global supply of nuts and seeds would decrease by 22.1%. This would lead to 1.42 million additional deaths each year from diseases, as well as 27 million disability-adjusted life years. In a less extreme scenario wherein only 50% of pollinators die off, 700,000 additional deaths would occur each year, as well as 13.2 million disability-adjusted years.

One study estimated that 70% of dietary vitamin A worldwide is found in crops that are animal pollinated, as well as 55% of folate. At present, eating plants which are pollinated by animals is responsible for only 9%, 20%, and 29% of calcium, fluoride, and iron intake, respectively, with most coming from meat and dairy. 74% of all globally produced lipids are found in oils from plants that are animal pollinated, as well as 98% of vitamin C.

== Solutions ==
Several scholars have called for application of the precautionary principle.

Efforts are being made to sustain pollinator diversity in agricultural and natural ecosystems by some environmental groups. In 2014 the Obama administration published &quot;the Economic Challenge Posed by Declining Pollinator Populations&quot; fact sheet, which stated that the 2015 budget proposal recommended congress appropriate approximately $50 million for pollinator habitat maintenance and to double the area in the Conservation Reserve Program dedicated to pollinator health, as well as recommending to &quot;increase funding for surveys to determine the impacts on pollinator losses&quot;.

Some international initiatives highlight the need for public participation and awareness of pollinator conservation. Pollinators and their health have become growing concerns for the public. Around 18 states within America have responded to these concerns by creating legislation to address the issue. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, the enacted legislation in those states addresses five specific areas relating to pollinator decline: awareness, research, pesticides, habitat protection and beekeeping.

A 2021 global assessment of the drivers of pollinator decline found that &quot;global policy responses should focus on reducing pressure from changes in land cover and configuration, land management and pesticides, as these were considered very important drivers in most regions&quot;.

<doc id="343616" wikidata="Q701326" url="?curid=343616" title="Zhang Liang (Western Han)">
<text>:&quot;Note: In this article, to distinguish between the Han state of the Warring States period and the Han dynasty, the former is referred to as &quot;Hán&quot; while &quot;Han&quot; is reserved for the latter.&quot;


Zhang Liang ( 251 BC – 189 BC), courtesy name Zifang, was a Chinese military strategist and politician who lived in the early Western Han dynasty. He is also known as one of the &quot;Three Heroes of the early Han dynasty&quot; (), along with Han Xin () and Xiao He. Zhang Liang contributed greatly to the establishment of the Han dynasty. After his death, he was honoured with the posthumous title &quot;Marquis Wencheng&quot; by Emperor Qianshao. Zhang Liang is depicted in the Wu Shuang Pu (無雙譜, Table of Peerless Heroes) by Jin Guliang.

==Early life==
Zhang Liang was born in Xinzheng (新鄭; present-day Zhengzhou, Henan), the capital of the Hán state (), while his ancestral home was in Chengfu (城父; present-day Chengfu Town, Bozhou, Anhui). He descended from an aristocrat family in Hán. His grandfather served three generations of the Hán rulers as chancellors while his father served two generations. Zhang Liang missed the opportunity to inherit his family&#x27;s legacy as the Hán state was annexed by the Qin state in 230 BC as part of Qin&#x27;s wars of unification.

== As a fugitive ==
=== Assassination attempt on Qin Emperor ===
To avenge the fall of his native state, Zhang Liang dedicated his efforts to hiring assassins to kill the First Emperor of Qin. He spent his entire family fortune and failed to give his deceased younger brother a proper funeral. He managed to find a man with great physical strength to help him, and had an iron hammer weighing 120 &quot;catties&quot; (roughly 160 lbs. or 72 kg) forged for the strongman. In 218 BC, Zhang Liang heard that the emperor was going to Yangwu County (east of present-day Yuanyang County, Henan) as part of his inspection tour, and was due to pass by Bolangsha during the journey.

Zhang Liang and the strongman lay in ambush at Bolangsha and waited for the emperor&#x27;s convoy to approach. They saw that all the carriages that passed by were pulled by four horses and believed that the most decorated one in the middle was the emperor&#x27;s personal carriage. The strongman hurled the hammer towards it, and the heavy projectile hit and crushed the carriage, killing its occupants. Zhang Liang fled from the scene during the ensuing chaos. However, the First Emperor was actually in the neighboring carriage and survived the assassination attempt, after which he ordered a massive manhunt for Zhang Liang. Zhang Liang eluded the dragnet for ten days by using fake identities.

===Meeting Huang Shigong===

As a wanted fugitive by the Qin government, Zhang Liang travelled to Xiapi and stayed there for some time, using fake identities to evade the authorities. One day, Zhang Liang took a stroll at Yishui Bridge and met an old man there. The man walked towards Zhang Liang and chucked his shoe down the bridge on purpose, after which he yelled at Zhang, &quot;Hey boy, go down and fetch me my shoe!&quot; Zhang Liang was astonished and offended, but obeyed silently out of courtesy. The old man then lifted his foot and ordered Zhang Liang to put on the shoe for him. Zhang Liang was furious but he controlled his temper and meekly obliged. The man did not show any sign of gratitude and walked away laughing.

As Zhang was brooding over the insult, the old man came back after walking a short distance and praised him, &quot;This child can be taught!&quot; He then told Zhang Liang to meet him at dawn at the bridge again in five days. Zhang Liang was confused but agreed. Five days later, Zhang Liang rushed to the bridge at the stroke of dawn but the old man was already waiting for him there. The old man chided him, &quot;How can you be late for a meeting with an elderly man? Come back again five days later!&quot; Zhang Liang tried his best to be punctual the second time but the old man still arrived earlier than him, and he was scorned once more and told to return again five days later. The third time, Zhang Liang went to the bridge at midnight and waited until the old man appeared. This time, the old man was impressed with Zhang Liang&#x27;s fortitude and humility, that he presented Zhang with a book, saying, &quot;You can become the tutor of a ruler after reading this book. Within ten years, the world will become chaotic. You can then use your knowledge from this book to bring peace and prosperity to the empire. Meet me again 13 years later. I&#x27;m the yellow rock at the foot of Mount Gucheng.&quot;

The old man was Huang Shigong (黃石公; lit. &quot;Yellow Rock Old Man&quot;) . The book was titled &quot;The Art of War by Taigong&quot; () and believed to be the &quot;Six Secret Teachings&quot; by Jiang Ziya, while some called it &quot;Three Strategies of Huang Shigong&quot;. In legend, Zhang Liang returned to the indicated site 13 years later and did see a yellow rock there. He built a shrine to worship the rock and the rock was buried with him after his death.

It is also said that Huang Shigong wrote the Lingqijing divination manual which was also given to Zhang Liang.

==Rebelling against the Qin dynasty==
In 209 BC, during the reign of Qin Er Shi, several uprisings erupted throughout China to overthrow the Qin dynasty. Many of these rebel forces claimed to be restoring the former states that were annexed by Qin two decades ago. Zhang Liang rallied about 100 men to start a rebellion as well, but his force was too weak, so he led his followers to join Jing Ju, a pretender to the throne of the former Chu state. He met Liu Bang during his journey and was impressed with Liu&#x27;s charisma that he changed his decision and joined Liu instead. Zhang Liang became a temporary advisor to Liu Bang and followed Liu to join Xiang Liang&#x27;s rebel force.

The following year, Xiang Liang installed Mi Xin as King Huai II of Chu after eliminating Jing Ju. Zhang Liang&#x27;s main goal was to reestablish his native state of Hán, so he managed to persuade Xiang Liang to do the same for the Hán state. Han Cheng, a descendant of the royal family of Hán, was enthroned as King of Hán, while Zhang Liang was appointed as the Hán&#x27;s chancellor. Han Cheng&#x27;s armies attempted to capture Qin cities that were formerly Hán territories but did not achieve much success and engaged in guerrilla warfare for about a year. Later that year, Xiang Liang was killed in action at the Battle of Dingtao and King Huai II put Xiang Yu (Xiang Liang&#x27;s nephew) and Liu Bang each in charge of an army to attack Qin, promising that whoever entered Guanzhong (heartland of Qin) first would be conferred the title of &quot;King of Guanzhong&quot;.

In 207 BC, the combined forces of Liu Bang and Han Cheng conquered Yangzhai (present-day Yuzhou City, Henan), the former capital of the Hán state. Han Cheng stayed behind to defend Yangzhai, while Zhang Liang served as a temporary advisor to Liu Bang. Zhang Liang contributed to Liu Bang&#x27;s eventual victory in the race to Guanzhong for the strategies he proposed. For example, at the battle of Yao Pass, Zhang Liang suggested tricking the Qin commander into surrendering by bribing him with gifts. Liu Bang wanted to accept the surrendered Qin troops into his army but Zhang Liang cautioned him, saying that some of the troops were unwilling to surrender even though their commander agreed. That night, Liu Bang&#x27;s forces caught the Qin army off guard and scored a major victory. In another incident, Zhang Liang warned Liu Bang against making a detour at Wancheng, because they would be at risk of being surrounded by the enemy if Liu did so.

==Chu–Han Contention==
===Feast at Hong Gate===
Upon entering the Epang Palace in Xianyang (the Qin capital), Liu Bang was strongly tempted by the riches it housed and wanted to stay there forever. Zhang Liang reminded Liu Bang about overindulgence in sensual pleasures and Liu ordered his men to seal the treasures and move to Bashang to wait for Xiang Yu and the other rebel forces to arrive. During this period of time, Liu Bang heeded Zhang Liang&#x27;s advice and governed Guanzhong with benevolence, restoring peace and stability, and forbidding his men from pillaging the cities and harming the common people.

In 206 BC, Xiang Yu&#x27;s army arrived at Hangu Pass (eastern gateway to Guanzhong) and Liu ordered his men to prevent Xiang&#x27;s forces from entering Guanzhong. Xiang Yu was furious when he learnt that Liu Bang had beat him in the race to Guanzhong, and he wanted to kill Liu after being instigated by Fan Zeng and a defector from Liu&#x27;s side, Cao Wushang. Xiang Yu&#x27;s uncle, Xiang Bo, was an old friend of Zhang Liang and he secretly warned Zhang that Xiang Yu was planning to attack Liu Bang. Liu Bang was shocked and fearful when he heard that, as his forces were too weak to counter Xiang Yu. Zhang Liang advised Liu Bang to attend the Feast at Hong Gate hosted by Xiang Yu, to put Xiang off guard and dismiss Xiang&#x27;s suspicions that Liu was intending to oppose him. With help from Xiang Bo, Liu Bang managed to survive the dangerous banquet and Xiang Yu dismissed the idea of killing Liu. However, Fan Zeng was dissatisfied and he asked Xiang Yu&#x27;s cousin Xiang Zhuang to pretend to perform a sword dance and use the opportunity to kill Liu Bang. Xiang Bo intervened again and saved Liu Bang&#x27;s life.

Meanwhile, Zhang Liang left the tent to find Fan Kuai to save Liu Bang. Following Zhang Liang&#x27;s instructions, Fan Kuai burst in and openly chided Xiang Yu, making a speech about Liu Bang&#x27;s accomplishments and affirming that Liu had no intention of opposing Xiang Yu. Liu Bang left the banquet later on the pretext of going to the latrine and was received by Xiahou Ying, who had been waiting nearby on Zhang Liang&#x27;s instruction. Zhang Liang remained behind to hold Xiang Yu&#x27;s attention while Liu Bang escaped. Before leaving, Zhang Liang presented Xiang Yu and Fan Zeng with a pair of jade pieces.

===Eighteen Kingdoms===
Xiang Yu split the former Qin Empire into the Eighteen Kingdoms later, granting the land of Guanzhong to three surrendered Qin generals, even though Guanzhong was rightfully Liu Bang&#x27;s, according to King Huai II&#x27;s earlier promise. Liu Bang was relocated to the remote Bashu region (in present-day Sichuan) instead and granted the title of &quot;King of Han&quot;. Han Cheng retained his rulership as King of Hán and Zhang Liang was moved from Liu Bang&#x27;s side back to Hán to continue serving as chancellor. Before parting ways, Liu Bang presented Zhang Liang with some gold and pearls, all of which Zhang gave to Xiang Bo. Zhang Liang also urged Liu Bang to destroy the gallery roads leading to Bashu during the journey to Hanzhong, in order to reduce Xiang Yu&#x27;s suspicions that Liu was planning to return and challenge him.

Although Han Cheng was the king of Hán, Xiang Yu did not permit him to govern his kingdom and forced him to accompany him back to his Western Chu&#x27;s capital of Pengcheng (present-day Xuzhou, Jiangsu). Han Cheng was demoted to &quot;Marquis of Rang&quot; later and killed on Xiang Yu&#x27;s orders. Xiang Yu seized Han Cheng&#x27;s kingdom and made his subordinate Zheng Chang the new King of Hán. Zhang Liang was still the chancellor of Hán under the new arrangement but he was aware of his precarious position, and cognisant of how Xiang Yu had destroyed his hope of restoring the Hán state. Zhang Liang fled from Hán later and returned to join Liu Bang in the winter of 206 BC. Liu Bang conferred on Zhang Liang the title of &quot;Marquis of Chengxin&quot; and Zhang became a permanent advisor to Liu from that time.

===Conquest of the Three Qin and Battle of Pengcheng===
Starting in 206 BC, after Liu Bang&#x27;s forces conquered the Three Qins, Liu Bang and Xiang Yu engaged in a four-year-long power struggle for supremacy over China, historically known as the Chu–Han Contention. In 205 BC, Liu Bang was defeated by Xiang Yu at the Battle of Pengcheng and he retreated to Xiayi. Zhang Liang proposed a strategy to Liu Bang to counter Xiang Yu, known as the &quot;Xiayi Plan&quot; (). Liu Bang followed Zhang Liang&#x27;s advice: he sent Xiao He to persuade Ying Bu to join him; contacted Peng Yue and allied with him; and allowed Han Xin to lead part of his army to attack other territories on the northern front.

In 204 BC, Liu Bang was trapped by Xiang Yu in Xingyang and both sides reached a stalemate. Li Yiji suggested to Liu Bang to recreate the former states of the Warring States period and install the descendants of their royal families on their respective thrones. This plan was intended to help Liu Bang gain the support of the vassal states&#x27; rulers, who would help him in the war against Xiang Yu. However, Zhang Liang disapproved of the plan as he felt that the states were more likely to support Western Chu instead as Chu was superior to Han in terms of military might. Liu Bang realised the problem and immediately dismissed Li Yiji&#x27;s plan.

In 203 BC, after his victory at the Battle of Wei River, Han Xin conquered the Qi kingdom and sent a messenger to Liu Bang, requesting that Liu appoint him as the acting King of Qi. Liu was still trapped at Xingyang then and he was furious after hearing the request because he was expecting Han Xin to come to his aid. Zhang Liang reminded Liu Bang that if he refused to approve Han Xin&#x27;s request, Han might be discontented and declare independence from Liu, putting them in a dangerous situation. Liu Bang reluctantly agreed and sent Zhang Liang to pass the king&#x27;s seal to Han Xin. Zhang Liang met Han Xin and succeeded in reaffirming Han&#x27;s loyalty to Liu Bang.

===Battle of Gaixia===
By late 203 BC, Zhang Liang saw that the tide had turned in favour of Liu Bang, as Xiang Yu had been surrounded on three sides. Together with Chen Ping, Zhang Liang suggested to Liu Bang to renounce the Treaty of Hong Canal and use the opportunity to eliminate Western Chu. However, at the Battle of Guling, Liu Bang was defeated by Xiang Yu because the expected reinforcements from Han Xin and Peng Yue did not arrive. Zhang Liang explained to Liu Bang that Han Xin and Peng Yue did not mobilise their troops because they did not have their fiefs yet, even though they had received their titles of vassal kings. Liu Bang followed Zhang Liang&#x27;s advice and granted lands to Han Xin and Peng Yue. Two months later, as Zhang Liang predicted, Han Xin and Peng Yue arrived with their armies and formed a coordinated attack on Western Chu together with Liu Bang&#x27;s force, defeating Xiang Yu at the Battle of Gaixia in 202 BC.

==In service during the Han dynasty==

In 202 BC, after his victory over Xiang Yu, Liu Bang ascended the throne and became historically known as &quot;Emperor Gaozu of Han&quot;. Following the establishment of the Han dynasty, Zhang Liang remained as a key advisor to Gaozu even though he did not receive any formal appointment as a government minister. Together with Lou Jing, Zhang Liang later suggested for Gaozu to build his capital in Chang&#x27;an instead of Luoyang, as Chang&#x27;an was in a more strategic position than Luoyang (fertile land and surrounded by natural defences such as mountain passes). Once, Gaozu noticed that some of his subjects were having a secret discussion and he asked for Zhang Liang&#x27;s opinion. Zhang Liang told Gaozu that they were plotting a rebellion and Gaozu was shocked. Zhang Liang proceeded to ask Gaozu whom of all his subjects he hated the most. Gaozu mentioned Yong Chi, who had rebelled against him before but surrendered later. Zhang Liang then suggested to Gaozu to grant Yong Chi a noble title, because if the others saw that Gaozu was able to forgive Yong Chi, they would be at ease and would not think of rebelling.

Subsequently, Zhang Liang retired from state affairs and practised Taoism. In late 201 BC, Gaozu rewarded his subjects who contributed to the dynasty&#x27;s founding and he conferred the title of &quot;Marquis of Liu&quot; on Zhang Liang. In 196 BC, Gaozu left to suppress a rebellion by Ying Bu, and requested Zhang Liang to come out of retirement to assist the crown prince, Liu Ying, in governing the home territories. After returning from the campaign, Gaozu wanted to replace Liu Ying with Liu Ruyi, the Prince of Zhao. Zhang Liang opposed Gaozu&#x27;s decision but Gaozu ignored him so Zhang feigned illness and retired again. When approached by Empress Lü Zhi to help Liu Ying retain his position, Zhang Liang recommended the Four Whiteheads of Mount Shang to help Liu Ying, and the four men succeeded in convincing Gaozu to keep Liu Ying as the crown prince. Zhang Liang remained in retirement until his death in 189 BC.

==Death and burial place==
Little is known about Zhang Liang&#x27;s later life; hence, his final resting place has been a mystery throughout history.

A Zhang Liang Tomb stands at 6 km southwest of present-day Lankao County, Henan. According to legend, during the Lü Clan Disturbance, Zhang Liang moved to Mount Baiyun at the southwest of Donghun County (present-day Lankao County, Henan), and was buried there after his death. A Zhang Liang Temple used to stand beside the tomb, but it was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution.

Another Zhang Liang Tomb stands south of Weishan County, Shandong. The stone tablet in front of the grave bearing Zhang Liang&#x27;s name was erected in 1737 during the Qing dynasty. A Zhang Liang Shrine also used to stand east of the tomb, but it was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution.

However, some believed that Zhang Liang&#x27;s tomb was in present-day Pei County, Xuzhou. According to the 7th-century gazetteer &quot;Kuodi Zhi&quot;, Zhang Liang&#x27;s tomb was 65 &quot;li&quot; east of Pei County, near Liucheng, where a Zhang Liang Temple was also located.

According to &quot;Xianshizhi&quot; () and &quot;Lingmuzhi&quot; (), Zhang Liang&#x27;s tomb was at Mount Qingyan in Hunan.

==Zhang Liang and Taoism==
According to the &quot;Collection of Lost Records of Immortals&quot; (仙传拾遗), after Zhang Liang helped Liu Bang establish the Han dynasty, he practiced self-cultivation using the book given to him by Huang Shigong. He refined his qi, stopped eating, and his body became light, ultimately ascending to heaven and becoming the Taixuan Tongzi. He often followed the Taishang Laojun in the Taiqing realm. His eighth-generation grandson, Zhang Daoling, also achieved the status of a Taoist immortal.

According to the &quot;Chao County Chronicle&quot; (巢县志), there is a Zifang Cave on Baiyun Mountain in Chao County. It is said to be the place where Zhang Liang went into seclusion, practicing fasting and meditation. Later generations built a temple there, offering incense to him every year.

The Tianshou Temple in Chen County (now southeast of Kaifeng, Henan Province) is another place where Zhang Liang is worshipped. During the Song dynasty, in the Zhenghe period (1111–1118), he was granted the title of &quot;Lingxu Zhenren&quot;.

==Story in &quot;Journey to the West&quot;==
In the 16th-century Chinese novel &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, there is a mention of his encounter with Huang Shigong. When Sun Wukong found himself in a heated argument with his master, Tang Sanzang, he decided to part ways and soar through the realms. Upon reaching the East Sea, he received an invitation from the Dragon King of the East Sea. Inside the palace, a painting titled &quot;Three Entrances to the Bridge&quot; caught his eye. He inquired about its meaning, prompting the Dragon King to tell a tale.

The Dragon King recounted, &quot;At the end of the Qin dynasty, Zhang Liang encountered Huang Shigong on a bridge. To gauge his potential, Huang Shigong deliberately knocked off his shoe three times, each time falling beneath the bridge, testing Zhang Liang&#x27;s patience. Though tempted to anger, Zhang Liang maintained respect for the elder. Impressed by his diligence, Huang Shigong secretly imparted a heavenly book to him under the cover of night. This knowledge later enabled Zhang Liang to assist Liu Bang in establishing the Han dynasty. After achieving peace, Zhang Liang relinquished his position, retreated to the mountains, embraced the Daoist path, and ultimately attained immortality.&quot;

Concluding the tale, the Dragon King advised Sun Wukong, stating, &quot;The Great Sage, if you do not protect Tang Sanzang and heed his guidance, you will not attain enlightenment and will remain merely a demon. Return to your master.&quot; Moved by the story, Sun Wukong returned to Tang Sanzang&#x27;s side.

==Modern references==

Zhang Liang&#x27;s encounter with Huang Shigong had also become one of the classic Chinese folk tales about humility for later generations to learn from.

Zhang Liang is one of the 32 historical figures who appear as special characters in the video game &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms XI&quot; by Koei. He has higher intelligence stats than all these characters, except for Jiang Ziya. Zhang Liang is also a playable character of the &quot;Wizard&quot; class in the action RPG &quot;Prince of Qin&quot;.

Zhang Liang has been portrayed in various media set in the Chu–Han Contention, such as The Great Conqueror&#x27;s Concubine, and The Last Supper, and Han&#x27;s third assassination attempt before he became the Emperor in The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor. He appears in the 2012 television series King&#x27;s War. He also appears as a character in the animation series &quot;The Legend of Qin&quot;.

<doc id="343618" wikidata="Q7316" url="?curid=343618" title="Emperor Xian of Han">
<text>Emperor Xian of Han (2 April 181 – 21 April 234), personal name Liu Xie (劉協), courtesy name Bohe, was the 14th and last emperor of the Eastern Han dynasty in China. He reigned from 28 September 189 until 11 December 220.

Liu Xie was a son of Liu Hong (Emperor Ling) and was a younger half-brother of his predecessor, Liu Bian (Emperor Shao). In 189, at the age of eight, he became emperor after the warlord Dong Zhuo, who had seized control of the Han central government, deposed Emperor Shao and replaced him with Liu Xie. The newly enthroned Liu Xie, historically known as Emperor Xian, was in fact a puppet ruler under Dong Zhuo&#x27;s control. In 190, when a coalition of regional warlords launched a punitive campaign against Dong Zhuo in the name of freeing Emperor Xian, Dong Zhuo ordered the destruction of the imperial capital, Luoyang, and forcefully relocated the imperial capital along with its residents to Chang&#x27;an. After Dong Zhuo&#x27;s assassination in 192, Emperor Xian fell under the control of Li Jue and Guo Si, two former subordinates of Dong Zhuo. The various regional warlords formally acknowledged Emperor Xian&#x27;s legitimacy but never took action to save him from being held hostage.

In 195, Emperor Xian managed to escape from Chang&#x27;an and return to the ruins of Luoyang during a feud between Li Jue and Guo Si, where he soon became stranded. A year later, the warlord Cao Cao led his forces into Luoyang, received Emperor Xian, took him under his protection, and escorted him to Xu, where the new imperial capital was established. Although Cao Cao paid nominal allegiance to Emperor Xian, he was actually the &quot;de facto&quot; head of the central government. He skillfully used Emperor Xian as a &quot;trump card&quot; to bolster his legitimacy when he attacked and eliminated rival warlords in his quest to reunify the Han Empire under the central government&#x27;s rule. Cao Cao&#x27;s success seemed inevitable until the winter of 208–209, when he lost the decisive Battle of Red Cliffs against the southern warlords Sun Quan and Liu Bei. The battle paved the way for the subsequent emergence of the Three Kingdoms of Wei, Shu, and Wu.

In late 220, some months after Cao Cao&#x27;s death, Cao Cao&#x27;s successor, Cao Pi, forced Emperor Xian to abdicate the throne to him. He then established the state of Cao Wei with himself as the new emperor – an event marking the formal end of the Han dynasty and the beginning of the Three Kingdoms period in China. The dethroned Emperor Xian received the noble title Duke of [[Shanyang District|Shanyang]] () from Cao Pi and spent the rest of his life in comfort and enjoyed preferential treatment. He died on 21 April 234, about 14 years after the fall of the Han dynasty.

==Family background==

Liu Xie was born in 181 to Emperor Ling and his Consort Wang Rong (王荣). During her pregnancy, Consort Wang, fearful of Emperor Ling&#x27;s Empress He, had taken drugs that were intended to induce an abortion, but was not successful in her attempt. Soon after she gave birth to Liu Xie, the jealous Empress He poisoned her by putting poison in her food. Emperor Ling was enraged and wanted to depose her, but the eunuchs pleaded on her behalf, and she was not deposed. Liu Xie was raised personally by Emperor Ling&#x27;s mother Empress Dowager Dong and known by the circumspect title &quot;Marquis Dong&quot;. (This is due to superstition; Emperor Ling had lost a number of sons previously, and therefore both Liu Xie and his elder half-brother Liu Bian were known by such titles; Liu Bian, having been raised by Shi Zimiao (), was known as &quot;Marquis Shi&quot;). Liu Bian was born of the empress and was older, but Emperor Ling viewed his behaviour as being insufficiently solemn and therefore considered appointing Liu Xie as his crown prince, but hesitated and could not decide.

When Emperor Ling died in 189, an influential eunuch official whom he trusted, Jian Shuo, wanted to first kill Empress He&#x27;s brother, General-in-Chief He Jin, and then install Liu Xie on the throne, and therefore set up a trap at a meeting he was to have with He Jin. He Jin found out, and preemptively declared Liu Bian the new emperor. Later that year, Emperor Shao granted Liu Xie the title &quot;Prince of Bohai&quot; () and later changed his title to &quot;Prince of Chenliu&quot; ().

==Accession to the throne and collapse of the Han dynasty==
===Rise of Dong Zhuo===
After Liu Bian became emperor, He Jin became the most powerful official in the imperial court, and he and his advisor Yuan Shao quickly entered into a conspiracy to exterminate the eunuchs. They were, however, rebuffed by Empress Dowager He, and they hatched the plan to secretly order a number of warlords to advance on the capital Luoyang to force Empress Dowager He to agree to their demands. One of these warlords was Dong Zhuo, who saw this as an opportunity to control the central government.

He Jin&#x27;s plan was discovered by the eunuchs, who laid a trap for him and killed him. Yuan Shao then led his forces into the palace and killed the majority of the eunuchs. The remaining eunuchs initially took the young emperor and Liu Xie hostage, but were eventually forced to commit suicide when the battle turned against them. When Dong Zhuo then arrived on scene, he, impressed with his own power and unimpressed with the nervous Emperor Shao, forced the young emperor to yield the throne to Liu Xie (partly because he was raised by Empress Dowager Dong who, while not related to Dong Zhuo, was therefore respected by Dong Zhuo), who then ascended the throne as Emperor Xian. Dong Zhuo then murdered Empress Dowager He and the former Emperor Shao, and became firmly in control of the political scene.

===Forced relocation west and the death of Dong Zhuo===
In the spring of 190, a number of local officials, loosely forming a coalition led by Yuan Shao, quickly rose up against Dong Zhuo. Even though they still feared Dong Zhuo&#x27;s military power and did not directly advance on Luoyang, Dong Zhuo was also fearful of their collective strength, and therefore determined to move the capital west to the old Han capital Chang&#x27;an, closer to his power base in Liang Province (涼州; covering present-day Gansu). On 9 April 190, he forced Emperor Xian to relocate to Chang&#x27;an and set fire to Luoyang, leaving it largely in ruins.

After the revolting coalition collapsed, a number of officials, led by Wang Yun and Lü Bu, assassinated Dong on 22 May 192. For a while, it appeared that the Han regime might return to normal, as Wang Yun quickly established relatively friendly relations with the local officials resisting Dong but by this time acting more as local warlords. However, due to Wang Yun&#x27;s failure to pacify Dong Zhuo&#x27;s former subordinates, they rose in revolt and killed Wang.

===Return to Luoyang&#x27;s ruins===
Dong Zhuo&#x27;s former subordinates, led by Li Jue and Guo Si, took Emperor Xian and the imperial court under their control. However, Li Jue and Guo Si did not have serious ambitions, and their incompetence in governance furthered the breakdown of the Han Empire into warlord regimes. In 195, Li Jue and Guo Si had a major fallout, and Li took Emperor Xian hostage while Guo took the officials hostage as they battled. Later in the year, after peace talks between Li Jue and Guo Si, they agreed to allow Emperor Xian to return to Luoyang, but as soon as Emperor Xian departed Chang&#x27;an, they regretted their decision and chased him with their troops. While they were never able to capture him, Emperor Xian&#x27;s court was rendered poor and unable to fend for itself, and once it returned to Luoyang, it lacked even the basic essentials of life. Many officials starved to death. At this time, Yuan Shao&#x27;s strategist Ju Shou suggested that he welcome Emperor Xian to his base in Ji Province so that he could effectively be in control of the central government, but the other strategists Guo Tu and Chunyu Qiong opposed – under the faulty logic that if he did, he would have to yield to Emperor Xian on key decisions. Yuan Shao listened to Guo Tu and Chunyu Qiong and never again considered welcoming Emperor Xian.

===Tight control by Cao Cao===
What Yuan Shao would not do, Cao Cao did. Cao Cao was at this time a relatively minor warlord, as the governor of Yan Province (covering present-day western Shandong and eastern Henan), with his headquarters at Xu (present-day Xuchang, Henan). He saw the strategic advantage in having the emperor under his control and protection, and in 196 he marched west to Luoyang and, after securing an agreement with Emperor Xian&#x27;s generals Dong Cheng and Yang Feng, convincing them of his loyalty, he entered Luoyang and technically shared power with Dong and Yang, but was in fact in command.

Unlike the situation with Dong Zhuo, though, Cao Cao knew how to assuage the other generals and nobles, and while he gave them little power, he made sure that they remained honoured, so minimal opposition against him developed at the imperial court. He then moved the capital to Xu to affirm his control over the central government, and when Yang Feng opposed him, he defeated Yang in November 196, and was able to move the capital.

Cao Cao then began to issue imperial edicts in Emperor Xian&#x27;s name – including a harshly-worded edict condemning Yuan Shao for taking over nearby provinces – even though it still bestowed Yuan with the highly honorific post of Grand Commandant. Cao Cao and Emperor Xian maintained a superficially cordial relationship, but this did not prevent two major confrontations involving Cao and other court officials.

In early 199, as Cao Cao was facing a major military confrontation against Yuan Shao, Dong Cheng claimed to have received a secret edict issued by Emperor Xian (hidden in a belt), and he entered into a conspiracy with Liu Bei, Zhong Ji () and Wang Fu () to assassinate Cao Cao. Late in 199, Liu Bei started a rebellion and waited for Dong Cheng to act in the capital, but in 200, Dong&#x27;s conspiracy was discovered, and he, along with Zhong Ji and Wang Fu, were killed. Liu Bei was later defeated by Cao Cao and forced to flee to Yuan Shao&#x27;s territory. Dong Cheng&#x27;s daughter, an imperial consort, was pregnant, and Emperor Xian personally tried to intercede for her, but Cao Cao had her executed anyway.

Emperor Xian&#x27;s empress, Empress Fu Shou, angry and fearful about how Consort Dong died, wrote her father, Fu Wan (), a letter accusing Cao Cao of cruelty, and implicitly asking her father to start a new conspiracy against Cao. Fu Wan was fearful of Cao Cao and never acted on the letter, which was discovered in 214. Cao Cao was angry and forced Emperor Xian to have Empress Fu deposed. Emperor Xian was hesitant, and Cao Cao sent his soldiers into the palace to put pressure on the emperor. Empress Fu hid inside the walls, but was finally discovered and dragged out. As she was led away, she cried out to Emperor Xian for him to save her life, but his only response was that he could not even know what would happen to him. She was killed, along with her two sons and family on 8 January 215. On 6 March 215. Cao Cao forced Emperor Xian to instate his daughter Cao Jie, then an imperial consort, as the new empress.

==Abdication and death==
Cao Cao died on 15 March 220. His son and successor, Cao Pi, soon forced Emperor Xian to abdicate the throne in favour of himself, ending the Han dynasty. Cao Pi established a new state known as Cao Wei, and he granted Emperor Xian a noble title – Duke of Shanyang (), and gave him a fiefdom of 10000 households, with Zhuolucheng (浊鹿城) as the capital. Liu Xie was also ranked above vassal princes, didn&#x27;t have to refer to himself as a subject while speaking to the emperor and didn&#x27;t have to kneel when receiving edicts. The former Emperor Xian died in April 234 and was buried with honours befitting an emperor, using Han ceremonies, and the then emperor of Wei, Cao Rui, was one of the mourners. As Emperor Xian&#x27;s crown prince was already dead, his grandson Liu Kang () inherited his dukedom, which lasted for 73 more years and two more dukes, Liu Jin () and Liu Qiu (). The line was exterminated during the Jin dynasty in June or July 307, when rebel forces led by Ji Sang and Shi Le sacked the city of Ye. This practice of an emperor conferring hereditary nobility on his predecessor, from whom he usurped the throne, was known as &quot;two crownings and three respects&quot;.

<text>Adam&#x27;s Curse: A Future Without Men (also known as Adam&#x27;s Curse: A Story of Sex, Genetics, and the Extinction of Men) is a 2003 book by Oxford University human genetics professor Bryan Sykes expounding his hypothesis that with the declining sperm count in men and the continual atrophy of the Y chromosome, within 5,000 generations (approximately 125,000 years) men shall become extinct.

Sykes thinks one of the options for humanity&#x27;s survival is unisex reproduction by females: female eggs fertilised by the nuclear X chromosomes of another female and implanted using in vitro fertilisation methods. He also introduces the possibility of moving the SRY and associated genes responsible for maleness and male fertility to another chromosome, which he refers to as &quot;the Adonis chromosome&quot;, engendering fertile males with an XX karyotype.

BBC News reported in 2012 that a US study in Nature suggests the genetic decay has all but ended and that &quot;The conclusion from these comparative studies is that genetic decay has in recent history been minimal, with the human chromosome having lost no further genes in the last six million years, and only one in the last 25 million years.&quot;

<doc id="343651" wikidata="Q312668" url="?curid=343651" title="Carlos Mesa">
<text>Carlos Diego de Mesa Gisbert (; born 12 August 1953) is a Bolivian historian, journalist, and politician who served as the 63rd president of Bolivia from 2003 to 2005. As an independent politician, he had previously served as the 37th vice president of Bolivia from 2002 to 2003 under Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada and was the international spokesman for Bolivia&#x27;s lawsuit against Chile in the International Court of Justice from 2014 to 2018. A member of the Revolutionary Left Front, he has served as leader of Civic Community, the largest opposition parliamentary group in Bolivia, since 2018.
Born in La Paz, Mesa began a twenty-three-year-long journalistic career after graduating from university. He rose to national fame in 1983 as the host of &quot;De Cerca&quot;, in which he interviewed prominent figures of Bolivian political and cultural life. His popular appeal led former president Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada of the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (MNR) to invite him to be his running mate in the 2002 presidential election. Though Mesa&#x27;s moderate left-wing sympathies contrasted with centre-right policies of the MNR, he accepted the offer, running as an independent in a hotly contested electoral campaign. The Sánchez de Lozada-Mesa ticket won the election, and, on 6 August, Mesa took charge of a largely ceremonial office that carried with it few formal powers save for guaranteeing the constitutional line of succession. Shortly into his term, conflict between Sánchez de Lozada and Mesa arose. By October 2003, the increasingly tense situation surrounding the ongoing gas conflict caused a definitive break in relations between the president and vice president, leading the latter to announce his withdrawal from government after clashes between protesters and military personnel led to several deaths. Crucially, Mesa opted not to resign from his vice-presidential post and succeeded to the presidency upon Sánchez de Lozada&#x27;s resignation.
Mesa assumed office with broadly popular civic support but leading a government without a party base and devoid of organic parliamentary support left him with little room to maneuver as his public policy proposals were severely restricted by the legislature—controlled by traditional parties and increasingly organized regional and social movements spearheaded by the &quot;cocalero&quot; activist and future president Evo Morales. As promised, he held a national referendum on gas which passed with high margins on all five counts. Nonetheless, widespread dissatisfaction resurged, and his call for a binding referendum on autonomies and the convocation of a constituent assembly to reform the Constitution failed to quell unrest. Mesa resigned in June 2005, though not before ensuring that the heads of the two legislative chambers renounced their succession rights, facilitating the assumption of the non-partisan Supreme Court judge Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé to the presidency. With that, Mesa withdrew from active politics and returned his focus to various media projects and journalistic endeavors. In 2014, despite previous animosity, President Evo Morales appointed him as the international spokesman for the country&#x27;s maritime lawsuit against Chile before the International Court of Justice (ICJ), a position he held until the final ruling at The Hague in 2018.
Mesa&#x27;s work for the maritime cause propelled him back into the national consciousness, and he soon emerged as a viable alternative to Morales as a contender for the presidency, even surpassing the president in electoral preference polls. Shortly after the ruling by the ICJ, Mesa announced his presidential candidacy. In the 2019 election, Mesa was defeated by Morales, who failed to garner a majority but won a wide enough plurality to avoid a runoff. However, irregularities in the preliminary vote tally prompted Mesa to denounce electoral fraud and call for mass demonstrations, ultimately ending in Morales&#x27; resignation and an ensuing political crisis. The following year, snap elections were held, but numerous postponements and an unpopular transitional government hampered Mesa&#x27;s campaign, resulting in a first-round loss to Movement for Socialism (MAS) candidate Luis Arce. Mesa emerged from the election as the head of the largest opposition bloc in a legislature that does not hold a MAS supermajority for the first time in over a decade.

== Early life and career ==
=== Early life and education ===

Carlos Mesa was born on 12 August 1953 in La Paz. Through his father, José de Mesa, he is of Spanish descent; his grandfather, José Mesa Sánchez, emigrated to Bolivia from Alcalá la Real in 1910. Due to his heritage, in 2005, the city&#x27;s council unanimously designated Mesa as the adoptive son of the municipality. His mother, Teresa Gisbert, was of Catalan descent; her father and mother emigrated from Barcelona and Alicante. Together, de Mesa and Gisbert were two of the most prominent Bolivian architects, historians, and museologists of their time. He has three younger siblings: Andrés, Isabel, and Teresa Guiomar.

Between 1959 and 1970, Mesa completed primary and began secondary studies at the all-boys private Catholic and Jesuit San Calixto School in the Següencoma barrio of La Paz. In 1970, he traveled abroad to Spain, completing his high school education at the San Estanislao de Kotska School in Madrid. After graduating, Mesa entered the Complutense University of Madrid, pursuing majors in political science and letters. After three years, he returned to Bolivia, where he enrolled in the Higher University of San Andrés (UMSA), graduating with a degree in literature in 1978. During his stay there, in 1974, he directed the UMSA&#x27;s Faculty of Humanities magazine.

At the age of twenty-two, Mesa married Patricia Flores Soto, though they divorced three years later. Two years after that, on 28 March 1980, he married Elvira Salinas Gamarra, a psychologist and environmental consultant with whom he has two children: Borja Ignacio and Guiomar.

=== Journalistic career ===
==== Film critic and archivist ====
On 12 July 1976, while still a student of the UMSA, Mesa, along with Pedro Susz and Amalia de Gallardo, helped found the Bolivian Cinematheque. With the support of Renzo Cotta of the Center of Cinematographic Orientation and La Paz Mayor Mario Mercado, the group secured a small amount of space on the fifth floor of the La Paz House of Culture in order to start their film archive. The first addition to the collection was a short film directed by Jorge Ruiz Laredo about the violinist Jaime Laredo, which was donated by the pianist Raúl Barragán. Along with Susz, Mesa served as the cinematheque&#x27;s executive director from its foundation until 1985, remaining a member of its board of directors after that.

==== Radio host and producer ====
Mesa&#x27;s first foray into radio occurred in 1969, concomitantly his first journalistic endeavor. Through his father, he secured a three-month internship for Radio Universo, where he would haul portable tape recorders to ministerial press conferences before returning and cutting the recorded material for broadcast use. In 1974, with the help of Universo head Lorenzo Carri, Mesa became the independent producer and host of a program on Radio Méndez. After a brief return to Universo in 1976, Mesa moved on to Radio Metropolitana, where, together with Roberto Melogno, he produced the morning newscast &quot;25 Minutos en el Mundo&quot;. In 1979, Mesa&#x27;s meager cinematheque salary pushed him to seek more dedicated journalistic work. Together with Carri, he joined Radio Cristal, owned by Mario Castro. The pair&#x27;s presentational style evolved from simple news coverage to commentary and analysis and, finally, opinion journalism. Abruptly shuttered by the military government of Luis García Meza, the station was reopened after his fall and, between 1982 and 1985, had grown to become the country&#x27;s top news network.

==== Television presenter ====
After a brief stint as sub-director of the evening periodical &quot;Última Hora&quot; between 1982 and 1983, Mesa made his first television debut. In that period, the only major competition to state outlets came from university television. Channel 13 Televisión Universitaria (TVU), directed by Luis González Quintanilla, played a particularly important role in the country&#x27;s political process. In 1982, amid the country&#x27;s democratic transition and the reopening of independent media, González invited Mesa to a panel on one of TVU&#x27;s programs. Impressed by the young journalist, González called on him to take charge of a culture-themed talk show. Though &quot;Diálogos en Vivo&quot; ran for only three months, it proved to be the basis for what later became the program that spotlighted Mesa as a national television personality.

The name of that program came to be known as &quot;De Cerca&quot;. The concept of the show—formulated by Bolivian National Television officials Julio Barragán and Carlos Soria—combined formal interviews of Bolivian political figures with a section in which recorded questions from ordinary citizens were relayed by the host to the guest. In mid-1983, Mesa was called on to host the show, an offer he &quot;accepted without question&quot;. &quot;De Cerca&quot; premiered on 15 September 1983, with Minister of Planning Roberto Jordan Pando as its first guest. The show premiered at a time of a severe hyperinflation crisis in the country; Mesa&#x27;s salary frequently spent long periods through the bureaucracy of the Ministry of Finance, often being delivered two or three months late. His final payment from the company, delivered in July 1985, totaled b$63.5 million due to inflation.

Save for the eventual removal of prerecorded questions, which Mesa stated &quot;broke the continuity of the program, and also limited the topic of the conversation to excessively circumstantial issues&quot;, the style and presentation of &quot;De Cerca&quot; remained largely unchanged for two decades and between four channels, lending it a sense of &quot;permanence in time&quot;. Throughout its run, the program spotlighted a large majority of the most relevant political actors of the period; to be invited onto the show eventually became a mark of national prominence. Of those interviewed included every president of the country who governed during the show&#x27;s run, as well as some prior ones, with the exception of Víctor Paz Estenssoro and Hernán Siles Zuazo, neither of whom, with few exceptions, ever accepted invitations to any television program. For Mesa, the omission of these two figures was &quot;a great void in &quot;De Cerca&quot; that I will never finish regretting&quot;.

===== Foundation of PAT =====

On 1 August 1990, Mesa, together with fellow journalists Mario Espinoza and Amalia Pando and financially assisted by Ximena Valdivia, launched Associated Journalists Television (&quot;Periodistas Asociados Televisión&quot;; PAT). The concept of the network, then an audiovisual production company, came from the hope of establishing a newscast free of government oversight and censors. Starting from 15 September, PAT began broadcasting public news coverage to the country. In 1992, the government of Jaime Paz Zamora closed the State television company in favor of a contract with PAT, ratified by the succeeding government of Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada. Despite the State&#x27;s financial support, Mesa&#x27;s team of journalists took great care to maintain a level of objectivity in their reporting. Responding to questions regarding bias, Pando admits that both she and Mesa supported many of the policies of Sánchez de Lozada&#x27;s first term but rejects the notion that this constituted &quot;a tie&quot; to the government.

Despite its early success, a compounding set of issues began to mount onto the channel. Viewing the newscast as an outlet for the opposition, the government of Hugo Banzer initiated a boycott. This, coupled with an economic recession and a series of well-done but largely unpopular new programs, sent PAT into a financial crisis. According to Pando, Mesa&#x27;s vice-presidential candidacy had &quot;devastating consequences&quot; for the channel&#x27;s credibility as an independent news source. In 2007, the company was sold to businessman Abdallah Daher, who thereafter sold it to Comercializadora Multimedia del Sur. Only the name remains with the original channel.

==== Press columnist ====
Mesa&#x27;s longest-held editorial post was as a regular contributor to the sports supplements of the morning papers &quot;Hoy&quot;, &quot;Presencia&quot;, &quot;Viva&quot;, and &quot;La Prensa&quot;; he published for these outlets between 1976 and 2002. Between 1979 and 1986, he worked as a film critic for the La Paz prints &quot;Apertura&quot; (1979), &quot;Hoy&quot; (1981–1982), and &quot;Última Hora&quot; (1983–1986). From 2010 to 2017, he remained a regular editor-at-large for the morning newspapers &quot;El Deber&quot;, &quot;El Nuevo Sur&quot;, &quot;El Potosí&quot;, &quot;Correo del Sur&quot;, &quot;La Palabra&quot;, &quot;La Patria&quot;, &quot;Los Tiempos&quot;, &quot;Página Siete&quot;, and &quot;Sol de Pando&quot;. In addition, Mesa has written columns for international outlets such as the Spanish &quot;Diario 16&quot; and &quot;El País&quot;, the American &quot;Foreign Policy&quot;, and Germany&#x27;s &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;.

== Vice presidency (2002–2003) ==
=== Entry into politics ===
As a prominent journalist in the field of politics, the prospect of actually participating in affairs of state was an option often proposed by outside voices but which Mesa—a staunch independent despite his moderate left-wing sympathies—routinely refused to consider. His first experience refusing the call to serve came in 1986 when President Paz Estenssoro invited him to be a component of his cabinet as minister of information. Despite his stated admiration of the president, Mesa declined the offer the following day, citing his perceived inadequacy to hold the position. In the ensuing years, on various occasions, Mesa declined offers by various parties to run for vice president, mayor of La Paz, or senator. In the 1993 election, then-candidate Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada had placed Mesa on a list of pre-candidates for the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (MNR)&#x27;s vice-presidential nomination. The Aymara activist Víctor Hugo Cárdenas was ultimately chosen and elected as the country&#x27;s first indigenous vice president.

=== From no to yes: Mesa accepts ===

With elections set for June 2002, the possibility of being presented as a political candidate was once again laid on Mesa. Seeking a turnaround after its electoral defeat in the 1997 general election, the MNR opted to renominate its national chief, ex-president Sánchez de Lozada, as the party&#x27;s presidential candidate. For his new bid, Sánchez de Lozada surrounded his campaign with American political consultants of the Greenberg Carville Shrum (GCS) strategy group, who employed focus groups and public opinion polls to revitalize his public image. In January, Mesa received a call from the ex-president asking him to meet with members of the GCS team to discuss the results of a recent poll. Mesa&#x27;s suspicions that the subject of the survey would regard political candidates were confirmed when two consultants—Jeremy Rosner and Amy Webber—met him at his office at PAT, presenting the journalist with results showing him with the highest favorability among a list of a dozen national figures.

For Mesa, the festering social conflicts of twenty-first-century Bolivia necessitated a political renewal: &quot;Paz Zamora and Sánchez de Lozada were history, their political cycle had finished, and they were prolonging it artificially and unnecessarily&quot;. If he were to become a contestant in electoral politics, he reasoned, it would be under a movement of his own design and certainly not as vice president, a post he described as &quot;the stupidest position of all... An office with a single objective, that of succession, with few clear powers&quot;. In meetings with Sánchez de Lozada, Mesa expressed this point, emphasizing that the MNR required younger generations among its ranks and suggesting himself as a possible alternative presidential candidate, an idea that the MNR shot down due to his political and economic inexperience.

Among other considerations for Mesa were the notion of ending an almost twenty-five-year career in journalism—including the abandonment of PAT—and the perceived adverse effects assuming the vice presidency would have on his family. For these reasons, on 31 January, Mesa informed Sánchez de Lozada that he would not join the ex-president as his running mate. Two days later, however, Mesa was called to one last meeting with Carlos Sánchez Berzaín, the MNR&#x27;s campaign manager, who outlined three final arguments for consideration: Sánchez de Lozada was the only candidate with the capacity to alleviate the ongoing economic crisis; Mesa could not continue in his comfortable position commentating on the sidelines of politics; the MNR&#x27;s campaign team considered the inclusion or exclusion of Mesa as the deciding factor in the party&#x27;s electoral outcome. It was either &quot;with me or with me... [and] everything else was a disaster&quot;. These points renewed doubts in Mesa, who, ultimately, apprehensively accepted the invitation just a day before the National Convention of the MNR was set to announce its presidential binomial.

==== The PAT factor ====
According to Mauricio Balcázar—former minister and son-in-law to Sánchez de Lozada—the MNR paid Mesa over US$800,000 in ten installments between the 2002 campaign and October 2003 in exchange for his vice-presidential candidacy. As alleged by Balcázar, on the day of the MNR Convention, Mesa demanded the payment and an initial guarantee check of US$200,000 for his television channel PAT, threatening to withdraw his nomination if the party did not comply. For Balcázar, this constituted &quot;extortion&quot;—although he did not realize it at the time—because the MNR had no time to seek an alternative candidate. An investigation carried out by analyst Carlos Valverde uncovered documents proving deposits totaling Bs6 million (US$831,454) into the bank account of PAT starting in mid-2002 and ending in October 2003. A majority of the transactions were recorded as loans to PAT by the Itaca company, the owner of ninety-nine percent of the channel&#x27;s share quotas; in effect, a self-grant that raised money laundering concerns. For his part, Mesa refused to make a definitive statement on the allegations during his 2019 presidential bid, asserting that he would not respond to the &quot;dirty war&quot; being waged by his electoral opponents. At the same time, he affirmed that it was &quot;based on false testimonies, on false investigations, and on the fact that, if it was an irregular act, it was carried out more than sixteen years ago&quot;.

==== 2002 general election ====

The MNR closed its Extraordinary National Convention on 3 February with the announcement of Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada as the party&#x27;s presidential candidate, accompanied by Carlos Mesa as his non-partisan running mate. Accepting the nomination, Mesa cited resolving the economic crisis and fighting institutional corruption as the main factors in his decision to join the electoral binomial. At first glance, election day on 30 June yielded an electoral victory for the Sánchez de Lozada-Mesa ticket amid a well-conducted and orderly process, generally accepted by the contending parties and their supporters. But with a plurality of just 22.5 percent, the MNR emerged as the only traditional party that could claim a modicum of popular support. Second and third place, respectively, went to the Movement for Socialism (MAS-IPSP) of the indigenous &quot;cocalero&quot; activist Evo Morales and the New Republican Force (NFR) of Cochabamba Mayor Manfred Reyes Villa; each of them took a twenty percent share of the vote. Paz Zamora&#x27;s Revolutionary Left Movement (MIR) came fourth with 16.3 percent, while Nationalist Democratic Action (ADN)—the party holding the incumbent presidency—did not even reach four percent. The blow to the country&#x27;s traditional party system resulted in a tense runoff in which Sánchez de Lozada was forced to form an unlikely coalition with Paz Zamora in order to shore up a majority of congressional support. With eighty-four votes in their favor, Congress elected Sánchez de Lozada and Mesa as the constitutional president and vice president on 4 August, taking office two days later.

=== A frustrated vice presidency ===
==== The fight against corruption ====

In keeping with his campaign promise to make fighting corruption the central point of his administration, Mesa, on 11 August 2002, launched the Technical Unit against Corruption under the leadership of the journalist Lupe Cajías. The unit was set as a component of the Vice Presidency, operating independently of the Prosecutor&#x27;s Office. In addition to Cajías, it was composed of a &quot;petite cabinet&quot; consisting of José Galindo, Jorge Cortés, and Alfonso Ferrufino. On 12 August 2003, the post was refounded as the Secretariat of the Fight against Corruption, which Mesa credited to be &quot;without doubt the greatest contribution of my [vice presidential] management&quot;. Two days after his assumption to the presidency, Mesa elevated the secretariat to the high executive level as the Presidential Anticorruption Delegation.

Mesa&#x27;s anti-corruption efforts were not without criticism. A year into her administration, Cajías admitted that her team had &quot;barely scratched corruption&quot; and that the post suffered &quot;structural issues&quot;. One such issue was the lack of coordination between the secretariat and other parts of the judicial system; prosecutors annulled various cases presented by her office, and the ambiguity of the office&#x27;s functions eventually relegated it to issuing opinions and periodically publishing public reports on alleged acts of corruption.

Mesa attributed many of the shortfalls of his anti-corruption work to a lack of cooperation from the president. One example came in July 2003 when Secretary Cajías issued Report N° 13. A contingent of conscripts and 180 soldiers of the Bolivian Army had been illegally forced to work harvesting Macororó on the Santa Monica farm in the Chiquitos Province of Santa Cruz for no wage and in conditions of general servitude. The case implicated Minister of Defense Freddy Teodovich and Santa Cruz Prefect Mario Justiniano. For this reason, on 10 July, Mesa met with Sánchez de Lozada to request the dismissal of Teodovich, an action the president refused to take because the minister was an influential component of the cabinet and the MNR. Mesa considered this a revocation of the president&#x27;s promise to allow him to freely take anti-corruption measures, and the incident served to aggravate festering grievances between the two.

==== Black February ====

February 2003 presented the first significant ordeal that shook Mesa&#x27;s confidence in the government. On the ninth, President Sánchez de Lozada, under pressure from the International Monetary Fund to significantly reduce the country&#x27;s fiscal deficit, presented a new tax bill that, among other factors, imposed a salary tax on workers making a certain threshold of income. The response was near-universal outrage and a series of protests that after a few days were joined by the National Police Corps. Given the absence of law enforcement, the demonstrations quickly devolved into riots, which eventually forced government officials to flee their offices. In his account of events, Mesa states that &quot;what I saw was hell&quot;. At 5:00 p.m. on 12 February, Mesa, sequestered at the president&#x27;s private residence, was informed that the Vice Presidency had been set aflame by vandals, an action he describes as &quot;my apocalypse&quot;. &quot;It seemed to me that all the illusions of public service I promised on 6 August upon taking office were shattered&quot;.

=== Black October: Mesa pulls out ===
By September, the simmering popular grievances of the time, mainly related to the export of natural gas to the United States through Chile, had ignited into nationwide social unrest. On 12 October, Mesa arrived in La Paz for a meeting with the president, flying in by helicopter due to the ongoing blockades making accessing the capital by land impossible. At 1:34 p.m., Mesa ate lunch with Sánchez de Lozada at the presidential residence in San Jorge, where he pleaded with the president to call a referendum on gas and open up the possibility of a constituent assembly. Sánchez de Lozada, whom Mesa describes as &quot;the most stubborn man I have ever met&quot;, remained steadfast in his refusal to give in to social demands, causing the vice president to snap at him that &quot;the dead are going to bury you&quot;. Amid their heated discussion, the government&#x27;s bloody suppression of demonstrations in El Alto began to count its first deaths. Reports of the massacre of protesters, which Mesa learned from the media, definitively ruptured relations between him and Sánchez de Lozada. The following day, the vice president publicly withdrew his support for the government. In his statement, Mesa outlined that the cost of human lives was something that his &quot;conscience as a human being cannot tolerate&quot;, and he implored the government to &quot;seek a position of dialogue and establish peace&quot;. At a press conference held three days later, he ratified his refusal to cooperate, stating: &quot;I do not have the courage to kill, nor will I have the courage to kill tomorrow. For that reason, it is impossible to think about my return to government&quot;.

Between the thirteenth and the seventeenth, Mesa withdrew to his private residence. Crucially, however, he determined not to resign from the vice presidency. He later recounted that the decision came from his memory of the 2001 crisis in Argentina. During that time, President Fernando de la Rúa resigned, causing a crisis of succession because Vice President Carlos Álvarez, in protest, had vacated the office the year prior. According to Mesa: &quot;If there was any value in the position, I thought, it was precisely guaranteeing democratic continuity in extreme cases&quot;.

Mesa&#x27;s decision was met with harsh criticism by sectors still loyal to Sánchez de Lozada. Among the leadership of the MNR, it was made clear that the party was &quot;upset with Mr. Carlos Mesa&quot;, while legislators of the MIR accused him of failing to fulfill his duty as a mediator between Congress and the government. According to Edgar Zegarra: &quot;he did not tell us absolutely anything about the decisions he was going to make&quot;, a fact which the MNR deputy claimed was a sign of &quot;deep disloyalty&quot; on Mesa&#x27;s behalf.

At the same time, on 14 October, the United States Department of State informed Mesa that the US &quot;would not under any circumstances support a possible government headed by [him]&quot;. Two days later, US Ambassador David N. Greenlee personally met with Mesa at his home to request that he return to the government, which he refused to do. Given that, Greenlee recounts asking Mesa that &quot;if you can&#x27;t support the president anymore, why don&#x27;t you resign?&quot;. For the ambassador, the question was a &quot;philosophical point, not a political one&quot;, but it nonetheless fomented an untrusting relationship between the two. At the end of their discussion, it was learned that the press had intercepted Greenlee&#x27;s radio traffic and had gathered outside Mesa&#x27;s home. Before television crews, the two spoke of a &quot;friendly and constructive conversation&quot;, though Greenlee states that &quot;it wasn&#x27;t of that kind&quot;. The following day, with it becoming increasingly clear that Sánchez de Lozada would soon step down, the Department of State conceded and informed Mesa that the US would support his succession.

At midday on 17 October, Minister of the Presidency Guillermo Justiniano called Mesa to inform him that the president would soon resign and invited him to discuss conditions surrounding his departure. Mere hours later, however, Justiniano called again to tell Mesa that Sánchez de Lozada had already left the Palacio Quemado. At 6:00 p.m., Hormando Vaca Díez and Oscar Arrien, presidents of the Senate and Chamber of Deputies, visited Mesa to inform him that they would soon accept the president&#x27;s resignation and that constitutional succession corresponded to him. At the same time, they insisted that he pledge to stay in office for the mandated term ending on 6 August 2007.

== Presidency (2003–2005) ==
=== Without ballot boxes or rifles ===

Between 5:25 p.m. and 10:30 p.m., the presidency remained effectively vacant. At a plenary session of the National Congress, an overwhelming majority of ninety-seven to thirty legislators—with the exception of all but one member of the MNR—voted to accept Sánchez de Lozada&#x27;s resignation. Vice President Mesa was subsequently sworn in as the 63rd president of Bolivia, assuming office through constitutional succession.

Mesa opened his inaugural address with a conciliatory tone, emphasizing that &quot;Bolivia is not yet a country among equals&quot;. He outlined his intent to call for a binding referendum on gas exports, promised to review the privatization of hydrocarbons, and pledged to call for a constituent assembly to revise the Constitution in hopes of addressing ethnic and regional divisions. These points became known as the &quot;October Agenda&quot; and composed the core of Mesa&#x27;s government program during his presidency. His accession to office was largely well received by the country&#x27;s social sectors, who heeded his request for demobilization and an end to the blockades. From Cochabamba, Evo Morales indicated that the ouster of Sánchez de Lozada was &quot;just a small victory&quot; but also expressed his willingness to support Mesa&#x27;s policy initiatives.

Mesa&#x27;s investiture was met with far more skepticism among the traditional parties. His pledge to form a non-partisan cabinet devoid of participation from any political party adherents, which Mesa phrased as a &quot;sacrifice&quot; they would have to make, was a significant blow to their influence, described by one MNR deputy as &quot;political suicide&quot;. The second shock came when Mesa announced his intent to bring his term to a conclusion before 2007, as legally prescribed. He called for a &quot;transitional&quot; government and left Congress responsible for setting a date for new elections. In January 2004, amid a high approval rating and broad popular support, Mesa retracted this promise and announced his intent to complete Sánchez de Lozada&#x27;s term.

Entering the Palacio Quemado, Mesa was met with an executive headquarters entirely devoid of personnel, save for the presence of his family and some friends who came to visit. There, he spoke with Bishop Jesús Juárez, who suggested to him that to guarantee the country&#x27;s pacification, he had to be in El Alto the next day. Mesa heeded the advice, traveling in his first full day as president to the former epicenter of the social conflicts to participate in a ceremony in tribute to the victims of the previous government&#x27;s violent occupation of the city. Before a crowd of some 8,000 people, he declared that his government would grant compensation of Bs50,000 to the relatives of the deceased and, most importantly, announced an inquiry into those culpable for the previous week&#x27;s repressions. With the slogan &quot;neither forget, nor revenge: justice!&quot;, Mesa promised that he would ask Congress to begin a &quot;responsible investigation&quot; that would establish the responsibility of Sánchez de Lozada and members of his government for the numerous deaths caused during the October crisis. Almost a year later, on 14 October 2004, the National Congress, by a vote of 126 to thirteen, authorized a trial of responsibilities against Sánchez de Lozada and his entire cabinet under the purview of the Law of Responsibilities (Law N° 2445), precisely promulgated by the ex-president. Mesa applauded its passage as a &quot;historic decision&quot; that &quot;strengthens democracy and renews civic faith in its institutions&quot;.

=== Domestic policy ===
==== Economy ====

Among the most pressing challenges facing the early Mesa government was the ongoing economic recession—at the start of 2003, the fiscal deficit lay at 8.7 percent of GDP. On 1 February 2004, Mesa laid out his economic program aimed at reducing government waste through fiscal austerity and the imposition of new taxes on the nation&#x27;s highest earners. Within the public service sector, he implemented a ten percent reduction in his own salary as president and a five percent cut in the wages of all high officials, as well as eliminated the &quot;bonuses&quot; of up to US$4,000 granted to ministers, vice ministers, and legislators through which their wages had nearly doubled. On that point, Mesa introduced measures that prohibited government officials from having wages higher than the president&#x27;s. In the private sector, he imposed a tax on bank transactions and 1.5 percent of the net worth of those making more than US$50,000. At the conclusion of Mesa&#x27;s first full year in office, the fiscal deficit had been reduced to 5.5 percent and was at 2.4 percent by the end of 2005.

==== Judiciary ====
Since 1999, the Supreme Court of Justice had been operating at a reduced capacity. Congress had left several vacancies due to its inability to nominate judges who could gain the support of two-thirds of the legislators, causing delays in the judicial system because the Court could not reach the majorities necessary to adopt rulings. In light of the parliamentary recess, on 31 July 2004, through Supreme Decree N° 27650, Mesa swore in six new acting Supreme Court magistrates, two judicial counselors, and nine district prosecutors. Mesa justified that in this way, he had &quot;guarantee[d] the independence of the judicial power, starkly controlled by the parties...&quot;. The recess appointments were challenged by Congress, which filed a motion with the Constitutional Court on the grounds that Mesa had violated the separation of powers. On 11 November, the Court ruled against Mesa and annulled the appointments.

==== Constitutional reform ====
The primary barrier to Mesa&#x27;s October Agenda, particularly regarding the promise of a referendum and a constituent assembly, was that the Political Constitution of the State did not prescribe any mechanisms to carry out either venture. For this reason, the first step toward the president&#x27;s program was to amend said Constitution. To do this, Law N° 2410 &quot;On The Necessity of Reform to the Constitution&quot;—promulgated in 2002 by then-president Jorge Quiroga—was unarchived in order to provide a legal framework for the new alterations. On 20 February 2004, Congress sanctioned, and Mesa promulgated Law N° 2631, amending the Constitution to allow for a constituent assembly and the ability to call for either a citizen legislative initiative or a referendum. In addition to the main points, the opportunity was also taken to abolish parliamentary immunity and allow for dual citizenship.

==== Hydrocarbons and gas ====
===== 2004 gas referendum =====
A few months after the formalization of the new legal structure, on 13 April 2004, Mesa issued the call for a referendum on gas, opting to do so through supreme decree given a National Congress whose majority opposed his agenda. The latter decision was the basis for the traditional parties&#x27; objection to the plebiscite; the MIR, ADN, and sectors of the MNR, among other criticisms, voiced their opinion that the convocation of the referendum through any form other than a law passed by the legislature was illegal. Legislators of Solidarity Civic Unity (UCS) filed two lawsuits with the Constitutional Court alleging the unconstitutionality of the referendum. Days before the vote, the Court ruled in favor of Mesa and the National Electoral Court.

Simultaneously, the five questions, drafted by both Mesa and MAS representatives, caused a divide in the labor and social movements because they did not directly address the nationalization of gas reserves, an action supported by over eighty percent of the country. The country&#x27;s largest workers&#x27; unions—the Bolivian Workers&#x27; Center (COB), the Regional Workers&#x27; Center of El Alto (COR-El Alto), the Unified Syndical Confederation of Rural Workers (CSUTCB), and the Gas Coordinator, among others—all voiced their discontent with this crucial omission and called for a boycott of the vote, promoting roadblocks and demonstrations to block access to polling sites. On the other hand, the Bartolina Sisa Confederation, as well as peasant unions in Potosí, Oruro, and Cochabamba backed the vote in support of Morales. For his part, Morales encouraged a &quot;yes&quot; vote on the first three questions and a &quot;no&quot; on the last two, which concerned issues surrounding exports. Mesa&#x27;s campaign denounced the boycott and ramped up security at polling centers to defend against threats of violence, while the Electoral Court imposed a fine of Bs150 (US$19) for those who did not vote.

The outcome of the 18 July vote yielded largely positive results for the Mesa administration. Labor protests failed to significantly reduce turnout, which came in at 60.06 percent, a figure that, while the lowest of any election since the transition to democracy in 1982, was still substantial. The Electoral Court argued that, as a referendum, participation levels were not comparable to previously held general or municipal elections. Most importantly, all five questions passed by broad margins. Questions one through three regarding the repeal of Sánchez de Lozada&#x27;s hydrocarbons law, State recovery of hydrocarbon ownership at the wellhead, and the reestablishment of YPFB all passed with over eighty percent of the vote—question two achieved over ninety percent. Meanwhile, coinciding with the position of the MAS, questions four and five on exports saw the least support, though they still received over fifty percent and sixty percent of the vote, respectively. Mesa hailed the results as a significant victory and a vote of confidence in his administration, later calling it &quot;the brightest moment of our government&quot;.

===== 2005 Hydrocarbons Law =====
Immediately following the referendum, Mesa began negotiating with Congress, whose participation was necessary to formulate and eventually sanction a law on hydrocarbons. His first step was to introduce the &quot;Law of Execution and Compliance of the Referendum&quot;—dubbed the &quot;short law&quot;—to establish a clear interpretation of the vote&#x27;s results and commit to comply with them. Mesa was adamant that the short law must be &quot;physically separate&quot; from any eventual hydrocarbons legislation. Regardless, the measure was roundly rejected by the legislature, which insisted on a singular hydrocarbons bill. As a result, Mesa announced on 20 August that he would not enact any legislation authorized by Congress until an agreement was reached, a pledge he was forced to retract two days later amid criticism that he was jeopardizing the convocation of municipal elections. After a few weeks of negotiations, the president relented and agreed to present a solitary &quot;large law&quot; to Congress for consideration.

Ultimately, without a party base of his own, Mesa was incapable of overcoming Congress&#x27;s ability to block his policy initiatives. In late October, peasant and mining sectors led by Morales and the COB conducted mass demonstrations in La Paz, blockading the streets in and around Congress. On 20 October, faced with immense external pressure from over 15,000 peasant protesters arriving from Caracollo, Congress discarded the president&#x27;s bill and agreed to move forward with the one proposed by the Mixed Commission for Economic Development, headed by Santos Ramírez of the MAS. With victory at hand, Morales agreed to demobilize his followers. After the demise of Mesa&#x27;s project, negotiations moved forward over the more radical proposal. The primary point of contention between parliamentarians of different parties surrounded question two of the referendum and what exactly &quot;recover[y of] ownership over all hydrocarbons&quot; meant. While more radical sectors called for complete nationalization of the industry, the MAS took a more moderate stance, demanding that oil companies be subject to a royalty of fifty percent of their profits. The compromise of the traditional parties was to approve a draft on 3 March 2005 that kept the preexisting eighteen percent royalty in place but added a thirty-two percent profits tax that, cumulatively, would reach fifty percent. In response, MAS sectors mobilized their bases in Cochabamba and Chuquisaca, initiating blockades and roadblocks, actions that shattered the tacit alliance Morales had shared with Mesa up to that point.

The dramatic upturn in the social climate placed Mesa in a precarious political position—one that urgently necessitated a skillful maneuver in order to circumvent a repeat of the government repressions of October 2003, which Mesa refused to allow. The scheme ultimately devised was two-fold: the presentation of the president&#x27;s revocable resignation to Congress and a simultaneous televised address to the nation. In a forty-five-minute speech broadcast on radio and television, Mesa put to use his oratory skills, denouncing both left-wing labor sectors as well as conservative autonomists and business elites and directly calling out Evo Morales by name. In addition, he reiterated his statement that &quot;I am not willing to kill&quot; and promised that &quot;there will be no deaths on my back&quot; before announcing to the nation his intent to resign from the presidency on the grounds that it was impossible to govern under the threat of blockades. The gamble succeeded in inverting middle-class sentiment in his favor and against his opponents. Soon after the speech, a mass demonstration reaching approximately 5,000 people assembled outside the Plaza Murillo to support of the continuity of Mesa&#x27;s mandate. Similar gatherings took place in other cities.

With popular support and political momentum at his back, Mesa immediately set about exerting pressure on Congress. Within hours, at a plenary session of legislators convened to formulate a response to Mesa&#x27;s resignation, Minister of the Presidency José Galindo laid out the president&#x27;s terms for remaining in office. After three days of negotiations, Congress unanimously voted to reject Mesa&#x27;s resignation on 8 March. In exchange, the legislature committed to a four-point agenda: expedite the drafting of the hydrocarbons bill; begin the process of approving an autonomy referendum, the democratic election of prefects, and the convocation of a constituent assembly; construct a national &quot;social pact&quot;; and initiate efforts to end the ongoing blockades. The agreement was formalized between Mesa and six of the eight congressional parties: the traditional right-wing parties, embattled and under pressure, accepted, while the MAS and the Pachakuti Indigenous Movement (MIP; a related left-wing party) refused to sign, and from that point were marginalized entirely, solidifying the split between Mesa and Morales for the rest of his administration.

Mesa&#x27;s brief alliance with the conservative sectors of Congress proved tenuous. Recalling the accord, Mesa regretted that &quot;I wasted the chance; I accepted a bad agreement with Congress, a generic document, of moral commitments that were never fulfilled&quot;. He further outlined that a better course of action would have been to impose his own hydrocarbons bill as a condition for withdrawing his resignation. On 15 March, the Chamber of Deputies approved the Hydrocarbons Law, maintaining the eighteen percent royalty and thirty-two percent tax. Despite not meeting the opposition&#x27;s demands, Morales relented and called off the ongoing strikes. Mesa, however, maintained that the country did not have the economic capacity to carry out the law and argued that the new tax should be implemented gradually, starting at twelve percent and increasing to thirty-two percent within a decade.

Nonetheless, on 6 May, Congress moved forward and passed the controversial bill. Despite having drafted it themselves, the failure to agree on the fifty percent royalty led the MAS to near-unanimously vote against it. Faced with two unappealing choices of either promulgating the law or vetoing it, Mesa took a third option: neither. As stipulated by Article 78 of the Constitution: &quot;Laws not vetoed or not promulgated by the president of the republic within ten days from their receipt, will be promulgated by the president of the congress&quot;. On 16 May, President of the Senate Hormando Vaca Díez signed the bill into law and criticized Mesa for &quot;[bringing] the country to a point of crisis and uncertainty&quot;.

==== Autonomies ====
One of the major challenges to the Mesa government was the increasing calls for decentralization from business and civic sectors in the Santa Cruz Department. For years, the national government had systemically blocked the issue of departmental autonomy and the democratic election of prefects. The Banzer and Quiroga administrations sidestepped it entirely, while Sánchez de Lozada was actively hostile to the prospect, viewing it as the basis for the collapse of the unitary state. Mesa took a different stance on the issue, announcing on 20 April 2004 his support for regional autonomy. He outlined his government&#x27;s intent to address the matter through the convocation of a constituent assembly that would amend the relevant articles in the Constitution in order to provide for the decentralization of the country and the election of prefects and departmental councilors by popular vote. In tandem, he issued two decrees that month: one served to strengthen departmental councils while the other determined the administrative decentralization of regional health and education services. The response from Santa Cruz civic leaders, however, was unsupportive of Mesa&#x27;s proposal. On 22 June, under the leadership of Rubén Costas—head of the Pro Santa Cruz Committee—a civic council was convened that approved an eleven-point document known as the &quot;June Agenda&quot; against blockades, centralism, and violence. It demanded a national referendum on autonomies and began collecting signatures for a departmental plebiscite to be held prior to the convocation of the constituent assembly.

This context precipitated an antagonistic relationship between the Mesa administration and Santa Cruz civic leaders and business elites for the duration of his mandate. Although Mesa&#x27;s policy proposals remained in favor of a move toward autonomy, his approval rating in the department fell from sixty-one percent in June to thirty-six percent by the end of 2004. The culmination of this animosity came on 30 December when the government announced the termination of its fuel subsidy in order to reduce the rate of smuggling. The result was a twenty-three percent increase in the price of diesel and a ten percent gasoline hike. The unpopular measure—dubbed the &quot;dieselazo&quot;—generated nationwide protests from both left-wing indigenous and labor groups and right-wing business sectors. Most seriously, autonomist groups in Santa Cruz, joined later by civic groups in Tarija, quickly coopted the demonstrations in those departments, adding the call for autonomy to their list of demands even after the government agreed to reduce the diesel increase to fifteen percent. On 21 January, the Armed Forces signaled to the president their willingness to intervene in the event that Santa Cruz moved to declare itself autonomous in violation of the Constitution. Faced with the possibility of an armed confrontation similar to that of October 2003, Mesa, on 26 January, resolved with his cabinet to allow the Cruceños to move forward with self-rule unimpeded. The following day, with news that the Santa Cruz Youth Union had decided to seize all public institutions in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Mesa gave the order to withdraw all civil and police personnel from public buildings, including the prefecture, in order to avoid armed conflict. On 28 January, Santa Cruz was proclaimed an autonomous department at a &quot;cabildo&quot; held at the foot of the Christ the Redeemer Monument. The declaration came with the formation of a provisional assembly that would negotiate with the government for a departmental autonomy referendum in order to legitimize the new authority, which at the moment contravened the Constitution. That same day, Mesa issued Supreme Decree N° 27988, which called for the election of prefects in all nine departments. Since the Constitution granted the power to designate prefects solely to the president, the decree worked around that by constraining the head of state only to appoint those who obtained a majority of the popular vote. The decree was formalized by a complementary law passed by Congress on 8 April. On 11 February, Mesa delegated to Congress the task of setting a date for the autonomies referendum.

=== Foreign policy ===
==== Argentina ====

On 15 April 2004, Mesa authorized an agreement with Argentine President Néstor Kirchner allowing for the sale of four million cubic meters daily of Bolivian gas for a six-month period with the possibility of renewal depending on the outcome of the July referendum. The arrangement was supported by civic groups in Tarija—home to eighty-five percent of the country&#x27;s natural gas—but was met with suspicion by certain labor sectors who viewed it as a possible roundabout way for Bolivian gas to be exported to Chile through Argentina. In view of this, the Mesa administration conditioned the sale on the promise that not &quot;one molecule&quot; of Bolivian gas could be exported to Chile. Doing so would constitute a contract violation on the part of Argentina. Mesa met with Kirchner twice more during his presidency, this time in Bolivia, once for a short discussion in July and another in October 2004. In the latter, the two presidents signed an agreement that increased Bolivian gas export volumes from 6.5 million to 26.5 million cubic meters per day to help mitigate the Argentine energy crisis.

==== Chile and the Maritime Demand ====
As with near-universally all previous governments, the relationship between Bolivia and Chile during the Mesa administration centered fundamentally on Bolivia&#x27;s claim of sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean, a dispute which, by 2004, had reached its centennial without compromise. Just under a month into Mesa&#x27;s presidency, the first discussions surrounding the maritime issue took place. On 14 November 2003, during the ongoing Ibero-American Summit, Mesa met privately with Chilean President Ricardo Lagos at the Los Tajibos Hotel in Santa Cruz de la Sierra. The dialogue between the two heads of state concluded with an agreement in principle on a sovereign corridor connecting Bolivia to the Pacific through a strip of land along the Chile–Peru border. As per the Treaty of Ancón, any cession of land formerly belonging to Peru necessitates Peruvian approval and, therefore, Lagos stipulated that &quot;if there is a Peruvian yes, there will be a Chilean yes&quot;.

Mesa raised the maritime claim again at the Monterrey Special Summit of the Americas in January 2004. There, he emphasized the good relationship between the two countries but expressed his view that such relations required the resolution of issues that &quot;for a reason of justice&quot; must be resolved. Mesa&#x27;s statements opened a rift between himself and Lagos, who expressed his &quot;regret [for] what happened in Monterrey because these are spaces to advance on collective and multilateral issues&quot;. Nonetheless, Mesa was received with praise by the National Congress, which declared &quot;its strongest and most determined support&quot; for the president. Later that month, at a seven-hour session of parliament, Congress declared the maritime claim to be an &quot;inalienable right of the Bolivian people&quot; and issued its approval for Mesa&#x27;s strategy of multilateralizing the demand in order to gain support from as many nations as possible.

At the 34th General Assembly of the Organization of American States held in Quito, Ecuador, the Bolivian delegation distributed its &quot;Libro Azul&quot;, which recounted the government&#x27;s interpretation of events surrounding the War of the Pacific and justifies the country&#x27;s historical claim. The 35th OAS General Assembly was held in Fort Lauderdale from 5 to 7 June 2005; Mesa issued his definitive resignation on 6 June. It was the last time the outgoing government addressed the maritime claim, bringing an end to Mesa&#x27;s strategy against Chile.

==== Peru ====
At a meeting in Lima held on 4 November 2003, Mesa and Peruvian President Alejandro Toledo agreed on the framework for a common market between the two states in order to support greater cultural, commercial, and economic integration as advocated by the Andean Community. Days after voters approved gas exportation as part of national policy in the gas referendum, the Bolivian government scheduled talks with their counterparts in Peru to discuss the topic. On 4 August 2004, Mesa and Toledo signed a letter of intent promising to analyze the joint exportation of natural gas. The deal granted Bolivia a special economic zone centered on the southern port of Ilo, from where it could export its gas to lucrative markets in Mexico and the United States. The agreement allowed Bolivia access to the Pacific for the first time in over a century. Days later, the two presidents, along with Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, inaugurated two bridges connecting Bolivia and Peru to Brazil. Through this, Toledo expressed his hope that a tripartite market between the three countries could pave the way for broader continental integration.

=== Definitive resignation ===
Despite enjoying an approval rating of over sixty percent, Mesa&#x27;s inability to find a compromise with the National Congress, especially after his break in relations with the MAS, led him to call for an early end to his term. On 15 March 2005, less than a week after Congress rejected his resignation, Mesa announced his intent to introduce a bill that would advance the call for general elections to 28 August, cutting short his term by two years. Two days later, Congress rejected his proposal under the justification that it &quot;lack[ed] a legal basis&quot;.

After returning the unenacted hydrocarbons bill to Congress, Mesa attempted to salvage his domestic policy agenda by calling a &quot;National Meeting for Unity&quot; to be held in Sucre on 16 May. The conference would have sought to find consensus on the hydrocarbons law and establish concrete dates for the convocation of an autonomies referendum and elections for a constituent assembly and prefects. Ninety-seven sectors were invited, including the three branches of government, ex-presidents, heads of political parties, mayors of the nine departmental capitols and El Alto, the association of municipalities, the presidents of the nine departmental civic committees, four representatives of indigenous organizations, two from trade unions, and two from large businesses. While the Catholic Church, the Human Rights Assembly, and some civic groups agreed to participate, most political parties rejected the meeting, including both the MNR and MAS. Mesa was ultimately forced to suspend the event after Congress declined to attend.

By this point, the country faced increasingly debilitating strikes and demonstrations from opposing groups seeking conflicting goals. The MAS demanded the urgent convocation of a constituent assembly to rewrite the Constitution. They were supported by trade unions, which additionally called for the immediate nationalization of gas. In the eastern departments, protests were held calling for a referendum on autonomies. The unrest was exacerbated by the indecision of Congress, which remained deadlocked over whether to convene the constituent assembly and later hold the autonomies referendum or hold both constituent elections and the referendum simultaneously. Finally, on 2 June, Mesa opted to circumvent the legislature and, by supreme decree, scheduled the referendum and elections for the constituent assembly for 16 October.

Mesa&#x27;s actions failed to quell the unrest and were rejected by both left-wing and right-wing sectors of the country. Faced with the tense political situation and unwilling to allow military action against protesters, Mesa tendered his resignation on 6 June. With that, the responsibility fell to Congress to accept it and swear in a new individual to the presidency. The candidate next in line to succeed Mesa was Hormando Vaca Díez, the president of the Senate, followed by Mario Cossío of the Chamber of Deputies. Viewing that the country would not accept such a succession by members of the traditional political parties, Mesa called on Vaca Díez and Cossío to renounce their succession rights to avoid an &quot;explosion&quot; in the country. This request was not considered by Vaca Díez, who announced his intention to convene a session of Congress in Sucre—La Paz was almost entirely blockaded—to accept Mesa&#x27;s resignation and install himself as president. After three days of resistance, Vaca Díez conceded to popular pressure and, along with Cossío, the two legislative heads renounced their right to succession. At 11:45 p.m. on 9 June 2005, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the president of the Supreme Court of Justice, was sworn in as the 64th president of Bolivia at an extraordinary session of Congress held in Sucre. The following day, Mesa received Rodríguez Veltzé in La Paz. For Mesa, &quot;that moment had an immense symbolic load. I had entered through the front door and was leaving through the front door, with my forehead high and looking the country in the eye&quot;.

== Post-presidency (2005–2018) ==

After his departure from the Palacio Quemado, Mesa retired from politics and returned to his work as a journalist. In 2008, he published &quot;Presidencia Sitiada&quot;, a memoir of his time as head of state. The following year, together with Mario Espinoza, he directed, wrote, and narrated &quot;Bolivia Siglo XX&quot;, a documentary series covering the most important events in twentieth-century Bolivian history. On 7 December 2012, the Association of Journalists of La Paz awarded Mesa the National Journalism Award for his extensive contributions to Bolivian media.

=== Spokesman for the Maritime Demand ===
On 28 April 2014, now-president Evo Morales announced the appointment of Mesa as a member of the team of the Strategic Directorate of the Maritime Claim (DIREMAR). As outlined by the president, Mesa&#x27;s task would be to represent Bolivia&#x27;s maritime claim in all international forums, presenting the legal and historical bases of the country&#x27;s claim against Chile, for which it had filed a lawsuit with the International Court of Justice. The decision to appoint Mesa did not come as a surprise; several politicians in past weeks, including President of the Chamber of Deputies Marcelo Elío Chávez, had suggested his inclusion on the DIREMAR team due to his historical expertise. Speculation had even arisen that he might be appointed ambassador to Peru, an extreme Morales was not entirely comfortable with and which he circumvented by specifying that Mesa&#x27;s new post would not constitute an official diplomatic office because &quot;it is not necessary for him to have this position [since] as a former president and former vice president he has all the authority to assume this responsibility&quot;. This fact was reiterated by Mesa, who stated that he had agreed with the president that &quot;I am not a public official, I will not be appointed, nor will there be a swearing-in ceremony&quot;. He further noted that he would hold his position &quot;ad honorem&quot; and would not receive a salary for his work. However, as noted by economist Alberto Bonadona, following his appointment, the government began paying Mesa the life annuity that corresponded to him as a former president, which it had previously blocked from being delivered. &quot;With all certainty, they [paid] him retroactively&quot;, Bonadona stated.

Mesa began his task with an eye towards the 50th G77 + China Summit, hosted by Bolivia in Santa Cruz de la Sierra between 14 and 15 June of that year. While Mesa stated that Bolivia would not seek an official statement of solidarity from the member states present, he highlighted the gathering as an opportunity to disseminate the country&#x27;s maritime claim and stated that the meeting &quot;should have the issue of the sea as a fundamental aspect&quot;. On 16 June, Mesa and Morales jointly presented &quot;El Libro del Mar&quot; at a ceremony in the Palacio Quemado. The book, distributed to the attendees of the G77 in the previous days, described the essential arguments that Bolivia intended to present to the international community.

During this time, a notable dichotomy between Mesa&#x27;s international and domestic relationship with Morales developed. On the one hand, he supported and closely cooperated with the president on matters relating to the maritime lawsuit. At the same time, he remained harshly critical of the government&#x27;s undemocratic tendencies, and the ruling party filed various legal complaints against him, the most notable being the Quiborax case in which he was accused of breach of duties for actions taken during his presidency. Vice President Álvaro García Linera described Mesa as &quot;an excellent explainer of the maritime cause&quot; but stated that &quot;as a politician, internally, he is a resounding failure&quot;. Nonetheless, in 2019, Mesa affirmed that, if asked to return as spokesman for the maritime cause, he &quot;would do it again one, two, five, 100, 200 times more&quot;.

In late September 2018, Mesa traveled to The Hague to hear the ICJ&#x27;s final ruling. In an interview for the Chilean newspaper &quot;La Tercera&quot;, Mesa assured that &quot;the Bolivian people are prepared to receive the ruling regardless of its content&quot; and urged both countries to abide by the court&#x27;s decision. On 1 October 2018, by a vote of twelve to three, the ICJ ruled that Chile was not obligated to negotiate sovereign access to the Pacific with Bolivia. Shortly after, Mesa called on Bolivians to &quot;accept the ruling even though it seems unfair&quot;. He urged the government to respect the decision and asked that it move forward with a new policy towards Chile with the understanding that it is not obliged to negotiate.

== Return to politics (2018–present) ==
In mid-2018, Mesa appeared as a lead contender against Morales in early voting intention polls. On 29 July 2018, the company &quot;Mercados y Samples&quot; released a poll for &quot;Página Siete&quot; that showed Mesa with a first-round favorability of twenty-five percent, two points behind Morales&#x27; twenty-seven percent. Such a result would launch a runoff in which polling gave Mesa an over ten-point victory of forty-eight percent over Morales&#x27; thirty-two percent. MAS Senator Ciro Zabala credited this polling victory to the opposition making Mesa seem &quot;victimized&quot; by the Quiborax case. This point was reiterated by Deputy Edgar Montaño, who admitted that the controversy &quot;makes Mesa grow&quot;. On the other hand, opposition leaders affirmed that Mesa&#x27;s popularity was due to what they claimed to be political persecution by the government against him.

In an interview with &quot;Erbol&quot; on 19 September, Mesa declared that he would not make any political statements or comment on his potential candidacy &quot;as long as the issue of the sea is the fundamental question&quot;, committing himself entirely to his duties until the ruling by The Hague on 1 October. On 5 October, the Revolutionary Left Front (FRI) formally invited Mesa to be the party&#x27;s presidential candidate in the 2019 elections. While Mesa claimed that he would make a decision &quot;in the next few hours&quot;, both Walter Villagra, secretary-general of the FRI, and Mesa&#x27;s lawyer, Carlos Alarcón, confirmed that he had already accepted. The following day, Mesa formally launched his 2019 presidential candidacy. In a video message titled &quot;For a Government of Citizens&quot;, Mesa stated that &quot;I have made... the decision to be a candidate for the presidency of the State. And I do so for a very clear reason, because this is a time of historical inflection, because we are at the beginning, on the threshold of a new time&quot;. He further outlined his intention to form &quot;a citizen movement&quot; which would break &quot;the exhausted cycle&quot; of over a decade of MAS rule. Mesa&#x27;s announcement was hailed by various opposition groups, including leaders both the National Unity Front (UN) and the Social Democratic Movement (MDS), who signaled their hopes of sealing an alliance with the FRI.

=== Leader of Civic Community ===

On 24 October, La Paz Mayor Luis Revilla announced that his Sovereignty and Liberty (SOL.bo) civic group had decided to support Mesa&#x27;s candidacy. After a 26-minute tour through the Central Urban Park of La Paz on 30 October, Mesa and Revilla announced to the media that they had agreed to form a coalition between the two parties. The agreement was formalized the following day and registered with the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) on 13 November 2018 under the name Civic Community (CC). The alliance initially included the FRI, SOL.bo, and over 50 citizens platforms. However, CC failed to gather a fully unified opposition pact as UN and MDS formalized their own alliance while other parties registered individually. Jhonny Fernández, leader of UCS, explained that sealing a deal was difficult because the FRI was &quot;not interested in working with leaders who were in political and administrative positions in previous governments&quot;.

==== 2019 presidential election ====

One of the agreements made by Revilla and Mesa was that the latter would be free to nominate his running mate. On 27 November, Mesa announced that Gustavo Pedraza, his former minister of sustainable development, would accompany him as his vice-presidential candidate. Civic Community opened its electoral campaign in Tarija with a &quot;door to door&quot; canvassing drive and the announcement of a national tour through the country. One of Mesa&#x27;s main campaign tactics was to denounce Morales&#x27; bid for a fourth term as illegal due to the fact that voters rejected abolishing term limits in 2016. In that vein, he promoted the strengthening of democratic institutions and additionally ran on environmental protection and addressing corruption.

===== Crisis: Mesa calls fraud =====
General elections were held on 20 October. By the following day, with a provisional count of eighty-three percent of ballots, Morales and Mesa appeared poised for a second round in December. Mesa hailed his movement&#x27;s &quot;unquestionable triumph&quot; and swiftly took steps to gather the endorsements of the other opposition parties for the &quot;definitive triumph&quot; in the runoff. Shortly after, however, he expressed concern that the government&#x27;s official live count had paralyzed at 27.14 percent and called for civic mobilizations and opposition demonstrations before the TSE and its departmental branches to avoid suspected fraud. After a full day without live results, the TSE released its updated count, which placed Morales at 46.86 percent and Mesa at 36.72 percent, with ninety-five percent of votes tallied. Such an outcome gave the president an over ten-point lead by a margin of just 0.1 percent, sufficient to circumvent a runoff. Mesa denounced the unexpected result as &quot;distorted and rigged&quot; and alleged &quot;a gigantic fraud underway&quot;. As a result, he called for his supporters to &quot;permanently mobilize&quot; until a second round was agreed to. On 3 November, in the midst of an increasingly unsustainable political situation, Mesa insisted on the resignation of the members of the TSE and the convocation of fresh general elections under the supervision of new electoral authorities, rejecting a second round as untenable while at the same time implicitly refusing to support the more radical demands from Santa Cruz civic leaders like Luis Fernando Camacho that Morales resign. By 10 November, however, Mesa had joined the call for Morales to step aside &quot;if he has an iota of patriotism left&quot;. The day before that, he rejected Morales&#x27; call for dialogue with the opposition, stating: &quot;I have nothing to negotiate&quot;.

After twenty days of continuous demonstrations and with his grip on the country slipping, Morales, together with his vice president, announced his abdication on 10 November. After a series of ensuing resignations that exhausted the presidential line of succession followed by two days of uncertainty, opposition senator Jeanine Áñez was proclaimed, first, president of the Senate and, through that, president of the State. Two days later, Mesa gave his support to the transitional government but assured that his alliance would not participate in it in order to focus its attention on soon-to-be called elections. On 8 June 2021, Áñez testified before the Prosecutor&#x27;s Office that Mesa had blocked the assumption of a MAS legislator to the presidency during the 2019 crisis. During extra-legislative meetings held to discuss a solution to the serious issues facing the country, then-president of the Senate Adriana Salvatierra, anticipating the possible resignation of Morales, raised her claim to constitutional succession and asked if the opposition would accept it. According to Áñez: &quot;Mr. [Antonio] Quiroga calls Mr. Carlos Mesa by phone to consult him, and he replies that the public would not accept that succession [because] the protests would continue&quot;. Salvatierra announced her resignation an hour after Morales issued his. Mesa did not comment on Áñez&#x27;s testimony but in October affirmed that, at meetings sponsored by the Catholic Church and European Union, Salvatierra never raised her right to take office. He also called back to January 2020 when she reported to &quot;Los Tiempos&quot; that her resignation had been part of a political agreement made with Morales.

==== 2020 presidential election ====
A month after the establishment of the transitional government, Mesa confirmed that he would stand as a candidate in the rerun general elections. Despite initial hopes of leading a unified front against the MAS, Mesa&#x27;s campaign quickly came up against multiple presidential hopefuls, including the candidacy of President Áñez herself, which he considered a &quot;great mistake&quot;. On 3 February, a total of seven opposition fronts were registered for the new elections, including Mesa&#x27;s Civic Community as well as Áñez&#x27;s Juntos alliance, Luis Fernando Camacho&#x27;s Creemos, and Libre21 of Jorge Quiroga, among other minor parties. The fracturing of the opposition risked the dispersion of the vote and, though the various parties consolidated with the withdrawal of Áñez and Quiroga in the final weeks and days of the election cycle, Mesa&#x27;s campaign was hampered nonetheless.

In the elections of 18 October, these factors contributed to the victory of the MAS and its candidate Luis Arce in the first round. Mesa came in second with 28.83 percent, having lost a significant percentage of the vote to Camacho, who came in third with fourteen percent. Mesa conceded defeat the day after the election and noted his coalition&#x27;s position as the head of the opposition in the Legislative Assembly. Analysts have attributed Mesa&#x27;s electoral defeat to the &quot;passive&quot; nature of his campaign. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Mesa&#x27;s campaign remained largely virtual and failed to reach out to social sectors. At the same time, external factors such as the unpopularity of the interim government and the candidacy of Camacho, which siphoned support from Santa Cruz, contributed to Mesa&#x27;s loss.

== Ideology and personality ==
=== Political positions ===
Texas A&amp;M political analyst Diego von Vacano stated that, since his reentry into politics, Mesa has &quot;moved to the left&quot;, largely due to the fact that &quot;Morales shifted the entire spectrum of Bolivian politics to the left&quot;. In 2020, Mesa was the only presidential candidate who expressed a willingness to open a national discussion on issues such as gay marriage, abortion, and marijuana legalization. Michael Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue—of which Mesa is a member—describes Mesa as a &quot;centrist committed to democratic values, who understands the importance of reconciliation as a condition for moving forward&quot;. Personally, Mesa states that in previous years he would have considered himself a social democrat but that he no longer subscribes to any singular ideological viewpoint. At the same time, he asserts that he is not &quot;at all from the right and of the 70s Marxist leftism, less so&quot;. In an interview with &quot;El País&quot; of Tarija, Mesa affirmed that &quot;I don&#x27;t think it matters if I&#x27;m from the left, center, or right&quot;.

Mesa credits his schooling at a Jesuit institution as having &quot;always been very strong in my vision of the spiritual&quot; but states that he has been &quot;skeptical about religious issues for several years, the more I have delved into the subject more deeply&quot;. In late 2018, he proposed the enactment of a law that would guarantee the separation of church and state as prescribed by the 2009 Constitution.

In international relations, Mesa has opened up the possibility of good relations with any nation regardless of political ideology so long as they are in the &quot;best benefit for Bolivia&quot; and within the framework of &quot;respect [for] democracy and human rights&quot;. He has advocated for the resumption of bilateral relations with the United States and the expansion of economic agreements with China and Russia. When Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Mesa decried the act as &quot;imperialist&quot; and called on the government to release an official condemnation.

Mesa has advocated for judicial reform within the country and blamed the MAS for perverting justice to the point that it has &quot;become a danger to human rights&quot;. In particular, he pointed to the multitude of political prisoners held by the government and the harsh prosecution of infractions committed by opposition politicians compared to those of the ruling party. After the Interdisciplinary Group of Independent Experts for Bolivia concluded a lack of judicial independence, Mesa proposed a ninety-day judicial reform plan entailing amendments to the Constitution and the organic law of the Prosecutor&#x27;s Office and modifications to the system of electing magistrates and appointing national and departmental prosecutors. In February 2022, CC proposed a judicial reform bill that would amend nine articles of the Constitution to guarantee judicial independence.

On environmental issues, Mesa pledged to better guarantee the protection of the country&#x27;s rainforests against external issues such as the fires that affected it in 2019. He also opposes the expansion of agricultural land into protected areas but has promised to seek solutions that harmonize progress and development with environmental protection. In 2019 and 2020, the non-profit organization Sachamama, in partnership with leading environmental groups like the WWF, placed Mesa on its list of &quot;The 100 Latinos Most Committed to Climate Action&quot;. Together with Juan Carlos Enríquez, Ramiro Molina Barrios, and Marcos Loayza, he produced &quot;Planeta Bolivia&quot;, a series of five documentaries covering crucial environmental challenges facing the country in the twenty-first century. In 2017, it was screened at the 13th Inkafest, Peru&#x27;s mountain film festival in Arequipa.

=== Personality ===
José Lizaure, official photographer of the presidency, describes Mesa as &quot;methodical&quot; and recounts that as president, he would break protocols and leave the Palacio Quemado to &quot;greet people&quot; on the street. Upon his assumption to the presidency in 2003, Lupe Cajías described Mesa as someone who &quot;is humble... [and] accepts his mistakes and tries to rectify them&quot; but also noted that he was &quot;naïve and too sincere. He puts his cards on the table when in politics you have to know how to be calculating&quot;. This sentiment was echoed by José Antonio Quiroga, one of Mesa&#x27;s close friends and collaborators, who stated that he was a &quot;politician without a party&quot;, granting him &quot;enormous autonomy&quot; but limiting his proposals to his personal ability. As noted by &quot;La Pública&quot;, Mesa&#x27;s quality as an intellectual and academic makes him able to &quot;talk about everything&quot;; however, &quot;he tends to surround himself with a very small team of personal collaborators&quot;. For this reason, many in the press have described him as &quot;distant&quot; or &quot;arrogant&quot;. During his 2019 and 2020 presidential bids, Mesa was noted as one of the few politicians who had adapted to the use of social media for campaigning, frequently broadcasting live on Facebook and Twitter to address his supporters and respond to questions.

<text>The Lapland longspur (Calcarius lapponicus), also known as the Lapland bunting, is a passerine bird in the longspur family Calcariidae, a group separated by most modern authors from the Fringillidae (Old World finches).

==Taxonomy==
The Lapland longspur was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the finches in the genus &quot;Fringilla&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Fringilla lapponica&quot;. The Lapland longspur is now one of three longspurs placed in the genus &quot;Calcarius&quot; that was introduced in 1802 by the German naturalist Johann Matthäus Bechstein. The English name refers to the long hind claws. The genus name &quot;Calcarius&quot; is from Latin &quot;calcaria&quot;, &quot;spurs&quot;, and the specific &quot;lapponicus&quot; refers to Lapland.

Five subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;C. l. subcalcaratus&quot; (Brehm, CL, 1826) – north Canada and Greenland
* &quot;C. l. lapponicus&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – north Europe and north Asia
* &quot;C. l. kamtschaticus&quot; Portenko, 1937 – northeast Siberia
* &quot;C. l. alascensis&quot; Ridgway, 1898 – extreme east Siberia, Alaska and northwest Canada
* &quot;C. l. coloratus&quot; Ridgway, 1898 – Commander Islands

==Description==
The Lapland longspur is a robust bird, with a thick yellow seed-eater&#x27;s bill. The summer male has a black head and throat, white eyestripe, chestnut nape, white underparts, and a heavily streaked black-grey back. Other plumages have a plainer orange-brown head, a browner back and chestnut nape and wing panels.

Measurements:

* Length: 5.9–6.3 in (15–16 cm)
* Weight: 0.8–1.2 oz (22.3–33.1 g)
* Wingspan: 8.7–11.4 in (22–29 cm)

==Distribution and habitat==
It breeds across Arctic Europe and the Palearctic and in Canada and the northernmost United States. It is migratory, wintering in the Russian steppes, the southern United States, Northern Scandinavian arctic areas and down to coastal Southern Sweden, Denmark and Great Britain. This is the only Asian species of the longspur buntings, and while it probably did not evolve there, it has been present in Eastern Europe for at least about 30,000 years.

==Behaviour==

===Call===
The most common flight call is a hard &quot;prrrrt&quot; usually preceded by a more nasal &quot;teeww&quot;. When breeding, it also makes a softer &quot;duyyeee&quot; followed by a pause and a &quot;triiiuuu&quot;; both sounds alternate.

===Breeding===
The Lapland longspur is a ground-nesting bird, preferring to build its cup nest on heavily-vegetated slopes or among tussocks in low-lying wet areas. They lay, on average, 5 eggs per brood. It breeds in wet tundra, riparian areas, and marshes.

=== Wintering ===
During the winter, these birds are commonly found across the Great Plains and northeast of the United States, as well as southern Canada, where they can typically be seen foraging in agricultural fields. Lapland longspurs often form mixed-species flocks in winter, where they are regularly accompanied by horned larks and snow buntings.

=== Hybridization ===
In 2011, a male Lapland longspur × snow bunting hybrid was identified in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada.

===Food habits===

The food habits of the Lapland longspur are quite simple: mostly seeds in winter and arthropods in the summer, when they are in activity.

During the winter, the longspur feeds on seeds. They pick them on the ground, rarely feeding directly on plants. They will forage around the same area for a period varying between a few minutes and an hour, then fly away looking for a new foraging area. Their seed diet is composed mainly of seeds from grass, foxtail, cultivated millet, crabgrass and wheat. During the breeding season, the birds migrate to the north, where their diet switches to arthropods. Nestlings are only fed arthropods, which also constitute the diet of the parents at that time of the year (June to July). The birds often catch insects in mid-air, but do forage through vegetation when climatic conditions prevent the insects from flying. Longspurs can consume between 3000 and 10,000 prey items (insects or seeds) per day, depending on their energy needs ; they may need to increase this number by 3000 when feeding the young. Dipteran larvae and adults form the major part of their insectivorous diet.

<doc id="343663" wikidata="Q1131116" url="?curid=343663" title="Set-theoretic limit">
<text>In mathematics, the limit of a sequence of sets formula_1 (subsets of a common set formula_2) is a set whose elements are determined by the sequence in either of two equivalent ways: (1) by upper and lower bounds on the sequence that converge monotonically to the same set (analogous to convergence of real-valued sequences) and (2) by convergence of a sequence of indicator functions which are themselves real-valued. As is the case with sequences of other objects, convergence is not necessary or even usual.

More generally, again analogous to real-valued sequences, the less restrictive limit infimum and limit supremum of a set sequence always exist and can be used to determine convergence: the limit exists if the limit infimum and limit supremum are identical. (See below). Such set limits are essential in measure theory and probability.

It is a common misconception that the limits infimum and supremum described here involve sets of accumulation points, that is, sets of formula_3 where each formula_4 is in some formula_5 This is only true if convergence is determined by the discrete metric (that is, formula_6 if there is formula_7 such that formula_8 for all formula_9). This article is restricted to that situation as it is the only one relevant for measure theory and probability. See the examples below. (On the other hand, there are more general topological notions of set convergence that do involve accumulation points under different metrics or topologies.)

==Definitions==

===The two definitions===
Suppose that formula_10 is a sequence of sets. The two equivalent definitions are as follows.

* Using union and intersection: define formula_11 and formula_12 If these two sets are equal, then the set-theoretic limit of the sequence formula_13 exists and is equal to that common set. Either set as described above can be used to get the limit, and there may be other means to get the limit as well.
* Using indicator functions: let formula_14 equal formula_15 if formula_16 and formula_17 otherwise. Define formula_18 and formula_19 where the expressions inside the brackets on the right are, respectively, the limit infimum and limit supremum of the real-valued sequence formula_20 Again, if these two sets are equal, then the set-theoretic limit of the sequence formula_13 exists and is equal to that common set, and either set as described above can be used to get the limit.

To see the equivalence of the definitions, consider the limit infimum. The use of De Morgan&#x27;s law below explains why this suffices for the limit supremum. Since indicator functions take only values formula_17 and formula_23 formula_24 if and only if formula_14 takes value formula_17 only finitely many times. Equivalently, 
formula_27 
if and only if there exists formula_28 such that the element is in formula_29 for every formula_30 which is to say if and only if formula_31 for only finitely many formula_32 
Therefore, formula_33 is in the formula_34 if and only if formula_33 is in all but finitely many formula_36 For this reason, a shorthand phrase for the limit infimum is &quot;formula_33 is in formula_13 all but finitely often&quot;, typically expressed by writing &quot;formula_13 a.b.f.o.&quot;.

Similarly, an element formula_33 is in the limit supremum if, no matter how large formula_28 is, there exists formula_42 such that the element is in formula_43 That is, formula_33 is in the limit supremum if and only if formula_33 is in infinitely many formula_36 For this reason, a shorthand phrase for the limit supremum is &quot;formula_33 is in formula_13 infinitely often&quot;, typically expressed by writing &quot;formula_13 i.o.&quot;.

To put it another way, the limit infimum consists of elements that &quot;eventually stay forever&quot; (are in set after formula_28), while the limit supremum consists of elements that &quot;never leave forever&quot; (are in set after formula_28). Or more formally:

===Monotone sequences===

The sequence formula_52 is said to be nonincreasing if formula_53 for each formula_54 and nondecreasing if formula_55 for each formula_32 In each of these cases the set limit exists. Consider, for example, a nonincreasing sequence formula_57 Then 
formula_58
From these it follows that
formula_59
Similarly, if formula_52 is nondecreasing then 
formula_61

The Cantor set is defined this way.

==Properties==
* If the limit of formula_62 as formula_28 goes to infinity, exists for all formula_33 then formula_65 Otherwise, the limit for formula_52 does not exist.
* It can be shown that the limit infimum is contained in the limit supremum: formula_67 for example, simply by observing that formula_68 all but finitely often implies formula_68 infinitely often.
* Using the monotonicity of formula_70 and of formula_71 formula_72
* By using De Morgan&#x27;s law twice, with set complement formula_73 formula_74 That is, formula_68 all but finitely often is the same as formula_31 finitely often.
* From the second definition above and the definitions for limit infimum and limit supremum of a real-valued sequence, formula_77 and formula_78
* Suppose formula_79 is a -algebra of subsets of formula_80 That is, formula_79 is nonempty and is closed under complement and under unions and intersections of countably many sets. Then, by the first definition above, if each formula_82 then both formula_34 and formula_84 are elements of formula_85

==Examples==
* Let formula_86 Then
formula_87
and
formula_88
so formula_89 exists.
* Change the previous example to formula_90 Then
formula_91
and
formula_92
so formula_93 does not exist, despite the fact that the left and right endpoints of the intervals converge to 0 and 1, respectively.
* Let formula_94 Then
formula_95
is the set of all rational numbers between 0 and 1 (inclusive), since even for formula_96 and formula_97 formula_98 is an element of the above. Therefore,
formula_99
On the other hand, formula_100 which implies
formula_101
In this case, the sequence formula_1 does not have a limit. Note that formula_93 is not the set of accumulation points, which would be the entire interval formula_104 (according to the usual Euclidean metric).

==Probability uses==
Set limits, particularly the limit infimum and the limit supremum, are essential for probability and measure theory. Such limits are used to calculate (or prove) the probabilities and measures of other, more purposeful, sets. For the following, formula_105 is a probability space, which means formula_79 is a σ-algebra of subsets of formula_107 and formula_108 is a probability measure defined on that σ-algebra. Sets in the σ-algebra are known as events.

If formula_1 is a monotone sequence of events in formula_79 then formula_93 exists and
formula_112

===Borel–Cantelli lemmas===

In probability, the two Borel–Cantelli lemmas can be useful for showing that the limsup of a sequence of events has probability equal to 1 or to 0. The statement of the first (original) Borel–Cantelli lemma is

The second Borel–Cantelli lemma is a partial converse:
===Almost sure convergence===
One of the most important applications to probability is for demonstrating the almost sure convergence of a sequence of random variables. The event that a sequence of random variables formula_113 converges to another random variable formula_114 is formally expressed as formula_115 It would be a mistake, however, to write this simply as a limsup of events. That is, this the event formula_116! Instead, the of the event is 
formula_117
Therefore,
formula_118

<doc id="343671" wikidata="Q148583" url="?curid=343671" title="Cirl bunting">
<text>The cirl bunting ( ), (Emberiza cirlus), is a passerine bird in the bunting family Emberizidae, a group now separated by most modern authors from the finches, Fringillidae.

It breeds across southern Europe, on the Mediterranean islands and in north Africa. It is a resident of these warmer areas, and does not migrate in winter. It is common in all sorts of open areas with some scrub or trees, but has a preference for sunny slopes. In the 19th century it was introduced to New Zealand and the persistent population remains in the South Island.

Changes in agricultural practice have affected this species very adversely at the northern fringes of its range, and in England, where it once occurred over much of the south of the country, it is now restricted to south Devon. The cirl bunting is the mascot on the signs for the village of Stokeinteignhead in Devon.

==Taxonomy==
The cirl bunting was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1766 in the twelfth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under its current binomial name &quot;Emberiza cirlus&quot;. The genus name &quot;Emberiza&quot; is from Old German &quot;Embritz&quot;, a bunting. The specific &quot;cirlus&quot; is from a local Italian name &quot;cirlo&quot;, for a type of bunting, from &quot;zirlare&quot;, &quot;to chirp&quot;. The English &quot;cirl&quot; is derived from &quot;cirlus&quot;, &quot;probably from &quot;zirlare&quot;, to whistle as a thrush&quot;. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==
The cirl bunting is like a small yellowhammer (&quot;Emberiza citrinella&quot;), and is around in length with a wing-span . It has a thick seed-eater&#x27;s bill. The male has a bright yellow head, with a black crown, eyestripe and throat, and a greenish breast band across its otherwise yellow underparts, and a heavily streaked brown back. The female is much more like the yellowhammer, but has a streaked grey-brown rump and chestnut shoulders.

The monotonous song of the cock is rattling trill, like Arctic warbler or the terminal rattle of lesser whitethroat.

==Distribution and habitat==
The ideal farmland habitat is a mixture of grass and arable fields, divided by thick hedgerows with pockets of dense scrub. They can tolerate a certain degree of urbanisation, and are found in green spaces in towns and cities, even Rome.

They are sedentary in nature and will often travel only from their nests to forage in summer, and up to in winter to find stubble.

== Behavior and ecology ==
===Breeding===
Cirl buntings first breed when they are one year of age. The nest is at low level, within dense cover such as that provided by thick hedgerows and scrub. The ideal scrub is said to be blackthorn, hawthorn, bramble and gorse. The breeding season runs from April until mid-September, usually having two broods but occasionally three. Two to five eggs are laid, which show the hair-like markings characteristic of buntings. They are incubated only by the female and hatch 12–13 days after the last egg is laid. The young are cared for and fed by both parents. They nestlings fledge after 11–13 days but continue to be fed by their parents for a further two or three weeks.

=== Food and feeding ===
In the summer their natural food consists of invertebrates for example grasshoppers and crickets to feed their chicks. In the winter they feed on small seeds from over-wintered stubbles, fallow land, set-aside, and the over-winter feeding of stock with grain or hay. They tend to feed in flocks during the winter.

==English population==
===History===
A very small cirl bunting population exists in South Devon in England, near the small town of Kingsbridge where the pioneering ornithologist George Montagu discovered the species, as he recorded in his book, the &quot;Ornithological Dictionary&quot;, 1802. The species appears to have first colonised Britain near Kingsbridge, most likely not long before Montagu described it. It expanded from there across southern England in the nineteenth century. It retreated from the 1930s onwards, so that by 1989 the population again survived mainly near Kingsbridge. Since then, conservation efforts have increased the population more than fivefold, but it remains almost wholly in Devon.

===Conservation===
Through its Countryside Stewardship Scheme and environmental stewardship, Natural England has various options to conserve the species:

* Allow stubbles to overwinter. Leave crops such as spring barley stubble untreated (no fertiliser, pesticide, or cultivation) until the end of the following March. This allows the cirl bunting to feed over the winter on the spilt grain and seeds of broad-leaved arable weeds like fat hen, chickweed, and annual meadow grass &quot;Poa annua&quot;, which grow in the meantime. The loss of this old farming practice led to the species&#x27; decline.
* Maintain semi-improved or rough grassland and field margins, particularly tussocky grasses such as cock&#x27;s-foot. These provide an overwintering habitat for insects, which in turn provides food for the cirl bunting and their chicks.
* Sow barley-based wild bird seed mix crop. This crop has an open structure, allowing birds to forage.
* Delay spraying insecticides to provide invertebrate food for as long as possible.
* Leave hedgerows untrimmed for periods of time. This provides breeding areas and food.

A partnership between Natural England and the RSPB runs the &quot;Cirl Bunting Project&quot;, part of a larger project called &quot;Action for Birds&quot;. Through the efforts of conservation organisations and landowners, the cirl bunting population has increased from 118 pairs in 1989 to 700 pairs in 2003. However, their range has not expanded.
