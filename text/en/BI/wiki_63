<text>Worthing ( ) is a seaside town and borough in West Sussex, England, at the foot of the South Downs, west of Brighton, and east of Chichester. With a population of 113,094 and an area of , the borough is the second largest component of the Brighton and Hove built-up area, the 15th most populous urban area in the United Kingdom. Northern parts of the borough, including the Worthing Downland Estate, form part of the South Downs National Park. In 2019, the Art Deco Worthing Pier was dubbed the best in Britain.

Dating from around 4000 BC, the flint mines at Cissbury and nearby Church Hill, Blackpatch and Harrow Hill are amongst the earliest Neolithic monuments in Britain. The Iron Age hill fort of Cissbury Ring is one of Britain&#x27;s largest. The recorded history of Worthing began with the Domesday Book. Worthing is historically part of Sussex, mostly in the rape of Bramber; Goring, which forms part of the rape of Arundel, was incorporated in 1929. Worthing was a small mackerel fishing hamlet for many centuries until, in the late 18th century, it developed into an elegant Georgian seaside resort and attracted the well-known and wealthy of the day. In the 19th and 20th centuries, the area was one of Britain&#x27;s chief market gardening centres.

Modern Worthing has a large service industry, particularly in financial services. It has three theatres and one of Britain&#x27;s oldest cinemas, the Dome. Writers Oscar Wilde and Harold Pinter lived and worked in the town.

==Etymology==

The earliest known appearance of the name of Worthing is &quot;Wyrtingas&quot;, from circa AD 960. It was listed as &quot;Ordinges&quot; or &quot;Wordinges&quot; in the Domesday Book and was subsequently known as &quot;Wuroininege&quot;, &quot;Wurdingg&quot;, &quot;Wording&quot; or &quot;Wurthing&quot;, &quot;Worthinges&quot;, &quot;Wyrthyng&quot;, &quot;Worthen&quot; and &quot;Weorðingas&quot;. The modern name &quot;Worthing&quot; was first documented in AD 1297.
The etymology of the root &quot;Worth-&quot; is uncertain. &quot;Wyrt&quot; is the Old English word for &quot;plant,&quot; &quot;vegetable,&quot; &quot;herb&quot; or &quot;spice,&quot; though there is no obvious connection with the name of the town. Additionally, the &quot;y&quot; was a front-loaded vowel that was indistinguishable from &quot;i&quot; by the end of the Anglo-Saxon period and the spelling never evolved in that direction. The more obvious Middle English &quot;worth&quot; is not likely as well, as there was a dramatic Norman language influence on the spelling at the time of the Domesday Book. A more probable root is the word for an Anglo-Saxon goddess - &quot;Wyrd&quot;, known in Norse mythology as &quot;Urðr&quot; - with a shift of the alveolar consonant &quot;d&quot; to &quot;t&quot; as evidenced by the eleventh century evolution of the word.
The suffix &quot;-ing&quot; is a cognate of &quot;inge,&quot; an ethnonym for the Germanic Ingaevones peoples, said variously to mean &quot;of Yngvi&quot; - of Freyr in Norse mythology, &quot;family, people or followers of&quot; or a genitive plural form of an inhabitant appellation.

==History==

From around 4000 BC, the South Downs above Worthing was Britain&#x27;s earliest and largest flint-mining area, with four of the UK&#x27;s 14 known flint mines lying within of the centre of Worthing. Graffiti or art scratched into the chalk at Cissbury and nearby Harrow Hill may be the earliest dateable examples of Neolithic art in Britain. An excavation at Little High Street dates the earliest remains from Worthing town centre to the Bronze Age. There is also an important Bronze Age hill fort on the western fringes of the modern borough at Highdown Hill.

During the Iron Age, one of Britain&#x27;s largest hill forts was built at Cissbury Ring. The area was part of the civitas of the Regni during the Romano-British period. Several of the borough&#x27;s roads date from this era and lie in a grid layout known as centuriation. A Romano-British farmstead once stood in the centre of the town, at a site close to Worthing Town Hall. In the 5th and 6th centuries, the area became part of the Kingdom of Sussex. The place names of the area, including the name Worthing itself, date from this period.

Worthing remained an agricultural and fishing hamlet for centuries until the arrival of wealthy visitors in the 1750s. Princess Amelia stayed in the town in 1798 and the fashionable and wealthy continued to stay in Worthing, which became a town in 1803. The town expanded and elegant developments such as Park Crescent and Liverpool Terrace were begun. The area was a stronghold of smugglers in the 19th century and was the site of rioting by the Skeleton Army in the 1880s.

Oscar Wilde holidayed in the town in 1893 and 1894, writing the &quot;Importance of Being Earnest&quot; during his second visit. The town was home to several literary figures in the 20th century, including Nobel Prize-winner Harold Pinter. On 9 October 1934 violent confrontations took place in the town between protestors and Oswald Mosley&#x27;s British Union of Fascists which subsequently became known as the Battle of South Street. During the Second World War, Worthing was home to several allied military divisions in preparation for the D-Day landings.

Worthing became the world&#x27;s 229th Transition Town in October 2009. The project explored the town&#x27;s transition to life after oil, and was established by local residents as a way of planning the town&#x27;s Energy Descent Action Plan.

==Governance==

Local government for the borough of Worthing is shared between Worthing Borough Council and West Sussex County Council in a two-tier structure. Worthing Borough Council partners with neighbouring local authorities, as part of Adur and Worthing Councils and the Greater Brighton City Region. The borough is divided into 13 wards, with 11 returning three councillors and two returning two councillors to form a total council of 37 members. The borough is unparished. At the 2022 election the Labour Party won control of the council for the first time, ending 18 years of Conservative administration. 

The town currently returns nine councillors from nine single-member electoral divisions to West Sussex County Council out of a total of 70. At the 2021 West Sussex County Council election, Worthing returned five Labour and four Conservative councillors. The council is responsible for services including school education, social care and highways. The county council has been controlled by the Conservative Party since 1974, with the exception of the period 1993—97 when the council was under no overall control.

Since 2014, Worthing has also been within the area of the Greater Brighton City Region. The borough is represented on the City Region&#x27;s Economic Board by the leader of the borough council.

The town has two Members of Parliament (MPs): Beccy Cooper (Labour) for Worthing West and Tom Rutland (Labour) for East Worthing and Shoreham.

At the 2017 general election, the East Worthing and Shoreham seat became a marginal seat for the first time, with both seats having been held by their incumbents since the seats&#x27; creation before the 1997 general election. From 1945 to 1997 Worthing returned one MP. From 1945 until 2024 Worthing had always returned Conservative MPs. Until 1945 Worthing formed part of the Horsham and Worthing parliamentary constituency.

==Geography==

Worthing is situated in West Sussex in South East England, south of London and west of Brighton and Hove. Historically within Sussex, in the rape of Bramber, Worthing is built on the South Coast Plain facing the English Channel. To the north of the urban area are the chalk hills of the South Downs, which form a National Park. The suburbs of High Salvington and Findon Valley climb the lower slopes of the Downs, reaching up to the contour line, whereas the highest point in the borough reaches at Cissbury Ring. Land at Cissbury Ring and the adjacent publicly owned Worthing Downland Estate together form a area of open access land within the borough. Further high points are at West Hill (139m) north-west of High Salvington and at Highdown Hill (81m) on the boundary with Ferring. Cissbury Ring forms the only Site of Special Scientific Interest in the borough.

With a population of about 200,000, the Centre for Cities identifies the wider primary urban area of Worthing as one of the 63 largest cities and towns in the UK. Extending from Littlehampton to Lancing, the primary urban area is roughly equivalent to the present day borough and the area administered from 1933 to 1974 as the Worthing Rural District, or the 01903 Worthing telephone code area. Worthing forms the second-largest part of the Brighton and Hove built-up area, England&#x27;s 12th largest conurbation, with a population in 2011 of over 470,000. The borough of Worthing is bordered by the West Sussex local authority districts of Arun in the north and west, and Adur in the east.

Worthing is situated on a mix of two beds of sedimentary rock. The large part of the town, including the town centre is built upon chalk (part of the Chalk Group), with a bed of London clay found in a band heading west from Lancing through Broadwater and Durrington.

Worthing lies roughly midway between the Rivers Arun and Adur. The culverted Teville Stream and the partially-culverted Ferring Rife run through the town. One of the Ferring Rife&#x27;s sources is in Titnore Wood, a Site of Nature Conservation Interest and one of the last remaining blocks of ancient woodland on the coastal plain.

The development along the coastal strip is interrupted by strategic gaps at the borough boundaries in the east and west, referred to as the Goring Gap and the Sompting Gap. Each gap falling largely outside the borough boundaries. The borough of Worthing contains no nature reserves: the nearest is Widewater Lagoon in Lancing.

===Marine environment===

Lying some off the coast of Worthing, the &quot;Worthing Lumps&quot; are a series of underwater chalk cliff faces, up to high. The lumps, described as &quot;one of the best chalk reefs in Europe&quot; by the Marine Conservation Society, are home to rare fish such as blennies and the lesser spotted dogfish. The site has been declared a Site of Nature Conservation Importance (SNCI) (a site of county importance) by West Sussex County Council. Since 2013 the area has also formed part of the Kingmere Marine Conservation Zone. Just south of the shoreline lies remains of what was once an extensive kelp forest which until the 1980s stretched from Bognor Regis to Brighton and covered approximately . With only remaining, the kelp forest is now being supported to recover.

===Climate===
Worthing has a temperate oceanic climate: its Köppen climate classification is &quot;Cfb&quot;. Its mean annual temperature of is similar to that experienced along the Sussex coast, and slightly warmer than nearby areas such as the Sussex Weald. On most summer afternoons a sea breeze, sometimes known as &quot;The Worthing Effect&quot; by the local watersports community, blows from the south-west, building throughout the morning and peaking generally mid to late afternoon.

===Districts===
The naming of parts of the town reflect its growth in its formative years of the 19th century. Central parts of the town are made up of the former townships of Worthing and West Worthing, which merged in 1890 when the town gained borough status. This area comprises the town centre, East Worthing and West Worthing. To the north and west of this area are the former villages of Worthing which have old roots but only became urbanised in the 20th century. These districts sometimes share their names – although not necessarily boundaries – with local electoral wards and include the former parishes of Broadwater, Durrington, Goring and (West) Tarring, as well as Findon Valley, which was formerly part of the parish of Findon. Other areas within these parishes include High Salvington, Offington and Salvington.

==Demography==
===Population change===
According to the Office for National Statistics, Worthing&#x27;s population increased to an estimated 110,570 in 2019. Worthing is the second most densely populated local authority area in East and West Sussex, with a population density in 2011 of 33.83 people per hectare. Worthing underwent dramatic population growth both in the early 19th century as the hamlet had newly become a town and again in the 1880s. The town experienced further growth in the 1930s, and again when new estates were built, using prisoner of war labour, to the west of the town from 1948. The main driver of population growth in Worthing during the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century has been in-migration into Worthing; in particular Worthing is the most popular destination for people moving from the nearby city of Brighton and Hove, with significant numbers also moving to the borough from London.

===Age===
Worthing has a younger population than the other three districts of coastal West Sussex, albeit older than the South East average. In 2006, 26.7% of the population were between 25 and 44 years old, which is a higher proportion compared to the other districts in the coastal West Sussex area. Over the last 20 years, Worthing has seen the sharpest decline in its population aged 65 years or more with its proportion of the total population falling by 8.1% (7,000 in real terms), at a time when this age group has actually grown across the South East region and elsewhere. In contrast there have been comparatively significant increases in older families (4.5%) and family makers (4.3%) within the borough. In 2010 the estimated median age of the population of Worthing was 42.8 years, 3.2 years older than the average for the UK of 39.6 years.

===Religion===



More people in Worthing identify as Christian than any other religion (43.9% in 2021) and the borough has about 50 active Christian places of worship. Worthing&#x27;s Churches Together organisation encourages ecumenical work and links between the town&#x27;s churches.

Worthing&#x27;s first Anglican church, St Paul&#x27;s, was built in 1812; previously, worshippers had to travel to the ancient parish church of Broadwater. Residential growth in the 19th century led to several other Anglican churches opening in the town centre: Christ Church was started in 1840 and survived a closure threat in 2006; Arthur Blomfield&#x27;s St Andrew&#x27;s Church brought the controversial &quot;High Church&quot; form of worship to the town in the 1880s—its &quot;Worthing Madonna&quot; icon was particularly contentious; and Holy Trinity church opened at the same time but with less dispute.

Other Anglican churches were built in the 20th century to serve new residential areas such as High Salvington and Maybridge; and the ancient villages which were absorbed into Worthing Borough between 1890 and 1929 each had their own church: Broadwater&#x27;s had Saxon origins, St Mary&#x27;s at Goring-by-Sea was Norman (although it was rebuilt in 1837), St Andrew&#x27;s at West Tarring was 13th century, and St Botolph&#x27;s at Heene and St Symphorian&#x27;s at Durrington were rebuilt from medieval ruins. All of the borough&#x27;s churches are in the Rural Deanery of Worthing and the Diocese of Chichester.

The first Roman Catholic church in Worthing opened in 1864; the centrally located St Mary of the Angels Church has since been joined by others at East Worthing, Goring-by-Sea and High Salvington. All are in Worthing Deanery in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Arundel and Brighton. Protestant Nonconformism has a long history in Worthing: the town&#x27;s first place of worship was an Independent chapel. Methodists, Baptists, the United Reformed Church and Evangelical Christian groups each have several churches in the borough, and other denominations represented include Christadelphians, Christian Scientists, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, Mormons and Plymouth Brethren. A Coptic Orthodox church is also present in the town. The Salvation Army have been established for more than a century, but their arrival in Worthing prompted large-scale riots involving a group called the Skeleton Army. These continued intermittently for several years in the 1880s. Other Christian organisations include Worthing Churches Homeless Projects and Street Pastors.

In 2021, 1.7% of the population of Worthing were Muslim. Since 1994 the Muslim community has had a mosque at the Worthing Islamic Cultural Centre, also known as &quot;Worthing Masjid&quot; (Worthing Mosque) or &quot;Masjid Assalam&quot; (Mosque of Peace, or Mosque of Allah) which follows the Sunni tradition and holds prayer, education, and funeral services for the local community.

There are also small communities of Buddhists (0.6% in 2021) in Worthing, including a community of Triratna Buddhists. There is a small Jewish community (0.2% in 2021) and the town had a synagogue in the 1930s. In 2011, 0.7% of the population were Hindu, 0.1% were Sikh and 0.7% followed another religion. A small community of the Baháʼí Faith practises in Worthing. 45.7% claimed no religious affiliation, a figure significantly higher than the average for England and Wales of 37.2%, and 6.3% did not state their religion.

==Education==
Worthing has 22 primary schools, six secondary schools, one primary and secondary special school, two independent schools, one sixth form college and one college of higher and further education. 

Founded by 1890 as the Worthing School of Art and Science, Northbrook College&#x27;s main campus is located on the outskirts of Worthing at West Durrington, where its creative arts degrees are validated by the University of the Arts London. Northbrook&#x27;s Broadwater campus is set to close in 2025 and courses are to be consolidated at West Durrington and at the Broadwater campus of the town&#x27;s sixth form college, Worthing College. Northbrook and Worthing Colleges share a principal and are both part of the Chichester College Group.

West Sussex County Council provides six state secondary schools: Bohunt School Worthing in Broadwater is a coeducational academy school, Durrington High School and St Andrews High School and Worthing High School are all coeducational, with St Andrew&#x27;s taking in girls from 2021. Davison High School in East Worthing is a girls&#x27; school. St Oscar Romero Catholic School in Goring is a Catholic School. Our Lady of Sion School in the town centre is a private school for children aged 3–18.

==Economy and regeneration==

Worthing&#x27;s economy is dominated by the service industry, particularly financial services. Major employers include GSK, LEMO electronics, Rayner Lenses, HM Revenue &amp; Customs, the Environment Agency and Southern Water.

In October 2009, GlaxoSmithKline confirmed that 250 employees in Worthing would lose their jobs at the factory, which makes the antibiotics co-amoxiclav (Augmentin) and amoxicillin (Amoxin) and hundreds of other products. , there were approximately 43,000 jobs in the borough.

Although Worthing was voted the most profitable town in Britain for three consecutive years at the end of the 1990s, the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings 2009 found that Worthing residents&#x27; mean pre-tax pay is only £452 per week, compared to £487 for West Sussex and £535 for South East England as a whole.

In 2008, Worthing was in the top 10 urban areas in England for jobs in each of three key sectors, thought to have a significant impact on economic performance: creative, high-tech industries and knowledge-intensive business services. The 2012 UK Town and City Index from Santander UK ranked Worthing as the second highest town or city in the UK for connectivity and ranked fifth in the UK overall out of 74 towns and cities.

===Regeneration===
In June 2006, Worthing Borough Council agreed a masterplan for the town&#x27;s regeneration, focused on improving the town centre and seafront. A new £150 million development is proposed for Teville Gate, between Worthing railway station and the A24 at the northern approach to the town centre. It is expected to include two residential towers, a multiplex cinema, hotel and conference and exhibition centre. The developers are expected to apply for planning permission in the summer of 2010. Redevelopment is planned for the Grafton Street car park area; and the town&#x27;s major undercover shopping centre, the Guildbourne Centre, may be rebuilt entirely and extended to Union Place, covering the site of the town&#x27;s former police station. 
In the longer term, the area around Worthing&#x27;s museum, art gallery, library and town hall—collectively described as the &quot;Worthing Cultural and Civic Hub&quot;—is to be revamped to provide extra facilities and new housing. In 2009, Worthing Borough Council applied for a £5 million grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund to redevelop and enlarge the museum. A new £16 million municipal swimming pool, Splash Point Leisure Centre, has been designed by Stirling Prize-winning architects Wilkinson Eyre; it was opened by Paralympian Ellie Simmonds in June 2013. It has been proposed that Montague Place is pedestrianised to improve the link between the town centre and the seafront.

Completed regeneration projects include the reopening of the Dome Cinema in 2007 after major investment from the Heritage Lottery Fund, and a £5.5 million mixed-use development on the site of a former hotel near Teville Gate.

==Transport==
A turnpike was opened in 1803 to connect Worthing with London, and similar toll roads were built later in the 19th century to connect nearby villages. Stagecoach traffic grew rapidly until 1845, when the opening of a railway line from Brighton brought about an immediate decline. The former turnpike is now the A24, a primary route which runs northwards to London via Horsham and connects Worthing with the M25 motorway. Two east–west routes run through the borough: the A27 trunk road runs to Brighton in the east, and to Chichester, Portsmouth and the M27 motorway in the west. The A259 follows a coastal route between Hampshire and Kent.

Most local and long-distance buses are operated by Stagecoach South which has its origins in Southdown Motor Services—founded in 1915 with one route to Pulborough. Stagecoach in the South Downs operates several routes around the town and to Midhurst, Brighton and Portsmouth. The most frequent service, between Lancing and Durrington, was branded &quot;PULSE&quot; in 2006. Worthing-based Compass Travel have routes to Angmering, Chichester, Henfield and Lancing; and other companies serve Horsham, Crawley, Brighton and intermediate destinations. National Express coaches run between London&#x27;s Victoria Coach Station and Marine Parade. During the 1920s and 1930s, a fleet of up to 15 converted Shelvoke &amp; Drewry dustbin lorries—the Worthing Tramocars—operated local bus services alongside more conventional vehicles.

The borough has five railway stations: East Worthing, Worthing, West Worthing, Durrington-on-Sea and Goring-by-Sea. All are on the West Coastway Line and are managed and operated by Govia Thameslink Railway. Worthing opened on 24 November 1845 as a temporary terminus of the line from Brighton, which was extended to Chichester the following year and electrified in the 1930s. Regular services run to destinations such as London, Gatwick Airport, Brighton, Littlehampton and Portsmouth.

Shoreham Airport is about east of Worthing. The nearest international airport is Gatwick, about to the northeast.

==Public services==
Home Office policing in Worthing is provided by the Worthing district of the West Sussex division of Sussex Police. The district is divided into two neighbourhood policing teams—North and South—for operational purposes. The police station is in Chatsworth Road. The West Downs division&#x27;s headquarters is at Centenary House in Durrington. Worthing&#x27;s fire station has been in Broadwater since 1962. The borough had been in charge of fire protection since 1891, after several decades in which volunteers provided the service. A fire station was built on Worthing High Street in 1908; it was demolished after the move to Broadwater. The Worthing and Adur District Team, part of the West Sussex Fire and Rescue Service, employs 60 full-time and 18 retained firefighters.

Worthing Hospital is administered by the University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust. The 500-bed facility on Lyndhurst Road was founded in 1881 as an 18-bed infirmary. It replaced older hospitals on Ann Street and Chapel Road. Other medical care facilities include two mental health units (Greenacres and Meadowfield Hospital) and a 38-bed private hospital in the Grade II-listed Goring Hall.

Gas was manufactured in Worthing for nearly 100 years until 1931, but Scotia Gas Networks now supply the town through their Southern Gas Networks division. Electricity generation took place locally between 1901 and 1961; EDF Energy now supply the town. Southern Water, who have been based in Durrington since 1989, have controlled Worthing&#x27;s water supply, drainage and sewerage since 1974. The town&#x27;s first waterworks was built in 1852. Drainage and sewage disposal was poorly developed in the 19th century, but a fatal typhoid outbreak in 1893 prompted investment in sewage works and better pipes.

==Voluntary and community groups==
There are a number of voluntary and community groups active in the town ranging from small volunteer-led groups to large well established charities. There is a Council for Voluntary Service and a Volunteer Centre funded by the local authority to support voluntary action. In 2003-4 registered charities in Worthing indicated a combined income of £56 million in the submitted accounts to the Charity Commission. The Place Survey conducted in all local authority districts by central government in 2009 found that up to 24,000 people in Worthing described themselves as giving volunteer time in the community.

==Culture==

===Literature===

Salvington in Worthing was the birthplace of philosopher and scholar John Selden in 1584. Jane Austen&#x27;s unfinished final novel &quot;Sanditon&quot; is thought to have been significantly based on experiences from her stay in Worthing in 1805. Two of Percy Bysshe Shelley&#x27;s earliest works were printed in Worthing, including &quot;The Necessity of Atheism&quot; in 1811, which resulted in Shelley&#x27;s expulsion from Oxford University and falling out with his father. Shelley&#x27;s grandfather built Castle Goring and his father was the first chairman of what became Worthing Council. Oscar Wilde wrote &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; while staying in the town in the summer of 1894; its main character Jack/Ernest Worthing is named after it. In the 1960s, playwright Harold Pinter lived wrote &quot;The Homecoming&quot; at his home in Ambrose Place. Other literary figures to have lived in the town include W.E. Henley, W.H. Hudson, Stephen Spender, Dorothy Richardson, Edward Knoblock, Beatrice Hastings, Maureen Duffy, Vivien Alcock, John Oxenham and his daughter Elsie J. Oxenham.

===Film and television===
The history of film in Worthing dates back to exhibitions on Worthing Pier in 1896, and two years later William Kennedy Dickson—inventor of the Kinetoscope, a pioneering motion picture device—visited the town to film daily life. In the early 20th century, several cinemas were established, although most were short-lived. Other former cinemas include the Rivoli (1924–1960), the 2,000-capacity Plaza (1933–1968) and the 1,600-capacity Odeon (1934–1986). The Kursaal was built in 1910 as a combined skating rink and theatre by Swiss impresario Carl Adolf Seebold. It was renamed the Dome in 1915 in response to anti-German sentiment during World War I. Seebold opened the 950-capacity Dome Cinema in place of the skating rink in 1922; it is still open, and is one of Britain&#x27;s oldest operational cinemas. The Connaught Screen 2 cinema (formerly the Ritz, and before that Connaught Hall) was established in 1995.

Many films and television programmes have been filmed using Worthing as the backdrop including: Pinter&#x27;s &quot;The Birthday Party&quot; (1968), directed by William Friedkin (best known for directing &quot;The French Connection&quot; in 1971 and &quot;The Exorcist&quot; in 1973), &quot;Black Mirror&quot; (2023), &quot;Dance with a Stranger&quot; (1985), &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; (1987), &quot;Stan &amp; Ollie&quot; (2018), &quot;My Policeman&quot; (2022), &quot;Vindication Swim&quot; (2024) and &quot;Wicked Little Letters&quot; (2024) as well as the television drama series &quot;Cuffs&quot; (2015).

===Music===

Artists from Worthing include Alma Cogan, Royal Blood and The Ordinary Boys. Worthing was home in the late 1960s to the Worthing Workshop, a group of artists and musicians who included Leo Sayer, Brian James of The Damned, Billy Idol and Steamhammer, whose guitarist, Martin Quittenton, went on to co-write Rod Stewart&#x27;s UK number one hits &quot;You Wear It Well&quot; and &quot;Maggie May&quot;. For three days in 1970 a field on the outskirts of Worthing was the site of the Phun City music festival, the UK&#x27;s first large-scale free music festival and organised by two former Worthing residents, UK underground musician and author Mick Farren and Gez Cox. In the late 1980s and early 1990s Sterns Nightclub was a major centre for rave culture in the UK and Worthing continues to have a notable electronic music scene.

Music venues include the Assembly Hall, the Pavilion Theatre, The Venue, the Factory Live, Jungle and the Cellar Arts Club. The Assembly Hall is home to the Worthing Symphony Orchestra, the Worthing Philharmonic Orchestra and the Sussex International Piano Competition. Howarth of London, the UK&#x27;s largest manufacturer of professional standard oboes are based in Worthing.

===Theatre===
As of 2019 Worthing has three council-owned theatres: the Art Deco Connaught Theatre (formerly called Picturdrome), the Baroque Pavilion Theatre and the Modernist, Grade II-listed Assembly Hall, which is mostly used for musical performances (including since 1950 an annual music festival). Theatre has been performed in Worthing since 1796. Thomas Trotter, the early promoter and manager at the town&#x27;s temporary venues, was asked to open a permanent theatre in 1807; his Theatre Royal opened on 7 July of that year and operated until 1855. The building survived until 1870. The 1,000-capacity New Theatre Royal in Bath Place, run by Carl Adolf Seebold for several years, lasted from 1897 until 1929.

===Museums and galleries===
Worthing Museum and Art Gallery hosts one of the most significant costume collections in the UK. Built in 1908 as the town&#x27;s museum and library, it is expected to undergo a major redevelopment in 2020. Alfred Cortis, the first mayor of Worthing, and the international philanthropist Andrew Carnegie funded the construction.

In the visual arts, painter Copley Fielding lived at 5 Park Crescent in the mid-18th century. and more recently Jamie Hewlett and Alan Martin created cult comic figure &quot;Tank Girl&quot; while at college in the town in the 1980s. The town has a famous work by sculptor Elisabeth Frink. Uniquely in England, Desert Quartet (1990), Frink&#x27;s penultimate sculpture, was given Grade II* listing in 2007, less than 30 years from its creation. It may be seen on the building opposite Liverpool Gardens. Hand-painted by Gary Bevans over more than five years, English Martyrs&#x27; Catholic Church in Goring has the world&#x27;s only known reproduction of Michelangelo&#x27;s Sistine Chapel ceiling.

===Buildings and architecture===


Few structures in central Worthing predate the 19th century, these being a few buildings on Worthing High Street that are survivals from the early fishing hamlet of Worthing. There are some older buildings in the former villages outside the town centre. For example, parts of St Mary&#x27;s Church in Broadwater date to the Saxon period and West Tarring has several buildings from the medieval and Tudor periods, including St Andrew&#x27;s Church and the Archbishop&#x27;s Palace, which date from the 13th century.

There are 213 listed buildings in the borough of Worthing. Three of these—Castle Goring, St Mary&#x27;s Church at Broadwater and the Archbishop&#x27;s Palace at West Tarring—are classified at Grade I, which is used for buildings &quot;of exceptional interest, sometimes considered to be internationally important&quot;. Worthing Pier, Park Crescent, Beach House and several churches are also listed.

Since 1896, when Warwick House was demolished, many historic buildings have been lost and others altered. The town&#x27;s first and most distinguished theatre, the Theatre Royal, and the adjacent Omega Cottage (the home of the theatre&#x27;s first manager) were lost in 1970 when the Guildbourne Centre was built; Warne&#x27;s Hotel and the Royal Sea House burnt down; the early bath-houses which were vital to Worthing&#x27;s success as a fashionable resort were all demolished in the 20th century; Broadwater&#x27;s ancient rectory rotted away after it fell out of use in 1924; and several old streets in the town centre had all their buildings demolished for postwar redevelopment.

Pale yellow bricks have been made locally since about 1780, and are commonly encountered as a building material. Flint is the other predominant structural material: its local abundance has ensured its frequent use. The combination of flint and red brick is characteristic of Worthing. In particular, walls built alongside streets or to mark out boundaries were almost always built of flint with brick dressings, especially in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Boat porches are a unique architectural feature of Worthing. These structures surround the entrance doors of some early 19th-century houses, and take the form of a stuccoed porch with an ogee-headed roof which resembles the bottom of a boat. Historians have speculated that the cottages, examples of which are in Albert Place, Warwick Place and elsewhere, may have been built by local fishermen who used their boats as a basis for the design.

The town has a small number of residential high-rise buildings including Manor Lea at , built in 1967 and Bayside Vista at , under development and expected to be completed in 2021. The Splashpoint Leisure Centre won a World Architecture Festival award in 2013. A tall ferris wheel was opened in 2019.

===Folklore===
The Midsummer Tree, an oak, stands near Broadwater Green and is said to be around 300 years old. Until the 19th century, it was believed that on Midsummer&#x27;s Eve skeletons would rise from the tree and dance around it until dawn, when they would sink back into the ground. The legend was first recorded by folklorist Charlotte Latham in 1868. Since 2006, when the oak was saved from development, meetings have been held on Midsummers Eve there.

It was once believed that monsters known as knuckers lived in bottomless ponds called knuckerholes. There were several knuckerholes in Sussex, including one in Worthing by Ham Bridge (on the present Ham Road), close to East Worthing railway station and Teville Stream.

According to legend, a tunnel several miles long led from the now-demolished medieval Offington Hall to the Neolithic flint mines and Iron Age hill fort at Cissbury. It was said to be sealed, and there was treasure at the far end; the owner of the Hall &quot;had offered half the money to anyone who would clear out the subterranean passage and several persons had begun digging, but all had been driven back by large snakes springing at them with open mouths and angry hisses&quot;.

===Open spaces===
The town has five miles of beach and large areas of open space on the South Downs including the Worthing Downland Estate, Cissbury Ring and Highdown Hill. The town also contains a number of parks and gardens, many laid out in the Victorian and Edwardian eras.
* Beach House Green
* Beach House Park – named after nearby Beach House, the park is home to one of the world&#x27;s most well-known venues for the sport of bowls. The park is also home to a possibly unique memorial to homing pigeons that served in the Second World War.
* Broadwater Green – Broadwater&#x27;s &#x27;village green&#x27;.
* Brooklands Park
* Denton Gardens – at the southern end of Denton Gardens is an 18-hole Crazy Golf course.

* Marine Gardens
* Tarring Park
* Palatine Park
* Promenade Waterwise Garden
* Steyne Gardens – which includes a sunken garden re-landscaped in 2007 with a fountain of the Ancient Greek sea god, Triton, by sculptor William Bloye.
* Victoria Park – was donated by the Heene Estate to the poor of Worthing in commemoration of the death of Queen Victoria. (Taken from title deeds to property owned in St. Matthews Road.) The land was previously used for market gardening and once sported a paddling pool which was closed due to foot infections in the children. Victoria Park is used by clubs and casual footballers.
* West Park – has a running track and basketball court and lies next to Worthing Leisure Centre.

===Annual events===
The Worthing Festival is a multi-arts festival that is scheduled to take place in venues across Worthing in June 2023; it is intended this will take place annually. Worthing Artists&#x27; Open Houses is an annual festival of arts and crafts. In the last two weeks each July, open-air concerts take place in the town centre with a fairground along the town&#x27;s promenade. Also taking place in July, Worthing Pride has been celebrated in the town since 2018. From 2008 to 2015, Worthing was the home to the International Birdman competition.

In January, the ancient custom of wassailing takes place in Tarring to bless the apple trees. A flaming torchlit procession takes place down Tarring High Street culminating in hundreds of people gathering around an apple tree to shout, chant and sing to drive away evil spirits. The apple trees are toasted with wassail, apple cider and apple cake, followed by fireworks. On May Day, a procession and dancing takes place in Worthing town centre, culminating in the crowning of the May Queen.

==Media==

In the early 19th century, Worthing was served by newspapers with a wider geographical circulation, such as the &quot;Brighton Gazette&quot;, &quot;Brighton Herald&quot;, &quot;Sussex Daily News&quot;, &quot;Sussex Weekly Advertiser&quot; and &quot;West Sussex Gazette&quot;. Weekly or monthly publications such as the &quot;Worthing Visitors&#x27; List and Advertising Sheet&quot; (notorious for its condemnation of people who had displeased its owner, Owen Breads), the &quot;Worthing Monthly Record &amp; District Chronicle&quot; and the &quot;Worthing Intelligencer&quot; provided some local coverage from the middle of the century onwards; but the town&#x27;s first regular local newspaper was the &quot;Worthing Gazette&quot;, introduced in 1883. It favoured the Conservative Party at first, and supported the Skeleton Army&#x27;s anti-Salvation Army riots later that decade.

In 1921 its scope was extended to include Littlehampton, and it was renamed accordingly. The &quot;Worthing Herald&quot; was founded in 1920; it acquired the &quot;Gazette&quot; in 1963, but continued to publish the newspapers separately until 1981. Since then, a single newspaper has been published weekly under the &quot;Herald&quot; name, but it is officially known as the &quot;Worthing Herald incorporating the Worthing Gazette&quot;. It is now owned by Johnston Press, and has been based at Cannon House in Chatsworth Road since 1991. The Brighton-based daily &quot;The Argus&quot;, owned by Newsquest, also serves Worthing. An anarchic local newsletter called &quot;The Porkbolter&quot;, focusing on environmental issues, has been published monthly since 1997.

Worthing is served by the BBC South television studios based in Southampton, BBC South East from Tunbridge Wells, and by the ITV franchise Meridian Broadcasting, also with studios in Southampton. Television signals come from the Rowridge or Whitehawk Hill transmitters.

More Radio Worthing is Worthing&#x27;s local commercial radio station. Launched in 2003 it broadcasts from the Guildbourne Centre on 107.7FM. Heart South, a Global Radio-owned commercial station, also covers Worthing. BBC Local Radio coverage is provided by BBC Radio Sussex.

==Sport==

Worthing&#x27;s of coastline provide for watersport, especially catamaran racing, windsurfing and kitesurfing. The town has held a regatta for rowing since at least 1859.

The South Downs is commonly used for hiking and mountain-biking, with around 22 trail-heads within the borough. Both of Worthing&#x27;s golf clubs, including Worthing Golf Club are on the Downs. The Three Forts Marathon is a ultramarathon from Broadwater to the three Iron Age hill forts of Cissbury Ring, Chanctonbury Ring and Devil&#x27;s Dyke.

Worthing F.C., nicknamed &quot;The Rebels&quot; or &quot;The Mackerel Men&quot;, formed in 1886 is the town&#x27;s main football club. The men&#x27;s team play in the National League South, having won the 2021—22 Isthmian League Premier Division and the women&#x27;s team play in the FA Women&#x27;s National League South East. Worthing United F.C. nicknamed &#x27;the &quot;Mavericks&quot; were playing in the Division One of the Sussex County League in 2013. Nicknamed &quot;Worthing Raiders&quot;, Worthing Rugby Football Club play in National League 2 East and since 1977 have been based in the nearby village of Angmering. Formed in 1999 Worthing Thunder play in the National Basketball League. The Worthing Bears (now defunct) won the British Basketball League in 1992—93. Worthing Hockey Club was formed in 1896 and has a number of teams. The home pitches are at Manor Sports Ground.

The promenade is the route used by the Worthing parkrun which has been taking place since June 2016. The free, weekly timed 5 km run had 420 people attending the first event.

Alongside Johannesburg and Adelaide, Worthing is one of only three locations in the world to have hosted the men&#x27;s World Bowls Championship twice. The events were held in 1972 and 1992, both at Beach House Park, which is sometimes known as the spiritual home of bowls, and is also the venue for the annual National Championships each August. Beach House Park also hosted the Women&#x27;s World Bowls Championship in 1977.

<doc id="350230" wikidata="Q335621" url="?curid=350230" title="Thomas Denman, 3rd Baron Denman">
<text>Thomas Denman, 3rd Baron Denman, (16 November 1874 – 24 June 1954) was a British aristocrat and politician who served as the fifth Governor-General of Australia, in office from 1911 to 1914.

Denman was born into the English nobility, inheriting his title at the age of 19 from a great-uncle. He attended the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and served in the Second Boer War. Denman sat with the Liberal Party in the House of Lords, and was made a Lord-in-waiting in 1905 and Chief Whip in 1907. He was appointed to the governor-generalship at the age of 36, and remains the youngest person to have held the position. Denman and his young family were immensely popular with the general public, and he enjoyed friendly relations with Prime Minister Andrew Fisher, with whom he shared many similar political opinions. However, he suffered from ill health and returned to England after less than three years as governor-general. Denman never again held public office, but remained active in the House of Lords and briefly commanded a unit in the First World War.

==Early life and military career==
Denman was born in London on 16 November 1874, the son of Richard Denman and the former Helen Mary McMicking. His father was the grandson of Thomas Denman, 1st Baron Denman, who was Lord Chief Justice from 1832 to 1850. Denman was the second of three children, and the oldest son. His younger brother, Sir Richard Denman, was also a Liberal Party politician.

Denman&#x27;s parents divorced in 1878. His father did not remarry, and died in 1883 when his son was eight. However, his mother remarried twice – in 1879 to James Walker (annulled due to desertion), and then in 1888 to Henry Primrose (a civil servant and cousin of Lord Rosebery).

In 1894, aged 19, Denman succeeded his great-uncle as Baron Denman; he took his seat in the House of Lords on his 21st birthday. He intended a military career and was a graduate of the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. Denman began his career in the Royal Scots, where he was promoted to lieutenant on 4 March 1896, but resigned in May 1899 and was placed in the Reserve. Returning to active service following the outbreak of the Second Boer War, he was on 3 February 1900 commissioned as a lieutenant of the 11th Battalion, Imperial Yeomanry, and left Liverpool for South Africa on the SS &quot;Cymric&quot; in March 1900. He was promoted to captain in the battalion on 18 July 1900, and the following year was appointed a captain in the Middlesex (Duke of Cambridge&#x27;s Hussars) Imperial Yeomanry, followed by a promotion to major on 30 April 1902.

==Politics==
Denman had little money until 1903, when he married Gertrude Pearson, daughter of the wealthy industrialist Weetman Pearson (later Viscount Cowdray). He was then able to devote his time to public life and served in the Liberal administrations of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman and H. H. Asquith as a Lord-in-waiting (government whip in the House of Lords) from 1905 to 1907 and as Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms (government chief whip in the House of Lords) between 1907 and 1911. He was sworn of the Privy Council in 1907. In 1909, he was appointed to the Royal Victorian Order as a Knight Commander. In 1911, Lord Harcourt, the Colonial Secretary, offered Denman the post of Governor-General of Australia, apparently to get him out of domestic politics. In the 1911 Coronation Honours, Lord Denman was appointed to the Order of St Michael and St George as a Knight Grand Cross.

==Governor-General==

The Denmans arrived in Melbourne on 31 July 1911. They found Andrew Fisher&#x27;s Labor government firmly in control. As the most politically liberal Governor-General yet appointed, he got on well with the Labor ministers, and his modesty and generosity with his father-in-law&#x27;s money made him popular with the public. In October 1912, the New South Wales Premier, James McGowen &quot;evicted&quot; him from Government House, Sydney. On 12 March 1913, he inaugurated the site of the future national capital and Lady Denman formally announced its name, Canberra. On 12 March 2013, his great-nephew, the 6th Baron Denman and his wife attended celebrations in Canberra commemorating the centenary of the naming of the city.

But Denman found that he had less real political influence than any previous Governor-General. As Australia, along with the other dominions, achieved political maturity, its Prime Minister communicated directly with his British counterpart, cutting the Colonial Secretary and the Governor-General out of the loop. The appointment of an Australian High Commissioner in London further reduced the Governor-General&#x27;s diplomatic role.

In May 1913 the Labor government was unexpectedly defeated at a general election by Joseph Cook&#x27;s Liberals. But Labor retained control of the Senate and was determined to frustrate Cook&#x27;s government at every turn. By early 1914 it was clear that a constitutional crisis was developing. Denman was in poor healththat he was allergic to Australia&#x27;s national flower, the wattle, did not helpand his marriage was suffering from his wife&#x27;s unhappiness at being so far from home. He felt he lacked the strength to deal with the political situation, and in May 1914 he resigned.

The Denman Glacier in eastern Antarctica was named after Denman by Sir Douglas Mawson. It had been discovered by the Australasian Antarctic Expedition of 1911–14.

==Later years==
With the outbreak of the Great War, Denman commanded the 1st County of London Yeomanry (Middlesex, Duke of Cambridge&#x27;s Hussars) from 1914 until 1915. He held the appointment of honorary colonel of the successor unit, the 2nd Cavalry Divisional Signals (Middlesex Yeomanry), from 11 April 1923 to 13 July 1934. He remained loyal to Asquith and the Liberals and so did not hold office again, leading a quiet life until his death in Hove, Sussex, 22 days after that of his wife. He was succeeded in the barony by his son, Thomas Denman, 4th Baron Denman.

<text>Hungerford is a historic market town and civil parish in Berkshire, England, west of Newbury, east of Marlborough, and 60 miles (97 km) west of London. The population of the parish at the 2021 census was 5,869.

The Kennet and Avon Canal passes through the town alongside the River Dun, a major tributary of the River Kennet. The confluence with the Kennet is to the north of the centre, whence canal and river both continue east. Hungerford railway station is a minor stop on the Reading to Taunton Line.

== History ==


Hungerford is derived from an Anglo-Saxon name meaning &quot;ford leading to poor land&quot;. The town&#x27;s symbol is the estoile and crescent moon. The place is not described in the Domesday Book of 1086 because four ancient manors each owned some property within Hungerford, a possession located at the extreme western edge of the royal manor of Kintbury, in the ancient hundred of Kintbury. The manor of Standen Hussey, described as Standen in Wiltshire in Domesday, was later in Hungerford parish. The land was granted to Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester. When he died in 1118, he passed his English estates, including Hungerford, to his son Robert and his heirs who encouraged the town&#x27;s growth over the next 70 years.

By 1241, Hungerford called itself a borough. In the late 14th century, John of Gaunt was lord of the manor and he granted the people the lucrative fishing rights on the River Kennet. The family of Walter Hungerford, 1st Baron Hungerford originated in the town (c. 1450), although after three generations the title passed to Baroness Hungerford who married Sir Edward Hastings who became a Baron, and the family seat moved to Heytesbury, Wiltshire. In the 16th century, the parish of Hungerford was included in the formation of the hundred of Kintbury Eagle.

During the Civil War, the Earl of Essex and his army spent the night here in June 1644. In October of the same year, the Earl of Manchester’s cavalry were quartered in the town. Then, in the November, Charles I’s forces arrived in Hungerford on their way to Abingdon. During the Glorious Revolution of 1688, William of Orange was offered the Crown of England while staying at the Bear Inn in Hungerford. The Hungerford land south of the river Kennet was for centuries, until a widespread growth in cultivation in the area in the 18th century, in Savernake Forest.

===1987 Massacre===

The Hungerford massacre occurred on 19 August 1987. A 27-year-old unemployed local labourer, Michael Robert Ryan, armed with three weapons, a Type 56 assault rifle, a Beretta pistol and an M1 carbine, shot and killed 16 people in and around the town – including his mother – and wounded 15 others, then killed himself in a local school after being surrounded by armed police. All his victims were shot in the town or in nearby Savernake Forest.

Home Secretary Douglas Hurd commissioned a report on the massacre from the Chief Constable of Thames Valley Police, Colin Smith. The massacre was one of three significant firearms atrocities in the United Kingdom after the invention of rapid fire weapons such as the one involved, the other two being the Dunblane massacre and the Cumbria shootings. It led to the passing of the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988, which banned the ownership of semi-automatic centre-fire rifles, and restricted the use of shotguns with a magazine capacity of more than two rounds. The Hungerford Report confirmed that Ryan&#x27;s collection of weapons was legally licensed.

== Government ==
Hungerford is a civil parish, covering the town of Hungerford and a surrounding rural area. Anciently, the parish was divided into four tithings: Hungerford or Town, Sanden Fee, Eddington with Hidden and Newtown, and Charnham Street. North and South Standen and Charnham Street were detached parts of Wiltshire until transferred to Berkshire in 1895. Leverton and Calcot were transferred to Hungerford parish from Chilton Foliat in Wiltshire in 1894.

Parish council responsibilities are undertaken by Hungerford Town Council, which consists of fifteen volunteer councillors and committee members, supported by a full-time clerk; the mayor is elected from amongst their number. Hungerford &amp; Kintbury electoral ward, which includes eight rural parishes to the east, elects three members of West Berkshire Council (a unitary authority).

Hungerford is part of the Newbury parliamentary constituency. Hungerford participates in town twinning to foster good international relations:
* Ligueil, Indre-et-Loire, France.

== Geography ==
Hungerford is on the River Dun. It is the westernmost town in Berkshire, on the border with Wiltshire. It is in the North Wessex Downs. The highest point in the entire South East England region is the summit of Walbury Hill, from the town centre.

The Kennet and Avon Canal separates Hungerford from what might be described as the town&#x27;s only suburb, the village of Eddington. Other settlements in the parish include Upper Eddington, Leverton and Hungerford Newtown.

The town has, as its western border, a county divide which also marks the border of the South East and South West England regions; it is west of London and east of Bristol on the A4. It is almost equidistant from the towns of Newbury and Marlborough. Freeman&#x27;s Marsh, on the western edge of the town, is a Site of Special Scientific Interest.

== Transport ==

Hungerford is situated on several transport routes, including the M4 motorway with access at Junction 14, the Old Bath Road (A4), and the Kennet and Avon Canal, the latter opened in 1811. railway station is on the Reading to Taunton line; a reasonable rail service to , and means that Hungerford has developed into something of a dormitory town which has been slowly expanding since the 1980s. Many residents commute to nearby towns such as Newbury, Swindon, Marlborough, Thatcham and Reading.

==Church==

The parish church of St. Lawrence stands next to the Kennet and Avon Canal. It was rebuilt in 1814–1816 by John Pinch the elder in the Gothic Revival style. The east window contains stained glass by Lavers and Westlake. The church is a Grade II* listed building.

== Sport and leisure ==
Hungerford has a cricket team, a football team, Hungerford Town F.C., that plays at the Bulpit Lane ground, a rugby team, Hungerford RFC. and a netball club. Hungerford Archers, an archery club, uses the sports field of the John O&#x27;Gaunt School as its shooting ground. Hungerford Hares Running Club was established in 2007.

== Hocktide ==

Hungerford is the only place in the country to have continuously celebrated Hocktide or Tutti Day (the second Tuesday after Easter). Today it marks the end of the town council&#x27;s financial and administrative year, but in the past it was a more general celebration associated with the town&#x27;s great patron, John of Gaunt. Its origins are thought to lie in celebrations following King Alfred&#x27;s expulsion of the Vikings. The &quot;Bellman&quot; (or town crier) summons the Commoners of the town to the Hocktide Court held at Hungerford Town Hall, while two florally decorated &quot;Tutti Men&quot; and the &quot;Orange Man&quot; visit every house with commoners&#x27; rights (almost a hundred properties), accompanied by six Tutti Girls, drawn from the local school. Originally they collected &quot;head pennies&quot; to ensure fishing and grazing rights. Today, they largely collect kisses from each lady of the house. In the court, the town&#x27;s officers are elected for the coming year and the accounts examined. The court manages the town hall, the John of Gaunt Inn, the Common, Freeman&#x27;s Marsh, and fishing rights in the River Kennet and river Dun.

== Legends ==
There is an old legend that &quot;Hingwar the Dane&quot;, better known as Ivarr the Boneless, was drowned accidentally while crossing the Kennet here, and that the town was named after him. This stems from the, probably mistaken, belief that the Battle of Ethandun took place at Eddington in Berkshire rather than Edington, Wiltshire, or Edington, Somerset.

==Literature==
Hungerford is one of two places which arguably meet the criteria for Kennetbridge in Thomas Hardy&#x27;s novel &quot;Jude the Obscure&quot;, being &quot;a thriving town not more than a dozen miles south of Marygreen&quot; (Fawley) and is between Melchester (Salisbury) and Christminster (Oxford). The main road (A338) from Oxford to Salisbury runs through Hungerford. The other contender is the larger town of Newbury.

<text>Sullom Voe is an eight-mile-long voe or inlet off Yell Sound in the Shetland Islands. It divides the Northmavine peninsula from the remainder of the Mainland (the two are connected by an isthmus at the head of the voe known as Mavis Grind). It is well known as the location of the Sullom Voe Oil Terminal.

During the Second World War, the voe was used as a base for flying boats. With the coming of the oil terminal, the airfield was upgraded and modernised to create Scatsta Airport.

<doc id="350238" wikidata="Q1125215" url="?curid=350238" title="Trichome">
<text>Trichomes (; ) are fine outgrowths or appendages on plants, algae, lichens, and certain protists. They are of diverse structure and function. Examples are hairs, glandular hairs, scales, and papillae. A covering of any kind of hair on a plant is an indumentum, and the surface bearing them is said to be pubescent.

== Algal trichomes ==
Certain, usually filamentous, algae have the terminal cell produced into an elongate hair-like structure called a trichome. The same term is applied to such structures in some cyanobacteria, such as &quot;Spirulina&quot; and &quot;Oscillatoria&quot;. The trichomes of cyanobacteria may be unsheathed, as in &quot;Oscillatoria&quot;, or sheathed, as in &quot;Calothrix&quot;. These structures play an important role in preventing soil erosion, particularly in cold desert climates. The filamentous sheaths form a persistent sticky network that helps maintain soil structure.

==Plant trichomes==


Plant trichomes have many different features that vary between both species of plants and organs of an individual plant. These features affect the subcategories that trichomes are placed into. Some defining features include the following:

* Unicellular or multicellular
* Straight (upright with little to no branching), spiral (corkscrew-shaped) or hooked (curved apex)
* Presence of cytoplasm
* Glandular (secretory) vs. eglandular
* Tortuous, simple (unbranched and unicellular), peltate (scale-like), stellate (star-shaped)
* Adaxial vs. abaxial, referring to whether trichomes are present, respectively, on the upper surface (adaxial) or lower surface (abaxial) of a leaf or other lateral organ.

In a model organism, &quot;Cistus salviifolius&quot;, there are more adaxial trichomes present on this plant because this surface suffers from more ultraviolet (UV), solar irradiance light stress than the abaxial surface.

Trichomes can protect the plant from a large range of detriments, such as UV light, insects, transpiration, and freeze intolerance.

===Aerial surface hairs===

Trichomes on plants are epidermal outgrowths of various kinds. The terms emergences or prickles refer to outgrowths that involve more than the epidermis. This distinction is not always easily applied (see Wait-a-minute tree). Also, there are &quot;nontrichomatous&quot; epidermal cells that protrude from the surface, such as root hairs.

A common type of trichome is a hair. Plant hairs may be unicellular or multicellular, and branched or unbranched. Multicellular hairs may have one or several layers of cells. Branched hairs can be &quot;dendritic&quot; (tree-like) as in kangaroo paw (&quot;Anigozanthos&quot;), &quot;tufted&quot;, or &quot;stellate&quot; (star-shaped), as in &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot;.

Another common type of trichome is the scale or peltate hair, that has a plate or shield-shaped cluster of cells attached directly to the surface or borne on a stalk of some kind. Common examples are the leaf scales of bromeliads such as the pineapple, &quot;Rhododendron&quot; and sea buckthorn (&quot;Hippophae rhamnoides&quot;).

Any of the various types of hairs may be , producing some kind of secretion, such as the essential oils produced by mints and many other members of the family Lamiaceae.

Many terms are used to describe the surface appearance of plant organs, such as stems and leaves, referring to the presence, form and appearance of trichomes. Examples include:
* glabrous, glabrate – lacking hairs or trichomes; surface smooth
* hirsute – coarsely hairy
* hispid – having bristly hairs
* articulate – simple pluricellular-uniseriate hairs
* downy – having an almost wool-like covering of long hairs
* pilose – pubescent with long, straight, soft, spreading or erect hairs
* puberulent – minutely pubescent; having fine, short, usually erect, hairs
* puberulous – slightly covered with minute soft and erect hairs
* pubescent – bearing hairs or trichomes of any type
* strigillose – minutely strigose
* strigose – having straight hairs all pointing in more or less the same direction as along a margin or midrib
* tomentellous – minutely tomentose
* tomentose – covered with dense, matted, woolly hairs
* villosulous – minutely villous
* villous – having long, soft hairs, often curved, but not matted

The size, form, density and location of hairs on plants are extremely variable in their presence across species and even within a species on different plant organs. Several basic functions or advantages of having surface hairs can be listed. It is likely that in many cases, hairs interfere with the feeding of at least some small herbivores and, depending upon stiffness and irritability to the palate, large herbivores as well. Hairs on plants growing in areas subject to frost keep the frost away from the living surface cells. In windy locations, hairs break up the flow of air across the plant surface, reducing transpiration. Dense coatings of hairs reflect sunlight, protecting the more delicate tissues underneath in hot, dry, open habitats. In addition, in locations where much of the available moisture comes from fog drip, hairs appear to enhance this process by increasing the surface area on which water droplets can accumulate.

=== Glandular trichomes ===
Glandular trichomes have been studied extensively and are found on about 30% of plants. Their function is to secrete plant metabolites. Some of these metabolites include:

* terpenoids, which have many functions related to defense, growth, and development
* phenylpropanoids, which have a role in many plant pathways, such as secondary metabolites, stress response, and act as the mediators of plant interactions in the environment
* flavonoids
* methyl ketones
* acylsugars

=== Non-glandular trichomes ===
Non-glandular trichomes serve as structural protection against a variety of abiotic stressors, including water losses, extreme temperatures and UV radiation, and biotic threats, such as pathogen or herbivore attack.

For example, the model plant &quot;C. salviifolius&quot; is found in areas of high-light stress and poor soil conditions, along the Mediterranean coasts. It contains non-glandular, stellate and dendritic trichomes that have the ability to synthesize and store polyphenols that both affect absorbance of radiation and plant desiccation. These trichomes also contain acetylated flavonoids, which can absorb UV-B, and non-acetylated flavonoids, which absorb the longer wavelength of UV-A. In non-glandular trichomes, the only known role of flavonoids is to block out the shortest wavelengths to protect the plant; this differs from their role in glandular trichomes.

In Salix and gossypium genus, modified trichomes create the cottony fibers that allow anemochory, or wind aided dispersal. These seed trichomes are among the longest plant cells

==== Polyphenols ====
Non-glandular trichomes in the genus &quot;Cistus&quot; were found to contain presences of ellagitannins, glycosides, and kaempferol derivatives. The ellagitannins have the main purpose of helping adapt in times of nutrient-limiting stress.

== Trichome and root hair development ==
Both trichomes and root hairs, the rhizoids of many vascular plants, are lateral outgrowths of a single cell of the epidermal layer. Root hairs form from trichoblasts, the hair-forming cells on the epidermis of a plant root. Root hairs vary between 5 and 17 micrometers in diameter, and 80 to 1,500 micrometers in length (Dittmar, cited in Esau, 1965). Root hairs can survive for two to three weeks and then die off. At the same time new root hairs are continually being formed at the top of the root. This way, the root hair coverage stays the same. It is therefore understandable that repotting must be done with care, because the root hairs are being pulled off for the most part. This is why planting out may cause plants to wilt.

The genetic control of patterning of trichomes and roots hairs shares similar control mechanisms. Both processes involve a core of related transcription factors that control the initiation and development of the epidermal outgrowth. Activation of genes that encode specific protein transcription factors (named GLABRA1 (GL1), GLABRA3 (GL3) and TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA1 (TTG1)) are the major regulators of cell fate to produce trichomes or root hairs. When these genes are activated in a leaf epidermal cell, the formation of a trichrome is initiated within that cell. GL1, GL3. and TTG1 also activate negative regulators, which serve to inhibit trichrome formation in neighboring cells. This system controls the spacing of trichomes on the leaf surface. Once trichome are developed they may divide or branch. In contrast, root hairs only rarely branch. During the formation of trichomes and root hairs, many enzymes are regulated. For example, just prior to the root hair development, there is a point of elevated phosphorylase activity.

Many of what scientists know about trichome development comes from the model organism &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot;, because their trichomes are simple, unicellular, and non-glandular. The development pathway is regulated by three transcription factors: R2R3 MYB, basic helix-loop-helix, and WD40 repeat. The three groups of TFs form a trimer complex (MBW) and activate the expression of products downstream, which activates trichome formation. However, just MYBs alone act as an inhibitor by forming a negative complex.

=== Phytohormones ===
Plant phytohormones have an effect on the growth and response of plants to environmental stimuli. Some of these phytohormones are involved in trichome formation, which include gibberellic acid (GA), cytokinins (CK), and jasmonic acids (JA). GA stimulates growth of trichomes by stimulating GLABROUS1 (GL1); however, both SPINDLY and DELLA proteins repress the effects of GA, so less of these proteins create more trichomes.

Some other phytohormones that promote growth of trichomes include brassinosteroids, ethylene, and salicylic acid. This was understood by conducting experiments with mutants that have little to no amounts of each of these substances. In every case, there was less trichome formation on both plant surfaces, as well as incorrect formation of the trichomes present.

==Significance for taxonomy==
The type, presence and absence and location of trichomes are important diagnostic characters in plant identification and plant taxonomy. In forensic examination, plants such as &quot;Cannabis sativa&quot; can be identified by microscopic examination of the trichomes. Although trichomes are rarely found preserved in fossils, trichome bases are regularly found and, in some cases, their cellular structure is important for identification.

=== &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot; trichome classification ===
&quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot; trichomes are classified as being aerial, epidermal, unicellular, tubular structures.

== Significance for plant molecular biology ==
In the model plant &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot;, trichome formation is initiated by the GLABROUS1 protein. Knockouts of the corresponding gene lead to glabrous plants. This phenotype has already been used in genome editing experiments and might be of interest as visual marker for plant research to improve gene editing methods such as CRISPR/Cas9. Trichomes also serve as models for cell differentiation as well as pattern formation in plants.
==Uses==
Bean leaves have been used historically to trap bedbugs in houses in Eastern Europe. The trichomes on the bean leaves capture the insects by impaling their feet (tarsi). The leaves would then be destroyed.

Trichomes are an essential part of nest building for the European wool carder bee (&quot;Anthidium manicatum&quot;). This bee species incorporates trichomes into their nests by scraping them off of plants and using them as a lining for their nest cavities.

==Defense==
Plants may use trichomes in order to deter herbivore attacks via physical and/or chemical means, e.g. in specialized, stinging hairs of &quot;Urtica&quot; (Nettle) species that deliver inflammatory chemicals such as histamine. Studies on trichomes have been focused towards crop protection, which is the result of deterring herbivores (Brookes et al. 2016). However, some organisms have developed mechanisms to resist the effects of trichomes. The larvae of &quot;Heliconius charithonia&quot;, for example, are able to physically free themselves from trichomes, are able to bite off trichomes, and are able to form silk blankets in order to navigate the leaves better.

=== Stinging trichomes ===

Stinging trichomes vary in their morphology and distribution between species, however similar effects on large herbivores implies they serve similar functions. In areas susceptible to herbivory, higher densities of stinging trichomes were observed. In &quot;Urtica&quot;, the stinging trichomes induce a painful sensation lasting for hours upon human contact. This sensation has been attributed as a defense mechanism against large animals and small invertebrates, and plays a role in defense supplementation via secretion of metabolites. Studies suggest that this sensation involves a rapid release of toxin (such as histamine) upon contact and penetration via the globular tips of said trichomes.

<doc id="350239" wikidata="Q201097" url="?curid=350239" title="Basket">
<text>A basket is a container that is traditionally constructed from stiff fibers, and can be made from a range of materials, including wood splints, runners, and cane. While most baskets are made from plant materials, other materials such as horsehair, baleen, or metal wire can be used. Baskets are generally woven by hand. Some baskets are fitted with a lid, while others are left open on top.

==Uses==

Baskets serve utilitarian as well as aesthetic purposes. Some baskets are ceremonial, that is religious, in nature. While baskets are usually used for harvesting, storage and transport, specialized baskets are used as sieves for a variety of purposes, including cooking, processing seeds or grains, tossing gambling pieces, rattles, fans, fish traps, and laundry.
==History==

Prior to the invention of woven baskets, people used tree bark to make simple containers. These containers could be used to transport gathered food and other items, but crumbled after only a few uses. Weaving strips of bark or other plant material to support the bark containers would be the next step, followed by entirely woven baskets. The last innovation appears to be baskets so tightly woven that they could hold water.

Depending on soil conditions, baskets may or may not be preserved in the archaeological record. Sites in the Middle East show that weaving techniques were used to make mats, and possibly also baskets, circa 8000 BCE. Twined baskets date back to 7000 in Oasisamerica. Baskets made with interwoven techniques were common at 3000 BCE.

Baskets were originally designed as multi-purpose vessels to carry and store materials and to keep stray items about the home. The plant life available in a region affects the choice of material, which in turn influences the weaving technique. Rattan and other members of the Arecaceae or palm tree family, the thin grasses of temperate regions, and broad-leaved tropical bromeliads each require a different method of twisting and braiding to be made into a basket. The practice of basket making has evolved into an art. Artistic freedom allows basket makers a wide choice of colors, materials, sizes, patterns, and details.

The carrying of a basket on the head, particularly by rural women, has long been practiced. Representations of this in Ancient Greek art are called Canephorae.

==Figurative and literary usage==
The phrase &quot;to hell in a handbasket&quot; means &quot;to deteriorate rapidly&quot;. The origin of this use is unclear. &quot;Basket&quot; is sometimes used as an adjective for a person who is born out of wedlock. This occurs more commonly in British English. &quot;Basket&quot; also refers to a bulge in a man&#x27;s crotch. The word “basket” is frequently used in the colloquial “don’t put all your eggs in one basket.” In this sense, the basket is a metaphor for a chance at success.

==Materials==
Basket makers use a wide range of materials, including:

* Bamboo
* Carbon fiber
* Metal
* Palm
* Plastic

* Straw

*Wicker (traditionally made of willow, rattan, reed, and bamboo)

<doc id="350241" wikidata="Q646980" url="?curid=350241" title="Aldershot">
<text>Aldershot ( ) is a town in the Rushmoor district, Hampshire, England. It lies on heathland in the extreme north-east corner of the county, south-west of London. The town has a population of 37,131, while the Aldershot Urban Area – a loose conurbation, which also includes other towns such as Camberley and Farnborough– has a population of 243,344; it is the thirtieth-largest urban area in the UK.

Aldershot is known as the &quot;Home of the British Army&quot;, a connection which led to its rapid growth from a small village to a Victorian town.

==History==
===Early history===

The name is likely to have derived from alder trees found in the area (from the Old English &#x27;alor-sceat&#x27; meaning copse, or projecting piece of land, featuring alder trees). Any settlement, though not mentioned by name, would have been included as part of the Hundred of Crondall referred to in the Domesday Book of 1086. The Church of St Michael the Archangel is the parish church for the town and dates to the 12th century with later additions. There was almost certainly an earlier church on the site. Cistercian monks from the nearby Waverley Abbey established granges or farms on their outlying estates, including one at Aldershot by 1175 for sheep grazing. We do not know when monks from the Abbey first came to Aldershot but the first documentary evidence is from 1287 when the Crondall Rental records that at &#x27;Alreshate the Monks of Waverlye hold 31 acres of encroachment&#x27;. This area ran from the church of St Michael&#x27;s down to the area around the present Brickfields Country Park while the grange itself was near the church. John Norden&#x27;s map of Hampshire, published in the 1607 edition of William Camden&#x27;s &quot;Britannia&quot;, indicates that Aldershot was a market town.

Prior to 1850, &quot;Aldershott&quot; was little known. The area was a vast stretch of common land, a lonely wasteland unsuitable for most forms of agriculture with scant population. As it existed at the time of the Domesday Survey in 1086, the extensive settlement of Crondall in the north-east corner of Hampshire was certainly Scandinavian, for among the customs of that great manor, which included Crondall, Yateley, Farnborough, and Aldershot, that of sole inheritance by the eldest daughter in default of sons prevailed, as over a large part of Cumberland, and this is a peculiarly Norse custom.

The first recorded mention of the manor of Aldershot is in 1573 in the will of Sir John White of Aldershot (c1512–1573), alderman of London and knighted when he became Lord Mayor of London (1563-4). He left Aldershot Manor to his son Sir Robert White of Aldershot (died 1599). He in turn left the manor to be divided between his two daughters, Ellen the wife of Sir Richard Tichborne and Mary, the wife of Sir Walter Tichborne, brother of Richard. The 18th-century jurist Charles Viner lived in the town and printed his &quot;A General Abridgment of Law and Equity&quot; on a press in his home. In the 18th century, the stretch of the London to Winchester turnpike that passed through Aldershot between Bagshot and Farnham (now known as the Farnborough Road) was the scene of highway robberies. At one time it had &quot;almost as bad a reputation as Hounslow Heath&quot;. Dick Turpin is said to have operated in the area having his headquarters nearby in Farnborough, and there were sightings of Spring-heeled Jack.

===Growth in the Victorian era===
In 1854, at the time of the Crimean War, Aldershot Garrison was established as the first permanent training camp for the British Army. This led to a rapid expansion of Aldershot&#x27;s population, going from 875 in 1851 to in excess of 16,000 by 1861 (including about 9,000 from the military). Mrs Louisa Daniell arrived in the town at this time and set up her Soldiers&#x27; Home and Institute to cater for the spiritual needs of the soldiers and their families. During this period Holy Trinity church, the Presbyterian church, the Wesleyan church and Rotunda chapel were built in the town centre to cater for the spiritual needs of the increasing numbers of troops in the nearby camp and the growing civilian town. In August 1856, on her return from the Crimean War and &quot;wishing to be with her sons in the Army&quot;, Mary Seacole with her business partner Thomas Day is said to have arrived in Aldershot where they attempted to open a canteen. In her autobiography, Seacole wrote: &#x27;We set to bravely at Aldershott to retrieve our fallen fortunes, and stem off the ruin originated in the Crimea, but all in vain...&#x27;. The venture is believed to have failed through lack of funds and the two being declared bankrupt.

===Aldershot Military Tattoo===
The Aldershot Military Tattoo was an annual event dating back to 1894. In the 1920s and 1930s, the Aldershot Command Searchlight Tattoo held at the Rushmoor Arena presented displays from all branches of the services, including performances lit by flame torches. At one time the performances attracted crowds of up to 500,000 people. The Tattoo was organised to raise money for military charities. By the end of the 1930s, the event was raising around £40,000 annually. The Tattoo&#x27;s modern format, the Army Show, was cancelled in 2010 by the Ministry of Defence due to budget cuts. It was briefly revived the following year and attracted 20,000 visitors. In 2012, it was styled as the Aldershot Garrison Show, a smaller free event held on Armed Forces Day.

The Army Show was replaced in 2013 with a general Military Festival. Events were held across the town, including an art exhibition, live music, sports events and film screenings.

===During the World Wars===
In 1914, Aldershot had the largest army camp in the country with 20% of the British Army being based in and around the town. Aldershot was home for two Infantry Divisions and a Cavalry Brigade in addition to large numbers of artillery, engineers, service corps and medical services. At the start of World War I, the units based at Aldershot became the 1st Corps of the British Expeditionary Force, and soon tens of thousands of new recruits came to the large training centre in the Camp. This had a great effect on the civilian town as there was a great shortage of accommodation for the troops and many were billeted in local houses and schools. Aldershot played a vital role in the formation of Kitchener&#x27;s Army, providing the core of the Army from 1914 onwards as well as treating the wounded brought back from the trenches in France and Flanders. The Cambridge Military Hospital was the first base hospital to receive casualties directly from the Western Front and it was here that plastic surgery was first performed in the British Empire by Captain Gillies (later Sir Harold Gillies).

From 1939 to 1945 during World War II, about 330,000 Canadian troops of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Canadian Infantry Brigades passed through Aldershot for training before being deployed for the defence of the United Kingdom while much of the British Army was overseas. Additional units of the Canadian Army followed later creating the largest force of British Commonwealth troops ever to be stationed in the UK at one time. The Aldershot riot of July 1945 caused considerable damage to the town centre when disgruntled Canadian troops tired of waiting to be repatriated rioted in the streets for two evenings. In a gesture of forgiveness and goodwill, the Freedom of the Borough of Aldershot was conferred on the Canadian Army on 26 September 1945 in a ceremony held at the town&#x27;s recreation ground. In the following year Aldershot&#x27;s military prison the &#x27;Glasshouse&#x27; was burned down in prison riots.

===Post War===

A substantial rebuilding of the barracks was carried out between 1961 and 1969 by the architecture and engineering firm Building Design Partnership. The work was sped up under government pressure, and various new building technologies were employed with mixed success.

In 1974, Aldershot borough, which had been based at Aldershot Town Hall, merged with Farnborough urban district to form the Borough of Rushmoor under the provisions of the Local Government Act 1972.

After a 2009 campaign, the British Government allowed veteran Gurkha soldiers who had served for more than four years, and their families, to settle in the UK. The rise in the Nepalese population led Gerald Howarth, Conservative Member of Parliament for Aldershot, to request government assistance in expanding local public services to meet the needs of the growing population.

===1972 Aldershot bombing===

On 22 February 1972, Aldershot experienced the first in a series of mainland IRA attacks. Seven people, six of whom were civilian support staff, including five catering staff and a gardener were killed in a car bomb attack on the 16th Parachute Brigade headquarters mess. A further 19 people were injured. The bombing was claimed by the Official IRA as revenge for the Bloody Sunday massacre. The only army officer killed was Captain Gerry Weston, a Catholic British Army chaplain. An area to be developed into a memorial garden was used to mark the 40th anniversary of the bombing in 2012.

==Aldershot Military Town==
Aldershot Military Town is located between Aldershot and North Camp near Farnborough. It is a garrison town that serves as the location for the military presence in the area. It houses Aldershot Garrison&#x27;s married quarters, barracks, Army playing fields and other sporting facilities. The military town includes some local landmarks, such as the Aldershot Observatory, Aldershot Military Cemetery, the Union Building, the Royal Garrison Church and other churches. Until 1993, the town served as headquarters for the Royal Corps of Transport and the Army Catering Corps, until they were merged into the Royal Logistic Corps and moved to Princess Royal Barracks, Deepcut.

Queen Victoria and Prince Albert showed a keen interest in the establishment and development of Aldershot as a garrison town in the 1850s, at the time of the Crimean War. They had a wooden Royal Pavilion built, where they would often stay when attending reviews of the army. In 1860, Albert established and endowed the Prince Consort&#x27;s Library, which still exists today. To celebrate Queen Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee in 1897, 25,000 British and Colonial soldiers marched from Laffan&#x27;s Plain near Farnborough, reviewed by Queen Victoria. The Colonial soldiers included men from Canada, India, Africa, Australia and New Zealand .
Aldershot Military Town comes under its own military jurisdiction. It was home to the Parachute Regiment from its formation in 1940 until it moved to Colchester Garrison in 2003. Many famous people have been associated with the Military Town, including Charlie Chaplin, who made his first stage appearance in &quot;The Canteen&quot; theatre aged 5 in 1894, and Winston Churchill, who was based there in the late 19th century during his time in the Army.

The area also houses various military and regimental museums, including the Royal Army Physical Training Corps Museum and the Aldershot Military Museum, housed in a red-brick Victorian barracks. Until December 2007, the Parachute Regiment and Airborne Forces Museum was in Aldershot. It has since moved to the Imperial War Museum Duxford. The RAMC Memorial to the 314 men of the Royal Army Medical Corps who lost their lives in the Boer War of 1899-1902 is located at the top of Gun Hill.

An outline planning application has been agreed for the redevelopment of some of the former Military Town. The Aldershot Urban Extension will bring some 3,850 new homes, two new primary schools, a children&#x27;s day-care centre, additional secondary school places, community facilities, waste recycling and landscaping to an area of 150 hectares.

In 2013, the MoD announced a £100 million investment to expand Aldershot Garrison and bring 750 more service personnel and their families to settle in Aldershot.

==Landmarks==

===Wellington Statue===
A statue of the first Duke of Wellington mounted on his horse, Copenhagen, is situated on Round Hill behind the Royal Garrison Church. The statue is high, from nose to tail, over in girth, weighs 40 tons and is intricately detailed including musculature and veins. It was designed and built by Matthew Cotes Wyatt who used recycled bronze from cannons that were captured at the Battle of Waterloo. It took thirty men over three years to finish the project.

Originally, in 1846, the statue was erected at Hyde Park Corner, London on the Wellington Arch. However, Decimus Burton, architect of the arch, had tried to veto this plan for his preferred &quot;figure in a four horse chariot&quot;. Many agreed with Decimus Burton that the statue looked ridiculous since it was out of proportion. It was nicknamed &quot;The Archduke&quot; and was a popular topic in the satirical magazine &quot;Punch&quot;.

Queen Victoria claimed that the statue ruined the view of the skyline from Buckingham Palace, and she privately proposed that the statue be moved. The Duke, who had only sat for the sculptor on two or three occasions, suddenly became very attached to the statue and would not consider its removal from its arch.

In 1885, the Prince of Wales handed over the monument to Lieutenant General Anderson, the commander of the Aldershot Garrison.

===Aldershot Observatory===
The observatory is a circular red-brick building with a domed roof, and it stands on Queen&#x27;s Avenue. Inside is a telescope, 8-inch refractor, mounted on a German-type equatorial mount with a clockwork drive. The telescope and observatory building were a gift from aviation pioneer Patrick Young Alexander to the British Army, a fact which is recorded by a plaque near the observatory door. It reads: &quot;Presented to the Aldershot Army Corps by Patrick Y Alexander Esq 1906&quot;.

===The Wesleyan Church===

The former Wesleyan church on Grosvenor Road has a 100-foot tower that can be seen for miles around the town and which is described as &quot; the only significant tower in the town&quot;. Opened in 1877, the church served the Methodists of Aldershot for over 100 years and could seat 1,150 people until its closure in 1988. Today the original complex of church, Soldiers&#x27; Home and Hall has been converted into offices, a dental surgery, gymnasium and homes.

===Aldershot Buddhist Centre===
Aldershot Buddhist Centre is a Buddhist temple and community centre catering for the Buddhists of Aldershot and surrounding area, which is billed as the United Kingdom&#x27;s first Buddhist community centre. With the influx of large numbers of Nepalis into the area in recent years giving Rushmoor the largest Buddhist community in the United Kingdom, a temple and community centre to cater for their spiritual and secular needs was required. The centre was formally opened on the High Street by the 14th Dalai Lama in June 2015.

===Union Building===
When a small party of NCOs and men of the Royal Engineers arrived in November 1853 in the area that is today Princes Gardens, they were the first soldiers to arrive in Aldershot. At this time, the area was heathland with the only building in sight being the Union Poor House, built in 1629 as a sub-manor for the Tichborne family and later used as the local workhouse and a school. It was one of five permanent local buildings purchased by the War Department in 1854 as part of the development of the new Aldershot Camp, and was used by the Army from 1854 to 1879 as No 2 Station Hospital. In later years, it saw a variety of uses before being redeveloped as flats.

==Transport==

Aldershot railway station is a stop on the Alton Line; South Western Railway runs services between London Waterloo, Alton, Guildford and Ascot.

Aldershot is close to several major roads, including the M3 and the A3. Its nearest dual-carriageway roads are the A31 to the south, which heads east towards Guildford and the A3; to the east, the A331 which heads north towards Farnborough and the M3.

Bus services from Aldershot are provided by Stagecoach South. Since the closure of Aldershot bus station in May 2023 passengers now access the bus services at various on-street stops around the town centre. National Express coach services operate between London Victoria and Portsmouth twice a day.

Farnborough Airport is located away, with Heathrow and Gatwick away.

==Education==

There are various schools in Aldershot. These will be joined by two new primary schools being built as part of the Aldershot Urban extension development of 3,850 houses. This development will also be served by a further 675 secondary school places being created at the Alderwood and Wavell schools.

A mix of infants and juniors exists, including Park Primary School and St Michael&#x27;s (C of E). The infant schools are Talavera, Wellington Primary, and Bell Vue Infant School. Junior schools include: Newport County, Talavera, Wellington Secondary and St Joseph&#x27;s Primary (Catholic). Aldershot has only one secondary school, Alderwood School (formerly Heron Wood School and The Connaught School), though Ash Manor School, Farnham Heath End School, All Hallows Catholic School and The Wavell School are all local. In the town&#x27;s West End can be found Rowhill School, a special school for students of secondary age unable to attend mainstream schooling for a variety of reasons. There are also two private schools, Salesian College and Farnborough Hill School in nearby Farnborough.

==Local newspapers==
The local press is the &quot;Aldershot News &amp; Mail&quot;, a Surrey Advertiser Group broadsheet. At the end of November 2017, the &quot;Surrey-Hants Star Courier&quot;, a free tabloid, ceased publication.

==Leisure and recreation==

Following the demolition of the Theatre Royal and Hippodrome theatres in 1959 and 1961, the local council opened its own Princes Hall in 1973 as an entertainment venue. Another entertainment venue and arts centre is the West End Centre on Queens Road which is popular for small-scale theatre, music and comedy.

===Music and dance===
====The Beatles in Aldershot====

Sam Leach, their then agent and wanting to become their manager, attempted to introduce the Beatles to London agents by promoting shows at The Palais Ballroom, on the corner of Perowne Street and Queens Road in Aldershot on 9 December 1961. Leach wanted to organise a &#x27;battle of the bands&#x27; between The Beatles and Ivor Jay and the Jaywalkers from London. The show was not advertised properly and, as a result, only 18 people attended. The local newspaper, &quot;The Aldershot News&quot;, failed to publish Leach&#x27;s advertisement for the show. In addition, Ivor Jay and the Jaywalkers failed to appear. However, the band and friends had their own fun after the show, drinking ale, playing football with bingo balls and dancing the foxtrot. The noise became so loud that a neighbour called the police who shut the event down. When interviewed in 1983 about the Aldershot gig, Paul McCartney described it as &quot;the night we couldn&#x27;t get arrested, but it wasn&#x27;t for the lack of trying&quot;. After the gig, the band went on to London to join an after hours jam at the Blue Gardenia Club. Weeks after this Brian Epstein became the group&#x27;s manager.

====Rock music====

At the end of the 1990s and the start of the 2000s, an underground scene of rock bands cropped up around Aldershot. Notable bands include Reuben, Vex Red, Inter and Hundred Reasons.

====Hardcore====
The Palace (previously The Palace Cinema, The Rhythm Station, Cheeks, Vox), influenced the rapid growth of the hardcore scene from 1992 to 1995. Weekly events included Fusion (Hectic Records), Tazmania, Slammin&#x27; Vinyl and Future World. The club also groomed local talents such as DJ Sharkey, DJ Mystery, DJ Sy, DJ Unknown, Vinylgroover, DJ NS, Hixxy, MC Freestyle, MC Young, MC Smiley and Spyder MC. The location of Aldershot between Southampton and London meant the club became a mecca for Hardcore, and it was regularly sold out during this time. At the height of the club&#x27;s popularity, a teenager&#x27;s death from a suspected overdose of ecstasy was the catalyst that saw dance music leaving the club and had a negative impact on the hardcore dance scene in the Aldershot area.

===Shopping===

Union Street and Wellington Street at the centre of the town&#x27;s shopping district were pedestrianised in the 1970s when the Wellington Centre, a covered shopping centre, was built over the site of the town&#x27;s former open-air market. As of 2020, Union Street East is undergoing regeneration; the project has been referred to as Union Yard.

During the 1980s and 1990s, the Victorian shopping arcade and various other period buildings in Wellington Street were demolished to allow for the building of an extension to the Wellington Centre known as &quot;The Galleries.&quot; The Galleries has remained almost vacant for many years now and is currently under consideration for proposed redevelopment into a mixed use retail and residential scheme, with potential commercial leisure space. In 2003, a health check of the town centre concluded that, &quot;Aldershot is experiencing promising signs of revitalisation, particularly in the shopping core&quot;. This revitalisation failed to materialise, with prominent traders such as Marks and Spencer leaving the town centre.

In 2005, Rushmoor Borough Council documented the percentage of vacant shops at 10%, 8% and 7% respectively for Union Street, the Wellington Centre and Wellington Street.

The Westgate Leisure Park, which opened in 2012–2013 and which fronts onto Barrack Road, includes a Cineworld cinema, a Morrisons supermarket, and several chain restaurants, including Nando&#x27;s, Mimosa and Pizza Express. There is also a Tesco superstore located at the rear of the development.

==Parks and open spaces==

Aldershot has many parks, playgrounds and open spaces for sport, play and leisure, including Aldershot Park, Brickfields Country Park, the Municipal Gardens, Manor Park and the Princes Gardens, the latter three a short walk from the town centre.

The legacy of the Army has meant that the land for leisure use, as well as protected areas for flora and fauna, has been preserved over many years. On the Surrey border can be found Rowhill Nature Reserve which is popular with nature-lovers, dog owners, walkers and joggers.

==Sport==
Aldershot has many sports facilities including the Rushmoor Gymnastics Academy, Aldershot Tennis Centre, Aldershot Bowling, Aldershot Pools and Lido, Aldershot Garrison Sports Centre, Alderwood Leisure Centre (formerly Connaught Leisure Centre) and Alpine Snow Sports (Dry Ski Centre). Formerly the town also hosted short circuit motor racing including speedway and stock car racing. Greyhound racing took place at Aldershot Stadium, and point-to-point racing at Tweseldown. Famous running club AFD has produced top runners. Aldershot Park hosts a number of sports facilities and organisations.

===Athletics===
Aldershot is home to arguably the most successful athletics club in British and European history, Aldershot, Farnham &amp; District A.C. The club has produced many Olympians including Roger Hackney, Zola Budd, Lily Partridge and Steph Twell and specialises in middle–long distance running. The home of AFD, as it is commonly known, is the Aldershot Military Stadium, Aldershot. Blackwater Valley Runners are a social running club and organise many local races.

===Swimming===
Opened in 1930, Aldershot Lido is a traditional outdoor leisure pool that contains 1.5 million gallons of water situated on a site. The original land was a lake that had become overgrown with weeds. It was bought by the Borough Council in 1920 for £21,000 and was the focus of the council&#x27;s improvement projects for the town. The Lido became an Olympic venue in 1948 when it was the site of the swimming event in the Modern Pentathlon of that year&#x27;s London Olympic Games. The pool has extensive areas of shallow water for children to play including a large fountain at the centre. It also has a diving area and water slides. There is an adjoining 25 m indoor pool that allows all year round swimming.

===Football===

The local professional football team is Aldershot Town who compete in the Football Conference. Before 1992 the local club was Aldershot, which folded on 25 March 1992, while playing in the Football League Fourth Division. The current club was formed shortly afterwards and achieved five promotions in its first 16 seasons to return to the Football League in 2008. The previous Aldershot club&#x27;s biggest success arguably came in 1987, just five years before closure, when they became the first team to win the Football League Fourth Division promotion play-offs, at the expense of a far bigger club – Wolverhampton Wanderers.

Since 1927, the main football ground in the town, and home of both teams, is the Recreation Ground, also known as &quot;The Rec&quot;. It has a capacity for 7,100, of which 2,000 can be seated.

A number of successful current and former footballers are from the Aldershot area, including Johnny Berry, who was born in the town in 1926. He played for Birmingham City and Manchester United before his playing career was ended by injuries sustained in the Munich air disaster on 6 February 1958. He had won three league title medals with Manchester United. He later returned to Aldershot to run a sports shop with his brother Peter. He continued to live locally until he died in September 1994, at the age of 68.

Other footballers born in Aldershot include Craig Maskell (a striker for clubs including Southampton, Swindon Town and Reading) during the 1980s and 1990s, and Bruce Rioch. Rioch played for clubs including Luton Town, Aston Villa and Derby County before managing clubs including Middlesbrough and Arsenal, but played for the Scotland team during the 1970s due to his ancestry. Another player from the area is Joe Ralls who played youth football for Aldershot Town FC and currently plays for EFL Championship side Cardiff City FC. Another former notable player is current Burnley Goalkeeper Nick Pope. Pope was at Aldershot on loan from Charlton at the time.

On 25 October 2011 Aldershot Town played Manchester United at the Recreation Ground in the League Cup 4th round losing 3–0, their most successful run to date in the Carling Cup.

===Cricket===
Aldershot Cricket Club is based in Aldershot Park in the town and plays in the Thames Valley Cricket League. Army cricket matches have been played at the Officers Club Services Ground, which has also played host to home matches for Hampshire County Cricket Club. Many of these matches held first-class status.

===Hockey===
Aldershot Cricket Club shares facilities with the successful Aldershot &amp; Farnham Hockey Club who, in 2022, were looking for a more permanent base.

===Rugby union===
Formerly known as Fleet RUFC, the club started in 1991 as a pub side. The club was renamed Aldershot and Fleet RUFC (A&amp;F or the Stags) after their move in 2003 from Farnborough to their current home, Aldershot Park. With an ever-expanding juniors section, Aldershot &amp; Fleet were successful in winning the coveted RFU &quot;Seal of Approval&quot; Club of the Year 2008 for the southern region. They now play in the Hampshire 2 league. The club also hosts a Rugby League Vet&#x27;s team for over 35&#x27;s.

=== Greyhound racing ===
Greyhound racing took place regularly at the now closed Aldershot Stadium in Tongham during the 1950s.

===Stock car racing===

Aldershot Stadium was located in Oxenden Road, Tongham, and staged Stock Car racing for the first time on 30 October 1954. Together with other short-circuit formulae (including Superstox, Hot Rods, Bangers and Midgets), racing was held regularly (every Thursday evening, every Boxing Day afternoon and later on Saturdays).

The racing took place initially on a loose shale track inside the greyhound track; after Motorcycle speedway racing at the venue ceased, the shale track was replaced with a hard tarmaced surface. The track was home to the Aldershot Knights for National League team racing in 1966 and again in 1971 and 1972.

The site was the headquarters for the promoter, Spedeworth International ltd. Major national events at the track were few and far between – the most notable title race contested there being the 1975 British Superstox Championship (27 Sep 1975, won by Steve Monk).

The final meeting at Oxenden Road took place on 21 November 1992. Immediately after this date, the site was cleared for construction of the A331 Blackwater Valley Road, which forms a by-pass for Aldershot and Farnborough.

Now, short-circuit motor sport takes place in Aldershot again, at the Aldershot Raceway, Pegasus Village, Rushmoor Arena. It was founded and named by a local man and ex short circuit racing driver Malcolm Roberts, his wife Gwen and their children, in memory of and following the death of their eldest son, also Malcolm, a short circuit motor racing enthusiast. The site is now operated by Spedeworth, whilst the Roberts family relocated to a new circuit in Aldermaston, West Berkshire.

=== Speedway ===
In 1929, eight meetings were held at the 25 acres Aldershot Sports Stadium on Boxall&#x27;s Lane. The first of these was held on Wednesday 3 July 1929. Speedway returned to Aldershot in 1950 at Aldershot Stadium. The Shots featured primarily in the third tier of the sport up to 1960.

===Olympics===
Aldershot hosted three of the five events in the modern pentathlon at the 1948 London Olympics. The swimming was held in Aldershot Lido, Maida Gymnasium hosted the fencing, and the cross-country equestrian event was held at Tweseldown. All of the Olympic equestrian events, excluding the Prix des Nations, were also held at Aldershot. It was announced on 15 January 2008 that the Aldershot Military Town had been chosen as the official training camp for the British Olympic team ahead of the 2012 Olympic Games in London. However, in April 2010, it was announced that Team GB would be training at Loughborough University.&lt;ref name=&quot;lboro//2010/70_teamgb-hq&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
In 1894, a five-year old Charlie Chaplin made his first appearance on stage at the Canteen when his mother, a music-hall singer, lost her voice in the middle of a song and was booed offstage. Chaplin was taken on stage by the stage-manager and left to entertain the audience with singing, dancing and imitations, including of his mother.
The barracks scenes in the 1968 film &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot; starring David Hemmings and Trevor Howard were filmed at the old West Cavalry Barracks (now largely demolished). The gates of the South Cavalry Barracks stood in as the prison gates for the 1960 film &quot;Two-Way Stretch&quot; starring Peter Sellers, Wilfrid Hyde-White and Lionel Jeffries. Breakout (1959 film) used the East Cavalry Barracks.

The area was used for location filming of the 1970 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;The Ambassadors of Death&quot;.

Due to its architecture, Bruneval Barracks in Montgomery Lines was chosen as the location for snowy scenes in Kazan, Russia, at the end of the 2009 James Bond film &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot;. Parts of Aldershot&#x27;s military training area were also used for the opening sequence in the 2002 James Bond film &quot;Die Another Day&quot;.

The Montgomery Lines were again used for Brad Pitt&#x27;s film &quot;World War Z&quot; based on the novel by Max Brooks.

The HBO series &quot;House of the Dragon&quot; filmed a number of scenes for the third episode on the Ceaser&#x27;s Camp military training ground on the border of Farnham and Aldershot.

<text>The Atlantic wolffish (Anarhichas lupus), also known as the seawolf, Atlantic catfish, ocean catfish, devil fish, wolf eel (the common name for its Pacific relative), woof or sea cat, is a marine fish of the wolffish family Anarhichadidae, native to the North Atlantic Ocean. The numbers of the Atlantic wolffish in US waters are rapidly being depleted, most likely due to overfishing and bycatch, and it is currently a Species of Concern according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&#x27;s National Marine Fisheries Service.

Apart from their unique appearance wolffish are distinguished by the natural antifreeze they produce to keep their blood moving fluidly in their very cold habitat, involvement by both the male and female in brood bearing, and the large size of their eggs. They are also an important factor in controlling green crab and sea urchin populations, which can become overly disruptive to habitats if left unchecked. Wolffish population success is also an important indicator of the health of other bottom-dweller populations, such as Atlantic cod.

==Taxonomy==
The Atlantic wolffish was first formally described in 1758 in the 10th edition of the &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; by Carl Linnaeus with its type locality given as the &quot;northern English Ocean&quot;. When Linnaeus described it he classified it within the monotypic genus &quot;Anarhichas&quot; so today &quot;A. lupus&quot; is the type species of that genus. The specific name &quot;lupus&quot; means &quot;wolf&quot;, one of the common names for these fishes is &quot;sea wolf&quot;, the name being given because of the canine-like front teeth.

==Characteristics==

The Atlantic wolffish has retained the bodily form and general external characteristics of small blennies (Blennioidei). The largest specimen recorded measured long and weighed almost . Its body is long, subcylindrical in front, compressed in the caudal portion, smooth and slippery, the rudimentary scales being embedded and almost hidden in the skin. Atlantic wolffish vary in color, usually seen as purplish-brown, a dull olive green, or blueish gray. An even dorsal fin extends the whole length of the back, and a similar fin from the vent to the caudal fin, as in blennies. The pectorals are large and rounded and the pelvic fins are entirely absent. Its obtuse, eel-like body type makes the fish swim slowly, undulating from side to side, like an eel.

The Atlantic wolffish&#x27;s distinguishing feature, from which it gets its common name, is its extensive teeth structure. Its dentition distinguishes the Atlantic wolffish from all the other members of the family Anarhichadidae. Both the lower and upper jaws are armed with four to six fang-like, strong, conical teeth. Behind the conical teeth in the upper jaw, there are three rows of crushing teeth. The central row has four pairs of molars and the outer rows house blunted conical teeth. The lower jaw has two rows of molars behind the primary conical teeth. The wolffish&#x27;s throat is also scattered with serrated teeth.

Atlantic wolffish inhabit both the west and east coasts of the Atlantic. In the west Atlantic, they are present as far north as the Davis Strait, of the Canadian territory of Nunavut, populating the shores of Greenland, Newfoundland, and Nova Scotia, extending as far south as Cape Cod. Although they are seldom seen south of Cape Cod, there have been sightings in New Jersey. The densest populations are in Georges Bank, the Gulf of Maine and the Great South Channel. In the eastern Atlantic, they range from Russia&#x27;s White Sea and Novaya Zemlya, through the Nordic countries and British Isles, to the Bay of Biscay. A single record was reported in 1958 from the western Mediterranean Sea in the gulf of Genoa, Italy.

Atlantic wolffish are primarily stationary fish, rarely moving from their rocky homes. They are benthic dwellers, living on the hard ocean floor, frequently seen in nooks and small caves. They like cold water, at depths of . They are usually found in water temperatures of . Since they can live in near-freezing waters (salt water only freezes at slightly below ), to keep their blood moving smoothly, they contain a natural antifreeze.

Three related species (Atlantic, northern and spotted wolffish) occur in the north Atlantic. The northern wolffish has loose gelatinous flesh, but the other species are esteemed as food, both fresh and preserved. They are marketed in Britain as &quot;Scotch halibut&quot; and &quot;Scarborough woof&quot;, or, simply &quot;woof&quot; in other areas of the northeast coast, and are a popular ingredient in fish and chips.

In Iceland and Norway, the Atlantic wolfish is known as &quot;steinbítur&quot; or &quot;steinbit&quot;, which translates to &quot;stone biter&quot; in English. This name is derived from the fish&#x27;s strong jaws and teeth, which are capable of crushing hard-shelled prey such as shellfish and crustaceans. 

==Diet==
Atlantic wolffish use their strong jaws to eat hardshell molluscs, crustaceans, and echinoderms. They do not eat other fish. They are known to frequently eat large whelks (&quot;Buccinum&quot;), cockles (&quot;Polynices&quot;, &quot;Chrysodomus&quot; and &quot;Sipho&quot;), sea clams (&quot;Mactra&quot;), large hermit crabs, starfish, and sea urchins. They are an important predator of sea urchins and green crabs, whose populations escalate rapidly and can negatively affect the health of a marine system.

==Reproduction==

The manner in which Atlantic wolffish fertilize their eggs distinguishes them from many fish. Instead of the female depositing her eggs in the open ocean for the male fish to fertilize and then continue on his way, they are internally fertilized and the male wolffish stays with the nest and protects the eggs for as long as four months, until the brood is strong enough to gain independence. Their eggs are 5.5–6.0 mm in diameter, (among the largest fish eggs known), yellow tinted and opaque. The eggs are laid on the ocean floor, often in shoal water, sticking together in loose clumps, surrounded by seaweeds and stones. Atlantic wolffish mature relatively late, at age six.

==Conservation status==

According to data compiled by the National Marine Fisheries Service, since 1983, the landings from U.S. fishing vessels of Atlantic wolffish as bycatch has declined 95%, landing in 2007. In 1950, when the NMFS started collecting their data, of Atlantic wolffish were landed, worth $137,008. In 1970, ; the landings peaked in 1983 at , bringing in $455,291; rapidly depleting again and by 1990 the landings were down to , and by 2002, . The last available data from the NMFS were in 2007 at , worth a total of $100,341.

Currently, the Atlantic wolffish is categorized as a Species of Concern under the National Marine Fisheries Service. Species of Concern are those species about which the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) has some concerns regarding status and threats, but for which insufficient information is available to indicate a need to list the species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA).

On October 1, 2008, the Conservation Law Foundation (CLF), along with Dr. Erica Fuller and Dr. Les Watling, petitioned the US NMFS for the protection of the Atlantic wolffish under the ESA. The petition called for the protection of the Atlantic wolffish and wolffish habitat throughout the US northwest Atlantic waters. It recommended a designation of critical habitat be set up to close off both commercial and recreational fishing in those areas (which would overlap closed areas for various other fishing industries for the benefit of fishermen), the development of catch and release protocols, educational programs for fishermen in the Gulf of Maine area, and possession prohibitions. On January 1, 2009 the NMFS announced a positive 90-day finding that the petition was warranted, which triggered the initiation of a status review which will result in a decision on whether to list the species under the ESA. On November 6, 2009, the NMFS issued a finding that the proposed protections were not warranted.

In 2014, HELCOM classified the Atlantic wolffish population in the Baltic Sea as endangered on the IUCN Red List scale.

<text>Top Hat 25 is a series of English designed yachts made in Australia from 1964 to 1986. It came in four different &#x27;marks&#x27; (models) named Mk 0 - III. After the Mk III, another model, the Top Hat 27, was launched in 1986.

==MK 0==
The cold moulded model from 1963, four 3 mm laminations laid up with resorcinol glue on mahogany stem and main frame with laminated mahogany floors.

==MK I==
Baker built MK 1&#x27;s. Geoff Baker owned Fibreglass Yachts in NSW. These MK1&#x27;s were built from around 1965-72 and had a hand laid up Glass-reinforced plastic hull and are considered to be a little stronger than the latter models. From late 1965 TopHats were laid up using a chopper gun (glass only) and by 1968 a Robinson (Robo) chopper/resin gun was used (one of the first in Australia). 
The hull was formed in two halves and on completion, the two side moulds were bolted together and chopped strand mat(CSM) and resin applied to join the halves together. Whilst still in the mould the plywood bulkheads and stringers were fitted and laminated in place. Later a chopper gun was used to apply most of the joining laminate and stringer placement.
The keel was made from hand laid lead ingots with lead shot and resin used to form a homogeneous mass. This was topped with fibreglass and an epoxy coating was applied with the top forming the cabin sole and the space used between the two as a water tank.
The hull was then removed from the mould and the fibreglass deck was then fitted and glassed in place using CSM. Fitout would then continue to the owner&#x27;s specifications. Engines could be either fitted internally with a folding propeller or later in the decade a hole could be cut in the cockpit floor and hull and a laminated square tube allowed an outboard to be fitted. 
The MK1&#x27;s did not have a sliding hatch above the companionway as did the timber models but had a &quot;key-hole&quot; entry (semi-elliptical shaped cabin top above companionway). Above sat the mainsheet traveller, which was a raised stainless steel tube following the contour of the cabin while some were later fitted with a conventional horizontal traveller. The cabin profile had a step down to the mast the main sheet winches mounted on steel struts. For accommodation, the original standard timber boat had four berths, a centrally located galley and a large chart table as Illingworth placed great importance on the role of the navigator, whilst with many of the MK1&#x27;s the interior layout was often left up to the individual. However, most were built with an enclosed head, vee-berths forward, central galley and settee berths port and starboard. 
Formit Fibreglass brought the moulds from Fibreglass Yachts and produce eight MK1&#x27;s in 1972.

==MK II==
Mike Garrett of Formit asked a Sydney Naval architect to improve the cabin layout and look at the boats sailing lines. The cabin layout was modernised but the Naval architect couldn&#x27;t improve Illingworths original underwater lines. The new MK2 was released in November 1972 and had a relocated forward hatch, anchor well, wider and fatter cabin top and streamlining. A lock-up toilet was still available but an MK2 A appeared with a toilet forward and an oilskin locker!

==MK III==
The MK3 appeared in 1976 and was usually characterised by a single sleek tinted acrylic glass window on either side of the cabin. However the traditional windows of three per side was still available and could be specified if required.
Two interior designs were available. The A is the racing version with the head between the forward bunks and a hanging locker in the main saloon for wet weather gear etc.
The B is a full lock-up toilet version with a smallish but manageable compartment with toilet, hand basin etc., aimed at the small family cruising market. A single deep cockpit locker was provided on the port side which allowed for a good sized quarter berth on the starboard side.

The basic hull remained the same with the near full length keel and a keel hung rudder. Ballast of 1234 kg (2721 lb), which was 321 lbs more than the Mark 1&#x27;s, of lead or steel shot in the keel and a displacement of 2580 kg (5688 lb), makes a safe ballast ratio of 48%. The hulls were gun sprayed in two halves, joined down the middle and then steel shot ballast was cemented into the keel.

==Top Hat 27==
The Top Hat 27 was created to be used in the charter industry. The Top Hat 27 model is in fact an extended the Top Hat. There were 4 built before production ceased. After this Formit was taken over by other interests and started to re-focus their business to other markets .
Unfortunately there are no official specifications of the boat.

==Top Hat 30&#x27;s.==

Formit sold a few yachts they called the Top Hat 30 and 32, but they were from another design and the only connection is the name. 
These so-called Top Hats are not considered to be Top Hats.</text><links>

<text>Bernard-Henri Georges Lévy (; ; born 5 November 1948) is a French public intellectual. Often referred to in France simply as BHL, he was one of the leaders of the &quot;Nouveaux Philosophes&quot; (New Philosophers) movement in 1976. His opinions, political activism and publications have also been the subject of several controversies over the years.

== Life and career ==

=== Early life and career ===
Lévy was born in 1948 in Béni Saf, French Algeria, to an affluent Sephardic Jewish (Algerian-Jewish) family. His family moved to Paris a few months after his birth. He is the son of Dina (Siboni) and André Lévy, the founder and manager of a timber company, Becob, and became a multimillionaire from his business. He is the brother of .

Inspired by a call for an International Brigade to aid Bangladeshi separatists made by André Malraux, he became a war correspondent for &quot;Combat&quot; in 1971, covering the Bangladesh Liberation War against Pakistan. The next year he worked as a civil servant for the newly established Bangladesh Ministry of Economy and Planning. His experience in Bangladesh was the source of his first book, &quot;Bangla-Desh, Nationalisme dans la révolution&quot; (&quot;Bangladesh, Nationalism in the Revolution&quot;, 1973). He visited Bangladesh again in 2014 to speak at the launch of the first Bengali translation of this book and to open a memorial garden for Malraux at Dhaka University.

=== New Philosophers ===
After his return to France, Lévy became a lecturer at the University of Strasbourg where he taught a course on epistemology. He also taught philosophy at the École normale supérieure. He was a founder of the New Philosophers (&quot;Nouveaux Philosophes&quot;) school. This was a group of young intellectuals who were disenchanted with communist and socialist responses to the near-revolutionary upheavals in France of May 1968, and who developed an uncompromising moral critique of Marxist and socialist dogmas.

=== Notable books ===

==== &quot;In the Footsteps of Tocqueville&quot; ====

Although Lévy&#x27;s books have been translated into the English language since &quot;La Barbarie à visage humain&quot;, his breakthrough in gaining a wider US audience was the publication of a series of essays between May and November 2005 for &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, later collected as a book. In preparation for the series, &quot;In the Footsteps of Tocqueville&quot;, Lévy crisscrossed the United States, interviewing Americans, and recording his observations, with direct reference to his acclaimed predecessor, Alexis de Tocqueville. His work was published in serial form in the magazine and collected as a book by the same title. The book was widely criticized in the United States, with Garrison Keillor publishing a damning review on the front page of &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;.

==== &quot;The Spirit of Judaism&quot; ====

In February 2016, Lévy published a book entitled &quot;L&#x27;Esprit du Judaisme&quot;. An English version, &quot;The Genius of Judaism&quot;, was published by Random House in January 2017. Liam Hoare wrote in &quot;Moment&quot; that the book examines &quot;the humanism, ethics and politics of Judaism, as well as address[es] the issues of Israel and anti-Semitism in France today&quot;.

=== Notable movies ===
==== &quot;Peshmerga&quot; ====
Lévy&#x27;s involvement with the Kurdish cause goes back to the early 1990s. On 16 May 2016, Bernard-Henri Lévy&#x27;s new documentary film, &quot;Peshmerga&quot;, was chosen by the Cannes Film Festival as a special screening to its official selection. Lévy developed his vision of the Iraqi Civil War, through the Peshmerga fighters (Kurdish fighters armed by Westerners and fighting in particular against Daesh). It consists of images shot on the spot by a small team, especially with the help of drones. It portrays notably the female regiments of the Peshmerga army.

The movie itself is, as stated in its official Cannes presentation:

&quot;The third part of a trilogy, opus three of a documentary made and lived in real-time, the missing piece of the puzzle of a lifetime, the desperate search for enlightened Islam. Where is that other Islam strong enough to defeat the Islam of the fundamentalists? Who embodies it? Who sustains it? Where are the men and women who in word and deed strive for that enlightened Islam, the Islam of law and human rights, an Islam that stands for women and their rights, that is faithful to the lofty thinking of Averroes, Abd al-Qadir al-Jilani, Ibn Tufail, and Rumi? ...&quot;

&quot;Here, with this third film, this hymn to Kurdistan and the exception that it embodies, I have the feeling of possibly reaching my goal. Kurdistan is Sunnis and Shiites, Chaldeans, Assyrians, Aramaic-speaking Syrians living freely with Muslims, the memory of the Jews of Aqrah, secularism, freedom of conscience and belief. It is where one can run into a Jewish Barzani on the forward line of a front held, 50 kilometers from Erbil, by his distant cousin, a Muslim, Sirwan Barazi... Better than the Arab Spring. The Bosnian dream achieved. My dream. There is no longer really any doubt. Enlightened Islam exists: I found it in Erbil.&quot;

A year later, Lévy said that &quot;Jews have a special obligation to support the Kurds&quot;, and that he hopes &quot;they will come say to the Peshmerga: &#x27;For years now you have spilled your blood to defend the values of our shared civilization. Now it is our turn to defend your right to live freely and independently.

==== &quot;The Will to See&quot; ====
This documentary, released in 2022, shows Lévy visiting several countries before and during the COVID-19 pandemic as he documents various atrocities and humanitarian crises.

==== &quot;Glory to the Heroes&quot; ====
Since 2022, Lévy made three documentaries on the Russian invasion of Ukraine: Why Ukraine, Slava Ukraini and &quot;Glory to the Heroes&quot;.

== Political activism and social involvement ==
=== 1980s and 1990s ===
In 1981, Lévy published &quot;L&#x27;Idéologie française&quot; (&quot;The French Ideology&quot;), arguably his most influential work, in which he offers a dark picture of French history. It was strongly criticised for its journalistic character and unbalanced approach to French history by some of the most respected French academics, including Marxism-critic Raymond Aron.

In the 1990s, Lévy called for European and American intervention in the Bosnian War during the breakup of Yugoslavia. He spoke about the Serb POW camps which were holding Bosniaks. He referred to the Jewish experience in the Holocaust as providing a lesson that mass murder cannot be ignored by those in other nations.

At the end of the 1990s, with Benny Lévy and Alain Finkielkraut, Lévy founded an Institute on Levinassian Studies at Jerusalem, in honour of Emmanuel Levinas.

=== 2000s ===
Through the 2000s, Lévy argued that the world must pay more attention to the crisis in Darfur.

In 2006, Lévy joined the British debate over Muslim women&#x27;s veils by suggesting to &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; that wearing a veil had the effect of dehumanizing the wearer by hiding her face – and said, alluding to a passage by Emmanuel Levinas, that &quot;the veil is an invitation to rape&quot;.

Lévy has reported from troubled zones during wartime, to attract public opinion, in France and abroad, over those political changes. In August 2008, Lévy reported from South Ossetia, Georgia, during the 2008 Russia-Georgian War; on that occasion he interviewed the President of Georgia, Mikheil Saakashvili.

In 2009, Lévy signed a petition in support of film director Roman Polanski, calling for his release after Polanski was arrested in Switzerland in relation to his 1977 charge for drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl.

=== 2010s ===

In January 2010, Lévy publicly defended Popes Pius XII and Benedict XVI against political attacks directed against them from within the Jewish community.

At the opening of the &quot;Democracy and its Challenges&quot; conference in Tel Aviv (May 2010), Lévy gave a very high estimation of the Israel Defense Forces, saying &quot;I have never seen such a democratic army, which asks itself so many moral questions. There is something unusually vital about Israeli democracy.&quot;

In March 2011, he engaged in talks with Libyan rebels in Benghazi, and publicly promoted the international acknowledgement of the recently formed National Transitional Council. Later that month, worried about the 2011 Libyan civil war, he prompted and then supported Nicolas Sarkozy&#x27;s seeking to persuade Washington, and ultimately the United Nations, to intervene in Libya, ostensibly to prevent a massacre in Benghazi.

In May 2011, Lévy defended IMF Chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn when Kahn was accused of sexually assaulting a chambermaid in New York City. Lévy questioned the credibility of the charges against Strauss-Kahn, asking &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;, &quot;how a chambermaid could have walked in alone, contrary to the habitual practice of most of New York&#x27;s grand hotels of sending a &#x27;cleaning brigade&#x27; of two people, into the room of one of the most closely watched figures on the planet.&quot;

In May 2011, Lévy argued for military intervention in Syria against Bashar al-Assad after violence against civilians in response to the 2011 Syrian uprising. He repeated his position in a letter to the &quot;Weekly Standard&quot; in August 2013.

On 9 November 2011, his book, &quot;La guerre sans l&#x27;aimer&quot;, which tells the story of his Libyan spring, was published.

In April 2013, he was convicted by a French court for libelling journalist Bernard Cassen.

In 2013, Lévy criticized the international community for their acts during the Bosnian genocide.

Levy travelled to Kyiv, Ukraine during the Euromaidan in February 2014, actively promoting the events. In February 2015, he performed his play &quot;Hotel Europa&quot; at the National Opera of Ukraine on the first anniversary of the Euromaidan&#x27;s toppling of the pro-Russian oligarchy of Viktor Yanukovych.

In April 2014, he visited Bangladesh for the first time since 1972 to speak at the launch of the first Bengali translation of his first book &quot;Bangla-Desh, Nationalisme dans la révolution&quot; (&quot;Bangladesh, Nationalism in the Revolution&quot;, 1973), and to open a memorial garden for Malraux at Dhaka University.

On 5 June 2018, he performed his one-man play &quot;Last Exit before Brexit&quot; at the Cadogan Hall in London. The play is a revised version of &quot;Hotel Europa&quot; and argues passionately that Brexit should be abandoned.

In December 2019, Lévy visited the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria, where he met Kurdish fighters led by General Mazloum Abdi.

=== 2020s ===
In July 2020, Lévy arrived on Misrata Airport in Libya, then he met some Government of National Accord officials; his visit was met with protests near Tarhuna.

Regarding the Israeli invasion of Gaza, Lévy wrote as reported in the French newspaper &quot;Le Figaro&quot;: &quot;we need to say it again, the death of civilians in Gaza is not a massacre&quot; (translated from original French: &quot;il faut le redire, la mort des civils de Gaza n&#x27;est pas un massacre.&quot;)

On 12 April 2024, in an investigation closed in Tunisia, Bernard-Henri Lévy is accused of maintaining relations with Tunisian lobbyist Kamel Eltaïef and of having interceded to prevent the production of phosphate in Tunisia for the benefit of other countries in the region. Bernard-Henri Lévy is also accused of having propagated &quot;Masonic&quot; ideology through charitable organizations and Tunisian personalities indicted in the case, in addition to working towards the normalization of relations between Tunisia and Israel and of being a &quot;member of Mossad&quot;, the Israeli intelligence service, the investigating judge considering that he had sufficient evidence to initiate proceedings.

In February 2025, Lévy acknowledged that Europe could not depend further just on the United States and NATO for defense, but advocated that Europe should fund and have its own army, under European command.

== Criticisms and controversies ==
Early essays, such as &quot;Le Testament de Dieu&quot; or &quot;L&#x27;Idéologie française&quot; faced strong rebuttals from noted intellectuals on all sides of the ideological spectrum, such as historian Pierre Vidal-Naquet and philosophers Cornelius Castoriadis, Raymond Aron, and Gilles Deleuze, who called Lévy&#x27;s methods &quot;vile&quot;.

More recently, Lévy was publicly embarrassed when his essay &quot;De la guerre en philosophie&quot; (2010) cited the writings of French philosopher Jean-Baptiste Botul. Botul&#x27;s writings are actually well-known spoofs, and Botul himself is the purely fictional creation of a living French journalist and philosopher, Frédéric Pagès. The obviousness of the hoax, with Botul&#x27;s philosophy being &quot;botulism&quot;, led to suspicions that Lévy had not read Botul, and that he consequently might have used a ghostwriter for his book. Responding in an opinion piece, Lévy wrote: &quot;It was a truly brilliant and very believable hoax from the mind of a &quot;Canard Enchaîné&quot; journalist who remains a good philosopher all the same. So I was caught, as were the critics who reviewed the book when it came out. The only thing left to say, with no hard feelings, is kudos to the artist.&quot;

In the essay &quot;Une imposture française&quot;, journalists Nicolas Beau and Olivier Toscer claim that Lévy uses his unique position as an influential member of both the literary and business establishments in France to be the go-between of the two worlds, which helps him to get positive reviews as marks of gratitude, while silencing dissenters. For instance, Beau and Toscer noted that most of the reviews published in France for &quot;Who Killed Daniel Pearl?&quot; did not mention the strong denials about the book given by experts and by Pearl&#x27;s own family including wife Mariane Pearl.

=== &quot;Who Killed Daniel Pearl?&quot; ===

In 2003, Lévy wrote an account of his efforts to track the murderer of Daniel Pearl, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reporter who was taken captive and beheaded by Islamic extremists the previous year. At the time of Pearl&#x27;s death, Lévy was visiting Afghanistan as French President Jacques Chirac&#x27;s special envoy. He spent the next year in Pakistan, India, Europe and the United States trying to uncover why Pearl&#x27;s captors held and executed him. The resulting book, &quot;Who Killed Daniel Pearl?&quot;, argues it was because Pearl knew too much about the links between Pakistan&#x27;s Inter-Services Intelligence and al-Qaeda. The book was strongly criticized by both experts and Pearl&#x27;s own family, including wife Mariane Pearl who called Lévy &quot;a man whose intelligence is destroyed by his own ego&quot;.

The book was condemned by William Dalrymple, a British historian of India and travel writer, and others, for its lack of rigour and its caricatured depictions of Pakistani society. Dalrymple also criticized Lévy&#x27;s fictionalised account of Pearl&#x27;s thoughts in the last moments of his life.

=== Threats ===
Lévy was one of six Jewish public figures in Europe targeted for assassination by a Belgium-based Islamist militant group in 2008. The list included others in France such as Josy Eisenberg. That plot was foiled after the group&#x27;s leader, Abdelkader Belliraj, was arrested on unrelated murder charges from the 1980s.

=== Satirical portrayals in popular culture ===

In &quot;Asterix and the White Iris&quot;, Julius Caesar&#x27;s personal advisor Libellus Blockbustus has been officially described as a caricature modelled on Lévy, among other contemporary French figures.

== Personal life ==
Lévy has been married three times. His eldest daughter by his first marriage to Isabelle Doutreluigne, Justine Lévy, is a best-selling novelist. He has a son, attorney , by his second wife, Sylvie Bouscasse. He is currently married to French actress and singer Arielle Dombasle. The affair between Lévy and English socialite Daphne Guinness was an open secret known amongst US society columnists since 2008. On 13 July 2010, Daphne Guinness confirmed the stories to &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;.

Lévy is Jewish, and he has said that Jews ought to provide a unique Jewish moral voice in society and politics.

Lévy has been friends with Nicolas Sarkozy since 1983. Relations between them deteriorated during Sarkozy&#x27;s 2007 presidential run in which Lévy backed the Socialist candidate Ségolène Royal and also described Sarkozy as &quot;A man with a warrior vision of politics&quot;. However, they grew closer again after Sarkozy&#x27;s victory.

In 2004, his fortune amounted to 150 million euros. The owner of seven companies, he inherited most of the fortune from his parents, which was complemented by stock exchange investments. In 2000 he was suspected of insider trading by the &quot;Commission des opérations de bourse&quot;.

<doc id="350259" wikidata="Q33037" url="?curid=350259" title="Flag of Gibraltar">
<text>The flag of Gibraltar is an elongated banner of arms based on the coat of arms of Gibraltar, granted by Royal Warrant from Queen Isabella I of Castile on 10 July 1502. The flag of Gibraltar is unique as it is the only British Overseas Territory which does not feature the Union Jack in any form, although the latter is widely flown as a standalone flag within the territory.

==Description==

The flag was regularised in 1982 and is formed by two horizontal bands of white (top, double width) and red with a three-towered red castle in the centre of the white band; hanging from the castle gate is a gold key centred in the red band. The flag differs from that of other British overseas territories, in that it is not a British ensign nor does it feature the Union Jack in any form. The castle does not resemble any in Gibraltar but is supposed to represent the fortress of Gibraltar. The key is said to symbolise the fortress&#x27; significance as Gibraltar was seen to be the &quot;key to Spain&quot; by the Moors and Spanish and later as the &quot;key to the Mediterranean&quot; by the British.

==Use==
The flag is flown throughout Gibraltar, sometimes officially alongside the Union Flag and the Commonwealth Flag. Prominent places which fly the flag include the frontier with Spain, at the top of The Rock and on the Parliament Building.

The flag is a symbol of Gibraltarian nationalism and is very popular among Gibraltarians. For the Gibraltar National Day (10 September), many Gibraltar homes and offices hang the flag from their windows and balconies, and some individuals even wear and dress their vehicles with the flag for national day celebrations. This was also seen during the 2004 celebrations of the tercentenary of British Gibraltar.

Gibraltarian students attending university abroad have been known to take Gibraltarian flags with them, putting them up in university accommodation rooms and hanging them from windows.

A Lego flag of Gibraltar 4 metres (10&#x27;) high and 8 metres (30&#x27;) long can be seen at the John Mackintosh Hall, which is a cultural centre housing the public library as well as exhibition rooms and a theatre. At the time of its construction, the Lego flag of Gibraltar was the largest flag ever to be made from Lego bricks with a total of 393,857 bricks being used.

<text>David Alan Cherry (born December 14, 1949) is an American artist, author, and illustrator of science fiction and fantasy and has also done substantial work as a marketing artist, concept artist, and 3D modeler in the game production industry. Cherry served as Lecturer and Head of the Art Department as well as Head of the master&#x27;s degree Program for artists at The Guildhall at SMU (Southern Methodist University), a graduate college dedicated to studies for people who want to work in the game production industry. Cherry was also an attorney, as well as a past president of the Association of Science Fiction and Fantasy Artists (1988–1990). He has been nominated eleven times for Hugo Awards, and 18 times for Chesley Awards (with 8 wins).

Although at ease with oil painting and most other traditional media, Cherry usually works in acrylic paint. As an illustrator of literary works, Cherry has illustrated or done cover art for the works of such authors as Stephen R. Donaldson, Marion Zimmer Bradley, Lois McMaster Bujold, Terry Brooks, William Shatner, David Brin, L. Sprague de Camp, Poul Anderson, Piers Anthony, John Brunner, and his sister, C. J. Cherryh, among others. Publishers for whom Cherry has worked include DAW Books; New American Library; Ballantine Books; Del Rey Books; Ace Books; TOR Books; Friedlander Publishing Group; Pocket Books; Phantasia Press; Donald M. Grant Publishing; The Hamilton Collection; Skybox Press; The Science Fiction Book Club; Bits and Pieces; Precedence Publishing; Pegasus Publishing; Iron Crown Enterprises; The Bradford Exchange; The Donning Company Publishers; and many others.

== Biography: 1949–1982 ==
David Alan Cherry was born in Lawton, Oklahoma to Basil Lafayette Cherry and Lois Ruth Cherry. Cherry&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Robert Edward Cherry, was a cowboy punching cattle in the new state of Oklahoma when Basil was born. Cherry&#x27;s parents are from Anadarko, Oklahoma. Cherry&#x27;s only sibling is Carolyn Janice Cherry, better known as C. J. Cherryh, one of the top authors of fantasy and science fiction. C.J. was seven when David was born.

Cherry&#x27;’s mother home-schooled him for kindergarten with the result that when he entered first grade at B.C. Sweeney Elementary in Lawton, he could write and was reading at a fourth-grade level. When he was nine, Cherry’s family moved to Oklahoma City where he attended first Andrew Johnson Elementary then Ridgeview Elementary, Herbert Hoover Junior High School, and John Marshall High School. He learned art mostly from his sister, C.J. Cherryh, whom he credits with teaching him the basics of color theory and proportion. Cherry’s sister also graduated from John Marshall High School seven years ahead of him. In college, she majored in Classics at the University of Oklahoma. After graduation with Honors, C.J. received a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship pursuant to which she obtained a Master’s degree in Classics from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, MD. All of this led C.J. back to Oklahoma City and John Marshall High School where she became a teacher and had Cherry as a student during his senior year for Latin and Ancient History.

When it was Cherry’s turn to go to college, he too attended the University of Oklahoma. He wanted to study art, but decided against it when he saw that the art schools available to him only taught modern art, which he described as &quot;throwing paint at a board and then melting toy tanks over it in protest to the Vietnam War&quot;. Instead, he majored in Latin and took as many courses as possible in Greek, French, German, and Ancient History. He graduated in 1972 scholastically in the top ten percent of the nation with a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Latin, General Honors, and admission to Phi Beta Kappa. Cherry then entered the University of Oklahoma School of Law and graduated with a Juris Doctor degree in 1975.

From 1975 through 1982 Cherry practiced law in Oklahoma City and Edmond, Oklahoma specializing in Transportation Law before the Interstate Commerce Commission. In 1976 two of C.J. Cherryh&#x27;s novels were published by DAW Books and Cherry accompanied her to the 1976 World Science Fiction Convention in Kansas City. There he met many writers, editors, and publishers as well as a number of the artists who were doing paintings for science fiction and fantasy book covers. Michael Whelan, in particular, stood out. Cherry already knew who he was since Michael had done the art for C.J.’s book covers as well as the art for the cover of the Marion Zimmer Bradley book Cherry happened to be reading at the time. The original painting was on display in an art show at the convention, and Cherry was able to buy it at auction. Later that evening Cherry was able to meet Michael at a dinner that C.J.’s publisher, Donald A. Wollheim of DAW Books, had invited them to. Cherry credits that meeting for inspiring him to make the transition from attorney to illustrator.

In 1981, C.J. Cherryh encouraged Cherry to do the cover and interior illustrations for &quot;Ealdwood&quot;, a fantasy novella C. J. was bringing out with Donald M. Grant Publishing. In 1982, Cherry closed the doors of his law firm and concentrated on increasing his skills with pencil and paint. His problem was that the work on &quot;Ealdwood&quot; was pretty much the only color work he had ever done. As a painter, he still had much to learn.

== Biography: 1982–2000 ==
In 1987 Cherry took home two Chesley Awards, one for Best Cover Illustration and one for Best Color Work. The Chesley Awards are presented annually by ASFA, The Association of Science Fiction and Fantasy Artists to honor excellence in the field. In the years to come, Cherry would be nominated for sixteen more Chesley Awards, six of which he would win. Cherry would win virtually every other award available for his art except the Hugo Award for Best Artist. He would be nominated for that award 10 times.

Another important landmark in Cherry&#x27;s career occurred in 1987. The Donning Company Publishers brought out a book of 40 of Cherry&#x27;s paintings along with a treatise written by Cherry providing step by step instruction on his painting technique at that time. The book was entitled &quot;Imagination: The Art and Technique of David A. Cherry&quot;. In 1988, that book was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Non-fiction Book of 1987.

In 1991, a science fiction short story by Cherry, &quot;The Odd Man Out&quot;, appeared in the anthology, &quot;The War Years: The Jupiter War&quot;, edited by William Fawcett and David Drake, published by ROC Books.

In 1993, Ballantine Books was preparing to publish a coffee table book entitled &quot;The Art of Michael Whelan&quot; in tribute to the art he had created for Ballantine Books over the years. He asked Cherry to interview him as his fellow artist, and the included interview is entitled &quot;Materials and Methods&quot;.

In 1995, Friedlander Publishing Group published a fifty card set of trading cards entitled &quot;David Cherry Fantasy Art Trading Cards&quot;. That same year Artist&#x27;s Market published a lead article by Cherry entitled &quot;Research Turns Fantasy Into Reality&quot; in which Cherry provided an insider&#x27;s view into the day to day effort involved in operating a successful business as a freelance illustrator. 1995 was also the year Cherry received the honor of being invited by The Fellows of the Smithsonian to appear at the Smithsonian Institution and give a presentation about his art and career. Also in 1995, Cherry was selected as one of the jury for Spectrum 2, an annual publication of Spectrum Fantastic Art.

Since 1980, Cherry had lived on Pineoak Drive in Edmond, Oklahoma and worked out of his studio there, but in December 1999 he and his family moved to McKinney, Texas, a suburb of Dallas. Once settled in, Cherry accepted an offer from William Fawcett to do the cover and all of the interior illustrations – color and monochrome – for an oversized, coffee table book for Ballantine Books which would be entitled &quot;The World of Shannara&quot;, a companion guide to the fantasy world created by Terry Brooks.

== Biography: 2000–2008 ==
Cherry was not done on &quot;The World of Shannara&quot; project when he received an offer from Tony Goodman, the owner and CEO of Ensemble Studios, a Dallas-based game company which was poised to begin production on a computer game called &quot;Age of Mythology&quot;. The position would be Senior Concept Artist, and Cherry would be responsible for the concept art for all of the minor and major gods and goddesses of the Greeks, Romans, Norse, and Egyptians. Shortly after Cherry signed with Ensemble Studios, it was acquired by Microsoft. &quot;The World of Shannara&quot;, by Terry Brooks and illustrated by David Cherry was published by Ballantine Books in 2001. That would be the last freelance illustration project of Cherry&#x27;s for a long time.

The game, &quot;Age of Mythology&quot;, by Ensemble Studios, Inc. was published in 2002 by Microsoft. During the development of the game, Cherry&#x27;s job description at Ensemble Studios had begun to morph to suit the changing artistic needs of the project, which resulted in him &quot;preparing marketing materials: ads, brochures, magazine covers, etc.&quot; In addition to numerous magazine covers, Cherry created the box cover for the game. At the annual Electronic Entertainment Expo in 2001, his box cover art was displayed seven stories tall directly over the entrance to E3. 
Eventually, Cherry taught himself how to work in 3D Studio Max and joined the Ensemble Modeling Team. After &quot;Age of Mythology&quot;, Cherry stayed with Ensemble through the production and release of its expansion pack, &quot;Age of Mythology: The Titans&quot;; &quot;Age of Empires III&quot; and its expansion pack, &quot;Age of Empires III: The Asian Dynasties&quot;; as well as the Xbox title: &quot;Halo Wars&quot;. He often had to switch between preparing marketing art and building game content in 3D.

In 2008 Microsoft decided to close Ensemble Studios, at which time Cherry approached The Guildhall at SMU. The Guildhall is a graduate school which offers a master&#x27;s degree in Interactive Technology, designed &quot;from the ground up to provide the same kind of support for the game production industry that law schools provide for the practice of law and medical schools provide for the practice of the healing arts&quot;. He began in 2009 and left on December 31, 2012. During his time there, Cherry became head of the Art department as well as the master&#x27;s degree program for the Art Track. Cherry then chaired a committee responsible for a total rewrite of the Art Track&#x27;s curriculum. 
== Biography: 2013–present ==
In 2013 Cherry moved from Dallas to Norman, OK where his daughter, Kassandra Leigh Cherry, was finishing college at The University of Oklahoma. His stated goal from this point &quot;is to do art to please myself, and possibly to show the work from time to time if I am happy with it&quot;.

<doc id="350267" wikidata="Q7674943" url="?curid=350267" title="Taff Vale Railway">
<text>The Taff Vale Railway (TVR) was a standard gauge railway in South Wales, built by the Taff Vale Railway Company to serve the iron and coal industries around Merthyr Tydfil and to connect them with docks in Cardiff. It was opened in stages in 1840 and 1841.

In the railway&#x27;s first years, the coal mining industries expanded considerably and branches were soon opened in the Rhondda valleys and the Cynon Valley. The conveyance of coal for export and for transport away from South Wales began to dominate and the docks in Cardiff and the approach railway became extremely congested. Alternatives were sought and competing railway companies were encouraged to enter the trade.

In the following decades further branch lines were built and the TVR used &quot;motor cars&quot; (steam railway passenger coaches) from 1903 to encourage local passenger travel.

From 1922 the TVR was a constituent of the new Great Western Railway (GWR) at the grouping of the railways, imposing its own character on the larger organisation. The decline in the coal and iron industries took its toll on the mainstay of the network, but passenger trains still operate on most of the main line sections.

==Before the Taff Vale Railway==
===Minerals===
Coal mining and iron smelting had been carried out on a small scale in South Wales down to the 18th century; it was encouraged by the plentiful availability of coal, at first at a shallow depth; timber (for pit props and for charcoal); and limestone (for fluxing). The coal was primarily used in iron production and it was only gradually that surplus coal began to be used for power (in industrial stationary steam engines) and for domestic use.

In time coke replaced charcoal in the smelting process. The availability of the raw materials at the heads of the South Wales valleys led to a number of ironworks being founded there between 1750 and 1800; these included the Cyfarthfa Ironworks, Plymouth Ironworks, and Dowlais Ironworks in the Merthyr Tydfil area.

A major difficulty was transport; conveying the finished product away to market was effected by coastal shipping, but the primitive road network made reaching the coast expensive and difficult; and the limestone, plentiful as it was, was located some distance north of the location of the ironworks.

In 1767, Anthony Bacon of Cyfarthfa persuaded his fellow ironmasters to join in a scheme to build a trunk roadway from Merthyr Tydfil to Cardiff. He used mule-hauled trains.

===Tramroads===
A solution to the difficulty of local transport around the area of the ironworks was the tramroad. Wooden railways had been extensively used elsewhere, but seem not to have been much used in South Wales. The local tramroads were almost all short-distance plateways (in which the rails are L-shaped plates, carrying wagons with plain wheels) and in many cases were simple extensions of plateways used underground in mines.

===Canals===
Canals were built down some of the valleys, to bring the iron down to the coast for shipping elsewhere. The Glamorganshire Canal was opened in 1794; it ran from Merthyr Tydfil to Cardiff, a distance of . Local mine owners within of the canal were authorised to build tramroads to connect to the canal. About 350 miles (560 km) of tramroad were built in South Wales under this and similar arrangements before the coming of modern railways. 200,000 tons of coal were brought down by the canal in 1839 to the dock that became Bute West Dock.

===The Penydarren engine===
In 1802 the Merthyr Tramroad was opened, connecting the Dowlais and other ironworks with the Glamorganshire Canal. Richard Trevithick was employed at Penydarren Ironworks, served by the tramroad, and he built a steam locomotive engine. In 1804 a demonstration run took place in which 10 tons of iron and 70 people were transported . This was the first use of a steam locomotive engine in the world. However many of the cast-iron tramplates were broken due to the weight of the engine.

===A railway proposed===
For the first decades of the nineteenth century, the transport situation for Merthyr and the surrounding area changed relatively little; the Glamorganshire Canal prospered, but became overwhelmed by the volume of trade. Tramways continued with horse haulage and plateway tracks. Mule trains carried iron down the turnpike road.

Edge railways, evolved directly from earlier wooden railways, had continued in use in Northumberland and elsewhere in the country; the Stockton and Darlington Railway of 1825 and the Liverpool and Manchester Railway of 1830 demonstrated the capabilities of the current technology.

==Planning and construction==

Early in 1835, Anthony Hill, owner of the Plymouth Ironworks at Merthyr, asked the engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, a personal friend, to estimate the cost of building a railway from Merthyr to Bute Docks in Cardiff. Brunel&#x27;s estimate was £190,649. However, by the following year Brunel had revised his estimate upwards, to £286,031, to accommodate improved gradients, mineral branches and shipping staithes.

In October 1835 a meeting of &#x27;the Proprietors of Iron Works, Collieries, and others interested in the Minfral and other Property of the Vallies of the Taff, Rhondda, Cynon, Bargoed, and other adjacent places, and the Trade of the Town of Merthyr Tydvil and Port of Cardiff&#x27; was held at the Castle Inn in Merthyr Tydfil, chaired by John Josiah Guest, the MP for Merthyr. The meeting resolved to form &quot;The Taff Vale Railway Company&quot; and a provisional committee was appointed, consisting of J. J. Guest, W. Thompson, T. R. Guest, Richard Hill, Anthony Hill, William Forman, Walter Coffin, E. I. Hutchins, Edward Morgan, Robert Beaumont, Thomas Powell, W. Thomas, D. W. James, David Evans, George Insole, W. Jones, Henry Charles, and David Davis.

===Act of Parliament===

The promoters agreed to go forward with a parliamentary bill in the 1836 session. The Glamorganshire Canal Company opposed the bill, but it was passed and obtained royal assent on 21 June 1836 as the (6 &amp; 7 Will. 4. c. lxxxii). The TVR Company was incorporated with capital of £300,000. The directors were Josiah Guest (who became its first chairman), Walter Coffin, Edward Lee, Thomas Guest, Thomas Guppy, Thomas Powell, Christopher James, Thomas Carlisle, Henry Rudhall, William Wait, William Watson, and Peter Maze. However, at the company&#x27;s first general meeting on 16 September 1836 the following were appointed as directors: J. J. Guest, Walter Coffin, T. R. Guest, Thomas Powell, T. Carlisle, E. H. Lee, Henry Rudhall, C. E. Bernard, Chris. James, W. K. Wait, Elijah Waring, and R. H. Webb.
The act authorised a railway from Merthyr Tydfil to Cardiff, to be known as the Taff Vale Railway, with several branches: to connect with the tramroad to Dowlais and other ironworks nearby; to collieries at Llancaiach; to the tramroad serving Dinas collieries (in the Rhondda); and to Cogan Pill. Company profits were limited to 7%; this could be augmented to 9% if the tolls for use of the line were substantially reduced. Independent carriers as well as the Company itself were potentially able to use the line. The act also limited the speed of the trains on the line to , with stiff penalties for any speeding. (These two clauses were repealed by the (3 &amp; 4 Vict. c. cx)) Locomotive operation and the carriage of passengers were permitted by the Taff Vale Railway Act 1836.

The Merthyr terminus was to be on an open space south of the town, between the River Taff and Cardiff Road. The Cardiff terminal was to be at or near the ship canal which the Marquis of Bute proposed to build. This became Bute West Dock; he had obtained powers to build it in 1830 but had held off from actually doing so.

Brunel, as the engineer for the line, designed it as a standard gauge line. He told the directors,

As regards the gauge or width of the rails, I see no reason in our case for deviating materially from the ordinary width of 4&#x27; ″. The general gradients, the inclined planes, and still more the nature and the immediate extent of the peculiar class of traffic to which the line must always be devoted, not only render high speeds unnecessary, but must almost prevent their being attempted, while the same causes operate to diminish any advantage that may be gained in reducing friction by increased diameter of carriage wheels. The curves also which the nature of the ground render unavoidable would be unfit for a wider gauge…

===Construction and opening of the first main line===
The construction of the line posed no great engineering challenges as its course followed the valley of the River Taff. The line was in length. At Quakers Yard there was a sudden steep change of ground level and Brunel used stationary winding engines; the inclined section was in length with gradients of 1 in 19 and 1 in 22. Locomotives did not ascend the incline. There was a 1 in 13 gradient on the Pwllyrhebog branch, near Tonypandy; it too was rope-worked with special locomotives. Inevitably there were some stiff gradients elsewhere. There were two stone viaducts on the route: the first, at Pontypridd, crosses the River Rhondda, and the second bridges the Taff valley between Goetre-coed and Quakers Yard.

As well as the avoiding the use of broad gauge, Brunel adopted a different form of track for the line: &quot;parallel rails&quot; weighing , fixed in chairs with compressed wooden keys. The chairs were fixed to transverse sleepers by screws inserted prior to laying, &quot;ensuring accuracy of gauge&quot;.

A ceremonial opening of the line between Cardiff and Navigation House, Abercynon, took place on 8 October 1840, when the directors and shareholders travelled on the line; the full public opening of that section was on 9 October 1840. On 20 April 1841 the line was inspected by Sir Frederick Smith for the Board of Trade, and on 21 April 1841 the main line was opened throughout to Merthyr. Passenger stations were at , , Pentyrch (later ), , Newbridge (later ), , and . There were two passenger trains each way daily, seven days a week. The line was single throughout with passing places at the stations. On double track sections and at crossing loops, right-hand running was employed for several years.

===Early branches===
A mineral branch from Pontypridd to Dinas Rhondda opened in June 1841.

The Llancaiach Branch was authorised in the original Taff Vale Railway Act 1836 (6 &amp; 7 Will. 4. c. lxxxii). It opened on 25 November 1841 for mineral traffic only, from Stormstown south of Abercynon to three adjacent collieries at Llancaiach. There was a self-acting rope-worked incline long on a 1 in 8 gradient. Use of the line was less than expected, traders finding that the charges on the canal were substantially lower.

The TVR hesitated to build the authorised branch to the tramroad to Dowlais and the clause in the act enabled the Dowlais Iron Company to take over the construction and the branch, which they did.

==First years of operation==
The line was open between Merthyr Tydfil and Cardiff, but almost immediately thought was given to improving the capacity of the main line and of serving the coal production of adjacent valleys.

===Widenings===
The line was originally single, except for the Quaker&#x27;s Yard and Llancaiach inclines, which were double. Cardiff to was doubled in 1846 and through to Navigation House (Abercynon) in 1847. The doubling was completed to Merthyr in 1862.

===Extending to Aberdare===
The original purpose of the TVR had been deeply connected with the ironworks of Merthyr. In the years immediately following the railway&#x27;s authorisation, the rich seams of high-quality coal in the Aberdare area came into prominence and began to outshine the Merthyr trade. Sixteen steam coalpits were sunk there between 1840 and 1853. Those collieries required transport to the sea and the proprietors of the TVR responded by sponsoring the Aberdare Railway, a nominally independent company.

The Aberdare Railway was incorporated on 31 July 1845 to make a branch from Navigation House to . It was worked by the TVR from the outset and leased to it from 1 January 1847. It opened for passenger and goods and mineral traffic on 6 August 1846. Navigation House station was renamed Aberdare Junction on the opening of the branch. There was a branch off the Aberdare line from Cwmbach to Abernant colliery, also opened in 1846; it crossed the River Cynon to get access.

===Left-hand running===
In 1847 the Newport, Abergavenny and Hereford Railway obtained powers to build its Taff Vale Extension westwards from Pontypool to connect the TVR at Quakers Yard. This would be the first connection with the rest of the standard-gauge railway network; the TVR reviewed its policy of right-hand running and decided to change to left-hand running in preparation for the connection.

===Taff Vale Extension Railway===
The Newport, Abergavenny and Hereford Railway reached on 11 January 1858, making a connection with the TVR there. This gave a route for minerals from the TVR network to reach much further afield, but reduced the haul length on the TVR system. The Taff Vale Extension Railway was later extended to Middle Duffryn, near Aberdare, opening in April 1864. The extension crossed the Llancaiach colliery sections of the TVR on the level and Llancaiach coal was transported via Quakers Yard on the TVER in preference to using the Llancaiach line inclined plane.

The coalfield around Aberdare was proving to have abundant resources of high-quality coal. The Taff Vale Extension line was able to take the output direct to London (via Hereford—the South Wales Main Line was still broad gauge at this time) and to the ports at Birkenhead and Southampton, where bunkering of seafaring ships was an important market.

===Rhondda===
The Rhondda valleys also began to be the source of excellent coal and that trade started to exceed that of Merthyr. The branch line from Pontypridd to the tramroad leading to the collieries called Dinas had been opened in 1841 which stimulated interest in mining in the valley.

Spurred by the threat of a possible broad-gauge line from Ely, the TVR obtained authorisation on 26 August 1846 for the Rhondda Fawr Valley Extension, in time reaching what is now , opening to there on 7 August 1856. Passenger services were not started until 7 January 1863.

In 1849 the company offered a £500 premium for proving the existence of deep-seam coal in the Treherbert area. At the same time a extension from Porth to Ynyshir was opened for mineral traffic; that stub was extended to Ferndale in 1856 and later to Maerdy, which at above sea level was the most elevated location on the TVR system.

In 1854 the Eirw Branch was opened; under long it left the Rhondda line at Trehafod to serve nearby collieries.

In 1857 the TVR board authorised the doubling of the Rhondda Fawr as far as Porth; by February 1858 eight collieries were sending their coal down the extension of the Rhondda branch.

In the subsidiary Rhondda valley, the Rhondda Fach, the line was opened from Porth to Ferndale in the summer of 1876 and to Maerdy in 1889.

===Pwllyrhebog===
The Pwllyrhebog branch (as it became known) was authorised in 1857 to reach into Cwm Clydach from Tonypandy. Its actual construction was much delayed, a contract being let in December 1861; it was opened early in 1863.

It climbed away from the Rhondda very steeply, on a 1 in 13 gradient for and then on to Blaenclydach.

At first, the Pwllyrhebog incline was worked on the balanced load system but the TVR refused to install a stationary engine even though increasing volumes of output were putting a strain on the capacity of the system.

At this stage the Pwllyrhebog branch served two collieries, Cwm Clydach and Blaenclydach, but in 1871 Thomas, Riches &amp; Co sank an important new pit further up the Clydach Valley at Clydach Vale. In November 1871 the TVR agreed to extend the Pwllyrhebog branch to the new pit; in fact the colliery company built the line and transferred it when completed to the TVR. The company also undertook to send all their traffic out via the TVR.

The new pit was at a much higher altitude even than the previous connections so a zigzag arrangement immediately above the Pwllyrhebog incline was necessary to gain further height.
The (62 &amp; 63 Vict. c. cii) 13 July 1899 formalised the ownership.

Writing in 1951, Casserley refers to a later time when a stationary engine had been installed:

The incline was worked on the counterbalance system, but there were two separate ropes for the ascending and descending trains, in contrast to the endless loop rope more commonly used in this situation.

The winding engine worked at a pressure of and the speed on the incline was about . The TVR used three 0-6-0 tank engines specially designed for the incline, acquired from Kitson and Company in 1884. They had taper boilers to ensure that the firebox crown was covered when on the gradient; Casserley speculates that they probably were the first engines anywhere with taper boilers. The TVR gave them numbers 141 to 143; after 1922 they became GWR nos. 792 to 794. and were nos. 193 to 195 in British Railways days. Under the GWR a spare engine was kept as a standby; it was a standard pannier tank, no. 7722. Casserley does not explain how the firebox crown was kept covered in the case of this locomotive.

In 1889 the line was extended privately to Clydach Colliery, making a little over in all; the private extension was acquired by the TVR in 1896.

===Blaenrhondda===
In 1867 a bill was presented for a railway from Treherbert to Hirwaun. The Rhondda Valley and Hirwain Railway was authorised by an act of Parliament of 12 August 1867. It was nominally independent. It opened a short section from immediately northwest of Treherbert to Blaenrhondda, with a short spur to Blaencwm Colliery, in June 1878 for mineral traffic only. It abandoned its ambition to cross the pass to Hirwaun and leased its line to the TVR company from 1878. On 26 August 1889 it was absorbed by the TVR.

===Widening the main line===

The (20 &amp; 21 Vict. c. cliii) gave the TVR authority for a number of improvements over the coming years. The line was doubled throughout from 1858 to 1862 and later quadrupled between Pontypridd and Cardiff to accommodate the growth in traffic. New viaducts were built alongside the existing structures at Pontypridd and Quakers Yard to carry the second track. In 1864 work started on bypassing the incline with a gentler bank (but still steep at 1 in 40). This required significant earthworks and inclement weather meant that it was not completed until August 1867. station had already closed in 1858, replaced with a new station at Quakers Yard. Pontypridd station was greatly extended during the 1860s.

==Developing the system==
===Cardiff docks and Penarth===
The Cogan Pill branch authorised in the original act was deferred, chiefly due to considerable opposition by the Marquis of Bute. Instead, the TVR company was coerced into accepting a long lease of Bute West Dock; in 1848 a branch, known as the East Branch, was opened to connect to it. The lease was expensive and not entirely convenient. The company was further put out when the rival Rhymney Railway was given access to the east side of the East Dock on considerably more favourable terms. This dock was commissioned in stages between 1855 and 1859 and the TVR was excluded from using it, except as a subtenant of the Rhymney. From 1866 the TVR was permitted access to the East Dock, but it had to run its line over the Rhymney&#x27;s line from Crockherbtown Junction, just north of the present-day Queen Street station, to reach it, paying the Rhymney for the privilege. Moreover, congestion, for shipping and for railways, in the Bute Docks was becoming an increasing problem.

These dissatisfactions led to the company sponsoring the Ely Tidal Harbour and Railway, which was authorised by Parliament on 21 July 1856. The &#x27; (19 &amp; 20 Vict. c. cxxii) enabled construction of a tidal harbour at Penarth, southwest of Cardiff, and an approach railway from on the TVR line. The route was modified by the &#x27; (20 &amp; 21 Vict. c. lxix) the following year, on 27 July 1857, and the name of the railway changed to the Penarth Harbour, Dock and Railway. The railway leading to Tidal Harbour, east of Cardiff, was just over long and opened in August 1859, but the dock was not completed until 1865.

The Penarth scheme experienced determined hostility from the Bute Docks interest and there was protracted litigation over the validity of the powers. Although the final outcome was in favour of the TVR, the House of Lords&#x27; decision bound it to charge shipping rates no lower than the Cardiff rates. A major extension was later made, opening in 1884.

The opening of the Penarth Docks proved a huge benefit to the company, not only in bringing in direct revenue, but in easing congestion on the main line as mineral trains were diverted from Radyr. Enormous volumes were moved through the docks: 2.8 million tons in 1885. The Penarth Harbour, Dock and Railway was leased to the company, although its owning company retained its independent existence until 1922.

===Llantrisant lines===

In 1857 a competitive threat emerged when the Ely Valley Railway was incorporated to build a broad-gauge line from Llantrisant, on the South Wales Railway between Cardiff and Bridgend, towards the Rhondda valley. The line opened in August 1860 as far as Tonyrefail and in 1862 it was extended to Penygraig, close to the TVR at Tonypandy. It was leased to the GWR from 1 January 1861; the GWR wanted it as a source for locomotive coal and the lease was independent of the local broad gauge railway, the South Wales Railway.

The company saw this as a threat and promoted the nominally-independent &quot;Llantrissant and Taff Vale Junction Railway&quot;, which obtained its act of incorporation, the Llantrissant and Taff Vale Junction Railway Act 1861 (24 &amp; 25 Vict. c. li) on 7 June 1861. It was to build from the TVR main line near Trefforest to make a junction with the Ely Valley Railway at Maesaraul, near Llantrisant. The line opened in December 1863 for freight traffic. A passenger service was operated from Pontypridd to from 21 January 1875.

The nominally-independent &quot;Cowbridge Railway&quot; was authorised on 29 July 1862 to build from the Great Western Railway (former South Wales Railway) station at to Cowbridge. This was another TVR dependency as it failed to generate the necessary subscriptions to build the line itself. The line opened in February 1865. The GWR line was broad-gauge and the branch to Cowbridge was accessed from the Llantrisant and Taff Vale Junction Railway. Trains from Pontypridd ran over the final section of the Ely Valley Railway and across the South Wales Main Line to the Cowbridge Railway terminus where they had to reverse to continue.

===Bypassing the Quakers Yard incline and opening Pontypridd north curve===
The incline at Quakers Yard had become increasingly busy to the point of serious congestion and in 1864 the decision was taken to bypass it. A new route with a gradient of 1 in 40 was installed nearby and was commissioned in mid-1867. The TVR had running powers over the GWR&#x27;s Taff Vale Extension line between Quakers Yard and Llancaiach. The mineral output from the mines there could now more conveniently be brought out via Quakers Yard, avoiding the incline on the Llancaiach branch, which was closed except for a short section at the north end. A north curve at Pontypridd was opened in October 1872, also facilitating the transfer of mineral output between the branches of the TVR system.

===Dare Valley===
There was intensive mining activity in the hills to the south of Aberdare and the Vale of Neath Railway had already opened a branch there. In 1866 the &quot;Dare Valley Railway&quot;, incorporated 1863, was opened from Aberdare to the Bwllfa Colliery. The line was worked by and leased to the TVR.

===Reaching Dowlais===
Iron production in South Wales peaked in 1871, after which the process was remorseless decline. An exception was at Dowlais, where the Bessemer process of steel making was instigated from 1865. This required a different quality of iron ore, not available locally, and the potential traffic flow of imported ore encouraged thoughts of improved railway connections. Several unsuccessful schemes were put forward, but a joint venture between the Rhymney Railway and the Great Western Railway (by now owner of the Taff Vale Extension line) resulted in the Taff Bargoed Joint Line. This opened on 10 January 1876 for goods and minerals from Taff Bargoed Junction, immediately west of Llancaiach station, to Dowlais. Passenger operation started on 1 February 1876.

The Taff Bargoed Joint Line had been authorised in 1867 and there were certain protections in its act for the company, including running powers over it. In 1872 the company presented a parliamentary bill to build on that, making a new railway to Llancaiach, with new connections to the Taff Vale Extension line. The intention was to run to Dowlais over the Llancaiach line and the Taff Bargoed line. The Company already had access to Dowlais over the Dowlais Railway, but this route seemed more attractive, linking in the Navigation Colliery and possible traffic from the Taff Bargoed line itself.

In fact, the terms of the running powers did not permit through running at Llancaiach and the TVR company&#x27;s intentions were frustrated when the GWR declined the facility, so the Llancaiach branch was not brought into full use.

==Later extensions to the system==
===Merthyr station===
The TVR&#x27;s original station in Merthyr Tydfil at was opened on 12 April 1841 and was a short distance south of the town. This was joined in 1853 by the of the Vale of Neath Railway. A short joint line (TVR and GWR) was built to connect the TVR line to the new station in 1877. A year later, in August 1878, the TVR transferred all of its passenger services to the High Street station and used Plymouth Street as a goods depot instead. High Street station thus became the only passenger station in Merthyr and was used by a total of six separate companies prior to the 1922 grouping. The TVR also opened stations at Merthyr Vale in 1883 and Pentrebach in 1886.

===Penarth Town===
A short branch from the Penarth Dock line into the town was opened on 20 February 1878. Known as the &quot;Penarth Extension Railway&quot;, it was a mile long, running up a gradient of 1 in 40 from Cogan Junction to .

===Treferig Valley Railway and the L&amp;TVJR line===
Seeking further expansion north of Llantrisant, the Company encouraged the formation of the &quot;Treferig Valley Railway&quot;, incorporated on 21 July 1879. This opened a branch from Treferig Junction, near Common Branch Junction on the Llantrisant and Taff Vale Junction line, to Treferig and Glyn Collieries in April 1883 for mineral trains only.

In 1865 the &quot;Ogmore Valley Railway&quot; was opened. It was a standard gauge line and there appeared to be enormous potential to bring standard gauge mineral trains to Penarth. The Company obtained authority to build a northwest to southeast diagonal line across the Llantrisant and Taff Vale Junction Railway system to handle this traffic. Financial difficulties delayed construction and in the meantime the South Wales main line of the GWR was converted to standard gauge.

Now a mainline railway was available for the Ogmore Valley traffic via Bridgend and at a stroke most of the as yet unbuilt diagonal line was of little value. However, there were severe penalties in the legislation if it were not constructed, so the TVR used delaying tactics. However, it was eventually built, the section from Common Branch Junction to Waterhall Junction between Radyr and Penarth, giving direct access to the docks, opened in 1886 for goods and mineral traffic only.

===Roath branch===
The volume of mineral traffic exported through Penarth Docks had continued to grow and the capacity of the railway and the docks was overwhelmed. On 23 April 1888 the TVR opened a branch railway to the Roath Dock, itself opened in 1887, on the east side of the Cardiff complex of docks. The line diverged from the main line at Roath Branch Junction and arched round the east of the built-up area of the city of Cardiff as it was at that time, connecting with the Cardiff Railway&#x27;s lines at the docks.

The Queen Alexandra Dock was opened in 1907 and was also served from the branch.

===Ynysybwl branch===

The Company obtained powers to build a branch to collieries in the Clydach Valley in 1872, but then lost enthusiasm for the project when anticipated colliery development in the area did not materialise.

However, Lady Windsor Colliery near Ynysybwl was sunk in 1885 and promised to be a substantial activity. The TVR decided to build a branch line to serve it. The branch ran from a north-facing junction around south of Abercynon to collieries near Llanwonno, some way west of Ynysybwl itself. It was in length and opened for goods and mineral traffic in 1886, though some informal use may have taken place in 1884. The passenger service as far as Ynysybwl started from Aberdare Junction station (known as from 1896) on 1 January 1890.

In 1900 a south curve connection to the main line was opened but the TVR was concerned about congestion at Pontypridd and held off from starting the southward passenger service. After some delay, a railmotor passenger service connecting Pontypridd and Ynysybwl was started on 17 October 1904, the northward service to Abercynon being then discontinued.

===Llancaiach===

The original Llancaiach branch, opened in 1841, had left the Merthyr main line at Stormstown Junction, just south of Abercynon, crossed the River Taff and swung east to reach its objective. After a period of dormancy, in 1878 a deviation was built to avoid the rope-worked incline, but due to a dispute over running rights with the GWR the new line was little used.

Several decades later other collieries required to be connected on the east side of the Taff, in particular Albion Colliery (productive from 1887) and Cardiff Dowlais Colliery (productive from 1889). The decision was taken to make a branch from a junction further south at Pont Shon Norton at the northern margin of Pontypridd. This was opened in 1887 as far as Cilfynydd.

In 1900 the branch was extended northward to join the earlier Llancaiach branch, at Ynysdwr Junction, opening to traffic on 1 June 1900. A passenger service operated from Pontypridd to Nelson on the TVR line a little short of the junction with the Taff Vale Extension line and did not use the GWR Llancaiach station there. A railmotor service was inaugurated on 10 August 1904.

===Cowbridge to Aberthaw===

The Cowbridge and Aberthaw Railway was authorised on 12 August 1889 to build from the end of the Cowbridge Railway to Aberthaw on the Bristol Channel coast, where there were important limestone quarries. The Cowbridge terminus was not aligned to permit the extension so a new Cowbridge passenger station was opened on the Aberthaw line, the old terminus reverting to goods status. The Aberthaw line opened on 1 October 1892. The little company was vested in the TVR company effective from 1 January 1895. Later that year, the opening of the Vale of Glamorgan Railway connecting Aberthaw directly to Penarth and Cardiff took much of the potential mineral traffic away from this line.

===Pontypridd improvements===
Relief lines were constructed at Pontypridd in the 1890s, enabling goods trains to pass the station and wait for a clear path without interfering with passenger trains. Between 1907 and 1914 the station was rebuilt as a single long island platform with numerous bays. This work included raising the level of the entire station by nearly . The new station had over of platform. Passenger numbers starting or finishing a journey there exceeded 10,000 daily by 1920.

Congestion was also serious at Stormstown and layout enhancements were installed there in 1906. The opportunity was taken to shift Berw Road Platform from the site onto the Llancaiach branch.

==Competing railways==
The TVR had been the first railway to serve the valleys of South Wales, at first chiefly to handle the iron products of Merthyr but soon to bring the coal output of the area served to the docks of Cardiff. As the coal production of the region grew so greatly it was inevitable that competing companies would enter.

===Rhymney Railway===

The Rhymney Railway was the main competitor to the TVR in bringing coal down from the valleys. For many years, until 1871, this involved Rhymney Railway coal trains running over the TVR main line from Walnut Tree to Cardiff. The line was extremely congested.

In 1867 the Rhymney Railway obtained running powers over the Taff Vale Extension line between Hengoed on the Rhymney system, through Aberdare to Hirwaun, giving it direct competitive access to the Aberdare coalfield.

===Cardiff Dock congestion and Barry===

The phenomenal increase in volume of coal shipped out of the various Cardiff docks had long been such that their capacity was overwhelmed. There were constant complaints that congestion on the railway and in the harbour resulted in unacceptable delays and costs. One outcome of the situation was the promotion and construction of docks at Barry, as well as the Barry Railway which ran direct from the Rhondda collieries to Barry. The Barry Railway was authorised in 1884 and Barry Docks opened on 18 July 1889.

The Barry Railway went on to promote a direct Cardiff, Penarth and Barry Junction Railway, which would run direct and also have a roundabout line following the coast. The TVR opposed this and promoted its own alternative lines. Parliament decided on a compromise in which the Barry Railway could build the direct line from a junction with the TVR and , while the TVR would build the coastal route from , joining the Barry Railway at Biglis Junction near Cadoxton. The TVR scheme was authorised by the Cardiff, Penarth and Cadoxton-juxta-Barry Junction Railway Act 1885 (48 &amp; 49 Vict. c. clxxv) of 6 August 1885. The line was ready and opened on 1 December 1887 but the junction connection at Biglis was not made at first. For the sake of diplomacy it had to wait until the Cogan connection of the Barry line was ready. Both lines opened on 20 December 1888. TVR passenger trains ran through to the Biglis Junction station of the Barry Railway from August 1889. (The station was renamed on 1 June 1890). The Cardiff, Penarth and Barry Junction Railway became vested in the Taff Vale Railway Company by an act of Parliament of 26 August 1889.

===Pontypridd to Newport===

The extensive and modern facilities at Newport Docks were serving the Monmouthshire valleys well enough, but there was a natural desire to handle some of the profitable business of the Glamorgan valleys too. The docks at Newport were operated by the Alexandra (Newport and South Wales) Docks and Railway, the railway part of their operation being confined to the docks area. They encouraged the formation of a nominally independent railway, the Pontypridd, Caerphilly and Newport Railway (PC&amp;NR), authorised in 1878. The line ran from a junction immediately south of the TVR station at Pontypridd to near Caerphilly, relying on running powers from there over the Rhymney Railway and the Brecon and Merthyr Railway to reach Newport. The line was opened in July 1884. Seeing this as an opportunity, the TVR company worked the mineral trains for the PC&amp;NR (until 1906).

===Rhondda and Swansea Bay===

Swansea docks also expanded its facilities and the new Prince of Wales Dock opened in 1881. During construction the owners saw that attracting coal shipments from the Rhondda valley could be beneficial. The result was the promotion of the Rhondda and Swansea Bay Railway which was to run from Treherbert at the head of the Rhondda Fawr, through a long tunnel to cross the watershed, and then down the valley of the River Afan. The construction of the tunnel took a long time and the line opened in 1890.

===Cardiff Railway===
The Bute Docks Company was created on 1 June 1887 and the Bute Docks properties were vested in the new company. In 1897 it succeeded in getting authorisation via the Cardiff Railway Act 1897 (60 &amp; 61 Vict. c. ccvii) to build a railway, which became the Cardiff Railway, from Heath on the Rhymney Railway to on the TVR, and a southward line from Heath to the docks at Roath. It took until 1911 to construct the line from Heath as far as a point close to the TVR line at Treforest, but the Company succeeded in fending off the incursion. The connection was never made and the Cardiff Railway never achieved its potential.

==Financial performance==
In the period 1870 to 1888 the dividend on the ordinary shares averaged 12.5 per cent.

==The twentieth century==
===Steam railcars===
The emphasis throughout the 19th century existence of the TVR had been on mineral traffic. When Ammon Beasley became General Manager in 1891 he sought to increase the passenger income of the company, particularly in the face of street-running passenger tramcars. In 1903 he introduced steam &quot;motor cars&quot; on the TVR. These were self-contained passenger coaches incorporating a small steam engine. The intention was to adopt a low-cost means of serving wayside communities by opening very basic stopping places (referred to as &quot;platforms&quot; rather than &quot;stations&quot;) and having a more frequent timetable.

Consideration was given to whether the &quot;platforms&quot; could be at ground level, accessed by folding steps on the vehicle, but the decision was taken to make them elevated.

The first experimental run was on the Penarth branch on 21 December 1903.

The TVR used the system in both rural and suburban situations. It was commercially successful for some time, the TVR had nineteen steam railcars at the peak and offered first and third class accommodation. The railcars had the disadvantage of inflexibility at busy times and the small traction units became worn out after a decade and a half. At that stage the TVR converted the coaches to push-and-pull control trailers, using small independent locomotives as the power unit.

As well as introducing steam railcars in 1903, the TVR obtained Parliamentary powers in that year to install electric traction equipment. However, the powers were never used.

===From 1922===

Following World War I the government decided to restructure most of the railways of Great Britain into one or other of four large companies. The process was called the &quot;Grouping&quot; and was legislated in the Railways Act 1921. The old Great Western and six of the South Wales railway companies were constituents of the new Great Western Railway. The other smaller railways in the GWR area were &quot;subsidiaries&quot;, the old GWR being the largest and the TVR the second largest. The TVR was amalgamated into the putative GWR on 1 January 1922 (effectively from 25 March 1922).

Immediately prior to the amalgamation, the trading position of the TVR compared to the old GWR was:

The Grouping meant that the competitive situation with the Rhymney Railway no longer existed and in July 1928 a new connection was installed at Cardiff Queen Street to enable the Rhymney trains to use Queen Street instead of the unsatisfactory Parade station adjacent.

The production of steel at Dowlais ceased in 1930. The inward haul of iron ore had sustained the Cilfynydd line and the GWR decided that the thinly patronised passenger service was unsustainable so it was taken off and the line closed completely above Cilfynydd from 12 September 1932.
==From 1948==
The mainline railways of Great Britain were taken into nationalised ownership at the beginning of 1948, following the Transport Act 1947. The former TVR area became part of the Western Region of British Railways. The end of World War II had brought to notice what had become inefficient working methods and British Railways immediately set about some closures.

The mineral line above Old Ynysybwl had never reached its potential and was closed completely on 22 September 1949; the passenger service was closed on 28 July 1952 and all ordinary traffic ceased in November 1959. Lady Windsor Colliery continued in business, served from the Stormstown direction, until closure of the colliery on 26 March 1988 and of the mineral trains after 20 May 1988.

The Pwllyrhebog branch was closed on 1 July 1951. The Pontypridd to Llantrisant passenger service ceased on 31 March 1952; the goods service closed in 1959. The Cowbridge line closed to passengers on 26 November 1951.

In June 1952 a new connection was made at to the colliery at Nantgarw, enabling closure of the Cardiff Railway connection beyond .

By the 1960s more passenger closures took place and the rationalisation of some over-provision of infrastructure was also implemented. The Aberdare branch was closed to passengers on 16 March 1964 and the line was singled in 1968. The Maerdy (Rhondda Fach) branch passenger service was withdrawn on 15 June 1964 and the branch was singled later that year. The Blaenrhondda branch was closed in 1966 and in June 1966 the Bute Road branch was singled. The Penarth branch was singled in February 1967 and the west-to-north curve at Pontypridd was closed on 5 August 1968.

The Roath branch was closed on 6 May 1968. In addition, the now-freight-only Cowbridge line closed completely in November 1965 (except for iron ore traffic to Llanharry) until 1975. The Penarth to Cadoxton line closed completely on 6 May 1968 together with the Roath Dock branch on the same day.

Closures in the mid-20th century left the TVR as the only railway route into Merthyr Tydfil. Plymouth Street goods station was closed in 1968. The line from Black Lion signal box () to Merthyr Tydfil was singled in February 1971. As mineral traffic declined, the quadruple track south of Pontypridd became unnecessary and it was reduced to double line in 1980.

The Albion Colliery branch, served from Pont Shon Norton, closed completely in September 1970.

The Merthyr line from Abercynon was singled in 1971 and the Treherbert line above Cwmparc was singled in 1972.

On 10 August 1973 the extremity of the branch was altered; approaching from Abercynon, the line crossed the River Cynon at Cwmbach along the alignment of the much earlier Cwmbach colliery spur and joined the former Taff Vale Extension and Vale of Neath line into Aberdare. The line from the point of divergence to Aberdare TVR station was closed.

The Eirw branch closed in 1977 when the last colliery finished operation. The Rhondda Fach branch also lost its freight service in 1987.

==The network today==
, the main routes of the TVR are currently in use with passenger operation predominant. , , and have train services to . The Cardiff Bay branch operates the majority of the former Cardiff Docks branch. The Penarth branch and the Radyr to Ninian Park line complete the surviving passenger routes. In 2020 the passenger operation is under the management of Transport for Wales.

There is a very limited freight service, consisting only of trains from Tower Colliery above Aberdare.

==Accidents==
On 19 October 1878 an empty passenger train was turning on the Pontypridd triangle. It was propelling on the wrong line from North Junction to Rhondda Cutting Junction and collided with a down Rhondda train. There were thirteen fatalities.

On 12 August 1893 the 3:50 pm train from Merthyr to Cardiff derailed at Trefforest, Llantrisant Junction. The train was conveying through coaches from Aberystwyth when a pin forming part of the suspension of the locomotive fractured and the locomotive collapsed and six passenger vehicles ran down the embankment and were smashed. Thirteen people were killed and twelve were injured.

On 23 January 1911 a passenger train ran into the rear of a coal train at Coke Ovens, near Pontypridd. The accident was due to irregularities in the block working by the signalman who forgot that he had admitted the first train into the section and had not received &quot;Train Out of Section&quot; for it. The block instruments were of the two-position type. Eleven people were killed and five were seriously injured.

In common with other railway companies of the time, operating the system was dangerous for staff. Between 1900 and 1923, the Railway Inspectorate investigated accidents to 75 employees, 12 of which were fatal.

== Locomotives ==
Prior to 1873 TVR locomotives were designed and built by outside contractors. The TVR locomotive engineers and superintendents were:
* George Bush (to September 1841)
* Edward Bage (1841 – December 1842)
* William Brunton (December 1842–?)
* Richard Gregory
* William Craig
* Alexander Colville (?–1846)
* Henry Clements (December 1846 – January 1858)
* Joseph Tomlinson (January 1858 – July 1869)
* B. S. Fisher (1869–1873)
* Tom Hurry Riches (1 October 1873 – 4 September 1911)
* John Cameron (1911–1922)

===Locomotive classes===
Two 2-2-2 locomotives were supplied by Sharp, Roberts and Co. for the opening of the first section of the TVR on 8 October 1840. As further sections were opened, and traffic increased, additional locomotives were obtained. Most were bought from various private locomotive manufacturers such as R. &amp; W. Hawthorn &amp; Co., Kitson, Thompson and Hewitson, and Stothert, Slaughter &amp; Co but some were acquired secondhand. The TVR began building locomotives in its own workshops at Cardiff (West Yard) in 1856, but was never self-sufficient – many locomotives continued to be supplied by private builders, and the last Cardiff-built locomotive entered service in 1903. Until 1863, locomotives were named, but not numbered; in that year, the existing fleet were allotted the numbers 1–50 and as these were applied, the names were removed. The earliest locomotives all had tenders, tank locomotives first appeared in 1865 and the last tender locomotives were delivered in 1889; some of these remained in service until the 1920s.

The TVR possessed over 460 locomotives at one time or another. There were 275 in service at the start of 1922, when the TVR amalgamated with the GWR and other railways. 104 of these lasted long enough to be inherited by British Railways (BR) at the start of 1948.

In addition to these, sixteen steam railmotors were introduced from 1903. The engine portions were of the 0-2-2T wheel arrangement, and numbered 1–18 - two being spare. No. 1 was the last locomotive built by the TVR. They were extinct by the end of 1921, and so none passed to the GWR or BR.

===Locomotive depots===
The principal locomotive depot on the TVR was at Cardiff Cathays, which had a sub-shed at Roath Branch Junction. Other main depots were at Abercynon, Aberdare, Coke Ovens (near Pontypridd), Cowbridge, Ferndale, Merthyr, Penarth Dock, Radyr and Treherbert (which had a sub-shed at Pwllyrhebog). The steam railmotors were based at Coke Ovens, in a shed separate from the main depot. Several of these were closed by the GWR after Grouping: Merthyr and Roath Branch Junction closed in 1923; Cowbridge in 1924; Aberdare in 1927; Abercynon and Penarth Dock in 1929; Radyr and Treherbert in 1931; Coke Ovens in 1933. In the cases of Abercynon, Radyr and Treherbert, the TVR sheds were all replaced by new GWR sheds on nearby sites, and that at Abercynon also accommodated the locomotives from Coke Ovens when that closed in 1933. Only three TVR locomotive depots survived to be inherited by British Railways: Pwllyrhebog (closed July 1951); Ferndale (closed September 1964) and Cathays (closed November 1964); and of these, only Cathays was given a BR code in 1949 - 88A.

==Lawsuit against a trade union==

In 1901 the Company successfully sued the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants, a trade union, for damages due to losses accrued during a strike by their members who were seeking to compel the company to recognise the union. The company was awarded £23,000 by decision of the court, reversing the belief that trade unions were immune to damages from the actions of their members. Following the change of government in 1906, the Trade Disputes Act 1906 was passed, giving trade unions immunity from such claims.

==Preserved locomotives, rolling stock and paraphernalia==

===Carriages and wagons===
A selection of original TVR rolling stock has survived into the present day.

TVR Coaches nos. 220, 153, 145, 52, and 31 are preserved at the Gwili Railway in west Wales in the care of the Gwili Vintage Carriage group. TVR coach no. 73 has also been restored to service on the Swindon and Cricklade Railway. Coaches nos. 277, 210, and 112 stand in a private residence. Coaches nos. 203, 48, and 51 are now owned by the National Museums &amp; Galleries of Wales.
Only one mineral wagon is known to exist today, at the Didcot Railway Centre.

One six-wheel brake van body is also known to exist, in a private residence in Wiltshire.

===Locomotives===
Two locomotives are preserved.
===Paraphernalia===

The Cynon Valley Museum, Aberdare, contains a small collection of items that belonged to the Taff Vale Railway Company. These include a railway lamp, milestone and signs for a level crossing and weak bridge.

<text>Hawksley Workman (born Ryan Corrigan, March 4, 1975) is a Canadian rock singer-songwriter who has garnered critical acclaim for his blend of cabaret pop and glam rock. Workman has released eleven full-length albums throughout his career. A multi-instrumentalist, he plays guitar, drums, bass, keyboards and sings on his records, often switching between those instruments when playing live.

Workman is a prolific artist, usually writing, recording, mastering and releasing entire albums in the span of a few weeks. He explains, &quot;A lot of artists I know they get a year and a half away from a record they&#x27;ve just made it&#x27;s like ... &#x27;Oh ... it&#x27;s terrible I hate that thing,&#x27; ya know? When I record [a] record, I never take more than a day per song... so by the time the record is mixed, finished, complete, done... I&#x27;m still in a honeymoon with the record ...&quot;

His music has been featured on the television shows &quot;Scrubs&quot;, &quot;Being Human&quot;, &quot;Falcon Beach&quot;, &quot;Queer as Folk&quot; and &quot;Whistler&quot;.

Workman produces and engineers much of his own recording, and has produced albums for other artists as well.

In addition, Workman has taken supporting roles as an actor in Michael McGowan&#x27;s films &quot;&quot; and &quot;Still Mine&quot;.

In 2013, Workman formed the band Mounties, with Ryan Dahle (Limblifter) and Steve Bays (Hot Hot Heat). Their debut album, &quot;Thrash Rock Legacy&quot;, was released on March 4, 2014, on Light Organ Records.

==Periods and albums==

===Beginnings (1998)===
Workman was born in Huntsville in the Muskoka region of Ontario, attending Almaguin Highlands Secondary School and later Huntsville High School. He later moved to Toronto to pursue his musical career and started using the stage name Hawksley Workman.

In 1998, Workman says he was, &quot;just beginning to find my voice.&quot; He recorded first in the front entrance of a friend&#x27;s studio, then moved his studio &quot;to the basement of a friend&#x27;s recently deceased grandmother on Hillsdale Avenue&quot; – this basement is where he recorded his early albums &quot;For Him and the Girls&quot; and &quot;(Last Night We Were) The Delicious Wolves&quot;, as well as material that was released several years later on &quot;Before We Were Security Guards&quot; and &quot;Puppy (A Boy&#x27;s Truly Rough)&quot;.

In that studio, Hawksley Workman engineered and produced albums for other musicians. He worked with many artists during this time, which played a role in the development of his production skills early in his career.

===&quot;For Him and the Girls&quot; (1999–2000)===

Workman released his first album in 1999 on his own label, Isadora Records and through Loose Music in Europe. This album, titled, &quot;For Him and the Girls&quot;, earned him comparisons to the likes of Tom Waits, Rheostatics and Harry Nilsson.

Workman has been known for his unusual and creative promotional materials as well as his music. Around the time of his debut release, he published a number of letters to &quot;Isadora&quot;, a fictional lover, in the classified section of Toronto&#x27;s &quot;NOW&quot;. (These letters were later published by ECW Press as the book &quot;Hawksley Burns for Isadora&quot;.)

In 2000, Workman collaborated on an album called &quot;Chrome Reflection&quot;, credited to a band named Bird which also featured fellow Canadians Jason Collett and Andrew Cash. The album also featured performances by most of Workman&#x27;s then current live band.

===&quot;(Last Night We Were) The Delicious Wolves&quot; (2001–2002)===
Workman&#x27;s second album was released in 2001 through Isadora Records/Universal Music Canada. The album, titled &quot;(Last Night We Were) The Delicious Wolves&quot;, became Workman&#x27;s breakthrough record both in Canada and Europe, spawning the singles &quot;Striptease&quot; and &quot;Jealous of Your Cigarette&quot;.

His record company press kit for &quot;The Delicious Wolves&quot; included such fanciful biographical details as sailing through the air on a kite, and learning music while working as a janitor at a tap dance academy.

At the end of 2001, he also released an EP of self-penned Christmas-themed songs, &quot;Almost a Full Moon&quot;.

In 2002, Workman was awarded the Juno Award for Best New Solo Artist and also received the award for Best Video for &quot;Jealous of Your Cigarette&quot;.

===&quot;Lover/Fighter&quot; (2003–2005)===
&quot;Lover/Fighter&quot; followed in 2003; the album included the hits &quot;We Will Still Need a Song&quot;, &quot;Smoke Baby&quot;, &quot;Anger as Beauty&quot;, &quot;Even an Ugly Man&quot; and &quot;No Reason to Cry Out Your Eyes (On the Highway Tonight)&quot;. The album was recorded in an old schoolhouse in Muskoka, which Workman converted into a recording studio.

&quot;Anger As Beauty&quot; was released in 2003 just prior to the LP release, &quot;Lover/Fighter&quot;. It includes a radio edit of the single &quot;Anger as Beauty&quot;, and &quot;Love Will Tear Us Apart&quot;, a cover of a song by Joy Division.

The same year Workman was featured, with recording artists Jully Black and Sam Roberts, in a multi-award-winning MuchMusic social-issue documentary &quot;Inside Your Threads&quot;, by Tania Natscheff and Liz Marshall. Workman and Black travelled to Bangladesh to witness the living and working conditions of garment workers making clothes for the North American market.

&quot;Live in Lille&quot;, released in 2004, is a DVD of a live performance performed in Lille, France, that showcases his live musicianship.

In 2004, Workman also released &quot;Before We Were Security Guards&quot;, an album he originally recorded in 1998. The album was originally only available at live shows, but is now available to order through his website.

Additionally, in 2005, Workman released Serena Ryder&#x27;s album &quot;Unlikely Emergency&quot; through his label Isadora Records.

===&quot;Treeful of Starling&quot; (2006)===

&quot;Treeful of Starling&quot; was released on February 28, 2006, a quiet retreat compared to the more high energy &quot;Lover/Fighter&quot;.

In late 2006, Workman released two tour albums. &quot;Puppy&quot;, which was recorded between &quot;For Him and the Girls&quot; and &quot;(Last Night We Were) The Delicious Wolves&quot; and &quot;My Little Toothless Beauties&quot;, recorded shortly after &quot;Lover/Fighter&quot; in 2004. They are only available for purchase at live shows, through the band&#x27;s website, or on the internet as MP3 albums.

===&quot;Between the Beautifuls&quot; (2008)===

&quot;Between the Beautifuls&quot; was released in early 2008, and soon followed by a single titled &quot;Piano Blink&quot; produced by Martin &quot;Doc&quot; McKinney.

In May 2008, Workman contributed a track to Cartier&#x27;s Cartier LOVE campaign, which has collected songs by many musicians from around the world. Workman&#x27;s contribution is called &quot;The Ground That We Stand On&quot;. In addition to that song, Workman also wrote and produced a duet performed by himself and Oscar winner Marion Cotillard. That song is called &quot;The Strong Ones&quot;.

===&quot;Los Manlicious&quot; (2008)===
Following on the heels of &quot;Between the Beautifuls&quot; is an initially Europe exclusive release titled &quot;Los Manlicious&quot;, which was released in May 2008, and in Canada on August 26, 2008.

The record was recorded in the same sessions as &quot;Between the Beautifuls&quot; and Workman intended to release it first, but Universal Music preferred to release the mellower album first. &quot;Los Manlicious&quot; is a return to Hawksley&#x27;s heavier rock roots, resembling his major label debut, &quot;(Last Night We Were) The Delicious Wolves&quot; more than his two previous albums, &quot;Treeful of Starling&quot; and &quot;Between the Beautifuls&quot;. As well as Workman himself (credited as HW), several producers were enlisted for this album: Martin &quot;Doc&quot; McKinney, Andre Wahl, Bob Ezrin, John Southworth, Ken Friesen, Matt DeMatteo, James Paul.

The first single from this album is &quot;When You Gonna Flower?&quot; &quot;Los Manlicious&quot;&#x27; final track, &quot;Fatty Wants to Dance&quot; has been remixed by The Paronomasiac.

While on tour in Europe supporting the record, Workman recorded videos for eight of its 13 tracks. These videos were shot on location in various cities on the tour and can be watched on YouTube or on Workman&#x27;s Facebook page.

===&quot;Milk&quot; and &quot;Meat&quot; (2010)===
Workman released two albums in 2010: &quot;Meat&quot; was released on January 19, 2010, and &quot;Milk&quot; was released in Canada on August 10, 2010 after being released digitally over the course of five months.

===&quot;Full Moon Eleven&quot; (2011)===
Workman&#x27;s Christmas record titled &quot;Full Moon Eleven&quot; was released in November 2011. &quot;Full Moon Eleven&quot; was a rerecording and re-imagining of his original Christmas album, &quot;Almost a Full Moon,&quot; which was recorded in Paris and released 10 years prior.

===&quot;Songs from the god that comes&quot; (2013)===
In 2013, Workman released &quot;Songs from the god that comes&quot;. The album is the soundtrack to a stage performance he created with 2b Theatre Company.

===&quot;Old Cheetah&quot; (2015)===
On June 2, 2015, Workman released &quot;Old Cheetah&quot;. According to his website in a post to the Front page on May 25 by Alex Hudson, &quot;The 12-song effort is theatrical and ambitious. Workman’s signature eclecticism shines brightly on songs like &#x27;1000 Miles of Atmosphere,&#x27; a nine-and-a-half-minute prog epic that’s stuffed with syncopated rhythms, star-dazzled synth twinkles and unpredictable sonic shifts.&quot;

===&quot;Median Age Wasteland&quot; (2019)===
Workman released his latest album titled Median Age Wasteland, a blend of folk and country.

==Hawksley&#x27;s band==
Workman has played live in many configurations. His minimal setup consists of a duo, with Todd Lumley (&quot;Mr. Lonely&quot;) playing piano and keyboards alongside Hawksley Workman on the guitar and vocals. During his 2008 tour in support of &quot;Between the Beautifuls&quot; Workman played with a larger band and sang while switching between drums and guitar.

Workman&#x27;s recent configuration for more traditional rock songs consists of the following:

* Hawksley Workman – vocals, guitar
* Todd Lumley (&quot;Mr. Lonely&quot;) – piano, organ, keyboards
* Derrick Brady – bass guitar
* Jesse Zubot – guitar &amp; violin
* Brad Kilpatrick – drums

==Guitar equipment==

Workman revealed his choices for guitars and equipment in an interview with Australian Guitar Magazine in January 2006.

* Squier 1952 Telecaster reissue – early 1980s model, JV series, made in Japan
* Gibson Les Paul Standard – early 1970s model, ebony finish, Bigsby vibrato tailpiece
* Gibson Les Paul Standard – early 1970s model, wine red finish, Bigsby vibrato tailpiece

Workman uses two amps on tour. The first amp is either a Fender Blues Deville, Fender Hot Rod Deville, or a Vox AC-30. Using an A/B/Y footswitch, he switches between this first amp and a Fender Pro Junior which he uses for guitar solos. He has stated that he uses no pedals with the exception of an MXR &quot;Micro Amp&quot; pedal used with the Vox AC-30.

In 2023, his touring rig consisted of Squier Jazzmaster guitars played through pedals including Ibanez Tube Screamer, Neo Clone, and amp and cabinet simulators.

<text>James Gordon Bennett Jr. (May 10, 1841May 14, 1918) was an American publisher. He was the publisher of the &quot;New York Herald&quot;, founded by his father, James Gordon Bennett Sr. (1795–1872), who emigrated from Scotland. He was generally known as Gordon Bennett to distinguish him from his father. Among his many sports-related accomplishments he organized both the first polo match and the first tennis match in the United States, and he won the first trans-oceanic yacht race. He sponsored explorers including Henry Morton Stanley&#x27;s trip to Africa to find David Livingstone, and the ill-fated USS &quot;Jeannette&quot; attempt on the North Pole.

Bennett&#x27;s controversial reputation is thought to be the inspiration behind the phrase &quot;Gordon Bennett!&quot;, used as an expression of incredulity.

==Early life==
Bennett was born on May 10, 1841, in New York City to James Gordon Bennett Sr. (1795–1872), the founder, editor and publisher of the &quot;New York Herald&quot;. He was the only son in the family. He grew up mostly in France, and attended the École polytechnique.

==Career==
In 1861, he moved to the United States, and enlisted in the Union Navy. In 1867, under his father&#x27;s tutelage, he founded &quot;The Evening Telegram&quot;, an entertainment and gossip paper that later became the &quot;New York World-Telegram&quot;. On January 1, 1867, the elder Bennett turned control of the &quot;Herald&quot; over to him. Bennett raised the paper&#x27;s profile on the world stage when he provided the financial backing for the 1869 expedition by Henry Morton Stanley into Africa to find David Livingstone in exchange for the &quot;Herald&quot; having the exclusive account of Stanley&#x27;s progress.

In 1872, he commissioned a Manhattan building design from Arthur D. Gilman, who popularized Second Empire and cast-iron facades. The building still exists, on Nassau Street. Though he sold it in 1889 and it was greatly expanded over the following five years, it continues to be known as the Bennett Building. It was built on a site previously occupied by the Herald&#x27;s offices and printing plant, and the &quot;Herald&quot; later moved back into it. In 1890, he commissioned a new Herald building at Sixth and Broadway, completed in 1895.

In 1880, Bennett established international editions of his newspaper in Paris and London; their successor is the &quot;New York Times International Edition&quot;, previously known as the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot;. In 1883, he partnered with John W. Mackay to found the Commercial Cable Company. It was a successful business and provided an additional large income to Bennett.

==Lifestyle==
Bennett, like many of his social class, indulged in the &quot;good life&quot;: yachts, opulent private railroad cars, and lavish mansions. He was the youngest Commodore ever of the New York Yacht Club. Bennett became Commodore of the N.Y.Y.C in 1870 after Henry G. Stebbins&#x27;s term, which was from 1863 to 1870.

===Yachts===
In 1861, Bennett volunteered his newly built schooner yacht, &quot;Henrietta&quot;, for the U.S. Revenue Marine Service during the Civil War. At the same time, Bennett was commissioned as a third lieutenant in the Revenue Marine Service (equivalent to an ensign in the U.S. Navy) and assigned to the U.S. Marine Revenue schooner &quot;Henrietta&quot; (the yacht he had loaned to the U.S. Government) beginning in June 1861. She patrolled Long Island until February 1862 when she was sent to Port Royal, South Carolina. On March 3, 1862, Bennett commanded the &quot;Henrietta&quot; as part of the fleet which captured Fernandina, Florida. Bennett and the &quot;Henrietta&quot; returned to civilian life in New York in May 1862.

In 1866, on a bet, he won the first trans-oceanic yacht race. The race was between three American yachts, the &quot;Vesta&quot; (owned by Pierre Lorillard IV), the &quot;Fleetwing&quot; (owned by George and Frank Osgood) and the &quot;Henrietta&quot;. Each yachtsman put up $30,000 in the winner-take-all wager. They started off in Sandy Hook, New Jersey, on 11 December 1866 amid high westerly winds and raced to The Needles, the furthest westerly point on the Isle of Wight, famous for its lighthouse. Bennett&#x27;s &quot;Henrietta&quot; won with a time of 13 days, 21 hours, 55 minutes.

In April 1867, Bennett purchased the yacht &quot;L&#x27;Hirondelle&quot; for $75,000 from Bradford. In May 1867, Bennett refitted the &quot;L&#x27;Hirondelle&quot; and changed her name to the &quot;Dauntless&quot;. She was rebuilt and rigged as a schooner. Bennett added 23 feet to her length. Her new dimensions changed to 121 feet; 25-foot beam and 299-tons.

He entertained guests aboard his steam-yacht &quot;Namouna&quot;. American expatriate artist Julius LeBlanc Stewart painted several works set on the yacht.

On May 11, 1870, the pilot boat &quot;James Gordon Bennett&quot;, No. 6, was launched from the Lawrence &amp; Foulks shipyard at Williamsburg. At the launch and naming ceremony, Katie Chapman, daughter of Captain Daniel C. Chapman, gave the boat the name &quot;James Gordon Bennett&quot;.

Bennett presented the cup and prizes at the October 14, 1873, New York Yacht Club, Cape May Challenge Cup regatta, which was a race from Owl&#x27;s Head Point around to Cape May Lighthouse in New Jersey, and back to Sandy Hook Light.

===Scandal===
Bennett often scandalized society with his flamboyant and sometimes erratic behavior. In 1877, he left New York for Europe after an incident that ended his engagement to socialite Caroline May. According to various accounts, he arrived late and drunk to a party at the May family mansion, then urinated into a fireplace (some say grand piano) in full view of his hosts.

Bennett&#x27;s controversial reputation is thought to have inspired, in Britain, the phrase &quot;Gordon Bennett!&quot; as an expression of incredulity.

===Move to Paris===
Settling in Paris, he launched the Paris edition of the &quot;New York Herald&quot;, named the &quot;Paris Herald&quot;, the forerunner of the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot;. He backed George W. De Long&#x27;s voyage to the North Pole on the USS &quot;Jeannette&quot; via the Bering Strait.

The ill-fated expedition led to the deaths from starvation of DeLong and 19 of his crew, a tragedy that increased the paper&#x27;s circulation. He was a co-founder of the Commercial Cable Company, a venture to break the Transatlantic cable monopoly held by Jay Gould. The 2014 nonfiction book &quot;In The Kingdom of Ice&quot; written by historian Hampton Sides recounts the voyage and Bennett&#x27;s role as a financier of the expedition.

===Return to the US===
Bennett returned to the United States and organized the first polo match in the United States at Dickel&#x27;s Riding Academy at 39th Street and Fifth Avenue in New York. He helped found the Westchester Polo Club in 1876, the first polo club in America. He established the &quot;Gordon Bennett Cup&quot; for international yachting and the Gordon Bennett Cup for automobile races. In 1906, he funded the Gordon Bennett Cup in ballooning (&quot;Coupe Aéronautique Gordon Bennett&quot;), which continues to this day. In 1909, Bennett offered a trophy for the fastest speed on a closed circuit for airplanes. The 1909 race in Reims, France was won by Glenn Curtiss for two circuits of a 10 km rectangular course at an average speed of 46.5 miles per hour (74.8 km/h). From 1896 to 1914, the champion of Paris, USFSA football (soccer), received a trophy offered by Gordon Bennett.

==Personal life==
Bennett did not marry until he was 73. His wife was Maud Potter, widow of George de Reuter, son of Julius Paul Reuter, founder of Reuters news agency. He died on May 14, 1918, in Beaulieu-sur-Mer, Alpes-Maritimes, France. Bennett is buried at the Cimetière de Passy in Paris.

James Stillman was an intimate friend of James O. Bloss and John William Sterling. After the death of Bennett it was learned by the administrators of his estate that he had appointed Stillman one of the administrators and trustees. Stillman had little or no opportunity to act under the authority of Bennett&#x27;s will, as he died a few weeks after Bennett&#x27;s death. Stillman named Sterling one of his executors. Sterling could hardly have begun his duties under Stillman&#x27;s will when he too died suddenly. The Bennett estate, the Stillman estate and the Sterling estate totaled about $76,000,000. After Sterling&#x27;s death it was learned that he had appointed his long time intimate companion, Bloss, one of the executors. A few weeks after Sterling&#x27;s death, Bloss died.

===Honors===
Asteroid 305 Gordonia is named after him. He also has a street named for him near Chopin Airport in Warsaw, Poland. The &quot;Avenue Gordon Bennett&quot; in Paris, where the French Open&#x27;s Stade de Roland Garros is sited is named after his father. Bennett, British Columbia, now a ghost town, as well as nearby Bennett Lake and Bennett Peak are named for him, as is Bennett Island, discovered during the &quot;Jeannette&quot; expedition.

<text>Samuel Franklin Cowdery (later known as Samuel Franklin Cody; 6 March 1867 – 7 August 1913, born Davenport, Iowa, USA) was a Wild West showman and early pioneer of manned flight. 

He is most famous for his work on the large kites known as &quot;Cody War-Kites&quot;, that were used by the British before World War I as a smaller alternative to balloons for artillery spotting. He was also the first man to fly an aeroplane built in Britain, on 17 October 1908. A flamboyant showman, he was often confused with Buffalo Bill Cody, whose surname he took when young.

==Early life==
Cody&#x27;s early life is difficult to separate from his own stories told later in life, but he was born Samuel Franklin Cowdery in 1867, in Davenport, Iowa, where he attended school until the age of 12. Not much is known about his life at this time, although he claimed that during his youth he had lived the typical life of a cowboy. He learned how to ride and train horses, shoot and use a lasso. He later claimed to have prospected for gold in an area which later became Dawson City, centre of the famous Klondike Gold Rush.

==Showman==

In 1888, at 21 years of age, Cody started touring the US with Forepaugh&#x27;s Circus, which at the time had a large Wild West show component. He married Maud Maria Lee in Norristown, Pennsylvania, and the name &quot;Samuel Franklin Cody&quot; appears on the April 1889 marriage certificate.

Cody arrived in Europe in 1890, claiming to be the son of the well-known William &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot; Cody, though in fact the two were unrelated. Cody, together with his wife, toured England with a shooting act. Maud used the stage name Lillian Cody, which she kept for the rest of her performing career. In London, they met Mrs Elizabeth Mary King (née Davis), wife of Edward John &#x27;Ted&#x27; King, a licensed victualler, and mother of four children, Edward, Leon, Vivian and Liese. Mrs King had stage ambitions for her sons. In 1891, Maud taught the boys how to shoot, but then later returned to the USA alone. Evidence suggests that by the autumn of 1891, Maud was unable to perform with her husband because of injury, morphine addiction, the onset of schizophrenia, or a combination of these ills.

After Maud Cody returned to America, Mrs King left her husband and took up with Cody. She took her younger sons with her [Leon and Vivian] but left her daughter, Liese, with husband Ted who was in the early stages of Bright&#x27;s disease. While in England, Cody and Mrs King lived together as husband and wife. She used the name Lela Marie Cody and was generally assumed to be his legal wife. Her younger sons, Leon and Vivian (King), were known as Cody. However, the marriage of Cody and Maud was never legally dissolved.

While in England, Cody, Lela and her sons Leon and Vivian toured the music halls, which were very popular at the time, giving demonstrations of his horse riding, shooting and lassoing skills. While touring Europe in the mid-1890s, Cody capitalized on the bicycle craze by staging a series of horse vs. bicycle races against famous cyclists. Cycling organizations quickly frowned on this practice, which drew accusations of fixed results. In 1898, Cody&#x27;s stage show, &quot;The Klondyke Nugget&quot;, became very successful; it included Lela&#x27;s eldest son Edward, who was known as Edward Le Roy, and her younger sons Leon and Vivian (King), who were known as Cody to save any embarrassment.

One of Lela&#x27;s great-grandsons (and the grandson of Lela&#x27;s daughter Lizzy &#x27;Liese&#x27; King with her husband Edward King) is the BBC World Affairs Editor John Simpson.

==Aeronautics==
===Kites===

It is not clear why Cody became fascinated by kite flying. Cody liked to recount a tale that he first became inspired by a Chinese cook; who, apparently, taught him to fly kites, whilst travelling along the old cattle trail. However, it is more likely that Cody&#x27;s interest in kites was kindled by his friendship with Auguste Gaudron, a balloonist Cody met while performing at Alexandra Palace. Cody showed an early interest in the creation of kites capable of flying to high altitudes and of carrying a man. Leon also became interested, and the two of them competed to make the largest kites capable of flying at ever-increasing heights. Vivian too became involved after a great deal of experimentation.

Financed by his shows, Cody significantly developed Lawrence Hargrave&#x27;s double-cell box kite to increase its lifting power, especially by adding wings on either side. He also developed a sophisticated system of flying multiple kites up a single line, which was capable of ascending to many thousands of feet or of carrying several men in a gondola. He patented his design in 1901, and it became known as the Cody kite.

Balloons were then in use for meteorological and military observation, but could only be operated in light winds. Cody realised that kites, which can only be operated in stronger winds, would allow these activities to be carried out in a wider range of weather conditions. His kites were soon adopted for meteorology, and he was made a Fellow of the Royal Meteorological Society.

In December 1901, he offered his design to the War Office as an observation &quot;War Kite&quot; for use in the Second Boer War, and made several demonstration flights of up to in various places around London. A large exhibition of the Cody kites took place at Alexandra Palace in 1903. Later, he succeeded in crossing the English Channel in a Berthon boat towed by one of his kites. His exploits came to the attention of the Admiralty, who hired him to look into the military possibilities of using kites for observation posts. He demonstrated them later in 1903, and again on 2 September 1908, when he flew them off the deck of battleship HMS &quot;Revenge&quot;. The Admiralty eventually purchased four of his War Kites.

In 1905, using a radically different design looking more like a tailless biplane, he devised and flew a manned &quot;glider-kite&quot;. The machine was launched on a tether like a kite, and the tether was then released to allow gliding flight. The design showed little similarity to his earlier kites, but had more the appearance of a tailless biplane. It was notable in being the first aircraft to use ailerons (in fact they were elevons) effectively to control roll.

Cody eventually managed to interest the British Army in his kites. In 1906, he was appointed Chief Instructor of Kiting for the Balloon School in Aldershot and soon after joined the new Army Balloon Factory down the road at Farnborough, along with his purported son Vivian. The Factory would eventually become the Royal Aircraft Establishment, and Vivian Cody would go on to a long and successful career as a technical specialist. In 1908, the War Office officially adopted Cody&#x27;s kites for the Balloon Companies he had been training. This group would in due course evolve into the Air Battalion of the Royal Engineers, No. 1 Company of which later became No. 1 Squadron, Royal Flying Corps and eventually No. 1 Squadron Royal Air Force.

Finally, in 1907, he created an unmanned &quot;power-kite&quot;. Somewhat similar to his standard kite but with bigger wings and a tailplane with twin fins in place of the rear cell, this was fitted with a 15 hp Buchet engine. It was not allowed to fly free; Cody strung a long aerial wire down the length of the Farnborough Balloon Shed and flew it indoors.

All that remained to him was to bring together the manned free-flying glider and the power-kite&#x27;s engine to create Britain&#x27;s first aeroplane.

===&quot;Nulli Secundus&quot; airship===

Before Cody could turn his newfound skills to aeroplanes, he was required to help complete an airship then under construction in the Farnborough Airship Shed. In December 1906, he was despatched to France, where he purchased a Antoinette engine. During 1907, he was given full authority as the designer of the airship&#x27;s understructure and propulsion system. 

On 5 October 1907, Britain&#x27;s first powered airship British Army Dirigible No 1 &quot;Nulli Secundus&quot;, flew from Farnborough to London in 3 hours 25 minutes, with Cody and his commanding officer Colonel J E Capper on board. After circling St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, they attempted to return to Farnborough, but headwinds forced them to land in south London at the Crystal Palace. There, the airship was damaged by the high winds.

===Aeroplanes===
Later in 1907 the Army decided to back the development of his powered aeroplane, the British Army Aeroplane No 1. After just under a year of construction, he started testing the machine in September 1908, gradually lengthening his &quot;hops&quot; until they reached on 16 October 1908.

His flight of 16 October 1908 is recognised as the first official flight of a piloted heavier-than-air machine in Great Britain. The machine was damaged at the end of the flight. After repairs and extensive modifications, Cody flew it again, early in 1909. The War Office then decided to stop development of heavier-than-air aircraft, and Cody&#x27;s contract with the Army ended in April 1909.

Cody continued to work on aircraft using his own funds. He was given his Army aeroplane, and continued to work on it at Farnborough, using Laffan&#x27;s Plain for his test flights. On 14 May 1909, he succeeded in flying for over a mile, establishing the first official British distance and endurance records. By August of that year, Cody had completed the last of his long series of modifications to the aircraft. He carried passengers for the first time on 14 August: first his old workmate Capper, and then Lela Cody.

On 29 December 1909, Cody became the first man to fly from Liverpool in an unsuccessful attempt to win the Sir William Hartley Prize for a non-stop flight between Liverpool and Manchester. He set off from Aintree Racecourse at 12.16 p.m., but 19 minutes later he was forced to land at Valencia Farm near to Eccleston Hill, St Helens, close to Prescot, because of thick fog.

Over the winter of 1909–10, Cody worked on a new and improved aircraft at his shed on Laffain&#x27;s Plain. During an early test flight while already airborne, the plane was caught by a gust of wind. Cody, who was piloting it, was not able to get it under control before it pitched forward and crashed to the ground. He was trapped under the wreckage where he was freed by his team, including his chief assistant Mr E Leroy. He sustained what were described as &quot;serious injuries to his head and shoulders&quot; but was taken home to recuperate and not hospitalised, and quickly recovered.

On 7 June 1910, Cody received Royal Aero Club certificate number 9 using the new aircraft, and later in the year won the Michelin Cup for the longest flight made in England during 1910 with a flight of 4 hours 47 minutes on 31 December. 

In 1911, his third aircraft was the only British machine to complete the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Circuit of Great Britain&quot; air race, finishing fourth, for which achievement he was awarded the Silver Medal of the R.Ae.C. in 1912. The Cody V machine, with a new 120 hp (90 kW) engine, won first prize at the 1912 British Military Aeroplane Competition Military Trials on Salisbury Plain. He had first prepared a monoplane, the Cody IV, for the trials, but it was badly damaged in a crash before the trials began.

His last aeroplane, the Cody Floatplane, could be flown with either wheels or floats.

== Death ==
On 7 August 1913, Cody was test flying his latest design, the Cody Floatplane, when it broke up at and he and his passenger, the cricketer William Evans, were killed at Ball Hill, Laffans Plain, Cove Common near Farnborough. The two men, not strapped in, were thrown out of the aircraft. The Royal Aero Club accident investigation concluded that the accident was due to &quot;inherent structural weakness&quot;, and suggested that the two might have survived the crash if they had been strapped in. Cody&#x27;s body was buried with full military honours in the Aldershot Military Cemetery; the funeral procession drew an estimated crowd of 100,000.

Adjacent to Cody&#x27;s own grave marker is a memorial to his only son, Samuel Franklin Leslie Cody, born in Basel, Switzerland 1895, who joined the Royal Flying Corps and was killed in Belgium on 23 January 1917 while serving with 41 Squadron.

==Legacy==

A commemorative statue of Cody, adjacent to the Farnborough Air Sciences Trust Museum, was unveiled by 94-year-old Captain Eric &quot;Winkle&quot; Brown in August 2013. The Cody Technology Park and the Cody Cricket Club, both at Farnborough, are named after him. His former house in Ash Vale, Surrey is marked by a blue plaque.

The Aldershot Military Museum has artefacts relating to Cody.

===The Cody Tree===
When Cody was testing his first aeroplane, he tied it to a tree in order to assess the pulling power of its propeller. The tree became known as the Cody Tree and survived for many years. Later an aluminium replica was cast by apprentices of the Royal Aircraft Establishment, and for many years continued to mark the spot. The metal tree was eventually moved to its present location.

===Replica aircraft===
A team of volunteer enthusiasts built a full-sized replica of British Army Aeroplane No 1 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the first flight. It is on permanent display at the Farnborough Air Sciences Trust Museum in Farnborough. The display is about three hundred metres from the take-off point of the historic flight.

===The Broomfield hoax===
G. A. Broomfield had been an assistant and friend to Cody after he left the Army and moved to Laffan&#x27;s Plain. In 1948, he presented to the Science Museum, Kensington, a model of the No.1 machine which was wrong in many details. He claimed that the first flight had been in May 1908. This was one month before a similar claimed first flight by A. V. Roe, and Broomfield wanted to establish primacy for Cody. Roe&#x27;s claim was later disallowed, but by then Broomfield was too deep in his story to back out.

The next year, Broomfield made the same claim to the Royal Aircraft Establishment, and caused a new plaque with the date of 16 May 1908 to be made for the Cody Tree. The story first appeared in print in 1951, and again in 1952, in articles published by independent researchers. A fuller account of the fictitious day&#x27;s flying appeared in Broomfield&#x27;s biography of Cody, &quot;Pioneer of the Air&quot;, 1953. It was endorsed by Geoffrey de Havilland who provided the foreword and C. G. Grey, editor of the journal &quot;Aeroplane&quot;, who wrote the Introduction. The hoax was not exposed until 1958, the 50th anniversary of flight in Britain, when three investigators, G. W. B. Lacey from the Science Museum, A. T. E. Bray from the R.A.E. and the independent historian Charles Gibbs-Smith, asked Broomfield for clarifications.

<text>The Iraq Survey Group (ISG) was a fact-finding mission sent by the multinational force in Iraq to find the weapons of mass destruction alleged to be possessed by Iraq that had been the main ostensible reason for the invasion in 2003. Its final report, &quot;Comprehensive Report of the Special Advisor to the Director of Central Intelligence on Iraq WMD&quot; (commonly referred to as the Duelfer Report, named after the head of the ISG Charles A. Duelfer), was submitted to Congress and the president in 2004. It consisted of a 1,400-member international team organized by the Pentagon and Central Intelligence Agency to hunt for the alleged stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction, including chemical and biological agents, and any supporting research programs and infrastructure that could be used to develop WMD. The report acknowledged that only small stockpiles of chemical WMDs were found, the numbers being inadequate to pose a militarily significant threat.

==Formation==

The ISG was made up of more than one thousand American, British and Australian citizens, with the United States providing the bulk of the personnel and resources for the operation. These people included civilian and military intelligence and WMD experts, as well as a large number of people working to provide armed security and support. David Kay, who had been a weapons inspector after the first Gulf War, was chosen to head the group. The agency tasked as the head U.S. government agency of the ISG was a joint venture of the CIA and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), a Department of Defense intelligence agency. Chosen as the senior military officer of the ISG was MG Keith Dayton, who was tasked TDY from his assignment as Deputy Director, Human Intelligence, Defense Intelligence Agency.

The Iraq Survey Group replaced the United Nations inspections teams (the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC), led by Hans Blix) and from the International Atomic Energy Agency (led by Mohamed ElBaradei), which had been mandated by the UN Security Council to search for illegal weapons before the conflict (&quot;See Iraq disarmament crisis&quot;). None had been found.

The ISG was a combined joint/multi-agency intelligence task force operating in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF). It was made up of personnel from all four services, US Government Agencies, the Australian and UK Armed Forces as well as UK and Australian Governmental Agencies. The ISG mission was to organize, direct, and apply intelligence capabilities and expertise to discover, capture, exploit and disseminate information on individuals, documents and other media, materials, facilities, networks, and operations relative to Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD), Terrorism, Former Regime Intelligence, as well as Iraqi or Third-Country Nationals associated with the Former Regime, detained by the Former Regime, or subjects of Indictment for War Crimes or Crimes against Humanity.

The ISG&#x27;s mission also included the ongoing investigation into the fate of United States Navy Captain Michael Scott Speicher, who was shot down in 1991 during the Gulf War. Initially presumed dead, he was later declared missing when evidence emerged after the war that he had survived the crash of his aircraft. On August 2, 2009, the Navy reported that Speicher&#x27;s remains were found in Iraq by United States Marines belonging to MNF-W&#x27;s Task Force Military Police. His jawbone was used to identify him after study at the Charles C. Carson Center for Mortuary Affairs at Dover Air Force Base. According to local civilians, Speicher was buried by Bedouins after his plane was shot down. The evidence proved that Speicher did not survive the crash. Senator Nelson attributed the delayed finding to the culture of the locality: &quot;These Bedouins roam around in the desert, they don&#x27;t stay in one place, and it just took this time to find the specific site.&quot;

==Organization and operations==
To make the primary mission of WMD search more manageable, ISG was operationally divided up into several sectors each with its own Sector Control Point. The three sectors were North, Baghdad and South, with Sector Control Point-Baghdad (also known as SCP-B or &quot;skip bee&quot;) being the primary and largest. The bulk of the ISG staff and SCP-B were located on Camp Slayer at the former Al Radwaniyah Presidential Site on Baghdad International Airport in western Baghdad. One of the major supporting elements of the ISG was the Combined Media Processing Center (CMPC). It consisted of four components, CMPC-Main (CMPC-M) at Camp Al Sayliyah, Qatar, CMPC-Baghdad (CMPC-B) located on Camp Slayer, as well as CMPC-North (CMPC-N), and CMPC-South (CMPC-S). The initial nucleus of the CMPC were drawn from DIA document exploitation personnel. By the summer of 2004, the CMPC had grown to over four hundred mostly civilian document and media processors and linguists/translators living and working primarily in CMPC-M at Camp Al Sayliyah, Qatar, and CMPC-B at Camp Slayer in Iraq.

Acting as an independent entity outside of the normal chain of command (ISG reported directly to Donald Rumsfeld), it surveyed and exploited hundreds of possible WMD sites across the breadth of Iraq with very few problems. There were two incidents which incurred fatalities. The first incident was a paint factory explosion of April 26, 2004, which killed two soldiers, US Army sergeants Lawrence Roukey, and Sherwood Baker, and injured several more. The mission had been previously abandoned because of security concerns. These were the ISG&#x27;s first casualties in over a year of operations. The second was a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device (IED) attack against Charles Duelfer&#x27;s convoy, which claimed the lives of two of Duelfer&#x27;s Physical Security Detail, SSG Clinton Wisdom and SPC Don Clary, both of the Kansas Army National Guard&#x27;s B Battery, 2/130th Field Artillery Battalion.

Throughout the life of ISG, there were two occasions where chemical weapons were found. The first was a single sarin mortar shell which had been reworked into a roadside IED by insurgents. The second was a handful of 122-millimeter rocket warheads filled with inert mustard gas that was recovered near Babylon. Both were thought to be remainders from the Iran–Iraq War, when Iraq was in some sense a US ally, and were useless as offensive weapons. They were later destroyed by ISG personnel. In late 2004 the ISG and the MCTs (mobile collection teams) undertook some counterinsurgency operations, although many details remain classified. There were other missions and organizations operating within the ISG which are Top Secret and are unlikely to be declassified anytime soon.

==Interim Progress Report==
After six months searching for WMD, the ISG issued an Interim Progress Report on October 3, 2003. The team said it had found evidence of &quot;WMD-related program activities&quot; but no actual chemical, biological or nuclear weapons. In addition to details of dormant WMD programs, the October 2003 report also includes discoveries of non-WMD programs banned by the UN and concealed during the International Atomic Energy Agency and UNMOVIC inspections that began in 2002. Lines of enquiry adopted by the ISG include the examination of sites across Iraq, as well as interviewing scientists, truck drivers and other workers with possible knowledge of WMD.

==David Kay resigns==
On January 23, 2004, the head of the ISG, David Kay, resigned his position, stating that he believed WMD stockpiles would not be found in Iraq. &quot;I don&#x27;t think they existed,&quot; commented Kay. &quot;What everyone was talking about is stockpiles produced after the end of the last Gulf War and I don&#x27;t think there was a large-scale production program in the nineties.&quot; In a briefing to the Senate Armed Services Committee, Kay criticized the pre-war WMD intelligence and the agencies that produced it, saying &quot;It turns out that we were all wrong, probably in my judgment, and that is most disturbing.&quot; Sometime earlier, CIA director George Tenet had asked David Kay to delay his departure: &quot;If you resign now, it will appear that we don&#x27;t know what we&#x27;re doing. That the wheels are coming off.&quot;

Kay told the SASC during his oral report the following, though: &quot;Based on the intelligence that existed, I think it was reasonable to reach the conclusion that Iraq posed an imminent threat. Now that you know reality on the ground as opposed to what you estimated before, you may reach a different conclusion-—although I must say I actually think what we learned during the inspection made Iraq a more dangerous place, potentially, than, in fact, we thought it was even before the war.&quot;

Kay&#x27;s team established that the Iraqi regime had the production capacity and know-how to produce chemical and biological weaponry if international economic sanctions were lifted, a policy change which was actively being sought by a number of United Nations member states. Kay also believed some components of the former Iraqi regime&#x27;s WMD program had been moved to Syria shortly before the 2003 invasion, though the Duelfer Report Addenda (see below) later reported there was no evidence of this.

On February 6, 2004, George W. Bush convened the Iraq Intelligence Commission, an independent inquiry into the intelligence used to justify the Iraq war and the failure to find WMD. This was shortly followed by the conclusion of a similar inquiry in the United Kingdom, the Butler Review, which was boycotted by the two main opposition parties due to disagreements on its scope and independence. In 2003, the US-sponsored search for WMD had been budgeted for $400 million, with an additional $600 million added in 2004.

Kay&#x27;s successor, named by CIA director George Tenet, was the former UN weapons inspector Charles A. Duelfer, who stated at the time that the chances of finding any WMD stockpiles in Iraq were &quot;close to nil.&quot;

==Duelfer Report==
On September 30, 2004, the ISG released the Duelfer Report, its final report on Iraq&#x27;s purported WMD programs. This report recorded the relationship of the Iraqi regime with WMD over time and in so doing investigated the decision making process, and underlying assumptions, of the regime. Key to the investigation was lengthy interviewing of all top officials including Saddam, examination of regime documents, and investigations of various sites in Iraq. Among its conclusions were:

* Saddam Hussein controlled all of the regime&#x27;s strategic decision making.
* Hussein&#x27;s primary goal from 1991 to 2003 was to have UN sanctions lifted, while maintaining the security of the regime.
* The introduction of the Oil-for-food program (OFF) in late 1996 was a key turning point for the regime.
* By 2000-2001, Hussein had managed to mitigate many of the effects of sanctions and undermine their international support.
* Iran was Iraq&#x27;s pre-eminent motivator.
* The Iraq Survey Group (ISG) judged that events in the 1980s and early 1990s shaped Saddam&#x27;s belief in the value of WMD.
* Hussein ended his nuclear program in 1991. ISG found no evidence of concerted efforts to restart the program, and Iraq&#x27;s ability to reconstitute a nuclear weapons program progressively decayed after 1991.
* Iraq destroyed its chemical weapons stockpile in 1991, and only a small number of old, abandoned chemical munitions were discovered by the ISG.
* Hussein&#x27;s regime abandoned its biological weapons program and its ambition to obtain advanced biological weapons in 1995. While it could have re-established an elementary BW program within weeks, ISG discovered no indications it was pursuing such a course.
* Hussein wanted to recreate Iraq&#x27;s WMD capability, which was essentially destroyed in 1991, after sanctions were removed and Iraq&#x27;s economy stabilized. Saddam aspired to develop a nuclear capability—in an incremental fashion, irrespective of international pressure and the resulting economic risks—but he intended to focus on ballistic missile and tactical chemical warfare (CW) capabilities.
* Hussein deceived his own army and the best intelligence agencies in the world into believing he still had WMDs because he believed none of his enemies would dare attack him if he had WMDs, notably Iran, &quot;as there was a strong need to maintain the outward appearance of possessing a WMD capability to deter Iran.&quot;
* Hussein believed the US and the coalition that threatened to go to war against him if the UN resolutions were not met was bluffing.
* The pursuit of weapons of mass destruction in the 1980s was to assure Iraqi safety from Iranian aggression, and &quot;this led to a difficult balancing act between the need to disarm to achieve sanctions relief while at the same time retaining a strategic deterrent. The regime never resolved the contradiction inherent in this approach.&quot;

==Operations Tempo 2004-2005==
Although the search for WMD had been conducted earnestly and fruitlessly during the initial year of the occupation, site exploitation continued through the summer of 2004. In late summer and early fall, the WMD search tempo slowed considerably; all of the most promising sites had been exploited in 2003-2004 and even most of the unpromising sites had been exploited by fall of 2004.

In late September and into October 2004, the number of site exploitations increased significantly, although most of these were revisits to already-exploited sites - some of which had been altered by Iraqis in the intervening months. For instance: the former Iraqi Chemical Brigade headquarters building in Baghdad was in the midst of being converted to office space when ISG personnel returned for a second visit.

ISG&#x27;s exploitation operations mostly ceased in early November 2004. By early 2005, the MCTs were disbanded and all but two former MCT members, Army Sergeants 1st Class Marshall Lowery and Robert Shano, returned to their parent units and the MP teams that supported them were dispersed to other camps and given other missions. Lowery and Shano agreed to remain in Iraq and continue running convoys for the ISG until it was deactivated. Although Lowery rotated back to the US after the ISG was deactivated, Shano extended his tour in Iraq to serve with a group of coalition advisors mentoring the Iraqi officer candidates at the Military Academy in Al-Rustimaya.

In January 2005, the group announced the conclusion of its search. The ISG stated that while it had, &quot;not found evidence that Saddam possessed WMD stocks in 2003,&quot; they acknowledged &quot;the possibility that some weapons existed in Iraq, although not of a militarily significant capability.&quot;

==March 2005 Report Addenda==
In March 2005 Duelfer added addenda to the original report, covering five topics:
* &quot;Prewar Movement of WMD Material Out of Iraq&quot;, stating &quot;ISG judged that it was unlikely that an official transfer of WMD material from Iraq to Syria took place&quot; but also acknowledging that there was evidence &quot;about movement of material out of Iraq, including the possibility that WMD was involved,&quot; and that this evidence was &quot;sufficiently credible to merit further investigation.&quot; IAG noted that, due to security concerns, it &quot;was unable to complete its investigation and is unable to rule out the possibility that WMD was evacuated to Syria before the war.&quot;
* &quot;Residual Pre-1991 CBW Stocks in Iraq&quot;, concluding &quot;any remaining chemical munitions in Iraq do not pose a militarily significant threat ... ISG has not found evidence to indicate that Iraq did not destroy its BW weapons or bulk agents&quot;.
* &quot;Residual Proliferation Risks: People&quot;, concluding &quot;former WMD program participants are most likely to seek employment in the benign civil sector, either in Iraq or elsewhere ... However, because a single individual can advance certain WMD activities, it remains an important concern&quot;.
* &quot;Residual Proliferation Risk: Equipment and Materials&quot;, concluding &quot;Iraq’s remaining chemical and biological physical infrastructure does not pose a proliferation concern&quot;.
* &quot;Iraqi Detainees&quot;, concluding &quot;the WMD investigation has gone as far as feasible. ... there is no further purpose in holding many of these detainees&quot;.

In media interviews before the addenda were published, officials went further on the important question of the possible smuggling of WMD to Syria, saying they had not seen any information indicating that WMD or significant amounts of components and equipment were transferred from Iraq to neighboring Syria or elsewhere. Other details surfaced after the Duelfer Report, which helped fill in the blanks left by the ISG investigation. Duelfer also concluded that Saddam planned to resume production of weapons of mass destruction once the United Nations lifted economic sanctions.

<doc id="350292" wikidata="Q7240898" url="?curid=350292" title="Prescription drug prices in the United States">
<text>Prescription drug list prices in the United States continually are among the highest in the world. The high cost of prescription drugs became a major topic of discussion in the 21st century, leading up to the American health care reform debate of 2009, and received renewed attention in 2015. One major reason for high prescription drug prices in the United States relative to other countries is the inability of government-granted monopolies in the American health care sector to use their bargaining power to negotiate lower prices, and the American payer ends up subsidizing the world&#x27;s R&amp;D spending on drugs.

According to a comprehensive 2021 review of the existing literature, the United States had higher prescription drug prices than all 32 comparison countries. The United States had 256% higher prescription drug prices than the comparison countries. 

==History==
Pharmaceutical drugs are the only major health care service in which the producer is able to set prices with little constraint, according to Peter Bach from the Health Outcomes Research Group, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York and Steven Pearson from the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, Boston. , prices of brand name drugs were significantly higher in the United States (US) than in Canada, India, the UK and other countries, nearly all of which have price controls, while prices for generic drugs tended to be higher in Canada.

In 2003, a Republican-majority Congress created Medicare Part D with the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act, which prevented Medicare, the country&#x27;s largest single-payer health care system, from negotiating drug prices. In effect, drug manufacturers in the US were allowed to set their own prices resulting in the unregulated pricing variation for prescription drugs. However, the government does employ drug pricing strategies for other smaller government health programs like the Veterans Health Administration, the Department of Defense, the 340B Drug Pricing Program (1992), and Medicaid.

In 2005, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) examined the change in US drug retail prices from January 2000 through December 2004 and found the average usual and customary (U&amp;C) prices for a 30-day supply of 96 drugs frequently used by people enrolled in BlueCross BlueShield Federal Employee Programs had increased 24.5%. The average U&amp;C prices for brand prescription drugs increased three times as much as the average for generic drug.

In 2007, the AARP published a series of studies showing that prescription drug prices have been rising significantly faster than general inflation. The American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, criticized the methodology as overstating drug price inflation.

In 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare or the Affordable Care Act, was created. The goal was to increase the number of people who had healthcare in the United States and reduce the impact that individual healthcare spending had on households, especially since many Americans had lost their health insurance coverage in the Great Recession. Of its many provisions, two aim to reduce the burden of prescription drugs, both relating to the Medicare Part D coverage gap. Under 2016 Medicare coverage, people paid the deductible until they reached the limit of $3,310. They then entered the coverage gap where they paid about half the total cost for the drug. Once the yearly out-of-pocket expenses reached $4,850, catastrophic coverage phase begins and the person only pays a very small amount for continued medication. In 2010, the first provision enacted immediately, was a one-year, $250 rebate to those people in the coverage gap to help pay for their medication. The second provision, enacted in January 2011, created a 50% discount on brand-name prescription drugs for seniors within the coverage gap. Subsidies were to be provided until 2020, when the coverage gap was closed as of January 1, 2020.

A December 2015 &quot;New York Times&quot; editorial opined that &quot;drug prices have been pushed to astronomical heights for no reason other than the desire of drug makers to maximize profits&quot;, pointing in particular to strategies by Turing Pharmaceuticals and Valeant Pharmaceuticals for rights to make and sell generic drugs which had administrative exclusivity and then raise the prices dramatically, which were widely condemned in- and outside the pharmaceutical industry. In response, the Department of Health and Human Services and both houses of Congress held a public meeting and hearings respectively to investigate price gouging. In April 2017, Maryland attempted to become the first state to grant the state attorney general the authority to sue drug companies for dramatically increasing drug prices. In April 2018, a divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit found that the Maryland law violated the Dormant Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.

Examples of affected medications include epinephrine auto-injectors and insulin. Between 2011 and 2016, Mylan was the only competitor on the market and raised the price of EpiPen by almost 400%, and consumers who were forced to pay the cash prices paid reported amounts of $600 or more for a two pack of EpiPen auto-injectors. Due to public outcry and demand, Mylan and Teva Pharmaceuticals later announced their releases of generics for EpiPen. However prices are still high for patients who need to pay cash price. The cash price of generic epinephrine still averages around $350 for a two pack of auto-injectors, and if a patient&#x27;s insurance does not cover generic epinephrine they may need their primary physician to submit an appeal letter to their insurance on their behalf.

A February 2019 poll found 86% of Americans in favor of allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices. A similar survey published in June 2021 found support at 81%, including 67% of Republicans and 97% of Democrats.

Twice, a Democrat-controlled House of Representatives passed a repeal of the negotiation ban, but the bill was killed in a Republican-controlled Senate: the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act of 2007, and the 2019 Elijah Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act (H.R. 3).

The Elijah Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act was reintroduced in 2021, with Democrats in control of the House, Senate, and Presidency. President Biden supports a repeal of the negotiation ban, but did not include it in his American Families Plan, leading other Democrats to push for it to be added.

In July 2020, President Donald Trump signed four executive orders designed to reduce drug costs. One order permitted certain medications be imported in from Canada and another order changed the way how discounts for prescription drugs can be negotiated for Medicare patients. The most radical order mandated Medicare to sell certain medications at the same price in foreign countries. However, this order may not go into effect as the Trump administration plans on negotiating with pharmaceutical companies. Despite the orders, health policy experts have claimed that they will have little or no impact on easing prescription drug costs for patients as they require implementation from the Department of Health and Human Services and that is very likely that lawsuits will be filed to stop the order.

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 allows the United States Department of Health and Human Services to negotiate the prices of select prescription drugs offered through Medicare Part D beginning in 2026 and Medicare Part B beginning in 2028.

In August 2024, the prices of the first ten drugs negotiated under the provisions of the act and offered through Medicare Part D were announced.

During Joe Biden&#x27;s presidency the administration signed executive orders mandating a maximum price of life-saving pharmaceutical drugs like insulin and offering subsidies on the price of drugs, these price caps were reversed by Donald Trump in 2025. The prices set by the pharmaceutical industry in the US are still partially regulated by the Inflation Reduction Act.

==Drug expenditures==
Spending on pharmaceuticals can be defined as expenditure on prescription medicines and over-the-counter products, excluding pharmaceuticals consumed in hospitals, This has been mentioned together with drug prices, but is not the same.

In 1960, spending on pharmaceuticals accounted for 11.5% of U.S. national healthcare expenses, gradually falling to a low of 5.5% in 1980, before rising back up to 10.4% in 2000 and between 2000 and 2013, it ranged between 10% and 12%.
In 2010, prescription drug expenses were 10% of the $2.6 trillion of total health care spending in the US, and its third largest portion after hospital spending and physician and clinical services.

As of 2013, US &quot;pharmaceutical spending&quot;, excluding hospital pharmaceutical spending, was $1,034 per capita in the OECD&#x27;s international comparisons. In 2006, data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey was analyzed to determine the costs of healthcare for American households. It showed that 19.1% of Americans were considered to have a financial burden due to healthcare spending as they spent more than 10% of their income on it.

In 2003, data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey showed that only 9.5% of Americans with Medicare coverage had no prescription drug expenses, while 61.6% had prescription drug expenses up to $2,083, and 28.9% of those on Medicare had expenses higher than $2,084. low income families tended to have higher prescription drug expenses during the year: 18.9% of poor households paid more than $4,724 compared to 13.2% and 12.5% who had prescription drug expenses between $2,084–$4,723 and $1–2,083, respectively.

===Specialty pharmaceuticals in the US===
Prescription drugs known as &quot;specialty&quot; drugs have become integral to the treatment of certain complex diseases including certain cancers and autoimmune diseases. Additionally, some notoriously treatment-resistant infectious diseases such as HIV and hepatitis C have now become manageable (and the latter curable) using so-called &quot;specialty pharmaceuticals&quot;. &quot;Specialty pharmaceuticals&quot; are generally classified as such by possessing one or more of the following characteristics: high cost, high complexity, or high touch (i.e. requiring special monitoring, follow-up, or administration technique or assistance). The number of specialty pharmaceuticals has increased dramatically since 1990 when only ten were available; by 2015, 300 specialty products were available with more than 700 in development (Pew 2016). The high costs of specialty pharmaceuticals, in addition to the generally high costs of prescription drugs in the United States, have generated a great deal of debate. It is becoming increasingly difficult, at both the individual and societal level, to afford to pay for such medications, as the use of specialty pharmaceuticals continues to increase along with their cost, which had, through 2015, risen faster than inflation for many consecutive years (AARP 2015). In 2015, 1-2% of the US population used specialty drugs, but these drugs represented 38% of drug expenditures for that year. A path forward must be found that provides specialty drugs to those who need them in an affordable, sustainable manner. A recent policy change by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will allow Medicare Advantage Plans to utilize formulary management tools used in commercial plans, such as step therapy requirements, in order to manage drug costs, including specialty pharmaceuticals. Chambers et al. may have identified one path to identifying the value of Specialty Pharmaceuticals using cost-effectiveness analysis:Conducting cost-effectiveness analyses may be desirable to convey the value of a medication relative to a previous standard of care. Even if a new therapy is expensive, its incremental cost-effectiveness may be within a willingness-to-pay threshold, as specialty drugs, though more expensive, often are also associated with the greatest gains in QALYs.

==Effects==

In 2006, data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey was analyzed to determine the costs of healthcare for American households. It showed that 19.1% of Americans spent more than 10% of their income on healthcare related expenses. Those Americans were considered to have a financial burden due to their healthcare spending. One example is from a study done in 2018 from the American Diabetes Association that stated that the cost of insulin devices at a pharmacy can be almost $200 less than at the listed prices by analogs. A November 2020 study by the West Health Policy Center stated that more than 1.1 million senior citizens in the U.S. Medicare program are expected to die prematurely over the next decade because they will be unable to afford their prescription medications, requiring an additional $17.7 billion to be spent annually on avoidable medical costs due to health complications. The high cost of prescription drugs has required many Americans to use cost-cutting measures and has also led to reformed healthcare legislation.

===Prescription non-compliance and health effects===
Another common way that people saved money, was to skip or reduce dosages or fail to fill a prescription entirely due to cost restrictions.

One study reported that U.S. consumers pay prescription drug prices anywhere from 4 to 10 times more than other countries, even if they are more advanced or industrialized, and that prescription drug prices have increased twice as much as the inflation rate over the last 12 years. A quarter of Americans taking prescription drugs said in June 2015, they had not filled a prescription in the past 12 months due to cost, and 18 percent reported they &quot;cut pills in half or skipped doses&quot; according to a Kaiser Family Foundation survey. A 2015 survey by the National Center for Health Statistics found that 8% of Americans did not take their medications as prescribed to save money. Similar studies, done ten years prior, found numbers very similar to the 2015 numbers from the Kasier Family Foundation survey. In 2007, it was estimated that 23.1% of Americans (51 million) had not adhered to their prescription instructions due to the cost of prescription drugs. This is compared to only 8% of Canadians who skipped doses or failed to fill a prescription in the same year because of the cost of prescription medications. The number of Americans who reported cost-related non-adherence to their prescriptions was more than double the number of Canadians. The factors that contributed to whether or not a person was more likely to not follow their prescribed medication instructions were age, the number of checkups with a physician, ongoing health problems, income, and insurance coverage. For example, adults between the ages of 18 and 35 were more likely to skip doses or fail to fill a prescription than those 75 years of age or older. Those with fewer visits to a physician and those with chronic illnesses or disabilities were also more likely to report noncompliance. The reason for those with ongoing illness or disabilities to skip doses is likely due to the increased complexity and the higher prices of the drugs needed. Income and insurance coverage were also major factors determining whether or not a patient would take their medication in the correct doses for the correct duration of time. Those who lacked insurance coverage or were in low-income brackets had very high rates of non-compliance with their medication, even though the United States has drug coverage policies for those with low incomes. Those whose healthcare spending is more than 10% of their income and causes a financial burden to the patient, are considered uninsured, whether they actually have health insurance or not.

One way to examine the potential impact of high drug prices on health outcomes is to look at the effects of having prescription drug insurance and subsequent hospitalizations. Studies have linked obtaining prescription insurance plans to fewer hospitalizations and lower healthcare costs. For example, for Medicare beneficiaries between 2002 and 2010, obtaining prescription drug insurance through Medicare Part D was associated with an 8% decrease in the number of hospital admissions, a 7% decrease in Medicare expenditures, and a 12% decrease in total resource use.

===Prescriptions from other countries===

The &quot;Washington Post&quot; wrote in 2003 that &quot;U.S. Customs estimated 10 million U.S. citizens brought in medications at land borders each year. An additional 2 million packages of pharmaceuticals arrive annually by international mail from Thailand, India, South Africa and other points&quot;. Prescription drugs also entered the country in large quantities through Canada because of the price differential of prescription drugs in the two countries. In 2004, it was estimated that Americans purchased more than $1 billion in US dollars in brand-name drugs per year from Canadian pharmacies to save money.
The United States has some of the highest prices for specialty drugs compared to other developed countries. Within the year of 2014, the cost of prescriptions had increased by at least 11.4% and 58% within the last eight years. The average cost for a month supply of brand-name drugs can run up to a couple of hundred US dollars, whereas in Canada and Great Britain the same medication could cost up to $40 US dollars. In most cases, patients pay less for more.

In some cases, U.S. insurance companies will pay consumers of high-cost drugs to personally travel to Mexico to buy the same drugs at a much lower cost there.

==Reasons for high prices==
===Variability and non-transparency===
The price of a pharmaceutical drug can depend on many factors: list price, wholesale price, average wholesale price (pharmaceuticals), rebates, supplemental rebates, markups from hospitals, markups for physicians, drug price for inpatients versus outpatients, formulary (pharmacy) tiers, mail order price, biosimilar prices, &quot;patent expirations, compounds, samples, and many other ways that end up obscuring the reality of the price paid, who pays it, and how all of it influences treatment decisions.&quot;

===Market exclusivity===
In a market without price controls, competition is key to driving the price of drug products down. However, legal protection in the form of patents results in a government-approved monopoly on the sale of certain drugs. Typically, patents allow for market exclusivity for a maximum period of 20 years after patent approval. However, given that FDA approval of a drug can take anywhere from 10 to 12 years, pharmaceutical companies can be granted a patent extension that is valid for a maximum of 14 years after FDA approval of the drug.

But even as the patent term nears expiration, pharmaceutical manufacturers employ several strategies to delay the entry of generic drugs to market. This could include by obtaining additional patents on other aspects of a drug, such as &quot;its coating, salt moiety, formulation, and method of administration&quot;. An example of this strategy is the company AstraZeneca PLC (&quot;AstraZeneca&quot;) obtaining a patent on the enantiomer of omeprazole (Prilosec), a heartburn medication. The patent was obtained without significant evidence of the enantiomer&#x27;s improved efficacy. As a result, AstraZeneca was able to sell its rebranded product esomeprazole (Nexium) at a 600% markup.

Pharmaceutical companies have also employed the &quot;pay-to-delay&quot; strategy in which they enter into reverse payment agreements with generic companies to delay the generic drug&#x27;s manufacturer. This was the case in 2008, when an agreement between AstraZeneca and Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. (&quot;Ranbaxy&quot;) was reached to delay Ranbaxy&#x27;s launch of a generic version of AstraZeneca&#x27;s patented heartburn drug Nexium until 2014.

Drug companies have also increased the pricing of the drugs during this period of market exclusivity. One study found that oral anticancer drugs introduced in 2014 were six times more expensive at launch, when adjusted for inflation, than drugs introduced in 2010. Once these new drugs are introduced during this period of market exclusivity, these manufactures use patent protection and other exclusivity programs to continue to raise the price of the drug from year to year even though there are no significant improvements to the drug. Between 2014 and 2015 alone over 260 brand name prescription drugs increased in price by an average of 15.5 percent which is 130 times the rate of general inflation. This system creates a natural monopoly for the drug companies meaning that they can drive the price up without facing any punishment from the federal government.

Generic drugs typically lower the prices of these brand name drugs as they become direct competitors; however, over 500 drugs have only one marketed generic drug. This is simply not enough competition to drive the price down. The producers of the brand-name drugs have also been known to block the would be producers of the generic drugs from getting the drug samples they would need to be able to conduct bioequivalence studies, which are key to developing new generic drugs. There has also been a drastic increase in the amount of mergers and acquisitions among manufacturers, that leads to much smaller and less competitive markets. For instance, Valeant Pharmaceuticals bought over 100 different companies between 2008 and 2015. This market practice has continued to gain in popularity over the last few decades and remains quite a large issue.

===Drug company profits===
A Kaiser Family Foundation survey from June 2015 found the public citing &quot;drug company profits&quot; as the number one reason for the high cost of prescription drugs (picked by 77%), followed by the cost of medical research (64%), the cost of marketing and advertising (54%), and the cost of lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies (49%).&quot; &quot;CBS MoneyWatch&quot; reports that in half of the 16 publicly held drugs companies in its study, profits exceeded R&amp;D cost while in all but one of the companies, &quot;corporate overhead&quot; (which includes sales, administrative, and marketing) exceeded profits.

As of 2015, several pharmaceutical companies had developed a new business strategy &quot;of dominating noncompetitive markets for older drugs and then increasing the price substantially&quot;.

In 2019 alone the price of over 3,400 drugs increased. For instance, Allergan raised prices on 51 drugs, just more than half its total medications. Some medications that Allergan manufactures saw a 9.5 percent jump in cost, while others saw a 4.9 percent increase in cost. This helped Allergan make a profit of over $15 million in 2018 alone. This trend is seen all across the healthcare industry, as the price of drugs increase so do the profits of the largest drug companies.

Researchers in &quot;JAMA&quot; found that between 2000 and 2018, 35 of the largest drug companies in the United States received a combined revenue of $11.5 trillion with a gross profit of $8.6 trillion. The key findings of this study relate to the median net income margin which is the percentage of revenue after all the companies expenses have been deducted. The median net income margin for the 35 drug companies was larger than that of the 357 non-pharmaceutical companies in the S&amp;P 500 with the 35 companies having a 13.7 percent median net income margin while the S&amp;P 500 had a 7.7 percent median net income margin. The lead author Professor Fred Ledley, who is the Director of the Center for Integration of Science and Industry at Bentley University, stated that &quot;The pharmaceutical companies&#x27; profits are really indistinguishable, statistically, from those of technology companies.&quot;

One of the following programs is the 340B pricing program that allows hospitals and pharmacists to buy drugs at 30–50% off the retail prices. Per HRSA&#x27;s 340B Drug Pricing Program, drug manufacturers are required to give certain organizations discounted drugs given these organizations fit the eligibility criteria for discounts. A big problem with 340B or similar programs is that pharmacies and hospitals can choose to bill for the discounted drugs at full price, defeating the purpose of the program to control drug prices and maintain affordability for low-income patients.

===Orphan drugs===
Drug companies can price new medicines, particularly orphan drugs, i.e. drugs that treat rare diseases, defined in the United States as those affecting fewer than 200,000 patients, at a cost that no individual person could pay, because an insurance company or the government are payors.
Congress passed the Orphan Drug Act (ODA) in 1983 to incentivize pharmaceutical companies to research rare disease states like acquired hemophilia A and glioblastomas. Prior to the ODA, the FDA approved 34 orphan drugs. After the passage of the ODA, the FDA approved upwards of 500 orphan drugs in the decade to follow; successfully achieving the goal of increasing FDA approved orphan drugs.
An orphan drug may cost as much as $400,000 annually. Monopolizing orphan drugs has proven to be a very profitable strategy for drug companies; rare diseases have few patients so heavy investment into marketing is not needed and patients rarely have other options. Furthermore, a majority of orphan drugs (93%) are covered by insurance payers. In the face of continued criticism, drug company executives defend this practice by noting that high cost allows the company to produce the drug for the very few patients who need it, and that most patients with very rare disorders rarely require any treatment at all.

Targeting orphan drugs may sometimes fail. For example, Glybera was a $1 million injection used to treat a rare metabolic deficiency, but was removed from the market due to lack of demand. However, there are many examples of orphan drug targeting proving to be a very profitable model for pharmaceutical companies. For example, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. released Soliris in 2007 with an indication for a rare blood disorder. Treatment with Soliris costs roughly $410,000 per year, and has led to $2.8 billion in total sales in 2016, even with a patient base of only 9,000 people.

===FDA backlog in generic drug application review===
The national debate over the rising cost of prescription medicines drew attention to the huge backlog of generic drug applications at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Usually, when enough generic drug products are introduced to the market, the cost to buy prescription medications decreases for both the insurer and the patient. Generic drugs have been shown to reduce healthcare costs in multiple ways, among them increasing competition which, in most cases, helps drive prices down.

Companies that want to manufacture generic drugs must show in their applications to the FDA that they guarantee quality and bioequivalence. In July 2016, the FDA generic drug application backlog comprised 4,036 generics. On the other hand, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), Europe&#x27;s equivalent to the FDA, had only 24 generics drug applications awaiting approval. This count includes biologically based biosimilars awaiting approval. The FDA&#x27;s generic count does not include biosimilars, which are more complicated medicines to review. According to the Generic Pharmaceutical Association, the median time it takes for the FDA to approve a generic is 47 months.

On July 9, 2012, Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2012 (GDUFA) was signed into law. The GDUFA was designed to build upon the 20-year-old Prescription Drug Fee Act and improve the generic drug review and approval process. According to the FDA website, the GDUFA enables the FDA to levy user fees &quot;to fund critical and measurable enhancements to the performance of FDA&#x27;s generic drugs program, bringing greater predictability and timeliness to the review of generic drug applications&quot;. The hiring of over 1,000 employees and the upgrade of the office&#x27;s information technology were among the improvements generated by these funds.

The EMA along with the European Commission, which handles approval of marketing materials, are approving generics and brand-name drugs in about a year on average, according to the EMA. In fiscal year 2014, the FDA had not approved any of about 1500 such applications by the end of 2014. The slow pace of the FDA review (6–12 months even for a priority review) has not allowed the market to correct itself in a timely manner, i.e. not allowed manufacturers to begin to produce and offer a product, when a price is too high. The following suggestions have been made: prioritize review of applications for essential drugs, i.e. move them up in the queue. If the FDA felt unable to make this largely economic evaluation about priority, the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation could do this. Second, the FDA could temporarily permit compounding. And third, the FDA could &quot;temporarily permit the importation of drug products reviewed/approved by competent regulatory authorities outside the United States&quot;.

In a January 2016 senate hearing, the director of the FDA&#x27;s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research said that increasing numbers of generic drug applications had &quot;overwhelmed the FDA staff and created unpredictability and delay for industry&quot;, but that the FDA is ahead of schedule in reducing the backlog since then.

===Research and development===
Pharmaceutical companies argue that the prices they set for a drug are necessary to fund research. High drug prices can sometimes be a necessity to finance the high-risk and high-cost nature of pharmaceutical R&amp;D.11% of drug candidates that enter clinical trials are successful and receive approval for sale. Although the cost of manufacturing is relatively low, the cost of developing a new drug is relatively high. In 2011, &quot;a single clinical trial can cost $100 million at the high end, and the combined cost of manufacturing and clinical testing for some drugs has added up to $1 billion.&quot; It has been stated that the U.S. pharmaceutical industry is able to invent drugs that would not be profitable in countries with lower prices, because of the high drug prices in the United States.

Critics of pharmaceutical companies point out that only a small portion of the drug companies&#x27; expenditures are used for research and development, with the majority of their money being spent in the areas of marketing and administration.

European pharmaceutical companies are potentially as innovative as their U.S. counterparts, despite price controls. In addition, some countries, such as the United Kingdom and Germany, encourage comparative effectiveness reviews, whereby cost–benefit analyses of rival drugs determine which perform best.

Charles L. Hooper and David R. Henderson wrote in a 2016 publication of the Cato Institute that drug company&#x27;s pricing correlates with the per capita income of foreign countries and they opined, that in some cases foreign governments drive such hard bargains to the point that they do not contribute to the cost of R&amp;D, leaving &quot;Americans to subsidize the R&amp;D costs&quot;. Jeanne Whalen wrote in the Wall Street Journal in 2015, &quot;The upshot is Americans fund much of the global drug industry&#x27;s earnings, and its efforts to find new medicines.&quot; and that the U.S. market was &quot;responsible for the majority of profits for most large pharmaceutical companies.&quot;

===Intermediaries===
Intermediaries are estimated to absorb about 41% of the revenue in pharmaceutical industry transactions.

====Pharmacy benefit managers====
Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) may increase drug prices they charge to their clients, in order to increase their profits. For example, they may classify generic drugs as brand name drugs, because their contract does not contain a definition, or only an ambiguous, or a variable definition. This allows PBM&#x27;s to classify drugs &quot;for one purpose in one way, and for another purpose in another way&quot;, and to change the classification at different points during the life of a contract. This, as of 2010 un-litigated freedom, affects &quot;drug coverage, making contract terms, and the reporting about the satisfaction of contract terms&quot;.

PBM&#x27;s can make confidential business agreements with pharmaceutical companies, which PBM&#x27;s have called collective buying power, then set a (lower) reimbursement maximum amounts to drugstores for generic drugs and set (higher) charges to insurers. This practice is also known as &quot;spread pricing&quot;. There are examples where PBMs can double drug costs.

====Drug rebates====
Drug manufacturers may offer to pay an insurance company a rebate after they have sold them a drug for full price. This is largely invisible to the consumer, because a drug company does not report how much money it returns to the payer. In 2012, the aggregate in the US has been estimated at $40 billion per year. Many people are concerned that pharmaceutical rebates increase out-of-posts and overall insurance costs. Other critics also argue that drug manufactures may use rebates to incentivize insurance companies to get preferred tiered placement on drug formularies. The actual rebate amount can be influenced by many factors such as size of insurance clientele or the amount of insurance coverage provided for that drug. As solution to high medication costs as a result of drug rebates, the Trump administration have proposed allocating a portion of the drug rebate directly to Medicare patients at the time of purchase in order to offset growing out-of-pocket costs.

==Solutions==
===Discounts and drug coupons===
With the rising cost of prescriptions, affordability becomes one of the biggest reasons people in the United States don&#x27;t take prescriptions the correct way (i.e. cutting pills in half to extend the life of the prescription or opting for an over-the-counter alternative instead). However, there are programs and strategies available to cut prescription drug costs. Programs like GoodRx and RxSaver help the consumer navigate prescription drug costs in order to obtain affordable drugs.

Patients can obtain coupons online or at their doctor&#x27;s office and use them to reduce their co-pays for a given prescription medication. For certain specialty drugs (most injectables and biologic agents), drug coupons have been found to save patients as much as $6 of every $10 they are asked to pay out-of-pocket. According to a 2017 study, for statin drugs, coupon users had higher drug utilization rates and lower rates of discontinuation than for non coupon users.

Prices vary from one pharmacy to another as listed prices determine what the insurance companies will have to pay for the drug. While this approach has been praised for lowering out-of-pocket costs and consequently reducing cost-related nonadherence, some argue that coupons simply incentivize patients to initiate expensive brand-name drugs, ultimately leading to more expensive premiums that cancel out any previous cost-saving effects of the coupons.

According to the 2017 consumer reports, it is important to compare prices of various retail pharmacies to get the best deal. Other tips include seeking 90-day prescription when possible, asking for the lowest price when deciding to pay for a medication, asking for generics (refer to &quot;Generics versus Brand-name Products&quot; for more details regarding generic drugs vs. brand-name drugs), comparing insurance plans and talking to your doctor about costs in order to find cheaper alternative(s).

===Generics versus brand-name products===
Although branded drugs represent a small minority of the total volume of drugs prescribed in the US, they are responsible for the majority of drug spending. A generic drug is a chemically equivalent, cheaper version of a brand-name drug. A generic drug form is required to have the same dose, strength and active ingredient(s) as the brand name drug; thus, they carry the same risks and benefits. To ensure compliance, the FDA Generic Drugs Program conducts stringent reviews (3,500 inspections of manufacturing plants per year). Generic medicines can only be sold after the patents of the brand name versions end. Due to this mandatory period of exclusivity for many brand-name drugs (a period in which generic medicines cannot be sold), delay of generic drugs reaching the market is expected. The high cost of upfront research that brand-name products have to go through to ensure safety and efficacy largely account for the high discrepancy in pricing between the two groups. Branded drugs may have marketing budgets that meet or exceed the cost of research and development. Generic drug manufacturers determine price based on what the name-brand equivalent is sold for. If multiple generic drug companies manufacture the same drug, price is often driven down towards production costs. If only a few generic drug manufacturers make the product, the price remains close to that of the branded drug. In some cases, price fixing occurs among the generic drug companies—instead of trying to beat competitors by lowering prices, the companies agree to maintain similar prices.

===Value-based prices===
An effort is being made to determine if the value of a drug justifies its price. Such measures include cost-minimization, cost-benefit, cost-effectiveness, and cost-utility analysis. They take into account the total costs, including hospital stays, repeated dosages, etc. and, comparing it to a similar treatment, determines whether a drug will actually minimize costs and whether it is more effective in curing the patient. These cost analyses can all be calculated from the point of view of the hospital, the healthcare system, the government, and the patient, so what is best for one party may not be best for another in terms of cost, making the value of a drug in terms of its price, sometimes a difficult thing to measure.

Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALY) is a cost-effective measure that determines the value of a drug in terms of the quality of life achieved after taking a prescription drug, rather than the number of years the medication extends a patient&#x27;s life. However, QALY is subjective to each patient and brings up moral dilemmas such as whether or not it is cost-effective to do a life-saving operation for someone who is elderly or has other complications. The subjectiveness of QALY is apparent on a case-by-case basis as it takes into account both the quality and quantity of life lived by an individual, with quality of life being the primary subjective factor. QALY does not completely reflect an individual&#x27;s personal preferences in a particular clinical situation as their value based perspective of life is completely subjective.

In oncology, the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the European Society for Medical Oncology both developed specific tools in 2015 to grade the value of new drugs. to discuss the price/value ratio of anti-cancer drugs between physicians and patients and on a societal level. A 2017 review of anti-cancer drugs approved by the FDA between 2000 and 2015 found no relationship between their price and their value as measured by the scales of the ASCO and the ESMO.

===Policy makers===
The FDA has a &quot;priority review process&quot; for drugs which compete with another drug whose price exceeds its value-based price. Congress could also grant the FDA the ability to change the exclusivity period for new drugs. The FDA could also temporarily allow the import of drugs approved for sale outside the United States.

In December 2015, the DHHS held a public meeting and both houses of Congress had hearings on off-patent drugs with limited or no competition.

In 2017, Democratic party leaders announced a plan to enforce limits on how much pharmaceutical companies could raise drug prices. Under the plan, drugs with a &quot;significant price increase&quot; would have to explain the price rise to the HHS a minimum of 30 days before implementing the price hike. Although Turing Pharmaceuticals&#x27; Daraprim price rise of 5000% overnight would meet the proposal&#x27;s definition of a &quot;significant price increase,&quot; under the proposed plan, Mylan&#x27;s well-publicized price increase for EpiPen would fall below the thresholds in the plan&#x27;s criteria for enforcement.

===New legislation===
On October 9, 2017, Governor Jerry Brown of California passed Senate Bill 17 (SB-17) Health care: prescription drug costs. This bill focuses on transparency regarding pharmaceutical companies. This bill mainly focuses on two aspects. The first being that drug companies must give prior notice of price increases for prescription drugs. Drug Manufacturers must notify state purchasers such as CalPERS, Medi-Cal etc. 90 days prior to the planned effective date. The second focus is on the transparency of spending trends. This means that health plans and insurers have to annually report the following for all covered drugs (categorized by generic drugs, brand names, and specialty drugs):
* the 25 most prescribed drugs
* the 25 most costly drugs 
* the 25 drugs with the highest year-over-year increase in total annual spending.
This information was intended to help the public and policy makers see and understand pharmaceutical spending trends.

===Canada&#x27;s model===
In Canada, the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board (PMPRB) determines a maximum price for all drugs. In 1987, Bill C-22 established an extended period of protection for patents prior to licensing, which would allow for generics to enter the market. It also created the PMPRB, an independent semi-judicial body, which had the purpose of establishing review guidelines of individual drug prices, conduct investigations for allegations of excessive pricing, and negotiations to a voluntary compliance agreement. These efforts are to ensure that manufacturer prices are within justification, and not excessive. Excessive is interpreted based on the following criteria:
# The price of an existing patented drug cannot increase by more than the Consumer Price Index (CPI)
# The price of a new drug (in most cases) is limited so that the cost of therapy with the new drug is in the range of the costs of therapy with existing drugs in the same therapeutic class.
# The price of a breakthrough drug is limited to the median of its prices in France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, Britain, and the United States. In addition, no patented drug can be priced above the highest price in this group of countries.
Low levels of drug spending in Canada are not solely attributable to the regulatory activities of the government, but also the actions of provincial and private insurance plans. These plans prevents price inflation through formulary management, independent clinical review of new products, reference-based pricing, the LCA, and limited use program.
In reviewing formularies, the drug program reviews the therapeutic advantage of one product over the existing formulary, and only adds new drugs if program costs are unchanged. The reference-based pricing entails having a &quot;reference product&quot; for each category that is the baseline price, and utilizes an independent panel of pharmacists and doctors the University of British Columbia to evaluate the therapeutic discrepancies between drugs. The LCA, or low-cost alternative program establishes the price of generics for payment regardless if brand or genetics are used. The limited use program requires prior authorization for specific drugs, and restricts reimbursements to the approved rationale of prior authorizations (i.e. patients who have failed previous agents for the same indication).

The government is purchasing drugs similar to how the United States purchases medications for military personnel, but on a much wider scale.

Gail Wilensky, former director of Medicare and Medicaid, said that because most other countries&#x27; governments set prices and the U.S. does not, the United States is effectively subsidizing drug development for other countries. She believes if the United States started setting prices, it would disproportionately impact new drug development. She predicted that the tradeoff if prices were set too low, would be fewer new treatments coming to market in about a decade (due to the long development lifecycle). David Mitchell of the advocacy group Patients for Affordable Drugs argues that in the face of reduced pharmaceutical company profits, government-funded research could provide an ongoing pipeline of new treatments.

===Healthcare providers===
Healthcare providers can help lower drug prices by helping patients navigate the medication formulary, prescribing drugs covered by formularies, and participating in formulary development through Pharmacy and Therapeutics committees. The formulary system&#x27;s effectiveness is directly correlated to the education of physicians, pharmacists and patients in understanding the justification of formulary compositions. This education includes drug information monographs to provide adequate resources to physicians in making clinical prescribing decisions, pharmacy education regarding any changes in the formulary, and patient education within the managed care system.

Formularies should be easily accessible for patient access as well, such as the online Medicare Planfinder, which is part of the Medicare Part D Plan.

Healthcare providers can substitute three-month for one-month supplies of medicines. A three-month supply represented a 29% decrease in out-of-pocket costs and an 18% decrease in total prescription costs in one study.

Prescribing combination drugs instead of two separate medications can also potentially reduce monthly copays.

Because the FDA has no regulations on drug companies in providing evidence that a new drug has a therapeutic advantage over an older drug, many physicians have a tendency to write prescriptions for drugs they are most familiar with. Oftentimes, these prescribing practices are influenced by manufacturer marketing to private practices or hospitals. Prescriber monitoring programs should be implemented to help physicians make cost-effective, evidence-based prescribing decisions, and foundation protocols should be established. This is important to ensure that the most clinically effective drugs are selected, and if a more expensive drug is selected, that appropriate therapeutic equivalence is evaluated with research supporting this decision. However, some organizations believe that if the federal government modified reimportation laws, the FDA could conduct a comprehensive assessment on manufacturing standards in other countries, and allow importation of drugs that meet or exceed U.S. safety standards for drug manufacturing.

Individual importation of lower cost prescription drugs from foreign countries – as done by 2% of U.S. consumers in 2011 and 2012 – is likely not an effective public health solution. However, if the federal government modified reimportation laws, the FDA could conduct a comprehensive assessment on manufacturing standards in other countries, and allow importation of drugs that meet or exceed U.S. safety standards for drug manufacturing.

===Medicare for All===

H.R.3, Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act, is a 2019 House of Representatives approved bill that would allow the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HSS) to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies for some of the most expensive drugs covered by Medicare Part D. This negotiation would manifest as a price ceiling, ensuring the Medicare Part D would pay no more than the negotiated price for the expensive drugs. This proposal received support from President Biden during his campaign. Bernie Sanders&#x27; 2019 Medicare for All proposal expands upon this bill proposal by requiring a universal health care system instead of private insurance. With this universal health care system, the negotiation style from H.R.3 would apply to everyone under Medicare for All, rather than just the current recipients of Medicare.

Price controls on the pharmaceutical industry have some empirical evidence to support the policy. The United States&#x27; International Trade Administration reports the OECD companies with price controls drug prices range from 18 to 67 percent lower than the US&#x27;s, depending on the drug.

There are several reasons why some experts believe that price controls on the pharmaceutical industry have some serious downsides. The National Bureau of Economic Research conducted a study in 2014 that found that price regulations significantly delayed the launch of new drugs. Moreover, a study done by Dr. David Stewart found that 260 life-years are lost per hour of delay for drug approval. Sanders&#x27; proposal may mitigate delays with the inclusion of an inability to negotiate section, which states if the negotiation is unable to conclude, the HSS may price the drug at no more than the amount of one of three different prices. These prices include the price the Secretary of Veterans Affairs pays, the price of the drug under section 8126 of title 38, United States Code, and the price paid under a section of Social Security.

<doc id="350293" wikidata="Q247264" url="?curid=350293" title="Jack Horner (paleontologist)">
<text>John Robert Horner (born June 15, 1946) is an American paleontologist most famous for describing &quot;Maiasaura&quot;, providing the first clear evidence that some dinosaurs cared for their young. In addition to his paleontological discoveries, Horner served as the technical advisor for the first five &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; films, had a cameo appearance in &quot;Jurassic World&quot;, and served as a partial inspiration for one of the lead characters of the franchise, Dr. Alan Grant. Horner studied at the University of Montana, although he did not complete his degree due to undiagnosed dyslexia, and was awarded a Doctorate in Science &quot;honoris causa&quot;. He retired from Montana State University on July 1, 2016, although he claims to have been pushed out of the Museum of the Rockies after having married an undergraduate student and now teaches as a Presidential Fellow at Chapman University.

==Biography ==

Horner was born and raised near Shelby, Montana. He was 8 years old when he found his first dinosaur bone. He attended the University of Montana for seven years, majoring in geology and zoology. He also spent two years in the U.S. Marine Corps, serving in Vietnam during the Vietnam War in a reconnaissance unit. Horner did not complete his bachelor&#x27;s degree due to severe dyslexia. However, he did complete a senior thesis on the fauna of the Bear Gulch Limestone, one of the most famous Mississippian lagerstätten (exceptionally preserved fossil sites) in the world, located in Montana. The University of Montana awarded him an Honorary Doctorate of Science in 1986. Also in 1986, he was awarded the prestigious MacArthur Fellowship. In 1993, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

In Montana during the mid-1970s, Horner and his research partner Bob Makela discovered a colonial nesting site of a new dinosaur genus which they named &quot;Maiasaura&quot;, or &quot;Good Mother Lizard&quot;. The dinosaur bones, originating from a juvenile, were first discovered by Marion Brandvold. Horner then studied the bones, and at first, there was a refusal to return the bones to Brandvold. It contained the first dinosaur eggs in the Western hemisphere, the first dinosaur embryos, and settled questions of whether some dinosaurs were sociable, built nests and cared for their young. The discovery established Horner&#x27;s career. He has named several other species of dinosaur (including &quot;Orodromeus makelai,&quot; in memory of his late friend Bob Makela) and has had three named after himself: &quot;Achelousaurus horneri&quot;, &quot;Anasazisaurus horneri&quot;, and &quot;Daspletosaurus horneri&quot;.

Within the paleontological community, Horner is best known for his work on dinosaur growth research. He has published numerous articles in collaboration with Berkeley paleontologist Kevin Padian, and French dinosaur histologist Armand de Ricqlès, on the growth of dinosaurs using growth series. This usually involves leg bones in graduated sizes from different individuals ranging in age from embryos to adults. Horner also revitalized the contested theory that &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; was an obligate scavenger, rather than a predatory killer. While this theory has been widely discussed by the popular press, it has never been a major research focus for Horner. He claimed that he never published the scavenger hypothesis in the peer-reviewed scientific literature, stating that it was mainly a tool for him to teach a popular audience, particularly children, of the dangers of making assumptions in science (such as assuming &quot;T. rex&quot; was a hunter) without using evidence. In 2000, teams led by Horner discovered five specimens of &quot;T. rex&quot; and three more the following summer, including one larger than the specimen nicknamed &quot;Sue&quot;. The new fossil was 10% larger than other specimens and estimated to weigh 10–13 tons in life. The Museum of the Rockies, as the result of continuing fieldwork, now exhibits the largest &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; collection in the world. Currently, Horner is working on the developmental biology of dinosaurs.

Horner has published over 100 professional papers, eight books including &quot;Dinosaurs Under the Big Sky&quot;; a children&#x27;s book, &quot;Maia: A Dinosaur Grows Up&quot;; a non-fiction book on dinosaurs from Montana, &quot;Dinosaur Lives&quot;; and numerous articles. He was also a part of a 2005 discovery of soft tissue in a &quot;T. rex&quot; fossil. Horner was the Curator of Paleontology at the Museum of the Rockies, the Regent&#x27;s Professor of Paleontology, adjunct curator at the National Museum of Natural History, and taught at the Montana State University in Bozeman, Montana. Over the years he has advised people who have gone on to be leading experts in paleontology, such as Mary Higby Schweitzer, Greg Erickson, Kristi Curry-Rogers, and David J. Varricchio. Horner was awarded an honorary doctorate by Pennsylvania State University in 2006 in recognition of his work.

In 2003, Horner discovered a fossilized tyrannosaur leg bone from which paleontologist Mary Higby Schweitzer was able to retrieve proteins in 2007.

In 2009, the National Geographic released a documentary entitled &quot;Dinosaurs Decoded&quot;, which reviews Horner&#x27;s research into juvenile dinosaurs. He suggests that juvenile dinosaurs looked sufficiently different from adults, and that they have sometimes been mistaken for separate species. The program examines specific changes that occurred as dinosaurs aged and speculates on why the changes were necessary. Horner&#x27;s research on the topic has gone as far as eliminating several &quot;sub-species&quot; of &quot;Triceratops&quot;, &quot;Pachycephalosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;. Horner also believes that if his research were to continue as much as a third of known dinosaurs would be classified under an existing species.

In Las Vegas on January 15, 2012, 65-year-old Horner married Vanessa Weaver, a 19-year-old Montana State University undergraduate paleontology student and volunteer in his lab. The couple had divorced by August 2016, but remained good friends.

On November 2, 2013, Horner was awarded the Romer–Simpson Prize, the highest honor a paleontologist can receive from the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology.

On his retirement from Montana State University on July 1, 2016, the MacMillan Foundation honored Horner for his work with a $3 million endowment for the John R. Horner Curator of Paleontology Chair for the Museum of the Rockies/ Montana State University - funding the work of his Paleontology successors in perpetuity.

In popular culture, Horner is the subject of the children&#x27;s book, &quot;Jack Horner, Dinosaur Hunter!&quot; written by Sophia Gholz, illustrated by Dave Shephard, and published by Sleeping Bear Press. The book, which has been translated into French, chronicles the life of Horner, from a child in Montana to an adult on the set of &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, and discusses Horner&#x27;s scientific contributions as well as navigating life with a reading disability.

==Build a Dinosaur Project==

Horner&#x27;s 2009 book, &quot;How to Build a Dinosaur: Extinction Doesn&#x27;t Have to Be Forever&quot;, describes his plan to recreate a dinosaur by genetically &quot;nudging&quot; the DNA of a chicken. Horner&#x27;s idea for the project came from an early script for the film &quot;Jurassic World&quot;.
He had been planning the book as early as June 2005; it was originally planned to be released simultaneously with &quot;Jurassic World&quot; as a scientific companion volume.

In 2011, Horner pursued the project to develop the animal, which he describes as a &quot;chickenosaurus&quot;, with a team of geneticists. By November 2014, Horner and his team had conducted some of the earliest research into the embryonic development of tails. Such research may ultimately lead to new treatments for people with spinal disorders. Research into the mesenchyme tissue of chicken embryos, which direct the growth of teeth, may also aid in the treatment of human sarcomas. George Lucas had funded most of the project&#x27;s costs up to that point, while an additional $5 million was needed. Horner expected to have a living dinosaur within 10 years.

In 2015, an independent group of scientists reported that they had found a way to turn the beaks of chicken embryos back into dinosaur-like snouts, by reverse genetic engineering, and University of Chile geneticists have produced embryos with dinosaur-like leg and foot anatomy including the fibula full-length and reaching the ankle.

<text>The Game Boy Printer, known as the in Japan, is a thermal printer accessory released by Nintendo in 1998 which ceased production in early 2003. The Game Boy Printer is compatible with all the Game Boy systems except the Game Boy Micro and is designed to be used in conjunction with the Game Boy Camera. It also prints images from compatible late-generation Game Boy and Game Boy Color games (listed below). It runs on six AA batteries and uses a proprietary 38mm wide thermal paper with adhesive backing, originally sold in white, red, yellow and blue colors. In Japan, a bright yellow Pokémon version of the Game Boy Printer was released, featuring a feed button in the style of a Poké Ball.

==Game Boy Printer Thermal Paper ==
Released alongside the Game Boy Printer in 1998, Nintendo-manufactured thermal paper refill rolls were produced in white, cream, blue, yellow, and red variants, all of which had an integrated adhesive backing. 

After powering the printer on, a clip at the rear of the protruding translucent grey refill housing is depressed, allowing this to be lifted away. The thermal paper roll inserted upside-down and unravelled end facing down, with this end being fed into a thin slot. The maroon &#x27;FEED&#x27; button is then pressed down, which engages the uptake motor, and pulls the paper through to the exit slot which has an integrated serrated edge, which allows finished prints to be ripped away from the roll. Forcibly pulling the paper opposite to the feed direction causes permanent damage to the gearing within the feed mechanism.

When a picture was printed from the Game Boy Camera, it would print with a margin above and below the picture and print the picture at a height. This would give the total of height per picture. Although on-box advertisements boasted up to 180 pictures per roll, in actuality a typical roll could only print between 118 and 121 pictures.

Sold on the official Nintendo e-Shop (as triple packs of blue, cream and white rolls) until 2007, Game Boy branded official replacement thermal paper is now difficult to source. Even brand-new, sealed, un-opened official rolls degrade relatively quickly once opened (if they were stored correctly and their seal has not failed). Most, however, have suffered degradation whilst in storage due to a chemical reaction between the thermal paper and adhesive backing layer. Due to the proprietary nature of the adhesive-backing, replacement thermal paper that is able to be adhered to surfaces once printed upon (including brands such as &#x27;MAXStick&#x27;) is prohibitively expensive.

Instead, the thermal paper rolls can be successfully substituted with a 38mm x 4m alternative, with or without (&#x27;core-less&#x27;) spindle cores, without repercussions on the printer. Such rolls are also compatible with some hand-held printing calculators, such as the Canon TP-8, Texas Instruments 5000–2008, Sharp 8180, and Casio FX-802. Alternatively, wider rolls (such as 57mm x 30mm x 12.7mm) can be cut or trimmed to 38mm, and function without issue.

Please note, however, that due to the inherent limitations of thermal paper, photographs printed on thermal paper will fade over time (this depends heavily on the thermal paper variant used, and could be as short as a few months, or instead a few years) until the paper is virtually blank. Paper in this state can usually be re-used, as long as the length of the strip is long enough to be manually fed into the takeup.

It is unknown whether original Game Boy Printer paper contains the chemicals Bisphenol-A (BPA) or its analog Bisphenol-S (BPS). Previously very widely used in plastics and thermal receipt paper due to their heat resistance and stability, these are currently being phased out of thermal paper coatings due to their in-vivo accrual (via direct dermal absorption) and resultant oestrogen-mimicking and endocrine disruption. Modern thermal paper roll replacements, or their manufacturers, usually clearly state if they are Bisphenol free [BP-Free].

==Game Boy Printer Protocol==

The communication between the Game Boy and the Game Boy Printer is via a simple serial link. Serial clock (provided by the Game Boy for the printer), serial data output (from Game Boy to printer) as well as serial data input (to Game Boy from printer). The Game Boy sends a packet to the printer, to which the printer responds with an acknowledgement as well as a status code.

=== Packet Format ===
Communication is via the Game Boy sending to the printer a simple packet structure as shown below. In general, between the first &quot;sync_word&quot; til the checksum is the Game Boy communicating to the printer. The last two bytes of the packet are for the printer to acknowledge and show its current status code.

* Command may be either Initialize (0x01), Data (0x04), Print (0x02), or Inquiry (0x0F).
* Payload byte count size depends on the value of the `DATA_LENGTH` field.
* Compression field is a compression indicator. No compression = 0x00
* Checksum is a simple sum of bytes in command, data length, and the data payload.
* Status byte is a bit-field byte indicating various status of the printer itself. (e.g. If it is still printing)

=== Commands ===

==== Initialize (0x01) ====
* Typical Payload Size = 0
This packet is sent without a data payload. It signals to the printer to clear the settings and prepare for the first data payload.

==== Data (0x04) ====
* Typical Payload Size = 640
The data packet is for transferring the image data to the printer data buffer. The typical size of the data payload is 640 bytes since it can store two printable rows of 20 standard Game Boy tile (2 bit color in 8x8 pixels grid), of which the Game Boy tile takes 16 bytes.

==== Print (0x02) ====
* Typical Payload Size = 4
This commands the printer to start printing. It also has 4 settings bytes for printing.
==== Inquiry (0x0F) ====
* Typical Payload Size = 0
Used for checking the printer status byte. This may be for checking if there is enough data in the printer buffer to start printing smoothly or if the printer is currently printing.

=== Printer Status Reply Byte ===
==Usage today==
Mad Catz and Xchanger sold a kit that enabled users to connect a Game Boy to a PC and print images using the PC&#x27;s printer. Hobbyists outside the UK can also make their own cable for uploading images to their computer. A Game Boy Printer emulator is needed for the Game Boy to interface with the PC once linked via cable. The Game Boy Printer Paper has also been discontinued, and rolls of the genuine article that still produce a reliable image are becoming more difficult to find. Regular thermal paper, such as the kind used for POS terminals, can be cut to the proper width and used successfully with the Game Boy Printer.

The system will print a test message reading &quot;Hello&quot; if it is turned on while the feed button is held. According to the manual, this is used to test if the printer is functioning properly. To get around using six AA batteries (1.5 volts each) for the printer, a single 9V battery can be used if wired properly, because the printer requires 9V DC.

<doc id="350297" wikidata="Q104392" url="?curid=350297" title="Mohamed Naguib">
<text>Major General Mohamed Bey Naguib Youssef Qutb El-Qashlan (; 19 February 1901 – 28 August 1984), known simply as Mohamed Naguib (, ), was an Egyptian military officer and revolutionary who, along with Gamal Abdel Nasser, was one of the two principal leaders of the Free Officers movement of 1952 that toppled the monarchy of Egypt and the Sudan, leading to the establishment of the Republic of Egypt.

A distinguished and decorated general who was wounded in action in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, he became the leader of the Free Officers Movement of nationalist army officers opposed to the continued presence of British troops in Egypt and Sudan, and the corruption and incompetence of King Farouk. Following the toppling of Farouk in July 1952, Naguib went on to serve as the head of the Revolutionary Command Council, the prime minister of Egypt, and later its first president, successfully negotiating the independence of Sudan (hitherto a condominium of Egypt and the United Kingdom), and the withdrawal of all British military personnel from Egypt. His tenure as president came to end in November 1954 due to disagreements with other members of the Free Officers, particularly Nasser, who forced him to resign and succeeded him as president.

==Early life and education==
Mohamed Naguib was born on 19 February 1901 in Khartoum, Anglo-Egyptian Sudan to Youssef Naguib and Zohra Ahmed Othman. Zohra was from the esteemed Shaigiya tribe, while Youssef was a ranking officer of the Egyptian Armed Forces who had come from a notable Egyptian family of army officers. Naguib was the eldest of nine children.

Naguib attended secondary and military school at Gordon Memorial College in Khartoum, graduating in 1918. He joined the Egyptian Royal Guard in 1923. In 1927, Naguib became the first Egyptian military officer to obtain a law license. In 1929 he earned a postgraduate degree in political economy, and then another postgraduate degree in civil law in 1931.

==Military career==

In December 1931, Naguib was promoted to the rank of captain. He moved to the border patrol in Arish in 1934. He was part of the military committee that carried out the terms of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936. In Khartoum, he founded a newspaper for the Egyptian Armed Forces in 1937, and he was promoted to the rank of major on 6 May 1938.

Naguib tendered his resignation in protest following the Abdeen Palace incident of 1942. Naguib wrote in his autobiography that he had resigned since he had broken his oath of allegiance to the King by failing to prevent the British siege of the palace, but that Abdeen Palace officials thanked him for his actions regardless and refused to accept his resignation.

Naguib subsequently continued his upward trajectory through the hierarchy of the Egyptian military, achieving the rank of lieutenant colonel and the post of regional governor of the Sinai Peninsula in 1944. He took on leadership of the mechanized infantry of the Sinai in 1947, and was promoted to brigadier general in 1948.

Naguib performed outstandingly during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, where he was wounded seven times. For his service he was awarded the first military star of Fuad as well as the title of Bey. He was also subsequently awarded with the directorship of the Egyptian Military Academy, where he would ultimately encounter the members of the Free Officers movement .

==Free Officers Movement==
Mohamed Naguib was first introduced to the Free Officers Movement by Abdel Hakim Amer during his tenure as the director of the Royal Military Academy in Cairo. The Free Officers were a group of nationalist army officer veterans of the unsuccessful nationalist uprisings of 1935–36 and 1945–46 as well as the 1948 Arab Israeli War, fiercely opposed to the continuing presence of British military personnel in Egypt and Sudan since 1882, and the attendant political role that the United Kingdom had in Egyptian affairs. Additionally, they viewed the Egyptian and Sudanese monarchy as weak, corrupt, and incapable of protecting Egyptian and Sudanese national interests, particularly against the United Kingdom, and the State of Israel. In particular, they held King Farouk responsible for the poor conduct of the war in Palestine in which 78% of the former Mandate for Palestine was lost to the newly proclaimed State of Israel, and some three quarters of Palestine&#x27;s Muslim and Christian population were variously expelled from the country, or fled into exile. 
The movement had been led originally by Gamal Abdel Nasser, and was composed exclusively of servicemen who were all under 35 years of age and from low-income backgrounds. Nasser, who like Naguib was a veteran of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, felt that the movement needed an older officer from a distinguished military background in order to be taken seriously. The highly respected and nationally famous Naguib was the obvious choice, and he was invited to assume leadership of the movement. While this proved successful in strengthening the Free Officers, it would later cause great friction within the movement, and an eventual power struggle between the elder Naguib and the younger Nasser. Historians have noted that whilst Naguib understood his position and duty as being the movement&#x27;s bona fide leader, the younger Free Officers saw him as a figurehead who would yield to the collective decision-making of the movement, giving Naguib a more limited, symbolic role.

==Revolution of 1952==
On 23 July 1952 at about 1 am, the Free Officers launched the revolution with a coup d&#x27;état to depose King Farouk. Naguib was immediately appointed as Commander in Chief of the Army in order to keep the loyalty of the Armed Forces firmly behind the Revolution. His celebrated status as a hero of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, along with his jovial personality and elder statesmen demeanor also made him appear as a reassuring figure to the Egyptian public, who had not previously been exposed to Nasser and the other Free Officers.

The Free Officers chose to govern at first via Aly Maher Pasha, a former prime minister who was known for his opposition to the United Kingdom&#x27;s occupation of Egypt, and its interference in Egyptian affairs. The next evening, Naguib met with British diplomat John Hamilton. During the meeting Hamilton assured Naguib that the British government supported the abdication of King Farouk, that the Churchill government viewed the coup as an internal Egyptian matter, and that the United Kingdom would intervene only if it felt that British lives and property in Egypt were in danger.
The prospect of British intervention on behalf of Farouk was the biggest threat to the Revolution, and Hamilton&#x27;s message to Naguib gave the Free Officers the reassurance that they needed to follow through with deposing the King. On the morning of 26 July 1952, Maher arrived at the Ras El Tin Palace where Farouk was staying in order to present him with an ultimatum from Naguib: he was to abdicate his throne, and leave Egypt by 6 pm the following day, or the Egyptian troops gathered outside Ras El Tin would storm the palace and arrest him. Farouk agreed to the terms of the ultimatum, and the following day, in the presence of Maher, and the United States Ambassador Jefferson Caffery, boarded the Royal yacht Mahrousa, and left Egypt. In his memoirs, Naguib described how his journey to the dock to meet the deposed Farouk before the former King departed the country was delayed by throngs of people celebrating the Revolution. Caffery confirmed that Naguib was angry at missing the former King&#x27;s departure. Upon arrival at the dock, Naguib immediately took sail in a small vessel to meet Farouk on the Mahrousa, and formally bid him farewell.

In September, Naguib was appointed prime minister, and a member of the Royal Regent Council, with Nasser serving as the minister of interior. Farouk&#x27;s infant son succeeded him as Fuad II, and would be the last King of Egypt. The succession was designed to deny the United Kingdom a pretext for intervention, allowing the revolutionaries to maintain that they were opposed only to the corrupt regime of Farouk, and not to the monarchy itself. However, after consolidating their power, the Free Officers quickly moved to implement their long-held plans for abolishing the monarchy. Ali Maher&#x27;s government resigned on 7 September 1952, and Naguib was appointed prime minister. On 18 June 1953, almost 11 months after the revolution, the revolutionaries stripped the infant King Fuad II of his title, declared the end of the Kingdom of Egypt and the establishment of the Republic of Egypt.

==Presidency==

With the declaration of the Republic, Naguib was sworn in as its first President. Owing to the non-Egyptian ancestry of Muhammad Ali Pasha (the progenitor of the Muhammad Ali dynasty), and the earlier dynasties that had governed Egypt, Naguib was referenced in Western media as being the first native Egyptian ruler of Egypt since the Roman conquest of Egypt, or even earlier to Pharaoh Nectanebo II, whose reign ended in 342 BC. Naguib himself objected to this characterisation, stating:&quot;It has been said in the foreign press that I am the first Egyptian to govern Egypt since Cleopatra. Such words flatter but they do not align with our knowledge of our own history. For the sake of glorifying our own Blessed Movement, are we to say that the Fatimads were never Egyptian despite their centuries in Egypt? Do we now deny our kinship with the Ayyubids because of their origin even as we join Saladin&#x27;s eagle with the Liberation Flag as the symbol of our Revolution? And what of the members of the Mohammed Ali dynasty? Should our grievances against the former King and the flawed and corrupt rulers before him blind us to the nationalism of Abbas Hilmi II, whose devotion to Egypt against the occupiers cost him his throne, or the achievements of Ibrahim Pasha, the very best of the dynasty, who himself declared that the Sun of Egypt and the water of the Nile had made him Egyptian? Are we now to go through the family histories of all Egyptians and invalidate those born to a non-Egyptian parent? If so, I must start with myself. It is fairer and more accurate to say that we are all Egyptians, but I am the first Egyptian to have been raised from the ranks of the people to the highest office to govern Egypt as one of their own. It is an honour and a sacred burden great enough without the embellishments that foreign observers would add to it.&quot;

===Forced resignation===

When Naguib began showing signs of independence from Nasser by distancing himself from the RCC&#x27;s land reform decrees and drawing closer to Egypt&#x27;s established political forces, namely the Wafd and the Muslim Brotherhood, Nasser resolved to depose him. In late 1953, Nasser accused Naguib of supporting the recently outlawed Muslim Brotherhood and of harboring dictatorial ambitions. A brief power struggle broke out between Naguib and Nasser for control of the military and of Egypt. Nasser ultimately won the struggle and managed to force Naguib to resign from the presidency of Egypt in November 1954. Nasser then placed Naguib under informal house arrest in a suburban Cairo villa owned by Zeinab Al-Wakil, the wife of former Prime Minister Mostafa El-Nahas. Naguib was released from house arrest in 1971 by President Anwar Sadat.

==Personal life and death==
Naguib was married and had four children, three sons and a daughter. His sons were Farouk, Yusuf and Ali. &quot;Life&quot; magazine reported shortly after the revolution in August 1952 that his eldest son Farouk, who was 14 years old, was planning to change his name. His daughter died in 1951.

On 28 August 1984, Naguib died from liver cirrhosis in Cairo, Egypt. He was 83. Naguib had a military funeral that was attended by President Hosni Mubarak. Naguib&#x27;s coffin, draped in Egyptian flag, was carried on a gun carriage drawn by six horses as brass bands played funeral music. Hundreds of mourners, including government officials, foreign dignitaries and family members, marched behind the carriage.

==Legacy==
Shortly before his death in 1984, Naguib published his memoirs under the title &quot;I Was a President of Egypt&quot;. The book was widely circulated and was also translated into English under the title &quot;Egypt&#x27;s Destiny&quot;. A station of the Cairo Metro is named in his honor. A major road in the Al Amarat District of Khartoum is also named after him.

In December 2013, Interim Egyptian President Adly Mansour posthumously awarded Naguib the Order of the Nile, the highest honor of the Egyptian state. The award was received by his son, Mohamed Yusuf.

<doc id="350316" wikidata="Q3942828" url="?curid=350316" title="Rural Studio">
<text>The Rural Studio is a design-build architecture studio run by Auburn University. It teaches students about the social responsibilities of the profession of architecture and provides good houses and buildings for poor communities in rural west Alabama, US, part of what is called the &quot;Black Belt&quot;.

== History ==
The studio was founded in 1993 by architects Samuel Mockbee and D. K. Ruth. It is led by UK-born architect Andrew Freear. Each year the program builds several projects: a house by the third-year students, and two to three thesis projects by groups of 3 to 5 fifth-year students. The Rural Studio has built more than 80 houses and civic projects in Hale, Perry and Marengo counties. The Rural Studio is based in Newbern, a small town in Hale County. Many of its best-known projects are in the tiny community of Mason&#x27;s Bend, on the banks of the Black Warrior River.

The studio has been criticized for the way its projects take advantage of the power relations inherent in gift-giving, and for mistaking elitist architectural and middle-class values, rather than the process of political emancipation and self-determination, as a way to improve the lives of the poor.

== Notable projects ==

=== Safe House Black History Museum ===
The studio renovated, restored, and made an addition to the Safe House Black History Museum in Greensboro, Alabama, in the late 2010s. The redesign was awarded third place in American Architect&#x27;s Building of the Year competition.

=== $20K House ===
The $20K House is an ongoing research project at the Rural Studio that seeks to address the pressing need for decent and affordable housing in Hale County, Alabama. Nearly 30% of the people in Hale County live in poverty. Due to the lack of conventional credit for people with their level of income, and insufficient knowledge about alternative sources of funding, mobile homes offer the only chance for home ownership for many. Unlike a house, which is an asset for its owner, trailers deteriorate very quickly and depreciate over time. Mobile homes are also correlated with higher cancer rates due to the use of formaldehyde in their construction.

The $20k House project is intended to design a model home that could be reproduced on a large scale, and thereby become a viable alternative to a mobile home. The challenge is to build a house for $20,000, ten to twelve thousand of which will go towards materials and the remainder to contracted labor. Once a truly successful model has been designed, the aim is to sell the houses in conjunction with the &quot;502 Direct Loan&quot; provided by the Rural Housing Service. The project began in 2005, and there have been at least 16 iterations of the house.

<text>Cherry 2000 is a 1988 American science-fiction film directed by Steve De Jarnatt and starring David Andrews, Melanie Griffith, Tim Thomerson and Pamela Gidley. It was produced by Edward R. Pressman and Caldecot Chubb. The screenplay was by Michael Almereyda. Critic reviews were generally mixed.

== Plot ==
In the year 2017, the United States has fragmented into post-apocalyptic wastelands with a few civilized areas. An ongoing economic crisis has led to the recycling of aging 20th-century mechanical and technological equipment. Society has also become averse to intimacy, as well as both increasingly hypersexualized and bureaucratic. Robotic technology has produced gynoids as substitutes for wives. The declining instances of actual sex among men and women is litigious, with one brothel having lawyers draft up contracts detailing the intended sexual rendezvous.

Business executive Sam Treadwell owns a Cherry 2000 model as his wife. After she short circuits during sex on a wet kitchen floor, Sam is told by a repairman that she is damaged beyond repair, though her rare and valuable memory disk, which contains her entire personality, can be used in a new body if the same model can be found. A gynoid dealer tells Sam that the Cherry 2000 model is no longer produced and that the only remaining ones are in a defunct warehouse in &quot;Zone 7&quot;, a particularly dangerous, lawless area. With Cherry&#x27;s memory disk stored in a device that plays back Cherry&#x27;s voice, Sam hires Edith &quot;E&quot; Johnson, a tough tracker, to guide him to the factory. They set off in Edith&#x27;s heavily modified 1965 Ford Mustang.

Entering Zone 7, they encounter Lester, a wasteland overlord with deranged subordinates. Edith and Sam take refuge in an underground reservoir occupied by Six-Fingered Jake, an elderly tracker who was Edith&#x27;s mentor. When Lester&#x27;s men attack, the three attempt to escape, but Sam is knocked unconscious and taken to a 1950s-styled motel/village. Ginger, one of Lester&#x27;s gang, reveals herself as Sam&#x27;s ex-girlfriend, previously known as Elaine. Lester decides to induct Sam into the group, and Sam, believing that Edith and Jake are dead, goes along for a while. When he witnesses the group sadistically murdering a tracker, Sam decides to escape and runs into Edith and Jake, still quite alive. Jake, who had earlier led Sam to believe that the Cherry 2000 memory disk had been lost, still has it and gives it to Edith while he stays behind to draw off Lester&#x27;s gang.

Sam, a veteran of earlier wars, shows that he is a capable fighter, and Edith begins to have feelings for him. Sam&#x27;s own growing feelings toward Edith, though, are derailed when he hears Cherry&#x27;s voice accidentally play on the audio device. Continuing to work their way to the gynoid warehouse, they arrive at a brothel/gas station owned by Snappy Tom, a friend of Jake&#x27;s, where a dilapidated Aeronca Champion light airplane is stored. Edith repairs the plane using parts from the Mustang. Jake catches up with the group and reminisces with Snappy Tom, but Snappy&#x27;s live-in girlfriend betrays their location to Lester over the radio and shoots Jake in the back. Edith and Sam manage to escape in the plane.

Sam is almost ready to abandon the quest, but Edith is determined to complete her job as a tracker so Jake&#x27;s death will not become meaningless. As they land, Zone 7 is revealed to be actually the abandoned ruins of Las Vegas and the gynoid &quot;warehouse&quot; is actually a casino. Sam finally finds a functional Cherry 2000 model and activates her with the memory disk; however, being programmed only for home life and sex, the robot is incapable of adapting to the current dangerous situation when Lester and his gang attack.

In an extended battle, Sam, Edith, and Cherry climb aboard the airplane, but their combined weight prevents takeoff. Edith jumps out so that Sam and the robot can escape, but Sam realizes that Cherry cannot provide the human interaction that he and Edith have had and turns the plane around. Cherry, programmed to fulfill Sam&#x27;s wishes, offers to bring him a Pepsi, so he sends her away as he and Edith fight off Lester&#x27;s gang and take off in the plane. When Lester tries to lasso the plane, he gets caught in the rope and hangs himself from one of the ancient Las Vegas neon casino signs. Edith and Sam kiss as they fly away into the sunset.

==Location==

According to the credits, the film was shot entirely in Nevada. The van plunging into an open pit was shot at Three Kids Mine. The river-crossing sequence was filmed at the Hoover Dam. Scenes at the Sky Ranch were filmed at the Beehive group camping area in the Valley of Fire State Park. E and Sam&#x27;s first kiss was filmed in the upper reaches of the Las Vegas Wash. Adobe Flats was filmed at Eldorado Valley Dry Lake Bed. The town of Glory Hole was filmed in Goldfield, Nevada.
The Integratron building in Landers, California, was used as the casino that was the &quot;abandoned manufacturing plant&quot; holding a rare copy of the outdated Cherry 2000 gynoid at the end of the film.
The fortress-like building featured in the film is in Commerce, California, at the location of a former tire factory, which was renovated and transformed into the Citadel Outlet Mall.

==Release==
After its completion in December 1985, Orion Pictures originally scheduled &quot;Cherry 2000&quot; for a U.S. release on August 15, 1986. Sometime later, the date was postponed to March 1987, then September 1987. An article in &quot;The Times Leader&quot; commented on May 22, 1987, that the film had been &quot;shelved since [1986], this western is set in the 21st century. Hope it opens by then.&quot; Joseph Gelmins wrote in &quot;Newsday&quot; that it was scheduled for September. In October 1987, &quot;The Palm Beach Post&quot; announced the film for release in February 1988.

Producer Edward R. Pressman confessed that &quot;Cherry 2000&quot;″s combination of genres, styles, and themes stumped promoters at Orion, resulting in its repeated shelving. On discussing the delays of the film, Pressman stated that the film was a &quot;tough sell&quot; while the director Steve DeJarnatt stated &quot;no one who&#x27;s seen it hates it or anything&quot; and that &quot;It&#x27;s also kind of a soft film. I don&#x27;t think anyone really knows how to market it.&quot;

==Home Media==
&quot;Cherry 2000&quot; was released on VHS in North America by Orion Home Video on November 17, 1988. A reviewer in &quot;Variety&quot; noted that the film had &quot;gone fast to video after the briefest of theatrical screenings&quot;.

==Reception==
The film holds a 38% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 21 reviews, with a weighted average of 4.24/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;While &quot;Cherry 2000&quot; has a certain low-budget appeal, all but the most ardent genre enthusiasts are likely to find its silly story and uneven performances unintentionally amusing&quot;. Among contemporary reviews, the 1988 &quot;Variety&#x27;s Film Reviews&quot; regarded Melanie Griffith as the film&#x27;s greatest asset, who &quot;lifts the material whenever she&#x27;s on screen&quot;, and described the production as &quot;quite lavish and the Nevada locations suitably rugged. Production design by John J. Moore is a major plus.&quot;

<text>Programming Language for Business or PL/B is a business-oriented programming language originally called DATABUS and designed by Datapoint in 1972 as an alternative to COBOL because Datapoint&#x27;s 8-bit computers could not fit COBOL into their limited memory, and because COBOL did not at the time have facilities to deal with Datapoint&#x27;s built-in keyboard and screen.

A version of DATABUS became an ANSI standard, and the name PL/B came about when Datapoint chose not to release its trademark on the DATABUS name.

== Functionality ==

Much like Java and .NET, PL/B programs are compiled into an intermediate byte-code, which is then interpreted by a runtime library. Because of this, many PL/B programs can run on DOS, Unix, Linux, and Windows operating systems. PL/B (Databus) is actively used all over the world, and has several forums on the Internet dedicated to supporting software developers.

PL/B has a database capability built-in with ISAM and Associative Hashed Indexes, as well as functionality for working with ODBC, SQL, Oracle, sequential, random access, XML and JSON files.

PL/B also has the ability to access external routines through COM objects, DLLs and .NET assemblies. Full access to the .NET framework is built into many versions.

Several implementations of the language are capable of running as an Application Server like Citrix, and connecting to remote databases through a data manager.

<doc id="350325" wikidata="Q216958" url="?curid=350325" title="Joseph Fouché">
<text>Joseph Fouché, 1st Duc d&#x27;Otrante, 1st Comte Fouché (; 21 May 1759 – 26 December 1820) was a French , revolutionary, and Minister of Police under First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte, who later became a subordinate of Emperor Napoleon. He was particularly known for the ferocity with which he suppressed the Lyon insurrection during the Revolution in 1793 and for being a highly competent minister of police under the Directory, the Consulate, and the Empire. In 1815, he served as President of the Executive Commission, which was the provisional government of France installed after the abdication of Napoleon. In English texts, his title is often translated as Duke of Otranto.

==Youth==
Fouché was born in Le Pellerin, a small village near Nantes. His mother was Marie Françoise Croizet (1720–1793), and his father was Julien Joseph Fouché (1719–1771). He was educated at the college of the Oratorians at Nantes, and showed aptitude for literary and scientific studies. Wanting to become a teacher, he was sent to an institution kept by brethren of the same order in Paris. There he made rapid progress, and was soon appointed to tutorial duties at the colleges of Niort, Saumur, Vendôme, Juilly and Arras. There he was initiated into Freemasonry at &quot;Sophie Madeleine&quot; lodge in 1788. At Arras he had had some encounters with Maximilien Robespierre (and his sister Charlotte) both before the revolution and in the early days of the French Revolution (1789).

In October 1790, he was transferred by the Oratorians to their college at Nantes, in an attempt to control his advocacy of revolutionary principles - however, Fouché became even more of a democrat. His talents and anti-clericalism brought him into favour with the population of Nantes, especially after he became a leading member of the local Jacobin Club. When the college of the Oratorians was dissolved in May 1792, Fouché left the Oratorians, having never taken any major vows.

==A revolutionary republican==
After the downfall of the monarchy on 10 August 1792 (following the storming of the royal Tuileries Palace), he was elected as deputy for the &quot;département&quot; of the Loire-Inférieure to the National Convention, which proclaimed the French Republic on 22 September.

Fouché&#x27;s interests brought him into contact with the Marquis de Condorcet and the Girondists, and he became a Girondist himself. However, their lack of support for the trial and execution of King Louis XVI (December 1792 - 21 January 1793) led him to join the Jacobins, the more decided partisans of revolutionary doctrine. Fouché was strongly in favor of the king&#x27;s immediate execution, and denounced those who &quot;wavered before the shadow of a king&quot;.

The crisis that resulted from the declaration of war by the Convention against Great Britain and the Dutch Republic (1 February 1793, &quot;see French Revolutionary Wars&quot;), and a little later against Spain, made Fouché famous as one of the Jacobin radicals holding power in Paris. While the armies of the First Coalition threatened the north-east of France, a revolt of the Royalist peasants in Brittany and La Vendée menaced the Convention on the west. That body sent Fouché with a colleague, Villers, as representatives on mission invested with almost dictatorial powers for the crushing of the revolt of &quot;the whites&quot; (the royalist colour). The ruthlessness with which he carried out these duties earned him a reputation, and he soon held the post of commissioner of the republic in the &quot;département&quot; of the Nièvre.

Together with Pierre Gaspard Chaumette, he helped to initiate the dechristianization movement in the autumn of 1793. In the Nièvre department, Fouché ransacked churches, sent their valuables to the treasury, and helped establish the Cult of Reason. He ordered the words &quot;Death is an eternal sleep&quot; to be inscribed over the gates to cemeteries. He also fought luxury and wealth, wanting to abolish the use of currency. The new cult was inaugurated at Notre Dame de Paris by &quot;The Festival of Reason&quot;. It was here that Fouché gave &quot;the most famous example of its [dechristianization] early phase&quot;. Ironically enough, it was only a year previous that Fouché had been &quot;an advocate of the role of the clergy in education,&quot; yet he was now &quot;abandoning the role of religion in society altogether in favour of &#x27;the revolutionary and clearly philosophical spirit&#x27; he had first wanted for education.&quot; Overall, the dechristianization movement &quot;reflected the wholesale transformation that Jacobin and radical leaders were beginning to see as necessary for the survival of the Republic, and the creation of a republican citizenry.&quot;
Fouché went on to Lyon in November with Jean-Marie Collot d&#x27;Herbois to execute the reprisals of the Convention. Lyon had revolted against the Convention. Lyon, on 23 November, was declared to be in a &quot;state of revolutionary war&quot; by Collot and Fouché. The two men then formed the Temporary Commission for Republican Supervision. He inaugurated his mission with a festival notable for its obscene parody of religious rites. Fouché and Collot then brought in &quot;a contingent of almost two thousand of the Parisian Revolutionary Army&quot; to begin their terrorizing. &quot;On 4 December, 60 men, chained together, were blasted with grapeshot on the plain de Brotteaux outside the city, and 211 more the following day. Grotesquely ineffective, these mitraillades resulted in heaps of mutilated, screaming, half-dead victims, who were finished off with sabres and musket fire by soldiers physically sickened at the task.&quot; Events like this made Fouché infamous as &quot;The Executioner of Lyons.&quot; The Commission was not happy with the methods used for killing the rebels so, soon after, &quot;more normal firing squads supplemented the guillotine.&quot; These methods led to the carrying out of &quot;over 1800 executions in the coming months.&quot; Fouché, claiming that &quot;Terror, salutary terror, is now the order of the day here... We are causing much impure blood to flow, but it is our duty to do so, it is for humanity&#x27;s sake,&quot; called for the execution of 1,905 citizens. As Napoleon&#x27;s biographer Alan Schom has written:
Alas, Fouché&#x27;s enthusiasm had proved a little too effective, for when the blood from the mass executions in the center of Lyons gushed from severed heads and bodies into the streets, drenching the gutters of the Rue Lafont, the vile-smelling red flow nauseated the local residents, who irately complained to Fouché and demanded payment for damages. Fouché, sensitive to their outcry, obliged them by ordering the executions moved out of the city to the Brotteaux field, along the Rhône.
From late 1793 until spring 1794, every day &quot;batch after batch of bankers, scholars, aristocrats, priests, nuns, and wealthy merchants and their wives, mistresses, and children&quot; were taken from the city jails to Brotteaux field, tied to stakes, and dispatched by firing squads or mobs. Outwardly, Fouché&#x27;s conduct was marked by the utmost savagery, and on his return to Paris early in April 1794, he thus characterised his policy: &quot;The blood of criminals fertilises the soil of liberty and establishes power on sure foundations&quot;.

==Conflict with Robespierre==
Robespierre was appalled by the atrocities Fouché committed while on mission. In addition, early in June 1794, at the time of the &quot;Festival of the Supreme Being&quot;, Fouché went so far as to mock the theistic revival. Robespierre exchanged angry communications with him, then tried to expel Fouché from the Jacobin Club on 14 July 1794. Fouché, however, was working with his usual energy and plotted Robespierre&#x27;s overthrow from behind the scenes while remaining in hiding in Paris. Because Robespierre was losing his influence and because Fouché was under the protection of Barras, Fouché ultimately survived Robespierre&#x27;s final wave of purges.

The remaining ultraleftists (Collot d&#x27;Herbois, Billaud-Varenne), and the moderates (Bourdon de l&#x27;Oise, Fréron) who had won the support of the nonaligned majority of the Convention (&quot;Marais&quot;), also opposed Robespierre. Fouché engineered Robespierre&#x27;s overthrow, culminating in the dramatic Coup of the 9th Thermidor on 28 July 1794. Fouché is reported to have worked furiously on the overthrow:

Rising at early morn he would run round till night calling on deputies of all shades of opinion, saying to each and every one, &quot;You perish tomorrow if he [Robespierre] does not&quot;.

Fouché describes his activities in this way in his memoirs:

Being recalled to Paris, I dared to call upon [Robespierre] from the tribune, to make good his accusation. He caused me to be expelled from the Jacobins, of whom he was the high-priest; this was for me equivalent to a decree of proscription. I did not trifle in contending for my head, nor in long and secret deliberations with such of my colleagues as were threatened with my own fate. I merely said to them... &#x27;You are on the list, you are on the list as well as myself; I am certain of it!&#x27;

Fouché, as both a ruthless suppressor of Federalist rebellion and one of the key architects of Robespierre&#x27;s overthrow, embodied the merciless French politics of the republic era.

==Directory==
The ensuing movement in favour of more merciful methods of government threatened to sweep away the group of politicians who had been mainly instrumental in carrying through the &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;. Nonetheless, largely because of Fouché&#x27;s intrigues, they remained in power for a time after July. This also brought divisions in the Thermidor group, which soon became almost isolated, with Fouché spending all his energy on countering the attacks of the moderates. He was himself denounced by François Antoine de Boissy d&#x27;Anglas on 9 August 1795, which caused his arrest, but the Royalist rebellion of 13 Vendémiaire Year IV aborted his execution, and he was released in the amnesty which followed the proclamation of the Constitution of 5 Fructidor.

In the ensuing Directory government (1795–1799), Fouché remained at first in obscurity, but the relations he had with the far left, once headed by Chaumette and now by François-Noël Babeuf, helped him to rise once more. He is said to have betrayed Babeuf&#x27;s plot of 1796 to the Director Paul Barras; however, later research tended to throw doubt on the assertion.

His rise from poverty was slow, but in 1797 he gained an appointment dealing with military supplies, which offered considerable opportunities for making money. After first offering his services to the Royalists, whose movement was then gathering force, he again decided to support the Jacobins and Barras. In Pierre François Charles Augereau&#x27;s anti-Royalist &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; of Fructidor 1797, Fouché offered his services to Barras, who in 1798 appointed him French ambassador to the Cisalpine Republic. In Milan, he was judged so high-handed that he was removed, but he was able for a time to hold his own and to intrigue successfully against his successor.

Early in 1799, he returned to Paris, and after a brief stint as ambassador at The Hague, he became minister of police at Paris on 20 July 1799. The newly elected director, Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès, wanted to curb the excesses of the Jacobins, who had recently reopened their club. Fouché closed the Jacobin Club in a daring manner, hunting down those pamphleteers and editors, whether Jacobins or Royalists, who were influential critics of the government, so that at the time of the return of general Napoleon Bonaparte from the Egyptian campaign (October 1799), the ex-Jacobin was one of the most powerful men in France.

==In Napoleon&#x27;s service==
Knowing the unpopularity of the Directors, Fouché joined Bonaparte and Sieyès, who were plotting the Directory&#x27;s overthrow. His activity in furthering the 18 Brumaire coup (9–10 November 1799) ensured him the favor of Bonaparte, who kept him in office.

In the ensuing French Consulate (1799–1804), Fouché efficiently countered the opposition to Bonaparte. He helped increase centralization and efficiency of the police in both Paris and the provinces. Fouché was careful to temper Napoleon&#x27;s more arbitrary actions, which at times won him the gratitude even of the royalists. While exposing an unrealistic intrigue in which the duchesse de Guiche Ida d&#x27;Orsay was the chief agent, Fouché took care that she should escape.

Equally skilful was his action in the so-called Aréna-Ceracchi plot (Conspiration des poignards), in which &quot;agents provocateurs&quot; of the police were believed to have played a sinister part. The chief &quot;conspirators&quot; were easily ensnared and were executed when the Plot of the Rue Saint-Nicaise (December 1800) enabled Bonaparte to act with rigour. This far more serious attempt (in which conspirators exploded a bomb near the First Consul&#x27;s carriage with results disastrous to the bystanders) was soon seen by Fouché as the work of Royalists. When Napoleon showed himself eager to blame the still powerful Jacobins, Fouché firmly declared that he would not only assert but would prove that the outrage was the work of Royalists. However, his efforts failed to avert the Bonaparte-led repression of the leading Jacobins.

In other matters (especially in that known as the &quot;Plot of the Placards&quot; in the spring of 1802), Fouché was thought to have saved the Jacobins from the vengeance of the Consulate, and Bonaparte decided to rid himself of a man who had too much power to be desirable as a subordinate. On the proclamation of Bonaparte as First Consul for life (1 August 1802) Fouché was deprived of his office, a blow softened by the suppression of the ministry of police and by the assignment of most of its duties to an extended Ministry of Justice. Napoleon was, in fact, so intimidated by his minister of police that he did not dismiss the man personally, sending instead a servant with the information that – in addition to getting 35,000 yearly francs income as a senator and a piece of land worth 30,000 francs a year – he would also receive over a million francs from the reserve funds of the police.

After 1802, he went back to freemasonry, attending &quot;Les Citoyens réunis&quot; lodge in Melun. Cambacérès who was Deputy Grand Master of Grand Orient de France, helped him becoming Conservator of the &quot;Grande Loge symbolique Générale&quot; attached to the Supreme Council of France, where he would be in charge of Masonic Justice. There he could find a valuable source of information on Freemasons throughout the empire.

Fouché did become a senator and took half of the reserve funds of the police which had accumulated during his tenure of office. He continued, however, to intrigue through his spies, who tended to have more information than that of the new minister of police, and competed successfully for the favor of Napoleon at the time of the Georges Cadoudal-Charles Pichegru conspiracy (February–March 1804), becoming instrumental in the arrest of the Duc d&#x27;Enghien. Fouché would later say of Enghien&#x27;s subsequent execution, &quot;It was worse than a crime; it was a mistake&quot; (a remark also frequently attributed to Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord).

After the proclamation of the First French Empire, Fouché again became head of the re-constituted ministry of police (July 1804), and later of Internal Affairs, with activities as important as those carried out under the Consulate. His police agents were omnipresent, and the terror which Napoleon and Fouché inspired partly accounts for the absence of conspiracies after 1804. After the Battle of Austerlitz (December 1805), Fouché uttered the famous words: &quot;Sire, Austerlitz has shattered the old aristocracy; the Faubourg Saint-Germain no longer conspires&quot;.
Nevertheless, Napoleon did retain feelings of distrust, or even of fear, towards Fouché, as was proven by his conduct in the early days of 1808. While engaged in the campaign of Spain, the emperor heard rumours that Fouché and Charles Maurice de Talleyrand, once bitter enemies, were having meetings in Paris during which Joachim Murat, King of Naples, had been approached. At once he hurried to Paris, but found nothing to incriminate Fouché. In that year Fouché received the title of Duke of Otranto, which Bonaparte created—under the French name &quot;Otrante&quot;—a &quot;duché grand-fief&quot; (a rare, hereditary, but nominal honor) in the satellite Kingdom of Naples.

When, during the absence of Napoleon in the Austrian campaign of 1809, the British Walcheren expedition threatened the safety of Antwerp, Fouché issued an order to the &quot;préfet&quot; of the northern &quot;départements&quot; of the Empire for the mobilization of 60,000 National Guards, adding to the order this statement: &quot;Let us prove to Europe that although the genius of Napoleon can throw lustre on France, his presence is not necessary to enable us to repulse the enemy&quot;. The emperor&#x27;s approval of the measure was no less marked than his disapproval of Fouché&#x27;s words.

The next months brought further friction between emperor and minister. The latter, knowing Napoleon&#x27;s desire for peace at the close of 1809, undertook to make secret overtures to the British cabinet of Spencer Perceval. Napoleon opened negotiations only to find that Fouché had forestalled him. His rage against his minister was extreme, and on 3 June 1810 he dismissed him from his office. However, Napoleon never completely disgraced a man who might again be useful, and Fouché received the governorship of the Rome &quot;département&quot;. At the moment of his departure, Fouché took the risk of not surrendering to Napoleon all of certain important documents of his former ministry (falsely declaring that the some had been destroyed); the emperor&#x27;s anger was renewed, and Fouché, on learning of this after his arrival to Florence, prepared to sail to the United States.

Compelled by the weather and intense sea-sickness to put back into port, he found a mediator in Elisa Bonaparte, Grand Duchess of Tuscany, thanks to whom he was allowed to settle in Aix-en-Provence. He eventually returned to his domain of &quot;Point Carré&quot;. In 1812 he attempted in vain to turn Napoleon from the projected invasion of Russia, and on the return of the emperor in haste from Smarhoń to Paris at the close of that year, the ex-minister of police was suspected of involvement in the conspiracy of Claude François de Malet, which had been unexpectedly successful.

Fouché cleared his name and gave the emperor useful advice concerning internal affairs and the diplomatic situation. Nevertheless, the emperor, still distrustful, ordered him to undertake the government of the Illyrian provinces. On the break-up of the Napoleonic system in Germany (October 1813), Fouché was ordered on missions to Rome and thence to Naples, in order to watch the movements of Joachim Murat. Before Fouché arrived in Naples, Murat invaded the Roman territory, whereupon Fouché received orders to return to France. He arrived in Paris on 10 April 1814 at the time when Napoleon was being compelled by his marshals to abdicate.

Fouché&#x27;s conduct in this crisis was characteristic. As senator he advised the Senate to send a deputation to Charles, comte d&#x27;Artois, brother of Louis XVIII, with a view to a reconciliation between the monarchy and the nation. A little later he addressed to Napoleon, then banished to Elba, a letter begging him in the interests of peace and of France to withdraw to the United States. To the new sovereign Louis XVIII he sent an appeal in favour of liberty, and recommending the adoption of measures which would conciliate all interests.

The response to the latter was unsatisfactory, and when he found that there were no hopes of advancement, he entered into relations with conspirators who sought the overthrow of the Bourbons. The Marquis de Lafayette and Louis Nicolas Davout were involved in the issue, but their refusal to take the course desired by Fouché and others led to nothing being done.

==Hundred Days and Bourbon restoration==

Soon Napoleon escaped from Elba and made his way in triumph to Paris. Shortly before his arrival in Paris (19 March 1815), Louis XVIII sent Fouché an offer of the ministry of police, which he declined: &quot;It is too late; the only plan to adopt is to retreat&quot;. He then foiled an attempt by Royalists to arrest him, and on the arrival of Napoleon he received for the third time the portfolio of police. That, however, did not prevent him from entering into secret relations with the Austrian statesman Klemens Wenzel von Metternich in Vienna, his aim being to prepare for all eventualities. Meanwhile, he used all his powers to induce the emperor to democratize his rule, and he is said to have caused the insertion of the words: &quot;the sovereignty resides in the people—it is the source of power&quot; in the declaration of the &quot;Conseil d&#x27;État&quot;. But the autocratic tendencies of Napoleon could not be overridden, and Fouché, seeing the fall of the emperor to be imminent, took measures to expedite it and secure his own interests.

In 1814, Fouché had joined the invading allies and conspired against Napoleon. However, he joined Napoléon again during his return and was police minister during the latter&#x27;s short-lived reign, the Hundred Days. After Napoléon&#x27;s ultimate defeat in the Battle of Waterloo, Fouché again started plotting against Napoleon and joined the opposition of the parliament. He headed the provisional government and tried to negotiate with the allies. He probably also aimed at establishing a republic with himself as head of state, with the help of some Republican freemasons. These plans were never realised, and the Bourbons regained power in July 1815. And again, Fouché&#x27;s services were necessary: as Talleyrand, another notorious &quot;intrigant&quot;, became the prime minister of the Kingdom of France, Fouché was named his minister of police: so he was a minister of King Louis XVIII, the brother of Louis XVI.

Ironically, Fouché had voted for the death sentence after the trial of Louis XVI. Thus, he belonged to the &quot;regicides&quot;, and ultra-royalists both within the cabinet and without could hardly tolerate him as a member of the government. Fouché, once a revolutionary using extreme terror against the Bourbon supporters, now initiated a campaign of White Terror against real and imagined enemies of the Royalist restoration (officially directed against those who had plotted and supported Napoléon&#x27;s return to power). Even Prime Minister Talleyrand disapproved of such practices, including the execution of Michel Ney and compiling proscription lists of other military men and former republican politicians. Famous, or rather infamous, is the conversation between Fouché and Lazare Carnot, who had been interior minister during the Hundred Days:

Carnot: &quot;Where should I go then, traitor?&quot;

Fouché: &quot;Go where you want, imbecile!&quot;

Fouché was soon relegated to the post of French ambassador in Saxony; Talleyrand himself lost his portfolio soon after, having been Prime Minister from 9 July to 26 September 1815. In 1816, the royalist authorities found Fouché&#x27;s further services useless, and he was proscribed as a regicide. Fouche settled first in Prague, then in Linz and finally in Trieste, his considerable wealth allowed him to live comfortably and he spent his time writing his memoirs and seeing to the upbringing and education of his children. He died in 1820 and is now buried in Ferrières-en-Brie.

Fouché wrote some political pamphlets and reports, the chief of which are:

==In literature and on screen==
* The Austrian novelist Stefan Zweig wrote a biography entitled &quot;Joseph Fouché&quot;. Zweig takes a psychological approach to understanding the complicated minister of police. Zweig asks himself in the beginning of the book about how Fouché could &quot;survive&quot; in power from the revolution to the monarchy.
* Fouché also appears as one of the main characters in &quot;For the King&quot;, a novel by Catherine Delors (Dutton, 2010), where his role in the Plot of the Rue Saint-Nicaise is discussed.
* Fouché was featured as one of the two main (and only) characters in the play by Jean-Claude Brisville &quot;Supping with the Devil&quot; in which he is depicted dining with Talleyrand while deciding how to preserve their respective powers under the coming regime. The drama was hugely successful and turned into a film &quot;The Supper&quot; in 1992 directed by Édouard Molinaro, starring Claude Rich and Claude Brasseur.
* Joseph Conrad portrayed Fouché briefly in his short story &quot;The Duel&quot; (1924), which was filmed in 1977 as &quot;The Duellists&quot;, written by Gerald Vaughan-Hughes and directed by Ridley Scott. Fouché is portrayed by Albert Finney.
* Fouché appears as a recurring character in the Roger Brook series of historical novels by Dennis Wheatley.
* Fouché is referenced on the first page of the novel &quot;Perfume: The Story of a Murderer&quot; by Patrick Süskind as a &#x27;gifted abomination&#x27;.
* Fouché is an important character in the novel &quot;The Hastening Wind&quot; by British novelist Edward Grierson, which concerns the Cadoudal conspiracy to assassinate Napoleon in 1804.
* In &quot;Mountolive&quot; (1958), the third novel of Lawrence Durrell&#x27;s &quot;Alexandria Quartet&quot;, a French diplomat is said to have (ironically) complimented the cruel and venal Egyptian Minister of the Interior, Memlik Pasha, by telling him that he is &quot;... regarded as the best Minister of Interior in modern history--indeed, since Fouché there has been no-one to equal you.&quot; Memlik is so taken with the comparison that he orders a bust of Fouché from France, which then sits in his reception room gathering dust.
* In Bernard Cornwell&#x27;s novel &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Enemy&quot;, Fouché is mentioned as an early mentor of the French spymaster Pierre Ducos, who becomes a bitter enemy of Richard Sharpe in later novels.
* Fouché makes an appearance in the Doctor Who novel &quot;World Game&quot; by Terrance Dicks.
* Fouché appears in the novel &quot;The Twisted Sword&quot;, by Winston Graham.
* The novel &quot;Captain Cut-Throat&quot; by John Dickson Carr, set in Napoleonic France in 1805, when the invasion of England was planned, portrays Fouché scheming and counter-scheming various complicated plots.
* Fouché is a significant character in &quot;The Carton Chronicles: The Curious Tale of Flashman&#x27;s true father&quot; (2010) by Keith Laidler.

* He is a character in &quot;Treason&#x27;s Tide&quot; by Robert Wilton, set during the summer of 1805. Originally published as &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s Gold&quot; in June 2011, it was re-issued under the new title in February 2013 by Corvus, an imprint of Atlantic Books.
* Fouché is portrayed by Morris Perry in the BBC&#x27;s War and Peace (1972 TV series) episode 11, Men of Destiny.
* Fouché is mentioned in &quot;Diary of a Man in Despair&quot; by Friedrich Reck-Malleczewen. Reck relates a meeting with Heinrich Himmler in 1934 at which Himmler asks Reck for information. Surprised at Himmler&#x27;s request, Reck asks Himmler why the Fouché of the Third Reich needed information from him. Reck relates that Himmler clearly had no idea who Fouché was.
* &quot;The 48 Laws of Power&quot; cites him as an example of following Rule #35: Master The Art Of Timing.
* He is a character in The Paris Affair by Teresa Grant

<doc id="350328" wikidata="Q109638089" url="?curid=350328" title="Beloit Sky Carp">
<text>The Beloit Sky Carp are a Minor League Baseball team of the Midwest League and the High-A affiliate of the Miami Marlins. They are located in Beloit, Wisconsin, and play their home games at ABC Supply Stadium. They previously played at Harry C. Pohlman Field from its opening in 1982 until moving into their current ballpark in August 2021. 

Originally known as the Beloit Brewers from 1982 to 1994 and the Beloit Snappers from 1995 to 2021, the team played in the Class A Midwest League from 1982 to 2020. In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s reorganization of Minor League Baseball in 2021, Beloit was shifted to the High-A Central, though this was renamed the Midwest League in 2022. The team rebranded as the Sky Carp prior to the 2022 season.

==History==

The Beloit Brewers joined the Midwest League as an expansion franchise in 1982. The club was a Milwaukee Brewers farm team from its inception through 2004. Beloit switched to the Minnesota Twins&#x27; farm system for the 2005 season. The organization adopted the Snappers nickname in 1995 after using its parent team&#x27;s nickname for its first 13 seasons. The Snappers&#x27; name derived from the snapping turtle, because Beloit was formerly known as Turtle Village, and there is still a Turtle Creek and a town of Turtle. All of these are named for a turtle-shaped Indian mound on the campus of Beloit College.

After the Brewers and Snappers ended their affiliation, efforts were started to build a new stadium similar to the facilities used by the Rockford RiverHawks or the Wisconsin Timber Rattlers. One possible scenario involved construction on a site near Janesville, which could have included renaming the team to reflect a broader Rock County audience. However, no new stadium was built and improvements, including redoing the entire field and repairing the concrete concourse, were made to the existing site. After the 2012 season, the city of Beloit appropriated $100,000 in order to completely redo the outfield. The outfield was raised and leveled with the infield and a new sprinkler system was installed.

In September 2018, the team entered into the process of being sold to a new group of investors who planned to build a new ballpark in downtown Beloit. The sale was cancelled in May 2020 amid uncertainty surrounding the Professional Baseball Agreement between Minor and Major League Baseball set to expire after the 2020 season. The group, led by Quint Studer, retained the right to operate the Snappers in 2020 and continued to move forward with plans to build a new stadium. On June 15, 2020, construction began on the new ABC Supply Stadium. The Snappers started the 2021 season at Pohlman Field, and played their first game at ABC Supply Stadium on August 3.

Prior to the 2021 season, the Snappers were organized into the High-A Central. Plans to rebrand the team for the 2021 season, with a new name selected through a &quot;name the team contest&quot; and a new mascot, were postponed until 2022. In November 2021, the team rebranded as the Beloit Sky Carp, taking their new moniker from a nickname for geese. In 2022, the High-A Central became known as the Midwest League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization.

===Former players===
The 2003 team included two sons of former major league players. Prince Fielder, the son of former American League home run champion Cecil Fielder and Tony Gwynn Jr., son of Tony Gwynn. Future major leaguer Danny Valencia played for the 2007 team. Another noted major leaguer, Jim Morris of &quot;The Rookie&quot; fame played for the Beloit Brewers when he came out of college in the 1980s. Other former Snappers players who moved on to major league ball include Greg Vaughn, Geoff Jenkins, Jeff D&#x27;Amico, Ron Belliard, and Yovani Gallardo. Minnesota Twins players that have come through include Matt Garza and Kevin Slowey.

<text>Bridlington is a seaside town and civil parish in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England. It is on the Holderness part (Flamborough Head to the Humber estuary) of the Yorkshire Coast by the North Sea. The town is about north of Hull and east of York. The stream called Gypsey Race flows through the town and enters the North Sea at the harbour.

The Priory Church of St Mary and associated Bayle (or gate) are Grade I listed buildings on the site of an Augustinian Priory. As a sea-fishing port, the town is known for shellfish, and is the largest lobster port in Europe, with over 300 tonnes of the crustaceans landed there each year. It has been termed the &quot;Lobster Capital of Europe&quot;. Alongside manufacturing, retail and service firms, its main trade is summer tourism. It holds one of the UK&#x27;s coastal weather stations.

==History==
===Ancient history===
Archaeological evidence shows habitation of the area around the Bronze Age and Roman Britain era. The date of earliest habitation at Bridlington is unknown, but the man-made Danes Dyke at nearby Flamborough Head goes back to the Bronze Age. 

A Roman road from York, now Woldgate, can be traced across the Yorkshire Wolds into the town. Roman coins have been found: two hoards in the harbour area, along with two Greek coins from the second century BC — suggesting the port was in use long before the Roman conquest of Britain.

In the fourth century AD, Count Theodosius set up signal stations on the North Yorkshire coast to warn of Saxon raids. It has been suggested that the current town was built near the site of a Roman maritime station called . In the early second-century, Ptolemy described what was possibly Bridlington Bay in his &quot;Geography&quot; as &quot;Gabrantwikone bay suitable for a harbour&quot;. No sheltered ancient harbour has been found, coastal erosion will have destroyed traces of any Roman installation near the harbour.

Another station at Flamborough Head is also believed to have had one – probably on Beacon Hill (now a gravel quarry) from where Filey, Scarborough Castle and the Whitby promontory can be seen. Another suggestion has been a line of signal stations stretching south round Bridlington Bay. A fort at Bridlington would have made a centre of operations for these. This counterpart to the northern chain would have guarded a huge accessible anchorage from barbarian piracy.

===Manor of Bretlinton===
Near Dukes Park are two bowl barrows known as Butt Hills, designated ancient monuments in the National Heritage List for England of Historic England. Nearby are remains of an Anglo-Saxon cemetery on a farm outside Sewerby. The several suggested origins all trace the name to the Anglo-Saxon custom of matching a personal name with a settlement type. Here the personal names advanced include Bretel, Bridla and Berhtel, attached to , an Old English term for a small farming community. In 1072 the area was given to Gilbert de Gant, uncle of the later king King Stephen, it was inherited by his son Walter and thereafter appears to follow the normal descent of that family.

The 1086 &quot;Domesday Book&quot; is earliest known reference to Bridlington being record as &quot;Bretlinton&quot;: the settlement has since been called &quot;Berlington&quot;, &quot;Brellington&quot; and &quot;Britlington&quot; before gaining its present name in the 19th century. The &quot;Domesday Book&quot; records that was the Hunthow Wapentake&#x27;s meeting point (the wapentake later merged with neighbouring wapentakes to form the Dickering Wapentake). The wapentake was held by Earl Morcar, it later passed to William the Conqueror by . It also records the effect of the Harrying of the North: the annual value of the land had fallen from £32 in the time of Edward the Confessor to eight shillings (£0.40) at the time of the survey, comprising two villeins and one socman with one and a half Carucate, the rest being waste.

===Priory, port and town charter ===
Walter de Gant founded an Augustinian priory on the land in 1133, confirmed by Henry I in a charter. Several succeeding kings confirmed and extended Walter de Gant&#x27;s gift: King Stephen granted an additional right to have a port, King John in 1200 gave permission for a weekly market and an annual fair, and Henry VI allowed three annual fairs, on the Nativity of Mary and the Deposition and Translation of St John of Bridlington in 1446. In 1415 Henry V visited the Priory to give thanks for victory at the Battle of Agincourt.

After the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the manor of Bridlington remained with the Crown until 1624, when Charles I passed it to Sir John Ramsey, who had recently been created Earl of Holderness. In 1633, Sir George Ramsey sold the manor to 13 inhabitants of the town, on behalf of all the manor tenants. In May 1636, a deed was drawn up empowering the 13 men as Lords Feoffees or trust holders of the Manor of Bridlington.

===Corn, breweries and wars===

The town began to grow in importance and size around the site of the dispersed priory. In 1643 Queen Henrietta Maria of France landed there with troops to support the Royalist cause in the English Civil War, before moving on to York, which became her headquarters.

The town was originally two settlements: the Old Town about inland and the Quay area where the modern harbour lies. In 1837, an Act of Parliament enabled the wooden piers to be replaced with two stone piers to the north and south. Apart from landing fish, the port was used to transport corn: the 1826 Corn Exchange can still be seen in Market Place. There used to be mills in the town for grinding it, which led to some breweries starting up locally.

In the Second World War, Bridlington suffered several air raids that caused deaths and much bomb damage. The Royal Air Force had training schools in the town collectively known as RAF Bridlington, with one unit, No. 1104 Marine Craft Unit, continuing until 1980. Like most industry, these had petered out by the late 20th century.

Decline in the popularity of seaside tourism in the 1960s, reduced the number of pleasure steamers working from the harbour. By the end of the decade, just three were operating.

==Governance==

Bridlington is within the unitary authority of the East Riding of Yorkshire. Its three wards are Bridlington North, Bridlington South and Bridlington Old Town and Central, returning eight councillors out of 67. The civil parish consists of the town of Bridlington and the villages of Bessingby and Sewerby. It is run by a town council of twelve councillors, of which the three wards each return four.

The Town Council coat of arms is described as: &quot;Per Sable and Argent three Gothic Capital letters B counterchanged on a Chief embattled of the second two Barrulets wavy Azure and for the Crest Issuant from a Coronet composed of eight Roses set upon a rim of a Sun rising Gules.&quot; with the motto:&quot;Signum Salutis Semper&quot; meaning &quot;Always the bringer of good health&quot;.

Bridlington lies in the large Bridlington and The Wolds parliamentary constituency that covers the mostly rural, northern part of the county, including the towns of Driffield, Market Weighton and Pocklington. Its size and shape correspond to the East Yorkshire/North Wolds District under the earlier county of Humberside.

The town has been subject to several changes in parliamentary representation. From 1290 to 1831 it was part of the large Yorkshire constituency, sending two members until 1826, when it gained an additional two. Thereafter it was part of the East Riding of Yorkshire constituency until 1885, returning two members. Further reform reduced the boundaries again, to a single-member Buckrose seat until 1950. From 1950 to 1997, Bridlington had its own MP, until reform extended the boundary to include more countryside, as the single-seat East Yorkshire constituency.

Bridlington was designated a municipal borough in 1899. Local government reorganisation in 1974 included it in the new county of Humberside, which caused resentment among residents against being excluded from Yorkshire. The town became the administrative centre of a local government district, initially called the Borough of North Wolds but later changed to the Borough of East Yorkshire. The district disappeared when the county of Humberside was abolished in the 1990s, the new East Riding of Yorkshire unitary authority absorbing it and the neighbouring county districts, and Bridlington no longer having any formal local-government administrative status above town-council level.

==Geography==
Bridlington lies north-north-east of Beverley, south-east of Scarborough, north-east of Driffield and north of Kingston upon Hull, the principal city in the county. It is north of London. The height above sea level ranges from the beaches to on Bempton Lane on the outskirts. The Gypsey Race river flows through the town, the last being below ground from the Quay Road Car Park. The solid geology of the area is mainly from the Cretaceous period, consisting of Chalk overlain by Quaternary Boulder clay. The chalk is exposed as the land rises to the north of the town, where a cliff, probably formed in the last interglacial, extends inland at right angles to the present sea cliff, and forms the promontory of Flamborough Head.

Bridlington is in an area said to have the highest coastal erosion rate in Europe. Southwards the coast becomes low, but northwards it is steep and very fine, where the great spur of Flamborough Head projects eastwards. The sea front is guarded by a sea wall and a wide beach with wooden groynes to trap the sand. Offshore, the Smithic Sands sandbank stretches out into the bay, as an important habitat for many marine species. Bridlington north and south beaches have won EU environmental quality awards over the years.
===Areas of the town===

===Climate===
The climate is temperate with warm summers and cool, wet winters. The hottest months are from June to September, with temperatures reaching an average high of and falling to at night. The average daytime temperatures in winter are in the day and at night.
==Demography==

The religious affiliations were 77 per cent Christian, 0.14 per cent Buddhist, 0.03 per cent Jewish, 0.196 per cent Hindu, 0.04 per cent Sikh, 0.22 per cent other, and the rest, over 22 per cent stating no religion or not declaring one. The ethnic make-up was 98.7 per cent White, 0.43 per cent Mixed, 0.08 per cent Black/Black British, 0.19 per cent Chinese/Other Ethnic and 0.49 per cent Asian/British Asian. There were 16,237 dwellings.

===2011 census===

There were 17,827 dwellings.

==Economy==

From the early history of Bridlington, a small fishing port grew up near the coast, later known as Bridlington Quay. After the discovery of a chalybeate spring, the Quay developed in the 19th century into a seaside resort. Bridlington&#x27;s first hotel was opened in 1805 and it soon became a popular resort with industrial workers from the West Riding of Yorkshire. A new railway station opened on 6 October 1846 between the Quay and the historic town. The area round it was developed and the two areas of the town were combined.

Bridlington&#x27;s popularity declined along with the industrial parts of the north and the rising popularity of cheap foreign holidays. Although the fishing fleet also declined, the port remains popular with sea anglers for trips along the coast or further out to local shipwrecks. Bridlington has lucrative shellfish exports to France, Spain and Italy, said to be worth several million pounds a year.

==Culture and community==
The town is served by the Bridlington-based monthly Bridlington Echo newspaper, Scarborough-based weekly &quot;Bridlington Free Press&quot; and the &quot;East Riding Mail&quot; in Hull. 

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Humberside, Hits Radio East Yorkshire &amp; North Lincolnshire, Nation Radio East Yorkshire, Capital Yorkshire, Greatest Hits Radio Yorkshire Coast, This is The Coast and Bridlington Gold Radio, a community based station. 

Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire and ITV Yorkshire. Television signals are received from the Belmont TV transmitter. 

Jake Thackray&#x27;s song &quot;The Hair of the Widow of Bridlington&quot; mocks Bridlington for the ostensible small-mindedness of its inhabitants.

There are three main parks. Queen&#x27;s Park is a small open area at the junction of the B1254 and Queensgate. Westgate Park is a mostly wooded area between Westgate and the A165 on the outskirts of the town. The largest open area is Duke&#x27;s Park, between Queensgate and the railway line. It hosts Bridlington Sports and Community Club, a skate park and Bridlington Town Football Club. In addition, there is a Sports Centre on the outskirts, in Gypsey Road, with a general-purpose sports hall, a gymnasium and squash courts. In January 2014, Bridlington Leisure World on the Promenade, with its swimming facilities, gymnasium and indoor bowling rinks, closed for redevelopment. A temporary Olympic legacy pool was opened by Jo Jackson in January 2014 at the Bridlington Sports Centre on Gypsey Road, while Leisure World was rebuilt. The new centre opened on 23 May 2016, with an official opening on 1 July 2016 by Rebecca Adlington, Gail Emms and Dean Windass.

The town has a public library in King Street. Within the triangle of Station Avenue, Station Road and Quay Road are the Town Hall, Magistrates Court and several other government buildings. On South Marine Drive there is an RNLI Life Boat Station. There has been a life boat since 1805, manned wholly by volunteers. It received a new Shannon-class lifeboat in 2018, with some redevelopment to accommodate it.

Close to the A165/A614 junction is Bridlington Hospital and the Ambulance Station. On the opposite side, closer to the town centre, is the fire station, established in 1960, with a mix of full-time and on-call crew. There is a post office and depot not far from the level crossing in Quay Road.

===Town crier===

David Hinde, who lived in the nearby village of Bempton and was a member of the Ancient and Honourable Guild of Town Criers and the Loyal Company of Town Criers, was appointed in the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee Year of 2012 by Bridlington Town Council. He was the first town crier in Bridlington since 1901. On 23 July 2013 Hinde gave a special proclamation outside Bridlington Priory, before a visit from Prince Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles as part of the special &quot;Priory 900&quot; celebrations.

On 17 August 2013, at the town&#x27;s Sewerby Park, Hinde&#x27;s cry was recorded at 114.8 decibels. He appeared as the Walmington-on-Sea town crier in the 2016 film &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;.

==Landmarks==
Bridlington Priory, also known as the Priory Church of St Mary, is a Grade I listed building named after the Augustinian Priory on which it was built. It was once fortified; the Bayle (gate) nearby is what remains of that fortification and also a Grade I listed building. It has a ring of eight bells (tenor c. 24 cwt, 05 t) with a long draft. It also has a large four-manual organ that boasts the widest &quot;scaled&quot; 32-foot reed (contra tuba) in the United Kingdom. Bridlington&#x27;s war memorial is located in a triangular patch of garden at the junction of Prospect Street and Wellington Road. It was unveiled on 10 July 1921 by Captain S. H. Radcliffe, C. M. G., R. N.

Bridlington Cemetery in Sewerby Road dates from the 19th century and includes 73 Commonwealth War Graves. The Grade II listed Gothic cemetery chapels, gatehouse and lodge were built in 1869 by the architect Alfred Smith of Nottingham.

Bridlington Spa opened in 1896, when Bridlington in its heyday was a leading entertainment resort and a nationally famous dance venue, where many well-known entertainers appeared, including David Bowie and Morrissey. By 2005 the condition of the building had deteriorated to a point where East Riding of Yorkshire Council had to undertake a thorough refurbishment in 2006–2008. It has since begun to attract well-known names again: in 2013 indie rock bands the Kaiser Chiefs and Kasabian, Irish band The Script and Joe McElderry all performed there.

In 2014 blue plaques went up for Herman Darewski, composer and conductor of light music, and Wallace Hartley, leader of the orchestra playing as the Titanic sank. Hartley had led an orchestra in the town in 1902. Darewski was musical director for the town in 1924–1926 and 1933–1939.

Brindlington has several notable public artworks along the seafront. &#x27;Promenade&#x27; by Bruce McLean and Mel Gooding with architects Bauman Lyon runs the length of the South Foreshore and encompasses beach huts, a metal sculpture and public showers as well as a nautical mile of text that references aspects of the locale. It was completed in 1998 and won the RIBA &#x27;Building of the Year&#x27;.

==Transport==

Bridlington is served by a railway station on the Yorkshire Coast Line between Hull and Scarborough. It opened on 6 October 1846 between the Quay and the Old Town.

East Yorkshire Motor Services has a depot, running nine local and six out-of-town bus routes, including York, Scarborough, Driffield, Beverley and Hull. The company operates a summer Beachcomber open-top bus service in Bridlington. Yorkshire Coastliner runs a service to Filey, Malton, York, Tadcaster and Leeds.

The town lies at the junction of two trunk roads: the A165 between Hull and Scarborough and the A614 between Bridlington and Nottingham. The A614 was extended in 1996 to include the length previously known as the A166 to York.

Four land trains run in Bridlington: the Yorkshire Rose, Yorkshire Lass and Yorkshire Lad and the Spalight Express. Two run on the North Promenade between Leisure World and Sewerby Hall and Gardens linking Bridlington town centre with the summer car parks. One runs on the South Promenade linking Bridlington town centre to the park and ride and South Cliff Caravan Park. In the 1970s and 1980s there were two other trains — the Burlington Bertie and Bridlington Belle.

==Education==

===Further and higher education===
East Riding College provides tertiary education for students from 16. Located in St Mary&#x27;s Walk, it is close to Bay Primary School. Courses cover both academic and vocational subjects.

==Health service==
All six GP practices closed their lists to new patients in 2016 due to problems with premises and staff shortages. The town has an elderly population, which adds to demand. In May 2018 they were obliged by NHS England to reopen their lists, but there was no funding for a proposed Health and Wellbeing Centre, which was to have housed five surgeries. In October 2022 it was announced that three of the five practices would be closed because of challenges recruiting and retaining staff. Two larger practices, Humber Primary Care and Practice Three will take over and each serve around 19,000 patients.

==Religious sites==
The main Anglican place of worship is the Priory Church of St Mary in Church Green. Christ Church in Quay Road, next to the war memorial, was built in 1841 by Gilbert Scott. Originally a chapel of ease, it became a parish church in 1871 and is now a Grade II listed building. Emmanuel Church in Cardigan Road is a modern red-brick building, also part of the Church of England.

The Harbourside Evangelical Church stands in a side road off Bridge Street. The Kingdom Hall of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses is in Station Avenue. The Cornerstone Church, once known as &quot;The Chapel Hall&quot;, is an Evangelical Church in St John&#x27;s Walk. There has been a Baptist church in the town since 1698, the current place of worship being on the corner of Quay Road and Portland Place. On the corner of St John Street and Brett Street is the Free Presbyterian Church. The independent Evangelical Church in Ferndale Terrace is called Calvary Chapel by the Sea.

The strong Methodist Church presence in the town since 1770 is covered in various locations. St John&#x27;s Burlington Methodist Church in St John&#x27;s Street remains. The chapel in the Promenade lasted from 1852 until 1957 as part of the United Methodist Free Church. The Primitive Methodists established a chapel in St John Street in 1833, but moved to a nearby location in 1849. This in turn was rebuilt in 1877 and lasted until 1970. The Primitive Methodists also had a chapel known as the Central Methodist Church on the Quay in 1833. It moved to Chapel Street in 1870 and built itself larger premises there in 1878. In 1969 it joined with the Chapel Street Methodist Church, which was in existence in 1810 in what was originally Back Street. This was rebuilt in 1873 and lasted until 1999, when it became the final Methodist congregation to unite with the present church.

The Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady and St Peter stands in Victoria Road. The Catholics had long lacked a permanent mission in the town. A previous 1886 building in Wellington Road had not provided sufficient space when a mission was eventually granted. Modern premises were built in 1893–1894 by Arthur Lowther. The church hall adjacent was added in 1963. The connection to the sea is evident on the dedication to Our Lady, also known as the &quot;Star of the Sea&quot;, and to St Peter, &quot;Patron Saint of Fishermen&quot;. The convent in the High Street is associated with the church and though now run by the Sisters of Mercy, was originally Dominican.

<text>George Washington De Long (August 22, 1844 – ) was a United States Navy officer and explorer who led the ill-fated &quot;Jeannette&quot; expedition of 1879–1881, in search of the Open Polar Sea.

== Career ==

=== &quot;Jeannette&quot; expedition ===

In 1879, backed by James Gordon Bennett Jr.—owner of the &quot;New York Herald&quot;—and under the auspices of the United States Navy, Lieutenant Commander De Long sailed from San Francisco on the ship with a plan to find a way to the North Pole via the Bering Strait. As well as collecting scientific data and animal specimens, De Long discovered three islands and claimed them for the United States in the summer of 1881. The government did not endorse this claim, and the islands are under Russian jurisdiction.

The ship became trapped in the ice pack in the Chukchi Sea northeast of Wrangel Island in September 1879. It drifted in the ice pack in a northwesterly direction until it was crushed in the shifting ice and sank on , in the East Siberian Sea. De Long and his crew then traversed the ice pack to try to reach Siberia pulling three small boats.

After reaching open water on September 11 they became separated and one boat, commanded by Executive Officer Charles W. Chipp, was lost; no trace of it was ever found. De Long&#x27;s own boat reached land, but only two men sent ahead for aid survived. The third boat, under the command of Chief Engineer George W. Melville, reached the Lena Delta and its crew were rescued. Melville later found and brought to the U.S. the ships log books which now sit in the U.S. National Archives.

== Death ==
De Long died of starvation near Matvay Hut, Yakutia. Melville returned a few months later and found the bodies of De Long and his boat crew. Overall, the doomed voyage took the lives of 20 expedition members, as well as additional men lost during the search operations. De Long&#x27;s death – and that of the other men – was assumed to have occurred at or about the end of October. By direction of the United States government, the remains of De Long and his companions were brought home and interred with honour in his native city.

=== Legacy ===
In 1890, the officers and men of the United States Navy dedicated the Jeannette Monument, a granite-and-marble monument designed by George P. Colvocoresses—a cross with carved icicles hanging from it that sits atop a cairn. The -high structure is in the United States Naval Academy Cemetery overlooking the Severn River.

His journal, in which he made regular entries up to the day on which he died, was edited by his wife and published in 1883 under the title &quot;Voyage of the &quot;Jeannette&quot;&quot;, and an account of the search which was made for him and his comrades by Melville was published a year later under the title of &quot;In the Lena Delta&quot;.

Union veterans in the Kingdom of Hawai‘i on September 23, 1882, named the post of the Grand Army of the Republic there after him.

Two United States Navy ships have been named USS DeLong after George W. De Long. In addition to the De Long Islands, the De Long Mountains in northwest Alaska, The De Long Strait separating Wrangel Island from mainland Eurasia and the De Long Fjord in Greenland bear his name.

<text>The Burlington Bees are a collegiate summer baseball team of the Prospect League. They are located in Burlington, Iowa, and have played their home games at Community Field since 1947. Founded in 1889, the Bees played in Minor League Baseball&#x27;s Midwest League from 1962 to 2020. With Major League Baseball&#x27;s reorganization of the minor leagues after the 2020 season, Burlington was not selected to continue in affiliated baseball.

The team was first known as the &quot;Bees&quot; from 1924 to 1932 and again from 1954 to 1981. The Bees nickname was revived for the 1993 season and remains to this day.

Baseball Hall of Fame inductees Billy Williams, Paul Molitor and Larry Walker played for Burlington.

The Bees play in the Prospect League&#x27;s Western Conference – Northwest Division along with the Clinton LumberKings, Illinois Valley Pistol Shrimp, and Springfield Lucky Horseshoes.

== History ==
The team began playing in Burlington in 1889 as the Burlington Babies. Teams with various nicknames played until the Burlington Pathfinders were named in 1906, keeping the nickname until 1916 and playing in the Central Association. After a hiatus, the Burlington Bees played in the Mississippi Valley League from 1924 to 1932. The franchise then returned as the Burlington Indians in 1947, the same year that their current stadium, Community Field, opened. They won the league championship in 1949, their third and final year in the Central Association. The team joined the Three-I (Illinois, Iowa, Indiana) League in 1952 as the Burlington Flints but was renamed the Bees in 1954. In 1958, Billy Williams played 61 games with the Bees before joining the Cubs. Burlington joined the Midwest League in 1962 as a farm team of the Pittsburgh Pirates. From 1963 through 1974 they were a farm team of the Kansas City (later Oakland) A&#x27;s; subsequent affiliations included the Brewers (1975–81), Rangers (1982–85), Expos (1986–87 and 1993–94), Braves (1988–90), Astros (1991–92), Giants (1995–96), Reds (1997–98), and White Sox (1999–2000).

The Bees have won the Midwest League Championship four times, in four different decades: 1965 (won both halves), 1977 (defeated Waterloo Indians), 1999 (defeated Wisconsin Timber Rattlers) and 2008 (defeated South Bend Silver Hawks).

Catcher Herbert Whitney of the Burlington Pathfinders was killed by a pitched ball in 1906. On June 26 in Waterloo, Iowa, Whitney was beaned by a pitch from Fred Evans of the Waterloo Microbes. He suffered a skull fracture and died that day as a result.

The team was first known as the Bees from 1924 to 1932 and again from 1954 to 1981. Starting in 1982, they used the nickname of their major league parent club, before the current Bees nickname was revived for the 1993 season.

In addition to Baseball Hall of Famers Billy Williams, Paul Molitor and Larry Walker, many former Burlington players have enjoyed major league success including: Sal Bando, Vida Blue (who struck out a team-record 231 batters in 1968), George Hendrick, Phil Garner, Chet Lemon, Claudell Washington, Rubén Sierra, Kenny Rogers, José Vidro, Ugueth Urbina, Javy López, Mark Buehrle, Mike Moustakas, and Salvador Pérez. Over 100 former Bees have played in the majors.

In 2007, the Bees changed their logo and uniforms. Since 2000, the Bees have had three affiliates: the Kansas City Royals (2001–10), Oakland Athletics (2011–12), and the Los Angeles Angels (2013–2020).

Following the 2020 season, the Bees were cut from the Midwest League and affiliated baseball as part of Major League Baseball&#x27;s reorganization of the minor leagues. They later joined the Prospect League, a collegiate summer baseball league, for 2021.

==Ballpark==
The Bees have called historic Community Field, nicknamed &quot;the hive&quot;, their home since 1947. The original grandstand portion of the stadium was destroyed in a 1971 fire and rebuilt. The stadium was upgraded again prior to the 2004 season, including a revamped concessions area, partial covering of the grandstand, improved sound system, and a new scoreboard. Named the 2013 &quot;Field of the Year&quot; in the state of Iowa by the Iowa Sports Turf Management Association, capital improvements are supported by The Friends of Community Field, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.

<text>Avigliana (; ; ) is a town and (municipality) in the Metropolitan City of Turin in the Piedmont region of Italy, with 12,129 inhabitants as of 1 January 2023. It lies about west of Turin in the Susa valley, on the motorway going from Turin to Modane, France.

It is best known for two maar lakes, Lago Grande and Lago Piccolo. Also nearby is the massive Sacra di San Michele.

==History==

In 574, the Lombard King Cleph built a castle here. According to some sources, the battle between the Franks of Pippin the Younger and the Lombards of Aistulf occurred nearby in 750. Later Avigliana depended on the Abbey of Novalesa, and subsequently, it was a possession of the House of Savoy.

Avigliana was captured by Emperor Henry VI in 1187, but later it was acquired by Thomas I of Savoy. In 1536, in the course of the Italian Wars, it was again stormed by French troops. French attacks repeated in 1630 and 1690, the latter ending with the destruction of the castle.

==Main sights==

* Ruins of the castle, destroyed in the seventeenth century by the French.
* Church of &quot;San Giovanni&quot;, with several works by Defendente Ferrari.
* The Romanesque church of &quot;San Pietro&quot;.
* Natural Park of the Lakes of Avigliana.

==Transportation==
Avigliana has two exits on the A32 Bardonecchia-Turin motorway. It has also a station on the Turin-Modane railroad.

==Twin towns==
* Tresserve, France
* Oualia, Mali
* Sevan, Armenia

<doc id="350337" wikidata="Q5134184" url="?curid=350337" title="Clinton LumberKings">
<text>The Clinton LumberKings are a collegiate summer baseball team of the Prospect League. They are located in Clinton, Iowa, and play their home games at NelsonCorp Field. From 1956 to 2020, they were members of Minor League Baseball&#x27;s Midwest League. With Major League Baseball&#x27;s reorganization of the minor leagues after the 2020 season, Clinton was not selected to continue in affiliated baseball.

The LumberKings play in the Prospect League&#x27;s Western Conference – Northwest Division along with the Burlington Bees, Illinois Valley Pistol Shrimp, and Springfield Lucky Horseshoes.

==Clinton baseball history==
After beginning play in 1895, Clinton had sporadic teams in various leagues over the next few decades, as the Great Depression, World War I and World War II affected many baseball franchises. However, Clinton joined the Midwest League in 1956 and is now the oldest franchise in the league. The team has had several different major league affiliations: the Brooklyn Dodgers (1937–38), New York Giants (1939–41), Chicago Cubs (1947–49), Pirates (1954–58 and 1966–68), White Sox (1959–65), Pilots/Brewers (1969–70), Tigers (1971–75), Tigers/White Sox co-op (1976), Dodgers (1977–79), Giants (1980–94), Padres (1995–98), Reds (1999–2000), Expos (2001–02), and Rangers (2003–08), and Mariners (2009–18). In September 2018, they entered into a two-year player development contract with the Miami Marlins.

Aside from its time as the C-Sox (1960–65) and the Pilots (1966–76), the team used the parent major league team&#x27;s nickname before adopting the LumberKings name for the 1994 season.

The 2010 LumberKings season was the subject of the 2013 book &quot;Class A: Baseball in the Middle of Everywhere&quot; by Lucas Mann.

In 2016, led by first year manager Mitch Canham, the LumberKings won 86 games to set the mark for most in a regular season by any team in Clinton franchise history. The squad went on to sweep the Peoria Chiefs in the first round of the playoffs before defeating the Cedar Rapids Kernels in a thrilling three-game series. Game three of the Western Division final ended with a Ricky Eusebio walk off hit to win 1–0 in extra innings. The LumberKings would fall, however, in the Midwest League Championship in four games to the Great Lakes Loons.

In addition to playing host to the franchise record setting LumberKings (86-54), the LumberKings transformed their ballpark overnight following game two of the Midwest League Championship to become a football field. The LumberKings played host to Camanche High School Football in the inaugural &quot;LumberBowl.&quot; Camanche hosted Williamsburg High School in the game on September 16, 2016. The Raiders of Williamsburg defeated the Indians 55–7.

Following the 2020 season, the LumberKings were cut from the Midwest League and affiliated baseball as part of Major League Baseball&#x27;s reorganization of the minor leagues. They later joined the Prospect League, a collegiate summer baseball league, for 2021.

==NelsonCorp Field==
The home park for the LumberKings is NelsonCorp Field in Clinton, Iowa. The stadium was built in 1937 as a Works Progress Administration (WPA) project and named Riverview Stadium, due to its location on the banks of the Mississippi River. It was renamed Alliant Energy Field in 2002 and renovated in 2005–2006 to a capacity of 4,000. It was renamed to Ashford University Field in 2011 and NelsonCorp Field in 2019. The Dimensions are: LF – 330, CF – 401, RF – 325.

<text>Mengham is the largest settlement on Hayling Island in Hampshire, England. It is the largest shopping area on the island, and has three schools and a library. There is a church, St Mary&#x27;s, in the north of the settlement.

There is said to be an entrance to a tunnel in St Mary&#x27;s churchyard, disguised as a grave. This tunnel allegedly goes down to the shore and in past times smugglers used it to bring contraband items into the mainland. The tunnel, found under the name &quot;Mary Gritt&#x27;s&quot; leads around 1/2 a mile underground.

* December 14 – Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen and a team of four become the first people to reach the South Pole.

==Mathematics==
* Robert Remak&#x27;s doctoral dissertation &quot;&quot; establishes that any two decompositions of a finite group into a direct product are related by a central automorphism.
* Traian Lalescu publishes &quot;Introduction to the Theory of Integral Equations&quot;, the first ever monograph on the subject of integral equations.

==Medicine==
* Eugen Bleuler expands on his definition of schizophrenia as a condition distinct from &quot;Dementia praecox&quot;, in &quot;Dementia Praecox oder Gruppe der Schizophrenien&quot;.

==Physics==
* April 8 – Heike Kamerlingh Onnes discovers the phenomenon of superconductivity.
* June 24–30 – Domenico Pacini runs a series of measurements of underwater ionization in the Gulf of Genoa, demonstrating that the radiation later recognised as cosmic rays cannot be originated by the Earth&#x27;s crust.
* October – The first Solvay Congress of physicists convenes.
* Ernest Rutherford explains the Geiger–Marsden experiment and derives the Rutherford cross section by deducing the existence of a compact atomic nucleus from scattering experiments. He proposes the Rutherford model of the atom and demonstrates that J. J. Thomson&#x27;s plum pudding model is incorrect.
* Charles Wilson finishes a sophisticated cloud chamber.

==Psychology==
* The Ponzo illusion, a geometrical-optical illusion, is first demonstrated by Italian psychologist Mario Ponzo.

<text>Billericay ( ) is a town and civil parish in the Borough of Basildon in Essex, England. It lies within the London Basin, east of the City of London. The town was founded in the 13th century by the Abbot of West Ham, in his Manor of Great Burstead.

During the Peasants’ Revolt of 1381, the Essex rebels were defeated in a battle with Richard II&#x27;s forces in the Battle of Billericay. In 1620 four local people were on board the Mayflower as it sailed to Massachusetts, to establish the first English settlement in what would become the north of the United States. The town has long taken a pride in this connection, and many businesses and other organisations use the name &quot;Mayflower&quot;, with the Town Council and other local organisations using it as their emblem.

==Toponym ==
The origin of the name Billericay is unclear. It was first recorded as &quot;Byllyrica&quot; in 1291. The urban settlement, which was within the manor and parish of Great Burstead, was one of many founded in the late 13th century in an already densely populated rural landscape. 
Several suggestions for the origin of the place name include:
* &quot;Villa Erica&quot; (Heather Villa), suggesting a Romano-British origin.
* &quot;bellerīca&quot;, a medieval Latin word meaning &#x27;dyehouse or tanhouse&#x27;.
* &quot;billers&quot;, a traditional name for watercress, for which Bilbrook in Somerset and Staffordshire are named. Watercress was farmed in Billericay springs during the 20th century.

Although the precise etymology of the name is not known, England has other places named Billerica:
* Billerica, Kent. A deserted town adjacent to the settlement of Court-up-Street by Port Lympne. Significantly this is adjacent to a Roman &quot;Saxon Shore&quot; fort as well as being on spring lines suitable for growing watercress.
* Billerica Farm, near Upton Noble, Somerset. Although this farm might be named after the other Billericas, the site is also close to springs suitable for farming watercress.

The Tudor antiquarian John Leland believed the already-abandoned Billerica in Kent was a variant of &quot;Bellocastrum&quot;, ‘fair castle’ in Latin. In Billericay there is a Roman fort at Blunt&#x27;s Wall Farm; likewise ‘Burh’ gives its name to Great Burstead.
This suggests that a Romano-British place name was reused by the Anglo-Saxons following the end of Roman rule in Britain.

==History==
===Early history===
Some of the earliest records of human occupation of Billericay are the burial mounds in Norsey Wood, showing evidence of occupation in the Bronze and Iron Ages. Evidence of a Roman town, subsequently abandoned, were found on the high ground at Billericay School, just south of the High Street during excavations in 1970–71. There may also have been a small cavalry fort at Blunts Wall Farm.

===Middle Ages===

The town of Billericay was established in the 13th century in the Manor and Parish of Great Burstead. The Manor of &quot;Burgestede&quot; is first recorded in an Anglo-Saxon will of 975 AD. In the Domesday Book of 1086 it is recorded as Burghestada. Great Burstead is recorded in the early 13th century, showing that the division into Great and Little Burstead Manors and Parishes had happened by that time.

The town of Billericay, first recorded as &quot;Byllyrica&quot; in 1291, is understood to have been founded in the 13th century by the Abbot of West Ham, head of the Cistercian community of Stratford Langthorne Abbey, twenty miles away on the Lower Lea, in what is now inner London. The Abbey held the Manor of Great Burstead at the time.

The town was established at the High Street. Like the abandoned Roman settlement just to the south, it benefitted from a prominent position on the high ground forming the watershed of the River Crouch and River Wid catchment areas. It was also on the crossroads (at Sun Corner) of the road from the Thames to Chelmsford (the modern B1007) and the road linking Hutton to Wickford (the A129); it is believed that the Crouch may have been navigable as far as Wickford at that time.

At this time, the parish church for Billericay was at St Mary Magdalene, Great Burstead. By the 14th century a chantry chapel had been built on the High Street in Billericay, which became a chapel of ease to Great Burstead following the Reformation, eventually becoming a parish church in 1844, also dedicated to St Mary Magdalen.
In the 13th and 14th centuries, some pilgrims to Canterbury journeyed via Billericay. Some of them may have spent the night in Billericay before crossing the River Thames at Tilbury. This may account for the large number of inns in the town.

Billericay&#x27;s most notable historical episode was the Battle of Billericay during the Peasants&#x27; Revolt of 1381.

===Tudor period===
The Wycliffe preachers influenced the town. Four local people (Thomas Watts, Joan Hornes, Elizabeth Thackwell and Margaret Ellis) were burnt at the stake. Two other residents (Joan Potter and James Harris) were tortured for their Protestant faith during the reign of Queen Mary.

===Pilgrim Fathers===
A meeting of the Pilgrim Fathers, prior to their sailing in the &quot;Mayflower&quot;, is said to have taken place in Billericay high street; many local names and much historical imagery reflect this, such as Mayflower House, Mayflower Morris Men, Mayflower Taxis, Mayflower School and Mayflower Hall. Sunnymede School&#x27;s houses were called Mayflower, Pilgrim, Chantry.

Christopher Martin, who was born in Great Burstead and later became a Billericay goods merchant and property owner, travelled on the &quot;Mayflower&quot; in 1620 as the official Ship&#x27;s Governor and purchasing agent, procuring ships supplies for the voyage.

The &quot;Mayflower&quot; ship set sail once the Pilgrim Fathers had all boarded and set to meet the Speedwell in the English Channel; the &quot;Speedwell&quot; was sailing from the Netherlands. Unfortunately the &quot;Speedwell&quot; developed leaks and so the ships headed for the Devon coast to repair her, but this proved impossible; the &quot;Mayflower&quot; eventually sailed from Plymouth without her.

Four people from Billericay were on board, including Christopher Martin, his wife Mary Prowe, along with Solomon Prowe - her son from her first marriage - and John Langemore - the Martins&#x27; servant. All four pilgrims perished after their arrival at Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Christopher Martin died of fever on 8 January 1621. His wife perished in Plymouth in 1621. Both Christopher and Mary are buried in the Cole Hill Burial ground in Plymouth. The unfortunate fate of the would-be pioneers did not deter other inhabitants of Billericay from setting sail for the New World. The town of Billerica, Massachusetts, was established in 1655 by colonists from Billericay and named after their hometown in England.

===Georgian and Victorian eras===

In the Georgian period many excellent examples of the period&#x27;s houses were built in Billericay. One of those remaining today is Burghstead Lodge in High Street, which used to house the library. The Town Hall was built in 1830 at 94 High Street.

The Billericay Poor Law Union was created in 1835 to serve the town and several surrounding parishes. It built a workhouse in 1840 on Norsey Road. Parts of this building were later incorporated into St Andrew&#x27;s Hospital.

The railway arrived in Billericay in 1889; the station is situated on a branch line from the Great Eastern Main Line between Shenfield and Southend-on-Sea.

===20th century===
In 1916, during the First World War, a German Zeppelin airship was shot down during an aerial battle over Billericay. During its fiery demise, it narrowly missed the High Street, crashing into a field off Greens Farm Lane. A plaque was erected at the site in 2016, to commemorate 100 years since the incident. 
Parts of the aluminium frame can be seen at the Cater Museum in Billericay High Street.
Recent research has indicated that this may be identified with the &#x27;ghost Zeppelin&#x27; of Tonbridge which was allegedly seen floating over that town earlier in the day.

The former workhouse became St Andrew&#x27;s Hospital, which housed the internationally renowned Regional Plastic Surgery and Burns unit from 1973 until this was relocated to Broomfield Hospital, Chelmsford in April 1998. After the relocation, most of the hospital was redeveloped into housing, with the listed old workhouse buildings being converted to residential use.

==Geography==

===Open spaces===
Billericay has two main parks, Lake Meadows and the &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2nd Playing Field&quot; (usually known as &quot;Sun Corner&quot;). The other urban open spaces are much smaller.

There are several open spaces on the urban edge; the mixed use park at &quot;Hannakins Farm&quot; to the north-west includes a number of playing fields, &quot;Queens Park Country Park&quot;, also to the north-west, is managed as a nature reserve, as is Norsey Wood and Mill Meadows on the eastern side of the town. Norsey Wood and Mill Meadows act as &#x27;green wedges&#x27; in that they extend from the open countryside to the centre of town.

Both Mill Meadows and Norsey Wood are environmentally valuable and sensitive, and have, in part or whole, been designated as Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) as a result. Mill Meadows is a local nature reserve near the centre of Billericay. Centuries of grazing have created the ideal conditions for a wonderful diversity of wild flowers, fungi, insects and invertebrates, many of which are very rare. It contains an area of 16.63 acres (6.73 ha) that has been declared as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) for its unimproved neutral grassland.

===Neighbouring settlements===
Neighbouring settlements include Stock to the north, Ramsden Heath and Ramsden Bellhouse to the east, Basildon to the south, Little Burstead to the south-west and Havering&#x27;s Grove to the west.

===Geology===
Billericay is within the London Basin and lies on a mixture of London clay, Claygate Beds and Bagshot Beds on the higher ground. The point where the soils change from sandy to impermeable clay creates springs.

==Governance==

There are three tiers of local government covering Billericay, at parish (town), district and county level: Billericay Town Council, Basildon Borough Council and Essex County Council. The town council has its headquarters at the Chantry Centre on Chantry Drive, which was purpose-built for the council in 2020 and also serves as a community centre. The town council has run a youth town council scheme since 1998, elected in schools around the town.

===Administrative history===
Billericay was historically a chapelry in the ancient parish of Great Burstead. The Billericay Poor Law Union created in 1835 gradually took on local government powers, becoming a rural sanitary district in 1872 which in turn became the Billericay Rural District in 1894, when a Great Burstead Parish Council was also created covering the parish which included the town. The rural district covered a large area stretching as far as Brentwood and Pitsea. In 1934 most of the rural district was reconstituted as Billericay Urban District and the parish councils within the area were abolished. Three years later all the urban parishes within the district were united into a civil parish of Billericay.

The urban district, but not the parish, was renamed Basildon in 1955, although the council continued to be based at the Town Hall and adjoining offices in Billericay until the early 1960s when it moved into new premises in Basildon itself. In 1974 the Basildon Urban District was reconstituted as the modern Basildon district and the civil parish of Billericay was abolished, becoming an unparished area. A new civil parish of Billericay was established in 1996, this time just covering the town itself rather than the whole Basildon district.

===Parliamentary===
Since major boundary changes in Essex for the 2010 general election, Billericay has been part of the parliamentary constituency of Basildon and Billericay. Since 2024 the MP has been Richard Holden of the Conservative Party.

==Transport==
Billericay is a part of the London commuter belt, with a high proportion of people working in the City and other central parts of London.

The town is served by Billericay railway station, which is on the Shenfield to Southend Line. Services between London Liverpool Street, Shenfield and Southend Victoria are operated by Greater Anglia; some trains in peak hours run to Southminster.

Local bus services are operated by First Essex, which connect Billericay with Chelmsford, Basildon, Brentwood and Wickford. The railway station bus stop connects to many routes, including service 300 which operates regularly between Basildon and Chelmsford. School services are provided by First Essex and NIBS Buses.

The town was established at the crossroads (at Sun Corner) of the roads now known as the B1007 (higher grade parts of which are designated the A176) and A129.

The B1007 provides a road link to Basildon to the south of Billericay, as well as to the A127. The road passes from just south of the town centre as Laindon Road, then the A129 junction at Sun Corner, continues northwards as Billericay&#x27;s High Street and then Stock Road. It continues north to Chelmsford. Along its route is the village of Stock and an interchange to the A12.

The A129 links the town to nearby areas such as Brentwood to the west and Wickford to the east.

The nearest primary routes are the A12 to the north and the A127 in the south.

The Cater Museum, a charity, is a local history museum containing artefacts recording the lives of people in the area. It is housed in an 18th and 19th-century Grade II listed building on the High Street.

The Billericay Community Archive strives to record photos, memories and history relating to the town and surrounding areas on their website.

Billericay&#x27;s commercial cinema &quot;The Ritz&quot; closed its doors in 1971. However, in 2015, the Billericay Community Cinema was established.

<text>The League of Prizren (), officially the League for the Defense of the Rights of the Albanian Nation (), was an Albanian political organization that was officially founded on June 10, 1878 in the old town of Prizren in the Kosovo Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire. It was suppressed in April 1881.

The Treaties of San Stefano and Berlin assigned areas inhabited by Albanians to other states. The inability of the Porte to protect the interests of a region that was 70 percent Muslim and largely loyal forced Albanian leaders to organize their own defence and to consider the creation of an autonomous administration, as Serbia and the other Danubian Principalities had enjoyed before their independence.

The league was established at a meeting of 47 Ottoman beys. The initial position of the league was presented in the document known as Kararname. With that document, Albanian leaders emphasized their intention to establish autonomy within the Ottoman Empire by supporting the Porte and &quot;to struggle in arms to defend the wholeness of the territories of Albania&quot;. The document said nothing explicitly about reforms, schools, autonomy or the union of the Albanian population within one vilayet, but under the influence of Abdyl Frashëri, that initial position changed radically and resulted in demands for an independent Albanian state and open war against the Ottoman Empire.

== Background ==

The 1877–78 Russo-Turkish War dealt a decisive blow to Ottoman power in the Balkan Peninsula, leaving the empire with only a precarious hold on Albania and the eastern Balkans. The Albanians&#x27; fear that the lands they inhabited would be partitioned among Montenegro, Serbia, Bulgaria, and Greece fueled the rise of resistance. The first postwar treaty, the abortive Treaty of San Stefano signed on March 3, 1878, assigned areas claimed by the League of Prizren to Serbia, Montenegro, and Bulgaria. Austria-Hungary and the United Kingdom blocked the arrangement because it awarded Russia a predominant position in the Balkans and thereby upset the European balance of power. A peace conference to settle the dispute was held later in the year in Berlin.

The overall situation influenced Albanians to organize themselves as the Local Councils for National Salvation with the aim to protect the Albanian populated lands. By the end of 1877 the issue of defending territorial integrity had become difficult. On December 13, 1877, the Serbs declared war on Ottoman Empire, as did Montenegro. Both were supported by the Russian Army and spread their attacks across the northern parts of Albania. The Albanians were unable to defend several regions and cities in the northeast and northwest of Albania. Upon occupation of these lands, the Ottoman administrators (of mainly Albanian origin) fled the territories and/or were expelled. During the Russo-Turkish war, the incoming Serb army expelled most of the Muslim Albanian population from the Toplica and Niš regions into Kosovo, triggering the emergence of what became the League of Prizren (1878–1881) as a response to the Great Eastern Crisis.

Influenced by these events the Local Councils for National Salvation merged into a single coordination body. The Albanians, on December 12, 1877 established in Istanbul the Central Committee for the Defense of Rights of the Albanian Nation.

The Treaty of San Stefano triggered profound anxiety among the Albanians and Bosniaks, and it spurred their leaders to organize a defense of the lands they inhabited. In the spring of 1877, influential Albanians in Constantinopleincluding Abdyl Frashëri, the Albanian national movement&#x27;s leading figure during its early yearsorganized a committee to direct the Albanians&#x27; resistance. In May the group called for a general meeting of representatives from all the areas where Albanian communities existed during that time. The Committee&#x27;s members were Ali Ibra, Zija Prishtina, Sami Frashëri, Jani Vreto, Vaso Pasha, Baca Kurti Gjokaj and Abdyl Frashëri.

== Meeting in Prizren ==
The League of Prizren was created by a group of Albanian intellectuals to resist partition among neighboring Balkan states and to assert an Albanian national consciousness by uniting Albanians into a unitary linguistic and cultural nation. During the meeting in Prizren a &quot;kararname&quot; was signed by 47 beys on June 18, 1878. The document represented an initial position, mainly supported by landlords and individuals related to the Ottoman administration. In Article 1 of this document, these Albanian leaders restated their intention to preserve and maintain the territorial integrity of the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans by supporting the Porte and &quot;to struggle in arms to defend the wholeness of the territories of Albania&quot;. Article 6 of the same document restated the hostility of the Albanians to the independence of both Bulgaria and Serbia. &quot;We should not allow foreign armies to tread on our land. We should not recognize Bulgaria&#x27;s name. If Serbia does not leave peacefully the illegally occupied countries, we should send bashibazouks (akindjias) and strive until the end to liberate these regions, including Montenegro.&quot;

On the first meeting of the league the decision memorandum (&quot;kararname&quot;) said nothing explicitly about reforms, schools, autonomy or the union of the Albanian population within one vilayet. It was at first not an appeal for Albanian independence, or even autonomy within Ottoman Empire but, as proposed by Pashko Vasa, simply the unification of all claimed territory within one vilayet. The participants wanted to return to the status quo before the start of Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878. The main aim was to defend from immediate dangers. Soon that position changed radically and resulted in demands of autonomy and open war against the Ottoman Empire as formulated by Abdyl Frashëri.

== Berlin Congress ==

In July 1878, the 60 member board of the League of Prizren, led by Abdyl Bey Frashëri, sent a letter to the Great Powers at the Congress of Berlin, asking for the settling of Albanian issues resulting from the Turkish War. The memorandum was ignored by the congress, which recognized the competing claims of Serbia and Bulgaria to territories surrendered by the Ottoman Empire over those of the Albanians. The League of Prizren feared that the Albanians would not win in their claims to Epirus over Greece, and organized an armed resistance in Gusinje, Shkodra, Prizren, and Yanina. The San Stefano treaty was later superseded by the Treaty of Berlin at the insistence of Austria-Hungary and Britain. This latter treaty, however, recognized the rival claims of other nations in the region over those of the Albanians.

The Congress of Berlin ignored the memorandum from the league with German chancellor Otto von Bismarck even proclaiming that an Albanian nation did not exist and that Albania was &quot;just a geographic notion&quot;. Bismarck showed his disdain for excessive involvement in Balkan affairs, saying &quot;The whole Balkan is not worth the healthy bones of a single Pomeranian grenadier.&quot; The congress ceded to Montenegro the cities of Bar and Podgorica and areas around the mountain towns of Gusinje and Plav, which Albanian leaders considered Albanian territory. Serbia also gained some territory with an Albanian population. The latter, the vast majority of whom were loyal to the empire, vehemently opposed the territorial losses.

== Formation ==

On June 10, 1878, about eighty delegates, mostly Muslim religious leaders, clan chiefs, and other influential people from the Ottoman &quot;vilayets&quot; of Kosovo, Monastir and Yanina, met in the city of Prizren, (Kosova then Ottoman Empire). Around 300 Muslims participated on the assembly, including delegates from Bosnia and the mutasarrif (administrator of sanjak) of Prizren as representative of the central authorities, and no delegates from Scutari Vilayet. The delegates set up a standing organization, the League of Prizren, under the direction of a central committee that had the power to impose taxes and raise an army. The league of Prizren consisted of two branches: the Prizren and the southern branch. The Prizren branch was led by Iljas Dibra and it had representatives from the areas of Kırçova (Kicevo), Kalkandelen (Tetovo), Priştine (Prishtina), Mitroviça (Mitrovica), Vıçıtırın (Vushtrri), Üsküp (Skopje), Gilan (Gjilan), Manastır (Bitola), Debre (Debar) and Gostivar. The southern branch, led by Abdyl Frashëri consisted of sixteen representatives from the areas of Kolonjë, Korçë, Arta, Berat, Parga, Gjirokastër, Përmet, Paramythia, Filiates, Margariti, Vlorë, Tepelenë and Delvinë. In these regions the movement was primarily Muslim, due to the fact that most of the Orthodox population was under Greek influence. On the other hand, in the northern regions both Muslim and Catholic populations supported the objectives of the League of Prizren.

At first the Ottoman authorities supported the League of Prizren, but the Sublime Porte pressed the delegates to declare themselves to be first and foremost Ottomans rather than Albanians. Some delegates, led by Sheikh Mustafa Ruhi Efendi of Kalkandelen, supported this position and advocated emphasizing Muslim solidarity and the defense of Muslim lands, including present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina. This initial position of the league, based on the religious solidarity of the landlords and the people connected with the Ottoman administration and the religious authorities, was the reason for naming the league The Committee of the Real Muslims (). Other representatives, under Frashëri&#x27;s leadership, focused on working toward Albanian autonomy and establishing and Albanian state by creating a sense of Albanian identity that would cut across religious and tribal lines. The Ottoman state briefly supported the league&#x27;s claims viewing Albanian nationalism as possibly preventing further territorial losses to newly independent Balkan states.

== Military resistance ==

Failing to win their claims on a diplomatic level, Albanians embarked on the route of military conflict with their Balkan neighbors.

The Prizren League had 30,000 armed members under its control, who launched a revolution against the Ottoman Empire after the debacle at the Congress of Berlin and the official dissolution of the League ordered by the Ottomans who feared the League would seek total independence from the empire. The first military operation of the league was the attack against Mehmed Ali Pasha, the Ottoman marshal who would oversee the transfer of Plav-Gucia area to Montenegro. On December 4, 1879 members of the league participated in the Battle of Novšiće and defeated Montenegrin forces who tried to take control over Plav and Gusinje. After the breakout of open war the League took over control from the Ottomans in the Kosovo towns of Vushtrri, Peja, Mitrovica, Prizren and Gjakova. In 1880, northeastern Albanian delegates proposed creating an autonomous Albanian province, with Monastir or Ohrid as its capital, locally appointed officials, and partial revenue allocation to the Ottoman central government. This proposal, presented by the Prizren League to the sultan, was echoed in an October 1880 assembly in Dibra, which called for Albania&#x27;s unification. Prominent figures, including Xhemal Bey, Abdul Bey Frashëri, and Dervish Mustafa Efendi, worked to rally support and foster unity across northern and southern Albania.

In January 1881, Sulejman Vokshi of Gjakova led League troops in the capture of Skopje and Prishtina. In February, the League&#x27;s forces captured Dibra and forced the Ottoman administration to withdraw. Guided by the autonomous movement, the League rejected Ottoman authority and sought complete secession from the Porte. 

In August 1878, the Congress of Berlin ordered a commission to trace a border between the Ottoman Empire and Montenegro. The congress also directed Greece and the Ottoman Empire to negotiate a solution to their border dispute. The Albanians&#x27; successful resistance to the treaty forced the Great Powers to return Gusinje and Plav to the Ottoman Empire and grant Montenegro the mostly Albanian-populated coastal town of Ulcinj. There the Albanians refused to surrender. Finally, the Great Powers blockaded Ulcinj by sea and pressured the Ottoman authorities to bring the Albanians under control. Albanian diplomatic and military efforts were successful in wresting control of Epirus, however some lands were still ceded to Greece by 1881. The Great Powers decided in 1881 to cede Greece Thessaly and the district of Arta.

In areas like Kastoria, Prilep, Bitola and Veles where an Albanian population was present, the local Bulgarian movement of the day was defeated when armed Bulgarian groups were repelled by the League of Prizren who opposed Bulgarian geopolitical aims.

The Ottoman Empire sought to suppress the League and they dispatched an army led by Ottoman commander Dervish Pasha, that by April 1881 had captured Prizren and crushed the resistance at the Battle of Ulcinj. The leaders of the league and their families were either killed or arrested and deported.

== End of the league ==
Faced with growing international pressure to &quot;pacify&quot; the refractory Albanians, the sultan dispatched a large army under Dervish Turgut Pasha to suppress the League of Prizren and deliver Ulcinj to Montenegro. This culminated in conflict between the League and the innumerable forces of the Ottomans, particularly the Battle of Slivova, in which a small, poorly-armed force of Albanian resistance fighters were defeated by an Ottoman expeditionary force of 20 battalions, albeit not without great cost for the Ottomans. Albanians who were loyal to the empire supported the Sublime Porte&#x27;s military intervention. In April 1881, Dervish Pasha&#x27;s 10,000 men captured Prizren and later crushed the resistance at Ulcinj. The League of Prizren&#x27;s leaders and their families were arrested and deported. Frashëri, who originally received a death sentence, was imprisoned until 1885 and exiled until his death seven years later.

== Legacy ==

Formidable barriers frustrated Albanian leaders&#x27; efforts to instill in their people an Albanian rather than an Ottoman identity. Divided into four vilayets, Albanians had no common geographical or political nerve center. The Albanians&#x27; religious differences forced nationalist leaders to give the national movement a purely secular character that alienated religious leaders. The most significant factor uniting the Albanians, their spoken language, lacked a standard literary form and even a standard alphabet. Each of the three available choices, the Latin, Cyrillic, and Arabic scripts, implied different political and religious orientations opposed by one or another element of the population. In 1878 there were no Albanian-language schools in the most developed of the areas claimed by the League, Gjirokastër, Berat, and Vlorëwhere schools conducted classes either in Turkish or in Greek.

The League of Prizren was among the most obvious Albanian reactions to the dramatic withdrawal of the Albanians&#x27; imperial patrons, the Ottoman Empire, after almost four centuries of dominance in the Balkans. The aftermath of the Russo-Turkish war of 1878 produced the Treaty of San Stefano, which recognised the independence and/or territorial claims of Bulgaria, Montenegro and Serbia. After the Russo-Turkish war of 1877–1878. Albanian leaders from Peja, Gjakova, Gusinje, Luma, and from Debar and Tetovo met in Vardar Macedonia to discuss the development of what would only later be regarded as a national platform. The group of proto-nationalists received all manner of material and financial support from the Ottoman Empire, which was faced with the realities of having to withdraw yet again from its occupied territories in the Balkans. The League of Prizren received funding, the highest quality weaponry, and diplomatic support from the Porte, which established the Central Committee for Defending Albanian Rights in Constantinople in 1877.

== Aftermath ==
The Ottoman Empire continued to crumble after the Congress of Berlin and Sultan Abdül Hamid II resorted to repression to maintain order. The authorities strove without success to control the political situation in the empire&#x27;s Albanian-populated lands, arresting suspected nationalist activists. When the sultan refused Albanian demands for unification of the four Albanian-populated vilayets, Albanian leaders reorganized the League of Prizren and incited uprisings that brought the region, especially Kosovo, to near anarchy. During the twenty five years that followed the abolition of the league the various uprisings were local in character and occurred mostly in the northern regions and especially in the Vilayet of Kosovo. The imperial authorities disbanded a successor organisation, the League of Peja &quot;(Besa-Besë)&quot; founded in 1897, executed its president Haxhi Zeka in 1902, and banned Albanian-language books and correspondence. In Macedonia, where Bulgarian-, Greek-, and Serbian-backed guerrillas were fighting Ottoman authorities and one another for control, Muslim Albanians suffered attacks, and Albanian guerrilla groups retaliated. In 1905 Albanian leaders meeting in Monastir (Bitola) established the Secret Committee for the Liberation of Albania.

While it was active, the league managed to bring Albanian national interests before the Great Powers and paved the way for the League of Peja, which had greater foreign support from both Italy and the Austria-Hungarian Empire.

Despite it ultimate failure, the League of Prizren accomplished a great deal. Both Montenegro and Greece received less Albanian-claimed territory than they would have otherwise received without the organized protest. This was the first step toward a national organization.

<text>Felixstowe ( ) is a port town and civil parish in the East Suffolk district, in the county of Suffolk, England. The estimated population in 2017 was 24,521. The Port of Felixstowe is the largest container port in the United Kingdom. Felixstowe is approximately northeast of London.

==History==
There are competing theories as to how the name of Felixstowe arose. One is that the town is named after Felix of Burgundy, a saint and the first bishop of the East Angles in the seventh century, although this is unlikely as the name Felixstowe is not recorded for almost 900 years. An alternative etymology is from the Anglo-Saxon or Old English name &quot;Filicia&quot; and &quot;stōw&quot;, meaning a place of location. Literally Filicia&#x27;s place. The earliest recorded names &quot;Filchestou&quot; from 1254, and &quot;Filchestowe&quot; in 1291 support this idea. It is possible that the later reworking of Filicia/Filche was made with the intention of referencing Felix of Burgundy.

The old Felixstowe hamlet was centred on a pub and church, having stood on the site since long before the Norman conquest of England. The early history of Felixstowe, including its Roman, Anglo-Saxon, Norman and medieval defences, is told under the name of Walton, because the name Felixstowe was given retrospectively, during the 13th century, to a place which had expanded to a form beyond the boundaries of Walton alone. In the Domesday Book, for instance, only Walton is shown, and not Felixstowe, which at the time held little more than a few houses scattered over the cliff tops. Walton was a settlement on the River Orwell and in 1844 had a population of 907 compared to the relatively small Felixstowe Parish holding only 502 people. Walton had always preceded Felixstowe as a settlement as seen by the presence of Walton Castle, built by the Romans in the 3rd century, but today Walton is generally considered part of Felixstowe due to modern expansion.

Felixstowe is situated at the tip of the Colneis peninsula, and was in the ancient Colneis Hundred of Suffolk.

The Felixstowe area as a whole provided a linchpin in England&#x27;s defence, as proved in 1667 when Dutch soldiers landed near the Fludyers area and tried (unsuccessfully) in the Battle of Landguard Fort to capture Landguard Fort due to strategic location. The town only became related to a major port in 1886 when the port opened to trade, following the initial construction of the dock basin in 1882.

In 1810 or 1811 seven Martello Towers were built along the shore, of which 4 (Tower P on Wireless Green off Old Fort Road is the home of the local CoastWatch group, Q Tower in the town, and two more towards the Deben mouth) survive. Q Tower was the HQ of the Harwich-Ipswich-Martlesham Heath anti-aircraft guns between 1941 and 1945 (earlier it had been in Landguard Fort).

At the turn of the century, tourism increased, and a pier was constructed in 1905, some of which is partially functional to this day as an amusement arcade. Indeed, during the late Victorian period (after circa 1880) it became a fashionable resort, a trend initiated by the opening of Felixstowe Town railway station, the pier and a visit by the German imperial family in 1891.

It was in this buoyant period that Felixstowe was the first British town to adopt beach huts as stationary permanent structures (rather than wheeled bathing machines) and there are photographic records of beach huts at the &quot;spa area&quot; in Felixstowe dating back to 1895. It is therefore known as the home to British beach huts. Some of the beach huts in the spa area (a conservation area) date back to c.1900, so are probably the original beach huts. On the cliffs above this area sits Harvest House, which was built as The Felix Hotel in 1903, and was known as &quot;the millionaire&#x27;s hotel&quot;, because of the gentry and royal visitors it attracted. The Floral Hall was built in 1909, and subsequently became known as The Spa Pavilion. Felixstowe remained a fashionable seaside destination until the late 1930s.

In April 1914 as part of the suffragette bombing and arson campaign Bath Hotel, which was popular with elite visitors, was burnt down. 

Felixstowe played an important role in both world wars; in the first as Royal Naval Air Service and RAF seaplane base, and in the second as the Coastal Forces MTB, MGB and ML base HMS Beehive. Between the wars the seaplane station housed the RAF experimental establishment which tested seaplanes and flying boats. Its sheds and piers were incorporated in the MTB base and later the container port.

On 11 August 1919, the Felixstowe Fury sideslipped and crashed into the sea 500 yards offshore soon after take-off while on a test flight. It was preparing for an 8,000-mile flight to Cape Town, South Africa. The wireless operator, Lt. MacLeod, was killed, and the six passengers were rescued. The wreckage was towed ashore.

Wallis Simpson stayed in Felixstowe in 1936 in order to claim residence for her divorce from Ernest Simpson so that she could marry Edward VIII. The divorce and marriage sparked the abdication crisis in the same year.

Most of the south-western area of Felixstowe Urban District, between the Dock, Landguard Point, and Manor Road, was occupied by the Navy, RAF and Army. with Landguard Fort and several ruined gun emplacements and bunkers a reminder of the 1939–1945 era.

It was the first base from which Second World War German E-boats and coastal convoys were systematically attacked—by flotilla led by Lt-Commanders Howes, Dickens, Hichens and Trelawney. Felixstowe was also HQ of the Harwich Harbour coast and anti-aircraft defences, and accommodated the RAF&#x27;s 26th Marine Craft (Air-Sea Rescue) Unit.
In 1944 the piers near the Dock were used to load troops, tanks and vehicles onto the British and American landing craft of &quot;Force L&quot;, which reinforced the Normandy Invasion on its first and second days.

In 1945 the German naval commanders in Occupied Holland arrived in E-boats at Felixstowe Dock to surrender their boats and charts to the Royal Navy.

In 1953, at least 48 people died in the town during the North Sea flood.

In 1993 &#x27;Fast Eddie Maher&#x27;, a security van driver, stole £1.2m cash from outside Lloyds bank. He went on the run and was eventually arrested in 2012. 

===Landguard Fort===

Landguard Fort, originally known as Langer Fort, is on the site of the last opposed invasion of England in 1667, and the first land battle of the Duke of York and of Albany&#x27;s (later James II &amp; VII) Marines. The current fort was built in the 18th century, and modified in the 19th century with substantial additional 19th/20th century outside batteries. The Fort hosts regular military re-enactments, including Darell&#x27;s Day, which is a celebration of the last invasion, children&#x27;s events and open-air theatre.

In the two world wars the Fort was variously the HQ of the Harwich Harbour coast and anti-aircraft defences, the signal/control station for the harbour entrance, and a radio and radar station.

Landguard Fort is in the care of English Heritage, and is managed by the Landguard Fort Trust to make it accessible to the public.

===Museum===
A museum telling the story of Felixstowe, with a reference library, historic maps, photo archive and fourteen rooms of artefacts from Roman finds, the Martello towers, military social and domestic history through two world wars and into the new millennium is managed by volunteers from the Felixstowe History and Museum Society. It is located in the old submarine mining establishment building at the Landguard Peninsula, between the Fort and Port.

===Pier===

The pier was opened in 1906, rebuilt in late 2017, and re-opened in 2018. During the Second World War the majority of the pier, at the time one of the longest in the country and complete with its own train, was purposely demolished by the Royal Engineers to prevent it from being used as an easy landing point for enemy troops. After the war the damage was not repaired and the pier never regained its original length. The pier in its current incarnation features an amusement hall with a gambling section, traditional fish and chips and ice cream kiosks, and a restaurant/bar with indoor and outdoor seating. The deck spans the perimeter of the main building.

===Railway stations===
The sole remaining railway station , was opened in 1898. The well-preserved station building now houses a supermarket and shops.

In its prime the railway station saw more than twenty services a day and is now served by an hourly service to . The station now has only one platform, which has been created from the far end of one of the original platforms. Felixstowe Beach railway station was demolished in 2004, despite a storm of protest from many local people keen on saving the historic building which the council had branded as &quot;unsafe&quot;. The station was originally opened in 1877 and was used continuously until 1959, after which it was the site of a small printers for many years until its demolition.

From 1877 until 1951 there was also Felixstowe Pier railway station, sited inside the area of the modern day docks at a small pier popular with pleasure boats, and with a paddle steamer link to London. A dock next to the pier was approved in 1879.

==Transport==
===Shipping===
Felixstowe is Britain&#x27;s largest container port.

The main navigation channel is dredged to below chart datum and a depth of up to alongside the quay. Felixstowe boasts deep-water able to accommodate the world&#x27;s latest generation of deep-draughted ultra post-Panamax vessels. There is a continuous quay of 2.4 km, equipped with 25 ship-to-shore gantry cranes.

The town has road links to the Midlands, via the A14, and to London, via the A12 road. The single-track railway line to Ipswich has been upgraded recently to allow larger containers; many more are now transported by rail.

The port is owned by Hutchison Port Holdings Ltd with additional land on the peninsula owned by Trinity College, Cambridge. The port has its own Police Authority, which also currently has jurisdiction over the area local to the port, with permission from Suffolk Constabulary&#x27;s Chief Constable. Alongside the Port Police, they also have their own joint ambulance and fire service; one of the port ambulances, call sign &quot;Alpha 1&quot;, can also come off port to attend 999 emergencies in Felixstowe.

===Ferries===
The Harwich Harbour Ferry operates between the View Point (near Landguard Fort) in Felixstowe and Ha&#x27;penny Pier, Harwich and Shotley Point throughout the summer. The Bawdsey Ferry crosses the River Deben from Felixstowe Ferry.

===Railway===
Felixstowe railway station is the eastern terminus of the passenger service to Ipswich, via the Felixstowe Branch Line; the line itself branches before the station, the other line goes on to the Port of Felixstowe.

===Buses and coaches===
Local bus services are operated by First Eastern Counties, with routes to Ipswich and Woodbridge.

The National Express coach service 481 provides a connection to London with intermediate stops at other major towns, such as Ipswich, Colchester, Witham, Chelmsford and Brentwood. A weekday service departs daily at 07:20 and returns at 18:00, while the weekend service departs at 07:55 and returns at 18:00.

==Governance==
Felixstowe is administered by Suffolk County Council, East Suffolk Council and Felixstowe Town Council. The local parish council, Felixstowe Town Council, is based in Felixstowe Town Hall, on the seafront at Undercliff Road West.

Felixstowe lies within the Suffolk Coastal parliamentary constituency; Jenny Riddell-Carpenter of the Labour Party was elected as the Member of Parliament in the 2024 General Election.

In 1894 an urban district called &quot;Felixstowe and Walton&quot; was formed which contained the parishes of &quot;Felixstowe&quot; and &quot;Walton&quot;, in 1889 it became part of the administrative county of East Suffolk. In 1914 Walton parish was merged with Felixstowe and the urban district was renamed to just &quot;Felixstowe&quot;. On 1 April 1974 the district was abolished and became part of Suffolk Coastal in the non-metropolitan county of Suffolk. A successor parish was formed covering the same area as the former district and its parish. In 2019 Felixstowe became part of East Suffolk district.

== Landmarks ==
Landguard Fort is a scheduled ancient monument and visitor attraction with a nearby nature reserve. At the opposite end of the town is Felixstowe Ferry Golf Club, which is amongst the oldest in the UK, having been established in 1881. The Rt. Hon. Arthur Balfour, Captain of the Golf Club in 1889, became captain of the R&amp;A in 1894 and British Prime Minister from 1902 to 1905.

Felixstowe has a recently refurbished sandy beach south from the pier, and a stoney beach north of the pier. A Victorian promenade runs along part of the beach, from the nature reserve in the southwest to Cobbolds Point (Maybush Lane in east), with traditional beach huts along most of that length. An amusement arcade with snooker halls and food outlets occupies the southern end. The pier, incorporating a cafe and amusement arcade, stands before a leisure centre, with swimming pool, owned by the local council, now managed by a contractor. 
Cobbolds Point takes its name from Felix Cobbold, who built Felixstowe Lodge, now known as Cranmer House, and associated sea wall at the bottom of Maybush Lane in 1885. It is a Grade II-listed mock Elizabethan mansion by Thomas Cotman. Its listing describes it as &quot;a fine house of the period reflecting the wealth of this important Suffolk family of brewers&quot;. However Felix was involved in the banking and insurance interests of the family rather than its brewing assets.

Cotman, the architect, designed many of the most famous buildings in Felixstowe including the Railway Station, Harvest House (Felix Hotel), the Orwell and Bath Hotels, Barclays and Lloyds Banks plus many others. He also designed and lived in the original bungalow that forms the lower two floors of Cotman Lodge care home. He was the nephew of John Sell Cotman, the famous Norwich water-colour artist.

The Art Deco style of architecture has been used for some buildings. The Cavendish Hotel in Sea Road, demolished in 1988, was in this style. There is another example in Undercliff Road West, which has been home to the Felixstowe Tourist Information Centre.

From Brackenberry Fort to Felixstowe Ferry there is a walkway and is the start of the 50-mile Suffolk Coast Path. At low tide from Jacob&#x27;s Ladder, it is possible to glimpse the seaweed-covered remains of a Roman fort, which could possibly be the place of Dommoc, in the water about 50 yards from the coast, where it suggested St Felix first landed in England.

Perhaps the most striking building on the front is Harvest House. Originally built as the Felix Hotel, it then became Fisons&#x27; headquarters. It has now been converted to apartments for residents of retirement age, many with fabulous views over Felixstowe.

== Healthcare ==

=== The Herman de Stern Convalescent Home ===
This was built on the sea front, had 19 beds and was open from about 1902 until the 1970s. It was run by The London Hospital to provide a space where patients could recuperate by the sea. Nurses were also sometimes sent there from The London. After its closure the home became the Herman de Sterne Centre. Following a severe fire it was demolished in 2006. Two matrons who had trained at The London Hospital, under Eva Luckes were:

* Lucy Walmsley, 1902-1908.
* Agnes Prentice Leck, 1908- at least 1919.

==Parks==

=== Langer Park ===
The most southern park in Felixstowe is Langer Park, which lies between the railway line running north from the Port of Felixstowe and the houses running along the western side of Langer Road. Its north and south parameters are given by the Lidl superstore and Beach Station Road accordingly, giving the park a long rectangular-like shape. The park holds host to a narrow stream of which is the last remnant of the late Walton Creek, which had originally run from the Ordinance Hotel (demolished as of late 2014 to make way for a Premier Inn) to the Felixstowe Dock Basin. The park itself is mainly covered by open green space in which to partake field sports, and is also accompanied by a what once was a small play area. The current play equipment of 2015 is only present by the &#x27;Parks for People&#x27; scheme by the Big Lottery Fund and Heritage Lottery Fund, and is much more modernized than the pre-existing swings.

=== Coronation Recreation (Sports) Ground ===
This park is situated alongside Coronation Drive and Mill Lane, with a sectioned-off children&#x27;s play area and open green space for specific sports use. Access is via a side alley at the Eastern side of Coronation Drive, through the Rugby Union entrance on Mill Lane, and a small footpath via Kings Fleet Road. The sports ground was opened on 1 May 1956 under H.R.H. The Duke of Edinburgh.

The grounds are home to the Felixstowe Rugby Union Football Club which as of March 2015 had a Pitchero Club Ranking of 1205th. It also provides facilities for junior football and cricket, which is home to the Felixstowe Corinthians Cricket Club. These facilities are accompanied by a small car park housing 20 spaces and changing rooms.

=== The Grove and Eastward Ho ===
The largest and most northern of the Felixstowe parks consists of a woodland named The Grove, adjacent to Eastward Ho playing fields. The Grove woodland is formed mainly of ash, oak and sycamore trees, whilst allium ursinum or wild garlic grows here during the spring. Eastward Ho was originally a golf course but nowadays is a public recreational space featuring a number of football pitches, changing facilities and an enclosed children&#x27;s play area. The play area features in the music video for Ed Sheeran&#x27;s single &quot;Castle on the Hill&quot;. On the western side of The Grove is another woodland named Abbey Grove, planted in 1998 and maintained by The Woodland Trust with permitted access to the public.

=== Felixstowe Skatepark ===
Original ideas for a skate park were addressed in 2004 by the Felixstowe Skate Association, who organized a number of meetings and poster campaigns to start the project. They also brought out newsletters to help build public opinion of the idea, which attracted attention from other groups. Level Two (a local youth organization) eventually took up management of the fundraising process and in 2007 managed to secure a grant of £25,000 from the government&#x27;s youth opportunity fund. Additionally by this date, the Felixstowe Town Council had already set aside £30,000 for the project, as well as £15,000 agreed upon by the Suffolk Coastal cabinet and £40,000 from the playspace fund. When completed the project took a total of £180,000, and was opened at a community event on 1 September 2009. The original designs by the FSA included provisions for CCTV and floodlights to ensure youth safety, and further into the design process some metal wire cages of rocks added to help soundproof the area.

=== Allenby Park ===
Named after the late Edmund Henry Hynman Allenby (see notable persons section), the park was formed in 1923 when the Allenby owned Felixstowe House was demolished at the passing of Catherine Allenby. It also used to be the site of the Eastern Counties Bible Convention from 1920 to 1939 until it was held inside churches. It consists of a small all-weather football playing field, a sectioned off children&#x27;s play area, and winded path around the layout of the park. Park access can be gained from Constable Road.

=== Seaton Park (Harpers) ===
Enclosed between Cornwall Road, Margaret Street, Cage Lane and Seaton Road is Seaton Park. The park is rectangular in shape and used to include toilets, but sadly they got damaged and are now unusable, so they have been closed off. And mainly consists of open space with an enclosed children&#x27;s play area.

=== Clifftops ===
Clifftops is accessed from Cliff Road next to Felixstowe Ferry Golf Club and is the most easterly park in Felixstowe. As the name suggests the park sits atop cliffs overlooking the North Sea, Deben Estuary and golf course. This is primarily used as pay and display car parking with a large grass open area used for both recreation and for overflow parking during peak times. Toilet facilities are available on site. The beach below can be accessed on foot via steps. Also known as the army field by locals due to a former army base being located on the site.

==Offshore radio==
The first pirate radio station off the British coast operated from a ship anchored off Felixstowe.

Radio Caroline ship MV &quot;Caroline&quot; was outside the three-mile limit at Easter 1964. It was the very first UK radio station aboard a ship in the North Sea, and intended to break the monopoly of the BBC. Radio Caroline had about seven million listeners in its first week on air. The station&#x27;s slogan was &quot;Your all-day music station&quot;, and it initially broadcast from 6am to 6pm, seven days a week. The transmitter had a power of 10 kW on 199 metres – 1.520 kHz. The ship moved to waters off the Isle of Man in July 1964 to become Radio Caroline North, while MV &quot;Mi-Amigo&quot; of Radio Atlanta on 201 metres became Radio Caroline South, broadcasting on first 199 later on 259 metres – 1.178 kHz with 50 kW of power on medium wave. &quot;Mi Amigo&quot; remained in waters off Clacton-on-Sea, Essex.

Felixstowe Museum installed an offshore radio display in their tearoom in 2015. This is being moved and expanded into the Museum itself from 2019, as part of a 1960s themed display.

==Literature==
Felixstowe was identified by the academic and celebrated ghost-story author M.R. James as the location upon which his fictitious town of Burnstow was based. Burnstow appeared in both of James&#x27; short ghost stories &#x27;Oh, Whistle, and I&#x27;ll Come to You, My Lad&#x27; and &quot;The Tractate Middoth&quot;, published in &quot;Ghost Stories of an Antiquary&quot; in 1904.

Poet John Betjamin briefly lodged in Felixstowe and wrote a poem called Felixstowe or &quot;The last of her order&quot;.

Author Liz Trenow set her 2020 novel &quot;Under a Wartime Sky&quot; in Felixstowe and at Bawdsey Manor, just the other side of the Deben estuary where in the years leading up to the Second World War, and under great secrecy, Robert Watson Watt and his team invented and perfected radar systems, and which became RAF Bawdsey, site of the first radar station.

<text>François-Antoine, Count of the Empire (1756–1826) was a French writer, lawyer and politician during the Revolution and the Empire.

==Biography==

===Early career===
Born to a Protestant family in Saint-Jean-Chambre, Ardèche, he studied Law and, after literary attempts, became a lawyer to the &quot;parlement&quot; of Paris.

In 1789 he was elected by the Third Estate of the &quot;sénéchaussee&quot; of Annonay as deputy to the Estates-General. He was one of those who induced the Estates-General to proclaim itself a National Assembly on 17 June 1789, and approved, in several speeches, of the storming of the Bastille and of the taking of the royal family to Paris (October 1789).

Boissy d&#x27;Anglas demanded that strict measures be taken against the Royalists who were conspiring in Southern France, and published some pamphlets on financial issues. During the Legislative Assembly, he was &quot;procureur-syndic&quot; for the directory of the &quot;département&quot; of Ardèche.

===During the Revolution===
Elected to the National Convention, he sat in the centre, &quot;le Marais&quot;, voting in the trial of Louis XVI for his detention until deportation should be judged expedient for the state. He was then representative on mission to Lyon, charged with investigating frauds in connection with the supplies of the Army of the Alps.

Although he had been close to several Girondists, Boissy d&#x27;Anglas escaped arrest after François Hanriot&#x27;s insurrection of 2 June 1793, and he was one of several centrist deputies who supported Maximilien Robespierre during the early stages of the Reign of Terror. However, he was gained over by the members of The Mountain hostile to Robespierre, and his support, along with that of some other leaders of the &quot;Marais&quot;, made possible the Thermidorian Reaction.

Boissy d&#x27;Anglas was then elected a member of the Committee of Public Safety, and charged with the superintendence of the provisioning of Paris. He presented the report supporting the decree of 3 Ventôse of the year III (February 1795), which established freedom of religion. In the critical days of Germinal and of Prairial of the year III, he was noted for his courage.

On 12 Germinal, the day of insurrection of 12 Germinal year III, he was in the tribune, reading a report on the food supplies, when the hall of the Convention was invaded; when they withdrew he quietly continued where he had been interrupted. During Insurrection of 1 Prairial, he was presiding over the Convention, and remained in his post despite insults and menaces of the insurgents. When the head of the deputy, Jean-Bertrand Féraud, was presented to him on the end of a pike, he saluted it impassively.

===Under the Directory===
He was protractor of the committee which drew up the Constitution of the Year III which established the French Directory; his report shows apprehension of a return of the Reign of Terror, and presents reactionary measures as precautions against the re-establishment of &quot;tyranny and anarchy&quot;. This report, the proposal that he made (27 August 1795) to lessen the severity of the revolutionary laws, and the eulogies he received from several Paris sections suspected of Royalism, resulted in his being obliged to justify himself (15 October 1795).

As a member of the Council of Five Hundred, Boissy d&#x27;Anglas became more and more suspected of Royalism himself. He presented a measure in favour of full liberty for the press, which at that time was almost unanimously reactionary, protested against the outlawry of returned &quot;émigrés&quot;, spoke in favour of the deported priests and attacked the Directory. Accordingly, he was proscribed immediately after the coup of 18 Fructidor, and lived in Great Britain until the establishment of the French Consulate.

===Later life===
In 1801 he was made a member of the Tribunate, and in 1805 a senator of the Empire. In 1814 he voted for Napoleon&#x27;s abdication, which won for him a seat in the Chamber of Peers after the First Bourbon Restoration. However, during the Hundred Days he returned to serving Napoleon. After the defeat at Waterloo and the subsequent abdication of Napoleon, 1815 Boissy d&#x27;Anglas was one of the five commissioners sent by the Provisional Government to try to negotiate peace terms with the Duke of Wellington and Prince Blücher. For his disloyalty to Louis XVIII, on the Second Restoration, he was for a short while excluded.

In the Chamber he still sought to obtain liberty for the press —a theme upon which he published a volume of his speeches (Paris, 1817). He was a member of the Institut de France from its foundation, and in 1816, after its reorganization, became a member of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres. He published in 1819–1821 a two-volume &quot;Essai sur la vie et les opinions de M. de Malesherbes&quot;.

==Family and children==
He married Marie-Françoise Michel (Nîmes, 6 January 1759Bougival, 21 March 1850) on 11 March 1776 in Vauvert. They had four children:
* Marie-Anne (17 February 1777October 1855)
* Suzanne (14 October 17796 March 1851)
* François-Antoine, Jr. (23 February 178112 November 1850), prefect of Charente
* Jean-Gabriel (2 April 17836 May 1864), Orléanist politician

<doc id="350358" wikidata="Q140447" url="?curid=350358" title="Three Wishes for Cinderella (1973 film)">
<text>Three Wishes for Cinderella (; , also called in English &quot;Three Hazelnuts for Cinderella&quot; or &quot;Three Gifts for Cinderella&quot;) is a 1973 Czechoslovak-East German film based on the fairy-tale &quot;Cinderella&quot;.

It was directed by Václav Vorlíček in a co-production between DEFA-Studio für Spielfilme and Barrandov Studios. The story was based on the fairy tale &quot;O Popelce&quot; written by Božena Němcová (a Bohemian variation of the classic Cinderella fairytale). It still remains a popular Christmas holiday film in many European countries.

== Plot ==
Cinderella&#x27;s stepmother has the village in a frenzy preparing for the arrival of the king and queen, who will be stopping en route to their nearby castle. Cinderella takes the blame for a kitchen boy&#x27;s accident, prompting her stepmother to berate her as well as her late father. Enraged, Cinderella snaps back at her, and is subsequently punished by having to separate lentils and ashes mixed together in a bucket. As she settles down to work, her friends, a flock of white doves, come in to separate the mixture for her. Freed of her punishment, Cinderella visits the stable to see her white horse, which she used to ride in the forest with her father while hunting. As the royal party approaches, everyone gathers to greet them, except Cinderella, who is forbidden to attend as the Stepmother wants to showcase her own less attractive daughter, Dora, since the Prince is expected to marry soon.

Cinderella uses the distraction to slip away with her horse, visit her pet owl and enjoy the wintry forest. Her ride is cut short as she happens upon the Prince and his companions, Vítek and Kamil, hunting there. They spot a doe struggling in the snow, but the Prince&#x27;s crossbow shot is foiled by a snowball thrown by Cinderella. They give chase and catch up with her, laughing at her as an impudent child. She insults the prince, escapes and mounts his horse, Dapples. They chase her with renewed urgency since Dapples has a reputation of being unmanageable. To their surprise, she rides him easily before transferring to her own horse and sending Dapples back to the Prince.

The Stepmother uses the royal visit to wrangle an invitation to the ball from the King, who reluctantly offers it out of politeness. En route to the castle, they are joined by the Prince&#x27;s party. The King, annoyed by his son&#x27;s youthful irresponsibility, says the Prince must get married. 

The Stepmother sends Vincek the servant to town to purchase fabrics and supplies to make new dresses for her and Dora. En route, he sees Cinderella forced to wash laundry in an icy stream. Feeling sympathetic but helpless, he promises to bring her a gift of whatever hits him on the nose. After hearing his father&#x27;s plans to force him to become engaged at the ball, the Prince returns to the woods. He sees Vincek asleep in his sled, the horses drawing it home. Using his crossbow, he mischievously shoots a bird&#x27;s nest from a tree branch, which falls on Vincek&#x27;s face. Vincek finds a twig with three hazelnuts in the nest and decides that will be Cinderella&#x27;s gift. Cinderella likes the present although her stepmother derides it as &quot;fit for a squirrel.&quot;

The Stepmother and Dora realize they forgot to get new jewellery and go to town to choose it themselves. The Stepmother punishes Cinderella for impertinence again by forcing her to separate corn kernels from lentils. Once again, the doves help Cinderella. She visits her owl, wishing she had the same freedom to come and go. She wishes she had a disguise so she could venture out. One hazelnut drops from the twig and magically opens to show a complete hunter&#x27;s outfit within. Suitably clothed, Cinderella goes into the woods, and sees the Prince with a hunting party. The lead huntsman shows a bejeweled ring that the King promises to the first hunter to shoot down a bird of prey. The hunters, including the Prince, cannot do so. Cinderella shoots it down, then shoots the arrow from the Prince&#x27;s hand. Impressed by the &quot;young huntsman,&quot; he puts the ring on Cinderella&#x27;s gloved hand. He asks her to do better by shooting a pine cone from the top of a tree. She does so and then slips away as he marvels at her marksmanship. Chasing after her, he finds her high in a tree in her own clothes, refusing to tell where the &quot;young huntsman&quot; went.

The Stepmother and Dora leave for the castle ball. Visiting her owl, Cinderella wishes she could go then wonders if she could get another outfit. A second hazelnut opens to reveal a lavish ball gown. Her horse is also saddled with an ornate sidesaddle. Riding to the castle, she makes her way to the ballroom. Donning a veil, she greets the Prince, who was tired of being pursued by the female guests. He finds the veiled stranger mysterious and charming. The King and Queen are amazed at his softened manner. She refuses to accept his proposal unless he can solve a riddle, which referenced their earlier meetings. She runs out and the Prince gives chase, following her back to her village. There, he has the women try on the slipper Cinderella had lost. Meanwhile, the Prince plays a game of darts against a mysterious figure known only as &quot;Robin&quot;. The Stepmother and Dora return. Seeing the Prince, they scheme to snare him, tying up Cinderella and stealing her clothing. When he asks that the disguised Dora try on the slipper, the Stepmother snatches it and they ride away in a sled. The Prince chases until the sled falls into a pond. Seeing that it is actually Dora, he takes the slipper and returns to the village.

Cinderella visits her owl again. She is ecstatic to find that the final nut contains a wedding dress. Donning it, she rides out on her horse, surprising the village and the Prince. The slipper fits and she wants to return the ring, but he slips it back on her finger. She offers the riddle again and the Prince remembers his encounters with her alter egos. He proposes to Cinderella, who accepts, with the entire village cheering for her.

The film was released in a Czech and a German version. The ensemble was composed of Czech and German actors all speaking their native languages. In the respective editions, they were dubbed to Czech or German.

Jana Preissová was sought for the title role but could not take it due to her pregnancy. Libuše Šafránková was hired instead.

== Production ==
The film was originally written for warm weather, but director Václav Vorlíček suggested setting the film in winter instead and delayed filming for months.

Screenwriter František Pavlíček was blacklisted by the Czechoslovak government at the time the movie was made. He was credited under a pseudonym instead, with the Barrandov Studio head and the director keeping his identity secret.

Theodor Pištěk and Günter Schmidt designed the costumes for the film. Theodor designed for the main and memorable characters (Cinderella, the Prince, the King, the Queen, the Stepmother, the Stepsister and Princess Droběna) while Günter designed for all other ones.

The film was shot between December 11, 1972 and March 29, 1973 at the DEFA studios in Potsdam-Babelsberg (Brandenburg), Moritzburg Castle in Saxony, in the Barrandov studios in Prague, and in various places in Bohemia in what was then Czechoslovakia, including the Švihov castle in western Bohemia and the Bohemian Forest.

== Release ==
The film&#x27;s gala premiere was at the Sevastopol cinema in Prague on October 26, 1973. After being theatrically released in Soviet Union on November 1, 1973 and in Czechoslovakia on November 16, the film had its international premiere in East Berlin in March 1974.

== International history ==
The BBC serialized the film in three thirty-minute segments under the title &quot;Three Gifts for Cinderella&quot; in 1974, adding English-language narration rather than dubbing the dialog. Another English dub was made in the United States and the film was edited down to an hour, to be shown on the &quot;CBS Children&#x27;s Film Festival&quot; miniseries, three times in 1974 through 1976. The American dub was also shown in Canada on CBC TV (CBHT Halifax / CBIT Sydney / CBCT Charlottetown) in the Maritimes on 18 November 1978 and 10 March 1979.
The film has become a holiday classic in several European countries. 

It is shown on TV around Christmas time every year in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Germany and Norway, but it is also popular for example in Austria, Spain, the United Arab Emirates or in the Philippines. In some countries, there are multiple broadcasts during December. This film&#x27;s status has been likened to that held by Frank Capra&#x27;s 1946 &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; in the United States as a holiday staple.

This movie was released in Japan on VHS with Japanese dubbing. In 1977, it was premiered in Catalonia with Catalan dubbing. It was the first time that a product oriented to children was translated into that language.

== Soundtrack ==
The soundtrack was composed by Karel Svoboda. The love theme, &quot;Kdepak ty ptáčku hnízdo máš&quot; (&quot;Where Is Your Nest, Little Bird?&quot;), was sung by Czech pop singer Karel Gott.

==Digital restoration==
With the financial and technical support from Norway and its authorities, the Czech Film Archive and the National Library in Mo i Rana, the film &quot;Tři oříšky pro Popelku&quot; was digitized, restored, and got modern image quality. The project was financed through the EEA and Norway Grants which represent Norway&#x27;s contribution to social and economic cohesion in the European Economic Area (EEA). Norway has granted just under 7.5 million NOK for efforts to digitize ten older Czech films. The digitization was completed by December 2015.

== Home video releases ==
Czech, Norwegian and German DVDs are available. A region-free DVD with monophonic Czech audio track was released in the United Kingdom by Second Run in December 2016.

A Blu-ray edition with stereo Czech audio was also released in December 2016.

== Remake ==
&quot;Tre nøtter til Askepott&quot;, a Norwegian remake of the movie, was released on 12 November 2021, starring Astrid S and Cengiz Al in the two lead roles and featuring Kristofer Hivju.
