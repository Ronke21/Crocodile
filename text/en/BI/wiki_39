<text>Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery (BM&amp;AG) is a museum and art gallery in Birmingham, England. It has a collection of international importance covering fine art, ceramics, metalwork, jewellery, natural history, archaeology, ethnography, local history and industrial history.

The museum/gallery is run by Birmingham Museums Trust, the largest independent museums trust in the United Kingdom, which also runs eight other museums around the city. Entrance to the Museum and Art Gallery is free, but some major exhibitions in the Gas Hall incur an entrance fee.

==History==
In 1829, the Birmingham Society of Artists created a &quot;private&quot; exhibition building in New Street, Birmingham while the historical precedent for public education around that time produced the Factory Act 1833, the first instance of Government funding for education.

The Museums Act 1845 &quot;[empowered] boroughs with a population of 10,000 or more to raise a 1/2d for the establishment of museums.&quot; In 1864, the first &quot;public&quot; exhibition room, was opened when the Society and other donors presented 64 pictures as well as the Sultanganj Buddha to Birmingham Council and these were housed in the Free Library building but, due to lack of space, the pictures had to move to Aston Hall. Joseph Henry Nettlefold (1827–1881) bequeathed twenty-five pictures by David Cox to Birmingham Art Gallery on the condition it opened on Sundays.

In June 1880, local artist Allen Edward Everitt accepted the post of honorary curator of the Free Art Gallery, a municipal institution which was the forerunner of the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery.

Jesse Collings, Mayor of Birmingham 1878–79, was responsible for free libraries in Birmingham and was the original proponent of the Birmingham Art Gallery. A gift of £10,000 (equivalent to £ in 2020) made by Sir Richard and George Tangye started a new drive for an art gallery and, in 1885, following other donations and £40,000 from the council, the Prince of Wales officially opened the new gallery on Saturday 28 November 1885. The Museum and Art Gallery occupied an extended part of the Council House above the new offices of the municipal Gas Department (which in effect subsidised the venture thus circumventing the Public Libraries Act 1850 which limited the use of public funds on the arts). The building was designed by Yeoville Thomason. The metalwork for the new building (and adjoining Council House) was by the Birmingham firm of Hart, Son, Peard &amp; Co. and extended to both the interior and exterior including the distinctive cast-iron columns in the main gallery space for the display of decorative art. The lofty portico, surmounted by a pediment by Francis John Williamson, representing an allegory of Birmingham contributing to the fine arts, was together with the clock-tower considered the &quot;most conspicuous features&quot; of the exterior upon its opening. By 1900 the collection, especially its contemporary British holdings, was deemed by the &quot;Magazine of Art&quot; to be &quot;one of the finest and handsomest&quot; in Britain.

Until 1946, when property taxes were voted towards acquisitions, the museum relied on the generosity of private individuals. John Feeney provided £50,000 to provide a further gallery.

Seven galleries had to be rebuilt after being bombed in 1940. Immediately after World War II &quot;Mighty Mary&quot; Mary Woodall (1901–1988) was appointed keeper of art under director, Trenchard Cox. Woodall and Cox, through their links to the London art world, were able to attract exhibitions, much publicity and donations to the gallery. In 1956, Woodall replaced Cox when the latter became Director of the Victoria and Albert Museum. John Woodward (1921–1988) was Keeper of Art from 1956 to 1964.

In 1951, the Museum of Science and Industry, Birmingham was incorporated into BM&amp;AG. In 2001, the Science Museum closed with some exhibits being transferred to Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum, which was operated by the independent Thinktank Trust that has since become part of Birmingham Museums Trust.
The main entrance is located in Chamberlain Square below the clock-tower known locally as &quot;Big Brum&quot;. The entrance hall memorial reads &#x27;By the gains of Industry we promote Art&#x27;. The Extension Block has entrances via the Gas Hall in Edmund Street and Great Charles Street. Waterhall, the original gas department, has its own entrance on Edmund Street.

In October 2010, the Waterhall closed as a BM&amp;AG gallery as a result of a £1.5m cut to Birmingham Museums and Art Gallery&#x27;s budget in 2010–11. The last BM&amp;AG exhibition that took place in the Waterhall at that time was the Steve McCurry retrospective that ran from 26 June to 17 October 2010. The Waterhall and the Gas Hall have reopened for exhibitions throughout the year.

BM&amp;AG, formerly managed by Birmingham City Council, is now, with Thinktank, part of Birmingham Museums Trust.

Due to the global pandemic, the museum closed in October 2020. The museum remained closed throughout 2021 as part of a project to rewire the Council complex that houses the museum. The museum partially reopened in April 2022 with a number of pop-up exhibitions. It will close again in December 2022 ahead of a full reopening expected in 2024. The gallery&#x27;s Round Room, Industrial Gallery, and Bridge Gallery reopened on 24 October 2024, as did the tearoom and shop.

There is also mediaeval material, much of which is now on display in The Birmingham History Galleries, a permanent exhibition on the third floor of the museum.

In November 2014, a dedicated gallery was opened to display the Staffordshire Hoard. Discovered in the nearby village of Hammerwich in 2009, it was the largest hoard of Anglo-Saxon gold ever found.

In respect of local and industrial history, the tower of the Birmingham HP Sauce factory was a famous landmark alongside the Aston Expressway which was demolished in the summer of 2007. The giant logo from the top of the tower is now in the collection of the Museum.

<doc id="345554" wikidata="Q2892594" url="?curid=345554" title="Sheffield Castle">
<text>Sheffield Castle was a castle in Sheffield, England, constructed at the confluence of the River Sheaf and the River Don, possibly on the site of a former Anglo-Saxon long house, and dominating the early town. A motte and bailey castle had been constructed on the site at some time in the century following the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. This was destroyed in the Second Barons&#x27; War. Construction of a second castle, this time in stone, began four years later in 1270.

Mary, Queen of Scots was held prisoner in this castle and its associated estates at various times during the 14 years between 1570 and 1584, alternating with other properties of George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury. The castle was held by Royalist forces for part of the English Civil War, and was surrendered to the Parliamentarians in 1644 following a short siege. Its demolition was ordered soon after, and the castle was razed.

There are no known surviving drawings or plans of the castle, but excavations in the 1920s revealed stone foundations from the castle begun in 1270 as well as evidence of earlier structures. Further architectural investigation was possible in 2015, following the demolition of the 20th-century market which had been built on top of the ruins.

==Background==
Sheffield Castle was located at the confluence of the River Sheaf and the River Don (), on the western bank of the Sheaf and the southern bank of the Don. The rivers provided defence to the north and east and there was a moat on the south and western sides of the castle. This site was largely covered by Castle Market which was demolished in 2015.

Early activity on the site is suggested by several finds including a Bronze Age flint horseshoe scraper, and in the Roman period Samian Ware and Silchester pottery, discovered during excavations in the 1920s.

The site of the castle is the place where the earliest settlement at Sheffield was founded sometime in the second half of the 1st millennium AD. The Domesday Book of 1086 states that, prior to the Norman Conquest of England in 1066, Waltheof II, Earl of Northumbria, had an &quot;aula&quot; (hall) in the manor of Hallam. In the same entry, it is reported that the manor of Sheffield—which had been part of Hallam—was under the Lordship of Sweyn at the time of the conquest. It has been speculated that Waltheof&#x27;s &quot;aula&quot; or Sweyn&#x27;s stronghold may have been at this site, and excavations between 1927 and 1930 were claimed to have uncovered evidence of a Saxon structure. However, on the basis of three separate extracts from the Domesday Survey it can be shown that the manors of Hallam, Attercliffe, and Sheffield were three distinct and separate entities at the time of the Survey and beyond; and that the village of Hallam and Waltheof&#x27;s aula could only have been located in the manor of Hallam, and not Sheffield.

The studies conducted by A. L. Armstrong during the archaeological investigations of the late 1920s provide evidence that the Saxon remains were not those of Waltheof&#x27;s aula. Armstrong&#x27;s description suggests that the timbers were cut down to the level of the surrounding earth, burned, and the area immediately cleared to make way for the construction of the Lovetot castle (circa 1100), some two decades after the destruction of Waltheof&#x27;s aula.

==William de Lovetot&#x27;s castle==
The construction of the first castle at Sheffield following the Norman invasion of England is usually attributed to William de Lovetot, an Anglo-Norman Baron from Huntingdonshire. De Lovetot acquired the lordship of the manor of Hallamshire (including Sheffield) in the early twelfth century during the reign of Henry I. The earliest known reference to a castle at Sheffield is a return made by Ralph Murdac, sheriff of Derbyshire, concerning the wardship of Maud de Lovetot (the great granddaughter of William), dating from around 1188.

It is thought that this castle was a wooden motte and bailey type. Maud de Lovetot married Gerard de Furnival in 1204 and the castle and town of Sheffield passed to the Furnival family. Gerard de Furnival&#x27;s grandson, Thomas, supported the Royalist cause during the Second Barons&#x27; War of 1264–1267. In 1266 a party of anti-monarchy barons, led by John de Eyvill, marching from north Lincolnshire to Derbyshire passed through Sheffield and destroyed the town, burning the church and castle.

==Thomas de Furnival&#x27;s castle==
In 1270 Thomas de Furnival obtained a charter from King Henry III to build a castle at Sheffield. Thomas died soon after the castle was completed and was buried in the castle. The castle was damaged on 24 February 1574 when Sheffield suffered an earthquake damaging the apartment where Mary Queen of Scots was held prisoner. In 1707 a report was published stating that, when the castle was demolished in 1648, a large flat stone was found engraved &quot;I Lord Furnival; I built this castle-hall; And under this wall; Within this tomb was my burial&quot;.

De Furnival&#x27;s castle was built of stone, and extended from the river Sheaf to Waingate and from the river Don to Dixon Lane, an area of about . A park was attached to the castle, it extended from the castle to Gleadless to the south and Handsworth to the east. In 1516, George Talbot, 4th Earl of Shrewsbury, built the alternative residence of Sheffield Manor in the park.

==Destruction of the castle==
On 11 October 1642, as England moved towards civil war, the town and castle were seized by Parliamentarians under Sir John Gell. In April 1643, Royalists under Earl of Newcastle entered Yorkshire and took Leeds, Wakefield, and Rotherham before approaching Sheffield. The Parliamentarians abandoned Sheffield for Derbyshire, and the Royalists captured the castle without fighting. Newcastle left a garrison at the castle commanded by Sir William Savile. According to Margaret Cavendish, Newcastle&#x27;s wife:

Savile passed control of Sheffield and the castle to his deputy, Major Thomas Beaumont, who held them until August 1644. That month the Earl of Manchester sent 1,200 Parliamentarians troops under Major-General Crawford and Colonel Pickering to recapture Sheffield. Initially, the besiegers artillery could not breach the walls; their largest gun was a demi-culverin. On General Crawford&#x27;s request, Lord Fairfax reinforced the siege with a demi-cannon (&quot;the Queen&#x27;s pocket-pistoll&quot;) and a whole culverin. These extra cannon breached the walls and the Royalists surrendered under the following terms:

The Lady Savile mentioned in the agreement was the widow of Sir William Savile. She was pregnant at the time of the siege, and went into labour the night after the castle was surrendered.

Following the siege Colonel John Bright of Carbrook Hall became governor of the castle before being reassigned as governor of the city of York. Control of Sheffield passed to Captain Edward Gill. The House of Commons ordered the castle to be made untenable on 30 April 1646, but then ordered its demolition on 13 July 1647. Despite considerable demolition work, in 1649 the Earl of Arundel repurchased Sheffield castle with the intention of restoring it, but the damage was too great and no restoration work was ever started. The castle was soon completely razed; the site was used as an orchard and then a bowling green before being built over.

Some of the stone from the castle was used in the construction of the now demolished &quot;Free Grammar School of King James of England, within the town of Sheffield, in the County of York,&quot; which was built on Townhead Street in 1648.

==Archaeological investigations and remains==
===1920s===

An excavation led by Leslie Armstrong in 1927, before the construction of the Brightside and Carbrook Co-operative Society store, uncovered the base of one of the gateway bastion towers, as well as part of the gateway itself. These remains of the castle are preserved under the city&#x27;s Castle Market: they are Grade II listed and are open for viewing.

The visible remains were situated in two rooms below the now demolished Castle Market. One room was open to the public, pending booking of a tour, the other room was walled and the only access was via a manhole in the market&#x27;s food court. The remaining ruins, approximately 32 feet above the River Don, are those of one of the gate towers, they represent a quarter of the Eastern tower.

===1999 to 2001===
More recent excavations in 1999 and 2001 by ARCUS, Sheffield University&#x27;s archaeological research and consultancy unit, revealed the castle to have been much larger than had been thought: among the largest medieval castles in England. Drilling was done in the upper food court delivery yard and flag stones left in situ to mark boundaries of the castle.

A group of volunteers have formed the Friends of Sheffield Castle to research and promote the interests of the remains.

===Castlegate redevelopment===
Sheffield City Council announced plans in August 2014 to rebuild the entrance to the castle as part of a £5 million regeneration of the city&#x27;s Castlegate area. The plan is dependent on raising the required funds; the council has committed £1 million to the project, and further financial support has come through a series of bids.

In July 2017 a £786,000 fund was announced to redevelop the Sheffield Castlegate area as a green corridor, including funding of a major archaeological dig. The excavation project was undertaken in August 2018 by Wessex Archaeology in cooperation with students from the University of Sheffield&#x27;s archaeology department. A virtual reality model of the Castle, created by the University, was on display from 20 to 27 September 2018 at the Millennium Gallery.

<text>Charles Scott Meik (1853 – 5 July 1923) was an English civil and mechanical engineer, and part of a minor engineering dynasty. His father Thomas Meik was also a civil engineer, as was Charles&#x27; brother Patrick Meik; collectively, they established a company which became one of the UK&#x27;s major engineering consultancies.

==Early career==
Both brothers were born in Crow Tree Road, Bishopwearmouth. For three years from 1870, Charles Meik was an apprentice at Leith-based Hawthorne &amp; Co, after which he spent two years in William Armstrong&#x27;s Elswick engine works.

After three years (1875–1878) working for the borough engineer of Hull on riverside improvements, he became assistant to Sir Thomas Bouch. However, Bouch&#x27;s career was finished by the Tay Bridge disaster on 28 December 1879 in east Scotland when the 13 high girders forming the central part of the bridge crashed into the river carrying a train and 75 men, women and children with it.

In 1881, Charles Meik entered the office of Thomas Meik and Sons, as chief assistant, and was taken into partnership in 1882, working on the design and construction of dock and harbour works until 1887. He then went to Japan and worked as Chief Engineer of Harbours and Rivers for the Japanese government, returning to work in London with his brother Patrick in 1894.

==PW &amp; CS Meik==
After Thomas Meik retired in 1888, his firm (renamed Thomas Meik &amp; sons) had passed into the hands of his sons, and in 1896, it was renamed PW Meik and CS Meik.

Charles then assisted Patrick on the firm&#x27;s first venture into Wales, a massive commission to construct docks and a railway at Port Talbot for the Port Talbot Railway and Docks Company, followed by an equally ambitious scheme to expand the port of Seaham, officially opened in 1905. The Meiks&#x27; expertise saw port and railway designs developed in many parts of the British Empire, including Christmas Island, India, Burma and Mozambique.

The firm was then commissioned to design the Kinlochleven hydroelectric scheme in the Scottish Highlands. This was a huge undertaking at the time and it was to lead to an even greater hydroelectric project, the Lochaber Water Power Scheme. Meik died before construction started, leaving the project&#x27;s completion in the hands of William Halcrow (the firm name later changed to CS Meik and Halcrow, and later traded as the Halcrow Group). Meik is remembered on the family memorial in Duddingston Kirkyard.

<text>Sheffield Football Club is an English football club, currently based in Dronfield, Derbyshire. They compete in the , on the eighth level of the English football pyramid. Founded in October 1857, the club is considered by FIFA as the oldest existing independent club still playing football in the world.

Sheffield F.C. initially played games under the Sheffield Rules and did not officially adopt the new FA rules until 1878.

The club competes in the Rules derby with near neighbours Hallam. In 2004, they were given the FIFA Order of Merit, an award given to only one other club; Real Madrid. In 2007 they were inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame, to commemorate their 150th anniversary.

On the pitch, the club&#x27;s finest hour came in 1904 when they won the FA Amateur Cup, a competition conceived after a suggestion by Sheffield. They also finished as runners up of the FA Vase in 1977.

== History ==
In 1855, members of a Sheffield cricket club organised informal kick-abouts without any official rules. Subsequently, two members, Nathaniel Creswick and William Prest, formed the Sheffield Football Club.
The inaugural meeting of the club took place on 24 October 1857 at Parkfield House in the suburb of Highfield. The original headquarters was a greenhouse on East Bank Road lent by Thomas Asline Ward, father of the first club president Frederick Ward, and the adjacent field was used as their first playing ground. Initially, Sheffield FC games were played among club members themselves and took the format of &quot;Married v Singles&quot; or &quot;Professionals v the Rest&quot;.
Creswick and Prest were responsible for drawing up the club&#x27;s rules of play, which were decided upon at the club&#x27;s AGM on 21 October 1858, and published the following year. They were referred to as the Sheffield Rules, and were the first detailed set of rules of football to be published by a football club (as opposed to a school or university). At the time, before the formation of the Football Association (FA), many different kinds of football were popular in England. For example, each of the various public schools played football according to their own individual rules, and these varied widely. The Sheffield Rules were later adopted by the Sheffield Football Association when it was formed in 1867.

Sheffield&#x27;s near neighbour, Hallam, was formed in 1860 and in the same year the two clubs first met each other in a local derby which is still contested today. By 1862 there were 15 clubs in the Sheffield area.

They became members of The Football Association on 30 November 1863 but continued to use their own set of rules. On 2 January 1865, the club played its first fixture outside Sheffield against Notts County, then known as Nottingham Football Club, at the Meadows Cricket Ground; the match was played eighteen-a-side under &quot;Nottingham Rules&quot;. Sheffield won by a goal to nil.

By this time the club had decided only to play teams outside Sheffield in order to seek a bigger challenge. On 31 March 1866, Sheffield played a &quot;London&quot; team under FA rules at Battersea Park. The game, played as an eleven aside, was won by London by 2 goals and four touches down to nil. However the matter of rules remained a problem with Sheffield clubs continuing to play by their own rules. A number of rule proposals by the club were rejected by the FA in February 1867 and the London Committee were reluctant to commit to further fixtures over Sheffield&#x27;s refusal to play strictly to FA rules. Sheffield clubs finally adopted the FA rules in 1878.

In 1873 the club entered the FA Cup for the first time, their first ever tie in the competition, against Shropshire Wanderers, being decided after a replay by a coin toss; the only time in the history of the competition that a tie has been decided in this way. They would reach the 4th round of the competition in 1877–78 and 1879–80.
Their reluctance to play against local clubs led to the formation of Thursday Wanderers in 1876, a team of players registered to Sheffield who wished to play in the Sheffield Challenge Cup. The Wanderers operated from 1876 to 1879, winning the cup in their final year.

Sheffield&#x27;s decline from the top echelon of football began with the introduction of professionalism in July 1885, with the amateurs of Sheffield failing to compete with professional teams, losing heavily that year to Aston Villa, Nottingham Forest and Notts County. After the legalisation of professionalism, the staunchly amateur Sheffield suggested to the FA the creation of a cup exclusively for amateur clubs. The FA Amateur Cup was inaugurated in 1893 and Sheffield themselves won the competition in 1904.

They joined their first league competition in 1889 when entering the Midland League, but left after just one season when they finished bottom of the table. They were also founder members of the original Yorkshire League in 1898, but again they spent just a single season in the competition.

After the turn of the century, Sheffield competed mainly in local leagues. By 1925–26 they were competing in the Sheffield Association League.
Fifty years after leaving the competition, the club rejoined the Yorkshire League, in 1949. Three years later they won promotion to Division One, but were relegated back to Division Two in 1954. They returned to the top flight at the first time of asking before entering their centenary year in 1957. Celebrations included games against the England B team at Hillsborough and fellow amateur side Queen&#x27;s Park F.C. at Bramall Lane.

In 1961, Sheffield was relegated to Division Two again, only returning to the top flight again in 1967, and then only for one more season before another relegation. Three years later, in 1970, they were relegated again, to the newly formed Division Three. Club would spend six seasons in the Yorkshire League&#x27;s basement division, finishing as low as 10th in 1974. They finally started to turn their fortunes around in 1976 by returning to Division Two, and a year later they were crowned as Division Two champions to return to Division One. In the same season, Sheffield reached the final of the newly formed FA Vase. At Wembley stadium, they drew 1–1 with Billericay Town, before being beaten 1–2 in the replay at the City Ground in Nottingham.

When the Yorkshire League merged with the Midland League to form the Northern Counties East League (NCEL) in 1981, Sheffield were placed in Division One South of the new competition. They stayed in this division for three seasons before the league was restructured, with the club being reassigned to the newly formed Division One. In 1989 they won the division One title, but they were relegated back again a year later because of their lack of floodlights.

At the first time of asking Sheffield again won the division One title, this time remaining in the NCEL Premier Division for 15 years. In 1994 the club won the Sheffield &amp; Hallamshire Senior Cup for the first time, beating Worksop Town on penalties at Hillsborough. They would later win the trophy on a further four occasions throughout the 2010s.

2007 was a momentous year for Sheffield F.C. as they entered their 150th year. They finished as runners-up in the league to secure promotion to the Northern Premier League (NPL) for the first time. In October 2007, FIFA president Sepp Blatter attended the club&#x27;s anniversary dinner, and the following month the club played anniversary celebration matches against Internazionale and Ajax at Bramall Lane. Football legend Pelé was guest of honour at the first game and was introduced to the teams and the fans before the game. The match ended 5–2 to Inter, with 18,741 supporters attending the match. Inter&#x27;s side included World Cup winner Marco Materazzi and a young Mario Balotelli. As part of his visit, Pelé opened an exhibition which included the first public showing in 40 years of the original hand-written rules of football.

Sheffield have reached the play-offs of the NPL Division One South on four occasions, but have so far failed to win promotion. In their first Division One South campaign in 2008 they reached the final, losing on penalties to Nantwich Town, before being knocked out in the semi-finals in 2010, 2012 and 2019. The club first played in the FA Trophy in 2007 after winning promotion to the NPL, but have so far failed to advance past the qualifying rounds. In 2015, the Qataris donated £100,000 to Sheffield FC.

==Grounds==
Sheffield have played at a number of grounds near Sheffield. Initially they played at Strawberry Hall Lane Park. However, like all of the early grounds they played at, it was not owned by the club. In the following years they would play at Old Forge ground and a ground near Hunter&#x27;s Bar on Ecclesall Road.

There was much reluctance from the owners of Bramall Lane to see the pitch used for football. They did not relent until a charity match between Sheffield and Hallam was suggested in late 1862. The ground was used by Sheffield for its more important fixtures but relations with the owners remained strained. They collapsed altogether in 1875 when the club vowed never to play at the ground again.

In 1921, Sheffield settled at the new Abbeydale Park ground. They moved to Hillsborough Park in 1988, then to Owlerton Stadium and Don Valley Stadium. In 1999, Richard Tims got involved with Sheffield FC when he was invited to a home game in Don Valley Stadium. He noted that the club was struggling as they were playing in a rented stadium. He took over the club and helped it secure its own ground, the Coach and Horses Stadium in Dronfield, Derbyshire.

The club bought the Coach &amp; Horses ground in Dronfield in 2001, which was previously the home of Norton Woodseats F.C., a notable football team who reached the semi-finals of the FA Amateur Cup in 1939. It was the first time the club had owned its own ground. The ground has a capacity of just over 2,000 with 250 seats in the stand behind the southern goal.

In March 2019 it was revealed that Sheffield F.C. was in talks with the Sheffield Transport Sports Club (STSC) to move the club back to its home city after plans to move to the Olive Grove sports ground in the Heeley district of Sheffield fell through in 2016.
In March 2021 plans for the new stadium based at the STSC facility in the Meadowhead area of Sheffield were revealed. The proposed 4,000 person capacity stadium features a heritage centre celebrating the city&#x27;s role in football history.

The club has played its FA Cup games at the following grounds:

<text>Hallam Football Club is an English football club based in Crosspool, Sheffield, South Yorkshire. The current club dates from 1887, but Hallam have played at their Sandygate home in the Sheffield suburb of Crosspool since the time of their predecessor club&#x27;s formation in 1860. The ground is officially recognised by the Guinness Book of Records as &quot;The Oldest Football Ground in the World&quot;. In 1867, the original club made history by winning the world&#x27;s first ever football tournament, the Youdan Cup.

Hallam currently play in the Northern Counties East League Premier Division, at the ninth level of the English football league system. Games against local rivals Sheffield F.C., the oldest club in the world, are known as the Rules derby.

==History==
The football club can trace its links to 1804, when the owner of the Plough Inn public house on Sandygate Road agreed to allow a new cricket club, Hallam CC, to start playing on an adjacent field he owned.

The club had in excess of 300 members by the 1850s, and in 1860 it decided to form a football club to oppose Sheffield F.C., formed three years earlier. On Boxing Day 1860, the two clubs played each other at Sandygate for the first time. The match report for the game in the &quot;Sheffield Daily Telegraph&quot; states that the game was played between 16 of Sheffield and 16 of Hallam and Stumperlowe (Stumperlowe being a hamlet half a mile from Sandygate).

The Hallam Football Club&#x27;s founder and captain, John Charles Shaw, soon became President of the Sheffield Football Association which organised matches according to the locally preferred rules for its growing number of member clubs. Shaw was directly instrumental, with Charles Alcock of the London-based Football Association, in the formation of nationally accepted rules for playing the game. Shaw and Alcock were the respective captains in the first game between a Sheffield XI and a London XI, in 1871, in which the preferred rules were tried out.

In 1867, Hallam won the first ever football competition, the Youdan Cup. The trophy was subsequently misplaced by the club, and did not resurface again until 1997 when a Scottish antiques collector who had come into possession of the silver trophy sold it back to the club for £2,000. In 2014 the trophy was featured on the BBC programme &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot;, where it was valued at £100,000. Club chairman Chris Taylor subsequently said the club had no plans to sell the trophy.

Although professionalism began to creep into the game during the 1870s and 1880s, Hallam chose to remain fully amateur. In the summer of 1886, for reasons unknown but likely because of financial constraints, the club was dissolved, but a year later the club was re-formed and re-registered with the Sheffield &amp; Hallamshire FA.

Hallam entered their first league competition in 1892 when joining the newly formed Hallamshire League, and they would also play in the Sheffield Minor Cup League, Sheffield Alliance and the Hatchard League as the 19th century came to a close. They won the Hatchard League title for the first time in 1903, and a year later won the league again, though they lost the play-off final played between the top four teams, and so surrendered their title. They also reached the final of the Sheffield and Hallamshire Senior Cup for the first time in 1904, but lost 1–6 to Barnsley reserves at Bramall Lane.

In 1911 the club first competed in a Football Association (FA) cup competition, when they entered the FA Amateur Cup. Three years later the First World War began, but Hallam continued to play, dropping out of the Hatchard League to join the Sheffield Amateur and Minor Leagues, previously staples of the club&#x27;s reserve team. Eventually, in 1917, Hallam decided they could no longer keep playing, and suspended playing operations, only re-joining the Sheffield Amateur League after hostilities had ended, in 1919.

In 1925 Hallam pulled off one of their greatest ever results when they knocked out five-time Amateur Cup winners Bishop Auckland in front of over 2,000 people at Sandygate. Two years later the club entered the FA Cup for the first time. After winning the Sheffield Amateur League for the second time in 1927, they were admitted back into the Sheffield Association League.

At the end of the 1932–33 season the landlord of the Plough Inn public house decided to lease Sandygate to other teams (Crookes WMC and later Fulwood) as Hallam were not providing enough bar takings. Although the club retained its affiliation with the local FA, Hallam&#x27;s eviction from their ground saw them refrain from playing any football for a period of 15 years.

Hallam&#x27;s return to football came about in 1947 when they finally arranged a return to Sandygate, playing in the Sheffield Amateur League and the re-formed Hatchard League (which they won) before finally re-joining the Sheffield Association League in 1949, winning the title for the first time. A year later Hallam won the Sheffield Senior Cup for the first time when they beat Stocksbridge Works at Hillsborough in front of 7,240 spectators, and in 1952 they entered the Yorkshire League.

That same season an Amateur Cup tie with Dulwich Hamlet was switched to Hillsborough stadium because of increased ticket demands – the attendance of over 13,000 proving to be a club record. After winning promotion to the top flight of the Yorkshire League for a second time in 1960, Hallam spent twenty years playing at the same level.

The 1982–83 season saw the demise of the old Yorkshire League, with Hallam entering the new Northern Counties East League (NCEL), which demanded more stringent ground grading rules. With only seven years of its ground lease remaining the club could not commit to expensive improvements. Protracted negotiations with the landlord eventually led to a 99 years extension being granted but a large premium was demanded within one year. A massive fund raising effort secured the new lease and continued for the provision of floodlights, first used in 1992, and a stand behind one goal to shelter 100 people.

The club has spent most of its time in the NCEL in the Premier Division (which currently sits at level 9 of the English football league system), and won the League Cup competition in 2004 when beating Mickleover Sports in the final, but in 2011 they were relegated back to the First Division.

In 2012, Sandygate received a much needed facelift, paid for by a posthumous donation by a lifelong supporter who had left the club a substantial amount of money in his will. In 2016 and 2017, the club qualified for the Division One end of season play-offs, but were eliminated in the semi-finals on both occasions.

The appointment of Craig Denton as manager in 2020 was followed by an upturn in results and attendances, and in the 2021–22 season Hallam secured the Division One title and promotion to the NCEL Premier Division, with Sandygate hosting record crowds in excess of 1,100.

<text>The Blackwater Reservoir is a reservoir created behind a dam in the mountains above Kinlochleven, Lochaber, Highland, Scotland. The dam is long, the longest in the Highlands.

The hydroelectric scheme was constructed in the early 1900s for the British Aluminium Company for the purpose of smelting aluminium and was designed by engineers Patrick Meik and Charles Meik. Chief assistant resident engineer was William Halcrow.

The high dam was built at an elevation of about 305m in rugged terrain. of concrete aqueduct was constructed, and nearly of steel pipe was laid (six parallel pipelines). The dam was built using hand tools, without the benefit of mechanical earth moving machinery, and has been described as the last major creation of the traditional &#x27;navvy&#x27;.

The power house and aluminium smelting plant were situated in Kinlochleven, which is adjacent to the sea loch Loch Leven.

The power station now produces electricity for the aluminium smelter in Fort William, supplementing the supply from the Lochaber hydroelectric scheme. Surplus energy is sold to the national grid for public supply.

A number of workers lost their lives constructing the dam; their graves, which are marked by concrete markers, are close to the dam.

During the First World War, German prisoners worked on laying a pipe down the hillside from the dam.

<text>Alfred University is a private university in Alfred, New York, United States. It has a total undergraduate population of approximately 1,600 students. The university hosts the statutory New York State College of Ceramics, which includes The Inamori School of Engineering and the School of Art and Design.

==History==
Alfred University was founded as a non-sectarian select school by Seventh Day Baptists. In 1836, Bethuel C. Church, a Seventh Day Baptist, was asked to organize a college in Alfred and began teaching, receiving financial assistance from the Seventh Day Baptist Educational Society with resources, in part, from &quot;Female Educational Societies&quot; of local churches. Unusual for the time, the school was co-educational, and within its first 20 years, it also enrolled its first African-American and Native American students. From its founding as a select school, the institution received a charter as Alfred Academy from the New York State Board of Regents in 1842. Focused initially on the education of teachers, the institution continued to grow. In 1855, a curriculum was created for the Academic Department and the Collegiate with courses divided into three areas: the classic, the scientific and one for women involves most subjects in the other areas. There was no theology course in the initial period, however, the desire to organize a theological seminary led the academy, through Jonathan Allen, an early teacher, later second president, to apply for a license for a government-accredited university. After facing difficulties for more than two years, he received his charter as Alfred University from the New York State Legislature in March 1857, so that years later the Department of Theology was created. Although preceded by the short-lived New York Central College, Alfred University is the oldest surviving co-educational college in New York and New England, and the oldest college in the United States to admit women to all its programs of study, rather than having female-specific programs.

In 1900, the New York State Legislature approved the formation of &quot;a State School of Clay-Working and Ceramics&quot; at Alfred University, with the intention of establishing a public college &quot;to serve New York State industry and assist in developing New York State raw materials and assist its ceramic industry.&quot; The college has evolved into the New York State College of Ceramics at Alfred University and contains certain departments of both the School of Engineering and the School of Art and Design. The engineering curriculum includes the study of ceramics and glass, while the School of Art and Design provides art practice instruction in ceramics and glass. The College of Ceramics remains part of the State University of New York system, while Alfred University also maintains a College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and a College of Business in its private sector.

In 1908, the New York State Legislature approved the formation of the New York College of Agriculture at Alfred University. That college became autonomous in 1941 as a junior college, and, in 1948, became a member of the State University of New York system. While a separate and autonomous institution, Alfred State College, located on the opposite side of Main Street in the Village of Alfred, maintains close relations with Alfred University, and both institutions host an annual &quot;Hot Dog Day&quot; in the spring.

The origin of the name &quot;Alfred&quot; is uncertain. Residents of the town and students at the two schools believe that the town received its name in honor of Alfred the Great, king of the Saxons, although the first documented occurrence of this connection was in 1881, 73 years after the first record of the name being used to describe the geophysical area during assignments by the state legislature. State records which might have verified the connection between the Saxon king and the university were lost in a fire in 1911. Regardless of whether the connection is historically accurate, Alfred University has embraced King Alfred as a symbol of the school&#x27;s educational values, and a statue of the king stands in the center of the campus quad.

Alfred University has hosted guest lecturers, artists and musicians including Frederick Douglass, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Ghostface Killah. In April 2000, Alfred University received national attention when freshman Eric Zuckerman orchestrated a campus visit from then–First Lady, Hillary Clinton, during her campaign for the United States Senate from New York.

In the 1990s, Alfred University, together with Corning Incorporated and the State of New York, began developing the Ceramic Corridor, an incubator project designed to take advantage of the emerging ceramics industry and to create new jobs. This industrial development program has focused on developing start-up industries between Corning, NY and Alfred, NY and includes business incubator facilities in Alfred and Corning. Since its initiation, the incubator facility in Alfred has joined The Western New York Incubator Network.


In 1971, the village of Alfred, where the university is located, became only the fourth municipality in the U.S. to ban employment discrimination based on sexuality. Amidst the dissolution of the AU Greek System, the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity chapter at Alfred University led a successful effort to ban discrimination based on religion, age, disability, and sexual orientation in the constitution of the 210 chapter international fraternity in 2002.

Alfred University&#x27;s ranking by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; in its 2021 edition of Best Colleges is Regional Universities North, #45, while in 2019 the university had an acceptance rate of 66% with the middle 50% of students admitted having an SAT score between 940 and 1180 or an ACT score between 20 and 27.

==Events and culture==
===Mascot===
Alfred University&#x27;s athletic teams became known as &quot;The Saxons&quot; in 1929, but did not institute an official mascot when the moniker was selected.

In 1940, two Kappa Psi Upsilon brothers, James Lippke and Walter Lawrence, developed a character named Lil Alf to be used on their fraternity house&#x27;s signs during football games. In his original design, Lil Alf was a knight in shining armor, simplified to a small cartoonish form in a 1948 redesign.

Lil Alf was not formally adopted as a campus mascot, with many sports teams complaining that he was &quot;too cute and not fierce enough.&quot; The use of his image was formally banned on official publications by the university&#x27;s Visual Identity Standards document. In spite of opposition, his image remained ubiquitous through the 2000s and was common on unofficial sports signs and clothing.

In 2013 the university introduced Lil Alf as its official mascot. He was redesigned to feature a somewhat more historically accurate armor and helmet in Alfred University&#x27;s purple and gold.

===The Black Knight===
The Black Knight has been a part of Alfred University folklore since the early 1900s. The relic was originally part of a parlor stove in a classroom in Kanakadea Hall. When the stove was discarded, the figure was claimed by the Class of 1908 as their mascot. They passed it on to the Class of 1910, thus causing a &quot;war of possession&quot; between the even and odd numbered classes. Many times over the years it disappeared and re-appeared on campus. In 2005 it was transferred to a glass case in the Powell Campus Center, along with a plaque describing its history. However, after only a few months, the glass enclosure was destroyed in the middle of the night and the Black Knight stolen.

===Hot Dog Day===
Hot Dog Day, one of the largest yearly gatherings in Alfred, was first organized in 1972 by Mark O&#x27;Meara and Eric Vaughn as a way to bring the community together, raise money for local charities, and improve the reputations of campus Greek life. Since then the event has been organized and run by Alfred University and Alfred State College. From 2014 through 2022 the festival was held on alternating campuses, but in 2023 it resumed its original location on Main Street, Alfred. The event usually features live music, a soapbox derby, vendors, and carnival games for local children.

===In popular culture===
Alfred University was mentioned on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; once in 1975 by host and Alfred University alumnus Robert Klein. When Klein hosted SNL again in 1977, he talked at length about Alfred University in his monologue.

==Campus==

There are two libraries on Alfred&#x27;s campus, the Herrick Memorial Library, which primarily serves the private colleges, and the Scholes Library, which primarily serves the New York State College of Ceramics. The Alfred Ceramic Art Museum has a collection of 8,000 ceramic objects, including both ancient and modern ceramic art and craft.

Alfred has an astronomy program with the 7-telescope Stull Observatory, which has one of the largest optical telescopes in New York state. Asteroid 31113 Stull was named for physics professor John Stull, who helped establish the observatory in 1966.

The Bromley-Daggett Equestrian Center, located at the Maris Cuneo Equine Park, was constructed in 2005. It hosts equine classes, an intramural equestrian team, varsity and JV for both English and Western disciplines, clinics, and horse shows. Stalls are available for boarding by university students. The facility has an indoor arena of 16000 ft2 and lighted outdoor arenas of ; the entire property consists of of land.

The Miller Performing Arts Center was dedicated in 1995.
Alfred University was once associated with the Seventh Day Baptist Church, until 1945 all presidents were admitted from among the seventh day Baptists, and had a school of theology. Formerly the campus chapel, Alumni Hall is now used primarily to house the Admissions and Financial Aid Departments, and has a place on the National Register of Historic Places. In the mid-1980s, Alumni Hall was preserved through a restoration effort.

Alfred&#x27;s Davis Memorial Carillon, erected in 1937 as a tribute to longtime president Boothe C. Davis, can occasionally be heard while on campus. The bells of the carillon, purchased from Antwerp, were thought to be the oldest bells in the western hemisphere. Research later (2004) showed that the bells were of a more recent vintage, and that Alfred had been the victim of a fraud. On the brighter side, the non-historic nature of the bells allows the university to replace those that have poor tonal quality. Besides the resident carillonneur, guest carillonneurs have in the past visited and played during the summer.

==Academics==

===Colleges and schools===
Alfred University has 47 majors across its four colleges and schools. Alfred&#x27;s four private colleges are The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, The College of Professional Studies, The Inamori School of Engineering, and The Graduate School. The School of Business is part of The College of Professional Studies.

The New York State College of Ceramics (NYSCC) consists of the School of Art and Design, with its own dean, and four state-supported materials programs cross-organized within Alfred University&#x27;s School of Engineering. The College of Ceramics is functioning technically as a &quot;holding entity&quot; for the fiscal support of the state programs and the NYSCC mission. The unit head assists with budget preparation for the two aforementioned AU schools and the NYSCC-affiliated Scholes Library of Ceramics (part of the campuswide, unified AU library system), and acts in a liaison role to SUNY.

The School of Art and Design, technically a sub-unit of the College of Ceramics but autonomously run with its own dean, is further subdivided into divisions. A visit to the school in 2009 led media historian Siegfried Zielinski to state that Alfred is &quot;the center of alchemy for the 21st century.&quot; Alfred&#x27;s School of Engineering (also autonomously run with its own dean) currently has four state-supported programs and two privately endowed programs.

=== Partnerships ===
Alfred University maintains a research agreement with the China University of Geosciences in Wuhan. Alfred University also hosted a Confucius Institute supported by the China University of Geosciences since 2009. The partnerships gained attention in 2023 when the United States House Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party announced a probe into them over national security concerns. In June 2023, Alfred University announced that it was closing its Confucius Institute but did not state that it would end its partnership with the China University of Geosciences.

===Rankings===
For its 2022-2023 ranking, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked Alfred University tied for #48 in Regional Universities North.

==Museums and galleries==
Alfred University and The New York State College of Ceramics (NYSCC) are associated with five galleries: Alfred Ceramic Art Museum, The Cohen Center for the Arts Gallery, The Fosdick-Nelson Gallery, Robert C. Turner Gallery, and Institute for Electronic Art&#x27;s (IEA) John Woods Studios. Other exhibition spaces for undergraduate and graduate students to show work include the Sculpture Dimensional Studies Exhibition Spaces (the Cube, the Box and the Cell Space), the Printmaking Critique Room, Flex Space, the New Deal, and Rhodes Room.

===The Robert C. Turner Gallery===
Alfred University&#x27;s student-run gallery, the Robert C. Turner Gallery, was refurbished in 2011 during a building improvement project. The gallery was once a unique space that hosted undergraduate experimental shows with a loose criteria that encouraged experimentation. The gallery now has two floors; the main space and the catwalk, which also has a &quot;black box&quot; interactive space for expanded (electronic) media. This gallery space is named after internationally acclaimed artist and Alfred University alumnus, Robert C. Turner, a former professor of ceramic art at Alfred University with a sixty-year-long career in ceramics.

===IEA John Wood Studios===
NYSCC is host to the John Wood Studios of the Institute of Electronic Arts (IEA) within the School of Art and Design (SoAD), NYSCC which offers a residency program for up to two weeks for international artists.

==Student life==
===Current student organizations===
As of 2020, Alfred has over 80 student organizations and clubs. There are three main media organizations on campus; &quot;AUTV&quot;, the &quot;Fiat Lux&quot; newspaper, and the WALF 89.7FM radio station. The student-run yearbook, the Kanakadea, ceased publication in 2014. Notable extracurricular clubs include the Student Activities Board, Forest People, and Art Force Five.

AU has been granted chapters of a number of honor societies, including Phi Beta Kappa (the Alpha Gamma chapter of New York, granted in 2004), Phi Kappa Phi, and Alpha Lambda Delta; Alfred also has chapters of the service societies Alpha Phi Omega and Omicron Delta Kappa. Other honor societies include Alpha Iota Delta, Beta Gamma Sigma, Delta Mu Delta, Omicron Delta Epsilon, Pi Gamma Mu, Pi Mu Epsilon (the Alpha Iota chapter of New York, chartered in 2002), Pi Sigma Alpha, Sigma Tau Delta, Tau Beta Pi, Phi Alpha Theta, Phi Sigma Iota, Psi Chi, Keramos, and the Financial Management Association.

===Greek social organizations===

Fraternities and sororities were established at Alfred University for nearly 100 years prior to 2002, when they were discontinued, partially in response to the death of Zeta Beta Tau (ZBT) fraternity member Benjamin Klein under suspicious circumstances and charges of gross negligence on behalf of the fraternity.

In 1978, prior to Klein&#x27;s death, student Chuck Stenzel died in a hazing-related incident at Alfred&#x27;s Klan Alpine fraternity. After Stenzel&#x27;s death, his mother, Eileen Stevens, created a lobbying organization to increase awareness of hazing and promote anti-hazing laws, as documented in Hank Nuwer&#x27;s book &quot;Broken Pledges&quot; and a later TV movie of the same name (in which Alfred was not named for legal reasons). Stevens later served as an advisor to Alfred on hazing-related issues, and received an honorary doctorate from the school in 1999.

During the summer of 2002, all Greek social organizations lost recognition after an in-depth analysis of the Alfred University Greek system by an eight-member task force appointed by the board of trustees. More than 50% of the task force were themselves members of a fraternity or sorority while in college, and 82% of the board of trustees are Alfred University alumni.

While Alfred University has banned fraternities and sororities, Alfred State College has not, and these organizations remain active within the village of Alfred.

===Athletics===

Alfred teams participate as a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association&#x27;s Division III, with the exception of alpine skiing which is governed by the USCSA and the equestrian team which is governed by the IHSA. The Saxons are a member of the Empire 8 Athletic Conference (Empire 8). They compete in the following sports: alpine skiing, basketball, cross country, equestrian, football, lacrosse, soccer, swimming and diving, tennis, and track and field, women&#x27;s volleyball, and women&#x27;s softball.

On July 15, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Empire 8 Conference postponed all fall sports. Sports have since resumed operating as normal.

<text>Sidney Sheldon (February 11, 1917 – January 30, 2007) was an American writer. He was prominent in the 1930s, first working on Broadway plays, and then in motion pictures, notably writing the successful comedy &quot;The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer&quot; (1947), which earned him an Oscar in 1948. He went on to work in television, where over twenty years he created &quot;The Patty Duke Show&quot; (1963–66), &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot; (1965–70), and &quot;Hart to Hart&quot; (1979–84). After turning 50, he began writing best-selling romantic suspense novels, such as &quot;Master of the Game&quot; (1982), &quot;The Other Side of Midnight&quot; (1973), and &quot;Rage of Angels&quot; (1980). 

Sheldon&#x27;s novels have sold over 300 million copies in 51 languages. Sheldon is consistently cited as one of the top ten best-selling fiction writers of all time.

Sheldon was born Sidney Schechtel in Chicago, Illinois. His parents, of Ukrainian Jewish ancestry, were Ascher &quot;Otto&quot; Schechtel (1894–1967), manager of a jewelry store, and Natalie Marcus. At age 10, Sidney made his first sale, $5 for a poem. During the Great Depression, he worked at a variety of jobs, and after graduating from East High School in Denver, Colorado, he attended Northwestern University on a scholarship, and contributed short plays to drama groups. He had to drop out after six months to help support his family. Sheldon enlisted in the military during World War II as a pilot in the War Training Service, a branch of the Army Air Corps. His unit was disbanded, but he was discharged because of a recurring slipped disc before he was deployed.

==Career==
In 1937, Sheldon moved to Hollywood, where he reviewed scripts and collaborated on a number of B movies.

=== Broadway ===
Sheldon began writing musicals for the Broadway stage while continuing to write screenplays for both MGM Studios and Paramount Pictures. He earned a reputation as a prolific writer; for example, at one time, Ben Roberts and he had three musicals on Broadway - a rewritten &quot;The Merry Widow&quot;, &quot;Jackpot&quot;, and &quot;Dream with Music&quot;. Sheldon received a Tony Award in 1959 for his musical &quot;Redhead&quot;, starring Gwen Verdon. His other stage plays include &quot;Alice in Arms&quot;, &quot;The King of New York&quot;, &quot;The Judge&quot;, and &quot;Roman Candle&quot;. Only &quot;Roman Candle&quot; has been published as a book. The play &quot;Gomes&quot; was performed only in London and not on Broadway.

=== Film ===
Sheldon&#x27;s success on Broadway brought him back to Hollywood, where his first assignment was &quot;The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer&quot;, which earned him the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay in 1947. He was one of the writers on the screenplay for the 1948 musical film &quot;Easter Parade&quot; and sole writer for the 1950 musical film &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;, both of which featured the songs of Irving Berlin. Some of his other writing credits include &quot;South of Panama&quot;; &quot;Gambling Daughters&quot;; &quot;Dangerous Lady&quot;; &quot;Borrowed Hero&quot;; &quot;Mr. District Attorney in the Carter Case&quot;; &quot;Fly-by-Night&quot;; &quot;She&#x27;s in the Army&quot;; &quot;Nancy Goes to Rio&quot;; &quot;Three Guys Named Mike&quot;; &quot;No questions asked&quot;; &quot;Rich, Young and Pretty&quot;; &quot;Just This Once&quot;; &quot;Remains to be Seen&quot;; &quot;Dream Wife&quot; (directed as well); &quot;You&#x27;re Never Too Young&quot;; &quot;The Birds and the Bees&quot;; &quot;Anything Goes&quot;; &quot;Pardners&quot;; &quot;The Buster Keaton Story&quot; (directed as well); &quot;All in a Night&#x27;s Work&quot;; and &quot;Billy Rose&#x27;s Jumbo&quot;.

=== Television ===
When television became the new popular medium, Sheldon decided to try his hand in it. &quot;I suppose I needed money,&quot; he remembered. &quot;I met Patty Duke one day at lunch. So I produced &quot;The Patty Duke Show&quot;, and I did something nobody else in TV ever did. For seven years, I wrote almost every single episode of the series.&quot;

After seeing Duke&#x27;s performance as Helen Keller in &quot;The Miracle Worker&quot; (1962), Sheldon cast the actress as the two sitcom leads, identical cousins, Patty and Cathy Lane. Following the show&#x27;s success, Sheldon had signed an agreement with Screen Gems to handle the development of various television series.

In 1965, Sheldon created, produced, and wrote &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot; starring Barbara Eden and Larry Hagman. He wrote all but two dozen scripts in five years, sometimes using three pseudonyms (Mark Rowane, Allan Devon, and Christopher Golato) while simultaneously writing scripts for &quot;The Patty Duke Show&quot;. He later said that he did this because he felt his name was appearing too often in the credits as creator, producer, copyright owner, and writer of these series.

Production for &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot; ended in 1970 after five seasons. &quot;During the last year of &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;, I decided to try a novel,&quot; he said in 1982. &quot;Each morning from 9 until noon, I had a secretary at the studio take all calls. I mean every single call. I wrote each morning — or rather, dictated — and then I faced the TV business.&quot;

In 1970, Sheldon wrote all 17 episodes of the short-lived series &quot;Nancy&quot;.

In 1979, Sheldon created and wrote for the series &quot;Hart to Hart&quot; starring Robert Wagner and Stefanie Powers. The show aired on ABC and ran for five seasons.

=== Novels ===
In 1969, Sheldon wrote his first novel, &quot;The Naked Face&quot;, which earned him a nomination for the Edgar Allan Poe Award from the Mystery Writers of America in the category of Best First Novel. His next novel, &quot;The Other Side of Midnight&quot;, climbed to number one on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list, as did several ensuing novels, a number of which were also made into motion pictures or TV miniseries. His novels often featured determined women who persevere in a tough world run by hostile men. The novels contained suspense and devices to keep the reader turning the page:

Most of his readers were women. Asked why this was the case, he said: &quot;I like to write about women who are talented and capable, but most important, retain their femininity. Women have tremendous power — their femininity, because men can&#x27;t do without it.&quot; Books were Sheldon&#x27;s favorite medium. &quot;I love writing books,&quot; he commented. &quot;Movies are a collaborative medium, and everyone is second-guessing you. When you do a novel, you&#x27;re on your own. It&#x27;s a freedom that doesn&#x27;t exist in any other medium.&quot; He was the author of 18 novels, which have sold over 300 million copies.

Three years before his death, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called Sheldon &quot;Mr. Blockbuster&quot; and &quot;prince of potboilers.&quot;

==Personal life==
Sheldon was first married to Jane Kaufman Harding (1945–1946). Later, he wrote, &quot;Regretfully, in less than a month, Jane and I realized we had made a mistake. We spent the next nine months trying in vain to make the marriage work.&quot;

He was married for thirty years to Jorja Curtright, a stage and film actress, who later became an interior designer. She played Suzanne in the 1955 film, &quot;Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing&quot;, and appeared as Madame Zolta in season one of &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot; in episode 25, &quot;Bigger Than a Bread Box&quot;. Curtright died of a heart attack in 1985. Their daughter, Mary Sheldon, became a novelist as well.

Sheldon married Alexandra Joyce Kostoff, a former child actress, in Las Vegas in 1989.

Sheldon struggled with bipolar disorder for years; he contemplated suicide at 17 (talked out of it by his father, who found him with a bottle of whiskey and several bottles of sleeping pills), as detailed in his autobiography published in 2005, &quot;The Other Side of Me&quot;.

==Death==
A resident of Palm Springs, California, Sheldon died on January 30, 2007, of pneumonia at Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage, California, twelve days before his 90th birthday. His remains were cremated; the ashes were interred in Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery.

==Awards==
Sheldon won an Academy Award for Writing Original Screenplay (1947) for &quot;The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer&quot; and a Tony Award (1959) for his musical &quot;Redhead&quot;, and was nominated for an Emmy Award for his work on &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;, an NBC sitcom. Sheldon was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1988 had a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars dedicated to him in 1994. In 1990, Sheldon received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

<doc id="345577" wikidata="Q1157828" url="?curid=345577" title="Great Sheffield Flood">
<text>The Great Sheffield Flood was a flood that devastated parts of Sheffield, England, on 11 March 1864, when the Dale Dyke Dam broke as its reservoir was being filled for the first time. At least 240 people died and more than 600 houses were damaged or destroyed by the flood. The immediate cause was a crack in the embankment, the cause of which was never determined. The dam&#x27;s failure led to reforms in engineering practice, setting standards on specifics that needed to be met when constructing such large-scale structures. The dam was rebuilt in 1875.

==Dale Dyke Dam==

Sheffield is a city and subdivision of South Yorkshire, England. As the town industrialised, its population grew from 45,478 in 1801 to 185,157 in 1861. This rapid population growth resulted in greatly increased demand for water, which led to the construction of the Dale Dyke Dam for the purpose of providing a more efficient source of clean water. It was created by the Sheffield Waterworks Company. During the late 1850s, the company purchased land in the Loxley Valley to the north-west of the town, on which to build a reservoir. By the 1860s the dam and its associated works had been passed as satisfactory and it was allowed to fill with water.

== Collapse of Dale Dyke Dam ==
On the night of 11 March 1864, assisted by a strong south-western gale, the newly built dam, known as the Dale Dyke Dam in Bradfield Dale near Low Bradfield on the River Loxley, collapsed while it was being filled for the first time. An estimated 3 million cubic metres (700 million imperial gallons) of water swept down the Loxley Valley, through Loxley Village and on to Malin Bridge and Hillsborough, where the River Loxley joins the River Don. The flood continued south down the Don into Sheffield centre, around the eastward bend of the Don at Lady&#x27;s Bridge, then to Attercliffe, past the sites of what later became Don Valley Stadium, Sheffield Arena and Meadowhall Centre, and on to Rotherham. A wall of water moved swiftly down the valley, destroying everything in its course. The centre of the town, situated on the hill to the south, escaped damage, but the densely populated district of the Wicker, around the new railway viaduct (constructed by the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway), was completely destroyed.

The waterworks company&#x27;s consultant engineer, John Towlerton Leather, was one of a family of worthy Yorkshire engineers who were involved in such work. His uncle, George Leather, had been responsible for reservoirs around Leeds and Bradford, and one of these was the scene of a dramatic collapse, in 1852, when 81 people died. John Leather and resident engineer John Gunson were working closely together during the construction of the dam. Leather designed the dam and oversaw its construction whereas Gunson directed and supervised the construction of the dam. Gunson was on site the night of the collapse and stated that there was a concerning crack in the outer slope of the embankment. Gunson convinced himself that the crack was not harmful but still took the precaution of opening up the valves on the middle of the embankment to allow more water through. This failed to prevent the crack from worsening.

==Aftermath==
The mayor, Thomas Jessop, quickly set up a relief fund and help was provided for the homeless and needy. Sheffield was quickly supplied with aid wherever needed. The mayor ordered a meeting &quot;For the purpose of considering and adopting such measures as may be deemed necessary to meet sufferings occasioned by this dreadful calamity&quot;, raising over £4,000. On 18 March 1864 the mayor called another meeting, but this time it was for anyone who could afford it to give up one day&#x27;s wage to give to those in need. A relief committee was created, and in total over £42,000 was raised.

The company denied any problems relating to their structure and design of the dam, and believed that the cause of the crack and the collapse involved a landslide or landslip. Public perception, informed by the Coroner&#x27;s court and the press, saw the collapse as due to a failure in the mode of construction of the dam. The professional inquiry was conducted, and progressed to parliamentary investigations and institutional deliberations. The experts could not agree about the causes of the Dale Dyke collapse. They noted that even with the cracks the collapse of the whole dam was unforeseeable. The corporation had found two men who either were or were becoming president and then found five other engineers, all of whom had already been or about to become presidents of the Civils. They thought that on the basis of landslipping they would pardon the Sheffield Waterworks Company from any carelessness and that the collapse of the Dale Dyke Dam was an unpredictable accident. They continued:

We are moreover of the opinion that all the arrangements made by your engineers were such as might have been reasonably expected to have proved sufficient for the purposes for which they were intended and that, if the ground beneath the bank had not moved, this work would have been as safe and as perfect as the other five or six large reservoirs of the company which have so long supplied the town of Sheffield and the rivers Rivelin, Loxley and Don with water.

As for the physical damage in Sheffield and all the nearby areas hit in this short space of time, 238 people died and some 700 animals were drowned; 130 buildings were destroyed and 500 partially damaged; 15 bridges were swept away and six others badly damaged. The engineering profession at this time possessed a weekly magazine, &quot;The Engineer&quot;, that provided both an excellent contribution to the technical press and a platform of public relations. An editorial headed &quot;The Bradfield Reservoir&quot; on 18 March 1864 reflected the anxiety of the moment:

Its fall, coupled with that of the failure of the Holmfirth reservoir ... show that the practice of civil engineering is far from what it should be ... That the forthcoming investigation will be of the most searching character there can be no doubt.

A fortnight later, under the same title, it went on:

The broken dam was constructed much according to the ordinary practice in such works. It failed nonetheless ...That the Bradfield dam was lamentably defective no one can doubt ... The Bradfield catastrophe, in its way, is a useful warning to the whole profession.

The claims for damages formed one of the largest insurance claims of the Victorian period.

==Rebuilding==
The collapse of the Dale Dyke Dam led to reforms in engineering practice. The court criticised the design and the construction of the dam. They focused on things such as the placing of the outlet pipes; the puddle wall thickness; the method by which the embankment had been built up from railway tip-wagons; the inadequacy of the overflow arrangements; and the practice of removing spoil for the embankment from the area to be flooded. This then set standards on specifics that needed to be met when constructing such large-scale structures as the Dale Dyke Dam. The Dale Dyke Dam was eventually rebuilt in 1875, but on a smaller scale. As for John Gunson, most of the blame fell on him, although the company recognised his loyalty by retaining him in its service until he died in 1886. The Government started a Board of Inundation Commissioners to pass judgement for compensation claims against the Waterworks Company. They also arbitrated 7,500 claims for loss of life and property which totalled £455,000. All but 650 claims were settled without recourse to the arbitration process, but those 650 claims took almost six months to process. The claims registers record the claimant, their marital status and address, as well as details of the claim and the outcome, and amount awarded in compensation. They provide a unique insight into mid-Victorian Sheffield&#x27;s trade and industry with claims listed for stock, tools and premises damaged and lost. The claims for furniture, clothes, books, toys and household utensils and goods help build up a picture of workers&#x27; lives at the time. A flood memorial stone marks the site of the original dam wall and footpaths to explore the area.

==150th anniversary==
March 2014 saw the 150th anniversary of the disaster. Events took place to commemorate the occasion, including an illustrated talk and exhibition at Low Bradfield Village Hall, guided walks to the dam, memorial services at St Nicholas, High Bradfield and St Polycarps, Malin Bridge, and a public talk at the University of Sheffield by the Institution of Civil Engineers and the British Dam Society. A commemorative tankard and plate were produced by the Bradfield Historical Society, and the Bradfield Brewery produced a special &quot;flood beer&quot; known as &quot;Dam It&quot;. The duo Toffee Music recorded a CD of Great Sheffield Flood songs.

<text>Patrick Walter Meik (1851 - 12 July 1910) was an English civil engineer and part of a minor dynasty. His father Thomas Meik was also an engineer, as was his younger brother Charles Meik.

==Early career==
Both boys were born in Crowtree Road, Bishopwearmouth, Sunderland. Meik was educated at King’s College School, London, and at the University of Edinburgh, after which he joined his father&#x27;s practice for three years&#x27; pupillage from 1868 to 1871. He then worked for John Aird &amp; Co., employed on projects including the East London Waterworks at Sunbury and the Imperial Gasworks at Bromley.

==Later career==
In 1873, Meik went to work for his father and worked on Meik&#x27;s harbours at Burntisland (where he was resident engineer on the West Dock) and at Bo&#x27;ness on the River Forth in Scotland before being asked by Sir Benjamin Baker to be resident engineer (1882–1885) on the foundations and piers of the Forth Bridge (designed by Baker and Sir John Fowler). After this project, he moved to London and set up an office for his father&#x27;s engineering practice, now known as Thomas Meik and Sons. He worked on a rail project at Lee-on-the-Solent during this time.

In 1894, he was joined by his brother Charles and together they worked on a major commission to construct docks and a railway at Port Talbot, followed by an equally ambitious scheme to expand the port of Seaham, officially opened in 1905, and the King’s Dock at Swansea, which was opened in 1909. The Meiks&#x27; expertise saw port and railway designs developed in many parts of the British Empire, including Christmas Island, India, Singapore, Burma (the Rangoon River training works – where Patrick worked with Sir George Buchanan) and Mozambique.

In the 1900s, their firm was commissioned to design the Kinlochleven hydroelectric scheme in the Scottish Highlands. William Halcrow joined the company and took up the position of assistant resident engineer at the Kinlochleven project. The Meik brothers&#x27; engineering practice was later renamed CS Meik and Halcrow and became one of the world&#x27;s foremost engineering consultancies, the Halcrow Group (in 2005, the Edinburgh office of the Halcrow group bought Forth Bridge drawings originally created by Patrick Meik over 120 years earlier).

Patrick Meik died in London in 1910, mourned as &quot;an able and accomplished engineer: whose kindness of heart and social qualities endeared him to a large circle of friends&quot;.

<text>Darnall ward—which includes the districts of Attercliffe, Carbrook, Darnall, Tinsley, and parts of [[Handsworth, South Yorkshire|Handsworth]]—is one of the 28 electoral wards in City of Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England. It is located in the eastern part of the city and covers an area of 17.4 km2. The population of this ward in 2011 was 23,489 people in 8,809 households. It is one of the wards that made up the Sheffield Attercliffe constituency, now the Sheffield South East constituency.

==Districts of Darnall ward==
===Attercliffe===

Attercliffe () is an industrial suburb of northeast Sheffield.

Attercliffe stretches from the edge of the city centre of Sheffield to Carbrook.

Back in the 1880s, the district was populated by small terraced houses and a shopping area which stretched for over 3 miles along Attercliffe Road, Attercliffe Common and Sheffield Road towards Tinsley.

Remnants of this era still stand with the John Banner building, an early multi floor department store located on Attercliffe Road. Other buildings include the Adelphi cinema, Attercliffe Baths, Burton Building, Carbrook Hall and Attercliffe Church - a small building easy to miss tucked back from the main road into the city centre.

As for industry, Tinsley Wire and many other steelworks and light industrial companies survived alongside residential and small retail.

During the December 1940 a German bombing campaign devastated the city centre of Sheffield. Attercliffe was also badly destroyed with destruction from the city centre across to Tinsley canal locks. It took until the 1990s rebuilding of the old residential area to re-use the former area of the district affected by this historic incident.

Traditional areas of Attercliffe now house an interesting mix of old established industry, Adult stores, carpet warehouses and discount stores - including the old John Banner building. Towards the east end of Attercliffe, the area has been regenerated with medium-sized business and a few remaining large steelworks.

===Carbrook===
Carbrook () is an industrial area of Sheffield, to the north-east of Brightside.

=== Darnall ===

Darnall () is a suburb of eastern Sheffield.

=== Tinsley ===
Tinsley () is a district in the northeastern part of Sheffield.

=== Meadowhall ===

&#x27;Meadowhall&#x27; is the name of a large shopping centre in the Darnall ward.()

<text>Dunford Bridge is a remote hamlet in the civil parish of Dunford, in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, England, from the border with West Yorkshire and from the border with Derbyshire. It lies in the Peak District, west of Penistone and south of Holmfirth, within the Metropolitan Borough of Barnsley. Before the Local Government Act 1972 the area covered by South Yorkshire was part of the West Riding of Yorkshire.

The settlement, consisting of a few houses, lies beneath the Winscar Reservoir. Water draining from the moorland around Grains Moss forms small rivers that join together to form the source of the River Don, which feeds into the reservoir. The reservoir had suffered from leakage for many years, until Yorkshire Water, the reservoir owners, employed a construction company to correct the problem, using £400,000 worth of specialist grouting and artificial membrane.

The eastern end of the Woodhead Tunnel is in the centre of the hamlet. The site of the former railway station is now a parking area with the old rail line forming the route of the Trans-Pennine Trail.

In 1974 the two terraces of railway cottages at the eastern tunnel portal, comprising 19 houses, were bought by the Lifespan Educational Trust to establish a commune based on the principles of Summerhill School. The Lifespan Community Collective, which set up a registered housing cooperative and in 1976 opened a wholefood shop in Huddersfield (the cooperative was dissolved in 1987). In the 1980s the community launched a worker cooperative in printing and publishing. The community continues today with about 20 residents; it farms according to permaculture principles and produces the quarterly &quot;Communes Network&quot; magazine.

The Stanhope Arms Public House (former hunting Lodge belonging to the Stanhope Family) was the only public house in the hamlet of Dunford Bridge. The Stanhope Arms closed down in the early 2000s. It was used as a theatrical and drama training workshop for a short time afterwards but has been a private residence since 2015.

Windle Edge Road leads 1.5 miles southwest from the hamlet to the Woodhead PassA628 and northeast to the B6106 Holmfirth to Penistone road. The A628 gives access westwards to the M67 and Manchester and east to the M1 at Barnsley, and southeast to the A616 and Northern Sheffield.

Dunford Bridge is a centre for watersports enthusiasts. It benefits from walkers exploring the Pennine moorland surrounding the hamlet, using it as a base. There is a car parking area next to the road bridge and further parking along the side of the Winscar Reservoir on Dunford Road, to the north. The reservoir is used by a local sailing club.

On 15 September 2015 the National Grid announced a plan to bury underground electricity cables and remove seven overhead pylons from the village. This was completed in October 2022 when the pylons were removed.

<doc id="345597" wikidata="Q123857" url="?curid=345597" title="Christoph Blocher">
<text>Christoph Wolfram Blocher (; born 11 October 1940) is a Swiss industrialist and politician who served as a Member of the Swiss Federal Council from 2004 to 2007. A member of the Swiss People&#x27;s Party (SVP/UDC), he headed the Federal Department of Justice and Police. As an industrialist, he became wealthy as CEO and majority shareholder in the EMS-Chemie corporation, now run by his daughter, Magdalena Martullo-Blocher.

A controversial figure, Blocher is known for his role in transforming Swiss politics, shifting it to the right, as well as the Swiss People&#x27;s Party, which has become &quot;the dominant force in national politics&quot;. As he &quot;developed a eurosceptic and anti-immigration agenda that has shaken up the cozy post-war consensual system prevailing in neutral Switzerland&quot;, Blocher served as the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the SVP and a symbol of the party, holding its vice presidency from 2008 until 2018.

==Early life==
Blocher was born 11 October 1940 in Schaffhausen, Switzerland, the seventh of eleven children, to Wolfram (1897–1972) and Ida (née Baur; 1908–1994). He primarily grew-up in Laufen-Uhwiesen and later in Kilchberg. His father was a pastor and his mother a homemaker. His second great-grandfather Johann Georg Blocher (1811–1899), a teacher, originally hailed from Beuggen near Rheinfelden in the Kingdom of Württemberg and immigrated to Switzerland around 1833, becoming a citizen in the village of Schattenhalb in the Bernese Alps, in 1861.

Blocher served in the Swiss military as an Aerial Defense Regiment Commander and Colonel. Blocher earned a certificate at the Wülflingen school of agriculture. In 1961, Blocher began studying independently for the Swiss Matura. In 1963, Blocher completed and passed the exams for the Swiss Matura, and in 1964, he passed an additional exam in Latin to pursue legal studies at university. He then studied law at the University of Zürich, in Montpellier, and in Paris. He has a DEA degree in law, and in 1971, he was awarded a doctorate in jurisprudence from the University of Zürich.

While at the University of Zürich, Blocher co-founded the Students&#x27; Ring, which opposed the 1968 student protests and the left-wing politics on university campuses.

==Business career==
Blocher started working at EMS-Chemie in 1969 as a student in its legal department. In 1972, Blocher was voted Chairman of the Board and CEO of the company, and in 1983, he purchased a majority of EMS-Chemie.

When Blocher was voted into the Swiss Federal Council in 2003, he retired from all business functions in EMS and sold his majority holding to his four children on 30 December 2003. Blocher&#x27;s oldest daughter, Magdalena Martullo-Blocher, became CEO of EMS on 1 January 2004.

In 2014, Blocher bought shares of the newspaper &quot;Basler Zeitung&quot; and then bought the free newspaper &quot;Zehnder&quot;.

In 2018, the magazine &quot;Bilanz&quot; estimated the Blocher family&#x27;s fortune to be between 10 and 11 billion Swiss francs, placing it among the ten wealthiest families in Switzerland.

==Political career==
Blocher built his political career by campaigning for smaller government, for a free-market economy, against Switzerland&#x27;s membership in the European Union and for more tightly controlled immigration. He stated he entered the political arena by chance due to a local zoning dispute. Blocher joined the SVP in 1972 and became the SVP president of the SVP chapter in Meilen in 1974. After being elected to the Cantonal Council of Zürich in 1975, Blocher was elected to the Swiss National Council and represented the canton of Zürich there from 25 November 1979 until his election to the federal council on 12 December 2003 as a deputy of the Swiss People&#x27;s Party (Schweizerische Volkspartei/Union démocratique du centre; SVP/UDC), and then again from 4 December 2011 to 30 May 2014.

In addition to leading the Zürich chapter of the Swiss People&#x27;s Party, Blocher was a cofounder of the Action for an Independent and Neutral Switzerland (&quot;Aktion für eine unabhängige und neutrale Schweiz&quot;), and he served as the president of the organization from its foundation in 1986 until his election to the Federal Council in 2003.

In 1982, Blocher founded &quot;Arbeitsgruppe Südliches Afrika&quot;, a pro-South Africa working group made up of Swiss members of parliament, such as Ulrich Schlüer. According to a Swiss government-funded research study authored by historian Peter Hug, records of the South African military intelligence agency show that the agency valued contact with Blocher, Peter Sager and other Swiss figures to create a positive view of Apartheid South Africa.

When Blocher was elected president of the Zürich SVP in 1977, he declared his intent to oversee significant change in the political line of the Zürich SVP, bringing an end to debates that aimed to open the party up to a wide array of opinions. Blocher soon consolidated his power in Zürich, and began to renew the organisational structures, activities, campaigning style and political agenda of the local branch. The young members of the party were boosted with the establishment of a cantonal Young SVP (JSVP) in 1977, as well as political training courses. The ideology of the Zürich branch was also reinforced, and the rhetoric hardened, which resulted in the best election result for the Zürich branch in fifty years in the 1979 federal election, with an increase from 11.3% to 14.5%. This was contrasted with the stable level in the other cantons, although the support also stagnated in Zürich through the 1980s.

The struggle that existed between the SVP&#x27;s largest branches of Bern and Zürich continued into the early 1990s. While the Bern-oriented faction represented the old moderate style of the SVP, the Zürich-oriented wing led by Blocher represented a new radical right-wing populist agenda. The Zürich wing began to politicise asylum issues, and the question of European integration started to dominate Swiss political debates. They also adopted more confrontational methods.
The Zürich-wing subsequently started to gain ground in the party at the expense of the Bern-wing, and the party became increasingly centralised as a national party, in contrast to the traditional Swiss system of parties with loose organisational structures and weak central powers. During the 1990s, the party also doubled its number of cantonal branches (to eventually be represented in all cantons), which strengthened the power of the Zürich-wing since most new sections supported their agenda. Although Swiss political parties tended to lack dominant national leaders, Blocher became the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the national SVP and one of the most famous Swiss politicians.

In 1991, the party for the first time became the strongest party in Zürich, with 20.2% of the vote. It also broke through in the early 1990s in both Zürich and Switzerland as a whole, and experienced dramatically increasing results in elections. From being the smallest of the four governing parties at the start of the 1990s, the party by the end of the decade emerged as the strongest party in Switzerland. At the same time, the party expanded its electoral base towards new voter demographics. The SVP in general won its best results in cantons where the cantonal branches adopted the agenda of the Zürich wing. In the 1999 federal election, the SVP for the first time became the strongest party in Switzerland with 22.5% of the vote, a 12.6% share increase. This was the biggest increase of votes for any party in the entire history of the Swiss proportional electoral system, which was introduced in 1919.

===Libel incident===
In 1997 a speech, Blocher stated &quot;The Jewish organizations that demand money, claim that ultimately it is not about money. But let&#x27;s be honest: This is exactly what it is about.&quot; These remarks were in relation to a World Jewish Congress-initiated lawsuit calling for restitution of Nazi-seized assets that were hidden in Swiss banks. The following day, the tabloid &quot;Sonntags-Blick&quot; published an article with the headline &quot;Blocher: The Jews are all about money.&quot; Blocher filed for libel against the editor-in-chief of the tabloid. The district court acquitted the journalist because Blocher &quot;unrestrainedly addressed anti-Semitic instincts.&quot; Blocher appealed the verdict. Before the Zürich supreme court, the two parties agreed on a settlement. Later the chairman of the 4th bureau of the Zürich district court filed a criminal complaint against Blocher on the grounds that the preoccupation with the speech had let them believe that Blocher had violated the law on racism. The district court requested to lift the immunity of Blocher, which he enjoyed through his office as a member of the National Council. Both chambers of the parliament denied the request.

==Federal councillor==
===2003 election===

The People&#x27;s Party emerged as the largest party in the National Council in the Federal Assembly election of 19 October 2003 with 26.6% of the vote. Blocher personally topped the poll in Zürich, and became Switzerland&#x27;s most prominent and controversial politician.

Since 1929, the People&#x27;s Party (known until 1971 as the Party of Farmers, Traders and Independents [BGB]) had held a seat on the seven-member Swiss Federal Council. At the time the current coalition formed in 1959, the BGB was the smallest party represented on the Council. By 2003 it had become the largest party, and demanded another seat at the expense of the Christian Democrats, now the smallest party. The SVP nominated Blocher as its second candidate. This generated a good deal of controversy; previously most SVP councillors had come from the party&#x27;s more moderate centrist-agrarian wing.

After threats of pulling the other People&#x27;s Party member, Samuel Schmid (a member of the centrist wing), off the council and going into opposition, Blocher was elected on 10 December 2003. He took the seat of Ruth Metzler-Arnold, only the third federal councillor in history (and the first since 1872) not to be reelected.

In the third round Blocher beat Metzler with 121 to 116 votes. The election was anticipated as a major media event and widely watched as a live broadcast. After Blocher&#x27;s election, members of the Swiss political Left spontaneously protested.

As a result of a reshuffling of Federal Council seats, Blocher became head of the Federal Department of Justice and Police.

===Controversies===
During 2004, Blocher&#x27;s unconventionally unaccommodating stance towards his fellow federal councillors was the cause for speculations about the future of the Swiss concordance system. He was attacked by his colleague Pascal Couchepin in an interview with the NZZ newspaper in the Sunday edition of 3 October. This was unprecedented in Switzerland; members of the Federal Council traditionally do not publicly criticise each other.

In a public speech held at his cantonal party&#x27;s annual &quot;Albisgüetlitagung&quot; in Zürich on 20 January 2006, Blocher labeled two Albanians seeking political asylum as &quot;criminals&quot;, although no judicial verdict had been reached at the time. Later, when confronted, he claimed before the Swiss Council of States (the upper house) that he had only used the word &#x27;accused&#x27;. Since the speech had been recorded, he then had to admit that he had used the word &quot;criminals&quot;. In July 2006, a commission of the Council of States reprimanded Blocher, stating that the setting of false prejudice and making false statement to the Council of States constituted unacceptable behaviour for a Federal Councillor.

On 5 September 2007, a parliamentary committee sharply criticised Blocher for overstepping his mandate in his handling of the resignation of former chief prosecutor Valentin Roschacher in 2006. In addition, documents confiscated in March by the German authorities from private banker Oskar Holenweger under suspicion of money laundering were presented as supporting a possible involvement of Blocher in a plot to oust Roschacher from office. Blocher denied any involvement in such a plan. These developments happened to coincide with a campaign alleging a &quot;secret plan to oust Blocher&quot; initiated by the SVP on 27 August, and party spokesperson S. R. Jäggi on 6 September confirmed that campaign was referring to the documents incriminating Blocher in the Roschacher affair now revealed. Tension surrounding the &quot;Blocher-Roschacher affair&quot; was fuelled by the upcoming 2007 federal election. On 25 September, the National Council (the lower house) decided to press a debate of the affair before the elections, overturning a decision by the council&#x27;s office.

Blocher was a target for the opposition on 18 September 2007, when his appearance at the &quot;Comptoir suisse&quot; (Swiss fair) in Lausanne was disrupted by protesters.

In January 2012, it was reported that Blocher had received information from an unnamed whistleblower regarding foreign exchange trades at Bank Sarasin made by Swiss National Bank chairman Philipp Hildebrand&#x27;s wife Kashya. The alleged whistleblower was subsequently fired and faced criminal investigations under Swiss banking secrecy laws. Hildebrand denied accusations of insider trading, claimed to be the &quot;victim of a smear campaign&quot; and said that his political foes endangered the secrecy laws and &quot;the interests of Switzerland&quot; with the accusations. Blocher had called for Hildebrand&#x27;s resignation in 2011 in the wake of SNB&#x27;s foreign exchange-related losses and continued strong calls after the FX-trades story grew, before Hildebrand ultimately resigned.

===2007 failed reelection===
In the Swiss Federal Council elections of 12 December 2007, Blocher did not receive the necessary number of votes in the parliament to retain his seat. In his stead, the parliament elected Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf (a moderate SVP member), who accepted the mandate on 13 December 2007. Blocher thus became the fourth federal councillor to be ousted from office in the history of the Swiss Federal State, following Ruth Metzler whom he had replaced the previous term, besides Ulrich Ochsenbein and Jean-Jacques Challet-Venel in the 19th century. As of 2024, he is the most recent federal councillor to leave office having never served as president of the Swiss Confederation.

===2008 candidacy===

Following the resignation of federal councillor Samuel Schmid on 12 November 2008, Blocher decided to run for the office again. The People&#x27;s Party nominated him together with Ueli Maurer. In view of the 2007 election results, Blocher&#x27;s chances to be re-elected were thought to be very slim. Not surprisingly, he had no chance of being re-elected and had to make room for his party colleague Ueli Maurer, who won the election in the end.

==Post councillorship==

In 2008, Blocher became one of the five vice presidents of the SVP.

After the extremely large 2007–2008 losses posted by UBS, its chairman Marcel Ospel resigned on 1 April 2008, and Blocher was rumoured to be considered as his replacement. However the role went to Peter Kurer, the bank&#x27;s general counsel.

Blocher was important in the success of the 9 February 2014 referendum on immigration quotas in Switzerland and continues to support policies designed to limit immigration to Switzerland.

Returning to the National Council in 2011, Blocher announced that he would resign on 31 May 2014, saying that he was &quot;wasting too much time in parliament&quot; and that he wanted to focus on other political priorities like the implementation of the successful referendum result and a planned initiative on preventing Switzerland joining the European Union.

In January 2016, soon after the 2015 federal election, where the Swiss People&#x27;s Party received record gains, Blocher announced that he would not stand for reelection as vice president of the SVP when his term ended in April. Despite this, Blocher stated that he would remain involved in politics and would &quot;push his anti-EU and anti-immigration campaigns&quot;, and he would remain in a senior position in the SVP.

Blocher supported the popular initiative &quot;For the effective expulsion of foreign criminals&quot;, held on 28 February 2016, but after its rejection, Blocher urged the SVP to use its position in the government, rather than popular initiatives, to advance its agenda.

In an interview in April 2016, Blocher stated that United States president Ronald Reagan &quot;was the best president I have seen&quot; and that he thought that, like Reagan, then-presidential candidate Donald Trump would be underestimated but more competent and great than expected. After Trump&#x27;s election victory, Blocher stated that his victory was a warning to world leaders not to ignore the people&#x27;s concerns on issues such as immigration, saying &quot;people feel powerless against those who rule them, and for them, Trump is a release valve.&quot;

Blocher continued advocating against Swiss membership in the European Union, and for strengthing Swiss neutrality.

In March 2018, the SVP announced that Blocher would resign as the party&#x27;s chief strategist, though he would continue to remain involved in Swiss politics.

On 19 January 2024, Blocher announced he would retire from politics.

==Public image==
Blocher is seen by some political observers as the face of the SVP, and his presence in the party was a major factor in voter turnout among SVP voters. Damir Skenderovic, professor at the University of Fribourg has compared Blocher to Jörg Haider of the Freedom Party of Austria and Alliance for the Future of Austria, to Carl I. Hagen of the Norwegian Progress Party, and to Umberto Bossi of the Italian Lega Nord. According to Steve Bannon, an American right-wing populist political and media figure, Blocher was &quot;Trump before Trump&quot;, in reference to the 45th U.S. president Donald Trump, because of his early opposition to the European Union.

==Personal life==

On 4 October 1967, Blocher married Silvia Kaiser (born 1945), a primary school teacher, a daughter of Willy and Lony Kaiser, both of Wald, Zürich, in Weinfelden. Her father was the president of a civil engineering firm. They had four children;

* Magdalena Blocher (born 1969), majority shareholder of EMS-Chemie and member of the National Council (Switzerland), married to Roberto Martullo, has three children.
* Markus Blocher (born 1971), businessman and majority shareholder of Dottikon ES, married, has seven children.
* Miriam Blocher (born 1975), businesswoman and majority shareholder of Läckerli Huus, married to Matthias Baumann, has two children.
* Rahel Blocher (born 1976), never married and no children.

Blocher has resided in Feldmeilen since the 1970s until relocating into his newly-built residence &quot;Haus zum Rosenhorn&quot; in Herrliberg in the early 2000s. The house has ever since expanded to a compound which not only is a private residence but also seat to his investment and holding companies and his art collection. The property is named after the Rosenhorn, which is in his place of origin, Schattenhalb.

Additionally, Blocher retains the lifetime right of residence at the Rhäzüns Castle, in Rhäzüns, Grisons, which has been owned by EMS-Chemie since 1946. He restored the castle thoroughly and takes no government subsidies for its maintenance, which nets about $550,000 annually.

Blocher has never owned a television.

<text>High Peak is a local government district with borough status in Derbyshire, England, covering a high moorland plateau in the Dark Peak area of the Peak District National Park. The district stretches from Holme Moss in the north to Sterndale Moor in the south, and from Hague Bar in the west to Bamford in the east. The population of the borough taken at the 2011 Census was 90,892. The borough is unusual in having two administrative centres for its council, High Peak Borough Council; the offices are in Buxton and Glossop. Other towns include Chapel-en-le-Frith, Hadfield, New Mills and Whaley Bridge. 

High Peak was the name of a hundred of the ancient county of Derbyshire covering roughly the same area as the current district. It may have derived its name from the ancient Forest of High Peak, a royal hunting reserve administered by William Peverel, a favourite of William I, who was based at Peak Castle. High Peak contains much of the Peak District National Park. The district contains the highest point in Derbyshire, Kinder Scout, which stands at 636m (2,087 ft) above sea level. Its settlements act as commuter centres for people who work in the surrounding counties and other parts of Derbyshire, owing to its proximity to Cheshire, Greater Manchester, South Yorkshire, Staffordshire and West Yorkshire.

==Creation==
The borough was formed on 1 April 1974, covering the area of six former districts, which were abolished:
*Buxton Municipal Borough
*Chapel-en-le-Frith Rural District 
*Glossop Municipal Borough
*New Mills Urban District 
*Tintwistle Rural District (which had been in the administrative county of Cheshire)
*Whaley Bridge Urban District

==Neighbouring districts==
The borough adjoins the metropolitan boroughs of Sheffield and Barnsley in South Yorkshire, Kirklees in West Yorkshire, the districts of Derbyshire Dales, Cheshire East and Staffordshire Moorlands, and the Stockport, Tameside and Oldham metropolitan boroughs in Greater Manchester. The Metropolitan Borough of Oldham is only bordered by high moorland near Black Hill and is not accessible by road.

==Main settlements==

There are five main areas of settlement in the borough: around Buxton in the south west, around New Mills in the west, around Glossop in the north west, around Whaley Bridge and Chapel-en-le-Frith in the central part of the borough, and the Hope Valley in the east. The northern part of the borough is close to the Manchester urban area.

Settlements in the borough include:
* Ashopton
* Bamford 
* Brough and Shatton
* Buxton

<text>The A82 is a major road in Scotland that runs from Glasgow to Inverness via Fort William. It is one of the principal north-south routes in Scotland and is mostly a trunk road managed by Transport Scotland, who view it as an important link from the Central Belt to the Scottish Highlands and beyond. The road passes close to numerous landmarks, including Loch Lomond, Rannoch Moor, Glen Coe, the Ballachulish Bridge, Ben Nevis, the Commando Memorial, Loch Ness, and Urquhart Castle. Along with the A9 and the A90 it is one of the three major north–south trunk roads connecting the Central Belt to the North.

The route is derived in several places from the military roads constructed through the Highlands by General George Wade and Major William Caulfeild in the 18th century, along with later roads constructed by Thomas Telford in the 19th. The modern route is based on that designed by Telford, but with a number of improvements primarily dating from the 1920s and 30s. These include a diversion across Rannoch Moor, and another around Loch Leven which was subsequently replaced by the Ballachulish Bridge.

Several travel guides have praised individual parts of the road, such as the section from Tyndrum to Glencoe across Rannoch Moor, as providing memorable driving experiences. Tourists find the A82 a popular route because of its scenery, and it serves as a main artery for commercial and heavy goods traffic. Transport Scotland have publicly declared a commitment to improve congestion and safety along the road. Some sections are occasionally closed for maintenance, which has resulted in strong protest from the local community, and the road has been criticised for its poor accident record.

== Route ==

At , the A82 is the second longest A-road in Scotland, after the A9, and has been described as the &quot;slower but more scenic route&quot; of the two. Initial sections of the road were built by General George Wade from 1724 onwards, though much of the current route was constructed by Thomas Telford in the 19th century.

The A82 was one of the first trunk roads, which were created in 1936, and has historically been described in official government documentation as part of the &quot;London – Carlisle – Glasgow – Inverness Trunk Road&quot; in which the A6 and A74 made up the rest of the route. On 1 April 1996, however, the section from Glasgow to the Dalnottar Interchange with the A898 was detrunked. The main length of the A82, as managed by Transport Scotland, is now described in statutory instruments and orders as the &quot;Dalnottar – Inverness Trunk Road&quot;. From Glasgow to Dalnottar, the route is now the responsibility of Glasgow City Council and West Dunbartonshire Council in their respective areas.

The A82 runs through some of the Gaelic-speaking areas in Scotland, known as the Gàidhealtachd. In 2003, the Scottish Government announced that it would install bilingual signs on a number of trunk roads, including the A82 from Tarbet to Inverness. Transport Minister Lewis Macdonald hoped that the signs would improve the tourism experience in the Highlands, as well as improve awareness of Scottish Gaelic.

=== St George&#x27;s Cross – Alexandria ===

The A82 begins in the St George&#x27;s Cross area of central Glasgow, at a junction with the M8 and the A804. From here, it heads in a northwest direction along the Great Western Road for towards Anniesland Cross and passes a number of the city&#x27;s terraces, including Alexander &quot;Greek&quot; Thomson&#x27;s Great Western Terrace, constructed in 1867, and Devonshire Terrace before widening to dual carriageway at Kelvinside. The road here was originally built as a turnpike road in 1816 and widened to its current state in the early 1970s. All the trees along the route were preserved owing to environmental concerns. The Great Western Road has been described by Tam Galbraith as &quot;the most noble entry to any city in Europe.&quot;

The road continues beyond Anniesland Cross as an extension of the Great Western Road, which was constructed between 1922 and 1924, making it easier to widen to dual carriageway in the 1970s than the earlier 19th century section. It approaches a freeflow junction with the A898 from Erskine Bridge and becomes a high quality dual carriageway route through Dumbarton before running to the west of Alexandria and Bonhill on a bypass constructed in the late 1960s. This dual carriageway ends at the Balloch Roundabout near the western shore of Loch Lomond, where the road enters the Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park.

=== Alexandria – Crianlarich ===

The A82 follows the Luss Road along the western shores of the loch, through Arden to Luss. Toward Crianlarich, it follows the general route of the Old Military Road that runs along the shoreline in several places, but it generally keeps some distance to the west. Much of this section of the road was widened to a high quality single carriageway standard over the 1980s, at an estimated cost of £24 million (£ million as of ),
while Luss itself is now bypassed to the west of the village along a single carriageway bypass constructed between 1990 and 1992.

At Tarbet, the A83 branches west to Campbeltown while the A82 continues to the north end of the loch. This part of the road is currently of a lower standard than the sections further south. It is sandwiched between the shoreline of the loch and the mountains to the west, and it runs generally alongside the West Highland Line. The road narrows to less than in places and causes significant problems for heavy goods vehicles (HGVs), which have to negotiate tight bends and the narrow carriageway width. At Pulpit rock, the road was single-track, with traffic flow controlled by traffic lights for over 30 years. The road was widened in 2015 as part of a £9 million improvement programme, including a new viaduct bringing the carriageway width to modern standards.

The north end of the loch is at Ardlui, after which the A82 continues to follow the Highland Line along Glen Falloch, a typical glacial valley, towards Crianlarich. The road runs to the west of Crianlarich village itself on a bypass completed in 2015.

=== Crianlarich – Glencoe ===

The A82 and A85 share the same route for between Crianlarich and Tyndrum. Although Crianlarich has a larger community, Tyndrum is equally well catered for motorists, particularly HGV drivers, and contains the Real Food Cafe, a transport cafe that stays open until 10 p.m. The cafe caters not only to motorists but also to walkers along the West Highland Way.
The A82 enters bleak moorland at the western fringes of Rannoch Moor, to the north of Tyndrum. The road climbs across the moor and reaches a peak height of near Beinn Chaorach, the highest overall point on the A82. It meets the old Military Road near the Kingshouse Hotel next to the River Etive, and the road turns westward past Buachaille Etive Mòr down Glen Coe towards Glencoe village. This section of the A82 has been said to contain some of the most spectacular scenery in Scotland. &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Simon Warren described it as &quot;the most beautiful and spectacular location in the whole of Britain&quot;, though recent concern has been raised over the proliferation of tourist traffic. Coaches and HGVs in particular have caused significant problems with congestion. The road descends the Pass of Glen Coe and crosses the scenic waterfalls at the Meeting of the Three Waters. This section was the location for several outdoor shots in &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot;, including the &quot;Gorge of Eternal Peril&quot; scene. Near the waterfalls is a footpath up to Coire Gabhall, the &quot;lost valley&quot; of Glencoe, where the Clan Donald hid stolen cattle.

The modern A82 splits from Telford&#x27;s route just before the Clachaig Inn, a popular location for tourists due to its proximity to the site of the Massacre of Glencoe, as noted by a sign in the reception that reads, &quot;No hawkers or Campbells&quot;. The A82 runs to the west of the River Coe and passes the modern visitors&#x27; centre before Glencoe village itself.

=== Glencoe – Fort William ===

The A82 continues along the south shore of Loch Leven beyond Glencoe and bypasses Ballachulish to cross the mouth of the loch via the Ballachulish Bridge. This bridge had been proposed since the mid-1960s, and construction began in late 1972 at an estimated cost of £2m (£ million as of ). An arch bridge had been the suggested design, but an asymmetrical N-truss bridge was built instead. A bearing failure on one of the supports caused delays while the rest of the structure was examined to confirm its safety, and it eventually opened in December 1975. It contains individual spans of , and from south to north.

At a roundabout, prior to the rise towards the bridge, the A828 continues south around the coast towards Connel and Oban. Just behind and to the left of the A82, as it commences to cross the bridge, is a monument to the Appin Murder that reads, &quot;Erected in 1911 to the memory of James Stewart of Acharn, or James of the Glen, executed on this spot Nov. 8, 1752, for a crime of which he was not guilty.&quot;

After passing through North Ballachulish and Onich the A82 turns to run northward along the Great Glen, which it continues to do for the remainder of the route up to Inverness. It passes the A861 to the Corran Ferry over to Ardnamurchan in the west. The road here, as it was previously along Loch Lomond, is tightly situated between Loch Linnhe and the mountains up to Fort William, which is located about from the Corran narrows. Various hotels and bed and breakfasts are situated along the road approaching Fort William, indicating the area&#x27;s esteem of tourism.

The route of the old military road (from King&#x27;s House/Altnafeadh on Rannoch Moor via Kinlochleven) rejoins the route of the modern A82, at the West End roundabout, just before the High Street in the town centre. The road follows a brief dual carriageway bypass along the shoreline of the loch before passing the modern station. A branch road runs east through Glen Nevis to Ben Nevis, while the A82 turns to cross the River Nevis. To the north of town the A830 &quot;Road to the Isles&quot; runs west to Glenfinnan and Mallaig.

=== Fort William – Inverness ===

North of Fort Willam, the A82 runs alongside the West Highland Railway through Leanachan Forest towards Spean Bridge. It crosses the River Spean at a bridge constructed by Telford in 1819, but the village is named for the earlier &quot;High Bridge&quot;&#x27; constructed in 1735–36 by George Wade about to the west. There is a junction with the A86, which runs eastwards towards Newtonmore and the Cairngorms. The Commando Memorial, a high structure dedicated to the original Commandos in World War II, who used the local area as a training ground, is located just north of the village at a junction with the B8004 to Gairlochy. This memorial provides one of the best viewpoints of the Highlands that is close to the A82.

The A82 then follows the eastern shore of Loch Lochy up to Laggan. The village has no clearly defined centre but broadly follows the course of the A82 over , from the Laggan Locks on the Caledonian Canal to the swing bridge that separates the canal from Loch Oich. This bridge is close to the &quot;Well of the Seven Heads&quot; monument, which allegedly contains the heads of seven men involved in the murder of Alexander MacDonald, Chief of Keppoch, and his brother, on 25 September 1663.
The A82 runs towards the centre of Loch Oich, passes Invergarry Castle, and crosses the River Garry. Just after the bridge, the A87 heads west towards Skye, while the A82 continues along the western shore of the loch up to the Bridge of Oich at its northern end. This bridge was constructed in 1932, bypassing the 1850s Bridge of Oich, a Taper Suspension Bridge built by James Dredge. The A82 continues along the general line of Wade&#x27;s Military Road up to Fort Augustus, crossing the canal at a swing bridge next to the locks in the village.

The final from Fort Augustus to Inverness is mostly on the alignment of Telford&#x27;s Road, running along the western shore of Loch Ness. This is on the opposite side of the loch to Wade&#x27;s Military Road, because Telford wanted to connect the various communities along the western shore. Construction of the road started in 1805 but was delayed in 1807, when the building contractors abandoned the work with seven bridges yet to be completed. It was mostly complete by 1809 at an estimated cost of £5,800 (£ as of ).

Because the A82 is a main through route, tourists are suggested to use the older Military Road instead, so as to avoid the coach and HGV traffic. Cyclists and walkers can use the Great Glen Way between Fort Wiilam and Inverness. This is part of National Cycle Route 78 (The Caledonia Way) from Campbeltown to Inverness.
There is a short diversion from the loch at Invermoriston, where the A82 crosses the River Moriston and the A887 provides another route back to the A87 and Skye. Telford&#x27;s original stone bridge over the river, constructed in 1813, was replaced by a more modern structure as part of an overall improvement to the A82 undertaken in the 1930s. Between Invermoriston and Drumnadrochit, there is a roadside memorial to John Cobb, who was killed on the loch attempting to beat the water speed record. As the A82 approaches Drumnadrochit, it passes Urquhart Castle before turning inland, away from the loch shore, to approach the village.

The A82 continues at the north end of the loch, along the western edge of the River Ness, which runs parallel alongside the canal towards Inverness city centre. Immediately after entering the urban area, the road crosses the canal at the Tomnahurich Swing Bridge. Now inside Inverness, the road passes Queen&#x27;s Park stadium and heads towards the city centre. It crosses the Ness at the Friar&#x27;s Bridge, bypassing the city centre to pass through the docklands and associated industrial estates as an urban dual carriageway. The road ends at a roundabout with the A9 just south of Kessock Bridge.

==History==
The original route of the A82 as classified in 1923 was described as &quot;Glasgow – Clydebank – Dumbarton – Alexandria – Crianlarich – Ballachulish – Fort William – Fort Augustus – Inverness&quot; and closely follows the route as designed by Telford. With only a few exceptions, the basic route has remained unchanged. The renovations of the early 20th century were part of a wider road building programme (an economic stimulus) after the Great Depression.

===Glasgow===
The original starting point of the A82 in Glasgow was at Trongate. It proceeded to run westwards along Argyle Street and Dumbarton Road to Dumbarton via Clydebank. On 16 May 1934, the road was rerouted to run along Buchanan Street, New City Road and Great Western Road, whose westward extension from Anniesland Cross had been recently completed. The route between Glasgow and Dumbarton (bypassing Clydebank via Duntocher), has since broadly remained the same, aside from the declassification of the route to the south of the M8 when that motorway was constructed.

===Rannoch Moor===

The A82 between Crianlarich and Glencoe over Rannoch Moor has an extensive history. A route through the moor was followed by Major William Caulfeild, and a later route was constructed by Telford. The current alignment was constructed because Telford&#x27;s road had continual problems with the loch flooding. Telford himself had proposed a completely alternative route, running to Spean Bridge via Loch Treig and Glen Spean. His plans were never implemented, though that route eventually formed part of the West Highland Railway.

The current alignment began construction in 1927, and included a general widening of the carriageway from Tyndrum to Glencoe to . Work was delayed following a disagreement with the Scottish Ministry of Transport and local councils over funding. It was eventually completed in 1933 and cost £500,000 (£ in ).

The 1930s road follows Telford&#x27;s road as far as Bridge of Orchy, then runs to the east of Loch Tulla, while the old road runs to the other side. The project was criticised over spoiling the natural beauty of Glen Coe, but was defended by the Ministry of Transport who thought it would provide better transport links to Argyllshire and Inverness-shire.

===Kinlochleven===

The original route of the A82 crossed Loch Leven at the Ballachulish Ferry, in a similar location to today&#x27;s bridge, but there was then no through route around the loch. However, the development of the aluminium works at Kinlochleven and the construction of the Blackwater Dam in 1907 resulted in the construction of a new road around the full extent of the loch, from Glencoe to North Ballachulish, by the 1930s. On 16 May 1934, the Ministry of Transport announced they would divert the A82 along this road, principally because it was an all-day route while the ferry at that time closed daily between 8 p.m. and 8 a.m. and cost up to five shillings to use. It continued to follow the route via Kinlochleven until the opening of the Ballachulish Bridge. The Kinlochleven road is now the B863, but still remains an important local road since the town reinvented itself as a tourist destination following the close of the smelter works in 2000. The Ballachulish bridge saves a round trip.

===Inverness===
The A82 originally ended on the A9 to the west of the Ness Bridge near Inverness city centre. The current diversion over the Friars Bridge towards the modern A9 opened in 1986, in co-ordination with the redevelopment and extension of Inverness docks in the early 1980s and the rerouting of the A9 onto the Kessock Bridge.

==Economic importance==

The Scottish Government have said that the A82 is &quot;a vital artery for communities in the western Highlands and links Fort William, the Highlands and the Western Isles with Glasgow and the Central Belt.&quot; The Highlands and Islands Transport Partnership (HITRANS) believe the economic benefits of the A82 extend far beyond its basic route, as it connects with several other trunk roads to the Western Highlands and related islands, including all of the Western Isles and the Isle of Skye. The population of the area served around the A82 corridor is expected to decline from 78,900 in 2001 to 72,300 by 2018, with the vast majority of depopulation to occur in the Western Isles.

HITRANS believe investment in the A82 is therefore vitally important to improve the accessibility of these areas and stop the continuing population decline. They have said that improvements to the A9 in the 1970s stimulated the economy of Inverness: &quot;Without the improved access as a result of the A9 improvement, this would almost certainly not have been possible.&quot; The partnership believe that with comparable improvements to the A82, an additional income of £76 million could be generated in the area. Former Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond stated whilst in office that the government is &quot;committed to improving the A82&quot;, and he allocated £500,000 in June 2011 to study key areas where the route could be improved. Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown called the A82 a &quot;vital economic and social lifeline&quot;.

==Maintenance and improvements==

The A82, along with the A9, has been frequently regarded as one of the most dangerous roads in Scotland. HITRANS have said that &quot;of the between Balloch and Inverness, only can be considered to be of a functional standard.&quot; A campaign group, the A82 Partnership, has been set up to encourage the Scottish Government to continue to make improvements to the route. In 2002, the A82 between Tarbet and Tyndrum was listed as the third most dangerous Scottish road in an AA study. The Scottish executive debunked the report as &quot;misleading&quot;. A further study listed in the 2012 &quot;Collins Big Road Atlas&quot; did not list the A82 as one of the most at risk to safety. In 2017, Member of the Scottish Parliament David Stewart criticised the A82&#x27;s safety record in Inverness after a man was killed after being hit by a car on the road.

The A82 around Loch Lomond has become increasingly congested as the loch has become more popular with tourists for boating, particularly since restrictions were put in place in the Lake District, coincident with improvements to routes leading to the Loch from the south. On regular occasions, the road is completely congested from Luss to the Balloch roundabout. The section from Tarbet to Crianlarich, north of the section improved in the 1980s and 90s, was frequently closed overnight during September 2012, because the carriageway had become worn out and needed urgent repair, including failed surfacing and potholes. Because of the narrow width of the road, it was not possible to simply close the road in one direction at a time with temporary traffic signals, as is the general procedure elsewhere on Britain&#x27;s road network. Transport Scotland justified these works by saying that only 5% of traffic used the road between 10 pm and 6 am, when the works were planned. The official diversion route from Tarbet to Crianlarich is via the A83, A819 and A85, a detour of approximately .

Because most of the A82 is single carriageway, and the local geography means a detour can be a significant distance, there is a history of strong protest about closing the road. In August 2011, John Grieve, owner of Lochleven Shellfish Company, attempted to challenge Transport Scotland&#x27;s plans to close the A82 overnight five days a week, for a period of up to three weeks, around the village of Onich, between Glencoe and Fort William. The &quot;Scottish Herald&quot; reported that, if the road closed, a journey from Oban to Fort William, normally , would require diverting via Loch Tay and Ballinluig, a journey of . In April 2013, Transport Scotland announced further plans to close the A82 at Onich for resurfacing, but they postponed the work due to an adverse reaction from local business owners. In 2015, a section of the A82 between Invermoriston and Drumnadrochit closed following a rockfall, requiring an official detour of .

Along with several other roads in the Highlands, the A82 between Tyndrum and Glencoe has been installed with permanent gates that are closed in the event of severe weather. These gates are now fitted with fibre-optic illuminated signs. The road has been identified as one of several trunk roads in the Highlands that suffers from problems with deer-vehicle collisions. In 1996, Transport Scotland set up a number of vehicle activated warning signs alerting drivers attention to nearby deer. Four of these signs are on the A82 between Tyndrum and Glencoe.

==Junctions and landmarks==
The A82 has a wide variety of junctions along its length, ranging from high-quality grade-separated interchanges near Glasgow, to simple T-junctions in the Scottish Highlands.

<text>The M53 is an motorway in the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral, Merseyside and the borough of Cheshire West and Chester, Cheshire on the Wirral Peninsula in England. It is also referred to as the Mid Wirral Motorway. It runs between the Kingsway Tunnel, at Wallasey in the north, and the A55 at Chester.

The main reason for the motorway was to provide a through route to the new Mersey Road Tunnel, Kingsway, which was built at the same time. Part of this motorway was originally the M531.

==Route==

Starting at the northern end, the motorway starts in Wallasey at the exit slip roads from the Kingsway Tunnel from Liverpool. It loops round the north west of Birkenhead and then runs south as a dual three-lane route between Upton, Woodchurch in the west and Prenton. From junctions 1 to 3 it runs parallel to the Borderlands railway line. It crosses this line south of junction 3. From this junction it proceeds south to the west of Bebington through junction 4 and then further south for (where it crosses the Wirral railway line), before narrowing to dual two-lane and turning sharply to the east. At junction 5, traffic for Wales can take the A41, A550 and A494 to join the A55 near Ewloe. The road passes north and then east of Hooton, then to the east of Overpool and Wolverham and with Ellesmere Port to the west.

South of junction 10 the route enters a more rural setting, passing under the M56 motorway at junction 11. Finally, it heads south and becomes the A55 North Wales Expressway at junction 12.

==History==
This motorway was originally two separate projects, the M53 and M531. The M53 was originally proposed to run from the Kingsway Tunnel to Backford. The M531 would have run from a point just west of the current junction 5 and provided a connection with the M56 for eastbound travel.

When the M53 was first planned in the early 1960s, it was designed as a route to connect the two Mersey road tunnels with the A55 trunk road on the Welsh border, giving Liverpool and the rest of Merseyside a direct link with Chester and the towns on the North Wales coast.

In the event, the A55 link was never built and instead the M531 (by-passing the eastern side of Chester) was incorporated into the M53.

===M531===
The first section of the M531 was built to improve access to the Vauxhall Ellesmere Port facility. It was opened in 1968 as a non-designated road. Subsequently this road was extended further south to meet the A5117 and was designated as the M531. In March 1981, the M531 was lengthened to meet the M56 and at this stage the whole route was redesignated as the M53.

===M53===
Construction on the M53 started in 1969. It was to be built in stages as part of a strategic route to North Wales for traffic from Merseyside. The route to North Wales was unresolved as there was even an option to run due west from south of junction 4 and cross the River Dee on a barrage. This first section from the tunnel to junction 5, where it connected straight into the Vauxhall Motors road, was opened by Lord Leverhulme in a ceremony at Hooton on 1 February 1972. A junction was partially built to allow extension of the motorway further south west, around west of junction 5. The unbuilt motorway would have provided a bypass of the A41 and would likely have terminated on the M56, though exactly where is unknown. The unfinished junction for this extension has now been demolished.

The final section of the M53 provided a link to Chester from the M56 and was opened in 1982. No plans are known to exist to complete the originally planned M53. 

===Dates===
* Junctions 1 to 5 were opened in 1972
* Junctions 5 to 8 were redesignated as motorway in 1974 as part of the M531
* Junctions 8 to 10 opened in 1975 as part of the M531
* Junctions 10 to 11 were opened in 1981
* Junctions 11 to 12 were opened in 1982

==Incidents==
===Coach crash===

On 29 September 2023, a coach overturned and crashed in the M53 motorway coach crash. Jessica Baker, a 15-year-old schoolgirl, and the driver, Stephen Shrimpton, both died in the crash.

==M53 Divide==
The M53 is seen as an east–west divide between the affluent and developing areas of the Wirral.

==Culture==
A full-sized replica of one of the motorway&#x27;s bridges forms part of the exhibition &quot;O&#x27; Magic Power of Bleakness&quot; by Mark Leckey at Tate Britain (September 2019 – January 2020).

<doc id="345632" wikidata="Q1613859" url="?curid=345632" title="International Council for the Exploration of the Sea">
<text>The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES; , &quot;CIEM&quot;) is a regional fishery advisory body and the world&#x27;s oldest intergovernmental science organization. ICES is headquartered in Copenhagen, Denmark, where its multinational secretariat staff of 51 provide scientific, administrative and secretarial support to the ICES community. It was established on July 22, 1902, in Copenhagen.

==Functions==
ICES is a leading multidisciplinary scientific forum for the exchange of information and ideas on all aspects of marine sciences pertaining to the North Atlantic, including the adjacent Baltic Sea and North Sea, and for the promotion and coordination of marine research by scientists within its member nations. Its principal functions, both when it was established and continuing to the present time, are to: (i) promote, encourage, develop, and coordinate marine research; (ii) publish and otherwise disseminate results of research; and (iii) provide non-biased, non-political scientific advice to member nation governments and international regulatory commissions.

==History==

In the late 19th century, a growing concern over the well-being of fish stocks in the North Sea coupled with efforts by different groups of scientists in neighboring countries to promote and encourage international scientific marine cooperation resulted in the establishment of ICES on July 22, 1902. The new organization was created in Copenhagen, Denmark by eight founding nations: Denmark, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Russia, and the United Kingdom. The council&#x27;s membership has fluctuated over the years with nations joining/leaving/rejoining at different times as a result of wars and political decisions.

An exchange of letters among the original eight member nations was sufficient to establish the council in 1902. This type of arrangement continued until the early 1960s when this informal status became unacceptable in light of the establishment of the United Nations and its subsidiary bodies as well as other international organizations. Steps were initiated to achieve full international recognition of the council by the host country, Denmark. At a conference convened in Copenhagen on September 7, 1964, a formal convention was signed which subsequently came into force on July 22, 1968, following its ratification by the then 17 member nations.

ICES today has 20 member nations, including the eight original members plus twelve additional nations: Belgium, Canada, Estonia, France, Iceland, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Spain, and the United States. It also has affiliate institutes with observer status from: Australia, Chile, Greece, Peru, and South Africa. Formal observer status has been given to two non-governmental organizations: Worldwide Fund for Nature and Birdlife International.

==Structure==
The principal decision and policy-making body of ICES is the council. The council consists of a president and two delegates from each of the 20 member nations. Delegates elect the president, first vice-president, and five additional vice-presidents (all for three-year terms) to comprise the bureau or executive committee. The bureau is responsible for carrying out the council&#x27;s decisions, preparing and convening council meetings, formulating council budgets, appointing a secretariat staff, and performing other tasks as assigned by the council. A finance committee consisting of five delegates provides oversight to the council&#x27;s fiscal matters. Delegates are also responsible for appointing a general secretary, who serves as the council&#x27;s chief executive officer and is charged with managing the council&#x27;s secretariat facilities and staff, finances, meetings, reports, publications, and communications.

The council&#x27;s scientific work is accomplished by various committees and working groups. During the long history of ICES, the committee and working group structure has changed periodically to reflect the needs of the time. At present, there is an advisory committee (ACOM) that provides advice to clients on fisheries and marine ecosystem issues, a Science Committee (SCICOM; formally the Consultative Committee as established in the ICES Convention) that oversees all aspects of the scientific work, and steering groups that coordinate the more than 100 expert groups covering most aspects of the marine ecosystem that work under them.

A recently prepared strategic plan focuses on science that is broad-based, relevant, and farsighted, and providing advice that is rigorous, reliable, and objective. The plan identifies a mission which calls for 1) establishing effective arrangements to provide scientific advice; 2) informing interested parties and the public objectively and effectively about marine ecosystem issues; 3) coordinating and enhancing physical, chemical, biological, and interdisciplinary research; 4) fostering partnerships with other organizations that share a common interest; and 5) developing and maintaining accessible marine databases. The strategic plan addresses six critical themes: 1) Science, 2) Collaboration, 3) Advice, 4) Data, 5) Communication, and 6) Service support. An action plan specifies the activities that will be undertaken over the coming years in order to achieve the goals. It explains how ICES will continue to advance scientific knowledge and improve scientific advice, whereas the goals in the strategic plan tell what the overall objectives will be.

==ICES work==
The scientific work of ICES is done by a community of more than 1600 marine scientists from research institutes and universities in member and affiliate nations collaborating to gather information about the marine ecosystem, fill gaps in existing knowledge, and develop unbiased, non-political advice in addressing terms of reference developed each year by the advisory and science committees at the week-long ICES Annual Science Conference (ASC). The reports of the expert groups are presented at the ASCs and made available on the ICES website. Some groups produce special reports, such as “ICES Report on Ocean Climate” or “ICES Zooplankton Status Report”, that are published in the ICES Cooperative Research Report series.

The ASC (formerly called the Statutory Meeting), held every year in September, generally attracts 500–700 scientists from around the world. The programme features plenary lectures by noted scientists, theme sessions of contributed papers addressing timely multidisciplinary topics, and poster sessions. In addition, meetings of the Committees, Bureau, and Council are held to conduct the necessary business of the organization.

During the year, meetings of the more than 100 expert groups and workshops are held either at ICES headquarters in Copenhagen or at venues in member (and occasionally affiliate) nations to address terms of reference developed at the previous ASC.

Symposia are an important part of the ICES work programme, not least because they foster the broadening of the diversity of scientists who participate in ICES activities. ICES welcomes proposals for stimulating symposia on topics that are fundamental to the science components of the ICES Strategic Plan including (a) understanding the physical, chemical, and biological functioning of marine ecosystems, (b) understanding and quantifying human impacts on marine ecosystems, including living marine resources, and (c) evaluating options for sustainable marine-related industries, particularly fishing and mariculture. ICES generally sponsors, either itself or in collaboration with other organizations, at least two, and sometimes as many as seven or eight, scientific symposia in a calendar year.

The ICES Recognition Programme honours individuals whose contributions have improved ICES and the community of scientists associated with it, advanced marine science, and/or exemplify the objective application of ICES scientific information to societal decisions concerning the sustainable use of marine ecosystems. The Programme consists of four awards:
*Outstanding Achievement Award recognizes a sustained, outstanding performance and exceptional contribution by a member of the ICES community whose career has been distinguished by a sustained commitment to excellence in such endeavours as science and research, and leadership.
*Prix d’Excellence Award recognizes the highest level of contribution to the ICES vision of “An international scientific community that is relevant, responsive, sound, and credible, concerning marine ecosystems and their relation to humanity”.
*Merit Awards give formal recognition to the best research paper and poster given at the Annual Science Conference, and to the best up-and-coming new scientist making a presentation at the Annual Science Conference.
*Service Awards recognize the achievements and contributions of outgoing chairs of expert groups, science and advisory groups, and conveners of Annual Science Conference theme sessions and ICES symposia which further the objectives of ICES.

==Advice==
The council has delegated its advisory authority to the advisory committee (ACOM), which designs strategies and processes for the preparation of advice, manages the advisory processes, and creates and delivers advice, subject to direction from the council. ACOM works on the basis of scientific analyses prepared in the ICES expert groups, and the advisory process includes peer review of the analyses before it can be used as the basis for advice. ACOM has one member from each member nation under the direction of an independent ACOM chair and four vice-chairs appointed by the council.

Unbiased scientific advice is provided to member nation governments and international regulatory commissions in support of the management and conservation of coastal and ocean resources and ecosystems. Advice on the management of over 160 separate fin-fish and shellfish stocks is provided to the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC), North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization (NASCO), and the European Commission (EC). Advice and scientific information on anthropogenic impacts to the marine environment are provided to the Commission for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR), the European Commission (EC), and the Baltic Marine Environment Protection Commission (HELCOM).

==Publications==
ICES produces a variety of publications, many of which can be accessed on the ICES website. ICES issued its first publication within a year of its establishment. Since then, it has published thousands more, including many that are now considered to be the standard references in their fields. These include:
*&quot;ICES Journal of Marine Science&quot; (&quot;Journal du Conseil&quot;) constitutes a primary source for articles on fishery-oriented marine science and is a standard reference for work in the fields of ecology, population studies, plankton research, and physical and chemical oceanography, among others. Since January 2007, the Journal has been published by Oxford University Press.
*&quot;ICES Advice&quot; annually presents the collected information from the advisory committee (ACOM). The advice is based on an ecosystem approach to management.
*&quot;ICES Cooperative Research Report&quot; (&quot;Rapport des Recherches Collectives&quot;) presents reports prepared by ICES Expert Groups and &quot;ad hoc&quot; groups, and edited reports on cooperative research activities organized by the council.
*&quot;Techniques in Marine Environmental Sciences&quot; presents detailed descriptions of methods and procedures relating to chemical and biological measurements in the marine environment.
*&quot;ICES Identification Leaflets for Plankton&quot; (&quot;Fiches d’Identification du Plancton&quot;) furnish keys, in a standardized form, for the identification of the major plankton species in the North Atlantic.
*&quot;ICES Identification Leaflets for Diseases and Parasites of Fish and Shellfish&quot; (&quot;Fiches d’Identification des Maladies et Parasites des Poissons, Crustacés et Mollusques&quot;) serve as diagnostic aids and present, in a standardized format, information about the most important diseases and parasites of fish and shellfish in the North Atlantic and adjacent seas.
*&quot;ICES Fisheries Statistics&quot; present nominal catch statistics for the Northeast Atlantic for 1973–2000, presented using FishStat Plus software, as well as catch statistics for the entire Atlantic for 1950–1998.
*&quot;ICES Marine Science Symposia&quot; (&quot;Actes du Symposium&quot;) contains the scientific papers and proceedings of Symposia and Special Meetings held under the auspices of ICES independently or in collaboration with cooperating organizations. Since 1995, most of these volumes have been published as special numbers in the ICES Journal of Marine Science, but continue to be included in the consecutive numbering system of the ICES MSS series.
*&quot;ICES Insight&quot; is an annual publication that offers more in-depth articles exploring subjects that feature prominently in ICES work.
*&quot;ICES Annual Reports&quot; recap ICES annual activities and scientific network.
*&quot;ICES Inside Out&quot; is a regularly appearing electronic newsletter that updates subscribers on the activities of ICES and its secretariat.
*CD-ROMs contain papers (CM Documents) presented at ICES Annual Science Conferences and may be ordered from the secretariat.
*ICES Newsletters from years past are archived and available at the ICES website.

==Data==
Scientists working through ICES gather information about the marine ecosystem. The data from this work is held at the ICES Data Center, a cross-discipline department with expertise in fisheries, oceanography and the marine environment. The Data Center holdings include some of the largest databases in the world on these subjects. The Data Center is staffed by data managers and programmers who manage the data submissions and guidelines and develop tools and products to facilitate the use of the data by end users ranging from scientists to policy-makers. In addition, the ICES Data Center acts as the Marine Data Center for the regional marine convention in the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR) and the Baltic Sea (HELCOM) 

In the 1970s, an area notation system known as ICES Statistical Rectangles was developed for simplified analysis and visualisation of marine data over the north-east Atlantic region. The component rectangles measure 1 degree of longitude by 0.5 degrees of latitude and are intended to be roughly square in temperate latitudes, approximately 30 nautical miles by 30 nautical miles (55×55 km) at 60°N. More recently, some ICES applications such as &quot;FishFrame&quot;, and selected ICES reports have used 0.5×0.5 degree C-squares (part of a fully hierarchical, global system designed for a similar purpose) for equivalent activities, 2 c-squares (at that resolution) occupying exactly the same space as a single ICES rectangle.

<text>The M90 is a motorway in Scotland. It runs from Junction 1A of the M9 motorway, south of the Queensferry Crossing, to Perth. It is the northernmost motorway in the United Kingdom. The northern point goes to the western suburbs of Perth at Broxden. A small part of the M90 (across the Friarton Bridge to the southeast of Perth) was originally numbered as the M85 motorway.

==History==
The first section of the M90 opened in 1964 to coincide with the opening of the Forth Road Bridge and Masterton junction (Junction 2). The next section of the M90, the Crossgates – Kelty and Cowdenbeath Bypass, opened on 1 December 1969. The stretch between Kinross and the Milnathort Bypass opened in December 1971.

Two sections were due to begin construction around 1973 and 1974, however, they were put on hold because of the 1973 oil crisis. The section from Arlary (Junction 8 with A91) to Arngask was opened in March 1977. Arngask (Glenfarg) to Muirmont opened in 2 October 1980
connecting with the completed Friarton Bridge (which was originally numbered M85, and opened in 1976) and Perth Bypass to Broxden.

The M90 was extended southwards across the Firth of Forth over a new cable-stayed bridge, the Queensferry Crossing, in 2017. A short stretch of the A90 connects the two parts of M90: the short M90 section from the M9 and the much longer M90 section that crosses the Queensferry Crossing and extends to Perth. This short length of the A90 was required at this point as motorway regulations would have prevented certain classes of traffic from using this section of road.

==Details==

The M90 leaves the east-west M9 near Kirkliston and heads north. The motorway is interrupted by a short stretch of the A90 from where the A90 from Edinburgh joins the M90. The road continues, however the M90 during this stretch is called the A90. Once it reaches the junction to the south of the Queensferry Crossing the A90 becomes the M90 again at that point. The crossing opened as part of the motorway on 30 August 2017; the bridge is configured as a dual two lane carriageway and has a speed limit of .

Previously, the M90&#x27;s most substantial engineering feature was the Friarton Bridge in Perth, a tall concrete pillared structure which traverses the River Tay. The bridge carries eastbound traffic from Broxden towards Dundee and along the Firth of Tay.

The road constitutes most of the southerly part of the A90 corridor from Edinburgh, through Perth, Dundee and Aberdeen to Peterhead along Scotland&#x27;s North Sea coast.

A large part of the northern section of the motorway follows the route of the former main railway line between Perth and Edinburgh via Glenfarg, Kinross and the Forth Bridge, which was closed in 1970 despite this not being recommended by the Beeching report.

The Kinross and Milnathort Bypass, the section of the M90 between Fruix and Arlary, was the first motorway in Britain to be constructed using concrete pavements that were not reinforced. Both the south- and north-bound carriageways have since been overlaid by tarmac.

Near to its northern terminus, the motorway splits into two branches. The construction of this three-way interchange required the removal of approximately of material, which was mostly rock. The motorway bends through in an acute angle, on a compound curve partly of and partly of in its radius. One branch heads in a north-easterly direction, flowing into the A90 at its end, numbered junction 11this branch was formerly the M85 motorway, until the A85 was renumbered as A90. The other branch forms part of the western bypass of Perth, and meets the A9 at its end, numbered junction 12. The gradient is 4.57% uphill and 5.65% downhill on this section. The slip roads forming this branch merge with shared priority to allow HGVs (also known as Large Good Vehicles or Heavy Goods Vehicles) to maintain momentum on the steep upgrade. The Broxden to Muirmont slip road at the centre of the interchange has a radius of , necessitating maximum superelevation of 7%.

The M90 forms part of the Euroroute E15 which runs from Inverness to Algeciras, however this is not signposted within the UK.

==Issues==
The M90 lacks hard shoulders for an section. In this section there are emergency lay-bys (rest areas) at intervals instead.

The M90 here has another of the tightest corners on the UK motorway network, for which some traffic can be forced to slow down. The corner cuts through the northern side of the Ochil Hills and has a curve radius of . A recommended minimum of was standard at the time of construction. This corner also coincides with one of the steepest sections of the motorway, for which north-bound HGVs are sign-posted to stay in a low gear and often brake continuously through the turn. South-bound HGVs are normally substantially reduced in speed as they make the incline.

<text>The M180 is a motorway in eastern England, starting at junction 5 on the M18 motorway in Hatfield, within the Metropolitan Borough of Doncaster, South Yorkshire, and terminating at Barnetby, Lincolnshire, some from the port of Immingham and from the port of Grimsby. The A180 road continues to the east for Grimsby, Cleethorpes and Immingham. Scunthorpe, Lincoln, Hull (via the Humber Bridge), Brigg, Bawtry and the Isle of Axholme can be accessed using the motorway. Humberside Airport, the now-closed Doncaster Sheffield Airport, and the Killingholme, Humber and Lindsey oil refineries are close to the motorway. The road forms part of the unsigned Euroroute E22 and is the main route along the south bank of the Humber Estuary. 

==History==

===Planning and construction===
The motorway bypass around Brigg was discussed for many years, but the Flixborough explosion gave it more importance, and was built three years later in 1977 as the second section of the motorway. At this time the A15 ran through Hibaldstow and Redbourne to Brigg, and the junction with the motorway was at Castlethorpe Corner, about east of the current A15 junction on the line of the Roman Ermine Street. The initial, and somewhat diminutive section of the motorway was the short-lived A18(M) also known as the Tudworth Link, which connected the roundabout junction with the M18 to the A18/A614. The easterly A18(M) sliproad is still used, though the original roundabout at junction 1 has now been replaced by a bridge close to Tudworth Hall Farm. The last section to be built was the Trent viaduct, opened in October 1979 by Kenneth Clarke, despite being 43 weeks late on account of strikes and bad weather.

Draft proposals were announced at the end of May 1973; there would be a bridge over the Trent at East Butterwick; there would be a 2.6-mile spur road to Scunthorpe, joining the A18 1000 yards west of the &quot;Berkeley Circle&quot; roundabout, with a motorway junction on Bottesford Moor; the 11.6 miles of new motorway, to the M181, would cost £16m.

The motorway is built to dual three-lane standard for most of its duration (aside from a short dual two-lane section past Scunthorpe), and is quite straight and flat.

The M180 has its own spur – the M181. While the M180 has to make do with a roundabout junction with the M18, its spur has a large, freeflowing trumpet interchange. At the start of the M180 are the Doncaster North services, owned by Moto.Doncaster North

===Contracts===
* M18 to Sandtoft, £4.8m, Monk
* Trent Bridge, £3.8m, Cementation Construction, opened to westbound traffic on 20 July 1979, opened to eastbound traffic on Wednesday 31 October 1979; the 364 precast units, weighing between 35 and 75 tonnes, were made at Tallington by Dow-Mac
* Trent to Scunthorpe, A.F. Budge of Retford
* Scunthorpe Southern Bypass, Balfour Beatty Clugston Joint Venture, opened by Bill Rodgers, Baron Rodgers of Quarry Bank, at the Ermine Street Interchange, on Friday 15 December 1978; opened the same day as the final stretch of the M18

=== A180 extension ===
It was extended in the 1980s to trunk-road standard as the A180 which is a two-lane dual carriageway which continues on to Grimsby and Cleethorpes. In its early planning stages, it was to be named the A18.

The £18 million section from Brigg to Ulceby (A160) was opened on 29 March 1983 by Lynda Chalker, Baroness Chalker of Wallasey, and the £21 million section from Ulceby to Grimsby opened in late 1983.

<text>The M65 is a motorway between Preston and Colne in Lancashire, England. It runs from Bamber Bridge just south of Preston, through major junctions with the M6 and M61 motorways, east past Darwen, Blackburn, Accrington, Burnley, Brierfield, Nelson and ends at Colne.

==History==

The M65 was opened in the following sections:

*Junctions 10 to 12 (Burnley to Brierfield) in 1981
*Junctions 7 to 10 (Hyndburn to Burnley) in 1983
*Junctions 12 to 13 (Brierfield to Nelson) in 1983
*Junctions 6 to 7 (Whitebirk to Accrington/Hyndburn) in 1984
*Junctions 13 to 14 (Nelson to Colne) in 1988
*Junctions 1a to 6 M6 to Whitebirk in 1997

The first section of the motorway was opened in 1981, connecting Burnley to Brierfield. Over the years, several extensions were made, the largest being the link from Whitebirk to the M6 and M61 motorways in 1997.

This extension was the scene of a standoff between construction security workers and protesters forming part of the environmental direct action movement. Protesters occupied abandoned buildings in Darwen, parts of Stanworth Woods near Feniscowles and needed to be physically removed.

Junctions 1a to 6 were opened 18 December 1997 by Jack Straw, Home Secretary and Member of Parliament (MP) for Blackburn. The opening ceremony took place on the westbound carriageway beneath junction 5 at Guide with a heavy police presence as protesters threatened to bring a halt to the proceedings.

Much of the 1997 extension was relaid shortly after it opened with a new, quieter tarmac because the amount of road noise had been so great that it prevented birds of prey (mainly owls) from foraging effectively.

Originally, the M65 was planned to go via the town centre of Blackburn.

The motorway is maintained by National Highways up to Junction 10 with Lancashire County Council taking over responsibility from this junction until the end of the motorway at Junction 14.

==Features==

===Unusual spur road (Walton Summit Motorway)===
When the M65 was extended, a slip road was built at Walton Summit, southeast of Preston, from the roundabout linking junction 9 of the M61 with junction 2 of the M65 to the Walton Summit industrial estate. It is a single-carriageway road, with two lanes towards the junction (uphill) and one away (downhill). It is around 600 yards long and replaced an A-road spur of the A6 that was built in the 1980s.

According to the statutory instrument that authorised its construction, the road is officially classified as a &#x27;special link road to connect the [M65/M61 roundabout] with the all-purpose road known as Tramway Lane&#x27;. According to Lancashire County Council, it is the &#x27;M61 Link Tramway Lane to Junction 9&#x27; and is part of the M61. In 2007, the approach signs from Walton Summit were modified to read &#x27;M61&#x27;, but the signs still mark the roundabout at the eastern end.

==Legislation==

Each motorway in England requires that a statutory instrument be published, detailing the route of the road, before it can be built. The dates given on these statutory instruments relate to when the document was published, and not when the road was built. Provided below is an incomplete list of statutory instruments relating to the route of the M65.

* Statutory Instrument 1991 No. 722: The M65 Motorway (Bamber Bridge to Whitebirk Section, Blackburn Southern Bypass) and Connecting Roads Scheme 1991. S.I. 1991/722
* Statutory Instrument 1992 No. 2651: The M65 Motorway (Bamber Bridge to Whitebirk Section, Blackburn Southern Bypass) and Connecting Roads Scheme 1991 Variation Scheme 1992. S.I. 1992/2651

==Junctions==

The entire route is in Lancashire.

<doc id="345645" wikidata="Q6713895" url="?curid=345645" title="M61 motorway">
<text>The M61 is a motorway in North West England between Manchester and Preston, linking the M60 Manchester orbital motorway with the M6 motorway.

It runs from the A580 near Wardley and heads northwest past Bolton, Horwich and Chorley to join the M6 near Bamber Bridge, just north of the junction between the M6 and M65. It runs parallel to the A6, to its northeast, for the entirety of its length, essentially bypassing the towns and villages the A6 runs through between Manchester and Preston.

==History==
The Horwich to Worsley section began on Wednesday 1 January 1969, costing £12.4million, to open by the end of December 1970, built by the Alfred McAlpine and Leonard Fairclough &amp; Son consortium.

== Services==

The M61 has one service station: Rivington services (formerly Anderton Services and Bolton West services), located between junctions 6 and 8 (as junction 7 was never built). This motorway service area was used in the filming of &quot;The Services&quot;, a pilot episode for the Farnworth-born comedian Peter Kay series &quot;That Peter Kay Thing&quot;, a spoof documentary of a day in the life of the services staff.

Originally built as part of the Kenning Motor Group, it later became part of the Rank Group portfolio, before passing on to Pavilion (Granada) and First Motorway Services. This services originally had two restaurants (one each side) and full facilities. However, due to the relatively short length of the M61 and wealth of alternative nearby facilities, it suffered from low traffic and footfall. This resulted in a lack of investment, and the site passed from hand to hand. It was also, at various times, operated on one side only, access from the opposite carriageway being via the over-bridge, or closed down completely. 
In 2009, it was acquired by the Blackburn based Euro Garages Group. Instead of simply refurbishing the existing infrastructure, a completely new facility was built on each of the old car-parks. All the original buildings were then demolished.

At various periods, since the building of the M61, the lack of a junction 7 has been used by local politicians as a campaign feature. This has once again come to the fore in 2022, as a proposal to relieve major congestion between junction 6 and Horwich. The two proposals are; to either build junction 7 where the M61 passes over the Bolton to Chorley road at Anderton, or to incorporate junction 7 into the Rivington Services site. Short term, neither are likely to happen.

== Worsley Braided Interchange ==
At the southeastern end at junction 2, the Worsley Braided Interchange, a stretch of the road on Linnyshaw Moss, earns a place in the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; for having the most traffic lanes side by side (17), spread across eight almost-parallel carriageways, in a &quot;basketweave interchange&quot; design. However it isn&#x27;t clear how many of the lanes belong to the A666(M). The carriageways cross each other at shallow angles and make use of tunnel-like structures to spread the load, avoiding the need for skew bridges.

Spurs of the M61 radiate from junction 2 to four surrounding junctions, effectively creating one large interchange, consisting of the following junctions:
* The Kearsley Interchange links the A666 and A6053 to M61 junctions 2 and 3.
* M61 junction 3 links the M61 southeastbound to the Kearsley Interchange.
* M61 junction 2 (&quot;Worsley Braided Interchange&quot;) links to all of the other junctions.
* M60 junction 15 (&quot;Swinton Interchange&quot;) links the M60 to M61 junction 2 by using a short stretch of the A666(M).
* M60 junction 14 (Wardley Interchange) links the A580 East (East Lancashire Road) to M61 junction 2, and separately links the A580 West to the M60 East at junction 15.
The name &quot;Worsley Braided Interchange&quot; may also be used to describe the entire complex of five junctions. On its opening on 17 December 1970, the complex was already known locally as &quot;Spaghetti Junction&quot;, 17 months before the opening of Gravelly Hill Interchange in Birmingham, nowadays most associated with that name in Britain, but the name did not persist.

==Lancaster Canal==
The construction of the motorway between junctions 8 and 9 caused part of Lancaster Canal to be closed. Before closure, the canal had a southern section that had always been isolated from the main northern section, but historically linked to it by a horse-drawn tramway, the Lancaster Canal Tramroad. The new motorway crossed the route of the canal at three points. The Ministry of Transport and British Waterways Board decided that the cost of constructing three bridges was not justified, particularly as the canal was in poor condition, and promoted a bill in Parliament for closure of this section of the canal. The southernmost part of this section remains and is now classified as a spur of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal.

<doc id="345647" wikidata="Q496830" url="?curid=345647" title="M1 motorway (Republic of Ireland)">
<text>The M1 motorway () is a motorway in Ireland. It forms the large majority of the N1 [[national primary road]] connecting Dublin towards Belfast along the east of the island of Ireland. The route heads north via Swords, Drogheda and Dundalk to the Northern Irish border just south of Newry in County Armagh, where it joins the A1 road and further on, the M1 motorway in Northern Ireland. It also forms a significant part of the road connection between Dublin and the Northern Irish cities of Newry, and Lisburn.
The route is part of European route E01.

==Route==
Almost the entire length of the N1 has been upgraded to motorway standard and is designated the M1 motorway. It runs from the Junction 3 of the M50 ring road in Dublin, past Cloghran, Swords, Balbriggan, Stamullen, Drogheda, Dunleer, Castlebellingham and Dundalk before ending at Ballymascanlon north of Dundalk. It by-passes many towns and villages through which the N1 travelled. The original N1 route now forms the R132. At Ballymascanlon, it becomes the N1 dual carriageway and continues to the border with Northern Ireland. The motorway section of the N1 uses the M1 designation. Small yellow route markers along the motorway route also read N1.

The motorway was built in several stages as short disconnected bypasses, replacing the original N1 route. The first section opened (in 1983) was from Whitehall to Coolock Lane followed (in 1985) by the &quot;Airport Motorway&quot; between Whitehall and Dublin Airport, only the third section of motorway opened in the Republic. 1980s style direction signs were still intact on this route up until 2006. Part of this original M1 is now a spur to Dublin Airport, while another part between Whitehall to the Port Tunnel portals is now narrowed to two+one lanes (although still grade-separated) as a result of the Dublin Port Tunnel work.

There are toll fees for use of the motorway between junctions 7 and 10, the section which forms the Drogheda bypass. Work began in 2004 on a bypass of Dundalk, and was completed three months ahead of schedule in 2005, extending the motorway to just south of the border.

Construction finished in 2007 on a cross-border stretch of grade-separated dual-carriageway linking the northern end of the M1 with the A1 near Newry in County Armagh. This was opened to traffic on 2 August 2007. Its length is , north of the border and south of the border. This allows traffic to flow freely from Dublin Port on motorway/dual-carriageway standard road to the Hillsborough Roundabout, located south of Lisburn.

A speed limit applies on most of the M1, the exception being a limit between Junction 1 and Junction 2 at Dublin Airport. The lower speed limit is credited to the much higher volumes of traffic on this stretch. Fingal County Council raised the limit on this section to in June 2022.

==Junctions==

 all junctions feature their number on road signs.

==All-Ireland route==
The upgrade of the N1 is now complete in the Republic of Ireland, the first major route to be completely upgraded to motorway/dual carriageway standard (outside of Dublin city centre) as per the National Development Plan. The Northern Irish authorities have no plans to replace the A1 route (currently dual carriageway) with a motorway, although many junctions have now been grade separated. Currently, to drive from Dublin city centre to Belfast, one travels along the M1 (Republic of Ireland), N1, A1 and M1 (Northern Ireland).

==Motorway service areas==
The first official on-line motorway service area in Ireland opened on the M1 on 8 September 2010, located near Lusk. A second near Castlebellingham (M1 North service area) opened on 29 September 2010. Each location has northbound and southbound facilities, with no connection across the motorway between each side. Open 24 hours a day, they provide fuel and food and are of a design similar to those found in other European countries. The service areas are run by a consortium of companies known as Superstop.

==ITS on the M1==
As with other sections of Irish motorways which feature variable-message signs, the M1 is also connected to an intelligent transportation system (ITS) providing real-time journey time information for motorists. The system works by recognising vehicle number plates at intervals along the motorway, and uses this information to calculate average vehicle speeds and hence travel times. Northbound, VMSs near Malahide and Balbriggan provide information on the journey times to the Drogheda (J7) and Dundalk (J16) exits. Similar signs southbound provide information on the travel time to Dublin Airport and the Dublin Port Tunnel.

==Roadside art on the M1==
Roadside art is funded under the Percentage For Arts Scheme where 1% of the scheme budget is allocated to roadside art with a cap of €63,000. The local authorities decide on a theme and are responsible for commissioning the work, usually by open competition. There are several examples along the M1
* The Beehives. Three corbelled beehives on the Balbriggan bypass by artists Robert McColgan and Irene Benner made of cut stone in 2001 – Inspired by the tale of St. Molach, a beekeeper.
* An Tarbh Donn, a bull on the Dundalk bypass by artist Micheál McKeown. Of metal mesh on a concrete base. Inspired by the Bull in the Táin Bó Cúailnge.

<text>Darlene Wright (born July 26, 1941), also known by the stage name Darlene Love, is an American R&amp;B and soul singer and actress. She was the lead singer of the girl group the Blossoms and also a solo recording artist.

She began singing as a child with her local church choir. In 1962, she began recording with producer Phil Spector who renamed her Darlene Love. She sang lead on &quot;He&#x27;s a Rebel&quot; and &quot;He&#x27;s Sure the Boy I Love,&quot; which were credited to the Crystals. She was soon a highly sought-after vocalist and worked with many rock and soul musicians of the 1960s, including Sam Cooke, Dionne Warwick, Bill Medley, the Beach Boys, Elvis Presley, Tom Jones and Sonny and Cher. As an actress, Love performed in various Broadway productions. She had a recurring role as Roger Murtaugh&#x27;s wife in the &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; film series.

Love was invited annually by David Letterman to sing the song &quot;Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)&quot; on his late night television talk show just prior to the Christmas holidays. These performances started in 1986 on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; and continued on CBS&#x27;s &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; until 2014. Letterman called Love the &quot;Christmas Queen&quot;. In 2015 she started singing the song annually on &quot;The View&quot;.

Ranked among &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s 100 Greatest Singers, Love was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2011. Love is featured in the Oscar-winning documentary film &quot;20 Feet from Stardom&quot; (2013), for which she won a Grammy Award.

==Early life==
Love was born Darlene Wright on July 26, 1941, in Los Angeles, to Ellen Maddox and Reverend Joe Wright. Her younger sister Edna Wright grew up to be the lead singer of the group Honey Cone. She grew up mostly in Los Angeles, but also spent a few years of her youth in Texas.

As a minister&#x27;s daughter, she grew up listening to gospel music and was a dedicated member of her church. Wright began singing with her local church choir at age ten in Hawthorne, California. During choir practice she caught the attention of choir director Cora Martin-Moore. After singing for Martin-Moore she was asked to go to the Music Mart where she sang and did some broadcasts. As it was her first musical experience, it was also the main influence for her to pursue a music career.

== Music career ==

=== Early career ===

While still in high school (1957) she sang with the Echoes, a mixed gender doo-wop group. She was then invited to join a little-known girl group called the Blossoms.

In 1962, the Blossoms were hired to sing on a session by producer Phil Spector. His girl group, the Crystals, could not make it to Los Angeles in time for the session, so Wright was paid $5,000 to sing lead on &quot;He&#x27;s a Rebel.&quot; This was Wright&#x27;s first time on a Spector recording. The single, credited to the Crystals, was hurriedly released by Spector on Philles Records to get his version of the Gene Pitney song onto the market before that of Vikki Carr. The ghost release of this single came as a total surprise to the Crystals who were an experienced and much traveled girl harmony group in their own right, but they were nevertheless required to perform and promote the new single on television and on tour as if it were their own. The single reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in November 1962.

Following the release of &quot;He&#x27;s a Rebel,&quot; Wright signed a deal with Spector, who renamed her Darlene Love. She recorded &quot;He&#x27;s Sure the Boy I Love,&quot; which she thought would be released under her name, but Spector credited it to the Crystals. Cynthia Weil, who co-wrote the song with her husband Barry Mann, was unaware that Love had sung on the track: &quot;It all came out later. I think it was a terrible thing to do to her.&quot; Spector had Love sing &quot;Da Doo Ron Ron&quot; in the studio, but he decided to record it with another singer at the last minute.

Love recorded the track &quot;Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)&quot; for the 1963 holiday compilation album, &quot;A Christmas Gift for You from Phil Spector&quot;. The song was written by Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich, along with Phil Spector, with the intention of being sung by Ronnie Spector of the Ronettes. According to Love, Ronnie Spector was not able to put as much emotion into the song as needed. Instead, Love was brought into the studio to record the song, which became a large success over time and Love&#x27;s signature tune.

As a member of the Blossoms, Love contributed backing vocals behind many of the biggest hits of the 1960s including the Ronettes&#x27; &quot;Be My Baby&quot;, Shelley Fabares&#x27; &quot;Johnny Angel&quot;, Bobby &quot;Boris&quot; Pickett&#x27;s &quot;Monster Mash&quot;, Frank Sinatra&#x27;s version of &quot;That&#x27;s Life&quot;, and the Crystals&#x27; &quot;Da Doo Ron Ron&quot;. The Blossoms recorded singles, usually with little success, on Capitol 1957–58 [pre-Darlene Love], Challenge 1961–62, OKeh 1963, Reprise 1966–67, Ode 1967, MGM 1968, Bell 1969–70, and Lion 1972.

As a solo artist, Love also contributed backing vocals to the Ronettes&#x27; &quot;Baby, I Love You&quot;. She was also part of a trio called Bob B. Soxx &amp; the Blue Jeans, who recorded Spector&#x27;s version of &quot;Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah&quot;, an Oscar-winning song from the 1946 Walt Disney film &quot;Song of the South&quot;, which got into the Top 10 in 1963.

The Blossoms landed a weekly part on &quot;Shindig!&quot;, one of the top music shows of the era. They also appeared on Johnny Rivers&#x27; hits, including &quot;Poor Side of Town&quot; &quot;Baby I Need Your Loving&quot; and &quot;The Tracks of My Tears&quot;. The Blossoms were part of the &quot;Elvis Presley&#x27;s &#x27;68 Comeback Special&quot;, which aired on NBC. Love and the Blossoms sang backup for Sharon Marie (Esparza) (a Brian Wilson act), as well as John Phillips&#x27; solo album &quot;John, Wolfking of L.A.&quot;, recorded in 1969.

Into the 1970s, Love continued to work as a backup singer, before taking a break in order to raise a family. In 1973, she recorded vocals as a cheerleader along with Michelle Phillips, for the Cheech &amp; Chong single &quot;Basketball Jones&quot;, which peaked at No. 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart.

===1980s return===
Love returned to music in the early 1980s and to an appreciative audience she thought might have long since forgotten her. She had been performing at venues like the Roxy in Los Angeles, and it was a conversation with Steven Van Zandt that greased the wheels for her to go to New York and begin performing there in 1982, at places like The Bottom Line. She also sang &quot;OOO Wee Baby&quot; in the 1980 movie &quot;The Idolmaker&quot;. Along with performing in small venues, Love worked as a maid in Beverly Hills. One day while she was cleaning one of these homes, she heard her song &quot;Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)&quot; on the radio. She took this as a sign that she needed to change her life and go back to singing.

In the mid-1980s she portrayed herself in the Tony Award-nominated jukebox musical &quot;Leader of the Pack&quot;, which featured the rock and roll songs written by Ellie Greenwich, many of them for the young Love. The showstopping number of that show, &quot;River Deep - Mountain High&quot;, had been recorded by Phil Spector with Ike &amp; Tina Turner. &quot;Leader of the Pack&quot; commenced as a revue at the Greenwich Village nightclub The Bottom Line, as did the later show about Love&#x27;s life, &quot;Portrait of a Singer&quot;, which never made the move uptown. &quot;Portrait&quot; included covers of &quot;A Change Is Gonna Come&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Make Me Over&quot;, as well as &quot;River Deep, Mountain High&quot; and original music from some of the instrumental writers of early rock and roll, including Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil. Love contributed a cover of the Hollywood Argyles song &quot;Alley Oop&quot; to the soundtrack of the 1984 film &quot;Bachelor Party&quot;.

In 1986, Love&#x27;s second chance came when she was asked to sing &quot;Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)&quot; on David Letterman&#x27;s Christmas show, which became a yearly tradition.

In 1987, Love sang backup for U2&#x27;s remake of &quot;Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)&quot;.

===Later career===

In 1988, Love released the album &quot;Paint Another Picture&quot;, which included an update of her old hit &quot;He&#x27;s Sure the Man I Love&quot;, by Mann and Weill, as well as a ballad written especially for her, &quot;I&#x27;ve Never Been the Same,&quot; by Judy Wieder. The album did not make the US charts. In 1990, Cher invited Love and her sister Edna Wright as her background vocalists for the Heart of Stone Tour. Love released a minor single in 1992 with &quot;All Alone on Christmas&quot;, written by Steven Van Zandt, which can be found on the &quot;Home Alone 2: Lost in New York&quot; soundtrack. The song was also included in the British film &quot;Love Actually&quot;. Love also contributed vocals to the soundtrack of the film &quot;Jingle All the Way&quot;.

In 1993, Love sued Spector for unpaid royalties and was awarded $250,000.

Love, alongside Rob Hoerburger, editor and writer for the &quot;New York Times&quot;, wrote her autobiography titled &quot;My Name Is Love&quot;, published in 1998. In the memoir, Love writes about her life in the music industry, her years of struggle, and her present projects.

Love continues to do a Christmas show every year in New York City, which is always capped by &quot;Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)&quot;. In 2007, she released &quot;It&#x27;s Christmas of Course&quot;, an album of Christmas-themed cover versions including &quot;Happy Xmas (War is Over)&quot; by John Lennon and Yoko Ono and &quot;Thanks for Christmas&quot; by XTC. Love performed with Bruce Springsteen and the E-Street Band in November 2009 at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 25th Anniversary Concert at Madison Square Garden.

Love was the musical guest on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; on May 7, 2007, performing &quot;River Deep-Mountain High.&quot;

Love is featured in the documentary film &quot;20 Feet from Stardom&quot; (2013), which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and went on to win the Oscar for Best Documentary at the 86th Academy Awards. &quot;20 Feet from Stardom&quot; also won the 2015 Grammy Award for Best Music Film, with the award being presented to the featured artists as well as the production crew.

Love recorded a duet, &quot;He&#x27;s Sure the Boy I Love&quot;, with Bette Midler on the latter&#x27;s 2014 studio album &quot;It&#x27;s the Girls!&quot;, a collection of songs paying tribute to girl groups.

In August 2014, the Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN) announced their intention to develop a film based on Love&#x27;s life, starring singer Toni Braxton. However, no further news has surfaced about this proposal.

Love&#x27;s most recent album, &quot;Introducing Darlene Love&quot;, was released September 18, 2015 on Steve Van Zandt&#x27;s label, Wicked Cool Records. There are 10 songs on the album, including two new songs by Bruce Springsteen, and covers of Joan Jett and Elvis Costello songs, among others. In 2016, Love began touring her new album across the United States.

Love recorded her first solo video concert on February 23, 2010, at the NJPAC. &quot;Darlene Love – The Concert of Love&quot; was released as a CD and DVD later that year. The concert was also broadcast on select public television stations.

In 2023, Love reunited with Cher to sing &quot;Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)&quot; on Cher&#x27;s album &quot;Christmas.&quot;

==Acting career==
In the late 1980s and also in the 1990s, Love also began an acting career, playing Trish Murtaugh, the wife of Danny Glover&#x27;s character, in the four &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; movies.

Love has held many star roles in various Broadway productions. She acted and sang in &quot;Grease&quot;, in the short-lived musical adaptation of Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;Carrie&quot;, and starred as Motormouth Maybelle in Broadway&#x27;s &quot;Hairspray&quot; from August 2005 till April 2008. She later reprised the role in the Hollywood Bowl production of the show in 2011.

In 2019, she appeared in the Netflix original movie &quot;Holiday Rush&quot;.

In 2020, she appeared and sang in the Netflix original movie &quot;The Christmas Chronicles 2&quot;.

Her final Christmas appearance was on December 19, 2014, nine days after the official announcement that the show&#x27;s finale would be in May 2015. Letterman has stated that the annual performance is his favorite part of Christmas. She was dubbed by Letterman as the &quot;Christmas Queen&quot;. Love appeared in a reunion short with Letterman on his YouTube channel in 2023, again performing the song.

Due to the 2007 Writers Guild of America strike, Love was unable to perform on the Letterman show in 2007; a repeat of her 2006 performance was shown instead. From 2015 until 2023, Love performed the song annually on ABC&#x27;s &quot;The View&quot;, only skipping out the 2021 edition due to being exposed to a positive COVID-19 case resulting in a quarantine; a compilation of her previous performances was shown instead. She has usually performed the song as a duet, being joined by Patti LaBelle in 2016, Fantasia in 2017, and Bryan Adams in 2018. Love also performed &quot;Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)&quot; in season six, episode 10 of the Fox television series &quot;New Girl&quot; (2016).

Midler said &quot;she changed my view of the world, listening to those songs, you had to dance, you had to move, you had to keep looking for the rebel boy&quot;. Near tears, Love noted that she would turn 70 later that year, and thanked Spector &quot;for recognizing my talent and making me the main voice in his Wall of Sound&quot;. Her speech elicited a standing ovation. Later, she sang &quot;Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah&quot; with Bruce Springsteen providing a guitar solo.

In 2015, Love won her first Grammy Award for Best Music Film for the documentary &quot;20 Feet From Stardom&quot;.

<text>The Dot and the Line: A Romance in Lower Mathematics is a 1965 animated short film directed by Chuck Jones and co-directed by Maurice Noble, based on the 1963 book of the same name written and illustrated by Norton Juster, who also provided the film&#x27;s script. The film was narrated by Robert Morley and produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. It won the 1965 Academy Award for Animated Short Film and was entered into the Short Film Palme d&#x27;Or competition at the 1966 Cannes Film Festival.

== Story ==
The story details a straight blue line who is hopelessly in love with a red dot. The dot, finding the line to be stiff, dull, and conventional, turns her affections toward a wild and unkempt squiggle. Taking advantage of the line&#x27;s stiffness, the squiggle rubs it in that he is a lot more fun for the dot.

The depressed line&#x27;s friends try to get him to settle down with a female line, but he refuses. He tries to dream of greatness until he finally understands what the squiggle means and decides to be more unconventional. Willing to do whatever it takes to win the dot&#x27;s affection, the line manages to bend himself and form angle after angle until he is nothing more than a mess of sides, bends, and angles. After he straightens himself out, he settles down and focuses more responsibly on this new ability, creating shapes so complex that he has to label his sides and angles in order to keep his place.

When competing again, the squiggle claims that the line still has nothing to show to the dot. The line proves his rival wrong and is able to show the dot what she is really worth to him. When she sees this, the dot is overwhelmed by the line&#x27;s responsibility and unconventionality. She then faces the now nervous squiggle, whom she gives a chance to make his case to win her love.

The squiggle makes an effort to reclaim the dot&#x27;s heart by trying to copy what the line did, but to no avail. No matter how hard he tries to re-shape himself, the squiggle still remains the same tangled, chaotic mess of lines and curves. He tries to tell the dot a joke, but she has realized the flatness of it, and he&#x27;s forced to retreat. She realizes how much her relationship with the squiggle had been a mistake. What she thought was freedom and joy was nothing more than sloth, chaos, and anarchy.

Fed up, the dot tells the squiggle how she really feels about him, denouncing him as meaningless, undisciplined, insignificant, and out of luck. She leaves with the line, having accepted that he has much more to offer, and the punning moral is presented: &quot;To the vector belong the spoils.&quot;

== Authorship ==
Though listed as being directed by Chuck Jones, the true acting director was Maurice Noble, according to his own recollection—Noble being the long-term background artist and eventually credited as co-director on numerous projects with Jones. Chuck Jones was one of the originators for the adaptation and did the first treatment for the short. However, the results did not please the producers, who then asked Maurice Noble to take over, heavily vexing Jones. Noble recalls the handover happening somewhat dramatically as &quot;Chuck, with a big scowl on his face, came in and threw all the pieces on my big brown bookcase; he stacked the whole picture like this: plunk, plunk, plunk...and stalked out of the room.&quot;

== Legacy ==
&quot;The Dot and the Line&quot; served as the inspiration for a collection of jewelry by designer Jane A. Gordon. The short film also inspired &quot;The Dot and Line&quot;, a blog that publishes essays about cartoons and interviews with voice actors and creators including Genndy Tartakovsky, Andrea Romano, Brandon Vietti, Fred Seibert, and Natalie Palamides.

== Availability ==
The cartoon was released as a special feature on &quot;The Glass Bottom Boat&quot; DVD in 2005. The cartoon is also featured on the 2008 release of Warner Home Video&quot; Academy Awards Animation Collection&quot; and the 2011 release of the &quot;Looney Tunes Platinum Collection: Volume 1&quot; Blu-ray box-set on the third disc as a special feature. In 2005, Robert Xavier Rodriguez made a musical setting of the book for narrator and chamber ensemble with projected images, and in 2011 he made a version for full orchestra.

== Notes ==
* This was one of only two non-Tom and Jerry animated short subjects to be released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer after 1958. The other one is &quot;The Bear That Wasn&#x27;t&quot;, the final animated short released by MGM.
* &quot;The Dot and the Line&quot; won the final award for an animated short for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and it was Chuck Jones&#x27; only award as a producer.
* This was one of two Juster books to be adapted for the big screen by Chuck Jones, although Juster had no involvement with the other, &quot;The Phantom Tollbooth&quot;.
*Unlike other MGM cartoons from 1963 to 1967, the lion in this film&#x27;s opening logo is Leo instead of Tanner.

<text>The New York Central Railroad was a railroad primarily operating in the Great Lakes and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. The railroad primarily connected greater New York and Boston in the east with Chicago and St. Louis in the Midwest, along with the intermediate cities of Albany, Buffalo, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Detroit, Rochester and Syracuse. The New York Central was headquartered in the New York Central Building, adjacent to its largest station, Grand Central Terminal.

The railroad was established in 1853, consolidating several existing railroad companies. In 1968, the NYC merged with its former rival, the Pennsylvania Railroad, to form Penn Central. Penn Central went into bankruptcy in 1970 and, with extensive Federal government support, emerged as Conrail in 1976. In 1999, Conrail was broken-up, and portions of its system were transferred to CSX and Norfolk Southern Railway (NS), with CSX acquiring most of the NYC&#x27;s eastern trackage and NS acquiring most of NYC&#x27;s western trackage.

Extensive trackage existed in the states of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Massachusetts and West Virginia, plus additional trackage in portions of the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec. At the end of 1925, the New York Central Railroad operated of road and of track; at the end of 1967, the mileages were and .

==Early history==
===Pre-New York Central: 1826–1853===

==== Albany and Schenectady Railroad ====
The Mohawk and Hudson Railroad (M&amp;H) was the oldest segment of the railroad&#x27;s merger and was the first permanent railroad in the state of New York and one of the first railroads in the United States. It was chartered in 1826 to connect the Mohawk River at Schenectady, New York, to the Hudson River at Albany, providing a way for freight and especially passengers to avoid the extensive and time-consuming locks on the Erie Canal between Schenectady and Albany. The M&amp;H opened on August 9, 1831, with its first steam locomotive, the &quot;Dewitt Clinton&quot; running on its tracks. It would later change its name to the &quot;Albany and Schenectady&quot; (A&amp;S) on April 19, 1847. Until the 1840s, it used inclined planes at either end of the line to pull passenger cars up and down A&amp;S&#x27; steep hills. As locomotive technology progressed, the mainline was extended to the Mohawk River in downtown Schenectady and the Hudson River waterfront in Albany.

==== Utica and Schenectady Railroad ====
The Utica and Schenectady Railroad was chartered April 29, 1833; as the railroad paralleled the Erie Canal, it was prohibited from carrying freight. Revenue service began on August 2, 1836, extending the line of the Albany and Schenectady Railroad west from Schenectady along the north side of the Mohawk River, paralleling the Erie Canal, to Utica. Of the ten early railroads bordering the Erie Canal, the U&amp;S was the most profitable. It was headed by Erastus Corning, future president of the consolidated New York Central. On May 7, 1844, the railroad was authorized to carry freight with some restrictions, and on May 12, 1847, the ban was fully dropped, but the company still had to pay the equivalent in canal tolls to the state.

==== Syracuse and Utica Railroad ====
The Syracuse and Utica Railroad was chartered on May 11, 1836, and similarly had to pay the state for any freight displaced from the canal. The full line opened July 3, 1839, extending the line further to Syracuse via Rome (and further to Auburn via the already-opened Auburn and Syracuse Railroad). This line was not direct, going out of its way to stay near the Erie Canal and serve Rome, and so the Syracuse and Utica Direct Railroad was chartered on January 26, 1853. Nothing of that line was ever built, though the later West Shore Railroad, acquired by New York Central Railroad in 1885, served the same purpose.

==== Auburn and Syracuse Railroad ====
The Auburn and Syracuse Railroad was chartered on May 1, 1834, and opened mostly in 1838, the remaining opening on June 4, 1839. A month later, with the opening of the Syracuse and Utica Railroad, this formed a complete line from Albany west via Syracuse to Auburn. The Auburn and Rochester Railroad was chartered on May 13, 1836, as a further extension via Geneva and Canandaigua to Rochester, opening on November 4, 1841. The two lines merged on August 1, 1850, to form the rather indirect Rochester and Syracuse Railroad (known later as the Auburn Road). To fix this, the Rochester and Syracuse Direct Railway was chartered and immediately merged into the Rochester and Syracuse Railroad on August 6, 1850. That line opened June 1, 1853, running much more directly between those two cities, roughly parallel to the Erie Canal.

==== Buffalo and Rochester Railroad ====
The Tonawanda Railroad, to the west of Rochester, was chartered on April 24, 1832, to build from that city to Attica. The first section, from Rochester southwest to Batavia, opened May 5, 1837, and the rest of the line to Attica opened on January 8, 1843. The Attica and Buffalo Railroad was chartered in 1836 and opened on November 24, 1842, running from Buffalo southeast to Attica. When the Auburn and Rochester Railroad opened in 1841, there was no connection at Rochester to the Tonawanda Railroad, but with that exception there was now an all-rail line between Buffalo and Albany. On March 19, 1844, the Tonawanda Railroad was authorized to build the connection, and it opened later that year. The Albany and Schenectady Railroad bought all the baggage, mail and emigrant cars of the other railroads between Albany and Buffalo on February 17, 1848, and began operating through cars.

On December 7, 1850, the Tonawanda Railroad and Attica and Buffalo Railroad merged to form the Buffalo and Rochester Railroad. A new direct line opened from Buffalo east to Batavia on April 26, 1852, and the old line between Depew (east of Buffalo) and Attica was sold to the Buffalo and New York City Railroad on November 1. The line was added to the New York and Erie Railroad system and converted to the Erie&#x27;s broad gauge.

==== Schenectady and Troy Railroad ====
The Schenectady and Troy Railroad was chartered in 1836 and opened in 1842, providing another route between the Hudson River and Schenectady, with its Hudson River terminal at Troy.

==== Rochester, Lockport, and Niagara Falls Railroad ====
The Lockport and Niagara Falls Railroad was originally incorporated on April 24, 1834, to run from Lockport on the Erie Canal west to Niagara Falls; the line opened in 1838 and was sold on June 2, 1850. On December 14, 1850, it was reorganized as the Rochester, Lockport and Niagara Falls Railroad, and an extension east to Rochester opened on July 1, 1852. The railroad was consolidated into the New York Central Railroad under the act of 1853. A portion of the line is currently operated as the Falls Road Railroad.

==== Buffalo and Lockport Railroad ====
The Buffalo and Lockport Railroad was chartered on April 27, 1852, to build a branch of the Rochester, Lockport and Niagara Falls from Lockport towards Buffalo. It opened in 1854, running from Lockport to Tonawanda, where it joined the Buffalo and Niagara Falls Railroad, opened in 1837, for the rest of the way to Buffalo.

==== Mohawk Valley Railroad ====
The Mohawk Valley Railroad was chartered on January 21, 1851, and reorganized on December 28, 1852, to build a railroad on the south side of the Mohawk River from Schenectady to Utica, next to the Erie Canal and opposite the Utica and Schenectady. The company didn&#x27;t build a line before it was absorbed, though the West Shore Railroad was later built on that location.

==== Syracuse and Utica Direct Railroad ====
The Syracuse and Utica Direct Railroad was chartered in 1853 to rival the Syracuse and Utica Railroad by building a more direct route, reducing travel time by a half-hour. The company was merged before any line could be built.

===1853 company formation===
Albany industrialist and Mohawk Valley Railroad owner Erastus Corning managed to unite the above railroads together into one system, and on March 17, 1853, executives and stockholders of each company agreed to merge. The merger was approved by the state legislature on April 2 and, on May 17, 1853, the New York Central Railroad was formed.

Soon the Buffalo and State Line Railroad and Erie and North East Railroad converted to from broad gauge and connected directly with the railroad in Buffalo, providing a through route to Erie, Pennsylvania.

===Erastus Corning years: 1853–1867===
The Rochester and Lake Ontario Railroad was organized in 1852 and opened in fall 1853; it was leased to the Rochester, Lockport and Niagara Falls Railroad, which became part of New York Central Railroad, before opening. In 1855, it was merged into the railroad, providing a branch from Rochester north to Charlotte on Lake Ontario.

The Buffalo and Niagara Falls Railroad was also merged into the railroad in 1855. It had been chartered in 1834 and opened in 1837, providing a line between Buffalo and Niagara Falls. It was leased to New York Central Railroad in 1853.

Also in 1855 came the merger with the Lewiston Railroad, running from Niagara Falls north to Lewiston. It was chartered in 1836 and opened in 1837, without connections to other railroads. In 1854, a southern extension opened to the Buffalo and Niagara Falls Railroad and the line was leased to the railroad.

The Canandaigua and Niagara Falls Railroad was chartered in 1851. The first stage opened in 1853 from Canandaigua on the Auburn Road west to Batavia on the main line. A continuation west to North Tonawanda opened later that year and, in 1854, a section opened in Niagara Falls connecting it to the Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge. New York Central Railroad bought the company at bankruptcy in 1858 and reorganized it as the Niagara Bridge and Canandaigua Railroad, merging it into itself in 1890.

The Saratoga and Hudson River Railroad was chartered in 1864 and opened in 1866 as a branch of the railroad from Athens Junction, southeast of Schenectady, southeast and south to Athens on the west side of the Hudson River. On September 9, 1876, the company was merged into the railroad, but in 1876 the terminal at Athens burned down and the line was abandoned.

The primary repair shops were established in Corning&#x27;s hometown of Albany along with a classification yard and livestock pens on 300 acres of land (known as West Albany). Facilities included locomotive shops, freight and passenger car shops, and roundhouse terminals. These were the New York Central&#x27;s primary back shops until the end of steam in 1957.

===Hudson River Railroad===
The Troy and Greenbush Railroad was chartered in 1845 and opened later that year, connecting Troy south to Greenbush (now Rensselaer) on the east side of the Hudson River. The Hudson River Railroad was chartered on May 12, 1846, to extend this line south to New York City; the full line opened on October 3, 1851. Prior to completion, on June 1, it leased the Troy and Greenbush.

Cornelius Vanderbilt obtained control of the Hudson River Railroad in 1864, soon after he bought the parallel New York and Harlem Railroad.

Along the line of the Hudson River Railroad, the West Side Line was built in 1934 in the borough of Manhattan as an elevated bypass of then-abandoned street running trackage on Tenth and Eleventh Avenues. The elevated section has since been abandoned, and the tunnel north of 35th Street is used only by Amtrak trains to New York Penn Station (all other trains use the Spuyten Duyvil and Port Morris Railroad to reach the Harlem Line). The surviving sections of the West Side Line south of 34th Street reopened as the High Line, a linear park built between 2009 and 2014.

===Vanderbilt years: 1867–1954===

In 1867, Cornelius Vanderbilt acquired control of the Albany to Buffalo-running New York Central Railroad, with the help of maneuverings related to the Hudson River Bridge in Albany. On November 1, 1869, he merged the railroad with his Hudson River Railroad to form the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad. This extended the system south from Albany along the east bank of the Hudson River to New York City, with the leased Troy and Greenbush Railroad running from Albany north to Troy.

Vanderbilt&#x27;s other lines were operated as part of the railroad included the New York and Harlem Railroad, Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway, Canada Southern Railway, and Michigan Central Railroad.

The Spuyten Duyvil and Port Morris Railroad was chartered in 1869 and opened in 1871, providing a route on the north side of the Harlem River for trains along the Hudson River to head southeast to the New York and Harlem Railroad. Trains could head toward Grand Central Depot, built by NYC and opened in 1871, or to the freight facilities at Port Morris. From opening, it was leased by the NYC.

The Geneva and Lyons Railroad was organized in 1877 and opened in 1878, leased by the NYC from opening. This was a connection between Syracuse and Rochester, running from the main line at Lyons to the Auburn Road at Geneva. It was merged into the NYC in 1890.

In 1885, the New York, West Shore and Buffalo Railway, a competitor since 1883 with trackage along the west shore of the Hudson River and on to Buffalo closely paralleling the NYC, was taken over by the NYC as the West Shore Railroad and developed passenger, freight, and car float operations at Weehawken Terminal. The NYC assumed control of the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie and Boston and Albany Railroads in 1887 and 1900, respectively, with both roads remaining as independently-operating subsidiaries. William H. Newman, president of the New York Central lines, resigned in 1909. Newman had been president since 1901, when he replaced Samuel R. Callaway (who had replaced Depew as president in 1898).

In 1914, the operations of eleven subsidiaries were merged with the New York Central &amp; Hudson River Railroad, re-forming the New York Central Railroad. From the beginning of the merger, the railroad was publicly referred to as the New York Central Lines. In the summer of 1935, the identification was changed to the New York Central System, that name being kept until the merger with the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1968.

The Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway, also known as the Big Four, was formed on June 30, 1889, by the merger of the Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati and Indianapolis Railway, the Cincinnati, Indianapolis, St. Louis and Chicago Railway and the Indianapolis and St. Louis Railway. The following year, the company gained control of the former Indiana Bloomington and Western Railway. By 1906, the Big Four was itself acquired by the New York Central Railroad. It operated independently until 1930; it was then referred to as the Big Four Route. In 1930, New York Central Railroad acquired a 99-year lease of both Michigan Central and the &quot;Big Four&quot; (Cleveland, Chicago Cincinnati &amp; St. Louis Railroad). 

The back shops at West Albany, New York were unable to keep up with repairs to rolling stock, so additional shops were established east of Buffalo at Depew (1892), Croton-on-Hudson (Harmon Shops, 1907), and Oak Grove, Pennsylvania (Avis Shops, 1902). The Harmon Shops were particularly important as locomotive power was switched out from steam to electric at that point as trains approached New York City.

=== Topography ===
The generally level topography of the NYC system had a character distinctively different from the mountainous terrain of its archrival, the Pennsylvania Railroad. Most of its major routes, including New York to Chicago, followed rivers and had no significant grades other than West Albany Hill and the Berkshire Hills on the Boston and Albany. This influenced a great deal about the line, from advertising to locomotive design, built around its flagship New York-Chicago Water Level Route.

===Bypasses===
A number of bypasses and cutoffs were built around congested areas.

The Junction Railroad&#x27;s Buffalo Belt Line opened in 1871, providing a bypass of Buffalo to the northeast as well as a loop route for passenger trains via downtown. The West Shore Railroad, acquired in 1885, provided a bypass around Rochester. The Terminal Railway&#x27;s Gardenville Cutoff, allowing through traffic to bypass Buffalo to the southeast, opened in 1898.

The Schenectady Detour consisted of two connections to the West Shore Railroad, allowing through trains to bypass downtown Schenectady. The full project opened in 1902. The Cleveland Short Line Railway built a bypass of Cleveland, Ohio, completed in 1912. In 1924, the Alfred H. Smith Memorial Bridge was constructed as part of the Hudson River Connecting Railroad&#x27;s Castleton Cut-Off, a 27.5-mile-long freight bypass of the congested West Albany terminal area and West Albany Hill.

An unrelated realignment was made in the 1910s at Rome, when the Erie Canal was realigned and widened onto a new alignment south of downtown Rome. The NYC main line was shifted south out of downtown to the south bank of the new canal. A bridge was built southeast of downtown, roughly where the old main line crossed the path of the canal, to keep access to and from the southeast. West of downtown, the old main line was abandoned, but a brand-new railroad line was built, running north from the NYC main line to the NYC&#x27;s former Rome, Watertown and Ogdensburg Railroad, allowing all NYC through traffic to bypass Rome.

===Trains===

Steam locomotives of the New York Central Railroad were optimized for speed on that flat raceway of a main line, rather than slow mountain lugging. Famous locomotives of the system included the well-known 4-6-4 Hudsons, particularly the 1937–38 J-3a&#x27;s; 4-8-2 World War II–era 1940 L-3 and 1942 L-4 Mohawks; and the 1945–46 S-class Niagaras: fast 4-8-4 locomotives often considered the epitome of their breed by steam locomotive aficionados (railfans).

For the first two-thirds of the 20th century, New York Central Railroad had some of the most famous trains in the United States. The &quot;20th Century Limited&quot; (&quot;Century&quot;), begun in 1902, ran between Grand Central Terminal in New York City and LaSalle Street Station in Chicago, and was its most famous train, known for its red-carpet treatment and first-class service. Its last run was made on December 2–3, 1967.

In the mid-1930s, many railroad companies were introducing streamlined locomotives; until the New York Central introduced the &quot;Commodore Vanderbilt&quot;, all were diesel-electric. The &quot;Vanderbilt&quot; was the NYC&#x27;s first streamlined steam locomotive.

The railroad hosted the streamlined steam-powered Rexall Train of 1936, which toured 47 states to promote the Rexall chain of drug stores and to provide space for company conventions. The steam-powered &quot;Century&quot;, which followed the Water Level Route, could complete the 960.7-mile trip in 16 hours after its June 15, 1938 streamlining (and did it in 15 hours for a short period after World War II). Also famous were the NYC&#x27;s &quot;Empire State Express&quot;, which traveled from New York City through upstate New York to Buffalo and Cleveland, and the &quot;Ohio State Limited&quot;, which ran between New York City and Cincinnati.

At various times, beginning in 1946 and continuing into the mid-1950s, the &quot;Century&quot; and other NYC trains exchanged sleeping cars in Chicago with western trains such as the &quot;Super Chief&quot; and the &quot;City of San Francisco&quot;. The cars, which contained roomettes, double bedrooms and drawing rooms, provided through sleeper service between New York City and Los Angeles or San Francisco (Oakland Pier).

Despite having some of the most modern steam locomotives anywhere, NYC&#x27;s difficult financial position caused it to convert to more-economical diesel-electric power rapidly. The Boston and Albany line was completely dieselized by 1951. All lines east of Cleveland, Ohio were dieselized between August 7, 1953 (east of Buffalo) and September 1953 (Cleveland-Buffalo). Niagaras were all retired by July 1956. On May 3, 1957, H7e class 2-8-2 Mikado type steam locomotive No. 1977 is reported to have been the last steam locomotive to retire from service on the railroad. But, the economics of northeastern railroading became so dire that not even this switch could change things for the better.

The New York Central had a network of commuter lines in New York and Massachusetts. Westchester County, New York had the railroad&#x27;s Hudson, Harlem, and Putnam lines into Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan (Putnam Division trains required a change at High Bridge, New York), while New Jersey and Rockland County, New York were serviced by the West Shore Line between Weehawken and Kingston, New York, on the west side of the Hudson River.

==Decline==
The New York Central, like many U.S. railroads, declined after the Second World War. Problems resurfaced that had plagued the railroad industry before the war, such as over-regulation by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), which severely regulated the rates charged by the railroad, along with continuing competition from automobiles and trucks. These problems were coupled with even more-formidable forms of competition, such as airline service in the 1950s that began to deprive NYC of its long-distance passenger trade. The Interstate Highway Act of 1956 helped create a network of government subsidized highways for motor vehicle travel throughout the country, enticing more people to travel by car, as well as haul freight by truck. The 1959 opening of the Saint Lawrence Seaway also adversely affected NYC freight business: container shipments could now be directly shipped to ports along the Great Lakes, eliminating the railroads&#x27; freight hauls between the east and the Midwest.

The NYC also carried a substantial tax burden from governments that saw rail infrastructure as a source of property tax revenuestaxes that were not imposed upon interstate highways. To make matters worse, most railroads, including the NYC, were saddled with a World War II-era tax of 15% on passenger fares, which remained until 1962: 17 years after the end of the war.

===Robert R. Young: 1954–1958===
In June 1954, management of the New York Central System lost a proxy fight in 1954 to Robert Ralph Young and the Alleghany Corporation he led.

Alleghany Corporation was a real estate and railroad empire, built by the Van Sweringen brothers of Cleveland in the 1920s, that had controlled the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&amp;O) and the Nickel Plate Road. It fell under the control of Young and financier Allan Price Kirby during the Great Depression.

Young was considered a railroad visionary but found the NYC in worse shape than he had imagined. Unable to keep his promises, Young was forced to suspend dividend payments in January 1958. He committed suicide later that month at his mansion in Palm Beach, Florida.

===Alfred E. Perlman: 1958–1968===
After Young&#x27;s suicide, his role in NYC management was assumed by Alfred E. Perlman, who had been working with the NYC under Young since 1954. Despite the dismal financial condition of the railroad, Perlman was able to streamline operations and save the company money. In 1959, Perlman was able to reduce operating deficits by $7.7 million, which nominally raised NYC stock to $1.29 per share, producing dividends of an amount not seen since the end of the war. By 1964 he was able to reduce the NYC long-term debt by nearly $100 million, while reducing passenger deficits from $42 to $24.6 million.

Perlman also enacted several modernization projects throughout the railroad. Notable was the use of Centralized Traffic Control (CTC) systems on many of the NYC lines, which reduced the four-track mainline to two tracks. He oversaw construction and/or modernization of many hump or classification yards, notably the $20 million Selkirk Yard, which opened south of Albany in 1924 and was modernized in 1966. Perlman also experimented with jet trains, creating a Budd RDC car (the M-497 Black Beetle) powered by two J47 jet engines stripped from a B-36 Peacemaker bomber as a solution to increasing car and airplane competition. This project did not leave the prototype stage.

Perlman&#x27;s cuts resulted in the curtailing of many of the railroad&#x27;s services; commuter lines around New York were particularly affected. In 1958–1959, service was suspended on the NYC&#x27;s Putnam Division in Westchester and Putnam counties, and the NYC abandoned its ferry service across the Hudson to Weehawken Terminal. This harmed the railroad&#x27;s West Shore Line, which ran along the west bank of the Hudson River from Jersey City to Albany, which saw long-distance service to Albany discontinued in 1958 and commuter service between Jersey City and West Haverstraw, New York terminated in 1959. Ridding itself of most of its commuter service proved impossible due to the heavy use of these lines around metro New York, where governments mandated that the railroad still operate.

Many long-distance and regional passenger trains were either discontinued or downgraded in service, with coaches replacing Pullman, parlor, and sleeping cars on routes in Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio. The Empire Corridor between Albany and Buffalo saw service greatly reduced, with service beyond Buffalo to Niagara Falls discontinued in 1961. On December 3, 1967, most of the great long-distance trains ended, including the famed &quot;Twentieth Century Limited&quot;. The railroad&#x27;s branch-line service off the Empire Corridor in upstate New York was also gradually discontinued, the last being its Adirondack Division line between Utica and Lake Placid, on April 24, 1965. Many of the railroad&#x27;s great train stations in Rochester, Schenectady, and Albany were demolished or abandoned. Despite the savings these cuts created, it was apparent that, if the railroad was to become solvent again, a more permanent solution was needed.

== Demise ==

===Merger with the Pennsylvania Railroad===
One problem that many of the Northeastern railroads faced was the fact that the railroad market was saturated for the dwindling rail traffic that remained. The NYC had to compete with its two biggest rivals: the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O), in addition to more moderate-size railroads such as the Delaware, Lackawanna, and Western Railroad (DLW), the Erie Railroad, the Reading Company, the Central Railroad of New Jersey and the Lehigh Valley Railroad.

Mergers of these railroads seemed a promising way for these companies to streamline operations and reduce the competition. The DL&amp;W and Erie railroads had showed some success when they began merging their operations in 1958, finally leading to the formation of the Erie Lackawanna Railroad in 1960.

Other mergers combined the Virginian Railway, Wabash Railroad, Nickel Plate Road and several others into the Norfolk and Western Railway (N&amp;W) system, and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O), Western Maryland Railway (WM) and Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&amp;O) combined with others to form the Chessie System. Heavy streamlining and reduction in passenger services led to the success of many of these mergers.

Following this trend, the NYC began to look for a potential railroad to merge with as early as the mid-1950s and had originally sought-out mergers with the B&amp;O, Milwaukee Road and the NYC-controlled Nickel Plate Road. Unlike the aforementioned mergers, however, a NYC merger proved tricky due to the fact that it still operated a fairly-extensive amount of regional and commuter passenger services that was under mandates by the Interstate Commerce Commission to maintain.

It soon became apparent that the only other railroad with enough capital to allow for a potentially-successful merger was the NYC&#x27;s chief rival, the PRR: itself a railroad that still had a large passenger trade. Merger talks between the two roads were discussed as early as 1955; however, this was delayed due to a number of factors: among them, interference by the Interstate Commerce Commission, objections from operating unions, concerns from competing railroads and the inability of the two companies themselves to formulate a merger plan, thus delaying progress for over a decade.

Two major points of contention centered on which railroad should have the majority controlling-interest going into the merger. Perlman&#x27;s cost-cutting during the &#x27;50s and &#x27;60s put NYC in a more financially-healthy situation than the PRR. Nevertheless, the ICC, with urging by PRR President Stuart T. Saunders, wanted the PRR to absorb the NYC. Another point centered on the ICC&#x27;s wanting to force the bankrupt New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad, better known as the New Haven, into the new system, which it did in 1969: something to which both companies strongly objected (with excellent financial cause). Eventually, both points would ultimately lead to the new Penn Central&#x27;s demise.

On January 26, 1968, the NYC&#x27;s last passenger timetable became effective. The final timetable revealed a drastically truncated schedule in anticipation of its merger with the PRR. Most local and long-distance passenger service had ended on December 3, 1967, including that of the &quot;20th Century Limited&quot;.

===Penn Central: 1968–1976===
On February 1, 1968, the New York Central was absorbed by the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Pennsylvania Railroad was renamed Pennsylvania New York Central Transportation Company and then eventually renamed to the Penn Central Transportation Company (PC), with NYC&#x27;s Perlman elected as PC&#x27;s president. PC was quickly saddled with debt when the ICC forced the money-losing New Haven into the railroad in 1969. Additionally, there was a conflict between Perlman and PC&#x27;s CEO Stuart T. Saunders, where the former requested $25 million to refurbish PC&#x27;s freight car roster and the latter declined, thus leading to Perlman&#x27;s resignation.

The two companies&#x27; competing corporate cultures, union interests and incompatible operating and computer systems sabotaged any hope for a success. Additionally, in an effort to look profitable, the board of directors authorized the use of the railroad&#x27;s reserve cash to pay dividends to company stockholders. Nevertheless, on June 1, 1970, Penn Central declared bankruptcy: the largest private bankruptcy in the United States up to that time. Under bankruptcy protection, many of Penn Central&#x27;s outstanding debts owed to other railroads were frozen, while debts owed to Penn Central by the other roads were not. This sent a trickle effect throughout the already-fragile railroad industry, forcing many of the other Northeastern railroads into insolvency: among them the Erie Lackawanna, Boston and Maine, Central Railroad of New Jersey, the Reading Company and the Lehigh Valley.

Penn Central marked the last hope of privately funded passenger rail service in the United States. In response to the bankruptcy, President Richard Nixon signed into law the Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970 which formed the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, better known as Amtrak: a government-subsidized railroad system. On May 1, 1971, Amtrak took over the operation of most regional and long-distance intercity passenger trains in the United States. Amtrak would eventually assume ownership of the Northeast Corridor, a mostly-electrified route between Boston and Washington, D.C., inherited primarily from the PRR and New Haven systems. Penn Central and the other railroads were still obligated to operate their commuter services for the next five years while in bankruptcy, eventually turning them over to the newly formed Conrail in 1976. There was some hope that Penn Central, and the other Northeastern railroads, could be restructured toward profitability once their burdensome passenger deficits were unloaded. However, this was not to be, and the railroads never recovered from their respective bankruptcies.

===Conrail and CSX: 1976–present===
Conrail, officially the Consolidated Rail Corporation, created by the U.S. government to salvage Penn Central and the other bankrupt railroads&#x27; freight business, beginning its operations on April 1, 1976. As mentioned, Conrail assumed control of Penn Central&#x27;s commuter lines throughout the Lower Hudson Valley of New York, Connecticut, and in and around Boston. In 1983, these commuter services would be turned over to the state-funded Metro-North Railroad in New York and Connecticut, and Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority in Massachusetts. Conrail would go on to achieve profitability by the 1990s and was sought by several other large railroads in a continuing trend of mergers, eventually having its assets absorbed by CSX and Norfolk Southern in 1999.

Conrail, in an effort to streamline its operations, was forced to abandon miles of both NYC and PRR trackage. Nevertheless, the majority of the NYC system is still intact and used by both CSX and Amtrak. Among the lines still used are the famed Water Level Route between New York and Chicago, as well as the former Boston &amp; Albany line between these points, the Kankakee Belt Route through Indiana, Illinois and Iowa, and the West Shore Line between Jersey City and the Albany suburb of Selkirk, where the old NYC (now CSX) Selkirk Yard is among the busiest freight yards in the country.

On June 6, 1998, most of Conrail was split between Norfolk Southern and CSX. New York Central Lines LLC was formed as a subsidiary of Conrail, containing the lines to be operated by CSX: this included the old Water Level Route as far as Cleveland, Ohio (the Cleveland–Chicago portion going to Norfolk Southern since the ex-PRR Fort Wayne line had been downgraded under Conrail), the Big Four route between Cleveland and St. Louis, and many other lines of the New York Central, as well as various lines from other companies, and also assumed the NYC reporting mark. CSX eventually fully absorbed the subsidiary as part of a streamlining of Conrail operations.

<doc id="345658" wikidata="Q1071109" url="?curid=345658" title="Chevrolet Chevelle">
<text>The Chevrolet Chevelle is a mid-sized automobile that was produced by Chevrolet in three generations for the 1964 through 1977 model years. Part of the General Motors (GM) A-body platform, the Chevelle was one of Chevrolet&#x27;s most successful nameplates. Body styles included coupes, sedans, convertibles, and station wagons. The &quot;Super Sport&quot; versions were produced through the 1973 model year and Lagunas from 1973 through to 1976.

After a four-year absence, the El Camino was reintroduced as part of the new Chevelle lineup in 1964.

The G-body Monte Carlo, introduced in 1970, also used a platform based heavily on the Chevelle platform, although it was lengthened ahead of the firewall.

From 1964 through 1969, GM of Canada sold a modified version of the Chevelle that included a Pontiac-style grille, and a LeMans instrument panel, marketed as the Beaumont.

The Malibu was the top-of-the-line model through 1972, and completely replaced the Chevelle nameplate starting with the redesigned, and downsized 1978 model year.
==First generation (1964–1967)==
===Overview===
The automobile marketplace was changing significantly during the early 1960s and featured increased competition in the smaller-sized car segments. The domestic Big Three automakers (General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler) were responding to the success of American Motors&#x27; compact Rambler American, and Classic models that made AMC the leading maker of small cars for several years and increasing Rambler on the 1961 domestic sales charts to third-place behind Chevrolet and Ford. The innovative Chevrolet Corvair, and the Chevy II, which was designed to compete with Ford&#x27;s Falcon, were losing ground. Ford released the mid-sized Fairlane in 1962, to which Chevrolet responded with the 1964 Chevelle based on a new A platform design. Built on a wheelbase, the new Chevelle was similar in size, simplicity, and concept to what was classified as the &quot;standard-sized&quot; 1955–1957 Chevrolet models. The Chevelle was the U.S. auto industry&#x27;s only all-new car for 1964, and was positioned to fill the gap between the small Chevy II and the full-sized Chevrolet models. Introduced in August 1963 by &quot;Bunkie&quot; Knudsen, the achieved sales of 338,286 for the year.

Originally conceived as an upsizing of the Chevy II with a unibody platform (similar to the Fairlane, and the full-size Chrysler B-platform of the same era), which originated with the XP-726 program, GM&#x27;s &quot;senior compact&quot; A-platform used a body-on-frame construction using a suspension setup similar to its full-sized automobiles with a four-link rear suspension (the axle has four control arms which are attached to the frame with rear coil springs sandwiched between the axle, and spring pocket—this design was used with the B platform vehicles). The name &quot;chevelle&quot; has been speculated as influenced by &quot;gazelle&quot; and &quot;Chevrolet&quot; combined, as a smaller sedan to the Impala.

Two-door hardtop coupes, and convertibles, four-door sedans, and four-door station wagons were offered throughout the entire run. This also included a coupe utility (El Camino) derivative of the two-door wagon. In line with other Chevrolet series, the two-door hardtops were called Sport coupes. Four-door hardtops, dubbed Sport Sedans, were available (1966 through 1972). A two-door sedan and station wagon was available in 1964 and 1965 in the base 300 series. These economy-focused models included a simulated floor carpet made of vinyl-coated rubber color-matched to four available interior colors. The station wagons were marketed with exclusive nameplates: Greenbrier (previously used with the Corvair based vans), Concours, and Concours Estate. Two six-cylinder engines, and several V8s were offered in every model.

Chevelles were also assembled, and sold in Canada. While similar to their stateside counterparts, the convertible was available in the base Chevelle series, a model never offered in the United States. The Chevelle was the basis for the Beaumont, a retrimmed model sold only in Canada by Pontiac dealers through 1969.

===Chevelle SS===

The Chevelle Super Sport, or SS, represented Chevrolet&#x27;s entry into the muscle car battle. In early 1964 and 1965, Chevelles had a Malibu SS badge on the rear quarter panel. Chevelles with the mid-1965 Z-16 option, priced at US$1,501 (~$ in ) in 1965, had the emblem on the front fender as well as distinct in-house style numbers: 737 for the hardtop, and 767 for the convertible. 
The $162 Super Sport package was available on the upscale Malibu two-door hardtop, and convertible models; the option added special exterior brightwork with SS emblems, and the 14-inch full-disc wheel covers from the Impala SS. Inside, the vinyl bucket-seat interior featured a floor console for models equipped with the optional Muncie aluminum four-speed manual or Powerglide two-speed automatic instead of the standard three-speed manual. Malibu SS also came with a four-gauge cluster instead of engine warning lights, and a dash-mounted tachometer was optional. The available 283-cubic-inch four-barrel V8 engine was rated at , the same rating as the 1957 Chevrolet Power-Pak 283 engine.

Starting in mid-1964, the Chevelle could be ordered with the division&#x27;s 327-cubic-inch V8, in either 250 or . Both used a four-barrel carburetor, and 10.5:1 compression. For 1965, Chevrolet added the 350-hp 327 V8 as a Regular Production Option (RPO) L79. 
A total of 294,160 Chevelles were built in the first year, including 76,860 SS models. After 1965, the Malibu SS badge disappeared except for those sold in Canada. A limited 201 Malibu SS 396 &#x27;Z-16&#x27; big-block-equipped cars were also eventually produced starting in late 1965, with most being built between mid-March and mid-April.
The Chevelle SS 396 became a series of its own in 1966 with series/style numbers 13817 and 13867.
SS396 sport coupes, and convertibles used the same Malibu sport coupe and convertible bodies with reinforced frames. The front suspension was revised with higher-rate springs, recalibrated shocks, and a thicker front stabilizer bar, but with different exterior trim. They also had simulated hood scoops, red-stripe tires, and bright trim moldings. The engines included three V8s – the standard, rated at , an optional , and an optional (the mid-horsepower 396 was rated at for 1966 and thereafter). The SS 396 series lasted from 1966 through 1968 before being relegated to an option package in 1969. The 1966 and 1967 model years were the only two years of the &#x27;strut back&#x27; 2-door sport coupe with its style number, 17.

In Canada, Chevelles continued to have &quot;Malibu SS&quot; badges for the 1966, and early 1967 model years. These Chevelles were available with the same equipment as non-SS Malibu models in the U.S., and did not get the domed hood or the blackout front, and rear treatment. Redline tires were not available on Canadian Chevelles in 1966. A 1966 Malibu SS factory photo shows wheel covers on the car from the 1965 Impala. The Canadian Malibu SS got its &quot;SS&quot; name from the &quot;Sports Option&quot; package under RPO A51 and was primarily a trim option. This A51 option included bucket seats, a center console (except when the three-speed manual transmission was ordered), standard full-wheel covers, and ribbed rocker panel moldings. The &quot;Malibu SS&quot; emblems were carried over from the 1965 Malibu SS series. This Canadian option could be ordered with any six-cylinder or V8 engine. Starting in January 1967, the Chevelle SS396 became available. It was the 138xx series, the same as in the U.S. Produced at the Oshawa, Ontario production facility, only 867 SS 396 models were produced during 1967.

====Z-16 SS 396====
Only 200 regular production 1965 Z-16 Chevelles were built at the Kansas City plant. The Z-16 option included the convertible boxed frame, a narrowed rear axle, and brake assemblies from the contemporary Impala, heavy-duty suspension, plus virtually all Chevelle comfort, and convenience options. The Z-16 standard big-block 396 Turbo-Jet V8 (fitted with hydraulic lifters instead of the solid lifters of the same motor used in the Corvette) came only with the Muncie wide-ratio four-speed manual transmission. The rear panel of the Z-16 had unique black, and chrome trim which framed untrimmed Chevelle 300-style taillights (Malibu and Malibu SS models had bright silver-painted lens trim).

The prototype Z-16 Chevelle was built at the Baltimore plant. One prototype, and the 200 production units comprise the often-quoted 201 figure. All were two-door hardtops. One convertible was reportedly specially built for Chevy General Manager Knudsen, but was destroyed. Approximately 75 Z-16s are presently accounted for.

===New body 1966–1967===
1966 saw a complete restyle of the Chevelle on the previous frame that included smooth contours, a broad new grille, bumper treatment, and curved side windows. Bulging rear fender lines, and a &quot;flying buttress&quot; roofline (tunneled into the &quot;C&quot; pillar) were highlights of the 1966 hardtops, shared with other GM &quot;A&quot; body models. The new body reflected the &quot;Coke bottle&quot; body shape that became the fad for American cars in the mid-1960s. A four-door hardtop-styled Sport Sedan joined the Malibu series. It was available through 1972, but it never achieved production as the pillared sedan. Chevelles continued in 300, 300 Deluxe, and Malibu trims. Optional engines included a 220-horsepower 283-cubic-inch V8 and a 327-cubic-inch V8. Options included a tachometer, mag-style wheel covers, sintered-metallic brakes, four-way power seats, a tissue dispenser, and cruise control.
The 1967 models received a facelift. Large wraparound taillamps went into a new rear end with standard backup lights. &quot;What you&#x27;ll see inside,&quot; claimed the sales brochure for the 1967 Chevelle, &quot;will probably bring on a severe compulsion to go driving.&quot; Front disc brakes were available on all models, and a new dual master cylinder brake system incorporated a warning light. Chevrolet also added 14-inch wheels, and a three-speed automatic transmission to their line of transmissions. New safety equipment became standard, including a collapsible steering column. The SS396 continued as a separate model in hardtop and convertible body styles. The 375-horsepower 396-cubic-inch V8 was unavailable until late in the model year, and returned with 612 being sold. Seven transmissions were available: two manual three-speeds, two manual four-speeds, an overdrive three-speed, and two automatics. The Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission included a manual-shift selection. Options included Superlift air shock absorbers, Strato-ease headrests, and full instrumentation.
==Second generation (1968–1972)==
===Overview===
The 1968 Chevelle received an all-new sculpted body with tapered front fenders and a rounded beltline. The car adopted a long-hood/short-deck profile with a high rear-quarter &quot;kick-up.&quot; While all 1967 Chevelle models rode a 115in (2921mm) wheelbase, the 1968 coupes and convertibles rode a 112in (2844mm) wheelbase. The 4 door sedans and wagons turned to a 116in (2946mm) span. Tread width grew an inch front and rear. Hardtop coupes featured a semi-fastback, flowing roofline with a long hood and short deck, influenced by the all-new Camaro. The fastback appearance was a revival of a streamlining bodystyle on all GM products from 1942 until 1950, as demonstrated on the Chevrolet Fleetline. Top-trim models (including the SS 396 and new luxury Concours) featured GM&#x27;s new Hide-A-Way wiper system. Lesser Chevelles would get that change later.

The entry-level Chevelle 300 (131 - 132 VIN prefix) was available as a pillared coupe or station wagon (Nomad) while the 300 Deluxe and Nomad Custom (133 or 134 VIN prefix) had a 2-door hardtop added to the lineup (fourth and fifth VIN characters will be 37; with the previous 300 Deluxe the hardtop was available with the Malibu and SS396 but not the base 300/Deluxe in the USA not counting those produced for the Canadian market). The Super Sport (SS396 sport coupe, convertible, and El Camino pickup) became a series on its own. Chevrolet produced 60,499 SS 396 sport coupes, 2,286 convertibles, and 5,190 El Caminos; 1968 was the only year the El Camino body style would get its own SS396 series designation (13880).

Government-mandated side marker lighting was incorporated, with early 1968 SS 396 light bezels with the SS 396 nomenclature - at some point in the later production cycle, the engine callout had a 396 also shared with the Chevy II Nova SS (the side marker bezels, also sourced from the Chevy II Nova in 307, 327, and 396 displacements) had the engine displacement except for the six-cylinder models). Black-accented Super Sports had F70x14 red-stripe tires and a standard 325-horsepower 396-cubic-inch Turbo-Jet V8 engine with the unique twin-domed hood; 350 and 375-horsepower 396 engines were optional. The SS 396 sport coupe started at $2,899 - or $236 more than a comparable Malibu with its 307-cubic-inch V8. All-vinyl bucket seats and a console were optional. Three luxury Concours options became available in March 1968 for the four-door sedan, four-door hardtop, and two-door hardtop). They consisted of special sound insulation and a deep-padded instrument panel with simulated woodgrain accents and all-vinyl color-keyed interiors. Interiors were sourced and shared with select Buick, Oldsmobile, or Pontiac A body patterns - during the middle of the 1968 model year, some Chevrolet A-bodies (including the El Camino) ended up with interior door panels shared with the Buick or Oldsmobile A bodies (Special, Skylark) where supply and demand issues forced a substitution, and during the April 1968 production month in the wake of the assassination of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. there were some work stoppages. A ribbed stainless steel panel was bolted to the rear taillight panel, and a &#x27;Concours By Chevrolet&#x27; emblem on the rear decklid. Other options included power windows and door locks. With the hardtop, a rare option is a horseshoe automatic transmission floor shifter with an integrated console (with bucket seats - sourced from the SS). These Concours options (ZK5, ZK6, and ZK7) should not be confused with the two Concours station wagons. At the time, the ZK5, ZK6, and ZK7 Concours packages had equipment similar to the Caprice. A change for 1968 was dropping the description of &quot;sedan&quot; for the 2-door pillar body style. This was now called a coupe (or pillar coupe), while the two-door hardtop was called a sport coupe. These coupe/sport coupe designations would continue into 1969. The Concours Estate Wagon was one of four distinct Chevelle wagon models. A one-year Nomad trim, called the Nomad Custom, was offered.

Regular Chevelle engines started with a Turbo-Thrift six, the new Turbo-Fire 307 V8, and a version of the 327-cubic-inch V8. Manual transmission cars got GM&#x27;s &quot;Air Injection Reactor (A.I.R)&quot; smog pump. New Federal safety-mandated equipment included side marker lights and shoulder belts for outboard front seat occupants on cars built after December 1, 1967.

For the 1968 Model year, a chain of Manassas Chevrolet dealerships put the V8 into the second gen chevelle, ultimately building 4, though all were converted back to engines. The car was built to commemerate the 1968 Leap Year.

===Design changes: 1969–1972===
The 1969 model year Chevelle was marketed as &quot;America&#x27;s most popular mid-size car.&quot; They had minor changes for 1969, led by revised front-end styling. A single chrome bar connected quad headlights (which became a familiar Chevrolet trademark) with a revised front grille, now cast in ABS plastic, and a slotted bumper held the parking lights. Taillight lenses were larger and more vertical, flowing into the quarter panels. Smaller side marker lighting bezels were phased in (shared with the Camaro and using the lens assembly as the previous year). Front vent windows (hardtop and convertibles only) began to fade away now that Astro Ventilation (first introduced on the 1966 Buick Riviera, which was used a year earlier on the Camaro and Caprice) was sending outside air into several Chevelle models. The Chevelle lineup was reduced to Nomad, 300 Deluxe/Greenbrier, Malibu/Concours, and Concours Estate series, and the base 300 series was history. No longer a series of its own, the SS 396 became a $347.60 option package for any two-door model. That meant not just a convertible, sport coupe, or pickup, but even the pillared coupe and sport coupe in the 300 Deluxe series (except the base 300 Deluxe El Camino pickup). Fewer SS396-optioned 300 Deluxe coupes and sport coupes were built than their Malibu counterparts. The Super Sport option included a 325-horsepower 396-cubic-inch V8 beneath a double-domed hood, a black-out grille displaying an SS emblem, and a black rear panel. More potent editions of the 396 engine also made the options list, developing 350 or . SS396s produced from this point on shared the same VIN prefix with the Malibu sport coupe (136), except for the 300 Deluxe-based SS396s using (134), where the original build sheet or Protect-O-Plate (aluminum tag included with the original sales invoice from Chevrolet dealers) can ID a genuine SS (especially for a numbers matching original which is unaltered); however, the VIN alone cannot ID a genuine SS as in previous years. Around an estimated 323 Chevelle 2-door hardtops were fitted with an L72 rated at at 5,800 rpm and at 4,000 rpm of torque, where some Chevrolet dealers used the Central Office Production Order (this also included some Camaros and Novas of the same model year) - some COPOs were sold through select Chevrolet dealerships and out of the 323 COPO orders, a confirmed 99 were sold through the Yenko Chevrolet dealership in Canonsburg, PA. During the 1969 model year, a police package (RPO B07) was available on the Chevelle 300 Deluxe 4-door sedan where some were optioned with the RPO L35 (396) engine along with a boxed frame (also shared with fleet orders e.g. taxicabs and rental cars); at the time the police option was reintroduced since the 1964/65 model years (at the time midsize squads came with economy powertrain usually in the case of the Chevelle a third-generation Chevrolet inline-six. The 300 Deluxe police cars were not successful in the market dominated by Chrysler, with its B platform (and its full-sized sedans) outselling its competitors. Chevelle station wagons came in three levels: Concours, Nomad, and Greenbrier, the last, was a nameplate formerly used on the Corvair van. A new dual-action tailgate operated either in the traditional manner or as a panel-type door. Wagons stretched overall versus for coupes. Also, the Concours option package (ZK5, ZK6, and ZK7) from the previous year was continued. 
New round instrument pods replaced the former linear layout. Chevelle options included headlight washers, power windows and locks, and a rear defroster. Chevy&#x27;s midsize production rose this year. About seven percent of all Malibus had a six-cylinder engine, while about 86,000 came with the SS 396 option. All 1969 Chevelles had a new locking steering column one year ahead of the Federal requirement, and headrests required for all cars sold in the U.S. after January 1, 1969.

In 1969, Chevrolet developed a steam powered concept vehicle, designated the SE 124 based on a Chevelle fitted with a 50 hp Bresler steam engine in place of its gasoline engine. The Bresler was based on the Doble steam engine.

===1970===
In 1970, sheet metal revisions gave the bodies a more coke bottle styling, and interiors were redesigned. The 1970 Chevelle and the 1970 Buick Skylark share the same roofline. The 1970 Chevelle came in Sport Coupe, Sport Sedan, convertible, four-door sedan, a couple of wagons, and coupé utility (the El Camino) body styles. Only three of these (Malibu sport coupe, Malibu convertible, and El Camino pickup) were available with a choice of one of two SS options; RPO Z25 with the SS 396 () engine and RPO Z15 with the new engine. The base model was now called Chevelle instead of the former base 300 Deluxe, and was only available as a Sport Coupe or four-door sedan. The base series retained its 300 Deluxe name in Canada, with appropriate badging on each front fender just behind the front wheel well. The 300 Deluxe 2-door sedan was canceled and replaced by the base Chevelle Sport Coupe, a 2-door pillarless hardtop. The hardtop, convertible, and sedan received the upgraded sheet metal. However, the station wagons and El Camino retained the previous year&#x27;s sheet metal panels (which went on for the next 2 model years). Station wagons were the entry-level Nomad, the Chevelle-level Greenbrier, the Malibu-level Concours, and an upscale Concours Estate. New options included power door locks and a stalk-mounted wiper control. Production was expanded to the GM Arlington Assembly plant in Arlington, Texas (where the Chevelle was assembled with its corporate siblings, in this case, the Oldsmobile Cutlass).

Engine choices ranged from the standard six-cylinder and a , V8 as well as one of two V8s and a pair of engines. RPO Z25 SS equipment option included one of these 402 cid engines, but was still marketed as a 396. The second 402 cid engine was available under RPO, rated at 330 hp with single exhaust, and was available in any V8 series except an SS optioned Malibu or El Camino. 1970 also saw the introduction of the engine which was only available with the RPO Z15 SS Equipment option. The base engine was rated at , which was also available with cowl induction; and the optional LS6 version equipped with a single 4-barrel 800 CFM Holley carburetor produced at 5600 rpm and at 3600 rpm of torque. There were 4,475 LS6 Chevelles produced.

The SS 396 Chevelle included a Turbo-Jet 396 V8, special suspension, &quot;power dome&quot; hood, black-accented grille, resilient rear-bumper insert, and wide-oval tires on sport wheels. Though a cowl induction version was available, few were sold in favor of the newly introduced 454 engine during late-1969. The LS5 V8 produced in standard form, and a cowl induction version was also available. The LS6 produced a claimed 450 gross HP in a solid-lifter, high-compression version. Neither functional hood lock pins nor hood and deck stripes were standard with either SS option, but were part of the optional ZL2 cowl induction hood option. The LS5 V8 was rated at .

===1971===
The 1971 model year Chevelle retained the 1970 body, with a new front-end and rear-end styling, including large Power-Beam single-unit headlights, a reworked grille and bumper, and integral park/signal/marker lights. The grille was widened and featured a bright horizontal bar divided into two sections. At the center of this bar was a large Chevy bowtie for Malibus, or a large &quot;SS&quot; emblem for the SS models. The grille on the Super Sport was painted flat black, while the other models featured a silver-finish version. Base Chevelles had a thinner, plain bar with no ornamentation. A small &quot;Chevelle&quot; nameplate was located in the lower-left corner of the grille. New dual round taillights were integral with the back bumper. Chevrolet introduced the &quot;Heavy Chevy&quot; (RPO YF3) model at midyear. It was primarily an appearance trim for the base Chevelle (13437) and was available with any V8 engine except the 454. Options were limited to those on the standard Chevelle sport coupe; vinyl floor, front bench seat, no center console shift, etc.

Chevrolet specifications for 1971 included both &quot;gross&quot; and &quot;net&quot; horsepower figures for all engines. The standard Chevelle SS engine was a two-barrel 350-cubic-inch V8 rated at 245 gross (165 net) horsepower. Optional was a four-barrel carbureted version of the 350 V8 rated at 275 gross (200 net with dual exhaust and 175 net with single exhaust) horsepower. The 402 cid big-block engine continued to be optional as the SS 396 but was only available in one horsepower rating, 300 gross (260 net) horsepower, and was not available with cowl induction. The base LS5 454 V8 produced 365 gross and 285 net horsepower, but cowl induction was available, which produced more power because of the air induction and a louder exhaust system. The LS6 454 option, originally announced as a regular production option on the Chevelle SS for 1971, was dropped early in the model year. No official records indicate that any 1971 Chevelles were assembled with the LS6 engine.

For 1971, the SS option could be ordered with any optional V8, becoming more of a dress-up option than a performance option. The SS option was reduced to one RPO code, RPO Z15, and was only available for the Chevelle Malibu. This RPO code required any optional engine and transmission available in the Chevelle lineup. Since the 307 V8 was the standard base V8 in 1971, it could not be ordered with the SS option; one had to order the LS3 402 or the LS5 454, or one of the two 350 V8 engines (L65 or L48 - which reintroduced the small block to the SS option for the first time since the 1965 model year for USA market Chevelles).

GM mandated all divisions to design engines on regular, low-octane, lower-lead, or unleaded gasoline. To permit usage of the lower-octane fuels, all engines featured low compression ratios (9:1 and lower; well below the 10.25-11.25:1 range on high-performance engines of 1970 and earlier). This move reduced horsepower ratings on the big-block engines to 300 for the 402 cubic-inch V8, but the LS5 454 option had an &quot;advertised&quot; five-horsepower increase to 365.

Both 350 V8 engines and the dual exhaust 402 cid V8 engine were available without the SS option; only the LS5 454 V8 required the SS option. A single-exhaust version of the 402 cid engine existed in 1970 with 330 gross hp and in 1972 with 210 net hp. In 1971, the single exhaust version of the 402 cid engine was rated 206 net hp, but it only appeared in the full-size Chevrolet brochure.

===1972===
The 1972 Chevelles featured single-unit parking/side marker lights on their front fenders, outside of a revised twin-bar grille. All Malibus had concealed wipers. The SS equipment option requirements remained the same as those in 1971, any optional V8. The 1972 Chevelle series became America&#x27;s second-best-selling car. Base versions again included a four-model wagon series. Upscale versions were Malibus, including convertibles. More than 24,000 Malibu Sport Sedans were built, with a standard 307-cubic-inch V8 rated at 130 (net) horsepower. This 4-door hardtop used the same body as the 1968-71 models, and although it was attractive, it was the least popular body style in the lineup. It was not available with the overhead-valve &quot;Turbo-Thrift&quot; six-cylinder engine. With that V8, the Malibu Sport Coupe was the top seller, starting at $2,923. The six-cylinder version was $90 less. Powertrain options included the 175-horsepower 350-cubic-inch V8 and 240-horsepower 402-cubic-inch (still known as a 396), as well as a 454 that produced under the net rating system. Chevelles sold in California were unavailable with the 307 V8, but included a 350-cubic-inch engine. Through the 1970s, California cars often had different powertrains than those marketed in states with less stringent emissions regulations.

The 1972 Chevelle SS top engine was rated at 270 net hp (201 kW), conforming with GM&#x27;s decree that all engines would be rated at their net engine ratings. All other engines on the SS roster were unchanged from 1971. 1972 was the last year for the cowl induction option for the 454 cid engine and was not even mentioned in the 1972 Chevelle brochure.

Chevelle wagons measured shorter than full-size wagons and weighed about half a ton less, but sold much slower. Model-year output totaled 49,352 Chevelles and 290,008 Malibus—plus 54,335 station wagons.

===Yenko Chevelles===

Retired Corvair and Corvette race car driver Don Yenko (a Pittsburgh-area Chevrolet dealer) developed his line of signature Chevelles, Camaros and Novas, marketed as Yenko Super Cars. At the time, the largest engine installed in Chevelle SSs was the 396 V8. Yenko used the Central Office Production Order system, which usually filled special-equipment fleet orders, to create a special COPO 9562 that included the L72 with a single, four-barrel 800 CFM Holley carburetor that produced at 5600 rpm and at 4000 rpm of torque unit and the needed drive train upgrades. A few other dealers ordered the Yenko packages to create and sell as theirs: Nickey, Berger, Scuncio, etc.

==Third generation (1973–1977)==
===Overview===

The most extensive redesign in its 10-year history marked the 1973 Chevelle. Due to concern over proposed Federal rollover standards, convertible and 4-door hardtop models were discontinued, while the 2-door hardtop was replaced by a pillared coupe—named &quot;Colonnade Hardtop.&quot; This body style featured a semi-fastback roofline, frameless door glass, and fixed, styled &quot;B&quot; pillars, structurally strong enough to contribute to occupant safety of a roll-over type accident. This move was somewhat controversial with the buying public as hardtops had been a staple of American cars for over 20 years. However, the Colonnade models became a sales success. The Monte Carlo coupe was the biggest seller of the Chevrolet A-body line (actually designated &quot;A-Special&quot;), although the regular coupes, sedans, and station wagons also sold well. Distinctive rear quarter glass on 2-door coupes, and new side windows with styled center pillars were featured on 4-door models. The rear side windows on the coupes were now fixed. In addition to the new roofline, front and rear ends looked markedly different this year as 1973 was the year of the federally mandated front bumper, adding to the car&#x27;s length. Additional new body features were an acoustical double-panel roof, tighter-fitting glass, and flush-style outside door handles. Wheelbase dimensions were retained; a for coupes, and for sedans and station wagons, but bodies were five inches (127 mm) longer and an inch wider with a wider wheel track. The station wagon, available in 6- or 9-passenger seating, featured a new counterbalanced liftgate, allowing for easier entry and loading up to 85 cubic feet.

Plans to release the updated A-body lineup were scheduled for the 1972 model year, but a strike that occurred at some GM assembly plants delayed the release for a complete model year, eventually extending the lifecycle of the 1968-era generation; the redesigned A-bodies were designed in a studio where it had more of a European influence - at the time of development John Z. DeLorean was the chairman at the Chevrolet division where he delayed some product releases, and extending the lifecycle of some of its products; the redesigned A-bodies had some styling cues lifted from the concurrent second-generation F-bodies - the front suspension was integrated into the A-body redesign with output from respective GM divisions (each division had its sheet metal design).

The 1973 model year introduced molded full foam front and rear seat construction, a flow-through power ventilation system, an inside hood release, a larger 22-gallon fuel tank, and &quot;flush and dry&quot; rocker panels introduced first on the redesigned 1971 full-size Chevrolets. Another structural improvement was side-impact guard beams in the doors, as required by new Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. New options included swivel bucket seats with console for coupes and Turbine I steel-backed urethane wheels. A power moonroof was an option in 1973–75. The Interior roominess of the 1973 Chevelle was improved, particularly in the rear. Headroom was up slightly, and shoulder room gains were by . Rear seat legroom was up in sedans. Another was a luggage capacity, an increase of over 1972 models. Still another benefit of the new body designs was greatly improved visibility, up 25% in coupes and wagons, and 35% in sedans. The thin windshield pillars also contributed to much better visibility.

===New chassis===
The chassis design was new, with a sturdier perimeter frame, revised chassis/body mounts, larger 8½ inch rear axle, wider 6-inch wheel rim width, revised rear control arm bushings, increased front and rear suspension travel, adjusted shock absorber location, and revised front suspension geometry. The left wheel was adjusted to have slightly more positive camber than the right, which resulted in a more uniform and stable steering feel on high-crown road surfaces while maintaining freeway stability. Clearances for spring travel were also revised; the coil springs at each wheel were computer-selected to match the individual car&#x27;s weight. Front disc brakes became standard on all 1973 Chevelles. John Z. DeLorean, Chevrolet&#x27;s dynamic general manager during the design phase of the new Chevelles, left just as they were announced. He departed in late September 1972 to start a brief period as vice president of General Motors&#x27;s Car and Truck Group. Critics compared the GM Colonnade line favorably to Ford and Chrysler intermediates.

Five powertrains were available for 1973 Chevelle models; the 250 inline-six and 307 2-barrel V8 both rated at were standard engines on Deluxe and Malibu. The 350 2-barrel V8 of was the base Laguna engine. Options for any Chevelle included a 350 4-barrel V8 of and a 454 4-barrel V8 rated at . Hardened engine valve seats and hydraulic camshafts made these engines reliable and allowed them to accept the increasingly popular unleaded regular gasoline. The 3-speed manual transmission was standard; a 4-speed manual and Turbo Hydra-Matic 3-speed automatic were optional. Crossflow radiators and coolant reservoirs that prevented air from entering the system prevented overheating.

===Revised model lineup===

Malibu and the newly named Deluxe series base model featured the new bumper system with a large chrome front bumper and a chrome rear bumper. Malibu series interiors included cloth and vinyl or all vinyl seat trim and deep-twist carpeting.
Deluxe series interiors featured cloth and vinyl or knit vinyl seat trim. Floor coverings were color-keyed in vinyl-coated rubber.
The SS was now a trim option limited to the mid-level Malibu series. It was possible to order an SS station wagon this year - with the option of a 454-cubic-inch V8 engine, but the mix of sport and utilitarian wagon virtues would last only a single season. Included was a black grill with SS emblem, lower bodyside and wheel opening striping, bright roof drip moldings, color-keyed dual sport mirrors, black taillight bezels, SS fender and rear panel emblems, special front and rear stabilizer bars, 14x7-inch rally wheels, 70-series raised white lettered tires, special instrumentation, and SS interior emblems.
The SS option required an available 350 or 454 V8 with 4-speed or Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission.

Chevrolet honored California beach resorts once again by naming the top Chevelle series Laguna with the Malibu taking the middle spot. In contrast, the base series was called Deluxe. In addition to the standard 350 2 barrel V8, Laguna models featured specific front and rear styling that included a body-colored urethane front end concealing the new 5 mph bumper system. On minor impact, the urethane nose cone, backed up by shock-absorbing cylinders, deflects and rebounds. Laguna models also featured a specific diecast chrome grille with bowtie emblem, a body-colored (steel) rear bumper, front and rear bumper rub strips, bright roof drip moldings, bright wheel opening moldings, chrome taillight bezels, full wheel covers, and Laguna fender nameplates. Two Laguna station wagons were introduced, including a Laguna Estate with wood grain trim. Laguna interiors were pattern cloth and vinyl or optional breathable all-vinyl upholstery, distinctive door trim with map pockets, deep-twist carpeting, woodgrain vinyl accents, and Laguna nameplates.

Chevelle sales remained strong: 327,631 in the 1973 model year, plus 59,108 station wagons. The more upmarket Malibu continued to be best sellers, and many Chevelles went to fleets. The Laguna coupe and sedan had 56,036 sales. Super Sport options were on 28,647 Chevelles, of which 2,500 had the 454-cubic-inch engine. The SS option was dropped at the end of the model year.

===1974===


The 1974 model featured new chrome grilles made of die-cast steel, and single rectangular tail lights replaced the dual round items on all coupes and sedans. More massive rear bumpers were also added, following stricter US Federal standards for 1974 cars.

The Laguna, Chevelle&#x27;s top-of-the-line model in 1973, became the Laguna Type S-3 and was only available as a coupe. It combined Laguna luxury with the upgraded handling of the SS, which it replaced. It also included GR70-15 radial tires. The new Laguna S-3 featured the urethane front end with a revised grille as well as new front lamps and taillights. The rear bumper on the Laguna S-3 was chrome-plated rather than painted body color as on the 1973 car. Standard equipment included a console, a vinyl roof, opera-type vertical rear quarter windows which could be covered with optional horizontal ribs; bodyside striping, Laguna S-3 badging, rally wheels, a 4-spoke steering wheel, firmer springs and shock absorbers, a front anti-roll bar, and HR70x15 radial tires on rally wheels. Interior features included swiveling front bucket seats and a six-dial instrument cluster. Production totaled 15,792 cars. The standard engine was producing with a 2-barrel carburetor, with options for a 2-barrel or 4-barrel V8, and a V8, except in California where a 350 four-barrel V8 was standard. The 400 and 454 engines were optional. The 454 was available with GM&#x27;s THM-400 automatic or Muncie 4-speed manual transmission. Unitized 3-point seat belts were introduced on all Chevrolet models.
The upscale luxury trim level for 1974 was the new Malibu Classic, offered in sedan, coupe, and station wagon models. Unlike the 1973 Laguna, the Malibu Classic used the same front end and chrome bumper as the lesser models and had smaller vertical opera windows and a spring-loaded hood ornament. Early-production 1974 Classic coupes required the vinyl roof option; apparently inserts were used to cover part of the big rear quarter window. Later-built cars were available with a standard painted roof that included the smaller opera window. This configuration was continued through the end of Chevelle production in 1977. Inside, the Malibu Classic interiors had notchback bench seats upholstered in cloth or vinyl, carpeted door panels, and simulated woodgrain instrument panel trim. Optional on Malibu Classic coupes were swiveling bucket seats in cloth or vinyl. The base Deluxe series was dropped for 1974, making the Malibu the base model. Base engines were the straight-six engine and the 350 V8.

===1975===

For 1975, Front and rear changes included a vertical grid-patterned grille and new bright trim around the headlights. Rectangular taillights were flush with the body surface, connected by a brushed chrome panel. Malibu Classic coupes had distinctive opera windows. Landau coupes came with a vinyl roof, full-wheel covers, whitewall tires, color-keyed body striping, and dual sport mirrors. Engines ranged from the standard 250 six and 350/2-barrel V8 to options of 400 and 454-cubic-inch size, the last with a 235-horsepower rating. Variable-ratio power steering was now standard with V8 models, and all 1975 models came with steel-belted radial tires and a catalytic converter. A new &quot;Chevrolet Efficiency System&quot; included GM&#x27;s new High energy ignition (HEI) for longer tune-up intervals and more complete combustion. The speedometer dial now indicated miles and kilometers per hour.

The Laguna Type S-3 was delayed until January 1975. It now had a slanted, urethane-covered aero-style nose designed for NASCAR, louvered quarter windows, and could be ordered with a vinyl half-roof. The 454 engine option was available for the first half of the model year, after which the 400 engine became the top engine. Options included an Econominder gauge package.

===1976===
The 1976 Malibu Classic received a crosshatch grille flanked by two stacked rectangular sealed-beam headlamps, while lesser models had a waterfall grille and continued with the previous single round lamps. Three V8 engines were available: a new engine rated at , a engine providing , and a engine with . An &quot;Econominder&quot; gauge package was optional. The 1976 Laguna Type S-3 was little changed in its third and final year. It again featured quarter window louvers and a sloped, body-color urethane front end. Lagunas shared their round-gauge instrument panel with the Chevrolet Monte Carlo, which could be ordered with a four-spoke sport steering wheel, swivel front bucket seats, and a center console. Lesser models had a dashboard and a linear readout speedometer. Production of the Laguna edged up to 9,100 cars.

===1977===
The 1977 Chevelles featured new grilles. The lineup consisted of Malibu and Malibu Classic models in coupe, sedan, and station wagon body styles. Estate Wagons and the Laguna Type S-3 were discontinued. Malibu Classics, again the top model, switched to a vertical grille pattern and six-section taillights but retained twin stacked headlights and stand-up hood ornament. Malibu grilles changed little. Fewer engine selections were available, but the continuing engines were now rated with slightly higher output. In standard form, Chevelles had a six-cylinder engine or a , 305 V8. The sole option beyond that was a , four-barrel 350 V8, which came as standard equipment in the Malibu Classic station wagon. Malibu Classics had a luxurious cloth/vinyl split-bench front seat, color-keyed steering wheel, and woodgrain-accented instrument panel. Malibu options included an Exterior Decor group, tinted glass, and full wheel covers. A total of 37,215 Malibu Classic Landau coupes were produced, compared to 73,739 Malibu Classic coupes and 28,793 Malibu coupes. In four-door sedan form, too, the Malibu Classics outsold base models by a substantial margin.

A Chevelle SE (special edition) was available and provided front and rear spoilers, turbine II wheels, F60-15 tires, special graphics and decals, quarter window trim, front and rear sway bars, sport suspension, and a deluxe interior. Three colors were available. Fifty of these cars were built.

The 1977 models were the last to bear the Chevelle name; with the all-new 1978 models, Malibu became the basic name for Chevrolet&#x27;s midsize cars. In Mexico, the base version of the new-for-1978 Malibu used the Chevelle name through 1981.

===Reviews===
&quot;Speed and Supercar&quot; magazine said in a June 1974 &quot;Street Test&quot;: &quot;Chevy gets it right on.&quot; &quot;Enough is plenty, that&#x27;s how we feel about the 350 Laguna. &quot;... We couldn&#x27;t pass up the opportunity to tell you what a groovy all around car it is even if it can&#x27;t smoke the quarter-mile in 13 seconds. And what car in &#x27;73 can.&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s not overpowering but it&#x27;s enough - and so comfortable that the editor bought the car.&quot; &quot;The Laguna is the type of car you want to own for fast, comfortable transportation in quiet luxury.&quot;



==NASCAR==
The third-generation Chevelle was an extensively used body style in NASCAR competition from 1973 through 1977. The Chevelle Laguna in particular was successful, enabling Cale Yarborough to win 34 races and earn the first two of three consecutive Grand National championships. Considered a limited edition model by NASCAR, the Laguna S-3 was ineligible for competition following the 1977 season.

October 21, 1973: American 500-Benny Parsons pits for repairs after an early crash. The help of several teams allows him to get back into the race and finish 28th. Parsons and his Chevelle hold on to win the NASCAR Winston Cup Grand National championship. Parsons took the points lead with a third-place finish at Talladega Speedway in early May and never gave up the lead. He held off a late rally by Cale Yarborough to win by only 67.15 points.

August 1976: Cale Yarborough drove his #11 Junior Johnson/Holly Farms Chevelle to the 1976 NASCAR Winston Cup Grand National championship. Yarborough won nine races to the first of three consecutive titles. He finished last in the Daytona 500, but assumed command of the points chase in August. Yarborough beat Richard Petty by 195 points.

February 20, 1977: Daytona 500-Cale Yarborough Chevelle pulls away from Benny Parsons Chevelle in the final laps to win in his second Daytona 500. Cale Yarborough was running at the finish in all 30 NASCAR Winston Cup races as he dominated the 1977 season to wrap up his second consecutive title. Yarborough won nine races in 30 starts in his #11 Chevelle and finished 386 points ahead of runner-up Richard Petty.

<text>Railroad classes are the system by which freight railroads are designated in the United States. Railroads are assigned to Class I, II or III according to annual revenue criteria originally set by the Surface Transportation Board in 1992. With annual adjustments for inflation, the 2019 thresholds were US$504,803,294 for Class I carriers and US$40,384,263 for Class II carriers. (Smaller carriers were Class III by default.)

There are six Class I freight railroad companies in the United States: BNSF Railway, CSX Transportation, Canadian National Railway, CPKC, Norfolk Southern Railway, and Union Pacific Railroad. Canadian National also operates in Canada and CPKC operates in Canada and Mexico.

In addition, the national passenger railroad in the United States, Amtrak, would qualify as Class I if it were a freight carrier, as would Canada&#x27;s Via Rail passenger service. Mexico&#x27;s Ferromex freight railroad would also qualify as Class I, but it does not operate within the United States.

==Background==
Initially (in 1911) the former federal agency Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) classified railroads by their annual gross revenue. Class I railroads had an annual operating revenue of at least $1 million, while Class III railroad incomes were under $100,000. Railroads in both classes were subject to reporting requirements on a quarterly or annual schedule. In 1925, the ICC reported 174 Class I railroads, 282 Class II railroads, and 348 Class III railroads.

The $1 million criterion established in 1911 for a Class I railroad was used until January 1, 1956, when the figure was increased to $3 million. In 1956, the ICC counted 113 Class I line-haul operating railroads (excluding &quot;3 class I companies in systems&quot;) and 309 Class II railroads (excluding &quot;3 class II companies in systems&quot;). The Class III category was dropped in 1956 but reinstated in 1978. By 1963, the number of Class I railroads had dropped to 102; cutoffs were increased to $5 million by 1965, to $10 million in 1976 and to $50 million in 1978, at which point only 41 railroads qualified as Class I.

In a special move in 1979, all switching and terminal railroads were re-designated Class III — even those with Class I or Class II revenues.

In early 1991, two Class II railroads, Montana Rail Link and Wisconsin Central, asked the ICC to increase the minimum annual operating revenue criteria (then established at US$93.5 million) to avoid being redesignated as Class I, which would have resulted in increased administrative and legal costs. The Class II maximum criterion was increased in 1992 to $250 million annually, which resulted in the Florida East Coast Railway having its status changed to Class II.

The thresholds set in 1992 were:
*Class I: A carrier earning revenue greater than $250 million
*Class II: A carrier earning revenue between $20 million and $250 million
*Class III: A carrier earning revenue less than $20 million

Since dissolution of the ICC in 1996, the Surface Transportation Board (STB) has become responsible for defining criteria for each railroad class. The STB continues to use designations of Class II and Class III as there are different labor regulations for the two classes. The bounds are typically redefined every several years to adjust for inflation and other factors.

Class II and Class III designations are now rarely used outside the rail transport industry. The Association of American Railroads typically divides non–Class I companies into three categories:
*Regional railroads: operate at least or have revenue of at least $40 million per year.
*Local railroads: smaller than a regional railroad, but engage in line-haul service.
*Switching and terminal railroads: mainly switch cars between other railroads and/or provide service in a common terminal.

==Classes== 
In the United States, the Surface Transportation Board categorizes rail carriers into Class I, Class II, and Class III based on the carrier&#x27;s annual revenue. The thresholds, last adjusted for inflation in 2023, are:
*Class I: A carrier earning revenue greater than $1,053,709,560
*Class II: A carrier earning revenue between $47,299,851 and $1,053,709,560
*Class III: A carrier earning revenue less than $47,299,851
In Canada, a Class I rail carrier is defined () as a company that has earned gross revenues exceeding $250 million (CAD) for each of the previous two years.

=== Class I ===
Class I railroads are the largest rail carriers in the United States. In 1900, there were 132 Class I railroads, but as the result of mergers and bankruptcies, the industry has consolidated and , just six Class I freight railroads remain.

BNSF Railway and Union Pacific Railroad have a duopoly over all transcontinental freight rail lines in the Western United States, while CSX Transportation and Norfolk Southern Railway operate most of the trackage in the Eastern United States, with the Mississippi River being the rough dividing line. Canadian National Railway (via its subsidiary Grand Trunk Corporation) operates north–south lines near the Mississippi River. Canadian Pacific Kansas City, doing business as CPKC, runs from southern Canada, then goes south through the central United States to central Mexico.

In addition, the national passenger railroads in the US and Canada—Amtrak and Via Rail—would both qualify as Class I if they were freight carriers. Mexico&#x27;s Ferromex would qualify as a Class I railroad if it had trackage in the United States.


=== Class II ===
A Class II railroad in the United States hauls freight and is mid-sized in terms of operating revenue. Switching and terminal railroads are excluded from Class II status. Railroads considered by the Association of American Railroads as &quot;Regional Railroads&quot; are typically Class II. The Florida East Coast Railway, the Iowa Interstate Railroad, and the Alabama and Gulf Coast Railway are some examples of Class II railroads.

===Class III===

Class III railroads are typically local shortline railroads serving a small number of towns and industries or hauling cars for one or more railroads; often, they once had been branch lines of larger railroads or even abandoned portions of main lines. Some Class III railroads are owned by railroad holding companies such as Genesee &amp; Wyoming or Watco. The Maryland and Delaware Railroad, the San Pedro Valley Railroad, and the Buckingham Branch Railroad are some examples of Class III railroads.

<text>Kochab , Bayer designation Beta Ursae Minoris (β Ursae Minoris, abbreviated β UMi, Beta UMi), is the brightest star in the bowl of the Little Dipper asterism (which is part of the constellation of Ursa Minor), and only slightly fainter than Polaris, the northern pole star and brightest star in Ursa Minor. Kochab is 16 degrees from Polaris and has an apparent visual magnitude of 2.08. The distance to this star from the Sun can be deduced from the parallax measurements made during the Hipparcos mission, yielding a value of .

Amateur astronomers can use Kochab as a precise guide for equatorial mount alignment: The celestial north pole is located 38 arcminutes away from Polaris, very close to the line connecting Polaris with Kochab.

== Nomenclature ==
&quot;β Ursae Minoris&quot; (Latinised to &quot;Beta Ursae Minoris&quot;) is the star&#x27;s Bayer designation.

It bore the traditional name &quot;Kochab&quot;, which appeared in the Renaissance and has an uncertain meaning. It may be from or , both of which are broadly used to describe a celestial body and can be translated as &#x27;planet&#x27; or &#x27;star&#x27;. (The Hebrew term was also applied to the planet Mercury, especially due to its lack of distinguishing features in comparison to other visible planets.) However, it is more likely derived from or , a name applied to Theta Ursae Majoris. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (IAU-WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The IAU-WGSN&#x27;s first bulletin, July 2016, included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the IAU-WGSN, which included &quot;Kochab&quot; for this star.

In Chinese astronomy, (&#x27;North Pole&#x27;) refers to an asterism consisting of Beta Ursae Minoris, Gamma Ursae Minoris, 5 Ursae Minoris, 4 Ursae Minoris and Σ 1694. Consequently, the Chinese name for Beta Ursae Minoris itself is (&#x27;the Second Star of North Pole&#x27;), representing (&#x27;emperor&#x27;).

== Properties ==
This is a red giant star with a stellar classification of K4 III. Kochab has reached a state in its evolution where the outer envelope has expanded to 44 times the radius of the Sun. This enlarged atmosphere is radiating 540 times as much light from its outer atmosphere as the Sun, but through a surface more than 1,470 times larger than the Sun&#x27;s surface area, hence at a lower effective temperature of 4,126 K. (The Sun&#x27;s effective temperature is 5,772 K.) This relatively low heat gives the star the typical orange-hued glow of a K-type star. It is not known for certain if Kochab is on the red giant branch, fusing hydrogen into helium in a shell surrounding an inert helium core, or on the horizontal branch fusing helium into carbon.

By modelling this star based upon evolutionary tracks, the mass of this star can be estimated as . A mass estimate using the interferometrically-measured radius of this star and its spectroscopically-determined surface gravity yields 2.5 ± 0.9 . The star is known to undergo periodic variations in luminosity over roughly 4.6 days, with the astroseismic frequencies depending sensitively on the star&#x27;s mass. From this, a much lower mass estimate of 1.3 ± 0.3  is reached.

==As the pole star==
From around 2500 BCE, as Thuban became less and less aligned with the north celestial pole, Kochab became one &quot;pillar&quot; of the circumpolar stars, first with Mizar, a star in the middle of the handle of the Big Dipper (Ursa Major), and later with Pherkad (in Ursa Minor). In fact, around the year 2467 BCE, the true north was best determined by drawing a plumb line between Mizar and Kochab, a fact with which the Ancient Egyptians were well acquainted, as they aligned the great Pyramid of Giza with it. This cycle of the succession of pole stars occurs due to the precession of the equinoxes. Kochab and Mizar were referred to by Ancient Egyptian astronomers as &#x27;The Indestructibles&#x27; lighting the North. As precession continued, by the year 1100 BCE, Kochab was within roughly 7° of the north celestial pole, with old references over-emphasizing this near pass by referring to Beta Ursae Minoris as &quot;Polaris&quot;, relating it to the current pole star, Polaris, which is slightly brighter and will have a much closer alignment of less than 0.5° by 2100 CE.

This change in the identity of the pole stars is a result of Earth&#x27;s axial precession. After 2000 BCE, Kochab and a new star, its neighbor Pherkad, were closer to the pole and together served as twin pole stars, circling the North Pole from around 1700 BCE until just after 300 CE. Neither star was as close to the north celestial pole as Polaris is now. Today, they are sometimes referred to as the &quot;Guardians of the Pole&quot;. 

==Planetary system==
Estimated to be around 2.95 billion years old, give or take 1 billion years, Kochab was announced to have a planetary companion around 6.1 times as massive as Jupiter with an orbit of 522 days.

<doc id="345675" wikidata="Q1652250" url="?curid=345675" title="Envelope detector">
<text>An envelope detector (sometimes called a peak detector) is an electronic circuit that takes a (relatively) high-frequency signal as input and outputs the &quot;envelope&quot; of the original signal.

== Diode detector ==
A simple form of envelope detector used in detectors for early radios is the diode detector. Its output approximates a voltage-shifted version of the input&#x27;s upper envelope.

Between the circuit&#x27;s input and output is a diode that performs half-wave rectification, allowing substantial current flow only when the input voltage is around a diode drop higher than the output terminal.

The output is connected to a capacitor of value formula_1 and resistor of value formula_2 in parallel to ground. The capacitor is charged as the input voltage approaches its positive peaks. At other times, the capacitor is gradually discharged through the resistor. The resistor and capacitor form a 1st-order low pass filter, which attenuates higher frequencies at a rate of -6 dB per octave above its cutoff frequency of formula_3. The filter&#x27;s RC time constant formula_4 must be small enough to track quickly-falling envelope slopes and &quot;top up&quot; the envelope&#x27;s voltage every peak to prevent &quot;negative peak clipping&quot;.

=== AM demodulation ===
Envelope detectors can be used to demodulate an amplitude modulated (AM) signal. Such a device is often used to demodulate AM radio signals because the envelope of the modulated signal is equivalent to the baseband signal. To sufficiently attenuate the frequency of the carrier wave frequency formula_5, the cutoff frequency of the low-pass filter should be well-below the carrier wave&#x27;s frequency. To avoid negative peak clipping, the original signal that is modulated is usually limited to a maximum frequency formula_6 to limit the maximum rate of fall of the AM signal. To minimize distortions from both ripple and negative peak clipping, the following inequality should be observed:

formula_7

Next, to filter out the DC component, the output could pass through a simple high-pass filter, such as a DC-blocking capacitor.

== General considerations ==
Most practical envelope detectors use either half-wave or full-wave rectification of the signal to convert the AC audio input into a pulsed DC signal. Full-wave rectification traces both positive and negative peaks of the envelope. Half-wave rectification ignores negative peaks, which may be acceptable based on the application, particularly if the input signal is symmetric about the horizontal axis. Low threshold voltage diodes (e.g. germanium or Schottky diodes) may be preferable for tracking very small envelopes.

The filtering for smoothing the final result is rarely perfect and some &quot;ripple&quot; is likely to remain on the output, particularly for low frequency inputs such from a bass instrument. Reducing the filter cutoff frequency gives a smoother output, but designers must compromise this with the circuit&#x27;s high frequency response.

== Definition of the envelope ==

Any AM or FM signal formula_8 can be written in the following form
: formula_9

In the case of AM, φ(&quot;t&quot;) (the phase component of the signal) is constant and can be ignored. In AM, the carrier frequency formula_10 is also constant. Thus, all the information in the AM signal is in &quot;R&quot;(&quot;t&quot;). &quot;R&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is called the &quot;envelope&quot; of the signal. Hence an AM signal is given by the function
: formula_11
with &quot;m&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) representing the original audio frequency message, &quot;C&quot; the carrier amplitude and &quot;R&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) equal to &quot;C&quot; + &quot;m&quot;(&quot;t&quot;). So, if the envelope of the AM signal can be extracted, the original message can be recovered.

In the case of FM, the transmitted formula_8 has a constant envelope &quot;R&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) = R and can be ignored. However, many FM receivers measure the envelope anyway for received signal strength indication.

== Precision detector ==
An envelope detector can also be constructed using a precision rectifier feeding into a low-pass filter.

== Drawbacks ==
The envelope detector has several drawbacks:
* The input to the detector must be band-pass filtered around the desired signal, or else the detector will simultaneously demodulate several signals. The filtering can be done with a tunable filter or, more practically, a superheterodyne receiver
* It is more susceptible to noise than a product detector
* If the signal is overmodulated (i.e. modulation index &gt; 1), distortion will occur
Most of these drawbacks are relatively minor and are usually acceptable tradeoffs for the simplicity and low cost of using an envelope detector.

== Audio ==

An envelope detector is sometimes referred to as an envelope follower in musical environments. It is still used to detect the amplitude variations of an incoming signal to produce a control signal that resembles those variations. However, in this case the input signal is made up of audible frequencies.

Envelope detectors are often a component of other circuits, such as a compressor or an auto-wah or envelope-followed filter. In these circuits, the envelope follower is part of what is known as the &quot;side chain&quot;, a circuit which describes some characteristic of the input, in this case its volume.

Both expanders and compressors use the envelope&#x27;s output voltage to control the gain of an amplifier. Auto-wah uses the voltage to control the cutoff frequency of a filter. The voltage-controlled filter of an analog synthesizer is a similar circuit.

Modern envelope followers can be implemented: 
# directly as electronic hardware,
# or as software using either a digital signal processor (DSP) or
# on a general-purpose CPU.

<doc id="345676" wikidata="Q4781151" url="?curid=345676" title="Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp.">
<text>Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corporation, 35 F.3d 1435 (9th Cir. 1994), was a copyright infringement lawsuit in which Apple Computer, Inc. (now Apple Inc.) sought to prevent Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard from using visual graphical user interface (GUI) elements that were similar to those in Apple&#x27;s Lisa and Macintosh operating systems. The court ruled that, &quot;Apple cannot get patent-like protection for the idea of a graphical user interface, or the idea of a desktop metaphor [under copyright law]...&quot;. In the midst of the &quot;Apple v. Microsoft&quot; lawsuit, Xerox also sued Apple alleging that Mac&#x27;s GUI was heavily based on Xerox&#x27;s. The district court dismissed Xerox&#x27;s claims without addressing whether Apple&#x27;s GUI infringed Xerox&#x27;s. Apple lost all claims in the &quot;Microsoft&quot; suit except for the ruling that the trash can icon and folder icons from Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s NewWave windows application were infringing. The lawsuit was filed in 1988 and lasted four years; the decision was affirmed on appeal in 1994, and Apple&#x27;s appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court was denied.

==Background==
Apple Inc. had agreed to license certain parts of its GUI to Microsoft for use in Windows 1.0, but when Microsoft made changes in Windows 2.0 adding overlapping windows and other features found in the Macintosh GUI, Apple filed suit. Apple added additional claims to the suit when Microsoft released Windows 3.0.

Apple claimed the &quot;look and feel&quot; of the Macintosh operating system, taken as a whole, was protected by copyright, and that each element of the interface (such as the existence of windows on the screen, the rectangular appearance of windows, windows could be resized, overlap, and have title bars) was not as important as all these elements taken together. After oral arguments, the court insisted on an analysis of specific GUI elements that Apple claimed were infringements. Apple listed 189 GUI elements; the court decided that 179 of these elements had been licensed to Microsoft in the Windows 1.0 agreement and most of the remaining 10 elements were not copyrightable —either they were unoriginal to Apple, or they were the only possible way of expressing a particular idea.

Midway through the suit, Xerox filed a lawsuit against Apple claiming Apple had infringed copyrights Xerox held on its GUI&#x27;s. Xerox had invited the Macintosh design team to view their GUI computers at the PARC research lab; these visits had been very influential on the development of the Macintosh GUI. Xerox&#x27;s lawsuit appeared to be a defensive move to ensure that if &quot;Apple v. Microsoft&quot; established that &quot;look and feel&quot; was copyrightable, then Xerox would be the primary beneficiary, rather than Apple. The Xerox case was dismissed, for a variety of legal reasons, most notably that Xerox &quot;had waited too long to file a copyright infringement case and had to resort to a weaker charge of unfair competition&quot;.

==Court case==
The district court ruled that it would require a standard of &quot;virtual identity&quot; between Windows and the Macintosh at trial for Apple to prove copyright infringement. Apple believed the standard to be too narrow and believed also that a more broad &quot;look and feel&quot; was all that should be necessary at trial. As a result, both parties agreed that a jury trial was unnecessary given the rulings, and Apple filed an appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to have the district court&#x27;s characterization overruled.

After the district court ruled in favor of Microsoft, Apple appealed the decision arguing that the district court only considered infringements on the individual elements of Apple&#x27;s GUI, rather than the interface as a whole. The appeals court almost entirely affirmed the ruling of the district court, establishing that, &quot;almost all the similarities spring either from the license or from basic ideas and their obvious expression... illicit copying could occur only if the works as a whole are virtually identical.&quot; However, the circuit court did reverse the district court&#x27;s decision not to award attorney&#x27;s fees to Microsoft, clarifying and sending the case back to the district court to resolve the issue.

Citing &quot;Brown Bag Software v. Symantec Corp.&quot;, the circuit court dissected the GUI to separate expression from ideas (as expression, but not ideas, are covered by copyright law). The court outlined five ideas that it identified as basic to a GUI desktop: windows, icon images of office items, manipulations of icons, menus, and the opening and closing of objects. The court established that Apple could not make copyright claims based on these ideas and could only make claims on the precise expression of them.

The court also pointed out that many of Apple&#x27;s claims fail on an originality basis. Apple admittedly licensed many of its representations from Xerox, and copyright protection only extends to the original expression. Apple returned to its &quot;complete look and feel&quot; argument, stating that while the individual components were not original, the complete GUI was. The court rejected these arguments because the parts were not original.

==Impact==
Much of the court&#x27;s ruling was based on the original licensing agreement between Apple and Microsoft for Windows 1.0, and this fact made the case more of a contractual matter than of copyright law, to the chagrin of Apple. This also meant that the court avoided a more far-reaching &quot;look and feel copyright&quot; precedent ruling. However, the case did establish that the analytic dissection (rather than the general &quot;look and feel&quot;) of a user interface is vital to any copyright decision on such matters.

In 1997, three years after the lawsuit was decided, all lingering infringement questions against Microsoft regarding the Lisa and Macintosh GUI as well as Apple&#x27;s &quot;QuickTime piracy&quot; lawsuit against Microsoft were settled in direct negotiations.
Apple agreed to make Internet Explorer its default browser, to the detriment of Netscape.
Microsoft agreed to continue developing Microsoft Office and other software for the Mac over the next five years. Microsoft also purchased $150 million of nonvoting Apple stock. Both parties entered into a patent cross-licensing agreement.

He also starred in &quot;Billions&quot; as Todd Krakow, Secretary of the Treasury. Strong was set to appear in &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot; as Dean Martin. However, his scenes were cut from the film.

===Writing===
At 25, in the hopes of being the lead actor in his own film, Strong wrote a dark comedy about two men who kill an elderly man for his rent-controlled apartment. The film never materialized, but it sparked his desire to become a full-time writer. His first successful script was &quot;Recount&quot;, a film about the 2000 US Elections, produced by HBO and directed by Jay Roach. The film starred Kevin Spacey, Laura Dern, Denis Leary, John Hurt and Tom Wilkinson and premiered on May 25, 2008. The script had been voted number one on the 2007 Hollywood Black List, a list of the &quot;most liked&quot; but unproduced scripts as voted on by the Hollywood community and insiders. Strong was nominated for a 2008 Emmy Award for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Miniseries, Movie or a Dramatic Special for &quot;Recount&quot;. The film was nominated for Best Television Miniseries or Film at the 66th Golden Globe Awards and won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Made for Television Movie as well as the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Original Screenplay for a Television movie.

Strong followed up &quot;Recount&quot; with the 2012 film adaptation of &quot;Game Change,&quot; based on the book written by John Heilemann and Mark Halperin. The film starred Julianne Moore and aired on HBO on March 10, 2012. In 2012, he won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Miniseries, Movie or a Dramatic Special for &quot;Game Change&quot;. The film was also awarded a Peabody Award, which recognizes distinguished and meritorious public service by radio and television stations, networks, producing organizations and individuals.

In February 2012, he was hired to write the screenplay for the film adaptation of Dan Brown&#x27;s &quot;The Lost Symbol&quot;, whose production has been stalled since 2013.

Strong wrote the screenplay for the film &quot;The Butler&quot;. Oprah Winfrey and Forest Whitaker starred in the film and it was directed by Lee Daniels. The script was voted onto the 2010 Hollywood Black List. It was released in August 2013 and grossed over $100 million in the US box office. He also had a cameo in the film.

In December 2013, Strong signed on to pen the new screenplay for the film adaptation of the musical &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;, which originally premiered on Broadway in 1950.

Strong also co-created the TV series &quot;Empire&quot; with Daniels in 2014, for which he has written and directed multiple episodes.

Strong co-wrote the two-part &quot;Mockingjay&quot;, the finale of &quot;The Hunger Games&quot; series. &quot;Part 1&quot; was released on November 21, 2014, and &quot;Part 2&quot; was released on November 20, 2015.

In October 2021, Strong released &quot;Dopesick&quot;, a Hulu exclusive miniseries exploring the Sackler family and Purdue Pharma&#x27;s role in America&#x27;s opioid crisis. The series was influenced by Beth Macy&#x27;s book by the same name and starred Michael Keaton, who earned a SAG award for his performance. The critically acclaimed show was nominated for 14 Emmy Awards and won the Peabody Award along with many other awards and honors.

===Directing===
Strong made his directorial debut with the biographical film on the life of author J. D. Salinger, &quot;Rebel in the Rye&quot;. The film premiered at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival and was distributed by IFC Films. He followed this up by directing the last two episodes of the award winning limited series &quot;Dopesick&quot; for he which he was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award and a Directors Guild Award for Best Director of a Limited Series. He has also directed several episodes of &quot;Empire&quot;.

==Personal life==
Strong became engaged to actress Caitlin Mehner on December 29, 2016, in Hawaii after meeting her three years earlier.

<doc id="345687" wikidata="Q13265" url="?curid=345687" title="Gamma Cephei">
<text>Gamma Cephei (γ Cephei, abbreviated Gamma Cep, γ Cep) is a binary star system approximately 45 light-years away in the northern constellation of Cepheus. The primary (designated Gamma Cephei A, officially named Errai , the traditional name of the system) is a stellar class K1 orange giant or subgiant star; it has a red dwarf companion (Gamma Cephei B). An exoplanet (designated Gamma Cephei Ab, later named Tadmor) has been confirmed to be orbiting the primary.

Gamma Cephei is the naked-eye star that will succeed Polaris as the Earth&#x27;s northern pole star, due to axial precession. It will be closer to the northern celestial pole than Polaris around 3200 CE and will make its closest approach around 4300 CE. The &#x27;title&#x27; will pass to Iota Cephei some time around 5200 CE.

==Description==
Gamma Cephei has an apparent magnitude of 3.21, nearly all of which is accounted for by the primary component, Gamma Cephei A. It is a binary star system with an orbital period of 66.8 years and an eccentricity (ovalness) of 0.14. The pair are orbiting at a separation of .

The primary is about 5.7 billion years old and has evolved off the main sequence, having fused all of the hydrogen in its core. It has 1.3 times the mass of the Sun and has expanded to 4.7 times the Sun&#x27;s radius. The star is radiating nearly 12 times the luminosity of the Sun from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 4,806 K. The secondary component, Gamma Cephei B, has a mass approximately 0.40 times that of the Sun. It is probably a red dwarf of class M4, 6.2 magnitudes fainter than the primary. It is assumed to be of similar age to its primary. 

The spectrum of this star has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified. It was listed as a standard star for the spectral class K1 IV in 1943, 1953 and 1973. However, in 1989, it was given as a spectral standard for K1 III-IV. Its spectrum is notable for the strength of the cyano radical (CN) bands. Analysis of the spectrum in 2018 gave a best match for a spectral type of K1 III.

γ Cephei is catalogued as a suspected variable star with a brightness range between magnitudes 3.18 and 3.24, based on its inclusion in an 1884 list of suspected variable stars.

==Nomenclature==
&quot;γ Cephei&quot; (Latinised to &quot;Gamma Cephei&quot;) is the system&#x27;s Bayer designation. Under the rules for naming objects in multiple star systems the two components are designated A and B. Following its discovery the planet was designated Gamma Cephei Ab.

The system bore a traditional name variously spelled as &quot;Errai&quot;, &quot;Er Rai&quot; or &quot;Alrai&quot;, deriving from the Arabic الراعي (ar-rā‘ī), meaning &#x27;the shepherd&#x27;. (The star Beta Ophiuchi is sometimes also called Alrai, but it is more commonly known as &quot;Cebalrai&quot; or &quot;Kelb Alrai&quot;, meaning &#x27;shepherd&#x27;s dog&#x27;.) In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN&#x27;s first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included &quot;Errai&quot; for Gamma Cephei A.

In July 2014 the International Astronomical Union launched NameExoWorlds, a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets. The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names. In December 2015, the IAU announced the winning name was Tadmor for this planet. It was submitted by the Syrian Astronomical Association and is the ancient Semitic name and modern Arabic name for the city of Palmyra, a World Heritage Site.

In Chinese, the star is named (Shàowèi Zēng Bā, literally, the 8th added star of the &quot;Xingguan Shaowei&quot;, &quot;Shaowei&quot;: the Minor Guard) belonging to the Left Wall of the Purple Forbidden enclosure (, ), which refers to an asterism consisting of Gamma Cephei, Iota Draconis, Theta Draconis, Eta Draconis, Zeta Draconis, Upsilon Draconis, 73 Draconis and 23 Cassiopeiae.

==Planetary system==
A planet orbiting Gamma Cephei A with a 2.7-year period was discovered in 1988. Its existence was also announced in 1989. This was the first-discovered extrasolar planet and its ostensible discovery was based on the same radial velocity technique later used successfully by others. However, the claim was challenged in 1992 by a paper which favoured K-giant variability with a period equal to the stellar rotation, but in 2002, the existence of a planet with an orbital period of about 2.5 years was confirmed.

Astrometric measurements have shown that the planet&#x27;s orbital inclination is between 3.7° and 15.5°, meaning that its true mass is between 6.6 and 28.1 .

The secondary star B orbits A at only 9.8 times the semimajor axis of A&#x27;s planet. The orbit of the planet is roughly perpendicular to the orbit of the binary. Dynamical modelling suggests that the Kozai–Lidov mechanism is at play here.

<text>The Kansas City Southern Railway Company was an American Class I railroad. Founded in 1887, it operated in 10 Midwestern and Southeastern U.S. states: Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas. KCS owned the shortest north-south rail route between Kansas City, Missouri, and several key ports along the Gulf of Mexico.

The focus of the routes was the fastest way to connect Kansas City to seaports, since it was only 800 miles from Kansas City to the Gulf of Mexico compared to 1,400 miles between Kansas City and the Atlantic Ocean ports.

KCS operated over a railroad system consisting of that extended south to the Mexico–United States border at which point another KCS-operated railroad, Kansas City Southern de México (KCSM), hauled freight into northeastern and central Mexico and to several Gulf of Mexico ports and the Pacific Port of Lázaro Cárdenas.

Canadian Pacific Railway purchased KCS in December 2021 for . On April 14, 2023, KCS became a wholly owned subsidiary of CPR, and both companies began conducting business under the name of their parent company, Canadian Pacific Kansas City.

== History ==
=== Origins (1887–1900) ===
Arthur Stilwell began construction on the first line of what would eventually become the Kansas City Southern Railway in 1887, in suburban Kansas City, Mo. Together with Edward L. Martin, Stilwell built the Kansas City Suburban Belt Railway, a 20-mile long railroad, which was incorporated in 1887 and began operation in 1890.

In 1897, Stilwell completed the Kansas City, Pittsburg and Gulf Railroad Company (KCP&amp;G) with a route running north and south from Kansas City to Shreveport, Louisiana, terminating at Port Arthur, Texas. In order to comply with Louisiana laws Stilwell, William S. Taylor, E. L. Martin, and others, officers of the Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas Trust Company of Kansas City, Missouri, as well as the KCP&amp;G, incorporated the &quot;Kansas City, Shreveport &amp; Gulf Railway Company&quot; (KCS&amp;G) on September 27, 1894, to build or acquire railroads in Louisiana. The Arkansas Construction Company completed a 41.10-mile line from Arkansas-Louisiana State line (northern terminus with the Texarkana &amp; Fort Smith Railway Company) to Shreveport on April 15, 1896. The Kansas City Terminal Construction Company completed a 76.40-mile Shreveport to Many line on October 26, 1896, an 85.80-mile Many to De Quincy line on June 30, 1897, and the 19.16-mile De Quincy to the Louisiana-Texas state line on September 11, 1897, where the southern terminus was with the Texarkana &amp; Fort Smith Railway Company. A 26.60-mile narrow gauge branch line was acquired from the Calcasieu, Vernon &amp; Shreveport Railway Company (CV&amp;S), through the Arkansas Construction Company, that ran from De Quincy, West Lake, Lake Charles, and Lockport, and the construction company widened the tracks to standard gauge. In 1895, the KCP&amp;G entered into a contract with the KCS&amp;G to operate and maintain its property.

In 1900, KCP&amp;G was taken over by the Kansas City Southern Railway Company (KCS).

By 1914, the KCS owned the separate entities of the Arkansas Western Railway Company, Fort Smith &amp; Van Buren Railway Company, Kansas City, Shreveport &amp; Gulf Railway Company, the Kansas City, Shreveport &amp; Gulf Terminal Company, the Maywood &amp; Sugar Creek Railway Company, the Port Arthur Canal &amp; Dock Company, the Poteau Valley Railroad Company, the Texarkana &amp; Fort Smith Railway Company, the Arkansas Western Railway Company, the Glenn Pool Tank Line Company, the Joplin Union Depot Company, the Kansas City Terminal Railway Company, and the K. C. S. Elevator Company.

=== 20th century (1900–2000) ===
In 1962, Kansas City Southern Industries, Inc. (KCSI) was established when the company began to diversify its interests into other industries. At that time, KCS became a subsidiary of KCSI. In 2002, KCSI formally changed its name to Kansas City Southern (KCS), with KCS remaining a subsidiary.

From 1940 to 1969, the Kansas City Southern operated two primary passenger trains, the &quot;Flying Crow&quot; (Trains #15 &amp; 16) between Kansas City and Port Arthur (discontinued on May 11, 1968) and the &quot;Southern Belle&quot; (Trains #1 &amp; 2) between Kansas City and New Orleans (discontinued on November 2, 1969). In 1995, a new &quot;Southern Belle&quot; was created as an executive train to entertain shippers and guests. It also pulls the &quot;Holiday Express&quot; train in December, making the rounds to several KCS cities and stations.

===Access to Mexico===
In 1996, Kansas City Southern Industries won a Mexican government concession to operate the &quot;Northeast Railroad,&quot; a potentially profitable 5,335-kilometer rail system connecting key cities and ports. This line, which carried a significant portion of Mexico&#x27;s rail traffic and freight from the United States, was highly sought after due to its strategic location, including proximity to numerous auto assembly plants. The concession was operated by a new company known as Transportación Ferroviaria Mexicana (TFM), which was a joint venture of KCSI with Transportación Maritima Mexicana (TMM). In 2005, TMM sold its share of TFM to KCSI, prompting a rename to Kansas City Southern de México (KCSM).

In 1995, the expanding KCS bought 49 percent of Tex-Mex Railway. At the time, the investment was considered questionable by some observers, because TM had no connection to KCSR. The solution would not come until 1996, when Union Pacific and Southern Pacific agreed to provide Tex-Mex with trackage rights from Robstown northbound and through the Houston area to connect with KCSR at Beaumont. This agreement was one of the conditions imposed by the Surface Transportation Board (STB) for the approval of the proposed merger between UP and SP. Responding to increased international trade between the US and Mexico, the railroad built a large railroad yard and intermodal freight transport facility at Laredo in 1998. They also won Regional Railroad of the Year that same year.

=== 21st century (2000–2023) === 
On March 21, 2021, the Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) announced that it was purchasing KCS for US$29 billion. Prior, a competing cash and stock offer was made by Canadian National Railway (CN) on April 20, 2021 at $33.7 billion. On May 13, 2021, KCS announced in a statement that they planned to accept the higher offer from CN, but would give CP until May 21 to come up with a higher bid, which was not made. However, CN&#x27;s merger attempt would be blocked by a STB ruling in August 2021 that the company could not use a voting trust to assume control of KCS, due to concerns about potentially reduced competition in the railroad industry.

On September 12, 2021, KCS accepted a new $31 billion offer from CP. Though CP&#x27;s offer was lower than the offer made by CN, the STB permitted CP to use a voting trust to take control of KCS. The voting trust allowed CP to become the beneficial owner of KCS in December 2021, but the two railroads operated independently until receiving approval for a merger of operations from the STB. That approval came on March 15, 2023, which permitted the railroads to merge as soon as April 14, 2023. 

==Operations==
KCS hauled freight for seven major government and business sectors: agriculture and minerals, military, automotive, chemical and petroleum, energy, industrial and consumer products and intermodal.

KCS had the shortest north-south rail route between Kansas City, Missouri, and several key ports along the Gulf of Mexico in Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. The KCS, along with the Union Pacific railroad, was one of only two Class I railroads based in the United States that has not originated as the result of a merger between previously separate companies.

The company owned or contracted with intermodal facilities along its rail network in Kansas City, MO; Jackson, Miss.; Wylie, Texas; Kendleton, Texas; and Laredo, Texas.

KCS operated over a railroad system consisting of that extended south to the Mexico–United States border at which point another KCS railroad, Kansas City Southern de México (KCSM), can haul freight into northeastern and central Mexico and to the Gulf of Mexico ports of Tampico, Altamira, and Veracruz, as well as to the Pacific Port of Lázaro Cárdenas, fulfilling the vision of KCS founder Arthur Edward Stilwell.

== Corporate structure ==

Kansas City Southern Railway was owned by Kansas City Southern, known as &quot;Kansas City Southern Industries&quot; until 2002, which in turn also owned other companies like Kansas City Southern de México and the Panama Canal Railway&#x27;s operator, Panama Canal Railway Company.

<doc id="345704" wikidata="Q11143305" url="?curid=345704" title="Poisson algebra">
<text>In mathematics, a Poisson algebra is an associative algebra together with a Lie bracket that also satisfies Leibniz&#x27;s law; that is, the bracket is also a derivation. Poisson algebras appear naturally in Hamiltonian mechanics, and are also central in the study of quantum groups. Manifolds with a Poisson algebra structure are known as Poisson manifolds, of which the symplectic manifolds and the Poisson–Lie groups are a special case. The algebra is named in honour of Siméon Denis Poisson.

==Definition==
A Poisson algebra is a vector space over a field &quot;K&quot; equipped with two bilinear products, ⋅ and {, }, having the following properties:

* The product ⋅ forms an associative &quot;K&quot;-algebra.
* The product {, }, called the Poisson bracket, forms a Lie algebra, and so it is anti-symmetric, and obeys the Jacobi identity.
* The Poisson bracket acts as a derivation of the associative product ⋅, so that for any three elements &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; and &quot;z&quot; in the algebra, one has {&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; ⋅ &quot;z&quot;} = {&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;} ⋅ &quot;z&quot; + &quot;y&quot; ⋅ {&quot;x&quot;, &quot;z&quot;}.

The last property often allows a variety of different formulations of the algebra to be given, as noted in the examples below.

== Examples ==
Poisson algebras occur in various settings.

===Symplectic manifolds===
The space of real-valued smooth functions over a symplectic manifold forms a Poisson algebra. On a symplectic manifold, every real-valued function &quot;H&quot; on the manifold induces a vector field &quot;XH&quot;, the Hamiltonian vector field. Then, given any two smooth functions &quot;F&quot; and &quot;G&quot; over the symplectic manifold, the Poisson bracket may be defined as:

:formula_1.

This definition is consistent in part because the Poisson bracket acts as a derivation. Equivalently, one may define the bracket {,} as

:formula_2

where [,] is the Lie derivative. When the symplectic manifold is R2&quot;n&quot; with the standard symplectic structure, then the Poisson bracket takes on the well-known form

:formula_3

Similar considerations apply for Poisson manifolds, which generalize symplectic manifolds by allowing the symplectic bivector to be rank deficient.

===Lie algebras===
The tensor algebra of a Lie algebra has a Poisson algebra structure. A very explicit construction of this is given in the article on universal enveloping algebras.

The construction proceeds by first building the tensor algebra of the underlying vector space of the Lie algebra. The tensor algebra is simply the disjoint union (direct sum ⊕) of all tensor products of this vector space. One can then show that the Lie bracket can be consistently lifted to the entire tensor algebra: it obeys both the product rule, and the Jacobi identity of the Poisson bracket, and thus is the Poisson bracket, when lifted. The pair of products {,} and ⊗ then form a Poisson algebra. Observe that ⊗ is neither commutative nor is it anti-commutative: it is merely associative. 

Thus, one has the general statement that the tensor algebra of any Lie algebra is a Poisson algebra. The universal enveloping algebra is obtained by modding out the Poisson algebra structure.

===Associative algebras===
If &quot;A&quot; is an associative algebra, then imposing the commutator [&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;] = &quot;xy&quot; − &quot;yx&quot; turns it into a Poisson algebra (and thus, also a Lie algebra) &quot;A&quot;&quot;L&quot;. Note that the resulting &quot;A&quot;&quot;L&quot; should not be confused with the tensor algebra construction described in the previous section. If one wished, one could also apply that construction as well, but that would give a different Poisson algebra, one that would be much larger.

===Vertex operator algebras===
For a vertex operator algebra (&quot;V&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;ω&quot;, 1), the space &quot;V&quot;/&quot;C&quot;2(&quot;V&quot;) is a Poisson algebra with {&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;} = &quot;a&quot;0&quot;b&quot; and &quot;a&quot; ⋅ &quot;b&quot; = &quot;a&quot;−1&quot;b&quot;. For certain vertex operator algebras, these Poisson algebras are finite-dimensional.

===Z2 grading===
Poisson algebras can be given a Z2-grading in one of two different ways. These two result in the Poisson superalgebra and the Gerstenhaber algebra. The difference between the two is in the grading of the product itself. For the Poisson superalgebra, the grading is given by
:formula_4
whereas in the Gerstenhaber algebra, the bracket decreases the grading by one:
:formula_5

In both of these expressions formula_6 denotes the grading of the element formula_7; typically, it counts how formula_7 can be decomposed into an even or odd product of generating elements. Gerstenhaber algebras conventionally occur in BRST quantization.

<doc id="345705" wikidata="Q608339" url="?curid=345705" title="HMS Hussar (1763)">
<text>HMS &quot;Hussar&quot; was a sixth-rate frigate of the Royal Navy, built in England in 1761–63. She was a 28-gun ship of the , designed by Sir Thomas Slade. She was wrecked at New York in 1780.

In early 2013, a cannon from &quot;Hussar&quot; was discovered stored in a building in New York&#x27;s Central Park still loaded with gunpowder and shot.

==Career==

&quot;Hussar&quot; was commissioned in August 1763 under Captain James Smith, and sent for her commission cruising in the vicinity of Cape Clear. By 1767 she was commanded by Captain Hyde Parker. She continued to serve off North America between 1768 and 1771, before paying off into ordinary in March 1771. After being repaired and refitted at Woolwich from 1774 to 1777, she recommissioned in July 1777 under Captain Elliott Salter. In later life, she was part of the British fleet in North America. During the American Revolution, &quot;Hussar&quot; carried dispatches on the North American station.

&quot;Hussar&quot; captured the Spanish ship of the line &quot;Nuestra Señora del Buen Confeso&quot; (armed en flute), on 20 November 1779.

By mid-1780, the British position in New York was precarious as a French army had joined forces with General George Washington&#x27;s troops north of the city.

==Loss==
When Admiral Sir George Brydges Rodney took his twenty ships of the line south in November, it was decided that the army&#x27;s payroll be moved to the anchorage at Gardiners Bay on eastern Long Island. On 23 November 1780, against his pilot&#x27;s better judgment, &quot;Hussar&quot;″s captain, Charles Pole, decided to sail from the East River through the treacherous waters of Hell Gate between Randall&#x27;s Island and Astoria, Queens (on Long Island). Just before reaching Long Island Sound, &quot;Hussar&quot; was swept onto Pot Rock and began sinking. Pole was unable to run her aground and she sank in of water. The minutes of the Royal Navy&#x27;s court martial into the loss of the frigate (record held at the &quot;National Maritime Museum&quot;, Greenwich), make no mention of any payroll money or other special cargo aboard. The document appears to be little more than an administrative formality. It suggests that whatever valuables were aboard &quot;Hussar&quot; had been off-loaded by the time of her accident.

==Salvage attempts==
Although the British immediately denied there was any gold aboard the ship, and despite the difficulty of diving in the waters of Hell Gate, reports of $2 to $4 million in gold were the catalyst that prompted many salvage efforts over the next 150 years. This continued even after the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers eased the passage through the East River by blowing &quot;the worst features of Hell Gate straight back to hell&quot; with of dynamite in 1876. &quot;Hussar&quot;″s remains, if any survive, are now believed to lie beneath landfill in the Bronx.

On 11 January 2013, preservationists with the Central Park Conservancy in New York were removing rust from a cannon from &quot;Hussar&quot; when they discovered it still contained gunpowder, wadding, and a cannonball. Police were called and bomb disposal staff eventually removed about 1.8 pounds of active black gunpowder from the cannon, which they disposed of at a gun range. &quot;We silenced British cannon fire in 1776 and we don&#x27;t want to hear it again in Central Park,&quot; the New York Police Department said in a statement.

==In popular culture==
In Kim Stanley Robinson&#x27;s 2017 science fiction novel &quot;New York 2140&quot;, a sub-plot centers on an attempt to recover two chests with gold from the wreck of HMS &quot;Hussar&quot; that lies buried under a submerged parking lot in the former Bronx.

<text>The captain of the port is an official who has different functions in the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries.

To some extent, the role of captain of the port is analogous to that of a harbourmaster.

==United Kingdom==
In the Royal Navy, the captain of the port was the officer, usually with the rank of captain, responsible for the day-to-day running of a Naval Dockyard under the authority of the admiral-superintendent. He usually also held the position of Queen&#x27;s or King&#x27;s harbourmaster and was directly responsible for the captain&#x27;s department, which among other things operated the yard craft.

From the 1650s until the mid-nineteenth century, the position was known as master attendant, and ranked immediately below that of Navy Commissioner. Occupants of the office were required to be &quot;skilful in all affairs requisite in the looking after, equipping and setting out of State ships&quot;, for which they initially received an annual wage of between £90 and £100 plus accommodation. The office was often combined with that of harbourmaster, and existed until the second half of the 19th century, when occupants (in common with Royal Naval masters) began to be commissioned with the rank of staff captain. From the early twentieth century, the equivalent appointment became staff captain (dockyard), then captain of the dockyard, and finally captain of the port from 1969.

==United States==

In the United States, the captain of the port is usually the United States Coast Guard sector commander. Captain of the port duties involve enforcing within their respective areas port safety and security and marine environmental protection regulations, including regulations for the protection and security of vessels, harbors, and waterfront facilities; anchorages; security zones; safety zones; regulated navigation areas; deepwater ports; water pollution; and ports and waterways safety.

<doc id="345714" wikidata="Q7404989" url="?curid=345714" title="Sallie Baliunas">
<text>Sallie Louise Baliunas (born February 23, 1953) is a retired astrophysicist. She formerly worked at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard &amp; Smithsonian and was the Deputy Director of the Mount Wilson Observatory from 1991 to 2003.

==Early life and education==
Baliunas was born and grew up in New York City and its suburbs. She attended public schools in the New York City area and high school in New Jersey. She received a BS in astrophysics from Villanova University in 1974, and an AM and a PhD in astrophysics from Harvard University in 1975 and 1980. Her doctoral thesis was titled, &quot;Optical and ultraviolet studies of stellar chromospheres of Lambda Andromedae and other late-type stars&quot;.

==Career==
Baliunas was a research associate of the Harvard College Observatory in 1980 and became an astrophysicist in the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard &amp; Smithsonian in 1989.

Baliunas was also a visiting scholar at Dartmouth College, an adjunct professor at Tennessee State University, and was deputy director of the Mount Wilson Observatory from 1991 to 2003.

She has been a member of the American Astronomical Society, American Geophysical Union, American Physical Society, Astronomical Society of the Pacific, International Astronomical Union, and Sigma XI.

She served on both the scientific advisory board and the board of directors of the Marshall Institute, a now defunct conservative think tank.

==Astrophysics==
Baliunas&#x27;s main focus was initially on astrophysical research. She studied visible and ultraviolet spectroscopy of stars; structure, variations, and activity in cool stars; evolution of stellar angular momentum; solar variability and global change; adaptive optics; exoplanets of Sun-like stars. She has published little in recent years, with only two refereed astronomy papers since 2010.

==Global warming and solar variability==
In 1992, Baliunas was third author on a &quot;Nature&quot; paper that used observed variations in sun-like stars as an analogue of possible past variations in the Sun. The paper says that
:&quot;the sun is in an unusually steady phase compared to similar stars, which means that reconstructing the past historical brightness record may be more risky than has been generally thought&quot;.

By 1995, she had entered the global warming controversy. In January of that year the Marshall Institute think tank published a review she had written for them, &quot;Are Human Activities Causing Global Warming?&quot; disputing the IPCC Second Assessment Report and arguing that &quot;predictions of an anthropogenic global warming have been greatly exaggerated, and that the human contribution to global warming over the course of the 21st century will be less than one degree Celsius and probably only a few tenths of a degree.&quot; She concluded with the view that &quot;even if fears of anthropogenic global warming were realized – a concern which finds no support in the scientific data – there is no significant penalty for waiting at least two decades before taking corrective action to reduce global CO2 emissions.&quot; The work of Willie Soon and Baliunas, suggesting that solar variability is more strongly correlated with variations in air temperature than any other factor, even carbon dioxide levels, has been widely publicized by lobby groups including the Marshall Institute and Tech Central Station, and mentioned in the popular press.
Baliunas and Soon became well known for climate change denial, and in 1997 she won the Petr Beckmann Award for her &quot;devastating critique of the global warming hoax.&quot;

In regard to there being a connection between CO2 rise and climate change, she said in a 2001 essay with Willie Soon:

: But is it possible that the particular temperature increase observed in the last 100 years is the result of carbon dioxide produced by human activities? The scientific evidence clearly indicates that this is not the case... measurements of atmospheric temperatures made by instruments lofted in satellites and balloons &quot;show that no warming has occurred in the atmosphere in the last 50 years&quot;. This is just the period in which humanmade carbon dioxide has been pouring into the atmosphere and according to the climate studies, the resultant atmospheric warming should be clearly evident.

The claim that atmospheric data showed no warming trend was incorrect, as the published satellite and balloon data at that time already showed a warming trend (see satellite temperature record). In later statements Baliunas acknowledged the measured warming in the satellite and balloon records, though she disputed that the observed warming reflected human influence.

Baliunas contends that findings of human influence on climate change are motivated by financial considerations: &quot;If scientists and researchers were coming out releasing reports that global warming has little to do with man, and most to do with just how the planet works, there wouldn&#x27;t be as much money to study it.&quot; She does not address the countervailing financial considerations of the energy companies that fund some of her collaborators, including Willie Soon who received over $1 million from petroleum and coal interests since 2001.

=== Controversy over the 2003 &quot;Climate Research&quot; paper ===

In 2003, Baliunas and aerospace engineer Willie Soon published a review paper on historical climatology in &quot;Climate Research&quot;, which concluded that &quot;the 20th century is probably not the warmest nor a uniquely extreme climatic period of the last millennium.&quot; With Soon, Baliunas investigated the correlation between solar variability and temperatures of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. When there are more sunspots, the total solar output increases, and when there are fewer sunspots, it decreases. Soon and Baliunas attribute the Medieval warm period to such an increase in solar output, and believe that decreases in solar output led to the Little Ice Age, a period of cooling from which the earth has been recovering since 1890.

The circumstances of the paper&#x27;s publication were controversial, prompting concerns about the publishers&#x27; peer review process. An editorial revolt within &quot;Climate Research&quot; followed, with half of the journal&#x27;s ten editors eventually resigning. The publisher subsequently stated that critics said that the conclusions of the paper &quot;cannot be concluded convincingly from the evidence provided&quot; and that the journal &quot;should have requested appropriate revisions prior to publication.&quot;

==Ozone depletion==
In 1995, Baliunas testified before the United States House Science Subcommittee on Energy and Environment that CFCs were not responsible for ozone depletion. An article written by Baliunas and Soon in 2000 for the Heartland Institute, a conservative and libertarian public policy think tank, promoted the idea that ozone depletion rather than CO2 emissions could explain atmospheric warming.

<doc id="345717" wikidata="Q253394" url="?curid=345717" title="Honolulu Marathon">
<text>The Honolulu Marathon (branded JAL Honolulu Marathon for sponsorship reasons) is a marathon (26.2 miles or 42.2km) in Honolulu, Hawaii. It was first held on December 16, 1973, and it typically takes places on the second Sunday in December. The marathon is popular for its tropical location in Hawaii, and is also popular among first-time marathoners, many of whom are visitors from Japan. Japan Air Lines has been the title sponsor of the race since 1985. 

About 20,000 runners finish the Honolulu Marathon each year, and it is one of the five largest marathons in the United States. Entry to the Honolulu Marathon is open to anyone, and there is neither a lottery nor a set of qualifying times. There is also no time limit to finish the course. From 1973 to 2006, more than 585,000 runners have started the Honolulu Marathon, with over 482,000 finishers, for a finishing rate of over 82%.

== History ==

The race was first organized by Former Honolulu Mayor Frank Fasi in 1973, taking an interest in organizing the race after observing the Boston Marathon and the positive impact that came with the race. 

During its formative period (1973–1978) the Honolulu Marathon doubled in size every year—a rate that has been equaled only once. 

At the forefront of the growth of the Honolulu Marathon was cardiologist Jack Scaff, one of the first physicians to prescribe running as therapy for heart disease. In 1977, Sports Illustrated&#x27;s senior writer and Olympic marathoner Kenny Moore wrote a feature story about the race. Moore postured that, like the growth of long-distance running itself, the race&#x27;s success came about not simply from an interest in competition, but from a quest for personal longevity and an enhanced quality of life. That article was soon followed by the book &quot;The Honolulu Marathon&quot;, by journalist Mark Hazard Osmun; the book was a revelatory chronicle of the then-unfolding social craze coined the &quot;Running Boom,&quot; as exemplified in the Honolulu event.

Over time, the race grew and changed, luring large corporate sponsors and paying substantial prize money to the winners. In 1995, the Honolulu Marathon enjoyed the distinction of being the world&#x27;s largest marathon when it drew 34,434 entrants and had 27,022 finishers.

Unique to the Honolulu Marathon among American marathons is its popularity among runners from Japan, where there are very few marathons open to all entrants. In recent years, the majority of entrants have been visitors from Japan; notably in 2008, 14,406 of the total 23,231 entries were from Japan, making up nearly 62.0 percent of the field. The marathon so popular that the Honolulu Marathon Association maintains an office in Tokyo to process entries. 

In 2007, race organizers switched from the ChampionChip timing system they had used since 2000 to a new system from SAI which utilized a smaller, lighter, chip implanted in a strip of paper. For a myriad of reasons that are not entirely clear (heavy rains, improper usage, failed generators), the timing devices apparently failed to accurately record the start, split and finish times of all 24,300 participants, forcing race officials to manually review finish line video tape of all 24,000+ runners in order to confirm their correct finishing times. The same year, Ethiopian Ambesse Tolossa was disqualified as the men&#x27;s champion because the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency found he had a banned substance in his system.

The 2012 Honolulu Marathon was held on Sunday, December 9, 2012. The field for the 40th Honolulu Marathon reached 30,898 entries at the marathon expo at the Hawaii Convention Center. 16,067 of those registered entrants were from Japan. The 2012 marathon was the largest in 15 years, and the second largest in America of 2012, only surpassed by the Chicago Marathon.

Organizers decided not to hold the 2020 in-person edition of the race on its original date in December due to the coronavirus pandemic, but reserved the option to postpone it to an alternate date in the first half of 2021. All registrants were given the option of running the race virtually or transferring their entry to 2021.

In 2022, 92-year-old Mathea Allansmith completed the Honolulu Marathon with a time of 11:19:49, earning a Guinness World Record as the oldest woman to have completed any marathon.

=== Satellite races in Iraq and Afghanistan ===
The Honolulu Marathon has been popular with U.S. military personnel stationed in Hawaii. With many Hawaii-based troops deployed abroad, the marathon coordinated with the military to organize satellite marathon races on U.S. bases in Iraq and Afghanistan on the same day as the main race, with finishers receiving the same T-shirts and medals. The first such race was held in 2004 at a U.S. base in Tarin Kowt, Afghanistan. In 2005, the marathon organized a similar race at Camp Victory in Baghdad.

On Dec. 12, 2010, the 43rd Sustainment Brigade, home stationed in Fort Carson, Colorado, now deployed to Kandahar Air Field, Afghanistan, organized a satellite run on the base. Nearly 135 people from several different nations participated in the run.

==Course==
Starting near Ala Moana Beach Park across from Ala Moana Center, the course progresses west along the waterfront toward downtown Honolulu, then loops through downtown and bends back east through Waikiki, around Diamond Head, and out toward the eastern suburbs of Honolulu, winding through Hawaii Kai before doubling back toward the finish line at Waikiki&#x27;s Kapiolani Park. Marathoners consider the course moderately difficult because of the tropical weather conditions, with temperatures starting at around 65 °F (18 °C) and rising to as high as 80 °F (27 °C), and a relatively hilly course compared with other marathons. Nevertheless, the race also remains a popular choice for first-time marathoners.

==Winners==
Although the difficulty of the course precludes world-record pace performances, winners of the Honolulu Marathon have used it as a stepping stone to greater achievements. For instance, three-time winner Ibrahim Hussein of Kenya later won the Boston Marathon three times; and 1993 winner Bong-Ju Lee won the silver medal and 1995 winner Josia Thugwane won the gold medal, both in the 1996 Olympic Marathon in Atlanta.

<text>Thomas Meik ( – ) was a 19th-century Scottish engineer.

He is particularly associated with ports and railways in Scotland and northern England, Meik fathered two prominent engineering sons: Patrick Meik and Charles Meik. The firm they founded remains active, today part of the Jacobs Engineering Group.

==Early career==
He was born at Easter Duddingston on 20 January 1812, the son of Patrick Meik and his wife, Barbara Scott.

Educated at the High School and University of Edinburgh, Thomas Meik worked for two years with a firm of millwrights named Moodie and was then apprenticed to John Steedman, an engineer and contractor who was working in Glasgow on the Hutcheson Bridge (designed by Robert Stevenson, grandfather of author Robert Louis Stevenson).

His first long-term post was as assistant engineer to William Chadwell Mylne of the New River Company, London.

==River Wear Commission==
In 1845, at the age of 33, Meik was appointed engineer to the River Wear Commission (responsible for maritime works around Sunderland). In 1859, the commission took over the construction of the Hendon Dock on the south side of the Wear, and Meik was responsible for the entire works (the task included a grain warehouse and a lighthouse – which, although relocated when the South Pier was shortened in 1983, still stands today). Just a few miles further north, he was also consulting engineer to Blyth Harbour from 1862.

==Partnerships==

In 1868, he entered into partnership with William David Nisbet (1837–1897) in Sunderland and Edinburgh. Commissions included a rail freight link, the Hylton, Southwick and Monkwearmouth Railway, transporting coal from collieries sited along the line to the nearby port at Sunderland. The railway was subsequently acquired by the North Eastern Railway. However, later railway designs were to prove more successful for Meik. In Scotland he designed a rail link to Eyemouth, an extension to the Forfar to Brechin line, the Newburgh and North Fife Railway and the East Fife Central Railway.

The partnership with Nisbet was dissolved in 1875 and Meik formed a new partnership with his sons. Work included the Scottish ports of Ayr, Burntisland and Bo&#x27;ness, and the firm acted as consulting engineers to the new dock at Silloth for the North British Railway.

In 1880 he had offices at 6 York Place, Edinburgh.

He retired in 1888 and died at his home in Newbattle Terrace in Edinburgh in 1896 aged 84, leaving his business in the hands of his sons, Patrick and Charles. He was buried in Duddingston Kirkyard. The grave lies in the south-west corner.

The firm they founded remains active. It was later known as Halcrow Group Limited, taking its name from Sir William Halcrow, who joined the company in the early years of the 20th century; Halcrow was acquired by US firm CH2M Hill in 2011, and in 2017 CH2M was acquired by Jacobs Engineering Group.

==Family==

He was married to Julia Hunter (1825–1911), daughter of Walter Hunter of Bow in Middlesex.

Their children included Thomas Carsie Meik (1847–1894), Julia (died in infancy), Patrick Walter Meik MICE (1851–1910), Edward (died in childhood), Charles Scott Meik (1853–1923) and Henry Hunter Meik WS (d.1923).

<text>This is a list of [[Filmmaking|film production]] and distribution companies. A production company may specialize in producing their in-house films or own subsidiary development companies. Major production companies often distribute films from independent production companies. This list includes both active and no longer active (defunct) companies. Active production companies are either run by themselves or as a subsidiary.

Film studios also create television programs for broadcast syndication.

Pornographic film studios and production companies are not included in this list: they can be found on the separate list of pornographic film studios.

<doc id="345726" wikidata="Q1517523" url="?curid=345726" title="Old Red Sandstone">
<text>Old Red Sandstone, abbreviated ORS, is an assemblage of rocks in the North Atlantic region largely of Devonian age. It extends in the east across Great Britain, Ireland and Norway, and in the west along the eastern seaboard of North America. It also extends northwards into Greenland and Svalbard. These areas were a part of the paleocontinent of Euramerica (Laurussia). In Britain it is a lithostratigraphic unit (a sequence of rock strata) to which stratigraphers accord supergroup status and which is of considerable importance to early paleontology. The presence of &quot;Old&quot; in the name is to distinguish the sequence from the younger New Red Sandstone which also occurs widely throughout Britain.

== Sedimentology ==
The Old Red Sandstone describes a group of sedimentary rocks deposited in a variety of environments in the late Silurian, through the Devonian and into the earliest part of the Carboniferous. The body of rock, or facies, is dominated by terrigenous deposits and conglomerates at its base, and progresses to a combination of dunes, and sediments that may have been laid down in lakes, river, estuaries, and possibly other coastal environments. The Old Red Sandstone was long thought to have been deposited mostly in freshwater, but more recent studies have discovered marine fossils (such as brachiopods) in some locations, its vertebrate fauna also occurs in typically marine environments, and an isotopic study also found significant marine influence in mineralised tissues of its vertebrates. Thus, at least some strata appear to have been deposited on the coast, probably in marginal marine environments.

The familiar red colour of these rocks arises from the presence of iron oxide, but not all the Old Red Sandstone is red or sandstonethe sequence also includes conglomerates, mudstones, siltstones and thin limestones and colours can range from grey and green through to red and purple. These deposits are closely associated with the erosion of the Caledonian Mountain chain which was thrown up by the collision of the former continents of Avalonia, Baltica and Laurentia to form the Old Red Sandstone Continent- an event known as the Caledonian Orogeny.

Many fossils are found within the rocks, including early fishes, arthropods and plants. As is typical with terrestrial red beds, the vast majority of the rock is not fossil-bearing; however there are isolated, localized beds within the rock that do contain fossils. Rocks of this age were also laid down in South West England (hence the name &#x27;Devonian&#x27;; from Devon) though these are of true marine origin and are not included within the Old Red Sandstone.

== Stratigraphy ==
Since the Old Red Sandstone consists predominantly of rocks of terrestrial origin, it does not generally contain marine fossils which would otherwise prove useful in correlating one occurrence of the rock with another, both between and within individual sedimentary basins. Accordingly, local stage names were devised and these remain in use to some extent today though there is an increasing use of international stage names. Thus in the Anglo-Welsh Basin, there are frequent references to the Downtonian, Dittonian, Breconian and Farlovian stages in the literature. The existence of a number of distinct sedimentary basins throughout Britain has been established.

=== Orcadian Basin ===
The Orcadian Basin extends over a wide area of North East Scotland and the neighbouring seas. It encompasses the Moray Firth and adjoining land areas, Caithness, Orkney and parts of Shetland. South of the Moray Firth, two distinct sub-basins are recognized at Turriff and at Rhynie. The sequence is more than thick in parts of Shetland. The main basin is considered to be an intramontane basin resulting from crustal rifting associated with post-Caledonian extension, possibly accompanied by strike-slip faulting along the Great Glen Fault system.

=== Argyll ===
There are a scatter of exposures of the Old Red Sandstone around Oban and the Isle of Kerrera on the West Highland coast, this unit is sometimes referred to as the Kerrera Sandstone Formation. The unit is up to 128m thick in its type area and consists of green and red sandstones and conglomerates, typically containing large ( across) elliptical well rounded clasts, accompanied by siltstones, mudstones and limestones. On Kerrera a conglomerate of andesite boulders rests unconformably on Dalradian black, pyritic slates (Easdale Slate) of the Easdale Subgroup. At Oban there is merely an erosional contact incorporating debris of the slate in a basal conglomerate. The ORS deposits around Oban are considered latest Silurian (Pridoli) to earliest Devonian in age. They are interpreted as alluvial fans which filled a depositional basin from the east and northeast. Small outliers occur near Taynuilt and either side of Loch Avich. The deposits are especially obvious on Kerrera where they form the bedrock across half of the island. These are conformably overlain by peperite and the basaltic and andesitic Lorne plateau lavas. The ORS on Kerrera and isolated localities around Oban are known for their fossils, particularly fish.

=== Midland Valley of Scotland ===
The Midland Valley graben defined by the Highland Boundary Fault in the north and the Southern Uplands Fault in the south harbours not only a considerable amount of Old Red Sandstone sedimentary rocks but also igneous rocks of this age associated with extensive volcanism. There is a continuous outcrop along the Highland Boundary Fault from Stonehaven on the North Sea coast to Helensburgh and beyond to Arran. A more disconnected series of outcrops occur along the line of the Southern Uplands Fault from Edinburgh to Girvan. Old Red Sandstone often occurs in conjunction with conglomerate formations, one such noteworthy cliffside exposure being the Fowlsheugh Nature Reserve, Kincardineshire.

=== Scottish borders ===
A series of outcrops occur from East Lothian southwards through Berwickshire. Hutton&#x27;s famous unconformity at Siccar Point occurs within this basin - see History of study below.

=== Anglo-Welsh Basin ===
This relatively large basin extends across much of South Wales from southern Pembrokeshire in the west through Carmarthenshire into Powys and Monmouthshire and through the southern Welsh Marches, into Herefordshire, Worcestershire and Gloucestershire. Outliers in Somerset and north Devon complete its extent.

With the exception of south Pembrokeshire, all parts of the basin are represented by a range of lithologies assigned to the Lower Devonian and to the Upper Devonian, the contact between the two being unconformable and representing the complete omission of any Middle Devonian sequence. 

==== South Powys/Brecon Beacons ====
The lowermost formations are of upper Silurian age, these being the Downton Castle Sandstone Formation and the overlying Moor Cliffs Formation (formerly the Raglan Mudstone Formation). The top of this formation is marked by a well-developed calcrete, the Chapel Point Limestone. The lowermost Devonian formation is the Freshwater West Formation (formerly the St Maughans Formation), itself overlain by the Senni Formation (formerly the Senni Beds) which is in turn overlain by the Brownstones Formation. In the east, a further calcrete, the Ffynnon Limestone (sometimes pluralised) is developed at the interface between the Freshwater West and Senni formations. The Senni Formation is not recorded further east.

The Upper Devonian sequence is rather thinner and comprises a series of formations which are more laterally restricted. In the Brecon Beacons, the Plateau Beds Formation is unconformably overlain by the Grey Grits Formation though further east these divisions are replaced by the Quartz Conglomerate Group which is itself subdivided into a variety of different formations.

==== Pembrokeshire ====
The sequence in Pembrokeshire differs from that of the main part of the basin to the east, and falls into two parts.

In North Pembrokeshire to the north of the Ritec Fault, both the middle and upper ORS are missing with only the lower ORS present; this is divided into an earlier Milford Haven Group comprising in ascending order, the Red Cliff, Sandy Haven and Gelliswick Bay formations and a later Cosheston Group with, again in ascending order, its constituent Llanstadwell, Burton Cliff, Mill Bay, Lawrenny Cliff and New Shipping formations. These respectively equate with the Temeside, Raglan Mudstone and St Maughans formations of the central and eastern part of the basin. 
*&quot;[middle and upper ORS missing]&quot;
* Cosheston Group
** New Shipping Formation
** Lawrenny Cliff Formation
** Mill Bay Formation
** Burton Cliff Formation
** Llanstadwell Formation
* Milford Haven Group
** Gelliswick Bay Formation
** Sandy Haven Formation (including Townsend Tuff Beds)
** Albion Sands Formation / Lindsway Bay Formation
** Red Cliff Formation

In south Pembrokeshire to the south of the Ritec Fault, the lower ORS is represented by, in ascending order, the Freshwater East, Moors Cliff and Freshwater West formations. These are unconformably overlain by the Ridgeway Conglomerate Formation. The middle ORS is missing whilst the Upper ORS is represented by the Gupton and West Angle formations. 
* Skrinkle Sandstone Group
** West Angle Formation
** Gupton Formation
* &quot;[Part of middle ORS missing]&quot;
* Ridgeway Conglomerate Formation
* &quot;[Part of middle ORS missing]&quot;
* Milford Haven Group
** Freshwater West Formation (including Rat Island Mudstone Member and Conigar Pit Sandstone Member)
** Moor Cliffs Formation (including Chapel Point Limestone Member and Townsend Tuff Bed)
** Freshwater East Formation

The Freshwater East Formation, and corresponding Red Cliff Formation of north Pembrokeshire, are both late Silurian in age.

=== Anglesey ===
A small and separate basin exists here where both alluvial and lacustrine deposits are recorded. Both the middle and upper ORS are missing but the lower ORS is represented, in ascending order, by the Bodafon, Traeth Bach, Porth y Mor and Traeth Lligwy formations. Calcretes are also recorded representing carbonate-rich soils developed between periods of sediment deposition. The present day outcrop occupies a narrow zone from Dulas Bay on Anglesey&#x27;s northeast coast, southwards to the town of Llangefni.

== History of study ==
In 1787 James Hutton noted what is now known as Hutton&#x27;s Unconformity at Inchbonny, Jedburgh, and in early 1788 he set off with John Playfair to the Berwickshire coast and found more examples of this sequence in the valleys of the Tower and Pease Burns near Cockburnspath. They then took a boat trip from Dunglass Burn east along the coast with the geologist Sir James Hall of Dunglass and at Siccar Point found what Hutton called &quot;a beautiful picture of this junction washed bare by the sea&quot;, where 345-million-year-old Old Red Sandstone overlies 425-million-year-old Silurian greywacke.

In the early 19th century, the paleontology of the formation was studied intensively by Hugh Miller, Henry Thomas De la Beche, Roderick Murchison, and Adam Sedgwick—Sedgwick&#x27;s interpretation was the one that placed it in the Devonian: he coined the name of that period. The term &#x27;Old Red Sandstone&#x27; was originally used in 1821 by Scottish naturalist and mineralogist Robert Jameson to refer to the red rocks which underlay the &#x27;Mountain Limestone&#x27; i.e. the Carboniferous Limestone. They were thought at that time to be the British version of Germany&#x27;s Rotliegendes, which is in fact of Permian age. Many of the science of stratigraphy&#x27;s early debates were about the Old Red Sandstone.

In older geological works predating theories of plate tectonics, the United States&#x27; Catskill Delta formation is sometimes referred to as part of the Old Red Sandstone. In the modern day it is recognized that the two are not stratigraphically continuous but are very similar due to being formed at approximately the same time by the same processes.

== Use as a building stone ==

The Old Red Sandstone has been widely used as a building stone across those regions where it outcrops. Notable examples of its use can be found in the area surrounding Stirling, Stonehaven, Perth and Tayside. The inhabitants of Caithness at the northeastern tip of Scotland also used the stone to a considerable extent. Old Red Sandstone has also frequently been used in buildings in Herefordshire, Monmouthshire and the former Brecknockshire (now south Powys) of south Wales.

<text>Mary Ann Todd Lincoln (December 13, 1818July 16, 1882) served as the first lady of the United States from 1861 until the assassination of her husband, President Abraham Lincoln, in 1865.

Mary Todd was born into a large and wealthy slave-owning family in Kentucky, although Mary never owned slaves and in her adulthood came to oppose slavery. Well educated, after finishing-school in her late teens, she moved to Springfield, the capital of Illinois. She lived there with her married sister Elizabeth Todd Edwards, the wife of an Illinois congressman. Before she married Abraham Lincoln, Mary was courted by his long-time political opponent Stephen A. Douglas. 

Mary Lincoln staunchly supported her husband&#x27;s career and political ambitions and throughout his presidency she was active in keeping national morale high during the Civil War. She acted as the White House social coordinator, throwing lavish balls and redecorating the White House at great expense; her spending was the source of much consternation. She was seated next to Abraham when he was assassinated in the President&#x27;s Box at Ford&#x27;s Theatre in Washington, D.C., on April 14, 1865. 

The Lincolns had four sons of whom only the eldest, Robert, survived both parents. The deaths of her husband and three of her sons weighed heavily on her. Young Thomas (Tad) who died suddenly in 1871, had just spent extended time traveling with her, after Robert married. Mary Lincoln suffered from physical and mental health issues. She had frequent migraines, which were exacerbated by a head injury in 1863. She likely suffered with depression or possibly bipolar disorder. She was briefly institutionalized for psychiatric illness in 1875, and then spent several years traveling in Europe. She later retired to the home of her sister in Springfield, where she died in 1882 at age 63. She is buried with her husband and three younger sons in the Lincoln Tomb, a National Historic Landmark.

==Early life and education==

Todd was born on December 13, 1818 in Lexington, Kentucky, as the fourth of seven children of Robert Smith Todd, a banker, and Elizabeth &quot;Eliza&quot; (Parker) Todd. When she was six, her mother died in childbirth. Two years later, her father married Elizabeth &quot;Betsy&quot; Humphreys and they had nine children together. Todd had a difficult relationship with her stepmother.

From 1832, Mary and her family lived in what is now known as the Mary Todd Lincoln House, an elegant 14-room residence at 578 West Main Street in Lexington.

Mary&#x27;s paternal great-grandfather, David Levi Todd, was born in County Longford, Ireland, and immigrated through Pennsylvania to Kentucky. Another great-grandfather, Andrew Porter, was the son of an Irish immigrant to New Hampshire and later Pennsylvania. Her great-great maternal grandfather Samuel McDowell was born in Scotland, and emigrated to Pennsylvania. Other Todd ancestors came from England.

At an early age Mary was sent to Madame Mentelle&#x27;s finishing school, where the curriculum concentrated on French and literature. She learned to speak French fluently and studied dance, drama, music, and social graces. By age 20, she was regarded as witty and gregarious with a grasp of politics. Like her family, she was a Whig.

Mary began living with her sister Elizabeth Porter Edwards in Springfield, Illinois, in October 1839. Elizabeth was married to Ninian W. Edwards, son of a former governor. He served as Mary&#x27;s guardian. Mary was popular among the gentry of Springfield, and though she was courted by the rising young lawyer and Democratic Party politician Stephen A. Douglas and others, she chose Abraham Lincoln, a fellow Whig.

==Marriage and family==
Mary Todd married Abraham Lincoln on November 4, 1842, at her sister Elizabeth&#x27;s home in Springfield. She was 23 years old and he was 33 years of age.

Their four sons, all born in Springfield, Illinois, were:
* Robert Todd Lincoln (1843–1926), lawyer, diplomat (U.S. Secretary of War), businessman
* Edward Baker Lincoln, known as &quot;Eddie&quot; (1846–1850), died of tuberculosis
* William Wallace Lincoln, known as &quot;Willie&quot; (1850–1862), died of typhoid fever while Lincoln was President
* Thomas Lincoln, known as &quot;Tad&quot; (1853–1871), died at age 18 (either from pleurisy, pneumonia, congestive heart failure, or tuberculosis)

Robert and Tad (Thomas) survived to adulthood and the death of their father, and only Robert outlived his mother.
==Lincoln&#x27;s career and home life==

While Lincoln pursued his increasingly successful career as a Springfield lawyer, Mary supervised their growing household. Their house, where they resided from 1844 until 1861, still stands in Springfield, and has been designated the Lincoln Home National Historic Site. During Lincoln&#x27;s years as an Illinois circuit lawyer, Mary was often left alone for months at a time to raise their children and run the household. Mary supported her husband socially and politically, not least when Lincoln was elected president in 1860.

Mary cooked for Lincoln often during his presidency. Raised by a wealthy family, her cooking was simple, but satisfied Lincoln&#x27;s tastes, which included imported oysters.

==First Lady of the United States==
During her White House years, Mary Lincoln faced many personal difficulties generated by political divisions within the nation. Her family was from a border state where slavery was permitted. Several of her half-brothers served in the Confederate Army and were killed in action, and one brother served the Confederacy as a surgeon.

Mary staunchly supported her husband in his quest to save the Union and was strictly loyal to his policies. Considered a &quot;westerner&quot; although she had grown up in the more refined Upper South city of Lexington, Mary worked hard to serve as her husband&#x27;s First Lady in Washington, D.C., a political center dominated by eastern culture. Lincoln was regarded as the first &quot;western&quot; president, and critics described Mary&#x27;s manners as coarse and pretentious. She had difficulty negotiating White House social responsibilities and rivalries, spoils-seeking solicitors, and baiting newspapers in a climate of high national intrigue in Civil War Washington. She refurbished the White House, which included extensive redecorating of all the public and private rooms as well as the purchase of new china, which led to extensive overspending. The president was very angry over the cost, even though Congress eventually passed two additional appropriations to cover these expenses. Mary also was a frequent purchaser of fine jewelry and on many occasions bought jewelry on credit from the local Galt &amp; Bro. jewelers. Upon President Lincoln&#x27;s death, she had a large amount of debt with the jeweler, which was subsequently waived and much of the jewelry was returned.

Mary suffered from severe headaches, described as migraines, throughout her adult life, as well as protracted depression. Her headaches seemed to become more frequent after she suffered a head injury in a carriage accident during her White House years. A history of mood swings, fierce temper, public outbursts throughout Lincoln&#x27;s presidency, as well as excessive spending, has led some historians and psychologists to argue that Mary suffered from bipolar disorder. Another theory holds that Mary&#x27;s manic and depressive episodes, as well as many of her physical symptoms, could be explained as manifestations of pernicious anemia. Mary Lincoln&#x27;s grief over Willie&#x27;s death was so devastating that she took to her bed for three weeks, so desolated that she could not attend his funeral or look after Tad. Mary was so distraught for many months that Lincoln had to employ a nurse to look after her.

During her White House years, she often visited hospitals around Washington to give flowers and fruit to wounded soldiers. She took the time to write letters for them to send to their loved ones. From time to time, she accompanied Lincoln on military visits to the field. Responsible for hosting many social functions, she has often been blamed by historians for spending too much money on the White House.

==Assassination of Abraham Lincoln==
As the American Civil War ended, Mrs. Lincoln expected to continue as the First Lady of a nation at peace. President Lincoln awoke on the morning of April 14, 1865, in a pleasant mood. Robert E. Lee had surrendered several days before to Ulysses Grant, and now the President was awaiting word from North Carolina on the surrender of Joseph E. Johnston. The morning papers carried the announcement that the President and his wife would be attending the theater that evening. At one point, Mary developed a headache and was inclined to stay home, but Lincoln told her he must attend because newspapers had announced that he would. 

Mrs. Lincoln sat with her husband watching the comic play &quot;Our American Cousin&quot; at Ford&#x27;s Theatre, along with their guests Henry Rathbone and Clara Harris. During the third act, Mr. Lincoln and Mrs. Lincoln drew closer together, holding hands while enjoying the play. In the last conversation the Lincolns would ever have, Mary whispered to her husband, who was holding her hand, &quot;What will Miss Harris think of my hanging on to you so?&quot; The president smiled and replied, &quot;She won&#x27;t think anything about it&quot;. 

Five minutes later, at about 10:15 pm, President Lincoln was shot by John Wilkes Booth. She was holding Abraham&#x27;s hand when Booth&#x27;s bullet struck the back of his head. Mrs. Lincoln accompanied her mortally wounded husband across the street to the Petersen House, where he was taken to a back bedroom and laid crosswise on the bed there, where Lincoln&#x27;s Cabinet was summoned, except William Seward, who had been seriously attacked by Lewis Powell, just as Booth was about to carry out his assassination at Ford&#x27;s Theater, several minutes earlier. Their oldest son, Robert, sat with Lincoln throughout the night and to the following morning, Saturday, April 15, 1865. At one point, Edwin M. Stanton, Lincoln&#x27;s Secretary of War, ordered Mary from the room as she was so unhinged with grief.

President Lincoln remained in a coma for approximately nine hours. He died at 7:22 a.m., at the age of 56. Shortly before 7a.m. Mary was allowed to return to Lincoln&#x27;s side, and, as Dixon reported, &quot;she again seated herself by the President, kissing him and calling him every endearing name.&quot; As he died his breathing grew quieter, his face more calm. According to some accounts, at his last drawn breath, on the morning after the assassination, he smiled broadly and then expired. Historians, most notably author Lee Davis have emphasized Lincoln&#x27;s peaceful appearance when and after he died: &quot;It was the first time in four years, probably, that a peaceful expression crossed his face.&quot; Assistant Secretary of the Treasury in the Lincoln Administration, Maunsell Bradhurst Field wrote, &quot;I had never seen upon the President&#x27;s face an expression more genial and pleasing.&quot; The President&#x27;s secretary, John Hay, said, &quot;A look of unspeakable peace came upon his worn features&quot;.

==Later life==
After her husband&#x27;s death, she received messages of condolence from all over the world, many of which she attempted to answer personally. Responding to Queen Victoria she wrote:

I have received the letter which Your Majesty has had the kindness to write. I am deeply grateful for its expressions of tender sympathy, coming as they do, from a heart which from its own sorrow, can appreciate the &quot;intense grief&quot; I now endure.

Victoria had suffered the loss of her husband, Prince Albert, four years earlier.

As a widow, Mrs. Lincoln returned to Illinois and lived in Chicago with her sons. Her husband had left an estate of $80,000 (), which should have been enough to keep her in comfort, if not in style. In 1868, Mrs Lincoln, who had a lavish, unstable relationship with money, advertised in the &quot;New York&quot; &quot;World&quot; for aid and attempted to sell her personal effects at auction, which shocked the public. She and her young son Tad moved to Europe and settled in Frankfurt for several years. During this time the Seligman family helped look after her, paying the cost of the voyage, sending her money, and advocating on her behalf.

In 1868, her former modiste (dressmaker) and confidante, Elizabeth Keckley (1818–1907), published &quot;Behind the Scenes, or, Thirty Years a Slave, and Four Years in the White House&quot;. She had been born into slavery, purchased her freedom and that of her son, and become a successful businesswoman in Washington, D.C. Although this book provides valuable insight into the character and life of Mary Todd Lincoln, at the time the former First Lady (and much of the public and press) regarded it as a breach of friendship and confidentiality. Keckley was widely criticized for her book, especially as her editor had published letters from Mary Lincoln to her. It has now been gratefully accepted by many historians and biographers and been used to flesh out the President and First Lady&#x27;s personalities behind the scenes in the Executive Mansion and been used as the basis for several motion pictures and TV mini-series during the late 20th and early 21st centuries.

In an act approved by a low margin on July 14, 1870, the United States Congress granted Mrs. Lincoln a life pension of $3,000 a year ($ in dollars). Mary had lobbied hard for such a pension, writing numerous letters to Congress and urging patrons such as Simon Cameron and Joseph Seligman to petition on her behalf. She insisted that she deserved a pension just as much as the widows of soldiers, as she portrayed her husband as a fallen commander. At the time a pension was unusual for widows of presidents, and Mary Lincoln had alienated many congressmen, making it difficult for her to gain Congress&#x27;s approval.

After her oldest son, Robert&#x27;s marriage in 1868, Mary took Thomas (Tad) to Europe where he attended school and she traveled, sometimes with him as her companion. Soon after returning to the United States, Tad died of what is now thought to have been a heart condition. Tad&#x27;s death in July 1871, following the deaths of two of her other sons and her husband, brought on an overpowering grief and depression. Her surviving son, Robert Lincoln, a rising young Chicago lawyer, was alarmed at his mother&#x27;s increasingly erratic behavior. In March 1875, during a visit to Jacksonville, Florida, Mary became unshakably convinced that Robert was deathly ill; hurrying to Chicago, she found him healthy. During her visit with him, she told him that someone had tried to poison her on the train and that a &quot;wandering Jew&quot; had taken her pocketbook but returned it. She also spent large amounts of money there on items she never used, such as draperies and elaborate dresses (she wore only black after her husband&#x27;s assassination). She walked around the city with $56,000 in government bonds sewn into her petticoats (underskirts). Despite this large amount of money and the $3,000-a-year stipend from Congress, Mrs. Lincoln still feared poverty.

In 1872, she went to spiritualist photographer William H. Mumler, who produced a photograph of her that appears to faintly show Lincoln&#x27;s ghost behind her, now housed at the Allen County Public Library in Fort Wayne, Indiana. The College of Psychic Studies, referencing notes belonging to William Stainton Moses, claims that the photo was taken in the early 1870s, that Lincoln had assumed the name of &#x27;Mrs. Lindall&#x27;, and that Lincoln had to be encouraged by Mumler&#x27;s wife to identify her husband on the photo. P.T. Barnum, testifying against Mumler in his eventual fraud trial, presented a photo featuring himself with the &#x27;ghost&#x27; of Abraham Lincoln, demonstrating for the court how easy it was to make one of Mumler&#x27;s images. The image is recognized now as a hoax created via double exposure by inserting a previously prepared positive glass plate featuring the image of the deceased into the camera in front of an unused sensitive glass plate.

==Institutionalization==
Due to her erratic behavior, Robert initiated proceedings to have her institutionalized. On May 20, 1875, following a trial, a jury committed her to a private asylum in Batavia, Illinois. After the court proceedings, she was so despondent that she attempted suicide. She went to several pharmacies and ordered enough laudanum to kill herself, but an alert pharmacist frustrated her attempts and finally gave her a placebo.

Three months after being committed to Bellevue Place, she devised her escape: She smuggled letters to her lawyer, James B. Bradwell, and his wife Myra Bradwell, who was not only her friend but also a feminist lawyer. She also wrote to the editor of the &quot;Chicago Times&quot;. Soon, the public embarrassments that Robert had hoped to avoid were looming, and his character and motives were in question, as he controlled his mother&#x27;s finances. The director of Bellevue at Mary&#x27;s trial had assured the jury she would benefit from treatment at his facility. In the face of potentially damaging publicity, he declared her well enough to go to Springfield to live with her sister Elizabeth as she desired.

Mary Lincoln was released into the custody of her sister in Springfield. In 1876, she was declared competent to manage her own affairs. The earlier committal proceedings had resulted in Mary being profoundly estranged from her son Robert, and they did not see each other again until shortly before her death.

Mrs. Lincoln spent the next four years traveling throughout Europe and took up residence in Pau, France. Her final years were marked by declining health. She suffered from severe cataracts that reduced her eyesight; this condition may have contributed to her increasing susceptibility to falls. In 1879, she suffered spinal cord injuries in a fall from a stepladder. She traveled to New York in 1881 and lobbied for an increased pension after the assassination of President Garfield raised the issue of provisions for his family. She faced a difficult battle, due to negative press over her spending habits and rumors about her handling of her personal finances, including $56,000 in government bonds left to her by her husband. Congress eventually granted the increase, along with an additional monetary gift.

During the early 1880s, Mary Lincoln was confined to the Springfield, Illinois, residence of her sister Elizabeth Edwards. 

==Death==
On July 15, 1882, exactly eleven years after her youngest son died, she collapsed at her sister&#x27;s home, lapsed into a coma, and died the next morning of a stroke at age 63. Her funeral service was held at First Presbyterian Church in Springfield.

==In popular culture==

Biographies have been written about Mary Lincoln as well as her husband. Barbara Hambly&#x27;s &quot;The Emancipator&#x27;s Wife&quot; (2005) is considered a well-researched historical novel that provides context for her use of over-the-counter drugs containing alcohol and opium, which were frequently given to women of her era. Janis Cooke Newman&#x27;s historical novel &quot;Mary: Mrs. A. Lincoln&quot; (2007), in which Mary tells her own story after incarceration in the asylum in an effort to maintain and prove her sanity, is considered by Mary&#x27;s recent biographer, Jean H. Baker, to be &#x27;close to life&#x27; in its depiction of Mary Lincoln&#x27;s life. The grief experienced through her widowhood is a theme of Andrew Holleran&#x27;s 2006 novel, &quot;Grief&quot;.
Another historical novel in which Mary Todd Lincoln is depicted is &quot;Courting Mr. Lincoln&quot; (2019) by Louis Bayard, centering on Lincoln&#x27;s relationships with Mary Todd and Joshua Fry Speed, Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s good friend, in Springfield from 1839 to 1842.

Mary Lincoln has been portrayed by several actresses in film, including Kay Hammond in &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; (1930) directed by D.W. Griffith; Marjorie Weaver in &quot;Young Mr. Lincoln&quot; (1939) directed by John Ford; Ruth Gordon in &quot;Abe Lincoln in Illinois&quot; (1940); Julie Harris in &quot;The Last of Mrs. Lincoln&quot;, a 1976 television adaptation of the stage play; Mary Tyler Moore in the 1988 television mini-series &quot;Lincoln&quot;; Donna Murphy in the 1998 movie &quot;The Day Lincoln Was Shot&quot;; Sally Field in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s 2012 film &quot;Lincoln&quot;; Penelope Ann Miller in &quot;Saving Lincoln&quot; (2012); and Mary Elizabeth Winstead in &quot;Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter&quot; (2012), set during the Civil War. Mezzo-soprano Elaine Bonazzi portrayed Mary in Thomas Pasatieri&#x27;s Emmy Award winning opera &quot;The Trial of Mary Lincoln&quot; in 1972.

In 1955, Vivi Janiss played the historical Mary Todd Lincoln in &quot;How Chance Made Lincoln President&quot; in the anthology television series, &quot;TV Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;. Richard Gaines was cast as Abraham Lincoln, and Ken Hardison played their son, Robert Todd Lincoln.

In 2005, Sufjan Stevens referenced Mary Todd Lincoln in the instrumental track &quot;A Short Reprise for Mary Todd, Who Went Insane, but for Very Good Reasons&quot; from his album &quot;Illinois&quot;, which is themed around the state where she resided the majority of her life.

In 2024, the critically acclaimed play &quot;Oh, Mary!&quot; opened Off-Broadway. The dark comedy shines a light on Mary Todd Lincoln&#x27;s life during the end of the Civil War and in the weeks leading up to Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s assassination. The imaginative script weaves in queer elements and modern references and has been extended multiple times and will transfer to Broadway due to its popularity. Writer Cole Escola drew inspiration from their own insecurities when writing the completely original text and was later made aware of Lincoln&#x27;s own struggles with mental health. 

&quot;Mrs. President&quot;, a play by John Ransom Phillips, centres around Mary Lincoln&#x27;s interaction with the photographer Matthew Brady.

Mary Todd Lincoln was portrayed by Lili Taylor in the 2024 Apple TV+ miniseries series &quot;Manhunt&quot;.

==Family==
Her sister Elizabeth Todd married Ninian Edwards Jr., the son of the Illinois Governor Ninian Edwards. Their daughter Julia Edwards married Edward L. Baker Jr., editor of the &quot;Illinois State Journal&quot; and son of Edward L. Baker Sr. Their daughter, Mary Todd Lincoln&#x27;s grandniece Mary Edwards Brown, served as custodian of the Lincoln Homestead, as did her own daughter. Mary&#x27;s half-sister Emilie Todd married Benjamin Hardin Helm, CSA general and son of the Kentucky Governor John L. Helm. Another half-sister Elodie Todd married CSA Brig. General Nathaniel H. R. Dawson, later the third U.S. Commissioner of Education. One of Mary Todd&#x27;s cousins was Dakota Territory Congressman/US General John Blair Smith Todd.

==Regard by historians==
Historians have regarded Lincoln poorly as a first lady, seeing her as meddling and disruptive. Lincoln&#x27;s poor regard is due to the perception of Lincoln as having had psychological conditions that made the life of President Lincoln more difficult. Lincoln is seen as having suffered not just from likely mental illness during her husband&#x27;s presidency, but also from the personal toll that having two of her children die, including one during her husband&#x27;s presidency, took on her.

Since 1982, Siena College Research Institute has periodically conducted surveys asking historians to assess American first ladies according to a cumulative score on the independent criteria of their background, value to the country, intelligence, courage, accomplishments, integrity, leadership, being their own women, public image, and value to the president. In the first four surveys, Lincoln was ranked in the lowest quartile. However, in the fifth survey (conducted in 2020), Lincoln&#x27;s regard had risen enough to place her in the third-quartile. Lincoln&#x27;s rise in regard from being ranked as the worst first lady in the first survey to the third-quartile in 2020 is perhaps due to an increase in writing on her.

In terms of cumulative assessment, Lincoln has been ranked:
*42nd-best of 42 in 1982
*37th-best of 37 in 1993
*36th-best of 38 in 2003
*35th-best of 38 in 2008
*31st-best of 39 in 2014
*29th-best of 40 in 2020

In the 2008 Siena Research Institute survey, Lincoln was ranked the lowest in four of the ten criteria: value to the country, accomplishments, leadership, and public image. In the 2014 survey, Lincoln and her husband were ranked the 7th-highest out of 39 first couples in terms of being a &quot;power couple&quot;.

<text>In telecommunications, the term anisochronous refers to a periodic signal, pertaining to transmission in which the time interval separating any two corresponding transitions is not necessarily related to the time interval separating any other two transitions. It can also pertain to a data transmission in which there is always a whole number of unit intervals between any two significant instants in the same block or character, but not between significant instants in different blocks or characters. 

In practice, anisochronous typically means that data packets are not arriving in the same order they were transmitted, thus dramatically altering the quality of a multimedia transmission (e.g. voice, video, music), or after processing to restore isochronicity, have had significant amounts of latency added. Isochronous and anisochronous are characteristics, while synchronous and asynchronous are relationships.

<text>The Carlist Wars (, ) were a series of civil wars that took place in Spain during the 19th century. The contenders fought over claims to the throne, although some political differences also existed. Several times during the period from 1833 to 1876 the Carlists—followers of Don Carlos (1788–1855), an infante, and of his descendants—rallied to the cry of &quot;God, Country, and King&quot; and fought for the cause of Spanish tradition (Legitimism and Catholicism) against liberalism, and later the republicanism, of the Spanish governments of the day. The Carlist Wars had a strong regional component (Basque region, Catalonia, etc.), given that the new order called into question region-specific law arrangements and customs kept for centuries.

When King Ferdinand VII of Spain died in 1833, his widow, Queen Maria Cristina, became regent on behalf of their two-year-old daughter Queen Isabella II. The country splintered into two factions known as the Cristinos (or Isabelinos) and the Carlists. The Cristinos supported Queen Maria Cristina and her government, and were the party of the Liberals. The Carlists advocated for Infante Carlos of Spain, Count of Molina, a pretender to the throne and brother of the deceased Ferdinand VII. Carlos denied the validity of the Pragmatic Sanction of 1830 that abolished the semi Salic Law (he was born before 1830). The Carlists wanted a return to autocratic monarchy.

While some historians count three wars, other authors and popular usage refer to the existence of two major engagements, the First (1833–1840) and the Second (1872–1876) Carlist Wars, treating the 1846–1849 events as a minor episode.

*The [[First Carlist War]] (1833–1840) lasted more than seven years and the fighting spanned most of the country at one time or another, although the main conflict centered on the Carlist homelands of the Basque Country and Aragon, Catalonia and Valencia.
*The [[Second Carlist War]] (1846–1849) was a minor Catalan uprising. The rebels tried to install Carlos, Count of Montemolín on the throne. In Galicia, a smaller-scale uprising was put down by General Ramón María Narváez.
*The [[Third Carlist War]] (1872–1876) began in the aftermath of the deposition of one ruling monarch and the abdication of another. Queen Isabella II was overthrown by a conspiracy of liberal generals in 1868, and left Spain in some disgrace. The &quot;Cortes&quot; (Parliament) replaced her with Amadeo, the Duke of Aosta (and second son of King Victor Emmanuel II of Italy). Then, when the Spanish elections of 1872 resulted in government violence against Carlist candidates and a swing away from Carlism, the Carlist pretender, Carlos VII, decided that only force of arms could win him the throne. Thus the Third Carlist War began; it lasted for four years, until 1876.
*The [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–1939) became for Carlists another crusade against secularism. In spite of the victory of their side, General Francisco Franco frustrated the pretensions of Carlist monarchism; he subsumed their militias into the Nationalist army and their political party, the Traditionalist Communion, into his &quot;National Movement&quot;, the FET y de las JONS.
The Carlists were primarily composed of rural and traditionalist elements, and were more successful initially due to their use of guerrilla warfare tactics. However, they were ultimately defeated by the liberal forces led by General Baldomero Espartero.

<doc id="345741" wikidata="Q33663" url="?curid=345741" title="Omagua language">
<text>Omagua is a Tupi-Guarani language closely related to Cocama, belonging to the Group III subgroup of the Tupí-Guaraní family, according to Aryon Rodrigues&#x27; classification of the family. Alternate names for Omagua include: Agua, Anapia, Ariana, Cambeba, Cambeeba, Cambela, Campeba, Canga-Peba, Compeva, Janbeba, Kambeba, Macanipa, Omagua-Yete, Pariana, Umaua, Yhuata.

==Historical and modern distribution==

When Europeans first arrived in the western Amazon Basin in significant number in the late 17th and early 18th century, Omagua was spoken by approximately 100,000 individuals in two major areas: along the Amazon River proper, between the mouths of the Napo River and Jutaí River, and in the vicinity of the Aguarico River, a tributary of the upper Napo River. At this time, then, Omagua speakers lived in regions corresponding to modern eastern Peruvian Amazonia, western Brazilian Amazonia, and eastern Ecuadoran Amazonia.

These Omagua populations were decimated by disease, Portuguese slave raids, and conflicts with Spanish colonial authorities during the early 18th century, leaving them drastically reduced. As of 2011, Omagua was spoken by &quot;fewer than ten elderly individuals&quot; in Peru, and by a number of semi-speakers near the town of Tefé in Brazil, where the language is known as Cambeba (Grenand and Grenand 1997).

==Genesis of Omagua ==

Comparative work by Cabral (1996) demonstrated that Omagua (and its sister language Cocama) exhibit significant grammatical restructuring effects due to intense language contact between a Tupí-Guaraní language and speakers of one or more non-Tupí-Guaraní languages. Rodrigues and Cabral (2003) further suggest that Cocama (and by extension, Omagua) could be considered the outcomes of rapid creolization. Cabral (1996) argued that this language contact transpired in the late 17th century in Jesuit mission settlements, while Michael (2014) argues that the language contact situation responsible for the genesis of Omagua and Cocama transpired during the Pre-Columbian period.

==Phonology==
===Consonants===

Omagua has thirteen consonants across five places of articulation. /ts/ and /tʃ/ only occur in a small number of words: /tʃ/ may have entered the inventory through loanwords from Cocama or Quechua.

===Vowels===
Omagua has five vowels: /i, ɪ, ɨ, u, a/. This is somewhat unusual, as there are four high vowels but only one low vowel (/a/).

<text>Gabriele Susanne Kerner (born 24 March 1960), better known by her stage name Nena, is a German singer who rose to international fame in 1983 as the lead vocalist of the band Nena with the Neue Deutsche Welle song &quot;99 Luftballons&quot;. In that same year, the band re-recorded this song in English as &quot;99 Red Balloons&quot;. Nena&#x27;s re-recording of some of the band&#x27;s old hit songs as a solo artist, produced by the co-composer of most of them, her former Nena band colleague and keyboard player Uwe Fahrenkrog-Petersen, rekindled her solo career in 2002. Combined with the success of the Nena band years, she has sold over 25 million records, making her the most successful German pop singer in chart history.

Gabriele Susanne Kerner was born on 24 March 1960 in Hagen, West Germany, while her family lived in the nearby town of Breckerfeld. She was the oldest out of three children; her father was a teacher. She spent the earliest part of her childhood in Breckerfeld and later lived in Hagen. She acquired her nickname “Nena” while on a vacation to Mallorca, Spain, with her parents. (from Niña) is a Spanish word meaning &quot;baby girl&quot;. In 1977, she left high school before gaining the &quot;Abitur&quot;, and in the three following years she was trained as a goldsmith.

==Musical career==
===Beginnings===
Nena&#x27;s musical career began on 2 July 1979 when guitarist Rainer Kitzmann founded the Stripes and, on the basis of having seen her dancing at a local disco, asked her to audition for the position of the lead singer. The group, based in Hagen, performed songs with English lyrics and had a minor hit with the song &quot;Ecstasy&quot;, but never achieved mainstream success and disbanded on 3 March 1982. However, The Stripes&#x27;s record company, CBS, offered Nena a record deal if she would move to Berlin and make music with German lyrics. In May 1982, Nena and her then-boyfriend moved to West Berlin,&lt;ref name=&quot;Pop/rocky staralbum&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; where they met future band members guitarist Carlo Karges, keyboard player Uwe Fahrenkrog-Petersen, and bass player Jürgen Dehmel. Together, they formed the band Nena.
In June 1982, they released their first single, &quot;Nur geträumt&quot;, which became an instant hit in Germany after the band appeared on the German television show &quot;Musikladen&quot; on 21 August 1982. The single reportedly sold 40,000 copies the day after the song appeared on the show and reached in the German charts.

===1982–1987: International success and band breakup===
In 1983, the band released its first album &quot;Nena&quot;, which contained the singles &quot;99 Luftballons&quot; and &quot;Leuchtturm&quot;. &quot;99 Luftballons&quot; became a number one hit in West Germany and the Netherlands in 1983 and went on to major international chart success the following year, an English version hitting in the UK and the original German version hitting in the US, behind Van Halen&#x27;s &quot;Jump&quot;. In 1984, Casey Kasem&#x27;s radio show &quot;American Top 40&quot; introduced a &quot;mixed&quot; version of the song, &quot;splicing&quot; the German and English versions together.

In May 1984, while on a tour in the UK, Nena made the headlines of the British red-top press for having unshaved armpits. While not uncommon in continental Europe at the time, this was considered unusual in English-speaking countries to the extent that some consider it an explanation for the commercial failure of the follow-ups to &quot;99 Luftballons&quot;. Baffled by the attention generated, Nena asked her manager&#x27;s girlfriend to shave her and has remained clean shaved ever since. Referring to the &quot;huge indignation&quot; the issue raised, Nena, in her memoirs published in 2005, wrote, &quot;Can a girl from Hagen, who dreams of the big wide world and is in love with Mick Jagger, have no idea that girls can&#x27;t under any circumstances have hair under the arm? Yes she can. I simply had no idea!&quot;

Although &quot;99 Luftballons&quot; was Nena&#x27;s only hit in the English-speaking world, the band continued to enjoy success in several European countries in the following years including with the single &quot;Irgendwie, irgendwo, irgendwann&quot;. Nena&#x27;s next international single &quot;Just a Dream&quot; (an English language re-issue of &quot;Nur geträumt&quot;) reached in the UK charts in 1984; it had &quot;Indianer&quot; on the B-side. A dance version of &quot;Just a Dream&quot; was released in the 1990s to a new audience and became a club anthem. 
The band split in 1987 and Nena went solo thereafter.

===1989: Launch of solo career===
Nena&#x27;s first solo album &quot;Wunder gescheh&#x27;n&quot; was released on 5 November 1989. The title track (German for &quot;Miracles Happen&quot;), composed by Nena herself, relates to the fact that Nena was at the time pregnant with twins, but release of the album that appeared just four days before the fall of the Berlin Wall (on 9 November) and the fact that she performed the song at the end of the &quot;&quot; three days later has ever since associated it with that historic event. It was to prove to be her last major hit of the 20th century as throughout the 1990s her albums and singles although often critically acclaimed were less commercially successful. In 1993, following the indifferent performance of her second solo album &quot;Bongo Girl&quot;, Sony decided not to renew Nena&#x27;s recording contract, and the label which distributed her third album, RMG Music Entertainment, disappeared shortly afterwards. In 1995, Nena and her growing family moved from Berlin to Hamburg, borrowing money from a family friend in order to do so since her bank declined to extend credit.

===2002: Return to chart success===

In 2002, Nena celebrated her 20th anniversary on stage with the album &quot;Nena feat. Nena&quot;, a disc produced by Uwe Fahrenkrog-Petersen (her former band colleague and author of almost all of the band&#x27;s and her chart successes) and consisting of newly arranged recordings of the band&#x27;s hits from the 1980s. This album marked a &quot;comeback&quot; for Nena, and spawned a number of successful chart entries. The remake of &quot;Anyplace, Anywhere, Anytime&quot; as an English-German duet with Kim Wilde was a hit in various European countries, reaching the spot in the Netherlands and Austria, and in Germany, in 2003.

Having regalvanised her career by virtue of the band&#x27;s 1980s hits, Nena reestablished herself as a force with entirely new material (produced again by Uwe Fahrenkrog-Petersen) with the 2005 album &quot;Willst du mit mir gehn&quot; which quickly achieved platinum status and climbed to in the German charts. The first single from the album, &quot;Liebe ist&quot;, reached on the German charts in early 2005, and was the theme song for a German telenovela, &quot;Verliebt in Berlin&quot;. It reached the top position 22 years after &quot;99 Luftballons&quot;, the longest span between first and last number one in German chart history.

In October 2007, Nena released a new album entitled &quot;Cover Me&quot;, made up entirely of cover songs. David Bowie, Rolling Stones and Rammstein are three of the bands covered. She also released the single, &quot;Ich kann nix dafür&quot; in April 2007 for the film, &quot;Vollidiot&quot;, and her cover of &quot;She&#x27;s a Rainbow&quot; by the Rolling Stones in the US and the UK. In 2009 she recorded and released a new version of her hit song &quot;99 Luftballons&quot;, which more closely follows the 1980s original, in contrast to her 2002 version. This song was first performed in Germany on 6 September 2009. Some parts of the new version are in French.

===2009: Own record label===
Since 2009, Nena&#x27;s releases have been published by her own record label, The Laugh &amp; Peas Company, which also promotes the work of her daughter&#x27;s group (Adameva) and that of one of her protegées from &quot;The Voice of Germany&quot;, Sharron Levy.

Nena released a new single on 18 September 2009, called &quot;Wir sind wahr&quot;, and a new album on 2 October: &quot;Made in Germany&quot;. The autobiographical ballad from the album &quot;In meinem Leben&quot; became her fourteenth top 10 hit in Germany, taking her to 12th position in the all-time list of , the third highest placed German act and top German female. She also collaborated with the popular techno-rap artists to produce a new single, &quot;Strobo Pop&quot;. In 2011, she contributed vocals to the track &quot;Let Go Tonight&quot; by Kevin Costner and Modern West.

In late 2012, Nena released her 11th solo studio album, &quot;Du bist gut&quot;, which peaked at in the German charts, although the tracks released as singles from the album were not as successful as those from her previous albums since her 2002 &quot;comeback&quot;.

Nena&#x27;s next album, &quot;Oldschool&quot;, which was produced by the German rapper and hip hop artist Samy Deluxe, was released on 27 February 2015. Distribution rights for the album were agreed with Sony Music, 22 years after the company dropped Nena as a recording artist. The album maintained Nena&#x27;s 21st century chart success pattern (top 5 in Germany, top 10 in Austria, top 20 in Switzerland) but the first two singles released from the album failed to chart. However, for the first time in Nena&#x27;s career, another track from the album (&quot;Magie&quot;), which was not released as a single, crept into the lower echelons of the German singles chart solely by virtue of downloads. Then, in April 2016, fourteen months after &quot;Oldschool&quot;″s release, the third single from the album, &quot;Genau jetzt&quot;, returned Nena to the German Top 30 singles chart for the first time in six years.

===Since 2015: Collaborations and &quot;Licht&quot;===

The period between the releases of &quot;Oldschool&quot; and the 2020 album &quot;Licht&quot; is the longest in Nena&#x27;s career between new studio albums. In an era when artists tend to generate more revenue from live performances than recordings, Nena released two live albums and restricted her studio work to one-track collaborations with Zara Larsson, Dave Stewart, Trettmann and fellow guests from the 2016 &quot;Sing meinen Song&quot; series. In February 2019 Nena provided vocals for the title track and lead single of Schiller&#x27;s album &quot;Morgenstund&quot; which entered the German album chart at number 1 and the top 10 of both the Austrian and Swiss album charts.
In February 2020 Nena announced new music would be published &quot;soon&quot; and a month later on her 60th birthday released the single &quot;Licht&quot;, which became the title track of her next studio album released on 16 October. &quot;Licht&quot; maintained Nena&#x27;s 21st century album chart pattern by reaching in Germany, in Switzerland and in Austria, although none of its three singles released ahead of the album charted.

===Live performances===

Since 1997, Nena has toured Germany and its neighbouring countries annually, typically performing between 15 and 50 concerts every year.

In 2003, she took the stage during the Howard Jones 20th Anniversary concert at the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire in London to sing &quot;99 Luftballons&quot;, with both German and English lyrics. In 2004, Nena went on stage at the Mayday Music Festival in Dortmund, accompanied by the techno duo . She sang the song &quot;Bang Bang&quot;, and was later joined on stage by DJ Westbam to perform &quot;Oldschool Baby&quot;. In March 2015, Nena promoted the release of the &quot;Oldschool&quot; album with a &quot;club tour&quot; of 16 smaller venues (for 200 to 700 people) including her former primary school. A recording of one of these concerts at the SO36 club in Berlin on 4 March 2015 was released as Nena&#x27;s sixth live album &quot;Live at SO36&quot; on 4 March 2016, exactly one year later. Later in 2015, Nena announced her intention to perform live in the US for the first time by way of a similar &quot;club tour&quot;, which was initially planned for early 2016 before taking place as a three-date &quot;mini tour&quot; in September and October. During this tour, Nena met Dave Stewart with whom she collaborated to release in March 2018 the single &quot;Be my rebel&quot;, the video for which went on to win 40 international awards.

Nena&#x27;s 2018 &quot;Nichts versäumt&quot; tour of mainly sold-out concerts in 45 towns and cities attracted in excess of 250,000 fans and won the German Live Entertainment Award (LEA) for &quot;concert hall tour of the year&quot;. The concert in Dortmund on 29 June 2018 was recorded for the &quot;Nichts versäumt&quot; live DVD which was released on 9 November 2018.

Nena&#x27;s initial live appearances in 2020 were cancelled due to government restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic but were replaced from July that year with the &quot;Niemand hält uns auf&quot; (nobody stops us) series of 12 drive-in, &quot;picnic&quot; and &quot;360&quot; concerts held in accordance with Germany&#x27;s prevailing social distancing rules. In February 2021 in the debate in Germany about how COVID-19 restrictions should be lifted, Nena sparked controversy by announcing, &quot;there will be no two-class society at my concerts. You&#x27;re all always welcome. Whether you get vaccinated or not is entirely your decision and should be respected by everyone.&quot; Nevertheless, the majority of Nena&#x27;s concerts originally planned for 2021 were postponed to 2022, although she remained scheduled to appear at a number of festivals. However, in July 2021, organisers cancelled her appearances in some festivals after Nena encouraged fans to disregard social-distancing rules during a concert in Berlin. In September 2021 Nena cancelled all her remaining 2022 concerts in Germany declaring, &quot;all people are welcome at a Nena concert. Our country is going in a totally different direction and I am not going to be a part of it.&quot; In late 2022, with COVID-19 restrictions lifted, Nena announced a full resumption of her pre-pandemic touring pattern in 2023.

==Other work==
Besides her singing career, Nena has also acted in the 1983 musical comedy film &quot;Gib Gas – Ich will Spass&quot; (released in the US as &quot;Hangin&#x27; Out&quot;) opposite fellow musician , and the 1987 invisibility comedy &quot;Der Unsichtbare&quot; starring Klaus Wennemann and Barbara Rudnik, and voiced the character Saphira for the German dub of the movie &quot;Eragon&quot; (2006) and the role of the Princess for the German version of &quot;Arthur and the Invisibles&quot; (2006) alongside Tokio Hotel&#x27;s Bill Kaulitz. Kaulitz has also stated on many occasions that Nena is his favourite singer.

In 2008, Nena appeared as one of the coaches on the German TV series &quot;Dein Song&quot;, in which established artists mentor a youngster to produce a song. Nena was also one of the coaches on &quot;The Voice of Germany&quot; for 3 seasons before announcing her withdrawal from the show in March 2014. In April and May 2016 she was one of the participants in the third season of &quot;Sing meinen Song&quot;, a show in which well-known artists perform each other&#x27;s songs and judge their favourites. In February 2017 and 2018, Nena appeared as a juror in the fifth and sixth seasons of &quot;The Voice Kids&quot; together with her daughter Larissa.

In 2007, jointly with her partner Philipp Palm, Thomas Simmerl, and Silke Steinfadt, she founded the Neue Schule Hamburg, a school following the Sudbury model.

Nena wrote an autobiographical book, &quot;Willst du mit mir gehn&quot;, jointly with Claudia Thesenfitz, a journalist. Nena&#x27;s contributions are her disparate accounts of various episodes in her life. Most of Thesenfitz&#x27;s contributions are excerpts from interviews of many of Nena&#x27;s friends, co-workers, and relatives.

Since becoming a mother, Nena has released a number of albums consisting of songs for children. In the 1990s, she hosted several TV shows, including &quot;Metro&quot; and &quot;Countdown Grand Prix&quot;, the German preselection for the &quot;Eurovision Song Contest&quot;, in 1998.

==Influences and other interests and pursuits==
In addition to citing the Ramones,&lt;ref name=&quot;Look In 21/4/84&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; David Bowie and Debbie Harry as early influences, Nena&#x27;s main artistic source of inspiration and her favourite band is the Rolling Stones. Nena has covered their songs in concert and on her 2007 &quot;Cover Me&quot; album. In 1984 Nena said, &quot;If I hadn&#x27;t started listening to the Rolling Stones when I was 12 I&#x27;d have been a different person, a secretary or something like that.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NME 5/5/84&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Nena said she disliked the English version of &quot;99 Luftballons&quot; because it was too &quot;blatant&quot; and that the Nena band was neither political nor a protest band,&lt;ref name=&quot;Record Mirror 10/3/84&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; she has occasionally publicly lent her name in support of political causes. She supports &quot;Ehe für alle&quot; (marriage for everyone) and, as a mother of five, a campaign against the German government&#x27;s plans to scale back the state provision of midwifery services. In March 2021 Nena expressed her support for the anti-COVID-19 lockdown demonstration in Kassel.

Nena has been a member of various charity ensembles and supergroups including &quot;Band für Afrika&quot; (Germany&#x27;s equivalent of Band Aid) in 1985 and &quot;Marlon und Freunde&quot; in 2006, whose top 10 hit in Germany, &quot;Lieber Gott&quot;, raised funds for flood victims. Nena also supports local causes and in 2015 ran (in socks) 2.5 kilometres (approximately 1.5 miles) in aid of a Stuttgart children&#x27;s hospice.

Nena is a vegetarian and won the PETA (Germany) award for &quot;Sexiest Vegetarian of the Year 2010&quot;. She believes in Jesus and God and says that thanking him for every new day is the cornerstone of her spirituality.

In his 2014 biography of the Nena band, Rolf Brendel, its drummer and Nena&#x27;s boyfriend at the time, said that although other band members used drugs, Nena never did and frowned upon it. Brendel added, &quot;Nena is naturally stoned, she doesn&#x27;t need to take drugs.&quot;

==Personal life==
Nena and the band&#x27;s drummer Rolf Brendel split up in 1987, Nena&#x27;s feelings described in the song &quot;Jetzt bist du weg&quot; (&quot;Now You Are Gone&quot;) from the band&#x27;s final album, &quot;Eisbrecher&quot;.

Nena then started dating Swiss actor Benedict Freitag shortly after the band separated in 1987; he is the son of the German actress Maria Becker and Austrian-Swiss actor Robert Freitag. The couple had three children together, the first being Christopher Daniel, who was born disabled allegedly due to medical errors made during the birth that caused Nena to go into cardiac arrest. He died at the age of 11 months. In 1990 they had twins, Larissa Maria and Sakias Manuel.

After splitting with Freitag, Nena started a relationship with drummer and music producer Philipp Palm from Stuttgart, with whom she had two children, Samuel Vincent (1995), and Simeon Joel (1997). The couple and the four children currently live in Hamburg.

On Christmas Day 2009, Nena became a grandmother when Larissa gave birth to a girl, Carla Maria. Only two days later, Nena&#x27;s son Sakias became a father to a boy named Noah. A third grandchild (Victor, son of Larissa) was born in September 2013 and a fourth in May 2018.

Since 2010, Nena&#x27;s twins Sakias and Larissa have appeared as backing singers on stage and on her albums, and since 2015 her youngest son Simeon has joined her on stage playing keyboards.

<text>Jaye Davidson (born Alfred Amey; 21 March 1968) is an English model, fashion stylist, and retired actor. He made his acting debut as Dil in the thriller film &quot;The Crying Game&quot; (1992), for which he received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Following his breakthrough, he portrayed the villainous Ra in the commercially successful science fiction film &quot;Stargate&quot; (1994). Davidson retired from acting afterwards, disliking the fame that the roles brought him.

==Life==
Davidson was born in Riverside, California, in the United States, and was raised in Borehamwood in Hertfordshire, England. His father is from Ghana and his mother is from England. Davidson is gay. During his acting career, he said that his androgynous look alienated him within the gay community. He stated that gay men &quot;love very masculine men. And I&#x27;m not a very masculine person. I&#x27;m reasonably thin. I have long hair, which isn&#x27;t very popular with gay men&quot;. In 2017, he married Thomas Clarke.

==Career==
Davidson, who had no prior professional acting experience, was discovered at a wrap party for Derek Jarman&#x27;s &quot;Edward II&quot; and was invited to audition for &quot;The Crying Game&quot;. He was cast in the role of Dil. The film was a critical and commercial success. It is known for a surprise plot twist: a love scene in which Dil undresses and main character Fergus (played by Stephen Rea) discovers that Dil is transgender. The scene required full-frontal nudity. Rea later said: &quot;If Jaye hadn&#x27;t been a completely convincing woman, my character would have looked stupid.&quot; When the film was released, Miramax requested that reviewers keep Davidson&#x27;s gender a secret.

For his work in &quot;The Crying Game&quot;, Davidson was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role in 1993. Davidson also received nominations for the Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Most Promising Actor and the Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Most Promising Actress in 1993.

Davidson starred as Ra, an alien impersonating a god, in the 1994 science fiction adventure film &quot;Stargate&quot;. He was surprised when they agreed to pay his $1 million fee.

Davidson later retired from acting, stating that he &quot;genuinely hated the fame&quot; he was receiving. He became more involved in modelling, and has since worked on several high-profile photo shoots, in addition to working as a fashion stylist in Paris.

<doc id="345746" wikidata="Q659739" url="?curid=345746" title="Green Party of Switzerland">
<text>The Green Party of Switzerland (; ; ; ) is a green political party in Switzerland. It is the fifth-largest party in the National Council of Switzerland and the largest party that is not represented on the Federal Council.

==History==
The first Green party in Switzerland, MPE, was founded as a local party in 1971 in the town of Neuchâtel. In 1979, Daniel Brélaz was elected to the National Council as the first Green MP on the national level (in Switzerland and in the world). Local and regional Green parties and organisations were founded in many different towns and cantons in the following years.

In 1983, two different national green party federations were created: in May, diverse local green groups came together in Fribourg to form the &quot;Federation of Green Parties of Switzerland&quot;, and in June, some left-alternative groups formed the &quot;Green Alternative Party of Switzerland&quot; in Bern. In 1990, an attempt to combine these organisations failed. Afterward, some of the member groups from the &quot;Green Alternative Party&quot; joined the &quot;Federation of Green Parties&quot; which has become the &quot;de facto&quot; national Green party. In 1993, the &quot;Federation of Green Parties&quot; changed its name to the &quot;Green Party of Switzerland&quot;.

In 1986, the first two Green members of a cantonal government became members of the &quot;Regierungsrat&quot; of Bern.

In 1987, the Green Party of Switzerland joined the European Federation of Green Parties.

In the 1990s, members of the Green Party became town mayors, members of the high court, and even the president of a cantonal government (Verena Diener in 1999).

In 2007, the centrist wing of the party split away and formed the Green Liberal Party of Switzerland.

With the rise of right-wing and populist attitudes, the Greens continued to lose support in Switzerland. In the 2023 federal election, they came in fifth place, after their split from the “liberals”.

==Policies==
The party has been described as being centre-left to left-wing. The traditional emphases of the party&#x27;s policies lie in environmentalism and green means of transportation. In terms of foreign policy, the greens set out on the course of openness and pacifism. In economic policy, the Greens are centre-left. The majority of Greens support an accession of Switzerland to the European Union. In immigration policy, the greens support further integration initiatives for immigrants. The Greens support measures to increase energy efficiency, oppose nuclear power, and support raising energy and fuel prices. According to their policy, the resulting revenues should be allocated to social security spending.

==Popular support==
===National Council and Council of States===
On the national level, in 2003 the Green Party was not represented in the Council of States or Federal Council. In 2007, two Green Party members were elected to the Council of States.

By 2005, the party held 3.8 per cent of the seats in the Swiss cantonal executive governments and 6.9 per cent in the Swiss cantonal parliaments (index &quot;BADAC&quot;, weighted with the population and number of seats). In 2007, the Green Party was represented in the governments of the cantons Bern, Basel-City, Geneva (two ministers), Neuchâtel, Nidwalden, Vaud, Zug (two ministers) and Zurich.

<doc id="345756" wikidata="Q20459" url="?curid=345756" title="Lighter">
<text>A lighter is a portable device which uses mechanical or electrical means to create a controlled flame, and can be used to ignite a variety of flammable items, such as cigarettes, butane gas, fireworks, candles, or campfires. A lighter typically consists of a metal or plastic container filled with a flammable liquid, a compressed flammable gas, or in rarer cases a flammable solid (e.g. rope in a trench lighter); a means of ignition to produce the flame; and some provision for extinguishing the flame or else controlling it to such a degree that users may extinguish it with their breath. Alternatively, a lighter can be one that uses electricity to create an electric arc using the created plasma as the source of ignition or a heating element can be used in a similar vein to heat the target to its ignition temperatures, as first formally used by Friedrich Wilhelm Schindler to light cigars and now more commonly seen incorporated into the automobile auxiliary power outlet to ignite the target material. Different lighter fuels have different characteristics, which is the main influence behind the creation and purchasing of a variety of lighter types.

==History==
The first lighters were converted flintlock pistols that used gunpowder. In 1662, Turkish traveler Evliya Çelebi visited Vienna as a member of an Ottoman diplomatic mission, and admired the lighters being manufactured there: &quot;Enclosed in a kind of tiny box are tinder, a steel, sulphur, and resinous wood. When struck just like a firearm wheel, the wood bursts into flame. This is useful for soldiers on campaign.&quot; One of the first lighters was invented by a German chemist named Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner in 1823, and was often called Döbereiner&#x27;s lamp. This lighter worked by passing flammable hydrogen gas, produced within the lighter by a chemical reaction, over a platinum metal catalyst, which in turn caused it to ignite and give off a great amount of heat and light.

The development of ferrocerium (often misidentified as flint) by Carl Auer von Welsbach in 1903 has made modern lighters possible. When scratched, it produces a large spark that is responsible for lighting the fuel of many lighters, and is suitably inexpensive for use in disposable items.

Using Carl Auer von Welsbach&#x27;s flint, companies such as Ronson were able to develop practical and easy-to-use lighters. In 1910, Ronson released the first Pist-O-Liter, and in 1913, the company developed its first lighter, called the &quot;Wonderlite&quot;, which was a permanent match-style of lighter.

During WWI, soldiers started to create lighters out of empty cartridge cases. During that time, one of the soldiers came up with a means to insert a chimney cap with holes in it to make it more windproof.

The Zippo lighter and company were invented and founded by George Grant Blaisdell in 1932. The Zippo was noted for its reliability, &quot;Life Time Warranty&quot; and marketing as &quot;Wind-Proof&quot;. Most early Zippos used naphtha as a fuel source.

In the 1950s, a switch occurred in the fuel of choice from naphtha to butane, as butane allows for a controllable flame and has less odour. This also led to the use of piezoelectric spark, which replaced the need for a flint wheel in some lighters and was used in many Ronson lighters.

Around the end of the 20th century, most of the world&#x27;s lighters were produced in France, the United States, China, and Thailand.

==Operation==

Earlier lighters mostly burned &quot;lighter fluid&quot;, naphtha, saturating a cloth wick and fibre packing to absorb the fluid and prevent it from leaking. The wick is covered by an enclosed top to prevent the volatile liquid from evaporating, which is opened to operate the lighter, and extinguishes the flame when closed after use.

Later lighters use liquefied butane gas as fuel, with a valved orifice that allows gas to escape at a controlled rate when the lighter is used.
Older lighters were usually ignited by a spark created by striking metal against a lighter flint. Later, piezo ignition was introduced; a piezoelectric crystal is compressed on pressing a button, generating an electric spark. In naphtha lighters, the liquid is sufficiently volatile, and flammable vapour is present as soon as the top of the lighter is opened. Butane lighters combine the striking action with the opening of the valve to release gas. The spark ignites the flammable gas, causing a flame to come out of the lighter that continues until either the top is closed (naphtha type) or the valve is released (butane type).

A metal enclosure with air holes, designed to allow mixing of fuel and air while making the lighter less sensitive to wind, usually surrounds the flame. The gas jet in butane lighters mixes air and gas using Bernoulli&#x27;s principle, requiring air holes in that are much smaller and further from the flame.

Specialized &quot;windproof&quot; butane lighters are manufactured for demanding conditions, such as shipboard, high altitude, and wet climates. Some dedicated models double as synthetic rope cutters. Such lighters are often far hotter than normal lighters (those that use a &quot;soft flame&quot;) and can burn in excess of . The windproof capabilities are not achieved from higher-pressure fuel; windproof lighters use the same fuel (butane) as standard lighters, so develop the same vapour pressure. Instead, windproof lighters mix the fuel with air and pass the butane–air mixture through a catalytic coil. An electric spark starts the initial flame, and soon the coil is hot enough to cause the fuel–air mixture to burn on contact.

==Other types==

=== Jet lighter ===
As opposed to lighters of the naphtha or standard butane type (whether refillable or disposable), which combust incompletely and thus create a sooty, orange &quot;safety&quot; flame, jet lighters produce a blue flame that in some cases is almost invisible and invariably burns at a far higher temperature. The spark in such lighters is almost always produced by an electric arc (as seen below), but some jet lighters burn with incomplete combustion. Disadvantages of the jet lighter include a &quot;roaring&quot; noise in operation and higher fuel consumption.

=== Electric arc lighter ===
Arc lighters use a spark to create a plasma conduit between electrodes, which is then maintained by a lower voltage. The arc is then applied to a flammable substance to cause ignition.

=== Automobile lighter ===
Some vehicles are equipped with an electric lighter located on the dashboard or in the well between the front seats. Its electric heating element becomes hot in seconds upon activation.

=== Match lighter ===
Not to be confused with the meaning of &quot;match&quot; as in matchsticks or the &quot;permanent match&quot; (see below), this type of lighter consists of a length of slow match in a holder, with means to ignite and to extinguish the match. While the glowing match does not generally supply enough energy to start a fire without further kindling, it is fully sufficient to light a cigarette. The main advantage of this design shows itself in windy conditions, where the glow of the match is fanned by the wind instead of being blown out.

=== Permanent match ===
A typical form of lighter is the permanent match or everlasting match, consisting of a naphtha fuel-filled metal shell and a separate threaded-metal rod assembly—the &quot;match&quot;—serving as the striker and wick. This &quot;metal match&quot; is stored screwed into the fuel storage compartment - the shell.

The fuel-saturated striker/wick assembly is unscrewed to remove, and scratched against a flint on the side of the case to create a spark. Its concealed wick catches fire, resembling a match. The flame is extinguished by blowing it out before screwing the &quot;match&quot; back into the shell, where it absorbs fuel for the next use. An advantage over other naphtha lighters is that the fuel compartment is sealed shut with a rubber o-ring, which slows or stops fuel evaporation.

=== Flameless lighter ===

A flameless lighter is a safe alternative to traditional lighters. It uses an enclosed heating element, which glows, so that the device does not produce an open flame. Typical flameless heating elements are an electrically heated wire or an artificial coal.

Flameless lighters are designed for use in any environment where an open flame, conventional lighters, or matches are not permitted. The flameless lighter is used in many environments such as prisons and detention facilities, oil and gas facilities, mental-health facilities, nursing homes, airports, and night clubs/restaurants.

Many advertised so-called flameless lighters are not flameless at all, but the flame is invisible (such as a windproof lighter). If a piece of paper can easily be ignited, it is probably not a true flameless lighter and may not be safe in hazardous environments where smoking is confined to specific safe areas.

The flameless lighter was invented by brothers Douglas Hammond and David Hammond in the UK in 1966 under the &quot;Ciglow&quot; name.

=== Catalytic lighter ===
Catalytic lighters use methanol or methylated spirits as fuel and a thin platinum wire that heats up in the presence of flammable vapours and produces a flame.

=== Solar lighter ===
A solar lighter is a pocket-sized stainless steel parabolic mirror, shaped to concentrate sunlight on a small prong holding combustible material at the focal point. A revival of an old gadget marketed as a cigarette lighter by RadioShack in the 1980s, it is a useful hiking and camping accessory as its functioning is not affected by having been soaked by rain or falling in rivers or the sea. To operate, it needs sunlight and a small piece of flammable material. Once a glowing spark has been achieved, careful blowing can produce a blaze.

==ISO Standards==
The International Standard EN ISO 9994:2002 and the European standard EN 13869:2002 are two primary references.

The ISO establishes nonfunctional specifications on quality, reliability, and safety of lighters, and appropriate test procedures. For instance, a lighter should generate flame only through positive action on the part of the user, two or more independent actions by the user, or an actuating force greater than or equal to 15 Newtons. The standard also specifies other safety features, such as the lighter&#x27;s maximum flame height and its resistance to elevated temperatures, dropping, and damages from continuous burning. However, the standard does not include child-resistance specifications.

The European standard EN 13869:2002 establishes child-resistance specifications and defines as novelty lighters those that resemble another object commonly recognized as appealing to children younger than 51 months, or those that have entertaining audio or animated effects.

As matches, lighters, and other heat sources are the leading causes of fire deaths for children, many jurisdictions, such as the EU, have prohibited the marketing of novelty or non-child-resistant lighters. Examples of child-resistance features include the use of a smooth or shielded spark wheel. Many people remove these features, making the lighter easier to ignite.

In 2005, the fourth edition of the ISO standard was released (ISO9994:2005). The main change to the 2004 Standard is the inclusion of specifications on safety symbols.

<doc id="345757" wikidata="Q177549" url="?curid=345757" title="Krak des Chevaliers">
<text>Krak des Chevaliers (; , ; or , ; from , ) is a medieval castle in Syria and one of the most important preserved medieval castles in the world. The site was first inhabited in the 11th century by Kurdish troops garrisoned there by the Mirdasids. In 1142 it was given by Raymond II, Count of Tripoli, to the order of the Knights Hospitaller. It remained occupied by them until it was reconquered by the Muslims in 1271.

The Hospitallers began rebuilding the castle in the 1140s and were finished by 1170 when an earthquake damaged the castle. The order controlled castles along the border of the County of Tripoli, a state founded after the First Crusade. Krak des Chevaliers was among the most important and acted as a center of administration as well as a military base. After a second phase of building was undertaken in the 13th century, Krak des Chevaliers became a concentric castle. This phase created the outer wall and gave the castle its current appearance. The first half of the century has been described as Krak des Chevaliers&#x27; &quot;golden age&quot;. At its peak, Krak des Chevaliers housed a garrison of around 2,000. Such a large garrison allowed the Hospitallers to exact tribute from a wide area. From the 1250s the fortunes of the Knights Hospitaller took a turn for the worse and in 1271 the Mamluk Sultanate captured Krak des Chevaliers after a siege lasting 36 days, supposedly by way of a forged letter purportedly from the Hospitallers&#x27; Grand Master that caused the knights to surrender.

Renewed interest in Crusader castles in the 19th century led to the investigation of Krak des Chevaliers, and architectural plans were drawn up. In the late 19th or early 20th century a settlement had been created within the castle, causing damage to its fabric. The 500 inhabitants were moved in 1933 and the castle was given over to the French Alawite State, which carried out a program of clearing and restoration. When Syria declared independence in 1946, it assumed control.

Today, the village of al-Husn exists around the castle and has a population of nearly 9,000. Krak des Chevaliers is approximately west of the city of Homs, close to the border of Lebanon, and is administratively part of the Homs Governorate. Since 2006, the castles of Krak des Chevaliers and Qal&#x27;at Salah El-Din have been recognised by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites. It was partially damaged in the Syrian civil war from shelling and recaptured by the Syrian government forces in 2014. Since then, reconstruction and conservation work on the site had begun. Reports by UNESCO and the Syrian government on the state of the site are produced yearly.

==Etymology==
&quot;Krak&quot; is derived from &quot;karak&quot;, the Syriac word for a walled city or fortress. Before the arrival of the crusaders, the local Arab ruler had established a fortification on the site manned by Kurds, giving it the name, in Arabic, of &quot;Ḥoṣn al-Akrād&quot; (), or &quot;fort of the Kurds&quot;. Following the construction of the present castle, the crusaders (whose elite spoke either Old French or, in Tripoli, possibly Old Occitan) corrupted that name into and then, as a result of confusing it with &quot;karak&quot;, the name evolved into .

Because of its association with the Knights Hospitallers, it was known as &quot;Crac de l&#x27;Ospital&quot; (Fortress of the Hospital) during the Middle Ages. The name was later romanticised to become Krak des Chevaliers in French in the 19th century, meaning &quot;Fortress of the Knights&quot;.

==Location==

The castle sits atop a hill east of Tartus, Syria, in the Homs Gap. On the other side of the gap, away, was the 12th-century castle of Gibelacar (Hisn Ibn Akkar). The route through the strategically important Homs Gap connects the cities of Tripoli and Homs. To the north of the castle lies the Syrian Coastal Mountain Range, and to the south, Lebanon. The surrounding area is fertile, benefiting from streams and abundant rainfall. Compared to the Kingdom of Jerusalem, the other Crusader states had less land suitable for farming; however, the limestone peaks of Tripoli were well-suited to defensive sites.

Property in the County of Tripoli, granted to the Knights in the 1140s, included the Krak des Chevaliers, the towns of Rafanea and Montferrand, and the Beqa&#x27;a plain separating Homs and Tripoli. Homs was never under Crusader control, so the region around the Krak des Chevaliers was vulnerable to expeditions from the city. While its proximity caused the Knights problems with regard to defending their territory, it also meant Homs was close enough for them to raid. Because of the castle&#x27;s command of the plain, it became the Knights&#x27; most important base in the area.

==History==

===Origins and Crusader period===
According to the 13th-century Arab historian Ibn Shaddad, in 1031, the Mirdasid emir of Aleppo and Homs, Shibl ad-Dawla Nasr, established a settlement of Kurdish tribesmen at the site of the castle, which was then known as &quot;Ḥiṣn al-Safḥ&quot;. Nasr restored Hisn al-Safh to help reestablish the Mirdasids&#x27; access to the coast of Tripoli after they lost nearby Hisn Ibn Akkar to the Fatimids in 1029. Due to Nasr&#x27;s garrisoning of Kurdish troops at the site, the castle became known as &quot;Ḥiṣn al-Akrād&quot; (Fortress of the Kurds). The castle was strategically located at the southern edge of the Jibal al-Alawiyin mountain range and dominated the road between Homs and Tripoli. When building castles, engineers often chose elevated sites, such as hills and mountains, that provided natural obstacles.

In January 1099, on the journey to Jerusalem during the First Crusade, the company of Raymond IV of Toulouse came under attack from the garrison of Hisn al-Akrad, the forerunner of the Krak, who harried Raymond&#x27;s foragers. The following day, Raymond marched on the castle and found it deserted. The crusaders briefly occupied the castle in February of the same year but abandoned it when they continued their march towards Jerusalem. Permanent occupation began in 1110 when Tancred, Prince of Galilee took control of the site. The early castle was substantially different from the extant remains, and no trace of this first castle survives at the site.

The origins of the order of the Knights Hospitaller are unclear, but it probably emerged around the 1070s in Jerusalem. It started as a religious order that cared for the sick, and later looked after pilgrims to the Holy Land. After the success of the First Crusade in capturing Jerusalem in 1099, many Crusaders donated their new property in the Levant to the Hospital of St John. Early donations were in the newly formed Kingdom of Jerusalem, but over time the order extended its holdings to the Crusader states of the County of Tripoli and the Principality of Antioch. Evidence suggests that in the 1130s, the order became militarised when Fulk, King of Jerusalem, granted the newly built castle at Beth Gibelin to the order in 1136. A papal bull from between 1139 and 1143 may indicate the order hiring people to defend pilgrims. There were also other military orders, such as the Knights Templar, that offered protection to pilgrims.
Between 1142 and 1144 Raymond II, Count of Tripoli, granted property in the county to the order. According to historian Jonathan Riley-Smith, the Hospitallers effectively established a &quot;palatinate&quot; within Tripoli. The property included castles with which the Hospitallers were expected to defend Tripoli. Along with Krak des Chevaliers, the Hospitallers were given four other castles along the borders of the state, which allowed the order to dominate the area. The order&#x27;s agreement with Raymond II stated that if he did not accompany knights of the order on campaign, the spoils belonged entirely to the order, and if he was present it was split equally between the count and the order. Further, Raymond II could not make peace with the Muslims without the permission of the Hospitallers. The Hospitallers made Krak des Chevaliers a center of administration for their new property, undertaking work at the castle that would make it one of the most elaborate Crusader fortifications in the Levant.

After acquiring the site in 1142, they began building a new castle to replace the former Kurdish fortification. This work lasted until 1170, when an earthquake damaged the castle. An Arab source mentions that the quake destroyed the castle&#x27;s chapel, which was replaced by the present chapel. In 1163, the Crusaders emerged victorious over Nur ad-Din in the Battle of al-Buqaia near Krak des Chevaliers.

Drought conditions between 1175 and 1180 prompted the Crusaders to sign a two-year truce with the Muslims, but without Tripoli included in the terms. During the 1180s, raids by Christians and Muslims into each other&#x27;s territory became more frequent. In 1180, Saladin ventured into the County of Tripoli, ravaging the area. Unwilling to meet him in open battle, the Crusaders retreated to the relative safety of their fortifications. Without capturing the castles, Saladin could not secure control of the area, and once he retreated the Hospitallers were able to revitalise their damaged lands. The Battle of Hattin in 1187 was a disastrous defeat for the Crusaders: Guy of Lusignan, King of Jerusalem, was captured, as was the True Cross, a relic discovered during the First Crusade. Afterwards, Saladin ordered the execution of the captured Templar and Hospitaller knights, such was the importance of the two orders in defending the Crusader states. After the battle, the Hospitaller castles of Belmont, Belvoir, and Bethgibelin fell to Muslim armies. Following these losses, the Order focused its attention on its castles in Tripoli. In May 1188, Saladin led an army to attack Krak des Chevaliers, but on seeing the castle, decided it was too well defended and instead marched on the Hospitaller castle of Margat, which he also failed to capture.

Another earthquake struck in 1202, and it may have been after this event that the castle was remodelled. The 13th-century work was the last period of building at Krak des Chevaliers and gave it its current appearance. An enclosing stone circuit was built between 1142 and 1170; the earlier structure became the castle&#x27;s inner court or ward. If there was a circuit of walls surrounding the inner court that pre-dated the current outer walls, no trace of it has been discovered.

The first half of the 13th century has been characterised as Krak des Chevaliers&#x27; &quot;golden age&quot;. While other Crusader strongholds came under threat, Krak des Chevaliers and its garrison of 2,000 soldiers dominated the surrounding area. It was effectively the center of a principality which remained in Crusader hands until 1271, and was the only major inland area to remain constantly under Crusader control during this period. Crusaders who passed through the area would often stop at the castle, and probably made donations. King Andrew II of Hungary visited in 1218 and proclaimed the castle the &quot;key of the Christian lands&quot;. He was so impressed with the castle that he gave a yearly income of 60 marks to the Master and 40 to the brothers. Geoffroy de Joinville, uncle of the noted chronicler of the Crusades Jean de Joinville, died at Krak des Chevaliers in 1203 or 1204 and was buried in the castle&#x27;s chapel.

The main contemporary accounts relating to Krak des Chevaliers are of Muslim origin and tend to emphasise Muslim success while overlooking setbacks against the Crusaders, although they suggest that the Knights Hospitaller forced the settlements of Hama and Homs to pay tribute to the Order. This situation lasted as long as Saladin&#x27;s successors warred between themselves. The proximity of Krak des Chevaliers to Muslim territories allowed it to take on an offensive role, acting as a base from which neighboring areas could be attacked. By 1203, the garrison was making raids on Montferrand (which was under Muslim control) and Hama, and in 1207 and 1208 the castle&#x27;s soldiers took part in an attack on Homs. Krak des Chevaliers acted as a base for expeditions to Hama in 1230 and 1233 after the amir refused to pay tribute. The former was unsuccessful, but the 1233 expedition was a show of force that demonstrated the importance of Krak des Chevaliers.

In the 1250s, the fortunes of the Hospitallers at Krak des Chevaliers took a turn for the worse. A Muslim army estimated to number 10,000 men ravaged the countryside around the castle in 1252, after which the Order&#x27;s finances declined sharply. In 1268, Master Hugues Revel complained that the area, previously home to around 10,000 people, now stood deserted and that the Order&#x27;s property in the Kingdom of Jerusalem produced little income. He also noted that by this point there were only 300 of the Order&#x27;s brethren left in the east. On the Muslim side, in 1260 Baibars became Sultan of Egypt, following his overthrow of the incumbent ruler Qutuz, and went on to unite Egypt and Syria. As a result, Muslim settlements that had previously paid tribute to the Hospitallers at Krak des Chevaliers no longer felt intimidated into doing so.

As for Hugues Revel, some of the castellans of this castle are identified: Pierre de Mirmande (Grand Commander) and Geoffroy le Rat (Grand Master).

Baibars ventured into the area around Krak des Chevaliers in 1270 and allowed his men to graze their animals on the fields around the castle. When he received news that year of the Eighth Crusade led by King Louis IX of France, Baibars left for Cairo to avoid a confrontation. After Louis died in 1271, Baibars returned to deal with Krak des Chevaliers. Before he marched on the castle, the Sultan captured the smaller castles in the area, including Chastel Blanc. On 3 March, Baibars&#x27; army arrived at Krak des Chevaliers. By the time the Sultan appeared on the scene, the castle may already have been blockaded by Mamluk forces for several days. Of the three Arabic accounts of the siege, only one was contemporary, that of Ibn Shaddad, who was not present at the siege. Peasants who lived in the area had fled to the castle for safety and were kept in the outer ward. As soon as Baibars arrived, he erected mangonels, powerful siege weapons which he would later turn on the castle. In a probable reference to a walled suburb outside the castle&#x27;s entrance, Ibn Shaddad records that two days later the first line of defences fell to the besiegers.

Rain interrupted the siege, but on 21 March, immediately south of Krak des Chevaliers, Baibar&#x27;s forces captured a triangular outwork possibly defended by a timber palisade. On 29 March, the attackers undermined a tower in the southwest corner, causing it to collapse whereupon Baibars&#x27; army attacked through the breach. In the outer ward, they encountered the peasants who had sought refuge in the castle. Though the outer ward had fallen, with a handful of the garrison killed in the process, the Crusaders retreated to the more formidable inner ward. After a lull of ten days, the besiegers conveyed a letter to the garrison, supposedly from the Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller in Tripoli, which granted permission, (&quot;aman&quot;), for them to surrender on 8 April 1271. Although the letter was a forgery, the garrison capitulated and the Sultan spared their lives. The new owners of the castle undertook repairs, focused mainly on the outer ward. The Hospitaller chapel was converted to a mosque and two &quot;mihrabs&quot; (prayer niches) were added to the interior.

===Later history===
During the Ottoman period (1516–1918), the castle housed a company of local janissaries and was the centre of the &quot;nahiye&quot; (tax district) of Hisn al-Akrad, attached first to the Tripoli Sanjak and later Homs, both part of the Tripoli Eyalet. The castle itself was commanded by a &quot;dizdar&quot; (castle warden). Several Turkmen and Kurdish tribes were settled in the area, and in the 18th century the district was mainly controlled by local notables from the Dandashi family. In 1894, the Ottoman government considered stationing a company of auxiliary soldiers there, but revised its plans after deciding the castle was too old and access too difficult. As a result, the capital of the district was then moved to nearby Talkalakh.

After the Franks were driven from the Holy Land in 1291, European familiarity with the castles of the Crusades declined. It was not until the 19th century that interest in these buildings was renewed, so there are no detailed plans from before 1837. Emmanuel Guillaume-Rey was the first European researcher to scientifically study Crusader castles in the Holy Land. In 1871, he published the work &quot;Etudes sur les monuments de l&#x27;architecture militaire des Croisés en Syrie et dans l&#x27;ile de Chypre&quot;; which included plans and drawings of the major Crusader castles in Syria, including Krak des Chevaliers. In some instances his drawings were inaccurate, however for Krak des Chavaliers they record features which have since been lost.

Paul Deschamps visited the castle in February 1927. Since Rey had visited in the 19th century, a village of 500 people had been established within the castle. Renewed inhabitation had damaged the site: underground vaults had been used as rubbish tips and in some places the battlements had been destroyed. Deschamps and fellow architect François Anus attempted to clear some of the detritus; General Maurice Gamelin assigned 60 Alawite soldiers to help. Deschamps left in March 1927, and work resumed when he returned two years later. The culmination of Deschamp&#x27;s work at the castle was the publication of &quot;Les Châteaux des Croisés en Terre Sainte I: le Crac des Chevaliers&quot; in 1934, with detailed plans by Anus. The survey has been widely praised, described as &quot;brilliant and exhaustive&quot; by military historian D. J. Cathcart King in 1949 and &quot;perhaps the finest account of the archaeology and history of a single medieval castle ever written&quot; by historian Hugh Kennedy in 1994.

As early as 1929, there were suggestions that the castle should be taken under French control. On 16 November 1933, Krak des Chevaliers was given into the control of the French state, and cared for by the Académie des Beaux-Arts. The villagers were moved and paid F1 million between them in compensation. Over the following two years, a programme of cleaning and restoration was carried out by a force of 120 workers. Once finished, Krak des Chevaliers was one of the key tourist attractions in the French Levant. Pierre Coupel, who had undertaken similar work at the Tower of the Lions and the two castles at Sidon, supervised the work. Despite the restoration, no archaeological excavations were carried out. The Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon, which had been established in 1920, ended in 1946 with the declaration of Syrian independence. The castle was made a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, along with Qal&#x27;at Salah El-Din, in 2006, and is owned by the Syrian government.

Several of the castle&#x27;s former residents built their houses outside the fortress and a village called al-Husn has since developed. Many of the al-Husn&#x27;s roughly 9,000 Muslims residents benefit economically from the tourism generated by the site.

The Syrian Civil War began in 2011, prompting UNESCO to raise concerns that the war might damage cultural sites including Krak des Chevaliers. The castle was shelled in August 2012 by the Syrian Arab Army, damaging the Crusader chapel. It was damaged again in July 2013 by an airstrike conducted by the Syrian Arab Air Force during the Siege of Homs, and once more on 18 August 2013. The Syrian Arab Army captured the castle and village after the Battle of Hosn in March 2014. Since then, UNESCO has published periodic reports about the state of the site, reconstruction and conservation measures.

==Architecture==
Writing in the early 20th century, T. E. Lawrence, popularly known as Lawrence of Arabia, remarked that Krak des Chevaliers was &quot;perhaps the best preserved and most wholly admirable castle in the world, [a castle which] forms a fitting commentary on any account of the Crusading buildings of Syria&quot;. Castles in Europe provided lordly accommodation for their owners and were centers of administration; in the Levant the need for defence was paramount and was reflected in castle design. Kennedy suggests that &quot;The castle scientifically designed as a fighting machine surely reached its apogee in great buildings like Margat and Crac des Chevaliers.&quot;
Krak des Chevaliers can be classified both as a spur castle, due to its site, and after the 13th-century expansion a fully developed concentric castle. It was similar in size and layout to Vadum Jacob, a Crusader castle built in the late 1170s. Margat has also been cited as Krak des Chevaliers&#x27; sister castle. The main building material at Krak des Chevaliers was limestone; the ashlar facing is so fine that the mortar is barely noticeable. Outside the castle&#x27;s entrance was a &quot;walled suburb&quot; known as a &quot;burgus&quot;, no trace of which remains. To the south of the outer ward was a triangular outwork and the Crusaders may have intended to build stone walls and towers around it. It is unknown how it was defended at the time of the 1271 siege, though it has been suggested it was surrounded by a timber palisade. South of the castle, the spur on which it stands is connected to the next hill, so that siege engines can approach on level ground. The inner defences are strongest at this point, with a cluster of towers connected by a thick wall.

===Inner ward===
Between 1142 and 1170, the Knights Hospitaller undertook a building programme on the site. The castle was defended by a stone curtain wall studded with square towers which projected slightly. The main entrance was between two towers on the eastern side, and there was a postern gate in the northwest tower. At the center was a courtyard surrounded by vaulted chambers. The lay of the land dictated the castle&#x27;s irregular shape. A site with natural defences was a typical location for Crusader castles and steep slopes provided Krak des Chevaliers with defences on all sides bar one, where the castle&#x27;s defences were concentrated. This phase of building was incorporated into the later castle&#x27;s construction.
When Krak des Chevaliers was remodelled in the 13th century, new walls surrounding the inner court were built. They followed the earlier walls, with a narrow gap between them in the west and south, which was turned into a gallery from which defenders could unleash missiles. In this area, the walls were supported by a steeply sloping glacis which provided additional protection against both siege weapons and earthquakes. Four large, round towers project vertically from the glacis; they were used as accommodation for the Knights of the garrison, about 60 at its peak. The southwest tower was designed to house the rooms of the Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller. Though the defences which once crested the walls of the inner wards no longer survive in most places, it seems that they did not extend for the entire circuit. Machicolations were absent from the southern face. The area between the inner court and the outer walls was narrow and not used for accommodation. In the east, where the defences were weakest, there was an open cistern filled by an aqueduct. It acted both as a moat and water supply for the castle.

At the north end of the small courtyard is a chapel and at the southern end is an esplanade. The esplanade is raised above the rest of the courtyard; the vaulted area beneath it would have provided storage and could have acted as stabling and shelter from missiles. Lining the west of the courtyard is the hall of the Knights. Though probably first built in the 12th century, the interior dates from the 13th-century remodelling. The tracery and delicate decoration is a sophisticated example of Gothic architecture, probably dating from the 1230s.

===Chapel===

The current chapel was probably built to replace the one destroyed by an earthquake in 1170. Only the east end of the original chapel, which housed the apse, and a small part of the south wall survive from the original chapel. The later chapel had a barrel vault and an uncomplicated apse; its design would have been considered outmoded by contemporary standards in France, but bears similarities to that built around 1186 at Margat. It was divided into three roughly equal bays. A cornice runs round the chapel at the point where the vault ends and the wall begins. Oriented roughly east to west, it was long and wide with the main entrance from the west and a second smaller one in the north wall. When the castle was remodelled in the early 13th century, the entrance was moved to the south wall. The chapel was lit by windows above the cornice, one at the west end, one on either side of the east bay, and one on the south side of the central bay, and the apse at the east end had a large window. In 1935, a second chapel was discovered outside the castle&#x27;s main entrance, however it no longer survives.

===Outer ward===

The second phase of building work undertaken by the Hospitallers began in the early 13th century and lasted decades. The outer walls were built in the last major construction on the site, lending the Krak des Chevaliers its current appearance. Standing high, the outer circuit had towers that projected strongly from the wall. While the towers of the inner court had a square plan and did not project far beyond the wall, the towers of the 13th-century outer walls were rounded. This design was new and even contemporary Templar castles did not have rounded towers. The technique was developed at Château Gaillard in France by Richard the Lionheart between 1196 and 1198. The extension to the southeast is of lesser quality than the rest of the circuit and was built at an unknown date. Probably around the 1250s, a postern was added to the north wall.

Arrow slits in the walls and towers were distributed to minimise the amount of dead ground around the castle. Machicolations crowned the walls, offering defenders a way to hurl projectiles towards enemies at the foot of the wall. They were so cramped, archers would have had to crouch inside them. The box machicolations were unusual: those at Krak des Chevaliers were more complex that those at Saône or Margat, and there were no comparable features amongst Crusader castles. However, they bore similarities to Muslim work, such as the contemporary defences at the Citadel of Aleppo. It is unclear which side imitated the other, as the date they were added to Krak des Chevaliers is unknown, but it does provide evidence for the diffusion of military ideas between the Muslim and Christian armies. These defences were accessed by a wall-walk known as a chemin de ronde. In the opinion of historian Hugh Kennedy, the defences of the outer wall were &quot;the most elaborate and developed anywhere in the Latin east ... the whole structure is a brilliantly designed and superbly built fighting machine&quot;.

When the outer walls were built in the 13th century the main entrance was enhanced. A vaulted corridor led uphill from the outer gate in the northeast. The corridor made a hairpin turn halfway along its length, making it an example of a bent entrance. Bent entrances were a Byzantine innovation, but that at Krak des Chevaliers was a particularly complex example. It extended for , and along its length were murder-holes which allowed defenders to shower attackers with missiles. Anyone going straight ahead rather than following the hairpin turn would emerge in the area between the castle&#x27;s two circuits of walls. To access the inner ward, the passage had to be followed round.

===Frescoes===

Despite its predominantly military character, the castle is one of the few sites where Crusader art (in the form of frescoes) has been preserved. In 1935, 1955, and 1978, medieval frescoes were discovered within Krak des Chevaliers after later plaster and white-wash had decayed. The frescos were painted on the interior and exterior of the main chapel and the chapel outside the main entrance, which no longer survives. Writing in 1982, historian Jaroslav Folda noted that at the time there had been little investigation of Crusader frescoes that would provide a comparison for the fragmentary remains found at Krak des Chevaliers. Those in the chapel were painted on the masonry from the 1170–1202 rebuild. Mold, smoke, and moisture have made it difficult to preserve the frescoes. The fragmentary nature of the red and blue frescoes inside the chapel makes them difficult to assess. The one on the exterior of the chapel depicted the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple.

<text>The solar constant (GSC) measures the amount of energy received by a given area one astronomical unit away from the Sun. More specifically, it is a flux density measuring mean solar electromagnetic radiation (total solar irradiance) per unit area. It is measured on a surface perpendicular to the rays, one astronomical unit (au) from the Sun (roughly the distance from the Sun to the Earth).

The solar constant includes radiation over the entire electromagnetic spectrum. It is measured by satellite as being 1.361 kilowatts per square meter (kW/m2) at solar minimum (the time in the 11-year solar cycle when the number of sunspots is minimal) and approximately 0.1% greater (roughly 1.362 kW/m2) at solar maximum.

The solar &quot;constant&quot; is not a physical constant in the modern CODATA scientific sense; that is, it is not like the Planck constant or the speed of light which are absolutely constant in physics. The solar constant is an average of a varying value. In the past 400 years it has varied less than 0.2 percent. Billions of years ago, it was significantly lower.

This constant is used in the calculation of radiation pressure, which aids in the calculation of a force on a solar sail.

==Calculation==

Solar irradiance is measured by satellites above Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, and is then adjusted using the inverse square law to infer the magnitude of solar irradiance at one Astronomical Unit (au) to evaluate the solar constant. The approximate average value cited, 1.3608 ± 0.0005  kW/m2, which is 81.65 kJ/m2 per minute, is equivalent to approximately 1.951 calories per minute per square centimeter, or 1.951 langleys per minute.

Solar output is nearly, but not quite, constant. Variations in total solar irradiance (TSI) were small and difficult to detect accurately with technology available before the satellite era (±2% in 1954). Total solar output is now measured as varying (over the last three 11-year sunspot cycles) by approximately 0.1%; see solar variation for details.

===For extrasolar planets===
formula_1 &lt;br&gt;
formula_2 &lt;br&gt;
Therefore: formula_3 &lt;br&gt;
formula_4 &lt;br&gt;
Where formula_5 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant (formula_6) and f is the irradiance of the star at the extrasolar planet at distance d.

==Historical measurements==
In 1838, Claude Pouillet made the first estimate of the solar constant. Using a very simple pyrheliometer he developed, he obtained a value of 1.228 kW/m2, close to the current estimate.

In 1875, Jules Violle resumed the work of Pouillet and offered a somewhat larger estimate of 1.7 kW/m2 based, in part, on a measurement that he made from Mont Blanc in France.

In 1884, Samuel Pierpont Langley attempted to estimate the solar constant from Mount Whitney in California. By taking readings at different times of day, he tried to correct for effects due to atmospheric absorption. However, the final value he proposed, 2.903 kW/m2, was much too large.

 Between 1902 and 1957, measurements by Charles Greeley Abbot and others at various high-altitude sites found values between 1.322 and 1.465 kW/m2. Abbot showed that one of Langley&#x27;s corrections was erroneously applied. Abbot&#x27;s results varied between 1.89 and 2.22 calories (1.318 to 1.548  kW/m2), a variation that appeared to be due to the Sun and not the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.

In 1954 the solar constant was evaluated as 2.00 cal/min/cm2 ± 2%. Current results are about 2.5 percent lower.

==Relationship to other measurements==

===Solar irradiance===
The actual direct solar irradiance at the top of the atmosphere fluctuates by about 6.9% during a year (from 1.412 kW/m2 in early January to 1.321 kW/m2 in early July) due to the Earth&#x27;s varying distance from the Sun, and typically by much less than 0.1% from day to day. Thus, for the whole Earth (which has a cross section of 127,400,000 km2), the power is 1.730×1017 W (or 173,000 terawatts), plus or minus 3.5% (half the approximately 6.9% annual range). The solar constant does not remain constant over long periods of time (see Solar variation), but over a year the solar constant varies much less than the solar irradiance measured at the top of the atmosphere. This is because the solar constant is evaluated at a fixed distance of 1 Astronomical Unit (au) while the solar irradiance will be affected by the eccentricity of the Earth&#x27;s orbit. Its distance to the Sun varies annually between 147.1·106 km at perihelion and 152.1·106 km at aphelion. In addition, several long term (tens to hundreds of millennia) cycles of subtle variation in the Earth&#x27;s orbit (Milankovich cycles) affect the solar irradiance and insolation (but not the solar constant).

The Earth receives a total amount of radiation determined by its cross section (π·RE2), but as it rotates this energy is distributed across the entire surface area (4·π·RE2). Hence the average incoming solar radiation, taking into account the angle at which the rays strike and that at any one moment half the planet does not receive any solar radiation, is one-fourth the solar constant (approximately 340 W/m2). The amount reaching the Earth&#x27;s surface (as insolation) is further reduced by atmospheric attenuation, which varies. At any given moment, the amount of solar radiation received at a location on the Earth&#x27;s surface depends on the state of the atmosphere, the location&#x27;s latitude, and the time of day.

===Apparent magnitude===

The solar constant includes all wavelengths of solar electromagnetic radiation, not just the visible light (see Electromagnetic spectrum). It is positively correlated with the apparent magnitude of the Sun which is −26.8. The solar constant and the magnitude of the Sun are two methods of describing the apparent brightness of the Sun, though the magnitude is based on the Sun&#x27;s visual output only.

===The Sun&#x27;s total radiation===
The angular diameter of the Earth as seen from the Sun is approximately 1/11,700 radians (about 18 arcseconds), meaning the solid angle of the Earth as seen from the Sun is approximately 1/175,000,000 of a steradian. Thus the Sun emits about 2.2 billion times the amount of radiation that is caught by Earth, in other words about 3.846×1026 watts.

==Past variations in solar irradiance==
Space-based observations of solar irradiance started in 1978. These measurements show that the solar constant is not constant. It varies with the 11-year sunspot solar cycle.
When going further back in time, one has to rely on irradiance reconstructions, using sunspots for the past 400 years or cosmogenic radionuclides for going back 10,000 years.
Such reconstructions show that solar irradiance varies with distinct periodicities. These cycles are: 11 years (Schwabe), 88 years (Gleisberg cycle), 208 years (DeVries cycle) and 1,000 years (Eddy cycle).

Over billions of years, the Sun is gradually expanding, and emitting more energy from the resultant larger surface area. The unsolved question of how to account for the clear geological evidence of liquid water on the Earth billions of years ago, at a time when the sun&#x27;s luminosity was only 70% of its current value, is known as the faint young Sun paradox.

==Variations due to atmospheric conditions==
At most about 75% of the solar energy actually reaches the earth&#x27;s surface, as even with a cloudless sky it is partially reflected and absorbed by the atmosphere. Even light cirrus clouds reduce this to 50%, stronger cirrus clouds to 40%. Thus the solar energy arriving at the surface with the sun directly overhead can vary from 550 W/m2 with cirrus clouds to 1025 W/m2 with a clear sky.

For her performance she was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Performance.

<text>Gustav Ludwig Hertz (; ; 22 July 1887 – 30 October 1975) was a German physicist who shared the 1925 Nobel Prize in Physics with James Franck &quot;for their discovery of the laws governing the impact of an electron upon an atom&quot;.

==Biography==
Hertz was born in Hamburg, the son of Auguste (née Arning) and a lawyer, Gustav Theodor Hertz (1858–1904), Heinrich Rudolf Hertz&#x27;s brother. He attended the Gelehrtenschule des Johanneums before studying at the Georg-August University of Göttingen (1906–1907), the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (1907–1908), and the Humboldt University of Berlin (1908–1911). He received his doctorate in 1911 under Heinrich Leopold Rubens.

From 1911 to 1914, Hertz was an assistant to Rubens at the University of Berlin. It was during this time that Hertz and James Franck performed experiments on inelastic electron collisions in gases, known as the Franck–Hertz experiments, and for which they received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1925.

During World War I, Hertz served in the military from 1914. In 1915 he joined Fritz Haber&#x27;s unit that would introduce poisonous chlorine gas as a weapon. He was seriously wounded in 1915. In 1917, he returned to the University of Berlin as a Privatdozent. In 1920, he took a job as a research physicist at the Philips Incandescent Lamp Factory in Eindhoven, which he held until 1925.

===Career===
In 1925, Hertz became ordinarius professor and director of the Physics Institute of the Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg. In 1928 he became ordinarius professor of experimental physics and director of the Physics Institute of the &quot;Technische Hochschule Berlin&quot; (&quot;THB&quot;), now Technische Universität Berlin. While there, he developed an isotope separation technique via gaseous diffusion. Since Hertz was an officer during World War I, he was temporarily protected from National Socialist policies and the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, but eventually the policies and laws became more stringent, and at the end of 1934, he was forced to resign his position at THB, as he was classified as a &quot;second degree part-Jew&quot; (his paternal grandfather Gustav Ferdinand Hertz (originally named David Gustav Hertz) (1827–1914) had been Jewish as a child, before his whole family had converted to Lutheranism in 1834). He then took a position at Siemens, as director of Research Laboratory II. While there, he continued his work on atomic physics and ultrasound, but he eventually discontinued his work on isotope separation. He held this position until he departed for the Soviet Union in 1945.

===In the Soviet Union===

====&quot;Pact to defect&quot;====
Hertz was concerned for his safety and, like his fellow Nobel laureate James Franck, was looking to move to the US or any other place outside Germany. So he made a pact with three colleagues: Manfred von Ardenne, director of his private laboratory &quot;Forschungslaboratorium für Elektronenphysik&quot;, Peter Adolf Thiessen, ordinarius professor at the Humboldt University of Berlin and director of the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institut für physikalische Chemie und Elektrochemie (KWIPC) in Berlin-Dahlem, and Max Volmer, ordinarius professor and director of the Physical Chemistry Institute at the THB. The pact was a pledge that whoever first made contact with the Soviets would speak for the rest. The objectives of their pact were threefold: (1) prevent plunder of their institutes, (2) continue their work with minimal interruption, and (3) protect themselves from prosecution for any political acts of the past. Before the end of World War II, Thiessen, a member of the Nazi Party, had Communist contacts.

====Participation in Soviet program of nuclear weapons====
On 27 April 1945, Thiessen arrived at von Ardenne&#x27;s institute in an armored vehicle with a major of the Soviet Army, who was also a leading Soviet chemist. All four of the pact members were taken to the Soviet Union. Hertz was made head of Institute G, in Agudseri (Agudzery), about 10 km southeast of Sukhumi and a suburb of Gul&#x27;rips (Gulrip&#x27;shi). Topics assigned to Gustav Hertz&#x27;s Institute G included:
(1) Separation of isotopes by diffusion in a flow of inert gases, for which Gustav Hertz was the leader,
(2) Development of a condensation pump, for which Justus Mühlenpfordt was the leader,
(3) Design and build a mass spectrometer for determining the isotopic composition of uranium, for which Werner Schütze was the leader,
(4) Development of frameless (ceramic) diffusion partitions for filters, for which Reinhold Reichmann was the leader, and
(5) Development of a theory of stability and control of a diffusion cascade, for which Heinz Barwich was the leader;

Barwich had been deputy to Hertz at Siemens. Other members of Institute G were Werner Hartmann and Karl-Franz Zühlke. Manfred von Ardenne was made head of Institute A. Goals of von Ardenne&#x27;s Institute A included: (1) Electromagnetic separation of isotopes, for which von Ardenne was the leader, (2) Techniques for manufacturing porous barriers for isotope separation, for which Peter Adolf Thiessen was the leader, and (3) Molecular techniques for separation of uranium isotopes, for which Max Steenbeck was the leader.

In his first meeting with Lavrentij Beria, von Ardenne was asked to participate in building the bomb, but von Ardenne quickly realized that participation would prohibit his repatriation to Germany, so he suggested isotope enrichment as an objective, which was agreed to.

====Research at Sukhumi====
By the end of the 1940s, nearly 300 Germans were working at the institute, and they were not the total work force. Institute A was used as the basis for the Sukhumi Physical-Technical Institute in Sinop, a suburb of Sukhumi. Volmer went to the Scientific Research Institute No. 9 (NII-9) in Moscow; he was given a design bureau to work on the production of heavy water. In Institute A, Thiessen became leader for developing techniques for manufacturing porous barriers for isotope separation.

In 1949, six German scientists, including Hertz, Thiessen, and Barwich were called in for consultation at Sverdlovsk-44, which was responsible for uranium enrichment. The plant, smaller than the American Oak Ridge gaseous diffusion plant, was getting only a little over half of the expected 90% or higher enrichment.

After 1950, Hertz moved to Moscow. In 1951, Hertz was awarded a Stalin Prize, second class, with Barwich. In that year, James Franck and Hertz were jointly awarded the Max Planck Medal by the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft. Hertz remained in the Soviet Union until 1955.

====Return to the GDR====
Upon return from the Soviet Union, Hertz became ordinarius professor at the University of Leipzig. From 1955 to 1967, he was also the chairman of the Physical Society of the Deutsche Demokratische Republik (GDR); he was honorary chairman from 1967 to 1975.

===Personal life===
Gustav Hertz was a nephew of Heinrich Rudolf Hertz and a cousin of Mathilde Carmen Hertz. In 1919, Hertz married Ellen née Dihlmann, who died in 1941. They had two sons, Carl Helmut Hertz and Johannes Heinrich Hertz; both became physicists.

He died on 30 October 1975 in East Berlin at the age 88.

==Scientific memberships==
Hertz was a Member of the German Academy of Sciences in Berlin, Corresponding Member of the Göttingen Academy of Sciences, an Honorary Member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, a Member of the Czechoslovakian Academy of Sciences, and a Foreign Member of the USSR Academy of Sciences.
