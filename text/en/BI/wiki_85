<text>[[Boxing]] in the 1980s was filled with important fights, events and personalities that shaped the sport. Boxing in the 1980s was shaped by many different situations, such as the continuous corporate battles between the different world sanctioning organizations, the void left by Muhammad Ali as the sport&#x27;s ambassador and consequent search for a new boxing hero, the continuous presence of Don King as the sport&#x27;s most famous promoter, the surge of rival promoters as Bob Arum, Butch Lewis and Murad Muhammad, and major rule changes. In 1986, Mike Tyson emerged as a fresh new face in the heavyweight division, which had seen a decline in champion quality level (particularly in the WBA side) after Ali&#x27;s retirement and, later on, after longtime WBC ruler Larry Holmes&#x27; prime. In addition, the IBF and WBO began operating.

Another important aspect of boxing in the 1980s was the rivalry between five world champions: Wilfred Benítez, Roberto Durán, Marvin Hagler, Thomas Hearns and Sugar Ray Leonard. Of all the possible match-ups between these five, Benitez-Hagler was the only one that never happened. The circle of fights between these five gladiators actually began on November 30, 1979, when Leonard beat Benitez by knockout in round fifteen to win the WBC world Welterweight title, on the same night Hagler drew (tied) with Vito Antuofermo in his first bid to become the world&#x27;s middleweight champion.

<text>Baie-Mahault (; ) is a commune in the overseas department and region of Guadeloupe, France. It is the second most populated commune of Guadeloupe, after Les Abymes. The extensive industrial zone of Jarry in Baie-Mahault is by far the most industrialized commune in the islands and the largest industrial park in the Lesser Antilles. It is part of the urban area of Pointe-à-Pitre, the largest metropolitan area in Guadeloupe, located in the northwest.

The inhabitants of Baie-Mahault are called Baie-Mahaultiens.

==History==
Baie-Mahault may be named for a variety of mangrove called &quot;mahault&quot; or &quot;mahot&quot; common in this area.

On 29 November 1808, during the Napoleonic Wars, boats from HMS &quot;Heureux&quot; attacked French vessels in the harbour and the batteries protecting them. The captain of &quot;Heureux&quot; was killed and one of his men was wounded. The British succeeded in destroying the guns of one of the two batteries, and in capturing a schooner.

In 1843 there was a severe earthquake. In October 1865, a cholera epidemic flared up. In Guadeloupe, from October 1865 to June 1866, 12,000 inhabitants perished. Mahault Bay was the first and worst hit by the epidemic.

In 1910, the Darboussier Factory was constructed. In 1918, the TSF radio station was built. An electric generating plant was built in 1934 which supplied Guadeloupe. The 1928 Okeechobee hurricane destroyed much of the town. The church and the presbytery were rebuilt in 1933. The Gabarre bridge and the industrial and commercial park of Jarry, the largest in Guadeloupe, were built. In 2001, Ary Chalus became mayor.

==Geography==
Baie-Mahault (&quot;Mangrove Bay&quot;) is located in the borough called Canton and it extends a vast plain of northeastern Basse-Terre Island, where it meets Grande-Terre. A channel, navigable by smaller boats, of from 30 to 100 yards across, called &quot;Riviere Salee&quot; or &quot;Salt River&quot; separates the two islands. The Baie-Mahault area sets in marshlands and marine cul-de-sacs. The town prospered through fertile arable lands used to grow sugar cane. The mangrove swamps are a few miles east at the Salt River. Baie-Mahault is northwest of the city of Pointe-à-Pitre and west of Pointe-à-Pitre International Airport.

==Climate==
Baie-Mahault experiences a good amount of rainfall during the year, with a wetter season between July and November which coincides with hurricane season. The town receives 1500 2000 mm of rainfall. Tropical heat brings constant highs of around 32 °C (89 °F) that drop to 20 °C (68 °F) at night. Trade winds, called &quot;alizés&quot;, blow from the northeast and often temper the climate. The hurricane season occurs from June to November.
==Population==

==Economy==
The town is surrounded by one major crop: sugarcane. A sugar factory is southwest of Baie-Mahault. Cane cutters cut cane and sometimes transport it by ox-cart. Southwards, are some banana and pineapple plantations. As the town sits on two bays, there is no surprise that there is a fishing port. Basse-Terre grows more crops than Grande-Terre, but has fewer people and most of them are in the primary sector.

The artisanal, commercial, and industrial park of Jarry, with more than 3,500 companies is among the very largest industrial parks of France. It accommodates the Port authority of Guadeloupe, the Complex World Trade Center (logistical center of the CCI of Pointe-à-Pitre), the oil terminals of the SARA (Société Anonyme de la Raffinerie des Antilles), and two power plants. The industrial and commercial park of Jarry-Moudong is regarded as the economic lung of the Guadeloupe with employment of more than 10,000. Jarry is ideally located between Pointe-à-Pitre International Airport and the port, and also accommodates a free zone the EEC intended for the operations of international trade for its warehouses.

==Sights==
There are two hotels: Hotel-o-Matic in Jarry, and Villa Baie Mahault within walking distance of Baie-Mahault.

At the end of the borough, below the town hall, a landing at the edge of the lagoon, is the starting point of tours of the bay.

The shopping center of Carrefour, in Destrellan is located in Baie-Mahault, sells French imports, such as cologne, perfumes, clothing, food, etc. It is the busiest and largest supermarket zone anywhere in the Lesser Antilles, an average of between 5000 and 10,000 shoppers per day.

The main sport arena is a single velodrome, the Vélodrome Amédée Détraux, in Gourde-Liane, near Destrellan, and a stadium called Fiesque Duchesne. Artists that have performed there include Ray Charles, George Benson, Diam&#x27;s, Al Jarreau, James Brown and Lionel Richie.

The industrial park of Jarry has an oil terminal, two electrical and thermal power stations for the many industrial and commercial businesses, and a logistic center for the CCI.

A sandy beach near Mahault Bay is protected by coral reefs.

On Pointe Double, you can see a lighthouse and a weather station.

A lepers&#x27; house, was operated by the &quot;Soeurs de la Charite&quot; until 1954.

<text>Bouillante (; ) is a &quot;commune&quot; in the French overseas region and department of Guadeloupe, in the Lesser Antilles.

==History==
Bouillante was founded about 1635 with the arrival of some of Guadeloupe&#x27;s first colonists. It was originally named &quot;Islets à Goyaves&quot; (&quot;Islet of Guavas&quot;) until the beginning of the 18th century, when the name was changed to &quot;Fontaines Bouillantes&quot; after the island&#x27;s hot springs that were known for their therapeutic virtues.

With the end of the Ancien Régime, the civil authorities and religious leaders renamed the city &quot;Bouillante&quot;. Saint Louis, the religious character, is the patron saint of the commune.

Bouillante knew its apogee during the 17th century. It occupied an important place on the island through the policy of the Kingdom of France. The king wanted to make Guadeloupe a colony of settlement based on the family small-scale farming and the introduction of volunteers. The latter, from France, were regarded as the first European inhabitants of the Caribbean. They learned the rudiments of tropical agriculture, different from their area of origin. The Amerindians were marginalized following the integral report/ratio of the two practical ones and they did not follow all the same route. The two enumerations, that of 1664 and that of 1671, reveal the destiny of the different groups.

After 1960, the commune knew major upheavals with the departure of a great number of young people for the cities.

==Geography==
Bouillante is located in the middle of the leeward coast, on the western coast of Basse-Terre Island. It lies between the communes of Pointe-Noire to the north, Vieux-Habitants to the south, and Petit-Bourg to the east. To the east, there is a large mountainous chain. Crossing the commune along its north–south axis is the national forest. The high point of this forest is the Piton of Bouillante. The city is north of Basse-Terre, the administrative capital, and from Pointe-à-Pitre, the commercial city.

The commune lies on steep volcanic slopes which descend abruptly to the sea. Its fertile volcanic soil allowed the growing of coffee, which was regarded as one of the best coffee in the world. Cotton, banana, and vanilla also greatly contributed to its economic success for many years.

Today, the economy of the commune is centered on tourism. Agriculture, fishing, the craft industry and geothermics still play a large part in the local economy.

Bouillante profits from its many coves and bays dotting the coast, and beaches such as &quot;Anse à la Barque&quot;, &quot;Petite Anse&quot;, &quot;Anse à sable&quot; and Malendure with its famous coral barrier which lodges the prestigious Réserve Cousteau. The beaches are largely open but are sheltered from the sometimes violent winds.

<text>Deshaies (; ) is a commune in the French overseas region and department of Guadeloupe, in the Lesser Antilles. It is on the northwest coast of Basse-Terre Island.

The inhabitants are called &quot;Deshaisiens&quot;.

==History==
Deshaies, and its littoral zone of the Large Cape, preserve the vestiges of the primitive vegetation of Guadeloupe at the time of Christopher Columbus&#x27;s arrival on November 4, 1493. The deepest bay of all the Caribbean coast and best naturally protected, it was used as shelter to the adventurers of pirates and other corsairs, and there is said to be treasure on the island.

In 1635, colonists landed at Allègre point, at the north end of the island. This part of the coast is very damp; Deshaies is an integral part of a wooded territory extending from Pointe Noire to Baie-Mahault.

On the site of the current borough was the plantation of Potherie, one of the greatest fortunes of the island in 1686. Ten years later, in 1696, the sugar plantations fell victim to the English corsairs.

The geographical configuration makes traveling to the district difficult, so inhabitants formed their own community, including their own militia. The borough was given two cannons on April 1, 1730, and established as a community by the will of the governor in 1732. The church was consecrated on June 29, 1733, and dedicated to Saint Pierre and Saint Paul. Deshaies was disorganized economically by Victor Hugues&#x27; conquest and the abolition of slavery. The majority of her inhabitants had taken up arms for the revolution, but the island remained in the hands of the royalists.

The 19th-century Napoleonic era was not good for Deshaies because it was the zone in which a Caribbean empire developed. Its distance from the chief town (Basse-Terre) made Deshaies vulnerable despite its strategic position. After the naval battle in the bay between French and British on September 5, 1803, the borough and the coastal properties of the vicinity were devastated by the British. The war combined with malaria, which was endemic in the area, made people disinclined to live there.

Thirty years later, four years after the abolition of slavery, there remained only one sugar plantation, Guyonneau, belonging to the Caillou family.

The commune in 1852 saw periods of tensions. The opposition between Caillou and the black farmers of his plantation, who were supported by the priest of the parish, Lettre, became the working class struggle against the wealthy classes, and of the religious authority against the administrative authority.

The government of the colony, the Minister for the Navy and the Colonies, feared Deshaies would not support him and maintained correspondence with his superiors. Once law and order had been returned, the ministry ordered the deportation of the priest. The ministry created a police station squad maintained by the governor in 1877, despite the refusal of the Council General. Between the time slavery was abolished and the Second World War, lack of education remained the principal obstacle to the development of this community. Appointment to the civil or religious administration of Deshaies was regarded as a disgrace to the person so appointed. Deshaies remained insulated and marginalized. There has been a road connecting the chief towns of the leeward shore since 1922, but it ended in Pointe Noire, the commune bordering Deshaies. The road was extended to Deshaies only in 1957.

The current mayor is Jeanny Marc.

==Geography==
Deshaies is located on the leeward northwest coast of Basse-Terre Island and is secluded in a bay, where two headlands stick out. Deshaies&#x27; coordinates are 16° 18 &#x27; N &amp; 61° 48 &#x27;W. The mountain range is east while the Caribbean Sea is west.
It includes Kahouanne, an uninhabited islet of 1,500 metres from the coast. It is about in area and is a protected site.

===Climate===
Like any other Eastern Caribbean town, Deshaies experiences quite evenly spread rainfall during the year, with a wetter season between July and November which coincides with hurricane season. The town receives 1500–2500 mm (60–100 in) of rainfall. Tropical heat is the norm, bringing constant highs of around 32 °C (89 °F) that drop to 20 °C (68 °F) at night.

Trade winds, called &quot;alizés&quot;, blow from the northeast and often temper the climate.

==Population==
==Economy==
Mixed crops are grown such as vanilla, sugar, coffee, cocoa and bananas. Fishing is an important industry where different types of fish can be bought at the mini-market.

Tourism is booming and hotels and restaurants are located nearby. There is a craft industry where wooden souvenirs can be purchased in shops. Aggregate extraction is done.

Since 2011, Deshaies, and many of its businesses, have become the main filming location of the TV series &quot;Death in Paradise&quot;.

==Education==
Public primary schools include:
* Ecole primaire Beaujour Agénor
* Ecole primaire Audelon Bethsy
* Ecole primaire Ferry
* Ecole primaire Riflet

Public junior high schools include:
* Collège Félix Aladin Flemin

==Tourism and sights==
Deshaies was the first village of Club Med intended for exclusively American customers (currently the Langley Resort Hotel Fort Royal Guadeloupe). This resort is the only hotel on the island of Basse Terre which is directly located on the beach.

The late French comedian Coluche&#x27;s house, which dominated bay of Deshaies, has been transformed into botanical park. Robert Charlebois (Québécois singer) had his house towards Grand-Anse beach, the largest beach of Guadeloupe.

The music video for &quot;Parti pour zouker&quot; by the French artist Lorie was shot on a beach of Deshaies.
French singer Barone shot a video on the beach at Hotel Fort Royal in 2014.

Deshaies has become well known because, as the fictional town of Honoré, it is the setting of the British-French crime comedy-drama television series &quot;Death in Paradise&quot;.

<text>Open society () is a term coined by French philosopher Henri Bergson in 1932, and describes a dynamic system inclined to moral universalism. Bergson contrasted an open society with what he called a closed society, a closed system of law, morality or religion. Bergson suggests that if all traces of civilization were to disappear, the instincts of the closed society for including or excluding others would remain.

The idea of an open society was further developed during World War II by the Austrian-born British philosopher Karl Popper. Popper saw it as part of a historical continuum reaching from the organic, tribal, or closed society, through the open society (marked by a critical attitude to tradition) to the abstract or depersonalized society lacking all face-to-face interaction transactions.

==History==
Popper saw the classical Greeks as initiating the slow transition from tribalism towards the open society, and as facing for the first time the strain imposed by the less personal group relations entailed thereby.

Whereas tribalistic and collectivist societies do not distinguish between natural laws and social customs, so that individuals are unlikely to challenge traditions they believe to have a sacred or magical basis, the beginnings of an open society are marked by a distinction between natural and man-made law, and an increase in personal responsibility and accountability for moral choices (not incompatible with religious belief).

Popper argued that the ideas of individuality, criticism, and humanitarianism cannot be suppressed once people have become aware of them, and therefore that it is impossible to return to the closed society, but at the same time recognized the continuing emotional pull of what he called &quot;the lost group spirit of tribalism&quot;, as manifested for example in the totalitarianisms of the 20th century.

While the period since Popper&#x27;s study has undoubtedly been marked by the spread of the open society, this may be attributed less to Popper&#x27;s advocacy and more to the role of the economic advances of late modernity. Growth-based industrial societies require literacy, anonymity and social mobility from their members — elements incompatible with much tradition-based behavior but demanding the ever-wider spread of the abstract social relations Georg Simmel saw as characterizing the metropolitan mental stance.

==Definition==
Karl Popper defined the open society as one &quot;in which an individual is confronted with personal decisions&quot; as opposed to a &quot;magical or tribal or collectivist society.&quot;

He considered that only democracy provides an institutional mechanism for reform and leadership change without the need for bloodshed, revolution or coup d&#x27;état.

==Critical knowledge==
Popper&#x27;s concept of the open society is epistemological rather than political. When Popper wrote &quot;The Open Society and Its Enemies&quot;, he believed that the social sciences had failed to grasp the significance and the nature of fascism and communism because these sciences were based on what he saw to be faulty epistemology. Totalitarianism forced knowledge to become political which made critical thinking impossible and led to the destruction of knowledge in totalitarian countries.

Popper&#x27;s theory that knowledge is provisional and fallible implies that society must be open to alternative points of view. An open society is associated with cultural and religious pluralism; it is always open to improvement because knowledge is never completed but always ongoing: &quot;if we wish to remain human, then there is only one way, the way into the open society ... into the unknown, the uncertain and insecure&quot;.

In the closed society, claims to certain knowledge and ultimate truth lead to the attempted imposition of one version of reality. Such a society is closed to freedom of thought. In contrast, in an open society each citizen needs to engage in critical thinking, which requires freedom of thought and expression and the cultural and legal institutions that can facilitate this.

==Further characteristics==
Humanitarianism, equality and political freedom are ideally fundamental characteristics of an open society. This was recognized by Pericles, a statesman of the Athenian democracy, in his laudatory funeral oration: &quot;advancement in public life falls to reputation for capacity, class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit; nor again does poverty bar the way, if a man is able to serve the state, he is not hindered by the obscurity of his condition. The freedom which we enjoy in our government extends also to our ordinary life.&quot;

Arguably however it was the tension between a traditional society and the new, more open space of the emerging &quot;polis&quot; which most fully marked classical Athens, and Popper was very aware of the continuing emotional appeal of what he called &quot;holism...longing for the lost unity of tribal life&quot; into the modern world.

== Caveats ==
Investor and philanthropist George Soros, a self-described follower of Karl Popper, argued that sophisticated use of powerful techniques of subtle deception borrowed from modern advertising and cognitive science by conservative political operatives such as Frank Luntz and Karl Rove casts doubt on Popper&#x27;s view of open society. Because the electorate&#x27;s perception of reality can easily be manipulated, democratic political discourse does not necessarily lead to a better understanding of reality. Soros argues that in addition to the need for separation of powers, free speech, and free elections, an explicit commitment to the pursuit of truth is imperative. &quot;Politicians will respect, rather than manipulate, reality only if the public cares about the truth and punishes politicians when it catches them in deliberate deception.&quot;

Popper however, did not identify the open society either with democracy or with capitalism or a &quot;laissez-faire&quot; economy, but rather with a critical frame of mind on the part of the individual, in the face of communal group think of whatever kind. An important aspect in Popper&#x27;s thinking is the notion that the truth can be lost. Critical attitude does not mean that the truth is found.

<text>FOX (forkhead box) proteins are a family of transcription factors that play important roles in regulating the expression of genes involved in cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and longevity. Many FOX proteins are important to embryonic development. FOX proteins also have pioneering transcription activity by being able to bind condensed chromatin during cell differentiation processes.

The defining feature of FOX proteins is the forkhead box, a sequence of 80 to 100 amino acids forming a motif that binds to DNA. This forkhead motif is also known as the winged helix, due to the butterfly-like appearance of the loops in the protein structure of the domain. Forkhead proteins are a subgroup of the helix-turn-helix class of proteins.

==Biological roles==

Fox genes are key elements in development and many biological processes, including regulating apoptosis. Fox genes must be under extreme evolutionary supervision in a genomic sequence or cis-acting elements. If they are not, they can lead to the development of many different types of cancer. Some of the types of cancer that it can lead to are carcinoma, breast, prostate, and acute lymphocytic leukemia. 

Many genes encoding FOX proteins have been identified. For example, the FOXF2 gene encodes forkhead box F2, one of many human homologues of the &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; transcription factor forkhead. FOXF2 is expressed in the lung and placenta.

Some FOX genes are downstream targets of the hedgehog signaling pathway, which plays a role in the development of basal cell carcinomas. Members of class O (FOXO- proteins) regulate metabolism, cellular proliferation, stress tolerance and possibly lifespan. The activity of FoxO is controlled by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, acetylation and ubiquitination.

FOX proteins act as transcription factors that regulate genes which are associated with the cell cycle. FOX proteins promote the entry of a cell into S-phase and ensures the cell undergoes mitosis properly. The activity of FOX proteins are regulated by proliferation and anti-proliferations signals.

==Discovery==
The founding member and namesake of the FOX family is the &quot;fork head&quot; transcription factor in Drosophila, discovered by German biologists Detlef Weigel and Herbert Jäckle. Since then a large number of family members have been discovered, especially in vertebrates. Originally, they were given vastly different names (such as HFH, FREAC, and fkh), but in 2000 a unified nomenclature was introduced that grouped the FOX proteins into subclasses (FOXA-FOXS) based on sequence conservation.

==Cancer==
Depending on the subfamily, the deregulation of FOX proteins is often associated with tumorigenesis and can act as a tumor suppressor or an oncogene. Changes in post-translational modifications, genetic events, or oncoviruses are known causes for this deregulation.

FOX proteins play critical roles in cellular homeostasis as they act as both tumor suppressors and oncogenes depending on the context. Dysregulation of FOX proteins may also contribute to diseases such as neurodevelopmental disorders and metabolic syndromes. For example, FOXM1 is essential for cell cycle progression and is frequently over-expressed in tumors while FOXO proteins regulate apoptosis and stress responses indicating they often act as tumor suppressors.

A member of the FOX family, FOXD2, has been detected progressively overexpressed in human-papillomavirus-positive neoplastic keratinocytes derived from uterine cervical preneoplastic lesions at different levels of malignancy. For this reason, this gene is likely to be associated with tumorigenesis and may be a potential prognostic marker for uterine cervical preneoplastic lesions progression.

<text>PRINCE2 (PRojects IN Controlled Environments) is a structured project management method and practitioner certification programme. PRINCE2 emphasises dividing projects into manageable and controllable stages.

It is adopted in many countries worldwide, including the UK, Western European countries, and Australia.
PRINCE2 training is available in many languages.

PRINCE2 was developed as a UK government standard for information systems projects. In July 2013, ownership of the rights to PRINCE2 were transferred from HM Cabinet Office to AXELOS Ltd, a joint venture by the Cabinet Office and Capita, with 49% and 51% stakes respectively. 

In 2021, PRINCE2 was transferred to PeopleCert during their acquisition of AXELOS.

==History==
PRINCE was derived from an earlier method called PROMPT II (Project Resource Organisation Management Planning Techniques). In 1989 the Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency (CCTA) adopted a version of PROMPT II as a UK Government standard for information systems (IT) project management. They gave it the name &#x27;PRINCE&#x27;, which originally stood for &quot;PROMPT II IN the CCTA Environment&quot;. PRINCE was renamed in a civil service competition as an acronym for &quot;PRojects IN Controlled Environments&quot;. PRINCE2 is the second edition of the earlier PRINCE method which was initially announced and developed in 1989 by the Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency (CCTA), a UK government support agency. PRINCE2 was released in 1996 as a generic project management method. 

Since then, PRINCE2 became increasingly popular and is now a &quot;de facto&quot; standard for project management in many UK government departments and across the United Nations system. 

There have been three major revisions of PRINCE2 since its launch in 1996: &quot;PRINCE2:2009 Refresh&quot; in 2009, and &quot;PRINCE2 2017 Update&quot; in 2017. The justification for the 2017 update was the evolution in practical business practices and feedback from PRINCE2 practitioners in the actual project environment. More recently, in 2023 AXELOS launched PRINCE2 7 - the 7th edition - which is described below.

==Overview of PRINCE2==

===Seven aspects of project performance===

These aspects are also called tolerances or performance goals. Tolerances define the delegated levels of authority which are set by a higher level of management to a lower level. The management level responsible must manage within the tolerances provided only as long as they are not forecast to be exceeded. Otherwise they are deemed to be an exception which requires escalating to the management level which delegated them. This way of managing is known as &#x27;management by exception&#x27; and is one of the principles of PRINCE2. By managing in this way, it saves the time of senior management. In some organisations tolerances can be key performance indicators (KPIs). In the following table project level tolerances are summarised:


===Seven principles (why, or guidelines to follow) ===
PRINCE2 is based on seven principles and these cannot be tailored. The PRINCE2 principles can be described as a mindset that keeps the project aligned with the PRINCE2 methodology. If a project does not adhere to these principles, it is not being managed using PRINCE2.
# Ensure continued business justification: The business case is the most important document, and is updated at every stage of the project to ensure that the project is still viable. Early termination can occur if this ceases to be the case.
# Learn from experience: Each project maintains a lessons log and projects should continually refer to their own and to previous and concurrent projects&#x27; lesson logs to avoid reinventing wheels. Unless lessons provoke change, they are only lessons identified (not learned).
# Define roles, responsibilities, and relationships: Roles are separated from individuals, who may take on multiple roles or share a role. Roles in PRINCE2 are structured in four levels (corporate or programme management, project board, project manager level and team level). Project Management Team contains the last three, where all primary stakeholders (business, user, supplier) need to be presented.
# Manage by stages: The project is planned and controlled on a stage by stage basis. Moving between stages includes updating the business case, risks, overall plan, and detailed next-stage plan in the light of new evidence.
# Manage by exception: A PRINCE2 project has defined tolerances (6 aspects above) for each project objective, to establish limits of delegated authority. If a management level forecasts that these tolerances are exceeded (e.g. time of a management stage will be longer than the estimated time in the current management stage). It is escalated to the next management level for a decision how to proceed.
# Focus on products: A PRINCE2 project focuses on the definition and delivery of the products, in particular their quality requirements.
# Tailor to suit the project: PRINCE2 is tailored to suit the project environment, size, complexity, importance, time capability and risk. Tailoring is the first activity in the process initiating a project and reviewed for each stage.
Not every aspect of PRINCE2 will be applicable to every project, thus every process has a note on scalability. This provides guidance to the project manager (and others involved in the project) as to &quot;how much&quot; of the process to apply. The positive aspect of this is that PRINCE2 can be tailored to the needs of a particular project. The negative aspect is that many of the essential elements of PRINCE2 can be omitted sometimes resulting in a PINO project – PRINCE in Name Only

===Seven PRINCE2 practices and the management products used to support each practice===

===Seven processes (who does what and when from start to finish)===
# Starting up a project, in which the project team is appointed including an executive and a project manager, and a project brief is produced. 
# Initiating a project, in which the business case is refined and project initiation documentation is assembled.
# Directing a project, in which the project board directs the project manager and oversees the project.
# Controlling a stage, in which the project manager authorises work packages to team managers, manages issues and risks, and reports progress to the project board.
# Managing product delivery, which provides an interface between the project manager and the team manager(s) by placing formal requirements on accepting, executing and delivering project work.
# Managing stage boundaries, in which the project manager prepares the information for the project board to decide whether to authorise the next stage or close the project.
# Closing a project, in which the project is the formally closed, follow-on actions are documented and assigned, lessons are learned, and benefits are evaluated.

===People in PRINCE2===
The 7th edition of PRINCE2 introduced a major new aspect to the method - the role of people. The purpose of a project is to deliver change, which will affect the people who perform business as usual (BAU) activities. How well the project delivers the change, depends on the capabilities of the project team, the strength of the relationships between them, and the people impacted by the change. For these reasons, PRINCE2 recommends that projects must incorporate change management to be able to successfully implement the change into the organization. 

==Integration with other techniques==
The management products described by PRINCE2 are only used for the &quot;high-level&quot; management of the project. Within its tasks, task managers must still decide on their own project management framework. Some suggestions given in the PRINCE2 manual are product based planning, change control, quality review technique, Kanban boards, Gantt charts, PERT charts and critical path analysis.

PRINCE2 can also be used to manage projects that use agile software development methods.

===Quality review technique===

The quality review technique ensures a project&#x27;s products are of the required standard (i.e. meet defined quality criteria). This takes place in a quality review meeting, which identifies errors in the product. The quality review meeting will not attempt to solve the problems it identifies. The meeting brings together people who have an interest in the project&#x27;s outputs (or products) and people on the project team able to address issues identified.

==History of PRINCE2 editions==
Below is a list of all the editions of PRINCE2. As of 1 January 2020, &quot;PRINCE2 2017&quot; was renamed &quot;PRINCE2 6th Edition&quot;. Also, the previous edition, &quot;PRINCE2 2009&quot; was renamed &quot;PRINCE2 5th Edition&quot;. There were no other changes except the name of the brand. The reason for the name change was to &quot;ensure the format of the name is aligned with that used by other frameworks within the project management industry&quot;. As list of all versions of PRINCE2 are printed in the cover of the PRINCE2 manual:
(*nth names added for other editions in order for context, but they were not referred to these names originally. However, they are referenced as such in the PRINCE2 manual cover page.)

==Differences between 2009 and 2017 versions of PRINCE2 Manual ==
== New aspects introduced in the 7th edition ==
== Advantages and criticisms ==
PRINCE2 provides a method for managing projects within a clearly defined framework, but project management is a complex discipline and using such a framework is no guarantee of a successful project.

Some of the advertised benefits of PRINCE2 are: increased quality of the finished products, efficient control of resources, avoidance of either &quot;heroic&quot; (under-regulated) or &quot;mechanistic&quot; (over-regulated) working, and increased confidence among the project team.

PRINCE2 is sometimes considered inappropriate for small projects or where requirements are expected to change, due to the work required in creating and maintaining documents, logs and lists. The deliverable structure may also lead to focus on producing deliverables for their own sake, to &quot;tick the boxes&quot; rather than do more useful work.

The general response of PRINCE2&#x27;s authors to criticism has been to point out that the methodology is scalable and can be tailored to suit the specific requirements and constraints of the project and the environment. This strong emphasis on tailoring has led some users to complain that PRINCE2 is unfalsifiable, i.e. it is impossible to tell whether PRINCE2 &quot;works&quot; or constitutes &quot;best practice&quot; if any problems encountered with a project can be blamed on inappropriate application of PRINCE2 rather than on PRINCE2 itself.

The experiences of the Blair administration in the UK between 1997 and 2007 (and of subsequent UK governments) arguably undermine PRINCE2&#x27;s claim to be &quot;best practice&quot;, given the string of high-profile failed IT projects charged to the taxpayer during that time, and the controversy surrounding the financial relationship between the Blair government and PRINCE2&#x27;s co-owners Capita. PRINCE2&#x27;s training material addresses these failures, blaming them on inappropriate tailoring of PRINCE2 to the project environment, and advocating for more PRINCE2 training for government project managers to solve the problem.

== Differences from PMP ==
Project Management Professional (PMP) from Project Management Institute may be seen as a competitor of PRINCE2. In general, the UK, Australia prefer PRINCE2, and the US and American countries prefer PMP. Asia, Africa and the Middle East area have no strong preference for PMP or PRINCE2.
The important thing is that PMP (PMBOK) can be used with PRINCE2.

PRINCE2 and PMP acknowledge each other&#x27;s existence in their advertising material and attempt to position themselves as complementary products – PRINCE2 as a &quot;methodology&quot; and PMP as a &quot;standard&quot; – which can be used alongside each other. In practice, companies and practitioners choose one system or both depending on the project environment, their geographical location and costs involved.

<doc id="353676" wikidata="Q170356" url="?curid=353676" title="Tadeusz Bór-Komorowski">
<text>Generał Tadeusz Komorowski (1 June 1895 – 24 August 1966), better known by the name Bór-Komorowski (after one of his wartime code-names: &quot;Bór&quot; – &quot;The Forest&quot;) was a Polish military leader. He was appointed commander in chief a day before the capitulation of the Warsaw Uprising and following World War II, 32nd Prime Minister of Poland, 3rd Polish government-in-exile in London.

==Life==
Komorowski was born in Khorobriv, in the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria (the Austrian partition of Poland). In the First World War he served as an officer in the Austro-Hungarian Army, and after the war became an officer in the Polish Army, rising to command the Grudziądz Cavalry School. He was a member of the Polish equestrian team that went to the 1924 Summer Olympics.

After taking part in the fighting against the German invasion of Poland at the beginning of World War II in 1939, Komorowski, with the code-name &quot;Bór&quot;, helped organise the Polish underground in the Kraków area. In July 1941 he became deputy commander of the Home Army (&quot;Armia Krajowa&quot; or &quot;AK&quot;), and in March 1943 gained appointment as its commander, with the rank of Brigadier-General. He was sympathetic to the right-wing, antisemitic National Party. As commander of the Home Army, Komorowski reversed the pro-Jewish policies of his predecessor, Stefan Rowecki. Komorowski opposed aid to Jews seeking to mount ghetto uprisings and favoured the exclusion of Jews from the organisation. American historian Joshua D. Zimmerman accuses Komorowski of characterising Jewish partisans as &quot;communist, pro-Soviet elements&quot; and having &quot;chilling indifference&quot; to the ongoing Holocaust.

==The Uprising==

In mid 1944, as Soviet forces advanced into central Poland, the Polish government-in-exile in London instructed Bór-Komorowski to prepare for an armed uprising in Warsaw. The government-in-exile wished to return to a capital city liberated by Poles, not seized by the Soviets, and prevent the Communist take-over of Poland which Stalin had planned. The Warsaw uprising began on Komorowski&#x27;s order on 1 August 1944 and the insurgents of the AK seized control of most of central Warsaw.

On 29 September 1944, Bór-Komorowski was promoted to General Inspector of the Armed Forces (Polish Commander-in-Chief). On 4 October, after two months of fierce fighting, Bór-Komorowski surrendered to SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski after Nazi Germany agreed to treat the Home Army fighters as prisoners-of-war. General Bór-Komorowski went into internment in Germany (at Oflag IV-C). Despite repeated demands, he refused to order the remaining Home Army units in Occupied Poland to surrender.

==Life in exile==
After the war Bór-Komorowski moved to London, where he played an active role in Polish &quot;émigré&quot; circles. From 1947 to 1949 he served as Prime Minister of the Polish government-in-exile, which no longer had diplomatic recognition from most Western European countries. He wrote the story of his experiences in &quot;The Secret Army&quot; (1950). After the war he was an upholsterer.

==Death==
He died in London on 24 August 1966, aged 71, and was buried in Gunnersbury Cemetery (also known as (New) Kensington Cemetery).

On 30 July 1994, Gen. Tadeusz Bór-Komorowski&#x27;s ashes were buried in Powązki Military Cemetery in Warsaw.

<text>King Niðhad, &quot;Níðuðr&quot;, &quot;Niðungr&quot; or &quot;Niduth&quot; was a cruel king in Germanic legend. 
He appears as Níðuðr in the Old Norse &quot;Völundarkviða&quot;, as &quot;Niðung&quot; in the &quot;Þiðrekssaga&quot;, and as &quot;Niðhad&quot; in the Anglo-Saxon poems &quot;Deor&quot; and &quot;Waldere&quot;. 

The legend of Níðuðr and Wayland also appears on the Gotlandic Ardre image stone VIII from the 8th century and possibly on the front panel of the 7th century Anglo-Saxon Franks Casket. However, Austin Simmons has recently argued that it is not Niðhad who is depicted, but his daughter Beadohilde (twice).

==&quot;Völundarkviða&quot;==
In &quot;Völundarkviða&quot;, Níðuðr appears to be a king of Närke (the Njars) and captures Völund. Níðuðr orders Völund hamstrung and imprisoned on the island of Sævarstaðir. There, Völund was forced to forge items for the king. Völund&#x27;s wife&#x27;s ring was given to the king&#x27;s daughter, Bodvild, and Níðuðr wore Völund&#x27;s sword.

For revenge, Völund killed the king&#x27;s sons when they visited him in secret, fashioned goblets from their skulls, jewels from their eyes, and a brooch from their teeth. He sent the goblets to the king, the jewels to the queen and the brooch to the kings&#x27; daughter. When Bodvild took her ring to him to be mended, he took the ring and seduced her, fathering a son and escaping on wings he made.

==&quot;Þiðrekssaga&quot;==

In the &quot;Þiðrekssaga&quot;, Niðung is the king of Jutland. 
A master smith named Velent arrived in Niðung&#x27;s kingdom, and Niðung graciously accepted Velent as a servant at his court. One day Velent had lost Niðung&#x27;s knife, but he secretly made another one for the king. When Niðung discovered that his knife cut better than it used to, he enquired about this with Velent. The smith lied and said that it was Amilias, the court smith, who had made it.

Suspicious, Niðung put the two smiths to a test. Velent would forge a sword and Amilias an armour, and then Velent was to use the sword trying to kill Amilias who would wear the armour. However, when Velent was to make the sword he discovered that his tools had disappeared. As he suspected the chieftain Regin to be the thief, Velent made a lifelike statue of Regin. Niðung understood that Velent was the master smith Velent himself, and Velent got his tools back.

Velent forged the great sword Mimung and an ordinary sword. When Velent and Amilias began to fight Velent cut Amilias so finely with Mimung that Amilias did not discover that he was cut in half until Velent asked him to shake. Then Amilias fell apart. Niðung then asked for the great sword Mimung, but Velent gave him the ordinary sword, which was a copy of Mimung.

One day during a war expedition Niðung found out that he had forgotten his magic victory stone &quot;Siegerstein&quot;. Desperately he offered his own daughter to the knight who could bring the stone to him before the next morning. Velent went back and fetched the stone, but another knight wanted to claim the stone and the princess. Velent killed the knight which greatly upset Niðung. Velent had to leave Niðung&#x27;s kingdom.
Velent later returned in disguise to Niðung&#x27;s kingdom and gave the daughter a love philter. The plan failed because the princess&#x27; magic knife showed her the danger before she had imbibed the potion. Velent then exchanged the knife for an ordinary knife of his own making, but when the princess noticed that the new knife was much better than the old one, the disguised Velent was revealed. Niðung then ordered that Velent&#x27;s knee tendons be cut as a punishment and Velent was set to work in the smithy.

Wanting revenge, Velent seduced and impregnated the princess and killed Niðung&#x27;s two sons, making table ware of their bones. Then Velent&#x27;s brother Egil arrived at the court. Niðung ordered Egil to shoot an apple from the head of his son. He readied two arrows, but succeeded with the first one. Asked by the king what the second arrow was for, he said that had he killed his son with his first arrow, he would have shot the king with the second one. This tale is directly comparable to the legends of William Tell and Palnetoke. In contrast to the treatment of the motif in &quot;Tell&quot;, however, the king does not punish Egil for his openness, but rather commends him for it. 

To help his brother, Egil shot birds and collected their feathers, of which Velent made a pair of wings. Velent tied a bladder filled with blood around his waist and flew away. Niðung commanded Egil to shoot his fleeing brother, who hit the bladder, deceiving Niðung, and so Velent got away.

==&quot;Deor&quot;==
In the poem &quot;Deor&quot; there is a stanza which refers to an Old English version of the legend of Welund and his captivity at the court of Nithad:
The third stanza of &quot;Deor&quot; is ungrammatical and obscure in meaning, but some commentators have inferred that it focuses on Niðhad.

==&quot;Waldere&quot;==
In the Old English fragment known as &quot;Waldere&quot;, Niðhad is mentioned together with Wayland and Widia in a praise of Mimmung, Waldere&#x27;s sword that Weyland had made.

==Economy==

Historically, most of the area was characterized by heavy industry since the age of industrialisation in the late 19th and early 20th century. In addition to coal, Upper Silesia also contains a number of other minable resources (methane, cadmium, lead, silver and zinc). About 70 billion tons of coal resources are available up to a depth of 1000 meters and the conditions for extraction are good.

Contrary to most other European cross-border polycentric metropolitan regions, Katowice-Ostrava has no established cross-border cooperation project, structure, or institution of metropolitan ambition.

==Transport==
===Air transport===
Two international airports – Katowice Airport and Leoš Janáček Airport Ostrava – serve the area.

===Rail transport===
High-speed rail link between Katowice and Ostrava is scheduled to be completed by the year 2030. It will cut down the travel time between the two cities to 30-35 minutes.

Regional trains are operated by Koleje Śląskie, most importantly serving Katowice, Rybnik, Racibórz, Bielsko-Biała, and Cieszyn in Poland, and the railway junction station in Bohumín near Ostrava in Czechia.

===Road transport===
Polish A1 and Czech D1 motorways connect the urban areas of Katowice, Rybnik and Ostrava. Bielsko-Biała is linked with Cieszyn/Český Těšín and Frýdek-Místek by the Polish Expressway S52 and Czech D48 motorway, while connection to Katowice urban area via Expressway S1 is in construction.

<doc id="353697" wikidata="Q14860072" url="?curid=353697" title="Sonic hedgehog protein">
<text>Sonic hedgehog protein (SHH) is a major signaling molecule of embryonic development in humans and other animals, encoded by the &quot;SHH&quot; gene. The protein is named after the video game character Sonic the Hedgehog.

This signaling molecule is key in regulating embryonic morphogenesis in all animals. SHH controls organogenesis and the organization of the central nervous system, limbs, digits and many other parts of the body. Sonic hedgehog is a morphogen that patterns the developing embryo using a concentration gradient characterized by the French flag model. This model has a non-uniform distribution of SHH molecules which governs different cell fates according to concentration. Mutations in this gene can cause holoprosencephaly, a failure of splitting in the cerebral hemispheres, as demonstrated in an experiment using SHH knock-out mice in which the forebrain midline failed to develop and instead only a single fused telencephalic vesicle resulted.

Sonic hedgehog still plays a role in differentiation, proliferation, and maintenance of adult tissues. Abnormal activation of SHH signaling in adult tissues has been implicated in various types of cancers including breast, skin, brain, liver, gallbladder and many more.

== Discovery and naming ==
The hedgehog gene (&quot;hh&quot;) was first identified in the fruit fly &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; in the classic Heidelberg screens of Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard and Eric Wieschaus, as published in 1980. These screens, which led to the researchers winning a Nobel Prize in 1995 along with developmental geneticist Edward B. Lewis, identified genes that control the segmentation pattern of the &quot;Drosophila&quot; embryos. The &quot;hh&quot; loss of function mutant phenotype causes the embryos to be covered with denticles, i.e. small pointy projections resembling the spikes of a hedgehog. Investigations aimed at finding a &quot;hedgehog&quot; equivalent in vertebrates by Philip Ingham, Andrew P. McMahon and Clifford Tabin revealed three homologous genes.

Two of these genes, &quot;desert hedgehog&quot; and &quot;Indian hedgehog&quot;, were named for species of hedgehogs, while &quot;sonic hedgehog&quot; was named after the video game character Sonic the Hedgehog. The gene was named by Robert Riddle, a postdoctoral fellow at the Tabin Lab, after his wife Betsy Wilder came home with a magazine containing an advert for the first game in the series, &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; (1991). In the zebrafish, two of the three vertebrate &quot;hh&quot; genes are duplicated: &quot;SHH a&quot; and &quot;SHH b&quot; (formerly described as &quot;tiggywinkle hedgehog&quot;, named for Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle, a character from Beatrix Potter&#x27;s books for children) and &quot;ihha&quot; and &quot;ihhb&quot; (formerly described as &quot;echidna hedgehog&quot;, named for the spiny anteater and not for the character Knuckles the Echidna in the &quot;Sonic&quot; franchise).

== Function ==
Of the &quot;hh&quot; homologues, &quot;SHH&quot; has been found to have the most critical roles in development, acting as a morphogen involved in patterning many systems—including the anterior pituitary, pallium of the brain, spinal cord, lungs, teeth and the thalamus by the &quot;zona limitans intrathalamica&quot;. In vertebrates, the development of limbs and digits depends on the secretion of sonic hedgehog by the zone of polarizing activity, located on the posterior side of the embryonic limb bud. Mutations in the human sonic hedgehog gene &quot;SHH&quot; cause holoprosencephaly type 3 HPE3, as a result of the loss of the ventral midline. The sonic hedgehog transcription pathway has also been linked to the formation of specific kinds of cancerous tumors, including the embryonic cerebellar tumor and medulloblastoma, as well as the progression of prostate cancer tumours. For SHH to be expressed in the developing embryo limbs, a morphogen called fibroblast growth factors must be secreted from the apical ectodermal ridge.

Sonic hedgehog has also been shown to act as an axonal guidance cue. It has been demonstrated that SHH attracts commissural axons at the ventral midline of the developing spinal cord. Specifically, SHH attracts retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons at low concentrations and repels them at higher concentrations. The absence (non-expression) of SHH has been shown to control the growth of nascent hind limbs in cetaceans (whales and dolphins).

The &quot;SHH&quot; gene is a member of the hedgehog gene family with five variations of DNA sequence alterations or splice variants. &quot;SHH&quot; is located on chromosome seven and initiates the production of Sonic Hedgehog protein. This protein sends short- and long-range signals to embryonic tissues to regulate development. If the &quot;SHH&quot; gene is mutated or absent, the protein Sonic Hedgehog cannot do its job properly. Sonic hedgehog contributes to cell growth, cell specification and formation, structuring and organization of the body plan. This protein functions as a vital morphogenic signaling molecule and plays an important role in the formation of many different structures in developing embryos. The &quot;SHH&quot; gene affects several major organ systems, such as the nervous system, cardiovascular system, respiratory system and musculoskeletal system. Mutations in the &quot;SHH&quot; gene can cause malformation of components of these systems, which can result in major problems in the developing embryo. The brain and eyes, for example, can be significantly impacted by mutations in this gene and cause disorders such as Microphthalmia and Holoprosencephaly. Microphthalmia is a condition that affects the eyes, which results in small, underdeveloped tissues in one or both eyes. This can lead to issues ranging from a coloboma to a single small eye to the absence of eyes altogether. Holoprosencephaly is a condition most commonly caused by a mutation of the &quot;SHH&quot; gene that causes improper separation or turn of the left and right brain and facial dysmorphia. Many systems and structures rely heavily on proper expression of the &quot;SHH&quot; gene and subsequent sonic hedgehog protein, earning it the distinction of being an essential gene to development.

=== Patterning of the central nervous system ===
The sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling molecule assumes various roles in patterning the central nervous system (CNS) during vertebrate development. One of the most characterized functions of SHH is its role in the induction of the floor plate and diverse ventral cell types within the neural tube. The notochord—a structure derived from the axial mesoderm—produces SHH, which travels extracellularly to the ventral region of the neural tube and instructs those cells to form the floor plate. Another view of floor plate induction hypothesizes that some precursor cells located in the notochord are inserted into the neural plate before its formation, later giving rise to the floor plate.

The neural tube itself is the initial groundwork of the vertebrate CNS, and the floor plate is a specialized structure, located at the ventral midpoint of the neural tube. Evidence supporting the notochord as the signaling center comes from studies in which a second notochord is implanted near a neural tube in vivo, leading to the formation of an ectopic floor plate within the neural tube.

Sonic hedgehog is the secreted protein that mediates signaling activities of the notochord and floor plate. Studies involving ectopic expression of SHH &quot;in vitro&quot; and &quot;in vivo&quot; result in floor plate induction and differentiation of motor neuron and ventral interneurons. On the other hand, mice mutants for SHH lack ventral spinal cord characteristics. &quot;In vitro&quot; blocking of SHH signaling using antibodies against it shows similar phenotypes. SHH exerts its effects in a concentration-dependent manner, so that a high concentration of SHH results in a local inhibition of cellular proliferation. This inhibition causes the floor plate to become thin compared to the lateral regions of the neural tube. Lower concentration of SHH results in cellular proliferation and induction of various ventral neural cell types. Once the floor plate is established, cells residing in this region will subsequently express SHH themselves, generating a concentration gradient within the neural tube.

Although there is no direct evidence of a SHH gradient, there is indirect evidence via the visualization of Patched (&quot;Ptc&quot;) gene expression, which encodes for the ligand binding domain of the SHH receptor throughout the ventral neural tube. &quot;In vitro&quot; studies show that incremental two- and threefold changes in SHH concentration give rise to motor neuron and different interneuronal subtypes as found in the ventral spinal cord. These incremental changes &quot;in vitro&quot; correspond to the distance of domains from the signaling tissue (notochord and floor plate) which subsequently differentiates into different neuronal subtypes as it occurs &quot;in vitro&quot;. Graded SHH signaling is suggested to be mediated through the Gli family of proteins, which are vertebrate homologues of the &quot;Drosophila&quot; zinc-finger-containing transcription factor &quot;Cubitus interruptus&quot; (&quot;Ci&quot;). &quot;Ci&quot; is a crucial mediator of hedgehog (&quot;Hh&quot;) signaling in &quot;Drosophila&quot;. In vertebrates, three different Gli proteins are present, viz. Gli1, Gli2 and Gli3, which are expressed in the neural tube. Mice mutants for Gli1 show normal spinal cord development, suggesting that it is dispensable for mediating SHH activity. However, Gli2 mutant mice show abnormalities in the ventral spinal cord, with severe defects in the floor plate and ventral-most interneurons (V3). Gli3 antagonizes SHH function in a dose-dependent manner, promoting dorsal neuronal subtypes. SHH mutant phenotypes can be rescued in a SHH/Gli3 double mutant. Gli proteins have a C-terminal activation domain and an N-terminal repressive domain.

SHH is suggested to promote the activation function of Gli2 and inhibit repressive activity of Gli3. SHH also seems to promote the activation function of Gli3, but this activity is not strong enough. The graded concentration of SHH gives rise to graded activity of Gli 2 and Gli3, which promote ventral and dorsal neuronal subtypes in the ventral spinal cord. Evidence from Gli3 and SHH/Gli3 mutants show that SHH primarily regulates the spatial restriction of progenitor domains rather than being inductive, as SHH/Gli3 mutants show intermixing of cell types.

SHH also induces other proteins with which it interacts, and these interactions can influence the sensitivity of a cell towards SHH. Hedgehog-interacting protein (HHIP) is induced by SHH, which in turn attenuates its signaling activity. Vitronectin is another protein that is induced by SHH; it acts as an obligate co-factor for SHH signaling in the neural tube.

There are five distinct progenitor domains in the ventral neural tube: V3 interneurons, motor neurons (MN), V2, V1, and V0 interneurons (in ventral to dorsal order). These different progenitor domains are established by &quot;communication&quot; between different classes of homeobox transcription factors. (See Trigeminal Nerve.) These transcription factors respond to SHH gradient concentration. Depending upon the nature of their interaction with SHH, they are classified into two groups—class I and class II—and are composed of members from the Pax, Nkx, Dbx and Irx families. Class I proteins are repressed at different thresholds of SHH delineating ventral boundaries of progenitor domains, while class II proteins are activated at different thresholds of SHH delineating the dorsal limit of domains. Selective cross-repressive interactions between class I and class II proteins give rise to five cardinal ventral neuronal subtypes.

It is important to note that SHH is not the only signaling molecule exerting an effect on the developing neural tube. Many other molecules, pathways and mechanisms are active (e.g., RA, FGF, BMP), and complex interactions between SHH and other molecules are possible. BMPs are suggested to play a critical role in determining the sensitivity of neural cell to SHH signaling. Evidence supporting this comes from studies using BMP inhibitors that ventralize the fate of the neural plate cell for a given SHH concentration. On the other hand, mutation in BMP antagonists (e.g., noggin) produces severe defects in the ventral-most characteristics of the spinal cord, followed by ectopic expression of BMP in the ventral neural tube. Interactions of SHH with Fgf and RA have not yet been studied in molecular detail.

=== Morphogenetic activity ===
The concentration- and time-dependent, cell-fate-determining activity of SHH in the ventral neural tube makes it a prime example of a morphogen. In vertebrates, SHH signaling in the ventral portion of the neural tube is most notably responsible for the induction of floor plate cells and motor neurons. SHH emanates from the notochord and ventral floor plate of the developing neural tube to create a concentration gradient that spans the dorso-ventral axis and is antagonized by an inverse Wnt gradient, which specifies the dorsal spinal cord. Higher concentrations of the SHH ligand are found in the most ventral aspects of the neural tube and notochord, while lower concentrations are found in the more dorsal regions of the neural tube. The SHH concentration gradient has been visualized in the neural tube of mice engineered to express a SHH::GFP fusion protein to show this graded distribution of SHH during the time of ventral neural tube patterning.

It is thought that the SHH gradient works to elicit multiple different cell fates by a concentration- and time-dependent mechanism that induces a variety of transcription factors in the ventral progenitor cells. Each of the ventral progenitor domains expresses a highly individualized combination of transcription factors—Nkx2.2, Olig2, Nkx6.1, Nkx6.2, Dbx1, Dbx2, Irx3, Pax6, and Pax7—that is regulated by the SHH gradient. These transcription factors are induced sequentially along the SHH concentration gradient with respect to the amount and time of exposure to SHH ligand. As each population of progenitor cells responds to the different levels of SHH protein, they begin to express a unique combination of transcription factors that leads to neuronal cell fate differentiation. This SHH-induced differential gene expression creates sharp boundaries between the discrete domains of transcription factor expression, which ultimately patterns the ventral neural tube.

The spatial and temporal aspect of the progressive induction of genes and cell fates in the ventral neural tube is illustrated by the expression domains of two of the most well-characterized transcription factors, Olig2 and Nkx2.2. Early in development, the cells at the ventral midline have only been exposed to a low concentration of SHH for a relatively short time and express the transcription factor Olig2. The expression of Olig2 rapidly expands in a dorsal direction concomitantly with the continuous dorsal extension of the SHH gradient over time. However, as the morphogenetic front of SHH ligand moves and begins to grow more concentrated, cells that are exposed to higher levels of the ligand respond by switching off Olig2 and turning on Nkx2.2, creating a sharp boundary between the cells expressing the transcription factor Nkx2.2 ventral to the cells expressing Olig2. It is in this way that each of the domains of the six progenitor cell populations are thought to be successively patterned throughout the neural tube by the SHH concentration gradient. Mutual inhibition between pairs of transcription factors expressed in neighboring domains contributes to the development of sharp boundaries; however, in some cases, inhibitory relationship has been found even between pairs of transcription factors from more distant domains. Particularly, NKX2-2 expressed in the V3 domain is reported to inhibit IRX3 expressed in V2 and more dorsal domains, although V3 and V2 are separated by a further domain termed MN.

SHH expression in the frontonasal ectodermal zone (FEZ), which is a signaling center that is responsible for the patterned development of the upper jaw, regulates craniofacial development mediating through the miR-199 family in the FEZ. Specifically, SHH-dependent signals from the brain regulate genes of the miR-199 family with downregulations of the miR-199 genes increasing SHH expression and resulting in wider faces, while upregulations of the miR-199 genes decrease SHH expression resulting in narrow faces.

=== Tooth development ===
SHH plays an important role in organogenesis and, most importantly, craniofacial development. Being that SHH is a signaling molecule, it primarily works by diffusion along a concentration gradient, affecting cells in different manners. In early tooth development, SHH is released from the primary enamel knot—a signaling center—to provide positional information in both a lateral and planar signaling pattern in tooth development and regulation of tooth cusp growth. SHH in particular is needed for growth of epithelial cervical loops, where the outer and inner epitheliums join and form a reservoir for dental stem cells. After the primary enamel knots are apoptosed, the secondary enamel knots are formed. The secondary enamel knots secrete SHH in combination with other signaling molecules to thicken the oral ectoderm and begin patterning the complex shapes of the crown of a tooth during differentiation and mineralization. In a knockout gene model, absence of SHH is indicative of holoprosencephaly. However, SHH activates downstream molecules of Gli2 and Gli3. Mutant Gli2 and Gli3 embryos have abnormal development of incisors that are arrested in early tooth development as well as small molars.

=== Lung development ===
Although SHH is most commonly associated with brain and limb digit development, it is also important in lung development. Studies using qPCR and knockouts have demonstrated that SHH contributes to embryonic lung development. The mammalian lung branching occurs in the epithelium of the developing bronchi and lungs. SHH expressed throughout the foregut endoderm (innermost of three germ layers) in the distal epithelium, where the embryonic lungs are developing. This suggests that SHH is partially responsible for the branching of the lungs. Further evidence of SHH&#x27;s role in lung branching has been seen with qPCR. SHH expression occurs in the developing lungs around embryonic day 11 and is strongly expressed in the buds of the fetal lungs but low in the developing bronchi. Mice who are deficient in SHH can develop tracheoesophageal fistula (abnormal connection of the esophagus and trachea). Additionally, a double (SHH-/- ) knockout mouse model exhibited poor lung development. The lungs of the SHH double knockout failed to undergo lobation and branching (i.e., the abnormal lungs only developed one branch, compared to an extensively branched phenotype of the wildtype).

=== Potential regenerative function ===
Sonic hedgehog may play a role in mammalian hair cell regeneration. By modulating retinoblastoma protein activity in rat cochlea, sonic hedgehog allows mature hair cells that normally cannot return to a proliferative state to divide and differentiate. Retinoblastoma proteins suppress cell growth by preventing cells from returning to the cell cycle, thereby preventing proliferation. Inhibiting the activity of Rb seems to allow cells to divide. Therefore, sonic hedgehog—identified as an important regulator of Rb—may also prove to be an important feature in regrowing hair cells after damage.

SHH is important for regulating dermal adipogenesis by hair follicle transit-amplifying cells (HF-TACs). Specifically, SHH induces dermal angiogenesis by acting directly on adipocyte precursors and promoting their proliferation through their expression of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (Pparg) gene.

== Processing ==
SHH undergoes a series of processing steps before it is secreted from the cell. Newly synthesised SHH weighs 45 kDa and is referred to as the preproprotein. As a secreted protein, it contains a short signal sequence at its N-terminus, which is recognised by the signal recognition particle during the translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the first step in protein secretion. Once translocation is complete, the signal sequence is removed by signal peptidase in the ER. There, SHH undergoes autoprocessing to generate a 20 kDa N-terminal signaling domain (SHH-N) and a 25 kDa C-terminal domain with no known signaling role. The cleavage is catalysed by a protease within the C-terminal domain. During the reaction, a cholesterol molecule is added to the C-terminus of SHH-N. Thus, the C-terminal domain acts as an intein and a cholesterol transferase. Another hydrophobic moiety, a palmitate, is added to the alpha-amine of N-terminal cysteine of SHH-N. This modification is required for efficient signaling, resulting in a 30-fold increase in potency over the non-palmitylated form and is carried out by a member of the membrane-bound O-acyltransferase family Protein-cysteine N-palmitoyltransferase HHAT.

== Robotnikinin ==
A potential inhibitor of the Hedgehog signaling pathway has been found and dubbed &quot;Robotnikinin&quot;—after Sonic the Hedgehog&#x27;s nemesis and the main antagonist of the Sonic the Hedgehog game series, Dr. Ivo &quot;Eggman&quot; Robotnik.

== Former controversy surrounding name ==
The gene has been linked to a condition known as holoprosencephaly, which can result in severe brain, skull and facial defects, causing a few clinicians and scientists to criticize the name on the grounds that it sounds too frivolous. It has been noted that mention of a mutation in a &quot;sonic hedgehog&quot; gene might not be well received in a discussion of a serious disorder with a patient or their family. This controversy has largely died down, and the name is now generally seen as a humorous relic of the time before the rise of fast, cheap complete genome sequencing and standardized nomenclature. The problem of the &quot;inappropriateness&quot; of the names of genes such as &quot;Mothers against decapentaplegic,&quot; &quot;Lunatic fringe,&quot; and &quot;Sonic hedgehog&quot; is largely avoided by using standardized abbreviations when speaking with patients and their families.

<text>Sapardi Djoko Damono (20 March 1940 – 19 July 2020) was an Indonesian poet known for lyrical poems, and who was widely regarded as the pioneer of lyrical poetry in Indonesia. He died in South Tangerang, Banten on 19 July 2020 after a long illness.

==Early life==
Sapardi attended grammar school at Sekolah Dasar Kasatriyan in his home town of Surakarta (also known as Solo), and from there he went on to junior high and high school at SMP 2 and SMA 2. He was an avid reader from an early age, and was a frequent visitor to the local libraries around Solo. His interests were broad, ranging from the works of Karl May, William Saroyan, and Pramoedya Ananta Toer, to comics by R. A. Kosasih. Eventually Sapardi, together with one of his younger siblings, began a lending library in their neighbourhood.

Sapardi began writing poetry while still in high school in Surakarta. After his graduation from high school, Sapardi moved to Yogyakarta to study at the English division of the Literature department at Gajah Mada University, and later completed his graduate studies in Indonesian literature. During this period he also became involved in radio broadcasting and the theater, as well as writing poetry. Sapardi&#x27;s literary career developed alongside his academic career.

==Career==
After graduating from UGM, Sapardi taught in a number of places, including Madiun, Solo, and Diponegoro University in Semarang, before moving to the United States for a brief period. In 1973, after his return from the US, he became a permanent faculty member in the Literature Department at the University of Indonesia. In 1989 he received his doctorate from the same university, and in 1993 became a full professor.

His first collection of poetry, &quot;DukaMu Abadi&quot; (Your Eternal Sorrow), was released in 1969. The focus of &quot;DukaMu Abadi&quot; is on the pain of the individual who questions existence, and unlike many of his literary peers of this time, Sapardi&#x27;s poetry focused more on the human condition rather than revolutionary and social ideas. In 1974, he published &quot;Mata Pisau&quot; (Knife) and &quot;Akuarium&quot; (Aquarium). These were followed by &quot;Perahu Kertas&quot; (Paper Boat) and &quot;Sihir Hujan&quot; (Rain Spell), and in 1986 he received the ASEAN-sponsored SEA-Write Award for poetry. In 1987, he was one of several prominent Indonesian figures (Goenawan Mohamad, Subagio Sastrowardoyo, Umar Kayam, and John H. McGlynn) involved in the establishment of the Lontar Foundation. To mark the foundation&#x27;s inauguration, a collection of Sapardi&#x27;s poems, entitled &quot;Suddenly the Night&quot; was released. In 1998/1999, Sapardi wrote about the social turbulence resulting from the fall of the New Order regime. This resulted in the book &quot;Ayat-ayat Api&quot; (Verses of Fire), which received some negative criticism, largely due to the angry tone of the work which differed markedly from his normal style. His best known works include &quot;Hujan Bulan Juni&quot; (A June Rain) and &quot;Berjalan ke Barat di Waktu Pagi Hari&quot; (Walking to the West in the Morning). &quot;Hujan Bulan Juni&quot;, one of his most popular works, was published in 1994. Containing 95 poems, including a selection of his poems from 1964 to 1992, the book has been described as a kind of &quot;greatest hits&quot; of Sapardi. Some of the poems included were written during a year spent at the University of Hawaiʻi in Honolulu in the early 1970s.

Sapardi has also completed a number of translations of literary works from other countries into Indonesian. These include the literary works of T. S. Eliot, Khalil Gibran and Jalaludin Rumi; his translation of Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; is considered among Indonesia&#x27;s best.

Sapardi&#x27;s poems have also formed the inspiration behind several musical compositions, most notably by Indonesian pianist Ananda Sukarlan. Several singers have also released albums using his poetry: &quot;Hujan Bulan Juni&quot; (1990), &quot;Hujan Dalam Komposisi&quot; (Rain in Composition) (1990) &quot;Gadis Kecil&quot; (Young Girl) (2006) and &quot;Becoming Dew&quot; (2007). The duo AriReda (composed of Reda Gaudiamo and Ari Malibu) also set his compositions to music. In the realm of film, &quot;Aku Ingin&quot; (I Want), composed by Ags. Arya Dipayana, has been rearranged into a soundtrack by teen pop musician Dwiki Dharmawan for Garin Nugroho&#x27;s 1991 film &quot;Cinta dalam Sepotong Roti&quot; (Love Is in a Slice of Bread).

He was a professor at the University of Indonesia. Damono&#x27;s extensive and intensive involvement in the university has borne him the unofficial title &#x27;Professor of Indonesian Poets&#x27;. He was once elected dean of the faculty. His poetry continues to enjoy wide popular appeal.

<text>The University of Indonesia (UI; ) is a public university in Depok, West Java and Salemba, Jakarta, Indonesia. It is one of the oldest tertiary-level educational institutions in Indonesia (known as the Dutch East Indies when UI was established), and is generally considered one of the most prestigious universities in Indonesia, along with the Gadjah Mada University and Bandung Institute of Technology. In the 2024 QS World Universities Ranking, UI is ranked 1st in Indonesia, 49th in Asia and 237th in the world.

== History ==

UI&#x27;s origins date back to the School of Health Sciences and Vaccines (&quot;Opleiding van eleves voor de genees-en helkunde en vaccine&quot;) on 2 January 1849 based on a decree from the Governor of the Dutch East Indies. At that time, the colonial government of the Dutch East Indies established a school to train medical assistants. Training lasted for two years, and the graduates were certified to perform basic medicine. Those graduates were awarded the title Javanese Doctor (&quot;Dokter Jawa)&quot; and were only authorised to practice within the Dutch East Indies, especially Java. The program became more comprehensive; in 1864 it was expanded to three years, and by 1875 it had reached seven years and the graduates were entitled to the degree of Medical Doctor.

The next step came in 1898, when the Dutch East Indies government established a new school to train medical doctors, named STOVIA (&quot;School tot Opleiding van Inlandsche Artsen&quot;). A school building was opened in March 1902, in a building that is now the Museum of National Awakening. The prerequisite to enter STOVIA was roughly the equivalent of a junior high school diploma. The schooling took nine years, so it was a mix between high school and university education. Education at STOVIA lasted for 9 years: 3 years at junior high school level, three years at high school level, and three years at diploma level. Many STOVIA graduates later played important roles in Indonesia&#x27;s national movement toward independence, as well in developing medical education in Indonesia.

In 1924, the colonial government decided to open a new tertiary-level educational facility, the RHS (&quot;Rechts Hogeschool&quot;), to train civilian officers and servants. The RHS would later evolve into the Faculty of Law. In 1927, STOVIA&#x27;s status was changed to that of a full tertiary-level institution and its name was changed to GHS (&quot;Geneeskundige Hogeschool&quot;). The GHS occupied the same main building and used the same teaching hospital as the current Faculty of Medicine. Many GHS alumni would later play roles in establishing the University of Indonesia.

After Indonesia gained independence, the Indonesian Institute for Higher Education (BPTRI) was established on 19 August 1945 in Jakarta. BPTRI had two faculties (then called colleges), namely the College of Medicine and the College of Law/Letters. The chairman of BPTRI was Prof dr Sarwono Prawirohardjo. The College of Medicine was officially opened on 1 October 1945. The institute produced its first 90 graduate students as medical doctors in the same year. When the Dutch colonial army occupied Jakarta in late 1945, the BPTRI moved to Klaten, Surakarta, Yogyakarta, Surabaya and Malang. In 21 June 1946, the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration (NICA) established the &quot;Nood Universiteit&quot; or Emergency University at Jakarta. In 1947, the name was changed to &quot;Universiteit van Indonesië&quot; (UVI) or &quot;Universitas Indonesia&quot;. Following the Indonesian National Revolution, the government established a state university in Jakarta in February 1950. The name was &quot;Universiteit Indonesia&quot;, comprising the BPTRI units and the former UVI, which was later changed into Universiteit Indonesia (UI).

Universiteit Indonesia officially started its activities on 2 February 1950 with its first president (now renamed to rector) Ir. R.M. Pandji Soerachman Tjokroadisoerio. The office of the President of Universiteit Indonesia was initially based in Jakarta, precisely in the Faculty of Medicine building on Jl. Salemba Raya no. 6, then moved to one of the former madat factory buildings on Jl. Salemba Raya no. 4, Jakarta. 2 February 1950 was later made the birthday of Universitas Indonesia. Initially, UI was a multi-campus university, with faculties in Jakarta (Medicine, Law, and Letters), Bogor (Agronomy and Veterinary Medicine), Bandung (Engineering, Mathematics and Natural Sciences), Surabaya (Medicine and Dentistry), and Makassar (Economics and Law). The Surabaya campus became the University of Airlangga in 1954. In the following year, the Makassar campus became the University of Hasanuddin. 

In 1955, Law No. 10 on the change of the words universiteit, universitet, and universitit was passed, so since then, Universiteit Indonesia was officially renamed Universitas Indonesia.

In 1959, the Bandung campus became the Bandung Institute of Technology. The School for Physical Education, which was also in Bandung, became part of Padjadjaran University in 1960. In 1964, the Bogor campus became the Bogor Agricultural Institute and the Faculty of Teaching and Education in Jakarta became the Institute of Teaching and Education (now the State University of Jakarta). By 1965, UI consisted of three campuses, all in Jakarta: Salemba (Medicine, Dentistry, Economics, Engineering, Science and the Graduate School), Rawamangun (Letters, Law, Social Science and Psychology) and Pegangsaan (Public Health and parts of Medicine). In 1987, several faculties from the Salemba and Rawamangun campuses moved to a newly built campus in the outskirts of Jakarta. The campus in southern Jakarta is known as the Depok campus (it is in the city of Depok).

In the year 2007–2008, Universitas Indonesia underwent substantial reform. Revenue was significantly increased from 800 billion to 1.6 trillion rupiah. The number of research publications has increased. This is also the case with the university&#x27;s endowment fund.

According to the 2008 survey of &quot;Globe Asia&quot;, UI ranked number first among the top universities in Indonesia. This report has been supported by a leading Indonesian magazine &quot;Tempo&quot;, which carried out a survey and analysis to rank universities and education in Indonesia. Universitas Indonesia has improved its research collaboration with international partners.

In August 2008, the university won the Indonesia ICT award for the smart campus with best content and application. In terms of accessibility and connectivity, Universitas Indonesia has won an award because 90% of the university&#x27;s area is covered by IT infrastructure and services with its 305 Mbit/s. connection to the Internet, and its 155 Mbit/s. connection to the Indonesia Higher Education Research Network (Inherent).

==Logo and philosophy==

The earliest form of the logo of Universitas Indonesia was created in 1952 by Sumaxtono (a.k.a. Sumartono), a student from the 1951 Art Department class, Faculty of Engineering, at the time known as the &quot;Fakulteit Teknik Universiteit Indonesia&quot;, in Bandung.

The logo is the kala-makara, a symbol of the two sources of energy in nature. Kala is the energy from above (the power of the sun), while makara represents the energy from below (the power of the Earth). The two powers are combined and stylized into a symbol that represents the function of Universitas Indonesia as a source of knowledge.

The logo of Universitas Indonesia carries the following interpretation:

* The tree, which includes the buds and the branches, represents science and its branches, implying that the buds will soon flourish and turn into new branches of science. The buds will continue to blossom as long as the main tree is alive. By this, Sumaxtono intended to state that the branches of science will continuously grow.
* Water pouring down from the makara signifies the works of science.

The logo design and the meaning it carried were presented to Srihadi (a student from the 1952 class from the same department) in 1952. Prof. KRHT H. Srihadi Soedarsono Adhikoesoemo, M.A. who created the logo of Bandung Institute of Technology, was not sure who authenticated this logo or when. He was sure, however, that it was printed on the cover of the book &quot;Universiteit Indonesia, Fakulteit Teknik, Bandung: Rentjana Untuk Tahun Peladjaran 1952-1953&quot; (Universitas Indonesia, Faculty of Engineering, Bandung: Course Plans for Academic Years 1952–1953), published by AID, Bandung, 120 pages, using the original design by Sumaxtono (without the pentagonal border). Each department / faculty has its own color scheme for the logo, for example: red for the Faculty of Law, blue for the Faculty of Engineering, blue-red for the Faculty of Computer Science, and sky blue for the Faculty of Psychology.

== Campuses ==

=== Salemba Campus ===

The Salemba campus, located in Central Jakarta, is dedicated mostly to the faculties of Medicine and Dentistry. It adjoins with Cipto Mangunkusumo National Hospital (RSCM) as well as the University Dental Hospital. It houses parts of the postgraduate program, the Faculty of Law (Master of Law Science and Law Science Doctoral Program), Faculty of Economics (Extension and Master of Management programs), the School of Environmental Science (Master of Environmental Science and Environmental Science Doctoral Program), and the Faculty of Engineering (laboratories).

=== Depok Campus ===

The Depok campus, in Depok, just south of Jakarta, was built during the mid-1980s to accommodate the modernization of the university. It is now the main campus. Most of the faculties (Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Humanities, Pharmacy, Engineering, Psychology, Humanities, Economics, Social Politics, Law, Computing, Nursing and Public Health) have been relocated here.

The Depok campus is alongside the Jakarta-Bogor commuter railway, offering students easy access to transport by rail. Students also benefit from the frequent commuter bus services connecting many parts of Jakarta to Depok.

Undergraduate teaching of the medical and dental faculties relocated to Depok in 2010.

UI has a main library with a building area of 30,000 m2 and consists of eight floors with the slogan &quot;Crystal of Knowledge&quot;. The groundbreaking ceremony was held on Monday, 1 June 2009 and the construction is targeted to be completed by December 2009. The UI library was designed with the concept of &quot;sustainable building&quot; where energy needs use renewable sources, namely solar energy, and no plastic is used. The new area is smoke-free, green and saves electricity, water and paper. The UI central library will be able to accommodate around 10,000 visitors at the same time or around 20,000 people per day and will also accommodate 3-5 million book titles. The library is also open to the public. The library is also equipped with public facilities such as souvenir shops, dining venues, places of worship, and student support facilities such as photocopying and post offices. Along with the main library, other facilities such as the Student Services Center, Student Activities Center, gymnasium, stadium, hockey field, hotel (Wisma Makara), travel agent and the dormitory are also provided within campus grounds.

Depok campus is home to six lakes which are located across the campus. The lakes are Kenanga Lake, Agathis Lake, Mahoni Lake, Puspa Lake, Ulin Lake, Salam Lake (the initials for which spell &quot;kampus&quot;, the Indonesian word for campus).

=== Sustainability ===
Universitas Indonesia maintains 75% of its area for reforestation. Over 20 kilometers of bicycle path have been created and shuttle buses are provided for the students and faculty. The bicycles and buses are to decrease the number of vehicles in the campus. The new library &quot;crystal of knowledge&quot; at Depok used a sustainable concept. Not only in green area and transportation, Universitas Indonesia has relocated nine massive African baobab trees aging over 100 years (one said to be 240 years old) to the Depok campus to prove the university commitment in going green.

UI established the GreenMetric Ranking of World Universities in 2010 to provide detailed profiles of participating universities to promote sustainable operations. UI&#x27;s GreenMetric World University Ranking shows the extent to which a university is reducing carbon emissions through efficient energy use, alternative forms of transport, greening the campus and recycling.

== Facilities==
=== Transportation ===
==== Campus bus ====
Campus buses are provided free of charge to serve the transport needs of students within the UI Depok campus. However, this bus can be utilised by local residents for free who use the campus bus as a means of transport to connect the Kukusan area with the Margonda area. Among UI residents and locals, this bus is better known as the Yellow Bus (Bikun), shortened word of &quot;Bis Kuning&quot; or &quot;yellow bus&quot;. In 2005, Universitas Indonesia had a total of 20 campus buses. They routinely serve 2 routes within the campus on Monday-Friday, 7:00 AM to 17:00. The two routes are the red route and the blue route. Usually, the red line runs clockwise around UI and blue line runs counter clockwise. A bus tracker website called Bikun Tracker, created by university students, keeps track of the movement of the buses for easy navigation. 

==== Campus bike ====
Since July 2008, Universitas Indonesia has offered a bike rental facility to students through the Yellow Bicycle Programme. For the rent, students need to show their UI student card (KTM) to the rental officer. The bike must be used on bike lanes, and it must be returned to a bike station. The return process is identical to borrowing as students must show their KTM to the guard. Though this has largely been replaced by Beam Mobility Electric bikes.

==== Others ====
The Depok campus is served by the on-campus Universitas Indonesia Station and Pondok Cina (outside the campus) stations on the KRL Commuterline rail system, while its Salemba campus is connected with Transjakarta Salemba UI bus station.

=== Health center ===
The polyclinic provides free health services for all UI students, including dentistry and orthodontics. There is also a 300-bed hospital called the RSUI (Rumah Sakit UI) or UI Hospital.

=== Sports ===
=== Student hall ===
Salemba Student Hall is one of the facilities under the management of the Students Affairs and Alumni Relationship Deputy. The building is often used for events such as seminars, meetings, etc. With a capacity of 300 people, it can be used by UI students and personnel, as well as rented for public use.&quot;&quot;

=== Library ===

The library at the Depok campus was launched on May 13, 2011. Built on a 33,000m² area, this library is considered the largest library in Southeast Asia. Designed according to a sustainable building concept, the library powers itself with solar energy. It is smoke-free, green, and economical in terms of electricity, water and paper usage. Universitas Indonesia Library has the capacity to accommodate about 20,000 visitors per day and has a collection of 1,500,000 books.

=== Dormitory ===

Universitas Indonesia has two student dormitories, one in Depok (Asrama UI) and one in Wismarini. The first dormitory is located on the Depok campus and has 480 men&#x27;s rooms and 615 women&#x27;s rooms, with each accommodating one to three persons. The Wismarini dormitory is located at Jl. Otto Iskandar no. 38 Jakarta Timur and has 72 men&#x27;s rooms and 111 women&#x27;s rooms. The Wismarini dormitory is only for students who take lectures at the Medicine or Dental faculties and any program held at Salemba campus.

Primarily dedicated for students for regular and vocation program, the maximum duration for rent in the Depok dormitory (Asrama UI) is 1 year. The facilities in this dormitory are rooms, canteen, wi-fi, campus bus and campus bike stations, an ATM, prayer area, and security. 

=== Mosque ===
==== Masjid Ukhuwah Islamiyah (MUI) ====
Casually pronounced by its abbreviation &quot;MUI&quot;. This mosque is in the Depok campus, surrounded by a natural environment and Kenanga Lake. Construction began on January 28, 1987, and it was used for the first time on September 4, 1987, for Friday prayer. There are parking lots in front of the mosque, which is also served by the campus bus.

====Masjid Arief Rahman Hakim (ARH) at Salemba====
Construction of this mosque, located in the Salemba campus, was started in 1966 based on a UI rector&#x27;s decree.

<text>Rocky Reach Dam is a run-of-the-river hydroelectric dam in the U.S. state of Washington owned and operated by Chelan County Public Utility District. It has 11 generators rated in total 1300 MW. The project is on the Columbia River in north central Washington state about upstream from the city of Wenatchee. The dam is above the mouth of the Columbia. The reservoir impounded by the dam is Lake Entiat. The project provides energy for more than 7 million people throughout the Pacific Northwest.

Rocky Reach is nationally recognized for efforts to protect the environment. A first-of-its-kind juvenile fish bypass system was completed in 2003 to help young salmon and steelhead on their way to the ocean. A major powerhouse upgrade started in 1995 includes new turbines that are more fish friendly. Improvements to turbines and generators are also designed to improve efficiency and reliability.

==Tourism ==
The project is located on the Columbia River on Highway 97A, north of Wenatchee. The visitor center shows films describing the Columbia River. The &quot;Look a Salmon in the Eye&quot; exhibit from (May–September) is a fish viewing room. The Powerhouse includes exhibits on the fourth floor. The Rocky Reach dam is near the Lincoln Rock State Park a short distance upriver. The Rocky Reach Dam was featured on an episode of Discovery Channel&#x27;s &quot;Dirty Jobs&quot;, hosted by Mike Rowe.

==History==
In 1934 the United States Army Corps of Engineers first reported on the hydroelectric potential of this site. By the 1950s, studies were carried out by the Chelan County P.U.D. for detail design of the project. The present site is about downstream of the site investigated by the Corps of Engineers, due to better conditions for foundations. A preliminary permit was issued in 1954. In 1956 construction of the powerhouse and the first seven generating units began. Four more generators were installed starting in 1969, increasing nameplate capacity to 1287 megawatts. The original project cost was US $273.1 million, financed by bonds sold by the PUD. Project costs included relocation of highways and railroad, land acquisition, and relocation of the town of Entiat. Repayment of bonds was through revenues from long-term sales contracts between Chelan County Public Utility District and local industrial and distribution customers. The facility has been re-licensed until 2052.

The powerhouse now has seven Westinghouse generators and four Allis-Chalmers generators. The turbines are adjustable-blade Kaplan type to allow for efficient production of energy at varying water levels. Water flows through each of the first seven turbines at a rate of 116 thousand gallons per second and 145 thousand gallons per second through each of the remaining four turbines.

<doc id="353714" wikidata="Q426600" url="?curid=353714" title="After the Funeral">
<text>After the Funeral is a work of detective fiction by Agatha Christie and first published in the US by Dodd, Mead and Company in March 1953 under the title of Funerals are Fatal and in UK by the Collins Crime Club on 18 May of the same year under Christie&#x27;s original title. The US edition retailed at $2.50 and the UK edition at ten shillings and sixpence (10/6).

A 1963 UK paperback issued by Fontana Books changed the title to Murder at the Gallop to tie in with the film version. The book features the author&#x27;s Belgian detective Hercule Poirot, but the &quot;Murder at the Gallop&quot; film adaptation instead featured her amateur sleuth, Miss Marple.

A wealthy man dies at home. His relatives gather after his funeral for the reading of his will, during which his sister states that he was murdered. The next day, she herself is found murdered. Poirot is called in to solve the mystery.

==Plot summary==
Following the funeral of Richard Abernethie, his family assembles at Enderby Hall for the reading of the will by his lawyer, Mr Entwhistle. His wealth is to be divided up between his surviving family: his brother Timothy Abernethie and his wife Maud; his sister Cora Lansquenet; his nephew George Crossfield; his first niece Rosamund Shane, and her husband Michael; his second niece Susan Banks, and her husband Gregory; and Helen Abernethie, the wife of his late brother Leo. 

Although Richard died of natural causes and his death was expected, Cora makes the seemingly chance but potently disruptive comment that he was murdered. The day after the funeral, she is found dead, having been violently murdered in her sleep. No motive is obvious in Inspector Morton&#x27;s investigations - while Cora&#x27;s life income reverts to the Abernethie estate, her property goes to Susan, while her companion Miss Gilchrist receives a number of the paintings she made. However, doubts soon arise about Richard&#x27;s death in the wake of her murder. Seeking help, Entwhistle contacts his friend, Hercule Poirot, to resolve the matter. Poirot contacts his old friend Mr Goby to investigate the family.

Each family member had their own reason for wanting Richard&#x27;s wealth, and thus become a suspect in the murder. On the day of the inquest, Susan visits Cora&#x27;s home to clean up her possessions for auction. She learns from Gilchrist that her aunt always painted from life, and that she collected paintings from local sales in the hopes of finding a valuable piece. The day after Cora&#x27;s funeral, art critic Alexander Guthrie arrives to look through Cora&#x27;s recent purchases as previously scheduled but finds nothing of value there. That evening, Gilchrist is poisoned with a slice of arsenic-laced wedding cake sent in the post; she survives, having only eaten a small portion. Gathering to select items from Richard&#x27;s estate before its sale, the family are joined by Poirot and Gilchrist. During discussions, Helen comments about believing there was something odd on the day of the funeral, Gilchrist makes a remark about one of the decorations in Enderby, while Susan recalls finding a painting in Cora&#x27;s possession, which she believed had been copied from a picture postcard and not painted from life, Cora&#x27;s usual style.

Early the next morning, Helen telephones Entwhistle to inform him what she had realised was odd during Richard&#x27;s funeral, but is struck savagely on the head before she can say more. Helen suffers a concussion and is taken away for her safety. As Inspector Morton prepares to ask each family member about their movements on the day of Cora&#x27;s murder, Poirot startles everyone by revealing to them that her murderer was Miss Gilchrist. She had recognised a Vermeer amongst Cora&#x27;s recent purchases that her employer had not, and knew it was her chance to rebuild her beloved tea shop that she lost in the war. She painted over the Vermeer painting with a scene of a pier from a postcard, unaware it had been destroyed in the war. Afterwards, she put a sedative in Cora&#x27;s tea so she would be asleep, while Gilchrist posed as her at the funeral. None of the family had seen Cora for more than two decades, which made her deception easier. After leaving the false suggestion that Richard had been murdered, Gilchrist killed Cora the following day so that police would believe it was connected to Richard&#x27;s death. To divert suspicion from herself, Gilchrist faked the attempt on her life.

Gilchrist had to copy Cora&#x27;s characteristic turn of her head but failed to realise one of these was wrong when she rehearsed it in front of a mirror. Helen was attacked because she eventually realised this. Furthermore, Poirot knew she had posed as Cora because she made a reference to a piece of decoration, which could only have been seen within Enderby Hall on the day of Richard&#x27;s funeral. The Vermeer was hidden by Gilchrist so Guthrie did not find it during his scheduled visit. Her claim that Cora painted the pier scene from life was countered by Susan finding a pre-war postcard of the pier in the cottage, along with Entwhistle recollecting that he smelt oil when he visited Cora&#x27;s home after her murder when he contacted Poirot for help. Poirot then reveals that two nuns visited Cora&#x27;s cottage on the day of the funeral, and believed someone was inside. 

Once accused, Gilchrist breaks down into a flood of complaints about the hardships of her life but quietly goes with the police. During legal proceedings before her trial, she eventually becomes insane, planning one tea shop after another, though Poirot and Entwhistle have no doubt she was in full possession of her faculties during her crime.

* Miss Entwhistle - spinster sister of Mr Entwhistle.

==Themes==

Unlike in &quot;Taken at the Flood&quot;, in which there is a strong sense of post-war English society re-forming along the lines of the &quot;status quo ante&quot;, &quot;After the Funeral&quot; is deeply pessimistic about the social impact of war. A pier on a postcard has been bombed and not yet rebuilt, which fact is pivotal to the plot. Richard Abernethie is devastated that his only son died abruptly from polio, an epidemic of that time. The son was fit, healthy, about to marry, and then gone. Richard sees no other single heir worthy of succeeding to his estate entire. The Abernethie drive and talent for business are found in his niece Susan, but he cannot consider her as sole heir because she is female. Rather, he reacts to her by being disappointed in her husband. Not finding any one person to take over his fortune and business, he divides the money among family members who seem likely to waste it on gambling and theatrical ventures.

One person he valued was his sister-in-law, now widowed by the war. She had a child in a war time affair. She never told Richard of the child, aware of his Victorian views, telling others she has a nephew she helps. She is grateful for his kindness in including her in his will, as she can now raise her son on faraway Cyprus with a proper education. The child is loved, but his mother feels he cannot be accepted in post war England. The last name chosen for Cora&#x27;s husband, the much disliked painter with some claim to being French, is Lansquenet. It is unusual as a last name, as mentioned in the story. The word is the name of a card game, and it is the term for the German mercenary foot soldier with a lance or lancer of the 15th and 16th centuries, who may have played that card game.

Food rationing in England came to an end in the year of publication, but its effect is still felt in the egg shortages that are mentioned in the novel. Throughout, there is a strong sense of the hardships of the post-war period, including the conniving Miss Gilchrist&#x27;s heartache at losing her cherished teashop due to food shortages, and being forced into a life of dependence, in which she is regarded as little more than a servant. There are also comments on the increased burden of taxation associated with Clement Attlee&#x27;s government.

==Literary significance and reception==
Robert Barnard said of this novel that it had &quot;A subject of perennial appeal – unhappy families: lots of scattered siblings, lots of Victorian money (made from corn plasters). Be sure you are investigating the right murder, and watch for mirrors (always interesting in Christie). Contains Christie&#x27;s last major butler: the &#x27;fifties and &#x27;sixties were not good times for butlers.&quot;

==References or allusions==
===References to other works===
In chapter 12, Poirot mentions the case handled in &quot;Lord Edgware Dies&quot; as being one in which he was &quot;nearly defeated&quot;.

In Chapter 13, Poirot&#x27;s valet is referred to in the narrative as &quot;Georges&quot;. His actual name is &quot;George&quot;, but Poirot always addresses him directly as &quot;Georges&quot;. This is the first (and only?) time that he is referred to by the French version in narration.

===References to actual history, geography and current science===
This is the first of the Poirot novels in which lesbianism (between a woman and her companion) may be discussed as a possible motive. However, the possible references are sparse, veiled and euphemistic: Inspector Morton calls it &quot;feverish feminine friendship&quot; in chapter 13.

==Adaptations==

===Film===
In 1963, a film adaptation entitled &quot;Murder at the Gallop&quot; was released by MGM. It was the second of George Pollock’s four popular Christie adaptations. The film holds a 100% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 6 reviews.
This version replaced Poirot with the character of Miss Marple, played by Margaret Rutherford. The film makes a number of other changes to the novel:
* A change in setting: the majority of the film&#x27;s action is set in a riding establishment, 
* The addition of film character &#x27;Mr Stringer&#x27; (played by Stringer Davis, Margaret Rutherford&#x27;s real-life husband),
* The addition of a third death, 
* The alteration and omission of a number of characters,
* A much lighter-hearted, more playful tone

===Television===

On 26 March 2006, an adaptation of the novel was broadcast on ITV with David Suchet as Poirot in the tenth series of &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot;. The cast included Michael Fassbender as George, Geraldine James as Helen Abernethie, Lucy Punch as Susan, Robert Bathurst as Gilbert Entwhistle, Anna Calder-Marshall as Maude, Fiona Glascott as Rosamund, and Monica Dolan as Miss Gilchrist.

There were some changes made for the adaptation:

* Cora is the divorced wife of an Italian artist named Gallaccio, whose surname she kept (interestingly, the producer of many episodes of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Miss Marple&quot; series was George Gallaccio). Gallaccio replaces the character of Mr. Guthrie as the art expert that Poirot relies upon.
* Miss Gilchrist&#x27;s teashop in the novel was named the Palm Tree; the adaption renamed it the Willow Tree, all the china was willow pattern. (In the book, this is the name of the tea shop she kept before the war.)
* The painting revealed at the end is a Rembrandt instead of a Vermeer.
* Entwhistle does not investigate following the funeral and will-reading, but only after Cora&#x27;s death, though in a minor capacity.
* The character of Mr Goby is omitted. Poirot appears solely under his own name, and interviews the family members himself.
* Timothy&#x27;s ability to walk is only shown at the end, unlike in the book where it is known from the start, while Maude is presented as slightly foolish and participates in a flirtation with Gallaccio.
* Susan Banks is renamed Susannah Henderson. She is unmarried, and devoted to missionary works in Africa (specifically, Bechuanaland).
* George is Helen&#x27;s son, Richard&#x27;s favoured nephew, and expected heir to the bulk of the estate. He is carrying on a secret romance with Susan/Susannah; on the day after the funeral they had a secret tryst in Lytchett St Mary. Also, Richard was George&#x27;s real father: Richard had told him this, but George refused to accept it and quarrelled violently with Richard (which Poirot and Entwhistle learn from Lanscombe), and in his disgust forged a will disinheriting himself in favour of the other relatives.
* As in several other episodes, the time has been changed to the 1930s – in this case, from the post-World War II years.
** The pier in the painting found by Susan/Susannah was destroyed by a fire, not the war.
** Miss Gilchrist lost her tea-shop due to a Lyons tea-house opening nearby, not due to wartime rationing.
* When Miss Gilchrist is arrested and taken away, she pauses to repeat her imitation of Cora. Poirot suggests she could be committed for insanity. There is no further discussion.
* Susan/Susannah and Rosamund are sisters instead of cousins, both of them being the daughters of Richard&#x27;s sister Geraldine.
* In the book, Rosamund&#x27;s secret alibi is seeing a doctor to confirm that she was pregnant. In the episode, Rosamund knew she was pregnant and was going to get an abortion, but changed her mind after arriving.

In this production, as is common to the ITV-produced Poirot adaptations, as well as fleshing out plot and relationships there are character developments inserted which are atypical to Christie&#x27;s writing:

* Cousins have an illicit encounter.
* A wife with an unfaithful husband, goes for abortion but decides against it.
* A woman and her brother-in-law have an affair and conceal the parentage of their child.

===Radio===
Michael Bakewell adapted &quot;After the Funeral&quot; for BBC Radio 4, featuring John Moffatt as Poirot with Frank Thornton as Mr. Entwistle, broadcast on 29 August 1999.

<doc id="353718" wikidata="Q1263559" url="?curid=353718" title="Eevee">
<text>Eevee (; Japanese: , Hepburn: ) is a Pokémon species in the &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise. Created by Satoshi Tajiri and designed by Motofumi Fujiwara, it first appeared in the video games &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;. It has later appeared in various merchandise, spinoff titles, as well as animated and printed adaptations of the franchise. It is also the game mascot and starter Pokémon for &quot;Pokémon: Let&#x27;s Go, Eevee!&quot;

Known as the Evolution Pokémon in the games and the anime, Eevee has an unstable genetic code, which allows it to evolve into one of eight different Pokémon, known as Eeveelutions, depending on the situation. The first three of these evolutions, Vaporeon, Jolteon, and Flareon, were introduced alongside Eevee in &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;. Five more evolutions have since been introduced in &quot;Pokémon&quot; games: Espeon, Umbreon, Leafeon, Glaceon, and Sylveon. Eevee is one of the most popular Pokémon among fans, due to its appealing character design and ability to evolve into many forms with different Pokémon types.

==Conception and characteristics==
Eevee is a species of fictional creatures called Pokémon created for the &quot;Pokémon&quot; media franchise. Developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo, the Japanese franchise began in 1996 with the video games &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot; for the Game Boy, which were later released in North America as &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; in 1998. In these games and their sequels, the player assumes the role of a Trainer whose goal is to capture and use the creatures&#x27; special abilities to combat other Pokémon. Some Pokémon can transform into stronger species through a process called evolution via various means, such as exposure to specific items. Each Pokémon have one or two elemental types, which define its advantages and disadvantages when battling other Pokémon. A major goal in each game is to complete the Pokédex, a comprehensive Pokémon encyclopedia, by capturing, evolving, and trading with other Trainers to obtain individuals from all Pokémon species.

During the development of the games, series creator Satoshi Tajiri wanted to include a Pokémon that could evolve into multiple different types. The design for Eevee and its initial evolutions, Jolteon and Flareon, were provided by Japanese graphic designer Motofumi Fujiwara, while fellow graphic designer Atsuko Nishida designed Vaporeon. The designs were then finalized by lead designer Ken Sugimori, who did illustrations based on the game sprites created by Fujiwara and Nishida. In the original Japanese games, the Pokémon was called &quot;Eievui&quot;, a name which has similar prefixes to its current English name. However, before the English versions of the games were released, Eevee was originally going to be named &quot;Eon&quot; rather than &quot;Eevee&quot;. It was renamed to &quot;Eevee&quot; shortly before the English releases of &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;. Eevee in-game is a Normal type, one of eighteen elemental attributes that determine a Pokémon&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses.

According to the &quot;Pokémon&quot; video games, Eevee is a mammalian creature with brown fur, a bushy tail that has a cream-colored tip, and a furry collar that is also cream-colored. Eevee has brown eyes, big ears, and pink paw pads. Eevee is said to have an irregularly shaped genetic structure, enabling it to evolve into multiple Pokémon. Fujiwara stated of Eevee &quot;I wanted to create a blank slate Pokémon&quot;. Eevee&#x27;s design draws upon his vague childhood memories, including an instance where he became lost in a forest and &quot;encountered an undefinable creature,&quot; and he likened its appearance to &quot;a fluffy cat or dog-like creature one would see in the country.&quot; Eevee has been voiced by Erica Schroeder in English and by Chinami Nishimura in Japanese for the anime series, while Aoi Yūki provided the voice of Eevee in various video games. Yūki voices Eevee in the video games akin to Pokémon in the anime series, which say their own names when talking. Due to Eevee having multiple names across languages, Yūki was instructed to blend together various characteristics of these names in her performance. Eevee originally used a digitized &quot;cry&quot; in past games, with Yūki voicing Eevee in &quot;Pokémon: Let&#x27;s Go, Eevee!&quot; and &quot;Pokémon: Let&#x27;s Go, Pikachu!&quot; and &quot;Pokémon Sword and Shield&quot;, with the &quot;cry&quot; from past games in the series being used once more from &quot;Pokémon Legends: Arceus&quot; onwards.

===Evolutions===

Eevee is best known for being the Pokémon with the most potential evolutions (dubbed &quot;Eeveelutions&quot;), with eight possible evolutionary forms. In the first generation of Pokémon games, where Eevee was introduced, it was also the only species to have branched evolutions. All of the Eeveelutions were designed by Atsuko Nishida, except for Jolteon and Flareon, which were designed by Motofumi Fujiwara. The term &quot;Eeveelution&quot; was originally coined by fans. It was first used in an official capacity as a pun in the official guide for &quot;Pokémon Stadium 2&quot; and has since been used as an official designator for the group.

There are a total of eight Eeveelutions, introduced in a variety of games. Vaporeon, a Water-type, Jolteon, an Electric-type, and Flareon, a Fire-type, were introduced in the first installments, &quot;Pokémon Red and Blue&quot;. Espeon, a Psychic-type, and Umbreon, a Dark-type, were introduced in their sequels, &quot;Pokémon Gold and Silver&quot;. Glaceon, an Ice-type, and Leafeon, a Grass-type, were introduced in &quot;Pokémon Diamond and Pearl&quot;, while Sylveon, a Fairy-type, was introduced in &quot;Pokémon X and Y&quot;. A ninth, Flying-type Eeveelution was planned for the 2016 games &quot;Pokémon Sun&quot; and &quot;Moon&quot;, but scrapped due to similarities to a design made by a fan.

==Appearances==

===In the video games===
In the &quot;Red&quot;, &quot;Blue&quot;, &quot;Yellow&quot; versions, the player receives one Eevee in Celadon City. In &quot;Pokémon Yellow&quot;, the player was to receive an Eevee from Professor Oak at the beginning of the game as the player&#x27;s starter. However, the player&#x27;s rival decides to take the Eevee before the player can obtain it. Due to this, the player is forced to choose the wild Pikachu that Professor Oak had caught earlier as a starter. The player&#x27;s rival meanwhile evolves his Eevee into any of the three evolutions available, depending on the outcomes of the player&#x27;s encounters with him in the early parts of the game. Eevee went on to reappear in nearly every subsequent installment of the main series.

In &quot;Pokémon Sun&quot; and &quot;Moon&quot;, Eevee gained the ability to use a special &quot;Z-Crystal&quot; item known as Eevium Z. This allowed it to use a special &quot;Z-Move,&quot; a one time use powerful attack, known as Extreme Evoboost. In &quot;Pokémon Sword&quot; and &quot;Shield&quot;, Eevee gained the ability to use a unique &quot;Gigantamax Form,&quot; which could be used when Eevee utilized the game&#x27;s &quot;Dynamax&quot; mechanic, which exponentially increased the Pokémon&#x27;s size and changed its appearance. The transformation allowed it access to a unique attack known as G-Max Cuddle, which deals damage and infatuates opponents of the opposite gender.

In 2018, remakes of &quot;Pokémon Yellow,&quot; &quot;Pokémon: Let&#x27;s Go, Eevee!&quot; and &quot;Pokémon: Let&#x27;s Go, Pikachu!&quot; were released. Unlike in the original &quot;Pokémon Yellow&quot; game in which Pikachu was the only Pokémon able to walk around with the player outside its Pokéball, in &quot;Let&#x27;s Go, Eevee!&quot; the player&#x27;s partner and starter Pokémon Eevee refuses a Pokéball and stays with the player in the overworld. The partner Eevee is able to wear accessories and clothes and &quot;hairstyles&quot; which are visible in the overworld. Like Pikachu, in &quot;Let&#x27;s Go, Eevee!&quot;, the partner Eevee refuses to evolve, but is able to learn special moves not available in other games, with eight possible moves each based on one of Eevee&#x27;s evolutions. Game developer Junichi Masuda said that Eevee was chosen for the remake because of its popularity in fan art, although Psyduck was also considered before it was decided its colouring was too similar to Pikachu.

Outside of the main series, Eevee has appeared in a variety of spin-offs. In &quot;Pokémon Stadium 2&quot;, Eevee stars in its own minigame called &quot;Eager Eevee&quot;. Players have to run around in circles while Aipom raises and lowers a cover on berries. The object is to be among the first to grab some of the berries. It also appeared in a variety of other games, such as the &quot;Pokémon Mystery Dungeon&quot; series, &quot;Pokémon Conquest&quot;, &quot;Pokemon Masters EX&quot;, &quot;Pokémon Go&quot;, &quot;Pokémon Unite&quot; and &quot;New Pokémon Snap&quot;. It also acts as the first Pokémon available to the player in &quot;Conquest&quot;, and also does so in &quot;Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness&quot;.

===In other media===
In the anime, Eevee first appeared in &quot;The Battling Eevee Brothers&quot;. A little boy named Mikey was hiding the Evolution Pokémon from his three older brothers because they wanted him to evolve it. However, when Mikey&#x27;s Eevee single-handedly defeated Team Rocket, they were able to accept the fact that Mikey wanted to keep his Eevee just the way it is. Ash&#x27;s longtime rival Gary Oak uses an Eevee that eventually evolves into Umbreon. The Kimono Girls who first appeared in the &quot;Pokémon Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot; games, later make an appearance with their Eeveelutions. The youngest of the Kimono girls had an unevolved Eevee, though it evolved into an Espeon later on in the series. May has an Eevee that hatched from an Egg, which she used in Pokémon Contests all across the Kanto region. When May traveled to Sinnoh, it evolved into Glaceon. In &quot;Pokémon the Series: XY&quot;, Serena also acquired an Eevee of her own which evolved into a Sylveon. In &quot;Pokémon the Series: Sun and Moon&quot;, Lana captured a shaggy haired Eevee nicknamed Sandy. Later in the anime, another Eevee owned by the character Chloe Cerise is shown to be incapable of evolving. While the reason is unknown, the other characters theorize it is due to indecisiveness on what to evolve into.

Eevee appears briefly in &quot;Detective Pikachu&quot;, under the ownership of Howard Clifford. It is forced to evolve into Flareon. In &quot;Pokémon Adventures&quot;, Red is in possession of an Eevee which had been experimented on by Team Rocket. As a result, it could transform back and forth from the three evolutions Vaporeon, Jolteon, and Flareon along with its base form, allowing it greater tactical ability in fighting other Pokémon. Eventually, it evolved into an Espeon, losing its special ability to interchange abilities. Eevee and its evolutions have appeared in the &quot;Pokémon Trading Card Game.&quot; It has also appeared in &quot;Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp&quot; and the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series.

In the crowdsourced social experiment &quot;Twitch Plays Pokémon&quot;, an Eevee was the source of much frustration when, while trying to evolve it into a Vaporeon to learn the move Surf, the players accidentally used a Fire Stone on it, evolving it into a Flareon. This setback led to Flareon being called the &quot;false prophet&quot; and became one of the most famous moments of the event.

==Promotion and reception==

Due to its popularity, Eevee and its evolutions have frequently been used in much of the Pokémon merchandising, such as toys. Eevee was a part of a set of Pokémon figures released for &quot;Pokémon Rumble U&quot;, with IGN labelling it as a &quot;fan favourite&quot;. A special Eevee-themed Nintendo 3DS XL was released in Japan in celebration of the fifteenth anniversary of Pokémon Centre retail establishments. Similarly, a special Nintendo Switch featuring Eevee was also released. Eevee has also been a part of various Nintendo events, which allow the players to obtain special Pokémon that are being distributed (one example in Eevee&#x27;s case was a shiny Eevee distribution). Eevee was also one of the several first generation Pokémon to get a special DVD with episodes starring itself during the tenth anniversary of the Pokémon franchise. Eevee and its evolutions were also featured on the side of a jet.

While Eevee was not originally promoted as heavily as other Pokémon, Eevee&#x27;s popularity has grown throughout the years, and it is now one of the series&#x27; most iconic Pokémon. Eevee and its evolutions have received generally positive reception, and it was noted as one of the most popular Pokémon at the offices of The Pokémon Company. Japanese fans of the series have coined November 21 as &quot;Eevee Day&quot; due the pronunciation being similar to Eevee&#x27;s Japanese name &quot;Eievui&quot;. Eevee Day has since been officially adopted by the Pokémon Company, and was later made an official anniversary by the Japan Anniversary Association. Eevee has been cited as a &quot;fan favorite&quot; Pokémon and a franchise staple due to its popularity.

Gita Jackson of &quot;Kotaku&quot; commented on how Eevee symbolized growth, stating that &quot;They are a blank slate. Eevee is that moment before you step out the door and start your adventure. They represent the innocence of not yet knowing who you are, and the excitement of finding out.&quot; They further highlighted how the potential of Eevee made evolving one feel sad, as it meant losing part of what made Eevee unique. Eevee&#x27;s evolutions and adaptability in the game&#x27;s lore were also highlighted as reflecting the real-world concept of evolution, and it has been cited as a surprisingly realistic interpretation of the phenomenon. Joshua Yel, writing for &quot;IGN&quot;, highlighted Eevee&#x27;s popularity and universal appeal as being a result of its appealing design. The versatility of the Pokémon in game, as well as its cute design, were cited as reasons it was such an enduring Pokémon among fans of the series. Due to the versatility of the design, Eevee has received a wide amount of fanart and other creative fan works, which has been cited as being a result of the creativity the design allows fans to get out of it.

Eevee&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Pokémon: Let&#x27;s Go, Pikachu! and Pokémon: Let&#x27;s Go, Eevee!&quot; received positive reviews. Hope Corrigan, writing for &quot;GameRevolution&quot;, commented on Eevee&#x27;s appearance in the game. She highlighted the scene where Eevee interrupts the player&#x27;s first Pokémon selection as immediately making her nostalgic for the days of her childhood when she used Eevee. While criticizing Eevee&#x27;s power in the game, she praised the emotion that it brought her, stating that &quot;For all her overpowered attitude, this Eevee is mine and she loved me right from the beginning. I know she’s just a few pixels in a virtual world but she is my Eevee and after all these years, I’m not ready to give that up.&quot; &quot;Siliconera&quot; writer Jenni Lada also highlighted Eevee&#x27;s appearance in the game, praising the expanded role it played in the game. She also praised the interactions and smaller moments that the player could have with Eevee, citing them as making the player grow easily attached to the Pokémon.

<text>Mucia Tertia ( 79 – 31 BC) was a Roman &quot;matrona&quot; who lived in the 1st century BC. She was the daughter of Quintus Mucius Scaevola, the &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; and consul in 95 BC.

Around 79 BC, Mucia married Pompey, a leading and soon-to-be dominant figure in Roman politics. She was the mother of all three of Pompey&#x27;s known children. Pompey divorced her in 61 BC, either for adultery or for political reasons. She subsequently married Marcus Aemilius Scaurus and remained active in Roman politics, leading peace talks between her son Sextus Pompey and Octavian in 39 BC and maintaining a relationship of mutual respect with Octavian in the years that followed.

==Early life==
Mucia was the daughter of Quintus Mucius Scaevola, while Mucia&#x27;s mother was closely related to Cato the Younger but is otherwise uncertain, she may have been Licinia who divorced her father to marry Quintus Caecilius Metellus Nepos, in a scandal mentioned by several sources. Her name, Mucia Tertia, would suggest that she was a third daughter, according to the Roman naming convention for women, though it is believed that the choice of name was to differentiate her from her two aunts. If her mother was Licinia then Mucia had also two younger half-brothers from her mother&#x27;s second marriage, Quintus Metellus Celer, consul in 60 BC, and Quintus Metellus Nepos, consul in 57 BC.

During her father&#x27;s time as governor of the province of Asia in 95–94 BC, a statue in his honour was erected at Olympia. There is some evidence that a further statue was erected to his wife or daughter which, if it were indeed dedicated to Mucia, would make her the first woman to receive this honour, which later became usual for members of the imperial household.

==Marriages==
Mucia was possibly first married to Gaius Marius the Younger, consul in 82 BC, at a very young age. This was a time of civil war between the Marian regime at Rome and Lucius Cornelius Sulla. Following his defeat the Younger Marius committed suicide; if the marriage had gone ahead, this would have left Mucia a childless widow.

Following the victory of Lucius Sulla Felix over Gaius Marius the Younger, Sulla, as &quot;Dictator&quot;, needed to secure Pompey&#x27;s loyalty and to do that, he arranged the latter&#x27;s marriage to Mucia around 79 BC. This marriage resulted in three children: elder son Gnaeus Pompeius, daughter Pompeia Magna (who married Faustus Cornelius Sulla) and younger son Sextus Pompey. She outlived all three of her children.

Between 76 and 61 BC, Pompey spent most of the time away from Rome, campaigning in Hispania against Sertorius, in the Mediterranean Sea against the pirates, and in the East fighting King Mithridates VI of Pontus. On his return in 61, Pompey sent Mucia a letter of divorce. According to Cicero&#x27;s personal correspondence, the motive was adultery – it is said that she was one of Julius Caesar&#x27;s many affairs, although Pompey&#x27;s friendship and alliance with Caesar at the time could suggest that Pompey himself either did not regard this rumour as true or did not consider it important. The imperial biographer Suetonius stated that Pompey often referred to Caesar as &quot;Aegisthus&quot;, the name of a Greek mythological character who was known to have seduced a king&#x27;s wife. Mucia next married Marcus Aemilius Scaurus, a stepson of the dictator Sulla, with whom she had another son named Marcus. In 39 BC Mucia, at the earnest request of the Roman people, went to Sicily to mediate between her son Sextus Pompey and triumvir Octavian (the future emperor Augustus). This made her the first Roman woman recorded as fulfilling an official diplomatic role.

Mucia was alive at the time of the Battle of Actium in 31 BC, though her date of death is unknown. Octavian treated her with great respect.

<text>Edward Hunter (also known as &quot;Billy Banjo&quot;; 2 June 1885 – 6 December 1959) was a Scottish socialist, active in both Scotland and New Zealand. He was a trade union organiser, politician and a writer, and played a considerable role in the development of socialism in New Zealand. 

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Born in Lanarkshire he was the son of a miner, which he later became himself at the age of 12 after receiving little formal education. He emigrated to the West Coast of New Zealand in 1906, already a committed socialist, influenced by Scottish left-wing thinkers such as Keir Hardie and Bob Smillie (both members of the Independent Labour Party). As a miners&#x27; leader, Hunter became a leading member of the New Zealand Federation of Labour.

=== Socialist career ===
Hunter became a socialist writer using the pen-name &quot;Billy Banjo&quot;, articulating miners&#x27; concerns in verse and prose. Hunter was convinced that the miners could become politically educated to the extent where they would be ready to lead the working class to some form of socialist emancipation. He would regularly articulate these ideas and more in his writings.

In 1909 he married Mary Wards Cutt in Wellington, with whom he had four children.

As a member of the New Zealand Socialist Party, he had by 1911 become secretary of his local party branch. Around this time there was a wave of trade union militancy in New Zealand, and during this period Hunter became more politically assertive. In &#x27;A song of freedom&#x27; Hunter called on the miners to &#x27;stand and fight&#x27;, and after the death of Fred Evans in a skirmish between police and striking miners at Waihi in November 1912, he called for a general strike which was proclaimed in 1913. Hunter welcomed this strike as a &#x27;peoples&#x27; revolt&#x27; and was heavily involved in its organisation. His activities resulted in his arrest and he was charged with sedition. The authorities alleged that he incited revolution in response to the government&#x27;s violent reaction. Hunter received a period of probation.

After the New Zealand Social Democratic Party was formed in 1913 in an attempt to unify various groups within the labour movement, Hunter represented the miners on the party&#x27;s executive committee.

For his trade union organising activities and socialist beliefs, Hunter was blacklisted on the coalfields, so he instead worked as an organiser for the shearers&#x27; union and the Wellington Rural Workers&#x27; Union, and in various other jobs. His attempts to promote the cause of industrial unionism among rural workers were not as successful as they had been among the miners as his ideas fell on less receptive ears. It was in this period that Hunter turned more to his writing and away from active political organisation. He wrote many socialist poems and other works, much of which was published. In his writing there are similarities with the work of his brother-in-law James Welsh.

=== Later life ===
His wife Mary died in March 1915, leaving him to raise four young children alone. Hunter returned to Scotland with his family around 1919, when there was intense labour activity around the city of Glasgow which was commonly referred to as Red Clydeside. He immediately involved himself in the socialist agitation in Clydeside. Hunter wrote a play &quot;The Disinherited&quot; which was performed by people drawn from the mining community of Douglas Water in Lanarkshire. Thereafter Hunter worked as a journalist, writing for labour newspapers.

In 1937 he was elected on a Labour Party ticket to the Glasgow City Council. He represented Cowcaddens for 22 years and became deputy chairman of the council as well as serving as the city&#x27;s police commissioner. He died shortly after his retirement from active politics.

<text>Rock Island Dam is a hydroelectric dam on the Columbia River, in the U.S. state of Washington. Chelan County Public Utility District&#x27;s &quot;Rock Island Dam and Hydro Project&quot; was the first dam to span the Columbia, having been built from 1929 to 1933. It is located near the geographical center of Washington, about downstream from the city of Wenatchee. By river, the dam is south of the Canada–US border and above the mouth of the river at Astoria, Oregon. The dam&#x27;s reservoir is called Rock Island Pool.

==Overview==
Rock Island Dam is constructed on Columbia River basalt similar to that which is exposed on the cliffs near the dam. These columnar basalts were formed from lava flows during the mid- to late-Miocene Epoch, some 14 to 16 million years ago. The rock is strong and durable and provides a very stable foundation for the structure.

Columbia River stream flows at the Project averaged 73,700 cubic feet per second (2090 m³/s), a decrease of 37% from 2000 and 63% of the 20 year average of 116,700 cubic feet per second (3305 m³/s).

==Electricity generation==
The Rock Island Hydro Project generated 1,900 gigawatt-hours of electricity in 2001 — 70% of its 2000 output. Over the past 10 years the Project has averaged 2,600 gigawatt-hours per year.

During 2001, Rock Island&#x27;s Second Powerhouse produced 1,800 gigawatt-hours of power, representing 95% of the Project&#x27;s total generation for the year. The 10 year average generation for the Project is 383 gigawatt-hours.

Under the terms of the Rock Island Settlement Agreement, the District provides spill to improve the survival rate of juvenile salmon passing the Project. During the spring, of water was spilled during a 59-day period between April 20 and June 17. This resulted in 73,427 megawatt-hours of foregone generation valued at $13.4 million.

In 1927, the Rock Island site came to the attention of the Stone and Webster Engineering Corporation, a Boston-based holding company that managed Puget Sound Power &amp; Light Company. The site was recognized for its potential to provide power for the growing electrical load in the state. On December 13, 1928, an application was filed with the Federal Power Commission for a preliminary permit to investigate the site. This was followed by an application for license submitted in June 1929 by the Washington Electric Company, a subsidiary construction corporation of Puget Sound Power &amp; Light (now part of Puget Sound Energy). The license was authorized on October 16, 1929, and on January 14, 1930, at the beginning of the Great Depression, construction started on the first dam to span the Columbia River.

The development of Rock Island Dam occurred over a period of some 50 years. There were three main construction periods, each taking place about 20 years apart as the need for low-cost hydroelectric power was paramount in the region. Development began in January 1930, and the dam, powerhouse, and first four operating units were turned over to Puget Sound Power &amp; Light Company by Stone and Webster Engineering Corporation on February 1, 1933. Work on completion of the dam, powerhouse expansion and installation of six additional units by Chelan County PUD began in July 1951 and was completed on April 30, 1953. Construction of the Second Powerhouse, with its eight turbine generators located on the west bank of the river, began on August 4, 1974. The Second Powerhouse was placed in commercial operation on August 31, 1979.

<text>The black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), also known as the Arctic three-toed woodpecker, is a medium-sized woodpecker ( long) inhabiting the forests of North America.

==Taxonomy==
The black-backed woodpecker was described and illustrated by the English naturalist William Swainson in 1832 from a specimen collected near the source of the Athabasca River on the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains in Alberta, Canada. He coined the binomial name &quot;Picus arcticus&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;arcticus&quot; is the Latin word for &quot;northern&quot; or &quot;arctic&quot;. The 
black-backed woodpecker is now placed in the genus &quot;Picoides&quot; which was erected by the French naturalist Bernard Germain de Lacépède in 1799. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==
The plumage of adults is black on the head, back, wings and rump. They are white from the throat to the belly; the flanks are white with black bars. Their tail is black with white outer feathers. There is an element of sexual dimorphism in the plumage, with the adult male possessing a yellow cap. Unlike all other woodpeckers except the related American and Eurasian three-toed woodpeckers, this species has three-toed feet.

Measurements:

* Length: 
* Weight: 
* Wingspan: 

==Habitat and breeding==
Their breeding range is boreal forest across Canada, Alaska, the Northwestern United States, as well as northern Wisconsin, the Adirondacks in New York, New England, Minnesota, and Upper Michigan. In particular the species is a burnt-forest specialist, feeding on the outbreaks of wood-boring beetles that feed on recently burnt trees. The most important wood boring beetles taken are in the families Cerambycidae and Buprestidae, along with engraver beetles and the mountain pine beetle. Most food is obtained by pecking, a smaller proportion is obtained by gleaning off branches. Black-backed woodpeckers are generally non-migratory but historically have undertaken intermittent irruptions.

Nest excavation occurs in April and May; a fresh nest is drilled each year into the sapwood of dead trees. Abandoned nests are used by other species of bird to nest in. The female lays three or four eggs, and incubation duties are shared between both parents, although the male alone incubates during the night. Upon hatching the altricial chicks are brooded until the nestling phase. Both parents feed the chicks, which take about 24 days to fledge.

==Vocalization==
The call note of the black-backed woodpecker is a single, sharp &quot;pik&quot;, and is lower pitched than the call of the American three-toed woodpecker.

<text>Wells Dam is a hydroelectric embankment dam located on the Columbia River, downstream from the confluence of the Okanogan River, Methow River, and the Columbia River in Washington state. The dam, associated structures, and machinery make up the Wells Hydroelectric Project. It is owned and operated by Douglas County Public Utility District.
It has produced electricity since August 22, 1967. Its operating license from the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is next up for renewal in 2052. The Wells project has ten generating units rated at a combined 840 megawatts. In addition to the Douglas County and Okanogan County public utility districts, the project provides electricity to Puget Sound Energy, Portland General Electric, PacifiCorp, Avista Corporation, and the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation.

Its reservoir is named Lake Pateros. Just below and adjacent is Carpenter Island boat launch and fish hatchery river access. Lake Pateros is not deep but a high volume of water moves through it. Thus, low-head, high-volume Kaplan turbine runners drive generation.

<doc id="353740" wikidata="Q79874" url="?curid=353740" title="Flag of Afghanistan">
<text>The national flag of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (; ), adopted on 15 August 2021 following the Taliban&#x27;s victory in the 2001–2021 war, features a white field with a black &quot;Shahada&quot; inscribed. Since the 20th century, Afghanistan has changed its national flag several times. The national flag had black, red and green colors most of the time during the period.

In contrast, the tricolor flag of the internationally recognized Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, still in use internationally and by internal resistance groups, consists of three vertical stripes in black, red and green, with the national emblem at the center in white. This emblem is encircled by sheaves of wheat and encompasses several elements: a &quot;Shahada&quot;, a &quot;Takbir&quot;, rays of the sun, a mosque with a &quot;mihrab&quot; and &quot;minbar&quot;, two miniature Afghan flags, the year 1298 in the Solar Hijri calendar (corresponding to 1919 in the Gregorian calendar), and the name of the nation. A version of this tricolor flag, introduced by King Amanullah Khan in July 1928, similarly featured three vertical stripes and an emblem within wheat sheaves.

== Symbolism of the flag of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan ==
The current flag of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan is a plain white flag with the black words of the &quot;shahada&quot; in the centre. The white stands for &quot;the (Islamic Movement of Taliban&#x27;s) purity of faith and government&quot;; the flag incorporated the &quot;shahada&quot;, the Islamic declaration of faith, after 1997.

The current national flag differs from the banners of other jihadist groups, including those of al-Qaeda and the Islamic State, in having white as its chief colour and the &quot;shahada&quot; in black, an inversion of the design of the coloring of most jihadist groups&#x27; banners. This current Afghan flag likely was inspired by the historic Umayyad caliphate, which began the Muslim conquest of the Indian subcontinent, the &quot;Ghazwa-e-Hind&quot;: Islam entered Afghanistan with the Umayyad invasion, begun in 663–665 A.D. as a prelude to the Muslim conquest of Transoxiana from 673 to 751 A.D.

== Islamic Republic tricolor ==

The national flag of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan set out in the 2004 Constitution consists of a vertical tricolor with the classical national emblem in the center. The latest version was adopted on August 19, 2013, but many similar tricolor designs had been in use throughout most of the 20th century, starting in 1928. Due to the lack of diplomatic recognition of the Taliban government, this tricolor remains in use by most diplomatic missions of Afghanistan, despite the overthrow of the Islamic Republic in 2021. It is also used by the Afghan diaspora and republican insurgents, and is considered a symbol of resistance within the country.

During the Afghan Independence Day rallies in Jalalabad and other cities on 18 and 19 August 2021, the Taliban killed three people and injured over a dozen others for removing Taliban flags and displaying the tricolor Afghan flags. The Taliban has issued a decree requiring the use of the Islamic Emirate&#x27;s flag in all official settings outlawing the tricolor.

=== History of Afghanistan&#x27;s tricolor flags ===
The black color represents its troubled 19th century history as a protected state, the red color represents the blood of those who fought for independence (specifically, the Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1919), and the green represents hope and prosperity for the future. Some have alternatively interpreted the black to represent history, the red to represent progress, and the green to represent either agricultural prosperity or Islam.

The tricolor was supposedly inspired by the Afghan King Amanullah Khan when visiting Europe with his wife in 1928. The original horizontal tricolor design was based on that of the Weimar Republic-era flag of Germany.

Almost every Afghan tricolor flag since 1928 has had the Emblem of Afghanistan in the center. Almost every emblem has had a mosque in it, which first appeared in 1901, and wheat, first appearing in 1928.

The last tricolor flag took its current form in 2002 with modifications later on in 2004 and 2013, with some variants containing differing coloured emblems.

Following the restoration of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan after the Fall of Kabul in 2021, protests took place in Jalalabad and other cities, where protesters were seen waving Afghan tricolor flags protesting its removal in defiance of Taliban rule, due to the reinstatement of the white Shahada flag and the abolishment of the former black, red and green tricolor flag.

The tricolor flag was used by the Afghan delegation at the 2020 Summer Paralympics between 25 August and 5 September 2021, as well as at the 2021 Cricket T20 World Cup between 26 October and 4 November 2021, both after the fall of Kabul.

== Historical flags ==

===Black Standard in central Asia and the first flag===
Black Standard is one of the flags flown by the Islamic prophet Muhammad according to Muslim tradition. It was historically used by Abu Muslim in his uprising leading to the Abbasid Revolution in 747 and is therefore associated with the Abbasid Caliphate in particular. The revolution began with a rebellion in Khorasan. After this event, in the world of Islam, black banners were strongly associated with Khorasan and the East in general.

The next dynasty associated with the use of the Black Banner was the Hotak dynasty in the early 18th century, following Mirwais Hotak&#x27;s Sunni rebellion against the Twelver Shi&#x27;i Safavid dynasty. The flags of the Hotak dynasty are remembered as solid black, but sometimes there were also white shahada inscriptions.

The use of black banners is also attributed to the Principality of Qandahar.

Solid black flag was last used during the reign of Abdur Rahman Khan in the Emirate of Afghanistan and in 1901, after his death, a white seal was added to it.

===Herat flag (1818–1842)===
The Hotak dynasty was overthrown by Persian King, Nader Shah. Following his assassination in 1747, Ahmad Shah Durrani rose to power in Kandahar. He rapidly expanded into neighboring countries such as the Mughal Empire, Afsharids, and others. Ahmad Shah became the first Amir of modern Afghanistan (ruled 1747–1772). After the Durranis were deposed from power and forced to exile in Herat after the assassination of Fateh Khan Barakzai, the flag was implemented during the reign of Kamran Shah Durrani in the Emirate of Herat.

===Second flag (1901–1919)===
State flag and royal banner introduced around 1901, when Habibullah Khan ascended the throne, and replaced in 1919. Its use was limited to the king, the army and some state services (e.g. customs). Overlaid on a black field was a white emblem with a schematic drawing of a mosque, inside of which could be seen the mihrâb, a niche for prayer facing Mecca, and the minbar (pulpit). The mosque rested on crossed arms and weather vanes and was crowned with a royal headdress (Kolah namadi), all encased in a garland of leaves. The mosque has been used as a national emblem before, but its inclusion on the flag in 1901 is considered the first adoption of an official emblem. Since then, most of the later flags include the emblem.

===Third flag (1919–1921/29)===
First flag flown under the rule of Emir Amanullah. He expanded his father&#x27;s flag by removing the cannons and replacing the wreath with rays emanating from the seal in the form of an octagram. This new style of seal was common in the Ottoman Empire.

===Fourth flag (1921–1926/29)===

An oval replaced the circle inscribing the mosque in 1921. In 1926, Amanullah was proclaimed King and changed the national flag by modernizing the arms.

===Fifth flag (1926–1928)===

After being crowned the first king of Afghanistan, Amanullah Khan replaced the star with a wreath, which, depending on the version, consisted of olive and oak leaves. The swords and kolah were removed from the emblem, and the mosque was redrawn to be more complex. Despite these changes, during King&#x27;s trip to Europe in 1928, he was greeted with flags with star. In addition to changing the national flag, the king also introduced a personal flag, which contained elements removed from the emblem on a red background on the obverse and royal tughra on the reverse.

===Sixth flag (1928)===
Next flag flown under King Amanullah, introduced around June 1928. The Black Banner was replaced by the tricolor for the first time. Consisting of black, red and green respectively, symbolizing the past (previous flags), bloodshed for independence (Third Anglo-Afghan War) and hope for the future, it was probably influenced by the king&#x27;s visit to Europe, and especially the Weimar Republic (which at the time had a black-red-gold flag) in 1927/8.

===Seventh flag (1928–1929)===
Fifth flag flown under the rule of Amanullah, introduced about a month after the last change. It was the first vertical-tricolored flag which would be used throughout most of the remainder of the 20th century. The emblem was completely changed in the style of socialist heraldry, removing religious, military and royal references. The new emblem shows the sun rising over two snow-capped mountains, representing a new beginning for the kingdom. This emblem also contained heaps of wheat, an icon that would be present on all future emblems of Afghanistan throughout different regimes. Notably, only the Soviet emblem had wheat at the time, and would in the future appear on many communist states&#x27; flags. The flag is known only through abbreviated descriptions; the chromatics of the central emblem are uncertain, as is the presence of the star. This short-lived innovative emblem did not appear on the currency. The symbol of the sun rising over the mountains appears later in the 1940s on the flag of Pashtunistan.

===Eighth flag (1929)===
In January 1929, in opposition to Amrullah&#x27;s reformist rule, the Saqqawists approached Kabul. The king abdicated, leaving power to his brother. During the 3 days of his reign, Inayatullah Khan reportedly hoisted old flags with a solid black background.

===Ninth flag (1929)===
Flag used for several months in 1929 in areas not under Saqqawist control. During Amarullah&#x27;s struggle to regain power the tricolor flag was restored however, in the center was the old radial emblem – with some modifications – in an elliptical version.

===Tenth flag (1929–1931)===
Saqqawist forces under Habibullāh Kalakāni established government of Emirate of Afghanistan on 17 January 1929. Flag flown under the brief rule of Habibullah Kalakani – a red, black and white vertical tricolor, like the ones used by the Mongols during their occupation of Afghanistan in the 13th century. Saqqawist Emirate of Afghanistan controlled only part of Afghanistan, mainly around Kabul and a wide north–south strip along the border with British India, present-day Pakistan. The exception was the city of Herat, which was conquered in an uprising and held long after the fall of the Emirate and Kalakani&#x27;s death. The insurgents in Herat used a modified Saqqawi flag with a crescent moon.

===Eleventh flag (1929)===
Transitional flag used by Ali Ahmad Khan&#x27;s short-lived rival government in Jalalabad, in opposition to the Kalakani rebellion.

===Twelfth flag (1929–1931)===
Direct development of the ninth flag under Mohammad Nadir Shah which retained the emblem in the star.

===Thirteenth flag (1931–1973)===
The national and state flag, the longest existing in modern Afghanistan, adopted in 1930 and confirmed the constitution of October 1964. The flag was adopted under King Nadir Shah and survived his assassination on 8 November 1933 and lasted until the end of his son, Mohammad Zahir Shah&#x27;s reign. The octagram rays were removed, and the seal enlarged – the mosque design is based on that of 1926. In between the mosque and the seal is the year ١٣٤٨ (1348 of the lunar Islamic calendar, or 1929 AD of the Gregorian calendar), the year Mohammed Nadir Shah&#x27;s dynasty began. New royal flags were also introduced, which included the national emblem on a red background and new royal tughras on the reverse.

===Fourteenth flag (1973–1974)===
First flag flown for the Republic of Afghanistan, proclaimed after the 1973 Afghan coup d&#x27;état by the king&#x27;s cousin, Army General Mohammad Daoud Khan, who became the first president. It is identical to the previous flag, except that the year ١٣٤٨ (1348) was removed as Zahir Shah&#x27;s monarchy ended, this was probably not followed because of the poverty of the country, the low level of public construction and the family links between Daoud and King Zahir Shah.

===Fifteenth flag (1974–1978)===

Second flag flown for the Republic of Afghanistan. The same colors were used, but the meanings reinterpreted: black for the obscure past, red for blood shed for independence, and green for prosperity from agriculture. In the canton is a new seal, with a golden eagle with spread wings, a pulpit (&quot;minbar&quot;) on the eagle&#x27;s chest (for a mosque), wheat surrounding the eagle, and the sun&#x27;s rays above the eagle (for the new republic). The cartouche bears the name of the country and the date of the revolution according to the local solar calendar, 26 changash 1352, or 17 July 1973. President Daoud also changed the flag of the head of state by replacing it with a new emblem, and the flag became double-sided.

===Sixteenth flag (1978)===
When the republic&#x27;s president Mohammad Daoud Khan was killed in a coup, the new regime under the People&#x27;s Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) established a communist state. For a brief period of time, during the transition, the same flag design was kept, but no seal. A similar flag was used by the Junbish-e Milli party which controlled autonomous northern Afghanistan from 1992 to 1998.

===Seventeenth flag (1978–1980)===
A radical change, this flag used a red field with a yellow seal in the canton, a common design for socialist states in the 20th century. In fact, the design was very similar to the flag of the neighboring Soviet Union. It consisted of the PDPA&#x27;s Khalq (, ) faction&#x27;s emblem with wheat, a star at the top (representing the five ethnic groups of the nation), the term &#x27;Khalq&#x27; in Nastaliq script in the center, and a subtitle reading &#x27;Saur Revolution ١٣٥٧&#x27; and the full name of the state. All religious references are gone.

===Eighteenth flag (1980–1987)===
Under the Fundamental Principles program of the new leadership under Babrak Karmal, the traditional black, red and green tricolor was re-established, representing the past, blood shed for independence, and the Islamic faith, respectively. A new seal was designed, with a rising sun (a reference to the former name, &quot;Khorasan&quot;, meaning &quot;Land of the Rising Sun&quot;), a pulpit and a book, ribbons with the national colors, a cogwheel for industry, and a red star for communism. The seal&#x27;s ribbons and wheat has similarities to the then-East German and Romanian seals.

===Nineteenth flag (1987–1992)===
The flag was changed as part of Mohammad Najibullah&#x27;s National Reconciliation constitution changes. Same as the previous flag, except that in the national seal, the cogwheel is moved from the top to the bottom, the red star and the book are removed, and the green field curved to resemble the horizon.

===Twentieth flag (1992)===
This flag was used as a provisional flag after the fall of the Najibullah pro-Soviet regime. It appeared in many variants of which two are shown here. The upper stripe contains the &quot;Takbir&quot;, whereas the center stripe (now white, with the red entirely removed from the flag) contains the &quot;Shahada&quot;.

=== Twenty-first flag (1992–2002) ===
The new Islamic government under Rabbani featured a flag change. The color scheme is similar to several Middle Eastern Muslim nations&#x27; flags. Elements from the times of the monarchy returned to the emblem, but with the addition of the &quot;Shahada&quot; and drawn completely differently swords representing the mujahideen&#x27;s victory. It now shows the year ١۲۹٨ (1298), the solar Islamic calendar equivalent of AD 1919 of the Gregorian Calendar, the year of full independence. On the bottom part of the emblem was written &quot;&quot;, &quot;Islamic State of Afghanistan&quot;. The rays of the rising sun have survived on the emblem. This pattern was used longer in areas that the Taliban did not control after winning the battle for Kabul, i.e. the north of the country. In 2021, the flag returned among the flags of the National Resistance Front of Afghanistan.

===Twenty-second flag (1996–1997)===
A plain white banner was used by the Taliban. In the Islamic tradition, the white banner is attributed to the Umayyad dynasty, which was overthrown by the Abbasids associated with black banners.

===Twenty-third flag (1997–2001)===
In 1997, the Taliban introduced the Arabic &quot;Shahada&quot; in black on a white flag as the national flag of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.

===Twenty-fourth flag (2001–2002)===

This flag was used by President Rabbani along with the national flag after the fall of the Taliban government. Same as the 1992 flag, but with Pashto and Dari texts.

===Twenty-fifth flag (2002)===

After the fall of the Taliban, the traditional black, red and green colors were restored and in a vertical pattern, just as the ones flown from 1928 to 1974. The center emblem is the classical emblem of Afghanistan – it is the same version as used in the 1992 flag, but with the swords removed.

===Twenty-sixth flag (2002–2004)===

The Loya Jirga of spring 2002 voted the Afghan national flag with some changes including the coat of arms being gold instead of white, the year now dating &quot;1380&quot; under the mosque instead of &quot;1348&quot;. In June 2002, Afghanistan officially changed its national flag from a white coat of arms in the center of the flag to a gold coat of arms which symbolizes the colour of a wheat wreath.

===Twenty-seventh flag (2004–2021)===
The 2004 constitution adopted under Hamid Karzai&#x27;s presidency adopts an emblem more akin to the last emblem from the reign of the kingdom. The flag was used in many variants by the Islamic State of Afghanistan, and after its collapse is one of the flags of the anti-Taliban opposition. In 2004, the flag of the head of state was introduced again, this time in opposite colors than the flag from the time of Daud. However, a newer emblem appeared only in 2013, when Karzai was replaced by Ashraf Ghani.

===Twenty-eighth flag (2021–present)===
In 2021, the Taliban re-introduced the flag of the Islamic Emirate. As with the first adoption of the Taliban flag, many variants appeared this time, among others, &quot;Shahada&quot; on a white flag with &quot;Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan&quot; in Pashto written below the Arabic &quot;Shahada&quot;; a Dari Persian version of the flag has also been observed, although less frequently.

== Unicode ==
The flag of Afghanistan is represented as the Unicode emoji sequence and , making &quot;🇦🇫&quot;. However, the flag represented is still the one that belongs to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. Recent speculation state in future Unicode updates, the emoji will be updated.

<text>Wanapum Dam is a run-of-the-river hydroelectric project located on the Columbia River downstream (south) from Vantage, Washington where Interstate 90 crosses the Columbia from Grant County into Kittitas County. It is owned by the Grant County Public Utility District. Its reservoir is named Lake Wanapum.

The dam, and its lake, are named after the Wanapum Indians. The dam has a rated capacity of 1,185 megawatts and annually generates over 4 million megawatt-hours.

== History ==
The Wanapum dam was originally licensed in 1955 for a period of 50 years. Construction was initiated in 1959 with initial beneficial operation in 1963. The initial license expired in 2005, after which the Grant County PUD operated the dam on yearly license extensions while negotiations for license extension proceeded. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved a license extension of 44 years for both the Wanapum dam and the downstream Priest Rapids Dam on April 17, 2008. The license extension was conditioned upon programs to achieve the following goals:

* modernize the power generation capability of the dam
* monitor water quality
* improve wildlife habitat
* protect nearly 700 Wanapum Tribe archaeological sites in the vicinity
* enhance recreation with new campsites, picnic areas and trails

=== Spillway crack ===
On February 27, 2014, a wide crack was discovered by inspection divers on one of the tall concrete monoliths that make up the spillway of the dam. A spokesman for the Grant County PUD indicated that the level of the water was to be lowered by over a period of days to &quot;reduce the pressure on the spillway while inspectors investigate&quot;.

During the time that the water level was lowered for repairs, all beaches and water access in the area above the dam were closed to protect sensitive cultural resources and help to ensure public safety. Public access was restored in the spring of 2015.

After an 11-week inspection, the primary reason for the crack was determined to be a mathematical error during the pre-construction design of the dam. Repairs of the cracked monolith and the strengthening of the remaining monoliths were made in 2014-2015. The $61 million fix, used steel cabling and rods to stitch the dam to the bedrock underneath.

<text>Priest Rapids Dam is a hydroelectric, concrete gravity dam; located on the Columbia River, between the Yakima Firing Range and the Hanford Nuclear Reservation, and bridges Yakima County and Grant County, in the U.S. state of Washington. The dam is 24 miles south of the town of Vantage, and 47 miles northwest of the city of Richland. It is located at mile marker 397.1 from the mouth of the Columbia. It is owned by the Grant County Public Utility District (PUD). Priest Rapids, for which the dam was named, are now submerged beneath the dam&#x27;s reservoir.

Priest Rapids Dam is part of the Columbia River Basin system of dams.

== History==

After the disaster of 1949 Vanport Flood on the lower Columbia River, around Vancouver, Washington, and Portland, Oregon, the federal government established the Priest Rapids Project under the Flood Control Act of 1950 (Public Law 81-516; May 17, 1950). The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers decided the project would not be a top priority, so the Grant PUD began looking at taking over the project from the USACE in 1952. With the passage of Public Law 83-544 in 1955, Congress gave Grant PUD the right to proceed. Revenue bonds were issued for construction to begin in July 1956, first generation occurred in 1959, and the dam was completed in 1961. Its reservoir is named Priest Rapids Lake, and extends 18 miles upstream to spillway of Wanapum Dam. Downriver from Priest Rapids Dam is Hanford Reach, the only free-flowing, non-tidal stretch of the Columbia River in the United States.

The initial license expired in 2005, after which the Grant County PUD operated the dam on yearly license extensions while negotiations for license extension proceeded. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved a license extension of 44 years for both this dam and the upstream Wanapum Dam on April 17, 2008. The license extension was conditioned upon programs to:
:* modernize the power generation capability of the dam
:* monitor water quality
:* improve wildlife habitat
:* protect nearly 700 Wanapum Tribe archaeological sites in the vicinity
:* enhance recreation with new campsites, picnic areas and trails

=== Problems===
An explosion injured six employees on October 8, 2015.
Grant County PUD was fined $35,000 for safety violations.

Leaks have been discovered in the spillway monoliths. A &quot;non-failure emergency&quot; was declared, and the water level behind the dam was reduced by about three feet.

<text>This is a list of computability and complexity topics, by Wikipedia page.

Computability theory is the part of the theory of computation that deals with what can be computed, in principle. Computational complexity theory deals with how hard computations are, in quantitative terms, both with upper bounds (algorithms whose complexity in the worst cases, as use of computing resources, can be estimated), and from below (proofs that no procedure to carry out some task can be very fast).

<text>The spotted crake (Porzana porzana) is a small waterbird of the family Rallidae. The scientific name is derived from Venetian terms for small rails.

The spotted crake&#x27;s breeding habitat is marshes and sedge beds across temperate Europe into western Asia. They nest in a dry location in marsh vegetation, laying 6–15 eggs. This species is migratory, wintering in Africa and Pakistan.

At length, spotted crakes are slightly smaller than water rails, from which they are readily distinguished by the short straight bill, yellow with a red base. Adults have mainly brown upperparts and blue-grey breast, with dark barring and white spots on the flanks. They have green legs with long toes, and a short tail which is buff underneath.

Immature spotted crakes are similar, but the blue-grey is replaced by brown. The downy chicks are black, as with all rails.

The only confusion species is the sora, a rare vagrant from North America. However, that species lacks the breast spotting and has an unstreaked crown stripe.

These birds probe with their bill in mud or shallow water, also picking up food by sight. They mainly eat insects and aquatic animals.

Spotted crakes are very secretive in the breeding season, and are then mostly heard rather than seen. They are then noisy birds, with a distinctive repetitive whiplash-like &quot;hwuit, hwuit&quot; call. They can be easier to see on migration.

The spotted crake is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies. The Western European population has declined in recent decades, and the species is now a very rare breeding bird in Great Britain.

However, &quot;chicha&quot; is also made from a variety of other cultigens and wild plants, including, among others, quinoa (&quot;Chenopodium quinia&quot;), kañiwa (&quot;Chenopodium pallidicaule&quot;), peanut, manioc (also called yuca or cassava), palm fruit, rice, potato, oca (&quot;Oxalis tuberosa&quot;), and chañar (&quot;Geoffroea decorticans&quot;). There are many regional variations of &quot;chicha&quot;. In the Inca Empire, &quot;chicha&quot; had ceremonial and ritual uses.

== Etymology and related phrases ==

The exact origin of the word &quot;chicha&quot; is debated. One belief is that the word &quot;chicha&quot; is of Taino origin and became a generic term used by the Spanish to define any and all fermented beverages brewed by indigenous peoples in the Americas. It is possible that one of the first uses of the term &quot;chicha&quot; was from a group of people who lived in Colombia and Panama, the Kuna. However, according to the Real Academia Española and other authors, the word &quot;chicha&quot; comes from the Kuna word or “chiab” which means maize. According to Don Luis G. Iza it comes from the Nahuatl word , which means “fermented water”; the verb &quot;chicha&quot; meaning “to sour a drink“ and the noun &quot;atl&quot; meaning “water”. These etymologies are not mutually exclusive.

The Spanish idiom &quot;ni chicha ni limonada&quot; (neither &quot;chicha&quot; nor lemonade) means “neither one thing nor another” (roughly equivalent to the English “neither fish nor fowl”).

== Maize chicha ==

=== Preparation ===
Chicha de jora is a corn beer prepared by germinating maize, extracting the malt sugars, boiling the wort, and fermenting it in large vessels, traditionally huge earthenware vats, for several days. The original Quechua name is &quot;aqa&quot; ~ &quot;aqha&quot; (Ayacucho vs. Cuzco-Bolivia varieties), and it is traditionally made and sold in chicherías, called also &quot;aqa wasi&quot; or &quot;aqha wasi&quot; (lit. “chicha house”).

Usually, the brewer makes chicha in large amounts and uses many of these clay vats to do so. These vats break down easily and can only be used a few times. The brewers can arrange their vessels in rows, with fires in the middle, to reduce heat loss.

The process for making chicha is essentially the same as the process for the production of malted barley beer. It is traditionally made with Jora corn, a type of malted corn from the Andes. The specific type or combination of corn used in the making of &quot;chicha de jora&quot; shows where it was made. Some add quinoa or other adjuncts to give it consistency; then it is boiled. During the boiling process, the chicha is stirred and aerated so as to prevent overboiling. &quot;Chancaca&quot;, a hard form of sugar (like sugar cane), helps with the fermentation process.

After the milling of the corn and the brewing of the drink, the chicha is then sieved. Traditionally, it is sieved through a large cloth. This is to separate the corn from the desired chicha.

In some cultures, instead of germinating the maize to release the starches therein, the maize is ground, moistened by saliva in the chicha maker&#x27;s mouth, and formed into small balls, which are then flattened and laid out to dry. Naturally occurring ptyalin enzymes in the maker&#x27;s saliva catalyses the breakdown of starch in the maize into maltose. This process of chewing grains or other starches was used in the production of alcoholic beverages in pre-modern cultures around the world, including, for example, sake in Japan. &quot;Chicha&quot; prepared in this manner is known as &quot;chicha de muko&quot;.
Chicha morada is a non-fermented chicha usually made from ears of purple maize (&quot;maíz morado&quot;), which are boiled with pineapple rind, cinnamon, and cloves. This gives a strong, purple-colored liquid, which is then mixed with sugar and lemon. This beverage is usually taken as a refreshment. Chicha morada is common in Bolivian and Peruvian cultures and is generally drunk as an accompaniment to food.

Women are most associated with the production of chicha. Men and children are still involved with the process of making chicha, but women control the production and distribution. For many women in Andean society, making and selling chicha is a key part of their identity because it provides a substantial amount of political power and leverage.

=== Use ===

Chicha de jora has been prepared and consumed in communities throughout in the Andes for millennia. The Inca used chicha for ritual purposes and consumed it in vast quantities during religious festivals. Mills in which it was probably made were found at Machu Picchu.

During the Inca Empire women were taught the techniques of brewing chicha in Aqlla Wasi (feminine schools).

&quot;Chicherias&quot; (&quot;chicha&quot; taverns) were places to consume &quot;chicha&quot;. Many have historically been unlicensed, home-based businesses that produce &quot;chicha&quot; on site.

Normally sold in large &quot;caporal&quot; (1/2 liter) glasses to be drunk on location, or by liter, if taken home, chicha is generally sold straight from the earthenware &quot;chomba&quot; where it was brewed. On the Northern coast of Peru, it is often served in a dried gourd known as a Poto while in the Peruvian Andes it is often served in a qero. Qeros are traditionally made from wood with intricate designs carved on the outside. In colonial times qeros transitioned to be painted with figurative depictions on the exterior instead of carving. Some qeros were also made of metals and many are now made of glass. Inca leaders used identical pairs of qeros to extend invitations to drink. These invitations represented an indebtedness upon the invitee. In this way, the drinking of chicha via qeros cemented relationships of power and alliances between people and groups.

Chicha can be mixed with Coca Sek, a Colombian beverage made from coca leaf.

== Regional variations ==
There are a number of regional varieties of chicha, which can be roughly divided into lowland (Amazonia) and highland varieties, of which there are many.

=== Amazonia ===
Throughout the Amazon Basin (including the interiors of Ecuador, Peru, Colombia, and Brazil), chicha is usually made from cassava, but also cooking plantain is known to be used. Traditionally, the women chew the washed and peeled cassava and spit the juice into a bowl. Cassava root is very starchy, and therefore the enzymes in the preparer&#x27;s saliva rapidly convert the starch to simple sugar, which is further converted by wild yeast or bacteria into alcohol. After the juice has fermented in the bowl for a few hours, the result will be mildly sweet and sour chicha, similar in appearance to defatted milk. In Colombian Amazonia, the drink is called &quot;masato&quot;.

It is traditional for families to offer chicha to arriving guests. Children are offered new chicha that has not fermented, whereas adults are offered fermented chicha; the most highly fermented chicha, with its significant alcohol content, is reserved for men.

=== Bolivia ===
In Bolivia chicha is most often made from maize, especially in the highlands, but amaranth chicha is also traditional and popular. Chicha made from sweet manioc, plantain, or banana is also common in the lowlands. Bolivian chicha often has alcohol. A good description of the preparation of a Bolivian way to make chicha can be found in Cutler, Hugh and Martin Cardenas, &quot;Chicha a Native South American Beer&quot;.

=== Chile ===

In Chile, there are two main types of chicha: apple chicha produced in southern Chile and grape chicha produced in central Chile. Both are alcoholic beverages with no distillation, only fermentation. Chicha is mostly consumed in the countryside and during festivities, such as Fiestas Patrias on September 18. Chicha is usually not found in formal supermarkets unless close to September 18.

Sites like Máfil in southern Chile were traditional centres of apple chicha produce that was sold in the nearby city of Valdivia. With the introduction of beer by the German settlers who arrived in the second half of the 19th century the chicha production in Máfil declined and is now done by few and mostly for consumption within the family.

=== Colombia ===
In Bogotá, the capital of present-day Colombia, the recipe is simple; cooked maize is ground with black panela in a large pot. The mix is let to ferment for seven to eight days depending on the degree of liquor desired.
Chicha was outlawed in Colombia in 1949 and remains formally illegal, but brewing continued underground and the drink is openly available in some areas.

=== Ecuador ===
A major chicha beer festival, &quot;Yamor&quot;, is held in early September in Otavalo. It has its roots in the 1970s, when the locals decided to revive an ancient tradition of marking the maize harvest before the September equinox. These locals spoke Quechua, and &quot;Yamor&quot; was the name for chicha. The festival includes bands, parades, fireworks, and chicha sampling.

=== El Salvador ===
In El Salvador, &quot;chicha&quot; usually refers to an alcoholic drink made with maize, panela, and pineapple. It is used as a drink and also as an ingredient on many traditional dishes, such as &quot;gallo en chicha&quot;, a local version of coq au vin. A non-alcoholic version usually named &quot;fresco de chicha&quot; (chicha soft drink) is made with the same ingredients, but without allowing it to ferment.

=== Honduras ===
In Honduras, the Pech people practiced a ritual called Kesh where a shaman contacted the spiritual world. A Kesh could be held for various reasons, a few including to help appease the angry spirits or to help a deceased member of the community on his or her journey after death. During this ritual, they drank Chicha made of yuca, minia, and yuca tamales. The ritual is no longer practiced, but the drink is still reserved for special occasions with family only.

=== Nicaragua ===

In Managua and Granada, &quot;chicha de maiz&quot; is a typical drink, unfermented and served very cold. It is often flavored with banana or vanilla flavors, and its saleswomen can be heard calling &quot;¡Chicha, cafe y jugo frio!&quot; in the squares.

Nicaraguan &quot;chicha de maiz&quot; is made by soaking the corn in water overnight. On the following day it is ground and placed in water, red food coloring is added, and the whole mixture is cooked. Once cooled, sugar and more water is added. On the following day, one adds further water, sugar and flavoring. Although fermented chicha is available, the unfermented type is the most common.

=== Panama ===

In Panama, &quot;chicha&quot; can simply mean &quot;fruit drink&quot;. Unfermented chicha often is called &quot;batido&quot;, another name for any drink containing a fruit puree. Locally, among the Kuna or Gundetule of the San Blas chain of islands &quot;chicha fuerte&quot; refers to the fermented maize and Grandmother Saliva mixture, which chicha is enjoyed in special or Holy days. While chicha fuerte most traditionally refers to chicha made of germinated corn (germination helps to convert starch to sugar), any number of fruits can be fermented into unique, homemade versions of the beverage. In rural areas, chicha fuerte is the refreshment of choice during and after community work parties (&quot;juntas&quot;), as well as during community dances (&quot;tamboritos&quot;).

=== Peru ===
Chicha&#x27;s importance in the social and religious world of Latin America can best be seen by focusing on the drink&#x27;s central role in ancient Peru. Corn was considered a sacred crop, but Chicha, in particular, was considered very high status. Chicha was consumed in great quantities during and after the work of harvesting, making for a festive mood of singing, dancing, and joking. Chicha was offered to gods and ancestors, much like other fermented beverages around the world were. For example, at the Incan capital of Cuzco, the king poured chicha into a gold bowl at the navel of the universe, an ornamental stone dais with throne and pillar, in the central plaza. The chicha cascaded down this “gullet of the Sun God” to the Temple of Sun, as awestruck spectators watched the high god quaff the precious brew. At most festivals, ordinary people participated in days of prodigious drinking after the main feast, as the Spanish looked on aghast at the drunkenness.

Human sacrifices first had to be rubbed in the dregs of chicha, and then tube-fed with more chicha for days while lying buried alive in tombs. Special sacred places, scattered throughout the empire, and mummies of previous kings and ancestors were ritually bathed in maize flour and presented with chicha offerings, to the accompaniment of dancing and panpipe music. Even today, Peruvians sprinkle some chicha to “mother earth” from the communal cup when they sit down together to drink; the cup then proceeds in the order of each drinker&#x27;s social status, as an unending succession of toasts are offered.

=== Venezuela ===

In Venezuela chicha or &quot;chicha de arroz&quot; is made of boiled rice, milk, sugar; it is generally of white color and has the consistency of eggnog. It is usually served as a sweet, refreshing beverage with ground cinnamon or condensed milk toppings. This &quot;chicha de arroz&quot; contains no alcohol as it is not fermented. Sometimes it is made with pasta or semolina instead of rice and is commonly called &quot;chicha de pasta&quot;.

In most large cities, chicha is offered by street vendors, commonly referred to as &quot;chicheros&quot;; these vendors usually use a flour-like mix and just add water, and generally serve them with chopped ice and a straw and may ask to add cinnamon, chocolate chips or sugared condensed milk on top. It can also be found in commercial presentations just like milk and juices. The Venezuelan Andean regions (such as Mérida) prepare an alternative version, with added fermented pineapple, which has a more liquory taste. This variety is commonly referred to as &quot;Chicha Andina&quot; and is a typical Christmastime beverage.

== Significance in Inca society ==

=== Identity ===
Chicha use can reveal how people perceive their own cultural identity and express ideas about gender, race, nationality, and community. Chicha use contributes to how people build community and a collective identity for maintaining social networks. It is often consumed in the context of feasts and festivals, which are valuable contexts for strengthening social and cultural connections. The production and consumption of chicha contributes to social organization and can affect social status.

===Rites of passage===
Chicha consumption included its use in rites of passage for indigenous peoples such as the Incas. Chicha was important in ceremonies for adolescent boys coming of age, especially for the sons of Inca nobility. Young men would get their adult names in ceremonies using chicha. One thing that these boys did was to go on a pilgrimage to mountains such as Huanacauri that had significant meaning. Boys did this about a month before a ceremony honoring . After the pilgrimage, the boys chewed maize to make the chicha they would drink at the end of the month-long ceremony. One activity was running down the side of a mountain to get a &quot;&quot; of chicha given to them by young women in order to encourage them.

===Women&#x27;s role===
The use of chicha can also be seen when looking at women who lived during the Incas reign before the arrival of the Spanish. Women were important to the community of the Incas. There was a select group of women that would receive formal instruction, these women were the &quot;aclla&quot;, also known as &quot;Chosen Women&quot;. This group of women was extracted from their family-homes and taken to the &quot;acllahuasi&quot; or &quot;House of the Chosen Women&quot;. These women were dedicated to Inca religion, weaving, cooking and chicha-brewing. Much of the chicha they brewed would go to ceremonies, or when the community would get together to worship their god. They started the chicha process by chewing maize to create mushy texture that would be fermented. The product of the &quot;acllas&quot; was considered sacred because of the women who produced it. This was a special privilege that many women did not have except for the &quot;most attractive women.&quot;

===Perceptions by the Inca royalty===
The Incas themselves show the importance of chicha. The lords or royalty probably drank chicha from silver and gold cups known as &quot;keros&quot;. Also, after defeating an enemy Inca rulers would have heads of the defeated enemy converted into cup to drink chicha from. An example of this could be seen when Atawallpa drank chicha from opposing foes skull. By doing this it showed how superior the Incas themselves were to by leading their army to victory and chicha was at the forefront. After major military victories the Incas would celebrate by drinking chicha. When the Incas and the Spanish conquistadors met, the conquistadors would not understand the significance of chicha. Titu Cusi explains how his uncle, Atahualpa reacted when the intruders did not respect chicha. Kusi says, &quot;The Spaniard, upon receiving the drink in his hand, spilled it which greatly angered my uncle. And after that, the two Spaniards showed my uncle a letter, or book, or something, saying that this was the inscription of God and the King and my uncle, as he felt offended by the spilling of the chicha, took the letter and knocked to the ground saying: I don&#x27;t know what you have given me. Go on, leave.&quot; Another instance like this occurred between Atawallpa and the Spanish, it left with Atawallpa saying, &quot;Since you don&#x27;t respect me I won&#x27;t respect you either.&quot; This story recorded by Titu Cusi shows the significant relationship the Incas had with chicha. If someone insulted this beverage they would take it personally because it offended their beliefs and community.

===Economy===
In the economy of the Incas, there was not an exchange of currencies. Rather, the economy depended on trading products, the exchanging of services, and the Inca distributing items out to the people that work for him. Chicha that was produced by men along the coastline in order to trade or present to their Inca. This differed from the women that were producing the chicha inland because they were doing so for community gathers and other important ceremonies. Relationships were important in the Inca community and good relations with the Inca could allow a family to be provided with supplementary goods that not everyone had access to. The Inca would give chicha to families and to the men that that contributed to mit&#x27;a.

In the economy of the Incas it was important that there was a steady flow of chicha, amongst other goods that were important to everyday life. In the fields of the Andes, there was special emphasis where maize would be planted and it was taken seriously where the maize fields would be located. &quot;Agricultural rituals linked the production of maize to the liquid transfer of power in society with chicha.&quot; The ability to plant maize showed an important social role someone had amongst their community. Due to the significance of planting maize, the state would probably be in charge of these farms. The significance of drinking chicha together as a community was another important aspect to the way the Incas went about everyday life. It was incorporated into the meals that the Incas ate.

===Religious purposes===
The production of chicha was a necessity to all because it was a sacred item to the people. &quot;Among the Incas, corn was a divine gift to humanity, and its consumption as a fermented beverage in political meetings formed communion between those where drinking and the ancestors, the and the entirety of the Inca cosmology.&quot; This beverage allowed the people to go back to the story of creation and be reminded of the creator god Wiraqocha. The Incas saw this beverage in sexual way because of the way the earth produced for them. The Incas saw chicha as semen and when dumped onto the Earth they thought that they were feeding the Earth.

<text>A moldmaker (mouldmaker in English-speaking countries other than the US) or molder (moulder) is a skilled tradesperson who fabricates &quot;molds&quot; (or &quot;moulds&quot;) for use in casting metal products. 

Moldmakers are generally employed in foundries, where molds are used to cast products from metals such as aluminium and cast iron.

== Injection molding ==
The term moldmaker may also be used to describe workers employed in fabricating dies and metal moulds for use in injection molding and die-casting, such as in the plastics, rubber or ceramics industries, in which case it is sometimes regarded as a branch of the trade of toolmaker. The process of manufacturing molds is often highly automated.

Although many of the machining processes involved in mold making use computer-controlled equipment for the manufacturing of molds (particularly plastic and rubber injection and transfer), moldmaking remains a highly skilled trade, requiring expertise in manual machining, CNC machining, CNC wire EDM, CNC Ram EDM, surface grinding, hand polishing and more. Because of the skill and intense labor involved, a lot of mold making in the US has been outsourced to low-wage countries. The majority of plastic and rubber parts are made using injection or transfer molds, requiring a mold to be manufactured by a moldmaker.

<text>The Wenatchee River is a river in the U.S. state of Washington, originating at Lake Wenatchee and flowing southeast for , emptying into the Columbia River immediately north of Wenatchee, Washington. On its way it passes the towns of Plain, Leavenworth, Peshastin, Dryden, Cashmere, Monitor, and Wenatchee, all within Chelan County. The river attracts kayaking and river rafting enthusiasts and tourism.

Tributaries include the Chiwawa River, Nason Creek, Peshastin Creek, and Icicle Creek. Its drainage basin is in area.

==History==
Historically the dividing line between Okanogan County and Kittitas County, the river has been in the center of Chelan County since the county&#x27;s formation around 1899.

Water from the Wenatchee River and its tributaries has been diverted for irrigation since 1891, mainly for orchards. There are two small dams on the Wenatchee River, the Tumwater Canyon Dam, which sits just west of the community of Leavenworth, and the Dryden dam, a low-head dam situated just outside the town of Dryden. The Tumwater Canyon dam originally provided power to the original -long railroad tunnel used near Stevens Pass to get trains across the Cascade Mountains, it was later (starting in 1928) used to power the railroad&#x27;s electrification from Wenatchee to Skykomish.

==Pollution==
Toxic chemicals banned decades ago in Washington continue to linger in the environment and concentrate in the food chain, threatening people and the environment, according to three recent studies by the Washington state Department of Ecology. In 2007, the Washington Department of Health advised the public to not eat mountain whitefish from the Wenatchee River from Leavenworth downstream to where the river joins the Columbia, due to unhealthy levels of PCBs.

<doc id="353765" wikidata="Q270680" url="?curid=353765" title="Little crake">
<text>The little crake (Zapornia parva) is a very small waterbird of the family Rallidae. &quot;parva&quot; is Latin for &quot;small&quot;. This species was long included in the genus &quot;Porzana&quot;.

Its breeding habitat is reed beds in Europe, mainly in the east, and just into western Asia. This species is migratory, wintering in Africa.

At in length, they are slightly smaller than the spotted crake, from which they are readily distinguished by the lack of dark barring and white spots on the flanks. The little crake has a short straight bill, yellow with a red base. They have green legs with long toes, and a short tail which is barred black and white underneath. Unlike other &quot;Zapornia&quot; crakes, this species has strong sexual dimorphism: Adult males have mainly brown upperparts and blue-grey face and underparts. They resemble the sympatric Baillon&#x27;s crake (&quot;Z. pusilla&quot;), which has strongly barred flanks and is a little smaller. Females have buff underparts, and are grey only on the face; they are more similar to the yellow-breasted crake (&quot;Z. flaviventer&quot;) of the American tropics. Immature little crakes are similar to the female but have a white face and breast. The downy chicks are black, as with all rails.

These birds probe with their bill in mud or shallow water, also picking up food by sight. They mainly eat insects and aquatic animals. Little crakes are very secretive in the breeding season, and are then mostly heard rather than seen. They can be easier to see on migration. They are then noisy birds, with a yapping &quot;kua&quot; call. They nest in a dry location in reed vegetation, laying 4–7 eggs.

The little crake is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

<doc id="353767" wikidata="Q930391" url="?curid=353767" title="Grand Coulee Dam">
<text>Grand Coulee Dam is a concrete gravity dam on the Columbia River in the U.S. state of Washington, built to produce hydroelectric power and provide irrigation water. Constructed between 1933 and 1942, Grand Coulee originally had two powerhouses. The third powerhouse (&quot;Nat&quot;), completed in 1974 to increase energy production, makes Grand Coulee the largest power station in the United States by nameplate capacity at 6,809 MW.

The proposal to build the dam was the focus of a bitter debate during the 1920s between two groups. One group wanted to irrigate the ancient Grand Coulee with a gravity canal while the other pursued a high dam and pumping scheme. The dam supporters won in 1933, but, although they fully intended otherwise, the initial proposal by the Bureau of Reclamation was for a &quot;low dam&quot; tall which would generate electricity without supporting irrigation. That year, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and a consortium of three companies called MWAK (Mason-Walsh-Atkinson Kier Company) began construction on a high dam, although they had received approval for a low dam. After visiting the construction site in August 1934, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt endorsed the &quot;high dam&quot; design, which at high would provide enough electricity to pump water into the Columbia basin for irrigation. Congress approved the high dam in 1935, and it was completed in 1942. The first waters overtopped Grand Coulee&#x27;s spillway on of that year.

Power from the dam fueled the growing industries of the Northwest United States during World War II. Between 1967 and 1974, the third powerplant was constructed. The decision to construct the additional facility was influenced by growing energy demand, regulated river flows stipulated in the Columbia River Treaty with Canada, and competition with the Soviet Union. Through a series of upgrades and the installation of pump-generators, the dam now supplies four power stations with an installed capacity of 6,809 MW. As the centerpiece of the Columbia Basin Project, the dam&#x27;s reservoir supplies water for the irrigation of .

The reservoir is called Franklin Delano Roosevelt Lake, named after the president who endorsed the dam&#x27;s construction. Creation of the reservoir forced the relocation of over 3,000 people, including Native Americans whose lands were partially flooded. The dam was constructed without fish passage. The next one downstream, Chief Joseph Dam, which was built decades later, also does not have fish passage. This means no salmon reach the Grand Coulee Dam or the Colville Indian Reservation. The third large dam downstream, Wells Dam, has an intricate system of fish ladders to accommodate yearly salmon spawning and migration.

==Background==
The Grand Coulee is an ancient river bed on the Columbia Plateau created during the Pliocene Epoch (Calabrian) by retreating glaciers and floods. Originally, geologists believed a glacier that diverted the Columbia River formed the Grand Coulee, but it was revealed in the mid-late 20th century that massive floods from Lake Missoula carved most of the gorge. The earliest known proposal to irrigate the Grand Coulee with the Columbia River dates to 1892, when the &quot;Coulee City News&quot; and &quot;The Spokesman Review&quot; reported on a scheme by a man named Laughlin McLean to construct a dam across the Columbia River, high enough that water would back up into the Grand Coulee. A dam that size would have its reservoir encroach into Canada, which would violate treaties. Soon after the Bureau of Reclamation was founded, it investigated a scheme for pumping water from the Columbia River to irrigate parts of central Washington. An attempt to raise funds for irrigation failed in 1914, as Washington voters rejected a bond measure.

In 1917, William M. Clapp, a lawyer from Ephrata, Washington, proposed the Columbia be dammed immediately below the Grand Coulee. He suggested a concrete dam could flood the plateau, just as nature blocked it with ice centuries ago. Clapp was joined by James O&#x27;Sullivan, another lawyer, and by Rufus Woods, publisher of &quot;The Wenatchee World&quot; newspaper in the nearby agricultural centre of Wenatchee. Together, they became known as the &quot;Dam College&quot;. Woods began promoting the Grand Coulee Dam in his newspaper, often with articles written by O&#x27;Sullivan.

The dam idea gained popularity with the public in 1918. Backers of reclamation in Central Washington split into two camps. The &quot;pumpers&quot; favored a dam with pumps to elevate water from the river into the Grand Coulee from which canals and pipes could irrigate farmland. The &quot;ditchers&quot; favored diverting water from northeast Washington&#x27;s Pend Oreille River via a gravity canal to irrigate farmland in Central and Eastern Washington. Many locals such as Woods, O&#x27;Sullivan and Clapp were pumpers, while many influential businessmen in Spokane associated with the Washington Water and Power Company (WWPC) were staunch ditchers. The pumpers argued that hydroelectricity from the dam could cover costs and claimed the ditchers sought to maintain a monopoly on electric power.

The ditchers took several steps to ensure support for their proposals. In 1921, WWPC secured a preliminary permit to build a dam at Kettle Falls, about upstream from the Grand Coulee. If built, the Kettle Falls Dam would have lain in the path of the Grand Coulee Dam&#x27;s reservoir, essentially blocking its construction. WWPC planted rumors in the newspapers, stating exploratory drilling at the Grand Coulee site found no granite on which a dam&#x27;s foundations could rest, only clay and fragmented rock. This was later disproved with Reclamation-ordered drilling. Ditchers hired General George W. Goethals, engineer of the Panama Canal, to prepare a report. Goethals visited the state and produced a report backing the ditchers. The Bureau of Reclamation was unimpressed by Goethals&#x27; report, believing it filled with errors. 

In , President Warren G. Harding visited Washington state and expressed support for irrigation work there, but died a month later. His successor, Calvin Coolidge, had little interest in irrigation projects. The Bureau of Reclamation, desirous of a major project that would bolster its reputation, was focusing on the Boulder Canyon Project that resulted in the Hoover Dam. Reclamation was authorized to conduct a study in 1923, but the project&#x27;s cost made federal officials reluctant. The Washington state proposals received little support from those further east, who feared the irrigation would result in more crops, depressing prices. With President Coolidge opposed to the project, bills to appropriate money for surveys of the Grand Coulee site failed.
In 1925, Congress authorized a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers study of the Columbia River. This study was included in the Rivers and Harbors Act of , which provided for studies on the navigation, power, flood control and irrigation potential of rivers. In , the Army Corps responded with the first of the &quot;308 Reports&quot; named after the 1925 House Document No. 308 (69th Congress, 1st Session). With the help of Washington&#x27;s Senators, Wesley Jones and Clarence Dill, Congress ordered $600,000 in further studies to be carried out by the Army Corps and Federal Power Commission on the Columbia River Basin and Snake Rivers. U.S. Army Major John Butler was responsible for the upper Columbia River and Snake River and in 1932, his 1,000-page report was submitted to Congress. It recommended the Grand Coulee Dam and nine others on the river, including some in Canada. The report stated electricity sales from the Grand Coulee Dam could pay for construction costs. Reclamation—whose interest in the dam was revitalized by the report—endorsed it.

Although there was support for the Grand Coulee Dam, others argued there was little need for more electricity in the Northwest and crops were in surplus. The Army Corps did not believe construction should be a federal project and saw low demand for electricity. Reclamation argued energy demand would rise by the time the dam was complete. The head of Reclamation, Elwood Mead, stated he wanted the dam built no matter the cost. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who took office in March 1933, supported the dam because of its irrigation potential and the power it would provide, but he was uneasy with its price tag. For this reason, he supported a &quot;low dam&quot; instead of the &quot;high dam&quot;. He provided in federal funding, while Washington State provided $377,000. In 1933, Washington governor Clarence Martin set up the Columbia Basin Commission to oversee the dam project, and Reclamation was selected to oversee construction.

==Construction==

===Low dam===

On July 16, 1933, a crowd of 3,000 watched the driving of the first stake at the low dam site, and excavation soon began. Core drilling commenced that September while the Bureau of Reclamation accelerated its studies and designs for the dam. It would still help control floods and provide for irrigation and hydroelectricity, though at a reduced capacity. Most importantly, it would not raise its reservoir high enough to irrigate the plateau around the Grand Coulee. The dam&#x27;s design provided for future raising and upgrading.
Before and during construction, workers and engineers experienced problems. Contracts for companies to construct the various parts of the dam were difficult to award as few companies were sizable enough to fill them. This forced companies to consolidate. Native American graves had to be relocated and temporary fish ladders had to be constructed. During construction additional problems included landslides and the need to protect newly poured concrete from freezing. Construction on the downstream Grand Coulee Bridge began in and more considerable earth-moving began in August. Excavation for the dam&#x27;s foundation required the removal of 22 million cubic yards (17 million m³) of dirt and stone. 

To reduce the amount of trucking required in the excavation, a conveyor belt nearly long was built. To further secure the foundation, workers drilled holes into the granite and filled any fissures with grout, creating a grout curtain. At times, excavated areas collapsed from overburden. In order to secure these areas from further movement and continue excavation, diameter pipes were inserted into the mass and chilled with cold liquid from a refrigeration plant. This froze the earth and secured it so construction could continue.

Final contract bidding for the dam began , 1934, in Spokane, and four bids were submitted. One bid was from a lawyer with no financial backing; another was from actress Mae West which consisted of nothing more than a poem and promise to divert the river. Of the two serious bids, the lowest bid was from a consortium of three companies: Silas Mason Co. from Louisville, Kentucky; Walsh Construction Co. of Davenport, Iowa and New York; and Atkinson-Kier Company of San Francisco and San Diego. The consortium was known as MWAK, and their bid was $29,339,301, almost 15% lower than the option submitted by the next bidder, Six Companies, Inc., which was building Hoover Dam at the time.

===Cofferdams===
Two large cofferdams were constructed for the dam, but they were parallel to the river rather than straddling its width, so drilling into the canyon walls was not required. By the end of 1935 about 1,200 workers completed the west and east cofferdams. The west cofferdam was long, thick and was constructed above the bedrock. The cofferdams allowed workers to dry portions of the riverbed and begin constructing the dam, while water continued to flow down the center of the riverbed. 

In , once the west foundation was complete, portions of the west cofferdam were dismantled, allowing water to flow through part of the dam&#x27;s new foundation. In , MWAK had begun constructing cofferdams above and below the channel between the east and west cofferdams. By December, the entire Columbia River was diverted over the foundations constructed within the east and west cofferdams. On , 1936, the &quot;Wenatchee Daily World&quot; announced the river was diverted and by early the next year, people were arriving in large numbers to see the riverbed.

===Design change===

On August 4, 1934, President Franklin D. Roosevelt visited the construction site and was impressed by the project and its purpose. He spoke to workers and spectators, closing with this statement: &quot;I leave here today with the feeling that this work is well undertaken; that we are going ahead with a useful project, and we are going to see it through for the benefit of our country.&quot; Soon afterward, Reclamation was allowed to proceed with the high dam plan but faced the problems of transitioning the design and negotiating an altered contract with MWAK. In , for an additional , MWAK and Six Companies, Inc. agreed to join together as Consolidated Builders Inc. and construct the high dam. Six Companies had just finished the Hoover Dam and was nearing completion of Parker Dam. The new design, chosen and approved by the Reclamation office in Denver, included several improvements, one of which was the irrigation pumping plant.

Roosevelt envisioned the dam would fit into his New Deal under the Public Works Administration; it would create jobs and farming opportunities and would pay for itself. In addition, as part of a larger public effort, Roosevelt wanted to keep electricity prices low by limiting private ownership of utility companies, which could charge high prices for energy. Many opposed a federal takeover of the project, including its most prominent supporters, but Washington State lacked the resources to fully realize the project. In , with the help of Roosevelt and a Supreme Court decision allowing the acquisition of public land and Indian Reservations, Congress authorized funding for the upgraded high dam under the 1935 River and Harbors Act. The most significant legislative hurdle for the dam was over:

===First concrete pour and completion===

On December 6, 1935, Governor Clarence Martin presided over the ceremonial first concrete pour. During construction, bulk concrete was delivered on site by rail-cars where it was further processed by eight large mixers before being placed in form. Concrete was poured into columns by crane-lifted buckets, each supporting eight tons of concrete. To cool the concrete and facilitate curing, about of piping was placed throughout the hardening mass. Cold water from the river was pumped into the pipes, reducing the temperature within the forms from to . This caused the dam to contract about in length; the resulting gaps were filled with grout.

Until the project began, the stretch of the Columbia River where the dam was to rise was as yet unbridged, making it difficult to move men and materials. In , the Grand Coulee Bridge, a permanent highway bridge, was opened after major delays caused by high water. Three additional and temporary bridges downstream had moved vehicles and workers along with sand and gravel for cement mixing. In , MWAK completed the lower dam and Consolidated Builders Inc. began constructing the high dam. In , the west power house was completed. About 5,500 workers were on site that year. Between 1940 and 1941, the dam&#x27;s eleven floodgates were installed on the spillway. In , the dam&#x27;s first generator went into operation. On , 1942, the reservoir was full and the first water flowed over the dam&#x27;s spillway. On , 1943, work was officially complete. The last of the original 18 generators did not operate until 1949.

===Reservoir clearing===

In 1933, Reclamation began efforts to purchase land behind the dam as far as upstream for the future reservoir zone. The reservoir, known later as Lake Roosevelt, flooded and Reclamation acquired an additional around the future shoreline. Within the zone were eleven towns, two railroads, three state highways, about one hundred and fifty miles of country roads, four sawmills, fourteen bridges, four telegraph and telephone systems, and many power lines and cemeteries. All facilities had to be purchased or relocated, and 3,000 residents were relocated. The Anti-Speculation Act was passed in 1937, limiting the amount of land farmers could own to prevent inflated prices. 

The government appraised the land and offered to purchase it from the affected residents. Many refused to accept the offers, and Reclamation filed condemnation suits. Members of the Colville Confederated and Spokane tribes who had settlements within the reservoir zone were also resettled. The Acquisition of Indian Lands for Grand Coulee Dam Act of , 1940, allowed the Secretary of the Interior to acquire land on the Colville and Spokane Reservations, eventually accounting for . By 1942, all land had been purchased at market value: a cost of that included the relocation of farms, bridges, highways and railroads. Relocation reimbursement was not offered to property owners, which was common until U.S. laws changed in 1958.

In late 1938, the Works Progress Administration began clearing what would be of trees and other plants. The cut timber was floated downstream and sold to the highest bidder, Lincoln Lumber Company, which paid $2.25 per thousand board feet, . The pace of clearing was accelerated in when it was declared a national defense project, and the last tree was felled on , 1941. The felling was done by Reclamation Supervising Engineer Frank A. Banks and State WPA Administrator Carl W. Smith during a ceremony. 2,626 people living in five main camps along the Columbia worked on the project. When it was finished, had been spent in labor.

===Labor and supporting infrastructure===

Workers building the dam received an average of 80¢ an hour; the payroll for the dam was among the largest in the nation. The workers were mainly pulled from Grant, Lincoln, Douglas, and Okanogan counties and women were allowed to work only in the dorms and the cookhouse. Around 8,000 people worked on the project, and Frank A. Banks served as the chief construction engineer. Bert A. Hall was the chief inspector who would accept the dam from the contractors. Orin G. Patch served as the chief of concrete. Construction conditions were dangerous and 77 workers died.

To prepare for construction, housing for workers was needed along with four bridges downstream of the dam site, one of which, the Grand Coulee Bridge, exists today. The Bureau of Reclamation provided housing and located their administrative building at Engineer&#x27;s Town, which was directly downstream of the construction site on the west side of the river. Opposite Engineer&#x27;s Town, MWAK constructed Mason City in 1934. Mason City contained a hospital, post office, electricity and other amenities along with a population of 3,000. Three-bedroom houses in the city were rented for $32 a month. 

Of the two living areas, Engineer&#x27;s City was considered to have the better housing. Several other living areas formed around the construction site in an area known as Shack Town, which did not have reliable access to electricity and the same amenities as the other towns. Incorporated in 1935, the city of Grand Coulee supported workers as well and is just west of the dam on the plateau. MWAK eventually sold Mason City to Reclamation in 1937 before its contract was completed. In 1956, Reclamation combined both Mason City and Engineer&#x27;s Town to form the city of Coulee Dam. It was incorporated as a city in .

===Irrigation pumps===
With the onset of World War II, power generation was given priority over irrigation. In 1943, Congress authorized the Columbia Basin Project and the Bureau of Reclamation began construction of irrigation facilities in 1948. Directly to the west and above the Grand Coulee Dam, the North Dam was constructed. This dam, along with the Dry Falls Dam to the south, enclosed and created Banks Lake, which covered the northern of the Grand Coulee. Additional dams, such as the Pinto and O&#x27;Sullivan Dams, were constructed alongside siphons and canals, creating a vast irrigation supply network called the Columbia Basin Project. Irrigation began between 1951 and 1953 as six of the 12 pumps were installed and Banks Lake was filled.

==Expansion==

===Third powerplant===


After World War II, the growing demand for electricity sparked interest in constructing another power plant supported by the Grand Coulee Dam. One obstacle to an additional power plant was the great seasonality of the Columbia River&#x27;s streamflow. Today the flow is closely managed—there is almost no seasonality. Historically, about 75% of the river&#x27;s annual flow occurred between April and September. During low flow periods, the river&#x27;s discharge was between and while maximum spring runoff flows were around . Only nine out of the dam&#x27;s eighteen generators could run year-round. The remaining nine operated for less than six months a year. In 1952, Congress authorized $125,000 for Reclamation to conduct a feasibility study on the Third Powerplant which was completed in 1953 and recommended two locations. Nine identical 108 MW generators were recommended, but as matters stood, they would be able to operate only in periods of high water.

Further regulation of the Columbia&#x27;s flows was necessary to make the new power plant feasible. It would require water storage and regulation projects in Canada and a treaty to resolve the many economic and political issues involved. The Bureau of Reclamation and Army Corps of Engineers explored alternatives that would not depend on a treaty with Canada, such as raising the level of Flathead Lake or Pend Oreille Lake, but both proposals faced strong local opposition. The Columbia River Treaty, which had been discussed between the U.S. and Canada since 1944, was seen as the answer. Efforts to build the Third Powerplant were also influenced by competition with the Soviet Union, which had constructed power plants on the Volga River larger than Grand Coulee. 

On , 1964, the Columbia River Treaty was ratified and included an agreement by Canada to construct the Duncan, Keenleyside, Mica Dams upstream and the U.S. would build the Libby Dam in Montana. Shortly afterward, Washington Senator Henry M. Jackson, who was influential in constructing the new power plant, announced Reclamation would present the project to Congress for appropriation and funding. To keep up with Soviet competition and increase the generating capacity it was determined the generators could be upgraded to much larger designs. With the possibility of international companies bidding on the project, the Soviets who had just installed a 500 MW hydroelectric generator on the Yenisei River indicated their interest. To avoid the potential embarrassment of an international rival building a domestic power plant, the Department of the Interior declined international bidding. The Third Powerplant was approved and President Lyndon Johnson signed its appropriation bill on , 1966.

Between 1967 and 1974, the dam was expanded to add the Third Powerplant, with architectural design by Marcel Breuer. Beginning in , this involved demolishing the northeast side of the dam and building a new fore-bay section. The excavation of of dirt and rock had been completed before the new long section of dam was built. The addition made the original dam almost a mile long. Original designs for the powerhouse had twelve smaller units but were altered to incorporate six of the largest generators available. To supply them with water, six diameter penstocks were installed. Of the new turbines and generators, three 600 MW units were built by Westinghouse and three 700 MW units by General Electric. The first new generator was commissioned in 1975 and the final one in 1980. The three 700 MW units were later upgraded to 805 MW by Siemens.

===Pump-generating plant===

After power shortages in the Northwest during the 1960s, it was determined the six remaining planned pumps be pump-generators. When energy demand is high, the pump-generators can generate electricity with water from the Banks Lake feeder canal adjacent to the dam at a higher elevation. By 1973, the Pump-Generating Plant was completed and the first two generators (P/G-7 and P/G-8) were operational. In 1983, two more generators went online, and by the final two were operational. The six pump-generators added 314 MW to the dam&#x27;s capacity. In , the Pump-Generating Plant was officially renamed the John W. Keys III Pump-Generating Power Plant after John W. Keys III, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation&#x27;s commissioner from 2001 to 2006.

===Overhauls===

A major overhaul of the Third Powerplant, which contains generators numbered G19 through G24, began in and will be continuing for many years. Among the projects to be completed before the generators themselves can begin to be overhauled include replacing underground 500 kV oil-filled cables for G19, G20 and G21 generators with overhead transmission lines (started in ), new 236 MW transformers for G19 and G20 (started in ), and several other projects. 

Planning, design, procurement and site preparation for the 805 MW G22, G23 and G24 generator overhauls are scheduled to begin in 2011. The overhauls will start in 2013 with the G22 generator, then G23 starting in 2014, and finally G24 starting in 2016, with planned completions in 2014, 2016 and 2017, respectively. The generator overhauls for G19, G20 and G21 have not been scheduled as of 2010.

==Operation and benefits==

The dam&#x27;s primary goal, irrigation, was postponed as the wartime need for electricity increased. The dam&#x27;s powerhouse began production around the time World War II began, and its electricity was vital to the war effort. The dam powered aluminum smelters in Longview and Vancouver, Washington, Boeing factories in Seattle and Vancouver, and Portland&#x27;s shipyards. In 1943, its electricity was also used for plutonium production in Richland, Washington, at the Hanford Site, which was part of the top-secret Manhattan Project. The demand for power at that project was so great that in 1943, two generators originally intended for the Shasta Dam in California were installed at Grand Coulee to hurry the generator installation schedule.

===Irrigation===

Water is pumped via the Pump-Generating Plant&#x27;s diameter pipes from Lake Roosevelt to a feeder canal. From the feeder canal, the water is transferred to Banks Lake which has an active storage of . The plant&#x27;s twelve pumps can transfer up to to the lake. Currently, the Columbia Basin Project irrigates with a potential for . Over 60 different crops are grown within the project and distributed throughout the United States.

===Power===
Grand Coulee Dam supports four different power houses containing 33 hydroelectric generators. The original Left and Right Powerhouses contain 18 main generators and the Left has an additional three service generators for total installed capacity of 2,280 MW. The first generator was commissioned in 1941 and all 18 were operating by 1950. The Third Power plant contains a total of six main generators with a 4,215 MW installed capacity. Generators G-19, G-20 and G-21 in the Third Power Plant have a 600 MW installed capacity but can operate at a maximum capacity of 690 MW which brings the overall maximum capacity of the dam&#x27;s power facilities to 7,079 MW. The Pump-Generating Plant contains six pump-generators with an installed capacity of 314 MW. When pumping water into Banks Lake they consume 600 MW of electricity. Each generator is supplied with water by an individual penstock. The largest of these feed the Third Power Plant and are in diameter and can supply up to . The dam&#x27;s power facilities originally had an installed capacity of 1,974 MW but expansions and upgrades have increased generation to 6,809 MW installed, 7,079 MW maximum. Grand Coulee Dam generates 21 TWh of electricity annually. This means the dam generates about 2,397 MW of power on average, which results in a total plant factor efficiency of 35%. In 2014, 20.24 TWh of electricity was generated.

===Spillway===
Grand Coulee Dam&#x27;s spillway is long and is an overflow, drum-gate controlled type with a maximum capacity. A record flood in May and flooded the lowlands below the dam and highlighted its limited flood control capability at the time, as its spillway and turbines hit a record flow of . The flood damaged downstream riverbanks and deteriorated the face of the dam and its flip bucket at the base (toe) of the spillway. The flood spurred the Columbia River Treaty and its provisions for dams constructed upstream in Canada, which would regulate the Columbia&#x27;s flow.

===Cost benefits===
The Bureau of Reclamation in 1932 estimated the cost of constructing Grand Coulee Dam (not including the Third Powerplant) to be $168 million; its actual cost was $163 million in 1943 ($ in dollars). Expenses to finish the power stations and repair design flaws with the dam throughout the 1940s and &#x27;50s added another $107 million, bringing the total cost to $270 million ($ in dollars), about 33% over estimates. The Third Powerplant was estimated to cost in 1967, but higher construction costs and labor disputes drove the project&#x27;s final cost in 1973 to ($ in dollars), about 87% over estimates. Despite estimates being exceeded, the dam became an economic success, particularly with the Third Powerplant exhibiting a benefit-cost ratio of 2:1. Although Reclamation has only irrigated about half of the land predicted, the gross value of crop output (in constant dollars) had doubled from 1962 to 1992, largely due to different farming practices and crop choices. The Bureau expects the money earned from supplying power and irrigation water will pay off the cost of construction by 2044.

==Environmental and social consequences==
The dam had severe negative consequences for the local Native American tribes whose traditional way of life revolved around salmon and the original shrub steppe habitat of the area. Because it lacks a fish ladder, Grand Coulee Dam permanently blocks fish migration, removing over of natural spawning habitat. By largely eliminating anadromous fish above the Okanogan River, the Grand Coulee Dam also set the stage for the subsequent decision not to provide for fish passage at Chief Joseph Dam (built in 1953). Chinook, Steelhead, Sockeye and Coho salmon (as well as other important species, including Lamprey) are now unable to spawn in the reaches of the Upper Columbia Basin. The lack of fish passage to the upper reaches of the Columbia River wiped out the June hogs, so-called &quot;supersalmon&quot; known to regularly weigh over 80 pounds (36kg). Today, the largest Chinook caught on the Columbia River are not even half that size. The extinction of the spawning grounds upstream from the dam has prevented the Spokane and other tribes from holding sacred salmon ceremonies since 1940.

Grand Coulee Dam flooded over 21,000 acres (85 km2) of prime bottom land where Native Americans had been living and hunting for thousands of years, forcing the relocation of settlements and graveyards. The Office of Indian Affairs negotiated with the United States Bureau of Reclamation on behalf of tribes who were concerned about the flooding of their grave sites. The Acquisition of Indian Lands for Grand Coulee Dam, 54 Stat.703 Act of June 20, 1940, allowed the Secretary of the Interior to remove human remains to new Native American grave sites. The burial relocation project started in September 1939. Human remains were put into small containers and many artifacts were discovered, but the methods of collection destroyed archaeological evidence. Various estimates for the number of relocated graves in 1939 include 915 graves reported by the Bureau of Reclamation Reclamation, or 1,388 reported by Howard T. Ball, who supervised the field work. Tribal leaders reported another 2,000 graves in 1940, but the Bureau of Reclamation would not continue grave relocation, and the sites were soon covered by water.

The town of Inchelium, Washington, home to around 250 Colville Indians, was submerged and later relocated. Kettle Falls, once a primary Native American fishing grounds, was also inundated. The average catch of over 600,000 salmon per year was eliminated. In one study, the Army Corps of Engineers estimated the annual loss was over fish. In , the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation hosted a three-day event called the &quot;Ceremony of Tears&quot;, marking the end of fishing at Kettle Falls. Within a year after the Ceremony, the falls were inundated. The town of Kettle Falls, Washington, was relocated.

The Columbia Basin Project has affected habitat ranges for species such as mule deer, pygmy rabbits and burrowing owls, resulting in decreased populations. However, it has created new habitats such as wetlands, and riparian corridors. The environmental impact of the dam effectively ended the traditional way of life of the native inhabitants. The government eventually compensated the Colville Indians in the 1990s with a lump settlement of approximately , plus annual payments of approximately . In 2019, a bill was passed to provide additional compensation to the Spokane Tribe. It provides roughly annually for the first decade, followed by roughly a year after that.

To compensate for the lack of ladder, three fisheries have been created above the dam, releasing into the upper Columbia River. One half of the fish are reserved for the displaced tribes, and one quarter of the reservoir is reserved for tribal hunting and boating.

==Tourism==
Built in the late 1970s, the Visitor Center contains many historical photos, geological samples, turbine and dam models, and a theater. The building was designed by Marcel Breuer and resembles a generator rotor. Since , on summer evenings, the laser light show at Grand Coulee Dam is projected onto the dam&#x27;s wall. The show includes full-size images of battleships and the Statue of Liberty, as well as some environmental comments. Tours of the Third Power Plant are available to the public and last about an hour. Visitors take a shuttle to view the generators and also travel across the main dam span (otherwise closed to the public) as the formerly used glass elevator is indefinitely out of service.

The headquarters of the Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area is near the dam, and the lake provides opportunities for fishing, swimming, canoeing, and boating.

==Woody Guthrie connection==

Folk singer Woody Guthrie wrote some of his most famous songs while working in the area in the 1940s. In 1941, after a brief stay in Los Angeles, Guthrie and his family moved north to Oregon on the promise of a job. Gunther von Fritsch was directing a documentary for the Bonneville Power Administration about the construction of the Grand Coulee Dam on the Columbia River and needed a narrator. Alan Lomax had recommended Guthrie to narrate the film and sing songs onscreen. The original project was expected to take 12 months, but as filmmakers became worried about casting a political figure like Guthrie, they minimized his role. The Department of the Interior hired him for one month to write songs about the Columbia River and the construction of the federal dams for the documentary&#x27;s soundtrack. Guthrie toured the Columbia River and the Pacific Northwest. Guthrie said he &quot;couldn&#x27;t believe it, it&#x27;s a paradise&quot;, which appeared to inspire him creatively. In one month, Guthrie wrote 26 songs, including three of his most famous: &quot;Roll On, Columbia, Roll On&quot;, &quot;Pastures of Plenty&quot;, and &quot;Grand Coulee Dam&quot;. The surviving songs were released as &quot;Columbia River Songs&quot;. Guthrie was paid $266.66 for the month&#x27;s work in 1941 (ca. $5,750 in 2024 dollars) for the project.

The film &quot;Columbia River&quot; was completed in 1949 and featured Guthrie&#x27;s music. Guthrie had been commissioned in 1941 to provide songs for the project, but it had been postponed by WWII.

<text>Ebbw Vale (; ) is a town at the head of the valley formed by the Ebbw Fawr tributary of the Ebbw River in Wales. It is the largest town and the administrative centre of Blaenau Gwent county borough. The Ebbw Vale and Brynmawr conurbation has a population of roughly 33,000. It has direct access to the dualled A465 Heads of the Valleys trunk road and borders the Brecon Beacons National Park.

==Welsh language==
According to the 2011 Census, 4.6% of Ebbw Vale North&#x27;s 4,561 (210 residents) resident-population can speak, read, and write Welsh, and 5.7% of Ebbw Vale South&#x27;s 4,274 (244 residents) resident-population can speak, read, and write Welsh. This is below the county&#x27;s figure of 5.5% of 67,348 (3,705 residents) who can speak, read, and write Welsh.

==Early history==
There is evidence of very early human activity in the area. Y Domen Fawr is a Bronze Age burial cairn above the town and at Cefn Manmoel there is a demarcation dyke believed to be of neolithic or medieval origins. In relatively modern times the area was a quiet uplands spot in rural Monmouthshire. With only about 120 inhabitants at the end of the 18th century, Ebbw Vale and the whole area was transformed by the Industrial Revolution.

== Iron and steel making ==
Ebbw Vale Iron Works, which later became the Ebbw Vale Steelworks, opened in 1778, followed by the opening of a number of coal mines around 1790. Rails for the Stockton and Darlington Railway were manufactured at Ebbw Vale in 1829. Steel from Ebbw Vale was used to construct the Sydney Harbour Bridge.

At its height (1930s—40s), the steelworks in Ebbw Vale was the largest in Europe, although it attracted very little attention from German bombers during World War II. By the 1960s, around 14,500 people were employed at the steelworks. The end of the century witnessed a massive collapse of the UK steel industry. A strike in 1980 was followed by closures and redundancies which resulted in the dismantling of many of the old plants. In 2002 only 450 were employed in the old industries, and by July of that year the final works closed. Today there are no steelworks or mines left in the area. Ebbw Vale is still recognised for its innovation and contribution to the development of Britain as an industrial nation. 
==Recent times==
Largely as a result of the decline of the mining and steel industries, Ebbw Vale had one of the highest unemployment rates in the United Kingdom, but has been recovering. There are several industrial estates with some significant manufacturing facilities. In 2003, work began on demolishing and redeveloping the steelworks site. By 2015, the site was completely changed, with a new hospital, college campus, school and leisure centre.

Ebbw Vale first hosted the National Eisteddfod in 1958. The Welsh language was dominant in the area until the last quarter of the 19th century and remnants of the language (Welsh hymns and pockets of Welsh being spoken in nearby Rhymney) persisted into the 1970s. The National Eisteddfod returned to Ebbw Vale in 2010.

Aneurin Bevan, the Labour Party politician who was main architect of the National Health Service (NHS), was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Ebbw Vale from the 1929 general election until his death in 1960, when he was succeeded as MP by Michael Foot. The seat joined with the neighbouring Abertillery constituency to form Blaenau Gwent.

In 2010, the former community of Ebbw Vale was abolished and replaced by Ebbw Vale North and Ebbw Vale South. The Ebbw Vale conurbation today runs in an almost unbroken housing street plan 3 miles or so from Beaufort in the North to Cwm in the South. There are significant areas of modern housing to the north and south of the town.

===National Garden Festival of Wales===
In 1992, the Ebbw Vale Garden Festival was the last National Garden Festival. It was sited on the south side of the recently demolished steel works. The festival ran for five months between May and October 1992 attracting over two million visitors. The development cost around £18 million. Since then the site has been considerably redeveloped, with new housing, some light industry, and the Festival Park Branded Outlet, a retail outlet comprising approximately forty shops. However, by 2021, the shopping park had fallen into disuse and, in August 2021, it was sold to a real estate and investment company which planned to redevelop the site into a &quot;mixed use business centre&quot;. The last store closed in early 2022.

===Steelworks development===
The Ebbw Vale Steelworks site known as &quot;The Works&quot; has been re-developed with a £350 million regeneration project by Blaenau Gwent Council and Welsh Government using EU redevelopment funding. It provides scope for housing, retail and office space, wetlands, a learning campus and more. Wales&#x27; first all-individual-bed hospital, Ysbyty Aneurin Bevan, opened in 2010.

===Welsh Future Homes===
A small development of four prototype houses have been built on the site as a precursor a wider residential development. Following a competition run by the council, several plots were developed in time to be demonstrated at the 2010 Eisteddfod, which was held on the steelworks site.

In 2010, Blaenau Gwent council and the &quot;United Welsh Housing Association&quot; built two eco-friendly prototype buildings. The Larch House and the Lime House, designed by Bere Architects, were both highly energy-efficient houses, meeting both Passivhaus and Code for Sustainable Homes Level 6 and Level 5 respectively. The buildings were open for demonstration at the 2010 Eisteddfod.

Ty Unnos is a two-bed property designed by Cardiff University&#x27;s Design Research Unit. It meets Code for Sustainable Homes Level 5 and utilises construction techniques that allow Welsh softwood to be used in the fabric of the building.

===The Environmental Resource Centre===

The Environmental Resource Centre (ERC) is an educational facility run by Gwent Wildlife Trust. Designed by Cardiff University&#x27;s Design Research Unit and Located on the Hotmill Plateau it was the first building to be completed as part of the redevelopment of the former steelworks site in Ebbw Vale. The centre is located on an ecologically rich site next to the Pumphouse cooling ponds, which have become a haven for wildlife since the closure of the steelworks. It was officially opened by Iolo Williams and Jane Davidson AM on 21 May 2010.

===General Offices===
The General Offices is a Grade II* listed building. Built between 1913 and 1915 it formed part of the steelworks site. A brand-new modern extension (contrasting with the original building) officially opened on 24 October 2010 and houses the Gwent Archives.

The main building is partially opened, with an entrance hall and function rooms, together with a 4D cinema.

The Queen officially opened the General Offices as part of her Diamond Jubilee Tour on 3 May 2012, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh.

As part of the Cultural Olympiad for the London 2012 Olympics, Adain Avion, a mobile art space created from the fuselage of a DC-9 aircraft, visited the General Offices between 1 and 7 July 2012.

==Education==

Ebbw Vale currently is host to a selection of primary schools and infant schools, two secondary schools (Ebbw Fawr Learning Community and Brynmawr Foundation School) both covering a large catchment area. Penycwm Special School is also located in Ebbw Vale, in a joint building with the primary phase of Ebbw Vale Learning Community. Alongside this there is also the Ebbw Vale campus of Coleg Gwent, a Further Education college teaching a range of subjects from Mechanics, Media Studies, Humanities to Hairdressing and Beauty therapy. There is also an institute which provides a range of courses for mainly adult learners.

A new Coleg Gwent building was opened in 2012 alongside Wales&#x27; first 3–16 educational establishment titled the Ebbw Fawr Learning Community, a £52m investment. This has resulted in the closure of both Glyncoed Comprehensive School and Ebbw Vale Comprehensive School along with Pontygof Primary School, which now functions as a Pupil Referral Unit for behaviourally challenged students, and Briery Hill Primary School.

==Sport and culture==
Ebbw Vale sporting organisations have a long history. Rugby and cricket have flourished with the town’s Eugene Cross Park as their home.

Ebbw Vale Rugby Football Club can trace its roots back to the 1890s. Nicknamed the &quot;Steelmen&quot; after the area’s former industrial base they have a successful record with many players achieving international honours. By 2015 they were playing at a semi-professional level in the Welsh Premiership just one level below regional rugby. Cricket predates rugby in the area with the first recorded match as far back as 1852. The town’s association with the game grew such that until the early 2000s Glamorgan County Cricket fixtures were regularly held at Eugene Park.

Bowls, swimming and other football and rugby teams play locally at varying levels. The town’s leisure centre has facilities including a 33m long swimming pool. Beaufort Theatre, the largest in Blaenau Gwent, holds regular music, drama and other cultural events.
In 2009 the town centre underwent a great deal of improvements, including the addition of a major art work in the form of a 10.5-metre-high clock that cantilevers over the central boulevards. By 2015 an 830 acre motor sport complex and technology park, the Circuit of Wales was in the advance planning stage with commitments from major investors. To be located on moorland to the north of Ebbw Vale it was to host major motor bike racing events. With the potential for a claimed 6,000 new jobs (although other estimates put it at 3,300) the scheme had strong support from some local and national government, although as of 2019 the project has been cancelled indefinitely due to doubts over the financial viability of the project and plans.

South East Wales does not generally have a high incidence of Welsh speakers in the population. That was not always the case and until the late 1800s, the Ebbw Vale area was largely Welsh-speaking changing as industry brought workers in from outside the area.

A fictionalised verison of the town was the setting for the 2024 BBC Three adult animated series The Golden Cobra created by locals Adam Llewellyn, James Prygodzicz and Thomas Rees. 

==Transport==
A railway service to Cardiff Central began on 6 February 2008,
with trains serving the town from the new Ebbw Vale Parkway railway station. An extension of the line to a new northern terminus, Ebbw Vale Town, was opened on 17 May 2015.

The A465 Heads of the Valleys Road runs just to the north with direct access to the town and its industrial estates.

A direct hourly service between Ebbw Vale and Newport started in January 2024.

=== Funiculars ===

A kilometre-long funicular was part of the Garden Festival in 1992, but closed afterwards. In June 2015 a new inclined elevator, the &quot;&quot;, was opened. The lift was built by ABS Transportbahnen (Doppelmayr Garaventa Group). Its length is and has a vertical lift is . It has one car and operates from Monday to Friday, 7am to 7pm fully automatically, without attendants. The short, 20 second, journey is free to travel and it is intended to improve access between levels in the town, from &#x27;The Works&#x27; site and Coleg Gwent, up to the town centre. The Works site is the site of the old steelworks and the current focus of much redevelopment for the area.

Reception of the funicular has been mixed. Commentators and journalists have described it variously as a funicular, mechanical lift, &#x27;cable car&#x27; and more derisively as a &#x27;Stannah stairlift&#x27;. Most criticism has focussed on the £2.3 million cost, at a time when Blaenau Gwent council are facing a £10M deficit and other services in the area are facing substantial cuts. The project was funded through the Welsh European Funding Office (WEFO) with most of the money being European-sourced and the local council providing around a third. Operating costs have been cited as £16,000 per year, and these too have been questioned – especially regarding any teething troubles in the first year, or the costs of the inevitable vandalism repair. The need for the lift has also been questioned on health grounds, although there is good justification for this on disability access grounds and also encouraging movement between levels as part of encouraging development.

Vandalism a week after opening caused it to close temporarily.

In April 2023 it was announced that the cableway was to close. This decision was reversed when the council obtained funding from undisclosed sources.

<text>Saint Brigid of Kildare or Saint Brigid of Ireland (; Classical Irish: &quot;Brighid&quot;; ; ) is the patroness saint (or &#x27;mother saint&#x27;) of Ireland, and one of its three national saints along with Patrick and Columba. According to medieval Irish hagiographies, she was an abbess who founded the important abbey of Kildare (&quot;Cill Dara&quot;), as well as several other convents of nuns. There are few documented historical facts about her, and her hagiographies are mainly anecdotes and miracle tales, some of which are rooted in pagan folklore. They say Brigid was the daughter of an Irish clan chief and an enslaved Christian woman, and was fostered in a druid&#x27;s household before becoming a consecrated virgin. She is patroness of many things, including poetry, learning, healing, protection, blacksmithing, livestock, and dairy production. In her honour, a perpetual fire was kept burning at Kildare for centuries.

Some historians suggest that Brigid is a Christianisation of the Celtic goddess Brigid. The saint&#x27;s feast day is 1 February, and traditionally it involves weaving Brigid&#x27;s crosses and many other folk customs. It was originally a pre-Christian festival called Imbolc, marking the beginning of spring. Since 2023, it has been a public holiday in the Republic of Ireland. This feast day is shared by Dar Lugdach, who tradition says was her student, close companion, and successor.
==Name==
The saint has the same name as the goddess Brigid, derived from the Proto-Celtic , &quot;high, exalted&quot;, and ultimately originating with Proto-Indo-European . In Old Irish, her name was spelled and pronounced . In Modern Irish she is also called . In Welsh, she is called (sometimes lenited to ), such as in several places called Llansanffraid, &quot;St. Brigit&#x27;s church&quot;. She is also referred to as &quot;the Mary of the Gael&quot;, &quot;the Mary of Ireland&quot; and the &quot;Mother Saint of Ireland&quot;. A less common name is &quot;Brigid of Faughart&quot;, after her traditional birthplace.

==Historicity==
There is debate over whether Brigid was a real person. There are few historical facts about her, and early hagiographies &quot;are mainly anecdotes and miracle stories, some of which are deeply rooted in Irish pagan folklore&quot;. She has the same name as the Celtic goddess Brigid, and there are many supernatural events and folk customs associated with her. Like the saint, the goddess in Irish myth is associated with poetry, healing, protection, smithcraft, and domestic animals, according to &quot;Sanas Cormaic&quot; and &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot;. Furthermore, the saint&#x27;s feast day falls on the Gaelic traditional festival of Imbolc. Some scholars suggest that the saint is a Christianisation of the goddess; others that she was a real person whose mythos took on the goddess&#x27;s attributes. Medieval art historian Pamela Berger argues that Christian monks &quot;took the ancient figure of the mother goddess and grafted her name and functions onto her Christian counterpart&quot;. Dáithí Ó hÓgáin and others suggest that the saint had been chief druid at the temple of the goddess Brigid, was responsible for converting it into a Christian monastery, and that after her death, the name and characteristics of the goddess became attached to the saint.

==Life==
===Sources===
Among the most ancient accounts of St Brigid are two Old Irish hymns; the first by St Ultan of Ardbraccan (died ), &quot;Brigit Bé Bithmaith&quot; (&#x27;Brigid ever-excellent woman&#x27;) also known as &quot;Ultan&#x27;s hymn&quot;, and the second is &quot;Broccán&#x27;s hymn&quot;, composed by St Broccán Clóen (died ) at the request of Ultan who was his tutor. Two early Lives of St Brigid in Hiberno-Latin prose, the &quot;Vita Sanctae Brigitae&quot; I and II, were written in the 7th–8th centuries, the first one possibly by St Aleran (died in 665), lector of Clonard, the second by Cogitosus, a monk of Kildare. An Old Irish prose Life, &quot;Bethu Brigte&quot;, was composed in the 9th century. Several later Latin and Irish Lives of the saint were composed. The &quot;Vita&quot; III, in hexameter verse, is sometimes attributed to St Coelan of Inishcaltra of the 7th–8th centuries, but appears more likely to have been written by St Donatus, an Irish monk who became Bishop of Fiesole in 824. In Donatus&#x27; prologue, it refers to the earlier Lives by St Ultan (see before for his hymn), St. Aleran (see &quot;Vita I&quot;) and an Anonymus. A 34-hexameter Latin poem about St Brigid had previously been composed by the Irish Roman cleric Colman .

Discussion on dates for the annals and the accuracy of dates relating to St Brigid continues.

===Early life===
Because of the legendary quality of the earliest accounts of her life, there is debate among many secular scholars and Christians as to the truthfulness of her biographies. 

Her year of birth is usually given as 451 or 452 AD. One tradition is that Brigid was born at Faughart (just north of Dundalk), in Conaille Muirtheimne, part of the Kingdom of Ulaid. Another tradition is that she was born at Ummeras, near Kildare. All early sources say she was one of the Fothairt, a people mainly based in Leinster. Three biographies name her mother as Broicsech, a slave who had been baptised by Saint Patrick. They name her father as Dubhthach, a chieftain of Leinster.

The &quot;Vitae&quot; says that Dubhthach&#x27;s wife forced him to sell Brigid&#x27;s mother to a druid when she became pregnant. This might have been inspired by the Biblical story of Abraham and Hagar. An 8th-century account calls the druid Maithghean. It says Broicsech gave birth to Brigid at dawn, on the threshold, while bringing milk into the druid&#x27;s house. This liminality seems to be a vestige of druidic lore. Brigid was thus born into slavery. Legends of her early holiness include her vomiting when the druid tried to feed her, due to his impurity; a white cow with red ears arrives to sustain her instead. Brigid&#x27;s druid stepfather is portrayed somewhat sympathetically in the stories. He can see that Brigid is special, he is concerned for Brigid&#x27;s welfare, and he eventually frees her and her mother.

Cogitosus said she spent her youth as a farm worker; churning butter, shepherding the flocks and tending the harvest.

As she grew older, Brigid was said to have worked miracles, including healing and feeding the poor. According to one tale, as a child, she once gave away her mother&#x27;s entire store of butter. The butter was then replenished in answer to Brigid&#x27;s prayers. Around the age of ten, she was returned as a household servant to her father, where her charity led her to donate his belongings to the poor.

In both of the earliest biographies, Dubhthach is so annoyed with Brigid that he took her in a chariot to the King of Leinster to sell her. While Dubhthach was talking to the king, Brigid gave away her father&#x27;s bejewelled sword to a beggar to barter it for food to feed his family. The king recognised her holiness and convinced Dubhthach to grant his daughter freedom.

===Religious life===

It is said that Brigid was &quot;veiled&quot; or became a consecrated virgin either through Saint Mac Caille, Bishop of Cruachán Brí Éile, or by St Mél of Ardagh at Mág Tulach (the present barony of Fartullagh, County Westmeath), who gave her the powers of an abbess.

According to tradition, around 480 Brigid founded a monastery at Kildare (&quot;Cill Dara&quot;, &quot;church of the oak&quot;).

Brigid, with an initial group of seven companions, is credited with organising communal consecrated religious life for women in Ireland. She founded two monasteries; one for men, the other for women. Brigid became the first Abbess of Kildare and invited Conleth (&quot;Conláed&quot;), a hermit from Connell, to help her; he became the first Bishop of Kildare. It has often been said that she gave canonical jurisdiction to Conleth, but Archbishop Healy says that she simply &quot;selected the person to whom the Church gave this jurisdiction&quot;, and her biographer tells us that she chose Saint Conleth &quot;to govern the church along with herself&quot;. For centuries, Kildare was ruled by a double line of abbot-bishops and abbess-bishops, the Abbess of Kildare being regarded as superior general of the monasteries in Ireland. Her successors have always been accorded episcopal honour. Brigid&#x27;s oratory at Kildare became a centre of religion and learning, and developed into a cathedral city.

Brigid is credited with founding a school of art, including metalwork and illumination, which Conleth oversaw. The Kildare scriptorium made the Book of Kildare, which drew high praise from Gerald of Wales (Giraldus Cambrensis), but disappeared during the Reformation. According to Giraldus, nothing that he ever saw was at all comparable to the book, every page of which was gorgeously illuminated, and the interlaced work and the harmony of the colours left the impression that &quot;all this is the work of angelic, and not human skill&quot;.

According to the &quot;Trias Thaumaturga&quot; Brigid spent time in Connacht and founded many churches in the Diocese of Elphin. She is said to have visited Longford, Tipperary, Limerick, and South Leinster. Her friendship with Saint Patrick is noted in the following paragraph from the Book of Armagh: &quot;inter sanctum Patricium Brigitanque Hibernesium columnas amicitia caritatis inerat tanta, ut unum cor consiliumque haberent unum. Christus per illum illamque virtutes multas peregit&quot; (&quot;Between St. Patrick and St. Brigid, the pillars of the Irish people, there was so great a friendship of charity that they had but one heart and one mind. Through him and through her Christ performed many great works&quot;.) However, given that the &#x27;historical&#x27; Brigid was born in 451 and Saint Patrick died circa 461, this is unlikely.

The monk Ultan of Ardbraccan, who wrote the life of Brigid, recounts a story that Darlugdach, Brigid&#x27;s favourite pupil, fell in love with a young man and, hoping to meet him, snuck out of the bed in which she and Brigid were sleeping. However, recognising her spiritual peril, she prayed for guidance, then placed burning embers in her shoes and put them on. &quot;Thus, by fire&quot;, Ultan wrote, &quot;she put out fire, and by pain extinguished pain.&quot; She then returned to bed. Brigid feigned sleep but was aware of Darlugdach&#x27;s departure. The next day, Darlugdach revealed to Brigid the experience of the night before. Brigid reassured her that she was &quot;now safe from the fire of passion and the fire of hell hereafter&quot; and then healed her student&#x27;s feet. The name Darlugdach (also spelt Dar Lugdach or Dar Lughdacha) means &quot;daughter of the god Lugh&quot;.

===Death===

Brigid is said to have been given the last rites when she was dying by Saint Ninnidh of the Pure Hand. Afterwards, he reportedly had his right hand encased in metal so that it would never be defiled, and this was the origin of his epithet. Tradition says she died at Kildare on 1 February. Her year of death is usually placed around 524 or 525.

Upon Brigid&#x27;s death, Darlugdach became the second abbess of Kildare. Darlugdach was so devoted to her mentor that when Brigid lay dying Darlugdach expressed the wish to die with her, but Brigid replied that Darlugdach would die on the first anniversary of her (Brigid&#x27;s) death. The Catholic Church has assigned 1 February as the feast day of both saints.

==Miracles==

Thomas Charles-Edwards wrote that Brigid&#x27;s power is expressed in &#x27;helping&#x27; miracles: healing, feeding the hungry, and rescuing the weak from violence. Unlike Saint Patrick, &quot;most of her miracles were humble affairs for people of low rank&quot; and she &quot;never dictates the course of dynastic politics&quot;.

Dáithí Ó hÓgáin wrote that the melding of a pagan goddess and Christian saint can be seen in some of the miracles, where Brigid multiplies food, bestows cattle and sheep, controls the weather, and is associated with fire or thermal springs.

According to Brian Wright, the miracles of Brigid outlined by Cogitosus mostly concern healing; charity; cows, sheep and dairy; the harvest; fire; fertility/pregnancy; and her virginity/holiness.

*One of the most well-known stories is of Brigid asking the King of Leinster for land. She told the king that the place where she stood was the perfect spot for a convent. It was beside a forest where they could gather firewood and berries, there was a lake nearby that would provide water, and the land was fertile. The king laughed at her and refused to give her any land. Brigid prayed and asked God to soften the king&#x27;s heart. Then she smiled at the king and said, &quot;Will you give me as much land as my cloak will cover?&quot; The king thought that she was joking and agreed. She told four of her sisters to take up the cloak, but instead of laying it flat on the turf, each sister, with face turned to a different point of the compass, began to run swiftly. The cloak grew in all directions and covered many acres of land. &quot;Oh, Brigid!&quot; said the frightened king, &quot;what are you about?&quot;. &quot;I am, or rather my cloak is about covering your whole province to punish you for your stinginess to the poor&quot;. &quot;Call your maidens back. I will give you a decent plot of ground.&quot; The saint was persuaded, and if the king held his purse-strings tight in the future, she had only to allude to her cloak to bring him to reason. Soon afterward, the king became a Christian, began to help the poor, and commissioned the building of the convent. This story was probably inspired by that of Dido.
*After Brigid promised God a life of chastity, her brothers were annoyed at the loss of a bride price. When she was outside carrying a load past a group of poor people, some began to laugh at her. A man named Bacene said to her, &quot;The beautiful eye which is in your head will be betrothed to a man though you like it or not&quot;. In response, Brigid thrust her finger in her eye and said, &quot;Here is that beautiful eye for you. I deem it unlikely that anyone will ask you for a blind girl&quot;. Her brothers tried to save her and wash away the blood from her wound, but there was no water to be found. Brigid said to them, &quot;Put my staff about this sod in front of you&quot;, and after they did, a stream came forth from the ground. Then she said to Bacene, &quot;Soon your two eyes will burst in your head&quot;, and it happened as she said. This story was probably inspired by the lore of Saint Lucy.
*When Brigid was of marital age, a man by the name of Dubthach maccu Lugair came to woo her. Since Brigid had offered her virginity to God, she told the man that she could not accept him but that he should go to the woods behind his house where he would find a beautiful maiden to marry. Everything that he said to the maiden&#x27;s parents would be pleasing to them. The man followed her instructions and Brigid&#x27;s prophecy came true.

*Brigid, who was an expert dairywoman and brewer, was reputed to turn water into beer. 
*The prayers of Saint Brigid were said to still the wind and the rain. 
*In one story, Brigid protected a woman from a nobleman who had entrusted a silver brooch to the woman for safekeeping but then secretly had thrown it into the sea. He charged her with stealing it, knowing that he could take her as a slave if a judge ruled in his favour. The woman fled and sought refuge with Brigid&#x27;s community. By chance, one of her fishermen caught a fish which, when cut open, was found to have swallowed the brooch. The nobleman freed the woman, confessed his sin, and bowed in submission to Brigid. This is also an Irish version of a widespread story; another version is told of Saint Mungo/Kentigern.
*When Brigid was travelling to see a doctor for a headache, she stayed at the house of a Leinster couple who had two mute daughters. The daughters were travelling with Brigid when her horse startled, causing her to fall and graze her head on a stone. A touch of Brigid&#x27;s blood healed the girls of their muteness.
*Brigid is said to have preserved a nun&#x27;s chastity in unusual circumstances. Liam de Paor (1993) and Connolly &amp; Picard (1987), in their complete translations of Cogitosus, give substantially the same translation of the account of Brigid&#x27;s ministry to a nun who had failed to keep her vow of chastity and had become pregnant. In the 1987 translation: &quot;A certain woman who had taken the vow of chastity fell, through the youthful desire of pleasure, and her womb swelled with child. Brigid, exercising the most potent strength of her ineffable faith, blessed her, causing the child to disappear, without coming to birth, and without pain. She faithfully returned the woman to health and to penance&quot;. The Brigid Alliance, an American NGO that assists people seeking abortions, was named after St Brigid in reference to this miracle.
*When on the bank of the River Inny, Brigid was given a gift of apples and sweet sloes. She later entered a house where many lepers begged her for these apples, which she offered willingly. The woman who had given the gift to Brigid was angered by this, saying that she had not given the gift to the lepers. Brigid was angry at the woman for withholding from the lepers and cursed her trees so they would no longer bear fruit. Another woman gave Brigid the same gift, and again Brigid gave them to begging lepers. This woman asked that she and her garden be blessed. Brigid said that a large tree in the garden would have twofold fruit from its offshoots, and this came true.

==Veneration==

Brigid is honoured on 1 February in the calendars of the Catholic Church in Ireland, as well as the Anglican Church of Ireland, Church of England, and Episcopal Church.

She is a patroness saint of Ireland (and one of its three national saints), as well as of healers, poets, blacksmiths, livestock and dairy workers, among others.

Brigid is said to have been buried at the high altar of the original Kildare Cathedral, and a tomb raised over her &quot;adorned with gems and precious stones and crowns of gold and silver&quot;.

In the late 12th century, Gerald of Wales wrote that nineteen nuns took turns keeping a perpetual fire burning at Kildare in honour of Brigid, and that this fire had been burning since Brigid&#x27;s time. He said it was ringed by a hedge that no man was allowed to cross. According to Gerald, each of the nineteen nuns took their turns guarding the fire overnight, but every twentieth night Brigid was said to return to keep the fire burning: &quot;the nineteenth nun puts the logs beside the fire and says &#x27;Brigid, guard your fire, this is your night&#x27;. And in this way the fire is left there, and in the morning the wood, as usual, has been burnt and the fire is still alight&quot;. It has been suggested that this perpetual fire was originally part of a temple of Brigit the goddess.

===Saint Brigid&#x27;s Day===
Saint Brigid&#x27;s feast day is 1 February. Cogitosus, writing in the late 7th century, is the first to mention a feast day of Saint Brigid being observed in Kildare on this date. It was also the date of Imbolc, a seasonal festival that is believed to have pre-Christian origins. Imbolc is one of four Gaelic seasonal festivals, along with Bealtaine (1 May), Lughnasa (1 August), and Samhain (1 November).

The customs of Saint Brigid&#x27;s Day did not begin to be recorded in detail until the early modern era. Brigid&#x27;s crosses are traditionally made on her feast day. These are three- or four-armed crosses woven from rushes. They are hung over doors and windows for protection against fire, lightning, illness and evil spirits.

On St Brigid&#x27;s Eve, Brigid was said to visit virtuous households and bless the inhabitants. People left items of clothing or strips of cloth outside overnight for Brigid to bless. These were believed to have powers of healing and protection. Brigid would be symbolically invited into the home and a bed would often be made for her. In some places, a family member who represented Brigid would circle the house three times carrying rushes. They would then knock on the door three times before being welcomed in.

In Ireland and parts of Scotland, a doll representing Brigid would be paraded around the community by girls and young women. Known as the &quot;&quot; (&#x27;little Brigid&#x27;), anglicized &#x27;Breedhoge&#x27; or &#x27;Biddy&#x27;, it was made from rushes or reeds and clad in bits of cloth, flowers, or shells. In some areas, a girl took on the role of Brigid. Escorted by other girls, she went house-to-house wearing &#x27;Brigid&#x27;s crown&#x27; and carrying &#x27;Brigid&#x27;s shield&#x27; and &#x27;Brigid&#x27;s cross&#x27;, all of which were made from rushes.

Holy wells are often visited on St Brigid&#x27;s Day, especially those wells dedicated to her.

St Brigid&#x27;s Day parades have been revived in the town of Killorglin, County Kerry, which holds a yearly &quot;Biddy&#x27;s Day Festival&quot;. Men and women wearing elaborate straw hats and masks visit public houses carrying a &quot;Brídeóg&quot; to ward off evil spirits and bring good luck for the coming year.

===Relics===
About the year 878, owing to Viking raids, Brigid&#x27;s relics were purportedly taken to Downpatrick and reburied in the tomb of St Patrick and St Columba. The relics of the three saints were said to have been found in 1185 by John de Courcy, and on 9 June of the following year he had them solemnly reburied in Down Cathedral. They are said to have remained in Down Cathedral until 1538, when the relics were desecrated and destroyed during the deputyship of Lord Grey, excepting Brigid&#x27;s head which was saved by some of the clergymen who took it to the Franciscan monastery of Neustadt, in Austria. In 1587 it was presented to the church of the Society of Jesus in Lisbon by Emperor Rudolph II, that is the Igreja de São Roque (Church of St Roch), where a frontal part of her skull is still venerated. However, an occipital part of the skull could already have reached Portugal in the 13th century, preserved in the Igreja São João Batista (Church of St. John the Baptist), on the Lumiar (near Lisbon Airport), where it is venerated on 2 February (not 1 February, as in Ireland). According to the local tradition of the latter church, St. Brigid&#x27;s head would have been carried to King Dinis of Portugal in 1283 by three Irish knights travelling to the Aragonese Crusade. A commemorative inscription on the northern façade of the church, in 16th-century characters, reads: &quot;Here in these three tombs lie the three Irish knights who brought the head of St. Brigid, Virgin, a native of Ireland, whose relic is preserved in this chapel. In memory of which, the officials of the Altar of the same Saint caused this to be done in January AD 1283.&quot; It is in fact only from the mid-16th century onwards that this church assumed the invocation of Saint Brígida when a new side chapel was built and dedicated to her.

In 1884, Francis Cardinal Moran, Archbishop of Sydney, obtained a relic of the saint&#x27;s tooth from
the parochial church of St. Martin of Tours in Cologne in the German Empire and gave it to the Brigidine Sisters in Melbourne. Cardinal Moran wrote about the circumstances in which he obtained the tooth in a letter to the Reverend Mother of this Convent dated 13 March 1906:
In 1905, Sister Mary Agnes of the Dundalk Convent of Mercy took a purported fragment of the skull to St. Bridget&#x27;s Church in Kilcurry. In 1928, Fathers Timothy Traynor and James McCarroll requested another fragment for St. Brigid&#x27;s Church in Killester, a request granted by the Bishop of Lisbon, António Mendes Belo.

The city of Armagh had several associations with St. Brigid. In the twelfth century, the city had two crosses dedicated to Brigid, though, according to the &quot;Monasticon Hibernicum&quot;, purported relics of the saint reposing in Armagh were lost in an accidental fire in 1179. In the seventeenth century, Armagh also had a street named Brigid located near Brigid&#x27;s church in the area called &quot;Brigid&#x27;s Ward.&quot;

The Old Saint Peter&#x27;s Church, Strasbourg contains also (unspecified) relics of St. Brigid, brought by the canons of St. Michael in 1398 when they were forced to leave their submerged abbey of Honau-Rheinau, itself founded by Irish monks.

===Iconography===
In liturgical iconography and statuary, Saint Brigid is often depicted holding a Cross of Saint Brigid, a crozier of the sort used by abbots, and a lamp. Early hagiographers portray Brigid&#x27;s life and ministry as touched with fire. According to Patrick Weston Joyce, tradition holds that nuns at her monastery kept an eternal flame burning there. She is also often depicted with a cow, or sometimes geese. Leitmotifs, some of them borrowed from the apocrypha such as the story where she hangs her cloak on a sunbeam, are associated with the wonder tales of her hagiography and folklore. Cogitosus&#x27; circa 650 &quot;Vita Sanctae Brigidae&quot; portrays Brigid as having the power to multiply such things as butter, bacon, and milk, to bestow sheep and cattle, and to control the weather.

Plant motifs associated with St. Brigid include the white &quot;Lilium candidum&quot; popularly known since medieval times as the Madonna Lily for its association with the Virgin Mary, and the Windflower &quot;Anemone coronaria&quot;, called the &quot;Brigid anemone&quot; since the early 19th century. &quot;Heleborus niger augustifolius&quot; is also known as the &quot;St. Brigid&#x27;s Christmas Rose&quot;. Kildare, the church of the oak &quot;Quercus petraea&quot;, is associated with a tree sacred to the druids.

===Placenames===
====Ireland====
Kilbride (&quot;Church of Brigid&quot;) is one of Ireland&#x27;s most widely found placenames, there are 45 Kilbrides located in 19 of Ireland&#x27;s 32 counties: Antrim (2), Carlow, Cavan, Down, Dublin, Galway, Kildare, Kilkenny (3), Laois, Longford, Louth, Mayo (5), Meath (4), Offaly (4), Roscommon (2), Waterford, Westmeath (2), Wexford (4), and Wicklow (8) as well as two Kilbreedys in Tipperary, Kilbreedia and Toberbreeda in Clare, Toberbreedia in Kilkenny, Brideswell Commons in Dublin, Bridestown and Templebreedy in Cork and Rathbride and Brideschurch in Kildare. A number of placenames are derived from &quot;Cnoic Bhríde&quot; (&quot;Brigid&#x27;s Hill&quot;), such as Knockbridge in Louth and Knockbride in Cavan.

====Wales====
There are many traditions associating the saint with Wales, with dedications and folklore found across the country. As such, villages are often named for either a church or &quot;Llan&quot; associated with Bridget. These include the village, castle and parish of St Brides in Pembrokeshire (near St Brides Bay), the churches and villages of St. Brides-super-Ely and St Brides Major in the Vale of Glamorgan, the church and village of St. Brides Netherwent in Monmouthshire and the church of St Brides, in Newport, the village of Llansanffraid Glan Conwy in Conwy, Llansantffraid in Ceredigion, and the villages of Llansantffraid-ym-Mechain and Llansantffraed in Powys.

====Scotland====
In Scotland, East Kilbride and West Kilbride are called after Brigid. Lhanbryde, near Elgin, Scotland is thought to be Pictish for &quot;Church of Brigid&quot;. In Toryglen, on Glasgow&#x27;s southside, there is St. Brigid&#x27;s RC parish.

In Hebridean mythology and folklore, one of the most prominent figures featured in ethnomusicologist Margaret Fay Shaw&#x27;s iconic 1955 book &quot;Folksongs and Folklore of South Uist&quot; is St Brigid of Kildare, about whom many local stories, songs, and customs are recorded.

====England====
In Fleet Street, City of London stands St Bride&#x27;s Church, substantially rebuilt since its foundation in the 600s (7th century).

====Isle of Man====
In the Isle of Man, where the first name &quot;Breeshey&quot;, the Manx form of the name is common, the parish of Bride is named after the saint.

====Elsewhere====

* In the United States, in Marshall County, Kansas, is the unincorporated community (or township) St. Bridget, described by some accounts as an extinct town.
* St. Bride&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador, at the southwest tip of the Avalon Peninsula, is named for St. Brigid, reflecting historical ties to southeastern Ireland
* St. Brigid Island in Antarctica is named after Brigid of Kildare.
* Bierstadt, Germany, a borough of Wiesbaden, was originally named Birgidstadt, after the saint&#x27;s name in German, Brigida von Kildare.

===Other===
St. Brigid&#x27;s popularity made the name Brigid (or its variants such as Brigitte, Bridie, and Bree) popular in Ireland over the centuries. One writer noted that at one time in history &quot;every Irish family had a Patrick and a Brigid&quot;.

In Haitian Vodou, Saint Brigid (along with the goddess Brigid and Mary Magdalene) is worshipped as the death loa Maman Brigitte, the consort of Baron Samedi.

===Links with Glastonbury===

St. Brigid has long been linked to Glastonbury. Sites that depict her include Glastonbury Tor, where a stone carving of her milking a cow can be seen above one side of the entrance. She also appears in a fresco painting that adorns the interior of St. Patrick&#x27;s Chapel on the grounds of Glastonbury Abbey depicting the saint with a spindle, a bowl of fire, and a cow in the background.

It is also documented by William of Malmesbury that ‘Wherefore the report is extremely prevalent that both Saint Indract and Saint Brigid, no mean inhabitants of Ireland, formerly came over to this spot. Whether Brigid returned home or died at Glastonbury is not sufficiently ascertained, though she left here some of her ornaments; that is to say, her necklace, bag, and implements for embroidering, which are yet shown in memory of her sanctity, and are efficacious in curing divers diseases.’

The Benedictine Monk John of Glastonbury wrote in the mid-fourteenth century that the chapel which was excavated in Beckery was named after her; &#x27;Saint Brigid made a stay of several years on an island near Glastonbury, called Bekery or Little Ireland, where there was an oratory consecrated in honour of Saint Mary Magdalene. She left there certain signs of her presence—her wallet, collar, bell, and weaving implements, which are exhibited and honoured there because of her holy memory—and she returned to Ireland, where, not much later, she rested in the Lord and was buried in the city of Down. The chapel on that island is now dedicated in honour of Saint Brigid; on its south side there is an opening through which, according to the belief of the common folk, anyone who passes will receive forgiveness of all his sins.’

Brides Mound in Beckery is also linked to St. Bridgid and in 2004 &#x27;Brigadine sisters, Mary and Rita Minehan, brought the perpetual Brigid flame (restored in 1993) from Solas Bhrde, in Kildare, during a Glastonbury Goddess Conference ceremony on Bride&#x27;s Mound.&#x27;

==In popular culture==
A fictionalised wish-granting version of Saint Brigid appears in the 2024 Netflix fantasy romantic comedy film &quot;Irish Wish&quot;.

The poet Catherine Ann Cullen has written a song &quot;Brigid&#x27;s Cloak&quot;.

<text>The Book of Dimma (Dublin, Trinity College, MS.A.IV.23) is an 8th-century Irish pocket Gospel Book originally from the Abbey of Roscrea, founded by St. Crónán in County Tipperary, Ireland. In addition to the Gospels of Luke and John, it has an order for the Unction and Communion of the Sick. The surviving illumination of the manuscript contains a number of illuminated initials, three Evangelist portrait pages, and one page with an Evangelist&#x27;s symbol (the eagle of St. John). The pocket gospel book is a distinctively Insular format, of which the Stowe Missal and Book of Mulling are other leading examples.

The gospels other than John are &quot;written for the most part in a rapid cursive script&quot;, while John is &quot;by a different scribe, in neat minuscule bookhand&quot;. It was signed by its scribe, Dimma MacNathi, at the end of each of the Gospels. This Dimma has been traditionally identified with a bishop who was later Bishop of Connor, mentioned by Pope John IV in a letter on Pelagianism in 640. This identification, however, cannot be sustained.

==History==

A well-known legend relates that Crónán asked a monk named Dimma to copy the book, but that it had to be done in one day. Dimma set to work on this impossible task and copied continuously without a break for any meals. All the while he worked the sun never set. When Dimma finished, he thought that it had only taken him one day, when in reality it had taken forty. This miracle was attributed to Crónán.

==Cumdach (book-shrine)==
In the 12th century, the manuscript was encased in a richly worked cumdach or reliquary case, which remains with it at Trinity. On one face it has panels of openwork decoration in Viking Ringerike style over the wood case. There is a good reproduction of 1908 in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, which is not on display there, but has good illustrations available online, unlike the original piece.

==Provenance==
Among the later owners, it belonged to William Meagher, a Catholic priest in Roscrea, then to his descendant Philip Meagher, a priest in Nenagh. Meagher lent it to Dr Thomas Harrison, who sold it without permission to Henry Monck Mason, a librarian at the King&#x27;s Inns society in Dublin, sometime before 1816. He was presented to the Royal Irish Academy on 24 May 1819. It was purchased by Sir William Betham before 1826 and he himself attempted to auction it on 4 July 1830. He finally ceded the manuscript to Trinity College on 29 March 1836.

<text>Skandinaviska Banken () was a Swedish bank founded in Gothenburg, 1864. Its foundation coincided with the political aspirations of the Scandinavian movement, which sought to unite Sweden, Norway and Denmark into a single kingdom. Even if these aspirations came to naught, there was a Scandinavian Monetary Union, with a common currency, and a union between Sweden and Norway, that the bank potentially would be able to exploit.

The bank was founded as Skandinaviska Kreditaktiebolaget, which roughly translates to &quot;Scandinavian Credit Ltd.&quot;. During the early 1900s the bank underwent rapid expansion through the following mergers: Industrikreditaktiebolaget i Stockholm in 1907, Skånes Enskilda Bank in 1910, and Sveriges Privata Centralbank in 1917. Furthermore, Skandinaviska Banken acquired Örebro Enskilda Bank in 1918, and Skånska Handelsbanken in 1919.

Skandinaviska Kreditaktiebolaget, as it was known as at the time, was the main bank of Swedish businessman Ivar Kreuger, the founder of Swedish Match AB, and was struck hard by the financial crisis of the 1930s, triggered in Sweden by the breakdown of Kreuger&#x27;s concern, due to his untimely death in Paris in 1932. As a result, Skandinaviska Kreditaktiebolaget had to accept stock as payment in several companies unable to repay their credit, as well as a SEK200 million bail-out from the Swedish government. The bank continued to prosper and the bail-out sum was already repaid in 1936, and the new company stocks were transferred into an investment holding company, AB Custos, founded in 1937. In 1939, Skandinaviska Kreditaktiebolaget changed its name to &quot;Skandinaviska Banken&quot; and continued its expansion by acquiring local banks throughout the 20th century until 1972, when it merged with Stockholms Enskilda Bank to form Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken (SEB), today one of the largest Nordic banks.

<text>Sebakh (, less commonly transliterated as &quot;sebbakh&quot;) is an Arabic word that translates to &quot;fertilizer&quot;. In English, the term is primarily used to describe decomposed mudbricks from archaeological sites, which is an organic material that can be employed both as an agricultural fertilizer and as a fuel for fires.

==Composition==
Most sebakh consists of ancient, deteriorated mudbrick, a primary building material in ancient Egypt. This material is composed of ancient mud mixed with the nitrous compost of the hay and stubble that the bricks were originally formulated with to give added strength before being baked in the sun.

==Affecting archaeology==
A common practice in Egypt, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, was for farmers to obtain government permits to remove this material from ancient mounds; such farmers were known as &quot;sebakhin&quot;. Mounds indicating the location of ancient cities are also known as a &quot;tell&quot;, or &quot;tel&quot;.

An archaeological site could provide an excellent source of sebakh because decomposed organic debris creates a soil very rich in nitrogen. Nitrogen is an essential component in fertilizers used for plant crops.

Numerous potentially valuable archaeological finds were destroyed by farmers in this way. Sebakh digging also led to the discovery of archaeological finds that might otherwise have gone undetected.

==Amarna==
Sebakh is most commonly associated with the finding of the site of Amarna (). In 1887, a local inhabitant who was delving into sebakh deposits accidentally discovered more than 300 cuneiform tablets that turned out to be pharaonic records of correspondence. These tablet letters, known as the Amarna Letters, have provided much valuable historical and chronological data, as well as information bearing on Egyptian diplomatic relations with her neighbors at that time.

<doc id="353798" wikidata="Q1440267" url="?curid=353798" title="Foyles">
<text>Foyles, a trading name of Waterstones Booksellers Limited (formerly W &amp; G Foyle Ltd.), is a bookseller with a chain of seven stores in England. It is best known for its flagship store in Charing Cross Road, London. Foyles was once listed in the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; as the world&#x27;s largest bookshop in terms of shelf length, at , and of the number of titles on display. It was bought by Waterstones in 2018.

Foyles was famed in the past for its anachronistic, eccentric and sometimes infuriating business practices (see below), so much so that it became a tourist attraction. It has since modernised, and has opened several branches and an online store.

==History==
===Founding and early branches===
Brothers William and Gilbert Foyle founded the business in 1903. After failing entrance exams for the civil service, the brothers offered their redundant textbooks for sale and were inundated by offers. This inspired them to launch a second-hand book business from home. Flushed with success, they opened a small shop on Station Parade in Queen&#x27;s Road, Peckham, where they painted &quot;With all Faith&quot; in gilt letters above the door.

The brothers opened their first West End shop in 1904, at 16 Cecil Court. A year later they hired their first member of staff, who promptly disappeared with the weekly takings. By 1906, their shop was at 135 Charing Cross Road and they were described as London&#x27;s largest educational booksellers.

By 1910, Foyles had added four suburban branches: at Harringay, Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, Kilburn and Brixton.
Not long afterward, the brothers moved their central London store to 119 Charing Cross Road, the Foyles Building, where it remained until 2014. They acquired adjacent buildings at 1–7 Manette Street including the site of the Old Goldbeater&#x27;s House. For a time the store included premises at 121–125 Charing Cross Road, on the north side of the junction with Manette Street.

In this period Foyles, like many booksellers, used to stick a small permanent label advertising themselves on every book they sold. According to one such label, at some time Foyles had a branch in South Africa, at 12–14 Church Street, Cape Town.
===Christina Foyle&#x27;s era===

Christina Foyle, daughter of co-founder William, initiated literary luncheons at the Charing Cross Road premises in October 1930; these continue to the present day. In the first 80 years 700 luncheons were held, hosting more than 1,000 authors and 500,000 guests. Speakers and guests of honour at these luncheons have included great literary figures, and celebrities from the world of politics, the media, the military and the theatre. Most British Prime Ministers since the Second World War have attended, as have The Duke of Edinburgh, General Charles de Gaulle, General Władysław Sikorski and the Emperor of Ethiopia Haile Selassie. The store now also holds many evening literary events throughout the year.

Control of the shop passed to Christina in 1945. Under her the shop stagnated, with little investment and poorly paid staff who could be fired on a whim. She also refused to install any modern conveniences such as electronic tills or calculators; nor would she allow orders to be taken by phone. However, the shop excelled in other fields: expensive books ordered from as far off as Germany were sent with a bill without prepayment.

The shop operated a payment system that required customers to queue three times: to collect an invoice for a book, to pay the invoice, then to collect the book, because sales staff were not allowed to handle cash. The shelving arrangement categorized books by publisher, rather than by topic or author. The newspaper &quot;The Independent&quot; described the atmosphere as &quot;Imagine Kafka had gone into the book trade.&quot; In the 1980s, rival bookshop Dillons placed an advertisement in a bus shelter opposite Foyles reading &quot;Foyled again? Try Dillons&quot;.

Christina Foyle and her husband, Ronald Batty, were determined to be free to fire workers at will and were fiercely opposed to worker representation.

===Modernisation===
Christina Foyle died in 1999; control then passed to her nephew Christopher, who modernised Foyles&#x27; shop and practices. Christopher Foyle was also, from 1978 until 2008, the chairman and CEO of aviation companies Air Foyle and Air Foyle HeavyLift, chairman and later Deputy President of the Air League, and a Trustee of the Foyle Foundation. He is also a Fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society, a Liveryman of the Guild of Air Pilots and a Deputy Lord Lieutenant for Essex.

Foyles&#x27; heavily weathered panelling was replaced by a red plastic, grey metal and beech interior. Whereas the shop used to sell second-hand and new books side by side on the same shelves, it now primarily sells books in print, like other large chain bookshops, but with a notably larger range of titles on every subject. It also now sells second-hand and out-of-print books together with new books in its art, history and archaeology departments. Most of these changes were made between 2003 and 2005. Foyles also now sells electronic books on its website.

===Acquisitions of other companies===
The feminist Silver Moon Bookshop was incorporated into Foyles in 2001 after rising rents on its Charing Cross Road premises forced it to close.

In 2011 Foyles took over Grant &amp; Cutler, a foreign language bookseller that had been founded in 1936. In March 2011 Foyles closed Grant &amp; Cutler&#x27;s shop at 55–57 Great Marlborough Street and merged it with the foreign language section of Foyles&#x27; then premises in the Foyles Building. In the new Foyles store at 107 Charing Cross Road, Grant &amp; Cutler is on Level 4.
===Waterstones acquisition===
Foyles was bought by Waterstones for an undisclosed fee in September 2018; Waterstones retained the brand.

==Branches==
===Modern branches===
Foyles opened a branch at the Royal Festival Hall on London&#x27;s South Bank in 2005. The following year the chain was awarded a concession to run the book departments in Selfridges&#x27; London Oxford Street and Manchester stores, but these closed in February 2009. In February 2008 it opened the only bookshop in St Pancras railway station, which had been refurbished to include the Eurostar London terminal. Foyles also opened a branch in the Westfield shopping centre, which opened on 30 October 2008 in White City in West London. It opened a new &#x27;Booktique&#x27; store at London&#x27;s One New Change shopping centre in October 2010, but this closed in November 2011.

In March 2011 Foyles opened a store in Bristol, its first out-of-London store since before the Second World War. That October it opened a second Westfield store, designed by Lustedgreen, an interior architectural design consultancy, in the Westfield Stratford City complex next to the Olympic Stadium. The chain opened a bookshop in London Waterloo station in February 2014. Birmingham Grand Central &amp; Bullring also features a Foyles store as of its opening in 2015. In September 2016 Foyles opened a store in the new Chelmsford shopping development.

===New flagship store===
In late 2011 Foyles announced that it was selling the lease of its flagship Foyles Building at 111–119 Charing Cross Road. It acquired premises at 107 Charing Cross Road, formerly occupied by the Central St Martins College of Art and Design. The premises were refurbished to designs by London-based architects Lifschutz Davidson Sandilands. The store moved out of the Foyles Building and into the new premises in June 2014.

==Foyles Book of the Year==
Foyles has chosen three titles each year since 2017 as &quot;Book of the Year&quot;: Fiction, Non-fiction and Children&#x27;s.

<text>Romuald (; 951 – traditionally 19 June, c. 1025/27 AD) was the founder of the Camaldolese order and a major figure in the eleventh-century &quot;Renaissance of eremitical asceticism&quot;. Romuald spent about 30 years traversing Italy, founding and reforming monasteries and hermitages.

==Life==
According to the &quot;vita&quot; by Peter Damian, written about fifteen years after Romuald&#x27;s death, Romuald was born in Ravenna, in northeastern Italy, to the aristocratic Onesti family. His father was Sergius degli Onesti and his mother was Traversara Traversari. As a youth, according to early accounts, Romuald indulged in the pleasures and sins of the world common to a tenth-century nobleman. At the age of twenty he served as second to his father, who killed a relative in a duel over property. Romuald was devastated, and went to the Basilica of Sant&#x27;Apollinare in Classe to do 40 days of penance. After some indecision, Romuald became a monk there. San Apollinare had recently been reformed by St. Mayeul of Cluny Abbey, but still was not strict enough in its observance to satisfy Romuald. His injudicious correction of the less zealous aroused such enmity against him that he applied for, and was readily granted, permission to retire to Venice, where he placed himself under the direction of a hermit named Marinus and lived a life of extraordinary severity.
About 978, Pietro I Orseolo, Doge of Venice, who had obtained his office by acquiescence in the murder of his predecessor, began to suffer remorse for his crime. On the advice of Guarinus, Abbot of Saint-Michel-de-Cuxa, in Catalonia, and of Marinus and Romuald, he abandoned his office and relations, and fled to Cuxa, where he took the habit of St. Benedict, while Romuald and Marinus erected a hermitage close to the monastery. Romuald lived there for about ten years, taking advantage of the library of Cuxa to refine his ideas regarding monasticism.

After that he spent the next 30 years going about Italy, founding and reforming monasteries and hermitages. His reputation being known to advisors of the Holy Roman Emperor Otto III, Romuald was persuaded by him to take the vacant office of abbot at Sant&#x27;Apollinare to help bring about a more dedicated way of life there. The monks, however, resisted his reforms, and after a year, Romuald resigned, hurling his abbot&#x27;s staff at Otto&#x27;s feet in total frustration. He then again withdrew to the eremitical life.

In 1012, he arrived at the Diocese of Arezzo. Here, according to the legend, a certain Maldolus, who had seen a vision of monks in white garments ascending into Heaven, gave him some land, afterwards known as the Campus Maldoli, or Camaldoli. St. Romuald built on this land five cells for hermits, which, with the monastery at Fontebuono, built two years later, became the famous mother-house of the Camaldolese Order. Romuald&#x27;s daunting charisma awed Rainier of Tuscany, who was neither able to face Romuald nor to send him away. Romuald founded several other monasteries, including the monastery of Val di Castro, where he died in 1027.

Romuald&#x27;s feast day was not included in the Tridentine calendar. It was added in 1594 for celebration on 19 June, the date of his death, but in the following year it was transferred by Pope Clement VIII to 7 February, the anniversary of the transfer of his relics to Fabriano in 1481, and in 1969 it was moved back to the day of his death.
==St. Romuald&#x27;s Rule==
In his youth Romuald became acquainted with three major schools of western monastic tradition. Sant&#x27;Apollinare in Classe was a traditional Benedictine monastery under the influence of the Cluniac Reforms. Marinus followed a much harsher, ascetic and solitary lifestyle, which was originally of Irish eremitic origins. The abbot of Sant Miguel de Cuxa, Guarinus, had also begun reforms but mainly built upon a third Christian tradition, that of the Iberian Peninsula. Romuald was able to integrate these different traditions and establish his own monastic order. The admonition in his rule &quot;Empty yourself completely and sit waiting&quot; places him in relation to the long Christian history of intellectual stillness and interior passivity in meditation also reflected in the nearly contemporary Byzantine ascetic practice known as Hesychasm.

&quot;Sit in your cell as in paradise. Put the whole world behind you and forget it. Watch your thoughts like a good fisherman watching for fish. The path you must follow is in the Psalms — never leave it.&quot;
&quot;If you have just come to the monastery, and in spite of your good will you cannot accomplish what you want, take every opportunity you can to sing the Psalms in your heart and to understand them with your mind. And if your mind wanders as you read, do not give up; hurry back and apply your mind to the words once more.&quot;

Archbishop Cosmo Francesco Ruppi noted that, &quot;Interiorization of the spiritual dimension, the primacy of solitude and contemplation, slow penetration of the Word of God and calm meditation on the Psalms are the pillars of Camaldolese spirituality, which St. Romuald gives as the essential core of his Rule.&quot;

Romuald&#x27;s reforms provided a structural context to accommodate both the eremitic and cenobitic aspects of monastic life.

<text>In Wales, as in England and Northern Ireland, a town is any settlement which has received a charter of incorporation, more commonly known as a town charter, approved by the monarch. Fifty-five boroughs in Wales were given parliamentary representation in 1536, but the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 recognised only 20 Welsh boroughs. Subsequent urban growth led to the designation of other places as boroughs, including Wrexham, Rhondda, Barry and Merthyr Tydfil, but many other settlements were only granted the status of urban district. The Local Government Act 1972 allows civil parishes in England and Wales to resolve themselves to be town councils.

Cities listed are annotated as &quot;(city)&quot;. Until the 16th century, a town was recognised as a city if it had a diocesan cathedral within its limits. The city of St Davids, with a population of about 2,000, received its city status in this way. St Asaph acquired city status in 2012 as part of the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II.

<text>Glycogenolysis is the breakdown of glycogen (n) to glucose-1-phosphate and glycogen (n-1). Glycogen branches are catabolized by the sequential removal of glucose monomers via phosphorolysis, by the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase.

==Mechanism==

In the muscles, glycogenolysis begins due to the binding of cAMP to phosphorylate kinase, converting the latter to its active form so it can convert phosphorylase b to phosphorylase a, which is responsible for catalyzing the breakdown of glycogen.

The overall reaction for the breakdown of glycogen to glucose-1-phosphate is:
: glycogen(n residues) + Pi glycogen(n-1 residues) + glucose-1-phosphate
Here, glycogen phosphorylase cleaves the bond linking a terminal glucose residue to a glycogen branch by substitution of a phosphoryl group for the α[1→4] linkage.

Glucose-1-phosphate is converted to glucose-6-phosphate (which often ends up in glycolysis) by the enzyme phosphoglucomutase.

Glucose residues are phosphorolysed from branches of glycogen until four residues before a glucose that is branched with a α[1→6] linkage. Glycogen debranching enzyme then transfers three of the remaining four glucose units to the end of another glycogen branch. This exposes the α[1→6] branching point, which is hydrolysed by α[1→6] glucosidase, removing the final glucose residue of the branch as a molecule of glucose and eliminating the branch. This is the only case in which a glycogen metabolite is not glucose-1-phosphate. The glucose is subsequently phosphorylated to glucose-6-phosphate by hexokinase.

==Enzymes== 
# Glycogen phosphorylase with Pyridoxal phosphate as prosthetic group
# Alpha-1,4 → alpha-1,4 glucan transferase
# Alpha-1,6-glucosidase
# Phosphoglucomutase
# Glucose-6-phosphatase (absent in muscles)

==Function==
Glycogenolysis takes place in the cells of the muscle and liver tissues in response to hormonal and neural signals. In particular, glycogenolysis plays an important role in the fight-or-flight response and the regulation of glucose levels in the blood.

In myocytes (muscle cells), glycogen degradation serves to provide an immediate source of glucose-6-phosphate for glycolysis, to provide energy for muscle contraction. Glucose-6-phosphate can not pass through the cell membrane, and is therefore used solely by the myocytes that produce it.

In hepatocytes (liver cells), the main purpose of the breakdown of glycogen is for the release of glucose into the bloodstream for uptake by other cells. The phosphate group of glucose-6-phosphate is removed by the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase, which is not present in myocytes, and the free glucose exits the cell via GLUT2 facilitated diffusion channels in the hepatocyte cell membrane.

==Regulation==
Glycogenolysis is regulated hormonally in response to blood sugar levels by glucagon and insulin, and stimulated by epinephrine during the fight-or-flight response. Insulin potently inhibits glycogenolysis.

In myocytes, glycogen degradation may also be stimulated by neural signals; glycogenolysis is regulated by epinephrine and calcium released by the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

Glucagon has no effect on muscle glycogenolysis.

Calcium binds with calmodulin and the complex activates phosphorylase kinase.

==Clinical significance==
Parenteral (intravenous) administration of glucagon is a common human medical intervention in diabetic emergencies when sugar cannot be given orally. It can also be administered intramuscularly.

<doc id="353806" wikidata="Q1152448" url="?curid=353806" title="List of burghs in Scotland">
<text>The following list includes all effective burghs in Scotland from the coming into force of the Burgh Police (Scotland) Act 1892 (55 &amp; 56 Vict. c. 55), in 1893. &quot;Ineffective&quot; burghs, which had not used legislation to adopt a &quot;police system&quot;, take on local government duties and reform their town councils, were abolished on this date.

&quot;Burgh&quot; ( ) is the Scots term for a town or a municipality. It corresponds to the Scandinavian &quot;&quot; and the English &quot;Borough&quot;.

Burghs are listed below under the name of the county to which they belonged. The county boundaries used are those effective for local government purposes from circa 1890 until 1975. During this period four burghs were also counties, or &quot;counties of cities&quot; in Scotland&quot;.&quot;

==Counties of cities==

These four burghs were counties of cities, being independent from the surrounding counties for all judicial and local government purposes.
Note a: Royal Burgh of Aberdeen absorbed Aberdeenshire burghs of Old Aberdeen burgh (burgh of barony 1489, police burgh 1860), Woodside (police burgh 1860) in 1891.

Note b: Royal Burgh of Glasgow absorbed the following Renfrewshire burghs in the years shown:
*1846: Gorbals (private act 1808)
*1891: Crosshill (police burgh 1871), Govanhill (police burgh 1876), Hillhead (police burgh 1869), Pollokshields (police burgh 1876), Pollokshields East (police burgh 1880)
*1905: Kinning Park (police burgh 1871)
*1912: Govan (burgh of barony 1607, police burgh 1864), Pollokshaws (burgh of barony 1813, police burgh 1858)

<text>This is a list of towns in England.

Historically, towns were any settlement with a charter, including market towns and ancient boroughs. The process of incorporation was reformed in 1835 and many more places received borough charters, whilst others were lost. All existing boroughs were abolished on 1 April 1974 and borough status was reformed as a civic honour for local government districts. At the same time a limited number of former boroughs and other settlements became successor parishes, with the right to be known as a town and preserve their charter. Boroughs that did not become successor parishes formed unparished areas, but were able to preserve their charters without a corporate body by appointing charter trustees. Since 1 April 1974 any parish council in England has the right to resolve to call itself a town council and many communities have taken up this right, including areas that preserved continuity with charter trustees. However, no successor parishes have exercised this right (e.g. Ilkley).

This list does not include cities in England.

==Towns==

This list includes:
*civil parishes with town councils;
*unparished areas that had borough charters before 1 April 1974 (including areas with charter trustees); and
*towns with ancient/market charters that did not later gain borough charters or town councils.

<doc id="353811" wikidata="Q506079" url="?curid=353811" title="Sino-Soviet split">
<text>The Sino-Soviet split was the gradual worsening of relations between the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) during the Cold War. This was primarily caused by doctrinal divergences that arose from their different interpretations and practical applications of Marxism–Leninism, as influenced by their respective geopolitics during the Cold War of 1947–1991. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Sino-Soviet debates about the interpretation of orthodox Marxism became specific disputes about the Soviet Union&#x27;s policies of national de-Stalinization and international peaceful coexistence with the Western Bloc, which Chinese leader Mao Zedong decried as revisionism. Against that ideological background, China took a belligerent stance towards the Western world, and publicly rejected the Soviet Union&#x27;s policy of peaceful coexistence between the Western Bloc and Eastern Bloc. In addition, Beijing resented the Soviet Union&#x27;s growing ties with India due to factors such as the Sino-Indian border dispute, and Moscow feared that Mao was unconcerned about the horrors of nuclear warfare.

In 1956, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev denounced Joseph Stalin and Stalinism in the speech &quot;On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences&quot; and began the de-Stalinization of the USSR. Mao and the Chinese leadership were appalled as the PRC and the USSR progressively diverged in their interpretations and applications of Leninist theory. By 1961, their intractable ideological differences provoked the PRC&#x27;s formal denunciation of Soviet communism as the work of &quot;revisionist traitors&quot; in the USSR. The PRC also declared the Soviet Union social imperialist. For Eastern Bloc countries, the Sino-Soviet split was a question of who would lead the revolution for world communism, and to whom (China or the USSR) the vanguard parties of the world would turn for political advice, financial aid, and military assistance. In that vein, both countries competed for the leadership of world communism through the vanguard parties native to the countries in their spheres of influence. The conflict culminated after the Zhenbao Island incident in 1969, when the Soviet Union planned to launch a large-scale nuclear strike on China including its capital Beijing, but eventually called off the attack due to the intervention from the United States. 

In the Western world, the Sino-Soviet split transformed the bi-polar cold war into a tri-polar one. The rivalry facilitated Mao&#x27;s realization of Sino-American rapprochement with the US President Richard Nixon&#x27;s visit to China in 1972. In the West, the policies of triangular diplomacy and linkage emerged. Like the Tito–Stalin split, the occurrence of the Sino-Soviet split also weakened the concept of monolithic communism, the Western perception that the communist nations were collectively united and would not have significant ideological clashes. However, the USSR and China both continued to cooperate with North Vietnam during the Vietnam War into the 1970s, despite rivalry elsewhere. Historically, the Sino-Soviet split facilitated the Marxist–Leninist &quot;Realpolitik&quot; with which Mao established the tri-polar geopolitics (PRC–USA–USSR) of the late-period Cold War (1956–1991) to create an anti-Soviet front, which Maoists connected to Three Worlds Theory. According to Lüthi, there is &quot;no documentary evidence that the Chinese or the Soviets thought about their relationship within a triangular framework during the period.&quot;

== Origins ==
=== Reluctant co-belligerents ===

During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the nationalist Kuomintang party (KMT) set aside their civil war to expel the Empire of Japan from the Republic of China. To that end, the Soviet leader, Joseph Stalin, ordered Mao Zedong, leader of the CCP, to co-operate with Chiang Kai-shek, leader of the KMT, in fighting the Japanese. Following the surrender of Japan at the end of World War II, both parties resumed their civil war, which the communists won by 1949.

At World War II&#x27;s conclusion, Stalin advised Mao not to seize political power at that time, and, instead, to collaborate with Chiang due to the 1945 USSR–KMT Treaty of Friendship and Alliance. Mao obeyed Stalin in communist solidarity. Three months after the Japanese surrender, in November 1945, when Chiang opposed the annexation of Tannu Uriankhai (Mongolia) to the USSR, Stalin broke the treaty requiring the Red Army&#x27;s withdrawal from Manchuria (giving Mao regional control) and ordered Soviet commander Rodion Malinovsky to give the Chinese communists the Japanese leftover weapons.

In the five-year post-World War II period, the United States partly financed Chiang, his nationalist political party, and the National Revolutionary Army. However, Washington put heavy pressure on Chiang to form a joint government with the communists. US envoy George Marshall spent 13 months in China trying without success to broker peace. In the concluding three-year period of the Chinese Civil War, the CCP defeated and expelled the KMT from mainland China. Consequently, the KMT retreated to Taiwan in December 1949.

=== Chinese communist revolution ===

As a revolutionary theoretician of communism seeking to realize a socialist state in China, Mao developed and adapted the urban ideology of Orthodox Marxism for practical application to the agrarian conditions of pre-industrial China and the Chinese people. Mao&#x27;s Sinification of Marxism–Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, established political pragmatism as the first priority for realizing the accelerated modernization of a country and a people, and ideological orthodoxy as the secondary priority because Orthodox Marxism originated for practical application to the socio-economic conditions of industrialized Western Europe in the 19th century.

During the Chinese Civil War in 1947, Mao dispatched American journalist Anna Louise Strong to the West, bearing political documents explaining China&#x27;s socialist future, and asked that she &quot;show them to Party leaders in the United States and Europe&quot;, for their better understanding of the Chinese Communist Revolution, but that it was not &quot;necessary to take them to Moscow.&quot;

Mao trusted Strong because of her positive reportage about him, as a theoretician of communism, in the article &quot;The Thought of Mao Tse-Tung&quot;, and about the CCP&#x27;s communist revolution, in the 1948 book &quot;Dawn Comes Up Like Thunder Out of China: An Intimate Account of the Liberated Areas in China&quot;, which reports that Mao&#x27;s intellectual achievement was &quot;to change Marxism from a European [form] to an Asiatic form . . . in ways of which neither Marx nor Lenin could dream.&quot;

=== Treaty of Sino-Soviet friendship ===

In 1950, Mao and Stalin safeguarded the national interests of China and the Soviet Union with the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. The treaty improved the two countries&#x27; geopolitical relationship on political, military and economic levels. Stalin&#x27;s largesse to Mao included a loan for $300 million; military aid, should Japan attack the PRC; and the transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway in Manchuria, Port Arthur and Dalian to Chinese control. In return, the PRC recognized the independence of the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic.

Despite the favourable terms, the treaty of socialist friendship included the PRC in the geopolitical hegemony of the USSR, but unlike the governments of the Soviet satellite states in Eastern Europe, the USSR did not control Mao&#x27;s government. In six years, the great differences between the Soviet and the Chinese interpretations and applications of Marxism–Leninism voided the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship.

In 1953, guided by Soviet economists, the PRC applied the USSR&#x27;s model of planned economy, which gave first priority to the development of heavy industry, and second priority to the production of consumer goods. Later, ignoring the guidance of technical advisors, Mao launched the Great Leap Forward to transform agrarian China into an industrialized country with disastrous results for people and land. Mao&#x27;s unrealistic goals for agricultural production went unfulfilled because of poor planning and realization, which aggravated rural starvation and increased the number of deaths caused by the Great Chinese Famine, which resulted from three years of drought and poor weather. An estimated 30 million Chinese people starved to death, more than any other famine in recorded history. Mao and his government largely downplayed the deaths.

===Socialist relations repaired===
In 1954, Soviet first secretary Nikita Khrushchev repaired relations between the USSR and the PRC with trade agreements, a formal acknowledgement of Stalin&#x27;s economic unfairness to the PRC, fifteen industrial-development projects, and exchanges of technicians (c. 10,000) and political advisors (c. 1,500), whilst Chinese labourers were sent to fill shortages of manual workers in Siberia. Despite this, Mao and Khrushchev disliked each other, both personally and ideologically. However, by 1955, consequent to Khrushchev&#x27;s having repaired Soviet relations with Mao and the Chinese, 60% of the PRC&#x27;s exports went to the USSR, by way of the five-year plans of China begun in 1953.

=== Discontents of de-Stalinization ===

In early 1956, Sino-Soviet relations began deteriorating, following Khrushchev&#x27;s de-Stalinization of the USSR, which he initiated with the speech &quot;On the Cult of Personality and its Consequences&quot; that criticized Stalin and Stalinism – especially the Great Purge of Soviet society, of the rank-and-file of the Soviet Armed Forces, and of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). In light of de-Stalinization, the CPSU&#x27;s changed ideological orientation – from Stalin&#x27;s confrontation of the West to Khrushchev&#x27;s peaceful coexistence with it – posed problems of ideological credibility and political authority for Mao, who had emulated Stalin&#x27;s style of leadership and practical application of Marxism–Leninism in the development of socialism with Chinese characteristics and the PRC as a country.

The Hungarian Revolution of 1956 against the rule of Moscow was a severe political concern for Mao, because it had required military intervention to suppress, and its occurrence weakened the political legitimacy of the Communist Party to be in government. In response to that discontent among the European members of the Eastern Bloc, the Chinese Communist Party denounced the USSR&#x27;s de-Stalinization as revisionism, and reaffirmed the Stalinist ideology, policies, and practices of Mao&#x27;s government as the correct course for achieving socialism in China. This event, indicating Sino-Soviet divergences of Marxist–Leninist practice and interpretation, began fracturing &quot;monolithic communism&quot; — the Western perception of absolute ideological unity in the Eastern Bloc.

From Mao&#x27;s perspective, the success of the Soviet foreign policy of peaceful coexistence with the West would geopolitically isolate the PRC; whilst the Hungarian Revolution indicated the possibility of revolt in the PRC, and in China&#x27;s sphere of influence. To thwart such discontent, Mao launched in 1956 the Hundred Flowers Campaign of political liberalization – the freedom of speech to criticize government, the bureaucracy, and the CCP publicly. However, the campaign proved too successful when blunt criticism of Mao was voiced. Consequent to the relative freedoms of the de-Stalinized USSR, Mao retained the Stalinist model of Marxist–Leninist economy, government, and society.

Ideological differences between Mao and Khrushchev compounded the insecurity of the new communist leader in China. Following the Chinese civil war, Mao was especially sensitive to ideological shifts that might undermine the CCP. In an era saturated by this form of ideological instability, Khrushchev&#x27;s anti-Stalinism was particularly impactful to Mao. Mao saw himself as a descendent in a long Marxist–Leninist lineage of which Stalin was the most recent figurehead. Chinese leaders began to associate Stalin&#x27;s successor with anti-party elements within China. Khrushchev was pinned as a revisionist. Popular sentiment within China regarded Khrushchev as a representative of the upper-class, and Chinese Marxist-Leninists viewed the leader as a blight on the communist project. While the two nations had significant ideological similarities, domestic instability drove a wedge between the nations as they began to adopt different visions of communism following the death of Stalin in 1953.

Popular sentiment within China changed as Khrushchev&#x27;s policies changed. Stalin had accepted that the USSR would carry much of the economic burden of the Korean War, but, when Khrushchev came to power, he created a repayment plan under which the PRC would reimburse the Soviet Union within an eight-year period. However, China was experiencing significant food shortages at this time, and, when grain shipments were routed to the Soviet Union instead of feeding the Chinese public, faith in the Soviets plummeted. These policy changes were interpreted as Khrushchev&#x27;s abandonment of the communist project and the nations&#x27; shared identity as Marxist-Leninists. As a result, Khrushchev became Mao&#x27;s scapegoat during China&#x27;s food crisis.

=== Chinese radicalization and distrust ===

In the first half of 1958, Chinese domestic politics developed an anti-Soviet tone from the ideological disagreement over de-Stalinization and the radicalization that preceded the Great Leap Forward. It coincided with greater Chinese sensitivity over matters of sovereignty and control over foreign policy - particularly where Taiwan was concerned. The result was a growing Chinese reluctance to cooperate with the Soviet Union. The deterioration of the relationship manifested throughout the year.

In April, the Soviets proposed the construction of a joint radio transmitter. China rejected it after counter-proposing that the transmitter be Chinese owned and that Soviet usage be limited to wartime. A similar Soviet proposal in July was also rejected. In June, China requested Soviet assistance to develop nuclear attack submarines. The following month, the Soviets proposed the construction of a joint strategic submarine fleet, but the proposal as delivered failed to mention the type of submarine. The proposal was strongly rejected by Mao under the belief that the Soviet wanted to control China&#x27;s coast and submarines. Khrushchev secretly visited Beijing in early August in an unsuccessful attempt to salvage the proposal; Mao was in an ideological furor and would not accept. The meeting ended with an agreement to construct the previously rejected radio station with Soviet loans.

Further damage was caused by the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis toward the end of August. China did not notify or consult the Soviet Union before initiating the conflict, contradicting China&#x27;s previous desire to share information for foreign affairs and violating - at least the spirit - the Sino-Soviet friendship treaty. This may have been partially in response to what the Chinese viewed as the timid Soviet response to the West in the 1958 Lebanon crisis and 1958 Iraqi coup d&#x27;état. The Soviets opted to publicly support China at the end of August, but became concerned when the US replied with veiled threats of nuclear war in early September and mixed-messaging from the Chinese. China stated that its goal was the resumption of ambassadorial talks that had started after the First Taiwan Strait Crisis while simultaneously framing the crisis as the start of a nuclear war with the capitalist bloc.

Chinese nuclear brinkmanship was a threat to peaceful coexistence. The crisis and ongoing nuclear disarmament talks with the US helped to convince the Soviets to renege on its 1957 commitment to deliver a model nuclear bomb to China. By this time, the Soviets had already helped create the foundations of China&#x27;s nuclear weapons program.

=== Mao&#x27;s nuclear-war remarks and two Chinas ===

Throughout the 1950s, Khrushchev maintained positive Sino-Soviet relations with foreign aid, especially nuclear technology for the Chinese atomic bomb project, Project 596. However, political tensions persisted because the economic benefits of the USSR&#x27;s peaceful-coexistence policy voided the belligerent PRC&#x27;s geopolitical credibility among the nations under Chinese hegemony, especially after a failed PRC–US rapprochement. In the Chinese sphere of influence, that Sino-American diplomatic failure and the presence of US nuclear weapons in Taiwan justified Mao&#x27;s confrontational foreign policies with Taiwan (Republic of China).

According to various sources including official CCP publications, at the 1957 International Meeting of Communist and Workers Parties in Moscow, Mao Zedong made some controversial remarks on nuclear wars, saying that &quot;I&#x27;m not afraid of nuclear war. There are 2.7 billion people in the world; it doesn&#x27;t matter if some are killed. China has a population of 600 million; even if half of them are killed, there are still 300 million people left.&quot; His remarks shocked many people, and according to the recollection of Khrushchev, &quot;the audience was dead silent&quot;. A number of Communist leaders, including Antonín Novotný, Władysław Gomułka and Shmuel Mikunis, expressed concerns after the meeting, eventually aligning themselves with the Soviet due to the combativeness of Mao&#x27;s policies. Novotný, then First Secretary of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, complained that &quot;Mao Zedong says he is prepared to lose 300 million people out of a population of 600 million. What about us? We have only twelve million people in Czechoslovakia.&quot; Mao had reportedly said similar things in 1956 when meeting with a delegation of journalists from Yugoslavia, and in 1958 at the second meeting of the 8th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party. In 1963, the Chinese government issued a statement, calling the quote of &quot;300 million people&quot; was a slander from the Soviet Union.

In late 1958, the CCP revived Mao&#x27;s guerrilla-period cult of personality to portray &quot;Chairman Mao&quot; as the charismatic, visionary leader solely qualified to control the policy, administration, and popular mobilization required to realize the Great Leap Forward to industrialize China. Moreover, to the Eastern Bloc, Mao portrayed the PRC&#x27;s warfare with Taiwan and the accelerated modernization of the Great Leap Forward as Stalinist examples of Marxism–Leninism adapted to Chinese conditions. These circumstances allowed ideological Sino-Soviet competition, and Mao publicly criticized Khrushchev&#x27;s economic and foreign policies as deviations from Marxism–Leninism.

== Onset of the disputes==
To Mao, the events of the 1958–1959 period indicated that Khrushchev was politically untrustworthy as an orthodox Marxist. In 1959, First Secretary Khrushchev met with US President Dwight Eisenhower to decrease US-Soviet geopolitical tensions. To that end, the USSR: (i) reneged an agreement for technical aid to develop Project 596, and (ii) sided with India in the Sino-Indian War. Each US-Soviet collaboration offended Mao and he perceived Khrushchev as an opportunist who had become too tolerant of the West. The CCP said that the CPSU concentrated too much on &quot;Soviet–US co-operation for the domination of the world&quot;, with geopolitical actions that contradicted Marxism–Leninism.

The final face-to-face meeting between Mao and Khruschev took place on 2 October 1959, when Khrushchev visited Beijing to mark the 10th anniversary of the Chinese Revolution. By this point relations had deteriorated to the level where the Chinese were going out of their way to humiliate the Soviet leader - for example, there was no honour guard to greet him, no Chinese leader gave a speech, and when Khrushchev insisted on giving a speech of his own, no microphone was provided. The speech in question would turn out to contain praise of the US President Eisenhower, whom Khrushchev had recently met, obviously an intentional insult to Communist China. The leaders of the two Socialist states would not meet again for the next 30 years.

===Khrushchev&#x27;s criticism of Albania at the 22nd CPSU Congress===

In June 1960, at the zenith of de-Stalinization, the USSR denounced the People&#x27;s Republic of Albania as a politically backward country for retaining Stalinism as government and model of socialism. In turn, Bao Sansan said that the CCP&#x27;s message to the cadres in China was:

&quot;When Khrushchev stopped Russian aid to Albania, Hoxha said to his people: &#x27;Even if we have to eat the roots of grass to live, we won&#x27;t take anything from Russia.&#x27; China is not guilty of chauvinism, and immediately sent food to our brother country.&quot;

During his opening speech at the CPSU&#x27;s 22nd Party Congress on 17 October 1961 in Moscow, Khrushchev once again criticized Albania as a politically backward state and the Albanian Party of Labour as well as its leadership, including Enver Hoxha, for refusing to support reforms against Stalin&#x27;s legacy, in addition to their criticism of rapprochement with Yugoslavia, leading to the Soviet–Albanian split. In response to this rebuke, on the 19 October the delegation representing China at the Party Congress led by Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai sharply criticised Moscow&#x27;s stance towards Tirana:

&quot;We hold that should a dispute or difference unfortunately arise between fraternal parties or fraternal countries, it should be resolved patiently in the spirit of proletarian internationalism and according to the principles of equality and of unanimity through consultation. Public, one-sided censure of any fraternal party does not help unity and is not helpful in resolving problems. To bring a dispute between fraternal parties or fraternal countries into the open in the face of the enemy cannot be regarded as a serious Marxist–Leninist attitude.&quot;

Subsequently, on 21 October, Zhou visited the Lenin Mausoleum (then still entombing Stalin&#x27;s body), laying two wreaths at the base of the site, one of which read &quot;Dedicated to the great Marxist, Comrade Stalin&quot;. On 23 October, the Chinese delegation left Moscow for Beijing early, before the Congress&#x27; conclusion; within days, Khrushchev had Stalin&#x27;s body removed from the mausoleum.

===Mao, Khrushchev, and the US===
In 1960, Mao expected Khrushchev to deal aggressively with US President Dwight D. Eisenhower by holding him to account for the USSR having shot down a U-2 spy plane, the CIA&#x27;s photographing of military bases in the USSR; aerial espionage that the US said had been discontinued. In Paris, at the Four Powers Summit meeting, Khrushchev demanded and failed to receive Eisenhower&#x27;s apology for the CIA&#x27;s continued aerial espionage of the USSR. In China, Mao and the CCP interpreted Eisenhower&#x27;s refusal to apologize as disrespectful of the national sovereignty of socialist countries, and held political rallies aggressively demanding Khrushchev&#x27;s military confrontation with US aggressors; without such decisive action, Khrushchev lost face with the PRC.

In the Romanian capital of Bucharest, at the International Meeting of Communist and Workers Parties (November 1960), Mao and Khrushchev respectively attacked the Soviet and the Chinese interpretations of Marxism-Leninism as the wrong road to world socialism in the USSR and in China. Mao said that Khrushchev&#x27;s emphases on consumer goods and material plenty would make the Soviets ideologically soft and un-revolutionary, to which Khrushchev replied: &quot;If we could promise the people nothing, except revolution, they would scratch their heads and say: &#x27;Isn&#x27;t it better to have good goulash?

===Personal attacks and USSR technical support ceased===
In the 1960s, public displays of acrimonious quarrels about Marxist–Leninist doctrine characterized relations between hardline Stalinist Chinese and post-Stalinist Soviet Communists. At the Romanian Communist Party Congress, the CCP&#x27;s senior officer Peng Zhen quarrelled with Khrushchev, after the latter had insulted Mao as being a Chinese nationalist, a geopolitical adventurist, and an ideological deviationist from Marxism–Leninism. In turn, Peng insulted Khrushchev as a revisionist whose régime showed him to be a &quot;patriarchal, arbitrary, and tyrannical&quot; ruler. In the event, Khrushchev denounced the PRC with 80 pages of criticism to the congress of the PRC.

In response to the insults, Khrushchev withdrew 1,400 Soviet technicians from the PRC, which cancelled some 200 joint scientific projects. According to Chinese records, the Soviet Union suddenly withdrew 1390 technicians and ended 600 contracts with PRC in 1960. In response, Mao justified his belief that Khrushchev had somehow caused China&#x27;s great economic failures and the famines that occurred in the period of the Great Leap Forward. Nonetheless, the PRC and the USSR remained pragmatic allies, which allowed Mao to alleviate famine in China and to resolve Sino-Indian border disputes. To Mao, Khrushchev had lost political authority and ideological credibility, because his US-Soviet &quot;détente&quot; had resulted in successful military (aerial) espionage against the USSR and public confrontation with an unapologetic capitalist enemy. Khrushchev&#x27;s miscalculation of person and circumstance voided US-Soviet diplomacy at the Four Powers Summit in Paris.

=== Monolithic communism fractured ===
In late 1961, at the 22nd Congress of the CPSU, the PRC and the USSR revisited their doctrinal disputes about the orthodox interpretation and application of Marxism–Leninism. In December 1961, the USSR broke diplomatic relations with Albania, which escalated the Sino-Soviet disputes from the political-party level to the national-government level.

During the &quot;Yi–Ta incident&quot; in 1962, over 60,000 refugees escaped from Xinjiang in western China to the USSR in order to escape persecution. In late 1962, the PRC broke relations with the USSR because Khrushchev did not go to war with the US over the Cuban Missile Crisis. Regarding that Soviet loss-of-face, Mao said that &quot;Khrushchev has moved from adventurism to capitulationism&quot; with a negotiated, bilateral, military stand-down. Khrushchev replied that Mao&#x27;s belligerent foreign policies would lead to an East–West nuclear war. For the Western powers, the averted atomic war threatened by the Cuban Missile Crisis made nuclear disarmament their political priority. To that end, the US, the UK, and the USSR agreed to the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1963, which formally forbade nuclear-detonation tests in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, in outer space, and under water – yet did allow the underground testing and detonation of atomic bombs. In that time, the PRC&#x27;s nuclear-weapons program, Project 596, was nascent, and Mao perceived the test-ban treaty as the nuclear powers&#x27; attempt to thwart the PRC&#x27;s becoming a nuclear superpower.

Between 6 and 20 July 1963, a series of Soviet-Chinese negotiations were held in Moscow. However, both sides maintained their own ideological views and, therefore, negotiations failed. In March 1964, the Romanian Workers&#x27; Party publicly announced the intention of the Bucharest authorities to mediate the Sino-Soviet conflict. In reality, however, the Romanian mediation approach represented only a pretext for forging a Sino-Romanian rapprochement, without arousing the Soviets&#x27; suspicions.

Romania was neutral in the Sino-Soviet split. Its neutrality along with being the small communist country with the most influence in global affairs enabled Romania to be recognized by the world as the &quot;third force&quot; of the communist world. Romania&#x27;s independence - achieved in the early 1960s through its freeing from its Soviet satellite status - was tolerated by Moscow because Romania was surrounded by socialist states and because its ruling party was not going to abandon communism. North Korea under Kim Il Sung also remained neutral because of its strategic status after the Korean War, although it later moved more decisively towards the USSR after Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s Chinese economic reform.

The Italian Communist Party (PCI), one of the largest and most politically influential communist parties in Western Europe, adopted an ambivalent stance towards Mao&#x27;s split from the USSR. Although the PCI chastised Mao for breaking the previous global unity of socialist states and criticised the Cultural Revolution brought about by him, it simultaneously applauded and heaped praise on him for the People&#x27;s Republic of China&#x27;s enormous assistance to North Vietnam in its war against South Vietnam and the United States.

As a Marxist–Leninist, Mao was much angered that Khrushchev did not go to war with the US over their failed Bay of Pigs Invasion and the United States embargo against Cuba of continual economic and agricultural sabotage. For the Eastern Bloc, Mao addressed those Sino-Soviet matters in &quot;Nine Letters&quot; critical of Khrushchev and his leadership of the USSR. Moreover, the break with the USSR allowed Mao to reorient the development of the PRC with formal relations (diplomatic, economic, political) with the countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

=== Formal and informal statements ===

In the 1960s, the Sino-Soviet split allowed only written communications between the PRC and the USSR, in which each country supported their geopolitical actions with formal statements of Marxist–Leninist ideology as the true road to world communism, which is the general line of the party. In June 1963, the PRC published &quot;The Chinese Communist Party&#x27;s Proposal Concerning the General Line of the International Communist Movement&quot;, to which the USSR replied with the &quot;Open Letter of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union&quot;; each ideological stance perpetuated the Sino-Soviet split. In 1964, Mao said that, in light of the Chinese and Soviet differences about the interpretation and practical application of Orthodox Marxism, a counter-revolution had occurred and re-established capitalism in the USSR; consequently, following Soviet suit, the Warsaw Pact countries broke relations with the PRC.

In late 1964, after Nikita Khrushchev had been deposed, Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai met with the new Soviet leaders, First Secretary Leonid Brezhnev and Premier Alexei Kosygin, but their ideological differences proved a diplomatic impasse to renewed economic relations. The Soviet defense minister&#x27;s statement damaged the prospects of improved Sino-Soviet relations. Historian Daniel Leese noted that improvement of the relations &quot;that had seemed possible after Khrushchev&#x27;s fall evaporated after the Soviet minister of defense, Rodion Malinovsky... approached Chinese Marshal He Long, member of the Chinese delegation to Moscow, and asked when China would finally get rid of Mao like the CPSU had disposed of Khrushchev.&quot; Back in China, Zhou reported to Mao that Brezhnev&#x27;s Soviet government retained the policy of peaceful coexistence which Mao had denounced as &quot;Khrushchevism without Khrushchev&quot;; despite the change of leadership, the Sino-Soviet split remained open. At the Glassboro Summit Conference, between Kosygin and US President Lyndon B. Johnson, the PRC accused the USSR of betraying the peoples of the Eastern bloc countries. The official interpretation, by Radio Peking, reported that US and Soviet politicians discussed &quot;a great conspiracy, on a worldwide basis ... criminally selling the rights of the revolution of [the] Vietnam people, [of the] Arabs, as well as [those of] Asian, African, and Latin-American peoples, to US imperialists&quot;.

== Conflict ==
=== Cultural Revolution ===
To regain political supremacy in the PRC, Mao launched the Cultural Revolution in 1966 to counter the Soviet-style bureaucracies (personal-power-centres) that had become established in education, agriculture, and industrial management. Abiding Mao&#x27;s proclamations for universal ideological orthodoxy, schools and universities closed throughout China when students organized themselves into politically radical Red Guards. Lacking a leader, a political purpose, and a social function, the ideologically discrete units of Red Guards soon degenerated into political factions, each of whom claimed to be more Maoist than the other factions. 

In establishing the ideological orthodoxy presented in the Little Red Book (&quot;Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung&quot;), the political violence of the Red Guards provoked civil war in parts of China, known as the violent struggle, which Mao suppressed with the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA), who imprisoned the fractious Red Guards. Moreover, when Red Guard factionalism occurred within the PLA – Mao&#x27;s base of political power – he dissolved the Red Guards, and then reconstituted the CCP with the new generation of Maoists who had endured and survived the Cultural Revolution that purged the &quot;anti-communist&quot; old generation from the party and from China.

As social engineering, the Cultural Revolution reasserted the political primacy of Maoism, but also stressed, strained, and broke the PRC&#x27;s relations with the USSR and the West. The Soviet Union ridiculed and criticized Mao&#x27;s Cultural Revolution fiercely, and some publications in USSR and Eastern Bloc also compared Mao meeting Red Guards on Tiananmen to Adolf Hitler giving speeches to his supporters. Geopolitically, despite their querulous &quot;Maoism vs. Marxism–Leninism&quot; disputes about interpretations and practical applications of Marxism–Leninism, the USSR and the PRC advised, aided, and supplied North Vietnam during the Vietnam War, which Mao had defined as a peasant revolution against foreign imperialism. In socialist solidarity, the PRC allowed safe passage for the Soviet Union&#x27;s &quot;matériel&quot; to North Vietnam to prosecute the war against the US-sponsored Republic of Vietnam, until 1968, after the Chinese withdrawal.
=== Siege of the Soviet embassy in Beijing===
In August 1966 the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent the first of several notes to the Chinese embassy in Moscow protesting aggressive Chinese behavior near the Soviet embassy in Beijing. On January 25, 1967 the Chinese visiting the Lenin Mausoleum on Moscow Red Square jumped over a barrier and began chanting Mao quotes. Then one Chinese allegedly hit a Soviet woman, and a scuffle took place. After this incident new outrages against the Soviet embassy in Beijing began. The threat of physical danger caused the Soviets to evacuate women and children from their embassy in Beijing in February 1967. Even as the women and children were boarding the plane, they were harassed by hostile Red Guards.

=== Border conflict ===
In the late 1960s, the continual quarrelling between the CCP and the CPSU about the correct interpretations and applications of Marxism–Leninism escalated to small-scale warfare at the Sino-Soviet border.

In 1966, for diplomatic resolution, the Chinese revisited the national matter of the Sino-Soviet border demarcated in the 19th century, but originally imposed upon the Qing dynasty by way of unequal treaties that annexed Chinese territory to the Russian Empire. Despite not asking the return of territory, the PRC asked the USSR to acknowledge formally and publicly that such an historic injustice against China (the 19th-century border) was dishonestly realized with the 1858 Treaty of Aigun and the 1860 Convention of Peking. The Soviet government ignored the matter.

In 1968, the Soviet Army had massed along the border with the PRC, especially at the Xinjiang frontier, in north-west China, where the Soviets might readily induce the Turkic peoples into a separatist insurrection. In 1961, the USSR had stationed 12 divisions of soldiers and 200 aeroplanes at that border. By 1968, the Soviet Armed Forces had stationed six divisions of soldiers in Outer Mongolia and 16 divisions, 1,200 aeroplanes, and 120 medium-range missiles at the Sino-Soviet border to confront 47 light divisions of the Chinese Army. By March 1969, the border confrontations escalated, including fighting at the Ussuri River, the Zhenbao Island incident, and Tielieketi.

After the border conflict, &quot;spy wars&quot; involving numerous espionage agents occurred on Soviet and Chinese territory through the 1970s. In 1972, the Soviet Union also renamed placenames in the Russian Far East to the Russian language and Russified toponyms, replacing the native and/or Chinese names.

=== Nuclear China with the US and the USSR ===

==== US strategy on China&#x27;s nuclear development ====

In the early 1960s, the United States feared that a &quot;nuclear China&quot; would imbalance the bi-polar Cold War between the US and the USSR. To keep the PRC from achieving the geopolitical status of a nuclear power, the US administrations of both John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson considered ways either to sabotage or to attack directly the Chinese nuclear program — aided either by Republic of China based in Taiwan or by the USSR. To avert nuclear war, Khrushchev refused the US offer to participate in a US-Soviet pre-emptive attack against the PRC.
To prevent the Chinese from building a nuclear bomb, the United States Armed Forces recommended indirect measures, such as diplomacy and propaganda, and direct measures, such as infiltration and sabotage, an invasion by the Chinese Nationalists in Taiwan, maritime blockades, a South Korean invasion of North Korea, conventional air attacks against the nuclear production facilities, and dropping a nuclear bomb against a &quot;selected CHICOM [Chinese Communist] target&quot;. On 16 October 1964, the PRC detonated their first nuclear bomb, a uranium-235 implosion-fission device, with an explosive yield of 22 kilotons of TNT; and publicly acknowledged the USSR&#x27;s technical assistance in realizing Project 596.

==== Planned Soviet nuclear strike on China ====

According to declassified sources from both the PRC and the United States, the Soviet Union planned to launch a massive nuclear strike on China after the Zhenbao Island incident in 1969. Soviet diplomat Arkady Shevchenko also mentioned in his memoir that &quot;the Soviet leadership had come close to using nuclear arms on China&quot;, while many documents are still classified. As a turning point during the Cold War, this crisis almost led to a major nuclear war, seven years after the Cuban missile crisis. 

On August 18, 1969, Boris N. Davydov, the Second Secretary of the Soviet Embassy to the United States, brought up the idea of a Soviet attack on China&#x27;s nuclear installations, during a luncheon in Washington. According to Chinese sources, then Soviet ambassador to the US, Anatoly Dobrynin, met with Henry Kissinger on August 20 and informed him of Soviet&#x27;s intention to launch nuclear strike on China. On August 21, the US sent out a secret telegram to its embassies worldwide warning that &quot;the Soviets have set in motion an extensive series of measures&quot; which could &quot;permit them a variety of military options&quot;. 

The United States authorities subsequently informed certain US news media regarding the possible Soviet attack, and the latter made the reports public on August 28 and the following days. Among them were a report appearing on &quot;The Washington Post&quot; on August 28, with another one reportedly mentioning further details that the Soviet Union had planned to launch nuclear missiles onto major Chinese cities including Beijing, Changchun and Anshan, as well as China&#x27;s nuclear sites including Jiuquan, Xichang and Lop Nur. Meanwhile, unusual Soviet military activity in the Far East was detected by the US intelligence in the late August, with Soviet&#x27;s &quot;Pravda&quot; on August 28 warning that a war with Communist China, if broke out, would involve &quot;lethal armaments and modern means of delivery&quot; and &quot;would leave no continent untouched.&quot; Besides the United States, the Soviet Union also approached a number of other foreign governments, including its Communist allies, and asked for their opinions and reactions if the Soviet were to launch nuclear strike against China.

As a result, the PRC soon entered the phase of war preparation. On September 11, 1969, Alexei Kosygin, then Premier of the Soviet Union, briefly met with Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai in Beijing after attending the funeral of Ho Chi Minh in Vietnam, in order to de-escalate the tension. On September 16, however, a Soviet journalist with KGB background named Victor Louis again released the warning via &quot;The Evening News&quot; of the United Kingdom that the Soviet might launch nuclear airstrike against China. Chiang Kai-shek, then President of the Republic of China, also recorded numerous outreaches from Victor Louis in 1968 and 1969 on potential cooperation to attack the Communist PRC and re-gain control of mainland China. In the late September, both the USSR and the PRC went on to conduct nuclear tests, with China successfully conducting its first underground nuclear test on September 22. The PRC leadership initially anticipated a Soviet attack on October 1, the National Day of PRC, but when the attack did not come, they soon received new classified intelligence and formed another anticipation of October 20, the scheduled starting day of border negotiations with the Soviets. 

On October 14, 1969, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party released an urgent notification of evacuation to the Party and state leaders in Beijing, requiring all leaders to leave Beijing by October 20 (they eventually returned to Beijing in 1971 after the Lin Biao Incident), with Mao travelling to Wuhan (returned to Beijing in April 1970) and Lin Biao travelling to Suzhou. All central government and military agencies were moved to underground nuclear-proof castles in Western Hills of Beijing, with Zhou Enlai remaining in charge. On October 17, Lin Biao issued an emergency order to put all People&#x27;s Liberation Army personnel on combat alert, and on October 18, Lin&#x27;s followers released the order as &quot;Order Number One&quot;. Over 940,000 soldiers, together with more than four thousand planes and over six hundred ships received evacuation order, while important documents and archives were relocated from Beijing to southwest region of China. 

According to a number of sources, U.S. President Richard Nixon decided to intervene in the end, and on October 15, the Soviet side was informed that the United States would launch nuclear attack on approximately 130 cities in the Soviet Union once the latter began to attack China. The U.S. government confirmed that &quot;the U.S. military, including its nuclear forces, secretly went on alert&quot; in October 1969, known as the Joint Chiefs of Staff Readiness Test, and that Nixon indeed once considered using nuclear weapons. Kissinger recalled in his memoirs that the United States &quot;raised our profile somewhat to make clear that we were not indifferent to these Soviet threats.&quot; Eventually, the Soviet abandoned its attack on China. Researchers and scholars have also speculated that the U.S. authorities might have ordered a nuclear alert in October 1969 in order to deter a Soviet nuclear or conventional attack on China, and such speculation, according to Scott Sagan and Jeremi Suri, &quot;appears logically to be the most likely one&quot;. However, there were also evidence and argument that the nuclear alert was Nixon&#x27;s effort to influence events in North Vietnam. 

In the early 1970, the Chinese military eventually lowered their alert level. Since the late 1960s, the Soviet Union had replaced the US as the primary focus of Chinese nuclear developments. Throughout the 1970s, aware of the Soviet nuclear threat, the PRC built large-scale underground bomb shelters, such as the Underground City in Beijing, and the military bomb shelters of Underground Project 131, a command center in Hubei, and the 816 Nuclear Military Plant, in the Fuling District of Chongqing.

=== Military buildup and geopolitical pragmatism ===

Since October 1969, the USSR and the PRC had engaged in decade-long diplomatic negotiations over border issues. Meanwhile, both sides also continued to increase their military buildup along the border throughout the 1970s. It is estimated that the USSR had placed 1 million to 1.2 million troops along the Soviet-China border (also the Mongolia-China order), and the PRC had placed as many as 1.5 million troops along the border.

The first diplomatic negotiation took place in Beijing on October 20, 1969, attended by the deputy foreign ministers from both sides. Despite the border demarcation remaining indeterminate, the meetings restored Sino-Soviet diplomatic communications, which by 1970 allowed Mao to understand that the PRC could not simultaneously fight the US and the USSR while suppressing internal disorders throughout China. In July 1971, the US advisor for national security, Henry Kissinger, went to Beijing to arrange for President Richard Nixon&#x27;s visit to China. Kissinger&#x27;s Sino-American rapprochement offended the USSR, and Brezhnev then convoked a summit-meeting with Nixon, which re-cast the bi-polar geopolitics of the US-Soviet cold war into the tri-polar geopolitics of the PRC-US-USSR cold war. As relations between the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the United States improved, so too did relations between the Soviet Union and the by now largely unrecognised Republic of China in Taiwan, although this thaw in diplomatic relations stopped well short of any Soviet official recognition of Taiwan.

Concerning the Sino-Soviet disputes about the demarcation of of territorial borders, Soviet propaganda agitated against the PRC&#x27;s complaint about the unequal 1858 Treaty of Aigun and the 1860 Convention of Peking, which cheated Imperial China of territory and natural resources in the 19th century. To that effect, in the 1972–1973 period, the USSR deleted the Chinese and Manchu place-names – Iman (伊曼, Yiman), Tetyukhe (野猪河, yĕzhūhé), and Suchan – from the map of the Russian Far East, and replaced them with the Russian place-names: Dalnerechensk, Dalnegorsk, and Partizansk, respectively. To facilitate social acceptance of such cultural revisionism, the Soviet press misrepresented the historical presence of Chinese people – in lands gained by the Russian Empire – which provoked Russian violence against the local Chinese populations; moreover, politically inconvenient exhibits were removed from museums, and vandals covered with cement the Jurchen-script stele, about the Jin dynasty, in Khabarovsk, some 30 kilometres from the Sino-Soviet border, at the confluence of the Amur and Ussuri rivers.

=== Rivalry in the Third World ===
In the 1970s, the ideological rivalry between the PRC and the USSR extended into the countries of Africa, Asia and of the Middle East, where each socialist country funded the vanguardism of the local Marxist–Leninist parties and militias. Their political advice, financial aid, and military assistance facilitated the realization of wars of national liberation, such as the Ogaden War between Ethiopia and Somalia; the Rhodesian Bush War between white European colonists and anti-colonial black natives; the aftermath of the Bush War, the Zimbabwean Gukurahundi massacres; the Angolan Civil War between competing national-liberation groups of guerrillas, which proved to be a US–Soviet proxy war; the Mozambican Civil War; and the guerrilla factions fighting for the liberation of Palestine. In Thailand, the pro-Chinese front organizations were based upon the local Chinese minority population, and thus proved politically ineffective as a Maoist revolutionary vanguard.

During the Sino-Soviet split, Vietnam initially sought to balance relations with China on one hand and the USSR on the other. Vietnamese leadership was to divided over which of the countries to support. The pro-Soviet group led by Lê Duẩn eventually developed momentum, especially as China sought to improve its relations with the United States, which Vietnamese leadership viewed as a betrayal of the China-Vietnam relationship. Vietnam&#x27;s increasing closeness with the USSR in turn alarmed Chinese leadership, which feared encirclement by the USSR. This contributed to China&#x27;s decision to invade Vietnam, beginning the 1979 Sino-Vietnamese War.

=== Occasional cooperation ===
At times, the &quot;competition&quot; led to the USSR and PRC supporting the same factions in concert, such as when both countries supported North Vietnam during the Vietnam War. Both Soviet and Chinese support was vital for the supply of logistics and equipment to the NLF and PAVN. Most of the supplies were Soviet, sent through China overland. Some analyses find that Chinese economic aid was larger than that of the Soviets as early as 1965–1968. One estimate finds that 1971–1973, the PRC sent the largest amount of aid constituting 90 billion yuan. Soviet supplies flowed freely through China from before 1965 until 1969, when they were cut off. In 1971 however, China encouraged Vietnam to seek more supplies from the Soviet Union. 

From 1972, Chinese premier Zhou Enlai encouraged expeditions of Soviet rail trips, missile shipments, allowed 400 Soviet experts to pass to Vietnam, and on 18 June 1971, reopened Soviet freight in Chinese ports. China then agreed to all Vietnamese requests of allowing Soviet warehouses to store materiel for shipment to Vietnam. The result was a solid, and relatively continuous Communist Bloc support for North Vietnam during the Sino-Soviet split. However, some of the surmounting Soviet and Chinese tensions would grow into the Sino-Vietnamese War in 1979.

== After Mao ==
=== Transition from idealism to pragmatism (1976–1978) ===

In 1971, the politically radical phase of the Cultural Revolution concluded with the failure of Project 571 (the &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; to depose Mao) and the death of the conspirator Marshal Lin Biao (Mao&#x27;s executive officer), who had colluded with the Gang of Four—Jiang Qing (Mao&#x27;s last wife), Zhang Chunqiao, Yao Wenyuan, and Wang Hongwen—to assume command of the PRC. As reactionary political radicals, the Gang of Four argued for regression to Stalinist ideological orthodoxy at the expense of internal economic development, but soon were suppressed by the PRC&#x27;s secret intelligence service.

The re-establishment of Chinese domestic tranquility ended armed confrontation with the USSR but it did not improve diplomatic relations, because in 1973, the Soviet Army garrisons at the Sino-Soviet border were twice as large as in 1969. The continued military threat from the USSR prompted the PRC to denounce &quot;Soviet social imperialism&quot;, by accusing the USSR of being an enemy of world revolution. Mao&#x27;s statement that &quot;the Soviet Union today is under the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, a dictatorship of the big bourgeoisie, a dictatorship of the German fascist type, a dictatorship of the Hitler type.&quot; was also repeated by China&#x27;s state press many times in the 1970s, reiterating the diplomatic position. Sino-Soviet relations would slowly and gradually improve during the 1980s.

Soon after Mao&#x27;s death in September 1976, the Gang of Four were arrested, putting an end to the Cultural Revolution. Hua Guofeng succeeded as the paramount leader of China, but only briefly. At the 11th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in summer 1977, the politically rehabilitated Deng Xiaoping was appointed to manage internal modernization programs, and in December 1978, Deng replaced Hua as the new paramount leader at the 3rd plenary session of the 11th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. Avoiding attacks upon Mao, Deng&#x27;s political moderation began the realization of Chinese economic reform by way of systematic reversals of Mao&#x27;s inefficient policies, and the transition from a planned economy to a socialist market economy.

=== From confrontation to thaw (1978–1989) ===
In 1978, the United States and the PRC began to establish diplomatic relations. On January 1, 1979, the two countries formally established diplomatic relation, soon followed by Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s visit to the United States, when Deng met with US President Jimmy Carter and discussed the relations among PRC, USSR and the US. During the visit, Deng informed Carter of China&#x27;s intention to attack Vietnam, who was backed by the Soviet Union, in response to the Vietnam&#x27;s invasion of Cambodia which ended the rule of Khmer Rouge backed by the PRC. The Soviet Union provided intelligence and equipment support for Vietnam during the 1979 Sino-Vietnamese War, meanwhile Soviet troops were deployed at the Sino-Soviet and Mongolian-Chinese border as an act of showing support to Vietnam. However, the Soviet Union refused to take any direct action to defend their ally. 

In December 1979, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan led the Chinese to suspend the talks on normalizing relations with the Soviet Union, which began in September of the same year. China also declared no intention to renew the expired &quot;Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance&quot; in 1979&quot;,&quot; and over the next several years, China trained anti-Soviet Afghan mujahideen forces and provided them with millions of dollars of weaponry. The PRC also joined the US-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympic Games in Moscow. In the Soviet–Afghan War, China covertly supported the opposing guerillas; even before the Soviet deployment, Moscow had accused Peking of using a newly built highway from Xinjiang to Hunza in Pakistan to arm Afghan rebels, which China denied. The KGB and Afghan KHAD cracked down on many prominent pro-China and anti-Soviet activists and guerillas in 1980. 
On the other hand, the US-China military cooperation began in 1979 and in 1981 it was revealed that a joint US-China listening post had been operated in Xinjiang to monitor Soviet missile testing bases. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the PRC under Deng went through the &quot;Boluan Fanzheng&quot; period and started &quot;Reform and Opening&quot; after the Cultural Revolution, pursuing &quot;Realpolitik&quot; policies such as &quot;seeking truth from facts&quot; and the &quot;Chinese road to socialism&quot;, which withdrew the PRC from the high-level abstractions of ideology, polemic as well as the revisionism of the USSR, therefore diminishing the political importance of the Sino-Soviet split. In March 1982, then Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev delivered a speech in Tashkent, in which he made an appeal for improved relations with the PRC, saying &quot;We remember well the time when the Soviet Union and People&#x27;s China were united by bonds of friendship and comradely cooperation.&quot;

In the autumn of 1982, the Sino-Soviet negotiations resumed. In March 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev &quot;reaffirmed that the Soviet side would like to have a serious improvement of relations with the PRC&quot;. Deng Xiaoping pointed out three major obstacles to normalizing the relation with the USSR: the Soviet Union&#x27;s support over Vietnam&#x27;s invasion of Cambodia, the Soviet&#x27;s massive military buildup along Sino-Soviet as well as Sino-Mongolian border, and Soviet&#x27;s armed occupation of Afghanistan. The Sino-Soviet relations were finally normalized after Mikhail Gorbachev visited China in 1989 and shook Deng&#x27;s hand. The meeting took place right before the Tiananmen Square Massacre in June 1989, for which the Soviets expressed diverging opinions at many levels, from the official rhetoric, to media coverage and to the public reaction.

<text>The Valençay SOE Memorial is a monument in France to the members of the Special Operations Executive F Section who died working to liberate the country during World War II.

The memorial was unveiled in the town of Valençay, in the department of Indre, on May 6, 1991, marking the fiftieth anniversary of the despatch of F Section&#x27;s first agent to France.

Former SOE agents Pearl Witherington Cornioley and her husband Henri, who lived nearby, promoted the establishment of the memorial. Witherington had worked in the area as a SOE agent during World war II. The monument was designed by Elizabeth Lucas Harrison, herself a former Resistance member, who originally gave it the name &quot;Spirit of Partnership&quot;.

Dedicated by the Minister of Veterans Affairs for France and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, the memorial&#x27;s &quot;Roll of Honour&quot; lists the names of the 91 men and 13 women members of the SOE who gave their lives for France&#x27;s freedom.

<doc id="353826" wikidata="Q1431787" url="?curid=353826" title="The Manhattan Transfer">
<text>The Manhattan Transfer was an American vocal group founded in 1969 in New York City, performing music genres like a cappella, Brazilian jazz, swing, vocalese, rhythm and blues, pop, and standards. They have won eleven Grammy Awards.

There have been several incarnations and formations of the Manhattan Transfer, with each edition having different styles. 

The first and original rendition was in the 1960s, consisting of a mostly a cappella-tinged style; it featured Tim Hauser, Erin Dickins, Marty Nelson, Pat Rosalia, and Gene Pistilli. The second version of the group, formed in 1972, incorporating a more vocal jazz approach, consisted of Hauser, Alan Paul, Janis Siegel, and Laurel Massé.

The third, and most commercially perceived, formation of the group happened in 1979, because Massé had to leave the group after being badly injured in a car crash and was replaced by Cheryl Bentyne. This edition of the Manhattan Transfer performed electronic-styled pop, soul, funk, and rhythmic music, having success in the 1980s.

The group&#x27;s fourth edition, since the 1990s, originally consisted of Hauser, Paul, Siegel, and Bentyne, and performed mostly cool and smooth jazz. It also had several rotating touring members, and longtime pianist Yaron Gershovsky accompanied the group on tour and served as music director. Trist Curless from the Los Angeles a cappella group m-pact became a permanent member in October 2014 following Hauser&#x27;s death.

==Early years==
In 1969, Tim Hauser formed a vocal group in New York City called The Manhattan Transfer after the novel by John Dos Passos. The group consisted of Hauser, Erin Dickins, Marty Nelson, Pat Rosalia, and Gene Pistilli. This group made one album, &quot;Jukin&#x27;&quot; (Capitol, 1971), which looked at the jazz music of the past as well as rock and country genres unlike the later incarnations of the group. They were not picked up by Capitol Records for a second album, and the group broke up in 1973.

Shortly thereafter, Hauser met Laurel Massé while he was a cab driver and she was his passenger. Soon after, he met Janis Siegel. During this time, session drummer Roy Markowitz, who had played with Janis Joplin and recorded with Don McLean, attended a performance of the group and convinced Tim to change the group&#x27;s direction. Roy was in the Broadway band of &quot;Grease&quot; and introduced one of its cast members, Alan Paul (who played the dual role of bandleader Johnny Casino and the Teen Angel), to Tim. Thus began another version of The Manhattan Transfer. After performing in clubs in New York City, the quartet asked Roy to produce a demo to present to Ahmet Ertegun at Atlantic Records. The demo was a success and Atlantic released its debut album with guest appearances by bona fide jazz musicians Randy Brecker, Jon Faddis, and Zoot Sims. &quot;The Manhattan Transfer&quot; (Atlantic, 1975) eschewed the condescension of the previous album, presenting instead serious vocalese renditions of &quot;Java Jive&quot; and &quot;Tuxedo Junction&quot; and scoring a Hot 100 top 25 hit with the gospel-tinged &quot;Operator.&quot; During the month of August 1975, the group hosted a four-week variety series on CBS-TV. The hour-long show was simply called &quot;The Manhattan Transfer&quot;, aired on Sunday evenings, and for the most part concentrated on showcasing the talents of the group. Their next album, &quot;Coming Out&quot; (1976), produced &quot;Chanson d&#x27;Amour,&quot; which was a number one hit in the UK and Ireland.

==Bentyne and &quot;Birdland&quot;==
In 1978, Laurel Massé was in a car crash and dropped out of the group. She was replaced by Cheryl Bentyne. The group&#x27;s next album, &quot;Extensions&quot; (Atlantic, 1979), produced the hit &quot;Twilight Zone/Twilight Tone&quot;, a song based on the TV series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; (including an impersonation of Rod Serling&#x27;s narration from Alan Paul). 

&quot;Extensions&quot; featured a cover version of &quot;Birdland&quot;, an instrumental by the jazz fusion group Weather Report, with lyrics by Jon Hendricks of Lambert, Hendricks, and Ross. One of the most popular jazz recordings of 1980, &quot;Birdland&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best Jazz Fusion Performance, while Janis Siegel won the Grammy Award for Best Vocal Arrangement.

In 1981, the Manhattan Transfer made music history by becoming the first group to win Grammy awards for both popular and jazz categories in the same year. &quot;The Boy from New York City&quot;, a cover of the 1965 success by The Ad Libs, reached the Top 10 on the Hot 100 and won them the award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, and &quot;Until I Met You (Corner Pocket)&quot; earned them a Grammy Award for Best Jazz Vocal Performance, Duo or Group. Both of these songs appeared on the group&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;Mecca for Moderns&quot; (Atlantic, 1981). In 1982, the group won another Grammy, for Best Jazz Vocal Performance, Duo or Group, for its rendition of &quot;Route 66&quot;. The song was featured on the soundtrack to the Burt Reynolds film &quot;Sharky&#x27;s Machine&quot;.

==Stretching out==
In September 1983, the group released the album &quot;Bodies and Souls,&quot; with an urban-contemporary style which resulted in two R&amp;B chart singles. The first was the No. 2 hit &quot;Spice of Life&quot;, which was co-written by former Heatwave member Rod Temperton who had penned several hits for Michael Jackson. The single also reached No. 40 on the US pop chart and No. 19 in the UK. The other single, the ballad &quot;Mystery&quot; (#80 R&amp;B, No. 102 Pop), was later covered by Anita Baker on her 1986 album &quot;Rapture&quot;.

In 1985, the group released two albums; the first was &quot;Bop Doo-Wopp&quot;, which included both live and studio recordings, and the second was &quot;Vocalese&quot;, which received twelve Grammy nominations—at the time making it second only to Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot; as the most nominated single album ever. The group won in two categories: Best Jazz Vocal Performance, Duo or Group, and Best Arrangement for Voices. This was followed by a live recording of many of these songs titled &quot;Live&quot;. This concert, recorded in Japan, was also released on VHS and DVD, later titled &quot;Vocalese Live&quot;.

For their next album, &quot;Brasil&quot; (1987), the group headed south to work with Brazilian songwriters and musicians Ivan Lins, Milton Nascimento, Djavan and Gilberto Gil. &quot;Brasil&quot; won a Grammy for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal.

The group did not release any studio albums again until 1991, when they signed with the Sony Music label and released &quot;The Offbeat of Avenues&quot;, featuring original material written or co-written by members of the quartet. Their efforts brought them their 10th Grammy award, for the song &quot;Sassy&quot;. This was followed by the release of their first holiday album entitled &quot;The Christmas Album&quot; in 1992.

Switching back to Atlantic Records as their distributor, they released &quot;Tonin&#x27;&quot; (a collection of R&amp;B and popular successes from the 1960s), &quot;The Manhattan Transfer Meets Tubby the Tuba&quot; (a children&#x27;s album), and their 1997 album &quot;Swing&quot; which covered 1930s-era swing music. Their final album for Atlantic was &quot;The Spirit of St. Louis&quot; in 2000, dedicated to the music of Louis Armstrong. The group was inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 1998.

==Since 2000==
The group signed to the Telarc label in 2003 to release &quot;Couldn&#x27;t Be Hotter&quot;, a live performance capturing many of the songs from &quot;The Spirit of St. Louis&quot;. In 2004, the group released &quot;Vibrate&quot;, another one of their &quot;pastich&quot; albums, blending original tunes with older ones, pop, jazz and funk. &quot;Vibrate&quot; featured notable musicians such as bassist Will Lee and Steve Hass on drums. They also released, first in Japan, their second holiday album, &quot;An Acapella Christmas&quot;, in 2005. The album was released in the U.S. in 2006.

During 2006, the group released &quot;The Symphony Sessions&quot;, a collection of some of their best-known songs re-recorded with an orchestra, and also &quot;The Definitive Pop Collection&quot;, a two-disc collection of the group&#x27;s material from their Atlantic Records period. They also recorded their first original title song for a movie, &quot;Trail of the Screaming Forehead&quot;; and, in late 2006, the group released a new concert DVD, &quot;The Christmas Concert&quot;, which was broadcast by PBS.

&quot;The Chick Corea Songbook&quot;, a tribute to the works of that American jazz musician, was released in September 2009. The album features an appearance by Corea himself on the track &quot;Free Samba&quot;. Other prominent musicians on this recording are Airto Moreira, Scott Kinsey, Steve Hass, Alex Acuña, Jimmy Earl, John Benitez, and Christian McBride.

In 2011, The Manhattan Transfer worked on an album of previously recorded, but never finished, songs to honor their 40th anniversary. &quot;We are working on a project now that is called &quot;The Vaults&quot;. Over the years, there are a lot of different songs that we recorded but never finished. We pull out from the archives a lot of these songs and are finishing them,&quot; said Alan Paul in an interview for Jazz FM radio in Bulgaria. One of the highlights of the album was a vocalese version of George and Ira Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;The Man I Love,&quot; based on an Artie Shaw and His Orchestra performance of the composition, which had originally been slated for the &quot;Swing&quot; album.

==Substitutes and fourth line-up==

Original member Pat Rosalia died from cancer in July 2011. 

In 2011, while receiving treatment for Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma, Cheryl Bentyne was replaced on stage for eight months by the soprano Margaret Dorn; Dorn replaced her again December 2013 (followed by Katie Campbell in early 2014) while Bentyne underwent further treatment. Tim Hauser was absent from the stage in 2013 and early 2014 as he recovered from spinal surgery; he was replaced on stage by bass/baritone Trist Curless of the a cappella group m-pact.

In September 2013, one of the original members of the group, Erin Dickins, started a Kickstarter campaign to re-record &quot;Java Jive&quot; with the surviving original members. It featured Tim Hauser&#x27;s scat musings, as well as a vocal arrangement by Marty Nelson, sung by Dickins, Nelson, Hauser and Gene Pistilli. The project was successfully funded on October 9, 2013, and released on the CD &quot;Java Jive&quot; on Dot Time Records. 

Tim Hauser died of cardiac arrest on October 16, 2014. Following Hauser&#x27;s death, the group announced Curless would replace him.

Gene Pistilli died on December 26, 2017.

<doc id="353831" wikidata="Q445829" url="?curid=353831" title="Manu Dibango">
<text>Emmanuel N&#x27;Djoké &quot;Manu&quot; Dibango (12 December 1933 – 24 March 2020) was a Cameroonian musician and songwriter who played saxophone and vibraphone. He developed a musical style fusing jazz, funk, and traditional Cameroonian music. His father was a member of the Yabassi ethnic group, while his mother was a Duala. He was best known for his 1972 single &quot;Soul Makossa&quot;. The song has been referred to as the most sampled African song in addition Dibango, himself, as the most sampled African musician in history. He died from COVID-19 on 24 March 2020.

== Early life ==
Emmanuel &quot;Manu&quot; Dibango was born in Douala, Cameroon in 1933. His father, Michel Manfred N&#x27;Djoké Dibango, was a civil servant. Son of a farmer, he met his wife travelling by pirogue to her residence, Douala. Emmanuel&#x27;s mother was a fashion designer, running her own small business. Both her ethnic group, the Douala, and his, the Yabassi, viewed this union of different ethnic groups with some disdain. Dibango had only a stepbrother from his father&#x27;s previous marriage, who was four years older than him. In Cameroon, one&#x27;s ethnicity is dictated by one&#x27;s father, though Dibango wrote in his autobiography, &quot;Three Kilos of Coffee&quot;, that he had &quot;never been able to identify completely with either of [his] parents&quot;.

Dibango&#x27;s uncle was the leader of his extended family. Upon his death, Dibango&#x27;s father refused to take over, as he never fully initiated his son into Yabassi customs. Throughout his childhood, Dibango slowly forgot the Yabassi language in favour of the Douala. However, his family did live in the Yabassi encampment on the Yabassi plateau, close to the Wouri River in central Douala. While a child, Dibango attended Protestant church every night for religious education, or &quot;nkouaida&quot;. He enjoyed studying music there, and reportedly was a fast learner.

In 1941, after being educated at his village school, Dibango was accepted into a colonial school, near his home, where he learned French. He admired the teacher, whom he described as &quot;an extraordinary draftsman and painter&quot;. In 1944, French president Charles de Gaulle chose this school to perform the welcoming ceremonies upon his arrival in Cameroon.

In 1949, at age 15, Dibango was sent to college in Saint-Calais, France. After that he attended the lycée de Chartres where he learned the piano.

==Career==
Dibango was a member of the seminal Congolese rumba group African Jazz and collaborated with many other musicians, including Fania All Stars, Fela Kuti, Herbie Hancock, Bill Laswell, Bernie Worrell, Ladysmith Black Mambazo, King Sunny Adé, Don Cherry, and Sly and Robbie. He achieved a considerable following in the UK with a disco hit called &quot;Big Blow&quot;, originally released in 1976 and re-mixed as a single in 1978 on Island Records. In 1998, he recorded the album &quot;CubAfrica&quot; with Cuban artist Eliades Ochoa. At the 16th Annual Grammy Awards in 1974, he was nominated in the categories Best R&amp;B Instrumental Performance and Best Instrumental Composition for &quot;Soul Makossa&quot;.

The lyrics of the song &quot;Soul Makossa&quot; on the record of the same name contain the word &quot;makossa&quot;, which refers to a style of Cameroonian urban music and means &quot;(I) dance&quot; in Dibango&#x27;s native tongue, the Cameroonian language Duala. The song has influenced popular music hits, including Kool and the Gang&#x27;s &quot;Jungle Boogie&quot;. 

He served as the first chairman of the Cameroon Music Corporation, with a high profile in disputes about artists&#x27; royalties. Dibango was appointed a UNESCO Artist for Peace in 2004.

His song &quot;Reggae Makossa&quot; is featured on the soundtrack to the 2006 video game &quot;&quot;. In August 2009, he played the closing concert at the revived Brecon Jazz Festival.

His song &quot;New Bell&quot; in featured on the soundtrack to the 2008 video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot; in the radio station &quot;International Funk 99&quot;.

In 1982, Michael Jackson used the &quot;Ma ma-se, ma ma-sa, ma ma-kossa&quot; hook from Dibango&#x27;s 1972 single &quot;Soul Makossa&quot; without his permission and without credit for his 1983 song &quot;Wanna Be Startin&#x27; Somethin&#x27;&quot; from his superhit 1982 album &quot;Thriller&quot;. When Dibango found out he considered suing the megastar, but Jackson was quick to admit that he borrowed the line and the matter was settled out of court.In 2007, Rihanna sampled the same hook from Jackson&#x27;s song for her track &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop the Music&quot; and did not credit Dibango. When Rihanna had asked Jackson for permission to sample the line, he allegedly approved the request without contacting Dibango beforehand. In 2009, Dibango sued both singers. Dibango&#x27;s attorneys brought the case before a court in Paris, demanding €500,000 in damages and asking for Sony BMG, EMI and Warner Music to be &quot;barred from receiving &#x27;mama-se mama-sa&#x27;-related income until the matter is resolved&quot;. The judge ruled that Dibango&#x27;s claim was inadmissible: a year earlier, a different Paris-area judge had required Universal Music to include Dibango&#x27;s name in the liner notes of future French releases of &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop the Music&quot;, and, at the time of this earlier court appearance, Dibango had withdrawn legal action, thereby waiving his right to seek further damages.

In July 2014, he performed an 80th birthday concert at the Olympia in Paris which was broadcast by TV5Monde.

On 8 September 2015, Michaëlle Jean, Secretary General of the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie, honoured Manu Dibango with the title of Grand Témoin de la Francophonie aux Jeux Olympiques et Paralympiques de Rio 2016.
==Death==

On 24 March 2020, Dibango died from COVID-19 in France Melun near Paris. The news of his death was confirmed by his family via social media (Twitter). In response, many musicians and fans praised him as a musician and composer. He was 86.

<text>The London County Council (LCC) was the principal local government body for the County of London throughout its existence from 1889 to 1965, and the first London-wide general municipal authority to be directly elected. It covered the area today known as Inner London and was replaced by the Greater London Council. The LCC was the largest, most significant and most ambitious English municipal authority of its day.

==History==
By the 19th century, the City of London Corporation covered only a small fraction of metropolitan London. From 1855, the Metropolitan Board of Works (MBW) had certain powers across the metropolis, but it was appointed rather than elected. Many powers remained in the hands of traditional bodies such as parishes and the counties of Middlesex, Surrey and Kent. The creation of the LCC in 1889, as part of the Local Government Act 1888, was forced by a succession of scandals involving the MBW, and was also prompted by a general desire to create a competent government for the city, capable of strategising and delivering services effectively. While the Conservative government of the day would have preferred not to create a single body covering the whole of London, their electoral pact with Liberal Unionists led them to this policy. It was established as a provisional council on 31 January 1889 and came into its powers on 21 March 1889. Shortly after its creation a Royal Commission on the Amalgamation of the City and County of London considered the means for amalgamation with the City of London. Although this was not achieved, it led to the creation of 28 metropolitan boroughs as lower tier authorities to replace the various local vestries and boards in 1900; they assumed some powers of the LCC and shared others.

The LCC provided very few services within the City of London, where the ancient Corporation monopolised local governance.

==Powers and duties==
The LCC inherited the powers of its predecessor the MBW, but had wider authority over matters such as education, city planning and council housing. It took over the functions of the London School Board in 1903, and Dr C W Kimmins was appointed chief inspector of the education department in 1904.

From 1899, the Council progressively acquired and operated the tramways in the county, which it electrified from 1903. By 1933, when the LCC Tramways were taken over by the London Passenger Transport Board, it was the largest tram operator in the United Kingdom, with more than of route and over 1,700 tramcars.

===Housing reform===
One of the LCC&#x27;s most important roles during the late 19th and early 20th century, was in the management of the expanding city and the re-development of its growing slums. In the Victorian era, new housing had been intentionally urban and large-scale tenement buildings dominated. Beginning in the 1930s, the LCC incentivised an increase in more suburban housing styles. A less-dense style of development, focusing on single family homes, was popular among London housing developers because it was believed that this would satisfy the working classes and provide insurance, &quot;against Bolshevism,&quot; to quote one parliamentary secretary. The LCC set the standard for new construction at 12 houses per acre of land at a time when some London areas had as many as 80 housing units per acre. The passage of the Housing of the Working Classes Act in 1885 gave the LCC the power to compel the sale of land for housing development, a power that was vital to the systematic rehousing that began under the council&#x27;s early Progressive leadership.

The Totterdown Fields development at Tooting was the first large suburban-style development to be built under LCC authority, in 1903, and was quickly followed by developments at Roehampton, Bellingham, and Becontree. By 1938, 76,877 units of housing had been built under the auspices of the LCC in the city and its periphery, an astonishing number given the previous pace of development. Many of these new housing developments were genuinely working-class, though the poorest could rarely afford even subsidised rents. They relied on an expanding London Underground network that ferried workers en masse to places of employment in central London. These housing developments were broadly successful, and they resisted the slummification that blighted so many Victorian tenement developments. The success of these commuter developments constructed by the LCC in the periphery of the city is, &quot;one of the more remarkable achievements in London government, and contributed much to the marked improvement of conditions between the wars for the capital&#x27;s working classes.&quot;

The LCC also built overspill estates outside London (some after World War II) including Debden in Essex, Merstham and Sheerwater in Surrey, and Edenbridge in Kent.

===Street renaming===
The MBW, and the LCC undertook between 1857 and 1945 to standardise and clarify street names across London. Many streets in different areas of the city had similar or identical names, and the rise of the car as a primary mode of transportation in the city sometimes made the duplication of names challenging. In an extreme case, there were over 60 streets called &quot;Cross Street&quot; spread across London when the LCC began its process of systematic renaming. These were given names from an approved list that was maintained by the LCC, containing only &quot;suitably English&quot; names. If street names were deemed un-English, they were also slated for change; Zulu Crescent in Battersea, for instance, became Rowena Crescent in 1912.

===Second World War era===
By 1939, the council had the following powers and duties:

† &quot;Denotes a power administered by the City of London Corporation within the City.&quot;

==Headquarters==

===Spring Gardens===

The LCC initially used the Spring Gardens headquarters inherited from the Metropolitan Board of Works. The building had been designed by Frederick Marrable, the MBW&#x27;s superintending architect, and dated from 1860. Opinions on the merits of the building varied: the Survey of London described it as &quot;well balanced&quot; while the architectural correspondent of &quot;The Times&quot; was less enthusiastic. He summarised the building as &quot;of the Palladian type of four storeys with two orders, Ionic above and Corinthian below as if its designer had looked rather hastily at the banqueting house of Inigo Jones.&quot; The most impressive feature was the curving or elliptical spiral staircase leading to the principal floor. The original board room was too small to accommodate meetings of the new council, and it was soon replaced by a horseshoe-shaped council chamber.

===Search for a new site===
By 1893, it was clear that the Spring Gardens building was too small for the increased work of the LCC. Seven additional buildings within a quarter of a mile of the County Hall had been acquired, and it was estimated that they would need to take over an average of two more houses annually. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir William Harcourt, offered the council a site at Parliament Street, Westminster for three-quarters of a million pounds. Another site subsequently became available between The Strand and The Embankment, when the Official Receiver took over the partially completed premises of the failed Liberator Building Society. The council&#x27;s Establishment Committee recommended the purchase of the Parliament Street lot, as it would be a prominent site opposite the Palace of Westminster and next to the principal government offices. Following a debate of the whole council, the committee&#x27;s recommendation was rejected on financial grounds and as it was felt that the headquarters should not be in the privileged West End.

The matter remained unresolved, and in 1900 a special committee was formed by the council to seek out a suitable site. In July 1902, they presented their report, recommending a site in the Adelphi. Entry roads to the proposed county hall would be made from The Strand and The Embankment. The council rejected the recommendations in October 1902, and a suggestion was made that the committee seek a site south of the Thames, adjacent to Westminster Bridge.

===County Hall, Lambeth===
In April 1905, the council finally agreed to seek powers to buy three adjoining plots of land on the eastern side of Westminster Bridge as a site for a single headquarters. The debate in the council chamber was somewhat heated with one councillor objecting to the purchase as it was &quot;on the wrong side of the river ... in a very squalid neighbourhood ... and quite unworthy of the dignity of a body like the council&quot;. Leading member of the council, John Burns countered that it &quot;would brighten up a dull place, sweeten a sour spot and for the first time bring the south of London into a dignified and beautiful frontage on the River Thames.&quot;

The necessary powers were obtained under the London County Council (Money) Act 1906, and a competition to design the new building was organised.
There were approximately 100 entries, and the winner was the 29-year-old Ralph Knott. Construction began in 1911, and the first section was opened in 1922, with the original building completed in 1933. Extensions continued to be made throughout the council&#x27;s existence.

==Politics==
===Elections===

The county was divided into electoral divisions, co-terminous with parliamentary constituencies. Initially, each returned two councillors, save for the City of London, which returned four. Under the Representation of the People Act 1948 this was altered, to three each. Elections of all councillors were held every three years save that none were held in the First and Second World Wars.

Complementing the elected councillors and of equal power but longer tenure the council appointed one county alderman for every six councillors. These were elected &quot;by halves&quot; (as to half of their number) by the council for a six-year term at the first meeting after each election.

===Control===
Initially, it had been hoped by many that elections to the LCC would be conducted on a non-partisan basis, but in the council two political groups formed. The majority group in 1889 was the Progressives, who were unofficially allied with the Liberal Party in national politics. Those who allied with the Conservative Party formed the Moderate group. In 1906, the Moderates became known as the Municipal Reform Party.

The LCC was elected every three years. The Progressives were in control continuously from 1889 until 1907, when they lost power to the Municipal Reformers. Municipal Reform control lasted until 1934 when Labour won power, which they kept until the LCC was abolished.

Council composition:


===Leaders===

The post of leader of the council was only officially recognised in 1933. This table gives the leaders of the majority parties on the council before this time.

===Chairmen and vice chairmen===
The county council was required by statute to appoint a chairman and a vice chairman at its annual meeting. Both of these positions were generally filled by members of the majority party. The chairman chaired meetings of the council, and was the county&#x27;s civic leader, filling a similar role to the mayor of a borough or city. The vice chairman performed these functions in his absence. The first chairman was the Earl of Rosebery, and the last chairman was Arthur Wicks.

The chairmanship was a prestigious office, second only to that of lord lieutenant. The incumbent chairmen were honoured with knighthoods on the occasions of the coronations of Edward VII and Elizabeth II, and the laying of the foundation stone of County Hall. As part of the celebrations of the Silver Jubilee of George V in 1935 it was announced that the chairman would in future be entitled to use the style &quot;right honourable&quot;, an honour already enjoyed by the Lord Mayor of the City of London.

====Deputies====
The council&#x27;s standing orders also provided for the post of deputy chairman. Until 1895, the holder of this office was in charge of the organisation of the council&#x27;s activities, and was paid a salary. This was seen as a conflict of interest by the Royal Commission on the Amalgamation of the City and County of London when they reported in 1894, and in 1895 a county clerk was added to the council staff to perform these duties. The deputy chairmanship then became purely ceremonial, and was filled by nominees of the opposition party on the council.

==Abolition==

After World War II, it became evident that the London County Council was too small to cope with the greater demands being placed on local government by the new Welfare State. In 1957, a Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London was set up under Sir Edwin Herbert to examine the issues and make recommendations. The Commission deliberated for three years and in 1960 it recommended a major restructuring of local government in London. This included the abolition of all existing local authorities with the exception of the City of London Corporation; a Greater London Council was to be established along with 32 new lower-tier London boroughs with populations of 100,000 to 250,000 each. The new boroughs would split the responsibility for government functions with the Greater London Council.

The Royal Commission&#x27;s report led to the Bill for the London Government Act 1963, and when this was introduced into Parliament it initially faced considerable opposition. The Bill passed into law with some minor amendments. An Inner London Education Authority was set up for education to be overseen on a broad county level. The first elections for the new Greater London Council were held on 9 April 1964. The London County Council ran concurrently for a year with the new Greater London Council to ensure a seamless transition, and the LCC was finally abolished on 1 April 1965. The Royal Commission commented that &quot;nobody studying London Government can fail to be deeply impressed with the achievements of the London County Council. It has given the Administrative County of London a strong and able form of government which makes its standing very high among the municipal governments of the world.&quot;

<text>Leicester railway station (formerly Leicester Campbell Street and Leicester London Road) is a mainline railway station in the city of Leicester in Leicestershire, England. The station is managed by East Midlands Railway and owned by Network Rail. The station is served by CrossCountry and East Midlands Railway services. It is the busiest station in Leicestershire, the second busiest station in the East Midlands, and the fifth busiest station in the Midlands as a whole.

Leicester station was opened in 1840 by the Midland Counties Railway and rebuilt in 1894 and 1978. It is on the Midland Main Line, which runs from London St Pancras to and . It is north of London St Pancras.

==Background==
The first station on the site opened on 5 May 1840. It was originally known simply as Leicester, becoming Leicester Campbell Street on 1 June 1867, and Leicester London Road from 12 June 1892. This was replaced in 1894 by a new station, also called Leicester London Road but usually referred to as the &quot;Midland Station&quot; to differentiate from Leicester Central station. Following the closure of Leicester Central on 5 May 1969, this station was renamed Leicester.

Besides London Road and Central, the city of Leicester was served by Belgrave Road, Humberstone Road and West Bridge railway stations.

==History==

Leicester was one of the first cities (though then a town) to be served by a railway, when the Leicester and Swannington Railway built its terminus station at West Bridge on the western side of Leicester in 1832. The Leicester and Swannington Railway was later absorbed by the Midland Railway.

In total, Leicester had seven railway stations (eight if the two sites at West Bridge are treated separately). In addition to the current Leicester station, three other main railway stations existed. The original station at West Bridge closed to passengers in 1928. &quot;Leicester Belgrave Road&quot; (on the Great Northern Railway) closed to passengers in 1962 and &quot;Leicester Central&quot; (on the Great Central Railway) closed in May 1969. From 1892 up until this time, the current Leicester station was known as &quot;Leicester London Road&quot;.

In addition, there were smaller stations within the city boundary at Humberstone Road on the LMS, Humberstone on the GNR, and, from 1874 until 1918, a halt at Welford Road was operated on the Leicester – London main line allowing access to the Cattle Market. At this halt, passengers were allowed to leave the trains but not to board them.

===The station buildings===

The contract for the first station on the present site was awarded by the Midland Counties Railway to Waterfield and Smith, and was just under £15,000 ().

It was first used on 4 May 1840, when a train of four first and six second-class carriages, pulled by the &quot;Leopard&quot; steam engine, arrived from Nottingham. As was normal in those days with a through station, the original plan was to build it to the side of the main line, but instead it was finally built on the main line with a single platform 165 yards long to handle both northbound and southbound trains. The station was designed by William Parsons in the Grecian Revival style, with a two-storey main building which was embellished with a central pediment set forward on fluted columns in front. This was flanked by short single-storey wings. It was the headquarters of the Midland Counties Railway until that railway was amalgamated into the Midland Railway in 1844. Upstairs were the company offices and boardroom, while downstairs was the booking hall, waiting and refreshment rooms.

The opening of new routes to Leicester led to steadily increasing traffic and, by 1858, a second platform had been built to handle southbound traffic, so leaving the original platform to handle northbound traffic. In 1868, it was decided to turn the southbound platform into an island platform to further increase capacity, but this was not possible with the northbound platform due to the presence of the main buildings and station entrance.

Further expansion was contemplated for some time, but it was not until 1890 that the go ahead was given for Campbell Street station to be replaced by the present &quot;Leicester railway station&quot;. All that remains of the first station is a pair of gateposts in an Egyptian style at the end of Station Street. The offices for Royal Mail now occupy some of the site of the old station buildings on Campbell Street.

The Midland Railway completely rebuilt the station between 1892 and 1894 to a design by the architect Charles Trubshaw. The new booking office was opened by the mayor in June 1892 when it was renamed Leicester London Road. The station was completed in 1894. The frontage on London Road featured four entrance archways. Above each of the left-hand pair the word &quot;Departure&quot; was inscribed and, above each of the other two, the word &quot;Arrival&quot; was carved in relief. These signs were to assist cab drivers when dropping passengers who intended to catch departing trains, or were plying for hire by passengers who had arrived by train.

The new station frontage on London Road remains as a well-preserved late Victorian building, but the interior of the booking hall and the structures on the platforms were reconstructed by Sir Robert McAlpine in 1978.

The station clock is the only hand-wound station clock in the UK.

A commemorative statue of Thomas Cook was placed on the pavement outside the present station in 1991 to mark the first excursions arranged by the travel agency magnate. It was sculpted by James Butler.

===London, Midland and Scottish Railway===
Until the line from Matlock to Chinley through Millers Dale was closed by the Beeching cuts, the &#x27;main lines&#x27; were those from London to Manchester, carrying named expresses such as &quot;The Palatine&quot;. Express trains to Leeds and Scotland such as the &quot;Thames-Clyde Express&quot; tended to use the Erewash Valley Line before proceeding on to the Settle and Carlisle Line. Expresses to Edinburgh, such as &quot;The Waverley&quot; travelled through Corby and Nottingham.

===British Railways===
When sectorisation was introduced in the 1980s, the station was served by the InterCity sector until the privatisation of British Railways.

With the advent of power signalling in 1986, the signal box and the crossovers disappeared, and the tracks approaching the station were relaid to allow trains from any direction to enter or leave any platform.

===Privatisation===
Upon the privatisation of British Rail, the station became owned by Railtrack and later Network Rail; however, in common with most British railway stations, the day-to-day operation was contracted out to the largest user of the station, in this case Midland Mainline. Midland Mainline continued to refurbish the station with the installation of a large electronic departure board in the station entrance hall and smaller boards on all platforms.

In 2006, work was started on the installation of automatic ticket gates to cut down on fare evasion. Leicester City Council issued plans for the redevelopment of the station and the surrounding area including a total of eight platforms.

Re-surfacing of the platforms took place throughout 2010.

==Station amenities==

The main entrance to the station is on London Road. The ticket office and travel centre are located in the concourse; the lost property office and lockers were formerly located here also although East Midlands Trains took these facilities away in 2009 citing cost and the recession. This concourse gives access to the main station overbridge to all platforms, and via a corridor to the lifts. There is a footbridge at the northern end of the station giving access to the long-stay car park and Campbell Street.

The station is based on two island platforms which are wide with a long series of buildings. There is a newsagent and several food outlets including a café and licensed bar. There are also toilets and a large waiting room.

Midland Mainline erected a first class lounge at the southern end of the up island platforms during 2000. Passenger information systems were updated at the same time and now use dot matrix display screens. Leicester has automated announcements, which replaced the previous manual public address system in September 2011. In 2006, automatic ticket barriers were installed on all approaches to the station.

The station has an office for the British Transport Police and Cash point in the porte-cochere as well as a taxi rank and short-stay drop-off and pick-up area.

==Services==

Routes run north–south through Leicester on the Midland Main Line, south to Kettering, Bedford, Luton and London; and north to Derby, Nottingham, Lincoln and Sheffield. Junctions north and south of the station serve the east-west cross country route, going east to Peterborough, Cambridge and Stansted Airport; and west to Nuneaton and .

Leicester station is owned by Network Rail and operated under a franchise by East Midlands Railway. Most services are provided by East Midlands Railway, with CrossCountry operating on the Birmingham to Stansted Airport corridor. Due to a 15 mph maximum speed to the south of the station, as well as the size and importance of the city, all passenger trains stop at the station. Up until the winter 2008 timetable, the morning southbound &quot;The Master Cutler&quot; express from Leeds to London St Pancras was an exception although it eventually called here prior to the service ending.

Leicester is a bottleneck station as it has only four platforms. All platforms are well utilised, especially platforms two and three which receive freight as well as passenger trains. A freight loop goes to the east of the station alongside the carriage sidings which run adjacent to platform four.

Leicester is a penalty fare station, a valid ticket or permit to travel must be shown when requested. The station offers the Plusbus scheme which allows bus and train tickets to be bought together at a saving.
Leicester has had direct services in the past to destinations as varied as Liverpool Lime Street, Manchester Piccadilly, Leeds, York, Scarborough, Norwich, Coventry and Abersytwyth. However, changes to the rail franchises and the unprofitability of some routes have led to many curtailments over the years.

Monday to Friday off-peak service patterns as of June 2024 in trains per hour (tph) and trains per day (tpd):

East Midlands Railway:

* 4 tph to London St Pancras International (2 fast, 2 semi-fast via Kettering)
* 2 tph to Nottingham (1 fast, 1 semi-fast via Beeston)
* 2 tph to Sheffield (1 fast, 1 semi-fast) via Derby and Chesterfield
* 1 tph to Lincoln Central (stopping) via Syston, Nottingham and Newark Castle, of which 1 tp2h is extended to Grimsby Town via Market Rasen, of which 2 tpd are extended to Cleethorpes

CrossCountry:

* 2 tph to Birmingham New Street (1 semi-fast, 1 stopping) via Nuneaton
* 1 tph to Stansted Airport via Peterborough and Cambridge





==Future==
===Regeneration of the station===
&quot;Prospect Leicestershire&quot; led plans which aimed to regenerate the city centre area of Leicester, the station was to be incorporated into a new business quarter. Plans for the station included to rotate the passengers facilities so that they exited into a new open city plaza rather than the current busy ring road. Renewed plans were released in 2008 for the £150 million redevelopment, promising over 2,800 new jobs in the area due to the new shops and offices which would be created. However, the 2008–2012 global recession also saw these plans fail to materialise. Network Rail and East Midlands Trains started work on a £3.5 million scheme in 2012. Platforms have been resurfaced, toilets and both first and standard class waiting areas refurbished. The majority of work has taken place in the concourse and porte corche area where a new travel centre is being provided.

Network Rail adopted a Route Utilisation Strategy for freight in 2007 which will create a new cross country freight route from Peterborough (East Coast Main Line) to Nuneaton (West Coast Main Line). One of the next stages (around 2013) will create additional lines through Leicester during a re-signalling scheme. During this period additional platforms may be provided at Leicester.

===Electrification===

As of 2022 the railway through Leicester is not electrified. Plans to carry out full electrification of the Midland Mainline were paused on 20 July 2017, after being previously announced, commenced, suspended and resumed. From 2024, services will be operated using bi-mode electro-diesel trains running in electro-pantograph mode between London St Pancras and Wigston, just 4 miles (6,5 km) south of Leicester railway station switching to electro-accumulator/diesel-electric mode northwards from there.

In the decade starting 2020 various events changed the prospects for the station even though improvements had been on and off the political agenda for over a decade. Various news outlets reported in December 2020 that prospects for electrification to Market Harborough were improving. On 23 March 2021, the Transport Select Committee published its sixth report in the Trains fit for the Future enquiry, which called for a rolling programme of electrification. It stated the Midland Main Line project would be divided into eight sections. Modern Railways confirmed that the project would continue north of Market Harborough all the way to Leicester and Sheffield.

Another major development was the publishing of the Integrated Rail Plan (IRP) on 18 November 2021. This included full Midland Main Line electrification and upgrades. F2N is still being upgraded in stages.

===Ivanhoe Line===
After phase one of the Ivanhoe Line was completed in the mid-1990s, it was originally planned that phase two would extend the line west to Burton upon Trent on the current freight-only line via Coalville and Ashby-de-la-Zouch. The possibility was studied in 2008 and again in 2016 but in both cases the conclusion was that the cost was not justified by the benefits.

The most recent study, in 2016, costed the work at up to £175 million and claimed that an additional 206,000 houses would need to be built along the route to generate enough passengers to make the line profitable.

<doc id="353844" wikidata="Q2034424" url="?curid=353844" title="New Zealand House of Representatives">
<text>The House of Representatives () is the sole chamber of the New Zealand Parliament. The House passes laws, provides ministers to form the Cabinet, and supervises the work of government. It is also responsible for adopting the state&#x27;s budgets and approving the state&#x27;s accounts.

The House of Representatives is a democratic body consisting of representatives known as members of parliament (MPs). There are normally 120 MPs, though there are currently 123 due to an overhang. Elections take place usually every three years using a mixed-member proportional representation system, which combines first-past-the-post elected seats with closed party lists. 72 MPs are elected directly in single-member electoral districts and further seats are filled by list MPs based on each party&#x27;s share of the party vote. A government may be formed from the single party or coalition of parties that has the support of a majority of MPs. If no majority is possible, a minority government can be formed with a confidence and supply arrangement. If a government is unable to maintain the confidence of the House then an early general election can be called.

The House of Representatives was created by the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852 (effective 1853), an act of the British Parliament, which established a bicameral legislature; however the upper chamber, the Legislative Council, was abolished in 1950. Parliament received full control over all New Zealand affairs in 1947 with the passage of the Statute of Westminster Adoption Act. The debating chamber of the House of Representatives is located inside Parliament House in Wellington, the capital city. Sittings of the House are usually open to the public, but the House may at any time vote to sit in private. Proceedings are broadcast through Parliament TV and the AM Network.

==Constitutional function==

The New Zealand House of Representatives takes the British House of Commons as its model. The New Zealand Parliament is based, in practice, on the Westminster system (that is, the procedures of the British Parliament). As a democratic institution, the primary role of the House of Representatives is to provide representation for the people and to pass legislation on behalf of the people (&quot;see § Passage of legislation&quot;).

The House of Representatives also plays an important role in responsible government. The New Zealand Government (that is, the executive), directed by the Cabinet, draws its membership exclusively from the House. A government is formed when a party or coalition can show that it has the &quot;confidence&quot; of the House, meaning the support of a majority of members of parliament. This can involve making agreements among several parties. Some may join a coalition government, while others may stay outside the government but agree to support it on confidence votes. The prime minister (leader of the government) is answerable to, and must maintain the support of, the House of Representatives; thus, whenever the office of prime minister falls vacant, the governor-general appoints the person who is most likely to command the support of the House. If the House of Representatives loses confidence in the Cabinet, and therefore in the government, then it can dissolve the government if a vote of no-confidence is passed.

==Members and elections==

The House of Representatives normally consists of 120 members, who bear the title &quot;Member of Parliament&quot; (MP). They were previously known as &quot;Members of the House of Representatives&quot; (MHRs) until the passing of the Parliamentary and Executive Titles Act 1907 when New Zealand became a Dominion, and even earlier as &quot;Members of the General Assembly&quot; (MGAs).

All MPs are democratically elected, and usually enter the House following a general election. Once sworn in, MPs normally continue to serve until the next dissolution of parliament and subsequent general election, which must take place at least every three years. Early general elections (sometimes termed &quot;snap elections&quot;) are possible at the discretion of the prime minister, especially if a minority government is unable to retain the confidence of the House. Members who change their party allegiance during a term—known as &quot;waka-jumping&quot;—may be expelled from the House. Members may also be expelled in cases of criminal activity or other serious misconduct. Some expulsions have been challenged through the courts. Casual vacancies in electorates are filled through by-elections; if a list member&#x27;s seat becomes vacant then the next available person on their party&#x27;s list is appointed to the position. List MPs are free to stand in electorate by-elections and in the case of successful contest their own seat will be filled &#x27;in turn&#x27;.

To be an MP a person must be a New Zealand citizen (by birth or naturalisation) at the time of the election and not be disqualified from enrolling to vote; unlike certain other countries, bankruptcy is not grounds for disqualification from office. Party list candidates are always nominated by political parties.

The annual salary of each MP has been $168,600 since October 2023, previously being $163,961 and members may receive additional salaries in right of other offices they hold (for instance, the speaker, whips, and chairpersons of select committees) as recognised by Remuneration Authority determinations. MPs&#x27; pay is rather more than double average weekly earnings, which in 2023 were $1,558 ($81,239 pa). In 1930 it was said, &quot;politics represent sacrifice to the best anti-Labour candidates&quot;, at a time when MPs were paid £550 also a bit more than double the average male wage of £4 12s a week (£240 pa).

===Current composition===
The 54th New Zealand Parliament is the current sitting of the House. The most recent general election was held on 14 October 2023, and the 54th Parliament first sat on 5 December. It consists of 123 members, representing six parliamentary parties. Of these current MPs, 54 () are women—the second-highest number since women were first allowed to stand for Parliament in , after the high of 61 () achieved during the term of the 53rd parliament.

Based on British tradition, the longest continuously serving member in the House holds the unofficial title &quot;father [or mother] of the House&quot;. The current Father of the House is Gerry Brownlee, the current speaker, who has served continuously since . He inherited the title following the departure of former speaker Trevor Mallard, who had served in the House since .

===Number of members===
The House started with 37 members in 1854, with numbers progressively increasing to 95 by 1882, before being reduced to 74 in 1891. Numbers slowly increased again to 99 by 1993. In 1996 numbers increased to at least 120 with the introduction of MMP elections (i.e. 120 plus any overhang seats; there has been at least one overhang seat in five of the 10 MMP elections held since 1996). The year in which each change in the number of members took effect is shown in the following table.

===Electoral system===
Voting is not compulsory, but voter turnout is high compared to other democratic countries. Universal suffrage exists for those 18 or older; New Zealand citizens and others who are permanently residing in New Zealand are usually eligible to vote. New Zealand was the first self-governing nation to enfranchise women, starting from the . There are a few disqualifications; for example, mentally-impaired persons detained in hospital and prisoners sentenced to a term of over three years are ineligible to vote.

Parliamentary elections are conducted by secret ballot—for European New Zealanders since and Māori seats since . Almost all general elections between and were held under the first-past-the-post voting system, with the exception of the 1908 and 1911 elections, which used a two-round system. Since , a form of proportional representation called mixed-member proportional (MMP) has been used. Under the MMP system each person has two votes; one is for electorate seats (including some reserved for Māori), and the other is for a party. there are 72 electorate seats (which includes seven Māori electorates), and the remaining 48 seats are apportioned (from party lists) so that representation in parliament reflects the party vote, although a party has to win one electorate or 5 percent of the total party vote before it is eligible for these seats. After the introduction of proportional representation, no single party won an outright majority until the 2020 election when Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern led the Labour Party to win 65 of the 120 seats.

==Officials and officers==
The House of Representatives elects one of its members as a presiding officer, known as the speaker of the House, at the beginning of each new parliamentary term, and also whenever a vacancy arises. It is the speaker&#x27;s role to apply the rules of the House (called the Standing Orders), and oversee procedures and the day-to-day operation of the chamber. The speaker responds to points of order from other members of the House. When presiding, the speaker is obliged to remain impartial. Additionally, since 1992, the House elects a deputy speaker from amongst its members; the deputy may preside when the speaker is absent. Up to two assistants are also appointed from amongst the members of the House.
Several political party-based roles are filled by elected MPs. The prime minister is the leader of the largest government party and leads the government&#x27;s contribution to major debates in the House. The leader of the Official Opposition is the MP who leads the largest opposition party. The leader of the House is an MP appointed by the prime minister to arrange government business and the legislative programme of Parliament. Whips (called musterers by the Green Party) are organisers and administrators of the MPs in each of the political parties in the House. The whips make sure that members of their caucus are in the House during crucial votes. 

Officers of the House who are not MPs include the clerk of the House, the deputy clerk, the chief parliamentary counsel (a lawyer who helps to draft bills), and several other junior clerks. These are non-partisan roles. The most senior of these officers is the clerk of the House, who is responsible for several key administrative tasks, such as &quot;advising members on the rules, practices and customs of the House&quot;.

Another important officer is the serjeant-at-arms, whose duties include the maintenance of order and security in the precincts of the House. The serjeant-at-arms sits in the debating chamber opposite the speaker at the visitors door for each House sitting session. The serjeant-at-arms is also the custodian of the mace, and bears the mace into and out of the chamber of the House at the beginning and end of each sitting day.

==Procedure==

The House of Representatives usually sits Tuesday to Thursday when in session. The House meets in the debating chamber located inside Parliament House, Wellington. The layout is similar to the design of the chamber of the British House of Commons.
The seats and desks are arranged in rows in a horseshoe pattern.
The speaker of the House sits in a raised chair at the open end of the horseshoe, giving them a clear view of proceedings. In front of the chair is a table, on which rests a mace. MPs cannot lawfully meet without the mace, a formal symbol of the authority of the House, being present in the chamber. (The current mace has been used since 7 October 1909, and is a replica of the one in the British House of Commons.)
Various officers—clerks and other officials—sit at the table, ready to advise the speaker on procedure when necessary. Members of the Government occupy the seats on the speaker&#x27;s right, while members of the Official Opposition sit on the speaker&#x27;s left. Members are assigned seating on the basis of the seniority in a party caucus; ministers sit around the prime minister, who is traditionally assigned the fourth seat along the front row on the speaker&#x27;s right. The Opposition leader sits directly across from the prime minister and is surrounded by Opposition spokespersons. A member who is not a minister or spokesperson is referred to as a &quot;backbencher&quot;. A backbencher may still be subject to party discipline (called &quot;whipping&quot;). Whips ensure that members of their party attend and vote as the party leadership desires. Government whips are seated behind the prime minister; Opposition whips are normally seated behind the leader of the Opposition. Members from parties that are not openly aligned with either the Government or the Official Opposition are sometimes referred to as &quot;crossbenchers&quot;.

===Debates and votes===
Members have the option of addressing the House in English, Te Reo Māori, or New Zealand Sign Language (with an interpreter provided). Speeches are addressed to the presiding officer, using the words &#x27;Mister Speaker&#x27;, if a man, or &#x27;Madam Speaker&#x27;, if a woman. Only the speaker may be directly addressed in debate; other members must be referred to in the third person, either by full name or office. The speaker can &quot;name&quot; a member believed to have broken the rules of conduct of the House; following a vote this will usually result in the expulsion of said member from the chamber.

During debates, members may only speak if called upon by the speaker. No member may speak more than once on the same question (except that the mover of a motion is entitled to make one speech at the beginning of the debate and another at the end). The Standing Orders of the House of Representatives prescribe time limits for speeches. The limits depend on the nature of the motion, but are most commonly between ten and twenty minutes. However, under certain circumstances, the prime minister and other party leaders are entitled to make longer speeches. Debate may be further restricted by the passage of &quot;time allocation&quot; motions. Alternatively, the House may end debate more quickly by passing a motion for &quot;closure&quot;.

A vote is held to resolve a question when it is put to the House of Representatives. The House first votes by voice vote; the speaker or deputy speaker puts the question, and MPs respond either &quot;Aye&quot; (in favour of the motion) or &quot;No&quot; (against the motion). The presiding officer then announces the result of the voice vote, but if his assessment is challenged by any member, a recorded vote known as a division follows. There are two methods of handling a division: &quot;party vote&quot; is used for most votes, but &quot;personal vote&quot; is used for conscience issues. In the party vote method, the clerk of the House reads out each party&#x27;s name in turn. A member of the party (usually a whip) will respond to their party&#x27;s name by stating how many members of the party are in favour and how many members are opposed. The clerk tallies up the votes and gives the results to the speaker, who announces the result. If the members of a party are not unanimous, a list of the members of the party and how they voted must be tabled after the vote. In the personal vote method, MPs enter one of two lobbies (the &quot;Aye&quot; lobby or the &quot;No&quot; lobby) on either side of the chamber. At each lobby are two tellers (themselves MPs) who count the votes of the MPs. Once the division concludes, the tellers provide the results to the speaker, who then announces the result. In case of a tie, the motion lapses.
Every sitting day a period of time is set aside for questions to be asked of ministers and select committee chairs. Questions to a minister must related to their official ministerial activities, not about activities as a party leader. There are 12 questions, which are distributed proportionately among the parties. In addition to questions asked orally during question time, members may also make inquiries in writing. Written questions are submitted to the clerk, either on paper or electronically, and answers are recorded in &quot;Parliamentary Debates&quot; (Hansard).

==Passage of legislation==
Most parliamentary business is about making new laws and amending old laws. The House examines and amends bills—the title given to a proposed piece of legislation while under consideration by the House—in several formal stages. The term for these stages is &quot;reading&quot;, which originates from the practice in the British Parliament where bills were literally read aloud in the chamber. In New Zealand only a bill&#x27;s title is read aloud. Once a bill has passed through all its parliamentary stages it is enacted and becomes an act of Parliament, forming part of New Zealand&#x27;s law.

Bills become acts after being approved three times by House votes and then receiving the Royal Assent from the governor-general. The majority of bills are proposed by the government of the day (that is, the party or coalition parties that command a majority in the House) to implement its policies. These policies may relate to the raising of revenue through taxation bills or the expenditure of money through appropriation bills (including those bills giving effect to the budget). It is rare for government bills to be defeated—indeed the first to be defeated in the twentieth century was in 1998, when the Local Government Amendment Bill (No 5) was defeated on its second reading.

Individual MPs who are not ministers may propose their own bills, called members&#x27; bills—these are usually put forward by opposition parties, or by MPs who wish to deal with a matter that parties do not take positions on. At any time, there are eight members bills awaiting their first reading, and when space becomes available, new member&#x27;s bills are selected by ballot to be introduced. The ballet is conducted by drawing numbered counters out of a biscuit tin, giving the whole member&#x27;s bill process the nickname &quot;democracy by biscuit tin&quot;. Local government and private individuals may also propose legislation to be introduced by an MP.

Proxy voting is allowed, in which members may designate a party or another member to vote on their behalf. An excuse is required.

===First reading===
The first stage of the process is the first reading. The member introducing the bill (often a minister) will give a detailed speech on the bill as a whole. Debate on the bill last about two hours for government bills and one hour for other members&#x27; bills, with 12 MPs making ten-minute speeches on the bill&#x27;s general principles. Speaking slots are allocated based on the size of each party, with different parties using different methods to distribute their slots among their members.

The member introducing the bill will generally make a recommendation that the bill be considered by an appropriate select committee (&quot;see &quot;). Sometimes, it will be recommended that a special committee be formed, usually when the bill is particularly important or controversial. The House then votes as to whether the bill should be sent to the committee for deliberation. It is not uncommon for a bill to be voted to the select committee stage even by parties which do not support it—since select committees can recommend amendments to bills, parties will often not make a final decision on whether to back a bill until the second reading.

Prior to the first reading, the attorney-general will check the bill is consistent with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. If the bill or part of it is not consistent, the attorney-general will present a report to the House, known as a Section 7 report, highlighting the inconsistencies.

===Select committee stage===
The select committee will scrutinise the bill, going over it in more detail than can be achieved by the whole membership of the House. The public can also make submissions to select committees, offering support, criticism, or merely comments. Written submissions from the public to the committee are normally due two months after the bill&#x27;s first reading. Submitters can opt to also give an oral submission, which are heard by the committee in Wellington, and numbers permitting, Auckland and Christchurch. The select committee stage is seen as increasingly important today—in the past, the governing party generally dominated select committees, making the process something of a rubber stamp, but in the multi-party environment there is significant scope for real debate. Select committees frequently recommend changes to bills, with prompts for change coming from the MPs sitting in the committee, officials who advise the committee, and members of the public. When a majority of the committee is satisfied with the bill, the committee will report back to the House on it. Unless Parliament grants an extension, the time limit for select committee deliberations is six months or whatever deadline was set by the House when the bill was referred.

===Second reading===
The second reading, like the first, generally consists of a two-hour debate in which MPs make ten-minute speeches. Again, speaking slots are allocated to parties based on their size. In theory, speeches should relate to the principles and objects of the bill, and also to the consideration and recommendations of the select committee and issues raised in public submissions. Parties will usually have made their final decision on a bill after the select committee stage, and will make their views clear during the second reading debates. At the conclusion of debate, the House votes on whether to accept any amendments recommended by the select committee by majority (unanimous amendments are not subjected to this extra hurdle).

The Government (usually through the minister of finance) has the power (given by the House&#x27;s Standing Orders) to veto any proposed legislation that would have a major impact on the Government&#x27;s budget and expenditure plans. This veto can be invoked at any stage of the process, but if applied to a bill as a whole will most likely be employed at the second-reading stage. Since the financial veto certificate was introduced in 1996, the Government has exercised it only once in respect of an entire bill, in 2016, although many amendments have been vetoed at the committee of the whole House stage.

If a bill receives its second reading, it goes on to be considered by a committee of the whole House.

===Committee of the whole House===
When a bill reaches the committee of the whole House stage, the House resolves itself &quot;into committee&quot;, that is, it forms a committee consisting of all MPs (as distinct from a select committee, which consists only of a few members). When the House is &quot;in committee&quot;, it is able to operate in a slightly less formal way than usual.

During a committee of the whole House, a bill is debated in detail, usually &quot;part by part&quot; (a &quot;part&quot; is a grouping of clauses). MPs may make five-minute speeches on a particular part or provision of the bill and may propose further amendments, but theoretically should not make general speeches on the bill&#x27;s overall goals or principles (that should have occurred at the second reading).

Sometimes a member may advertise the proposed amendments beforehand by having them printed on an Amendment Paper (known as Supplementary Order Papers prior to the 54th Parliament); this is common for amendments proposed by government ministers. Some Amendment Papers are very extensive, and, if agreed to, can result in major amendments to bills. On rare occasions, Amendment Papers are referred to select committees for comment.

The extent to which a bill changes during this process varies. If the select committee that considered the bill did not have a government majority and made significant alterations, the Government may make significant &quot;corrective&quot; amendments. There is some criticism that bills may be amended to incorporate significant policy changes without the benefit of select committee scrutiny or public submissions, or even that such major changes can be made with little or no notice. However, under the MMP system when the Government is less likely to have an absolute majority, any amendments will usually need to be negotiated with other parties to obtain majority support.

The Opposition may also put forward wrecking amendments. These amendments are often just symbolic of their contrasting policy position, or simply intended to delay the passage of the bill through the sheer quantity of amendments for the committee of the whole House to vote on.

===Third reading===
The final reading takes the same format as the first and second readings—a two-hour debate with MPs making ten-minute speeches. The speeches once again refer to the bill in general terms, and represent the final chance for debate. A final vote is taken. If a bill passes its third reading, it is passed on to the governor-general, who will (assuming constitutional conventions are followed) give it Royal Assent as a matter of law. The title is changed from a bill to an act, and it becomes law.

==Committees==

In addition to the work of the main chamber, the House of Representatives also has a large number of committees, established in order to deal with particular areas or issues. There are 12 subject select committees, which scrutinise and amend bills. They can call for submissions from the public, thereby meaning that there is a degree of public consultation before a parliamentary bill proceeds into law. The strengthening of the committee system was in response to concerns that legislation was being forced through, without receiving due examination and revision.

Each committee has between six and twelve members—including a chairperson and deputy chairperson—with parties broadly represented in proportion to party membership in the House. MPs may be members of more than one committee. Membership of committees is determined by the Business Specialist Committee, which is chaired by the speaker.

Occasionally a special committee will be created on a temporary basis; an example was the Select Committee established to study the foreshore and seabed bill.

==New Zealand Youth Parliament==

Once in every term of Parliament a New Zealand Youth Parliament is held. This major national event is open to 16- to 18-year-olds who are appointed by individual MPs to represent them in their role for a few days in Wellington. The Youth MPs spend time debating a mock bill in the House and in select committees, and asking questions of Cabinet ministers. The previous New Zealand Youth Parliament was held in July 2022.
