<text>The yellow-bellied sapsucker (Sphyrapicus varius) is a medium-sized woodpecker that breeds in Canada and the northeastern United States.

==Taxonomy==
The yellow-bellied sapsucker was described and illustrated using a hand-coloured plate by the English naturalist Mark Catesby in his &quot;The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands&quot; which was published between 1729 and 1732. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the twelfth edition, he included the yellow-bellied sapsucker, coined the binomial name &quot;Picus varius&quot; and cited Catesby&#x27;s book. The specific epithet &quot;varius&quot; is the Latin word meaning &quot;various&quot;, &quot;diverse&quot; or &quot;variegated&quot;. Linnaeus specified the type locality as &quot;America septentrionalis&quot; (North America) but the locality is now restricted to South Carolina. The yellow-bellied sapsucker is now placed in the genus &quot;Sphyrapicus&quot; that was erected in 1858 by the American naturalist Spencer Baird with the yellow-bellied sapsucker as the type species. Within the genus &quot;Sphyrapicus&quot;, the yellow-bellied sapsucker is sister to a clade containing the red-breasted sapsucker (&quot;Sphyrapicus ruber &quot;) and the red-naped sapsucker (&quot;Sphyrapicus nuchalis&quot;). The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.
==Description==
The yellow-bellied sapsucker has a length of around , and an average weight of , although this can range anywhere from . The yellow-bellied sapsucker has a wingspan that ranges from . The forehead is coloured bright red in the male (and very occasionally yellow), and a lighter shade of red in the female. Sometimes, this is the only place on the head a female will have red colouration, if it has any at all, as the female rarely has a black head with a few buff spots. The crown is bordered black, and is usually red, and is sometimes mixed with black in the female. There is a white stripe, starting above the eye, that extends and widens to the nape, being broken up by a thin black line on the hindneck. There is a broad black stripe going through the ear-coverts and down to the side of the neck. Below this black stripe is a white stripe that goes from the nasal tufts to the side of the breast. The throat and chin can be used to differentiated between the sexes, as they are white in the female, and red in the male.

The mantle of this sapsucker is white, and there are irregular black bars that extend from it to the rump. The lower rump is white, and the uppertail-coverts are white with some black webbing. The wing coverts are black, and there is a white panel on the medians and central greater-wing coverts. The flight feathers are black with white tips. The innermost tertials are white and black. The underwing is barred greyish and white. The uppertail is black, with some white webbing and white tips sometimes being present on the outer feathers. The underparts, excluding the pale breast and above, are tinged yellow, transitioning to a whiter colour in the lower region of them. The side of the breast down to the undertail coverts have black arrowhead-shaped markings.

The chisel-tipped bill is relatively short and straight, with a slate to blackish colour. The legs are blue-grey to green-grey in colour, and the irides are a deep brown. The juvenile is a dark olive-brown colour overall, with a buff-striped head and a streaked crown. The throat is usually white, although in the male, there may be some red. The upperparts are generally a mottled pale and blackish colour. The breast is scaly, and the central part of the belly is a very pale yellow colour. The tail is barred more than in the adult.

===Vocalizations and communication===

The yellow-bellied sapsucker, usually the male, utilizes a long distance nasal &quot;neaaah&quot;, &quot;owee-owee&quot;, &quot;wee-wee-wee-wee&quot;, or &quot;kwee-urk&quot; at the start of breeding to attract its mate to various places within its territory. When birds of a family group meet, they exchange low &quot;week week&quot;, &quot;wurp wurp&quot;, or similar low calls. A scratchy &quot;quirk quirk&quot; is given when pairs meet at the breeding territory. When it is alarmed, this bird will utter a soft mew call, getting louder and hoarser as the threat increases. During a conflict, it produces a shrill &quot;quarr&quot;.

This sapsucker drums on materials that reverberate loudly, with drums starting as rapid bursts but becoming more drawn out as time goes on. The bursts usually last between one and a half and five seconds. These drums were previously thought to be used to indicate quality of a nesting or feeding site, but it is likely that they are used as a form of long-distance communication. Trees chosen to drum on are dead, and thus are not those used for feeding or nesting.

===Similar species===
The red-naped sapsucker is distinguished by having a red nape (back of the head). The hairy woodpecker has no red on the crown (front of the head) or throat and has blacker back. The downy woodpecker has same markings as the hairy woodpecker but is significantly smaller.

==Distribution and habitat==
The yellow-bellied sapsucker is found across Canada, eastern Alaska and the northeastern United States. These birds winter in the eastern United States, West Indies and Central America. This species has occurred as a very rare vagrant to Ireland and Great Britain.

When this sapsucker is breeding, it is generally found in deciduous and mixed coniferous forests up to altitude. During the non-breeding season, on the other hand, it usually inhabits forests, but the edge of the forest, open woodland, and semi-open habitats are sometimes utilized. It is also seen at larger trees in pastures, clearings, and suburban areas, in addition to the occasional appearance in palm groves. During this time, the yellow-bellied sapsucker ranges from sea level to elevations of , and even in some areas, although the bird normally stays between altitudes of .

==Behavior and ecology==

===Feeding===
The yellow-bellied sapsucker usually forages by itself, although it sometimes joins small groups in the winter, and occasionally mixes into flocks of insectivores in the winter.

Arthropods, tree sap, fruits, and nuts compose the majority of the yellow-bellied sapsucker&#x27;s diet. It also takes bast and cambium from trees. Berries are occasionally eaten, and in the Northern Hemisphere spring, buds are eaten. Arthropod prey is usually in the form of Lepidoptera, Odonata, or both the young and adults of beetles and ants. During the nesting season, insects comprise about half the diet of the adults. During the late Northern Hemisphere summer and throughout the same hemisphere&#x27;s autumn, sap is the primary food of choice. Cambium is taken throughout the year, although it is primarily eaten during the Northern Hemisphere winter and spring. Fruit is mainly eaten during October to February.

The chicks are fed by both sexes. The primary food is insects which are occasionally coated in tree sap before eaten by the chick. The size of these insects varies by the age of the chicks, with younger chicks being fed smaller insects. The chicks beg for food through vocalizations that can be heard away or more, likely stimulating the adults to catch more food. These vocalizations are usually done by the hungriest chick, with the other joining in only when the parent is at the nest. Because of this, the hungriest chick gets fed first. When the chick leaves the nest, it relies on both insects from its parents and sap from the holes they drill.

In the breeding season, this sapsucker prefers to take sap from the trees &quot;Betula papyrifera&quot;, &quot;Acer rubrum&quot;, &quot;Amelanchier&quot;, and &quot;Populus grandidentata&quot;. Other trees of the genera &quot;Populus&quot;, &quot;Betula&quot;, and &quot;Acer&quot; are also used, in addition to deciduous trees of the genera &quot;Salix&quot;, &quot;Carya&quot;, &quot;Alnus&quot; and coniferous trees of the genera &quot;Pinus&quot;, &quot;Picea&quot;, and &quot;Abies&quot;. In the Northern Hemisphere winter and spring, it usually feeds on conifers, while in its autumn, feeding on rough-barked trees is most common.

Before feeding consistently on a tree, this sapsucker lays down exploratory bands near a live branch. These bands are laid down in horizontal rows. When it finds a tree that is photosynthesizing, then it lays down more holes to feed, about above the primary bands. These form columns. Each hole is started as an oval elongated horizontally, drilled through the bark and phloem layers to the outside of the xylem. They are then drilled further, with the sapsucker enlarging it vertically, making it yield more sap, but only for a few days. The top holes in each column thus provides phloem sap, and this sapsucker also utilizes the bast from the edges of the holes drilled. In the winter, when the holes are drilled on conifers, bast is likely the most important food.

===Breeding===
Yellow-bellied sapsuckers nest in a large cavity excavated in a live deciduous tree, often choosing one that has rotten heartwood; a suitable tree may be reused. It especially prefers &quot;Populus tremuloides&quot; trees that have conks of &quot;Fomes fomentarius&quot; var. &quot;populinus&quot;. Other trees in the genus &quot;Populus&quot; and those in the genus &quot;Betula&quot; are popular choices. A study in northern Canada found that the yellow-bellied sapsucker nested in trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) ranging anywhere from , with an average DBH of about for nestling trees, compared to the average DBH in the area of about . A study in the northeastern United States, however, concluded that this sapsucker has a search image for trees with the ideal attributes; one of these attributes was having a DBH of . The study also concluded that a deviance from this search image can be caused by the rarity of the trees that fulfill such criteria.

This bird is monogamous, and nests in pairs, with both sexes working to make the nest. Excavation of the cavity is done mostly by the male, with excavation usually being done continuously for 15 to 30 minutes at a time. Excavation takes about 15 to 28 days, although further hollowing out is done by both sexes after the chicks hatch. The cavity itself is anywhere from above ground, although it is usually found between heights of . This sapsucker is also territorial, with territories having a radius ranging from about away from the nest. Territories in less wooded areas are often larger than those in areas heavily wooded.

The male usually arrives on the nesting grounds about one week before the female. The sapsucker arrives early in the Northern Hemisphere spring, often before heavy snowfall has stopped. The actual breeding season is from April to July.

During nest excavation, a bird may perform a courtship flight. This flight consists of the sapsucker rapidly flapping its wings below its partner. It seems to build the pair bond and help increase attachment to the nest. Members of a pair also perform a dance where they bob their heads and repeatedly opening their wings halfway. They also have the courtship ritual of touching their bills together. Courtship additionally consists of giving &quot;quirk&quot; notes and, from a distance, &quot;kwee-urk&quot; calls. Copulation can consist of the female perching perpendicularly on a branch, the male mounting her back, gradually falling backwards and to the left, until he is upside down and at a right angle to the female.

This bird lays a clutch of four to seven eggs, with clutches being larger for birds in the northern part of the range. The eggs themselves are white and spotless, measuring around . During egg laying, the female is dominant, sometimes driving the male away from the nest. Both sexes incubate the eggs during the 10 to 13 day incubation period, with the male usually doing so over the night. Sapsuckers are restless but quiet during this time, and the eggs are left uncovered about 16% of the time during the incubation period. Weather usually does not affect incubation, although on particularly hot days, the parents incubate the eggs for less time. When the chicks hatch, they are brooded for 8 to 10 days by both sexes. Nests with fewer young are brooded more, presumably because smaller broods lose heat faster. After 25 to 29 days, the young leave the nest for this first time, and become independent after about two weeks.

==Predators and parasites==
The yellow-bellied sapsucker is parasitized by &quot;Haemoproteus velans&quot;, a sporozoan parasite that is transmitted to this bird through biting midges of the genus &quot;Culicoides&quot;. It is also host to &quot;Philopterus californiens&quot;, a philopterid louse.

Adults and nestlings can be killed by raccoons, especially if the nest is either too low or not deep enough. Sapsuckers are also especially susceptible to raccoon attacks when nesting in trees other than &quot;P. tremuloides&quot; infected by &quot;F. fomentarius&quot;. This is theorized to contribute to the evolution of a search image for ideal nesting trees. Other nest predators include snakes.

==Relationship with humans==
===Damage to trees===
Because the feeding habits of the yellow-bellied sapsucker can injure trees and attract insects, it is sometimes considered a pest. The birds can cause serious damage to trees, and intensive feeding has been documented as a source of tree mortality. Sapsucker feeding can kill a tree by girdling, which occurs when a ring of bark around the trunk is severely injured. Ring shake—spaces between rings of growth in trees—can be a result of sapsucker injury. Certain tree species are particularly susceptible to dying after being damaged by yellow-bellied sapsuckers. For example, a USDA forest study that examined trees injured by yellow-bellied sapsuckers noted a mortality of 67% for &quot;Betula populifolia&quot;, 51% for &quot;B. papyrifera&quot;, and 40% for &quot;Acer rubrum&quot;. In other tree species, injuries inflicted by yellow-bellied sapsuckers can result in significantly less mortality. The USDA study noted that only 3% of &quot;Picea rubens&quot; and 1% of &quot;Tsuga canadensis&quot; that were injured by sapsuckers succumbed to their wounds.

==Status and conservation==
The yellow-bellied sapsucker is considered to be least concern by the IUCN, even though it has a decreasing population. This is because of its large range of about . In addition, it has a large population, being common in its range, although it is not easily seen when not breeding. It has low genetic diversity; about half that of most birds.

In the United States, yellow-bellied sapsuckers are listed and protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, making taking, killing, or possessing one illegal without a permit.

<doc id="351899" wikidata="Q820036" url="?curid=351899" title="VHF omnidirectional range">
<text>Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range Station (VOR) is a type of short-range VHF radio navigation system for aircraft, enabling aircraft with a VOR receiver to determine the azimuth (also radial), referenced to magnetic north, between the aircraft to/from fixed VOR ground radio beacons. VOR and the first DME(1950) system (referenced to 1950 since different from today&#x27;s DME/N) to provide the slant range distance, were developed in the United States as part of a U.S. civil/military program for Aeronautical Navigation Aids in 1945. Deployment of VOR and DME(1950) began in 1949 by the U.S. CAA (Civil Aeronautics Administration). ICAO standardized VOR and DME(1950) in 1950 in ICAO Annex ed.1. Frequencies for the use of VOR are standardized in the very high frequency (VHF) band between 108.00 and 117.95 MHz Chapter 3, Table A. To improve azimuth accuracy of VOR even under difficult siting conditions, Doppler VOR (DVOR) was developed in the 1960s. VOR is according to ICAO rules a &quot;primary means navigation system&quot; for commercial and general aviation, (D)VOR are gradually decommissioned and replaced by DME-DME RNAV (area navigation) 7.2.3 and satellite based navigation systems such as GPS in the early 21st century. In 2000 there were about 3,000 VOR stations operating around the world, including 1,033 in the US, but by 2013 the number in the US had been reduced to 967. The United States is decommissioning approximately half of its VOR stations and other legacy navigation aids as part of a move to performance-based navigation, while still retaining a &quot;Minimum Operational Network&quot; of VOR stations as a backup to GPS. In 2015, the UK planned to reduce the number of stations from 44 to 19 by 2020.

A VOR beacon radiates via two or more antennas an amplitude modulated signal and a frequency modulated subcarrier. By comparing the fixed 30 Hz reference signal with the rotating azimuth 30 Hz signal the azimuth from an aircraft to a (D)VOR is detected. The phase difference is indicative of the bearing from the (D)VOR station to the receiver relative to magnetic north. This line of position is called the VOR &quot;radial&quot;. While providing the same signal over the air at the VOR receiver antennas. DVOR is based on the Doppler shift to modulate the azimuth dependent 30 Hz signal in space, by continuously switching the signal of about 25 antenna pairs that form a circle around the center 30 Hz reference antenna.

The intersection of radials from two different VOR stations can be used to fix the position of the aircraft, as in earlier radio direction finding (RDF) systems.

VOR stations are short range navigation aids limited to the radio-line-of-sight (RLOS) between transmitter and receiver in an aircraft. Depending on the site elevation of the VOR and altitude of the aircraft Designated Operational Coverages (DOC) of at max. about Att.C, Fig.C-13 can be achieved. The prerequesite is that the EIRP provides in spite of losses, e.g. due to propagation and antenna pattern lobing, for a sufficiently strong signal at the aircraft VOR antenna that it can be processed successfully by the VOR receiver. Each (D)VOR station broadcasts a VHF radio composite signal, including the mentioned navigation and reference signal, and a station&#x27;s identifier and optional additional voice. 3.3.5 The station&#x27;s identifier is typically a three-letter string in Morse code. While defined in Annex 10 voice channel is seldomly used today, e.g. for recorded advisories like ATIS. 3.3.6

A VORTAC is a radio-based navigational aid for aircraft pilots consisting of a co-located VHF omnidirectional range and a tactical air navigation system (TACAN) beacon. Both types of beacons provide pilots azimuth information, but the VOR system is generally used by civil aircraft and the TACAN system by military aircraft. However, the TACAN distance measuring equipment is also used for civil purposes because civil DME equipment is built to match the military DME specifications. Most VOR installations in the United States are VORTACs. The system was designed and developed by the Cardion Corporation. The Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) contract was awarded 28 December 1981.

==Description==

===History===
Developed from earlier Visual Aural Radio Range (VAR) systems. The VOR development was part of a U.S. civil/military program for Aeronautical Navigation Aids. In 1949 VOR for the azimuth/bearing of an aircraft to/from a VOR installation and UHF DME(1950) and the first ICAO Distance Measuring Equipment standard, were put in operation by the U.S. CAA (Civil Aeronautics Administration). In 1950 ICAO standardized VOR and DME(1950) in Annex 10 ed.1.

The VOR was designed to provide 360 courses to and from the station, selectable by the pilot. Early vacuum tube transmitters with mechanically rotated antennas were widely installed in the 1950s, and began to be replaced with fully solid-state units in the early 1960s. DVOR were gradually implemented They became the major radio navigation system in the 1960s, when they took over from the older radio beacon and four-course (low/medium frequency range) system. Some of the older range stations survived, with the four-course directional features removed, as non-directional low or medium frequency radiobeacons (NDBs).

A worldwide land-based network of &quot;air highways&quot;, known in the US as Victor airways (below ) and &quot;jet routes&quot; (at and above 18,000 feet), was set up linking VORs. An aircraft can follow a specific path from station to station by tuning into the successive stations on the VOR receiver, and then either following the desired course on a Radio Magnetic Indicator, or setting it on a course deviation indicator (CDI) or a horizontal situation indicator (HSI, a more sophisticated version of the VOR indicator) and keeping a course pointer centered on the display.

As of 2005, due to advances in technology, many airports are replacing VOR and NDB approaches with RNAV (GNSS) approach procedures; however, receiver and data update costs are still significant enough that many small general aviation aircraft are not equipped with GNSS equipment certified for primary navigation or approaches.

===Features===
VOR signals provide considerably greater accuracy and reliability than NDBs due to a combination of factors. Most significant is that VOR provides a bearing from the station to the aircraft which does not vary with wind or orientation of the aircraft. VHF radio is less vulnerable to diffraction (course bending) around terrain features and coastlines. Phase encoding suffers less interference from thunderstorms.

VOR signals offer a predictable accuracy of , 2 sigma at 2 NM from a pair of VOR beacons; as compared to the accuracy of unaugumented Global Positioning System (GPS) which is less than 13 meters, 95%.

VOR stations, being VHF, operate on &quot;line of sight&quot;. This means that if, on a perfectly clear day, you cannot see the transmitter from the receiver antenna, or vice versa, the signal will be either imperceptible or unusable. This limits VOR (and DME) range to the horizon—or closer if mountains intervene. Although the modern solid state transmitting equipment requires much less maintenance than the older units, an extensive network of stations, needed to provide reasonable coverage along main air routes, is a significant cost in operating current airway systems.

Typically, a VOR station&#x27;s identifier represents a nearby town, city or airport. For example, the VOR station located on the grounds of John F. Kennedy International Airport has the identifier JFK.

===Operation===
VORs are assigned radio channels between 108.0 MHz and 117.95 MHz (with 50 kHz spacing); this is in the &quot;very high frequency&quot; (VHF) range. The first 4 MHz is shared with the instrument landing system (ILS) band. In the United States, frequencies within the pass band of 108.00 to 111.95 MHz which have an even 100 kHz first digit after the decimal point (108.00, 108.05, 108.20, 108.25, and so on) are reserved for VOR frequencies while frequencies within the 108.00 to 111.95 MHz pass band with an odd 100 kHz first digit after the decimal point (108.10, 108.15, 108.30, 108.35, and so on) are reserved for ILS.
The VOR encodes azimuth (direction from the station) as the phase relationship between a reference signal and a variable signal. One of them is amplitude modulated, and one is frequency modulated. On conventional VORs (CVOR), the 30 Hz reference signal is frequency modulated (FM) on a 9,960 Hz subcarrier. On these VORs, the amplitude modulation is achieved by rotating a slightly directional antenna exactly in phase with the reference signal at 30 revolutions per second. Modern installations are Doppler VORs (DVOR), which use a circular array of typically 48 omni-directional antennas and no moving parts. The active antenna is moved around the circular array electronically to create a doppler effect, resulting in frequency modulation. The amplitude modulation is created by making the transmission power of antennas at e.g. the north position lower than at the south position. The role of amplitude and frequency modulation is thus swapped in this type of VOR. Decoding in the receiving aircraft happens in the same way for both types of VORs: the AM and FM 30 Hz components are detected and then compared to determine the phase angle between them.

The VOR signal also contains a modulated continuous wave (MCW) 7 wpm Morse code station identifier, and usually contains an amplitude modulated (AM) voice channel.

This information is then fed over an analog or digital interface to one of four common types of indicators:
#A typical light-airplane VOR indicator, sometimes called an &quot;omni-bearing indicator&quot; or OBI is shown in the illustration at the top of this entry. It consists of a knob to rotate an &quot;Omni Bearing Selector&quot; (OBS), the OBS scale around the outside of the instrument, and a vertical course deviation indicator or (CDI) pointer. The OBS is used to set the desired course, and the CDI is centered when the aircraft is on the selected course, or gives left/right steering commands to return to the course. An &quot;ambiguity&quot; (TO-FROM) indicator shows whether following the selected course would take the aircraft to, or away from the station. The indicator may also include a glideslope pointer for use when receiving full ILS signals.
#A radio magnetic indicator (RMI) features a course arrow superimposed on a rotating card that shows the aircraft&#x27;s current heading at the top of the dial. The &quot;tail&quot; of the course arrow points at the current radial from the station and the &quot;head&quot; of the arrow points at the reciprocal (180° different) course to the station. An RMI may present information from more than one VOR or ADF receiver simultaneously.
#A horizontal situation indicator (HSI), developed subsequently to the RMI, is considerably more expensive and complex than a standard VOR indicator but combines heading information with the navigation display in a much more user-friendly format, approximating a simplified moving map.
#An area navigation (RNAV) system is an onboard computer with display and may include an up-to-date navigation database. At least one VOR/DME station is required for the computer to plot aircraft position on a moving map or to display course deviation and distance relative to a waypoint (virtual VOR station). RNAV type systems have also been made to use two VORs or two DMEs to define a waypoint; these are typically referred to by other names such as &quot;distance computing equipment&quot; for the dual-VOR type or &quot;DME-DME&quot; for the type using more than one DME signal.
In many cases, VOR stations have co-located distance measuring equipment (DME) or military Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN) – the latter includes both the DME distance feature and a separate TACAN azimuth feature that provides military pilots data similar to the civilian VOR. A co-located VOR and TACAN beacon is called a VORTAC. A VOR co-located only with DME is called a VOR-DME. A VOR radial with a DME distance allows a one-station position fix. Both VOR-DMEs and TACANs share the same DME system.

VORTACs and VOR-DMEs use a standardized scheme of VOR frequency to TACAN/DME channel pairing so that a specific VOR frequency is always paired with a specific co-located TACAN or DME channel. On civilian equipment, the VHF frequency is tuned and the appropriate TACAN/DME channel is automatically selected.

While the operating principles are different, VORs share some characteristics with the localizer portion of ILS and the same antenna, receiving equipment and indicator is used in the cockpit for both. When a VOR station is selected, the OBS is functional and allows the pilot to select the desired radial to use for navigation. When a localizer frequency is selected, the OBS is not functional and the indicator is driven by a localizer converter, typically built into the receiver or indicator.

===Service volumes===
A VOR station serves a volume of airspace called its Service Volume. Some VORs have a relatively small geographic area protected from interference by other stations on the same frequency—called &quot;terminal&quot; or T-VORs. Other stations may have protection out to or more. It is popularly thought that there is a standard difference in power output between T-VORs and other stations, but in fact the stations&#x27; power output is set to provide adequate signal strength in the specific site&#x27;s service volume.

In the United States, there are three standard service volumes (SSV): terminal, low, and high (standard service volumes do not apply to published instrument flight rules (IFR) routes).

Additionally, two new service volumes – &quot;VOR low&quot; and &quot;VOR high&quot; – were added in 2021, providing expanded coverage above 5,000 feet AGL. This allows aircraft to continue to receive off-route VOR signals despite the reduced number of VOR ground stations provided by the VOR Minimum Operational Network.

===VORs, airways and the en route structure===

VOR and the older NDB stations were traditionally used as intersections along airways. A typical airway will hop from station to station in straight lines. When flying in a commercial airliner, an observer will notice that the aircraft flies in straight lines occasionally broken by a turn to a new course. These turns are often made as the aircraft passes over a VOR station or at an intersection in the air defined by one or more VORs.
Navigational reference points can also be defined by the point at which two radials from different VOR stations intersect, or by a VOR radial and a DME distance. This is the basic form of RNAV and allows navigation to points located away from VOR stations. As RNAV systems have become more common, in particular those based on GPS, more and more airways have been defined by such points, removing the need for some of the expensive ground-based VORs.

In many countries there are two separate systems of airway at lower and higher levels: the lower &quot;Airways&quot; (known in the US as &quot;Victor Airways&quot;) and &quot;Upper Air Routes&quot; (known in the US as &quot;Jet routes&quot;).

Most aircraft equipped for instrument flight (IFR) have at least two VOR receivers. As well as providing a backup to the primary receiver, the second receiver allows the pilot to easily follow a radial to or from one VOR station while watching the second receiver to see when a certain radial from another VOR station is crossed, allowing the aircraft&#x27;s exact position at that moment to be determined, and giving the pilot the option of changing to the new radial if they wish.

===Future===
, space-based Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) are increasingly replacing VOR and other ground-based systems. In 2016, GNSS was mandated as the primary needs of navigation for IFR aircraft in Australia.

GNSS systems have a lower transmitter cost per customer and provide distance and altitude data. Future satellite navigation systems, such as the European Union Galileo, and GPS augmentation systems are developing techniques to eventually equal or exceed VOR accuracy. However, low VOR receiver cost, broad installed base and commonality of receiver equipment with ILS are likely to extend VOR dominance in aircraft until space receiver cost falls to a comparable level. As of 2008 in the United States, GPS-based approaches outnumbered VOR-based approaches but VOR-equipped IFR aircraft outnumber GPS-equipped IFR aircraft.

There is some concern that GNSS navigation is subject to interference or sabotage, leading in many countries to the retention of VOR stations for use as a backup. The VOR signal has the advantage of static mapping to local terrain.

The US FAA plans by 2020 to decommission roughly half of the 967 VOR stations in the US, retaining a &quot;Minimum Operational Network&quot; to provide coverage to all aircraft more than 5,000 feet above the ground. Most of the decommissioned stations will be east of the Rocky Mountains, where there is more overlap in coverage between them. On July 27, 2016, a final policy statement was released specifying stations to be decommissioned by 2025. A total of 74 stations are to be decommissioned in Phase 1 (2016–2020), and 234 more stations are scheduled to be taken out of service in Phase 2 (2021–2025).

In the UK, 19 VOR transmitters are to be kept operational until at least 2020. Those at Cranfield and Dean Cross were decommissioned in 2014, with the remaining 25 to be assessed between 2015 and 2020. Similar efforts are underway in Australia, and elsewhere.

In the UK and the United States, DME transmitters are planned to be retained in the near future even after co-located VORs are decommissioned. However, there are long-term plans to decommission DME, TACAN and NDBs.

==Technical specification==
The VOR signal encodes a morse code identifier, optional voice, and a pair of navigation tones. The radial azimuth is equal to the phase angle between the lagging and leading navigation tone.

===Constants===
===Variables===
===CVOR===

The conventional signal encodes the station identifier, , optional voice , navigation reference signal in , and the isotropic (i.e. omnidirectional) component. The reference signal is encoded on an F3 subcarrier (colour). The navigation variable signal is encoded by mechanically or electrically rotating a directional, , antenna to produce A3 modulation (grey-scale). Receivers (paired colour and grey-scale trace) in different directions from the station paint a different alignment of F3 and A3 demodulated signal.

formula_1

===DVOR===

The doppler signal encodes the station identifier, formula_2 optional audio voice, formula_3 navigation variable signal in formula_4 and the isotropic (i.e. omnidirectional) component. The navigation variable signal is A3 modulated (greyscale). The navigation reference signal is delayed, formula_5 by electrically revolving a pair of transmitters. The cyclic doppler blue shift, and corresponding doppler red shift, as a transmitter closes on and recedes from the receiver results in F3 modulation (colour). The pairing of transmitters offset equally high and low of the isotropic carrier frequency produce the upper and lower sidebands. Closing and receding equally on opposite sides of the same circle around the isotropic transmitter produce F3 subcarrier modulation, formula_6

The transmitter acceleration formula_9 (24,000 g) makes mechanical revolution impractical, and halves (gravitational redshift) the frequency change ratio compared to transmitters in free-fall.

The mathematics to describe the operation of a DVOR is far more complex than indicated above. The reference to &quot;electronically rotated&quot; is a vast simplification. The primary complication relates to a process that is called &quot;blending&quot;.

Another complication is that the phase of the upper and lower sideband signals have to be locked to each other. The composite signal is detected by the receiver. The electronic operation of detection effectively shifts the carrier down to 0 Hz, folding the signals with frequencies below the Carrier, on top of the frequencies above the carrier. Thus the upper and lower sidebands are summed. If there is a phase shift between these two, then the combination will have a relative amplitude of If was , then the aircraft&#x27;s receiver would not detect any sub-carrier (signal A3).

&quot;Blending&quot; describes the process by which a sideband signal is switched from one antenna to the next. The switching is not discontinuous. The amplitude of the next antenna rises as the amplitude of the current antenna falls. When one antenna reaches its peak amplitude, the next and previous antennas have zero amplitude.

By radiating from two antennas, the effective phase center becomes a point between the two. Thus the phase reference is swept continuously around the ring – not stepped as would be the case with antenna to antenna discontinuous switching.

In the electromechanical antenna switching systems employed before solid state antenna switching systems were introduced, the blending was a by-product of the way the motorized switches worked. These switches brushed a coaxial cable past 48 or 50 antenna feeds. As the cable moved between two antenna feeds, it would couple signal into both.

But blending accentuates another complication of a DVOR.

Each antenna in a DVOR uses an omnidirectional antenna. These are usually Alford Loop antennas (see Andrew Alford). Unfortunately, the sideband antennas are very close together, so that approximately 55% of the energy radiated is absorbed by the adjacent antennas. Half of that is re-radiated, and half is sent back along the antenna feeds of the adjacent antennas. The result is an antenna pattern that is no longer omnidirectional. This causes the effective sideband signal to be amplitude modulated at 60 Hz as far as the aircraft&#x27;s receiver is concerned. The phase of this modulation can affect the detected phase of the sub-carrier. This effect is called &quot;coupling&quot;.

Blending complicates this effect. It does this because when two adjacent antennas radiate a signal, they create a composite antenna.

Imagine two antennas that are separated by half their wavelength. In the transverse direction the two signals will sum, but in the tangential direction they will cancel. Thus as the signal &quot;moves&quot; from one antenna to the next, the distortion in the antenna pattern will increase and then decrease. The peak distortion occurs at the midpoint. This creates a half-sinusoidal 1500 Hz amplitude distortion in the case of a 50 antenna system, (1,440 Hz in a 48 antenna system). This distortion is itself amplitude modulated with a 60 Hz amplitude modulation (also some 30 Hz as well). This distortion can add or subtract with the above-mentioned 60 Hz distortion depending on the carrier phase. In fact one can add an offset to the carrier phase (relative to the sideband phases) so that the 60 Hz components tend to null one another. There is a 30 Hz component, though, which has some pernicious effects.

DVOR designs use all sorts of mechanisms to try to compensate these effects. The methods chosen are major selling points for each manufacturer, with each extolling the benefits of their technique over their rivals.

Note that ICAO Annex 10 limits the worst case amplitude modulation of the sub-carrier to 40%. A DVOR that did not employ some technique to compensate for coupling and blending effects would not meet this requirement.

===Accuracy and reliability===
The predicted accuracy of the VOR system is ±1.4°. However, test data indicates that 99.94% of the time a VOR system has less than ±0.35° of error. Internal monitoring of a VOR station will shut it down, or change over to a standby system if the station error exceeds some limit. A Doppler VOR beacon will typically change over or shut down when the bearing error exceeds 1.0°. National air space authorities may often set tighter limits. For instance, in Australia, a Primary Alarm limit may be set as low as ±0.5° on some Doppler VOR beacons. 

ARINC 711 – 10 January 30, 2002, states that receiver accuracy should be within 0.4° with a statistical probability of 95% under various conditions. Any receiver compliant with this standard can be expected to perform within these tolerances.

All radio navigation beacons are required to monitor their own output. Most have redundant systems, so that the failure of one system will cause automatic change-over to one or more standby systems. The monitoring and redundancy requirements in some instrument landing systems (ILS) can be very strict.

The general philosophy followed is that no signal is preferable to a poor signal.

VOR beacons monitor themselves by having one or more receiving antennas located away from the beacon. The signals from these antennas are processed to monitor many aspects of the signals. The signals monitored are defined in various US and European standards. The principal standard is European Organisation for Civil Aviation Equipment (EuroCAE) Standard ED-52. The five main parameters monitored are the bearing accuracy, the reference and variable signal modulation indices, the signal level, and the presence of notches (caused by individual antenna failures).

Note that the signals received by these antennas, in a Doppler VOR beacon, are different from the signals received by an aircraft. This is because the antennas are close to the transmitter and are affected by proximity effects. For example, the free space path loss from nearby sideband antennas will be 1.5 dB different (at 113 MHz and at a distance of 80 m) from the signals received from the far side sideband antennas. For a distant aircraft there will be no measurable difference. Similarly the peak rate of phase change seen by a receiver is from the tangential antennas. For the aircraft these tangential paths will be almost parallel, but this is not the case for an antenna near the DVOR.

The bearing accuracy specification for all VOR beacons is defined in the International Civil Aviation Organization Convention on International Civil Aviation Annex 10, Volume 1.

This document sets the worst case bearing accuracy performance on a Conventional VOR (CVOR) to be ±4°. A Doppler VOR (DVOR) is required to be ±1°.

All radio-navigation beacons are checked periodically to ensure that they are performing to the appropriate International and National standards. This includes VOR beacons, distance measuring equipment (DME), instrument landing systems (ILS), and non-directional beacons (NDB).

Their performance is measured by aircraft fitted with test equipment. The VOR test procedure is to fly around the beacon in circles at defined distances and altitudes, and also along several radials. These aircraft measure signal strength, the modulation indices of the reference and variable signals, and the bearing error. They will also measure other selected parameters, as requested by local/national airspace authorities. Note that the same procedure is used (often in the same flight test) to check distance measuring equipment (DME).

In practice, bearing errors can often exceed those defined in Annex 10, in some directions. This is usually due to terrain effects, buildings near the VOR, or, in the case of a DVOR, some counterpoise effects. Note that Doppler VOR beacons utilize an elevated groundplane that is used to elevate the effective antenna pattern. It creates a strong lobe at an elevation angle of 30° which complements the 0° lobe of the antennas themselves. This groundplane is called a counterpoise. A counterpoise though, rarely works exactly as one would hope. For example, the edge of the counterpoise can absorb and re-radiate signals from the antennas, and it may tend to do this differently in some directions than others.

National air space authorities will accept these bearing errors when they occur along directions that are not the defined air traffic routes. For example, in mountainous areas, the VOR may only provide sufficient signal strength and bearing accuracy along one runway approach path.

Doppler VOR beacons are inherently more accurate than conventional VORs because they are less affected by reflections from hills and buildings. The variable signal in a DVOR is the 30 Hz FM signal; in a CVOR it is the 30 Hz AM signal. If the AM signal from a CVOR beacon bounces off a building or hill, the aircraft will see a phase that appears to be at the phase centre of the main signal and the reflected signal, and this phase center will move as the beam rotates. In a DVOR beacon, the variable signal, if reflected, will seem to be two FM signals of unequal strengths and different phases. Twice per 30 Hz cycle, the instantaneous deviation of the two signals will be the same, and the phase locked loop will get (briefly) confused. As the two instantaneous deviations drift apart again, the phase locked loop will follow the signal with the greatest strength, which will be the line-of-sight signal. If the phase separation of the two deviations is small, however, the phase locked loop will become less likely to lock on to the true signal for a larger percentage of the 30 Hz cycle (this will depend on the bandwidth of the output of the phase comparator in the aircraft). In general, some reflections can cause minor problems, but these are usually about an order of magnitude less than in a CVOR beacon.

==Using a VOR==
If a pilot wants to approach the VOR station from due east then the aircraft will have to fly due west to reach the station. The pilot will use the OBS to rotate the compass dial until the number 27 (270°) aligns with the pointer (called the &quot;primary index&quot;) at the top of the dial. When the aircraft intercepts the 90° radial (due east of the VOR station) the needle will be centered and the To/From indicator will show &quot;To&quot;. Notice that the pilot sets the VOR to indicate the reciprocal; the aircraft will follow the 90° radial while the VOR indicates that the course &quot;to&quot; the VOR station is 270°. This is called &quot;proceeding inbound on the 090 radial.&quot; The pilot needs only to keep the needle centered to follow the course to the VOR station. If the needle drifts off-center the aircraft would be turned towards the needle until it is centered again. After the aircraft passes over the VOR station the To/From indicator will indicate &quot;From&quot; and the aircraft is then proceeding outbound on the 270° radial. The CDI needle may oscillate or go to full scale in the &quot;cone of confusion&quot; directly over the station but will recenter once the aircraft has flown a short distance beyond the station.

In the illustration on the right, notice that the heading ring is set with 360° (north) at the primary index, the needle is centred and the To/From indicator is showing &quot;TO&quot;. The VOR is indicating that the aircraft is on the 360° course (north) &quot;to&quot; the VOR station (i.e. the aircraft is &quot;south&quot; of the VOR station). If the To/From indicator were showing &quot;From&quot; it would mean the aircraft was on the 360° radial &quot;from&quot; the VOR station (i.e. the aircraft is &quot;north&quot; of the VOR). Note that there is absolutely no indication of what direction the aircraft is flying. The aircraft could be flying due West and this snapshot of the VOR could be the moment when it crossed the 360° radial.

===Testing===
Before using a VOR indicator for the first time, it can be tested and calibrated at an airport with a &quot;VOR test facility&quot;, or VOT. A VOT differs from a VOR in that it replaces the variable directional signal with another omnidirectional signal, in a sense transmitting a 360° radial in all directions. The NAV receiver is tuned to the VOT frequency, then the OBS is rotated until the needle is centred. If the indicator reads within four degrees of 000 with the FROM flag visible or 180 with the TO flag visible, it is considered usable for navigation. The FAA requires testing and calibration of a VOR indicator no more than 30 days before any flight under IFR.

===Intercepting VOR radials===
There are many methods available to determine what heading to fly to intercept a radial from the station or a course to the station. The most common method involves the acronym T-I-T-P-I-T. The acronym stands for Tune – Identify – Twist – Parallel – Intercept – Track. Each of these steps are quite important to ensure the aircraft is headed where it is being directed. First, tune the desired VOR frequency into the navigation radio, second and most important, Identify the correct VOR station by verifying the Morse code heard with the sectional chart. Third, twist the VOR OBS knob to the desired radial (FROM) or course (TO) the station. Fourth, bank the aircraft until the heading indicator indicates the radial or course set in the VOR. The fifth step is to fly towards the needle. If the needle is to the left, turn left by 30–45° and vice versa. The last step is once the VOR needle is centred, turn the heading of the aircraft back to the radial or course to track down the radial or course flown. If there is wind, a wind correction angle will be necessary to maintain the VOR needle centred.

Another method to intercept a VOR radial exists and more closely aligns itself with the operation of an HSI (Horizontal Situation Indicator). The first three steps above are the same; tune, identify and twist. At this point, the VOR needle should be displaced to either the left or the right. Looking at the VOR indicator, the numbers on the same side as the needle will always be the headings needed to return the needle back to centre. The aircraft heading should then be turned to align itself with one of those shaded headings. If done properly, this method will produce reverse sensing. Using this method will ensure quick understanding of how an HSI works as the HSI visually shows what we are mentally trying to do.

In the adjacent diagram, an aircraft is flying a heading of 180° while located at a bearing of 315° from the VOR. After twisting the OBS knob to 360°, the needle deflects to the right. The needle &quot;shades&quot; the numbers between 360 and 090. If the aircraft turns to a heading anywhere in this range, the aircraft will intercept the radial. Although the needle deflects to the right, the shortest way of turning to the shaded range is a turn to the left.

<doc id="351908" wikidata="Q1434353" url="?curid=351908" title="Almost surely">
<text>In probability theory, an event is said to happen almost surely (sometimes abbreviated as a.s.) if it happens with probability 1 (with respect to the probability measure). In other words, the set of outcomes on which the event does not occur has probability 0, even though the set might not be empty. The concept is analogous to the concept of &quot;almost everywhere&quot; in measure theory. In probability experiments on a finite sample space with a non-zero probability for each outcome, there is no difference between &quot;almost surely&quot; and &quot;surely&quot; (since having a probability of 1 entails including all the sample points); however, this distinction becomes important when the sample space is an infinite set, because an infinite set can have non-empty subsets of probability 0.

Some examples of the use of this concept include the strong and uniform versions of the law of large numbers, the continuity of the paths of Brownian motion, and the infinite monkey theorem. The terms almost certainly (a.c.) and almost always (a.a.) are also used. Almost never describes the opposite of &quot;almost surely&quot;: an event that happens with probability zero happens &quot;almost never&quot;.

==Formal definition==
Let formula_1 be a probability space. An event formula_2 happens &quot;almost surely&quot; if formula_3. Equivalently, formula_4 happens almost surely if the probability of formula_4 not occurring is zero: formula_6. More generally, any set formula_7 (not necessarily in formula_8) happens almost surely if formula_9 is contained in a null set: a subset formula_10 in formula_11 such that The notion of almost sureness depends on the probability measure formula_12. If it is necessary to emphasize this dependence, it is customary to say that the event formula_4 occurs &quot;P&quot;-almost surely, or almost surely &quot;formula_14&quot;.

==Illustrative examples==
In general, an event can happen &quot;almost surely&quot;, even if the probability space in question includes outcomes which do not belong to the event—as the following examples illustrate.

===Throwing a dart===
Imagine throwing a dart at a unit square (a square with an area of 1) so that the dart always hits an exact point in the square, in such a way that each point in the square is equally likely to be hit. Since the square has area 1, the probability that the dart will hit any particular subregion of the square is equal to the area of that subregion. For example, the probability that the dart will hit the right half of the square is 0.5, since the right half has area 0.5.

Next, consider the event that the dart hits exactly a point in the diagonals of the unit square. Since the area of the diagonals of the square is 0, the probability that the dart will land exactly on a diagonal is 0. That is, the dart will &quot;almost never&quot; land on a diagonal (equivalently, it will &quot;almost surely&quot; not land on a diagonal), even though the set of points on the diagonals is not empty, and a point on a diagonal is no less possible than any other point.

===Tossing a coin repeatedly===

Consider the case where a (possibly biased) coin is tossed, corresponding to the probability space formula_15, where the event formula_16 occurs if a head is flipped, and formula_17 if a tail is flipped. For this particular coin, it is assumed that the probability of flipping a head is formula_18, from which it follows that the complement event, that of flipping a tail, has probability formula_19.

Now, suppose an experiment were conducted where the coin is tossed repeatedly, with outcomes formula_20 and the assumption that each flip&#x27;s outcome is independent of all the others (i.e., they are independent and identically distributed; &quot;i.i.d&quot;). Define the sequence of random variables on the coin toss space, formula_21 where formula_22. &quot;i.e.&quot; each formula_23 records the outcome of the formula_24th flip.

In this case, any infinite sequence of heads and tails is a possible outcome of the experiment. However, any particular infinite sequence of heads and tails has probability 0 of being the exact outcome of the (infinite) experiment. This is because the &quot;i.i.d.&quot; assumption implies that the probability of flipping all heads over formula_25 flips is simply formula_26. Letting formula_27 yields 0, since formula_28 by assumption. The result is the same no matter how much we bias the coin towards heads, so long as we constrain formula_29 to be strictly between 0 and 1. In fact, the same result even holds in non-standard analysis—where infinitesimal probabilities are allowed.

Moreover, the event &quot;the sequence of tosses contains at least one formula_30&quot; will also happen almost surely (i.e., with probability 1).
But if instead of an infinite number of flips, flipping stops after some finite time, say 1,000,000 flips, then the probability of getting an all-heads sequence, formula_31, would no longer be 0, while the probability of getting at least one tails, formula_32, would no longer be 1 (i.e., the event is no longer almost sure).

==Asymptotically almost surely==
In asymptotic analysis, a property is said to hold &quot;asymptotically almost surely&quot; (a.a.s.) if over a sequence of sets, the probability converges to 1. This is equivalent to convergence in probability. For instance, in number theory, a large number is asymptotically almost surely composite, by the prime number theorem; and in random graph theory, the statement &quot;formula_33 is connected&quot; (where formula_34 denotes the graphs on formula_25 vertices with edge probability formula_29) is true a.a.s. when, for some formula_37

:formula_38   

In number theory, this is referred to as &quot;almost all&quot;, as in &quot;almost all numbers are composite&quot;. Similarly, in graph theory, this is sometimes referred to as &quot;almost surely&quot;.

<doc id="351909" wikidata="Q1790314" url="?curid=351909" title="Diegesis">
<text>Diegesis (; , ) is a style of fiction storytelling in which a participating narrator offers an on-site, often interior, view of the scene to the reader, viewer, or listener by subjectively describing the actions and, in some cases, thoughts, of one or more characters. Diegetic events are those experienced by both the characters within a piece and the audience, while non-diegetic elements of a story make up the &quot;fourth wall&quot; separating the characters from the audience. Diegesis in music describes a character&#x27;s ability to hear the music presented for the audience, in the context of musical theatre or film scoring.

== Origin ==
&quot;Diegesis&quot; (Greek διήγησις &quot;narration&quot;) and &quot;mimesis&quot; (Greek μίμησις &quot;imitation&quot;) have been contrasted since Aristotle. For Aristotle, &quot;mimesis&quot; &quot;shows&quot; rather than &quot;tells&quot;, by means of action that is enacted. &quot;Diegesis&quot; is the &quot;telling&quot; of a story by a narrator. The narrator may speak as a particular character, or may be the &quot;invisible narrator&quot;, or even the &quot;all-knowing narrator&quot; who speaks from &quot;outside&quot; in the form of commenting on the action or the characters.

== In literature ==
For narratologists all parts of narratives—characters, narrators, existents, actors—are characterized in terms of diegesis. In literature, discussions of diegesis tend to concern discourse/sjužet (in Russian Formalism) (vs. story/fabula). In diegesis, the narrator &quot;tells&quot; the story. 
# Details about the world itself and the experiences of its characters are revealed explicitly through narrative.
# The story is told or recounted, as opposed to shown or enacted.
# There is a presumed detachment from the story of both the speaker and the audience.

Diegesis is multi-levelled in narrative fiction. Gérard Genette distinguishes between three &quot;diegetic levels&quot;. The extradiegetic level (the level of the narrative&#x27;s telling) is, according to Prince, &quot;external to (not part of) any diegesis.&quot; One might think of this as what we commonly understand to be the narrator&#x27;s level, the level at which exists a narrator who is not part of the story being told. The diegetic level or intradiegetic level is understood as the level of the characters, their thoughts and actions. John Watson of the Sherlock Holmes stories is a diegetic narrator because he is narrating from within the story. The metadiegetic level or hypodiegetic level is that part of a diegesis that is embedded in another one and is often understood as a story within a story, as when diegetic narrators themselves tell a story.

In dramatic texts, the poet never speaks directly; in narrative texts, the poet speaks as themself.

== In film ==
In filmmaking the term is used to refer to the story as it is directly depicted onscreen, as opposed to the (typically much longer) real time events which said story purports to tell. (It is the difference between seeing an intertitle reading &quot;a week later,&quot; and simply waiting a week.) Diegesis may concern elements, such as characters, events, and things within the main or &quot;primary&quot; narrative. However, the author may include elements that are not intended for the primary narrative, such as stories within stories. Characters and events may be referred to elsewhere or in historical contexts and are therefore outside the main story; thus, they are presented in an &quot;extradiegetic&quot; situation.
The classical distinction between the diegetic mode and the mimetic mode relates to the difference between the &quot;epos&quot; (or epic poetry) and &quot;drama&quot;. The &quot;epos&quot; relates stories by &quot;telling&quot; them through narration, while drama enacts stories through direct embodiment (&quot;showing&quot;). In terms of classical poetics, the cinema is an &quot;epic&quot; form that utilizes &quot;dramatic&quot; elements; this is determined by the technologies of &quot;the camera&quot; and &quot;editing&quot;. Even in a spatially and temporally continuous scene (mimicking the theatrical situation, as it were), the camera &quot;chooses&quot; for us where to look - and where not to look. In a similar way, editing causes us to jump from one place (and/or time) to another, whether it be elsewhere in the room, or across town. This jump is a form of narration; it is as if a narrator whispers to us: &quot;meanwhile, on the other side of the forest&quot;. It is for this reason that the &quot;story-world&quot; in cinema is referred to as &quot;diegetic&quot;; elements that belong to the film&#x27;s narrative world are diegetic elements. This is why, in the cinema, we may refer to the film&#x27;s &quot;diegetic world&quot;.

&quot;Diegetic&quot;, in the cinema, typically refers to the internal world created by the story that the characters themselves experience and encounter: the narrative &quot;space&quot; that includes all the parts of the story, both those that are and those that are not actually shown on the screen, such as events that have led up to the present action; people who are being talked about; or events that are presumed to have happened elsewhere or at a different time; such as the intro to &quot;Star Wars&quot;, with its now classic &quot;A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...&quot;

Thus, elements of a film can be &quot;diegetic&quot; or &quot;non diegetic&quot;. These terms are most commonly used in reference to sound in a film. Most soundtrack music in films is non diegetic; heard by the audience, but not by the characters. Some films reverse this convention; for example, &quot;Baby Driver&quot; employs diegetic music, played by the characters on music devices, to which many of the film&#x27;s action scenes are set. These terms can also apply to other elements. For example, an insert shot that depicts something that is neither taking place in the world of the film, nor is seen, imagined, or thought by a character, is a non-diegetic insert. Titles, subtitles, and voice-over narration (with some exceptions) are also non-diegetic.

== In video games ==
In video games &quot;diegesis&quot; comprises the narrative game world, its characters, objects and actions which can be classified as &quot;intra-diegetic&quot;, by both being part of the narration and not breaking the fourth wall. Status icons, menu bars and other UI which are not part of the game world itself can be considered as &quot;extra-diegetic&quot;; a game character does not know about them even though for the player they may present crucial information. A noted example of a diegetic interface in video games is that of the &quot;Dead Space&quot; series, in which the player-character is equipped with an advanced survival suit that projects holographic images to the character within the game&#x27;s rendering engine that also serve as the game&#x27;s user-interface to the player to show weapon selection, inventory management, and special actions that can be taken.

<text>The red-headed woodpecker (Melanerpes erythrocephalus) is a mid-sized woodpecker found in temperate North America. Its breeding habitat is open country across southern Canada and the east-central United States. It is rated as least concern on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)&#x27;s Red List of Endangered species, having been down-listed from near threatened in 2018.

The red-headed woodpecker should not be confused with the red-bellied woodpecker, which is similar in size but has a vibrant orange-red crown and nape; the red-bellied woodpecker is named for the pale reddish blush of its lower belly and has a distinctly patterned black and white back rather than the solid black one of the red-headed woodpecker.

==Taxonomy==
The English naturalist Mark Catesby described and illustrated the red-headed woodpecker in his book &quot;The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands&quot;, which was published between 1729 and 1732. Catesby used the English name &quot;The Red-headed Wood-pecker&quot; and the Latin &quot;Picus capite toto rubro&quot;. In 1758, the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; to its tenth edition. He included the red-headed woodpecker and coined the binomial name &quot;Picus erythrocephalus&quot;, citing Catesby&#x27;s book. The specific epithet combines the Classical Greek ἐρυθρός, &quot;eruthros&quot;, meaning &quot;red&quot;, and κεφαλή, &quot;kephalos&quot; meaning &quot;headed&quot;. The type locality is South Carolina. The red-headed woodpecker is one of 24 species now placed in the genus &quot;Melanerpes&quot;, which was introduced by the English ornithologist William Swainson in 1832 specifically to accommodate the red-headed woodpecker. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognized.

==Description==
Adults are distinctly tricolored, with a black back and tail, a white belly and rump, and a red head and neck. The wings are black with white secondary remiges. Adult males and females are identical in plumage. Juveniles have similar markings, but their heads are grey. Red-headed woodpeckers are entirely crimson above their shoulders.

These are mid-sized woodpeckers. Both sexes measure from in length, with a wingspan of . They weigh from , with an average of . Each wing measures ; the tail measures , the bill measures and the tarsus measures . The maximum longevity in the wild is 9.9 years.

This species gives a &quot;tchur-tchur&quot; call or a on its territory.
==Behavior==

=== Food and feeding ===
The red-headed woodpecker is omnivorous, eating insects, seeds, fruits, berries, nuts, and occasionally small rodents―even the eggs of other birds. About two-thirds of its diet consists of plants. Red-headed woodpeckers keep food caches. This behavior is only seen in three other species of woodpeckers: the acorn woodpecker, the downy woodpecker, and the red-bellied woodpecker. They have been known to stuff food in tree cavities, crevices, and under tree bark. This keeps them well fed throughout the year.

=== Breeding ===
During the breeding season, a mature male red-headed woodpecker will establish a territory and begin calling and drumming to attract a mate. Once the male has paired with a female, the relationship is believed to be mostly monogamous, and that they will remain paired for multiple breeding seasons. It is uncertain whether these relationships are truly monogamous as there have been reports of polygyny. 

=== Nesting ===
When in an established territory, the parents become very territorial. They have been known to destroy nests and eggs of other birds in their territory. Females choose the location of their new nesting cavity, indicating their choice by tapping on a site. This site could be a natural cavity, the wintering cavity used by the male, a cavity used the season before, a fence post, utility poles, or a dead tree. If the chosen site does not already have a nesting cavity, then both parents will drill out the nesting cavity, though the male will do most of the work. The chosen locations of these cavities are mostly in dead trees or utility poles between above the ground. In early May, the female lays four to seven white eggs, which are incubated for two weeks. The female incubates the eggs during the day and the male takes over at night. After hatching, the young are cared for by both parents. The young will stay in the nest until they are old enough to fledge, which is usually after 27 to 31 days. After the first brood leaves the nest, the parents may start a second brood while still taking care of the fledglings from the first brood, though the first brood will not need as much care. This second brood may be raised in the same nesting cavity as the first, but it is common for the parents to make a fresh nesting cavity. The fledglings are proficient flyers, and most are able to feed and care for themselves without too much help from the parents. Most of the fledglings will disperse on their own within a couple of weeks, but if a fledgling is still in the territory after a few weeks the parents will chase them out to force them to disperse. Two broods can be raised in a single nesting season.

=== Migration ===
By late October, northern birds begin to migrate to the southern parts of the range to overwinter. Most will return to their breeding range by late April. Southern birds may not migrate.

==Status==
The red-headed woodpecker was returned to a designation of least concern on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)&#x27;s Red List of Endangered Species in 2018, having been downgraded to near threatened in 2004 after it appeared to have experienced a 65.5% decline in population over 40 years. From 1966 to 2015 there was a greater than 1.5% annual population decline throughout the Mississippi and Ohio River valleys and central Florida. Most of the decline in red-headed Woodpeckers can be attributed to loss of habitat and the competition for nesting cavities with the invasive European starling.

Increased habitat management is claimed to have helped in part in stabilizing its numbers, leading to its down-listing.

The red-headed woodpecker was historically a common species in southern Canada and the east-central United States. Consistent long-term population declines have resulted in red-headed woodpecker&#x27;s threatened status in Canada and several states in the US. Throughout most of its range, it inhabits areas that have been heavily altered by humans. Factors attributed to the red-headed woodpecker&#x27;s decline include loss of overall habitat and, within habitats, loss of standing dead wood required for nest sites, limitations in food supply, and possible nest-site competition with other cavity nesters such as European starlings or red-bellied woodpeckers.

==Popular culture==
In 1996, the United States Postal Service issued a 2-cent postage stamp depicting a perched red-headed woodpecker. The stamp was discontinued at some time thereafter, but re-issued in 1999 and remained available for purchase until 2006.

<doc id="351914" wikidata="Q910150" url="?curid=351914" title="Self-assembly">
<text>Self-assembly is a process in which a disordered system of pre-existing components forms an organized structure or pattern as a consequence of specific, local interactions among the components themselves, without external direction. When the constitutive components are molecules, the process is termed molecular self-assembly.

Self-assembly can be classified as either static or dynamic. In &quot;static&quot; self-assembly, the ordered state forms as a system approaches equilibrium, reducing its free energy. However, in &quot;dynamic&quot; self-assembly, patterns of pre-existing components organized by specific local interactions are not commonly described as &quot;self-assembled&quot; by scientists in the associated disciplines. These structures are better described as &quot;self-organized&quot;, although these terms are often used interchangeably.

== In chemistry and materials science ==
Self-assembly in the classic sense can be defined as &quot;the spontaneous and reversible organization of molecular units into ordered structures by non-covalent interactions&quot;. The first property of a self-assembled system that this definition suggests is the spontaneity of the self-assembly process: the interactions responsible for the formation of the self-assembled system act on a strictly local level—in other words, &quot;the nanostructure builds itself&quot;.

Although self-assembly typically occurs between weakly-interacting species, this organization may be transferred into strongly-bound covalent systems. An example for this may be observed in the self-assembly of polyoxometalates. Evidence suggests that such molecules assemble via a dense-phase type mechanism whereby small oxometalate ions first assemble non-covalently in solution, followed by a condensation reaction that covalently binds the assembled units. This process can be aided by the introduction of templating agents to control the formed species. In such a way, highly organized covalent molecules may be formed in a specific manner.

Self-assembled nano-structure is an object that appears as a result of ordering and aggregation of individual nano-scale objects guided by some physical principle.

A particularly counter-intuitive example of a physical principle that can drive self-assembly is entropy maximization. Though entropy is conventionally associated with disorder, under suitable conditions entropy can drive nano-scale objects to self-assemble into target structures in a controllable way.

Another important class of self-assembly is field-directed assembly. An example of this is the phenomenon of electrostatic trapping. In this case an electric field is applied between two metallic nano-electrodes. The particles present in the environment are polarized by the applied electric field. Because of dipole interaction with the electric field gradient the particles are attracted to the gap between the electrodes. Generalizations of this type approach involving different types of fields, e.g., using magnetic fields, using capillary interactions for particles trapped at interfaces, elastic interactions for particles suspended in liquid crystals have also been reported.

Regardless of the mechanism driving self-assembly, people take self-assembly approaches to materials synthesis to avoid the problem of having to construct materials one building block at a time. Avoiding one-at-a-time approaches is important because the amount of time required to place building blocks into a target structure is prohibitively difficult for structures that have macroscopic size.

Once materials of macroscopic size can be self-assembled, those materials can find use in many applications. For example, nano-structures such as nano-vacuum gaps are used for storing energy and nuclear energy conversion. Self-assembled tunable materials are promising candidates for large surface area electrodes in batteries and organic photovoltaic cells, as well as for microfluidic sensors and filters.

=== Distinctive features ===
At this point, one may argue that any chemical reaction driving atoms and molecules to assemble into larger structures, such as precipitation, could fall into the category of self-assembly. However, there are at least three distinctive features that make self-assembly a distinct concept.

==== Order ====
First, the self-assembled structure must have a higher order than the isolated components, be it a shape or a particular task that the self-assembled entity may perform. This is generally not true in chemical reactions, where an ordered state may proceed towards a disordered state depending on thermodynamic parameters.

==== Interactions ====
The second important aspect of self-assembly is the predominant role of weak interactions (e.g. Van der Waals, capillary, formula_1, hydrogen bonds, or entropic forces) compared to more &quot;traditional&quot; covalent, ionic, or metallic bonds. These weak interactions are important in materials synthesis for two reasons.

First, weak interactions take a prominent place in materials, especially in biological systems. For instance, they determine the physical properties of liquids, the solubility of solids, and the organization of molecules in biological membranes.

Second, in addition to the strength of the interactions, interactions with varying degrees of specificity can control self-assembly. Self-assembly that is mediated by DNA pairing interactions constitutes the interactions of the highest specificity that have been used to drive self-assembly. At the other extreme, the least specific interactions are possibly those provided by emergent forces that arise from entropy maximization.

==== Building blocks ====
The third distinctive feature of self-assembly is that the building blocks are not only atoms and molecules, but span a wide range of nano- and mesoscopic structures, with different chemical compositions, functionalities, and shapes. Research into possible three-dimensional shapes of self-assembling micrites examines Platonic solids (regular polyhedral). The term &#x27;micrite&#x27; was created by DARPA to refer to sub-millimeter sized microrobots, whose self-organizing abilities may be compared with those of slime mold. Recent examples of novel building blocks include polyhedra and patchy particles. Examples also included microparticles with complex geometries, such as hemispherical, dimer, discs, rods, molecules, as well as multimers. These nanoscale building blocks can in turn be synthesized through conventional chemical routes or by other self-assembly strategies such as directional entropic forces. More recently, inverse design approaches have appeared where it is possible to fix a target self-assembled behavior, and determine an appropriate building block that will realize that behavior.

=== Thermodynamics and kinetics ===
Self-assembly in microscopic systems usually starts from diffusion, followed by the nucleation of seeds, subsequent growth of the seeds, and ends at Ostwald ripening. The thermodynamic driving free energy can be either enthalpic or entropic or both. In either the enthalpic or entropic case, self-assembly proceeds through the formation and breaking of bonds, possibly with non-traditional forms of mediation.
The kinetics of the self-assembly process is usually related to diffusion, for which the absorption/adsorption rate often follows a Langmuir adsorption model which in the diffusion controlled concentration (relatively diluted solution) can be estimated by the Fick&#x27;s laws of diffusion. The desorption rate is determined by the bond strength of the surface molecules/atoms with a thermal activation energy barrier. The growth rate is the competition between these two processes.

=== Examples ===
Important examples of self-assembly in materials science include the formation of molecular crystals, colloids, lipid bilayers, phase-separated polymers, and self-assembled monolayers. The folding of polypeptide chains into proteins and the folding of nucleic acids into their functional forms are examples of self-assembled biological structures. Recently, the three-dimensional macroporous structure was prepared via self-assembly of diphenylalanine derivative under cryoconditions, the obtained material can find the application in the field of regenerative medicine or drug delivery system. P. Chen et al. demonstrated a microscale self-assembly method using the air-liquid interface established by Faraday wave as a template. This self-assembly method can be used for generation of diverse sets of symmetrical and periodic patterns from microscale materials such as hydrogels, cells, and cell spheroids. Yasuga et al. demonstrated how fluid interfacial energy drives the emergence of three-dimensional periodic structures in micropillar scaffolds. Myllymäki et al. demonstrated the formation of micelles, that undergo a change in morphology to fibers and eventually to spheres, all controlled by solvent change.

=== Properties ===
Self-assembly extends the scope of chemistry aiming at synthesizing products with order and functionality properties, extending chemical bonds to weak interactions and encompassing the self-assembly of nanoscale building blocks at all length scales. In covalent synthesis and polymerization, the scientist links atoms together in any desired conformation, which does not necessarily have to be the energetically most favoured position; self-assembling molecules, on the other hand, adopt a structure at the thermodynamic minimum, finding the best combination of interactions between subunits but not forming covalent bonds between them. In self-assembling structures, the scientist must predict this minimum, not merely place the atoms in the location desired.

Another characteristic common to nearly all self-assembled systems is their thermodynamic stability. For self-assembly to take place without intervention of external forces, the process must lead to a lower Gibbs free energy, thus self-assembled structures are thermodynamically more stable than the single, unassembled components. A direct consequence is the general tendency of self-assembled structures to be relatively free of defects. An example is the formation of two-dimensional superlattices composed of an orderly arrangement of micrometre-sized polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) spheres, starting from a solution containing the microspheres, in which the solvent is allowed to evaporate slowly in suitable conditions. In this case, the driving force is capillary interaction, which originates from the deformation of the surface of a liquid caused by the presence of floating or submerged particles.

These two properties—weak interactions and thermodynamic stability—can be recalled to rationalise another property often found in self-assembled systems: the &quot;sensitivity to perturbations&quot; exerted by the external environment. These are small fluctuations that alter thermodynamic variables that might lead to marked changes in the structure and even compromise it, either during or after self-assembly. The weak nature of interactions is responsible for the flexibility of the architecture and allows for rearrangements of the structure in the direction determined by thermodynamics. If fluctuations bring the thermodynamic variables back to the starting condition, the structure is likely to go back to its initial configuration. This leads us to identify one more property of self-assembly, which is generally not observed in materials synthesized by other techniques: &quot;reversibility&quot;.

Self-assembly is a process which is easily influenced by external parameters. This feature can make synthesis rather complex because of the need to control many free parameters. Yet self-assembly has the advantage that a large variety of shapes and functions on many length scales can be obtained.

The fundamental condition needed for nanoscale building blocks to self-assemble into an ordered structure is the simultaneous presence of long-range repulsive and short-range attractive forces.

By choosing precursors with suitable physicochemical properties, it is possible to exert a fine control on the formation processes that produce complex structures. Clearly, the most important tool when it comes to designing a synthesis strategy for a material, is the knowledge of the chemistry of the building units. For example, it was demonstrated that it was possible to use diblock copolymers with different block reactivities in order to selectively embed maghemite nanoparticles and generate periodic materials with potential use as waveguides.

In 2008 it was proposed that every self-assembly process presents a co-assembly, which makes the former term a misnomer. This thesis is built on the concept of mutual ordering of the self-assembling system and its environment.

== At the macroscopic scale ==
The most common examples of self-assembly at the macroscopic scale can be seen at interfaces between gases and liquids, where molecules can be confined at the nanoscale in the vertical direction and spread over long distances laterally. Examples of self-assembly at gas-liquid interfaces include breath-figures, self-assembled monolayers, droplet clusters, and Langmuir–Blodgett films, while crystallization of fullerene whiskers is an example of macroscopic self-assembly in between two liquids. Another remarkable example of macroscopic self-assembly is the formation of thin quasicrystals at an air-liquid interface, which can be built up not only by inorganic, but also by organic molecular units. Furthermore, it was reported that Fmoc protected L-DOPA amino acid (Fmoc-DOPA) can present a minimal supramolecular polymer model, displaying a spontaneous structural transition from meta-stable spheres to fibrillar assemblies to gel-like material and finally to single crystals.

Self-assembly processes can also be observed in systems of macroscopic building blocks. These building blocks can be externally propelled or self-propelled. Since the 1950s, scientists have built self-assembly systems exhibiting centimeter-sized components ranging from passive mechanical parts to mobile robots. For systems at this scale, the component design can be precisely controlled. For some systems, the components&#x27; interaction preferences are programmable. The self-assembly processes can be easily monitored and analyzed by the components themselves or by external observers.

In April 2014, a 3D printed plastic was combined with a &quot;smart material&quot; that self-assembles in water, resulting in &quot;4D printing&quot;.

== Consistent concepts of self-organization and self-assembly ==
People regularly use the terms &quot;self-organization&quot; and &quot;self-assembly&quot; interchangeably. As complex system science becomes more popular though, there is a higher need to clearly distinguish the differences between the two mechanisms to understand their significance in physical and biological systems. Both processes explain how collective order develops from &quot;dynamic small-scale interactions&quot;. Self-organization is a non-equilibrium process where self-assembly is a spontaneous process that leads toward equilibrium. Self-assembly requires components to remain essentially unchanged throughout the process. Besides the thermodynamic difference between the two, there is also a difference in formation. The first difference is what &quot;encodes the global order of the whole&quot; in self-assembly whereas in self-organization this initial encoding is not necessary. Another slight contrast refers to the minimum number of units needed to make an order. Self-organization appears to have a minimum number of units whereas self-assembly does not. The concepts may have particular application in connection with natural selection.
Eventually, these patterns may form one theory of pattern formation in nature.

<text>The Protectors is a British action thriller television series created by Gerry Anderson. It starred Robert Vaughn as Harry Rule, Nyree Dawn Porter as the Contessa Caroline di Contini, and Tony Anholt as Paul Buchet. It was Anderson&#x27;s second television series to exclusively use live actors as opposed to marionettes following &quot;UFO&quot;, and his second to be firmly set in contemporary times post &quot;The Secret Service&quot;. It was also the only Gerry Anderson–produced television series that was not of the fantasy or science fiction genres. It was produced by Lew Grade&#x27;s ITC Entertainment production company. Despite not featuring marionettes or any real science fiction elements, &quot;The Protectors&quot; became one of Anderson&#x27;s most popular productions, easily winning a renewal for a second series. A third series was in the planning stages when the show&#x27;s major sponsor, Brut, ended its funding which forced the series&#x27; cancellation.

&quot;The Protectors&quot; was first broadcast in 1972 and 1973, and ran to 52 episodes over two series, each 25 minutes long—making it one of the last series of this type to be produced in a half-hour format. 

==Premise==
Three inexplicably affluent international private detectives/troubleshooters are charged with ensuring the protection of innocents. They belong to an organisation called The Protectors, based in London. Harry Rule leads the group. The Contessa lives in Italy, when she is not working with Harry. She runs her own detective agency, which specialises in exposing art frauds and recovering stolen art. Paul Buchet works out of Paris, and is the group&#x27;s researcher and gadget specialist. Adventures range from simple kidnapping to convoluted cases of international intrigue. These characters are all very wealthy and drive exotic cars of the era, such as the Citroën SM and Jensen Interceptor.

The show was parodied in two episodes of the 1996 BBC Radio 4 comedy series &quot;Fab TV&quot;: &quot;The Preventers&quot; and &quot;The Return of the Preventers&quot;.

==Production==
According to co-producer Gerry Anderson, the show&#x27;s format was outlined in a brief note that Lew Grade gave him, and he was then given a free hand to develop it, although Grade ultimately cast two of the main actors himself. The format of the series allowed for occasional episodes in which not all of the main actors appeared, including two in which Vaughn&#x27;s character was absent.

Like &quot;The Persuaders!&quot;, a similar series also produced by ITC that aired around the same time, &quot;The Protectors&quot; was shot on location at numerous locations throughout Europe, such as Salzburg, Rome, Malta and Paris. In order to offset the cost of location filming, and also perhaps because the equipment was more portable, the series was shot on 16mm film rather than the usual 35mm.

The episodes aimed at fast-paced action set against an international background, incorporating elements from both private-eye detective shows and espionage shows, but within a half-hour format. The lack of screen time, compared with the 50-minute timeslot used by shows like &quot;The Persuaders!&quot; or &quot;Department S&quot;, resulted in plots that were rather simplistic, with motivation and characterisation sacrificed for action, owing to the writers having to cram as much as possible into a 25-minute timeslot and still produce gripping television. Accordingly, the series suffered from most of the same drawbacks that beset &quot;The Adventurer&quot;, another half-hour ITC show that aired at the same time.

The theme tune of the series, &quot;Avenues and Alleyways&quot; was performed by singer Tony Christie.

This was the first Anderson series not to feature music composed by Barry Gray.

Courtfield Mews, London SW5 was used as the filming location for &quot;The Protectors&quot; headquarters.

In Germany the series was known as &quot;Kein Pardon für Schutzengel&quot; (meaning &quot;No Mercy for Guardian Angels&quot;) and in France as &quot;Poigne de fer et séduction&quot; (&quot;Iron Fist and Seduction&quot;). This highlights another snag which bedevilled the show: its English title, &quot;The Protectors&quot;, could imply that Robert Vaughn was playing a bodyguard, in a more serious version of the 1980s ITV show &quot;Minder&quot;.

In South Africa, the series was dubbed into Afrikaans as &quot;Die Beskermers&quot; (the literal translation of The Protectors) and was broadcast on the South African Broadcasting Corporation.

As was the case for most of Anderson&#x27;s series, in the United States the series was not broadcast on network television, but aired instead in first-run syndication. This made it more difficult for the show to make any impact in America, despite its popular American star, and this hurt its overseas sales.

===Actor relationships===
According to Robert Vaughn&#x27;s autobiography, there were many problems between the actor and both the show&#x27;s financier, Lew Grade, and its co-producer, Gerry Anderson. John Hough (who directed several episodes, and the opening title sequence of the series) had many more problems with Vaughn&#x27;s business partner, Sherwood Price, than with Vaughn himself.

Vaughn said that he felt the series was &quot;tasteless junk&quot;, and that he could not understand the scripts either before or during shooting. In a 1972 interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, he criticised the writing and casting, and said that &quot;The Protectors&quot; had failed to live up to his expectations, describing the production as &quot;much below the American standard&quot;. He added that the series &quot;may have the redeeming feature of any escapist entertainment, that you can sit down for 22 minutes and watch people in pretty clothes run around shooting guns and so get your mind off your personal problems. If that&#x27;s redemptive, it has that quality.&quot;

Vaughn was given the opportunity to direct one episode himself—number 23 in production order, &quot;It Could Be Practically Anywhere on the Island&quot;. On this production he met actress Linda Staab; they married three years later, and remained married until his death 42 years later in 2016. Although Vaughn had a better relationship with Grade, the mogul called &quot;It Could Be Practically Anywhere on the Island&quot; the worst episode he had ever seen of anything.

<doc id="351931" wikidata="Q5421447" url="?curid=351931" title="Explosive train">
<text>A triggering sequence, also called an explosive train or a firing train, is a sequence of events that culminates in the detonation of explosives. For safety reasons, most widely used high explosives are difficult to detonate. A primary explosive of higher sensitivity is used to trigger a uniform and predictable detonation of the main body of the explosive. Although the primary explosive itself is generally a more sensitive and expensive compound, it is only used in small quantities and in relatively safely packaged forms. By design there are low explosives and high explosives made such that the low explosives are highly sensitive (i.e. their Figure of Insensitivity is low) and high explosives are comparatively insensitive. This not only affords inherent safety to the usage of explosives during handling and transport, but also necessitates an explosive triggering sequence or explosive train. The explosive triggering sequence or the explosive train essentially consists of an &#x27;initiator&#x27;, an &#x27;intermediary&#x27; and the &#x27;high explosive&#x27;.

For example, a match will not cause plastic explosive to explode, but it will light a fuse coupled with a blasting cap which will detonate a primary explosive that will shock a secondary high explosive and cause it to detonate. In this way, even very insensitive explosives may be used; the primary detonates a &quot;booster&quot; charge that then detonates the main charge. Triggering sequences are used in the mining industry for the detonation of ANFO and other cheap, bulk, and insensitive explosives that cannot be fired by only a blasting cap or similar item.

== Low explosive train ==
An example of a low-explosive train is a rifle cartridge, which consists of 
# a primer consisting of a small amount of primary high explosive which initiates the explosive train
# an igniter which is initiated by the primer and creates a flame that ignites the propellant
# a propellant consisting of a secondary low explosive that emits a large amount of gas as it deflagrates.

== High explosive train ==
High-explosives trains can be either two-step (e.g., detonator, [containing primary explosive] and dynamite / other sensitive secondary) or three-step configuration (e.g., initiator, [detonator, compound cap or NPED] booster of intermediate explosive, and main charge of insensitive secondary explosive).

=== Primary components ===
A high explosive train includes three primary high explosive components which are used to initiate explosives:
# Fuse or fuze
# Primer
# Detonator

Detonators are conventionally made from tetryl and fulminates, but can be made of other initiating explosive materials.

=== Secondary components ===
In an explosive train there are two secondary high explosive components:
# Boosters
# Bursting charges, also known as the main charge

Examples of explosives used in bursting charges are
* TNT
* Composition B
* Ammonal
* Semtex
* RDX
* HMX
* ETN
* PETN
* C-4
* Other suitable Binary explosives

=== Tertiary components ===
#main charge

Examples of main charges are
* TNT
* Composition B
* Pentolite
* Baratol
* Amatol
* PLX
* HMX
* ETN
* PETN
* Other suitable binary explosives

In some cases, the main charge is so insensitive that using typical primary materials becomes impractical due to large amount required. Thus, an explosive booster is used to deliver a sufficient shockwave to successfully initiate the main charge, as so full detonation occurs.

The most significant tertiary material in widespread general usage is ANFO, an explosive binary made from Ammonium nitrate and Fuel oil.

<text>The Illinois Air National Guard (IL ANG) is the aerial militia of the State of Illinois, United States of America. It is a reserve of the United States Air Force and along with the Illinois Army National Guard, an element of the Illinois National Guard.

As state militia units, the units in the Illinois Air National Guard are not in the normal United States Air Force chain of command. They are under the jurisdiction of the Governor of Illinois through the office of the Illinois Adjutant General unless they are federalized by order of the President of the United States. The Illinois Air National Guard is headquartered at Camp Lincoln, Springfield, led by its Commander, Major General Daniel (Dan) McDonough; Chief of Staff, Brigadier General Kevin Jacobs; and Command Chief Master Sergeant Marlon Burton.

==Overview==
Under the &quot;Total Force&quot; concept, Illinois Air National Guard units are considered to be Air Reserve Components (ARC) of the United States Air Force (USAF). Illinois ANG units are trained and equipped by the Air Force and are operationally gained by a Major Command of the USAF if federalized. In addition, the Illinois Air National Guard forces are assigned to Air Expeditionary Forces and are subject to deployment tasking orders along with their active duty and Air Force Reserve counterparts in their assigned cycle deployment window.

Along with their federal reserve obligations, as state militia units the elements of the Illinois ANG are subject to being activated by order of the Governor to provide protection of life and property, and preserve peace, order and public safety. State missions include disaster relief in times of earthquakes, hurricanes, floods and forest fires, search and rescue, protection of vital public services, and support to civil defense.

==Components==
The Illinois Air National Guard consists of the following major units:
* 126th Air Refueling Wing
: Established 1 July 1927 (as: 108th Observation Squadron); operates: KC-135R Stratotanker
: Stationed at: Scott Air Force Base, Belleville
: Gained by: Air Mobility Command
: The 126th Air Refueling Wing provides air refueling support to major commands of the United States Air Force, as well as other U.S. military forces and the military forces of allied nations.

* 182d Airlift Wing
: Established 21 June 1947 (as: 169th Fighter Squadron); operates: C-130H3 Hercules
: Stationed at: Peoria Air National Guard Base
: Gained by: Air Mobility Command
: The 182nd Airlift Wing&#x27;s C-130 Hercules mission is to perform tactical theater airlift missions of personnel and cargo.

*183d Wing

: Established 30 September 1948 (as: 170th Fighter Squadron), General Electric F110 Centralized Repair Facility (CRF) 
: Stationed at: Capital Airport Air National Guard Station, Springfield
: Gained by: Air Force Materiel Command
: A non-flying Wing, the 183d Wing is tasked with augmenting component Numbered Air Force (cNAF) in both the Air and Space Operations Centers (AOC) and the Air Force Forces staff (AFFOR), A1 thru A9.

==History==

The Militia Act of 1903 established the present National Guard system, units raised by the states but paid for by the Federal Government, liable for immediate state service. If federalized by Presidential order, they fall under the regular military chain of command. On 1 June 1920, the Militia Bureau issued Circular No.1 on the organization of National Guard air units.

The History of the Illinois Air National Guard is traced to an armory on Michigan Avenue and 16th Street in Chicago, in 1927. This was the first home of the 108th Observation Squadron, the oldest unit in the Illinois Air National Guard. The original 16 officers and 74 enlisted men were mostly World War I veterans from Chicago, flying PT-1 aircraft. From this small contingent grew a major operation that moved to Midway Municipal Airport.

===World War II===

The unit distinguished itself in World War II, performing anti-submarine patrols in North American O-47 aircraft from a base near the Panama Canal. In September 1943, the unit was inactivated.

Another, later, Illinois ANG unit originated during World War II as the 304th Fighter Squadron, which was activated on 23 July 1942. The 304th FS was assigned to the 337th Fighter Group (FG) at the Pinellas County Airport, Florida, and served as an operational training unit equipped with the P-39 Airacobra and the P-40 Warhawk. The 304th FS was disbanded on 1 May 1944.

===Illinois Air National Guard===
On 24 May 1946, the United States Army Air Forces, in response to dramatic postwar military budget cuts imposed by President Harry S. Truman, allocated inactive unit designations to the National Guard Bureau for the formation of an Air Force National Guard. These unit designations were allotted and transferred to various State National Guard bureaus to provide them unit designations to re-establish them as Air National Guard units.

Led by Lt.Col. Ralph Pickering, the 169th FS held its first drill in December 1946, and it received federal recognition on 21 June 1947. By the end of the first year, the unit consisted of 40 officers and 215 airmen. The original base consisted of a shale runway and a single hangar for eight F-51D Mustang fighters, four AT-6 trainers, and a B-26 tow target plane. The first annual training was held at Midway Municipal Airport, with flying done at Douglas Field.

Lastly, on 30 September 1948, Federal recognition was granted to the 170th Fighter Squadron, the precursor to the 183d Fighter Wing, with 60 men meeting Thursday nights at the State Armory.

===Korean War===
During the Korean War, the 170th Fighter Squadron was ordered to federal duty for 21 months on 1 March 1951. Ten days later, the squadron deployed to Bergstrom Air Force Base, Texas. In April the unit was re-designated the 170th Fighter Bomber Squadron. On 31 July, the 170th moved to George Air Force Base, California and was assigned to the Tactical Air Command. The unit participated in Operation Longhorn, a joint Army-Air Force maneuver at Waco, Texas. In August 1952 the Squadron re-deployed to Springfield, Illinois.

On 1 April 1951 the 126th Bombardment Wing (Light), with units at O&#x27;Hare and Midway Airports, was ordered to federal duty for 21 months as part of the National Guard mobilizations for the Korean War. After 3 months of training, the unit moved to Langley Air Force Base, Virginia. On 30 October 1951 the wing flew their B-26 Invader bombers across the Atlantic Ocean to Bordeaux-Mérignac Air Base, France. In December, the Wing&#x27;s remaining personnel and equipment arrived aboard the USS &quot;General H. F. Hodges&quot;.

The Wing participated in NATO exercises in several countries to include France, the United Kingdom, West Germany and Italy. On 12 May 1952 the 126th moved 90 km north of Paris to Laon-Couvron Air Base. On 1 January 1953, the 126th Bombardment Wing was released from federal service and returned home.

===Cold War===
In 1961, the 126th Air Refueling Group received the first aerial refueling mission in the Air National Guard, flying the KC-97 Stratocruiser. The KC-97 would take the 126th ARG back to Europe, refueling USAFE aircraft under operation &quot;Creek Party&quot; from 1967 to 1976. Some 600 trans-Atlantic flights were flown and 150 million pounds of fuel off-loaded to USAFE and NATO aircraft. It was the first time the Air National Guard had performed a continuous operation without activation.

The 169th FBS received its first federal activation for the Berlin Crisis of 1961. A year later, the 182d Tactical Fighter Group was formed and assumed control of the redesignated 169th Tactical Fighter Squadron. In May 1969, the 182d TFG was redesignated as the 182d Tactical Air Support Group. In January 1970, the wing received its first O-2A Skymaster aircraft. Members of the 182d TASG provided relief assistance during state active duty for the Canton tornado disaster in July 1975.

===Gulf War 1991===
On 2 August 1990, Iraq invaded and occupied the neighboring country of Kuwait. This invasion brought a quick NATO response in the form of a massive military deployment to the Persian Gulf. By 7 August, the first U.S. troops were deployed to the Middle East in support of Operation Desert Shield. President George H. W. Bush called for limited reserve forces on 22 August, but did not activate Illinois National Guard units until September and November. The Illinois National Guard provided a total of 1,371 soldiers and airmen from both Army and Air National Guard units.

The Illinois Air National Guard&#x27;s 126th Air Refueling Wing and 108th Air Refueling Squadron were also mobilized and actively participated in the &quot;Air Bridge&quot; between the United States and the Persian Gulf. The 126th flew 546 missions and delivered more than 27.3 million pounds of fuel to more than 2,880 U.S. and Allied aircraft in support of the Desert Shield Tanker Task Force. In addition to refueling such aircraft as the F-16 and A-10, the units transported military passengers and cargo. The 182nd Tactical Air Support Group was responsible for security at Peoria Airport, MacDill Air Force Base, Florida and Luke Air Force Base, Arizona. The 169th Tactical Air Support Squadron deployed 20 soldiers to Fort Hood, Texas and Fort Irwin, California to support National Guard training.

===Humanitarian missions===
On 16 July 1993, the Governor of Illinois ordered 270 members of the 126th Air Refueling Wing to State Active Duty to support the Illinois National Guard&#x27;s flood control mission during the Great Flood of 1993. Members patrolled levees, sandbagged boils and provided security on a 24 hours basis. Many guardsmen aided in evacuation of residents. Medical personnel aided thousands. The unit had members in Alton, Anna, Carrollton, Carbondale, Cahokia, East St. Louis, East Carondelet, Edwardsville, Evansville, Grafton, Granite City, Hartford, Jerseyville, Murphysboro, Prairie du Rocher, Quincy, Springfield, and Winchester. By the time the crisis was under control in the early fall, over 700 personnel from the 126th Air Refueling Wing and assigned units had pulled duty in the flood ravaged towns.

In 1996, the 182nd AW wing began participation in ongoing flying missions for Operation Joint Endeavor in Bosnia.

===War on Terror===
After the September 11 attacks 2001, Illinois ANG members were called up to support the USAF at various locations around the world. During a September 2002 deployment to Oman, 182nd AW aircraft flew combat supply missions into Afghanistan for Operation Enduring Freedom. On 29 March 2003, SSgt Jacob Frazier of the 169th Air Support Operations Squadron was killed in action while serving with United States Army Special Forces in Afghanistan. He was the first member of the 182nd AW to die in combat.

In March 2003, immediately following mobilization, six Illinois ANG C-130 aircraft and over 350 personnel were deployed to Minhad, United Arab Emirates, for Operation Iraqi Freedom. These airmen returned in August after providing airlift support throughout the theater. Since that mobilization, smaller numbers of wing personnel and aircraft have continually supported Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom. On 28 December 2003, a 182nd AW crew delivered earthquake relief supplies to Iran, becoming the first U.S. aircraft to land there since 1981.

The 183rd FW conducted numerous overseas deployments, including six to Southwest Asia/Iraq, two to Denmark, one to Panama, one to Curaçao, and one to Thailand. As a result of the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure recommendations, the United States Department of Defense changed the mission of the 183rd FW, the last F-16 departed on 23 September 2008.

<text>José Antonio Páez Herrera (; 13 June 1790 – 6 May 1873) was a Venezuelan politician and military officer who served as the president of Venezuela three times. The first as the 5th president from 1830 to 1835, the second as the 8th president from 1839 to 1843, and the third as the 15th president from 1861 to 1863. He fought against the Spanish Crown for Simón Bolívar during the Venezuelan War of Independence. Páez later led Venezuela&#x27;s independence from Gran Colombia.

Páez dominated the country&#x27;s politics for most of the next three decades once the country had achieved independence from Gran Colombia, serving either as president or as the power behind puppet presidents. He is considered a prime example of a 19th-century South American caudillo. He lived in Buenos Aires and New York City during his years in exile and died in the latter in 1873.

== Biography ==

===Early life===
Páez was born in Curpa (now part of Acarigua), Portuguesa State in the Captaincy General of Venezuelapart of the Spanish Empire. His paternal grandmother, Luisa Antonia de Mendoza y Mota, was daughter of Luís Rodríguez de Mendoza, a native of Icod de los Vinos, Tenerife (Canary Island). He was of humble origins, his father being a low level employee of the colonial government. His mother Maria Violante Herrera is said to have been born in Quíbor, Lara as one of the descendants of Welser German settlers. She had a nickname &quot;La Catira de los ojos azules&quot; (The blue-eyed blonde [The term &quot;catira&quot; is a feminine form of &quot;catire&quot;, a Venezuelan slang of &quot;blond.&quot;]) As a boy he was forced to work like a slave. By the age of 20, Páez was married and earning a living by trading cattle.

Late in 1810, he joined a cavalry squadron, led by a former employer, set up with the purpose of fighting the colonial government. In 1813, he asked for leave from his squadron with the intent of setting and leading his own, which he did, joining the Western Republican Army with the rank of sergeant. Páez had an ingratiating personality which made him very much liked amongst those who knew him. He was also looked up to for his skills as a horseman and for his physical capabilities.

===Battles===

Páez, a soldier at heart, started moving up the ranks by winning year after year several engagements against the royalists with his band of marauding llaneros (plainsmen). He came to be known by the nicknames of &quot;El Centauro de los Llanos&quot; (The Centaur of the Plains), and &quot;El León de Payara&quot; (The Lion of Payara) or (The Lion of Apure).

Páez had been leading the fighting in the plains while Simón Bolívar was busy with the eastern part of the country. Early in 1818, both men met to discuss better coordination of their efforts. They briefly combined their forces to fight Pablo Morillo. This campaign included an incident wherein Páez and fifty of his men swam on horseback across the alligator-ridden Apure River, seizing fourteen enemy boats in a rare instance of a cavalry attack defeating naval forces.

Páez was soon ordered to go back to the western plains, where he took from the Spanish the city of San Fernando in Apure.

Páez won all of six major battles that he led by himself, the most celebrated one being the Battle of Las Queseras del Medio.

Late in 1820, an armistice had been signed with the Spanish commander and a temporary suspension of hostilities had taken place. However, ongoing developments were making difficult to maintain the armistice and, consequently, it was agreed it would lapse on 28 April 1821.

All five major fighting groups of the Venezuelan army were to start moving towards a central area. Some with the purpose of joining together in one single group and others with the intention of guarding the approach to that region to prevent royalists units from other far away areas from converging and reinforcing the main Spanish army stationed in the same area.

In early June 1821, the 6,500 men republican army was divided and organized in three divisions. The 1st division, made up of 2,500 men, was under Páez&#x27;s command and formed by two battalions: Bravos de Apure (Apure Braves) and Cazadores Britanicos (British Hunters or as more often translated to English, the British Legions) and seven cavalry regiments.

By 20 June, all three republican divisions converge from different directions in the plain of Carabobo. With the royalists well entrenched in the center and the south, on the morning of 21 June, Páez was given command of an additional cavalry regiment and ordered to take it together with his own division through the hills on the north side and into the plain and to engage the Spanish, while the 2nd division would stay behind Páez and the 3rd would remain in a defensive position waiting to engage the enemy in the center.

On seeing Páez&#x27;s men move, the Spanish commander, Miguel de la Torre, orders one of his elite battalions, the Burgos, to reinforce and defend the north flank. Initially, the Spanish so fiercely engage the Bravos de Apure battalion that it had to fall back on two occasions. Páez sent his Cazadores Britanicos to help the Bravos and together they fought back the Spanish, now reinforced themselves by two additional battalions. As the fighting intensified, de la Torre sent more troops to the north. Páez then sent his cavalry further north to outflank the Spanish and come down on the plain from behind. At this moment, the battle is obviously going against the Spanish, who in desperation kept sending reinforcements. In the meantime, Páez&#x27;s men were gaining terrain and closing on falling Spanish from all sides. Some of the Spanish battalions supposed to join and reinforce the engagement in the north, on seeing how their comrades are faring, decide to disobey orders and retreat. As it becomes evident that the republicans were winning the battle, the other divisions moved forward, but by now the bulk of the work had already been done by Páez and his men.

With the Battle of Carabobo, the military fate of the Spanish army in Venezuela was sealed. The victory was carried by Páez. Bolívar promoted him on site to General in Chief of the republican army.

In the battle, the Spanish lost over 65% of their men; the survivors took refuge in the castle of Puerto Cabello. Until it was taken by Páez and his men in 1823, this was the last Spanish stronghold in Venezuela territory.

===Politics, La Cosiata===

Following the Battle of Carabobo, Páez was named General Commander of the provinces of Caracas and Barinas (at the time they included the important regions of Caracas, Barquisimeto, Barinas and Apure).

It had been Bolivar&#x27;s dream to unite the liberated Spanish provinces into a single great country: La Gran Colombia. This was made up of present-day Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Panama. As the war against Spain came to an end, federalist and regionalist sentiments began to arise in these areas.

While Bolívar was engaged in military campaigns in Peru, he was unable to carry on his duties as president of Gran Colombia. As a result, the center of power of the executive branch was in Bogotá under the leadership of Vice President Francisco de Paula Santander, from New Granada (modern-day Colombia, Ecuador, and Panama). While some leaders saw Gran Colombia as only a military necessity, others considered it an active administrative entity. Confusion arose between the central government in Bogotá and the provinces and the municipalities.

Páez and some Venezuelan politicians became uncomfortable. In 1826, after the Congress in Santa Fe de Bogotá under Santander found a Venezuelan hero from the independence war guilty of assassinating the French Colonel Emanuel Roergas Serviez in Colombia, Páez initiated and led a movement that became known as &quot;La Cosiata.&quot; (This word did not exist in the Spanish language; it was coined to refer to this movement, meaning something along the lines of &quot;that weird thing without a name&quot;).

La Cosiata started in April 1826 as a quasi-spontaneous movement (historical interpretations differ) of local politicians and figures supporting Páez. There was pressure in favor of Páez&#x27;s removal from his office by some locals in Venezuela; they accused him of abusing his authority in relation to implementing orders coming from Bogotá. Páez himself allegedly disagreed with these, which called for the forced recruitment of men for the army. The Congress in Bogotá, including several of the Venezuelans among it, received complaints coming from Venezuela. They alleged that Páez had not properly understood the extent of his orders and had exceeded them in his implementation. Congress decided that it alone could judge Páez for his actions, and ordered him to go to Bogotá for trial.

Páez was initially willing to go. But, some of the local figures who had complained of Paez&#x27;s actions now felt insulted that their leader was being forced to go to Bogotá to be tried. After a few days of uncertainty and tension in the streets, the municipality of Valencia broke with Bogotá and claimed Páez as military commander. In the following days, leaders of more municipalities followed suit, including Caracas (they had been among the first to accuse him of exceeding his orders.) Other municipalities and local officials did not join in this change of opinion.

In July, Santander declared Páez to be in open rebellion against the central government. While all this was happening, Páez wrote to Bolívar, asking him to come back to take charge and solve the imbroglio.

While Páez and his supporters were willing to have Bolívar as supreme leader, they were reluctant to follow Santander. While they wanted changes to be made to the constitution, they initially wanted to do it under Bolívar as part of the Gran Colombia.

Bolívar, finally returned from his campaigns in the south, took command of the executive towards the end of 1826. He assumed the extraordinary powers granted to him by the Congress. Conflicting letters between Santander and Bolívar, and Bolívar and Páez, created a degree of uncertainty as to what he would do. He finally declared a general amnesty to all those who were involved in La Cosiata. But, he put them on notice that from then on, any disobedience of his orders would be considered a crime against the state.

Páez welcomed Bolívar and accepted his authority, and Bolívar named him Supreme Civil and Military Commander of Venezuela. This action confused and disappointed both Santander in Bogotá and the few local officials in Venezuela who had not supported the La Cosiata. They were removed or transferred to other posts while those who had backed Páez remained or were promoted.

Until La Cosiata, Páez had been mostly respected as a result of his military successes during the war. From that time, he started to be seen as a politician with the power and the wit needed to pursue and defend any changes, or lack thereof, made under the constitutional order. Páez came out from La Cosiata with more power than he had before.

===President===

In 1830, Páez declared Venezuela independent from Gran Colombia and became president. Although he was not the first president of Venezuela (which declared its independence from Spain in 1811 and named Cristóbal Mendoza as president), he was the first head of government after the dissolution of Gran Colombia. From 1830 to 1847, Páez was the most powerful man in Venezuela. He served as president only twice during this time (1830–1835 and 1839–1842), but ruled as the power behind puppet presidents when he was not in office. The government, dominated by the oligarchy, followed a constitution that had largely been written by Páez in 1830. Páez and the conservative oligarchy were conveniently allied because the oligarchy controlled a great amount of the country&#x27;s wealth but was not popular with the masses, whereas Páez was very much liked by the masses.

Historians consider the period of the 1830s to the 1860s as a golden era in Venezuela&#x27;s history, in contrast to previous and future dictatorships. But, the constitution was supported by Páez, a military caudillo, and the rule by law was dependent on his personal prestige. Paez generally respected the law and was not interested in personal gain, as demonstrated by the common conditions in which he lived. Between 1830 and 1848 under the power of Páez and the oligarchy, the economic power of the church was broken and its dominance destroyed. From then on, the conflict between church and state ended, unlike in other countries in Latin America.
In 1842, Páez arranged to have the remains of Simón Bolívar repatriated from Santa Marta, Colombia, to the Liberator&#x27;s hometown of Caracas. His funeral procession was accompanied by exuberant honors before Bolivar&#x27;s remains were entombed in the Caracas Cathedral.

In 1847 President José Tadeo Monagas, who was put into power by Páez, dispersed the Congress and proclaimed himself dictator. Páez led a rebellion against him but was defeated by General Santiago Mariño in the &#x27;Battle of the Araguatos&#x27;, imprisoned, and eventually exiled.

Páez was exiled from the country in 1850 and did not return until 1858. In 1861, Páez returned to power as president and supreme dictator, but ruled for only two years before again returning to exile. During this period, Erastus D. Culver, an attorney and judge from New York, was appointed as American Minister to Venezuela in 1862. He presented himself to Páez, not realizing that the United States did not officially recognize the dictator. He and Culver established amicable relations nonetheless.

Páez lived in New York City during his years in exile. He returned in 1863 Boarding Pass, living there for another decade before his death in 1873.

== Personal life ==
Páez was married to Dominga Ortiz Orzúa, who served as First Lady of Venezuela from 1830 until 1835, and 1839 until 1843. She was First Lady again from 1861 until 1863. Páez suffered from epilepsy, even experiencing a seizure during the Battle of Carabobo in 1821. 


==The Paez Medal of Arts==

The Paez Medal of Arts is a condecoration awarded by The Venezuelan American Endowment for the Arts (VAEA) that is presented once a year to an individual or group that has had an impact and contributed to excellence, growth, support and the proliferation of the arts in Venezuela and the United States. It is named in honor of José Antonio Páez, leader of the Independence of Venezuela, who lived in exile the last years in New York, where he became a philanthropist.

<text>Frank Herbert Dedrick Pickersgill (May 28, 1915 – September 14, 1944) was a Canadian Special Operations Executive agent.

== Biography ==
Born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Pickersgill graduated from Kelvin High School in that city. Holding an English degree from the University of Manitoba and a Master&#x27;s degree in classics from the University of Toronto, Pickersgill set out to cycle across Europe in 1934, then returned to Europe in 1938 to work as a freelance journalist for several Canadian newspapers. During his travels he met Jean-Paul Sartre, whose work he hoped to translate into English, though the oncoming war distracted him from the project.

Pickersgill served the first two years of the war in Saint-Denis Internment Camp (Stalag 220) as an enemy alien. He escaped by sawing out a window with a hacksaw blade smuggled into the camp in a loaf of bread.

Once he was safely back in Britain, he rejected the offer of a desk job in Ottawa and instead received a commission in the newly created Canadian Intelligence Corps. Because he was fluent in German, Latin, Greek and especially French, he worked in close contact with the British Special Operations Executive (SOE). Along with a fellow Canadian, John Kenneth Macalister, he was parachuted into the Loire Valley in occupied France on June 15, 1943, to work with the French Resistance. Both men were picked up by the SOE agent Yvonne Rudellat (codename &#x27;Jacqueline&#x27;) and the French officer Pierre Culioli. Their vehicle stopped at a German checkpoint in Dhuizon, and after Rudellat and Culioli were cleared they decided to wait for the two Canadians to come through. Minutes later, however, the Canadians&#x27; cover was blown and Culioli tried to speed away but he and Rudellat were captured when they ran into another checkpoint about 10 kilometres away. Rudellat subsequently died in Bergen-Belsen; Culioli survived the war.

In March 1944, Pickersgill tried to escape from SD headquarters at 84 Avenue Foch. He attacked a guard with a bottle and threw himself out of a second-storey window. He was shot several times and recaptured. He was then interned with other agents in a camp at Ravitsch, 25 miles North of Breslau.

On August 27, 1944, he was shipped with members of the Robert Benoist group to Buchenwald concentration camp, where he was executed on September 14, along with 35 other SOE agents, including two other Canadians, Roméo Sabourin and John Kenneth Macalister. Though there are conflicting reports about their deaths, the men are thought to have been hung on meat hooks and strangled with piano wire. Their bodies were incinerated.

After the war, SOE&#x27;s Vera Atkins interviewed Josef Kiefer, former head of the German SD in Paris. Kiefer named Pickersgill as one of three SOE agents he knew who successfully resisted all German efforts to obtain information from them. Two other successful resistors he named were Noor Inayat Khan and France Antelme.

Posthumously, the government of France awarded Pickersgill the Legion of Honour, and he is listed as one of the SOE agents who died for the liberation of France on the &quot;Roll of Honour&quot; on the Valençay SOE Memorial in Valençay in the département of the Indre. He is commemorated by an obelisk at Romorantin-Lanthenay, where he is one of 4 members of SOE to be listed. He is also honoured on the Groesbeek Memorial in the Groesbeek Canadian War Cemetery in the Netherlands. The University of Toronto designated a Pickersgill-Macalister Garden on the west side of the &quot;Soldiers&#x27; Tower&quot; monument, but later the plot was rededicated &quot;in memory of those tho gave their lives for peace and freedom&quot;, though there is still a plaque saying that it was originally dedicated to Macalister and Pickersgill.

Frank Pickersgill was the younger brother of Jack Pickersgill, a member of the House of Commons of Canada and a Cabinet minister.

==Further reading==

* &quot;The Pickersgill Letters&quot;, written by Pickersgill during the period 1934-43, was published by George H. Ford in 1948. The book was republished in 1978 by McClelland &amp; Stewart in an expanded edition under the title &quot;The Making of a Secret Agent: Letters of 1934-1943&quot;.
** In 2004, two of his letters sent to his family from Central Europe in 1939 were published by Charlotte Gray in &quot;Canada: A Portrait in Letters&quot;.
* His story and that of Ken Macalister were retold in &quot;Unlikely Soldiers: How Two Canadians Fought the Secret War Against Nazi Occupation&quot;, by Jonathan Vance (HarperCollins, 2008). This book used material recently made available from SOE files to tell a more complete story of their endeavours than had previously been possible.

<doc id="351943" wikidata="Q7820221" url="?curid=351943" title="Tomorrow's World">
<text>Tomorrow&#x27;s World is a British television series about contemporary developments in science and technology. First transmitted on 7 July 1965 on BBC1, it ran for 38 years until it was cancelled at the beginning of 2003. The &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot; title was revived in 2017 as an umbrella brand for BBC science programming.

== Content ==
&quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot; was created by Glyn Jones to fill a half-hour slot in the 1965 BBC summer schedule. Jones and his wife conceived the show&#x27;s name the night before the &quot;Radio Times&quot; went to press. In its early days the show was edited by Max Morgan-Witts and hosted by veteran broadcaster and former Spitfire pilot Raymond Baxter. For some years it had an instrumental theme tune composed and performed by John Dankworth. During the 1970s the programme attracted 10 million viewers per week.

The programme was usually broadcast live, and as a result saw the occasional failure of its technology demonstrations. For example, during a demonstration of a new kind of car jack that required much less effort to operate, the jack disintegrated. Pressing on in the face of such adversity became a rite of passage, both for new presenters on the show and for the young assistant producers whose job it was to find the stories and make sure this kind of setback did not happen.

Sometimes, however, the liveness gave an added dimension of immediacy to the technology, such as inventors personally demonstrating flame-proof clothing and bullet-proof vests while the presenters looked on. Sometimes it was the presenter who acted as test dummy.

&quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot; also frequently ran exhibitions, called &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World Live&quot;, often based in Earls Court, London. These offered the general public the chance to see at first hand a variety of brand new, pioneering inventions, as well as a selection from that year&#x27;s show. The presenters, by this time Peter Snow and Philippa Forrester, also ran an hour-long interactive presentation within.

The show was also occasionally parodied, for example by &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;, which featured demonstrations of such inventions as a telephone ring notification device for the deaf – powered by a microprocessor looking like a &quot;Shreddie&quot;, and later by the second series of &quot;Look Around You&quot;.

== Presenters ==

Raymond Baxter, the show&#x27;s first presenter, was noted for pointing out features of the new inventions with military precision using his Parker pen (&quot;as you will see: here, here and here&quot;). He left the show in 1977 after a difference of opinion with new young editor Michael Blakstad, who allegedly referred to him in a press interview as &quot;the last of the dinosaurs&quot;.

Other presenters included:
*James Burke (1965–1971)
*Michael Rodd (1972–1982)
*Anthony Smith
*Lyall Watson
*William Woollard (1974–1978)
*Judith Hann (1974–1994—the longest-serving presenter)
*Anna Ford (1976–1978)
*Kieran Prendiville (1979–1983)
*Su Ingle (1980–1984)
*Peter Macann (1983–1991)
*Maggie Philbin (1983–1994)
*Anna Walker
*Howard Stableford (1985–1997)
*Kate Bellingham (1990–1994)
*John Diamond (1991)
*Carmen Pryce (1991–1994)
*Monty Don (1994–1995)
*Carol Vorderman (1994–1995)
*Vivienne Parry (1994–1996)
*Rebecca Stephens (1994–1996)
*Shahnaz Pakravan (1994–1997)
*Richard Mabey (1995)
*Craig Doyle (1996–1999)
*Philippa Forrester (1996–2000)
*Jez Nelson (1996–2000)
*Peter Snow (1997–2000)
*Anya Sitaram (1998–2000)
*Nick Baker (1999–2000)
*Lindsey Fallow (1999–2000)
*Sophie Raworth (1999–2000)
*Katie Knapman (2002)
*David Bull (2002–2003)
*Adam Hart-Davis (2002–2003)
*Roger Black (2003)
*Kate Humble (2003)
The idiosyncratic Bob Symes showcased smaller inventions in dramatised vignettes with themes such as &quot;Bob Goes Golfing&quot;. These often presented challenges for film directors with whom he worked when a close-up was required as Symes&#x27;s own invention-related exploits in the workshop had resulted in him losing parts of several fingers. It was hard to find a finger that did not look too gruesome to show on screen. Other regular features included &quot;Whatever Happened to ...&quot;, picking up on the oft-levelled criticism of the show that a significant number of inventions seemingly were never heard of again.

== Technologies introduced ==
In many cases the show offered the British public its first chance to see key technologies that subsequently became commonplace, notably:
* Breathalyser (1967)
* Home computer (1967)
* Light pens and touchscreens (1967)
* Artificial grass (1968)
* Synthesizer (1969)
* ATM and chip and pin (1969)
* Pocket calculator (1971)
* Digital watch (1972)
* Teletext (Ceefax) (1974)
* Mobile phone (1979)
* Personal stereo (1980)
* Compact disc and player (1981)
* Camcorder (1981)
* Barcode reader (1983)
* Wind-up radio (1993)
* Starlite insulation (1993)
* Robotic vacuum cleaner, pioneered on Electrolux Trilobite prototype (1996)
* Targeted intra-operative radiotherapy for breast cancer (2000)
Perhaps the best-remembered item in the programme&#x27;s history was the introduction of the compact disc in 1981, when presenter Kieran Prendiville demonstrated the disc&#x27;s supposed indestructibility by scratching the surface of a Bee Gees CD with a stone. The show also gave the first British TV exposure to the group Kraftwerk, who performed their then-forthcoming single &quot;Autobahn&quot; as part of an item about the use of technology in musicmaking. Another programme concerning new technology for television and stage lighting featured The Tremeloes and the Syd Barrett-led Pink Floyd.

=== Offbeat aspects ===
Featured inventions that did not change lives included a fold-up car that fitted into a suitcase, numerous gadgets such as a miracle chopping board for the kitchen, and collapsible knives and forks. Members of the public frequently sent in their ideas.

== Final years ==
By the late 1990s, the live studio demonstrations had been dropped in favour of purely pre-recorded items. The final series, presented by Adam Hart-Davis, Kate Humble and Roger Black, attempted to revert to the original live format of the show, even using a remix of one of the theme tunes used during its more successful years. However, ratings continued to fall and with only three million viewers the BBC decided to axe the show. At the time they said that they would produce a number of science special editions under the &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot; brand from time to time. The &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World Roadshow&quot; appeared in 2004, with Gareth Jones (co-host of CITV&#x27;s &quot;How 2&quot;) and Katie Knapman taking the helm as the last presenters of a show bearing the &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot; name, before a partial return to television in 2007.

For the 1000th episode, a commemorative CD was produced by Nimbus Records. It contained audio tracks of the four theme tunes that were used from 1965 to the early 1990s. 1,000 copies were made and given away in a competition. The CD was notable as being the first holographic audio compact disc ever made.

On 14 September 2009, the BBC made some clips and episodes available online.

In the United States, episodes of the series aired on the cable channel TechTV between 2001 and 2003.

===The Prince of Wales Award for Industrial Innovation and Production===
At the end of each series, the Prince of Wales gave an award or awards for superlative inventions.

=== Revival of the brand ===
At the start of 2007, the BBC announced that the &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot; brand would be used on science and technology news reports across the BBC&#x27;s TV, radio and internet services, including a blog. The &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot; name returned to television screens on 8 January 2007 as part of the BBC&#x27;s news coverage on BBC Breakfast, hosted by Maggie Philbin and as a blog on the BBC News website. In August 2007, it was reported that Michael Mosley, director of development at the BBC&#x27;s science wing, had pitched the concept of resurrecting the format to BBC commissioners.

In May 2017, the BBC announced it was launching a year of science and technology under the &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot; banner. Its purpose is to &quot;seek to address how science is changing peoples&#x27; lives, reshaping the world, and rewriting the future of healthcare&quot;.

=== BBC 4 live edition ===

&quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot; returned for a one-off live special, with Hannah Fry and four presenters from the show&#x27;s original run: Maggie Philbin, Howard Stableford, Judith Hann, and Peter Snow. The 90-minute interactive show was broadcast at 9pm on BBC 4 on 22 November 2018.

== Science Channel reboot ==
In May 2018, Science Channel premiered a new version of the show called &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World Today&quot;. The show explores sustainability, technology, new ideas and worldwide concepts around innovation. Julian Taylor serves as executive producer and the program features executive producer George Davison as host and field reporters Tamara Krinsky and Jackie Long.

<doc id="351945" wikidata="Q574390" url="?curid=351945" title="Anthropological Society of London">
<text>The Anthropological Society of London (ASL) was a short-lived organisation of the 1860s whose founders aimed to furnish scientific evidence for white supremacy which they construed in terms of polygenism. It was founded in 1863 by Richard Francis Burton and James Hunt. Hunt had previously been the secretary of the Ethnological Society of London, which was founded in 1843. When he founded the breakaway ASL, Hunt claimed that society had &quot;the object of promoting the study of Anthropology in a strictly scientific manner&quot;. Nevertheless he reminded his audience that, whatever evidence might be uncovered, &quot;we still know that the Races of Europe now have much in their mental and moral nature which the races of Africa have not got.&quot; The ASL only lasted 8 years: following Hunt&#x27;s death in 1869 it was absorbed into the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland.

==Prelude to the ASL==
James Hunt had encountered the disgraced Edinburgh anatomist, Robert Knox in 1855. During the trial of the grave robbers Burke and Hare, Knox had been exposed as the anatomist for whom they had procured their victims bodies. Despite attacks by hostile mobs, he continued as an anatomist despite never regaining such a steady source of dead bodies. He was debarred from running further teaching 
by the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh  after falsifying records and expelled from the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

==Polygenism versus monogenism==
The real differences between the two societies ran much deeper. The members of the Ethnological Society were, on the whole, inclined to believe that humans were shaped by their environment; when Charles Darwin published his theory of evolution by natural selection, they supported it. They also advocated in monogenism and tended to be politically liberal, especially on matters related to race.

Hunt and his closest followers tended to be supporters of polygenism and sceptical of Darwin (though they made him an honorary fellow). They found the Ethnological Society&#x27;s politics distasteful, and (for example) supported the Confederacy in the American Civil War. The issue that most sharply divided the two groups was the &quot;Negro question.&quot; In his opening speech to the society Hunt enunciated a strongly racist view:
Whatever may be the conclusion to which our scientific inquiries may lead us, we should always remember, that by whatever means the Negro, for instance, acquired his present physical, mental and moral character, whether he has risen from an ape or descended from a perfect man, we still know that the Races of Europe have now much in their mental and moral nature which the races of Africa have not got.

However he was careful to distance himself from the slave trade:
A serious charge has been made against the American School of Anthropology, when it is affirmed that their interest in keeping up slavery induced the scientific men of that country to advocate a distinct origin for the African race... I would therefore express a hope that the objects of this Society will never be prostituted to such an object as the support of the slave trade, with all its abuses.
He did this by redefining slavery in such a way that it did not occur in America:

Our Bristol and Liverpool merchants, perhaps, helped to benefit the race when they transplanted some of them to America; and our mistaken legislature has done the Negro race much injury by their absurd and unwarrantable attempts to prevent Africa from exporting her worthless or surplus population... I cannot shut my eyes to the fact that slavery as understood by the ancients does not exist out of Africa and that the highest type of the Negro race is at present to be found in the Confederate States of America.
According to noted Darwin biographers Adrian Desmond and James Moore, however, founder James Hunt was a paid agent of the Confederate States of America, as were his friend Henry Hotze and two other council members. Their purpose in founding the society was &quot;to swing London opinion during the [American Civil] war.&quot; Hunt and Hotze put pro-slavery pseudoscience into the Anthropological Society library, &quot;bought journalists, printed and distributed thousands of pamphlets... ran a propaganda weekly in Fleet Street, The Index...&quot; and in general promoted the pro-slavery dogma that black people were a separate species and inherently capable of no higher development than that of enslavement.

==Cannibal Club==

Hunt and Burton established the Cannibal Club as a gentleman&#x27;s club, which drew many members from within the ASL.

==Merger==
In 1864, Hunt attempted to persuade the British Association to rename Section E (Geography and Ethnology) to include Anthropology and in 1865 his attempt create a new Anthropology sub-section devoted to the study of man was strongly resisted by others. However with the support of T. H. Huxley it was created under Biology section D in 1866, and in 1869, Section E dropped the &quot;Ethnology&quot; part of its title.

At the same time, Hunt&#x27;s position was weakened by an allegation made by one of the members, Hyde Clarke, about the finances of the organisation. Although he managed to satisfy the other members and expel Clarke, the stress seriously affected his health.

A merger of the two organisations was already under way before Hunt died early at a young age in 1869, and in 1871 they formed the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland.

==Other organisations==
In 1863, Richard Burton and others founded a breakaway &quot;London Anthropological Society&quot; which for several years published a journal &quot;Anthropologia&quot;. Burton said &quot;My motive was to supply travellers with an organ that would rescue their observations from the outer darkness of manuscripts and print their curious information on social and sexual matters out of place in the popular book&quot;.

There was also an &quot;Anthropological Society of London&quot; founded in 1836 by John Isaac Hawkins which had more to do with phrenology.

<doc id="351949" wikidata="Q164348" url="?curid=351949" title="Hungarian Revolution of 1956">
<text>The Hungarian Revolution of 1956 (23 October – 4 November 1956; ), also known as the Hungarian Uprising, was an attempted countrywide revolution against the government of the Hungarian People&#x27;s Republic (1949–1989) and the policies caused by the government&#x27;s subordination to the Soviet Union (USSR). The uprising lasted 12 days before being crushed by Soviet tanks and troops on 4 November 1956. Thousands were killed or wounded, and nearly a quarter of a million Hungarians fled the country.

The Hungarian Revolution began on 23 October 1956 in Budapest when university students appealed to the civil populace to join them at the Hungarian Parliament Building to protest against the USSR&#x27;s geopolitical domination of Hungary through the Stalinist government of Mátyás Rákosi. A delegation of students entered the building of Magyar Rádió to broadcast their sixteen demands for political and economic reforms to civil society, but were detained by security guards. When the student protestors outside the radio building demanded the release of their delegation, a group of police from the ÁVH (State Protection Authority) fatally shot several of the students.

Consequently, Hungarians organized into revolutionary militias to fight against the ÁVH; local Hungarian communist leaders and ÁVH policemen were captured and summarily executed; and political prisoners were released and armed. To realize their political, economic, and social demands, local soviets (councils of workers) assumed control of municipal government from the Hungarian Working People&#x27;s Party (). The new government of Imre Nagy disbanded the ÁVH, declared Hungary&#x27;s withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact, and pledged to re-establish free elections. By the end of October the intense fighting had subsided.

Although initially willing to negotiate the withdrawal of the Soviet Army from Hungary, the USSR repressed the Hungarian Revolution on 4 November 1956, and fought the Hungarian revolutionaries until Soviet victory on 10 November; repression of the Hungarian Uprising killed 2,500 Hungarians and 700 Soviet Army soldiers, and compelled 200,000 Hungarians to seek political refuge abroad, mostly to Austria.

==Background==
===Second World War===
During the Second World War (1939–1945), the Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946) was a member of the Axis powers – in alliance with Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, the Kingdom of Romania, and the Kingdom of Bulgaria. In 1941, the Royal Hungarian Army participated in the Nazi invasion of Yugoslavia (6 April 1941) and in Operation Barbarossa (22 June 1941), the invasion of the USSR. In the event, by 1944, the Red Army were &quot;en route&quot; to the Kingdom of Hungary, after first having repelled the Royal Hungarian Army and the armies of the other Axis Powers from the territory of the USSR.

Fearful of the Red Army&#x27;s occupation of the Kingdom of Hungary, the royal Hungarian government unsuccessfully sought an armistice with the Allies, which was a betrayal of the Axis powers. The Germans launched Operation Margarethe (12 March 1944) to establish the Nazi Government of National Unity of Hungary; the short-lived puppet government existed for less than a year and Hungary was occupied by the Soviet Union in 1945 after the Siege of Budapest.

===Soviet occupation===

At the end of the Second World War (1939–1945), the Kingdom of Hungary was in the geopolitical sphere of influence of the USSR. In the political aftermath of the War, Hungary was a multiparty democracy, in which the 1945 Hungarian parliamentary election produced a coalition government composed of Independent Smallholders, Agrarian Workers and the Civic Party, headed by President Zoltán Tildy and Prime Minister Ferenc Nagy. Nonetheless, on behalf of the USSR, the Hungarian Communist Party continually used salami tactics to wrest minor political concessions, which continually diminished the political authority of the coalition government – despite the Communist Party only having received 17 percent of the votes in the parliamentary election of 1945.

After the election in 1945, control of the State Protection Authority (, ÁVH) was transferred from the Independent Smallholders Party of the coalition government to the Hungarian Communist party. The ÁVH repressed non­­‑communist political opponents with intimidation and false accusations, imprisonment and torture. The brief, four­­‑year period of multi-party democracy ended when the Hungarian Social Democratic Party merged with the Communist Party and became the Hungarian Working People&#x27;s Party, whose candidate stood unopposed in the 1949 Hungarian parliamentary election. Afterwards, on 20 August 1949, the Hungarian People&#x27;s Republic was proclaimed and established as a socialist state, with whom the USSR then concorded the COMECON treaty of mutual assistance, which allowed stationing troops of Red Army soldiers in Hungary.

Based upon the economic model of the USSR, the Hungarian Working People&#x27;s Party established the socialist economy of Hungary with the nationalization of the means of production and of the natural resources of the country. Moreover, by 1955, the relatively free politics of Hungary allowed intellectuals and journalists to freely criticise the social and economic policies of the Rákosi government. In that vein of relative political freedom, on 22 October 1956, students from the Budapest University of Technology and Economics had reestablished the MEFESZ Students&#x27; union, which the Rákosi government earlier had banned for their politically incorrect politics.

===Stalinist Hungary===
Initially, the Hungarian People&#x27;s Republic was a socialist state headed by the Communist government of Mátyás Rákosi (r. 1947–1956), a Stalinist who was beholden to the USSR. To ensure ideological compliance within his Stalinist government, Rákosi used the ÁVH to purge 7,000 politically dissident &quot;Titoists&quot; and &quot;Trotskyists&quot; from the Communist Party of Hungary, for being &quot;Western agents&quot; whose participation in the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939) interfered with Stalin&#x27;s long-term plans for world Communism. Among the Stalinist governments of the Eastern Bloc, the Rákosi government of the Hungarian People&#x27;s Republic was most repressive of political, sexual, and religious minorities.

In 1949, the Rákosi government arrested, tortured and convicted Cardinal József Mindszenty in a show trial for treason against Hungary, for collaboration with Nazi Germany in the Holocaust in Hungary – the religious persecution of Hungarian Jews, and the political persecutions of Hungarian communists and of Hungarian anti-Nazis. Mindszenty had, in fact, been an active opponent of the Nazi government, encouraged Hungarian Catholics not to vote for the Arrow Cross Party, and was imprisoned for this dissent by the Arrow Cross-led Government of National Unity.

====Political repression====
In the 1950–1952 period, the ÁVH forcibly relocated more than 26,000 non-communist Hungarians and confiscated their housing for members of the Communist Party of Hungary, and so eliminated the political threats posed by the nationalist and anti-communist intelligentsia and by the local bourgeoisie. According to their particular politics, anti-communist Hungarians were either imprisoned in concentration camps or were deported to the USSR or were killed, either summarily or after a show trial; the victims included the communist politician László Rajk, the minister of the interior who established the ÁVH secret police.

The Rákosi government politicised the education system with a &quot;toiling intelligentsia&quot; who would assist in the Russification of Hungary; thus the study of Russian language and communist political instruction were mandatory at school and at university; religious schools were nationalized and church leaders replaced with communist officials.

====Economic decline====
In the early 1950s, the Rákosi government&#x27;s socialist economics increased the per capita income of the Hungarian people, yet their standard of living diminished because of the compulsory financial contributions towards the industrialisation of Hungary, which reduced the disposable and discretionary income of individual Hungarian workers. That poor economy was further diminished by the bureaucratic mismanagement of resources, which caused shortages of supplies, and the consequent rationing of bread and sugar, flour and meat, et cetera. The net result of those economic conditions, was that the Hungarian workers&#x27; disposable income in 1952 was two-thirds of the disposable income of Hungarian workers in 1938.

Besides paying for the Red Army occupation of socialist Hungary, the Hungarians also paid war reparations (US$300 million) to the USSR, to the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, and to the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In 1946, the Hungarian National Bank reported that the cost of war reparations was &quot;between 19 and 22 per cent of the annual national income&quot; of Hungary, an onerous national expense aggravated by the hyperinflation consequent to the post-war depreciation of the Hungarian pengő. Moreover, participation in the Soviet-sponsored Council of Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON) prevented direct trade with the countries of the West, and also prevented the Hungarian People&#x27;s Republic from receiving American financial aid through the Marshall Plan (1948). Socially, the imposition of Soviet-style economic policies and the payment of war reparations angered the peoples of Hungary, whilst the cumulative effects of economic austerity fuelled anti-Soviet political discontent as the payment of foreign debt took precedence over the material needs of the Hungarian people.

===International events===

====De–Stalinization====
On 5 March 1953, the death of Stalin allowed the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) to proceed with the de-Stalinization of the USSR, which was a relative liberalization of politics that afterward allowed most European communist parties and the communist parties of the Warsaw Pact to develop a reformist wing – within the structures of the Philosophy of Marxism and orders from Moscow. Hence, the reformist communist Imre Nagy became prime minister (1953–55) of the Hungarian People&#x27;s Republic, in replacement of the Stalinist Mátyás Rákosi (1946–56), whose heavy-hand style of communist government had proved counter-productive to the interests of the USSR in Hungary.

Despite not being prime minister of Hungary, Rákosi remained politically powerful as the General Secretary of the Hungarian Communist Party, and so undermined many of the Nagy government&#x27;s political and socio-economic reforms; by 18 April 1955, Rákosi had so discredited Nagy that the USSR deposed Nagy as head-of-state of Socialist Hungary. Three months of plotting and conspiring rid Rákosi and the Hungarian Communist Party of Imre Nagy, who was reduced to a political non-person. On 14 April Prime Minister Imre Nagy was stripped of his Hungarian Communist Party offices and functions and was sacked as prime minister on 18 April. Despite having been out of political favor with the USSR since January 1955, Nagy had refused to perform the requisite communist penance of &#x27;self-criticism&#x27;, and refused to resign as PM of Hungary.

In February 1956, as the First Secretary of the CPSU, Nikita Khrushchev initiated the de-Stalinization of the USSR with the speech &quot;On the Personality Cult and its Consequences&quot;, which catalogued and denounced the abuses of power committed by Stalin and his inner-circle protégés, in Russia and abroad. Therefore, the de-Stalinization of Hungarian People&#x27;s Republic featured Rákosi&#x27;s dismissal as General Secretary of the Communist Party of Hungary, and his replacement by Ernő Gerő, on 18 July 1956.

From the Western perspective, the countries of western Europe co-operated with the CIA&#x27;s propaganda radio network, Radio Free Europe, to broadcast the speech &quot;On the Personality Cult and its Consequences&quot; to the countries of eastern Europe, expecting that, as Secretary of the CPSU, Khrushchev&#x27;s anti–Stalinist speech would substantively contribute to the destabilisation of the internal politics of the Warsaw Pact countries.

====Warsaw Pact established====
On 14 May 1955, with the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance, the USSR established the Warsaw Pact with seven countries of the Eastern Bloc, including the Hungarian People&#x27;s Republic. The geopolitical principles of the Warsaw Pact defence treaty included &quot;respect for the independence and [the] sovereignty of [the member] states&quot; and the practise of &quot;non-interference in their internal affairs&quot;. Then, on 15 May 1955, a day after the USSR established the Warsaw Pact, the Austrian State Treaty established Austria as a neutral country in the geopolitical cold war between the US and the USSR. Austria&#x27;s declaration of geopolitical neutrality allowed the Communist government of PM Nagy to publicly consider &quot;the possibility of Hungary adopting a neutral status on the Austrian pattern&quot;.

In June 1956, the Polish Army violently repressed the workers&#x27; uprising at Poznań against the economic policies of the Polish People&#x27;s Republic. In October, the Polish government appointed the politically rehabilitated, reform communist Władysław Gomułka as First Secretary of the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party to deal with the USSR, and, by 19 October 1956, Gomułka had successfully negotiated greater trade agreements and fewer Red Army troops stationed in Poland. The USSR&#x27;s concessions to Poland – known as the Polish October – emboldened Hungarians to demand from the USSR like concessions for the Hungarian People&#x27;s Republic, which much contributed to the Hungarians&#x27; greatly idealistic politics in October 1956.

==Uprising and Revolution==
===Political discontent===
On 13 October 1956, a group of 12 students from the university faculties in Szeged met to play cards, and snubbed the DISZ, the official communist student union, by re-establishing the MEFESZ (Union of Hungarian University and Academy Students), the democratic student union banned by the Stalinist Rákosi government. The MEFESZ students distributed hand-written notes in classrooms to inform faculty and students of the time and place for the meeting on 16 October 1956. A professor of law was chairman of committee who formally reestablished the MEFESZ student union, with the proclamation and publication of a twenty-demand manifesto, ten demands about the MEFESZ, and ten anti-Soviet demands, e.g. free elections and the departure of Soviet troops from Hungary, etc.; days later, the university students at Pécs, Miskolc, and Sopron followed suit.

On 22 October, at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics, one of the law students from the original group of twelve students, announced that the MEFESZ student union was again politically active, and then proclaimed the Sixteen Political, Economic, and Ideological Points against the USSR&#x27;s geopolitical hegemony upon Hungary. The Hungarian Writers&#x27; Union ceremoniously proclaimed Hungary&#x27;s anti-Soviet political solidarity with anti-communist reformers in Poland when they laid a commemorative wreath at the statue of the Polish hero Gen. Józef Zachariasz Bem who also was a hero of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848; likewise, the MEFESZ student union held a parallel demonstration of Hungarians&#x27; political solidarity with the Poles.

===Initiating gunfire===
In the afternoon of 23 October 1956, approximately 20,000 protestors met beside the statue of General József Bem, a national hero of Poland and Hungary. To the amassed crowd of protestors, the intellectual Péter Veres, the president of the Writers&#x27; Union (&quot;Írószövetség&quot;), read a manifesto demanding Hungarian independence from all foreign powers; a democratic socialist political system based upon land reform and (public) state ownership in the economy; Hungarian membership to the United Nations; and all freedoms and rights for the citizens of Hungary. After Veres proclaimed the manifesto demanding Hungarian sovereignty, the crowd chanted the Hungarian patriotic poem National Song (&quot;Nemzeti dal&quot;), which the Soviet-controlled Rákosi government of Hungary had banned from public performance; the crowd repeatedly chanted the refrain: &quot;This we swear, this we swear, that we will no longer be slaves.&quot;

At 20:00, the first secretary of the Hungarian Working People&#x27;s Party, Ernő Gerő broadcast a hardline speech condemning the political demands of the intelligentsia and of the university students. Angered by Gerő&#x27;s rejection, some protestors realised one of their demands, and demolished the Stalin Monument in Budapest, which had been erected in place of a razed church, in 1951; and, by 21:30 hrs – an hour and a half later – the nationalist and anti-communist protestors had destroyed the eight-metre-tall statue of Josef Stalin.

Also at 20:00, a crowd of nationalist and anti-communist protestors had gathered outside the Magyar Rádió building, which was guarded by the ÁVH secret police. Violence soon occurred between the sides when the protestors heard rumours of the arrest and detainment of a delegation of students who had entered the radio station in effort to broadcast their political demands to the entire country. The situation escalated after protestors heard rumours that the ÁVH had killed their delegation of comrades sent to broadcast the anti–Soviet message. In response, from the windows of the building, the ÁVH threw tear gas grenades at and fired upon the many anti-communist and nationalist protestors assembled outside the Magyar Rádió building, and soon required resupply and reinforcement.

In suppressing the Hungarians&#x27; anti-government protestations, the ÁVH smuggled weapons and ammunition in an ambulance for delivery to them at the Magyar Rádió building, but the protestors hijacked the ambulance and the weapons for themselves. The Hungarian Army sent soldiers to support the ÁVH policemen defending the Magyar Rádió building, but some of the soldiers tore off the red-star insignia on their caps and joined the side of the anti-government protestors. ÁVH policemen used guns and tear gas, while the protestors set police cars afire and distributed weapons captured from the military and police forces, and acted on their anti–Soviet politics by destroying the symbols of Russian communism in Hungary.

===Deposing the communist government===
On 23 October, Gerő asked for the USSR&#x27;s military intervention in order &quot;to suppress a demonstration that was reaching an ever-greater and unprecedented scale&quot;, which threatens the national security of the Hungarian People&#x27;s Republic. To that end, the USSR already had planned the invasion and occupation of Hungary, and the political purging of Hungarian society. At 02:00 on 24 October 1956, Soviet defence minister Georgy Zhukov ordered the Red Army to occupy Budapest – the capital city of a Warsaw Pact country.

By 12:00 on 24 October, Red Army tanks were stationed outside the parliament building, and Red Army soldiers held the bridges and crossroads that controlled access to Budapest, while Hungarian revolutionaries barricaded streets to defend their city from the Red Army. Also on that day, Imre Nagy became prime minister in place of András Hegedüs. In a national radio broadcast, Nagy asked a ceasefire between the Red Army and the Hungarian Revolutionaries, and agreed to initiate postponed political reforms decided in 1953. Despite the pleas of Nagy, groups of revolutionaries in Budapest armed themselves and continually fought the Red Army.

At the offices of the communist newspaper &quot;Szabad Nép&quot;, the ÁVH guards fired upon unarmed protestors; in turn, anti-communists attacked and drove out the ÁVH policemen from the newspaper building. The Hungarian revolutionaries then avenged themselves against the ÁVH policemen. On 25 October, a crowd gathered in Kossuth Square in front of the Hungarian parliament building, which was a mixed group of civilian demonstrators including women, children, and elderly. Most of them came from the mass demonstration outside the Astoria, accompanied by three Soviet tanks, which the demonstrators climbed on, fraternising with the crews. At the same time a column of Soviet tanks carrying two delegates of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) sent to Hungary, Politburo members Anastas Mikoyan and Mikhail Suslov, as well as KGB Chairman Ivan Serov and Mikhail Malinin, commander-in-chief of the Soviet forces in Hungary were on their way to the headquarters of the Hungarian Workers&#x27; Party (MDP) on Akadémia Street, where they were to attend a meeting of the Central Executive Committee (CEC), which was to begin at 10:00. Under pressure from the Soviet delegates, the CEC relieved Ernő Gerő of his position as party leader and elected János Kádár in his place. Meanwhile, the crowd demonstrating at Kossuth Square elected a delegation to deliver their demands in the Parliament, but government guards and a company of the Ministry of Defence&#x27;s armoured regiment, backed by seven Soviet T-54 tanks lined up in front of the Parliament, kept the demonstrators away from the building. The events at Astoria were repeated, with demonstrators trying to make friends with the Soviet soldiers, handing out bilingual leaflets and some climbing on top of the guard tanks. At a few minutes after 11:00, General Serov decided to inspect the situation on Kossuth Square, accompanied by several Soviet and Hungarian officers and a tank. Seeing several Soviet soldiers fraternising with the demonstrators, Serov ordered the firing of warning shots, which caused a mass panic on the square. In the ensuing confusion, the Soviet tanks lined up in front of the Parliament building responded by targeting the buildings on the other side of the square. Another Soviet tank coming from a nearby street fired aimed shots at the demonstrators trying to take cover. This action claimed the most lives. The number of the dead is still disputed, with estimates ranging from 75 to 1000.

According to another version of the events, which already appeared during the revolution but still unproven, the ÁVH policemen and/or communist partisans fired into the assembled protestors from the roof of the building of the Agricultural Ministry. In the fog of war, some Red Army soldiers mistakenly returned the fire towards the roof, having mistakenly believed themselves the targets. The Hungarian revolutionaries armed themselves with weapons captured from ÁVH policemen and with weapons donated by anti-communist soldiers who had deserted the Hungarian Army for the Hungarian Revolution against the USSR; from amongst the crowd outside the parliament, the armed revolutionaries shot at the roof-top ÁVH policemen.

Meanwhile, nationalist and anti-communist loyalties had fractured the chain of command of the Hungarian Army in response to the communist government&#x27;s order to militarily repress the popular demonstrations against the Soviet control of Hungary. The Hungarian Army units in Budapest and in the countryside remained uninvolved in the Revolution, because local commanders avoided politics in order to avoid repressing the revolutionaries. Order was restored in the 24–29 October period after the Hungarian Army had fought 71 firefights with the nationalist and with the anti-communist revolutionaries in 50 communities. On 26 October, in the town of Kecskemét, outside the office of State Security and the local jail, Hungarian Army&#x27;s Third Corps, led by Major General Lajos Gyurkó, shot seven anti-communist protestors and arrested the organizers of the anti-Soviet protest. On Gyurkó&#x27;s order Hungarian Air Force fighter planes shot up demonstrators with cannon fire in various towns (see :hu:Tiszakécskei sortűz), earning the praise of János Kádár after the defeat of the &quot;counter-revolution&quot; as &quot;the only division commander who, at the call of the party organisation, swept the Danube-Tisza Interfluve six times, smashing everything&quot;.

As Hungarian revolutionaries fought the soldiers and tanks of the Red Army with small arms and Molotov cocktails in the streets of Budapest, throughout Hungary, revolutionary workers&#x27; councils assumed government power and called general strikes to halt the economy and the functioning of civil society. In ridding Hungary of the influence of and control from the USSR, the revolutionaries destroyed the symbols of Communism, such as the red star and Red Army monuments, and burned communist literature. Moreover, Revolutionary militias, such as the 400-man militia led by József Dudás attacked and murdered pro-Soviet Hungarians and ÁVH policemen. The Hungarian Army armoured division stationed in Budapest, commanded by Pál Maléter led the Hungarian Revolution against the USSR&#x27;s control of Hungary, and negotiated ceasefire agreements with the revolutionaries; nonetheless, the Hungarian Revolution took many communist prisoners who were registered to lists that identified the prisoner either for summary execution or as an enemy of the people.
In the Csepel area of Budapest, 250 communists defended the Csepel Iron and Steel Works, and, on 27 October, the Hungarian Army restored order in Csepel; two days later, the Hungarian Revolutionaries recaptured Csepel after the Hungarian Army&#x27;s withdrawal on 29 October. In the Angyalföld area of Budapest, the communists and 350 armed workers and 380 communist soldiers defended the Láng factory. Anti-fascist Hungarian veterans of the Second World War participated in recapturing the offices of the &quot;Szabad Nép&quot; communist newspaper. At the town of Szarvas, armed guards defended the Hungarian Communist Party and the communist government of Hungary. In the event, the Revolutionaries&#x27; successful attacks upon the Parliament collapsed the communist government of Hungary; and Gerő and ex-PM András Hegedüs fled Hungary to the USSR; Nagy became prime minister, and János Kádár became the first secretary of the Hungarian Communist Party.

The Nagy government freed the political prisoner General Béla Király to restore order to Hungary with a National Guard force composed of policemen, soldiers, and Revolutionaries loyal to Hungary. On 30 October 1956, Király&#x27;s National Guard attacked the building of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Communist Party and killed every pro-Soviet officer of the Hungarian Communist Party, ÁVH policeman, and pro-Soviet Hungarian soldier they encountered; and most Red Army troops withdrew from Budapest to garrisons in the Hungarian countryside.

===Interlude===
Fighting ceased between 28 October and 4 November, as many Hungarians believed that Soviet military units were withdrawing from Hungary. According to post-revolution communist sources, there were approximately 213 Hungarian Working People&#x27;s Party members executed during the period.

====New government====
The new Nagy government was surprised by the rapidity with which the Hungarian Revolution extended from the streets of Budapest to all of Hungary, and the consequent collapse of the old Gerő–Hegedüs communist government. As head of government, Nagy asked every Hungarian to exercise political forbearance in order to restore civil order to Hungary. As the only Communist Hungarian leader with political credibility among Hungarians, the political actions of the Nagy government allowed the USSR to view the Hungarians&#x27; anti-Soviet protests as a popular uprising, rather than as an anti-communist counter-revolution. On 28 October 1956, the Nagy government announced the ceasefire among the nationalist, the anti-communist, and the Communist Hungarians, and that, to resolve the national crisis, Nagy would:

* consider the revolt as a &quot;great, national and democratic event&quot;, and not an anti-communist counter-revolution
* effect an unconditional ceasefire and grant political amnesty for the revolutionaries
* negotiate with the revolutionaries
* disband the ÁVH security police
* establish a national guard for Hungary
* arrange the immediate withdrawal of the Red Army from Budapest and from Hungary 

On 1 November, the Nagy government formally declared Hungary&#x27;s withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact and Hungary&#x27;s international status as a politically non-aligned country. Because of being in power for only ten days, the National Government did not explain their policies in detail; however, contemporary newspaper editorials stressed that Hungary should be a multiparty social democracy uninvolved in the Russo–American Cold War. About 8,000 political prisoners were released, most notably Cardinal József Mindszenty. Banned political parties, such as the Independent Smallholders and the National Peasant Party (&quot;Petőfi Party&quot;), reappeared to join the coalition.

In 1,170 communities in Hungary, there were 348 cases of revolutionary councils dismissing the local administrators; 312 cases of revolutionary councils sacking the bosses; and 215 cases of the locals burning the communist administrative records of their communities. In 681 communities, anti-communist and nationalist Hungarians damaged and destroyed symbols of the hegemony of the USSR, such as the Red Star, and statues of Stalin and of Lenin; 393 communities damaged Soviet war memorials; and 122 communities burned the books of Marx, Lenin, and Stalin.

Local revolutionary councils formed throughout Hungary, generally without involvement from the preoccupied National Government in Budapest, and assumed various responsibilities of local government from the defunct Communist party. By , the councils had been officially sanctioned by the Hungarian Working People&#x27;s Party, and the Nagy government asked for their support as &quot;autonomous, democratic local organs formed during the Revolution&quot;. Likewise, workers&#x27; councils were established at industrial plants and mines, and many unpopular regulations such as production norms were eliminated. The workers&#x27; councils strove to manage the enterprise while protecting workers&#x27; interests, establishing a socialist economy free of rigid party control. Local control by the councils was not always bloodless; in Debrecen, Győr, Sopron, Mosonmagyaróvár and other cities, crowds of demonstrators were fired upon by the ÁVH, with many lives lost. The ÁVH were disarmed, often by force, in many cases assisted by the local police.

In total, there were approximately 2,100 local revolutionary and workers councils with over 28,000 members. The councils held a combined conference in Budapest that decided to end the nationwide labour strikes and to resume work on 5 November, with the more important councils sending delegates to the Parliament to assure the Nagy government of their support.

====Soviet perspective====
On 24 October 1956, the Politburo of the USSR discussed how to resolve the political revolts that had occurred in Warsaw Pact countries, specifically the Polish October and the Hungarian Revolt. Led by Vyacheslav Molotov, the hardline faction of the CPSU voted for military intervention, but were opposed by Khrushchev and Marshal Georgy Zhukov who sought a political resolution to the Hungarian revolt. In Budapest, the Soviet delegation reported to Moscow that the Hungarian political situation was less confrontational than reported during the revolt proper. In pursuit of political resolution, Khrushchev said that Gerő&#x27;s 23 October request for Soviet intervention indicated that the Hungarian Communist Party retained the confidence of the Hungarian people, because the Hungarians were protesting unresolved socio-economic problems, not ideology. Meanwhile, in the West, the concurrent Suez Crisis (29 October – 7 November 1956) of the French and the British empires&#x27; seizure of the Suez Canal from Egypt voided the political possibility of Western military intervention to Hungary. On 28 October, Khrushchev said that Soviet military intervention to Hungary would be a mistaken imitation of the Anglo–French intervention to Egypt.

In Russia, on 30 October 1956, the Presidium of the CPSU decided to not depose the new Hungarian government. Zhukov said: &quot;We should withdraw troops from Budapest, and, if necessary, withdraw from Hungary, as a whole. This is a lesson for us in the military-political sphere&quot;. The Presidium then adopted and published the &quot;Declaration of the Government of the USSR on the Principles of Development and Further Strengthening of Friendship and Cooperation between the Soviet Union and other Socialist States&quot;, which said that &quot;The Soviet Government is prepared to enter into the appropriate negotiations with the government of the Hungarian People&#x27;s Republic, and [with] other members of the Warsaw Treaty, on the question of the presence of Soviet troops in the territory of Hungary.&quot;


In Hungary, on 30 October, consequent to hearing rumours of that the secret police had anti-communist prisoners, and rumours of the ÁVH shooting anti-communist demonstrators in the city of Mosonmagyaróvár armed protestors attacked the ÁVH detachment guarding the headquarters building of the Hungarian Working People&#x27;s Party in Köztársaság tér (Republic Square), in Budapest. The anti-communists killed more than 20 ÁVH officers and ÁVH conscripts; the head of the Budapest party committee, Imre Mező, also was killed. Within hours, news reportage and filmed scenes of the Hungarian anti-communist revolt that occurred in Republic Square were broadcast in the USSR; and the CPSU made propaganda of the images of the communist victims of the Hungarian Revolt. The leaders of the Hungarian Revolution condemned the attack upon the ÁVH headquarters and asked the protestors to cease and desist from mob violence.

On 30 October, at Budapest, Anastas Mikoyan and Mikhail Suslov spoke with Nagy who told them that Hungarian geopolitical neutrality was a long-term political objective for the Hungarian People&#x27;s Republic, which he wanted to discuss with the presidium of the CPSU. Khrushchev considered the geopolitical options for the USSR&#x27;s resolving the Hungarian anti-communist revolution, but Nagy&#x27;s declaration of Hungarian neutrality decided his dispatching the Red Army into Hungary. The USSR invaded the Hungarian People&#x27;s Republic, because:

* Simultaneous political movements towards multi-party, parliamentary democracy, and a democratic national council of workers might &quot;lead towards a capitalist state&quot; in Hungary and Poland, each movement challenged the authority of communist parties in eastern Europe.
* The militarists in the CPSU would not understand the USSR&#x27;s failure to intervene in Hungary. That de-Stalinisation had alienated the hardline members of the CPSU, for whom anti-communist protests threatened Soviet hegemony in eastern Europe. That the workers&#x27; uprising in East Germany (17 June 1953) – the repression of which killed 84 protestors and produced 700 anti-communist prisoners – required a new Communist government for the German Democratic Republic. That the workers&#x27; protests at Poznań (June 1956) – the repression of which killed 57–78 anti-communist protestors – created the Polish October movement, which installed a Polish Communist government less dependent on orders from Moscow.
* Hungarian geopolitical neutrality and withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact breached the buffer zone of satellite states by which the USSR protected themselves from invasion.

In the People&#x27;s Republic of Hungary, the anti-communist militants concluded that &quot;the [Hungarian Communist] Party is the incarnation of bureaucratic despotism&quot; and that &quot;socialism can develop only on the foundations of direct democracy.&quot; For the anti-communists, the struggle of the Hungarian workers was &quot;for the principle of direct democracy&quot; and that &quot;all power should be transferred to the Workers Committees of Hungary.&quot; In response, the Presidium broke the &quot;de facto&quot; ceasefire and repressed the Hungarian Revolution. The Soviet Union&#x27;s plan was to declare a &quot;Provisional Revolutionary Government&quot; led by János Kádár, who would appeal for Soviet assistance to restore order to Hungary. Kádár was in Moscow in early November, and was in communication with the Soviet embassy whilst still a member of the Nagy government. The USSR sent diplomatic delegations to other communist governments in Eastern Europe and to the People&#x27;s Republic of China in effort to avoid misunderstandings that might provoke to regional conflicts, and broadcast propaganda explaining their second Soviet intervention to Hungary. The Soviet diplomats disguised their intentions by engaging the Nagy government in talks about withdrawing the Red Army from Hungary.

Moreover, Mao Zedong influenced Khrushchev&#x27;s decision to repress the Hungarian uprising. The deputy chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, Liu Shaoqi, pressed Khrushchev to militarily repress the Hungarian Revolution. Although Sino–Soviet relations were unstable, the opinion of Mao carried great weight among the members of the Presidium of the CPSU. Initially, Mao opposed a second intervention, which was communicated to Khrushchev on 30 October, before the Presidium met and decided against a Hungarian intervention; later, Mao changed his mind and supported intervention to Hungary.

In the 1–3 November 1956 period, Khrushchev informed the USSR&#x27;s Warsaw Pact allies of his decision to repress the Hungarian Revolution. Khrushchev met with the Polish communist politician Władysław Gomułka in Brest, Belarus; and then spoke with the Romanian, Czechoslovak, and Bulgarian leaders in Bucharest, Romania. Finally, Khrushchev went to the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and spoke with Tito who persuaded Khrushchev to install Kádár as the new leader of the People&#x27;s Republic of Hungary, instead of Ferenc Münnich. Two months after the USSR repressed the Hungarian Revolution, Tito told Nikolai Firiubin, the Soviet ambassador to Yugoslavia, that &quot;[political] reaction raised its head, especially in Croatia, where the reactionary elements openly incited the employees of the Yugoslav security organs to violence.&quot;

==== Polish response ====
The events in Hungary were met with a spontaneous reaction in Poland. Hungarian flags were displayed in many Polish towns and villages. After the Soviet invasion, the help given by the ordinary Poles to Hungarians took on a considerable scale. Citizen organizations and self-acting aid committees were established throughout Poland to distribute aid to the Hungarian population, e.g. the Social Civic Committee of Creative Associations (Bydgoszcz), the Student Committee for Aid to Hungarians (Kraków), the Society of Friends of Hungarians (Tarnów), the Committee to Aid the Hungarians (Lublin), and the Committee for Aid to Hungarians (Człuchów). In addition to the official support coordinated by the Polish Red Cross, one convoy was dispatched – one organized by the Student Aid Committee for Hungarians from Kraków. Other such initiatives were prevented.

By 12 November, over 11,000 honorary blood donors had registered throughout Poland. Polish Red Cross statistics show that by air transport alone (15 aircraft), 44 tonnes of medication, blood, and other medical supplies were delivered to Hungary. Assistance sent using road and rail transport was much higher. Polish aid is estimated at a value of approximately US$2 million in 1956 dollars.

====International perspective====
On 24 October 1956, U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles (r. 1953–1959) recommended that the United Nations Security Council convene to discuss the USSR&#x27;s invasion and occupation of the Hungarian People&#x27;s Republic, without decisive result, because, despite the Protocol of Sèvres (22–24 October 1956), the Suez Crisis prevented the West from criticizing the imperialism of the USSR; the U.S. vice president Richard Nixon said that: &quot;We couldn&#x27;t, on one hand, complain about the Soviets intervening in Hungary, and, on the other hand, approve of the British and the French picking that particular time to intervene against [Gamal Abdel] Nasser.&quot; Despite earlier demands for the rollback of communism and of the leftist liberation of eastern Europe, Dulles told the USSR that: &quot;We do not see these states [Hungary and Poland] as potential military allies.&quot;

On 4 November 1956, the USSR vetoed the Security Council&#x27;s resolution criticising the USSR&#x27;s invasion of Hungary. In its stead, United Nations Security Council Resolution 120 was passed, which charged the General Assembly to meet to discuss the matter. Despite 50 votes for withdrawal, 8 votes against withdrawal, and 15 abstentions from the matter, the communist Kádár government of Hungary rejected the presence of UN observers in the Hungarian People&#x27;s Republic.

In the U.S., two facts determined the inaction of the Eisenhower government: (i) the U.S. Army study, &quot;Hungary, Resistance Activities and Potentials&quot; (January 1956), which recommended against U.S. military intervention to Hungary on the side of the Hungarian revolutionists; and (ii) the secret warfare of the National Security Council that encouraged anti-communist political discontent in the Eastern Bloc only through psychological warfare, sabotage, and economic warfare.

According to A. Ross Johnson in the &quot;International Journal of Intelligence and CounterIntelligence&quot;: &quot;Contrary to allegations that continue to this day, RFE Hungarian broadcasts did not foment revolution, urge Hungarians to fight the Soviets, or promise Western assistance. They did criticize would-be reform leader Imre Nagy in personally vituperative terms and contained emotional bombast that Hungarian listeners could easily have interpreted as indicating Western solidarity and support.&quot; After the USSR defeated the anti-communist Hungarian Revolution, the revolutionists criticised the CIA and its RFE network for having deceived the Hungarians into believing that the West—NATO and the US—would expel the USSR from the Hungarian People&#x27;s Republic. Although incitements to violence were officially against RFE policy, an internal analysis by RFE adviser William Griffith found, as summarized by the National Security Archive at George Washington University, that &quot;RFE broadcasts in several cases had implied that foreign aid would be forthcoming if the Hungarians succeeded in establishing a &#x27;central military command&#x27;&quot; and &quot;appealed to the Hungarians to &#x27;continue to fight vigorously&#x27;&quot;. Griffith himself wrote that &quot;There were relatively few real policy violations&quot;—specifically four out of more than 300 broadcasts under review—but conceded that &quot;summaries often failed to reflect the content of the program as it was finally written (this is not the case only with programs where policy violation occurred; the summaries during the period under review in many other cases proved to be very inaccurate descriptions of the programs finally produced).&quot; László Borhi, writing in the &quot;Journal of Cold War Studies&quot;, states that the RFE broadcasts sanctioned by CIA official Cord Meyer were often &quot;incautious, even reckless&quot; and undermined parallel efforts by the Eisenhower administration to negotiate Hungarian independence in a framework similar to Finlandization: &quot;These contradictory policies sabotaged the overall approach. The harder the insurgents fought, the less chance there was for a negotiated settlement. But the unwillingness of the United States to counter Soviet military action meant that the Hungarian quest for liberation was suicidal.&quot;

In 1998, the Hungarian ambassador Géza Jeszenszky criticised Western inaction in 1956 as disingenuous, recalling that the political influence of the United Nations readily applied to resolving the Korean War (1950–1953). Moreover, the study &quot;Hungary, 1956: Reviving the Debate over U.S. (In)action During the Revolution&quot; confirms that the Eisenhower government did not intervene to the Hungarian Revolution – which occurred in the Soviet sphere of influence – because the USSR would have responded with a nuclear war.

== Soviet invasion ==
On 1 November, Nagy received reports that Soviet forces had entered Hungary from the east and were moving towards Budapest. Nagy sought and received assurances, which proved to be false, from Soviet Ambassador Yuri Andropov that the Soviet Union would not invade. The Cabinet, with Kádár in agreement, declared Hungary&#x27;s neutrality, withdrew from the Warsaw Pact and requested assistance from the diplomatic corps in Budapest and Dag Hammarskjöld, UN Secretary-General, to defend Hungary&#x27;s neutrality. Andropov was asked to inform his government that Hungary would begin negotiations on the removal of Soviet forces immediately.

On 3 November, a Hungarian delegation led by Defence Minister Pál Maléter was invited to attend negotiations on Soviet withdrawal at the Soviet Military Command at Tököl, near Budapest. At around midnight that evening, General Ivan Serov, Chief of the Soviet Security Police (KGB) ordered the arrest of the Hungarian delegation, and the next day, the Soviet army again attacked Budapest.

The second Soviet intervention, codenamed &quot;Operation Whirlwind&quot;, was launched by Marshal Ivan Konev. The five Soviet divisions stationed in Hungary before 23 October were reinforced; Soviet forces soon reached a total strength of 17 divisions. The 8th Mechanized Army under command of Lieutenant General Hamazasp Babadzhanian and the 38th Army under Lieutenant General Hadzhi-Umar Mamsurov from the nearby Carpathian Military District were deployed to Hungary for the operation. Some rank-and-file Soviet soldiers reportedly believed they were being sent to East Berlin to fight German fascists. By 21:30 on 3 November, the Soviet Army had completely encircled Budapest.

At 03:00 on 4 November, Soviet tanks penetrated Budapest along the Pest side of the Danube in two thrusts: one up the Soroksári road from the south and the other down the Váci road from the north. Thus, before a single shot was fired, the Soviets had effectively split the city into two, controlled all bridgeheads and were shielded to the rear by the wide Danube River. Armoured units crossed into Buda and, at 04:25, fired the first shots at the army barracks on Budaörsi Road. Soon, Soviet artillery and tank fire were heard in all of the districts of Budapest. Operation Whirlwind combined air strikes, artillery, and the co-ordinated tank–infantry action of 17 divisions. The Soviet army deployed T-34-85 medium tanks as well as the new T-54s, heavy IS-3 tanks, 152mm ISU-152 mobile assault guns and open-top BTR-152 armored personnel carriers.


Between 4 and 9 November, the Hungarian Army put up sporadic and disorganised resistance, with Zhukov reporting the disarming of twelve divisions, two armoured regiments and the entire Hungarian Air Force. Hungarian fighters continued their most formidable resistance in various districts of Budapest (most famously the Battle of the Corvin Passage), in and around the city of Pécs in the Mecsek Mountains, and in the industrial centre of Dunaújváros (then called Sztálinváros). There were ten to fifteen thousand resistance fighters fighting in Budapest, with the heaviest fighting occurring in the working-class stronghold of Csepel on the Danube River. Although some very senior officers were openly pro-Soviet, rank-and-file soldiers were overwhelmingly loyal to the revolution and either fought the invasion or deserted. The UN reported that there were no recorded incidents of Hungarian Army units fighting for the Soviets.

At 05:20 on 4 November, Nagy broadcast his final plea to the nation and the world, announcing that Soviet forces were attacking Budapest and that the government was remaining at its post. The radio station, Free Kossuth Rádió, stopped broadcasting at 08:07. An emergency Cabinet meeting was held in the Parliament but was attended by only three ministers. As Soviet troops arrived to occupy the building, a negotiated evacuation ensued, leaving Minister of State István Bibó as the last representative of the National Government remaining at his post. He wrote &quot;For Freedom and Truth&quot;, a stirring proclamation to the nation and the world.

At 06:00, 4 November, in the town of Szolnok, Kádár proclaimed the &quot;Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government&quot;. His statement declared: &quot;We must put an end to the excesses of the counter-revolutionary elements. The hour for action has sounded. We are going to defend the interest of the workers and peasants and the achievements of the people&#x27;s democracy.&quot;

Later that evening, Kádár called upon &quot;the faithful fighters of the true cause of socialism&quot; to come out of hiding and take up arms. But Hungarian support did not materialise, and fighting did not take the form of a civil war, but rather, in the words of a United Nations report, that of &quot;a well-equipped foreign army crushing by overwhelming force a national movement and eliminating the Government&quot;.

By 08:00, organised defence of the city evaporated after the radio station had been seized, and many defenders fell back to fortified positions. Between 08:00 and 09:00, the parliamentary guard laid down its arms, and forces under Major General Kuzma Grebennik captured Parliament and liberated captured ministers of the Rákosi–Hegedüs government. Among the liberated were István Dobi and Sándor Rónai, both of whom became members of the re-established socialist Hungarian government. As Soviet troops also came under attack in civilian quarters, they were unable to differentiate military from civilian targets. For that reason, Soviet tanks often crept along main roads and fired indiscriminately into buildings. Hungarian resistance was strongest in the industrial areas of Budapest, with Csepel heavily targeted by Soviet artillery and air strikes.

The last holdouts against the Soviet assault were located in Csepel and in Dunaújváros, where fighting lasted until 11 November, before insurgents finally succumbed to the Soviets. When the fighting ended, Hungarian casualties totalled approximately 2,500 dead and 20,000 wounded. Budapest bore the brunt of the bloodshed, with 1,569 civilians killed. Approximately 53% of the dead were workers; half of all Hungarian casualties were people younger than thirty. On the Soviet side, 699 men were killed, 1,450 wounded, and 51 missing in action. An estimated 80% of all Soviet casualties occurred in the fighting against insurgents in the eighth and ninth districts of Budapest.

===Soviet perspective===
Soviet reports of the events surrounding, during and after the disturbance were remarkably consistent in their accounts, more so after the Second Soviet intervention cemented support for the Soviet position among international communist parties. &quot;Pravda&quot; published an account 36 hours after the outbreak of violence that set the tone for all further reports and subsequent Soviet historiography:

# On 23 October, the honest socialist Hungarians demonstrated against mistakes made by the Rákosi and Gerő governments.
# Fascist, Hitlerite, reactionary and counter-revolutionary hooligans financed by western NGOs took advantage of the unrest to stage a counter-revolution.
# The honest Hungarian people under Nagy appealed to Soviet (Warsaw Pact) forces stationed in Hungary to assist in restoring order.
# The Nagy government was ineffective by allowing itself to be penetrated by counter-revolutionary influences, weakening and disintegrating, as proven by Nagy&#x27;s culminating denouncement of the Warsaw Pact.
# Hungarian patriots under Kádár broke with the Nagy government and formed a government of honest Hungarian revolutionary workers and peasants. The genuinely-popular government petitioned the Soviet command to help put down the counter-revolution.
# Hungarian patriots, with Soviet assistance, smashed the counter-revolution.

The first Soviet report came out 24 hours after the first Western report. Nagy&#x27;s appeal to the United Nations was not reported. After Nagy was arrested outside the Yugoslav embassy, his arrest was not reported. Also, accounts failed to explain how Nagy went from patriot to traitor. The Soviet press reported calm in Budapest, but the Western press reported a revolutionary crisis was breaking out. According to the Soviet account, Hungarians never wanted a revolution at all.

In January 1957, representatives of the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania met in Budapest to review internal developments in Hungary since the establishment of the Soviet-imposed government. A communiqué on the meeting &quot;unanimously concluded&quot; that Hungarian workers, with the leadership of the Kádár government and the support of the Soviet army, defeated attempts &quot;to eliminate the socialist achievements of the Hungarian people&quot;.

The Soviet, Chinese, and Warsaw Pact governments urged Kádár to proceed with the interrogation and trial of the ministers of the Nagy government, and asked for punitive measures against the &quot;counter-revolutionists&quot;. In addition, the Kádár government published an extensive series of &quot;white books&quot; (&quot;The Counter-Revolutionary Forces in the October Events in Hungary&quot;) that documented real incidents of violence against Communist Party and ÁVH members and the confessions of Nagy&#x27;s supporters. The &quot;white books&quot; were widely distributed in several languages in most socialist countries and, while based in fact, they present factual evidence with a colouring and narrative that are not generally supported by non-Soviet-aligned historians.

==Aftermath==
===Hungary===
In the immediate aftermath, many thousands of Hungarians were arrested. Eventually, 26,000 of these were brought before the Hungarian courts, 22,000 were sentenced and imprisoned, 13,000 were interned, and 229 were executed. Approximately 200,000 fled Hungary as refugees. Many resettled in Austria in the winter of 1956. These were helped by CARE, an international relief organization. CARE provided refugees with welcome kits consisting of pajamas, knitting tools, school supplies, food, and water. The U.S. Department of Agriculture worked with CARE to use military vessels to transport over 500,000 packages to Vienna, where the Red Cross distributed supplies to refugees. Hungarian refugees of the conflict were resettled across 37 different countries, with most going to Austria. Former Hungarian Foreign Minister Géza Jeszenszky estimated that 350 were executed. Sporadic resistance and strikes by workers&#x27; councils continued until mid-1957, causing economic disruption. By 1963, most political prisoners from the 1956 Hungarian Revolution had been released.

With most of Budapest under Soviet control by 8 November, Kádár became Prime Minister of the &quot;Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government&quot; and General Secretary of the Hungarian Communist Party. Few Hungarians rejoined the reorganised Party, its leadership having been purged under the supervision of the Soviet Praesidium, led by Georgy Malenkov and Mikhail Suslov. Although Party membership declined from 800,000 before the uprising to 100,000 by December 1956, Kádár steadily increased his control over Hungary and neutralised dissenters. The new government attempted to enlist support by espousing popular principles of Hungarian self-determination voiced during the uprising, but Soviet troops remained. After 1956 the Soviet Union severely purged the Hungarian Army and reinstituted political indoctrination in the units that remained. In May 1957, the Soviet Union increased its troop levels in Hungary and by treaty Hungary accepted the Soviet presence on a permanent basis.

The Red Cross and the Austrian Army established refugee camps in Traiskirchen and Graz. Nagy along with György Lukács, Géza Losonczy, and László Rajk&#x27;s widow, Júlia, took refuge in the Embassy of Yugoslavia as Soviet forces overran Budapest. Despite assurances of safe passage out of Hungary by the Soviets and the Kádár government, Nagy and his group were arrested when attempting to leave the embassy on 22 November and taken to Romania. Losonczy died while on a hunger strike in prison awaiting trial when his jailers &quot;carelessly pushed a feeding tube down his windpipe&quot;.

The remainder of the group was returned to Budapest in 1958. Nagy was executed, along with Maléter and Miklós Gimes, after secret trials in June 1958. Their bodies were placed in unmarked graves in the Municipal Cemetery outside Budapest.

During the November 1956 Soviet assault on Budapest, Cardinal Mindszenty was granted political asylum at the United States embassy, where he lived for the next 15 years, refusing to leave Hungary unless the government reversed his 1949 conviction for treason. Because of poor health and a request from the Vatican, he finally left the embassy for Austria in September 1971.

Nicolas Krassó was one of the left leaders of the Hungarian uprising and member of the &quot;New Left Review&quot; editorial committee. In an interview he gave to Peter Gowan shortly before his death, Krassó summed up the meaning of the Hungarian Revolution with a recollection from Stalin&#x27;s short speech in the 19th Congress of the Soviet Union in 1952: &quot;Stalin kept silent throughout the Congress till the very end when he made a short speech that covers about two and a half printed pages. He said there were two banners that the progressive bourgeoisie had thrown away and which the working class should pick up – the banners of democracy and national independence. Certainly nobody could doubt that in 1956 the Hungarian workers raised these banners high.&quot;

===International===
Despite Cold War rhetoric from western countries espousing rollback of the Soviet domination of eastern Europe, and Soviet promises of socialism&#x27;s imminent triumph, national leaders of this period (as well as later historians) saw the failure of the Hungarian Revolution as evidence that the Cold War had come to a stalemate in Europe.

In West Germany, Foreign Minister Heinrich von Brentano di Tremezzo recommended that the people of Eastern Europe be discouraged from &quot;taking dramatic action which might have disastrous consequences for themselves&quot;. The Secretary-General of NATO Paul-Henri Spaak called the Hungarian revolt &quot;the collective suicide of a whole people&quot;. In a December 1956 meeting of the West German Social-Democratic Party, Central Board member Herbert Wehner condemned what he termed the uprising&#x27;s &quot;fever of destruction against everybody believed to be members or officials of the Communist Party.&quot; In a newspaper interview in 1957, Khrushchev commented, &quot;support by United States ... is rather in the nature of the support that the rope gives to a hanged man&quot;. 

In January 1957, United Nations Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld, acting in response to UN General Assembly resolutions requesting investigation and observation of the events in Soviet-occupied Hungary, established the Special Committee on the Problem of Hungary. The committee, with representatives from Australia, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), Denmark, Tunisia and Uruguay, conducted hearings in New York, Geneva, Rome, Vienna and London. Over five months, 111 refugees were interviewed including ministers, military commanders and other officials of the Nagy government, workers, revolutionary council members, factory managers and technicians, communists and non-communists, students, writers, teachers, medical personnel, and Hungarian soldiers. Documents, newspapers, radio transcripts, photos, film footage, and other records from Hungary were also reviewed, as well as written testimony of 200 other Hungarians.

The governments of Hungary and Romania refused entry to the officials of this committee, and the government of the Soviet Union did not respond to requests for information. The 268-page Committee Report was presented to the General Assembly in June 1957, documenting the course of the uprising and Soviet intervention and concluding that &quot;the Kádár government and Soviet occupation were in violation of the human rights of the Hungarian people&quot;. A General Assembly resolution was approved, deploring &quot;the repression of the Hungarian people and the Soviet occupation&quot;, but no other action was taken.

The chairman of the Special Committee was Alsing Andersen, a Danish politician and leading figure of Denmark&#x27;s Social Democratic Party, who had served in the Buhl government in 1942 during the Nazi German occupation of Denmark. He had defended collaboration with the occupation forces and denounced the resistance. The Committee Report and the motives of its authors were criticised by the delegations to the United Nations from the Soviet Union and Kádár government. The Hungarian representative disagreed with the report&#x27;s conclusions, accusing it of falsifying the events, and argued that the establishment of the committee was illegal. The committee was accused of being hostile to Hungary and its social system. An article in the Soviet journal &quot;International Affairs&quot;, published by the Foreign Affairs Ministry, carried an article in 1957 in which it denounced the report as a &quot;collection of falsehoods and distortions&quot;.

&quot;Time&quot; named the Hungarian Freedom Fighter its Man of the Year for 1956. The accompanying &quot;Time&quot; article comments that this choice could not have been anticipated until the explosive events of the revolution, almost at the end of 1956. The magazine cover and accompanying text displayed an artist&#x27;s depiction of a Hungarian freedom fighter, and used pseudonyms for the three participants whose stories are the subject of the article. In 2006, Hungarian Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsány referred to this famous &quot;Time&quot; cover as &quot;the faces of free Hungary&quot; in a speech marking the 50th anniversary of the uprising. Mr Gyurcsány (in a joint appearance with British Prime Minister Tony Blair) commented &quot;It is an idealised image but the faces of the figures are really the face of the revolutionaries&quot;.

At the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, the Soviet handling of the Hungarian uprising led to a boycott by Spain, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. A confrontation between Soviet and Hungarian teams occurred in the semi-final match of the water polo tournament on 6 December. The match was extremely violent, and was halted in the final minute to quell fighting among spectators. This match, now known as the &quot;blood in the water match&quot;, became the subject of several films. The Hungarian team won the game 4–0 and later was awarded the Olympic gold medal. Norway declined an invitation to the inaugural Bandy World Championship in 1957, citing the presence of a team from the Soviet Union as the reason.

On Sunday, January 6, 1957, as millions of Americans watched Ed Sullivan&#x27;s popular television variety show, with the nearly 22 year-old Elvis Presley headlining for the third time, Sullivan told viewers Presley felt &quot;so keenly about Hungarian relief, he urges all of us through the country to remember that immediate aid is needed.&quot; The host followed this with Elvis singing an unrecorded number, the gospel song &quot;Peace in the Valley&quot;, saying &quot;he feels that this is sort of in the mood that he&#x27;d like to create.&quot; By the end of 1957, these contributions, distributed by the Geneva-based International Red Cross as food rations, clothing and other essentials, had amounted to some CHF 26 million (US$6 million in 1957 dollars), the equivalent of $ in today&#x27;s dollars. On 1 March 2011, István Tarlós, the mayor of Budapest, made Presley an honorary citizen posthumously, and a plaza located at the intersection of two of the city&#x27;s most important avenues was named after Presley as a gesture of gratitude.

Meanwhile, as the 1950s drew to a close the events in Hungary produced fractures within the Communist political parties of Western European countries. In San Marino, some moderate Socialist members of a Socialist-Communist coalition government broke their alliance with the Communists, who failed to condemn the Soviet Union&#x27;s repression of the Hungarians. This schism resulted in a perfect 30–30 split in the council that paralyzed the government and led to the fatti di Rovereta, a constitutional crisis which resulted in the victory of a new democratic government and brought the twelve years of communist rule in San Marino to an end. The Italian Communist Party (PCI) suffered a split. According to the official newspaper of the PCI, &quot;l&#x27;Unità&quot;, most ordinary members and the Party leadership, including Palmiro Togliatti and Giorgio Napolitano, supported the actions of the Soviet Union in suppressing the uprising. However, Giuseppe Di Vittorio, chief of the communist trade union CGIL, spoke out against the leadership&#x27;s position, as did prominent party members Antonio Giolitti, Loris Fortuna, and many others influential in the Communist Party. Pietro Nenni of the Italian Socialist Party, a close ally of the PCI, opposed the Soviet intervention as well. Napolitano, elected in 2006 as President of the Italian Republic, wrote in his 2005 political autobiography that he regretted his justification of Soviet action in Hungary, stating at the time he believed that party unity and the leadership of Soviet Communism was more important.

The Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) suffered the loss of thousands of party members following the events in Hungary. Though Peter Fryer, correspondent for the CPGB newspaper &quot;The Daily Worker&quot;, reported on the violent suppression of the uprising, his dispatches were heavily censored by the party leadership. Upon his return from Hungary Fryer resigned from the paper. He was later expelled by the Communist Party.

In France, moderate communists, such as historian Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, resigned, questioning the French Communist Party&#x27;s policy of supporting Soviet actions. The French philosopher and writer Albert Camus wrote an open letter, &quot;The Blood of the Hungarians&quot;, criticising the West&#x27;s lack of action. Even Jean-Paul Sartre, still a determined Communist, criticised the Soviets in his article &quot;Le Fantôme de Staline&quot;, in &quot;Situations VII&quot;. Left communists were particularly supportive of the revolution.

The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) viewed the events of the revolution in context of its concern with the Soviet de-Stalinization of 1956 and the sort of problems along the lines of the Eastern European uprisings that China might eventually have to face. Some Chinese leaders viewed the events, together with the protests in Poland, as demonstrating the dangers of overemphasizing development of heavy industry while underemphasizing people&#x27;s livelihoods. Mao cited the repressions in Hungary as a lesson: &quot;You forbid people to strike, to petition, or to make unfavorable comments, you simply resort to repression in every case, until one day you become a Rákosi.&quot; Later, as the CCP leadership became concerned with the degree of criticism from the lower levels of the party and from outside of the party during the Hundred Flowers campaign, Mao again cited the Hungarian revolution, describing China as at risk of a &quot;Hungarian Incident&quot; if it did not win this &quot;major battle&quot;.

===Commemoration and legacy===
In the north-west corner of MacArthur Park in Los Angeles, California, the Hungarian-American community built a commemorative statue to honour the Hungarian freedom fighters. Built in the late 1960s, the obelisk statue stands with an American eagle watching over the city of Los Angeles. There are several monuments dedicated to the Commemoration of the Hungarian Revolution throughout the United States. One such monument may be found in Cleveland, Ohio, at the Cardinal Mindszenty Plaza. There is also a monument of &quot;A Boy From Pest&quot; in the town of Szczecin, Poland. Denver has Hungarian Freedom Park, named in 1968 to commemorate the uprising.

Public discussion about the revolution was suppressed in Hungary for more than 30 years. Since the thaw of the 1980s, it has been a subject of intense study and debate. At the inauguration of the Third Hungarian Republic in 1989, 23 October was declared a national holiday.

On 16 June 1989, at the 31st commemoration of his execution, Nagy&#x27;s body was reburied with full honours. The Republic of Hungary was declared in 1989 on the 33rd anniversary of the Revolution, and 23 October is now a Hungarian national holiday.

In December 1991, the preamble of the treaties signed with the dismembered Soviet Union, under Mikhail Gorbachev, and Russia, represented by Boris Yeltsin, officially apologised for the Soviet actions of 1956 in Hungary. Yeltsin made the apology in person during a 1992 speech to the Hungarian Parliament.

In 2000, the Hungarian government passed &quot;Ilona Tóth&#x27;s law&quot;, absolving those that were convicted for their involvement with the revolution, inspired by the case of Ilona Tóth.

On 13 February 2006, the U.S. State Department commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice commented on the contributions made by 1956 Hungarian refugees to the United States and other host countries, as well as the role of Hungary in providing refuge to East Germans during the 1989 protests against communist rule. U.S. President George W. Bush also visited Hungary on 22 June 2006 to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary.

In August 2023, a history textbook written by former Minister of Culture of Russia Vladimir Medinsky, claimed that the 1956 Hungarian Revolution was a fascist uprising organised by the West. On 25 September 2023, Hungary&#x27;s Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Péter Szijjártó said &quot;labelling these people as fascists is simply unacceptable&quot;.

<text>Valencia () is the capital city of Carabobo State and the third-largest city in Venezuela.

The city is an economic hub that contains Venezuela&#x27;s top industries and manufacturing companies. It is also the largest city in the Valencia-Maracay metropolitan region, which with a population of about 4.5 million is the country&#x27;s second largest after that of Caracas. Caracas lies some away to the east.

== History ==
The area was already inhabited in the fourth millennium BC. The inhabitants were mainly hunters and gatherers who might have already developed some elementary forms of agriculture. Between AD 200 and 1000 an important settlement was formed close to Lake Valencia.

Around the year 1000, waves of migration started to come from the Orinoco river area, probably arriving along the Pao river. The fusion of previous settlements with these new populations gave rise to the Vacencioide culture.

People in the area belonged mostly to Arawak groups. They were hunters and gatherers who also fished and grew maize and cotton. Their houses were built on artificial mounds in valleys that were often flooded by water from Lake Valencia.

Archaeologists have found mostly pottery from that time. Valencia was founded by Captain Alonso Díaz Moreno on March 25, 1555as the locals are proud of reminding visitors, eight years before Caracas. It was the first Spanish settlement in north-central Venezuela and its official name was &quot;Nuestra Señora de la Asunción de Nueva Valencia del Rey&quot;. It was named after Valencia de Don Juan, Province of León, Spain. The encomiendas put the Indians living in the region under the control of the Spanish settlers. They started to displace the native population from the most fertile land, but they also started intermarrying with them.

Spanish conquistador Lope de Aguirre entered the city in 1561. In 1677 it was raided by French pirates, who burnt down its City Hall, thus destroying many very important documents about the early settlement of Venezuela. The German scientist Alexander von Humboldt visited the city on his trip through the Americas. He reported that at the time of his visit the city had around 6000 to 7000 inhabitants. 
On June 24, 1821, the battle of Carabobo was fought near the city, sealing the independence of Venezuela from imperial Spanish rule.
Valencia became the capital of Venezuela in 1830, after it separated from Gran Colombia. It ceased to be the capital soon afterward, becoming once more the seat of the national government in 1858 after the Monagas brothers were toppled and the March Revolution took place. On November 15, 1892, the University of Valencia, future University of Carabobo, was founded. 

When dictator Juan Vicente Gómez died in 1935, Nueva Valencia del Rey was a small city. The oil revenues and industrialization that came along lead to a population explosion. Many immigrants, firstly from Europe and increasingly then from other Latin American countries, chose Nueva Valencia del Rey as the place to live in Venezuela.

The first direct election of local governments (including those of the mayor and of the state&#x27;s government) took place in 1988.

Valencia was one of the places where Hugo Chávez&#x27;s proposal for the constitutional reform was rejected with the highest proportion of votes: around 59.21% of the population rejected it.

<text>Stewart Edward Hart (May 3, 1915 – October 16, 2003) was a Canadian amateur and professional wrestler, wrestling booker, promoter, and coach. He is best known for founding and handling Stampede Wrestling, a professional wrestling promotion based in Calgary, Alberta, teaching many individuals at its associated wrestling school &quot;The Dungeon&quot; and establishing a professional wrestling dynasty consisting of his relatives and close trainees. As the patriarch of the Hart wrestling family, Hart is the ancestor of many wrestlers, most notably being the father of Bret and Owen Hart as well as the grandfather of Natalya Neidhart, Teddy Hart and Harry Smith.

Hart was born to an impoverished Saskatchewan family but became a successful amateur wrestler during the 1930s and early 1940s, holding many national championships, as well as engaging in many other sports. He began wrestling for show in 1943 with the Royal Canadian Navy while serving in World War II as he could not go to the 1940 Summer Olympics due to the war. After leaving the service he travelled to America and debuted professionally for the New York wrestling territory in 1946. Hart was considered very handsome and a good in-ring performer, focusing on a submission-like and technical style of wrestling, but despite this and being popular in general he was not given a major spotlight, and soon after marrying Helen Smith, whom he met in New York City, he created his own promotion in Edmonton, Alberta, which would be known as Stampede Wrestling and took over the surrounding wrestling territory which covered most of western Canada and the US state of Montana. The territory would go on to become known as the Stampede territory thenceforth. In 1949, Stu and Helen moved to Great Falls, Montana. Hart&#x27;s promotion featured a large variety of outside stars from the wrestling industry as well as homegrown talent for whom he booked storylines. Beginning from the 1950s Hart helped train a large number of people for his company and gained a reputation as one of the best teachers in the wrestling business. In October 1951, Stu and Helen moved to Calgary, Alberta, into what would become the famous Hart House.

Hart remained an active full-time wrestler until the 1960s when he entered semi-in-ring retirement, thereafter he would focus mostly on promoting, booking and teaching, as well as raising his twelve children with Helen while still appearing in the ring sporadically until the 1980s. Throughout his career, Hart almost exclusively portrayed a heroic character, a so-called &quot;babyface&quot; role and only held one professional title, the NWA Northwest Tag Team Championship. After selling his territory to Titan Sports, Inc. in 1984, Hart would make several appearances on WWF television and Pay-Per-View with his wife, often involved in storylines surrounding his sons Bret and Owen and several of his sons-in-law who were signed to the company. He continued to teach wrestling at his home in Calgary until the 1990s when he suffered a severe leg injury and had to stop engaging excessively with students, leaving most of the work for his sons Bruce and Keith. He died at age 88 in October 2003 after suffering from multiple medical issues.

Hart is regarded by many, including major wrestling historian and sports journalist Dave Meltzer, as one of the most influential and important figures in professional wrestling history and an icon of the artform. His greatest contribution to the art was as a promoter and trainer. Along with Bret and Owen, Hart&#x27;s trainees included future world champions Fritz Von Erich, Superstar Billy Graham, Chris Jericho, Edge, Christian, Mark Henry, Chris Benoit, and Jushin Thunder Liger. Hart was a member of the inaugural &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot; Hall of Fame class in 1996 and was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2010 by his son Bret. Hart was also well known for his involvement in over thirty charities, for which he was named a Member of the Order of Canada, the second highest honour for merit which can be given in Canada and the highest civilian honour.

==Early life==

Hart was born in Saskatoon in 1915 to Edward and Elizabeth Stewart Hart. He was mainly of Ulster Scot descent from his father&#x27;s side but also had Scottish and English ancestry from his mother&#x27;s side of the family.

His childhood was impoverished; as a boy, Stu Hart lived in a tent with his family on the prairie in Alberta, living off the land, milking cows and wild game that Stu took down with his slingshot. As a child Hart and his sisters were often mistreated at school by both fellow students and teachers since it was well known that they were from such a poor family. Hart was also berated and treated with disdain for being lefthanded, something seen as deviant at the time. Like most lefthanded children at the time, he was forced to work with his right, and as a result he became ambidextrous. In 1928, his father was arrested for failure to pay back taxes, while the Salvation Army sent Stu, his mother, and two sisters, Sylvester and Edrie to live in Edmonton. Due to his destitute childhood and youth Hart did not experience a dramatic shift in life quality or mentality during the Great Depression which affected most others around him in Edmonton.

==Amateur wrestling==
Hart was trained in catch wrestling in his youth by other boys. Speaking of it, Stu said that his &quot;head would be blue by the time they let go of him&quot;. Stu taught this &#x27;shoot style&#x27; to all who trained under him in the 1980s and 1990s with the thought that teaching his students real submission moves would make their professional wrestling style sharper. During his time in Edmonton with his mother and sisters Hart began finding an interest in sports with wrestling and football being his favourites. He started weightlifting and training for wrestling when he was fourteen years old and quickly built a strong neck and impressive arms. He began attending amateur wrestling classes when he joined the YMCA in Edmonton in 1929 and soon became a talented grappler. By the age of fifteen Hart won the Edmonton City Championship in the middleweight class and the Alberta Provincial championship later that same year. Hart continued to train and improve his abilities and by 1937 he was the Dominion welterweight champion, also in 1937 he won a gold medal in the welterweight class from the Amateur Athletic Union of Canada. Hart qualified for the 1938 British Empire Games in Australia but was unable to go due to economic reasons, mainly the lack of funding from the Canadian government, a leftover from the depression. During the mid-1930s Hart also coached wrestling at the University of Alberta.

His amateur career peaked in May 1940 when Hart won the Dominion Amateur Wrestling Championship in the light heavyweight category. Hart qualified and would have competed at the Summer Olympics in Helsinki in 1940 but could not due to it being cancelled because of the outbreak of World War II, which was a terrible blow to Hart personally, as it had been his dream to compete at the Olympics from a very young age.

==Other sport ventures and military service==
While Hart was mainly a lover of submission wrestling he was also an outstanding all-around athlete who played virtually every sport available, excelling at football, baseball and fastball notably. Hart played professionally for the Edmonton Eskimos from 1937 to 1939 as a center and was considered a standout performer at the time. Hart had initially been slated for the 1941 season as well but had to decline due to other commitments which prevented him from joining at that time. He coached a women&#x27;s fastball team in Edmonton during the late 1930s as well as being the captain of a popular baseball team called Hart&#x27;s All Stars. The players of Hart&#x27;s All Stars consisted of sheet-metal workers from Edmonton whom he trained.

On Christmas Eve 1941 Hart was almost killed in a bicycle accident which broke both his elbows and thumbs and hurt his back severely. The injuries risked ending Hart&#x27;s athletic career. The accident happened while he was on the way to be with his father Edward to celebrate Christmas with the family when a fire truck drove behind him and forced Hart to swerve to the side where he was hit by another car which propelled him thirty feet forward on the road and scraped off a large portion of his skin in the process. He spent several months at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Edmonton recovering. In the spring, still hospitalized, Hart was visited by Al Oeming, a young neighbour who had been drafted into the Royal Canadian Navy for World War II and after being released from the hospital Hart decided to enlist. Hart enlisted in the Navy and was appointed to the position of Director of Athletics. In early 1943, Hart was put in for a transfer from the Nonsuch in Edmonton to regular service in Cornwallis, Nova Scotia. Physically, he had fully recovered from his injuries and had hoped to see genuine sea duty afterward, but the Navy appeared to be more interested in him as an athletic director than as a regular enlisted seaman. By later 1943 the Navy had him wrestling mostly to amuse the other servicemen, instead of purely competitively. He performed regularly before thousands of other enlisted men in drill halls. Several of the men he worked with would end up being employed by Hart when he became a promoter later in life.

Hart spent much of his free time during World War II performing and organizing different sports events to raise funds to the war effort. As an active sailor and director of athletics Hart was the leader of all the sports teams available and a member of them as well, most notably the fastball team and the wrestling team. Hart originally wanted to leave the Navy when the war was over but the organization considered him to be a great asset both as a trainer as well as a showpiece, persuading him to stay. He would attempt to ask to be let go several times later but was told to stay again. Eventually, Hart was given his discharge from the Navy in early 1946.

==Professional wrestling career==
===New York territory (1946–1947)===
It was during his time in the Navy that Stu was introduced to professional wrestling. Around this time Hart and Al Oeming, a future wrestler, nature conservationist, and fellow sailor, became closer as friends. Oeming later would help him handle his own promotion.

After recovering from a car accident, Stu competed in various exhibition matches to entertain the troops. In 1946, while receiving training from Toots Mondt, Hart debuted in New York City. Early on, Hart experienced harsh treatment from his fellow wrestlers in the ring and during training, being considered a &quot;pretty boy&quot; at first by his peers and older wrestlers; described as &quot;tall, dark and handsome, with a build that would put movie idols to shame&quot; he was immediately a favourite with the female fans. Hart would often be swarmed by women and covered with kisses as he made his way to the ring. The roughing up of younger performers by veteran workers was common at the time in the industry but Hart adapted to it rather quickly and would retaliate with the same treatment, utilizing his catch wrestling experience to his advantage. While never given the opportunity to be champion Hart did partake in several high-profile matches with the likes of Lou Thesz and Frank Sexton. He also developed a reputation as a legitimate athlete and &quot;tough-guy&quot; in the business. Hart was a frequent tag team wrestler together with Lord James Blears. Blears and Hart lived together for six months with another wrestler named Sandor Kovacs whom Hart already knew from the Navy. They used to frequent the beaches at Long Beach in New York on their free time and it was on the beach that Hart first met his wife Helen Smith and her family. Hart had quickly become a rising star in the area but chose to leave together with his newly engaged fiancée only about a year and a half after debuting.

===National Wrestling Alliance (1947–1984)===

By 1947, Hart was working for Jerry Meeker and Larry Tillman in Montana as both a wrestler and a booker. In late 1947 he travelled to wrestle in San Antonio briefly. In September 1948, Hart established Klondike Wrestling in Edmonton, the promotion joined the NWA in 1948. In 1949, Hart was involved in a storyline with the &quot;heel&quot; Lord Albert Mills, they were scheduled to have a two out of three main event match at the Billings Sports arena on Monday December 19, the match was a followup to another one the previous week when Mills had gotten the win through nefarious means. Hart was portrayed as having been caught off guard the Monday before when it happened. Hart was a perpetual &quot;face&quot; during his in-ring career, including during his time with the NWA, and was a noted draw for women in the areas he wrestled. In 1950, Hart wrestled for the NWA associated Alex Turk Promotions in Winnipeg. The first match was against Verne Gagne on June 29 at the Civic Auditorium, the match resulted in a draw. He also wrestled in a match against Matt Murphy in the Civic Auditorium on November 9, which he was booked to win. In 1951, Hart purchased a mansion in Patterson Heights, Calgary, The Hart House which is now considered a heritage site. Its basement, later known as the Dungeon, provided training grounds for his wrestling pupils. Later that year Hart headlined an event in Wisconsin, again together with Verne Gagne. Hart was still favoured by women at this time even against a bigger star like Gagne.

===Big Time Wrestling and Wildcat Wrestling (1952–1967)===
In 1952, Hart bought up Tillman&#x27;s territory in Alberta and merged his own promotion with it into Big Time Wrestling. The promotion would later change name to Wildcat Wrestling and lastly morph into Stampede Wrestling many years later. The televised version of Hart&#x27;s wrestling shows were one of Canada&#x27;s longest-running television programs, lasting over 30 years and remained one of Calgary&#x27;s most popular sports programs, eventually airing in over 50 countries worldwide.

===Stampede Wrestling (1967–1986)===

Hart&#x27;s Stampede Wrestling was responsible for developing many wrestlers who would later become very successful in other promotions and territories, mainly in the WWF. Hart would generally close the promotion down during summers and open it up again during the winter when the other territories were closed. Hart had on occasions wrestled animals such as tigers and grizzly bears as part of promotional efforts for the company as well as charity. Later in life Hart would often let his sons Bruce and Keith handle the booking of the promotion.

On July 25, 1986, he wrestled his last match in a tag team match with his son, Keith defeating Honky Tonk Wayne and J.R. Foley at a Stampede Wrestling event in Calgary.

===Post-retirement appearances (1991–2003)===
Hart made several appearances on WWE television in the 1990s and early 2000s. The majority of those appearances involved his sons, Bret and Owen Hart. A recurring staple of these appearances in the 1990s was that Stu and Helen would be verbally attacked by several of the commentators, mostly by Bobby Heenan and Jerry Lawler, the latter of whom was in a long-running feud with Bret during this point in time. At the 1993 Pay-Per-View event Survivor Series, Stu had a planned physical interaction outside of the ring with Shawn Michaels. Michaels was involved in a match with Stu&#x27;s sons, Bruce, Keith, Bret and Owen Hart. Michaels played the part of the antagonist, and when failing to succeed in winning the match, Michaels&#x27; character then attacked Stu who responded by pretending to knock him out with an elbow smash. Michaels later stated that he was happy to take the hit as he considered it an honour.

Hart also appeared in WCW at the Slamboree 1993: A Legends&#x27; Reunion event.

==As a trainer==
Hart trained the vast majority of his trainees in the basement of the Hart mansion, known as The Dungeon. Hart used the location from the time that he bought it in October 1951 until the late 1990s. All eight of his sons and many others such as Junkyard Dog, Jushin Liger, Superstar Billy Graham and The British Bulldog were educated there.

Hart&#x27;s training technique, called &quot;stretching&quot; consisted of Hart putting his trainees in painful submission holds and holding on for a substantial time to improve their pain endurance to prepare them for the life of professional wrestling. Hart&#x27;s technique was well known and he would let anyone who wished to let him apply one of his holds do so if they came to his home. Hart&#x27;s son Bret once spoke about a well-known case where he stretched a priest, stating that his father wasn&#x27;t prejudiced, since &quot;he stretched a rabbi once too.&quot; Some of Hart&#x27;s former students, including his son Bret, have mentioned that his stretching would sometimes result in broken blood vessels in the eyes, something which others have attempted to learn from his father.

Hart was said to have had a special liking for training football players and bodybuilders since he enjoyed testing their strength. Some have described his training as torture and have accused Hart of being a sadist who enjoyed inflicting pain on people and was more interested in doing so than teach them professional wrestling. Many who were close to Hart in his life have denied these claims. Stu&#x27;s seventh son Ross has said that his father was always generous and compassionate with his children and others in person but added that he was different when training people, believing that there was no easy way to teach wrestling. His daughter-in-law Martha has expressed in her book that she felt sure that Hart was well aware of his students&#x27; limits and never meant to actually harm any of them, stating that he was always careful not to apply too much pressure on any of his holds and intended more to scare them than maim them. Although she recalled several times when she thought she would pass out from the pain of the holds he had put on her, which he had meant as a playful gesture. She added that it was fair to say that he had never seriously hurt anyone physically, albeit he may have inadvertently done so mentally. Despite this, she also disclosed that her husband Owen had long been scared of his father during childhood due to his fearsome reputation and hearing his brothers as well as other trainees&#x27; screams from the family&#x27;s basement where Hart&#x27;s training hall was located. This fear lingered into Owen&#x27;s adolescence but ceased when he became an adult. Owen himself revealed in the 1998 documentary &quot;Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows&quot; that he was often intimidated by his father but respected him and that that kept him from misbehaving. In the same documentary his third son Keith explained that many may have believed his father to be a psychopath at first glance but that you had to know him intimately to understand that he wasn&#x27;t anything like that beneath the surface. Wrestling manager Jim Cornette has theorized that his cruel upbringing and tough early development may have played a part in the seemingly contradictory behaviour from Hart, as both a dedicated family man and apparently sadistic tormentor of his students.

==Personal life==
Hart was close friends with fellow wrestler Luther Jacob Goodall, better known by the name Luther Lindsay. Goodall was one of the few men who bested him in the infamous &quot;Dungeon&quot; and Hart reportedly carried a picture of him in his wallet until his passing in 2003. Goodall&#x27;s death in 1972 affected Hart tremendously. Hart&#x27;s son Keith described them as being as close as brothers. Hart was also a good friend of wrestling promoter Jack Pfefer, whom he asked to be the godfather of his son Ross, as well as Calgary Mayor Rod Sykes and ice hockey player Brian Conacher. All of the wrestling belts that Hart used for his promotions were handmade by himself. Making championship belts was one of Hart&#x27;s many domestic skills.

Hart allegedly wrote the foreword to the controversial book &quot;Under the Mat&quot; which was written by his youngest daughter, Diana Hart. His son Bret has questioned the legitimacy of it, and has stated that if Hart did write the foreword, his daughter probably did not let him read the book beforehand.

===Family===

Hart married a New Yorker, Helen Smith (born February 16, 1924 – died November 4, 2001), the daughter of Olympic marathon runner Harry Smith on December 31, 1947. They were introduced through each other by Paul Boesch. Stu and Helen were married for over 53 years until Helen&#x27;s death at the age of 77.

Stu and Helen raised their twelve children in the Hart mansion, Smith, Bruce, Keith, Wayne, Dean, Ellie, Georgia, Bret, Alison, Ross, Diana and Owen. Hart was a non-denominational Christian, however, he had all his children baptized by a local Catholic priest. The couple have around thirty-six biological grandchildren and several great-grandchildren, three of whom, his oldest grandson Teddy Annis&#x27;s son Bradley and his oldest granddaughter Tobi McIvor&#x27;s two oldest daughters Amanda and Jessica, were born during Hart&#x27;s lifetime. Tom and Michelle Billington&#x27;s three children, Bronwyne, Marek and Amaris are also often included in the list of his grandchildren, therefore Bronwyne&#x27;s daughter Miami is also often referred to as one of his great-grandchildren. Many of his grandchildren went on to become wrestlers or were otherwise involved in wrestling.

In 1949, Hart and his wife Helen who was pregnant with their second child, Bruce were in a car accident on their way home from a wrestling match, Hart was unscathed, although he did break the car&#x27;s steering wheel on impact, however his wife Helen suffered several injuries and had to be held in a hospital for a long time, leading them to leaving their oldest child, Smith, with Helen&#x27;s parents Elizabeth and Harry Smith for two years.

According to his son Ross, Hart was severely affected and badly aged by being bereaved of his youngest son Owen in 1999 and by becoming a widower in 2001.

===Philanthropy===
Because of his extensive work as a coach and mentor to many young athletes as well as over thirty years of charitable work in his hometown, Stu Hart was appointed a Member of the Order of Canada on November 15, 2000. He was honoured with an investiture on May 31, 2001, in Ottawa.

==Death==
In May 2003, Hart had a life-threatening bout of pneumonia, which saw him hospitalized at Rockyview General Hospital, although Hart recovered later that month and returned to his residence at the Hart House. On October 3, 2003, Hart was readmitted to Rockyview General Hospital as a result of an elbow infection at which point he then developed pneumonia again. He also suffered from ailments associated with diabetes and arthritis. After a brief improvement in his health for a few days from October 11, he suffered a stroke on October 15, and died the following day. He was 88 years old.

Hart&#x27;s funeral service was attended by approximately 1,000 people. He was cremated and his ashes were later interred at Eden Brook Memorial Gardens in a plot with his wife Helen, who had died almost two years earlier in November 2001.

==Legacy==
Hart is regarded by many as one of the most important and respected people in the history of professional wrestling, and an icon of the art.

Sports journalist and wrestling historian Dave Meltzer described Hart&#x27;s importance to the art of professional wrestling as indispensable since his booking decisions and training of several key individuals affected the industry in significant ways. Meltzer describes people like Hulk Hogan and Jesse Ventura as people who were spawned by Harts actions and cites the Dynamite Kid, Junkyard Dog and Billy Robinson as some who would probably not have had the careers they did if not for Hart. He also mentions Chris Benoit and Brian Pillman as individuals who would most certainly never even have become wrestlers were it not for Hart. Meltzer characterized Hart as the biggest territorial star in wrestling history to never win a major championship. Former wrestling promoter and owner of the St. Louis Wrestling Club Larry Matysik described Hart as a Canadian icon.

Hart had a noticeable accent which included a very raspy voice and unique way of speaking which he was well known for. According to the &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot;, Hart is the most imitated man in professional wrestling, with practically everyone in the industry having tried a Stu Hart impersonation.

WWE chairman Vince McMahon has lauded Hart as a trailblazer for the wrestling industry. On March 27, 2010, Hart was posthumously inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame.

In the Hart Legacy Wrestling promotion, controlled by Hart&#x27;s relatives and their associates, there is a Stu Hart Heritage Title.

There is an annual juvenile amateur wrestling tournament named after Hart called the &quot;Stu Hart Tournament of Champions&quot; held in Canada.

In Saskatoon&#x27;s Blairmore Suburban Centre there is a road named Hart Road, in Stu Hart&#x27;s honour.

In 2005 a documentary directed by Blake Norton, &quot;Surviving the Dungeon: The Legacy of Stu Hart&quot;, was released.

As of 2005 Hart is part of a permanent exhibit at the Glenbow Museum. A scissored armbar wrestling hold is sometimes referred as a &quot;Stu-Lock&quot; in Hart&#x27;s honour.

<text>Carabobo State (, ) is one of the 23 states of Venezuela, located in the north of the country, about two hours by car from Caracas. The state capital city is Valencia, which is also the country&#x27;s main industrial center. The state&#x27;s area is and as of the 2011 census, had a population of 2,245,744.

Carabobo State was the site of the Battle of Carabobo on 24 June 1821. This was a decisive win in the war of independence from Spain, and was led by Simón Bolívar.
==Toponymy==
There are several versions about the origin of the name Carabobo. One of them refers to a voice coming from a local Arawaco language: Karau means savannah and bo means water. The repeated bo acts as a superlative, i.e. a lot of water or streams. Thus, Carabobo would mean Savannah of Waters or Savannah of Ravines.
== History ==
=== Prehistory ===

==== First cultures ====

When Europeans arrived to what would become Venezuela, one of the most important cultural centres was located around the Valencia Lake. The Native Americans in the region were hunters, gatherers, but also fishers and farmers. Many petroglyphs and ceramics remain from this time.

There are signs of human presence in the Valencia region from the fourth millennium BC onwards. Humans were also present earlier in other areas of what is now Carabobo, like in Bejuma.

An important human settlement occurred around the Valencia Lake between 200 and 1000 AD. These people already practiced some kind of agriculture.

==== Second wave ====

At the end of the first millennium new populations started to arrive from the Orinoco region, probably via the El Pao River. From the eighth century onwards the Orinoco populations started to merge with the older groups. This fusion produced what is known as Valenciode culture.
People lived in houses built on artificial mounds in the very fruitful valleys to the East and West of the Valencia Lake. They produced specially anthropomorphic sculptures.

Around the year 1200 the Valencioide culture reached the whole area of the Valencia Lake basin, the centre of Northern Venezuela and several islands in the Caribbean. The Indians would trade sea products like the (Strombus gigas), salt (specially from the Paraguana Peninsula), turtles and fish from coral reefs. The trade took place in villages along the coast.

Taramainas, Tacariguas and other tribes inhabited the Valencia Lake region when the Europeans arrived.
The different groups spoke mostly Arawak languages, but there were also several Carib groups.

The Indians grew maize, a typical product of Western South American cultures and also Manioc, a typical product of groups from the East. Many &quot;metates&quot; or grinding stones for maize as well as budares for the preparation of cassava remain from those times.

The Jirajara Indians from Nirgua (now a region between Yaracuy and Carabobo), would go to the Valencia Lake and from there through the mountains to the Sea at the level of Borburata to get salt.

=== European conquest and colonization ===
==== 15th and 16th centuries ====

Juan de Villegas founded the town of Borburata in 1548. Seven years later, in 1555, he founded Valencia in the central plains to the west of the Tacarigua (Valencia) Lake.

In 1577 and 1583 the region of Valencia suffered a series of raids by Carib tribes coming from the Low Orinoco. The Spanish troops led by Garci-González repelled and went after them.

During the late 16th and 17th centuries, the region suffered many attacks by French and British pirates. The town of Borburata was eventually abandoned for a long period, and settlers moved to Valencia, which was less likely to be raided as it was a day walk from the Caribbean. Some of the attacks included:

* 1555: French pirates attacked Borburata for 6 days
* 1564: British pirates led by John Hawkins &#x27;forced&#x27; the Borburata settlers to buy his cargo, about two hundred Africans from the Gambia region and some European products.
* 1566: Lowell attacked Borburata
* 1567: French pirates led by Nicolas Vallier invaded Borburata and the inhabitants had to abandon the town
* 1568: John Hawkins attacked Borburata again and sold his new cargo of slaves. The main part of that cargo was a group of 400 Africans he had captured and enslaved in Western Africa.

==== 17th century ====

In 1624 Indians to the Northwest of the Valencia Lake established the settlement of Guacara.

Attacks by English and French pirates continued during a great part of the century. In 1659, the English pirate Myngs plundered Puerto Cabello on a raid that had taken him to Cumaná and later Coro.
In 1677, Valencia was plundered by French pirates, who burnt down the &quot;Ayuntamiento&quot; or &quot;City Hall&quot; and destroyed most historical documents.

At the beginning of 1694, the governor of Venezuela, Francisco Berroterán, declared the growing Guacara, Los Guayos and San Diego &quot;doctrinas&quot;, &quot;towns of Indians&quot;.

==== 18th century ====

The Compañía Guipuzcoana de Caracas, a company organized by Basque entrepreneurs, received the monopoly of trade between Venezuela and the rest of the world. In that context, the company built in 1730 the haven of what would become Puerto Cabello.

In 1800, German scientist Alexander von Humboldt explored the area in his South American trip.

=== Independence war ===
Venezuela&#x27;s independence was declared on 19 April 1810 in the Casa de la Estrella, in Valencia. The Independence act was signed there the next year, 5 July.

Several very important battles between Spanish royalist forces and the pro-Independence troops under Bolivar took place in the Carabobo region. The most important was the Battle of Carabobo, fought on 24 June 1821 and considered a key battle in the struggle for Venezuelan independence. After the battle, what was left of the Spanish forces holed up in the San Felipe Castle in Puerto Cabello until 10 November 1823, when they surrendered and left Venezuela.

=== Post-colonial times and civil war period ===
On 6 May 1830 the Congress of Valencia takes place. There, Venezuela declared the independence from the Great Colombia and Valencia was declared Venezuela&#x27;s capital.

On 29 March 1832 the central government created the province of Barquisimeto from a part of Carabobo.

In 1858, during the March Revolution, Valencia became again capital of Venezuela.
On 27 April 1881 the central government reforms the administrative divisions and creates the state of Carabobo, which at that time had a part that later was given to Yaracuy.

=== 20th century ===

During World War II, the crews of several Italian ships and one German ship took refuge on the Puerto Cabello bay. On 31 March 1941, they set fire to their ships to prevent US troops from capturing them. A big fire in the haven of Puerto Cabello ensued. Several hundred marines were captured. Many of the Italians eventually would decide to settle down in Venezuela.

In the second half of the 20th century, Carabobo experienced a population explosion. Many immigrants arriving from Europe to Venezuela after WW2 settled down in Valencia and surrounding areas. From the 1970s onwards, immigration came mainly from other Latin American countries. The La Cabrera Tunnel was constructed in the late 1950s using the New Austrian Tunnelling method.

The first local elections for governors took place in 1988. Salas Römer became elected governor of Carabobo. In 2006 the Valencia city metro was inaugurated, making it the third city in the country with a system of this type.

== Geography ==

===Geology and relief===
Most of Carabobo State – 75% – is mountainous and part of the Coastal Range. The highest elevations are found throughout the northern part, in the western part of the state and in the southern part of Lake Valencia.

There is a central depression around Lake Valencia and towards the south the plains begin.
===Peaks===
Cobalongo or Caobal Hill, in the municipality of Puerto Cabello, in the north, is the highest point in the state, at 1990 meters above sea level. Other of the highest peaks are:

*The summit of the Copa, with 1800 in the Municipality of Montalbán.
*The summit of Borburata, with 1,680 meters above sea level in the Municipality of Puerto Cabello.
*The Carrizo Real with 1.560 masl in the Municipality of Puerto Cabello.
There is a large number of anticlines, synclines, diaclases, fractures and faults. One of the most important faults is La Victoria, located south of Valencia. This area shows some tectonic activity of moderate importance.

The mountains have very deep slopes. The slopes can exceed 80%. In the plains, the slopes are less than 1%. In the area of the Tocuyito high plateau the slopes reach 5%.

In the State of Carabobo, in front of Puerto Cabello there are a number of small islands:

*Larga Island: it is the largest, with 1855 m long. It is currently part of the San Esteban National Park.
*Santo Domingo Island: it is an island of 463 m at about 928 m west of Isla Larga.
*Ratón Island: it is an islet surrounded by corals at 1390 m southwest of Isla Santo Domingo and 230 m from the mainland.
*Del Rey Island: with 463 m long, is surrounded by corals and reefs.

In Lake Valencia there are also several islands. Some have disappeared due to the rise in the level of the lake since the 1970s. The largest island is Burro Island.

===Hydrography===
The State of Carabobo has three hydrographic basins: the Basin of the Caribbean Sea, the Basin of Lake Valencia and the Basin of the South.
====Caribbean Basin====
Rivers:

*Aguas Calientes
*Borburata
*Goaigoaza
*Moron
*Patanemo
*Sanchón
*San Esteban: this river rises at the top called Tetas de Hilaria, passes through the town of San Esteban and flows eastwards from Puerto Cabello.
*Urama: the river has its source in the mountains of the Canoabo area and runs for about 62 kilometers.
These rivers generally flow from the northern part of the Coastal Mountain Range into the Caribbean Sea.

====Basin of Lake Valencia====

Rivers:

*Cabriales River, crosses Valencia from north to south.
*Güigüe River, flows into the south of Valencia Lake.
*Guacara River, flows into the northern shore of Lake Valencia
* Los Guayos River, which flows into the north shore of Valencia Lake, is in danger of disappearing.
All these rivers used to flow into Lake Valencia, although the waters of the Cabriales River have been diverted to the Paíto.

====Basin of the South====
Rivers:

*Pao River
*Manaure River
These rivers flow into the Guárico and Portuguesa rivers, which are part of the Orinoco River basin.

=== Terrain and soil ===
Most of the region is covered by mountains that make up part of Venezuela&#x27;s Coast Mountain Range. The highest peaks are found on the north and west of the state and south of the Valencia Lake. The Cobalongo or Caobal peak is the highest point of the state, at 1990 metres above sea level.

There is a central low plain around the Valencia Lake and towards the south, where Venezuela&#x27;s Llanos start.

There is a large amount of anticlinals, synclinals, diaclases, fractures and faults. One of the most important is the one of the Victoria, south of Valencia. This area has moderate tectonic activity.

Mountains are very steep; some slopes are over 80%. On the plains, slopes are less than 1%. In the Tocuyito area, slopes can reach 5%.

There are a group of small islands near Puerto Cabello. The main ones are Isla Larga, Isla Santo Domingo, Isla Alcatraz and Isla del Rey. Isla Larga is the largest and is 1855 metres long. It makes part of the San Esteban National Park.

There are also a couple of islands on Lake Valencia. Some more have disappeared after the rise in sea level since the 1970s. &quot;Isla del Burro&quot; (&quot;Donkey Island&quot;) is the largest island of the lake.

Carabobo&#x27;s soils are fertile. Entisol soils predominate (above all fluvents and orthents). There are also threats of vertisols with suborders of usterts.

=== Fauna ===
The fauna of Carabobo mainly inhabits the tropical forests, grassland surrounding and mountainous landscapes. Though a richly inhabited land, the pollution of many of its lakes and rivers has caused the wildlife of Carabobo to be transformed and mutilated, adapting itself in order to survive. The vast majority of wildlife that remains is predominately birds due to their ability to be able to fly in search of cleaner water.

Typical fauna include the Frilled Dragon, Carabobo Tree Frogs and Valencia Piscavi.

Wild birds such as the Sugar Glider, Olive-backed Oriole, Whip-tail, Poonbill, Scrub Mullet and Mopoke.

Insects such as Forest Floor Skink are commonly found.

===Vegetation===
The State of Carabobo presents a predominantly tropical vegetation. Among the most typical species are carob trees, apamates, camorucos, caobas, cedars, guamos, carabobo palms, samanes, among others. On the coast you can find mangroves like the red Rhizophora mangle, as well as beach grapes (Coccoloba uvifera) and coconut trees (Cocos nucifera).

Alexander von Humboldt reported that in 1800 there were still large numbers of Araguatos in the forests south of Valencia. He also mentioned the presence of caimans (Caiman crocodilus) in Lake Valencia, which do not exist there today. Already by that time Alexander von Humboldt mentioned that the lake&#x27;s shores, which had been covered with forests at the time of the beginning of European colonization, were treeless.

===Parks, Green Zones and Zoos===

*San Esteban National Park: located south of Puerto Cabello and north of the Municipality of Naguanagua, the Municipality of San Diego and the Municipality of Guacara, (the latter three municipalities belonging to the Valencia Metropolitan Area).

specially the Faculty for Science and Technology.

== Economy ==
=== Industry ===

The most important industries in Carabobo include food processing, textiles, galvanizing, chemical, petrochemical, metal-mechanic, car assembling, fuel, liquified gas, ceramics and paper factories. The industrial centres are located in southern Valencia and in Guacara. The state-owned petrochemical and oil industrial complex of PDVSA (&quot;Complejo de Refinería El Palito&quot;) is located on the western coast, close to Morón. A major oil distribution centre is in Yagua.

=== Service industry ===

The region is seat to important shopping and entertainment centres. Tourism, mainly local, plays an important role.

=== Agriculture ===
Agriculture is concentrated to the north and south of Lake Valencia, as well as in the western municipalities (Bejuma, Miranda and Montalbán). In total there are some 79,450 ha used for agriculture at present.
The soils around Lake Valencia are highly productive. Unfortunately, in the northern part of the lake many agricultural areas give way to the construction of urbanizations, even though they are under protection.
Among the main agricultural products are: corn, grain legumes, cocoa, tobacco, cotton, sugar cane, vegetables, coconut and fish products.
In the State of Carabobo there are also forest resources such as carob tree, apamate, camoruco, mahogany, cedar and guamo Saman.

Carabobo is the second largest producer of chicken in Venezuela.
Cattle and pig farming is important. Many of the farms in this sector are located in the southern zone of Lake Valencia (Diego Ibarra Municipality, San Joaquin Municipality) and in the western part of the state. Currently, the Venezuelan government is developing a bilateral agreement with Argentina to increase cattle breeding in the aforementioned geographical area and thus contribute to boosting cattle development in Venezuela.

Among the mineral resources are: ceramic clay, sand, diatomite, dolomite, marble and serpentine.

===Petrochemicals===

====Moron Petrochemical Complex====
Venezuela&#x27;s main petrochemical industry is located in the state of Carabobo, specifically on the western coast of the state, (Morón), in the Petrochemical Complex of Morón (the largest in the country). In this complex is the company Petroquímica de Venezuela (Pequiven), a PDVSA subsidiary, which is dedicated to the production and commercialization of petrochemical products with export capacity, but giving priority to the domestic market.

The three main business line products on which the corporation is based, which offers more than 40 petrochemical products to the national and international markets, are Fertilizers, industrial chemicals and olefins and plastic resins.

Its links with important partners in the formation of joint ventures in which it participates have facilitated its consolidation and presence in markets in the region, as well as in other parts of the planet.

====El Palito Refinery====

The El Palito refinery is one of the largest oil refining complexes in Venezuela. It is located in the municipality of Puerto Cabello, near the town of El Palito, on the coast of the state of Carabobo, in Venezuela. It currently has a maximum processing capacity of 140,000 barrels of crude oil per day.31 This complex, controlled by the company Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), supplies fuel and derivatives to the central-western part of the country through a system of polyducts that supply the El Palito, Yagua and Barquisimeto distribution plants.

The El Palito refinery complex was the first refinery complex in Venezuela with electricity self-management and synchronous interconnection with the national electricity system. It is also where unleaded and oxygenated gasoline production began for the first time and where catalytic reforming was incorporated for the first time and where both the benzene, toluene and ortho-xylene (BTX) plant and the electrostatic precipitator were installed.
==Transport==

The State of Carabobo is connected to the rest of the country through a network of highways and roads maintained by the National Government and INVIAL. Due to problems in calculating the speed of population growth and the lack of projects aimed at the long-term development of the city of Valencia, both the streets and the main highways and avenues throughout the state are constantly congested. Carabobeños, in order to find out about the state of traffic on the Autopista Regional del Centro (ARC) that connects Valencia to other cities, listen to the Victoria FM 103.9 radio station and read the reports of the passers-by themselves on social networks such as Twitter.

The State of Carabobo has one of the best road networks in the country. Among them, the following stand out:

*Trunk 1 or Regional Highway of the center (ARC) or also called Highway Caracas – Valencia, which connects all the Great Valencia and great part of the Carabobo State with the rest of the Central Region of Venezuela like the cities of Maracay, Caracas, adjacent zones, and with the east of the country. This motorway is the busiest and most important road in Venezuela.

* Autopista Circunvalación del Sur: also known as the Southern Highway, it joins the center and south of the Municipality of Valencia, where most of the city&#x27;s population is concentrated. It starts from the San Blas Distributor, where it joins the Autopista Regional del Centro and the Autopista Circunvalación del Este, with which it has a clear continuity. Its distributors are simple, and allow access to important avenues in the city. These are the Michelena Distributor (access to Avenida Michelena), Los Samanes Distributor (access to Avenida Circunvalación de los Samanes), El Palotal Distributor (access to Avenida Las Ferias also called Avenida Bolivar Sur), and the Aranzazu Distributor (access to Avenida Aranzazu).

*José Antonio Páez Highway: also known as the Llanos Highway, it communicates the states of Barinas, Carabobo, Cojedes and Portuguesa.

===Air Transport===
The State of Carabobo has two airports: one in the capital city of Carabobo (Valencia) and the other in Puerto Cabello.

The State of Carabobo is connected with other cities and states in the country and other countries through the Arturo Michelena International Airport, located in the heart of the industrial zone, southeast of the city of Valencia. It is the second airport in order of importance in the country. It is also the most important airport in the country in terms of the volume of goods transported, occupying 60% of the nation&#x27;s air cargo. Each year it receives more than 150,000 passengers, in addition to being the boarding point for more than 160,000 national and international travelers.43 According to the IATA Airport Code corresponding to Arturo Michelena Airport, the acronym &quot;VLN&quot; is the identifying symbol of the city, both nationally and internationally. It was planned and built by the administration of Social Democratic President Jaime Lusinchi and Carabobo Governor Oscar Celli Gerbasi. The first plane to officially land at the Arturo Michelena terminal was a DC-9 from Aeropostal called &quot;El Margariteño&quot;.

The General Bartolomé Salom Airport in the city of Puerto Cabello. It provides its services efficiently to the community. It has a single two-storey building of modern style, with a series of square windows that are repeated on the upper level and on the lower level with glass doors. It has a control tower, a waiting room, administrative offices, bullfighting facilities, restrooms, travelers&#x27; services area, parking lot and green areas. It has been providing services since 1953. It was extensively renovated by the Social Democratic president, Raúl Leoni, as part of the works carried out on the Carabobo coast, including the Valencia-Puerto Cabello road.

===Valencia Metro===

The State of Carabobo has the National Metro System in the capital city of the state (Valencia) called Metro de Valencia inaugurated in 2006. It currently has the following stations:

*Monumental station
*Las Ferias station
*Palotal station
*Santa Rosa station
*Michelena station
*Lara station
*Cedeño station
*Rafael Urdaneta station
*Francisco de Miranda station

The Valencia Metro is also being expanded with 5 new stations currently under construction. Metro de Valencia will have 2 intermodal stations for its interconnection with the National Railway System, in the Simón Bolívar station of the University of Carabobo (Naguanagua) and in the Castillito Industrial Zone (San Diego).

===National Railway System===
The railway section that will link the city of Valencia with Maracay and Caracas is currently under construction. The central section Ezequiel Zamora II (Puerto Cabello – La Encrucijada) of the National Railway System is the fundamental axis of the system, designed for passengers and cargo. It provides an interconnection between the state capital (Valencia) and the Eje Industrial Este, and in turn with Puerto Cabello. In this way, the Metropolitan Area of Valencia is consolidated and extended towards the most populated urban axes of the State; and the cohesion on a larger scale of all the urban areas of the Central Region. In Carabobo, the section has 6 stations: Puerto Cabello, Naguanagua, San Diego, Guacara, San Joaquin, Mariara and an interport in San Diego.

In addition, there is currently a freight train track with little traffic from the West (departing from Barquisimeto) to Puerto Cabello. This railroad and its stations are being rehabilitated as part of the Simon Bolivar West Central Section (Passengers and Cargo), from Puerto Cabello to San Felipe (Yaracuy), Barquisimeto (Lara), Acarigua and Turen (Portuguesa).

===Surface Public Transport===
Public transport is mostly composed of small buses and buses belonging to cooperatives or institutes attached to the municipalities. This public transport system is quite criticized due to the constant violations of traffic regulations and for not respecting the areas designated for the entry or discharge of passengers. Currently, the TransCarabobo Mass Transport System is in place with several routes throughout the city.

In order to find a solution to this problem, in conjunction with the completion of the second section of Line 1 of the Valencia Metro (Av. Bolivar Norte stage), there are plans to introduce a Metrobus45 system to complement the surface transport network by connecting various areas of the city with the Valencia metro stations.

===TransCarabobo===
The Carabobo Mass Transit System, or simply TransCarabobo, is a mass transit system in the State of Carabobo in Venezuela, especially in the cities of Valencia, Guacara, Puerto Cabello and Naguanagua. It is of the BRT type. It was inaugurated on 11 July 2014 in the hands of the Government of President Nicolas Maduro as part of the Transport Mission, it started operating the same day with two routes only in the city of Valencia. Later new routes were added in the cities of Guacara, Puerto Cabello and Naguanagua.

TransCarabobo has a central station located adjacent to the Parque Recreacional del Sur, where the unit and workshop yard is located and from where the two trunk lines depart. By April 2015 new routes will be activated in the municipalities of Carlos Arvelo, Los Guayos, Diego Ibarra and Libertador.

===Interstate Public Transportation===
Bus services to other cities are provided from the Big Low Center Passenger Terminal, located in the municipality of San Diego to the east of the city of Valencia. From this terminal all buses depart to the main cities of the country, such as Caracas, Maracaibo, Barquisimeto, Puerto Cabello, Maracay, Ciudad Bolívar, Maturín, Puerto La Cruz, Barcelona, Puerto Ordaz, Coro, Mérida, San Cristóbal, Punto Fijo, Tucacas, Chichiriviche, San Carlos, Los Teques, Barinas, San Juan de los Morros, Guanare, among others.

At present, a new and modern land passenger terminal is being built, the Valencia Metropolitan Terminal, or also called San Diego Tourist Terminal, located in the Castillito Industrial Zone right in front of the current Big Low Center Terminal. This will be one of the largest and most moderate land passenger terminals in Venezuela, and will have hotel services, food fairs, and a shopping center, among other things.

===Aquatic Transportation===
The State of Carabobo has the largest and most important port in Venezuela, Puerto Cabello. Historically, it has been one of the most important since the colonial era, due to its location and natural characteristics, since the beginning of the 21st century, driven by the growing industrial development of the State of Carabobo.

<text>Avensa (&quot;Aerovías Venezolanas Sociedad Anonima&quot;) was a Venezuelan airline that operated from its hub at Simon Bolivar International Airport in Maiquetía.

At one time, it had its headquarters in the now Government-owned Torre El Chorro in Caracas and in the Torre Humboldt complex in East Caracas.

Although Avensa was reported to be in the process of economic restructuring, as of 2024, the airline has not been able to return to the skies.

==History==
Avensa was created on May 13, 1943, as a cargo airline by the Venezuelan businessman, Andres Boulton Pietri (1909-1994), and Pan American World Airways. Its first flight occurred in December 1943, flying cargo to Venezuela&#x27;s oil-rich Carteru region with Ford Trimotors and Stinson Reliants. By 1944, Avensa had started passenger flights with Lockheed 10A twins.

After World War II, DC-3 Dakotas were added to the fleet. These were the backbone of the fleet until 1955 when Convair 340 twins were introduced for a new service to Miami. Avensa had set up an extensive domestic route network by the beginning of the 1960s. The airline also flew internationally to Miami, Aruba, Jamaica and New Orleans.

Avensa merged its international routes with the international routes of Línea Aeropostal Venezolana and the resulting network was the basis for a new international Venezuelan airline called Viasa, in which Avensa had a 45% holding. Avensa purchased jet equipment in the form of a single Sud Caravelle jet in 1964. Turboprop aircraft were introduced in 1966 when the airline purchased Convair 580s. McDonnell Douglas DC-9 jets were introduced to give the airline a competitive edge. Pan Am sold its 30% holding of Avensa to the Venezuelan government in 1976, making it completely state-owned.

Later, Avensa introduced the Boeing 727-100 with two Boeing 737-200s being later introduced. A fleet renewal program was set in motion at the end of the 1980s and new Boeing 737-200s were added. Two Boeing 757-200s were also introduced in the renewal program. These new aircraft were returned during the 1990s when Avensa fell into financial difficulties and had to make cutbacks. This left the fleet with eleven aging Boeing 727s, five DC-9s, and two 737-200s at the end of the 1990s.

Avensa took over many of the international routes formerly flown by Viasa after that airline collapsed in 1997. During the late 1990s, Avensa operated wide body McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 flights to Europe including service to Lisbon, London, Madrid, Paris, Rome and Tenerife. Avensa also controlled a smaller low-cost airline called &quot;Servivensa&quot;, which primarily operated the Boeing 727 and DC-9 jets. Avensa later served only a domestic network of three cities as it attempted to reestablish services during a time of continuing financial difficulties.

The airline went into bankruptcy due to poor management in 2002, with Santa Barbara Airlines taking over its routes, although a single Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia continued to carry the Avensa name in service until it was grounded for good in 2004. Even though the airline ceased operations more than a decade ago, around Venezuela&#x27;s airports, Avensa relics can be seen everywhere: old check-in signs, rusted luggage carts, derelict airplane stairways, the name still visible through cracked blue paint around Venezuela&#x27;s airports.

<text>In mathematics and physics, solitons, topological solitons and topological defects are three closely related ideas, all of which signify structures in a physical system that are stable against perturbations. Solitons won&#x27;t decay, dissipate, disperse or evaporate in the way that ordinary waves (or solutions or structures) might. The stability arises from an obstruction to the decay, which is explained by having the soliton belong to a different topological homotopy class or cohomology class than the base physical system. More simply: it is not possible to continuously transform the system with a soliton in it, to one without it. The mathematics behind topological stability is both deep and broad, and a vast variety of systems possessing topological stability have been described. This makes categorization somewhat difficult.

== Overview ==
The original soliton was observed in the 19th century, as a solitary water wave in a barge canal. It was eventually explained by noting that the Korteweg-De Vries (KdV) equation, describing waves in water, has homotopically distinct solutions. The mechanism of Lax pairs provided the needed topological understanding.

The general characteristic needed for a topological soliton to arise is that there should be some partial differential equation (PDE) having distinct classes of solutions, with each solution class belonging to a distinct homotopy class. In many cases, this arises because the base space -- 3D space, or 4D spacetime, can be thought of as having the topology of a sphere, obtained by one-point compactification: adding a point at infinity. This is reasonable, as one is generally interested in solutions that vanish at infinity, and so are single-valued at that point. The range (codomain) of the variables in the differential equation can also be viewed as living in some compact topological space. As a result, the mapping from space(time) to the variables in the PDE is describable as a mapping from a sphere to a (different) sphere; the classes of such mappings are given by the homotopy groups of spheres.

To restate more plainly: solitons are found when one solution of the PDE cannot be continuously transformed into another; to get from one to the other would require &quot;cutting&quot; (as with scissors), but &quot;cutting&quot; is not a defined operation for solving PDE&#x27;s. The cutting analogy arises because some solitons are described as mappings formula_1, where formula_2 is the circle; the mappings arise in the circle bundle. Such maps can be thought of as winding a string around a stick: the string cannot be removed without cutting it. The most common extension of this winding analogy is to maps formula_3, where the first three-sphere formula_4 stands for compactified 3D space, while the second stands for a vector field. (A three-vector, its direction plus length, can be thought of as specifying a point on a 3-sphere. The orientation of the vector specifies a subgroup of the orthogonal group formula_5; the length fixes a point. This has a double covering by the unitary group formula_6, and formula_7.) Such maps occur in PDE&#x27;s describing vector fields.

A topological defect is perhaps the simplest way of understanding the general idea: it is a soliton that occurs in a crystalline lattice, typically studied in the context of solid state physics and materials science. The prototypical example is the screw dislocation; it is a dislocation of the lattice that spirals around. It can be moved from one location to another by pushing it around, but it cannot be removed by simple continuous deformations of the lattice. (Some screw dislocations manifest so that they are directly visible to the naked eye: these are the germanium whiskers.) The mathematical stability comes from the non-zero winding number of the map of circles formula_8 the stability of the dislocation leads to stiffness in the material containing it. One common manifestation is the repeated bending of a metal wire: this introduces more and more screw dislocations (as dislocation-anti-dislocation pairs), making the bent region increasingly stiff and brittle. Continuing to stress that region will overwhelm it with dislocations, and eventually lead to a fracture and failure of the material. This can be thought of as a phase transition, where the number of defects exceeds a critical density, allowing them to interact with one-another and &quot;connect up&quot;, and thus disconnect (fracture) the whole. The idea that critical densities of solitons can lead to phase transitions is a recurring theme. 

Vorticies in superfluids and pinned vortex tubes in type-II superconductors provide examples of circle-map type topological solitons in fluids. More abstract examples include cosmic strings; these include both vortex-like solutions to the Einstein field equations, and vortex-like solutions in more complex systems, coupling to matter and wave fields. Tornados and vorticies in air &quot;are not&quot; examples of solitons: there is no obstruction to their decay; they will dissipate after a time. The mathematical solution describing a tornado can be continuously transformed, by weakening the rotation, until there is no rotation left. The details, however, are context-dependent: the Great Red Spot of Jupiter is a cyclone, for which soliton-type ideas have been offered up to explain its multi-century stability.

Topological defects were studied as early as the 1940&#x27;s. More abstract examples arose in quantum field theory. The Skyrmion was proposed in the 1960&#x27;s as a model of the nucleon (neutron or proton) and owed its stability to the mapping formula_9. In the 1980&#x27;s, the instanton and related solutions of the Wess–Zumino–Witten models, rose to considerable popularity because these offered a non-perturbative take in a field that was otherwise dominated by perturbative calculations done with Feynmann diagrams. It provided the impetus for physicists to study the concepts of homotopy and cohomology, which were previously the exclusive domain of mathematics. Further development identified the pervasiveness of the idea: for example, the Schwarzschild solution and Kerr solution to the Einstein field equations (black holes) can be recognized as examples of topological gravitational solitons: this is the Belinski–Zakharov transform.

The terminology of a topological defect vs. a topological soliton, or even just a plain &quot;soliton&quot;, varies according to the field of academic study. Thus, the hypothesized but unobserved magnetic monopole is a physical example of the abstract mathematical setting of a monopole; much like the Skyrmion, it owes its stability to belonging to a non-trivial homotopy class for maps of 3-spheres. For the monopole, the target is the magnetic field direction, instead of the isotopic spin direction. Monopoles are usually called &quot;solitons&quot; rather than &quot;defects&quot;. Solitions are associated with topological invariants; as more than one configuration may be possible, these will be labelled with a topological charge. The word &quot;charge&quot; is used in the sense of charge in physics.

The mathematical formalism can be quite complicated. General settings for the PDE&#x27;s include fiber bundles, and the behavior of the objects themselves are often described in terms of the holonomy and the monodromy. In abstract settings such as string theory, solitons are part and parcel of the game: strings can be arranged into knots, as in knot theory, and so are stable against being untied.

In general, a (quantum) field configuration with a soliton in it will have a higher energy than the ground state or vacuum state, and thus will be called a topological excitation. Although homotopic considerations prevent the classical field from being deformed into the ground state, it is possible for such a transition to occur via quantum tunneling. In this case, higher homotopies will come into play. Thus, for example, the base excitation might be defined by a map into the spin group. If quantum tunneling erases the distinction between this and the ground state, then the next higher group of homotopies is given by the string group. If the process repeats, this results in a walk up the Postnikov tower. These are theoretical hypotheses; demonstrating such concepts in actual lab experiments is a different matter entirely.

== Formal treatment ==

The existence of a topological defect can be demonstrated whenever the boundary conditions entail the existence of homotopically distinct solutions. Typically, this occurs because the boundary on which the conditions are specified has a non-trivial homotopy group which is preserved in differential equations; the solutions to the differential equations are then topologically distinct, and are classified by their homotopy class. Topological defects are not only stable against small s, but cannot decay or be undone or be de-tangled, precisely because there is no continuous transformation that will map them (homotopically) to a uniform or &quot;trivial&quot; solution.

An &quot;ordered medium&quot; is defined as a region of space described by a function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;r&quot;) that assigns to every point in the region an &quot;order parameter&quot;, and the possible values of the order parameter space constitute an &quot;order parameter space&quot;. The homotopy theory of defects uses the fundamental group of the order parameter space of a medium to discuss the existence, stability and classifications of topological defects in that medium.

Suppose &quot;R&quot; is the order parameter space for a medium, and let &quot;G&quot; be a Lie group of transformations on &quot;R&quot;. Let &quot;H&quot; be the symmetry subgroup of &quot;G&quot; for the medium. Then, the order parameter space can be written as the Lie group quotient &quot;R&quot; = &quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot;.

If &quot;G&quot; is a universal cover for &quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot; then, it can be shown that π&quot;n&quot;(&quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot;) = π&quot;n&quot;−1(&quot;H&quot;), where π&quot;i&quot; denotes the &quot;i&quot;-th homotopy group.

Various types of defects in the medium can be characterized by elements of various homotopy groups of the order parameter space. For example, (in three dimensions), line defects correspond to elements of π1(&quot;R&quot;), point defects correspond to elements of π2(&quot;R&quot;), textures correspond to elements of π3(&quot;R&quot;). However, defects which belong to the same conjugacy class of π1(&quot;R&quot;) can be deformed continuously to each other, and hence, distinct defects correspond to distinct conjugacy classes.

Poénaru and Toulouse showed that crossing defects get entangled if and only if they are members of separate conjugacy classes of π1(&quot;R&quot;).

==Examples==

Topological defects occur in partial differential equations and are believed to drive phase transitions in condensed matter physics.

The authenticity of a topological defect depends on the nature of the vacuum in which the system will tend towards if infinite time elapses; false and true topological defects can be distinguished if the defect is in a false vacuum and a true vacuum, respectively.

===Solitary wave PDEs===

Examples include the soliton or solitary wave which occurs in exactly solvable models, such as

* screw dislocations in crystalline materials,
* Skyrmion in quantum field theory,
* Magnetic skyrmion in condensed matter,
* Topological solitons of the Wess–Zumino–Witten model.

===Lambda transitions===
Topological defects in lambda transition universality class systems including:

* Screw/edge-dislocations in liquid crystals,
* Magnetic flux &quot;tubes&quot; known as fluxons in superconductors, and
* Vortices in superfluids.

==Cosmological defects==

Topological defects, of the cosmological type, are extremely high-energy phenomena which are deemed impractical to produce in Earth-bound physics experiments. Topological defects created during the universe&#x27;s formation could theoretically be observed without significant energy expenditure.

In the Big Bang theory, the universe cools from an initial hot, dense state triggering a series of phase transitions much like what happens in condensed-matter systems such as superconductors. Certain grand unified theories predict the formation of stable topological defects in the early universe during these phase transitions.

=== Symmetry breaking ===

Depending on the nature of symmetry breaking, various solitons are believed to have formed in cosmological phase transitions in the early universe according to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. The well-known topological defects are:

*Cosmic strings are one-dimensional lines that form when an axial or cylindrical symmetry is broken.
*Domain walls, two-dimensional membranes that form when a discrete symmetry is broken at a phase transition. These walls resemble the walls of a closed-cell foam, dividing the universe into discrete cells.
*Monopoles, cube-like defects that form when a spherical symmetry is broken, are predicted to have magnetic charge, either north or south (and so are commonly called &quot;magnetic monopoles&quot;).
*Textures form when larger, more complicated symmetry groups are completely broken. They are not as localized as the other defects, and are unstable.
*Skyrmions
*Extra dimensions and higher dimensions.

Other more complex hybrids of these defect types are also possible.

As the universe expanded and cooled, symmetries in the laws of physics began breaking down in regions that spread at the speed of light; topological defects occur at the boundaries of adjacent regions. The matter composing these boundaries is in an ordered phase, which persists after the phase transition to the disordered phase is completed for the surrounding regions.

===Observation===
Topological defects have not been identified by astronomers; however, certain types are not compatible with current observations. In particular, if domain walls and monopoles were present in the observable universe, they would result in significant deviations from what astronomers can see.

Because of these observations, the formation of defects &quot;within the observable universe&quot; is highly constrained, requiring special circumstances (see Inflation (cosmology)). On the other hand, cosmic strings have been suggested as providing the initial &#x27;seed&#x27;-gravity around which the large-scale structure of the cosmos of matter has condensed. Textures are similarly benign. In late 2007, a cold spot in the cosmic microwave background provided evidence of a possible texture.
==Condensed matter==

In condensed matter physics, the theory of homotopy groups provides a natural setting for description and classification of defects in ordered systems. Topological methods have been used in several problems of condensed matter theory. Poénaru and Toulouse used topological methods to obtain a condition for line (string) defects in liquid crystals that can cross each other without entanglement. It was a non-trivial application of topology that first led to the discovery of peculiar hydrodynamic behavior in the &quot;A&quot;-phase of superfluid helium-3.

===Stable defects===

Homotopy theory is deeply related to the stability of topological defects. In the case of line defect, if the closed path can be continuously deformed into one point, the defect is not stable, and otherwise, it is stable.

Unlike in cosmology and field theory, topological defects in condensed matter have been experimentally observed. Ferromagnetic materials have regions of magnetic alignment separated by domain walls. Nematic and bi-axial nematic liquid crystals display a variety of defects including monopoles, strings, textures etc.
In crystalline solids, the most common topological defects are dislocations, which play an important role in the prediction of the mechanical properties of crystals, especially crystal plasticity.

===Topological defects in magnetic systems===
In magnetic systems, topological defects include 2D defects such as skyrmions (with integer skyrmion charge), or 3D defects such as Hopfions (with integer Hopf index). The definition can be extended to include dislocations of the helimagnetic order, such as edge dislocations and screw dislocations (that have an integer value of the Burgers vector)

<text>The Book of Deer () (Cambridge University Library, MS. Ii.6.32) is a 10th-century Latin Gospel Book with early 12th-century additions in Latin, Old Irish and Scottish Gaelic. It contains the earliest surviving Gaelic writing from Scotland.

The origin of the book is uncertain, but it is reasonable to assume that the manuscript was at Deer, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, when the marginalia were made. It may be the oldest surviving manuscript produced in Scotland (although see &quot;Book of Kells&quot;), and is notable for having possibly originated in what is now considered a Lowland area. The manuscript belongs to the category of Irish pocket gospel books, which were produced for private use rather than for church services. While the manuscripts to which the &quot;Book of Deer&quot; is closest in character are all Irish, most scholars argue for a Scottish origin, although the book was undoubtedly written by an Irish scribe. The book has 86 folios; the leaves measure 157 mm by 108 mm, the text area 108 mm by 71 mm. It is written on vellum in brown ink and is in a modern binding.

The &quot;Book of Deer&quot; has been in the ownership of the Cambridge University Library since 1715, when the library of John Moore, Bishop of Ely, was presented to the University of Cambridge by King George I.

==Contents==
The Latin text contains the complete text of the &quot;Gospel of John&quot;, portions of the Gospels of &quot;Matthew&quot;, &quot;Mark&quot; and &quot;Luke&quot;, a portion of an Office for the Visitation of the Sick, and the &quot;Apostles&#x27; Creed&quot;. It ends with a colophon in Old Irish. The Gospel texts are based on the &quot;Vulgate&quot; but contain some peculiarities unique to Irish Gospel books. The texts are written in an Irish minuscule text, apparently by a single scribe. Although the text and the script of the manuscript place it squarely in the tradition of the Irish pocket gospel, scholars have argued that the manuscript was produced in Scotland.

There are seven Scottish Gaelic texts written in blank spaces surrounding the main items. These marginalia include an account of the founding of the monastery at Deer by St Columba and St Drostan, records of five land grants to the monastery, and a record of an immunity from payment of certain dues granted to the monastery. There is also a copy of a Latin deed granted to the monastery by David I of Scotland protecting the monastery from &quot;all lay service and improper exaction&quot;. The Gaelic texts were written by as many as five different hands. These represent the earliest surviving use of Gaelic in Scotland and are important for the light they shed on the development of Gaelic in Scotland.

The &quot;Book of Deer&quot; has a number of errors. In the genealogy of Jesus in the &quot;Gospel of Luke&quot;, it records Seth as the first man and grandfather of Adam.

===Illumination===
The manuscript is illuminated. It has a complete and well thought out illumination programme. There are four full page Evangelist portraits. Each portrait faces a page of text surrounded by a border of interlace. Each of these text pages has a large decorated initial. The book opens with a full-page miniature of the four evangelists and closes with two facing pages each also with a full-page miniature of the evangelists. The final text of &quot;John&quot; ends with a half-page miniature of two men. There are small decorated initial letters throughout the text. There are also ten pages, all in the final half of the book, with marginal drawings of men, animals, or simple doodles.

==Provenance==
The manuscript derives its name from the monastery of Deer, mentioned in the Gaelic texts and the Latin Charter of King David I. The foundation at Old Deer has left no other trace of its existence, although a Cistercian monastery, Deer Abbey, founded nearby in 1219, owned some of the lands mentioned in the Gaelic texts. The manuscript came to Cambridge University Library in 1715 when the collection of John Moore, Bishop of Ely, was purchased by King George I and presented to the University. It is likely that the book was in the possession of Thomas Gale (died 1702), the headmaster of St Paul&#x27;s School, London. It is not known how the manuscript came to be in the library of Bishop Moore, but some suspect it may have been looted during the Wars of Scottish Independence in the late 13th century to early 14th century.

<doc id="351979" wikidata="Q6243358" url="?curid=351979" title="John Knox House">
<text>John Knox House, popularly known as John Knox&#x27;s House, is a historic house in Edinburgh, Scotland, reputed to have been owned and lived in by Protestant reformer John Knox during the 16th century. Although his name became associated with the house, he appears to have lived in Warriston Close where a plaque indicates the approximate site of his actual residence.

==History==

The house itself was built from 1490 onwards, featuring a fine wooden gallery and hand-painted ceiling. It had belonged to Walter Reidpath whose grandson John Arres inherited it and left it to his daughter Mariota Arres in 1556. She married James Mosman, a goldsmith. Her father-in-law John Mosman, also a goldsmith, had refashioned the crown of Scotland for James V.

In 1567 James Mosman was converting a piece of Mary, Queen of Scots&#x27; jewellery when she was imprisoned in Lochleven Castle. He remained loyal to Mary when she was exiled in England. Mosman worked in Edinburgh Castle with James Cockie making coins for Mary&#x27;s supporters who held the castle during the &#x27;Lang Siege&#x27;. The two goldsmiths valued the jewels of Mary, Queen of Scots which remained in the castle, so they could be used as security for loans.

When the Castle surrendered in August 1573, Mosman was charged with counterfeiting, for which he was hanged, quartered and beheaded. The house was forfeit for the treachery, and was given in the name of James VI of Scotland to James Carmichael younger of that ilk.

The carvings were discovered behind woodwork in 1849, and restored in 1850 by Alexander Handyside Ritchie. The building was restored again in 1984.

Over the next few centuries many decorations and paintings were added, and the house and its contents are now a museum. The building is owned by the Church of Scotland and is now administered as part of the new, adjacent Scottish Storytelling Centre.

==Association with John Knox==

The visitor&#x27;s pamphlet states that the house &quot;was Knox&#x27;s home only for a few months during the siege of Edinburgh Castle, but it is believed that he died here.&quot; It appears to have become widely accepted as &quot;John Knox&#x27;s House&quot; from the mid-19th century onwards after Victorian writers like Robert Chambers and Sir Daniel Wilson had repeated the popular tradition, first recorded c.1800, of attaching Knox&#x27;s name to it. The house looked old enough to fit the description, but no research was able to establish the rights or wrongs of the claim. Because of its visual prominence, however, it is almost certain that the building would have been familiar to Knox. The location of his actual residence is marked by a plaque in Warriston Close which lies further up the slope of the High Street. After the Disruption in the Church of Scotland in 1843, the house was bought by the new Free Church, a fact which may have strengthened belief in its association with Knox. It was condemned and due for demolition by the Town Council in 1849 but saved through the efforts of the pioneering urban conservationist Lord Cockburn.

The building immediately adjacent on the west side of the house is Moubray House. Its owner Robert Moubray also happened to be the owner of the house in Warriston&#x27;s Close where Knox lodged in the 1560s.

<text>Ezzard Mack Charles (July 7, 1921 – May 28, 1975), was an American professional boxer who competed from 1940 to 1959. Known as &quot;the Cincinnati Cobra&quot;, Charles was respected for his slick defense and precision, and is often regarded as the greatest light heavyweight of all time, and one of the greatest fighters pound for pound, having defeated numerous Hall of Fame fighters in three different weight classes. Charles was the world heavyweight champion from 1949 to 1951, and made eight successful title defenses in under two years.

After losing the world title, Charles continued to fight several top rated heavyweight contenders and made three close but unsuccessful attempts at reclaiming the heavyweight championship. Charles eventually retired from a near two decade long career with a record of 95–25–1. He was posthumously inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame as part of the inaugural class of 1990.

==Career==
Charles was born in Lawrenceville, Georgia, and grew up in Cincinnati, Ohio. Charles graduated from Woodward High School in Cincinnati where he was already becoming a well-known fighter (greatly inspired by fighters Kid Chocolate and later Joe Louis). Known as &quot;the Cincinnati Cobra&quot;, Charles fought many notable opponents in the middleweight, light heavyweight and heavyweight divisions, eventually winning the World Championship in the latter. Although he never won the Light Heavyweight title, &quot;The Ring&quot; has rated him as the greatest light heavyweight of all time.

===Career beginnings and military service===

Charles started his career as a featherweight in the amateurs, where he had a near perfect record (at one point 42-0 until a 1939 loss to Daniel Warren Eby). In 1938, he won the Diamond Belt Middleweight Championship. He followed this up in 1939 by winning the Chicago Golden Gloves tournament of champions. He won the national AAU Middleweight Championship in 1939.

Charles&#x27; professional career began on March 12, 1940, knocking out Melody Johnson in the fourth round. Charles went undefeated in his first 17 fights before being defeated by former NYSAC middleweight champion Ken Overlin. Victories over future Hall of Famers Teddy Yarosz and the heavily avoided Charley Burley had started to solidify Charles as a top contender in the middleweight division, however, during World War II, Charles served in the U.S. military, which would eventually bring his career to a halt.

===Return===
Upon his return from the war, Charles resumed his boxing career. He moved up in weight and went on to dominate the light heavyweight division, scoring many notable wins over leading light heavyweights, as well as heavyweight contenders including Archie Moore (three times), Jimmy Bivins (four times), Joey Maxim (five times) and Lloyd Marshall (twice). The hard hitting Elmer Ray delivered Charles his only loss following his return, which he later avenged. 

Shortly after his knockout of Moore in their third and final meeting, tragedy struck. On February 20, 1948, Charles fought a young contender named Sam Baroudi, knocking him out in Round 10. Baroudi died of the injuries he sustained in this bout. Charles was so devastated by the incident that he nearly gave up fighting, but a need to provide for his family along with encouragement from Baroudi&#x27;s family convinced him to continue.

=== World heavyweight champion ===
Despite being the top contender for the light heavyweight title held by Gus Lesnevich, Charles was unable to secure a title shot and decided to move up to heavyweight. After knocking out Joe Baksi and Johnny Haynes, Charles won the recently vacated National Boxing Association world heavyweight title when he outpointed top heavyweight contender Jersey Joe Walcott over 15 rounds on June 22, 1949.

Charles made three title defenses, all ending in knockout (including one over Lesnevich), before facing his idol and former heavyweight champion, Joe Louis, on September 27, 1950. Louis was quickly forced out of retirement due to troubles with the IRS, and at this stage in his career proved no match for the younger Charles, who dominated the fight and won a wide unanimous decision. Charles was now recognized as both the undisputed and Lineal world heavyweight champion.

For these achievements in such a short span of time, Charles was named Fighter of the Year twice consecutively in 1949 and 1950. Four more successful title defenses would follow against Nick Barone, Walcott, Lee Oma, and the new light heavyweight champion Joey Maxim.

===Charles vs. Marciano===

On July 18, 1951, Charles made his ninth and final title defense in a third fight against Walcott. Having been defeated twice before, Walcott was a 9:1 underdog, but scored a major upset, knocking out Charles with a perfect left hook to the jaw in the seventh round. Charles fought a rematch with Walcott the following year, but lost a controversial decision in their fourth and final bout. If Charles had won this fight, he would have become the first man in history to regain the heavyweight championship. Remaining a top contender with wins over Rex Layne, Tommy Harrison and Coley Wallace, Charles scored a second-round knockout over Bob Satterfield in a heavyweight title eliminator bout on January 13, 1954. Charles was now next in line to challenge the new Heavyweight Champion: Rocky Marciano.

The two stirring battles between Charles and Marciano are regarded as ring classics. In the first bout, held in Yankee Stadium on June 17, 1954, he valiantly took Marciano the distance, going down on points in a vintage heavyweight bout. Charles is the only man ever to last the full 15-round distance against Marciano. Marciano won a unanimous decision. Referee Ruby Goldstein scored the bout 8-5-2 in rounds for the champion. Judge Artie Aidala scored the fight 9-5-1 while judge Harold Barnes&#x27; tally was 8–6–1. In their September rematch, Charles landed a severe blow that actually split Marciano&#x27;s nose in half. Marciano&#x27;s cornermen were unable to stop the bleeding and the referee almost halted the contest until Marciano rallied with an eighth-round knockout. The fight was awarded &quot;The Ring’s&quot; 1954 Fight of the Year.

===Later career===

Unfortunately for Charles, like many boxers, financial problems forced him to continue fighting. Age and damage sustained during his career caused Charles to begin a sharp decline following his title fights. Over the next four years, he lost on points to heavyweight contenders Tommy &quot;Hurricane&quot; Jackson, Harry Matthews and heavyweight champion of Mexico, Alfredo Zuany. He was also disqualified during a fight against Dick Richardson, who later became the European heavyweight champion. Overall Charles lost 13 of his final 23 fights. Charles retired after his final bout on September 1, 1959. He finished with a final record of 95-25-1 and scored 52 knockout victories.

==Fighting Style==

&quot;Ezzard Charles. Who else has been great in every division he fought in?&quot; - James Toney

Ezzard Charles was one of the greatest ring technicians that ever laced on a pair of gloves. He could seamlessly blend between defence and offense and adapt on the fly.Charles fought side on, leaning slightly to the right to take his head off the centre from the line of attack. This increases the distance the opponent&#x27;s punch has to travel as well, giving him more time to see punches coming. This &#x27;old-school&#x27; stance was similar to those of Joe Louis, Charley Burley and Sandy Saddler. Charles parried with both of his hands and smothered opponents on the inside, even against larger men, he was fully capable of trapping the opponent&#x27;s glove to prevent them from punching on the inside. On the outside range, Charles would stalk his prey, circling leftwards and utilising his lightning-quick probing jab to attack both the head and body to properly gauge the opponent&#x27;s distance. In his prime, Ezzard would be exceedingly aggressive, often relying on his thunderous power and accuracy to win exchanges. However, some would note that after Sam Baroudi died of injuries during their 1948 fight, Charles is alleged to have become less aggressive and more cautious, although this theory is hotly debated.

Despite being best known for his counter-punching excellence, his varied skillset and high ring intelligence allowed him to excel in many situations. These qualities allowed Charles (a natural middleweight) to triumph against the tough light-heavyweights and heavyweights of the talent-rich 1940s.

==Personal==

Charles was married to Gladys Charles, the couple had three children, Ezzard Junior, Deborah and Leith. Charles was an avid fan of jazz and played a variety of instruments throughout his life. He also spoke fluent Italian, and even held a short conversation with Rocky Marciano in Italian during a televised interview shortly before their first fight. After his title fights, Charles became very close with Rocky Marciano and later was a neighbor and friend of Muhammad Ali when they both lived on 85th Street in Chicago (later in life when Charles suffered from financial difficulties and illness, both men along with other boxing celebrities hosted a fundraiser on his behalf). Charles also starred in one motion picture: &quot;Mau Mau Drums&quot;, an independent (and unreleased) jungle-adventure film shot in and around Cincinnati in 1960 by filmmaker Earl Schwieterman.

==Death==

In 1968, Charles was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease. The disease affected Charles&#x27; legs and eventually left him completely disabled. A fund raiser was held to assist Charles and many of his former opponents spoke on his behalf. Rocky Marciano in particular called Charles the bravest man he ever fought. The former boxer spent his last days in a nursing home. A 1973 commercial showed Charles in his wheelchair disabled by ALS. Charles died on May 28, 1975, in Chicago. He was buried at Burr Oak Cemetery in Alsip, Illinois.

==Legacy==

In 1976, Cincinnati honored Charles by changing the name of Lincoln Park Drive to Ezzard Charles Drive. This was the street of his residence during the height of his career.

In 2002, Charles was ranked No. 13 on &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 80 Best Fighters of the Last 80 Years.

In 2006, Ezzard Charles was named the 11th greatest fighter of all time by the IBRO (International Boxing Research Organisation).

The &quot;Cincinnati Cobra&quot; was a master boxer of extraordinary skill and ability. He had speed, agility, fast hands and excellent footwork. Charles possessed a masterful jab and was a superb combination puncher. He was at his peak as a light-heavyweight. His record is quite impressive. Against top rate opposition like Archie Moore, Charley Burley, Lloyd Marshall, Jimmy Bivins, and Joey Maxim he was an impressive 16-2 combined. Despite being a natural light-heavy he won the heavyweight title and made 9 successful title defenses. Nearly 25% of voters had Charles in the top 10. Half of the voters had him in the top 15. Two thirds of voters had him inside the top 20.

Muhammad Ali said in his own autobiography:

&quot;Ezzard Charles was a truly great fighter and champion. He was the only heavyweight champion, other than a young Sonny Liston, who I think would have really troubled me at my best.&quot;

In 2007, ESPN online ranks Ezzard Charles as the 27th greatest boxer of all time, ahead of such notable fighters as Mike Tyson, Larry Holmes and Jake LaMotta.

In 2009, &quot;Boxing&quot; magazine listed Ezzard Charles as the greatest Light Heavyweight fighter ever, ahead of the likes of Archie Moore, Bob Foster, Michael Spinks and Gene Tunney.
In 2022, a statue honoring Ezzard Charles was unveiled in the former Laurel Park in the West End neighborhood of Cincinnati. The park was renamed to Ezzard Charles Park alongside the unveiling of the statue.

Prominent boxing historian Bert Sugar listed Charles as the seventh greatest Heavyweight of all time.

<text>Anthony Newley (24 September 1931 – 14 April 1999) was an English actor, singer, songwriter, and filmmaker. A &quot;latter-day British Al Jolson&quot;, he achieved widespread success in song, and on stage and screen. &quot;One of Broadway&#x27;s greatest leading men&quot;, from 1959 to 1962 he scored a dozen entries on the UK Singles Chart, including two number one hits. Newley won the 1963 Grammy Award for Song of the Year for &quot;What Kind of Fool Am I?&quot;, sung by Sammy Davis Jr., and wrote &quot;Feeling Good&quot;, which became a signature hit for Nina Simone. His songs have been sung by a wide variety of singers including Fiona Apple, Tony Bennett, Barbra Streisand, Michael Bublé and Mariah Carey.

With songwriting partner Leslie Bricusse, Newley was nominated for an Academy Award for the film score of &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot; (1971), featuring &quot;Pure Imagination&quot;, which has been recorded by dozens of singers. He collaborated with John Barry on the title song for the James Bond film &quot;Goldfinger&quot; (1964), sung by Shirley Bassey. An &quot;icon of the early 1960s&quot;, his TV series &quot;The Strange World of Gurney Slade&quot; &quot;continues to have a cult following due to its advanced postmodern premise that [he] is trapped inside a television programme.&quot;

Described by &quot;The Guinness Book of British Hit Singles &amp; Albums&quot; as &quot;among the most innovative UK acts of the early rock years before moving into musicals and cabaret&quot;, Newley was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1989.

==Early life==
Newley was born on 24 September 1931 in the London district of Hackney to Frances Grace Newley and George Kirby, who were not married and separated soon after his birth. As &quot;the son of a single mother, who waited on him hand and foot – even after he was married&quot;, Newley &quot;mourned the absence of his real father, until, at 82, a jobbing builder made himself known.&quot; He was of Jewish descent through his maternal grandmother.

When his parents separated, his aunt and uncle brought him up through unofficial adoption. During the Second World War, he was evacuated to a foster home in the countryside safe from the Blitz aerial bombing attacks on London. For a time, he stayed with George Pescud, a retired music hall performer whom he later credited with inspiring his freedom of self-expression.

Newley attended Clapton Park Lower School, now named Mandeville Primary School, which today recognises him as an alumnus with an official plaque. Although recognised as very bright by his teachers, by the age of fourteen he had left education and was working as an office boy for an advertising agency in Fleet Street called Hannaford and Goodman.

Prompted by an advertisement in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; entitled &quot;Boy Actors Urgently Wanted&quot;, he applied to the Italia Conti Stage School, only to discover that the fees were too high. Nevertheless, after a brief audition, he was offered a job as an office boy on a salary of 30 shillings a week plus tuition at the school. While serving tea one afternoon he caught the eye of producer Geoffrey de Barkus, who cast Newley as the title character in the children&#x27;s film serial, &quot;Dusty Bates&quot; (aka, &quot;The Adventures of Dusty Bates&quot;, 1947).

==Career==
===Early career===
Newley followed &quot;Dusty Bates&quot; with an appearance as Dick Bultitude in Peter Ustinov&#x27;s &quot;Vice Versa&quot; (1948). One of the stars of the film was Kay Walsh, whose husband David Lean was about to direct a screen version of &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;. Walsh rang Lean and told him, &quot;I&#x27;ve found your Artful Dodger&quot;. During the 1950s, Newley made twenty-seven movies for J. Arthur Rank, many of them in the United States, &quot;comfortably transitioning from child to adult actor&quot;. At this time he also performed national service. During the decade, Newley appeared in many British radio programmes, including as Cyril in &quot;Floggits&quot;, which starred Elsie and Doris Waters, and also &quot;became increasingly involved with the theatre.&quot;

===Mainstream successes===
Newley starred in the 1958 film &quot;No Time to Die&quot; (also known as &quot;Tank Force&quot;). The following year, &quot;[a] turning point came with a literally star-making role in the low-budget musical film&quot;, &quot;Idol on Parade&quot;. Newley was cast as a rock singer called up for national service in a story which was somewhat inspired by Elvis Presley, who had recently been drafted for army service in the United States. The performance cemented Newley&#x27;s position as a leading man. The film also launched his career as a pop singer, with the song &quot;I&#x27;ve Waited So Long&quot; – which featured in the soundtrack – reaching number 3 in the UK charts. This was quickly followed by his number 6 hit &quot;Personality&quot; and then two number 1 hits in early 1960: &quot;Why&quot; (originally a 1959 US hit for Frankie Avalon) and &quot;Do You Mind?&quot; (written by Lionel Bart).

===TV work, music stardom===
The ATV series &quot;The Strange World of Gurney Slade&quot; (1960) starred Newley, who was also its creator. A comedy series of six half-hour programmes, it develops from a premise established in the opening scene, Newley&#x27;s character escapes from a television programme which is &quot;Gurney Slade&quot; itself. Now considered ahead of its time, the series was quickly moved from a peak-time slot.

His career both as a singer and a songwriter quickly went from strength to strength. In 1963, Newley won the Grammy Award for Song of the Year for having penned &quot;What Kind of Fool Am I?&quot; That year he also had a hit comedy album called &quot;Fool Britannia!&quot; the result of improvisational satires of the British Profumo scandal of the time by a team of Newley, his then wife Joan Collins, and Peter Sellers. It peaked at number 10 in the UK Albums Chart in October 1963. Newley sang &quot;Gonna Build a Mountain&quot;, &quot;Once in a Lifetime&quot;, &quot;On a Wonderful Day Like Today&quot;, &quot;Who Can I Turn To?&quot;, &quot;The Joker&quot;, and comic novelty songs such as &quot;That Noise&quot;, &quot;The Oompa-Loompa Song&quot; and his version of &quot;Pop Goes the Weasel&quot;. Newley also released a successful rendition of &quot;Strawberry Fair&quot;, featuring his trademark cockney accent.

Among the many hit songs Newley wrote for others are &quot;Goldfinger&quot; (the title song of the James Bond film, &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, music by John Barry), and &quot;Feeling Good&quot;, which became a hit for Nina Simone and the rock band Muse, as well as a signature song for singer Michael Bublé. His songs have been recorded by artists as diverse as Harry Connick, Jr. and Mariah Carey. Some of the many ballads he wrote, usually with Leslie Bricusse, became signature hits for Sammy Davis Jr., Shirley Bassey and Tony Bennett. The two men referred to themselves as the team of &quot;Brickman and Newburg&quot;, with &quot;Newburg&quot; concentrating mainly on the music and &quot;Brickman&quot; on the lyrics. Ian Fraser often devised their arrangements.

Despite the fact that such songs as &quot;What Kind of Fool Am I?&quot; and &quot;The Candy Man&quot; (a US Number One single for Sammy Davis Jr. and the Mike Curb Congregation in 1972) became international hits, Newley had less chart success in the United States as a recording artist, charting on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 with four singles from 1960 to 1962, none reaching higher than number 67. However, he later had a number 12 hit on the Adult Contemporary charts in 1976 with &quot;Teach the Children&quot;.

In 1967, Newley contacted renowned artist Cynthia Albritton, also known as Cynthia Plaster Caster, to see if she would like to cast him for her celebrity genitalia collection. Albritton was an admirer of Newley&#x27;s Broadway plays. On June 7, 1967, she cast Newley in her Los Angeles apartment. Albritton&#x27;s friend and fellow Newley fan Iva Turner was the &#x27;plater&#x27; for the casting process. The cast is now part of Albritton&#x27;s collection, which was acquired in 2023 by the Kinsey Institute.

===Stage and screen===
Throughout the 1960s, Newley enjoyed sustained success on London&#x27;s West End theatre, on Broadway, in Hollywood films, and on British and American television. He and Bricusse also wrote musicals. &quot;Stop the World – I Want to Get Off&quot;, in which Newley also performed, earned him nomination for a Tony Award for Best Leading Actor in a Musical. A hit in London and on Broadway, it was made into a film version in 1966, in which Newley was unable to star owing to a schedule conflict. The other musicals for which he co-wrote music and lyrics with Bricusse included &quot;The Roar of the Greasepaint – The Smell of the Crowd&quot; (1965) and &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot; (1971), based on the children&#x27;s book by Roald Dahl.

Newley played Matthew Mugg in the original &quot;Doctor Dolittle&quot; (1967), a difficult experience in part because of the hostility he endured from the lead actor, Rex Harrison, and he also played the repressed English businessman opposite Sandy Dennis in the original &quot;Sweet November&quot; (1968). He hosted Lucille Ball&#x27;s character on a whirlwind tour of London in &quot;Lucy in London&quot; (1966). He performed in the autobiographical, Fellini-esque and X-rated &quot;Can Heironymus Merkin Ever Forget Mercy Humppe and Find True Happiness?&quot; (1969), which he also directed and co-wrote with Herman Raucher. The film is &quot;a surrealist sex-drenched disaster that could only ever have been made in the more free-wheeling Sixties&quot;, and starred his then-wife, Joan Collins, who said that his self-serving behaviour prompted her to get a divorce.

Newley also directed the 1971 film &quot;Summertree&quot;, starring Michael Douglas and Brenda Vaccaro. He appeared as Quilp in &quot;Mister Quilp&quot; (1975) (based on Dickens&#x27;s &quot;The Old Curiosity Shop&quot;), for which he composed some songs (&#x27;Love Has the Longest Memory of All&#x27;). His last feature role, in the cast of the long-running British TV soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot;, was to have been a regular role, but Newley had to withdraw after a few months when his health began to fail.

Newley&#x27;s contributions to Christmas music are highlighted by his rendition of the &quot;Coventry Carol&quot; which appears on many anthologies. He also wrote and recorded a novelty Christmas song called &quot;Santa Claus is Elvis&quot;, and recorded an album of spoken poetry.

==Later life==
In the early Seventies, Newley became a tax exile and went to live in Florida. He remained active throughout that decade, particularly as a Las Vegas and Catskills Borscht Belt resort performer, game show panelist (such as on &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;) and talk show guest. Newley was &quot;among the top five cabaret acts in America for some years&quot;, but gradually his career had begun to flounder. He had taken risks that eventually led to his downfall in Hollywood. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, he worked to achieve a comeback. In the summer of 1983, Newley was the lead in &quot;Chaplin&quot;, a Broadway-bound musical he co-wrote with Stanley Ralph Ross, that never made it out of previews in Los Angeles. A planned Broadway opening was canceled after the production lost $4 million.

He briefly appeared on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; (when in town to be inducted into the Songwriters&#x27; Hall of Fame) to sing the theme to &quot;Viewer Mail&quot;. He staged a successful American tour of his &quot;Stop The World – I Want To Get Off&quot; in 1986–87. The production co-starred a then unknown Suzie Plakson, whom Newley had discovered. The tour yielded her some strong notices and led to a steady career on stage and television. He was also featured as the Mad Hatter in Irwin Allen&#x27;s all-star television adaptation of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (1985). That year he was diagnosed with cancer and had one kidney removed. Returning to England, he moved in with his mother Gracie in Esher, Surrey.

With his cancer arrested, he continued to work, appearing as a car-dealer in the soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot; and recording songs from &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; and &quot;Scrooge&quot;. He enjoyed his final popular success onstage starring in the latter musical, which showed in London and toured British cities including Liverpool, Birmingham, Bristol and Manchester, in the 1990s. In 1996, Newley &quot;made a rare nightclub appearance in New York at Rainbow and Stars, where the emotive force of his singing was undiminished&quot;. He summed up the previous two decades in remarks from the stage: &quot;I went to Vegas for 22 years, married some absolutely charming women and gave them all my money. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m here.&quot;

At the time of his death, Newley had been working on a musical of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard III&quot;. He died of renal cancer at the age of 67, soon after he had become a grandfather.

In recognition of his creative skills and body of work, Newley was elected to the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1989.

==Personal life==
Newley was married three times; firstly, to Ann Lynn (1956–1963) with whom he had one son, Simon, who died in infancy from a congenital infirmity. Following their divorce, he married Joan Collins (1963–1970). The couple had two children, Tara Newley and Alexander (Sacha) Newley. Tara became a broadcaster in Britain and Sacha is a portrait artist based in New York City.

His third marriage was to former air hostess Dareth Newly Dunn (née Rich) (1971–1989), with whom he also had a daughter and son, Shelby and Christopher. In an episode of &quot;Angela and Friends&quot; (Sky One), Tara Newley also mentioned another sister, a third living daughter of Newley. Newley&#x27;s stepfather, Ronald Gardner, reportedly later lived in Beverly Hills working as a chauffeur.

Actress Anneke Wills &quot;began a relationship with Anthony Newley&quot; when she was 17 and working with him on the TV series &quot;The Strange World of Gurney Slade&quot;. In an interview, she recalled moving in with Newley, and listening to The Goons together.

With the help of a detective, Newley searched for and found his father, George Kirby. His mother then &quot;began a correspondence with her long lost love.&quot; Newley flew him out to Los Angeles and bought them a house, where they lived until George died.

==Death and legacy==
Newley died on 14 April 1999, in Jensen Beach, Florida, from renal cancer at the age of 67. He had first been diagnosed with cancer in 1985, and it returned in 1997 and spread to his lungs and liver. He was said to have died in the arms of his companion, the designer Gina Fratini. He was survived by his five children, a granddaughter Miel, and his mother Grace, then aged 96. Since then two more grandchildren have been born: Weston (Tara&#x27;s second child) and Ava Grace (Sacha&#x27;s first, with his former wife Angela Tassoni).

===Books, recordings, tributes===
Newley&#x27;s life is the subject of a biography by Garth Bardsley called &quot;Stop the World&quot; (London: Oberon, 2003). 2013 saw the publication of &quot;Dear Tony&quot;, a book about a long-lasting friendship with a young American woman with whom he fell in love.

Amongst the many compilations of his recordings are &quot;Anthony Newley: The Decca Years&quot; (1959–1964), &quot;Once in a Lifetime: The Anthony Newley Collection&quot; (1960–71), and &quot;Anthony Newley&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot; (Deram). In May 2010, Stage Door Records released a compilation of unreleased Newley recordings entitled &quot;Newley Discovered&quot;. Produced with the Anthony Newley Society and Newley&#x27;s family, the album contains the concept recordings for Newley&#x27;s self-penned film musicals &quot;Can Heironymus Merkin Ever Forget Mercy Humppe and Find True Happiness?&quot;, &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot; and &quot;Mr. Quilp&quot;.

&quot;Pure Imagination: The World of Anthony Newley and Leslie Briccuse&quot;, devised and directed by Bruce Kimmel, opened at the Pacific Resident Theatre in Venice, California, on 7 December 2013.

===David Bowie===
Newley was an early influence on the rock musician David Bowie, who was a fan of his. The producer of Bowie&#x27;s first album, Mike Vernon, even described his first impression of Bowie as &quot;a young Anthony Newley&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; noted that Bowie&#x27;s singing on the album was &quot;delivered in an overenunciating voice that was deeply indebted to popular English actor-singer Anthony Newley.&quot;

<doc id="351999" wikidata="Q313467" url="?curid=351999" title="Hippias (tyrant)">
<text>Hippias (; 490 BC) was the last tyrant of Athens, ruling from 527 to 510 BC. He was one of the Peisistratids, a group of tyrants from the same family in ancient Greece. His father was Pisistratus, who preceded him as ruler of Athens, while his brother Hipparchus may have ruled jointly with him. Hippias also had an illegitimate son, Hegesistratus, whom he made tyrant of Sigeion. He was deposed when Cleomenes I of Sparta successfully invaded Athens and forced him to flee to Persia.

== Early life ==
Hippias was born around 570 BC as the eldest son of Pisistratus, the first tyrant of Athens. When his father was forced to flee to Eretria after insulting Megakles by having intercourse with his daughter in an indecent way, Peisistratos held counsel with his sons. Hippias suggested that they should retake the tyranny, which his father agreed to. Preparations began for which Athens fell to Peisistratos for the third time in 546 BC.

== Tyrant of Athens ==

Hippias succeeded Peisistratos as tyrant of Athens in 528/7 BC when his father died of advanced age. He was a patron of poets and craftsmen and under his rule Athens experienced a time of prosperity.

His brother Hipparchus, who may have ruled jointly with him, was murdered by Harmodius and Aristogeiton (the tyrannicides) in 514 BC during the Panathenaic festival. Aristogeiton was resentful at the advances made by Hipparchus toward Harmodius and with a small group of accomplices he had planned to kill both Hipparchus and his brother. When the plot failed and only Hipparchus was slain, the group was captured by Hippias&#x27; soldiers. The tyrant had Aristogeiton executed after torture while Harmodius was killed on the spot. It was said that Hippias thereafter became a bitter and cruel ruler over the next four years contrary to his father who was seen as moderate in his exercise of power. Hippias began executing a large number of citizens, exiling others, and imposing harsh taxes. His cruelty soon created unrest among his subjects and the Alkmeonid clan, who had previously ruled in Athens, along with other exiles attempted to free Athens from Hippias by force. As he began losing control, he sought military support from the Persians. He managed to form an alliance by marrying his daughter, Archedice, to Aiantides, son of Hippoklos, the tyrant of Lampsakos. This relationship with Hippoklos helped facilitate Hippias&#x27; access to Darius&#x27; court at Susa.

The Alcmaeonidae family of Athens, which Peisistratus had exiled in 546 BC, was concerned about Hippias forming alliances with the Persian ruling class, and began planning an invasion to depose him. Cleisthenes, an Alcmaeonidian who had served as archon in 525/4 BC before being exiled, bribed the Pythian priestess of Delphi to tell the Spartans that they should help liberate the Athenians. After a failed expedition, Cleomenes I of Sparta successfully invaded Athens in 510 BC and trapped Hippias on the Acropolis. They also took the Pisistratidae children hostage and forced Hippias to leave Athens in order to have them returned safely. Power of the city was then handed over to the Athenian magistrates thus beginning the Athenian democracy. The deposed tyrant was granted safe passage to Sigeion, from which he made the journey to Lampsakos and then to King Darius in Persia where he stayed at court.

== Attempts to reclaim the tyranny and death ==

The Spartans later concluded that a free and democratic Athens would be dangerous to Spartan power and that it would be weaker and easier to control if under a tyranny. The Spartans then attempted to recall Hippias from Persia and re-establish the tyranny. Hippias arrived, but was soon forced into exile once more when the Corinthians and the other Spartan allies expressed that they did not think a tyranny should be imposed upon any of the Greek cities. As Hippias made his way back, he was offered the cities of Anthemous and Iolkos but he refused them and made for Sigeion instead at the entrance to the Hellespont. There he made his illegitimate son, Hegesistratus, tyrant of Sigeion. Hippias returned to Asia, where he railed against the Athenians to Artaphrenes, the governor of Sardis. The Athenians discovered Hippias&#x27; intentions, however, and sent a letter to Sardis to dissuade the Persians from listening to Athenian exiles but the Persians threatened to attack Athens if they did not accept Hippias&#x27; return. Nevertheless, the Athenians preferred to remain democratic despite the danger from Persia and refused to comply.

Soon after this, the Ionian Revolt began. It was put down in 494 BC, but Darius I of Persia was intent on punishing Athens for its role in the revolt. In 490 BC Hippias, still in the service of the Persians, encouraged Darius to invade Greece and attack Athens; when Darius initiated the campaign, Hippias himself accompanied the Persian fleet and suggested Marathon as the place where the Persian invasion of Attica should begin as it was the most suitable for their cavalry. According to Herodotus, the night before the Persian fleet reached Attica, Hippias dreamt that he had sexual relations with his own mother, a dream which encouraged him greatly, since he took it as an omen that he would regain possession of his native land and die old there. But when he set foot on Greek soil, one of his teeth, which was loose due to his advanced age, fell out on to the beach after Hippias fell into a coughing and sneezing fit when directing the troops. Although he searched frantically for the tooth, he was not able to retrieve it. He believed that this fulfilled the real meaning of his dream: he would only regain this bite of his native country for his lost tooth held his share. Many Athenians were persuaded to join the battle when reminded that defeat under the Persians would lead to the re-installment of Hippias as tyrant.

Hippias is said to have died on the return journey from the Battle of Marathon, at Lemnos.

== Legacy ==
Hippias had five sons by Myrrhine, the daughter of Callias son of Hyperechides. One of these, Peisistratus, named after his grandfather, was one of the family members who held the archonship in Athens. All of his sons along with other Peisistratids joined the invading Persian army of Xerxes in 480 BC. Never again would the Peisistratids have influence in Athens.

Construction of the temple of Olympian Zeus, which Peisistratus began in the sixth century BC, continued under Hippias&#x27; reign. Building was halted, however, amidst the political turmoil that followed Hippias&#x27; exile and the temple was not completed until the time of Hadrian in 125 AD. Along with Zeus&#x27;s temple, the west side of the agora was remodeled. Hippias also took some interest in the Acropolis. The temple of Athena Polias was also renovated with propylaea added to the structure. A temple was further dedicated to the god Dionysus just to the south. There were other building projects known from Eleusis, Piraeus, and Thorikos as well.

Hippias was one of several Greek aristocrats who took refuge in the Achaemenid Empire following reversals at home, other famous ones being Themistocles, Demaratos, Gongylos, and Alcibiades. In general, these Greek aristocrats were generously welcomed by the Achaemenid kings, received land grants to support them, and ruled in various cities of Asia Minor.

<doc id="352012" wikidata="Q1644266" url="?curid=352012" title="Knights of the Round Table">
<text>The Knights of the Round Table (, , ) are the legendary knights of the fellowship of King Arthur that first appeared in the Matter of Britain literature in the mid-12th century. The Knights are a chivalric order dedicated to ensuring the peace of Arthur&#x27;s kingdom following an early warring period, entrusted in later years to undergo a mystical quest for the Holy Grail. The Round Table at which they meet is a symbol of the equality of its members, who range from sovereign royals to minor nobles.

The various Round Table stories present an assortment of knights from all over Great Britain and abroad, some of whom are even from outside of Europe. Their ranks often include Arthur&#x27;s close and distant relatives, such as Agravain, Gaheris and Yvain, as well as his reconciled former enemies, like Galehaut, Pellinore and Lot. Several of the most notable Knights of the Round Table, among them Bedivere, Gawain and Kay, are based on older characters from a host of great warriors associated with Arthur in the early Welsh tales. Some, such as Lancelot, Perceval and Tristan, feature in the roles of a protagonist or eponymous hero in various works of chivalric romance. Other well-known members of the Round Table include the holy knight Galahad, replacing Perceval as the main Grail Knight in the later stories, and Arthur&#x27;s traitorous son and nemesis Mordred.

By the end of Arthurian prose cycles (including the seminal &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;), the Round Table splits up into groups of warring factions following the revelation of Lancelot&#x27;s adultery with King Arthur&#x27;s wife, Queen Guinevere. In the same tradition, Guinevere is featured with her own personal order of young knights, known as the Queen&#x27;s Knights. Some of these romances retell the story of the Knights of the Old Table, led by Arthur&#x27;s father, Uther Pendragon, whilst other tales focus on the members of the &#x27;Grail Table&#x27;; these were the followers of ancient Christian Joseph of Arimathea, with his Grail Table later serving as the inspiration for Uther and Arthur&#x27;s subsequent Round Tables.

== Numbers of members ==
The number of the Knights of the Round Table (including King Arthur) and their names vary greatly between the versions published by different writers. The figure may range from a dozen to as many as potentially 1,600 (the number of seats at the table), the latter claimed by Layamon in his &quot;Brut&quot;. Most commonly, however, there are between about 100 and 300 seats at the table, often with one seat usually permanently empty. The number of three hundred was also chosen by King Edward III of England when he decided to create his own real-life Order of the Round Table at Windsor Castle in 1344.

In many chivalric romances there are over 100 members of Arthur&#x27;s Round Table, as with either 140 or 150 according to Thomas Malory&#x27;s popular &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, and about 140 according to &quot;Erec&quot; by Hartmann von Aue. Some sources offer much smaller numbers, such as 13 in the Didot &quot;Perceval&quot; and 60 in the count by Jean d&#x27;Outremeuse in his &quot;Ly Myreur des Histors&quot;. Others yet give higher numbers, as with 250 in the Prose &quot;Merlin&quot;, and 366 in both &quot;Li Chevaliers as Deus Espees&quot; and &quot;Perlesvaus&quot; (where this is their peak number that nevertheless had dwindled to only about 25 at the time when the story begins).

Chrétien de Troyes suggested around 500 knights in his early romance &quot;Erec and Enide&quot;. In the same work, Chrétien catalogued many of Arthur&#x27;s top knights in a series of long hierarchical lists of names. These rankings are different in each of the surviving manuscripts, none of which is believed to be the author&#x27;s original version.

While not mentioning the Round Table as such, one of the late Welsh Triads lists 24 extraordinary knights permanently living in Arthur&#x27;s court, mixing romance characters with several Arthur&#x27;s warriors from a largely lost Welsh tradition considered to originate in old Celtic folklore. Companions of Arthur numbering 24 also appear in the Welsh tale of &quot;Peredur son of Efrawg&quot;.

== Selected members ==
=== Aglovale ===
Aglovale de Galis (&quot;Agglovale&quot;, &quot;Aglaval[e]&quot;, &quot;Agloval&quot;, &quot;Aglován&quot;, &quot;Aglovaus&quot;, etc.; -&quot;de Galles&quot;, -&quot;le Gallois&quot;) is the eldest legitimate son of King Pellinore of Galis (Wales), introduced in the Vulgate &quot;Lancelot&quot;. Like his father and his brothers (who may include Drian, Lamorak, the original Grail hero Perceval, and Tor), he is a Knight of the Round Table. According to the Post Vulgate Cycle, and Thomas Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, Aglovale is the one who brings his long lost brother Percival to Camelot to be knighted after meeting him by chance in Perceval&#x27;s woods. In an alternate account in the &quot;Livre d&#x27;Artus&quot; version of the Vulgate &quot;Merlin&quot;, the young Agloval has all of his fourteen brothers killed during the Saxon wars by the forces of King Rions&#x27; relative King Agrippa in their attack on his mother&#x27;s domain.

In the &quot;Livre d&#x27;Artus&quot;, Agloval then accompanies Gawain and Sagramore in leading an army that defeats the invaders, personally slaying Agrippa but suffering severe wounds. In the Third (Manessier&#x27;s) Continuation of &quot;Perceval&quot;, Agloval dies seven years after Percival became the Grail King, causing Percival&#x27;s retirement to a hermitage to grieve for his final ten years. In the Vulgate Cycle, Aglovale dies accidentally at Gawain&#x27;s hand during the Quest for the Holy Grail. However, the rewrite in the Post-Vulgate &quot;Queste&quot; turns it into a deliberate murder, a part of the Orkney clan&#x27;s long vendetta for the death of King Lot. In Malory, he is among the knights charged by King Arthur with defending the execution of Guinevere, and is killed by unknown hand during the bloody melee when Lancelot and his men rescue the queen.

Aglovale appears prominently in the Dutch romance &quot;Moriaen&quot;, in which Acglavael visits Moorish lands in Africa and meets a Christian princess whom he conceives a child with. He returns home and, thirteen years later, his son Morien comes to find him after which they both return to Morien&#x27;s lands. In modern works, Aglovale is the eponymous protagonist of Clemence Housman&#x27;s 1905 novel &quot;The Life of Sir Aglovale de Galis&quot;. 

=== Arthur the Less ===
Arthur the Less or Arthur the Little (&quot;Arthur le Petit&quot;) is an illegitimate son of King Arthur (&quot;Arthur the Great&quot;) found only in the Post-Vulgate Cycle. After Arthur forces himself on a daughter of a knight named Tanas, he orders the child to be named either Guenevere or Arthur the Less. Having been abandoned and raised by a foster mother, the boy appears at Arthur&#x27;s court on the eve of the Grail Quest when his arrival is miraculously prophesied at the Round Table. He is knighted by Tristan and soon proves to be superior to even Gawain and Percival, defeating both of them. However, he is publicly known only as the Unknown Knight, keeping his lineage secret as to not shame his father with the story of his mother&#x27;s rape. Loyal to King Arthur (who is eventually informed about his son&#x27;s identity by Morgan), he fights in the late wars against domestic and foreign enemies, and is one of Galahad&#x27;s companions during the Grail Quest. After his father&#x27;s death at Salisbury, Arthur the Less is a candidate for the heir of throne of Logres, however, he obsessively hates Lancelot&#x27;s renegade faction, blaming them for the disaster. When soon defeated by Bleoberis in a duel to the death, he curses the entire kingdom in his dying breath. His curse manifests itself through King Mark&#x27;s devastating invasion which destroys almost all remnants of King Arthur&#x27;s rule.

=== Bleoberis ===
Bleoberis de Ganis is a Knight of the Round Table from the land of Ganis (variants &quot;Ganes&quot;, &quot;Gannes&quot;, &quot;Gaunes&quot;, &quot;Gaunnes&quot;; meaning probably Gaul or perhaps Vannes), who was first mentioned by Chrétien de Troyes in his &quot;Erec and Enide&quot;, named therein as Bliobleheris (Wendelin Foerster&#x27;s choice; manuscript variants &quot;Bleob[l]eris&quot;, &quot;Bleosblieris&quot;, &quot;Blioberis&quot;, &quot;Bliobeheri&quot;, &quot;Blios Blieris&quot;). He has since appeared by a large number of variations of his name and character in many subsequent works, including as split between Barant le Apres (&quot;Berrant&quot;) and Bleoberys (&quot;Bleoberis&quot;, &quot;Bleoboris&quot;, &quot;Bleoheris&quot;) in Thomas Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;; as Bleobleheris (&quot;Bliobliheri&quot;) and Bleheris in respectively the First and the Second Continuation of &quot;Perceval&quot;; as two different characters named Bleheris and Blidoblidas in &#x27;; as split between Bleherris and Bleoberiis in &quot;Of Arthour and of Merlin&quot;; as Bleoris in Henry Lovelich&#x27;s &quot;Merlin&quot;; as Bleos von Bliriers in &quot;Diu Crône&quot;; as Bleriz in &#x27;; as Bliobleherin in the German &quot;Erec&quot;; as Bliobleeris in &quot;La Vengeance Raguidel&quot;; as Bliobleris de Gannes (&quot;Biblioberis&quot;, &quot;Bla[h]aris&quot;, &quot;Bleob[l]eris&quot;, &quot;Bleobleheris&quot;, &quot;Bleosblieris&quot;, &quot;Bliaires&quot;, &quot;Blihoble[h]eris&quot;, &quot;Bliobeheri&quot;, &quot;Blioberis&quot;, &quot;Blyob[l]eris&quot;; -&quot;de Ga[u]n[n]es&quot;) in the 13th-century French prose cycles; as Blioblieris in both &quot;Le Bel Inconnu&quot; and &quot;Wigalois&quot;; as Bréri in &quot;Tristan&quot; by Thomas of Britain; as Briobris in &quot;La Tavola Ritonda&quot;; as Pleherin in &quot;Tristrant&quot;; and as Plihopliherî (&quot;Plihophiheri&quot;, &quot;Plihopliheri&quot;) in &quot;Parzival&quot;.

Bleoberis features as a major character in the later romances from the French prose cycles and their adaptations, in which he is portrayed as one of the cousins of the hero Lancelot. There he is son of Nestor de Gaunes and godson of Lancelot&#x27;s father King Bors, as well as brother of his fellow Round Table companion Blamo[u]r[e] (&quot;Blanor[e]&quot;). In the Vulgate &quot;Merlin&quot;, the &quot;Livre d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, and &quot;Arthour and Merlin&quot;, Bleoberis fights alongside his brother Blamoure in the wars against the rebel kings at Bedegraine, against the Saxons at Cameliard, and against King Claudas in the Wasteland; the latter earns him his nickname &quot;of the Wasteland&quot; (de la Deserte). In both the Vulgate and Post-Vulgate versions of the &quot;Queste&quot;, as well as in the Prose &quot;Tristan&quot;, he participates in the Grail Quest. In Malory, he is the lord of the Castle of Gannis in Britain. In the Vulgate and the works based on it, Lancelot eventually makes him the Duke of Poitiers for his part in saving Guinevere, after which Bleoberis becomes an important leader in Lancelot&#x27;s war against Arthur and Gawain. In the Post-Vulgate &quot;Mort&quot;, he returns to Britain and arrives at Salisbury after the battle to destroy the corpse of Mordred and build the Tower of the Dead. While searching for Lancelot, he meets Arthur&#x27;s vengeful son Arthur the Less (himself a member of the Round Table as the Unknown Knight), whom he kills in self-defence. Finding Lancelot at a hermitage with the former Archbishop of Canterbury, he joins them; after Lancelot&#x27;s death, Bleoberis buries his body at Joyous Gard. In Malory, Bleoberis and his brother first live as monks together with Lancelot and the rest of his kinsmen at Glastonbury Tor, then leave on a crusade and together die in battle in Jerusalem.

He also appears in some tales as an opponent whom the story&#x27;s hero must overcome during the course of a quest or an adventure. In the Prose &quot;Tristan&quot;, Bleoberis abducts Segwarides&#x27; wife from King Mark&#x27;s court, and fights for her against first Segwarides and later the protagonist Tristan. In &quot;Wigalois&quot;, one of the challenges faced by the protagonist Wigalois (Gawain&#x27;s son, Gingalain) is to defeat Bleoberis, the fierce guardian of the Perilous Ford. He is similarly the first adversary conquered by Gawain&#x27;s son Guinglan in &quot;Le Bel Inconnu&quot;. In &quot;Parzival&quot;, Orgeluse&#x27;s suitor boasts of having him either slain or defeated but spared (depending on interpretation of the text). In &quot;Tristrant&quot;, he is one of King Mark&#x27;s vassals and an enemy of Tristan, who brutally kills him during his escape from Mark&#x27;s court.

His name may have been derived from the 12th-century Welsh storyteller known in French as Bledhericus, Bleheris or Blihis (Blihos) Bliheris (possibly Bledri ap Cydifor), who is mentioned in several texts, including being credited by both Thomas of Britain and Wauchier de Denain as the original source of their early Arthurian poems. References to the narrative authority of one Master Blihis (&quot;Maistre Blihis&quot;) repeat throughout the &quot;Elucidation&quot;, wherein the character named Blihos Bliheris also appears appears as knight.

=== Brandelis ===
Brandelis (&quot;Brandalus&quot;, &quot;Brandel&quot;, &quot;Brandeles&quot;, &quot;Brandellis&quot;, &quot;Brendalis&quot;, etc.) is the name of a number of Arthurian romance characters, including multiple Knights of the Round Table from the French prose tradition. As in the case of several other Arthurian characters, such as King Ban, they might have been derived from the Welsh mythology&#x27;s figure of Brân.

The best known of these was originally known as Bran de Lis (&quot;Brans&quot;, &quot;Bras&quot;, -&quot;de Lys&quot;), a character related to one of the mothers of the illegitimate sons of Gawain. Bran first appears in the First Continuation of Chrétien&#x27;s &quot;Perceval&quot; as one of the brothers of Guilorete (&quot;Gloriete&quot;) of the Castle Lis, the mother of Gawain&#x27;s son Lionel (&quot;Lioniaus&quot;). After Gawain had slain Bran&#x27;s father Norroiz (&quot;Norrois&quot;, also &quot;Yder de Lis&quot;) and two of his brothers (Meliant and Guilorete) in the previous duels in the long feud against him for seducing Guilorete, Bran is about to fight him as well, but they are stopped by Arthur and later become friends. This story is retold in &quot;The Jeaste of Sir Gawain&quot;, where he appears as Brandles (the name also used for one of Arthur&#x27;s knights in &quot;Sir Gawain and the Carle of Carlisle&quot;), and in the Scottish &quot;Golagros and Gawane&quot;, where he is called Spinagros. In &quot;Perlesvaus&quot;, Brandalus (&quot;Brun[s] Brandelis&quot;) de Gales (of Wales) is one of Perceval&#x27;s uncles along with King Alain, whose name (and title) is shared with the father of Floree, mother of Gawain&#x27;s son Guinglain in the Vulgate Cycle. In Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, Brandiles (&quot;Brandyles&quot;) is brother of the mother of Gawain&#x27;s sons (and later his companions at the Round Table) Gingalin, Lovel and Florence.

Sir Brandeliz (&quot;Brandalis&quot;, &quot;Brandelis&quot;, &quot;Braudaliz&quot;) appears in multiple episodes through the Vulgate Cycle (some of which are included in &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;), participating in the quests (including the quest for the Grail) and in the wars against Claudas and Galahaut. In the prose cycles, he dies while fighting either against Lancelot during the latter&#x27;s rescue of the condemned Guinevere or against Mordred in the final battle. In the standalone romance &quot;Claris et Laris&quot;, Brandaliz is one of the eleven protagonists other than the eponymous duo; here he is a friend of Claris who, with the help of Merlin, rescues Laris from the prison of the Danish king Tallas among his other acts. In both narratives, he is also repeatedly freed from enemy captivity by the other heroes, including Gawain, Lancelot, and Claris. The Vulgate &quot;Lancelot&quot; story of Gaheriet&#x27;s rescue of Brandeliz and his lady might have been rewritten by Malory as an early episode of his &quot;Tale of Sir Gareth&quot;, the fourth book of &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;. In the Prose &quot;Tristan&quot;, Brandeliz is a Knight of the Round Table from Cornwall, not Wales.

The Vulgate Cycle also features a different Knight of the Round Table other than Sir Brandeliz, a minor character of Duke Brandelis de Taningues (&quot;Brandeban, Brandeharz&quot;, &quot;Brandelz&quot;, &quot;-de Tranurgor&quot;). Yet another Knight of the Round Table named Brandelis (Brandelis le fils Lac, that is &quot;son of Lac&quot;) appears as brother of Erec in &quot;Palamedes&quot; and the late Italian romance &quot;I Due Tristani&quot;. The late French romance &quot;Ysaïe le Triste&quot; features Brandalis&#x27; own son, Brandor de Gaunes (of Wales). In the Didot &quot;Perceval&quot;, Peredur&#x27;s uncle is one Brendalis of Wales who also has a brother named Brwns Brandalis.

A few other Brandalis characters are clearly unrelated to the Round Table, such as that of the Vulgate&#x27;s Saxon king Brandalis (&quot;Braundalis&quot;, &quot;Maundalis&quot;). However, some scholars have connected Bran de Lis with the villains Brian des Isles (Brian of the Isles) from &quot;Perlesvaus&quot; and Brandin (&quot;Branduz&quot;) des Isles from the Vulgate &quot;Lancelot&quot;, as well as to King Brandelidelin from an early German Arthurian romance &quot;Parzival&quot;, as possibly identical in origin. 

=== Calogrenant ===
Calogrenant, sometimes known in English as Colgrevance and in German (&quot;Diu Crône&quot;) as Kalogrenant, among many other variants (including &quot;Calogrenan[s/z]&quot;, &quot;Calogrevant&quot;, &quot;Calogrinant&quot;, &quot;Colgrevaunce&quot;, &quot;Galogrinans&quot;, &quot;Kalebrant&quot;, &quot;Kalocreant&quot;, &quot;Qualogrenans&quot;), is a Knight of the Round Table and cousin to Yvain. His character has been derived from the Welsh mythological hero Cynon ap Clydno, usually the lover of Owain mab Urien&#x27;s sister Morvydd; although in &quot;Owain, or the Lady of the Fountain&quot;, Cynon is stated to be the son of Clydno, possibly connected to Clyddno Eiddin. Roger Sherman Loomis and some other scholars speculated that Calogrenant was used specifically as a foil for Kay in some lost early version of Yvain&#x27;s story. The 12th-century author Chrétien de Troyes characterized him as everything Kay is not: polite, respectful, eloquent, and well-mannered. By this theory, his name can be deconstructed to &quot;Cai lo grenant&quot;, or &quot;Cai the grumbler&quot;, which would represent another opposite characteristic of Kay, who was famous for his bitter sarcasm.

Calogrenant first appears in Chrétien&#x27;s &quot;Yvain, the Knight of the Lion&quot;, telling a story to a group of knights and Queen Guinevere. He describes an adventure he had in the forest of Brocéliande, in which there was a magic spring that could summon a large storm. Calogrenant reached the spring and summoned the storm, after which a knight named Esclados attacked and defeated him. Yvain is upset that Calogrenant never told him of this defeat, and sets out to avenge him, embarking on the adventure that sets up the remainder of events in the romance.

Calogrenant appears later in the &quot;Lancelot-Grail&quot; cycle, though his kinship to Yvain is not as clear as in Chrétien. He dies during the Grail Quest while trying to keep Lionel from killing his own brother, Bors. Bors had faced a dilemma over whom to rescue between Lionel, who was getting beaten with thorns by two rogue knights, and a maiden who had just been abducted, and chose the maiden over his brother. Lionel was not pleased by this, and attacked Bors the next time he saw him. A hermit tried to intervene, but was killed accidentally in the process, and Calogrenant stepped in. Bors refuses fight his brother, who slays Calogrenant before attacking Bors; however, God intervenes and renders him immobile. Thomas Malory calls him Colgrevance and recounts his death at Lionel&#x27;s hands in &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, but also includes another one later in the narrative. Despite having died on the Grail quest, Colgrevance reappears as one of the twelve knights who help Agravaine and Mordred trap Lancelot and Guinevere together in the queen&#x27;s chambers. Lancelot has neither armour nor weapons, but manages to pull Colgrevance into the room and kills him; he then uses Colgrevance&#x27;s sword to defeat the rest of Mordred&#x27;s companions.

=== Claudin ===
Prince Claudin (&quot;Claudine&quot;, &quot;Claudyne&quot;, &quot;Claudino&quot;) is the son of the Frankish King Claudas of the Wasteland (&quot;de la Deserte&quot;) who appears in the &quot;Lancelot-Grail&quot; prose cycle, the Prose &quot;Tristan&quot;, the Post-Vulgate Cycle, and &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;. His father, who he fights for, is a major villain during King Arthur&#x27;s early reign. However, when Claudas eventually loses the war and flees to Rome, Claudin surrenders and defects to Arthur, who makes him a member of the Round Table. During the Grail Quest, Claudin is one of the companions of Bors the Younger, Galahad and Perceval in Corbenic.

=== Cligès ===
Cligès is the title hero of Chrétien de Troyes&#x27; French poem &quot;Cligès&quot; (and its foreign versions). There, he is an offspring of Arthur&#x27;s niece Soredamors and Alexander, a son of the Greek (Byzantine) Emperor. Following his adventures, Cliges eventually marries Fenice, a daughter of the German Emperor, and becomes the Greek Emperor himself.

As Cligés (&quot;Clicés&quot;, &quot;Clies&quot;, &quot;Clygés&quot;), he also appears in some other French Arthurian romances, including in the First Continuation of Chrétien&#x27;s &quot;Perceval&quot; (where his father is named King Lac) and in &quot;Claris et Laris&quot;. In the &quot;Romanz du reis Yder&quot;, he serves Queen Guenloie (Guinevere) until he is expelled from her court after he criticizes her love for Yder (who later promises to reconcile them). In &#x27;, he hails from Greece and participates in the quest to conquer Rigomer Castle as one of Gawain&#x27;s many companions; he also defeats the undead knight in his own episode. As Clias the Greek (&quot;der Grieche Clîas&quot;), he has a role in the German &quot;Parzival&quot;. Thomas Malory&#x27;s Urry list calls him Sir Clegis&quot;&#x27; (despite a similar name, Clegis is not in any way connected with the English &quot;Sir Cleges&quot;, the hero of a completely different story set in the times of Arthur&#x27;s father Uther Pendragon).

=== Dodinel ===
Dodinel (&quot;Dodinas&quot;, &quot;Dodine[i]s&quot;, &quot;Dôdînes&quot;, &quot;Dodinia[u]s&quot;, &quot;Dodin[s]&quot;, &quot;Dodynas&quot;, &quot;Dodynel&quot;, &quot;Didones&quot;, &quot;Dydonel[l]&quot;, &quot;Lionel&quot;, etc.) le Sauvage (&quot;le Savage&quot;, &quot;le Salvage&quot;, &quot;li Sauvages&quot;, &quot;li Salvages&quot;, &quot;el Salvaje&quot;, &quot;der Wilde&quot;, etc.), variously translated to English as the Wild, the Wildman, or the Savage (sometimes also as the descriptive &quot;impetuous&quot; or &quot;fierce&quot;), is a Knight of the Round Table found in a great many works of Arthurian romance, typically featured as a well-known knight yet merely a figurant type of a character, and without a common role. He is nevertheless important in several of such works, including the Third Continuation of &quot;Perceval&quot;, the Vulgate &quot;Lancelot&quot;, the Post-Vulgate &quot;Merlin&quot;, the &quot;Livre d&#x27;Artus&quot;, the Prose &quot;Tristan&quot;, and &quot;Claris et Laris&quot;.

Dodinel is introduced in Chrétien de Troyes&#x27; &quot;Erec et Enide&quot;, being named there as the ninth best of King Arthur&#x27;s knights, albeit noted as a rude one. Dodinel is also listed among the top knights of Arthur in Chrétien&#x27;s &quot;Yvain&quot; as well as in &quot;Sir Gawaine and the Green Knight&quot;, while &quot;The Knight of the Two Swords&quot; describes him as a &quot;truly exceptional ... man of many virtues.&quot; He might have been originally identical with Percival, which would explain his characteristic epiteth as meaning a man from the woods (wilderness). However, the only possible trace of such motif can be found in the German &quot;Lanzelet&quot;, in which Dodines lives a double life: as an enchanter owning a magic horse and dwelling near the dangerous Shrieking Marsh (&quot;Schreiende Moos&quot;) in the summer, and as a knight in Arthur&#x27;s lands in the winter.

As with his other characteristics, Dodinel&#x27;s family relations are variably told. In the Vulgate &quot;Merlin&quot; Continuation, he is portrayed as an illegitimate son of either King Brandegorre or King Bélinant (&quot;Balinant&quot;, &quot;Belinans&quot;, &quot;Belynans&quot;; possibly based on the Celtic god Belinus) de Sorgales (&quot;of South Wales&quot;; Norgales / North Wales in the Vulgate &quot;Lancelot&quot;) and Eglatine (&quot;Eglantine&quot;, &quot;Eglante&quot;, &quot;Eglente&quot;), and cousin of Galeschin. In the &quot;Lancelot en prose&quot;, he is son of King Nantres and Queen Blasine (Arthur&#x27;s sister), and brother of Galescin. In the Huth-&quot;Merlin&quot;, he is son of Balin&#x27;s brother Balan (&quot;Balaan le Sauvage&quot;). In the Didot-&quot;Perceval&quot;, he is son of the Lady of Malehaut (&quot;Dame de Malohaut&quot;). In &quot;Parzival&quot;, he has a brother called Taurian the Wild (&quot;der Wilde&quot;).

In the Third Continuation of Chrétien&#x27;s &quot;Perceval&quot;, one of the six episodes of Gawain&#x27;s adventures relate his rescue of the &quot;handsome and valiant&quot; Dodinel (&quot;Dodinal&quot;) from a prison and his lover from a pyre, the latter then also again saved by Perceval. Dodinel is prominent in &quot;Claris et Laris&quot;, portrayed there as a comical side story character, a Dinadan-like humorously anti-chivalric knight, one who avoids dangerous combat in his wanderings and once escapes from a captivity by posing as a minstrel. He and Dinadan are themselves friends in the &quot;Meliadus&quot; Compilation; in the &quot;Marvels of Rigomer&quot;, Dodinel is one of Gawain&#x27;s quest companions. Thomas Malory in his &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, following some of the Dodinel material from the Vulgate &quot;Lancelot&quot; as well as his portrayal in the Prose &quot;Tristan&quot;, has him (named as Dodinas le Savage in the Winchester Manuscript) as a recurring companion of Sagramore and, early in his career, as one of the Guinevere&#x27;s own ten knights.

His &#x27;biography&#x27; can be found in the French prose cycles. In the Vulgate &quot;Merlin&quot; and the &quot;Livre d&#x27;Artus&quot;, the young teenage Dodinel defects to Arthur early in the king&#x27;s reign, opposing his own family. In the &quot;Livre&quot;, he kills the Saxon king Mathmas at the Battle of Clarence (Badon). Having been knighted by Arthur, he joins the Queen&#x27;s Knights and eventually the Round Table. The Vulgate &quot;Lancelot&quot;, besides telling the stories of Lancelot&#x27;s rescues of the captive Dodinel on multiple occasions, has him as one of the only five knights who cross the perilous bridge into Sorelois alive (besides Gawain, Meliant, Yder and Arthur). In the Vulgate &quot;Queste&quot;, he is one of the Grail knights in Galahad&#x27;s company. In the Post-Vulgate, Lamorak is slain by Gawain and his brothers when he is injured following an earlier fight with Dodinel. In the end, Dodinel dies fighting against Mordred&#x27;s forces at the Battle of Salisbury Plain (Camlann).

In Italy, he is called Dondinello and its variants, usually with no epithet (except in the case of &quot;Oddinello le Salvaggio&quot; in the &quot;Tristano Riccardiano&quot;). In his unusual characterization in &quot;Chantari di Lancelotto&quot;, Dodinel (&quot;Dudinello&quot;) is a villain who joins up with Mordred to conspire against Lancelot. &quot;Cantari di Carduino&quot;, a Fair Unknown type epic poem possibly based on a lost Dodinel romance, tells the story of his eponymous son Carduino&#x27;s vengeance against the clan of Gawain for having his father fatally poisoned by the jealous lords including Mordred and Augerisse (probably Gaheris), as well as of Carduino&#x27;s other adventures.

=== Drian ===
Drian (&quot;Doryan&quot;, &quot;Driant&quot;, &quot;Durnor&quot;) is one of King Pellinore&#x27;s sons out of wedlock. He is most prominent in the Prose &quot;Tristan&quot; which describes him as one of the very best of the Knights, alongside Galahad, Lancelot, Palamedes, and his own brother Lamorak. There, Drian and Lamorak are hated by Gawain for being sons of Pellinore and for being superior knights to Gawain. Drian dies when he fights three of King Lot&#x27;s sons, unhorsing Agravain and Mordred before being mortally wounded and left for dead by Gawain; Lamorak dies soon afterwards while trying to avenge him.

Drian is called Dornar (&quot;Durnor[e]&quot;) by Thomas Malory in &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, where he is also killed by Gawain. He appears alongside two knights named Darnarde and Dryaun (&quot;Dryaunt&quot;, &quot;Tryan&quot;), both of them also derived from the French Drian. Malory splits Drian&#x27;s adventures from the Prose &quot;Tristan&quot; between the latter two: Dryaun guards a bridge with his brother Alain (one of Drian&#x27;s other brothers), jousting the passing knights; Darnarde visits King Mark&#x27;s court with Lamorak, where they defeat Mark and all of his knights but Tristan. Darnarde is eventually killed alongside his brothers, Aglovale and Tor, when Lancelot rescues Queen Guinevere from the stake.

=== Elyan ===
Elyan the White or Helyan le Blanc (also &quot;Elain&quot;, &quot;Elayn&quot;, &quot;Helain&quot;, &quot;Hellaine&quot;, &quot;Helin&quot;; -&quot;le Blank&quot;, -&quot;the Pale&quot;) is son of Bors the Younger in the prose romance tradition of &quot;Lancelot-Grail&quot; (Vulgate Cycle). His mother, Claire, has tricked Bors into sleeping with her using a magic ring (the only time Bors broke his vow of chastity). Claire is daughter of British king Brandegore (&quot;Brandegorre&quot;, &quot;Brandegoris&quot;) and also half-sister of Sagramore, and their shared mother is daughter of the Eastern Roman Emperor. At the age of 15, Elyan is brought to Arthur&#x27;s court by Bors. He then becomes known as an excellent knight and is accepted as a member to the Round Table. True to his lineage, Elyan eventually becomes Emperor of Constantinople himself.

Elyan&#x27;s adventures are different the Post-Vulgate &quot;Queste&quot;, as well as the expanded version of the Prose &quot;Tristan&quot;, where he takes a vacant Round Table seat that had belonged to Dragan (&quot;Dagarius&quot;) after the latter knight&#x27;s death by Tristan. He later helps his cousin Lancelot rescue Guinevere after their affair is exposed, and then joins him in exile during their war with Arthur.

Elyan should not be confused with Elians (&quot;Eliant&quot;, &quot;Elianz&quot;), a Knight of the Round Table from Ireland who occupied Lancelot&#x27;s vacant seat in both the Vulgate and Post-Vulgate versions of the &quot;Mort Artu&quot;. A modern character inspired by Elyan the White was portrayed by Nigerian actor Adetomiwa Edun as Guinevere&#x27;s brother in the 2008 television series &quot;Merlin&quot;. 

=== Erec ===
Erec (French &quot;Erech&quot;, &quot;Eric&quot;, &quot;Herec&quot;, &quot;Heret&quot;; German &quot;Eres&quot;; Italian &quot;Arecco&quot;; Norse &quot;Erex&quot;), the son of King Lac, is most famous as the protagonist in Chrétien de Troyes&#x27; first romance, &quot;Erec and Enide&quot;, later retold in &quot;Erec&quot; and other versions. Because of &quot;Erec and Enide&quot;″s connection to the Welsh &quot;Geraint and Enid&quot;, Erec and Geraint are often conflated or confused. Erec&#x27;s name itself may be derived from &quot;Guerec&quot;, the Breton version of Gweir, the name of several of Arthur&#x27;s warriors and relatives in the different early Welsh tales (possibly the prototype of Gaheris and consequently also Gareth).

In Chrétien&#x27;s story, Erec meets his future wife Enide while on a quest to defeat a knight who had mistreated one of Queen Guinevere&#x27;s servants. The two fall in love and marry, but rumours spread that Erec no longer cares for knighthood or anything else besides his domestic life. Enide cries about these rumours, causing Erec to prove his abilities, both to himself and to his wife, through a test of Enide&#x27;s love for him. Erec has her accompany him on a long, tortuous trip where she is forbidden to speak to him, after which they reconcile. When Erec&#x27;s father Lac dies, Erec inherits his kingdom. The Norse &quot;Erex Saga&quot; gives him two sons, named Llac and Odus, who later both become kings. The story of Erec and Enide is also retold within the Prose &quot;Tristan&quot;.

Enide is entirely absent from the Prose &quot;Erec&quot; segment of the Post-Vulgate Cycle (beginning in &quot;La Folie Lancelot&quot; and concluded in the P-V &quot;Queste&quot;), in which Erec&#x27;s mother&#x27;s enchantment makes him immune to magic. His acts include saving Bors from the enchanter Mabon; he also has a cousin named Driadam, whose death begins Erec&#x27;s feud with the young Mordred. In the Post-Vulgate &quot;Quest of the Holy Grail&quot;, Erec unwillingly murders his sister and is later slain by Gawain in revenge for the death of Yvain of the White Hands, and does not regain his father&#x27;s kingdom; his seat at the Round Table is taken by his friend Meraugis, who had buried him. In the Alliterative &quot;Morte Arthure&quot;, Erec dies during the final battle between the forces of Arthur and Mordred.

In &quot;Lanzelet&quot;, Erec and Gawain agree to be delivered as prisoners to the great wizard Malduc (whose father was killed by Erec), so that Guinevere can be rescued from King Valerin&#x27;s castle; they are then tortured and almost starved to death in Malduc&#x27;s dungeon, until they are eventually themselves rescued. In &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, Harry le Fyse Lake (or &quot;Garry le Fitz Lake&quot;, Malory&#x27;s corruption of the French &quot;Herec le Fils Lac&quot;) participates in Lancelot&#x27;s rescue of Guinevere from the stake.

=== Esclabor ===
King Esclabor the Unknown (&quot;Astlabor&quot;, &quot;Esclabort&quot;, &quot;Scalabrone&quot;; -&quot;le Mescogneu&quot;, -&quot;li Mesconneü&quot;, -&quot;li Mesconneuz&quot;) is a wandering Saracen lord from a vaguely Middle Eastern land, usually either Babylon (in today&#x27;s Iraq) or Galilee (in today&#x27;s Israel). He is the father of Palamedes, Safir, and Segwarides, among others. During his long stay in Britain, Esclabor initially hides his faith, trying to pass as a Christian, but soon becomes widely known as a valiant pagan knight.

While visiting Rome, he saves the life of the Roman Emperor; he later travels to Arthur&#x27;s Logres at the time of Arthur&#x27;s coronation, where he rescues King Pellinore as well. Esclabor eventually settles at Camelot, later adventuring with Palamedes and Galahad during the Grail Quest. In the Post-Vulgate &quot;Queste&quot;, eleven of his sons are killed during their encounter with the Questing Beast. Shortly after finally agreeing to convert to Christianity, an act necessary for the full admission into the brotherhood of Round Table, and which also allows his participation in the Grail Quest, Esclabor commits suicide from grief upon learning of his favorite son Palamedes&#x27; death at the hands of Gawain. 

=== Gaheris of Karaheu ===
Gaheris de Karaheu (&quot;Gaharis&quot;, &quot;Gaheran&quot;, &quot;Gahetis&quot;, &quot;Gaherys&quot;, &quot;Gaheus&quot;, &quot;Gains&quot;, &quot;Gareis&quot;, &quot;Ghaheris&quot;; -&quot;d&#x27;Escareu&quot;, -&quot;de Carahan&quot;/&quot;Car[a/e]heu&quot;, -&quot;de Gaheran&quot;/&quot;Gahereu&quot;, -&quot;de Karahau&quot;/&quot;Karehan&quot;), also known as the White (&quot;li Blans&quot;), is one of the minor Knights of the Round Table and brother of Mador de la Porte in the Vulgate Cycle and the derived works. He should not be confused with Gaheris of Orkney, one of King Arthur&#x27;s nephews and another Knight of the Round Table. His most prominent role, including the manner of his death, might have been inspired by the purportedly historical account of the fatal poisoning of Walwen (that is, Gawain) from the chronicle &quot;Gesta Regum Anglorum&quot;.

In the Vulgate &quot;Lancelot&quot;, Gaheris of Karaheu appears in minor roles, mostly as a prisoner, prior to his accidental death. Gawain saves him from Galehaut, while the mysterious White Knight (Lancelot incognito) rescues him from the Dolorous Prison near Dolorous Gard and then again from the Vale of No Return. Later, in the Vulgate &quot;Mort Artu&quot;, he dies from eating a poisoned apple, which was made by the knight Avarlan and was meant to kill Gawain. The apple is offered to Gaheris unknowingly by Guinevere; the queen is accused of his murder, until she is cleared of the charge in the trial by combat between Mador and Lancelot. This story is retold in the Stanzaic &quot;Morte Arthur&quot; and in Thomas Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, where the victim is, respectively, either an unnamed visiting Scottish knight or Sir Patrise of Ireland (the poisoner is also renamed by Malory as Sir Pionel). The Italian &quot;Tristano Panciaticchiano&quot;, in which he remains Mador&#x27;s brother, calls him Giafredi.

=== Galehodin ===
Galehodin le Gallois (&quot;Galeh[a/o]udin&quot;, also &quot;Gal[l]ides&quot;, &quot;Gallind[r]es&quot;, etc.) is Galehaut&#x27;s nephew and godson, and his designated successor as the King of Sorelois. Galehodin is introduced in the Prose &quot;Lancelot&quot; as the young grandson of the King of Norgales (North Wales). There he is the lord of the town and castle of Pennin (&quot;Peningue&quot;), and desires to follow the great hero Lancelot so he can learn from him. He is described as one of the tallest knights in the world, using a plain white shield with no identification symbols. Together with Mordred and Mador, he easily triumphs over the men of Gorre in a tournament against King Bagdemagus. In the Italian &quot;Tavola Ritonda&quot;, Galehaut&#x27;s heir is his son named Abastunagio, a character corresponding with that of Galehodin as he appears in the Prose &quot;Tristan&quot;. Both appear in their respective texts in the role of the host of the great tournament in Sorelois. The Hebrew &quot;King Artus&quot; includes one Galaodin de Gaulis (of Gaul) among Lancelot&#x27;s followers.

Galehaut&#x27;s cousin and fellow Knight of the Round Table named Galahodin (&quot;Galihodin&quot;, &quot;Galyhodin&quot;, sometimes with &#x27;yn&#x27; at the end) appears as one of closest companions of Lancelot in Thomas Malory&#x27;s telling, in which Galahodin is given some of Galehaut&#x27;s traits from the French tradition. Galahodin, described as a sub-king in Sorelois, serves Lancelot as one of his chief knights during the war against Arthur, later joining him in the hermitage at the end of his life. Before that, one of the episodes borrowed from the Prose &quot;Tristan&quot; tell of Galahodin&#x27;s attempted kidnapping of Isolde, foiled by Palamedes. Malory&#x27;s Galahodin should not be confused with two of his original characters from &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, Lancelot&#x27;s own relatives Galyhod (&quot;Galihud&quot;, &quot;Galyhud&quot;) and Gahalantyne (&quot;Gahalantin&quot;), who are also close companions of Lancelot. After taking over the lands in France, Malory&#x27;s Lancelot appoints Galahodin as the duke of Saintonge, Galyhod as the earl of Périgord, and Gahalantyne as the duke of Auvergne. They eventually stay together with Lancelot and Galahodin as their fellow monks at the end.

=== Galeschin ===
Galeschin (&quot;Galaas&quot;, &quot;Galachin&quot;, &quot;Galathin&quot;, &quot;Galescalain&quot;, &quot;Galeschalains&quot;, &quot;Galescin[s]&quot;, &quot;Galeshin&quot;, &quot;Galessin&quot;, etc.) is the son of King Arthur&#x27;s half-sister Queen Elaine and King Nentres of Garlot. He first appears in the story of the Dolorous Tower in the Vulgate Cycle, in which he and his cousin Yvain attempt to rescue their other cousin Gawain from the wicked lord Carados; both are taken captive as well, but the trio are eventually rescued by Lancelot. (Galeschin is later additionally rescued by Lancelot from the Vale of No Return.) Though mentioned in a few other stories, his role is ultimately minor. He loosely inspired the character of Duke Chalance (&quot;Chalaunce&quot;) of Clarence, a Knight of the Round Table appearing in different episodes of &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;.

Roger Sherman Loomis derives the name Galeschin from the name &quot;Galvariun&quot;, found on an Arthurian relief on the Italian Modena Archivolt, considered the first known Arthurian illustration (c. 1120–1240). He theorizes that the name was altered to make it sound more like &quot;Galesche&quot;, the Old French word for Gaul, and derives the name Galvariun from the epithet &quot;Gwallt Euryn&quot;, found in &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot;, which he translates as &quot;Golden Hair&quot;. However, other scholars usually identify the figure of Galvariun as a prototype of Gawain&#x27;s brother Gaheris. Oddly, Galeschin is also called the &quot;Duc de Clarence&quot; in the French literature prior to the 14th century; this could not possibly refer to the position of Duke of Clarence (which did not exist yet at the time and does not refer to a place name), leading Loomis to translate it as the &quot;Lord of Light&quot;. 

=== Gornemant ===
Gornemant de Gohort (&quot;Gorneman[s/z]&quot;: -&quot;de Goort&quot;, &quot;de Gorhaut&quot;) is the knight best known as Percival&#x27;s old mentor. He is mentioned in a few early romances and is prominent in Chrétien de Troyes&#x27;s &quot;Perceval, the Story of the Grail&quot;, in which he instructs the young hero in the ways of knighthood. There, Gornemant is also the uncle of Blanchefleur, whom Percival later marries after successfully defending her city against attackers. Medieval German author Wolfram von Eschenbach gives Gurnemans three sons named Gurzgi, Lascoyt and Schentefleurs, as well as a daughter named Liaze who falls in love with Percival but he declines to marry her. In the &quot;Prose Tristan&quot; romances, he appears under the name Governal[e], entrusted by Merlin to care for and edecate the young Cornish prince Tristan. In Richard Wagner&#x27;s opera &quot;Parsifal&quot;, Gurnemanz is depicted as a Grail Knight.

=== Griflet ===
Griflet () the son of Do is a ubiquitous character in Arthurian legend, where he was one of the first Knights of the Round Table. He is first found in Chrétien de Troyes&#x27; &quot;Erec et Enide&quot;, named there as Girflez li filz Do. Like many other Arthurian romance characters, his origins lie in Welsh mythology; in this instance, it is the minor deity Gilfaethwy fab Dôn. He is notably the eponymous hero of his own, early chivalric romance, &quot;Jaufre&quot;.

He also appears as Gerflet in Beroul&#x27;s &quot;Tristan&quot; and in the Norse &quot;Parcevals Saga&quot;; Gerflet li fius Do in &quot;Mériadeuc&quot;; Gifflet in &quot;Escanor&quot;; Gifflet (&quot;Girfles&quot;) li fieus Do in the &quot;Livre d&#x27;Artus&quot;; Giflés (&quot;Gifles&quot;) li fius Do in &quot;Perceval ou le Conte du Graal&quot;, &quot;Li Biaus Descouneüs&quot;, and &quot;Libeaus Desconus&quot;; Giflet le fils de Do in &quot;Le Bel Inconnu&quot;; Giflet fis Do in &quot;Sir Gawain and the Lady of Lys&quot;; Girflet (&quot;Giflet&quot;, &quot;Giflez&quot;, &quot;Giftet&quot;, &quot;Girfles&quot;, &quot;Gyfles&quot;, &quot;Gyflet&quot;, &quot;Gyrflet&quot;) le (&quot;li&quot;) fils (&quot;filz&quot;) Do (&quot;Doon&quot;, &quot;Dos&quot;) in the Vulgate and Post-Vulgate prose cycles; Girfles (&quot;Girlflet&quot;, &quot;Girflez&quot;) li filz Do in the Prose &quot;Tristan&quot;; Girflez le fils Do in &quot;Lancelot, le Chevalier de la Charrette&quot;; Girflez in &quot;La Mule sans Frein&quot;; Griflet (&quot;Gifles&quot;, &quot;Gifflès&quot;, &quot;Gifflet&quot;, &quot;Gryflet&quot;, &quot;Gryfflet&quot;) li fieus Do (&quot;Dou&quot;) in &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;; Grifles in Henry Lovelich&#x27;s &quot;Merlin&quot;; Grimfles in the English Prose &quot;Merlin&quot;; Gyffroun in &quot;Ywain and Gawain&quot;; and Iofreit (&quot;Jofreit&quot;) fils Idol in &quot;Parzival&quot;. Further texts featuring him include &quot;Hunbaut&quot;, &quot;La Vengeance Raguidel&quot;, and the First and Fourth Continuations of &quot;Perceval&quot;.

In French chivalric romance prose cycles, he is a cousin to Lucan and Bedivere who first appears as a loyal and valiant young squire at the beginning of King Arthur&#x27;s rule. About the same age as Arthur, he distinguishes himself in the Battle of Bedegraine against the rebels and joins the Round Table after personally slaying one of the Saxon kings when he helps Kay and Gawain rescue Guinevere in the Prose &quot;Merlin&quot;. Later, however, his role becomes largely limited to him notoriously often falling into captivity for the other knights to rescue in the course of their own adventures, even leading Gawain to comment in the Prose &quot;Lancelot&quot; that &quot;there never was a man so frequently taken prisoner as Girflet has been.&quot; According to the French &quot;Mort Artu&quot;, he was one of the few survivors of Arthur&#x27;s final battle and was asked by the dying king to return his sword Excalibur to the Lady of the Lake. In &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, however, Sir Griflet is one of the knights killed by Lancelot&#x27;s rescue party at the execution of Guinevere, making Griflet&#x27;s cousin Bedivere the knight who casts away Excalibur, the role that has been given to Bedivere also in the earlier English adaptations of the &quot;Mort Artu&quot;. 

=== Hector de Maris ===
Hector de Maris (&quot;Ector de Maris&quot;, &quot;Estor de Mareis&quot;, &quot;Hector de Marais&quot;, &quot;Hestor des Mares&quot;, etc.) is the younger half-brother of Lancelot; Bors and Lionel are his cousins. His name means Hector of the Fens (the form used in Norris J. Lacy&#x27;s translation of the Vulgate Cycle); he should not be mistaken with Sir Ector (&quot;Hector&quot;), the father of Kay and foster father of Arthur. Hector&#x27;s adventures are many and wide-ranging, especially within the Vulgate and the Post-Vulgate prose cycles. As Astore, he is also the eponymous protagonist of the Italian &quot;Cantare di Astore e Morgana&quot; in which he becomes Morgan&#x27;s seemingly invincible demon-knight minion known as Estorre after being first cured by her of his wounds and then falling under her evil spell, until he is defeated and saved by Galahad.

As told in the Vulgate &quot;Merlin&quot;, Hector is an illegitimate son of King Ban of Benoic (in today&#x27;s France), who, magically helped by Merlin, fathered him with the Lady de Maris. He is raised by his maternal grandfather Agravadain the Black, lord of the Castle of the Fens. In the Vulgate &quot;Lancelot&quot;, Hector fights against the Saxons and saves his relative Elaine the Peerless. He is successful at tournaments, prevailing against such esteemed knights as Palomedes and Perceval. Hector is, however, one of the knights defeated and imprisoned by Turquine before being rescued by his brother Lancelot; he later returns the favour by finding the lost Knight of the Lake after Lancelot&#x27;s period of insanity and returning him to the court. During the time when Lancelot is missing, Hector is one of the best knights of Arthur, second only to Bors, as ranked by King Bagdemagus asked by Arthur. Hector has a long relationship with Lady Perse of the Narrow Borderland after saving her from a forced marriage; he also has an affair with a cousin of the Lady of Roestoc prior to reuniting with Perse. In the Post-Vulgate &quot;Queste&quot;, his friendship with Gawain turns into the hatred following Gawain&#x27;s killing of Erec. Hector participates in the great Grail Quest, during which his companions besides Gawain include Arthur the Less and Meraugis. Like most others, Hector is proven unworthy of achieving the sacred relic. Nevertheless, he helps the Grail hero Galahad to destroy the Castle of Treachery, and the appearance of the Grail revives him and Perceval after the two mortally wounded each other. In the &quot;Mort Artu&quot; (and &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;), when Lancelot is caught in his affair with Guinevere, Hector stands by his half-brother and leaves court with him. He becomes one of the top leaders of Lancelot&#x27;s faction, participating in the battle to rescue the queen at her would-be execution and the subsequent defence of Lancelot&#x27;s castle Joyous Guard. Hector accompanies Lancelot in France when they are expelled from Arthur&#x27;s kingdom, before later returning to Britain to help defeat the Saxon army aided by Mordred&#x27;s sons after the Battle of Camlann (Salisbury). He then joins his brother at the Archbishop of Canterbury&#x27;s hermitage, and later dies on a crusade in the Holy Land. 

=== King with the Hundred Knights ===
The King with the Hundred Knights (Old French: &quot;Roi des Cent Chevaliers&quot;, sometimes translated as the &quot;King &quot;of&quot; the Hundred Knights&quot;) is a moniker commonly used in for a character that has appeared under different given names in various works of Arthurian romance, including as Malaguin (&quot;Aguignier&quot;, &quot;Aguigens&quot;, &quot;Aguigniez&quot;, &quot;Aguysans&quot;, &quot;Alguigines&quot;, &quot;Angvigenes&quot;, &quot;Malaguis&quot;, &quot;Malauguin[s]&quot;, etc.) in the Prose &quot;Lancelot&quot;; the legendary figure of Malaguin seems to be loosely based on that of the historical Maelgwn, an early 6th-century king of Gwynedd known for propagating Christianity in Britain. He appears as Heraut (&quot;Berant&quot;, &quot;Horel&quot;, &quot;Horiaus&quot;, &quot;Hovaux&quot;, etc.) li Aspres in the Prose &quot;Tristan&quot;, while Thomas Malory refers to him as Sir Barant (&quot;Berrant&quot;) le Apres. Conversely, some texts such as &quot;Palamedes&quot; do not give him a proper name.

His first known appearance is possibly in &quot;Lanzelet&quot; as Ritschart, a count opposing King Lot who is mentioned as having a hundred knights and is later aided by Lancelot, followed by that of Margon in the Third Continuation of &quot;Perceval, the Story of the Grail&quot;. His first major role as the &quot;King with the Hundred Knights&quot; is found in the Vulgate and Post-Vulgate versions of &quot;Merlin&quot; continuations, in which he is introduced as one of the chief rebels against King Arthur in the Battle of Bedegraine; however, after experiencing a prophetic dream, he decides to join Arthur to fight the invading Saxon pagans in God&#x27;s name. He remains on Arthur&#x27;s side during Lot&#x27;s second rebellion, but then fights against Arthur in the service of Galehaut in the Vulgate &quot;Lancelot&quot;; afterwards, he again submits to Arthur&#x27;s rule and joins the Round Table, later taking part in the war against Rome. (The chronology of that is different in Malory&#x27;s compilation.) &quot;Lancelot of the Laik&quot;, a Scots version of the Vulgate &quot;Lancelot&quot;, splits his character into these of the King with a Hundred Knights and Maleginis, two different minor kings serving Galehaut.

He is described as the ruler of the land variably known as Estrangore in the &quot;Livre d&#x27;Artus&quot; alternative continuation of &quot;Merlin&quot;, Malahaut (&quot;Malehaut&quot;, etc.) in the &quot;Estoire de Merlin&quot; and the Prose &quot;Lancelot&quot;, Guzilagne in &quot;La Tavola Ritonda&quot;, Piacenza in &quot;I Due Tristani&quot;, and Tumane in &quot;Lanzelet&quot;. The Vulgate &quot;Lancelot&quot; gives him a sister known only as the Lady of Malahaut, a son named Maranz (&quot;Marant&quot;, &quot;Marauz&quot;, &quot;Martans&quot;, &quot;Martant&quot;), and a daughter named Landoine (&quot;Landoigne&quot;). The Prose &quot;Tristan&quot; and &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; mention him as a lover of one of Morgan le Fay&#x27;s companions, the enchantress known as the Queen of North Wales. In &quot;I Due Tristani&quot;, he marries Riccarda, the half-giant sister of Galehaut. In the Third Continuation of &quot;Perceval&quot;, his son, named Cargril (&quot;Cargrilo&quot;), falls in one-sided love with Perceval&#x27;s cousin Sore Pucelle; Margon and Cargril besiege her castle but Gawain lifts the siege and Sore Pucelle avenges the death of her lover (whom they had hanged) by launching Cargril from a catapult. In &quot;La Tavola Ritonda&quot;, the King with the Hundred Knights dies fighting alongside King Amoroldo of Ireland (an Italian version of Morholt) at the Battle of Lerline, in a factional conflict in which Lancelot and Tristan find themselves on the opposing sides.

King Lac (French: &quot;Roi Lac&quot;, literally &quot;King Lake&quot;) is the father of the Round Table member Erec, was introduced in Chrétien de Troyes&#x27; &quot;Erec and Enide&quot; and its variants. His counterpart in the Welsh &quot;Geraint and Enid&quot; is named Erbin. King Lac is himself a Knight of the Round Table in the Guiron le Courteous part of &quot;Palamedes&quot;, and Thomas Malory retained him in this role in his &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; as the King of the Lake.

According to &quot;Erec et Enide&quot;, King Lac dies of old age and his son Erec is made ruler of Lac&#x27;s kingdom by King Arthur. That kingdom is variably known as Estre-Gales (probably &quot;Outer Wales&quot;, possibly Strathclyde or Striguil) with the capital Carrant or Carnant (possibly a Brittonic form of Nantes), Destrigales in Hartmann von Aue&#x27;s version, Greater Orkney (&quot;Orcanie la Grant&quot;) in the Vulgate Cycle, and Black Isles in &quot;Palamedes&quot;. In his redefinition in the Post-Vulgate Cycle, King Lac is son of Canan, a commoner-born Greek king. The Post-Vulgate &quot;Quest of the Holy Grail&quot; tells of Lac&#x27;s poisoning by the sons of his brother, King Dirac, and the young Erec&#x27;s exile from their kingdom of Saloliqui to Britain following Lac&#x27;s murder. Here, King Lac&#x27;s wife (Erec&#x27;s mother) was the sorceress Crisea (&quot;Ocise&quot;), the sister of Pelles the Fisher King.

Besides Erec, King Lac&#x27;s children include a daughter, who appears unnamed in Chrétien&#x27;s &quot;Perceval&quot; but is called Jeschute in &quot;Parzival&quot;. Lac&#x27;s other sons include Brandelis in &quot;Palamedes&quot; and in &quot;I Due Tristani&quot;, and Cligés in the First Continuation of &quot;Perceval&quot;, who both become Knights of the Round Table in their respective stories. He is however entirely unrelated to neither Lancelot du Lac (of the Lake) nor to King Lot whose name is written as &quot;Lac&quot; in some Portuguese texts.

=== Lohot ===
Lohot or Loholt (&quot;Hoot&quot;, &quot;Loholz&quot;, &quot;Lohoot&quot;, &quot;Lohoth&quot;, &quot;Lohoz&quot;) is a character loosely based on the mysterious figure of Llacheu, one of the sons of King Arthur in the original Welsh tradition. He appears as the king&#x27;s legitimate son by Queen Guinevere in some early continental romances. In &quot;Perlesvaus&quot;, the sleeping Loholt is treacherously murdered by Kay so that the latter can take credit for the slaying of Logrin the giant, and his murder causes Guinevere to die of sorrow. In &quot;Lanzelet&quot;, Loüt is said to be the most renowned young knight who eventually accompanied Arthur &quot;into a country whence the Bretons still expect both of them evermore&quot; (i.e. Avalon). As son of Arthur named Elinot, he is also referenced as Guinevere&#x27;s deceased son in &quot;Garel&quot; by Der Pleier, where he has been killed in the service of his beloved Florie who then herself died of grief.

In the Vulgate Cycle&#x27;s &quot;Livre d&#x27;Artus&quot;, on the other hand, Lohot is Arthur&#x27;s bastard son by Lady Lisanor, daughter of Earl Sevain, from the tryst magically arranged by Merlin. In the Prose &quot;Lancelot&quot;, Lohot dies young from illness shortly after having been rescued from his captivity in the Dolorous Prison by Lancelot. The &quot;Livre de Lancelot del Lac&quot; suggests that he is the son of the sorceress Camille who abducted and seduced Arthur. The late romance &quot;Sagramor&quot; conflates Lisanor&#x27;s son with the protagonist Sagramor and even has him ascend Arthur&#x27;s throne. &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; renamed him as a very minor character called Borre (&quot;Boarte&quot;, &quot;Bohart&quot;, &quot;Bohort&quot;) le Cure Hardy (&quot;the Strong Heart&quot;) and his mother as Lionors or Lyzianor, daughter of Earl Sanam.

=== Lucan ===
Lucan the Butler (&quot;Lucanere de Buttelere&quot;, &quot;Lucan[s] li Bouteillier&quot;, &quot;Lucant le Boutellier&quot;, &quot;Lucas the Botiller&quot;, &quot;Lucanus&quot;, etc.) is a servant of King Arthur, the son of Duke Corneus, a brother of Bedivere, and a cousin of Griflet. His earliest mention is in &quot;Erec and Enide&quot; and he is also known in English translations as Lucan the Wine Steward. He and his relatives are among King Arthur&#x27;s earliest allies in the war against the rebel kings and then remain loyal to Arthur throughout his life. Lucan takes on the post of royal butler, a significant position in charge of the royal household. As such he is in charge of the royal court, along with Bedivere the Marshal and Kay the Seneschal.

Lucan fights for Arthur&#x27;s right to the throne at the Battle of Bedegraine and against subsequent rebellions. He is also known to always attend the royal tournaments. In most accounts of Arthur&#x27;s death in the romance literature, from the &quot;Lancelot-Grail&quot; cycle to &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, Lucan is one of the last knights at the king&#x27;s side at the Battle of Camlann and is usually the last of them to die. Lucan remains loyal to King Arthur throughout the schism with Lancelot, and on occasion acts as a negotiator between them. Similarly, he stays by the monarch&#x27;s side during Mordred&#x27;s rebellion and tries to dissuade Arthur from his final attack on his son/nephew, but is unsuccessful and the king becomes fatally wounded. Worried about looters roaming the battlefield, Lucan and either Griflet or Bedivere attempt to move the dying Arthur into a nearby chapel for safety, but the strain is too much for Lucan and his old wound bursts open, spilling out his bowels and killing him just before the king returns Excalibur to the Lady of the Lake.

Though the knight whom Arthur asks to cast the sword into the lake is usually Griflet (Vulgate &quot;Mort Artu&quot;) or Bedivere (&quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, the Alliterative &quot;Morte Arthure&quot;, the Stanzaic &quot;Morte Arthur&quot;), the 16th-century English ballad &quot;King Arthur&#x27;s Death&quot; ascribes this duty to Lucan. A character named Lucan appears in the 2004 film &quot;King Arthur&quot; where, played by Johnny Brennan, he is a young boy found and cared for by Arthur&#x27;s warrior Dagonet. 

=== Mador de la Porte ===
Mador de la Porte (French: &quot;Mador&quot;, &quot;Amador&quot;; English: &quot;Mador&quot;, &quot;Madore&quot;, &quot;Madors&quot;; Italian: &quot;Amador della porta&quot;, &quot;Amadore&quot;; Irish: &quot;Mado&quot;) is a minor Knight of the Round Table in the late Arthurian prose romances. His epithet &quot;of the Gate&quot; (de la Porte) suggests he might have been Arthur&#x27;s porter; if so, Mador might be equated with Glewlwyd Gafaelfawr (&quot;Mightygrasp&quot;) who is Arthur&#x27;s porter in medieval Welsh tales.

Mador&#x27;s best known role is in an episode of the Vulgate &quot;Mort Artu (&quot;and consequently in the Stanzaic &quot;Morte Arthur&quot; and Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;) that tells the story of his trial by combat against the incognito Lancelot, Queen Guinevere&#x27;s champion for her innocence following the poisoning of Mador&#x27;s brother Gaheris de Karahau. Mador loses the duel to Lancelot (without losing his life in the process), saving Guinevere from the accusation that almost led her being burnt at the stake.

Besides the Vulgate &quot;Mort Artu&quot; and the English works based on it, Mador also appears or is referenced in several other works, including in the Prose &quot;Lancelot&quot;, in the &quot;Tournament of Sorelois&quot; episode found in some versions of the Prose &quot;Tristan&quot; and the &quot;Prophecies de Mérlin&quot; (as well as in &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;), in the Post-Vulgate Cycle, in the &quot;Guiron le Courtois&quot; part of &quot;Palemedes&quot;, in &quot;Sir Gawaine and the Green Knight&quot;, in the Sicilian romance &quot;Floriant et Florette&quot;, and in the &quot;Compilation&quot; of Rustichello da Pisa. The Vulgate &quot;Mort Artu&quot; notes him as exceptionally tall and says there was hardly a knight in Arthur&#x27;s court who was stronger. This is repeated in the Version I of the Prose &quot;Tristan&quot;, in which Tristan considers him second only to the half-giant Galehault in size and strength. In &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, he is also a companion of the young Mordred.

The &quot;Livre d&#x27;Artus&quot; version of the Vulgate &quot;Merlin Continuation&quot; mentions Madoc li Noirs de la Porte (Madoc the Black of the Gate) among the knights who come to the aid of Aglovale to fight against the forces of Agrippe. He may be further identical with the knight Mado, who is twice briefly mentioned in the &quot;First Continuation&quot; of Chrétien&#x27;s &quot;Perceval&quot;. Mado also appears as antagonist in the 16th-century Irish Arthurian tale &quot;Eachtra Mhelóra agus Orlando&quot; (&quot;The Adventures of Melora and Orlando&quot;), wherein he is the villainous son of the King of the Hesperides in love with Arthur&#x27;s daughter Melora, who disguises herself as a man and fights incognito as a knight to defeat Mado and his ally Merlin.

=== Meliant ===
Meliant (&quot;Melians,&quot; &quot;Melyans&quot;) is a Knight of the Round Table featured in several chivalric romances. In the writings by Chrétien de Troyes and Wolfram von Eschenbach, Meliant de Lis is the King of Lis. Along with Bagdemagus and Meleagant, he declares war on his foster-father, Tiebaut (&quot;Lyppaut&quot;), after being rejected by the latter&#x27;s daughter Obie. Gawain, fighting for Obie&#x27;s sister Obilot, captures Meliant, who then reconciles with Obie in her captivity. A different version of this story, as told by Heinrich von dem Türlin, names him Fiers von Arramis, whom Gawain also forces to surrender to a young lady who is a sister of his beloved Flursenesephin. In the &quot;Livre de Artus&quot;, Meliant de Lis wins over and marries Gawain&#x27;s own lover, Floree.

In the Vulgate Cycle&#x27;s &quot;Queste&quot;, Melians de Danemarche (Denmark, &quot;Dianarca&quot;) is a squire of Galahad, who knights him during the Grail Quest. Later, Sir Melians joins Bors and Percival at Castle Corbenic at the end of the quest. King Arthur appoints him to the Round Table, but he later sides with Lancelot in the civil war in the Vulgate &quot;Mort&quot;. In reward for his support, including his role in the rescue of Guinevere, Lancelot makes him an earl ruling one of Lancelot&#x27;s domains on the continent. Malory calls him Melias de Lile (&quot;de Lisle&quot;) in &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;. He should not be confused with Tristan&#x27;s father Meliadus, who is sometimes known as Melias.

There are also multiple other Arthurian characters by this name. For instance, one Meliant (named Brano in the Italian compilation &quot;La Tavola Ritonda&quot;) is a relative of King Faramon&#x27;s daughter Belide when she falsely accuses Tristan of rape in the Prose &quot;Tristan&quot;. In &quot;Perlesvaus&quot;, an explicitly villainous Meliant is an enemy lord of Arthur, allied with the traitorous Kay; he is eventually killed by Lancelot who had previously also slain his evil father. In the Vulgate &quot;Lancelot&quot;, Carados of the Dolorous Tower takes one Melyans le Gai&#x27;s wife as his mistress. Another Meliant from the same cycle is an ancestor of Gawain (and himself is descended from Peter, an early Christian follower of Joseph of Arimathea) in the Vulgate &quot;Estoire del Saint Graal&quot;. 

=== Morholt ===
Morholt of Ireland (&quot;Marha[u]lt&quot;, &quot;Marhaus&quot;, &quot;Morold&quot;, &quot;Amoroldo&quot;) is an Irish warrior who demands tribute from King Mark of Cornwall until he is slain by Mark&#x27;s nephew Tristan. In many versions, Morholt&#x27;s name is prefaced with a definite article (i.e. &quot;The&quot; Morholt) as if it were a rank or a title, but scholars have found no reason for this.

He appears in almost all versions of the legend of Tristan and Iseult, beginning with the verse works of Thomas of Britain and Béroul. In the early material, Morholt is the brother of the Queen of Ireland and the uncle of Tristan&#x27;s future love (both mother and daughter are named Iseult). He comes to Cornwall to collect tribute owed to his country; instead, however, Tristan challenges him to battle on the remote Saint Samson&#x27;s Isle in order to release his people from the debt. Tristan mortally wounds Morholt, leaving a piece of his sword in the Irishman&#x27;s skull, but Morholt stabs him with a poisoned spear and escapes to Ireland to die. The injured Tristan eventually travels to Ireland incognito to receive healing from Iseult the Younger, but is found out when the queen discovers the piece of metal found in her brother&#x27;s head fits perfectly into a chink in Tristan&#x27;s blade.

The authors of later romances expanded Morholt&#x27;s role. In works like the Prose &quot;Tristan&quot;, the Post-Vulgate Cycle, and Thomas Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, he is a Knight of the Round Table before his fateful encounter with Tristan. The prose romances add many further details to Morholt&#x27;s career; the Post-Vulgate and Malory record his adventures with the young Gawain, Gaheris and Yvain early in King Arthur&#x27;s reign. In the later versions, Tristan takes Morholt&#x27;s place at the Round Table when he joins the company himself. Furthermore, Morholt&#x27;s father named Norhot appears in &quot;Perceforest&quot;. 

===Nentres===
In Arthurian romance, Nentres of Garlot (French: &quot;Nentres de Garlot&quot;) is a British king of the land of Garlot (&quot;Garloth&quot;, &quot;Garlott&quot;), who had served Arthur&#x27;s father Uther Pendragon. At first, he rebels against the young King Arthur, but soon he becomes Arthur&#x27;s ally after his defeat and reconciliation, even marrying one of Arthur&#x27;s sisters. In the Old French Vulgate &quot;Merlin&quot;, he is also named Uentres and Ventre[s/ƺ], as well as Nantes, Neutre[s] and Nextres de Garloc in the &quot;Estoire d&#x27;Merlin&quot; and Neutre in the version &quot;Livre d&#x27;Artus&quot;. In the Caxton print edition of Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, he appears as Nentres, Nayntres and Nauntres, while the original Winchester manuscript calls him Nentres, Nauntres and Newtrys. His other medieval English names include Nantres or Nanter[s] in &quot;Arthour and Merlin&quot;, and Newtres, Newtris, Newtrys and Newtre[s] in Lovelich&#x27;s &quot;Merlin&quot;. His first appearance could have been as Arthur&#x27;s brother-in-law Viautre de Galerot (&quot;Guarlerot&quot;) in the Didot-&quot;Perceval&quot; continuation of the Verse &quot;Merlin&quot;.

Malory makes Nentres the husband of Arthur&#x27;s sister Elaine (&quot;Elayne&quot;), originally named Blasine in the Prose &quot;Merlin&quot;, by whom he has the son Galeschin and a daughter also named Elaine. In other texts, his wife is one of Arthur&#x27;s different sisters: either Morgause (&quot;Belisent&quot;) or Morgan le Fay (&quot;Morgain la feé&quot;). In the &quot;Merlin&quot; continuation texts, Nentres of Garlot is one of the kings who refuse to recognise the newly proclaimed King Arthur&#x27;s claim to be the true heir of Uther, and he joins the others to fight against Arthur (and his own son Galescalain) at the Battle of Bedegraine (where he is defeated by Kay in Malory). After the rebel kings agree to join Arthur to repel the foreign (Saxon or Saracen) invasion, Nentres commands the defense of Windesan. During this time, his wife is kidnapped by the enemy but is rescued by Arthur&#x27;s loyalist Gawain, making Nentres firmly join Arthur&#x27;s side and help him to decisively crush the foreigners at the Battle of Clarence. He then becomes one of the original members of Arthur&#x27;s Round Table and participates in Arthur&#x27;s continental campaigns, slaying the Spanish Saracen king Alifatima during the war against Rome.

According to Roger Sherman Loomis, the name and character of King Nentres could have been derived from that of the historical British king Urien who is most often cast as the husband of Morgan. The Huth &quot;Merlin&quot; mentions Neutre only once as the king of Sorhaut married to Morgan, while presenting Garlot as the kingdom of Urien and Morgain (&quot;Morgue&quot;), which further suggests the identity of Nentres with Urien. The name of his realm of Garlot may also come from that of &quot;Caer Lot&quot;, an Old Welsh phrase meaning the Fortress of Lot, another British former-rebel king often depicted in the legend as married to Arthur&#x27;s sister. The lands belonging to Nentres, Urien and Lot (in Lot&#x27;s case meaning the kingdom of Lothian, not the northern Orkney) are also all commonly placed in today&#x27;s southern (lowland) Scotland. Nevertheless, the three rebel-turned-ally kings, each later married to Arthur&#x27;s sisters, regularly appear as separate characters within the same prose romances, including in Malory.

===Osenain===
Osenain (one of many spelling variants), often appearing with the moniker translating either (depending on the French spelling) as &#x27;Braveheart&#x27;, &#x27;the Hardhearted&#x27;, &#x27;the Bold&#x27; or &#x27;Hard Body&#x27;, is a character often appearing as one (or more) of the knights of the Round Table in the works of Arthurian romance. In English, he is best known from Thomas Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; as Ozanna le Cure Hardy (&quot;Ozanna le Coeur Hardi&quot; in the Winchester Manuscript; rendered as Ozana of the hardy heart in William Morris&#x27; &quot;The Chapel in Lyonesse&quot;); Middle English versions of the &quot;Merlin Continuation&quot; feature names such as Gosenain Hardy Body, Gosnayn de Strangot, Osenain Cors Hardy, or Osoman Hardi of Hert. In many works he is associated with the often similarly named nephew of King Arthur, Gawain of Orkney, while being cast as Gawain&#x27;s either companion or opponent.

Within the chivalric romance tradition, he is first found, without details, as Garravain[s] d&#x27;Estrangot (of Estrangot) among Arthur&#x27;s knights in some manuscripts of Chretien de Troyes&#x27; French poem &quot;Erec et Enide&quot; (Gasosin von Strangot in its German version &quot;Erec&quot;). Roger Sherman Loomis connected Garravain with Agravain, one of Gawain&#x27;s brothers (whom Chrétien himself calls Engrevain in the later &quot;Perceval, the Story of the Grail&quot;). He is also listed by the name Gasouains in the anonymous First Continuation of Chrétien&#x27;s &quot;Perceval&quot;. In a later, non-Chrétien verse romance &quot;Les Merveilles de Rigomer&quot;, one Garradains is named as the knight of Arthur traveling with Gawain on a quest to conquer the enchanted castle of the Irish queen Dionise.

In the German poem &quot;Diu Crône&quot;, the fairy knight Gasozein de Dragoz arrives at King Arthur&#x27;s court, where he single-handedly defeats three Knights of the Round Table while not wearing any armor and falsely claims to be the first lover and rightful husband of Queen Guinevere, unsuccessfully demanding her to be &quot;returned&quot; to him. Gasozein later rescues the queen from her brother Gotegrin, who wants to kill Guinevere for her infidelity, but then he kidnaps her in turn and nearly rapes her, however Gawain arrives in time, defeats Gasozein in a duel, sends him back to Arthur to revoke his claim and join the Round Table, and even arranges Gasozein&#x27;s marriage with his own sister-in-law, Sgoidamur. The Gosezein version of Garravain&#x27;s character re-appears as Gosangos de Tarmadoise, Guinevere&#x27;s early romantic lover and Gawain&#x27;s valiant enemy in the French prose romance &quot;Livre d&#x27;Artus&quot;.

French prose cycles and other works feature Osenain[s] Cuer Hardi (&quot;Gosenain&quot;, &quot;Osanain&quot;, &quot;Osevain&quot;, &quot;Osoain&quot;, &quot;Osuain&quot;, &quot;Oswain&quot;, etc.; -&quot;Cors Hardi[z]&quot;, &quot;Corsa Hardy&quot;, &quot;Corps Hardi&quot;, &quot;au Cœur-Hardi&quot;, &quot;Chore Ardito&quot;) in the Vulgate Cycle, and Ossenain Cuer Hardi (&quot;Oselain&quot;, &quot;Osenaín&quot;, &quot;Ossenain&quot;, &quot;Ossenam&quot;, &quot;Ossenet d&#x27;Estrangot&quot;) in the Prose &quot;Tristan&quot;. In the Vulgate &quot;Estoire de Merlin&quot; (and the English &quot;Of Arthour and of Merlin&quot;), the young Gasoain d&#x27;Estrango[r]t (&quot;Gaswain&quot;, &quot;Gosenain[s]&quot;, &quot;Gosnayn[s]&quot;; -&quot;of / d&#x27;Estrangor[r]e&quot;, &quot;de Strangot&quot;, &quot;Destrangot&quot;), here appearing separately from Osenain, fights alongside Gawain in the battles against the invading Saxons, his great feats earning him an early seat at the Round Table. When Gawain wrongly accuses him of treason, he gives Gawain a severe face wound in a trial by combat in front of King Arthur. In the Vulgate &quot;Lancelot&quot;, he is noted as &quot;very valorous and a good speaker&quot;, and is involved in the adventures of Kay and others. He is with Gawain when they are both captured and imprisoned in the Dolorous Prison until their rescue by Lancelot, who also later frees him from Turquine&#x27;s captivity on another occasion. He assists Maleagant of Gore in the abduction of Queen Guinevere and is imprisoned by King Arthur after Lancelot&#x27;s rescue of her (in Malory&#x27;s version, he is instead one the loyal Queen&#x27;s Knights captured by Maleagant along with her). He is later forgiven and fights for Arthur against King Rience and becomes a knight errant, eventually participating in the Grail Quest. The Guiron le Courtois section of &quot;Palamedes&quot; describes him as son of King Quinados.

Like Gawain&#x27;s, his character is considered to be derived from the prototype of the warrior by the name Gwrvan and its variants, found in the early Welsh Arthurian tales &quot;Culhwch ac Olwen&quot;, &quot;Peredur fab Efrawg&quot;, &quot;Preiddeu Annwn&quot;, and &quot;Trioedd Ynys Prydein&quot;. According to Arthurian scholar Ferdinand Lot, Gwrvan&#x27;s name comes with synonymous Welsh adjectives &quot;cadr&quot; and &quot;cadrauc&quot;, &quot;meaning &#x27;mighty, powerful&#x27;, corresponding therefore in meaning to &#x27;au Cors Hardi&#x27;.&quot; The plot of the French poem &quot;Meraugis de Portlesguez&quot; revolves around the protagonist Meraugis competing for the love of Queen Lidoine with his friend Gorvain Cadrut. Here, Gorvain loses Lidoine to his rival, but ends up happily married to one of her maidens, Avice. However, Ferdinand Lot proposed that this Gorvain is just the story&#x27;s Gawain himself (who earlier appears as &quot;Golvain&quot;) by just a slightly different name. In another chivalric romance, &quot;Hunbaut&quot;, Gorvain Cadrus von Pantelion (Gorvain Cadrus of [Castle] Pantelion) takes Gawain&#x27;s unnamed sister hostage, seeking vengeance against him for the death of one of his relatives. He is taken captive by Gawain, then sent as a prisoner to Arthur&#x27;s court at Caerleon where he eventually becomes a Knight of the Round Table. In the Vulgate &quot;Merlin&quot;, Gosnayns Cadrus (&quot;Gornain[s]&quot;, &quot;Goruain[s]&quot;; - &quot;Cadruc&quot;, &quot;Cadruz&quot;, &quot;Cardus&quot;; &quot;Gornayns Karadus&quot; in Henry Lovelich&#x27;s &quot;Merlin&quot;) and Osenain Cuer Hardi appear as two different knights who are Arthur&#x27;s allies since the very first days (Battle of Carmelide), before Gasoain comes to Camelot.

In the Italian &quot;Tavola Ritonda&quot;, Suziano of the Valiant Heart (&quot;Cuore Ardito&quot;) is a young son of Lady Largina and uncertainly either King Esclabor the Unknown or King Amorotto (that is, Lamorak) of Listenois, as his promiscuous and power-hungry mother was a lover of both of them at the same time. He comes into service of the evil Lady Losanna of the Ancient Tower (&quot;dela Torre Antica&quot;) after falling in love with her, and is slain by Tristan protecting Losanna&#x27;s enemy Tessina from his attempt on her life. He also appears under the name Guengasoain[s] (&quot;Gasouains&quot;, &quot;Guengasouain&quot;, &quot;Guingasoain&quot;) as the antagonist of the French poem &quot;La Vengeance Raguidel&quot;, in which Gawain and Yder attempt to avenge his murder of the knight Raguidel. Here, he is a nephew of King Aguissant (King Lot&#x27;s brother Angusel from the &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;) and serves as the knight of the fay enchantress Lingrenote, the lady of the Nameless Castle (&quot;Castiel sans Non&quot;), who has armed him with powerful enchanted weapons that made him near invincible. He is nevertheless defeated and killed by Gawain helped by Yder, the latter of whom then marries Guengasoain&#x27;s daughter Trevilonete.

=== Priamus ===
Priamus (&quot;Pryamus&quot;) is a Roman ally of Emperor Lucius in Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, following the Alliterative &quot;Morte Arthure&quot;. He claims to be descended from Alexander of Africa and Judas Maccabeus. Upon meeting Gawain in &quot;The Tale of King Arthur and Emperor Lucius&quot;, he defects from Lucius to join forces with King Arthur. In return, Arthur appoints him as the Duke of Lorraine. He later dies at the fight for Guinevere. In Malory&#x27;s version, two of Priamus&#x27; brothers also become Knights of the Round Table: Edward of Carnarvon and Hectymere.

=== Safir ===
Safir (&quot;Safire&quot;, &quot;Safere&quot;, &quot;Saphar&quot;) is the youngest son of the Saracen king Esclabor in the Arthurian legend. He appeared in several works of Arthurian literature, including the Prose &quot;Tristan&quot; and &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;; his name was also included on the Winchester Round Table. Two of his brothers, Segwarides and Palamedes, also belong to the Round Table.

Safir usually appears alongside his brother Palamedes. In one story, Safir disguises himself as Ector de Maris, fights with Helior le Preuse, defeats him, and wins Espinogres&#x27; lady. Vowing to defend the lady&#x27;s honor, Palamedes arrives and locks swords with Safir, not realizing it is his brother. After fighting for an hour to a standstill, both are impressed with each other&#x27;s prowess and skill, and decide to ask the other&#x27;s identity. Safir is devastated to find that he was fighting with his own brother and asks Palamedes for forgiveness; together, they return the lady to Espinogres. Later, after the affair between Lancelot and Guinevere is exposed, Safir and Palamedes join Lancelot&#x27;s side in the ensuing civil war between Lancelot and King Arthur. When they are banished to Lancelot&#x27;s homeland in Gaul, Safir is made Duke of Landok while Palamedes becomes Duke of Provence. 

=== Segwarides ===
Segwarides (&quot;Seguarades&quot;, &quot;Seguradés&quot;, &quot;Seguradez&quot;, etc.) is a son of the Saracen king Esclabor who becomes a liegeman of King Mark. His other brothers include the fellow Round Table knights Palamedes and Safir. It is possible there have been originally two characters of this name, but the stories in which they appear fail to differentiate between them.

He is cuckolded by Tristan in the Prose &quot;Tristan&quot; and Thomas Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;. Tristan has a brief affair with Segwarides&#x27; wife, and wounds the knight after being found out. Tristan encounters Segwarides again on the Isle of Servage; Segwarides forgives him, saying he &quot;will never hate a noble knight for a light lady,&quot; and the two team up to avoid the dangers of the isle. Soon afterwards, Tristan makes Segwarides the Lord of Servage. In Malory, Segwarides is eventually killed trying to repel Lancelot&#x27;s rescue of Guinevere from the stake. 

=== Tor ===
Tor appears frequently in Arthurian literature, albeit always in minor roles. In earlier mentions Tor&#x27;s father is King Ars (&quot;Aries&quot;), but in Post-Vulgate Cycle and Thomas Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, Aries is his adoptive father while his natural father is King Pellinore. His symbolic namesake, Le Tor of Scotland, is also featured in the story of Sebille within the Arthurian prequel romance &quot;Perceforest&quot;.

In the Post-Vulgate and Malory, Tor&#x27;s many siblings include Aglovale, Drian, Lamorak, Percival, and Dindrane. He is born when Pellinore sleeps with his mother &quot;half by force&quot;, and she marries Aries shortly afterward; here Aries is not a king, but a shepherd. The young Tor is also raised as a shepherd but dreams of becoming a knight. His parents take him to the teenage King Arthur, who makes the boy one of his first knights in recognition of his qualities. Later Merlin reveals Tor&#x27;s true parentage, and Pellinore embraces his son; neither Aries nor his wife seem offended. Tor distinguishes himself at the wedding feast of Arthur and Guinevere when he takes up a quest to retrieve a mysterious white brachet hound that had come into the court. According to Malory, Tor and his brother Aglovale are present among the knights charged by Arthur with guarding the execution of Guinevere and they both die when Lancelot and his followers rescue the queen. 

=== Yvain the Bastard ===
Yvain the Bastard (&quot;Yvain[s] / Yvonet / Uwains li/le[s] Avou[l]tres&quot;, -&quot;l&#x27;Avo[u]ltre&quot;, -&quot;li Batarz&quot;) is a son of King Urien of Gore, often confused with his half-brother Yvain, after whom he was named. While the older Yvain is Urien&#x27;s legitimate child from his fairy wife Morgan, Yvain the Bastard was sired by Urien on the wife of his seneschal. He is encountered frequently in Arthurian romance as a hearty and usually sensible knight, fighting in Arthur&#x27;s wars and questing for the Holy Grail with Galahad and Gareth. In the Post-Vulgate Cycle, he is killed by his cousin Gawain late during the Grail Quest when the two, disguised by their armour, randomly meet and decide to joust. It is not until Gawain takes him to a hermitage for his last rites that he realizes he has fought, and killed, his own cousin.

Thomas Malory in &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; split him into two characters: Uwaine les Avoutres, the son of Urien, and Uwaine les Adventurous, an unrelated knight. Malory further splits Morganor, the name of Urien&#x27;s &quot;good knight&quot; bastard son in &quot;Of Arthour and of Merlin&quot;, into a separate character he calls Sir Morganor[e] (first appearing as a senschal of the King of the Hundred Knights, then as a king himself). Yvain the Bastard and Yvain les Avoutres are also separate characters in the Scottish &quot;Lancelot of the Laik&quot;. In &quot;Perlesvaus&quot;, Yvain the Bastard&#x27;s own son named Cahus dies while serving as Arthur&#x27;s own squire on a strange adventure, killed by a giant in a deadly dream. 

=== Yvain of the White Hands ===
Yvain of the White Hands (&quot;Yvain/Yvonet aux Blanches Mains&quot;) is another different Knight of the Round Table named Yvain in the Old French romances. There, and in the English &quot;Arthour and Merlin&quot;, he is unrelated to Iseult of the White Hands and to the &quot;main&quot; Yvain (son of Urien), although Thomas Malory later merged him with the latter. He serves Arthur in the Saxon wars, later participating in the quests to learn the fate of Merlin and to find the missing Lancelot. In &quot;Palamedes&quot;, he is son of a knight named Darie. In the Prose &quot;Tristan&quot;, he is injured by King Mark and healed in a Cornish abbey. In the Post-Vulgate &quot;Queste&quot;, he is mistakenly slain by Erec, for which in turn Erec is killed by Gawain, and his seat at the Round Table is then taken by the Unknown Knight (Arthur the Less). 

==Other Arthurian fellowships==

=== Queen&#x27;s Knights ===
The Queen&#x27;s Knights (&quot;Chevaliers de la Reine&quot;) are the knights who serve King Arthur&#x27;s wife Queen Guinevere in the Old French prose cycles. They are also known in French texts as the &quot;Knights of Queen Guinevere&quot; (&quot;Chevaliers de la Roine Guenievre,&quot; the form used in the &quot;Livre d&#x27;Artus&quot;) and the more elaborate &quot;Valiant Knights of Queen Guinevere&quot; (&quot;Chevalier vaillant de la Roine Gueneure&quot;). Members of this group carry only plain white shields, often accompanying the queen and engaging in rivalry against the more experienced Knights of the Round Table. Heroes Gawain and Lancelot are among those who first serve as the Queen&#x27;s Knights in their youth after being knighted by Arthur, before winning enough honour to be promoted to fill the Round Table when a vacancy occurs. Others include the young Sagramore when he mortally wounds the Knight of the Round Table named Agravadain (unrelated to Agravain), grandfather of Hector de Maris, in defense of his comrades.

In the Middle English compilation &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, the simple &quot;Queen&#x27;s Knights&quot; form is used by the author Thomas Malory who also describes them as &quot;a grete felyshyp of men of arms&quot;. In Malory&#x27;s version, Lancelot later rescues a new generation of them when they are captured together with Guinevere by the villain Maleagant (himself sometimes depicted as a rogue member of the Round Table), after the Queen ordered her knightly companions to surrender as to not forfeit their lives.

=== Arthur&#x27;s minor tables ===
The Post-Vulgate Cycle has two other table-based orders within Arthur&#x27;s court. The first of these is the Table of Errant Companions (&quot;Tables des Compaignons Errans&quot;), reserved for the knights errant who are actively seeking adventures while awaiting promotion to the Round Table.

The second one is rather ingloriously called the Table of Less-Valued Knights (&quot;Tables des Chevaliers Moins Prisiés&quot;), the members of which (who originally included Perceval) are, as its name indicates, lower in their rank and status. This group seems to be derived from the knights of the Watch (also translated as the Guard), featured in the Vulgate Cycle&#x27;s Prose &quot;Lancelot&quot; and first mentioned by Chrétien in &quot;Perceval&quot;.

=== Round Table predecessors ===
Robert de Boron&#x27;s introduced the Grail Table as a direct precursor to the Round Table, once used by the followers of Joseph of Arimathea, one of the earliest Christians and a relative of Jesus. They were the original guardians of the Grail, who have traveled from the Holy Land to Britain centuries prior to the times of Arthur. In the cyclical prose continuations of Robert&#x27;s poem, their descendants include Lancelot and the Fisher King. The Grail Table is again used, briefly, by the holy knight Galahad (offspring of the union between Lancelot and the Fisher King&#x27;s daughter) when he and his companions (Percival and Bors) are served mass after successfully completing the Grail Quest.

Some French and Italian prose romances and poetry feature the original 50 knights of the Round Table from the times of Uther Pendragon, the father of King Arthur. It is known in Italian retellings of the Prose &quot;Tristan&quot; as the Old Table (&quot;Tavola Vecchia&quot;), contrasting with those of Arthur&#x27;s Round Table known as the New Table (&quot;Tavola Nuova&quot;). Their stories include that of Branor the Dragon Knight, &quot;the flower of the Old Table&quot;, still unsurpassed in his skills at the age of over 100. Following the death of Uther, the Round Table is kept in possession of King Leondegrance until he gives it to the young Arthur as the dowry of his daughter Guinevere.

An even earlier forerunner of the Round Table appears in &quot;Perceforest&quot;, where Arthur&#x27;s distant ancestor, the eponymous King Perceforest, establishes the elite Order of the Franc Palais (&quot;Ordre du Franc Palais&quot;) to fight against the forces of darkness; the Order ends up destroyed by the evil Julius Caesar during his invasion of Britain. This happens even before the birth of Christ, but nevertheless is presented in the author&#x27;s contemporary High Middle Ages style setting just like the other Arthurian romances; as willed by the Sovereign God (&quot;Dieu Souverain&quot;, here apparently the coming Christian god to whom the Roman and other pagan deities willingly submit and work for), the Franc Palais numbers the selected 300 British knights chosen for their valor and seated in the specially constructed building by the same name.

===Other===
Jorge Ferreira de Vasconcelos&#x27; 16th-century Portuguese &quot;Memorial das Proezas da Segunda Tavola Redonda&quot; tells of the eponymous &quot;Second Round Table&quot; of new knights (children of Arthur&#x27;s knights) led by King Sagramor after Arthur&#x27;s death. A variety of modern works feature contemporary new Round Tables.

<text>Hipparchus (; died 514 BC) was a member of the ruling class of Athens and one of the sons of Pisistratus. He was a tyrant of the city of Athens from 528/527 BC until his assassination by the tyrannicides Harmodius and Aristogeiton in 514 BC.

== Life ==
Hipparchus was said by some Greek authors to have been the tyrant of Athens, along with his brother Hippias, after the death of their father Peisistratos in about 528/7 BC. The word &quot;tyrant&quot; literally means &quot;one who takes power by force&quot;, as opposed to a ruler who inherited a monarchy or was chosen in some way. It carried no pejorative connotation during the Archaic and early Classical periods. However, according to Thucydides, Hippias was the only &#x27;tyrant&#x27;. Both Hipparchus and his father Pisistratus enjoyed the popular support of the people. Hipparchus was a patron of the arts; it was he who invited Simonides of Ceos to Athens.

In 514 BC, Hipparchus was assassinated by the tyrannicides, Harmodius and Aristogeiton. This was apparently a personal dispute, according to Herodotus and Thucydides. Hipparchus had fallen in love with Harmodius, who was already the lover of Aristogeiton. Not only did Harmodius reject him, but humiliated him by telling Aristogeiton of his advances. Hipparchus then invited Harmodius&#x27; sister to participate in the Panathenaic Festival as kanephoros only to publicly disqualify her on the grounds that she was not a virgin. Harmodius and Aristogeiton then organized a revolt for the Panathenaic Games but they panicked and attacked too early. Although they killed Hipparchus, Harmodius was killed by his bodyguard and Aristogeiton was arrested, tortured, and later killed.

After the assassination of his brother, Hippias is said to have become a bitter and cruel tyrant, and was overthrown a few years later in 510 BC by the Spartan king Cleomenes I. Some modern scholars generally ascribe the tradition that Hipparchus was himself a cruel tyrant to the cult of Harmodius and Aristogeiton established after the downfall of the tyranny; however, others have advanced the theory that the cult of the tyrannicides was a propaganda coup of the early democratic government to obscure Spartan involvement in the regime change.

<doc id="352016" wikidata="Q2518975" url="?curid=352016" title="Antipop">
<text>Antipop is the sixth studio album by American rock band Primus. It was released on October 19, 1999, through Prawn Song Records and Interscope Records. Produced by the band, Tom Morello, Stewart Copeland, Tom Waits, Matt Stone, and Fred Durst, it was the final release by the band before their hiatus from 2000 to 2003. It was also their last album with drummer Brain. The album received mostly positive reviews from critics.

==Musical style==
Musically, &quot;Antipop&quot; has been described as nu metal, alternative metal, funk metal, funk rock, and experimental rock.

==Production==
The album features several well-known guest musicians and producers, including Tom Waits, James Hetfield (of Metallica), Jim Martin (former member of Faith No More), Fred Durst (of Limp Bizkit) and Tom Morello (of Rage Against the Machine).

The band has regarded the album&#x27;s production as tense and uncomfortable, with the members of the band not getting along well with each other during recording. Claypool has stated &quot;&quot;Antipop&quot; was the most difficult record we ever made, because there was a lot of tension between the three of us, and there was some doubt at the label as to whether we knew what the hell we were doing anymore. But there was some great things to come out of it, like the tune we did with Tom Waits, &#x27;Coattails of a Dead Man&#x27;. I love that song.&quot; In the song, a woman&#x27;s husband suffers from substance abuse and when he tries to find comfort from his wife, he commits suicide when receiving none. Instead of grieving, his wife finds fame and fortune from his death. It is said that the song is about Courtney Love, although none of the members from Primus have confirmed nor denied this.

After the release of the album the band went on a three-year hiatus from 2000 to 2003. Claypool said &quot;We went on a hiatus, which is a fancy way of saying we just didn’t like being around each other and we wanted to break up but we didn’t have the balls to actually break up. I think we stopped before we totally shit our pants, but I think the closest we came was doing the &quot;Antipop&quot; record,&quot;

While producing the song &quot;Lacquer Head&quot;, Durst encouraged Primus to return to the more aggressive metal sound of their earlier albums &quot;Sailing the Seas of Cheese&quot; and &quot;Frizzle Fry&quot; for &quot;Antipop&quot;.

==Reception==

The album received mostly positive reviews from critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic gave the album a positive review, describing the album as &quot;one of Primus&#x27; most ambitious and best efforts&quot;, noting that &quot;some collaborations are among the best things Primus has ever recorded&quot;. Towards the end of the piece, Erlewine sums up his views by admitting that &quot;they&#x27;re not always successful, but no two songs sound the same [...] and even if it&#x27;s not to your particular taste, it&#x27;s hard not to respect this.&quot; A more negative review came Mike Wolf of CMJ New Music Monthly in November 1999. He wrote, &quot;in the last couple of years since their last proper release, &quot;The Brown Album&quot;, the Bay-Area trio has had to watch as a bunch of other bands tagged as &#x27;funk metal&#x27; dully thudded their way to superstardom. But bands like Korn and Limp Bizkit lack everything that sets Primus apart; an eccentric sense of humor, and the musical skill to bring weirdness to life. A pity then that on &quot;Antipop&quot;, Primus merely embraces the knucklehead approach of the Family Values crowd.&quot;

===Legacy===
The band themselves were not pleased with how the album turned out, their dissatisfaction being a contributing factor to their brief dissolution. Les Claypool said &quot;We were reaching the end of our creative rope. The well was just dry, so we just started sucking mud&quot;. In a 2015 interview, Claypool additionally characterized the album as &quot;somewhat directionless&quot;, adding that &quot;for the most part, it’s my least favorite Primus record&quot;. Regarding their association with the nu metal scene around this time, Claypool reflected in 2022, &quot;a lot of these bands ended up touring with us. I always joke that we were the leapfrog band because you open for Primus and you become huge. I remember Interscope really wanting us to do Family Values and Ozzfest. And I was just not super comfortable in those worlds. I mean, we did them, and we made a lot of great friends from them, but it just didn’t feel like we fit.&quot;

For the first time in 20 years, the band performed &quot;The Antipop&quot;, &quot;Eclectic Electric&quot; and a portion of &quot;Lacquer Head&quot; as a part of their pay-per-view special, &quot;Alive from Pachyderm Station&quot;.

<text>Milorad Pavić (, ; 15 October 1929 – 30 November 2009) was a Serbian writer, university professor, translator, literary historian and academic. Born in Belgrade in 1929, he published a number of poems, short stories and novels during his lifetime, the most famous of which was the &quot;Dictionary of the Khazars&quot; (1984). Upon its release, it was hailed as &quot;the first novel of the 21st century.&quot; Pavić&#x27;s works have been translated into more than thirty languages. He was vastly popular in Europe and in South America, and was deemed &quot;one of the most intriguing writers from the beginning of the 21st century.&quot; He won numerous prizes in Serbia and in the former Yugoslavia, and was mentioned several times as a potential candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature. He died in Belgrade in 2009.

==Biography==
Milorad Pavić was born in Belgrade, Kingdom of Yugoslavia on 15 October 1929 to a distinguished family of intellectuals and writers &quot;that has produced well-known writers for six generations, since the 18th century&quot;. He received a Bachelor of Arts in literature from the University of Belgrade, and later obtained a PhD in literary history at the University of Zagreb.

Pavić entered the literary scene with two collections of poetry titled &quot;Palimpsests&quot; (&#x27;), and &quot;Moon Stone&quot; (&#x27;), published in 1969 and 1971, respectively. Pavić&#x27;s poems were soon translated into English, and included in the anthology titled &quot;Contemporary Yugoslav Poems&quot;. Soon after, Pavić dedicated himself to writing prose and several short story collections were published. Pavić&#x27;s first and most famous novel, &quot;Dictionary of the Khazars&quot; (&quot;&quot;), was published in 1984. It received widespread critical acclaim upon release, and was hailed as &quot;the first novel of the 21st century.&quot; Written as a poetic dictionary, the book has been described as &quot;a quasi-historical account of the semi-imaginary tribe of the Khazars.&quot;
Pavić&#x27;s second novel was titled &quot;Landscape Painted with Tea&quot;, and was published in 1988. Organized as a crossword puzzle, it follows a failed architect from Belgrade as he travels to Greece to trace the fate of his father who disappeared there during World War II. Pavić wrote many more novels, including &quot;The Inner Side of the Wind, or A Novel of Hero and Leander&quot; and &quot;Last Love in Constantinople: A Tarot Novel of Divination&quot;. Described as &quot;highly imaginative&quot;, Pavić is said to have &quot;[done] everything to disrupt the traditional models of fiction writing such as the development of story and the notions of beginning and end.&quot; He was described as being &quot;one of the most intriguing writers from the beginning of the 21st century.&quot; As a result, he was mentioned several times as a potential candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature.

Apart from writing, Pavić taught philosophy at the University of Novi Sad before joining the University of Belgrade. In 1991, he became a member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SANU). During this time, he translated a number of works of Russian fiction into the Serbian language. In 1993, he published his first play, titled &quot;Theatre Menu For Ever and a Day&quot;.

Pavić died in Belgrade on 30 November 2009, at the age of 80. His death came as the result of a heart attack. He was survived by his wife, Jasmina Mihajlović, and by his son Ivan, and his daughter Jelena. Pavić was buried in the &quot;Alley of the Greats&quot; at the Novo Groblje cemetery complex in Belgrade.

==Works==
Originally written in Serbian, Pavić&#x27;s works have been translated into more than thirty languages. Pavić was renowned for his highly imaginative fiction, and his novels diverged from traditional literary notions by means of an open-ended structure and the entwining of the mythic and historical.

===&quot;Dictionary of the Khazars&quot;===
&quot;Dictionary of the Khazars&quot; was Pavić&#x27;s first novel and it acquired international success. Written in 1984, it is a lexicon-format novel which follows the story of the Khazars – a people occupying the territory north of the Caucasus and west and north of the Caspian Sea between the 6th and 11th centuries. In the book, the Great Khan of the Khazars has a dream that is nearly impossible to interpret. To shed some light on it, he summons representatives of the world&#x27;s three great religions: a Christian, a Jew and a Muslim. He asks the three to explain the dream, promising that the entire Khazar tribe will convert to the religion which provides the most convincing explanation. In three dictionaries – one Christian, one Jewish and one Muslim – three different versions of the story are presented, and from these accounts the reader must try to confect a coherent novel.

<doc id="352021" wikidata="Q4596277" url="?curid=352021" title="1st Commando Regiment (Australia)">
<text>The 1st Commando Regiment (1 Cdo Regt) is an Australian Army Reserve special forces unit, part of Special Operations Command with an integrated structure of regular (full-time) soldiers and reserve (part-time) soldiers, which together with the full-time Australian Army 2nd Commando Regiment, provides the commando capability to Special Operations Command. 1st and 2nd Commando companies were raised in 1955 and were combined with 126 Signal Squadron (SF) in 1981 to form the 1st Cdo Regt. The regiment&#x27;s two commando companies are the oldest sub-units within Special Operations Command. In 2008, the regiment deployed to Afghanistan to become the first Australian Army Reserve force element on combat operations since World War II. The regiment is the Command&#x27;s capability lead for special warfare.

==Role==
The primary role of 1st Commando Regiment is to provide a scalable and deployable mission command headquarters to Special Operations Command (SOCOMD). In addition, the regiment is manned, trained and equipped to provide commando force elements up to a company size, as well as providing high quality, competent individual commandos to round out, reinforce and rotate with other SOCOMD capabilities.

During the period from the early 2000s to the early 2010s, combat operations and the evolution of the commando role changed the character of the regiment. The regiment revised reserve training following combat operations, to align training standards with the full-time 2nd Commando Regiment (2 Cdo Regt), and to provide a higher level of readiness for the regiment, however, this affected recruitment due to the long full-time commitment and is now optional.

==History==
===Origins===
Derived from the South African/Dutch word used by the Boers identifying their irregular sized raiding forces employed against the British during the South African Wars, the term &quot;commando&quot; was adopted by newly formed British raiding forces during World War II, and subsequently used by Australian special units raised to fight in the South-west Pacific and Indian Oceans. By the close of World War II, Australian special forces units included the Independent Companies (later Commando Squadrons), Z Special Unit under Special Operations Australia and M Special Unit under Allied Intelligence Bureau.

By the early 1950s, it was deemed necessary by the Army to maintain the techniques and skills that had been developed during the war. Consequently, on 16 September 1954, the Military Board issued the authority to raise two Citizen Military Force (CMF) commando companies: the 1 Commando Company (1 Cdo Coy) in Sydney and the 2 Commando Company (2 Cdo Coy) in Melbourne. Both would be commanded by regular army officers and regular army would form the training and administrative cadre. The companies were to be independent of each other and report to different commands.

The established strength for the companies was to be 265 all ranks, consisting of one major, five captains (three of them platoon commanders), six sergeants and 241 other ranks. This establishment was very similar to the Independent Companies of World War II, which had had an establishment of 17 officers and 256 other ranks.

1 Cdo Coy was raised at George&#x27;s Heights in New South Wales on 24 February 1955; however, the officer commanding, Major William Harold (Mac) Grant decided that the official birthday would be their first parade on 15 July 1955 at Victoria Barracks. Major Grant was a World War II commando veteran having served in the 2/5 Independent Company and 2/12th Commando Squadron. 2 Cdo Coy was raised in Victoria on 24 February 1955 under the command of Major Peter Seddon and first paraded on 7 July 1955. Seddon was appointed for only 12 months with his successor to be Major Jack Anderson.

In October 1955, Grant and Anderson, along with two Warrant Officers Ernie Tarr and Ron Smith, travelled to the United Kingdom to train with the Royal Marines (RM). At the same time, two RM sergeants Mac McDermott and Len Holmes, both Special Boat Service (SBS) trained, travelled to Australia to provide commando training with Holmes-based with 1 Cdo Coy and McDermott with 2 Cdo Coy. Anderson was killed during the last week of the basic commando course and was replaced by Major John Hutcheson. In May 1956, Grant and Hutcheson returned to Australia after six months of training having been awarded the green beret by 42 Commando. Tarr and Smith undertook 12 months of training, including with the Cliff Assault Wing and the SBS, to become training instructors.

Grant has said that the defence planning staff convinced the government to form the commando companies with the role &quot;...of conducting clandestine operations similar to those mounted by special operations also those of the Independent Companies/Commando Squadrons. It was envisaged that by raising units capable of performing such a dual role, a pool of trained manpower would be available to be &quot;farmed off&quot; as necessary to a special operations unit while the remainder would be used in more conventional commando operations.&quot; The Australian Secret Intelligence Service had earlier been formed in 1952 within the Department of Defence whose role included &quot;.. plan for and conduct special operations..&quot;.

Commando courses included basic parachutist, diving, small scale raids, demolitions, climbing and roping and unarmed combat. 1 Cdo Coy held the first diving course in 1957 using a pure oxygen re-breather the Swimmer Canoeist Breathing Apparatus borrowed from the Navy based on training received from the SBS.

In 1957, as the unit already had the designation &quot;1st&quot; within its title, the Army thought it would be a convenient framework on which to re-form the Australian Imperial Force&#x27;s 1st Battalion. So on 1 December 1957 the unit was re-designated the 1st Infantry Battalion (Commando), keeping this title until 22 August 1966 when the unit was renamed the 1st Battalion, The Royal New South Wales Regiment (Commando), City of Sydney&#x27;s Own Regiment. Finally in May 1973 the unit name at last changed back to the former designation of the 1 Commando Company. In 1958, the 1st Commando Company provided the initial training for the recently formed 1st Special Air Service Company, the Royal Australian Regiment.

On the evening of 17 February 1960, 74 commandos from 2 Cdo Coy set off in kayaks, amphibious DUKW (ducks) and zodiacs on a training exercise from Point Lonsdale to Point Nepean in Victoria simulating a raid on the officer cadet school which involved them crossing the infamous Rip at the entrance to Port Phillip Bay. The weather changed without warning and the watercraft were swept out to sea through the Port Phillip Heads encountering massive seas that capsized most watercraft. Nearly all commandos were rescued except three who drowned. 2nd Commando Company developed a Mountain Leader&#x27;s Course in ski patrolling, as well as rock, ice and snow climbing.

In 1968, 2 Cdo Coy moved to Fort Gellibrand at Williamstown from Ripponlea. The company had originally been based at Sandringham then sometime between 1957 and 1958 moved to HMAS Cerberus before moving to Ripponlea in 1958.

===301st and 126th Signal Squadrons===
The requirement for long-range communications can be traced back to WWII and units such as Coastwatchers, New Guinea Air Warning Wireless Company, the Independent Companies, and Z Special Unit. On 30 April 1958, a decision was made to raise No 1 Independent Signals Squadron to support clandestine operations and this led to the formation of 301st Signal Squadron (Home Defence) in 1960 at Lidcombe, New South Wales. This new squadron was to meet the requirement for &#x27;special communications&#x27; and was charged with the responsibility of providing long-range communications for commando-type operations and was augmented with regular army members in 1963. In December 1964, 301st Signal Squadron was re-designated 126th Signal Squadron, later to 126th Signal Squadron (Special Forces) in January 1966 and subsequently relocated to Albert Park, Victoria and in 1972 to Simpson Barracks in Watsonia, Victoria. Women had been serving in the signals squadron since 1964 as cipher clerks and from 1968 as radio operators. In 1978, the signals squadron was provided with approval to wear the green beret with the Corps of Signals badge. In 1981, signaller Kerry Hiam became the first woman to qualify and be awarded a green beret.

===Borneo and Vietnam===
Prior to formation as a regiment, the sub units deployed individuals and small teams to the Borneo confrontation and the Vietnam War. During the Borneo confrontation, Sergeant Ted Blacker of 126th Signal Squadron (Special Forces) was awarded the British Empire Medal. From 1965 the Commando Companies contributed numerous instructors, including from their reserve part-time component, to the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam (AATTV). Two lost their lives with the AATTV, with Warrant Officer Class II John Durrington being killed in action, and Warrant Officer Class II Ron Scott dying of wounds. Whilst serving with the AATTV, Warrant Officer Class II Ray Simpson, formerly from both the Special Air Service Regiment (SASR) and the 1st Commando Company, was awarded the Victoria Cross for an action in the Kontum Province on 6 May 1969.

===Formation of Regimental Headquarters===
All sub-units operated independently, training Army Reserve commandos and special forces signalers until 1981 when it was determined a regimental headquarters was required. This headquarters would coordinate the efforts of the previously independent units and provide the east coast command element for the newly established counter-terrorist capability within the SASR. The headquarters was established on 1 February 1981 and from 1 July 1981 was based at Randwick Barracks in Randwick, New South Wales. 126 Signal Squadron (Special Forces) was renamed 126 Signal Squadron.

In 1991, a 1 Cdo Coy commando who had joined the British Army Special Air Service was in the well-known Bravo Two Zero patrol in Iraq as part of Operation Desert Storm.

In 1992, 126 Signal Squadron qualified signallers were given approval to wear the commando badge.

Commencing in February 1997, 1 Cdo Regt provided the initial training for the re-role of the 4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (4RAR) from an infantry battalion into commando 4RAR (Cdo) raising the Commando Training Wing (the predecessor to the Special Forces Training Centre) commanded by Major Hans Fleer.

In July 1997, three women officers, Lieutenants Fellows, Warren-Smith and Woods, became the first women to complete the commando officer selection course. The women were barred from serving in combat roles.

In 1998, the Army dropped plans to raise a third reserve company in Queensland for the regiment due to a lack of resources.

In September 1999, 126 Signal Squadron became an independent unit providing support to 1 Cdo Regt and 4RAR Cdo reporting directly to Headquarters Special Operations. In 2000, the squadron transitioned to a Regular Army unit based at Holsworthy Barracks under the command of 4RAR Cdo. In June 2002, 301 Signal Squadron was re-raised at Randwick Barracks to provide communications and information systems and electronic warfare to facilitate the command and control of special operations conducted by the regiment.

In 2006, 1 Cdo Coy relocated from Georges Heights in Mosman to HMAS Penguin in Balmoral.

===Recent operations===
In recent years, the regiment has provided small detachments and individuals to peacekeeping missions. Deployments in the region, include to Bougainville as part of Operation Bel-Isi, to Timor Leste (East Timor) in 2001 as part of Operation Tanager with the regiment providing a substantial reinforcement to A Company 4RAR (Cdo), which had been re-roled from commando to light infantry, of one officer and forty-one Regular Army and Army Reserve commandos, and to the Solomon Islands as part of Operation Anode.

In May 2006, following unrest in Timor Leste, a Special Forces component consisting of a commando company from 4RAR Cdo and a SASR troop deployed to Timor Leste as peacekeepers as part of Operation Astute. The Special Forces component was later reduced and supplemented by 1 Cdo Regt teams often commanded by a member of the 1 Cdo Regt. In March 2007, the Special Forces component was bolstered to form an Apprehension Task Group with the purpose of apprehending ex-Timorese Army Major and rebel leader, Alfredo Reinado, at the request of the Timor Leste government. Reinado was located in the village of Same and approval was given to assault his compound. Reinado evaded capture but four of his men were killed in the battle. For the commandos of the 1 Cdo Regt who participated in the mission the battle was the first combat seen by the unit (at greater than individual level). Over a hundred Army Reserve commandos from the regiment served in Operation Astute during this period.

In late 2008, the regiment deployed an entire Commando Company Group to the Special Operations Task Group (SOTG) in Afghanistan during the Afghan winter as part of Operation Slipper to relieve the SOTG that had up until then consisted of rotating SASR and 2 Cdo Regt elements. This constituted the first deployment of an Australian Army Reserve Force Element on combat operations since World War II. The composition of the SOTG was structured into elements with the regiment&#x27;s contribution designated Force Element Charlie. Force Element Charlie provided the main SOTG element for the following winter rotations in 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 conducting population centric operations. The regiment also contributed commandos to the 2 Cdo Regt to reinforce their element designated Force Element Bravo. The regiment served in six SOTG rotations. A rotation ranged between four and five months.

The first Afghan deployment was composed of 1 Cdo Coy personnel supplemented by 2 Cdo Coy personnel. It was commanded by the Major OC 1 Cdo Coy and arrived in November 2008 for a four-month tour of duty until February 2009. On 27 November 2008, Lieutenant Michael Fussell, a specialist Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) from 4RAR Cdo serving in the Commando Company Group, was killed in action after he stood on an IED during a night infiltration onto a target. Following Fussell&#x27;s death several senior personnel asked to be relieved of their positions due to concerns over the Major and after an inquiry into the death, the Major was relieved of his command and returned to Australia. The inquiry raised issues into the Commando Company Group outside the scope of its terms that instigated the appointment of Vice Admiral (retired) Chris Ritchie to conduct a further inquiry that found that the Group had been inadequately trained and prepared for its deployment, and that concerns over the Major&#x27;s leadership should have been acted on before the Group deployed.

On 4 January 2009, the regiment suffered its first combat fatality when Private Gregory Sher (2 Cdo Coy) was killed by a rocket attack into a patrol base. On 12 February 2009, the Group conducted a night compound clearance in the Sorkh Morghab region with elements of the Afghan National Army and with Afghan interpreters. Corporal W saw, through a window, a male holding an AK-47 rifle pointed at a door that his team was preparing to use to enter the room to clear and fired at him through the window with his rifle. The male returned fire and ignored calls made for him to come out. With fire continuing, and the team being unable to retreat, two grenades were thrown by Lance Corporal M to clear the room. The room was entered, whereupon soldiers found women and children present, with five fatalities (three children and two babies) having been inflicted, along with the male, Amrullah Khan, a farmer whose family claimed had no affiliation with the Taliban. The Australian Director of Military Prosecutions, Brigadier Lyn McDade, decided to charge two members of the regiment, Sergeant J, who gave the order to use grenades, and Lance Corporal M, who threw the grenades, with manslaughter as a result of an investigation into the engagement, coming to the view that they ought to have known, and during the attack then certainly have been aware that women and children were in the room. The charges against the two soldiers were dismissed pre-trial by the Judge Advocate in June 2011. Charges against Lieutenant Colonel M, who based in Kandahar ordered the clearance of the compound, were withdrawn in August 2011 for disobeying standard operating procedures to prevent innocent Afghan nationals in their homes being wrongfully targeted.

==Customs and traditions==
In February 2025, the Special Warfare khaki beret became the primary headdress. Prior to this, the Sherwood Green Commando beret was worn as the primary headdress, formally recognising Commando qualification. The Army sought permission from the Royal Marines to wear the green beret which was provided on 27 July 1955 by the Commandant Royal Marines. The first green beret awarded in Australia was presented to Captain George Cardy of 1st Commando Company on 14 July 1956.

The Director of Infantry advised that the Infantry Corps badge should not be worn and that the commandos should have their own badge. A regimental badge was created featuring a silver World War II-era fighting knife surmounted by a gold boomerang engraved with the regimental motto &quot;Strike Swiftly&quot;. The motto was conceived by Major Mac Grant, the first commander of 1st Commando Company, from reading the book &quot;Swiftly They Struck&quot; and agreed to by Major Peter Seddon, his opposite number in the 2nd Commando Company. The badge was a combination of two proposals from a competition, one from Melbourne and one from Sydney, conceived by Grant with agreement from Seddon. Members wear a Garter Blue lanyard on the left shoulder of dress uniforms in common with the other combat units of SOCOMD. In 1991, distinctive black and green commando parachute wings were adopted and are now worn by all parachute qualified commandos.

While there is no direct lineage to the 1st Battalion, AIF, other than in the 1st Commando Company&#x27;s renaming to the 1st Battalion (Commando), the regiment retains the colours of the battalion&#x27;s World War I colour patch – black over green – which are highlighted on the current 1 Cdo Regt flag.

==Organisation==
The Regiment consists of a headquarters, two commando companies and a signals squadron with a strength about 450. It is organised as follows:
* Regimental Headquarters located at Randwick Barracks in Randwick, New South Wales
* 1 Commando Company (1 Cdo Coy) located at HMAS Penguin in Balmoral, New South Wales
* 2 Commando Company (2 Cdo Coy) located in the historic Fort Gellibrand at Williamstown, Victoria 
* 301 Signal Squadron (301 Sig Sqn) headquarters at Randwick Barracks and elements of the squadron are located with 1 Cdo Coy, 2 Cdo Coy, Canberra and the Special Operations Engineer Regiment

Each commando company consists of a headquarters, two commando platoons, a reconnaissance platoon, a training platoon and integral combat service support elements. Combat elements of the regiment typically operate in platoon to company sized force elements. These will be force tailored by requirement and may not fit any doctrinal size or command and control. The signal squadron has the largest full-time contingent in the regiment.

Reserve support roles include clerical, logistics, transport, medical, intelligence, linguistics and information systems.

==Equipment==
1 Cdo Regt is equipped similar to 2 Cdo Regt with a range of weapon systems that allows it to tailor requirements based on mission needs. These include the M4A1 5.56mm carbine, which can fitted with a M203 40 mm grenade launcher, and the Heckler &amp; Koch USP 9mm pistol as primary weapons. Specialist weapons include the Heckler &amp; Koch HK417 7.62mm rifle, Heckler &amp; Koch MP5SD silenced submachine gun, Accuracy International SR98 7.62mm sniper rifle, SR-25 7.62mm sniper rifle and Barrett M82 12.7mm anti-materiel rifle. Support weapons include the Minimi 5.56mm light machine gun, Maximi 7.62mm machine gun, MAG 58 7.62mm medium machine gun, M2HB QCB 12.7mm heavy machine gun, M3 Carl Gustav 84mm anti-tank weapon, Mk 47 Striker automatic grenade launcher, Javelin anti-tank weapon, and the M72 LAW 66mm rocket launcher The primary commando watercraft is the Zodiac F470 inflatable boat.

==Recruitment==

The regiment is the only reserve SOCOMD combat unit providing Reservists based in the eastern states of Australia the opportunity to serve in a commando unit. Additionally, the regiment provides discharging Regular Army SOCOMD soldiers the opportunity to continue to serve in SOCOMD in a reserve capacity on their return to civilian life. Before the raising of 2 Cdo Regt, the regiment&#x27;s Regular Army cadre consisted of soldiers transferred from the SASR.

Changes introduced to reserve training after combat operations in Afghanistan, required candidates to complete the 332-day continuous full-time Commando Initial Employment Training course the same as their 2 Cdo Regt Regular Army counterparts. However, this provided reserve candidates with the opportunity to consider service in the Regular Army with 2 Cdo Regt with many candidates destined for the regiment instead choosing 2 Cdo Regt. Also, the long full-time commitment discouraged Reservists from considering joining the regiment.

In 2015, &quot;Army: the soldiers&#x27; newspaper&quot; reported the regiment had begun its biggest reserve recruitment drive in over 10 years. A training regime similar to the one prior to Afghanistan operations, was introduced with candidates after completing the selection course posted to the regiment and given a three-year term to complete training. The regiment was also re-raising training platoons in each of the commando companies to host Army Reserve aspirants training for selection.

In addition, in 2016 &quot;Australian Infantry Magazine&quot; reported that direct civilian recruiting would recommence with prospective commandos undergoing Reserve Recruit Training Course at Kapooka before parading at the regiment in the training platoon to prepare to complete the Infantry Initial Employment Training (IET) to became a qualified Infantry rifleman the same as serving Reservists in the training platoons.

==Selection and training==

To prepare for selection, training platoon candidates have 12 months to complete the Special Forces Reserve Training Program, based on the 2 Cdo Regt Special Forces Direct Recruitment 12-week Special Forces Accelerated Infantry Training Program, including the 17-week Commando Physical Training Package.

The first stage of selection is to successfully pass the one-day Special Forces Entry Test. The second stage of selection is successfully completing the Commando Selection Course conducted over two weeks.

Commando Initial Employment training (also called the &quot;reinforcement cycle&quot;) commences after successful completion of the Commando Selection Course. Candidates have three years to successfully complete the course. This cycle consists of numerous courses including: the &quot;Special Forces Weapons Course, Advanced Close Quarter Battle Course, Commando Team Tactics Course, Commando Urban Operations Course, Close Quarter Fighting Course, Commando Demolitions and Breaching Course, Special Forces Basic Parachute Course (including water insertion training), Commando Amphibious Operators Course, Special Forces Military Roping Course, and Combat First Aid or Special Forces Signal Course&quot;. Candidates have the option of completing the reinforcement cycle over 12 months full-time training with their 2 Cdo Regt counterparts.

After the successful completion of Commando Initial Employment Training, the Green beret is awarded and reservists will report to the regiment on a frequent basis to maintain their skills. As a qualified Commando there are specialist courses available to complete, including but not limited to: advanced driving, mortars, cold weather / mountaineering, language training and free fall parachuting.

In 2013, a four-hour documentary &quot;Commando&quot;, focusing mainly on the 2 Cdo Regt, was produced detailing the Commando selection and reinforcement training processes.

New signallers to 301st Signal Squadron have to complete the Special Forces Signaller Course (SFSC).

<doc id="352022" wikidata="Q4272823" url="?curid=352022" title="Anti-personnel weapon">
<text>An anti-personnel weapon is a weapon primarily used to maim or kill infantry and other personnel not behind armor, as opposed to attacking structures or vehicles, or hunting game. The development of defensive fortification and combat vehicles gave rise to weapons designed specifically to attack them, and thus a need to distinguish between those systems and ones intended to attack people. For instance, an anti-personnel landmine will explode into small and sharp splinters that tear flesh but have little effect on metal surfaces, while anti-tank mines have considerably different design, using much more explosive power to effect damage to armored fighting vehicles, or use explosively formed penetrators to punch through armor plating.

Many modern weapons systems can be employed in different roles. For example, a tank&#x27;s main gun can fire armor-piercing ammunition in the anti-tank role, high-explosive ammunition in the anti-structure role and fragmentation shells in the anti-personnel role.

There are also more exotic classes of weapons, such as neutron bombs, chemicals, and biological weapons, which are only designed to attack people. As there is a greater international criticism of them, they are therefore rarely used. These are not generally referred to as anti-personnel weapons but by their own names or group terms (e.g., NBC weapons) by which they are specifically banned. Such weapons often create much collateral damage and may affect large numbers of civilians, as well as causing long spanning consequences when they are not detonated in the case of buried explosives.

==Debates==
A debate has arisen over whether some primarily anti-material weapons can be used as anti-personnel weapons. The Barrett M82 rifle, standardized by the U.S. military as the M107, fires a large-caliber .50 BMG round that will penetrate most commercial brick walls and concrete blocks. It is an anti-materiel rifle designated as a Special Application Sniper Rifle and designed for use against military equipment (materiel), rather than against other combatants. It is used by many armies around the world both in regular forces and in special forces units. As it uses a .50 BMG round, this has led to some debates in the U.S. armed forces about the legality of using such a large anti-materiel rifle round against a human. There have been persistent reports that some U.S. military personnel believe that the use of .50 BMG in a direct antipersonnel role is prohibited by the laws of war. However, Maj. Hays Parks states that &quot;No treaty language exists (either generally or specifically) to support a limitation on [the use of .50 BMG] against personnel, and its widespread, longstanding use in this role suggests that such antipersonnel employment is the customary practice of nations.&quot;

The Raufoss Mk 211 is a .50 caliber (12.7×99mm NATO) multipurpose anti-matériel projectile produced by Nammo (Nordic Ammunition Group, a Norwegian/Finnish military industry manufacturer of ammunition), under the model name &quot;NM140 MP&quot;. It is commonly referred to as simply &quot;multipurpose&quot; or &quot;Raufoss&quot;, which refers to Nammo&#x27;s original parent company: Raufoss Ammunisjonsfabrikk (Ammunition Factory) in Raufoss, Norway, established in 1896. The &quot;Mk 211&quot; name comes from the nomenclature &quot;Mk 211 Mod 0&quot; used by the U.S. military for this round.

The multipurpose name is based on the projectile having an armor-piercing (tungsten core), an explosive, and an incendiary component, thus making it capable of penetrating lightly armored targets and causing damage to personnel inside the target after penetration. It is a suitable round for engaging helicopters, aircraft and lightly armored vehicles, as well as unarmored vehicles, and it is capable of igniting jet fuel. The Mk 211 has about the same destructive power as a standard 20mm round against such targets. The Mk 211 is a very popular .50 caliber sniper round used in the Barrett M82 rifle and other .50 BMG rifles. It is also often used in heavy machine guns such as the M2 Browning. Due to its popularity several U.S. arms manufacturers produce the round under license from NAMMO Raufoss AS. There is also a tracer variant, the MK300, used in the Browning heavy machine gun.

There has been much debate over whether the Mk 211 projectile is legal to use against personnel, or if it is strictly anti-matériel ammunition. The International Committee of the Red Cross has sought to have the ammunition banned, due to concern over the incendiary and explosive components and their effect on personnel. Under the St. Petersburg Declaration of 1868 the &quot;military or naval&quot; use of explosive or incendiary projectiles with a mass of under 400 grams is forbidden. Very few nations were parties to the St. Petersburg Declaration, however, and that declaration does not govern the conduct of non-signatory parties. Further, the Hague treaties of 1899 and 1907 – which superseded the St. Petersburg Declaration, and were signed by a far wider circle of nations – do permit the use of such ammunition for auto-cannons and heavy machine guns. Machine guns firing .50 cal/12.7mm ammunition are heavy machine guns. At best, the ICRC&#x27;s position can be applied to only a small group of nations that were parties to the St. Petersburg Declaration; at worst, the ICRC&#x27;s position is made moot by more than 100 years of subsequent international treaties.

The official stance of the Norwegian Government is that the 12.7 mm MP round should not be used against personnel, but an exception has been made for snipers using the round — due to the practical limitations of snipers having to change the type of ammunition used when switching between hardened and soft targets. It is being exported strictly in an anti-matériel capacity. Most nations using the round train their soldiers not to deploy the projectile against personnel, but in the heat of battle such regulations are easily overlooked. Also, many parties currently fielding the ammunition have no such regulations, including the U.S., whose policy is that the ammunition is suitable for use against all targets.
