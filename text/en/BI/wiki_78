<doc id="352509" wikidata="Q2276549" url="?curid=352509" title="Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany">
<text>Following the Invasion of Poland at the beginning of World War II, nearly a quarter of the entire territory of the Second Polish Republic was annexed by Nazi Germany and placed directly under the German civil administration. The rest of Nazi-occupied Poland was renamed as the General Government district. The annexation was part of the &quot;fourth partition of Poland&quot; by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, outlined months before the invasion, in the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact.

Some smaller territories were incorporated directly into the existing Gaue East Prussia and Silesia, while the bulk of the land was used to create new &quot;Reichsgaue&quot; Danzig-West Prussia and Wartheland. Of those, Reichsgau Wartheland was the largest and the only one comprising solely the annexed territory.

The official term used by the Nazi authorities for these areas was the &quot;incorporated Eastern territories&quot; (German: &quot;Eingegliederte Ostgebiete&quot;). They planned for a complete Germanization of the annexed territories, considering them part of their lebensraum. The local Jewish population was forced to live in ghettos, and was gradually deported to concentration and extermination camps, the most infamous of which, Auschwitz, was located in annexed East Upper Silesia. The local Polish population was to be gradually enslaved, exterminated and eventually replaced by German settlers. The Polish elite especially became subject to mass murder, and an estimated 780,000 Poles were subject to expulsion, either to the General Government or to the &quot;Altreich&quot; for forced labour. The remaining Polish population was strictly segregated from the German population and subject to a variety of repressive measures. These included forced labour and their exclusion from all political and many cultural aspects of society. At the same time, the local German minority was granted several privileges, and their number was steadily raised by the settlement of ethnic Germans, including those displaced by the Nazi-Soviet population transfers.

After the Vistula–Oder Offensive in early 1945, the Soviet Union took control over the territories. The ethnic German population either fled the Red Army or were later expelled and the territories became part of the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland.

== Background ==
Already in the fall of 1933 Adolf Hitler revealed to his closest associates his intentions to annex western Poland into an envisioned Greater Germany. In October 1939, a month after the invasion of Poland, Nazi Germany annexed an area of (23.7% of pre-war Poland) with a population of about 10,000,000 people (30% of the pre-war Polish population). The remainder of the Polish territory was either annexed by the Soviet Union (201,000 km2 or 51.6% of pre-war Poland as per the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact) or made into the German-controlled General Government occupation zone (95,500 km2 or 24.5% of pre-war Poland). A tiny portion of pre-war Poland (700 km2) was annexed by Slovakia.

Since 1935, Nazi Germany was divided into provinces (&quot;Gaue&quot;) which had replaced the former German states and Prussian provinces. Of the territories annexed, some were attached to the already existing &quot;Gaue&quot; East Prussia and Silesia (later Upper Silesia), while from others new &quot;Reichsgaue&quot; Danzig-West Prussia and Wartheland were constituted. Wartheland was the only Gau constituted solely from annexed territory, Danzig-West Prussia comprised also former German areas and the former Free City of Danzig. The occupied General Government remained outside Nazi Germany.

The annexation violated international law (in particular, the Hague Convention IV 1907). Nazi Germany&#x27;s officials discussed the convention and tried to circumvent it by declaring the war against Poland over prior to the annexation, which in their view made the convention non-applicable.

== Administration ==

On 8 and 13 September 1939, the German military district in the area of Posen, commanded by general , and West Prussia, commanded by general Walter Heitz, were established in conquered Greater Poland and Pomerelia, respectively. Based on laws of 21 May 1935 and 1 June 1938, the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; delegated civil administrative powers to Chiefs of Civil Administration (CdZ). Hitler appointed Arthur Greiser to become the CdZ of the Posen military district, and Danzig&#x27;s Gauleiter Albert Forster to become the CdZ of the West Prussian military district. On 3 October 1939, the military districts centered on and named &quot;Lodz&quot; and &quot;Krakau&quot; were set up under command of major generals Gerd von Rundstedt and Wilhelm List, and Hitler appointed Hans Frank and Arthur Seyß-Inquart as civil heads, respectively. Thus the entirety of occupied Poland was divided into four military districts (West Prussia, Posen, Lodz, and Krakau). Frank was at the same time appointed &quot;supreme chief administrator&quot; for all occupied territories.

=== Hitler&#x27;s annexation decree, October 1939 ===
After Hitler&#x27;s peace offer was rejected by French prime minister Édouard Daladier on October 7 (rejected by British prime minister Neville Chamberlain on October 12) a decree was issued by Hitler on 8 October 1939, provided for the annexation of western Polish areas and the Free City of Danzig. A separate by-law stipulated the inclusion of the area around Suwalki (the Suwalki triangle).

The first two paragraphs of the decree established &quot;Reichsgau Posen&quot; in Greater Poland with the government regions (&quot;Regierungsbezirk&quot;) Hohensalza, Posen, and Kalisch, as well as &quot;Reichsgau West Prussia&quot; () in Pomerelia with the government regions Bromberg, Danzig, and Marienwerder. These government regions were named after the German language names of their chief cities: Hohensalza (Inowrocław), Posen (Poznań), Kalisch (Kalisz), Bromberg (Bydgoszcz), Danzig (Gdańsk), and Marienwerder (Kwidzyn). The annexed territories were twice as large as former Prussian conquests in the Partitions of Poland, also contained twice as many people. Compared to 1914, the border of Reich was extended eastwards by some 150–200 km on average. Despite this fact, Germany used old Prussian propaganda of creating a &quot;German living wall&quot; in Polish territories. On 29 January 1940, Reichsgau Posen was renamed &quot;Reichsgau Wartheland&quot; (Warthegau). Reichsgau West Prussia was renamed &quot;Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia&quot;.

The remaining annexed areas were not made separate provinces but included in the existing provinces of East Prussia and Upper Silesia per § 4 of Hitler&#x27;s decree. Arthur Greiser was made Gauleiter of Reichsgau Posen, and Albert Forster of Reichsgau West Prussia.

== Following Operation Barbarossa of June 1941 ==
After the German attack on the Soviet Union in June 1941, the district of Białystok, which included the Białystok, Bielsk Podlaski, Grajewo, Łomża, Sokółka, Volkovysk, and Grodno Counties, was attached to (not incorporated into) East Prussia. Other Polish territories, first annexed by Soviet Union and then by Germany, was incorporated into Reichskommissariat Ostland (in the north), Reichskommissariat Ukraine (in the south) and the General Government (Distrikt Galizien in the utmost south).

=== Planned extension of annexation plans ===
The Nazi government intended to continue its incorporation of pre-war Polish territory into Germany. The rump General Government region of occupied Poland already under complete German civil control was merely seen as a transitional form of government, before the area&#x27;s complete future integration into the Greater German Reich (&quot;Grossdeutsches Reich&quot;). The German bureaucrats subsequently discussed various proposals for the dismemberment of the remaining territories.

Hans Frank advocated for the transformation of some or all of his province into a &quot;Vandalengau&quot;, in honor of the East Germanic Vandal tribes who in Ancient Times had dwelt in the Vistula river basin before the Barbarian migrations. In late 1939 a sixteen-man commission was also active to chart the boundaries of a projected &quot;Reichsgau Beskidenland&quot; (named after the Beskid mountain range), which would have encompassed the areas lying west of Kraków up to the San river to the east of it.

Nazi Party Secretary Martin Bormann on the other hand proposed that the General Government would in the near future be turned into 3–5 &quot;Reichsgaue&quot; or &quot;Reichsobergaue&quot;, including the Galician district. Leaving such discussions open for the conclusion of the war, Hitler never officially adopted or implemented any of these suggestions, instead retaining the status quo of using the areas as a labor reservoir.

=== Administrative divisions ===
== Demographics ==
Before the Nazi German invasion in September 1939 and the subsequent annexation in October, the territories held up to 10,568,000 people or some 30% of pre-1939 Poland&#x27;s population. Due to flights, war losses, natural migration and the lack of contemporary reliable data, demographics especially in the border regions can only be estimated.

Heinemann (2003) gives identical numbers for Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia and Warthegau. For East Upper Silesia, Heinemann gives numbers based on the Nazi census of December 1939, that claimed they were 2.43 million people, of whom ~1.08 million were ethnic Germans, ~930,000 Poles, and ~90,000 Jews. Heinemann and Encyclopaedia Judaica also give a higher estimate regarding the Jewish population, whose number they put between 560,000 and 586,628 people. Eberhardt (2006) confirms the number given by the Bureau for Racial Policy by saying about 600,000 people were Germans.
Prof. Stanisław Waszak &quot;(pl)&quot; of Poznań University cited slightly differing estimates; first published in 1947:

Census data was compiled by Nazi Germany in Danzig-West Prussia on 3 December, and in Warthegau and Upper Silesia on 17 December. A number of Poles tried to present themselves as Germans (Volksdeutsche) hoping to avoid the anti-Polish atrocities or were classified as Germans to meet quotas.

=== Nazi Germanization Plans ===
On October 7, 1939, Hitler appointed Heinrich Himmler as his settlement commissioner, responsible for all resettlement measures in the Altreich and the annexed territories as well as the Nazi-Soviet population exchanges. For his new office, Himmler chose the title &quot;Reichskommissar für die Festigung deutschen Volkstums&quot; (&quot;Reich&#x27;s commissioner for strengthening Germandom&quot;, RKF). The RKF staff (&quot;Stabshauptamt RKF&quot;) through the Hauptamt Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle (VOMI) and the &#x27;Main Department of Race and Settlement&#x27; (&quot;Rasse- und Siedlungs-Hauptamt&quot;, RuSHA) of the SS planned and executed the war-time resettlement and extermination process in the annexed territories. In October 1939, Himmler ordered the immediate expulsion of all Jews from the annexed territories, all &quot;Congress Poles&quot; from Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia, and all &quot;Reich&#x27;s enemies&quot; from the Warthegau, South East Prussia and East Upper Silesia. The term &quot;Reich enemies&quot; was applied to all Poles with higher education, engaged in pre-war in any patriotic organisations or initiatives and generally those who manifested Polish patriotism. Those expelled were to be deported to the General Government.
This directive was superseded by another RKF-directive of early 1940, ordering the immediate expulsion of the remaining Jews and the replacement of 3.4 million Poles with Germans settlers in the long run. This RKF scenario envisioned, as a first step, the settlement of 100,000 German families within the next three years. In this early stage, planners believed the settlers would be relocated from the Altreich. &quot;Racially valuable&quot; Poles were to be exempted from deportation and &quot;racially valuable&quot; ethnic Germans were also to be settled. Himmler said he wanted to &quot;create a blonde province here&quot;. Responsible for &quot;racial evaluation&quot; were &#x27;Central Bureau for Immigration&#x27; (&quot;Einwandererzentralstelle&quot;, EWZ) and &#x27;Central Bureau for Resettlement&#x27; (&quot;Umwandererzentralstelle&quot;, UWZ) of the SS&#x27; RuSHA. The annexed territories were to be Germanised in rural areas within 5 years and in urban areas within 10 years, the General Government in 15 years

In practice, the war-time population shift in the annexed territories did not take on its planned extent, either in regard to the number of expelled Poles and the resettled Germans, or in regard to the origin of the settled Germans which was the Soviet Union. Plans for a resettlement of Germans from Nazi Germany were upheld in the &quot;Generalplan Ost&quot; but postponed to after the war. This plan envisioned the elimination of all Jews and, in the long run, the deportation of initially 31 million, later 51 million Slavs to Siberia from a large area designated for German settlement. The &quot;removal&quot; of Poles consisted of such actions as ethnic cleansing, mass executions, organised famine and eradication of national groups by scattering them in isolated pockets for labour. About 350,000 ethnic Germans were settled in Poland after Nazi propaganda persuaded them to leave the Baltic States prior to the Soviet Union&#x27;s take-over, and subjected to Germanization.

In addition, other Germanic settlers such as Dutch, Danes and Swedes were envisioned to settle these lands. A small Dutch artisan colony was already established in Poznań in 1941.

=== Expulsion and genocide of Poles and Jews ===


The Jewish and Polish population was subject to mass murder and expulsions already during the September invasion, triggering mass flight. The Jewish population was to be resettled but when that proved impossible exterminated. Nazi Concentration camps and extermination camps were set up within the annexed territories including Auschwitz (consisting of several subcamps), Chelmno (Kulmhof), Potulice (Potulitz) and Soldau.

According to Heinemann, about 780,000 ethnic Poles in the annexed territories lost their homes between 1939 and 1944. Of these, at least 250,000 were deported to the General Government, 310,000 were displaced or forced into &quot;Polenlager&quot; camps within the respective Gau, and the others were subject to forced labour either within the annexed territories or in the Altreich. Heinemann says that according to Madajczyk, 987,217 were displaced in the annexed territories and the Zamość region, including Jews. People were sometimes arrested from the street in so-called łapanki.

Heinemann further says that an additional 110,000 Jews were deported to the General Government. Another more than 400,000 Jews were later deported to Auschwitz, Treblinka or Chelmno (Kulmhof) concentration camps, and thousands had died in the ghettos. Of the deported Jews, more than 300,000 were from Warthegau, 2,000 from Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia, 85,000 from East Upper Silesia, 30,000 from the Zichenau district and 200,000 from the Białystok district both in South East Prussia.

Eberhardt cites numbers provided by Jastrzębski, 1968, who says that according to RKF documents, 365,000 were deported between 1939 and 1944. Jastrzębski notes that adding the numbers retrieved from documents of local authorities yields a higher total of 414,820 deported, and estimates a total of about 450,000 including unplanned and undocumented expulsions. Eberhardt notes that on top of these numbers, many had fled, and cites numbers provided by Czesław Łuczak (1979), who estimates that between 918,000 and 928,000 were deported or evicted from the annexed territories between 1939 and 1944. A similar estimate (923,000) is also given by the Institute of National Remembrance.

Heinemann and Łuczak as cited by Eberhardt detail the expulsions as follows: 81,000 Poles were displaced from their homes in East Upper Silesia, 22,000 of whom were deported to the General Government. They were replaced with 38,000 ethnic Germans primarily from Bukovina. From the Zichenau and Suwałki areas of South East Prussia, 25,000 to 28,000 Poles were &quot;evacuated&quot;, an additional 25,000 to 28,000 from the Bialystock area attached in 1941. In Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia, 123,000 to 124,000 were displaced until the end of 1942, 53,000 of whom were deported to the General Government, the others were forced into camps where they were &quot;racially evaluated&quot;. In the Warthegau, 630,000 were displaced between 1939 and 1944. Additionally, Łuczak estimates that between 30,000 and 40,000 were subject to &quot;wild&quot; expulsions primarily in Pomerelia.

Poles due be deported to the General Government were first put in camps where they were subject to racial evaluation (&quot;Durchschleusung&quot;) by the UWZ similar to the &quot;Durchschleusung&quot; of ethnic Germans (&quot;see below&quot;). Those deemed &quot;capable of re-Germanization&quot; (&quot;wiedereindeutschungsfähig&quot;) were not deported to the General Government, but instead to the Altreich. Those that resisted Germanization were to be put in concentration camps, or executed; their children might be taken for Germanization and adoption. A total of 1.5 million people was expelled or deported, including those deported for slave labor in Germany or concentration camps. Eberhardt says a total of 1.053 million people were deported for forced labour from the annexed territories.

=== German colonization and settlement ===

Throughout the war, the annexed Polish territories were subject to German colonization. The goal of Germany was to assimilate the territories politically, culturally, socially, and economically into the German Reich. According to Esch, because of the lack of settlers from the Altreich, the colonists were primarily ethnic Germans from areas further East. These ethnic Germans were resettled during colonisation action &quot;Heim ins Reich&quot; in homes from which the Poles had been expelled, often so abruptly that they found half-eaten meals on tables and unmade beds where small children had been sleeping at the time of expulsion. Members of Hitler Youth and the League of German Girls were assigned the task of overseeing such evictions to ensure that the Poles left behind most of their belongings for the use of the settlers.

Eberhardt cites estimates for the ethnic German influx provided by Szobak, Łuczak, and a collective report, ranging from 404,612 (Szobak) to 631,500 (Łuczak). Anna Bramwell says 591,000 ethnic Germans moved into the annexed territories, and details the areas of colonists&#x27; origin as follows: 93,000 were from Bessarabia, 21,000 from Dobruja, 98,000 from Bukovina, 68,000 from Volhynia, 58,000 from Galicia, 130,000 from the Baltic states, 38,000 from eastern Poland, 72,000 from Sudetenland, and 13,000 from Slovenia.

Additionally some 400,000 German officials, technical staff, and clerks were sent to those areas in order to administer them, according to &quot;Atlas Ziem Polski&quot;, citing a joint Polish-German scholarly publication on the aspect of population changes during the war. Eberhardt estimates that the total influx from the Altreich was about 500,000 people.

Duiker and Spielvogel note that up to two million Germans had been settled in pre-war Poland by 1942. Eberhardt gives a total of two million Germans present in the area of all pre-war Poland by the end of the war, 1.3 million of whom moved in during the war, adding to a pre-war population of 700,000.

The increase of German population was most visible in the towns: in Poznań, the German population increased from ~6,000 in 1939 to 93,589 in 1944; in Łódź, from ~60,000 to 140,721; and in Inowrocław, from 956 to 10,713. In Warthegau, where most Germans were settled, the share of the German population increased from 6.6% in 1939 to 21.2% in 1943.

Only those Germans deemed &quot;racially valuable&quot; were allowed to settle. People were &quot;evaluated&quot; and classified in the &quot;Durchschleusung&quot; process in which they were assigned to the categories RuS I (&quot;most valuable&quot;) to IV (&quot;not valuable&quot;). Only RuS I to III were allowed to settle, those who found themselves in RuSIV were either classified as &quot;A&quot;-cases and brought to the Altreich for &quot;non-selfdetermined work and re-education&quot;, or classified as &quot;S&quot;-cases who were either sent back to their original Eastern European homelands or &quot;evacuated&quot; to the General Government. Initially, people classified as RuS III were to be deported to the Altreich for forced labour, yet since January 1940 were allowed to settle on smaller farms (20 hectare compared to 50 hectare farms for RuS I and II). This change was based on a personal order by Himmler and led to a more restrictive categorization by the classifying officials. About a million ethnic Germans had been subjected to &quot;Durchschleusung&quot; by the end of 1944. RuS I and II were assigned to between 60% and 70% of the Baltic Germans and 44% of the Volhynian Germans, while many ethnic Germans from the Soviet Union were put in the lower categories.

== Ethnic segregation ==

The segregation of Germans and Poles was achieved by a variety of measures limiting their social interaction.

Łuczak described the segregation:
:&quot;Access to a variety of cinemas, theatres, museums, hotels, cafes, restaurants, parks, playgrounds, public transport such as first and second class train departments and best city trolleys, public bathhouses, beaches, public phones and public benches was granted only to Germans, while forbidden by law for Poles and Jews. Poles were not allowed to attend German-held masses. Attending cultural activities or events for non-Germans was punishable, for example in Poznań, four young Polish women who attended an opera were sentenced by German court for 4 months of penal work camp Other laws made it obligatory for Poles to give way to Germans in every occasion on sidewalks, and all Poles were to bow down to Germans as form of greeting. Support for Nazi policies was high among the German minority in the annexed territories Nevertheless as part of their racial policies the German officials forbid friendly or supportive contacts by Germans to Poles and Jews were dealt with quickly and harshly by the authorities by imprisonment in concentration camps, confiscation of property or death sentences. After the Polish decrees became enforced, sexual relations between Germans and Poles were forbidden as &quot;Rassenschande&quot; (race defilement), a Polish women caught in an affair with a German man were arrested and in some cases forced into a brothel.&quot;

Nazi Germany viewed Poles as subhuman, and such views were spread in the media. For example, in October 1939, Nazi propaganda was issued instructing Germans to view Poles, Jews and Gypsies as subhumans. Occasionally, signs were posted in public places reading: &quot;Entrance is forbidden to Poles, Jews, and dogs&quot;. When Germans wanted to silence Poles and Jews, they used such expressions, as &quot;stop barking&quot; or &quot;shut your snouts&quot;.

Part of the population was classified as Volksdeutsche, mostly German ethnic minority. Some Poles were classified as such as well, either by their own free will or by force which included death threats.

== Repressions against Polish and Jewish population ==
Because Nazi Germany envisioned a near-term complete Germanization of the annexed territories, measures there differed from those implemented in the General Government. Germans and the remaining Poles and Jews were strictly segregated. In case of the Jews, this was achieved by ghettoization.

The German administration classified people based on political and racial criteria with Poles and Jews being considered &quot;untermenschen&quot; (subhumans) as opposed to Germans who according to the Nazi racial ideology were the ubermenschen &quot;herrenvolk&quot; (master race). This classification had not only ideological meaning but was expressed in all aspects of practical daily life and treatment of the population. Three main goals were formulated by German authorities in regards to Polish population: Gradual biological eradication of Polish nation, expulsion out of the annexed areas and use of Poles as forced labour, and changing remaining Poles into obedient low-skilled workers by draconian means.

=== Economic discrimination ===
Many Polish owned buildings and enterprises were confiscated, and all jewelry, furniture, money, clothing were subject to forced confiscation. All executive positions which were formerly occupied by Poles and Jews were given to Germans. Poles were forbidden to own rural and industrial enterprises, transport firms, building firms, workshops. The Nazis seized tens of thousands of Polish enterprises, from large industrial firms to small shops, without payment to the owners. Higher taxes and obligatory contributions were enforced on Polish population. Polish workers were stripped from any right to holidays or leave from work. Payment for overtime hours in work was abolished in general, only after working 61 hours in week were Poles allowed to receive a 10% higher compensation in pay (Germans were paid 100%). All employed Poles were given the lowest possible pay for their work. Overall the German policy was to create lowly educated slaves out of Poles for basic work.

=== Slave labour ===
While in General Government all Poles from age of 14 to 65 were subject to forced labour on behalf of Nazi German state, in annexed territories children had to work from the age of 9 (and in rural areas from the age of 7–8), additionally the duty to perform slave labour for Germans was extended to the age of 70 for men in annexed territories.
A network of outposts overseeing gathering of labour force was established by German authorities that coordinated forced labour together with German police units.

=== Reducing biological growth of Polish population ===
To reduce the biological growth of the Polish people, a partial ban of marriage was introduced; Polish women were allowed to marry only at the age of 25 and men at the age of 28. Married couples were separated when subjected to forced labour in Germany, and calorie intake was lowered for Poles. The forced labour working hours for both parents often meant that a child or infant was left without care and incidents and infant deaths soared. The supply of dairy and fat products for Polish children were just one-fifth of that for German children.
Likewise, the winter brought many deaths, as Germans limited the available heating supplies to 1/4 of that available to Germans. A strict ban on collecting coal left by trucks and supply wagons on the streets by non-Germans was introduced.

Within Germany, OST-Arbeiters could be aborted, even against their will and contrary to the usual Nazi law against abortions. Only if the parents appeared to be of &quot;good blood&quot; was the child to be born, and if deemed satisfactory, was removed to a Lebensborn institution. Children who failed were sent to the Ausländerkinder-Pflegestätte, where they routinely died within a few months for lack of food.

To further reduce the Polish population, a German official Krumey from occupied Łódź demanded that Polish women be kept at work until reaching 8.5 months of pregnancy. The aim was to help in miscarriage and provoke ‘accidents’ that would result in failed birth. Nevertheless, German officials remained extremely worried about Polish birth rate and various other ideas floated among German leadership how to not only reduce pregnancy, but to prevent it. Among the proposals were: garrisoning the population in labour camps, making the age of allowing marriage much higher, creating labour battalions out of the Polish population, introducing a child tax, performing abortions, an extended forced work duty during Polish lifetimes, combined with relocation to work camps, and finally sterilization of Polish women. Doubts about the ability to perform mass sterilization hindered this idea, however, as 55% of available doctors in certain parts of annexed territories were Poles and it was thought they would sabotage the action. The German state organization SD performed its own study on the problem. Among the things it concluded was the fact that the number of Poles was wrongly estimated in initial years; however, both the birth rate and survival of German children was higher than that of the Poles. The proposed solution to Polish problem was mass sterilization of lower classes (named &quot;primitives&quot; by the report), sending married Poles to slave labour in Reich. An original idea was proposed by Karl Zieger, who believed those measures to be futile. Instead, he postulated that whole Polish villages should be moved and scattered into the Reich itself.

The Nazis fell into a trap of perception—the seemingly high birth rate of Poles was a result of expelling all Poles from higher classes into the General Government; as such the Poles who remained were those with high birth rate, while those with few children were no longer present. Stripping Poles of all cultural activity by the Germans and leaving them to spend all time outside of work in homes, led to conditions favourable to sex and a rising birth rate. One practice that had terrible effects on Polish women was the refusal for female slave workers to travel home for birth. Pregnancies by Polish women-workers were subject to abortion, and in case of birth, the children were taken by SS Lebensborn. Polish slave labourers naturally were forbidden to marry. The harsh nature of the German occupation however reduced the birth rate. In Poznań, at the end of the war, the birth rate was near zero; in Łódź and Inowrocław there were more deaths than births. In comparison, the birth rate of Germans rose until the end of the war. From 1939&#x27;s birth rate survival of 850 live births per 1000 births, the rate fell to 680 per 1000 births in 1944.

=== Discrimination against the Polish language ===
A ban on the use of the Polish language was implemented in all institutions and offices in annexed territories, as well in certain public places like public transport in the cities.

A particular form of oppression was a law ordering the Poles to use German in all contacts with officials under penalty of imprisonment. Poles who did not know German had to hire a translator; however, such jobs were restricted to German authorities, and Poles with knowledge of German who helped their countrymen for free were imprisoned. This law covered all contacts between Poles and Germans and made it difficult, if not impossible, for Poles to pay obligatory taxes (which were higher for Poles) and various state-imposed donations for German society by Poles. A total ban on Polish language was proposed during the war, but as the areas still contained a large number of Poles, it was determined to be impractical at the time of the proposal. A particular form of harassment was a law requiring imprisoned Poles to communicate with their families solely in German. In practice, this meant that many families received no information on their relatives as correspondence in Polish was confiscated.

=== Discrimination in education ===

Education standards for Poles were significantly lowered, so that future Poles would become slaves to Germans. All Polish schools and cultural institutions were closed. Teaching of history, literature and geography to Poles was prohibited. Further education for &quot;racially valuable&quot; children was to be provided by removing the child to Germany for Germanization.

In some regions, schools for children were established where according to directives of Himmler:

Writing and reading were not taught. Even so, such schools covered a small number of Polish children, for example in Łódź only one-tenth of children between 9 and 13 attended them. Often under the cover of education, the Germans organised child labour, sending the children to perform hard physical work.

The Polish population was banned from performing or creating any type of music and from owning radio receivers. Distribution of Polish books was forbidden and persecuted by the German police; at the same time, Polish libraries were closed and many of their possessions destroyed. Millions of books were lost in this manner. Lending Polish books was a punishable offense for which one could be sentenced to concentration camps. Additionally, education that would enable Poles possessing skills needed in manufacturing and trade was forbidden. Poles were banned from undertaking any exams for craftsmen. Throughout the whole occupation, this law was strictly observed. In Poznań, Germans collected all Polish books and burned them.

In 1939 Polish teachers created Secret Teaching Organization an underground Polish educational organization to provide underground education in occupied Poland. Thousands of its members were arrested and killed by the Germans. It is estimated that about 15% of Polish teachers or 8,000 died during the occupation period. Extermination of teachers and scientists was part of a Nazi plan to eliminate all Polish intelligentia during action Intelligenzaktion.

=== Religious discrimination ===
The German state&#x27;s fight during the war to destroy the Polish nation covered religious life of Poles as well. Jewish Poles were hit the worst since those who had survived the first murderous actions against them in the course of the invasion were all expelled from German-annexed Poland to German-occupied Poland. Especially outspoken advocates of Judaism and all rabbis were at high risk of being murdered by the German occupiers. All synagogues were expropriated, diverted and misused, or destroyed. The same fate hit many Jewish cemeteries.

Catholic Germans of Polish ethnicity and the German state had clashed in a struggle for the unadulterated Roman Catholic faith in events like the Kulturkampf of the 19th century. In those regions of Germany with a considerable ethnic Polish population, the Catholic Church mobilised Polish resistance during the Prussian partitions of Poland and served as a stronghold of Polish identity. Due to this, the Nazis targeted it in the newly annexed territories. In the General Government the attitude of Nazis was different, as it was to serve as temporary work camp and reservation for Poles and they wanted the Church as a tool to control Poles (this also meant imprisonment or execution of priests who opposed Nazi plans). The Nazi fight against Polish parts of Catholic Church was also a problem for the Catholic Church in Germany, where many priests supported nationalist claims during the war and were faced with a split of the Church itself as Polish Catholics were persecuted. Overall the German hierarchy silently accepted (and in some cases supported or encouraged) the discrimination and treatment of Poles as Untermenschen, with notable individual exceptions who either protested or tried to help their fellow church members of non-German ethnicity.

In time, as the war continued, the growing split between German Catholics and the persecuted Polish church facing destruction worried the Vatican and the Pope himself. The annexed parts of Poland covered the dioceses located in Gniezno, Poznań, Chełmno, Katowice, Włocławek, most of Łódź and Płock, as well parts of the Warsaw diocese, Łomża, Częstochowa, and Kielce. The German authorities in line with the policy of total Germanisation aimed to completely destroy the Catholic Polish church in those locations and replace it with Catholic German priests and structures. Catholic Polish priests were to be either expelled or killed.

The main contact point for the Nazis in those plans was Carl Maria Splett, bishop of Danzig and a member of the Polish conference of bishops before 1939, who held close relations to the Nazi Albert Forster, and pursued plans to replace Polish clergy with German ones. Another notable German member of the clergy was archbishop Adolf Bertram who personally contacted the Vatican with the request to Germanise the Catholic Polish church organisation. With the position of the Catholic Church in Germany threatened itself since 1933 Bertram called for freedom of faith. Their work was helped by the fact that as German terror grew and became widely known many high-ranking members of Catholic Polish clergy sought refuge abroad to save themselves (Germans were murdering elites of Polish nation as part of their plans) and their deputies were prevented from taking office. The earliest victim was the Pomeranian Voivodeship where almost every Catholic Polish church was closed down, robbed and turned ever into some kind of warehouse, stable or depot. Catholic Polish priests faced three waves of arrests after initial massacres. Those who were arrested ended in concentration camps of Dachau and Stutthof. Monasteries were closed, their collection of arts and books stolen or destroyed by Germans. Splett cooperated with Forster and introduced 200 Catholic German priests into Chełmno diocese where he had been appointed as diocesan administrator from December 1939 on. Under his reign Polish priesthood was oppressed, and prayers and masses under his direction praised Hitler. He also issued a ban against use of Polish language in churches. When he banned confessions in Polish in May 1940 the Vatican intervened and ordered that the ban be lifted. Not only did Splett defend his ban, he argued it was to &quot;protect&quot; people making the confessions. After this argument he tried to claim that confessions in Polish are used for &quot;nationalistic means&quot;. Eventually Vatican accepted his explanation. Besides banning Polish language, Splett ordered removal of Polish signs and names in graveyards from monuments and graves and in all churches under his jurisdiction. Albert Forster praised Splett&#x27;s work for Germany.
In Wartheland the occupants decided against using German Catholic priests for Germanisation. The Polish Catholic church was to disappear completely. On 13 September 1941 Arthur Greiser issued a decree in which the German administration rejected the existence of churches as legal entities in that Reichsgau. Three weeks later majority of Catholic Polish priests were sent to concentration camps. Out of 6 bishops in the region, only one managed to remain – Walenty Dymek. It was Dymek who through his energetic protests finally started worrying the Vatican that it would eventually lose all of the Polish churches in the region-in no less than 2–3 months. The Vatican, concerned about the possibility of development of German National Catholic Church, intervened and as first step appointed two administrators-one for German and one for Polish population in the region, with Dymek appointed as administrator over the Polish population. The condition of the Roman Catholic Church in Warthegau region was catastrophic – till 1944 up to 1,300 churches and temples were closed, with 500 turned into warehouses, two were simply blown up by the Germans, others were given to congregations of the United Evangelical Church in &quot;Wartheland&quot;. Cathedrals in Poznań and Włocławek were robbed from their relics and art. Part of the looted art was destroyed by the Germans. In Gniezno the basilica was devastated. In Poznań Catholic press and organizations which formed the religious centre in the religion were destroyed. Most of religious monuments, rural crosses, small chapels were eradicated from the region as well. Access to masses was hindered, and often Germans subjected Polish worshippers leaving the church to łapanka. Up to 80% of Catholic Polish priests were to be expelled, and massive arrests followed.

The sparse Lutheran congregations of the Evangelical Church of the Augsburg Confession in Poland, e.g. in Bydgoszcz and Poznań, mostly comprising congregants from former Russian Poland, were expelled by the German occupants. Also the situation of the , mostly comprising Poles of German language, deteriorated. While its congregants, if considered by the Nazi occupants to be of &quot;good breed&quot; for their Germanisation plans in the Wartheland, were treated in a way to win them for the Nazi politics, their church body and confessors of faith underlay the same anticlerical regulations by Arthur Greiser as the Catholics. While the Polish authorities had always protracted their confirmation of the United Evangelical Church in Poland as religious statutory corporation, Greiser had done away with that status for all religious bodies in the Wartheland. Greiser pressed the United Evangelical Church in Poland down to a mere civic association. Greiser&#x27;s orders as to civic associations allowed only inhabitants who had been living before 1 September 1939 in the area of the Wartheland, and new immigrants – usually of German native language – from Soviet-annexed states (eastern Poland, Baltic states) to join these associations and only if they were not German citizens. Thus even General Superintendent Paul Blau, spiritual leader of the United Evangelical Church, who had been tolerated by the Polish authorities, although no Polish citizen, was declared a non-member of his own church body downgraded to an association, because he bore the German citizenship.

In 1940 Hanns Kerrl, the Reich&#x27;s minister of church affairs, tried to usurp competence over congregations in Danzig-West Prussia and the Wartheland. While he succeeded in Danzig-West Prussia, Greiser – with the help of Hitler – repelled Kerrl&#x27;s attempt in the Wartheland. The United Evangelical Church in Poland congregations in the Pomeranian Voivodeship could receive the status as statutory corporations – although in a dictatorship this meant little. However, therefore the church body split, its Pomerellian congregations merged in the new old-Prussian rather provisional &quot;Ecclesiastical Region of Danzig-West Prussia&quot; in 1940. The remaining United Evangelical Church in Poland had to rename into the &quot;United Evangelical Church in the Wartheland&quot;. While all Jewish clerics, and most Catholic and Lutheran clerics of Polish native language had been removed from their functions, often even killed or enjailed, pastors of the United Evangelical Church were tolerated as long they were not convicted for speaking up against the crimes in the Wartheland.

Eventually Germans abandoned any public justification or explanations regarding arrests and expulsions. From 2,500 Catholic priests in the Warthegau region 752 perished and 1/3 survived the war in prisons and concentration camps. In Poznań out of 800 Catholic Polish priests in 1939, only 34 remained in 1943. In Upper Silesia the Bishop of Katowice, Stanisław Adamski, ordered Poles to pray in German and identify as Germans. Throughout the war Adamski encouraged this with acceptance of Polish Government in Exile, in order to save the local population from German genocide. In monasteries he brought Germans who would represent them to German officials. Nevertheless, at least 60 were closed. To avoid accusations of personal interests, after issuing this call he publicly declared himself Polish. Despite Adamski&#x27;s actions the Upper Silesian Polish Catholic church was also subject of repression – 43 priests were murdered in concentration camps and prisons, 2 died in executions for their collaboration with Polish resistance, 13 were expelled to General Government (including 2 bishops), several were stripped of their function.

Many Catholic Polish priests were arrested and put into concentration camps or prisons or murdered in executions. Historic churches were destroyed, and in several cases Germans defiled icons or religious items symbolic for Polish people. Poles were forbidden to attend funerals of other Poles unless they were direct and close family of the person which died. Several Catholic Polish churches were closed down. Selected Catholic Polish religious songs banned, while books containing them were confiscated and destroyed. Polish religious organisations were dissolved. In many places objects of religious worship of significance to Poles were destroyed or defiled.

=== Judicial system ===
In judicial system the proceedings against Poles were shortened. In court Poles had no legal protection. Public whipping, beatings of Poles were allowed by German authorities. Public beatings of Poles by Germans were accepted by law as long as the beating did not &quot;lower the productivity of a Pole&quot;. German criminal law was introduced on Polish territories annexed to Reich on 6 VI 1940. It contained several parts based solely on racial and ethnic category of the person subject to trial. Special courts were established which were granted right to pass death sentences in quick and easy way. The idea that Poles and Jews just like Germans could stand before the same court was unacceptable to German authorities. The base idea of the law was to put as many as possible violations against German occupation under penalty. Prison as punishment was considered unsuitable and death sentence and whipping preferred in designed projects of the law. Additionally hard labour and very hard labour were introduced as methods of punishment. The core ideology of the law and its motivation was based on racist ideology. As the German Interior Ministry explained the foundation of the law was &quot;Polish guilt which can’t be washed away, and that proves Poles are not worthy of Europe&quot; and that the atrocious nature of Poles is the starting point of the German penal law. The new law gave almost unlimited right to pass death sentences against Poles and imprisonment in concentration camps. For example, in Katowice a special German court passed in 40% of cases deportation to Auschwitz as punishment, and in 60% of cases death penalty.
In Białystok in proceedings under the supervision of Alfred Konig, 80% of accused were sentenced to death and 15% – to concentration camps.
The harshness of German law was demonstrated by such cases, as 5 months of penal camp for a woman who smiled to English POW&#x27;s in Ostrów Wielkopolski. A 15-year-old girl who gave a cigarette to a POW was sentenced for 3 months imprisonment in concentration camp. In order to intimidate Polish population a law was passed that ordered obligatory participation in mass executions.

=== Kidnapping and murder of Polish children ===
Polish children were kidnapped for Germanization, forced labour and medical experiments. in annexed territories. They were forbidden to enter playgrounds for German children and their healthcare was lowered resulting in rising deaths among the young.

As the war continued the attitude of Poles changed from hostility to hatred towards the Germans, and while already animosity existed due to German oppression of Poles in the 19th century, the racist and genocidal actions of German state during Second World War heightened this conflict to another level.

=== Consequences ===
The repressive system unified Polish reaction to German occupation, which went above political and ideological differences. The German actions of forced resettlement and deportations in territories annexed by Nazi Germany in the end brought disadvantageous consequences for the German population. The precedent they created was used as justification in the later relocation of the German population.

== Status of German minority ==
In accordance with Nazi racial theory, the Nazis set out to cull German blood out of the mixed population, if necessary by force. Heinrich Himmler declared that no drop of German blood would be lost or left behind for an alien race.

This began with the &quot;Volksliste&quot;, the classification of people deemed of German blood into different categories: - those Germans who had collaborated before the war; those still regarding themselves as German, but who had been neutral; partially Polonised but Germanizable; and those Germans who had been absorbed into Polish nationality. Any person classified as German who resisted was to be deported to a concentration camp. Himmler himself oversaw cases of obstinate Germans, and gave orders for concentration camps, or separation of families, or forced labor, in efforts to break down resistance.

Numerous cultural events were organised for German community. A network of public schools engaging in various forms of education was set up across the territories. Reich University of Posen was set up in Poznań replacing the former Polish one. At this university, studies of Eastern Europe were conducted, including theories on extermination of non-Germans and means to Germanize the region. Chairs for race policy and Jewish history were established Local Germans organised in Selbstschutz paramilitia units engaged in arresting Jews and Poles, the oversight of their expulsions, and murder.

Nazi Germany put the Germans in a position to economically exploit the Polish society, and provided them with privileges and a comparably high standard of living at the expense of the Poles, to ensure their loyalty. While certain conditions under Nazi rule were limiting the freedoms of Germans, such as the dissolution of various German religious and political associations, the Nazi regime provided for political, cultural, and material benefits. Germans received executive positions from which people classified as &quot;Untermenschen&quot; were removed. German was made the only official language. Germans received the right to enter any Polish home at will to perform revision and identification of people living there at any time, and could acquire possessions from Poles and Jews with little effort and mostly without payment or at a low price. For example, a German could easily request a Polish house or apartment from the government, even if Poles were still living there. As the overwhelming majority of Germans in annexed authorities supported Nazi authorities and their policies, this gave the Nazi politicians a degree of self-confidence based on popular support. In Warthegau alone out of 309,002 Germans, 180,000 served in various organizations that provided assistance and were vital to Nazi plans against Poles and Jews. They provided invaluable due to their knowledge of local conditions and society. Motives for cooperation ranged from ideological support for Nazism to material opportunism.

Polish diaries and memoirs from the era remember Volksdeutsche as particularly brutal and ruthless group. Pomerania was noted as a region with very strong pro-Nazi German society by Polish observers as well as Łódź. Support for German nationalism was especially evident in regards to young part of the population, which was strongly influenced by Nazis ideology. The mass conscription of young Germans in military by 1942 was greeted with relief by the Polish population. When trains with wounded and crippled German soldiers started returning from Eastern Front they were welcomed alongside train tracks by groups of celebrating Polish population. Local Germans were rewarded for their support in genocide of Jews and Poles and invasion of Poland by high positions in administration and increased their wealth by confiscations of Polish and Jewish property. The German colonists were of wide origin and their image varied. The ones from Bessarabia were considered the worst. In all however was noted an infinite support for Hitler and belief in German state&#x27;s supremacy. Many were thankful for material benefits provided by German state. In time their attitude towards local Poles grew in harshness and ruthlessness. While some initially talked to Poles, in time as they soaked up Nazi ideology, this stopped, and some turned to violence against Poles. On farms the Poles were treated by Germans as farm animals, and some Germans treated their dogs more humanely than Polish slave labourers. Only 529 cases of friendly contacts between Poles and Germans were reported by German police in 1941 out of 786,000 Germans located in Wartheland.

=== Case study-Mława district ===
A case study of relationship of Germans towards Poles was conducted by Polish Home Army unit in Mława. From the start of the war till spring 1942 Polish Underground performed a thorough analysis of 1,100 Germans and their actions and behaviour towards Polish population. Out of those, 9 Germans engaged in friendly relationship with Poles or tried to help them (among those were 3 craftsmen, 3 policeman, 1 camp guard, 1 administration official). The group who took supported Nazis and engaged in despicable acts was much larger.

== Post-war changes ==
None of the Nazi-ordered territorial changes were recognised by the Allies of World War II, and the annexed territories became the centre of the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland after World War II. Germans living in the formerly annexed territories fled or were expelled to post-war Germany. In post-war Poland, some captured German Nazis and collaborators were put on trial. West Germany did not extradite people charged in Poland.

<text>St Albans (), also known as the City and District of St Albans, is a non-metropolitan district with both borough and city status in Hertfordshire, England. Its council is based in St Albans, the largest settlement in the district. The district also includes the town of Harpenden and several villages. The district borders North Hertfordshire, Welwyn Hatfield, Hertsmere, Watford, Three Rivers, Dacorum, and Central Bedfordshire.

==History==

The town of St Albans had been an ancient borough since 1553. It was reformed in 1836 to become a municipal borough and additionally gained city status in 1877.

The modern St Albans district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the area of three former districts, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Harpenden Urban District
*St Albans Municipal Borough
*St Albans Rural District (except the part within the designated area of Hemel Hempstead New Town, which went to Dacorum.)

The new district was named St Albans after its largest settlement. It was awarded borough status from its creation, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor, continuing the series of mayors of St Albans which had started in 1553. The city status which had been held by the old municipal borough of St Albans was extended to cover the whole of the new district on 9 July 1974. As such the council could call itself &quot;St Albans City Council&quot;, which name is sometimes used for it in official documents, but chooses to style itself &quot;St Albans City and District Council&quot; instead.

==Geography==
The largest settlement is St Albans, followed in size by Harpenden, with the main villages being Redbourn, Wheathampstead, London Colney, Chiswell Green and Bricket Wood.

Nearby towns include Hatfield and Welwyn Garden City to the east, Luton and Dunstable to the north, Hemel Hempstead to the west, Watford to the southwest and Borehamwood to the south. The district lies close to Greater London, at the closest point being less than from its outer boundary. From the centre of St Albans to the centre of London is about .

==Governance==

Hertfordshire has a two-tier structure of local government, with the ten district councils (including St Albans City and District Council) providing district-level services, and Hertfordshire County Council providing county-level services. In some areas there is an additional third tier of civil parishes.

Hertfordshire County Council is responsible for services including education, transport, fire and public safety, social care and libraries. The district council&#x27;s responsibilities include electoral services, food safety, licensing, car parks, allotments, cemeteries, grounds maintenance, leisure and theatre facilities (in Council&#x27;s ownership) museums, parks and open spaces, markets, street cleaning, management and maintenance of council owned housing, the administration of housing benefits, town planning, and building control. Parish council responsibilities include allotments, youth projects, leisure facilities, open spaces, traffic calming and community transport schemes.

===Political control===
The first elections to the district council were held in 1973, initially acting as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements took effect on 1 April 1974. Political control since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The role of mayor of St Albans is largely ceremonial. They preside at council meetings and act as first citizen of the district. They are chosen from among the councillors but are expected to maintain a non-political stance, although they do have the right to exercise a casting vote in the case of a tied vote at a meeting. The role of mayor is usually held by a different councillor each year, continuing the series of mayors of St Albans which dates back to the first borough charter of 1553.

Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 2004 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2024 election the composition of the council was:

The next election is due in May 2026.

===Premises===
The council is based at the Civic Centre on St Peter&#x27;s Street in the centre of St Albans. The building was purpose-built for the council in 1989 and incorporates an emergency bunker in the basement, now used as committee rooms.

==Elections==

Since the last boundary changes in 2022 the council has comprised 56 councillors, with the district being divided into 20 wards, each electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held three years out of every four, electing roughly a third of the council each time. Elections to Hertfordshire County Council are held in the fourth year of the cycle when there are no district council elections.

===Wards===
The district&#x27;s wards are:
* Batchwood
* Bernards Heath

Harpenden&#x27;s parish council takes the style &quot;town council&quot;. The area of the pre-1974 borough of St Albans is an unparished area, where local affairs are discussed by a City Neighbourhoods Committee comprising the district councillors for that area.

==Economy==

<text>Harpenden () is a town and civil parish in the City and District of St Albans in the county of Hertfordshire, England. The population of the built-up area was 30,674 in the 2021 census, while the population of the civil parish was 31,128. Harpenden is a commuter town, with a direct rail connection to Central London.

==History==
There is evidence of pre-Roman Belgic farmers in the area. In 1867, several items were found including a bronze escutcheon, rams-head shaped mounts, and a bronze bowl.

There are Roman remains in land around Harpenden, such as the site of a mausoleum in the park at Rothamsted. A tumulus near the river Lea was opened in the 1820s and it contained a stone sarcophagus of Romano-Celtic origin. Five objects dating from around 150 AD, were inside, including a glass jug with a Mediterranean stamp and samian ware dishes used for libations.

Up to the 13th century, the area of the parish consisted of woodland with small hamlets and single farmsteads around cleared areas called &quot;End&quot; or &quot;Green&quot;; today, there are 19 Ends and 18 Greens in the areas of Harpenden and Wheathampstead parishes.

Harpenden village grew out of Westminster Abbey’s gradual clearing of woodland for farming and settlement within its Wheathampstead manor, granted by Edward the Confessor in 1060. The first reference to a parish church was in 1221 (when it was referred to as Harpendene) so it is inferred that the village grew up around then. The church of St Nicholas is the oldest church in the town, originally built as a Chapel of ease in 1217.

Just beyond the southern edge of the town lies Nomansland Common (sometimes simply called &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;) upon which part of the Second Battle of St Albans was fought during the Wars of the Roses. Nomansland Common also saw the first annually contested steeplechase in England, in 1830, when it was organised by Thomas Coleman, and the last fight of 19th-century bare-knuckle fighter Simon Byrne. It was also the haunt of the highwaywoman Lady Katherine Ferrers, better known as the &quot;Wicked Lady&quot;.

A widespread but now little-known industry of Harpenden was straw-weaving, a trade mainly carried out by women in the 19th century. A good straw weaver could make as much as a field labourer. The straw plaits were taken to specialist markets in St Albans or Luton and bought by dealers to be converted into straw items such as boaters and other hats or bonnets.

The arrival of the railway system from 1860 and the sale of farms for residential development after 1880 radically changed Harpenden&#x27;s surroundings. First the Dunstable Branch of the Great Northern Railway passed through the Batford area, with a station later named Harpenden East railway station (this line is now closed and forms a cycle track). The Midland Railway main line was built in 1868 with a station near the main village, which still exists today, and the listed Southdown Road Skew Bridge nearby. The Harpenden and Hemel Hempstead Railway, known locally as the Nicky Line was opened in 1877.

Between 1848 and 1914 the common was a regular venue for horse racing. In his &quot;History of Hertfordshire&quot; in 1879, John Edwin Cussans commented &quot;Notwithstanding that these meetings are under the most unexceptional patronage as regards the Stewards, yet for two days in the year all the London pickpockets, sharpers and blackguards who happen to be out of gaol are permitted to make Harpenden their own and to make travelling in a first-class carriage on the Midland Railway a danger to men and an impossibility to ladies.&quot; Golf has been played on the Common since 1894 and it was at that time Harpenden Golf Club was set up by a group of Harpenden people with the help and a financial contribution of 5 pounds from Sir John Bennet Lawes of Rothamsted Manor. The club moved to a new course at Hammonds End in 1931, at which time Harpenden Common Golf Club was formed by those who wanted to remain at the Common. In 1932 Bamville Cricket club was formed and shares part of the Common with the Golfers.

Harpenden is the home of Rothamsted Manor and Rothamsted Research (formerly Rothamsted Experimental Station and later the Institute of Arable Crops Research), a leading centre for agricultural research. In front of its main building, which faces the common, is a stone, erected in 1893, commemorating 50 years of experiments by Sir John Bennet Lawes and Joseph Henry Gilbert..

Lawes inherited the family estate at Rothamsted in 1834. Acknowledged as &quot;the father of agricultural science&quot;, his early field experiments on Hertfordshire farms led him to patent a phosphate fertiliser, the sales of which enriched him immensely. With the proceeds, he established the experimental station, building laboratories in the 1850s. The station continued the development of the artificial fertilisers on which most modern farmers now depend. Some of the long-term &#x27;classical field experiments&#x27; begun by Lawes and Gilbert remain in place to this day (such as Broadbalk) representing a unique resource for agricultural and environmental research.

In 1913 the National Children’s Home moved to Harpenden with a large site Highfield Oval which was home to over 200 children. The site featured a print works, a carpenters’ and joiners’ shop, a bootmakers shop and a farm where boys undertook apprenticeships. Girls were mainly trained in domestic service with some being trained in sewing and office work. The children lived in a &quot;family&quot; of 8-10 children each run by a sister or house mother. The chapel was gift from Joseph Rank and was built in 1928. The home was run on site until 1985. The site is now the head office of Youth with a Mission an international Christian missionary organization. The Harpenden Growth Study, one of the earliest longitudinal tests, was overseen by James Mourilyan Tanner and monitored the development of many of the children over a number of years.

During the Second World War, Harpenden was used to evacuate children from heavily bombed London. However, Harpenden was not totally confident in its safety, as evidenced by the now decaying Bowers Parade air raid shelters, soon to be secured for the future. It has been suggested both that it be used for educational and emergency training purposes.

The Harpenden and District Local History Society has a collection of local material and archives which can be consulted, and holds regular meetings on topics of historical interest.

==Geography==
There are two civil parishes: Harpenden and Harpenden Rural. The town straddles two valleys; a dry valley to the south-west containing the town centre and Harpenden Common, and the valley of the River Lea to the north-east, containing the Batford area.

As Harpenden is located in Hertfordshire, just outside London, it is an area of extremely high property costs. Land Registry data suggests that the average house price in Harpenden in the 1st quarter of 2006 was £500,902, compared to £287,277 for the St Albans district generally and £183,598 nationally. The data also indicates that an unusually high proportion of houses in Harpenden are owner occupied (81.4%, as opposed to 69.6% in the district generally and 66.2% nationally). The average price of a detached house is over £900,000 as of January 2012.

Harpenden has a large number of its streets named after English literary figures on the east side of the town (an area known, unsurprisingly, as the &quot;Poets&#x27; Corner&quot;), including Byron Road, Cowper Road, Kipling Way, Milton Road, Shakespeare Road, Spenser Road, Shelley Court, Tennyson Road, Townsend Road, Masefield Road and Wordsworth Road.

==Governance==

There are three tiers of local government covering Harpenden, at parish (town), district and county level: Harpenden Town Council, St Albans City and District Council and Hertfordshire County Council. The town council is based at Harpenden Town Hall on Leyton Road.

Harpenden is also part of the Harpenden and Berkhamsted UK Parliament constituency, represented by Victoria Collins of the Liberal Democrats.

Harpenden was anciently part of the parish of Wheathampstead, in the hundred of Dacorum. The chapelry of Harpenden was treated as a separate civil parish from an early date, having its own church wardens and parish registers from the sixteenth century. An order to create a separate parish of Harpenden was made in 1656, but does not appear to have been carried out. Harpenden was eventually made a separate ecclesiastical parish in 1859.

From 1835 Harpenden was included within the St Albans Poor Law Union. As such, Harpenden became part of the St Albans Rural Sanitary District in 1872, which in turn became the St Albans Rural District under the Local Government Act 1894. The 1894 Act also created parish councils. Harpenden Parish Council held its first meeting on 31 December 1894, with Captain Arthur Lydekker, a Conservative, being elected the first chairman. The parish council held its meetings at the Harpenden Institute at 12 Southdown Road (then called Wheathampstead Road).
Shortly after the creation of St Albans Rural District, efforts began to make Harpenden an urban district. It was decided that the whole parish of Harpenden was not suitable to become an urban district, with the west of the parish remaining largely rural. As such, Harpenden was split into two parishes on 15 April 1898, called Harpenden Urban and Harpenden Rural. The Harpenden Rural parish remained part of St Albans Rural District, whilst the Harpenden Urban parish became independent as Harpenden Urban District. Arthur Lydekker, who had been chairman of the old Harpenden Parish Council, was appointed the first chairman of Harpenden Urban District Council.
Until September 1899, Harpenden Urban District Council held its meetings at the Harpenden Institute, as the parish council had done. On the opposite side of the Common was the British School on Leyton Road. The school had been built in 1850 but was vacated in 1897 when the school moved to new premises on Victoria Road. The council took a lease of the old British School from its owners, the Lawes family of Rothamsted, and the building was opened as the &quot;Public Hall&quot; in September 1899, acting as the council&#x27;s meeting place and offices as well as providing a public hall.

In 1932 the council bought Harpenden Hall at 6 Southdown Road for £7,000 and converted it to act as offices and meeting place, moving into the building in early 1933. A new Public Hall was built in the former gardens of Harpenden Hall in 1938. The old public hall on Leyton Road became known as Park Hall.

The council was granted a coat of arms on 4 February 1949.

Harpenden Urban District Council was abolished under the Local Government Act 1972, becoming part of the new district of St Albans on 1 April 1974. A successor parish was created for the former urban district, called Harpenden Town Council. The town council continued to be based at Harpenden Hall until 1996, when it moved to a new Town Hall built as a rear extension to the urban district council&#x27;s former home of Park Hall.

==Transport==
===Railway===
Harpenden railway station is a stop on the Thameslink route. Govia Thameslink Railway operates frequent services between , , and London St Pancras. Southbound services continue through and , then on to (via ), or . The rail link therefore gives direct access to Luton Airport (one stop north) and Gatwick Airport, taking approximately 1hr 10 m on a limited stops train.

The Nickey Line railway linked Harpenden, Redbourn and Hemel Hempstead; also served the north-west of the town. The line opened in 1877 and was closed in 1979; the trackbed was converted to a shared-use path in 1985, forming part of the National Cycle Network.

===Roads===
The A6 used to run through Harpenden, although the road numbering was changed to avoid congestion. The M1 runs nearby, with access from junction 9 at Redbourn and Dunstable or alternatively at junction 10 for Luton Airport.

===Buses===
The town is served by several bus operators, including Arriva Shires &amp; Essex, Centrebus, Red Eagle Travel, Red Rose and Uno. The main routes are:

Harpenden also has a charity-run community HH1 bus service called the &quot;Harpenden Hopper&quot;, which is a hail and ride service operating around the town on weekdays.

==Economy==

Harpenden is a prosperous town. In an analysis of the average income tax paid by constituency, Hitchin and Harpenden came tenth. In a list of the most valuable commuter areas compiled by Savills Research, Harpenden came seventh. Good transport links to central London have been cited as a key factor.

Rothamsted Research, the largest agricultural research centre in the UK, is based in Harpenden. It was founded in 1843.

==Shopping==
Harpenden has many shops commonly found in other English towns, with three central supermarkets (Sainsbury&#x27;s, Marks and Spencer, and Waitrose), multiple female clothes shops, charity shops, banks, estate agents and chemists. A good proportion of these are run by independent retailers. Cafes are also common in Harpenden, but with only three commercial chains (Costa Coffee, Caffè Nero, and Gail&#x27;s); the rest are owned independently. There are multiple restaurants, mainly of Italian origin, and many pubs. Batford, Southdown, and Luton Road districts also have their own shopping areas.

==Parks and commons==

A notable feature of Harpenden is its abundant parks and commons. The central area of Harpenden is characterised by Church Green, Leyton Green and the High Street Greens, which give the town its provincial feel.

Just south of the town centre is Harpenden Common, stretching from the shops in the town centre for more than to the south, encompassing a total of . Today Harpenden Common hosts two cricket clubs: Harpenden Cricket Club, a Hertfordshire Premier League club that celebrated its 150 anniversary in 2013, and Bamville Cricket Club, which plays on Sundays on the golf course. There is also a football club, bridleways, ramblers&#x27; paths and Harpenden Common Golf Club, all contained in an area of natural beauty that was awarded a national Green Flag Award in 2007. Harpenden Town Council is keen to help retain and maintain the environment and oversees habitat management, including bird and bat watching, and the maintenance/regeneration of gorse, fungi and other fauna and flora for the benefit of the people of Harpenden.

Since 1894, Harpenden Common Golf Club has traditionally maintained a large part of the common and today works closely with Harpenden Town Council and countryside management. This partnership has enabled the people of Harpenden to take full advantage of the common for all kinds of leisure activities.

In addition the town has large green public spaces available in Rothamsted Park, Batford Park, Kinsbourne Green, Lydekker Park and the Nickey Line, which bisects the town.

Just to the south of Harpenden is the large expanse of Nomansland Common.

<text>Diphosgene is an organic chemical compound with the formula ClCO2CCl3. This colorless liquid is a valuable reagent in the synthesis of organic compounds. Diphosgene is related to phosgene and has comparable toxicity, but is more conveniently handled because it is a liquid, whereas phosgene is a gas.

==Production and uses==
Diphosgene is prepared by radical chlorination of methyl chloroformate under UV light:

:Cl-CO-OCH3 + 3 Cl2 —(hv)→ Cl-CO-OCCl3 + 3 HCl
Another method is the radical chlorination of methyl formate:

:H-CO-OCH3 + 4 Cl2 —(hv)→ Cl-CO-OCCl3 + 4 HCl

Diphosgene converts to phosgene upon heating or upon catalysis with charcoal. It is thus useful for reactions traditionally relying on phosgene. For example, it convert amines into isocyanates, secondary amines into carbamoyl chlorides, carboxylic acids into acid chlorides, and formamides into isocyanides. Diphosgene serves as a source of two equivalents of phosgene:
:2 RNH2 + ClCO2CCl3 → 2 RNCO + 4 HCl

With α-amino acids diphosgene gives the acid chloride-isocyanates, OCNCHRCOCl, or &quot;N&quot;-carboxy-amino acid anhydrides depending on the conditions.

It hydrolyzes to release HCl in humid air.

Diphosgene is used in some laboratory preparations because it is easier to handle than phosgene.

==Role in warfare==
Diphosgene was originally developed as a pulmonary agent for chemical warfare, a few months after the first use of phosgene. It was used as a poison gas in artillery shells by Germany during World War I. The first recorded battlefield use was in May 1916. Diphosgene was developed because the vapors could destroy the filters of the gas masks in use at the time.

==Safety==
Diphosgene has a relatively high vapor pressure of 10 mm Hg (1.3 kPa) at 20 °C and decomposes to phosgene around 300 °C. Exposure to diphosgene is similar in hazard to phosgene.

<text>Craig Kenneth Bruderlin (born July 18, 1940), known professionally as James Brolin, is an American actor. Brolin has won two Golden Globes and an Emmy. He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on August 27, 1998. Brolin is the father of actor Josh Brolin and the husband of Barbra Streisand.

Brolin is best known for his TV roles such as Steven Kiley on &quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.&quot;(1969–1976), Peter McDermott on &quot;Hotel&quot; (1983–1988), John Short on &quot;Life in Pieces&quot; (2015–2019), and the Narrator on &quot;Sweet Tooth&quot; and his film roles such as Sgt. Jerome K. Weber in &quot;Skyjacked&quot; (1972), John Blane in &quot;Westworld&quot; (1973), General Ralph Landry in &quot;Traffic&quot; (2000), Jack Barnes in &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; (2002), and Emperor Zurg in the 2022 &quot;Toy Story&quot; spin-off film &quot;Lightyear&quot;.

==Early life==
Brolin was born Craig Kenneth Bruderlin in Westwood Village, Los Angeles, California. The eldest of two brothers and two sisters, he is the son of Helen Sue (&quot;née&quot; Mansur) (1916–2014), a housewife, and Henry Hurst Bruderlin (1911–2002), a building contractor. As a young child, Brolin was interested in animals and in model aeroplanes, which he began building and flying when he was 10. As a teenaged filmgoer in the mid-1950s, Brolin was particularly fascinated with actor James Dean, and he began shooting 8 mm films. When his parents invited a director over to his family&#x27;s house for dinner before auditioning, Brolin met another fellow actor and classmate, Ryan O&#x27;Neal, who was about a year younger than Brolin. The two clicked and later enrolled in University High School located in West Los Angeles. However, Brolin&#x27;s own acting exposed his stifling shyness. His assurance grew when O&#x27;Neal invited him to a casting agency. Brolin graduated from high school in 1958, and his family was already encouraging him to become an actor like O&#x27;Neal.

==Career==

===Early career===
Brolin attended Santa Monica City College and studied drama at the University of California Los Angeles before signing a contract with 20th Century Fox in 1960. At Fox, he started out as a contract player in Sandra Dee movies. Brolin appeared on an episode of &quot;Bus Stop&quot; in 1961. The part led to parts in other television productions such as &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot;; &quot;Margie&quot;; &quot;Love, American Style&quot;; &quot;Twelve O&#x27;Clock High&quot;; and &quot;The Long, Hot Summer&quot;. He made three guest appearances on the popular 1960s series &quot;Batman&quot;, alongside Adam West and Burt Ward, as well as roles in &quot;The Virginian&quot;, and &quot;Owen Marshall: Counselor at Law&quot; alongside Arthur Hill and Lee Majors. He also had a recurring role on the short-lived television series &quot;The Monroes&quot;.

At age 20, Brolin changed his surname from &quot;Bruderlin&quot; to &quot;Brolin&quot; to become James Brolin (&quot;Bruder&quot; is the German word for &quot;brother&quot;). While in school struggling to make it big, he met actor Clint Eastwood. Brolin also had small roles in several films including &quot;Take Her, She&#x27;s Mine&quot; (1963), &quot;Dear Brigitte&quot; (1965), &quot;Von Ryan&#x27;s Express&quot; (1965), and &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot; (1966). The following year, his first big role was in &quot;The Cape Town Affair&quot; (1967), but it did not receive any success at the box office. Brolin was ultimately fired by 20th Century Fox.
In 1969, he co-starred in the TV series &quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.&quot;, portraying a doctor.

===Film===
In the 1970s, Brolin was and began appearing in leading roles in films, including &quot;Skyjacked&quot; (1972) and &quot;Westworld&quot; (1973). By the mid-1970s, he was a regular leading man in films, starring in &quot;Gable and Lombard&quot; (1976), &quot;The Car&quot; (1977), &quot;Capricorn One&quot; (1978, in which he costarred with Elliott Gould, Streisand&#x27;s ex-husband), &quot;The Amityville Horror&quot; (1979), &quot;Night of the Juggler&quot; (1980), and &quot;High Risk&quot; (1981). When Roger Moore expressed his desire to vacate the role of James Bond, Brolin undertook screen tests to replace him in &quot;Octopussy&quot; (1983). It has been reported that not only were these successful, but Brolin was about to move to London to begin work on the film when the producers persuaded Moore to continue.

In 1985, Brolin parodied his near-hiring as James Bond in the film &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot;. In a film within the film, Brolin merged the characters of Bond and Pee-wee Herman, the &quot;real&quot; version of whom was played by Paul Reubens. He is referred to as &quot;PW&quot; and the role of Pee-wee&#x27;s girlfriend &quot;Dottie&quot; is played by Morgan Fairchild.

===Television===

While contracted to Fox, Brolin had three small roles on the television series &quot;Batman&quot;, in the episodes &quot;The Cat and the Fiddle&quot;, &quot;The Catwoman Goeth&quot;, and &quot;Ring Around the Riddler&quot;.

In 1968, Brolin transferred to Universal Studios, where he auditioned for a co-starring role opposite seasoned actor Robert Young in the popular medical drama &quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.&quot; (1969–1976). The series was one of the top-rated television shows of the day. Brolin became widely known for his portrayal of youthful, skilled assistant physician Dr. Steven Kiley. The chemistry between Young &amp; Brolin clicked, and even came to attract young women for its medical interest throughout the show&#x27;s run. In its first season in 1970, Brolin won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role and was subsequently nominated thrice more. He was also nominated for Golden Globes three times for Best Supporting Actor and won twice between 1971 and 1973. Brolin also starred in the television films &quot;Short Walk to Daylight&quot; (1972) and &quot;Trapped&quot; (1973). He and his first wife Jane also appeared on several episodes of the 1970s game show &quot;Tattletales&quot;.

In 1983, Brolin returned to television to star in another series and teamed with producer Aaron Spelling&#x27;s prime-time soap opera, &quot;Hotel&quot;, for ABC. On &quot;Hotel&quot;, Brolin played Peter McDermott, a hotel manager.

For &quot;Hotel&quot;, Brolin was nominated twice for Golden Globes between 1983 and 1984 for Best Performance By an Actor in a TV Series but lost both times. He would also eventually serve as a director on the show. On one episode of &quot;Hotel&quot;, Brolin invited his future wife Jan Smithers to guest-star on the show as the writers suggested that they develop a storyline for them, as Brolin was going through a difficult divorce at the time. By 1988, after five seasons, &quot;Hotel&quot; was about to close its doors for good and the show was cancelled. That same year, his co-star, Nathan Cook had died of an allergic reaction to penicillin, and Brolin along with the rest of the cast attended Cook&#x27;s funeral.

Actress Connie Sellecca said of Brolin&#x27;s on-screen chemistry with her on &quot;Hotel&quot;, &quot;I remember instantly feeling comfortable with Jim, and that&#x27;s the thing that Jim has as to women, most women, they need to feel safe, and Jim gets that.&quot; Sellecca also said, &quot;To have him in a different role and have that confidence, it was a wonderful experience.&quot; After the show&#x27;s cancellation, Sellecca continues to be good friends with Brolin. In 1992, her mentor was in attendance at her wedding to John Tesh.

As the new decade approached, Brolin starred in both &quot;Angel Falls&quot; for CBS and &quot;Extreme&quot; for ABC, although neither matched the popularity of his earlier series.

In 1997, Brolin&#x27;s luck changed with the syndicated television series &quot;&quot;. He played the role of Lt. Col. Bill &quot;Raven&quot; Kelly, whose job was to teach young Marines in a special unit, before being promoted to work with a group of talented Marine fighter pilots. Brolin served as an executive producer and director on the series. However, the show was cancelled in 2000 after 66 episodes due to low ratings.

In 1997, Brolin also hosted &quot;Beyond Belief: Fact or Fiction&quot;, a television series that shows five stories which have to do with the paranormal and supernatural. Jonathan Frakes took his place after the first season of the show. That same year, Brolin guest-starred on &quot;Roseanne&quot;. In Part 1 (&quot;Lanford&#x27;s Elite&quot;), Roseanne &amp; Jackie go to a luncheon at the Lanford Country Club, where they meet the son of their old boss Edgar Wellman Jr. (Brolin) of the Wellman Plastics factory. It appears that the factory is in need of financial help and Roseanne&#x27;s money could save the factory. In Part 2 (&quot;Some Enchanted Merger&quot;), once the Wellman Plastics buyout is completed, Roseanne is at a loss for what to do when a mutual attraction springs between herself and Wellman.

===Since 2000===
Brolin has had a number of supporting roles in major cinema releases since 2000. These include (amongst others) the role of General Ralph Landry, outgoing director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy in Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s Oscar-winning &quot;Traffic&quot; (2000); as Jack Barnes in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; (2002); a minor role in the 2003 comedy &quot;A Guy Thing&quot;; as philandering husband Robert Hatch in the 2006 comedy &quot;The Alibi&quot; (released in the UK as &quot;Lies and Alibis&quot;); as Jack Jennings in the 2007 film &quot;The American Standards&quot;; as TV network anchor Frank Harris in Richard Shepard&#x27;s &quot;The Hunting Party&quot; (2007); and as Brian in Joel Hopkins&#x27; 2008 film &quot;Last Chance Harvey&quot; with Emma Thompson and Dustin Hoffman.

In 2002, Brolin played Governor Robert Ritchie of Florida, the Republican opponent of President Jed Bartlet, on the TV series &quot;The West Wing&quot;.

In late 2003, Brolin portrayed Ronald Reagan in the television film &quot;The Reagans&quot;. The film was originally meant to air on CBS, but after creative differences, scripts controversies, and rising costs, CBS passed on the film, and it aired on cable channel Showtime, also owned by Viacom. The role earned Brolin his fifth Emmy Award nomination, as well as his fifth Golden Globe nomination.

In 2005, Brolin guest starred on the TV series &quot;Monk&quot; as casino owner Daniel Thorn. In 2006, Brolin appeared in the A&amp;E Network film &quot;Wedding Wars&quot;, playing an anti-gay marriage governor. In 2008, Brolin guest starred on &quot;Law &amp; Order: SVU&quot; as astronaut Col. Dick Finley. The same year, Brolin also starred in the lead role in the Sci-Fi Channel film &quot;Lost City Raiders&quot;.

Brolin appeared in the 2009 comedy film &quot;The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard&quot;. He also appeared in a 2009 episode of &quot;Psych&quot;, titled &quot;High Noon-ish&quot;, where Brolin played the sheriff of a tourist-attracting &quot;Wild West&quot; town. The episode was in part a parody of the 1973 film &quot;Westworld&quot;, in which he had starred.

Brolin has played Richard Castle&#x27;s mysterious father in two episodes of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Castle&quot;, in 2013 and 2014. He appeared in the NBC sitcom &quot;Community&quot; as William Winger, Jeff Winger&#x27;s estranged father.

From 2015 until 2019, Brolin played the role of John, the family patriarch, in the CBS comedy &quot;Life in Pieces&quot;.

In his first role in an animated film, Brolin portrayed Emperor Zurg in the 2022 &quot;Toy Story&quot; spin-off film &quot;Lightyear&quot;.

==Personal life==

Brolin has been married three times and has three children.

In 1966, Brolin married Jane Cameron Agee, a wildlife activist and aspiring actress at Twentieth Century Fox, 12 days after they first met. The couple had their first child, Josh, in 1968, and a second child in 1972. They were divorced in 1984. Jane died in a car accident on February 13, 1995, a day after Josh&#x27;s 27th birthday. Josh said on the October 14, 2008, episode of the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; that his parents met on the TV series &quot;Batman&quot;, where his mother was assistant casting director.

In the late 1970s, Brolin started a brief but relatively successful career in sports car racing. After success in several celebrity auto races, he entered the 1979 24 Hours Nürburgring as part of the AMC Spirit team. Brolin&#x27;s two-car team, which included accomplished racer Lyn St. James, finished both first and second in class.

In 1985, Brolin met actress Jan Smithers on the set of &quot;Hotel&quot;, and they married in 1986. The couple had a daughter in 1987. Smithers filed for divorce from Brolin in 1995. 

In 1996, Brolin met Barbra Streisand through a friend, and they got married on July 1, 1998. The couple resides in Malibu, California. Brolin is the stepfather of Streisand&#x27;s only child, Jason Gould. Streisand revealed in her 2023 memoir &quot;My Name Is Barbra&quot; that a comment made by Brolin just after their marriage inspired Diane Warren to write the song &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Miss a Thing&quot; for the 1998 science fiction disaster film &quot;Armageddon&quot;.

<text>The Elektronika 60 () is a computer made in the Soviet Union by Elektronika in Voronezh from 1978 until 1991. It is a rack-mounted system with no built-in display or storage devices. It was usually paired with a 15IE-00-013 terminal and I/O devices. The main logic unit is located on the M2 CPU board. As an unlicensed clone implementation of the DEC PDP-11/23, the Elektronika 60 is generally software-compatible, could use much of the same peripherals, and physically resembles that model.

The original implementation of &quot;Tetris&quot; was written for the Elektronika 60 by Alexey Pajitnov in 1985. As the Elektronika 60 does not have raster graphics, text characters were used to form the blocks.

<doc id="352521" wikidata="Q612523" url="?curid=352521" title="Moll Flanders">
<text>Moll Flanders is a novel by Daniel Defoe, first published in 1722. It purports to be the true account of the life of the eponymous Moll, detailing her exploits from birth until old age.

By 1721, Defoe had become a recognised novelist, with the success of &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; in 1719. His political work was tapering off at this point, due to the fall of both Whig and Tory party leaders with whom he had been associated; Robert Walpole was beginning his rise, and Defoe was never fully at home with Walpole&#x27;s group. Defoe&#x27;s Whig views are nevertheless evident in the story of Moll, and the novel&#x27;s full title gives some insight into this and the outline of the plot.

It is usually assumed that the novel was written by Daniel Defoe, and his name is commonly given as the author in modern printings of the novel. However, the original printing did not have an author, as it was an apparent autobiography. The attribution of &quot;Moll Flanders&quot; to Defoe was made by bookseller Francis Noble in 1770, after Defoe&#x27;s death in 1731. The novel is based partially on the life of Moll King, a London criminal whom Defoe met while visiting Newgate Prison.

Historically, the book was occasionally the subject of police censorship.

==Plot==

Moll&#x27;s mother is a convict in Newgate Prison in London who is given a reprieve by &quot;pleading her belly,&quot; a reference to the custom of postponing the executions of pregnant criminals. Her mother is eventually transported to British America, and Moll Flanders (not her birth name, she emphasises, taking care not to reveal it) is raised from the age of three until adolescence by a kindly foster mother. Thereafter she gets attached to a household as a servant where she is loved by both sons, the elder of whom convinces her to &quot;act like they were married&quot; in bed. Unwilling to marry her, he persuades her to marry his younger brother. After five years of marriage, she then is widowed, leaves her children in the care of in-laws, and begins honing the skill of passing herself off as a fortuned widow to attract a man who will marry her and provide her with security.

The first time she does this, her &quot;gentleman-tradesman&quot; spendthrift husband goes bankrupt and flees to mainland Europe, leaving her on her own with his blessing to do the best she can to forget him. (They had one child together, but &quot;it was buried.&quot;) The second time, she makes a match that leads her to Virginia Colony with a kindly man who introduces her to his mother. After three children (one dies), Moll learns that her mother-in-law is actually her biological mother, which makes her husband her half-brother. She dissolves their marriage and after continuing to live with her brother for three years, travels back to England, leaving her two children behind, and goes to live in Bath to seek a new husband.

Again she returns to her con skills and develops a relationship with a man in Bath whose wife is elsewhere confined due to insanity. Their relationship is at first platonic, but eventually develops into Moll becoming something of a &quot;kept woman&quot; in Hammersmith, London. They have three children (one lives), but after a severe illness he repents, breaks off the arrangement, and commits to his wife. However, he assures Moll that their son will be well cared for, so she leaves yet another child behind.

Moll, now 42, resorts to another beau, a bank clerk, who while still married to an adulterous wife (a &quot;whore&quot;), proposes to Moll after she entrusts him with her financial holdings. While waiting for the banker to divorce, Moll pretends to have a great fortune to attract another wealthy husband in Lancashire, assisted by a new female acquaintance who attests to Moll&#x27;s (fictitious) social standing. The ruse is successful and she marries a supposedly rich man who claims to own property in Ireland. They each quickly realise that they were both conned and manipulated by the acquaintance. He discharges her from the marriage, telling her nevertheless that she should inherit any money he might ever get. After enjoying each other&#x27;s company for about a month, they part ways, but Moll soon discovers that she is pregnant. She gives birth and the midwife gives a tripartite scale of the costs of bearing a child, with one value level per social class. She continues to correspond with the bank clerk, hoping he will still have her.

Moll leaves her newborn in the care of a countrywoman in exchange for the sum of £5 a year. Moll marries the banker, but realises &quot;what an abominable creature I am! and how this innocent gentleman is going to be abused by me!&quot; They live in happiness for five years before he becomes bankrupt and dies of despair, the fate of their two children left unstated.

Truly desperate now, Moll begins a career of artful thievery, which, by employing her wits, beauty, charm, and femininity, as well as hard-heartedness and wickedness, brings her the financial security she has always sought. She becomes well known among those &quot;in the trade,&quot; and is given the name Moll Flanders. She is helped throughout her career as a thief by her Governess, who also acts as receiver. (During this time she briefly becomes the mistress of a man she robbed.) Moll is finally caught by two maids whilst trying to steal from a house.

In Newgate she is led to her repentance. At the same time, she reunites with her soulmate, her &quot;Lancashire husband&quot;, who is also jailed for his robberies (before and after they first met, he acknowledges). Moll is found guilty of felony, but not burglary, the second charge; still, the sentence is death in any case. Yet Moll convinces a minister of her repentance, and together with her Lancashire husband is transported to the Colonies to avoid hanging, where they live happily together (she even talks the ship&#x27;s captain into letting them stay in his quarters, apart from the other convicts, who are sold on arrival). Once in the colonies, Moll learns her mother has left her a plantation and that her own son (by her brother) is alive, as is her husband/brother.

Moll carefully introduces herself to her brother and their son, in disguise. With the help of a Quaker, the two found a farm with 50 servants in Maryland. Moll reveals herself now to her son in Virginia and he gives her her mother&#x27;s inheritance, a farm for which he will now be her steward, providing £100 a year income for her. In turn, she makes him her heir and gives him a (stolen) gold watch.

At last, her life of conniving and desperation seems to be over. After her husband/brother dies, Moll tells her (Lancashire) husband the entire story and he is &quot;perfectly easy on that account... For, said he, it was no fault of yours, nor of his; it was a mistake impossible to be prevented.&quot; Aged 69 (in 1683), the two return to England to live &quot;in sincere penitence for the wicked lives we have lived.&quot;

==Gender roles==
According to Swaminathan (2003), &quot;Moll Flanders&quot; provides a window into women’s ways of being that do not reflect 18th century gender norms. Moll is reliant on alliances and friendships with women, many of whom also fall outside of the gendered expectations of the era, she marries five times, and she has sexual relationships outside of marriage.

One of Defoe’s notable contributions to 18th century ideas of female empowerment rests on the notion of women as agents of their own wealth. As Kuhlisch notes, “From the beginning, [Moll] does not believe that she is naturally poor but considers herself entitled to a more affluent life… [and she] defines her identity through her social position, which results from the material effects of her economic activities&quot; (341). That said, it may also be Defoe&#x27;s “antipathy for England&#x27;s commoners” that contributed to Moll&#x27;s socioeconomic ascension (p. 99).

==Spiritual autobiography==
One of the major themes within the book, and a popular area of scholarly research regarding its writer Daniel Defoe, is that of spiritual autobiography. Spiritual autobiography is defined as &quot;a genre of non-fiction prose that dominated Protestant writing during the seventeenth century, particularly in England, particularly that of dissenters&quot;. Books within this genre follow a pattern of shallow repentances, followed by a fall back into sin, and eventually culminating in a conversion experience that has a profound impact on the course of their life from that point. The two scholars to first analyze the pattern of spiritual autobiography in Defoe&#x27;s works, publishing within the same year, were George A. Starr and J. Paul Hunter.

George Starr&#x27;s book, titled &quot;Defoe and Spiritual Autobiography&quot;, analyses the pattern of spiritual autobiography, and how it is found in Defoe&#x27;s books. His focus in the book is primarily on Robinson Crusoe, as that is Defoe&#x27;s book that follows the clearest pattern of spiritual autobiography. He does discuss &quot;Moll Flanders&quot; at length, stating that the disconnectedness of the events in the book can be attributed to the book&#x27;s spiritual autobiographical nature. He examines the pattern of spiritual autobiography in these events, with the beginning of her fall into sin being a direct results of her vanity prevailing over her virtue. Moll&#x27;s &quot;abortive repentances&quot; are highlighted, such as her &quot;repentance&quot; after marrying the bank clerk. However, Moll is unable to break the pattern of sin that she falls into, one of habitual sin, in which one sin leads to another. Starr describes this gradual process as &quot;hardening&quot;, and points to it as what makes up the basic pattern of her spiritual development. In examining her conversion experience, Starr highlights her motive as being &quot;the reunion with her Lancashire husband, and the news that she is to be tried at the next Session, caused her &#x27;wretched boldness of spirit&#x27; to abate. &#x27;I began to think,’ she says, &#x27;and to think indeed is one real advance from hell to heaven&quot; (157). The final culmination of her repentance then comes the morning after this moment, when reflecting on the words of the minister that she confessed her sins to. Starr&#x27;s main criticism of the book as a work of spiritual autobiography stems from the fact that only part, and not all, of Moll&#x27;s actions contain spiritual significance. The overall pattern is consistent, but does not cover all sections, with some of those other sections focusing in more on social issues/social commentary.

<text>William George Wyman (né Perks; born 24 October 1936) is an English musician who was the bass guitarist with the rock band the Rolling Stones from 1962 to 1993. Wyman was part of the band&#x27;s first stable lineup and performed on their first 19 albums. Since 1997, he has performed as the vocalist and bass guitarist for Bill Wyman&#x27;s Rhythm Kings. He was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Rolling Stones in 1989. Wyman briefly returned to recording with the Rolling Stones in 2023.

==Early life==
Wyman was born as William George Perks in Lewisham Hospital in Lewisham, South London, the son of bricklayer William George Perks and Kathleen May &quot;Molly&quot; Perks (née Jeffery). One of six children, he spent most of his early life in Penge, Southeast London. Wyman described his wartime childhood as &quot;scarred by poverty&quot;, having survived The Blitz and enemy fighter plane strafing that killed neighbours.

Wyman attended Oakfield Primary School, passing his eleven plus exam to gain entry to Beckenham and Penge County Grammar School from 1947 to Easter 1953, leaving before the GCE exams after his father found him a job working for a bookmaker and insisted that he take it. 

In January 1955, Wyman was called up for two year national service in the Royal Air Force. In the autumn, after signing for an extra year, he was posted to Oldenburg Air Base in North Germany, where he spent the rest of his service in the Motor Transport Section. He heard the beginnings of rock and roll in dancehalls such as ″Zum Grünen Wald″ and, after purchasing a radio, also on American Forces Network. In August 1956, he bought a guitar for 400 Deutsche Mark and in 1957 formed a skiffle group on camp with Casey Jones.

==Music career==
Wyman took piano lessons from age 10 to 13. A year after his marriage on 24 October 1959 to Diane Cory, an 18-year-old bank clerk, he bought a Burns electric guitar for £52 () on hire-purchase, but was not satisfied by his progress. He switched to bass guitar after hearing one at a Barron Knights concert. He created a fretless electric bass guitar by removing the frets on a second hand UK-built Dallas Tuxedo bass and played this in a south London band, the Cliftons, in 1961.

He legally changed his surname to Wyman in August 1964, taking the phonetic surname of a friend, Lee Whyman, with whom he had done national service in the Royal Air Force from 1955 to 1957.

===The Rolling Stones and 1980s side projects===
When drummer Tony Chapman told him that a rhythm and blues band called the Rolling Stones needed a bass player, he auditioned at a pub in Chelsea on 7 December 1962 and was hired as a successor to Dick Taylor. The band were impressed by his instrument and amplifiers (one of which Wyman modified himself, and a Vox AC30). Wyman was the oldest member of the group.

In addition to playing bass, Wyman frequently provided backing vocals on early records, and through 1967, in concert as well. He wrote and sang lead on the track &quot;In Another Land&quot; from the album &quot;Their Satanic Majesties Request&quot;, which was released as a single and credited solely to Wyman, making it his first official solo single. The song is one of two Wyman compositions released by the Rolling Stones; the second is &quot;Downtown Suzie&quot; (sung by Mick Jagger), on &quot;Metamorphosis&quot;, a collection of Rolling Stones outtakes. The title &quot;Downtown Suzie&quot; was chosen by their erstwhile manager Allen Klein without consulting Wyman or the band. The original title was &quot;Sweet Lisle Lucy&quot;, named after Lisle Street, a street in the red light district in Soho, London.
Wyman was close to Brian Jones; they usually shared rooms while on tour and often went to clubs together. He and Jones spent time together even when Jones was distancing himself from the band. Wyman was distraught when he heard the news of Jones&#x27; death, being one of two members (Watts was the other) to attend Jones&#x27; funeral in July 1969. Wyman was also friends with guitarist Mick Taylor. Like the other Rolling Stones, he has worked with Taylor since the latter&#x27;s departure from the band in 1974.

Wyman has kept a journal throughout his life, beginning when he was a child, and used it in writing his 1990 autobiography &quot;Stone Alone&quot; and his 2002 book &quot;Rolling with the Stones&quot;. In &quot;Stone Alone&quot;, Wyman states that he composed the riff of &quot;Jumpin&#x27; Jack Flash&quot; with Brian Jones and drummer Charlie Watts. Wyman mentions that &quot;(I Can&#x27;t Get No) Satisfaction&quot; was released as a single only after a 3–2 vote within the band: Wyman, Watts and Jones voted for, Jagger and Keith Richards against, feeling it not sufficiently commercial.

Wyman also played on &quot;The London Howlin&#x27; Wolf Sessions&quot;, released 1971, with Howlin&#x27; Wolf, Eric Clapton, Charlie Watts and Stevie Winwood, and on the album &quot;Jamming with Edward&quot;, released in 1972, with Ry Cooder, Nicky Hopkins, Jagger and Watts. He played bass on at least two tracks of the 1967 album &quot;I Can Tell&quot; by John P. Hammond.

In July 1981, Wyman&#x27;s solo single &quot;(Si Si) Je Suis un Rock Star&quot; became a top-20 hit in many countries. Also in 1981, Wyman composed the soundtrack album &quot;Green Ice&quot; for the Ryan O&#x27;Neal/Omar Sharif film of the same name. In the mid-1980s, he composed music for two films by Italian director Dario Argento: &quot;Phenomena&quot; (1985) and &quot;Opera&quot; (1987).

In 1983, Wyman helped organize a fundraiser for Action Research into Multiple Sclerosis in the form of a concert tour with a group calling themselves Willie and the Poor Boys. The group played shows in the U.S. and the UK that included a rotating group of guest musicians, including Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, and Jimmy Page. The effort was inspired by Wyman&#x27;s friend and former Small Faces and Faces musician Ronnie Lane. The group produced an album of the same name that lists Wyman, Charlie Watts, Geraint Watkins, Mickey Gee, and Andy Fairweather Low as principal members, plus Ray Cooper, Jimmy Page, Willie Garnett, Chris Rea, Steve Gregory, Paul Rodgers, Kenney Jones, Henry Spinetti, and Terry Williams.

Wyman made a cameo appearance in the 1987 film &quot;Eat the Rich&quot;. He produced and played on a few albums of the group Tucky Buzzard.

After the Rolling Stones&#x27; 1989–90 Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle Tours, Wyman left the band in January 1993. The Rolling Stones have continued to record and tour with Darryl Jones on bass, but not as an official member of the band.

===Later activity===

Wyman formed the cross-generational Bill Wyman&#x27;s Rhythm Kings in 1997. The band featured a regularly rotating line-up of musicians and performed covers of blues, soul, rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, jazz, and occasional Rolling Stones songs. Wyman rarely performed vocals, but typically sang lead vocals on the Chuck Berry song &quot;You Never Can Tell&quot; and the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Honky Tonk Women&quot;.

Wyman was a judge for the 5th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists&#x27; careers.

On 25 October 2009, Wyman performed a reunion show with Faces, filling in for the late Ronnie Lane as he had previously done in 1986 and 1993.

On 19 April 2011, pianist Ben Waters released an Ian Stewart tribute album titled &quot;Boogie 4 Stu&quot;. Wyman played on two tracks: &quot;Rooming House Boogie&quot; and &quot;Watchin&#x27; the River Flow&quot;, the latter recorded with the Rolling Stones.

In 2012, Wyman and Mick Taylor were expected to join the Rolling Stones on stage at shows in London (25 and 29 November) and Newark (13 and 15 December), though Darryl Jones supplied the bass for the majority of the show. At the London shows on 25 and 29 November, Wyman played on two back-to-back songs, &quot;It&#x27;s Only Rock &#x27;n Roll&quot; and &quot;Honky Tonk Women&quot;. He later stated that he was not interested in joining the band for further tour dates in 2013.

Wyman participated in a 2019 documentary, directed and written by Oliver Murray, titled The Quiet One, about his life and career.

Wyman briefly returned to recording with the Rolling Stones in 2023, playing bass on one track, &quot;Live By the Sword&quot;, on their album &quot;Hackney Diamonds&quot;. It was the first time he had appeared on a Rolling Stones studio recording since 1991.

On 9 August 2024, Wyman released his ninth solo album entitled &quot;Drive My Car&quot;.

==Musical instruments==
Wyman&#x27;s bass sound came not only from his 30-inch short-scale fretless bass (the so-called &quot;homemade&quot; bass; actually a modified Dallas Tuxedo bass), but also from the &quot;walking bass&quot; style he adopted, inspired by Willie Dixon and Ricky Fenson. Wyman has played a number of basses, nearly all short scale, including a Framus Star bass and a number of other Framus basses, a Vox Teardrop bass (issued as a Bill Wyman signature model), a Fender Mustang Bass, two Ampeg Dan Armstrong basses, a Gibson EB-3, and a Travis Bean bass. Since the late 1980s, Wyman has primarily played Steinberger basses. In 2011, The Bass Centre in London issued the Wyman Bass, a fretted interpretation of Wyman&#x27;s first &quot;homemade&quot; fretless bass, played and endorsed by Wyman. One of Wyman&#x27;s basses, his 1969 Fender Mustang Bass, sold at auction for $380,000 in 2020, at the time the highest price ever for a bass.

==Personal life==

Wyman, although moderate in his use of alcohol and drugs, has stated that he became &quot;girl mad&quot; as a psychological crutch.

Wyman married his first wife, Diane Cory, in 1959 and their son Stephen Paul Wyman was born on 29 March 1962. They separated in 1967 and divorced in 1969.

In his autobiography &quot;Stone Alone&quot;, Wyman recalls he and the rest of the band becoming acquainted with a group of women in Adelaide, Australia on 11 February 1965 during their Far East Tour. Wyman had a brief relationship with one of the women and upon returning the next year on 22 February 1966 during the band&#x27;s Australasian Tour found her to be absent. When inquiring about her whereabouts to one of her friends he was informed that the woman had become pregnant from their encounter and chose to move to New Zealand where she gave birth to a girl who she decided to raise on her own, as she did not wish to cause problems for him. Wyman was told that both were living happily and the mother did not contact him when the Stones visited New Zealand a week later. As of the writing of the book (1990), Wyman had not heard from either mother or daughter.

On 2 June 1989, aged 52, Wyman married 18-year-old Mandy Smith, whom he had &quot;fallen in love with&quot; when she was 13 and, according to Smith, had a sexual relationship with when she was 14. The couple separated two years later and finalised their divorce two years after that. In April 1993 Wyman married model Suzanne Accosta, whom he first met in 1980; the two had remained friends until their romance developed. The couple has three daughters.

In 1993, Wyman&#x27;s son Stephen Wyman married Patsy Smith, the 46-year-old mother of Bill&#x27;s ex-wife Mandy Smith. Stephen was 30 years old at the time. Consequently, the ex-Rolling Stone became his own son&#x27;s ex-son-in-law, the father-in-law of his ex-mother-in-law, as well as the stepgrandfather of his ex-wife.

In 1968, Wyman bought Gedding Hall as his country home near Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk; it dates back to 1458. Wyman also lives in St Paul de Vence in the South of France where his friends include numerous artists. He is a keen cricket enthusiast and admired Denis Compton and played in a celebrity match at the Oval against a former England XI, taking a hat-trick. He is a lifelong Crystal Palace F.C. fan, attending his first match as a birthday treat with father William. On a 1990 European tour with the Rolling Stones, he feigned a toothache and said he needed to travel back to London to see a dentist when in fact he went to watch Palace at Wembley in the 1990 FA Cup Final. It was around this period of the Stones&#x27; &quot;Steel Wheels&quot; tour he developed his fear of flying.
Wyman started selling metal detectors in 2007. Treasure-detecting adventures in the British Isles are detailed in his 2005 illustrated book, &quot;Treasure Islands&quot;, co-written with Richard Havers.

In 2009, Wyman gave up smoking after 55 years.

Wyman is a photographer who has taken photographs throughout his career, and in June 2010 he launched a retrospective of his work in an exhibition in St Paul de Vence. The exhibition included images of his musical and artistic acquaintances from the South of France including Marc Chagall. In 2013, the Rook &amp; Raven Gallery in London hosted an exhibition of a selection of Wyman&#x27;s images which had been reworked by artists including Gerald Scarfe.

In March 2016, Wyman was diagnosed with prostate cancer and was expected to make a full recovery.

<text>Sir Francis Hincks, (December 14, 1807 – August 18, 1885) was a Canadian businessman, politician, and British colonial administrator. An immigrant from Ireland, he was the Co-Premier of the Province of Canada (1851–1854), Governor of Barbados (1856–1862), Governor of British Guiana (1862–1869) and Canadian Minister of Finance (1869–1873).

== Early life ==
Born at Cork in Ireland, he was the ninth and youngest child of the Rev. Thomas Dix Hincks, a Presbyterian minister and scholar, and his wife Anne (née Boult). Two of his older brothers, Edward Hincks and William Hincks, followed their father&#x27;s footsteps as noted scholars and clergy. Francis was also intended for a career as a clergyman and was educated at the Royal Belfast Academical Institution. However, he found himself more interested in business, starting in Belfast, with commercial ties to the West Indies. It was at Belfast that he married his first wife. Two weeks after their marriage, they set sail for the Canadas.

== Business career==
Arriving in York, Upper Canada (now Toronto), Hincks set up a wholesale import business. He rented business premises from William Warren Baldwin and his son, Robert Baldwin. The Baldwins were a leading Reform family, opposed to the Tory Family Compact, which had run the government of the Province for many years. Hincks became friends with the Baldwin family, who were also of Irish descent.

He accepted a job as manager for the Farmer&#x27;s Joint Stock Bank but left to become manager of the newly formed Bank of the People after the management of the Farmers&#x27; Bank became dominated by Tories. When even moderate reformers were being persecuted following the Upper Canada Rebellion of 1837, Hincks considered moving to the United States. However, the appointment of Lord Durham in 1838 provided new hope and he chose to continue in Upper Canada. That year, he established &quot;The Examiner&quot; in Toronto, with the aim of promoting responsible government; this newspaper merged with &quot;The Globe&quot;, the predecessor of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, in 1855.

After resigning from cabinet and government affairs in 1873, he became President of the Montreal-based City Bank of Montreal. This bank merged with the Royal Canadian Bank to form the Consolidated Bank of Canada, and Hincks was its first President. His signature appears on banknotes issued by these institutions.

Hincks was elected to the Legislative Assembly of the 1st Parliament of the Province of Canada, sitting from 1841 to 1844, representing Oxford County. He was defeated in 1844, but elected in 1848 and subsequent elections, sitting from 1848 to 1855.

==== Bank notes and central bank ====
During his first term, Hincks was the chair of a select committee which studied a proposal from the Governor General, Lord Sydenham, who advocated that the government should take over the issuing of bank notes. Up to that time, paper notes were issued by the banks. Sydenham proposed that the government take over that function, with control over the amount of paper money in circulation, a forerunner of the idea of a central bank. Issuing the notes would also give the government an important source of income.

Although Hincks personally supported the proposal, it was defeated in the committee, largely because of opposition from the banks who would lose a major source of income.

==== Inspector general ====
In 1842, he was appointed inspector general of public accounts. In 1844, he became editor of a new newspaper in Montreal, the &quot;Pilot&quot;, which supported Reformers in both Canada East and Canada West. Because he sought subscriptions for his paper in Canada West, he came into conflict with George Brown, editor of the &quot;Globe&quot;. In 1848, he sold the paper and accepted the post of inspector general.

=== Co-Premier of Province of Canada ===
Hincks was Premier of the Province of Canada from 1851 to 1854. Hincks&#x27; vision of a railroad linking British North America led to the establishment of the Grand Trunk Railway in 1852 and he helped negotiate the Reciprocity Treaty of 1854 with the United States.

==== Decimal currency ====
During Hincks&#x27; time in office, currency reforms were a major issue in the British North American provinces. Although the British government wanted to keep all of its overseas possessions on the pound sterling, the North American provinces favoured a decimal currency, to facilitate trade with the United States. A compromise was reached in 1853 when the Canadian Parliament passed a &quot;Currency Act&quot;, allowing both pounds and American dollars to be used in the Province of Canada, at fixed exchange rates. New Brunswick passed similar legislation, the beginning of a common currency system in British North America.

==== Fall of government ====
A scandal developed in 1854 as a result of profits made by Hincks and Mayor John George Bowes of Toronto from the sale of railway stock. The government fell as a result, but when this matter was reviewed in the next parliament, no basis was found for allegations of corruption against Hincks.

=== Governorships in the Caribbean ===
In 1856, he accepted an appointment as governor of Barbados and the Windward Islands, and, in 1861, became governor of British Guiana. He was knighted in 1869, upon the completion of his term in British Guiana.

=== Minister of Finance===
On his return to Canada, he was elected to the House of Commons of Canada and became Minister of Finance from 1869 until 1874. Starting in 1870, he created the first government-issued fractional paper currency, popularly known as &quot;Shinplasters&quot;. This was intended to deal with the large amount of American silver coins entering the country, which were valued less than a Canadian dollar. While intended as a temporary solution, the shinplasters were popular, with subsequent issues in 1900 and 1923.

== Later life ==
In 1878, he represented the federal government on the Ontario-Manitoba boundary commission.

He was also an editor of the &quot;Toronto Express&quot; newspaper.

==Family ==

Hincks was married twice. In 1832, he married Martha Anne Stewart, in Belfast, Ireland. They remained married until her death in 1874 and had five children.

In 1875, he married Emily Louisa Delatre, widow of Judge Robert Baldwin Sullivan, another member of the extended Baldwin family. Lady Hincks died in Montreal, May 14, 1880, aged 69.

Sir Francis Hincks died in Montreal, August 18, 1885, of smallpox.

== Legacy ==
Hincks Township in Quebec, also called Hincksville, was named in his honour (but was officially renamed in 1975 to Lac-Sainte-Marie).

Hincks Street, Bridgetown, Barbados: In February 1861 H.R.H. Prince Alfred, the Duke of Edinburgh visited Barbados. In a bout of excess jubilation towards the visit, authorities promptly renamed several streets in and around the capital city of Bridgetown. Among the changes, one of the city&#x27;s oldest streets, Madeira Street was renamed to Hincks Street after Sir Francis, the then Governor of Barbados.

<text>Reinhard Alfred Furrer (25 November 1940 – 9 September 1995) was a German physicist and astronaut.

Furrer was born in Wörgl, Ostmark (now Austria). After the end of World War II, his father was expelled from Austria. The family found a new home in Kempten im Allgäu, Bavaria. Furrer stayed there until he joined the University of Kiel to study physics. He later transferred to the Free University of Berlin, where he received a diploma in 1969, and a doctorate in 1972. During his time as a student in Berlin, he was involved in the building of the &quot;Tunnel 57&quot; below the Berlin Wall, which was the escape route of 57 people from East Berlin to the West.

In 1974 he became assistant professor in Stuttgart and in 1979 qualified for full professorship. He spent time during 1980–1981 at the University of Chicago and during 1981 at the Argonne National Laboratory in Chicago, USA.

In 1977 Furrer applied for selection as an astronaut for the first Spacelab mission. He made it into the final round of candidates, although Ulf Merbold was finally selected. In 1982, the astronauts for the first German Spacelab mission were selected from the finalists for the first mission, and Furrer was one of the two chosen. He was a payload specialist on STS-61-A (D1), which was launched on 30 October 1985. The other payload specialists on the flight were Ernst Messerschmid and Wubbo Ockels (Netherlands).

Furrer wore the Sinn (watchmaker) model 140 S on his wrist during the STS-61-A mission in 1985

After his spaceflight he became a professor in 1987 as well as the Director of the Institute of Space Sciences at the Free University of Berlin.

Furrer was an avid pilot. He earned his pilot license in 1974, doing several long-distance trips with one engine planes - including a flight over the inland ice of Greenland in 1979 and a solo flight from Germany to Quito, Ecuador in 1981. His love for planes finally cost him his life, as he died in a plane crash after a flight show on the Johannisthal Air Field (Berlin). He was a passenger of pilot Gerd Kahdemann in a historic Bf 108 when the plane crashed shortly after 6:00 p.m. after performing a roll at low altitude. Both Kahdemann and Furrer were killed instantly.

== Checkpoint Charlie Museum ==
From the files of the GDR State Security Service:
Concerning FURRER it is known that, as a member of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft 13 August e.V. Association (supporting association of the Checkpoint Charlie Museum), he was a close personal friend of the chairman of the anti communism organisation and former head of the &quot;Action Group against Inhumanity&quot; Rainer Hildebrandt. Besides his usual code name &quot;Kurt Jacob&quot; he was also known under the aliases &quot;Reinhard&quot;, &quot;Jens&quot;, &quot;Heino&quot;, &quot;Nikolai&quot; and &quot;Bartmann&quot;... A permanent exhibition, dedicated to Furrer was opened in the Checkpoint Charlie Museum.

<text>In physics, a charged particle is a particle with an electric charge. For example, some elementary particles, like the electron or quarks are charged. Some composite particles like protons are charged particles. An ion, such as a molecule or atom with a surplus or deficit of electrons relative to protons are also charged particles.

A plasma is a collection of charged particles, atomic nuclei and separated electrons, but can also be a gas containing a significant proportion of charged particles.

Charged particles are labeled as either &quot; positive&quot; (+) or &quot;negative&quot; (-). The designations are arbitrary. Nothing is inherent to a positively charged particle that makes it &quot;positive&quot;, and the same goes for negatively charged particles.

== Examples ==
=== Positively charged particles ===
* protons
* positrons (antielectrons)
* positively charged pions
* alpha particles
* cations

=== Negatively charged particles ===
* electrons
* antiprotons
* muons
* tauons
* negative charged pions
* anions

=== Particles with zero charge ===
* neutrons
* photons
* neutrinos
* neutral pions
*z boson 
*higgs boson
*atoms

<doc id="352542" wikidata="Q3045750" url="?curid=352542" title="E. Remington and Sons">
<text>E. Remington and Sons (1816–1896) was a manufacturer of firearms and typewriters. Founded in 1816 by Eliphalet Remington in Ilion, New York, on March 1, 1873, it became known for manufacturing the first commercial typewriter.

==History==

===The rifle barrel===
There are two versions of the origin story of the first Remington rifle barrel. One holds that the younger Remington wanted to purchase a rifle and lacked the money to buy one, so he made his own. The other states that he forged a barrel from wrought iron to see if he could build a better rifle than he could buy. Both versions have him taking the barrel to a gunsmith to have it rifled.

Eliphalet II forged his first rifle barrel as a young blacksmith in 1816 and finished second place in a local shooting match with it. Despite not winning the match, he proceeded to make barrels to meet the growing demand for flintlock rifles in the Mohawk Valley. With the completion of the Erie Canal, connecting Buffalo with Albany, commerce in the Mohawk Valley expanded remarkably, as did the demand for rifle barrels.

To meet the increased demand for rifle barrels, in 1828 the Remingtons moved their forge and foundry from its rural setting to of land they had purchased astride the canal and abutting the Mohawk River near a town then called Morgan&#x27;s Landing (later Ilion), New York. The move coincided with the elder Eliphalet&#x27;s death, and Eliphalet II assumed control of the business.

===Becoming &quot;E. Remington &amp; Sons&quot;===
In 1839 Eliphalet was joined by his oldest son, Philo Remington (to make the business &quot;E. Remington &amp; Son&quot;); in 1845, his second son, Samuel, also joined the company, afterward called &quot;E. Remington &amp; Sons&quot;. Remington&#x27;s third son, Eliphalet III, would later join the company as well. During this period, the Remingtons specialized almost exclusively in manufacturing rifle barrels. These barrels, marked with the distinctive &quot;REMINGTON&quot; stamp near their breeches, were recognized for their quality and reasonable price. Many, if not most, of the independent gunsmiths in the Mohawk Valley purchased completed (but not rifled) barrels from Remington and assembled them into firearms custom ordered by their customers. As demand increased, the Remingtons added other parts to their inventory, first percussion locks made in Birmingham, England but marked with their stamp &quot;REMINGTON&quot;, and later sets of brass gun furniture, including trigger guards, butt plates, and patch boxes. After 1846, martial longarm and then revolver production dominated the company&#x27;s workforce.

In 1848, the company purchased gun-making machinery from the Ames Manufacturing Company of Chicopee, Massachusetts and took over a contract for Jenks breechloading percussion carbines for the U.S. Navy. Remington supplied the U.S. Navy with its first breech-loading rifle. Remington supplied the U.S. Army with rifles in the Mexican–American War (1846 to 1848). Shortly after, Remington took over a defaulted contract (by John Griffith of Cincinnati) for 5,000 U.S. Model 1841 Percussion Mississippi rifles. Based on the success of filling these orders, subsequent contracts followed in the 1850s.

In 1856 the company expanded to manufacturing agricultural implements. Upon Eliphalet&#x27;s death in 1861, his son, Philo, took over the firm during the Civil War and diversified the product line to include sewing machines (manufactured from 1870 to 1894) and typewriters (1873), both of which were exhibited at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876.

===Remington&#x27;s typewriter=== 

On June 23, 1868, a patent was granted to Christopher Sholes, Carlos Glidden, and Samuel W. Soule for a &quot;Type-Writer&quot; which was eventually developed into the Sholes and Glidden typewriter, the first device that allowed an operator to type substantially faster than a person could write by hand. The patent (U.S. 79,265) was sold for $12,000 to Densmore and Yost, who agreed with E. Remington and Sons (then famous as a manufacturer of sewing machines) to commercialize what was known as the Sholes and Glidden Type-Writer. Remington started production of their first typewriter on March 1, 1873, in Ilion, New York.
The Type-Writer introduced the QWERTY, designed by Sholes, and the success of the follow-up Remington No. 2 of 1878 – the first typewriter to include both upper and lower case letters via a shift key – led to the popularity of the QWERTY layout.

==Successor companies==

===Remington Arms===

E. Remington &amp; Sons supplied a large proportion of the small arms used by the United States government in the Civil War (1861 to 1865). On March 7, 1888, ownership of E. Remington &amp; Sons left possession of the Remington family and was sold to new owners Hartley and Graham of New York, New York, and the Winchester Repeating Arms Company of New Haven, Connecticut, at which time the name was formally changed to the Remington Arms Company.

Remington, in addition, was one of the most successful gun manufacturers in the world arms trade between 1867 and 1900, specifically through the export of the Remington Rolling Block action rifle. This single-shot, large-caliber black-powder cartridge rifle was exported in the millions all over the world, including shipments to France, Egypt, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Belgium, Argentina, Mexico, and the Papal States. It was a critical gun supplier of small arms used by the United States government in World War I (U.S. involvement 1917 to 1918) and World War II (U.S. involvement 1941 to 1945)

===Remington Typewriter Company===
In 1886, E. Remington and Sons sold its typewriter business to the Standard Typewriter Manufacturing Company, Inc. Included were the rights to use the Remington name. The buyers were William O. Wyckoff, Harry H. Benedict, and Clarence Seamans, all of whom worked for Remington.

Standard Typewriter changed its name in 1902 to Remington Typewriter Company. This company merged in 1927 with Rand Kardex Bureau to form Remington Rand, which continued to manufacture office equipment and later became a major computer company, as well as manufacturing electric razors.

<doc id="352544" wikidata="Q663750" url="?curid=352544" title="Jedi census phenomenon">
<text>In some national population censuses which include a question on religious identity, media report numerous respondents giving their religion as Jedi (or &quot;Jedi Knight&quot;) after the quasi-religious order in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; science fiction franchise. While a few individuals claim to practise Jediism sincerely, the answer can also be a joke or protest against the religion question. While giving false information on a census form is often illegal, any religion question is sometimes an exception; in any case, prosecutions are rare. The Jedi census phenomenon sprang from a 2001 urban legend spread by chain email prior to the separate censuses that year in New Zealand, Australia, and the United Kingdom. The email asserted that any religion passing a minimum threshold (given variously as 8,000 or 10,000) would be entitled to some form of official recognition. Other reasons proffered include &quot;do it because you love Star Wars&quot; or &quot;just to annoy people&quot;. The 2001 censuses recorded Jedi as 1.5% of New Zealanders, 0.37% of Australians, and 0.8% of Britons. Later censuses there and elsewhere have recorded smaller proportions. In some cases any &quot;Jedi&quot; responses are collected under &quot;other&quot; rather than reported separately.

==Impact==
===Australia===
In Australia, more than 70,000 people (0.37%) declared themselves members of the Jedi order in the 2001 census. The Australian Bureau of Statistics issued an official press release in response to media interest on the subject. The ABS announced that any answers that were Jedi-related in the religion question were to be classified as &quot;not defined&quot; and stressed the social impact of making misleading or false statements on the census. An ABS spokesperson said that &quot;further analysis of census responses has been undertaken since the release of census data on 17 June to separately identify the number of Jedi-related responses&quot;.
It is believed that there is no numerical value that determines a religion per definition of the ABS, but there would need to be a belief system or philosophy as well as some form of institutional or organisational structure in place.

The push for Australians to declare themselves as members of the Jedi order was one of the first examples of a concept going &quot;viral&quot; on the internet in Australia. The website which was set up to promote the concept was visited over 100,000 times in a five-week period and was first archived by the Wayback Machine on 21 October 2001.

The 2006 census recorded 58,053 Jedi. In the 2011 census, the numbers listing their faith as Jedi had picked up from the 2006 census to 65,000. Close to 48,000 people reported themselves as Jedi for the 2016 census.

The Jedi Census phenomenon attracted the attention of sociologist of religion Adam Possamai who discusses it in his book &quot;Religion and Popular Culture: A Hyper-Real Testament&quot;. Possamai&#x27;s study placed Jediism in the context of a specific methodological classification (&#x27;hyper-real religions&#x27;) and attempted to demonstrate that hostility existed towards new religions in Australia.

In the lead-up to the 2006 census, there were reports that writing Jedi on the 2006 census could lead to a fine for providing &quot;false or misleading&quot; information. This is despite previous admissions by the ABS that they were &quot;fairly relaxed&quot; about the issue in 2001 and that nobody had been prosecuted in at least 15 years.

In the lead-up to the 2016 census, there was a push from atheists warning not to use Jedi, imploring that it could be counted as being religious. The Australian Bureau of Statistics did not publish the number of people claiming Jedi as their religion in its reports on the 2016 census.

===Canada===
In the 2001 census, 21,000 Canadians put down their religion as Jedi Knight. This fact was referenced by the prime minister&#x27;s office as a rationale for making the 40-page long census form voluntary. In the 2011 National Household Survey, the number fell to 9,000.

===Croatia===
In the 2011 census, 303 Croats put Jedi as their religion.

===Czech Republic===
The 2011 census preliminarily recorded 15,070 people answering the voluntary question on religion as belonging to the Jedi religion, described by the Czech Statistics Office as &quot;the moral values of the Jedi knights&quot;. The office noted that this is an international phenomenon. As the 2011 census form did not list religions, these having to be filled out, the total number of Jedi is not artificially boosted by those who were not aware of the phenomenon prior to filling out the census form. On the other hand, many people encouraged others in discussions and then media to fill the Jedi religion prior 2011 census (as a form of protest against range, overall cost and obligatory filling of the census), which is probably the cause. The highest number of Jedi were recorded to live in Prague.

In 2021 the number of people reported belonging to Jedi increased to over 21,000. (516 people reported being Sith)

===Ireland===
In a May 2012 review of the 2011 census, the Dáil Public Accounts Committee asked the Central Statistics Office about the reliability of self-reported answers, instancing people listing Jedi as their religion. The response was &quot;We could probably tell you the number of people who have declared themselves as such, but we don&#x27;t publish it&quot;. The 2016 census results list all religions receiving more than 30 responses, including 2,050 (0.085%) under &quot;Jedi Knight&quot;. As of the 2022 census, there are 1,800 Jedi knights, a decrease of 250 since the 2016 census results. 

===Montenegro===
In the 2011 census in Montenegro, a group of young men declared themselves as &quot;Jedi&quot; on the ethnicity question, as they believe that ethnicity should not be an issue today.

===New Zealand===
Over 53,000 people listed themselves as Jedi in New Zealand&#x27;s 2001 census. New Zealand had the highest per capita population of reported Jedi in the world that year, with 1.5% marking &quot;Jedi&quot; as their religion. Statistics New Zealand treated Jedi responses as &quot;Answer understood, but will not be counted&quot;.

There was a fall in the number of New Zealand Jedi five years later, with some 20,000 people giving this as their religion in the 2006 census.

The 2011 census was postposed to 2013 due to an earthquake in Christchurch and the number of Jedi in New Zealand fell to 19,089. In the 2018 census, the figure increased again, to 20,409 (0.43% total responses).

===Serbia===
In the 2011 census in Serbia, 640 people identified as Jedi.

===United Kingdom===
====England and Wales====
In England and Wales, 390,127 people (almost 0.8%) stated their religion as Jedi on their 2001 Census forms, surpassing Sikhism, Judaism, and Buddhism, and making it the fourth largest reported religion in the country. In the 2001 census, 2.6% of the population of Brighton claimed to be Jedi. The percentages of religious affiliations were:
* Christian: 70%
* No religion: 16%
* Chose not to respond: 7.8%
* Muslim: 3.1%
* Hindu: 2.1%
* Jedi: 0.7%

It was confirmed prior to the census that citizens were not liable for a fine in relation to question 10 (on religion). This was based on section 1(2) of the Census (Amendment) Act 2000, which amended section 8 of the Census Act 2000 to state that &quot;no person shall be liable to a penalty under subsection (1) for refusing or neglecting to state any particulars in respect of religion&quot;. The change in the law was implemented by The Census (Amendment) Order 2000 and The Census (Amendment) Regulations 2000.

Jedi Knight was assigned its own code in England and Wales for census processing, numbered 896. Officials from the Office for National Statistics pointed out that this merely means that it has been registered as a common answer to the &quot;religion&quot; question and that this does not confer on it the status of official recognition. John Pullinger, Director of Reporting and Analysis for the Census, noted that many people who would otherwise not have completed a Census form did so solely to record themselves as Jedi, so this joke helped to improve the quality of the Census. The Office for National Statistics revealed the total figure in a press release entitled &quot;390,000 Jedi there are&quot;.

In June 2005, Jamie Reed, newly elected Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for Copeland in Cumbria, declared himself to be the first Jedi Member of Parliament during his maiden speech. The statement, made in the context of an ongoing debate regarding the Incitement to Religious Hatred Bill, was confirmed by Reed&#x27;s office to be a joke instead of a serious statement of faith. During a subsequent committee debate on the bill, the Conservative Member of Parliament for Beaconsfield, Dominic Grieve, proposed as &quot;a bit of a joke&quot; to exclude Jedi Knights from the protection of the proposed act, along with Satanists and proponents of animal sacrifice, illustrating the difficulty of defining religious belief in legislation. Similarly, in April 2006, Edward Leigh, the Conservative Member of Parliament for Gainsborough, asked whether he would be allowed to set up a Jedi knights faith school during a Committee debate on the Education and Inspections Bill.

On 16 November 2006, two Jedi delivered a protest letter to UN officials in recognition of the International Day for Tolerance. The letter, written by Simon Cohen of the Global Tolerance public relations agency, requested that it be renamed the &quot;UN Interstellar Day of Tolerance&quot; and cited the 2001 Census showing 390,000 Jedi in England and Wales.

According to 2011 census figures, the number of Jedi had fallen to 176,632, placing it in seventh place, having been overtaken by Judaism and Buddhism, but still comfortably outnumbering any other alternative or mock religions. The magazine &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; also encouraged readers to mark &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; as their religion, leading to over 6,000 responses.

In 2021, Humanists UK asked nonreligious people not to protest the census religion question by writing in &quot;Jedi&quot; but rather to select &quot;no religion&quot; instead. The 2021 United Kingdom census recorded a dramatic decline in the number of Jedi Knights with fewer than 1,600 followers in England and Wales. The 2011 census recorded over 176,000 followers and the 2001 census recorded over 390,000 followers.

====Scotland====
In Scotland, 14,052 people stated that Jedi was their current religion (14,014 &quot;Jedi&quot;, 24 &quot;Jedi Order&quot; and 14 &quot;Sith&quot;) and 2,733 stated that it was their religion of upbringing (2,682 &quot;Jedi&quot;, 36 &quot;Jedi Order&quot; and 15 &quot;The Dark Side&quot;) in the 2001 census. The proportion of people stating their religion as Jedi in Scotland was lower than that in England and Wales, at 0.277%.

In April 2009, it became known that eight police officers serving with Scotland&#x27;s largest police force, Strathclyde, listed their official religion as Jedi in voluntary diversity forms. The details were obtained in a Freedom of Information request by &quot;Jane&#x27;s Police Review&quot;.

==Criticism==
The Atheist Foundation of Australia objects to non-religious individuals answering with any joke answer as this would lead to an underrepresentation of non-religious people in census data.

<text>WHAM (1180 kHz) is a commercial clear channel AM radio station in Rochester, New York, United States. It is owned by iHeartMedia and airs a news/talk radio format. The studios and offices are at Five Star Bank Plaza in downtown Rochester.

Its 50,000-watt non-directional transmitter, located in Chili, New York, operates the maximum power for commercial AM stations in the United States and Canada. During the day, it provides at least secondary coverage to all of Western New York, including Buffalo. It can also be heard in much of Southern Ontario, including Toronto, Peterborough, and Kingston. At night, WHAM can be received across much of the Eastern United States and Eastern Canada with a good radio. It is the Emergency Alert System&#x27;s primary entry point station for Western New York.

==Programming==
WHAM carries two local news blocks on weekdays: &quot;The WHAM Morning News&quot; and &quot;The WHAM 5 O&#x27;Clock NewsHour&quot;. The local talk show is Bob Lonsberry. The rest of the weekday schedule is nationally syndicated talk shows, mostly from co-owned Premiere Networks: &quot;The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show&quot;, Sean Hannity and &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; with George Noory. In addition, WHAM carries Mark Levin from Westwood One and Joe Pags, who is based at co-owned WOAI in San Antonio.

Weekend programming includes shows on money, health, home repair, cars, technology and law. Weekend hosts include Bill Cunningham and some brokered programming.

==History==
===University of Rochester===
The station first signed on the air on July 11, 1922. While not the first station to be licensed to the Rochester market (that distinction belongs to the defunct WHQ), it is the oldest surviving station in the area.

Industrialist George Eastman, the founder of the Rochester-based Eastman Kodak Company, helped the University of Rochester launch the station and thought the &quot;WHAM&quot; name would prove to be a clever marketing tool. Jim Barney helped the university get the station on the air.

===Stromberg-Carlson===
In 1927, WHAM was acquired by Stromberg-Carlson, a maker of radio and telecommunications equipment then based in Rochester. The company expanded the station&#x27;s operations and boosted its signal to 5,000 watts shortly after the acquisition.

It was relocated from 1080 to 1150 kHz in the overall national reorganization of the AM radio band by the Federal Radio Commission in 1928. In 1933, WHAM was allowed to increase power to 25,000 watts. A ceremony marking the event included a three-hour broadcast from the Eastman Theatre with &quot;a galaxy of stars&quot; participating. It later got a boost to its current 50,000 watt level.

In the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA), the AM band was shuffled in March 1941. WHAM changed frequency once more to its current 1180 kHz.

===Rochester Radio City===
In February 1948, WHAM and its FM sister station, WHFM (now WBZA), moved into a new facility, Rochester Radio City. The building included 24 offices and six studios, the largest of which could accommodate 400 people in the audience.

WHAM has ties to two of the city&#x27;s television stations. It put the city&#x27;s first station on the air, WHAM-TV, in 1949. That station is now WROC-TV, the area&#x27;s CBS affiliate. In 2005, the area&#x27;s ABC affiliate, WOKR, changed its call sign to WHAM-TV. Clear Channel Communications (now known as iHeartMedia), already the owner of WHAM radio, owned WOKR/WHAM-TV from 2002 until the sale of its entire television group to Newport Television (controlled by Providence Equity Partners) in 2007; the two stations still have a news partnership.

=== Controversy ===
WHAM radio host Bob Lonsberry has often been the source of controversy, due to his on-air remarks. He was fired from his show in 2003, but was later brought back due to boycotts by aggrieved fans.

News articles were circulated about him comparing a derogatory racial reference to the term &quot;Boomers&quot; - a colloquial reference for people born during the Baby Boom.

Lonsberry also hosts a show later in the day on co-owned WSYR (570 AM and 106.9 FM) in Syracuse and co-hosts a show on WHAM sister station WAIO.

<text>Sânnicolau Mare (; ; ; Banat Swabian: &quot;Sanniklos&quot;; ; Banat Bulgarian: &quot;Smikluš&quot;) is a town in Timiș County, Romania, and the westernmost in the country. Located in the Banat region, along the borders with Serbia and Hungary, it has a population of 10,627 as of 2021.

== Geography ==
Sânnicolau Mare is the westernmost town of Romania and Timiș County, being also the third largest town in the county after Timișoara and Lugoj. It is a border town, having a border with Hungary, on the unregularized course of the Mureș River. It covers an area of , 1.55% of the area of Timiș County. It borders Saravale to the east, Tomnatic to the south, Teremia Mare to the southwest, Dudeștii Vechi to the west. and Cenad to the northwest.

The town numbers 112 streets with a length of , arranged perpendicularly to each other. The length of the town is , and the width is . The houses are arranged according to the alignment of the streets and mostly with the length perpendicular to the axis of the street, being parallel to each other. It is divided into 106 rectangle- (70%), square- (20%) and multiform-shaped (10%) blocks and has nine neighborhoods, built along its historical stages:

* Bujak 
* Centru
* Capul Satului
* Comuna Germană
* Kindărești
* Primăverii
* Satul Nou
* Sighet
* Slatina

A note about the Romanian Bujak from Sânnicolau Mare and the Moldavian Budjak: The Budjak culture of the North-West Black Sea region is considered to be important in the context of the Pit-Grave or Yamnaya culture of the Pontic steppe, dating to 3,600–2,300 BC. In particular, Budjak may have given rise to the Balkan-Carpathian variant of Yamnaya culture.

In classical antiquity, Budjak was inhabited by Tyragetae, Bastarnae, Scythians, and Roxolani. In the 6th century BC, ancient Greek colonists established a colony at the mouths of the Dnister River, Tyras. Around 2nd century BC, a Celt tribe settled at Aliobrix (present day Cartal/Orlovka).

The Budjak area of the northern Lower Danube was described as the &quot;wasteland of the Getae&quot; by the ancient Greek geographer Strabo (1st century BC). In fact, based on recent archaeological research, in this period of time, the area was most likely populated by sedentary farmers; among them were the Dacians and the Daco-Romans.

=== Relief ===
The town lies in the low plain of the Aranca Canal. It is generally flat, only slightly fragmented, as a result of water erosion during the time when the Mureș River was able to overflow and uneven deposition of alluvial material.

The territory is located in the Mureș Plain, which is a typical form of fluvio-lacustrine subsidence, with shallow valleys with abandoned riverbeds resulting from the regularization of watercourses and drainage, with an altitude between . The northern part is located in the former meadow of Mureș, and the southern part in the former meadow of the old Aranca stream, today regularized and canalized.

On the territory of the town there are some elevations with southwest–northeast direction, which continue towards Saravale commune. The most important of these &quot;hunci&quot; (elevations) is located on the former border line between the town and the former commune of Sânnicolau German (now incorporated into the town), south of the Dudeștii Vechi–Tomnatic road, and is called Hunca Farchii. The most important natural resource is geothermal water, which is used in greenhouses, in hemp smelters and in heating homes.

=== Hydrography ===
The main collector of the Aranca Plain is the Aranca, which flows into the Tisa. The Aranca Canal is installed on the former riverbeds of the Mureș and has a divagation area before its damming. It springs from the Mureș meadow, from Felnac (where the Mureș dam begins) and flows into the Tisa.

The Aranca Canal crosses Sânnicolau Mare and in the past aimed to drain water from flooded lands, being widened and deepened in 1959 and 1960. On the territory of the town it has a length of and , a width ranging from and a depth of between . The maximum flow is recorded in spring, and the minimum flow in summer.

=== Climate ===
Due to its geographical position, Sânnicolau Mare falls within the conditions of temperate continental climate, with the predominance of maritime and continental air masses of eastern origin, to which are added the warm air masses that cross the Mediterranean and some polar cold air masses. Western circulation persists in both the cold and warm periods of the year and is characterized by mild winters with liquid precipitation. Polar circulation is determined by the cyclones in the North Atlantic and is characterized by temperature drops, heavy cloudiness and precipitation in the form of showers, and in winter the snow is accompanied by intense winds. Tropical circulation causes mild winters and significant amounts of precipitation, and in summer an unstable weather with showers and electric discharges.

The average annual temperature is . The average seasonal temperatures are as follows: in spring (April), in summer (July), in autumn (October) and in winter (January). Average monthly temperatures below are recorded only in January () and February (). The average annual thermal amplitude is (i.e., the temperature difference between January (–1.4 °C) and July (21.9 °C)). The number of frost days is 46–49/year, and the first frost is recorded in mid-October, and the last in mid-April. The number of winter days (maximum temperature &lt; 0 °C) is low due to the influence of warm and humid maritime air. Most winter days are recorded in January. The number of tropical days (maximum temperature &gt; ) exceeds 35, being characteristic of July and August.

The average annual rainfall is . During the year, the heaviest rainfall is in June (), and the lowest is in February (). By season, the rainfall is distributed as follows: in spring , in summer , in autumn and in winter . Winter is usually poorer in snow, with the soil being covered in snow for an average of 30 days/year, of which 15 days are in January.

The prevailing winds are from the west and northwest, which bring rainfall in the form of showers and those from the southeast, which are dry. In June, the northwest winds dominate, which have a share of 25% of the total winds; in September, the southeast winds dominate, with a share of 21.5%; and the south winds have the lowest frequency and blow especially in April and May.
=== Flora ===
Human activities have produced major changes in the physiognomy of the vegetation by expanding agricultural lands and reducing natural vegetation. In the Aranca Plain there are elements of flora similar to those of the entire Western Plain. In the riverside of the Aranca Canal there are agricultural lands, but also mesophile meadows: bent (&quot;Agrostis capillaris&quot;), meadow foxtail (&quot;Alopecurus pratensis&quot;), meadow-grass (&quot;Poa pratensis&quot;), meadow fescue (&quot;Festuca pratensis&quot;), red clover (&quot;Trifolium pratense&quot;), spotted medick (&quot;Medicago arabica&quot;), and among the trees: white willow (&quot;Salix alba&quot;), black poplar (&quot;Populus nigra&quot;), etc. The border of the town can be classified as a type of vegetation in the steppe, forest-steppe and oak forest. In the steppe area, the grassy layer consists of violets (&quot;Viola odorata&quot;), two-leaved squills (&quot;Scilla bifolia&quot;) and snowdrops (&quot;Galanthus nivalis&quot;). The floristic structure of the forest-steppe includes pedunculate oak (&quot;Quercus robur&quot;), downy oak (&quot;Quercus pubescens&quot;) and silver poplar (&quot;Populus alba&quot;). Within the oak forest, species of field elm (&quot;Ulmus minor&quot;) and narrow-leaved ash (&quot;Fraxinus angustifolia&quot;) appear in addition to oak.

In Sânnicolau Mare, between 1970 and 1981, there were rose plantations of over 20,000 species, the town becoming symbolically the &quot;town or roses&quot;. The most cultivated species of roses were &quot;Rosa cymosa&quot;, &quot;Rosa multiflora&quot;, &quot;Rosa × alba&quot;, &quot;Rosa × centifolia&quot; and &quot;Rosa × damascena&quot;. To these species of roses are added snapdragon (&quot;Antirrhinum majus&quot;), daisy (&quot;Bellis perennis&quot;), as well as other species that have adapted very well to the climatic conditions of the town.

=== Fauna ===
The fauna is of Central European type with sub-Mediterranean elements, with penetrations and a mixture of species coming from the north, south and west of the country. The fauna of the steppe and forest-steppe is characterized by the presence of rodents such as ground squirrel, hamster, hare, and among the birds: turtle dove, nightingale, quail, grey partridge, etc. In the Aranca meadow and in the swamps around the town live numerous species of mallards, geese, herons, glossy ibises, fire-bellied toads and otters. The forest fauna is represented by roe deer, red fox, hare and squirrel, and among the birds are the same present in the steppe and forest-steppe. The fish fauna present in the Aranca Canal and in Mureș includes wels, carp, pike, Prussian carp, weatherfish and bleak.

== History ==
=== Antiquity ===

The oldest inhabitants of this land would have been the Agathyrsi, named after Agathyrsus, a son of Heracles. Herodotus wrote that in 513 BC next to the Maris (Mureș) river lived the Agathyrsi who were of Thracian origin, engaging in cultivation of the land and even winemaking. The Agathyrsi have over time merged with the Dacians. At that time, the hearth of the town was made up partly of swampy lands fed by the overflow of Mureș and Aranca rivers.

In 106 AD, Roman emperor Trajan conquers Dacia and transforms it into a Roman province. In the time of Trajan, the Banat of Temes was called Dacia Riparia or Ripensis, because it was surrounded by the waters of the Tisa and Mureș. He began to populate it with Roman colonies, consolidating several fortresses and earth walls. On the left bank of the Mureș, Trajan set up a Roman colony and several cohorts of &quot;Legio XIII Gemina&quot;, who built here a castrum and a town called Morisena. It got its name from the Mureș and from the Dacian tribe Morasian, which had its residence here before the arrival of the Romans. Morisena would have covered the entire territory from Cenad to Sânnicolau Mare, being located between the Mureș and Aranca rivers – which at that time was navigable. Even if Morisena did not lie on the hearth of the town, there are enough scientific and military reasons to believe that in this place there was a castrum of &quot;Legio XIII Gemina&quot; erected as an outpost for the defense of Morisena. Between 106 and 274 AD Morisena becomes a town under the Roman Empire. In 274 AD, emperor Aurelian withdrew his legions south of the Danube, leaving Trajan&#x27;s Dacia in the hands of the Goths.

Between 380 and 396 the Huns, invading Dacia under Attila, drove the Goths south of the Danube, occupying Dacia, which they named Hunia, Morisena becoming the capital of the Hun Empire, Attila&#x27;s residence. Morisena was located on a very large area, including Cenad and Sânnicolau Mare, which appear together on the map of Europe in the 5th century. The natives were spared and even respected by the Huns, living with them in harmony. Attila in his battles in the Balkan Peninsula brings Roman slaves and settles them in Dacia, strengthening the Roman element. Byzantine rhetorician Priscus, sent by emperor Theodosius II, described Attila as having royal authority, dressed simply and very religiously, and learning beautiful things from the Dacians, Hun, Latin and Roman being spoken at his court. From those times are preserved the earth elevations on the border of the town called &quot;hunci&quot;, which were used as fortifications, observation points and tombs. The legends of the time say that Attila was buried on the territory of the town, in one night, in three coffins of gold, silver and iron, together with his weapons and jewelry, on the bed of the Aranca, which was then diverted.

In 453, after Attila&#x27;s death, the Huns were driven to the Black Sea by the Gepids, a Germanic people related to the Goths. In 566, the Gepids leave Dacia, leaving it to the Avars, a people of Tatar origin. Their khagan Bayan had his residence in Morisena, occupying this territory until 676, when Dacia was called Avaria. From the 5th century onwards, the Slavs followed in the footsteps of the Huns, and in the 7th–8th centuries they crossed the Danube during the fighting between the Byzantines and the Persians, occupied the Balkan Peninsula and formed today&#x27;s Slavic peoples: Bulgarians and Serbs. Compared to the Goths, Huns, Gepids and Avars, who left without leaving too much influence, the Slavs left a strong influence in this area through Slavic toponyms and geographical names.

It is believed by some that after the Aurelian Retreat of 275 the local Daco-Roman population of the former province of Dacia began organizing itself into local administrative units yet relevant polities likely only emerged after the collapse of the Avar Khaganate around 800 AD. According to the late twelfth century &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot; the area of Banat was ruled by a &quot;duke&quot; called Glad at the time of the Hungarian settlement of Pannonia in 896 who ruled from Cuvin and was contemporary with &quot;dukes&quot; Gelu of Dăbâca (?) and Menumorut of Biharia. Following the war between the Hungarians and Duke Glad, the latter demands peace and keeps his principality as a vassal to the Hungarian prince Árpád.

The hagiography &quot;Long Life of Saint Gerard&quot;, originally written in 1046, mentions a certain ruler called Ahtum who was governing the area of Banat at the time when King Stephen I of Hungary attacked it in 1002 from a stronghold called Urbis Morisena (literally &quot;City on the Mureș River&quot;). In the early eleventh century King Stephen I subdued lands in Transylvania, including the domain of Ahtum, who according to some estimates only held out for a few months, yet according to others as late as 1025 or even 1030, when he was defeated through the betrayal of Chanadinus, a relative of Ahtum. The fortress of Morisena was made by King Stephen I the supreme seat of the newly acquired lands, yet it was quickly rivaled by the newly established town of Cenad. Ahtum is called Ajtony in the Hungarian chronicle &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot; and his ethnicity is disputed (he may have been Hungarian, Kabar, Pecheneg or Romanian). Between this conquest and 1241 Morisena was under Hungarian rule. That year it was devastated by the Tatars, and after their departure, King Béla IV rebuilt the fortress on the hearth of &quot;San Nicolau&quot;. The name is said to have come from the monastery of St. Nicholas near the town, which also existed during the time of dukes Glad and Ahtum. The Kemenche Monastery, located 5 km north of the town, on the left bank of the Mureș River, in the point called Seliște, also dates from this period, with the role of strengthening the Mureș line, taking on the appearance of a fortress.

Sânnicolau Mare is known for the treasure of Nagyszentmiklós, a hoard of 23 gold objects discovered here in 1799 by a Serb farmer. The treasure dates from the 6th to the 10th century. No consensus has yet been reached on the origin of the treasure. The pieces of the treasure were manufactured at different times and by different masters. According to one theory, the treasure was made in the 8th century by the Avars. Another theory claimed that Bulgars made the utensil in the 9th century, and according to another study the Magyars of the Original Settlement made the treasure in the 10th century. The pieces are on display in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna and the National Historical Museum in Sofia.

=== Middle Ages ===
Sânnicolau Mare first appears in written history in 1247, when it is mentioned as &quot;Zent Miklous&quot;. It becomes an independent town and fortress on 17 December 1256, detaching itself from Cenad. Sânnicolau Mare is mentioned in the papal tithe records of 1332 as a property of the Catholic Diocese of Cenad, named &quot;Santus Michael&quot;.

Sometime between 1315 and 1331, King Charles Robert passed with his troops in the battles with Basarab I through this settlement. In 1394, Sultan Bayezid I devastated the land of Timiș, but was expelled. Some of the knightly armies of Burgundy, England and the German states passed through the town in 1396, heading for Nikopol, with peasant groups forming here in helping them in the battles against the Turks. The capital of Cenad came into the possession of the Hunyadi family on 8 August 1455, of which Sânnicolau Mare was part, and later in 1458 it came under the rule of Matthias Corvinus.

In 1481, Pál Kinizsi brought 50,000 Serbs from the Turkish-occupied territories to Banat, and some settled in the town. Between 1509 and 1511, the town was hit by a plague epidemic, and in 1514 the local serf peasants took part in the revolt led by György Dózsa, which was suppressed and their leader burned on the red throne. Banat with Timișoara and its localities, especially those along the Mureș, become the scene of battles between Hungarians and Turks. For the Kingdom of Hungary Banat had a defensive role, and for the Ottoman Empire it was the turning point of the system of many offensives.

The capital of Banat falls into the hands of the Turks on 30 June 1552 under Ahmed Ali Pasha, and in the same summer he conquers Sânnicolau Mare and Cenad, the first belonging to the Eyalet of Temeşvar, and the second to the Sanjak of Çanad. In 1594, some of the inhabitants, led by Vladeca Tudor and together with the army of the Ban of Karánsebes, put up resistance in the fortress of Nagybecskerek, but were defeated. In 1606, Banat passed permanently under Turkish occupation, during which time there was a Turkish barracks with a janissary school in the town aimed at defending the Mureș and Tisa rivers to the north and west. Ottoman rule changed in 1701 by the Habsburg one, fifteen years earlier than Timișoara.

By the Treaty of Passarowitz (1718), concluded between the Austrians and the Ottomans, the latter demanded the demolition of the fortress of Sânnicolau Mare, after an existence of 400 years. With the Treaty of Passarowitz, the whole of Banat came under Habsburg occupation, the first governor being the cavalry general Claude Florimond de Mercy, who represented the Viennese Court.

=== German colonization ===

In 1751, following the order issued by the Imperial Court in Vienna, Count Kempe proceeded to change and transform the military government into a civilian-provincial administration. In these new circumstances, Banat will be divided into 10 districts, including Cenad with Sânnicolau Mare. The first president of the civilian-provincial administration will be Count Perlas Rialph from 1751 to 1768.

Due to the military importance of Banat as a border province and the increase in revenues obtained from this province, the Habsburg authorities are taking a series of administrative, military and cultural measures through the &quot;Banat modernization plan&quot;. In order to implement this plan, the Imperial House of Vienna decided to colonize German population, which would contribute to a certain extent to the economic development of the province and the promotion of the Roman Catholic religion. Starting with 1752, the colonization of Swabian Germans begins, with over 145 families being brought here in three stages; they formed Sânnicolau Mare German (&quot;German Great St. Nicholas&quot;; ), with an area of 5–6 km2 and a population of over 1,500. The new settlement had straight and wide streets, on either side were ditches for draining water, and the secondary streets were perpendicular to the main streets. It had a small church, a school, a parish house and a town hall built around this time.

=== Modern history ===

The urban development of Sânnicolau Mare is closely linked to the of counts. The family history of the Nákós goes back to the Middle Ages. According to the documents, the family comes from the Greek market town of Dogriani in Macedonia. The first Nákós in Banat were brothers Christoph and Cyril Nákó. They bought most of the Sânnicolau Mare estate at an auction of animals and goods in 1781.

On 11 June 1787, Sânnicolau Mare received approval for the organization of an annual fair and, starting with 6 July 1837, for the organization of a weekly fair. Its value as a locality also materialized through the postal road that connected the diligences and stagecoaches between Timișoara–Budapest–Vienna (Sânnicolau Mare being a station for changing horses). In fact, in German documents from 1837, the name &quot;oppidum&quot; also appears, which means that the locality itself was the basis of a town. Due to a great fire in Nagybecskerek, the county seat, the headquarters of the prefecture of Torontál County was moved to Sânnicolau Mare between 1807 and 1820.

The revolutionary year 1848 was also felt in Sânnicolau Mare, many locals participating in the revolutionary battles, even constituting an area called Sânnicolau Mare Sârbesc (&quot;Serbian Great St. Nicholas&quot;; ) being included in the province of Serbian Voivodeship.

During 1850–1853, judicial activities began, the Nákó Castle was built in neoclassical style, as well as the Vălcani–Periam railway. Twenty years later, after the Mureș flood, the Aranca Canal is cleared and arranged. In 1883 the first hospital was established by a philanthropic gesture of Count Nákó.

Starting with the years 1867 of the Austro-Hungarian dualism, with all the difficulties encountered, the locality continued its economic, social and cultural development. Thus, between 1867 and 1918, there were dozens of workshops, manufactories, banks, bakeries, slaughterhouses, doctor&#x27;s offices and veterinary clinics, tanneries, cartwright&#x27;s workshops, woodworks, cattle shopkeepers, brickworks, vine growers, farms, as well as a brewery, a brick factory and a tile factory. There were also bookstores, weaving mills, pharmacies and a number of craftsmen such as mechanics, tailors, chimney sweepers, rope makers, watchmakers and locksmiths. The construction of Periam–Vălcani (1870), Sânnicolau Mare–Timișoara (1895), Sânnicolau Mare–Cenad–Makó (1905) and Sânnicolau Mare–Arad (1905) railways led to the emergence of other economic sectors, which gave the locality the status of a town and a zonal center. It had an area of 17,690 jugers (3,100 ha), one juger representing 0.57 ha, and the Zăbrani forest had an area of 550 jugers and stretched from Izlaz to Cenad, and the number of inhabitants was 11,358, with Romanians and Germans predominating, followed by Hungarians and Serbs.

Between 1910 and 1941, Sânnicolau Mare was a commune belonging to Torontál County, as well as a &quot;plasă&quot; seat. It became a town on 26 June 1942 through &quot;Law no. 495&quot; issued by Ion Antonescu which provided for the merger of Sânnicolau Mare and Sânnicolau German into one. Between 1951 and 1968, it was a &quot;raion&quot; seat, and since 1968 it has been a town of Timiș County, and in this period the town expanded territorially through the development of industrial areas in the north and south.

== Demographics ==


At the 2021 census, the town had a population of 10,627. With 12,312 inhabitants at the 2011 census, Sânnicolau Mare was the third largest town in Timiș County.

=== Ethnic composition ===
According to the 2011 census, most inhabitants are Romanians (73.7%), larger minorities being represented by Hungarians (7.23%), Roma (3.14%), Bulgarians (2.98%), Serbs (2.98%) and Germans (2.1%). For 7.46% of the population, ethnicity is unknown.

In Sânnicolau Mare the population is and has always been heterogeneous. 17 nationalities and probably others not included in the statistics have lived in the town over time. The record was set in 1977, when 15 nationalities were counted, even though three of them had only one representative. By 1750 there were already several families of Serbs and Germans here. The first accurate data come from 1880. In that year Germans had the largest share of the population (41.17%), with 1,782 Germans in Sânnicolau German compared to 2,805 Germans in Sânnicolau Mare. So a total of 4,462 Germans, followed by Romanians (31.28%), Serbs (11.39%), Hungarians (10.81%) and 3.35% other nationalities. Germans settled in Sânnicolau Mare in three waves: 1752, 1763–1765 and 1766–1773. Several Aromanian and Greek families also arrived from Macedonia, with 427 Greeks living here by the end of the 18th century.
=== Religious composition ===
According to the 2011 census, most inhabitants are Orthodox (63.13%), but there are also minorities of Roman Catholics (17.49%), Pentecostals (4.41%), Serbian Orthodox (2.53%), and Greek Catholics (2.01%). For 7.55% of the population, religious affiliation is unknown.

The religious composition is closely linked to the ethnic composition. Thus, in Sânnicolau Mare, almost all Romanians and Serbs have been Orthodox, almost all Germans, Hungarians, and Bulgarians have been Catholic. The first data on the religious composition of the population come from 1839. Then the Orthodox had the largest share with 57.97% (5,748 people), followed by Roman Catholics with 35.69% (3,569 people) and 6.34% of other religions: 308 Mosaics (Jews), 172 Reformed, 148 Evangelics (Lutherans).

== Culture ==
=== Music ===
Sânnicolau Mare is the birthplace of two famed musicians: composer Béla Bartók and violinist Károly Szénassy. The town is also noted for &quot;Doina&quot; choir, with a vast cultural activity in the area since the 19th century. Originally made up of 18 young serfs, the choir was founded in 1838 at the initiative of teacher Simion Andron. This choir began singing in two voices, in Church Slavonic and Greek, on Easter Day 1839 for the first time in the town. On its centenary, the &quot;Doina&quot; choir was decorated by &quot;Law no. 472/1958&quot; with the Second-class Work Order. Choir activity ceased in 2003.

=== Press, media and literature ===
Sânnicolau Mare is the birthplace of , the first woman journalist in Banat and Transylvania.

Between 1873 and 1890, under the editorship of Damian Petrovici, the specialized magazine &quot;Apicultorul&quot; appears, being the first of its kind in the country. The first local newspaper, &quot;Nagyszentmiklósi közlöny&quot;, issued in the Hungarian language by , appears in 1879. The newspaper resists until 1914, when it changes its title into &quot;Felső-Torontál/Torontalul de Sus&quot; and appears also in the Romanian language. The first German newspaper, &quot;Südungarische Volksblatt&quot;, appears in 1882 and is published by the first printing house in the town, belonging to Natahail Wienwier. Through professor Teodor Bucurescu, the weekly newspaper &quot;Primăvara&quot; appears in 1921, with 2,000 copies per week, through which it exposes the realities of the town and the aspirations of the locals, and from 1923 the &quot;Primăvara&quot; calendar is published. After 1990, an attempt was made to republish the newspaper &quot;Primăvara&quot; by the Town Hall, but, due to lack of funds, it was not published. Since 2000, only the Town Hall newsletter has been published in the town; magazines for internal use are also published at the Ioan Jebelean Theoretical High School (&quot;Necuvântul&quot;) and at the General School no. 1 (&quot;Lumea Noastră&quot;).

== Economy ==

The town&#x27;s economy has seen a trend reversal in recent years, due to its strategic position on the western border of the country, which has attracted a number of important investors. The largest companies are the American company Delphi Packard (electrical wiring for car components manufactured by international groups), with over 4,300 employees, and the Italian company (electrical resistors), with over 2,500 employees. Due to the high demand for labor, the industrial pole thus created provides jobs to the surrounding localities.

Sânnicolau Mare was declared in 2020 a tourist resort of local interest. Tourist attractions include the 19th-century Nákó Castle (housing the Cultural House and the Town Museum), the Serbian Orthodox church (1787), the Roman Catholic church (1824) with a crypt of the Nákó family, the Romanian Orthodox church (1903) and the Reformed church (1913).

== Transport ==
=== Road transport ===
Sânnicolau Mare is connected to the Romanian national road network by national road 6 and national road 59C, being also crossed by county road 59F, which provides a direct road connection with the Beba Veche border crossing point at .

=== Rail transport ===
Sânnicolau Mare is connected to the railway network of Compania Națională de Căi Ferate CFR by CFR 218 (Timișoara–Cenad) railway, which connects Timișoara with the west of Timiș County, at the border point with Hungary.

The town has two stations:
* the Main Station (), to the south, with loading and unloading ramps, being also a four-way railway junction;
* the Small Station (), to the north, a railway stop.

=== Public transport ===
The town does not have an organized urban transport, due to its concentric configuration, the public service providing only two buses for transporting people to the Main Station, upon arrival of passenger trains from Timișoara and Arad. Private operators provide passenger transport between Sânnicolau Mare and neighboring localities or other counties.

== Sports ==
Over time, the sports movement has had a tradition inclined to the existing branches of sports in each historical stage, depending on economic development and social conditions. With the colonization of Swabian Germans, sports activities diversified, taking place both locally and in the surrounding localities, in various sports existing at that time.

The emergence in 1860 of the Sokol movement in Czech lands has also an impact on the sports in Sânnicolau Mare, which materializes in 1924, when the Physical Education Society &quot;Falcons of Romania&quot; is created. The Falcons participated in the 9th All Sokol Rally in Prague in 1932, where they won a gold medal. The Falcons of Romania played a very important role in the physical education movement in the schools of Timiș-Torontal and Arad counties, and in Sânnicolau Mare the first sports hall was built in the yard of the Prince Carol Gymnasium (present-day Agricultural School Group).

In 1902, the first football team was created, called the Sânmiclăușana Sports Association, which carried out its activity on the field near the Small Station, and later on the field on Timișoara Street, where football matches were played with teams from the surrounding localities. The football activity resumed in 1953, when the town stadium was built with a capacity of 5,000 seats and a main grandstand, where the Unirea football team will evolve.

The town&#x27;s women&#x27;s volleyball team won the republican championship three years in a row between 1958 and 1960.

In order to carry out winter activities and indoor sports, the Sports Hall was built, which is intended for women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s handball matches, sports activities for students in general and high schools, gymnastics and football matches. The Sport Hotel and a sports hostel were built for the accommodation of the athletes. The Olympic-size pool of the public pool is used only for leisure activities and not for sports activities. In 2002, a kart circuit was built in the southwestern part of the town, where national and international competitions are held. The hippodrome was built in 1985 in the northeastern part of the town, on Țichindeal Street, with an obstacle course circuit, an arbitration grandstand, a grandstand with a capacity of 400 seats, stables, an administrative building and a park at the entrance.

<doc id="352551" wikidata="Q587996" url="?curid=352551" title="Cowes">
<text>Cowes () is an English seaport town and civil parish on the Isle of Wight. Cowes is located on the west bank of the estuary of the River Medina, facing the smaller town of East Cowes on the east bank. The two towns are linked by the Cowes Floating Bridge, a chain ferry.

Cowes has a population of 14,370 according to the 2021 Census.

Charles Godfrey Leland&#x27;s 19th-century verses describe the towns poetically as &quot;The two great Cowes that in loud thunder roar/This on the eastern, that the western shore&quot;.

Cowes has been seen as a home for international yacht racing since the founding of the Royal Yacht Squadron in 1815. It gives its name to the world&#x27;s oldest regular regatta, Cowes Week, which occurs annually in the first week of August. Later, powerboat races are held.

Much of the town&#x27;s architecture is still heavily influenced by the style of ornate building that Prince Albert popularised.

==History==
===Name===
The name &quot;Westcowe&quot; was attested in 1413 as the name of one of two sandbanks, on each side of the River Medina estuary, so-called after a supposed likeness to cows. The name was subsequently transferred to fortifications built during the reign of Henry VIII on the east and west banks of the river to dispel a French invasion, referred to as cow-forts or cowes. They subsequently gave their names to the towns of Cowes and East Cowes, replacing the earlier name of Shamblord.

The town&#x27;s name has been subject to dispute in the past, sometimes being called Cowes, and then West Cowes. For example, a milestone from the 17th century exists, calling the town Cowes, but up until the late 19th Century the Urban District Council bore the name West Cowes. In 1895 West Cowes Urban District Council applied for permission to change the name of the town to Cowes officially, and this was granted on 21 August 1895.

Whilst the name Cowes has become well established on infrastructure related to the town (including maps, road signage and postal addresses), the name &quot;West Cowes&quot; remained on Admiralty charts, used by sailors, until 2015, when it was corrected following a letter from a Cowes resident.

Red Funnel, the Southampton-based ferry company that provides routes from Southampton to both Cowes and East Cowes, has continued to use the name &quot;West Cowes&quot; for the town in information and publicity and as the name for the town&#x27;s terminal.

===Early history===
In earlier centuries the two settlements were much smaller and known as East and West &quot;Shamblord&quot; or &quot;Shamelhorde&quot;, the East being the more significant settlement.

The Isle of Wight was a target of attempted French invasions, and there were notable incursions. Henrician castles were built in both settlements in the sixteenth century. The west fort in Cowes still survives to this day, albeit without the original Tudor towers, as Cowes Castle. The fort built in East Cowes is believed to have been similar but was abandoned and since destroyed.

The seaport at Cowes was the first stop on English soil before crossing the Atlantic Ocean with many ships loaded with German and Swiss passengers leaving from Rotterdam and going to the New World destination of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. These passengers were going to become British subjects in Colonial America, and the English captains made a written record of the stop in Cowes.

===Royal patronage creates a yachting centre===
It is believed that the building of an 80-ton, 60-man vessel called &quot;Rat o&#x27; Wight&quot; on the banks of the river Medina in 1589 for the use of Queen Elizabeth I sowed the seed for Cowes to grow into a world-renowned centre of boatbuilding. However, seafaring for recreation and sport remained the exception rather than the rule until much later. It was not until the reign of keen sailor George IV that the stage was set for the heyday of Cowes as &#x27;The Yachting Capital of the World.&#x27; In 1826 the Royal Yacht Squadron organised a three-day regatta for the first time and the next year the king signified his approval of the event by presenting a cup to mark the occasion. This became known as Cowes Regatta and it soon grew into a four-day event that always ended with a fireworks display.

The opium clippers &quot;Nina&quot; (1852), &quot;Eamont&quot; (1853) and &quot;Wild Dayrell&quot; (1854) were built in Cowes.

===Great houses===

In Cowes the 18th-century house of Westbourne was home to a collector of customs whose son, born there in 1795, lived to become Dr Thomas Arnold, headmaster of Rugby School.

Northwood House was the home of the Ward family. It was donated under trust to the town in 1929, the grounds becoming Northwood Park. William George Ward was a close friend of the poet Tennyson and in whose memory the poet wrote six lines.

Cowes and East Cowes became a single urban district in 1933.

===World War II and the Błyskawica===
During an air raid of World War II on 4/5 May 1942, the local defences had been fortuitously augmented by the Polish destroyer &quot;Błyskawica&quot; (itself built by J. Samuel White in East Cowes), which put up such a determined defence that, in 2002, the crew&#x27;s courage was honoured by a local commemoration lasting several days to mark the 60th anniversary of the event. In 2004 an area of Cowes was named Francki Place in honour of the ship&#x27;s commander. The Friends of the ORP Błyskawica Society is active in Cowes. There is a Błyskawica Memorial.

==Economy==
Industry in both Cowes and East Cowes has always centred on the building and design of marine craft and materials associated with boat-making, including the early flying boats, and sail-making. It is the place where the first hovercraft was tested.

Major present-day employers include BAE Systems Integrated System Technologies (Insyte), which occupies the site of the old Somerton Aerodrome at Newport Road, Cowes; and GKN Aerospace in East Cowes.

The population of the town increases dramatically during Cowes Week, the busiest time of the year for local businesses. The town was reported to be doing well in 2009, despite the economic downturn.

The high street is where most of the retail shops in the town are located. These include specialist sailing shops catering for yachting enthusiasts, a small bookshop, hardware and homeware stores, an indoor plant shop and many more independent shops and businesses. There are a number of cafes and restaurants, including a coffee shop called PO41, despite the post code for Cowes being PO31.

==Sport and leisure==

Cowes has a Non-League football club Cowes Sports F.C., which plays at Westwood Park.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC South and ITV Meridian. Television signals are received from the Rowridge TV transmitter. 

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Solent on 96.1 FM, Heart South on 97.5 FM, Capital South on 103.2 FM, Easy Radio South Coast on 107.4 FM, Nation Radio South Coast on 106.0 FM, Greatest Hits Radio South on 105.2 FM and Isle of Wright based community stations: Vectis Radio on 104.6 FM and Isle of Wight Radio on 102.0 FM. 

The town is served by these local newspapers, &quot;Isle of Wight County Press&quot;, &quot;Isle of Wight Observer&quot; and &quot;Island Echo&quot;.

Cowes is a gateway town for the Isle of Wight. Travellers to Southampton are served by a high speed catamaran passenger ferry from Cowes known as the Red Jet. Southern Vectis&#x27; route 1 is the main bus service in Cowes. Single decker buses branded Red1 serve the Red Jet terminal, whilst route 1 double deckers serve the M&amp;S Foodhall at Carvel Lane (the site of the former Cowes railway station). Both run to Newport to take travellers on to other island destinations. Wightbus also ran local services around Cowes and Gurnard until 2011. The Cowes Floating Bridge connects the two towns of West Cowes and East Cowes throughout the day. It is one of a few remaining chain ferries not replaced by a physical bridge.

Cowes is the start of the Isle of Wight Coastal Path.

Cowes was once served by a rail link to and from the island&#x27;s capital Newport but as part of cutbacks made on the recommendation of Dr Beeching in the 1960s the line to Newport was cut in 1966. The trackbed south of Arctic Road is now maintained as a cycle path.

===Park and ride===
Cowes Park and Ride is a park and ride scheme on the Isle of Wight, featuring an 85-space car park and bus stop on the outskirts of Cowes in Somerton, on a former industrial site. It is currently served by Southern Vectis buses on route 1 every 10 minutes during the day. From the park and ride, a £2.50 return journey is available to Cowes Pontoon for the Red Jet boat to Southampton. This is one of the few return journeys Southern Vectis offer.

The park and ride scheme for Cowes was launched in 2004 as part of a joint venture between the Isle of Wight Council, Southern Vectis and Red Funnel. It was built on a former council depot on the Somerton Industrial Estate. The scheme went ahead largely due to losing a car park in Denmark Road for development, resulting in a lack of parking around Cowes. During the first few weeks of operation, before any Southern Vectis routes stopped at the park and ride, a temporary shuttle service was put in place, subsidised by Red Funnel, with a 15-minute frequency timed around morning and evening peaks.

To begin with, the scheme suffered with a huge lack in the number of people using the service, receiving no passengers in its first few days of operation.

Prior to the network revision by Southern Vectis in April 2006, the park and ride was served by routes 1, 2 and 3, with routes 2 and 3 running under the Route Rouge branding. All services to Cowes served the site, with buses using Three Gates Road to pass between the two current alternate routings, except route 1, which ran via the current park and ride branch but along Mill Hill road as opposed to Newport Road.

After the network revision, routes 2 and 3 no longer served Cowes leaving only route 1 at an increased frequency of every 15 minutes to serve the site, taking passengers right to the entrance of the Red Jet terminal. Due to the higher frequency, buses no longer serve Three Gates Road to cross over the routings, so buses on the Round House leg do not serve the site.

When the scheme was first launched, the price of a return ticket was £1, however, in April 2008, the price increased for the first time, doubling to £2 by Southern Vectis. This was due to a rise in costs and substantial cut in payments for free travel by the Isle of Wight Council. This later increased again on 2 February 2009 along with other £2 fares to £2.50 as part of Southern Vectis&#x27; annual fare review.

Later in 2008, there were some instances of vandalism at the site, with one woman&#x27;s car having its windows smashed after she left it in the site overnight. Police are working with the Isle of Wight Council to try to improve security at the site. The council have been told that members of the public are leaving their valuables inside cars at the site, which could be targeted by thieves.

The site was remodelled over the turn of 2009 and 2010. A new entrance was built directly off the roundabout, with a new bus stop and shelter, and a raised kerb. The previous entrance and exit was widened as an exit, and buses are now able to use the site without doing the large turn or being affected and forced to reverse by badly parked vehicles. The rearrangement also provides more spaces. A new bus shelter was due to be installed at the site on 24 November 2009, leading to the closure of the site to buses from 11am, with temporary bus stops on the main road outside, although this didn&#x27;t happen as planned. The site was closed at a later date for a longer period, with buses using stops on the main road for around a month. The newly remodelled site was completed on 22 January 2010, at which point buses started to enter the site again.

<doc id="352560" wikidata="Q269980" url="?curid=352560" title="Newry">
<text>Newry (; ) is a city in Northern Ireland, standing on the Clanrye river in counties Down and Armagh. It is near the border with the Republic of Ireland, on the main route between Belfast (34 miles/55 km away) and Dublin (67 miles/108 km away). The population was 27,913 in 2021.

Newry was founded in 1144 as a settlement around a Cistercian abbey. In the 16th century the English dissolved the abbey and built Bagenal&#x27;s Castle on the site. Newry grew as a market town and a garrison, and became a port in 1742 when the Newry Canal was opened, the first summit-level canal in Ireland. A cathedral city, it is the episcopal seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Dromore. In 2002, as part of the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II, Newry was granted city status along with Lisburn.

==Name==
The name Newry is an anglicization of &quot;An Iúraigh&quot;, an oblique form of &quot;An Iúrach&quot;, which means &quot;the grove of yew trees&quot;.

The modern Irish name for Newry is &quot;An tIúr&quot; (), which means &quot;the yew tree&quot;. &quot;An tIúr&quot; is a shortening of &quot;Iúr Cinn Trá&quot; (, &quot;yew tree at the head of the strand&quot;), which was formerly the most common Irish name for Newry. This relates to an apocryphal story that Saint Patrick planted a yew tree there in the 5th century.

The Irish name &quot;Cathair an Iúir&quot; (City of Newry) appears on some bilingual signs around the city.

==History==


There is evidence of continual human habitation in the area from early times. During the Bronze Age, the Newry area had a community who were making in abundance very detailed jewellery for garments. Three of these Newry Clasps can be found in the Ulster Museum, and a massive arm clasp from the same period was also found in Newry.

In AD 820, Vikings landed in the Newry area, &quot;from whence they proceeded to Armagh, taking it by storm, and plundering and desolating the country around&quot;.

===Early history===
A Cistercian abbey was founded at Newry in 1144; in 1157 it was granted a charter by Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn, king of Tír Eoghain and High King of Ireland. It might have been a Benedictine monastery before this. Newry Abbey (now the area around Newry Museum) would have been a sprawling complex of buildings and the heart of a monastic settlement. It existed for four centuries. The abbey was dissolved by the English in 1548, when it was recorded that it consisted of a church, steeple, college, chapter house, dormitory, a hall, a graveyard, two orchards and one garden. Modern archaeologists unearthed thirty-three burials from part of the former graveyard, and further bones were found in charnel pits. They included remains of men, women, and several youths, and some of the individuals suffered violent deaths. It is believed this was a graveyard for the lay community from when the abbey was still in existence.

In April 1552, Nicholas Bagenal, Marshal of the English army in Ireland, was granted ownership of the former abbey lands. He built a fortified house known as Bagenal&#x27;s Castle on the site of the abbey and its graveyard, re-using some of the abbey buildings. Bagenal also had an earthen rampart built around his Castle and the small town of Newry.

During the Irish Rebellion of 1641, Newry was captured by Irish Catholic rebels led by the Magennises and McCartans. In May 1642, a Scottish Covenanter army landed in Ulster and seized Newry from the rebels. James Turner, one of the Scottish officers, recounted that Catholic rebels and civilians were taken to the bridge over the Newry River and &quot;butchered to death ... some by shooting, some by hanging ... without any legal process&quot;. The Scottish general, Robert Monro, said that sixty townsmen and two priests were summarily executed. Turner also said that Scottish soldiers drowned and shot about a dozen Irishwomen before he stopped them killing more.

During the 1689 Raid on Newry, Williamite forces under Toby Purcell repulsed an attack by the Jacobites under the Marquis de Boisseleau. At the period of the Battle of the Boyne, the Duke of Berwick set fire to the parts of the town which he had restructured to defend it.

===Modern era===
By 1881 the population of Newry had reached 15,590.

During the Irish War of Independence there were several assassinations and ambushes in Newry. On 12 December 1920, British reinforcements travelling from Newry to Camlough were ambushed by the Irish Republican Army (IRA), who opened fire and threw grenades from MacNeill&#x27;s Egyptian Arch. Three IRA members were fatally wounded in the exchange of fire.

When Ireland was partitioned in 1921, Newry became part of Northern Ireland. From the 1920s to the 1960s, Newry Urban District Council was one of the few councils in Northern Ireland which had a majority of councillors from the Catholic/Irish nationalist community. The reason, according to Michael Farrell, was that this community formed such a large majority in the town, around 80% of the population, making it impossible to gerrymander. Also an oddity was that for a time it was controlled by the Irish Labour Party, after the left wing of the Northern Ireland Labour Party defected to them in the 1940s.

Newry saw several violent incidents during the conflict known as the Troubles, including a triple killing in 1971, a bombing in 1972, and a mortar attack in 1985. These continued into the late 1990s and even in 2010 – such as bomb scares and car bombs.

See also: The Troubles in Killeen, for information on incidents at the border and customs post at Newry on the border with the Republic of Ireland and close to Newry. In 2003, the British Army&#x27;s hilltop watchtowers overlooking Newry were taken down. The British Army withdrew from the area on 25 June 2007 when they closed their final base at Bessbrook.

==Geography==
Newry lies in the most south-eastern part of both Ulster and Northern Ireland. About half of the city (the west) lies in County Armagh and the other half (the east) in County Down. The Clanrye River, which runs through the city, forms the historic border between County Armagh and County Down.

The city sits in a valley, between the Mourne Mountains to the east and the Ring of Gullion to the south-west, both of which are designated Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The Cooley Mountains lie to the south east. The Clanrye River runs through the centre of town, parallel to the Newry Canal. The city also lies at the northernmost end of Carlingford Lough, where the canal enters the sea at Victoria Locks.

===Townlands===
Newry is within the civil parishes of Newry and Middle Killeavy. The parishes have long been divided into townlands, the names of which mainly come from the Irish language. The following is a list of townlands in Newry&#x27;s urban area, alongside their likely etymologies:

==Climate==
As with the rest of Northern Ireland, Newry has a temperate climate, with a narrow range of temperatures, regular windy conditions, and rainfall throughout the year.

==Economy==
Newry has traditionally been considered a merchant&#x27;s town, and has maintained a reputation as one of the best provincial shopping-towns in Northern Ireland, with the Buttercrane Centre and The Quays Newry attracting large numbers of shoppers from as far away as Cork.

In 2006 Newry house prices grew the most across the whole United Kingdom over the previous decade, as prices in the city had increased by 371% since 1996. The city itself has become markedly more prosperous in recent years. Unemployment has reduced from over 26% in 1991 to scarcely 2% in 2008.

Since the inception of the global financial crisis of 2008–2009, residents of the Republic of Ireland have increasingly been cross-border shopping to Newry to buy cheaper goods due to the difference in currency. The harsh budget in the Republic of Ireland in October 2008, and the growing strength of the euro against the pound sterling and VAT reductions in the United Kingdom, compared with increases in the Republic of Ireland, are among the reasons. This remarkable increase in cross-border trade has become so widespread that it has lent its name to a general phenomenon known as the Newry effect. In December 2008, &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Newry as &quot;the hottest shopping spot within the European Union&#x27;s open borders, a place where consumers armed with euros enjoy a currency discount averaging 30 percent or more&quot;.

However the increased flow of trade has led to resultant tailbacks, sometimes several miles long, on approach roads from the south. This has created huge traffic and parking problems in Newry and the surrounding area. It has also become a political issue, with some politicians in the Republic of Ireland claiming that such cross-border shopping is &quot;unpatriotic&quot;.

Newry is the global HQ of First Derivatives Plc.

==Governance==
===Local government===
The city of Newry is part of Newry, Mourne and Down District Council. The 2019 Newry, Mourne and Down District Council election resulted in 3 Sinn Féin, 2 SDLP and 1 Independent councillors being elected in the Newry electoral area, only change from the 2014 result was Kevin McAteer who went from SDLP to Independent in 2015 stood down in 2017 to be replaced by Michael Savage. Individually Roisín Mulgrew replaced her party colleague Liz Kimmens, while independent Davy Hyland was replaced by another independent, Gavin Malone.



===Northern Ireland assembly===

==Transport==

*The Newry Canal opened in 1742. It is the oldest Canal in Ireland or Britain and when functioning as an inland transport waterway, it ran for to Lough Neagh. In 1777, Newry was ranked the fourth largest port in Ireland. Some surviving 18th and 19th century warehouses still line the canal, and now many houses, shops and restaurants.
*In 1885 an electric tramway was opened between Newry and Bessbrook.
*MacNeill&#x27;s Egyptian Arch is a railway bridge located near Newry. It was selected for the design of the British one pound coin to represent Northern Ireland for 2006.
*Newry is served by an Ulsterbus bus station in the city centre. It is situated along The Mall, suspended over the Clanrye River. Services in Newry include local, regional and cross-border transport, with a free shuttle bus service to the local train station and services to local schools around Newry and Mourne.
*Newry railway station, just off the Camlough road, offers cross-border services on the Dublin-Belfast line as well as some regional services around areas of County Armagh and County Down. Transport to other places generally requires a change in either Belfast or Dublin. Planning permission for the construction of a new station to the east of the current station, was granted in May 2006 and the new station opened on 7 September 2009 by Northern Ireland Railways.
*Newry is on the main M1/A1 route from Dublin to Belfast. Originally the route passed through the town centre, but in the 60s was bypassed by the Abbey Link. This remained the sole relief road until 1996 when it was superseded by a single carriageway bypass round the western side of the town. By 2008 the road on either side of the town had been upgraded to motorway/high quality dual carriageway standard (southwards from Cloghogue) and low quality dual carriageway (northwards from Beechill). In July 2010 a new high quality dual carriageway with motorway characteristics was opened to bridge the gap, thus connecting Dublin with Belfast by motorway/dual carriageway for the first time. The opening of this section of road meant that motorists could travel from Clogh in County Antrim to Midleton, County Cork by dual carriageway/motorway. Part of this older bypass is still in use between the Camlough Road (A25) and the Belfast Road (A1). Newry suffers from very heavy traffic with shoppers coming from across the border. Newry is connected with Warrenpoint by a lower quality dual carriageway, some to the south.
*Newry is linked to Belfast via National Cycle Route 9, via Portadown, Lisburn and Craigavon. The route is planned to eventually extend to Dublin.

==Notable buildings==

Saint Patrick&#x27;s Church was built in 1578 on the instructions of Nicholas Bagenal, who was granted the monastery lands by Edward VI, and is considered to be the first Protestant church in Ireland.
The Cathedral of SS Patrick and Colman on Hill Street was built in 1829 at a cost of £8,000. The structure, which consists of local granite, was designed and built by Thomas Duff, arguably Newry&#x27;s greatest architect to date.

Incidentally, Thomas Duff also was the architect for the Cathedral in Dundalk, a town just over the border in County Louth, and it is said that he mixed up the plans for both cathedrals and sent Dundalk Cathedral to the builders in Newry, and Newry Cathedral to the builders in Dundalk.

Newry Town Hall is notable for being built over the River Clanrye which is the historic boundary between the counties of Armagh and Down.

The Craigmore Viaduct lies just north of the city on the Northern Ireland Railways Belfast-Dublin mainline. The bridge was designed by Sir John MacNeill with construction beginning in 1849. The bridge was formally opened in 1852. The viaduct consists of eighteen arches the highest being 126 feet, the highest viaduct in Ireland. It is around long and was constructed from local granite. The Enterprise train link from Belfast to Dublin crosses the bridge.

<text>or Geishū () was a province in the Chūgoku Region of western Honshū, comprising the western part of what is today Hiroshima Prefecture.

==History==
When Emperor Shōmu ordered two official temples for each province (one for male Buddhist priests and one for nuns), two temples were founded in Aki Province. The provincial temple was founded in present-day Saijō, Higashihiroshima.

In the late Heian Period (12th century), Aki Province became well known for the Itsukushima Shrine. Taira no Kiyomori realized the shrine&#x27;s importance and donated funds for a new complex of buildings and sutra scrolls. Itsukushima (Miyajima) had a good sea port and had clear strategic significance.

In the Sengoku Period, it was the original seat of the Mōri clan until 1600. In 1555, Mōri Motonari won the Battle of Itsukushima against Sue Harutaka and established his power in the western part of Honshū.

Mōri Terumoto, one of the Council of Five Elders Toyotomi Hideyoshi appointed for his son Hideyori, sided with Ishida Mitsunari before the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, and lost Aki and many of his other domains.

After a short rule by Fukushima Masanori, in 1619, Asano Nagaakira was appointed as the daimyō of Hiroshima Domain with 420,000 koku. Until the Meiji Restoration, the Asano governed almost all the province.

Aki Province was abolished in 1871, and renamed to Hiroshima Prefecture. After some mergers the current area of Hiroshima Prefecture was established.

==Shrines and temples==
&quot;Itsukushima jinja&quot; was the chief Shinto shrine (&quot;ichinomiya&quot;) of Aki.

<text>Sir John Douglas Cockcroft (27 May 1897 – 18 September 1967) was an English physicist who shared the 1951 Nobel Prize in Physics with Ernest Walton for their splitting of the atomic nucleus, which was instrumental in the development of nuclear power.

After service on the Western Front with the Royal Field Artillery during the Great War, Cockcroft studied electrical engineering at Manchester Municipal College of Technology whilst he was an apprentice at Metropolitan Vickers Trafford Park and was also a member of their research staff. He then won a scholarship to St. John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he sat the tripos exam in June 1924, becoming a wrangler. Ernest Rutherford accepted Cockcroft as a research student at the Cavendish Laboratory, and Cockcroft completed his doctorate under Rutherford&#x27;s supervision in 1928. With Walton and Mark Oliphant, he built what became known as a Cockcroft–Walton generator. Cockcroft and Walton used this to perform the first artificial disintegration of an atomic nucleus, a feat popularly known as &quot;splitting the atom&quot;.

During the Second World War Cockcroft became Assistant Director of Scientific Research in the Ministry of Supply, working on radar. He was also a member of the committee formed to handle issues arising from the Frisch–Peierls memorandum, which calculated that an atomic bomb could be technically feasible, and of the MAUD Committee which succeeded it. In 1940, as part of the Tizard Mission, he shared British technology with his counterparts in the United States. Later in the war, the fruits of the Tizard Mission came back to Britain in the form of the SCR-584 radar set and the proximity fuze, which were used to help defeat the V-1 flying bomb. In May 1944, he became director of the Montreal Laboratory, and oversaw the development of the ZEEP and NRX reactors, and the creation of the Chalk River Laboratories.

After the war Cockcroft became the director of the Atomic Energy Research Establishment (AERE) at Harwell, where the low-powered, graphite-moderated GLEEP became the first nuclear reactor to operate in western Europe when it was started on 15 August 1947. This was followed by the British Experimental Pile 0 (BEPO) in 1948. Harwell was involved in the design of the reactors and the chemical separation plant at Windscale. Under his direction it took part in frontier fusion research, including the ZETA program. His insistence that the chimney stacks of the Windscale reactors be fitted with filters was mocked as &quot;Cockcroft&#x27;s Folly&quot; until the core of one of the reactors ignited and released radionuclides during the Windscale fire of 1957.

From 1959 to 1967, he was the first Master of Churchill College, Cambridge. He was also chancellor of the Australian National University in Canberra from 1961 to 1965.

==Early years==
John Douglas Cockcroft, also known as &quot;Johnny W.&quot;, was born in Todmorden, West Riding of Yorkshire, England, on 27 May 1897, the eldest son of a mill owner, John Arthur Cockcroft, and his wife Annie Maude Fielden. He had four younger brothers; Eric, Philip, Keith and Lionel. His early education was at the Church of England school in Walsden from 1901 to 1908, at Todmorden Elementary School from 1908 to 1909, and at Todmorden Secondary School from 1909 to 1914, where he played football and cricket. Among the girls at the school was his future wife, Eunice Elizabeth Crabtree. In 1914, he won a County Major Scholarship, West Riding of Yorkshire, to the Victoria University of Manchester, where he studied mathematics.

The Great War broke out in August 1914. Cockcroft completed his first year at Manchester in June 1915. He joined the Officers&#x27; Training Corps there, but did not wish to become an officer. During the summer break he worked at a YMCA canteen at Kinmel Camp in Wales. He enlisted in the British Army on 24 November 1915. On 29 March 1916, he joined the 59th Training Brigade, Royal Field Artillery, where he was trained as a signaller. He was then posted to B Battery, 92nd Field Artillery Brigade, one of the units of the 20th (Light) Division, on the Western Front.

Cockcroft participated in the Advance to the Hindenburg Line and the Third Battle of Ypres. He applied for a commission, and was accepted. He was sent to Brighton in February 1918 to learn about gunnery, and in April 1918, to the Officer Candidate School in Weedon Bec in Northamptonshire, where he was trained as a field artillery officer. He was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Royal Field Artillery on 17 October 1918.

After the war ended, Cockcroft was released from the Army in January 1919. He elected not to return to the Victoria University of Manchester, but to study electrical engineering at Manchester Municipal College of Technology. Because he had completed a year at Victoria University of Manchester, he was allowed to skip the first year of the course. He received his BSc in June 1920. Miles Walker, the professor of electrical engineering there, persuaded him to take up an apprenticeship with Metropolitan Vickers. He obtained a 1851 Exhibition Scholarship from the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851, and submitted his MSc thesis on the &quot;Harmonic Analysis for Alternating Currents&quot; in June 1922.

Walker then suggested Cockcroft sit for a scholarship to St. John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, Walker&#x27;s alma mater. Cockcroft was successful, winning a £30 scholarship and a £20 bursary awarded to undergraduates of limited means. Metropolitan Vickers gave him £50 subject to his returning after completing his degree. Walker and an aunt made up the balance of the £316 fee. As a graduate of another university, he was allowed to skip the first year of the tripos. He sat the tripos exam in June 1924, achieved a B* as a wrangler, and was awarded his BA degree.

Cockcroft married Elizabeth Crabtree on 26 August 1925, in a ceremony at the Bridge Street United Methodist Church in Todmorden. They had six children. The first, a boy known as Timothy, died in infancy. They subsequently had four daughters, Joan Dorothea (Thea), Jocelyn, Elisabeth Fielden and Catherine Helena; and another son, Christopher Hugh John. 

==Nuclear research==

Ernest Rutherford accepted Cockcroft as a research student at the Cavendish Laboratory on the recommendation of Miles Walker and the director of research at Metropolitan Vickers. Cockcroft enrolled as a PhD student in 1924, with a Foundation Scholarship of St John&#x27;s College, and a State Scholarship. Under Rutherford&#x27;s supervision, he wrote his doctoral thesis &quot;On phenomena occurring in the condensation of molecular streams on surfaces&quot;, which was published in the &quot;Proceedings of the Royal Society&quot;. He was awarded his doctorate on 6 September 1925. During this time he was an assistant to the Russian physicist Peter Kapitza, who was working on the physics of magnetic fields in extremely low temperatures. Cockcroft helped with the design and construction of helium liquefiers.

In 1919, Rutherford had succeeded in disintegrating nitrogen atoms with alpha particles emitted from decaying radium atoms. This and subsequent experiments hinted at the structure of atomic nuclei. To explore it further, he needed an artificial means of creating particles with a velocity high enough to overcome the charge of the nucleus. This opened a new line of research at the Cavendish Laboratory. He assigned Cockcroft, Thomas Allibone and Ernest Walton to the problem. They built what became known as a Cockcroft–Walton accelerator. Mark Oliphant designed a proton source for them. A crucial moment came when Cockcroft read a paper by George Gamow on quantum tunnelling. Cockcroft realised that as a result of this phenomenon, the desired effect could be achieved with much lower voltages than first thought. In fact, he calculated that protons with energy of just 300,000 electronvolts would be able to penetrate a boron nucleus. Cockcroft and Walton worked on their accelerator for the next two years. Rutherford obtained a £1,000 grant from the University of Cambridge for them to buy a transformer and other equipment they needed.

Cockcroft was elected a Fellow of St. John&#x27;s College on 5 November 1928. He and Walton began operating their accelerator in March 1932, bombarding lithium and beryllium with high-energy protons. They expected to see gamma rays, which French scientists had reported, but none were found. In February 1932, James Chadwick demonstrated that what had been observed were actually neutrons. Cockcroft and Walton then switched to looking for alpha particles instead. On 14 April 1932, Walton bombarded a lithium target and noticed what he thought might be alpha particles. Cockcroft and then Rutherford were summoned, and confirmed that this was indeed the case. That evening, Cockcroft and Walton met at Rutherford&#x27;s home and produced a letter for &quot;Nature&quot; in which they announced their results, the first artificial disintegration of an atomic nucleus, which can be described thus:
: + → 2 + 17.2 MeV
This feat was popularly known as &quot;splitting the atom&quot;. For this accomplishment, Cockcroft and Walton were awarded the Hughes Medal in 1938, and the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1951. They went on to disintegrate carbon, nitrogen and oxygen using protons, deuterons and alpha particles. They demonstrated that they had produced radioactive isotopes, including carbon-11 and nitrogen-13.
In 1929, Cockcroft was appointed a Supervisor in Mechanical Sciences at St John&#x27;s College. He was appointed a Supervisor in Physics in 1931, and in 1933 became the junior bursar, making him responsible for the upkeep of the buildings, many of which were suffering from neglect. The college gatehouse had to be partly taken down in order to repair damage done by deathwatch beetles, and Cockcroft supervised rewiring of the electrics. In 1935, Rutherford appointed him the director of research at the Mond Laboratory after Kapitza, who had returned to the Soviet Union. He supervised the installation of new cryogenic equipment, and supervised low temperature research. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1936, and in 1939 was elected the Jacksonian Professor of Natural Philosophy, effective 1 October 1939.

Cockcroft and Walton were well aware of the limits of their accelerator. A much better design had been developed in the United States by Ernest Lawrence, which he called the cyclotron. The Cavendish Laboratory was able to keep ahead of the Americans despite having an inferior accelerator with clever physics, but Cockcroft pressed Rutherford to obtain a cyclotron for the Cavendish laboratory. Rutherford baulked at the price tag, but a £250,000 gift from Lord Austin enabled a cyclotron, based on Lawrence&#x27;s design, to be built, along with a new wing to house it. Cockcroft supervised the work. The cyclotron was in operation by October 1938, and the new wing was completed in 1940. Oliphant felt that the cyclotron was not big enough, and commenced construction of a larger 60-inch cyclotron at the University of Birmingham. Its construction was delayed by the outbreak of the Second World War in Europe in 1939, and it too would be obsolescent when it was completed after the war.

==Second World War==

At the outbreak of the Second World War, Cockcroft took up the post of Assistant Director of Scientific Research in the Ministry of Supply, working on radar. In 1938, Sir Henry Tizard showed Cockcroft Chain Home, the ring of coastal early warning radar stations built by the Royal Air Force (RAF) to detect and track aircraft. Now, he helped deploy scientists to help get the system fully operational. In 1940, he became part of the Advisory Council for Scientific Research and Technical Development. In April 1940, along he became a member of the Committee for the Scientific Study of Air Warfare formed to handle issues arising from the Frisch–Peierls memorandum, which calculated that an atomic bomb could be technically feasible. This committee was succeeded by the MAUD Committee, of which Cockcroft was also a member, in June 1940. This committee directed the ground-breaking early research in Britain.

In August 1940, Cockcroft travelled to the United States as part of the Tizard Mission. Because Britain had developed many new technologies but lacked the industrial capacity to fully exploit them, it was decided to share them with the United States, although that nation was not yet at war. The information provided by the Tizard Mission contained some of the greatest scientific advances made during the war. The shared technology included radar technologies, in particular the greatly improved cavity magnetron designed by Oliphant&#x27;s group at Birmingham, which the American historian James Phinney Baxter III described as &quot;the most valuable cargo ever brought to our shores&quot;, the design for the proximity fuze, details of Frank Whittle&#x27;s jet engine and the Frisch–Peierls memorandum describing the feasibility of an atomic bomb. Though these may be considered the most significant, many other items were also transported, including designs for rockets, superchargers, gunsights and submarine detection devices. He returned to Britain in December 1940.

Soon after his return, Cockcroft was appointed Chief Superintendent of the Air Defence Research Development Establishment (ADRDE) at Christchurch, Hampshire. His focus was on the use of radar for shooting down enemy aircraft. The GL Mk. III radar was developed as a target tracking and predicting radar, but by 1942 the SCR-584 radar developed for the same purpose in the United States became available, and Cockcroft recommended that it be acquired under Lend-Lease. On his own initiative, he acquired SCR-584 sets for testing, and trials conducted on the Isle of Sheppey in October 1943 conclusively demonstrated that SCR-584 was superior. This made Cockcroft very unpopular at the Ministry of Supply, but he had intelligence that the Germans were planning to deploy the V-1 flying bomb. On 1 January 1944, Lieutenant-General Sir Ronald Weeks sent Washington an urgent request for 134 SCR-584 sets.
The proximity fuze had been pioneered by Alan Butement. The idea was that if a shell could explode when it was near an enemy aircraft, a near miss would be nearly as effective as a direct hit. The technical problem was to miniaturise a radar set, and make it sturdy enough to be fired from a gun barrel. The second problem had been solved by the Germans; a dud German bomb was salvaged that had valves that could withstand the acceleration. Plans were given to the Americans by the Tizard Mission, but work continued in Britain, where a team was established at Christchurch under Charles Drummond Ellis in February 1942. Work proceeded fitfully, and by 1943, production was still two years away. On a visit to the United States in November 1943, Cockcroft discussed adapting the American proximity fuze for British use with Merle Tuve. As a result, 150,000 fuzes for QF 3.7-inch AA guns were ordered on 16 January 1944. The fuzes arrived in time to engage the V-1 flying bombs in August 1944, shooting down 97 per cent of them. For his services, he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in June 1944.

In August 1943, the Quebec Agreement subsumed the British Tube Alloys project into the Manhattan Project, and established the Combined Policy Committee to control the Manhattan Project. A final agreement was spelt out on 20 May 1944. Under it, the Americans would assist with the construction of a heavy water-moderated nuclear reactor in Canada, and would provide technical assistance with matters such as corrosion and the effects of radiation on materials. They would not provide details about plutonium chemistry or metallurgy, although irradiated uranium slugs were made available for the British to work it out for themselves. A sticking point was the director of the Montreal Laboratory, Hans von Halban, who was a poor administrator, did not work well with the Canadians, and was regarded as a security risk by the Americans. In April 1944 a Combined Policy Committee meeting at Washington agreed that Montreal Laboratory scientists who were not British subjects would leave, and Cockcroft would become the new director of the Montreal Laboratory in May 1944.
On 24 August 1944, the decision was taken to build a small reactor in order to test the Montreal Laboratory&#x27;s calculations relating to such matters as lattice dimensions, sheathing materials, and control rods, before proceeding with the full-scale NRX reactor. This was named ZEEP, for Zero Energy Experimental Pile. Building reactors in downtown Montreal was out of the question; the Canadians selected, and Groves approved, a site at Chalk River, Ontario, on the south bank of the Ottawa River some north west of Ottawa. The Chalk River Laboratories opened in 1944, and the Montreal Laboratory was closed in July 1946. ZEEP went critical on 5 September 1945, becoming the first operating nuclear reactor outside the United States. The larger NRX followed on 21 July 1947. With five times the neutron flux of any other reactor, it was the most powerful research reactor in the world. Originally designed in July 1944 with an output of 8 MW, the power was raised to 10 MW through design changes such as replacing uranium rods clad in stainless steel and cooled by heavy water with aluminium-clad rods cooled by light water.

Cockcroft was shocked when he was informed on 10 September 1945 that the British physicist Alan Nunn May, who worked at the Chalk River Laboratories, was a Soviet spy. In August 1947, Cockcroft was one of the scientists who signed a petition urging that Nunn May&#x27;s ten-year prison sentence be reduced, an act he later regretted.

==Post war==
In April 1945, Cockcroft and Oliphant scouted a site for a similar establishment in Britain, settling on RAF Harwell. Cockcroft was offered the directorship of the Atomic Energy Research Establishment (AERE) at Harwell on 9 November 1945. The official announcement was made on 29 January 1946, but the news leaked two months before the announcement, and before the Canadian government was informed, creating a diplomatic incident. It was agreed that Cockcroft would not depart until a successor was found, and he did not depart Chalk River for Harwell until 30 September 1946. In the meantime he recruited staff for the new laboratory. Klaus Fuchs from the Manhattan Project&#x27;s Los Alamos Laboratory became head of the Theoretical Physics; Robert Spence, Cockcroft&#x27;s deputy at Montreal Laboratory, became head of Chemistry; H.W.B. Skinner, of General Physics; Otto Frisch, of Nuclear Physics; and John Dunworth, of Reactor Physics. Fuchs was later arrested as a Soviet spy on 3 February 1950.

The low-powered, graphite-moderated GLEEP, which stood for Graphite Low Energy Experimental Pile, was designed by the Montreal Laboratory, and became the first nuclear reactor to operate in Western Europe when it was started on 15 August 1947. This was followed by BEPO, a 6 MW research reactor designed by AERE, on 3 July 1948. Because heavy water was unavailable in Britain, BEPO was designed and built as a graphite-moderated reactor. Harwell was involved in the design of reactors at Windscale, and the chemical separation plant there. The passage of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 (McMahon Act) in August 1946, made it clear that the UK would no longer be allowed access to the United States&#x27; atomic research. This partly resulted from the arrest for espionage of Alan Nunn May in February 1946. Cockcroft helped negotiate a new, more informal and unsigned agreement with the Americans that was announced on 7 January 1948, known as the &quot;Modus Vivendi&quot;. The renewed cooperation that he hoped for under the agreement proved illusory. The development of the independent British nuclear deterrent led to the Atomic Energy Act being amended in 1958, and to a resumption of the nuclear Special Relationship between America and Britain under the 1958 US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement.

Under Cockcroft&#x27;s direction, AERE took part in frontier fusion research in the post-war years, including the ZETA program. Sir George Paget Thomson began research in nuclear fusion at Imperial College London in 1946. This was subsequently transferred to the Associated Electrical Industries Laboratory at Aldermaston, under Allibone&#x27;s direction. Research independently began at Oxford University under Peter Thonemann. In 1951, Cockcroft arranged for the Oxford group to be transferred to Harwell. Cockcroft approved the construction of ZETA (Zero Energy Thermonuclear Assembly) by the Thonemann&#x27;s Harwell group, and the smaller Sceptre by Allibone&#x27;s AEI group. James L. Tuck&#x27;s group at the Los Alamos Laboratory was also researching fusion, and Cockcroft struck an agreement with the Americans that they would release their results together, which was done in 1958. Despite Cockcroft&#x27;s perennial optimism that a breakthrough was imminent, fusion power remained an elusive goal.

=== Cockcroft&#x27;s Folly ===
As director of the AERE, Cockcroft famously insisted that the chimney stacks of the Windscale plutonium production reactors be fitted, at great expense, with high-performance filters. That was in response to a report that uranium oxide had been found in the vicinity of the X-10 Graphite Reactor in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Because it was decided to fit them after the stacks had been designed, the filters became pronounced lumps at the top of the chimneys.

The reactors had been designed to remain clean and uncorroded during use, so it was thought there would be no particulate for the filters to catch. As well, the uranium oxide at Oak Ridge turned out to be from the chemical plant and not the reactor. The filters therefore became known as &quot;Cockcroft&#x27;s Folly&quot;. However, when the core of one of the two reactors ignited the Windscale fire of 1957, the filters prevented a far worse release of radioactive material. Terence Price, future scientific advisor at the Ministry of Defence in the 1960s, noted that &quot;the word folly did not seem appropriate after the accident&quot;.
==Later life==
On 24 January 1959, Churchill College, Cambridge, was formally recognised by the University. Two days later, the Trustees announced that Cockcroft would be its first Master. Although it would also teach the humanities and social sciences, 70 per cent of the student body would study science and technology related subjects. He nominated the first fellows, and he oversaw the initial construction. Controversy arose over the chapel. A 1961 plan to build it at the entrance to the college, as was traditional at Cambridge, led to the immediate resignation of Francis Crick, a staunch atheist, as a fellow. The first undergraduates arrived in 1961, and the college, still incomplete, was formally opened by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, on 5 June 1964.
Cockcroft was president of the Institute of Physics from 1954 to 1956, and of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. He served as chancellor of the Australian National University in Canberra from 1961 to 1965, a largely symbolic post that involved a visit once a year for degree conferring ceremonies. He delivered the Rutherford Memorial Lecture in 1944. He was the British delegate on the Council of CERN as well as Chairman of the Nuclear Physics Sub-Committee of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.

In addition to winning, along with Walton, the Hughes Medal and 1951 Nobel Prize in Physics, Cockcroft received numerous awards and accolades over the years. He became a knight bachelor in January 1948. This was normal: scientists were seldom inducted into the chivalric orders, but he was created a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in May 1953. Perhaps because this was rare, scientists normally regarded becoming a member of the Order of Merit as a greater honour; Cockcroft became an Order of Merit member in December 1956. He also received the Royal Medal in 1954, the Faraday Medal in 1955, the American Medal of Freedom in 1947 and Atoms for Peace Award in 1961, He was made a Chevalier de la Légion d&#x27;Honneur by France in 1952, and was awarded the Knight Commander of the Military Order of Christ by Portugal in 1955, and the Grand Cross of the Order of Alfonso X by Spain in 1958.
Cockcroft died from a heart attack at his home at Churchill College, Cambridge, on 18 September 1967. He is buried at the Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground in Cambridge, in the same grave as his son Timothy. A memorial service was held at Westminster Abbey on 17 October 1967.

Several buildings in the United Kingdom are named after him: the Cockcroft building at the New Museums Site of the University of Cambridge, comprising a lecture theatre and several hardware laboratories; the Cockcroft Institute at Daresbury Laboratory in Cheshire; the Cockcroft building of the University of Brighton; and the Cockcroft building of the University of Salford. The oldest building at the Research School of Physical Sciences and Engineering, Australian National University, the Cockcroft building, is named after him.

Cockcroft&#x27;s papers are held at the Churchill Archives Centre in Cambridge, and are accessible to the public. They include his lab books, correspondence, photographs (with dozens depicting the construction of Chalk River, CKFT 26/4), theses and political papers.

<doc id="352565" wikidata="Q4701233" url="?curid=352565" title="Akita Sanesue">
<text>was a Japanese daimyo who lived during the Azuchi–Momoyama and early Edo periods.

== Biography ==
He was the son of daimyo Andō Chikasue, a powerful figure in Dewa Province.

Sanesue pledged loyalty to Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1590 during the Siege of Odawara, and served under him in various campaigns such as the Korean campaign.

At the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, he sided with the eastern army. As Satake Yoshinobu was being moved northward to the Akita&#x27;s holdings in 1602, the Akita clan, under Sanesue, was moved to Shishido, in Hitachi Province. Sanesue led his sons into combat at the Osaka Campaign in 1615.

In 1630, because of discontent against the shogunate, he was exiled to Asama in Ise Province, where he died in 1659. Despite this exile, his son Toshisue survived, and was moved to the Miharu Domain, in Mutsu Province, where his descendants remained in power until the Meiji Restoration.

<doc id="352567" wikidata="Q16949946" url="?curid=352567" title="Made in Canada (TV series)">
<text>Made in Canada is a Canadian television comedy which aired on CBC Television from 1998 to 2003. Rick Mercer starred as Richard Strong, an ambitious and amoral television producer working for a company which makes bad (but profitable) television shows. A dark satire about the Canadian television industry, the programme shifted into an episodic situation comedy format after its first season.

It was created by Mercer, Gerald Lunz and Michael Donovan, produced by Salter Street Films and Island Edge, and filmed in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The programme was broadcast with Salter Street&#x27;s satirical newsmagazine, &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot;, and drew its creators, writing staff, and much of its production staff from that programme; &quot;Made in Canada&quot; was filmed during the summer, and &quot;22 Minutes&quot; during the fall. Mercer starred on both until he left &quot;22 Minutes&quot; in 2001.

The programme received critical and popular recognition. It was particularly well-received by the industry it lampooned, attracting many guest stars. The programme received 23 national awards during its five-season run, including multiple Gemini, Writers Guild of Canada, and Canadian Comedy Awards. In the United States, Australia and Latin America, the show was syndicated as The Industry. In France, it was syndicated as La loi du Show-Biz.

==Plot==

A satire of film and television production, the series revolves around fictional Pyramid Productions – a company where greed and backstabbing thrive. Pyramid produces lucrative (but terrible) television and films for the domestic and international markets, with creative decisions made by non-creative people.

Company head Alan Roy is obsessed with appearances and staying ahead of trends, whether this means owning his own cable channel or having the largest yacht at Cannes. His often-idiotic decisions lead to extra work for his employees, who must fulfill his wishes or deal with the consequences. The employees – Richard, Victor, Veronica and Wanda – manipulate each other and sabotage each other&#x27;s projects to earn more money, gain promotions or work on better projects. None of them appear to have issues with breaking the law, and they seem to have no sense of morality. They generally only cooperate when they have an opportunity to destroy another company or a mutual enemy. Each episode deals with one major problem (or event), which normally does not carry over to the next episode.

Pyramid projects also provide storylines for the series, as the company&#x27;s staff try to manage the inevitable complications created by the casts and crews of their film and television productions. Its cash cows are two series: &quot;The Sword of Damacles&quot; , a parody of mythological adventure series such as &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Beaver Creek&quot;, a parody of Canadian period dramas such as &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; and &quot;Road to Avonlea&quot;. The staff also face complications with their low-budget, poorly-made films, such as &quot;Vigilante&#x27;s Vengeance&quot;. Many of their movies fail; they are not produced, or go direct-to-video in foreign countries.

==Characters==
* Richard Strong (Rick Mercer), the central character, is an ambitious, machiavellian employee trying to navigate, scheme and backstab his way to the CEO&#x27;s chair; in the first episode, he makes his way from junior script reader to television producer by having his boss (and brother-in-law) Ray Drodge fired. Ruthless and amoral, he is better at his job than most of his colleagues. Richard has had relationships with Veronica Miller, Lisa Sutton and Siobhan Roy, but generally as an opportunity to manipulate rather than out of love. The character was partially inspired by Ian McKellen&#x27;s performance in the 1995 film adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard III&quot;. He personifies human vice, unfettered by ethics.
* Alan Roy (Peter Keleghan), the firm&#x27;s , is a charismatic but intellectually-questionable womanizer who often succeeds more by accident than skill and, much more often, fails miserably. He is frequently mystified that his management style – a combination of bad production ideas, offbeat health fads and half-understood slogans from management books – does not rouse office morale. Alan&#x27;s career was launched with his first film, &quot;Prom Night at Horny High&quot;, which was a commercial success despite being lowbrow and indecent. (Keleghan had an early starring role in the 1983 sex comedy &quot;Screwballs&quot;.) Keleghan described the character as a cross between Alliance Communications head Robert Lantos and &quot;The Simpsons&quot;″ Mr. Burns. Producer Michael Donovan joked that Alan reflected the showrunners&#x27; impression of him.
* Veronica Miller (Leah Pinsent) is the firm&#x27;s chief operating officer. Although she is generally overworked, doing the jobs of several other employees, she is still forced to do idiotic and degrading tasks for Alan. Veronica occasionally becomes fed up with her poor treatment and sabotages a project or event, which usually spurs Alan to improve her working conditions and meet her demands. The office problem-solver, she is generally an ally of Richard&#x27;s in making the best of Alan&#x27;s decisions but will double-cross him if necessary. 
* Victor Sela (Dan Lett) is head of Pyramid&#x27;s film division and a general office sycophant, willing to do almost anything Alan asks of him (no matter how demeaning). He is usually very positive about Alan&#x27;s schemes. In a test, however, Victor is the least loyal. 
* Wanda Mattice (Jackie Torrens), Alan&#x27;s assistant, uses her influence in the day-to-day workings of the office to obtain power beyond her role in the corporate hierarchy and knows when it is to her advantage to act less intelligent. Although she frequently dresses strangely and appears frumpy, Alan is attracted to her and they frequently have sex in the office. 
* Lisa Sutton (Janet Kidder) is a producer and Victor&#x27;s girlfriend. Richard considers her a threat to his power, and Alan dislikes her for ignoring (or spurning) his attempts to seduce her.
* Raymond Drodge (Ron James) is a producer. Formerly the head of television development, he is fired in the pilot after Richard and Siobhan frame him for sexually harassing Siobhan. He is later rehired in a much lower position after Richard gets his old job. Due to Richard&#x27;s manipulation, Raymond&#x27;s marriage falls apart and he begins to believe that he is an alcoholic.
* Michael Rushton (Alex Carter) is the dimwitted, egotistical star of &quot;The Sword of Damacles&quot;.
* Siobhan Roy (Emily Hampshire), Alan&#x27;s daughter, is one of the stars of &quot;Beaver Creek&quot;. Fully aware that being the boss&#x27;s daughter gives her job security, she freely schemes and manipulates to get whatever she wants.
* Brian Switzer (Chas Lawther), nicknamed &quot;Network Brian&quot;, is an executive with the television network which airs &quot;Beaver Creek&quot; and its main liaison with Pyramid.

===Notable guest stars===
Most people employed in Canadian television enjoyed the programme, which created a stir in the industry and attracted a number of guest stars:

* Gordon Pinsent as Walter Franklyn, star of &quot;Beaver Creek&quot; and &quot;Canada&#x27;s most beloved actor&quot;. Pinsent returns in the last episode as a dairy mogul who buys the company. Mercer considered Pinsent&#x27;s work to be a major influence on his career, and was extremely pleased to have him in the cast; during the series&#x27; production, Mercer narrated a biography of Pinsent.
* Peter Blais as Geoff, an actor who comes out and subsequently wants Parson Hubbard (his character on &quot;Beaver Creek&quot;) to be gay
* Andrew Bush as a young method actor who plays Blind Jimmy on &quot;Beaver Creek&quot;
* Mary-Colin Chisholm as an actor who plays Nurse Melissa on &quot;Beaver Creek&quot;
* Maury Chaykin as Captain McGee, a kiddie entertainer who is caught in a sex scandal
* Andy Jones as Fritz Hoffman, a German TV executive who believes that &quot;Beaver Creek&quot; is a sexier version of &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;
* Sarah Polley as the head of the Church of cult
* Shirley Douglas and Margot Kidder appeared as fading Hollywood actresses making guest appearances on &quot;Beaver Creek&quot;.
* Megan Follows (the real-life star of &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot;) as Mandy Forward, the former &quot;Adele of Beaver Creek&quot;, who returned for a reunion movie and discovered that after her previous Beaver Creek movie, Alan kept the sets up to produce a pornographic knockoff.
* Mark McKinney as Dean Sutherland, a released convict who wants to sell his story
* Don McKellar as Adam Kalilieh, an independent art film director
* Joe Flaherty as a mayoral candidate who hires Pyramid to smear his opponent
* Cynthia Dale and C. David Johnson as a husband-and-wife motivational team
* Colin Mochrie as Frank Roy: Alan&#x27;s mentally-handicapped brother who, as part of an elaborate tax dodge orchestrated by Alan, is revealed as the actual Pyramid CEO.

Several Canadian media personalities made cameos as fictionalized versions of themselves, including Nicholas Campbell, Ann-Marie MacDonald, Moses Znaimer, Keifer Sutherland, Evan Solomon, Peter Gzowski, Ann Medina and Gino Empry.

==Development and writing==

The series was conceived by Mercer, executive producer Gerald Lunz and Salter Street Films co-chair Michael Donovan in 1994. Lunz had launched Mercer&#x27;s career, producing his one-man shows and &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot; (the latter of which was made by Salter Street). Mercer and Lunz formed Island Edge to co-produce &quot;Made in Canada&quot; and develop other projects for Mercer.

Donovon, Lunz and Mercer wanted to satirize office politics, starring Mercer as an ambitious man manipulating his way to the top in a parody of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard III&quot;. Instead of killing his rivals, the programme&#x27;s Richard would kill their careers by ruining their reputations and seizing their power. Richard would address the audience directly, breaking the fourth wall to share his plans and ambitions. Although they realized this was a risk, they felt that Mercer could connect with the audience as he had in his monologues. Mercer had established himself as the first mainstream Canadian satirist to make scathing criticisms directly, without a comedic mask.

They had considered setting the satire in the federal bureaucracy in line with Mercer&#x27;s political criticism (known as the country&#x27;s &quot;unofficial opposition party&quot;), but Mercer was not sufficiently knowledgeable about the government&#x27;s inner workings. Believing that satire required a firm understanding of its targets, they set the programme in a television and film production office; this would be understood by the audience and provide many egos to lampoon. Mercer described the programme in a later interview as having a &quot;&quot;Dilbert&quot; reality&quot; of an office, in which some have a &quot;suck-up kick-down philosophy&quot;. In April 1998, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) approved a six-part series without seeing a script.

The first season was cowritten by Mercer and Mark Farrell over a two-month period. They had both written for &quot;22 Minutes&quot; and had written sketches for several years, but neither had written episodic television before. Lunz, a self-described &quot;Shakespeare nut&quot;, guided the theme and style. Farrell, Lunz and Mercer remained the show&#x27;s creative force throughout its five seasons. Other writers for the series included Paul Bellini, Alex Ganetakos and Edward Riche.

The programme shifted from a dark satire to an episodic sitcom after its first season, and addressed the audience less frequently. This was often limited to the closing line – &quot;I think that went well&quot; or &quot;This is not good&quot; – which might be given to a character other than Richard, depending on who was behind that episode&#x27;s schemes. The series&#x27; working title was &quot;The Industry&quot;, which was changed to &quot;The Casting Couch&quot; and then &quot;Made in Canada&quot;.

==Production==

CBC executive George Anthony, who had convinced Lunz and Mercer to come to the network years previously, recognized their talent and was firmly supportive of the production. The programme went from network approval to broadcast in a record six months. Executives ordered a thirteen-episode second season after viewing the first episode, which was unprecedented for the public broadcaster. Casting was done while scripts were still being written, and episodes were filmed out of sequence to accommodate the actors&#x27; schedules.

Filmed in Halifax, Nova Scotia, the programme was produced by (and a parody of) Salter Street Films. It used Salter Street&#x27;s real offices as its main office set during the first season, shooting primarily on evenings and weekends from 17 July to 24 August 1998.
The first season was directed by Henry Sarwer-Foner (also of &quot;22 Minutes&quot;), who had his hand in the programme&#x27;s editing, scripting, and overall design. He shot with a long lens to achieve a film-like quality, and sought to give it a distinctive look. Sarwer-Foner directed 22 of the series&#x27; 65 episodes. Other directors included Michael Kennedy and Stephen Reynolds.

The programme used The Tragically Hip&#x27;s &quot;Blow at High Dough&quot;, one of Mercer&#x27;s favourite songs, as its theme. The iconic Canadian band&#x27;s first hit single, its title was taken from a Scottish phrase about being overambitious and taking on more than one could handle. The lyrics refer to a movie production (&quot;Speedway&quot;, starring Elvis Presley) which sweeps up a small town. Other Tragically Hip songs were featured including &quot;Poets&quot;, &quot;Courage&quot;, &quot;New Orleans Is Sinking&quot;, &quot;My Music at Work&quot;, and &quot;Tiger the Lion&quot;.

Although Mercer took time off from &quot;22 Minutes&quot; in January 1999 to concentrate on the second season of &quot;Made in Canada&quot;, he continued to appear in most episodes until he retired from &quot;22 Minutes&quot; in 2001.
The programme continued to film during the summer, with &quot;22 Minutes&quot; filming in the fall. The second season began filming in June 1999 at Electropolis Studios in Halifax. CHUM Limited vice-president Moses Znaimer allowed scenes for the second-season finale to be filmed at the CHUM-City Building in Toronto for authenticity. Season four began filming on 18 June 2001.

While the first season of the series was in production, two Canadian film and television studios (Alliance Communications and Atlantis Communications) merged to create Alliance Atlantis. This merger was parodied in &quot;Made in Canada&quot;″s second-season premiere, when Pyramid merges with a company called Prodigy and becomes Pyramid Prodigy. Two years later, Alliance Atlantis purchased Salter Street Films.

==Broadcast and home video==

&quot;Made in Canada&quot; premiered on CBC Television on 5 October 1998, amidst Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) hearings on the country&#x27;s broadcasting policy and Canadian content.
The series aired on Monday nights at 8:30 pm, after &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot;. Both programmes were moved to Friday in fall 2001, leading into &quot;Royal Canadian Air Farce&quot; and &quot;The Red Green Show&quot; in a CBC move to create a comedy-programming block and boost already-strong ratings.

The first two seasons were sold to PBS in 1999 for distribution in the United States as &quot;The Industry&quot;. The series was also syndicated in France, Australia and Latin America; the French name was &quot;La loi du Show-Biz&quot;.

In 2000, DVD and home-video rights to seasons one and two were acquired by Koch International. Entertainment One released the first season on DVD in Region 1 in 2002; it is currently out of print. The series was telecast on the Canadian cable channel BiteTV from 2010 to 2015.

The first and second seasons began streaming on the CBC Gem platform on 12 March 2020. In October 2022, it was announced that additional seasons would become available, with all five seasons streaming on Gem as of 2023.

==Reception==

The series was popular and critically praised in Canada and the United States. The programme&#x27;s 5 October 1998 premiere had 1,002,000 viewers, holding 75 percent of the audience from the lead-in &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot;.

===Critical response===

Shannon Hawkins of the &quot;Ottawa Sun&quot; wrote during its first season that &quot;Made in Canada&quot; had &quot;all the makings of a hit&quot;, with clever dialogue, plausible characters and a storyline for anyone who fantasized about ruining their boss. Antonia Zerbisias of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; described the programme as &quot;scary, cynical and biting&quot;, and felt that the production took huge risks in satirizing its producers and industry moguls and its choice of title in a country which looked down on domestic productions. According to Stephen Cole of &quot;The National Post&quot;, the first season was well-scripted, funny and clever with solid performances but never found a target worthy of its &quot;savage and cutting&quot; satire. Cole was disappointed that the series remained a sitcom instead of taking on more compelling issues specific to the Canadian industry. Rating the first episode 9 out of 10, a &quot;TV Guide&quot; reviewer said that the programme centred on Mercer&#x27;s fresh and deeply-biting &quot;satire with a smirk&quot; complemented with an able cast; although the audience might miss some inside jokes, it was felt that the show should hold the &quot;22 Minutes&quot; audience. For &quot;Saturday Night&quot;, comedy critic Andrew Clark wrote that the programme created an eerily-believable universe with its casting, filming location and fictitious shows, and appreciated Mercer&#x27;s ability to find a satirical line and hone it to a cutting edge.

At the beginning of its fourth season, John Doyle of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; called the show &quot;addictive&quot;, switching from absurdity to brutal satire accessible to every viewer. At the end of the series, Doyle wrote that most in the industry had enjoyed its &quot;twisted, vague versions&quot; of real stories and scandals.

&quot;Made in Canada&quot; has been compared to Ken Finkleman&#x27;s satire, &quot;The Newsroom&quot;, in which Farrell, Keleghan, and Pinsent had roles. Although they share a documentary feel and were shot in real offices, Clark noted that their lead characters are distinctly different; Richard&#x27;s ambition is all-consuming, and he wages &quot;intergenerational warfare&quot; against the likes of Finkleman&#x27;s ineffective George Findlay.

===Awards===

The series was nominated for more than three dozen Gemini Awards during its five-season run, winning ten. &quot;Made in Canada&quot; was nominated for fourteen awards at the 2002 Geminis, the first time a sitcom led dramatic programmes and miniseries in nominations. Its wins included two for Best Comedy Series and three for Best Ensemble Performance in a Comedy.

The show won nine Canadian Comedy Awards out of twenty-six nominations, leading the nominations in 2000, 2002 and 2003. It received four Writers Guild of Canada Awards and a Directors Guild of Canada Award. After the series ended, Mercer won the 2003 Sir Peter Ustinov Comedy Award at the Banff Television Festival, and a 2004 National Arts Centre Award for outstanding work of the previous year.

===Reunion===

A 15th-anniversary &quot;Made in Canada&quot; reunion, attended by Mercer, Keleghan, Pinsent, Lett, Torrens, Lunz, Sarwer-Foner, Riche and Farrell, was held at the Canadian International Television Festival (CITF) on 16 November 2013. The reunion included a screening, followed by a question-and-answer session.

<text>Saumarez is a geographic parish in Gloucester County, New Brunswick, Canada.

For governance purposes, the entire parish is within the regional municipality of Tracadie. Before the formation of the regional municipality in 2014, Saumarez Parish included one town and twelve local service districts, with an additional special service area within the parish LSD.

Tracadie is a member of the Acadian Peninsula Regional Service Commission (APRSC).

==Origin of name==
The parish was named in honour of Sir Thomas Saumarez, acting Governor of New Brunswick when it was erected. Six of the parishes erected simultaneously in Northumberland County in 1814 were named for prominent British military figures.

==History==
Saumarez was erected in 1814 as part of Northumberland County from unassigned territory. It included all modern Gloucester County except Beresford Parish.

In 1827, all of the parish west of Teague&#x27;s Brook was erected as Bathurst Parish.

In 1831, Caraquet and New Bandon were erected as their own parishes.

In 1855, Inkerman was erected from the northern part of Saumarez. The barrier islands east of Tracadie Bay were included in Inkerman.

In 1870, the barrier islands south of the Old Tracadie Gully were returned to Saumarez.

In 1881, a large area along the northwestern boundary was included in the newly erected Saint-Isidore Parish.

In 1947, the western end of Saumarez was included in the newly erected Allardville.

==Boundaries==
Saumarez Parish is bounded:

*on the east by LeBouthillier Brook, the Old Tracadie Gully, and the Gulf of Saint Lawrence;
*on the south by the Northumberland County line;
*on the west by the western line of timber block 4 in Ranges 8, 9, 10, the southernmost corner of Range 10 being downstream of the mouth of Bear Brook and upstream of the mouth of Big Hole Brook;
*on the north by the prolongation of the southern line of Range 9 in the Saint Isidore Settlement, which runs along the south side of Rang 9 Road, northeasterly to the Little Tracadie River, then downstream until it strikes Range 9 again, then northeasterly along Range 9 to its easternmost corner, then northwesterly along the eastern line of Ranges 9, 8 (partly along Alderwood Road), and 7 to the rear line of Range 6 of Saint Isidore, which runs along the south side of Route 160, then northeasterly along Range 6 to its easternmost corner, then northwesterly to the sharp bend of Boishébert Road, then northeasterly along grant lines to Gaspereau Creek, then upstream two grants to the southern line of Route 160 and the W. Gautreau Road, then northeasterly to the Saint-Raymond Road, then northwesterly across two grants to the northern line of the second grant, then northeasterly along the grant line and its prolongation to where Route 11 crosses LeBouthillier Brook.

<text>Mother Svea or Mother Swea (Swedish: &quot;Moder Svea&quot;) is the female personification of Sweden and a patriotic emblem of the Swedish nation.

==Background==
Mother Svea is normally depicted as a powerful female warrior, valkyrie or shieldmaiden, frequently holding a shield and standing beside a lion. Svea is a Swedish female personal name which derives from &quot;svea&quot;, an old plural genitive form meaning &quot;of the Swedes&quot; or the &quot;Swea&quot;. It appears in &quot;Svea rike&quot;, a translation of the old Swedish word &quot;Sverige&quot;, the Swedish name for Sweden.

The popular image is considered to have been created by Swedish writer, (1649–1725) when first introduced in his poem &quot;Svea Lycksaligheets Triumph&quot; (1672).

As a patriotic symbol, Moder Svea gained widespread popularity in &quot;Kunga Skald&quot; (1697), written by Swedish poet Gunno Eurelius (1661–1709) in honor of King Charles XI of Sweden. Eurelius was later ennobled with the name of Dahlstjerna.

Mother Svea appeared frequently as a national symbol in 19th-century Swedish literature and culture. She appeared on various Swedish banknotes for over seventy years, such as both the 5-kronor banknote printed between 1890 and 1952 and the 5-kronor banknote printed between 1954 and 1963.

Swedish singer Lena Philipsson and composer Torgny Söderberg wrote a song entitled &quot;Moder Swea&quot; which was introduced in the 1995 album &quot;Lena Philipsson&quot;.

<doc id="352572" wikidata="Q2342966" url="?curid=352572" title="Akiyama Nobutomo">
<text>was a samurai during the Sengoku period in Japan. He is known as one of the &quot;Twenty-Four Generals of Takeda Shingen&quot;. Nobutomo also served under Shingen&#x27;s son, Takeda Katsuyori.

==Biography==
In 1527, Akiyama Nobutomo was born at in Kai province. His father was Akiyama Nobutou, a descendant of Takeda Mitsutomo, and a member of a cadet branch of the Takeda clan. When Nobutomo came of age, he entered into the service of Takeda Shingen, patriarch of the clan and lord of Kai province, in the mountainous area of central Japan. In 1547, during the campaign for the Ina district, Nobutomo fought with excellence and was granted a fief in the northern half of Ina, present day Kamiina District in Nagano prefecture. Nobutomo continued his service, most often tasked in a defensive role and holding such castles as Takatō Castle and Iida Castle. During this time, Nobutomo acquired the nickname (literally: &quot;Raging Bull of the Takeda Clan&quot;).

By 1568, Nobutomo was esteemed enough to be entrusted with diplomatic duties. In that year, he was dispatched to Gifu Castle where he represented his lord, Takeda Shingen, at the wedding ceremony of Oda Nobutada, eldest son of Nobunaga, and Matsuhime, daughter of Shingen.

In 1571, Takeda Shingen organized a campaign against Tokugawa Ieyasu, intent on taking the coastal lowlands of Tōtōmi province and pushing westward toward the fertile fields of Mikawa province. Nobutomo was recalled from Iida Castle and ordered to lead an invasion of Mino province. His advance was checked by troops of the Saigo clan, led by Saigo Yoshikatsu. The two armies met at the Battle of Takehiro, and though Yoshikatsu was killed in action, Nobutomo was forced to retreat.

In 1572, the Takeda organized another campaign against Mikawa province which would culminate in the Battle of Mikatagahara in January 1573. As Takeda Shingen drove south and west, Nobutomo would descend from the north, cutting off an escape route and blocking reinforcements. To accomplish this, Nobutomo laid siege to Iwamura Castle. When Toyama Kagetou, lord of Iwamura Castle, died of a sudden illness, the morale of the defending troops collapsed, and the Lady Otsuya (Kageto&#x27;s widow and an aunt of Oda Nobunaga) entered into negotiations with Nobutomo. They agreed on a treaty, and under its terms the castle was surrendered without bloodshed, and Lady Otsuya agreed to marry Nobutomo, thus securing his protection and the safety of the defending troops. Also among the spoils was , the biological son of Oda Nobunaga, adopted son of Kageto, who was then seven years old. Nobutomo sent him to Kai Province as a hostage; the boy would later become known as Oda Katsunaga. With the fulfillment of treaty stipulations, Nobutomo made Iwamura Castle his headquarters and a front-line defensive position from which he could support the Takeda.

==Death==
After the death of Takeda Shingen in the spring of 1573, Nobutomo continued to support Shingen&#x27;s son, Takeda Katsuyori, in the prosecution of his campaigns. 

In 1575, Katsuyori lost the Battle of Nagashino, a disaster for the Takeda clan which left Nobutomo at Iwamura Castle without support. Under repeated siege by Oda Nobutada, the forces under Nobutomo managed to hold the castle until November when Nobunaga swept in with the main army. Nobutomo signed a truce to surrender the castle after realizing that he had no chance to hold out any longer. However, Nobunaga broke the truce and ordered Nobutomo, his wife (Nobunaga&#x27;s aunt), and the troops of the castle garrison to be executed.

On December 28, 1575, Nobutomo was crucified upside down on the banks of the Nagara River along with his wife Otsuya no Kata, and his elder retainers Oshima Nagatoshi and Zakouji Sadafusa on the banks.

His domain holdings in Shinano passed to his eldest son Akiyama Katsuhisa.

<doc id="352575" wikidata="Q1165766" url="?curid=352575" title="Metallophone">
<text>A metallophone is any musical instrument in which the sound-producing body is a piece of metal (other than a metal string), such as tuned metal bars, tubes, rods, bowls, or plates. Most frequently the metal body is struck to produce sound, usually with a mallet, but may also be activated by friction, keyboard action, or other means.

Metallophones have been used in music in Asia for thousands of years. There are several different types used in Balinese and Javanese gamelan ensembles, including the gendèr, gangsa and saron. These instruments have a single row of bars, tuned to the distinctive pelog or slendro scales, or a subset of them. The Western glockenspiel and vibraphone are also metallophones: they have two rows of bars, in an imitation of the piano keyboard, and are tuned to the chromatic scale.

In music of the 20th century and beyond, the word &quot;metallophone&quot; is sometimes applied specifically to a single row of metal bars suspended over a resonator box. Metallophones tuned to the diatonic scale are often used in schools; Carl Orff used diatonic metallophones in several of his pieces, including his pedagogical &quot;Schulwerk&quot;. Metallophones with microtonal tunings are used in Iannis Xenakis&#x27; &quot;Pléïades&quot; and in the music of Harry Partch.

==Classification==
Metallophones are a subset, made of metal, of Hornbostel-Sachs category 111.22 Percussion plaques, which is a subset of percussion idiophones.

<doc id="352578" wikidata="Q1082804" url="?curid=352578" title="Akizuki Tanenaga">
<text>was a Japanese samurai warrior and &quot;daimyō&quot; of the late Sengoku and early Edo periods. He was the son of Akizuki Tanezane.

In 1586, Tanenaga joined with his father to fight against Toyotomi Hideyoshi forces during the Kyūshū campaign

In 1598, Tanenaga made contributions at the Siege of Ulsan castle against the allied Chinese and Korean armies. During the Korean campaign, Tanenaga served under Kuroda Nagamasa.

In 1600, in the Battle of Sekigahara, Tanenaga defended Ōgaki Castle on behalf of the &quot;Western Army&quot;. However, soon after the Western Army suffered defeat, Mizuno Katsunari convinced Tanenaga to switch allegiance to the Eastern Army. Tokugawa Ieyasu rewarded Tanenaga by recognizing his territory and enabling him to become the first head of Takanabe Domain in Hyūga Province on the island of Kyushu.

Tanenaga did not have a son so he adopted, Akizuki Taneharu, the son of Tanesada (his son in law also his first cousin who supposedly succeeded him but disinherited due to poor health) and Ochō (his daughter), was appointed as Tanenaga’s successor. Tanenaga died in 1614 and Taneharu inherited the clan.

The emblem is often used as a symbol of official State authority by the Monarchy, the Riksdag, the Government of Sweden and by Swedish embassies around the world, but also appears in other less formal contexts, such as the Sweden men&#x27;s national ice hockey team, who wear the symbol on their sweaters and hence are called &quot;Three Crowns&quot;, and atop the Stockholm City Hall (built 1911–1923). The Three Crowns are also used as the roundel on military aircraft of the Swedish Air Force and as a sign on Swedish military equipment in general, and also on the uniforms and vehicles of the Swedish Police Authority.

== Origins ==
Use of the three crowns as a heraldic symbol of Sweden has been attested, in the &quot;Nordisk Familjebok&quot;, to the late 13th century, the three crowns first ringing the shield of Magnus Ladulås (1240–1290) and later appearing on the coins of Magnus Eriksson (1316–1374).

One of several traditional explanations have suggested that Albert of Mecklenburg (1338–1412), who ruled Sweden 1364–89, brought the symbol from Germany. This theory has been refuted by later research, namely, the announcement in 1982 of the discovery of a frieze in Avignon in southern France, estimated to date back to 1336. The frieze was painted for an international congress led by the Pope and contains the symbols of all participant countries, including Sweden. This discovery suggests the symbol was introduced no later than by Albrekt&#x27;s predecessor, Magnus Eriksson (1316–74).

===Early Swedish heraldry===

The first coat of arms of Sweden from the 13th century featured a golden lion on a background of wavy blue and white diagonal lines (in blazons, &quot;bendy wavy Argent and azure, a lion Or&quot;). It is still part of the present greater coat of arms of Sweden which is quartered between the lion coat of arms and the three crowns. As the lion and the crowns were occasionally re-interpreted as the coat of arms of the provinces of Götaland and Svealand respectively, the lion was earlier, erroneously, called the &quot;Göta lion&quot;.

==Use by Scandinavian unions==

===Union of Magnus Eriksson===
Magnus used the symbols frequently, probably to mark his three kingdoms; Sweden, Norway and Scania. During the early 14th century, Denmark&#x27;s severe financial problems caused most of the country to be pawned to German princes, primarily Gerhard III and John III. Since Denmark&#x27;s king was forced into exile in 1332, the Danish Archbishop in Lund requested that Magnus become king of the Scanian provinces of Denmark. Magnus redeemed the pawn from John III and was sworn in as king of Scania the same year. The earliest known coat of arms featuring three crowns as a symbol of Sweden dates back to the 1330s and appears in a painted frieze in the Cardinal of Bayonne&#x27;s palace in Avignon.

Although Denmark was reconsolidated under King Valdemar Atterdag in 1340 and regained its territory, and Norway left the union with Sweden in 1380, successive Swedish kings continued to use the union coat of arms with the three crowns. An alternative, less well-supported theory suggests that the three crowns are the three kingdoms in the traditional title of the Swedish king, king of Swedes, Goths and Wends. (the two last of which he held in competition with the Danish king). The Swedes-Goths-Wends represent a timely fifteenth-century re-interpretation of the already well-established emblem.

===Kalmar Union===

When the Kalmar Union, the personal union between Denmark, Norway and Sweden, was instituted by Queen Margrete I in 1397, the three crowns symbol reverted to its use as a symbol of the union of three realms. Her successor, Eric of Pomerania, used a coat of arms quartered between the coats of arms of Denmark (three blue lions on a golden shield), Norway (a golden lion with an axe on a red shield) and Sweden (a golden lion on blue and white wavy stripes) plus the union mark with the three golden crowns on a blue shield, which is also the case for the following union Kings in the 15th century.

==Use in post-Kalmar Union Sweden==

Since the three crowns had been used in Sweden between the unions, both King Karl Knutsson Bonde, who periodically drew Sweden out of the Kalmar Union, and King Gustav Vasa, who terminated it in 1521, used the crowns quartered with the lion as a symbol of Sweden, and this has continued to the present day. Since the 15th century, the crowns have been regarded as the &quot;main&quot; arms of Sweden and thus can be used independently as the lesser coat of arms of the country.

The symbol is known to have been placed atop the central tower of the castle Tre Kronor (Three Crowns) in Stockholm, destroyed by fire in 1697, no later than the early 16th century.

==The Three Crowns Conflict==
In the 1550s, King Gustav Vasa of Sweden found that the Danish King Christian III had added the three crowns to his own coat of arms. Because the three crowns had been a Swedish symbol since the 14th century and were used by Danish monarchs only during the Kalmar Union, Gustav interpreted Christian III&#x27;s use of the symbol as a sign of intent to conquer Sweden and resurrect the union. Christian countered that, since the monarchs of the union had used the three crowns, the symbol now belonged to both kingdoms and he had as much a right as the Swedish king to use it.

In Sweden, the Three Crowns were regarded as an exclusively Swedish symbol. This led to a long-lasting diplomatic conflict between the two countries, the so-called Three Crowns Conflict, with Sweden accusing Denmark of imperialism by using a Swedish symbol, and Denmark accusing Sweden of monopolizing the use of a Scandinavian union symbol.

This conflict played a role at the outbreak of the Northern Seven Years&#x27; War in 1563. At the beginning of the 17th century the conflict was settled with both countries being allowed to use the Three Crowns in their coats of arms, although in Denmark it had a less prominent place in the shield, and was officially referred to as a heraldic reminder of the former Kalmar Union. Denmark used the Three Crowns in this way from 1546, until they were removed from the new coat of arms that was introduced in 2024.

== Other three crown designs ==

Some heraldic displays outside of Sweden also incorporate triple crown designs. Some of the notable of these uses are discussed below.

===In Central and Eastern European armory===
The historical region of Galicia, now divided between Poland and Ukraine, had under Austro-Hungarian rule as its coat-of-arms a blue shield with three gold crowns as part of the design. The crowns are said to represent Lodomeria, a historical province that was united with Galicia, while Galicia itself was represented by the black crow.

===In French and German armory===

The emblem of Henry III of France was &quot;Manet ultima coelo&quot; with three crowns.

The French Caribbean island of Saint Barthélemy was a Swedish colony between 1784 and 1878, and the island&#x27;s coat of arms includes the three crowns as part of the design.

The German towns of Otterfing and Tegernsee in Bavaria use the three gold crowns on blue design on their coats-of-arms.

===In Irish armory===

Practically identical to the three crowns of Sweden is that of the coat of arms and flag of the Province of Munster, a region in the southwest of Ireland. Like the Swedish model, it comprises two crowns above and one below. These represent the three great duchies of the province, Desmond, Ormond and Thomond. The design was used as the flag of the Lordship of Ireland between 1171–1541 following the Norman invasion of Ireland until being replaced by the flag of the Kingdom of Ireland.

===In English armory===

A shield of three golden crowns, placed two above one, on a blue background, has been used a symbol of East Anglia for centuries. The coat of arms was ascribed by mediaeval heralds to the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of East Anglia and the Wuffingas dynasty which ruled it. The flag of the East Anglian king and saint, Edmund the Martyr consists of three gold crowns on a field of blue (&quot;Azure, three crowns Or&quot;), The East Anglian flag as it is known today was proposed by George Henry Langham and adopted in 1902 by the London Society of East Anglians (established in 1896). It superimposes the three crowns in a blue shield on a St George&#x27;s cross.

The three crowns appear, carved in stone, on the baptismal font (c.1400) in the parish church of Saxmundham, and on the 15th century porch of Woolpit church, both in Suffolk.

The emblem of three crowns is evident in East Anglian local heraldry; they appear in the arms of the diocese of Ely and the borough of Bury St Edmunds where the crowns are shown pierced with arrows to represent the martyrdom of St. Edmund. They were also included in the arms of the former Isle of Ely County Council, the Borough of Colchester and the University of East Anglia.

A three crowns design is the coat of arms of the city of Kingston upon Hull, a large port in Yorkshire, but this design sees the three crowns stacked vertically and relates back to the Royal charter of 1299. The emblem is used by the city council and the city&#x27;s two rugby league teams.

In the literature, the coat of arms of the legendary King Arthur is also often given as azure with three crowns or. Indeed, Britain included three realms, Logres (England), Cambria (Wales) and Alba (Scotland).

The University of Oxford uses as its arms the three gold crowns on blue accompanied by an open book. The origin of the three crowns is not exactly known but may refer to the arms of Thomas Cranley, Chancellor of the University of Oxford in 1390.

Two dioceses of the Church of England use the three crowns emblem; Ely (gules three ducal coronets two over one or) and Bristol (sable three crowns arranged in pale or, similar to the city of Hull).

The first corporate coat of arms was granted in 1439 to the Drapers&#x27; Company in London with three triple crowns. Three crowns also form the logo of Coutts, the London-based private bankers, but in this case the design comprises one crown at the top, with two below.

=== In Scottish armory ===

The coat of arms of the chief of Clan Grant displays the three gold crowns on a red background (gules, three ancient crowns or). Earlier it is recorded to have been three gold crowns on a blue background (azure, three crowns or). The Grant arms formed the basis of the arms of the burgh of Grantown-on-Spey, which was founded on the clan&#x27;s land in 1765.

The coat of arms of the chief of Clan Arthur (or Clan MacArthur) uses the three gold crowns on blue (azure, three antique crowns or).

===In Spanish armory===

The three gold crowns on blue design appears on the coat of arms of the Spanish city of Burriana in the Valencian Community, but, like Coutts &amp; Co, is arranged one over two instead of two over one. The crowns here refer to the fact that in 1901, the Queen Regent of Spain, Maria Christina of Austria, gave the town the title of city, and was crowned three times.

===In modern trade marks===

A symbol with three crowns was used by Chrysler on some of its New Yorker models in the 1960s. A symbol for the marque&#x27;s top model, the crowns were placed in a row on the vehicle rear and over each other in the front. During the 1980s and 1990s, Broderbund Software used a stylised variant of the symbol.

<text>A non-denial denial is a statement that, at first hearing, seems to be a direct, clearcut and unambiguous denial of some allegation or accusation, but after being parsed carefully turns out not to be a denial at all, and is thus not explicitly untruthful if the allegation is in fact correct. It is a case in which words that are literally true are used to convey a false impression; analysis of whether or when such behavior constitutes lying is a long-standing issue in ethics. British newspaper &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; has defined it as &quot;an on-the-record statement, usually made by a politician, repudiating a journalist&#x27;s story, but in such a way as to leave open the possibility that it is actually true&quot;.

==Origin and history of the phrase==
&quot;The Washington Post&quot; editor Ben Bradlee &quot;is credited with coining the phrase &quot;non-denial denial&quot; to characterize the evasive Oval Office answers to questions.&quot;

The phrase was popularized during the Watergate scandal by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein in their 1974 book &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot;, in reference to evasive statements and equivocal denials by then-Attorney General John N. Mitchell.

William Goldman&#x27;s screenplay for the 1976 film adaptation put the phrase into the mouth of Ben Bradlee and used it for dramatic purpose. The Bradlee character looks at some White House releases and comments &quot;All non-denial denials. We&#x27;re dirty, guys, and they doubt we were ever virgins, but they don&#x27;t say the story is inaccurate.&quot; Later, Bradlee worries about the accuracy of a story and asks the reporters &quot;That didn&#x27;t sound to me like a non-denial denial. Could you have been wrong?&quot; But when other editors suggest that the paper needs to back down, Bradlee writes a note that says &quot;We stand by our story,&quot; which he calls &quot;&quot;My&quot; non-denial denial&quot;; then he adds, &quot;Fuck it, we&#x27;ll stand by the boys.&quot;

A 1976 newspaper article called an Olympic official&#x27;s statement on blood doping &quot;a non-denial denial, a Watergate denial&quot;, while a 2003 assessment of Ron Ziegler&#x27;s career dubbed him &quot;the non-denial denier&quot; and placed his tenure as White House Press Secretary in &quot;the Alice-in-Wonderland era that spawned the form of official evasion that came to be known as the non-denial denial&quot;.

==Examples==

===Tony Blair===
Another example, characterized by the BBC as a &quot;non-denial denial&quot;, was provided by Tony Blair, who was interviewed in 1997, just before the general election, by the British newspaper &quot;Evening Standard&quot;. The question was: &quot;Will Labour introduce tuition fees for higher education?&quot; Blair&#x27;s answer was: &quot;Labour has no plans to introduce tuition fees for higher education.&quot; &quot;No plans&quot; does not mean &quot;no tuition fees&quot;, nor even that there was no intention to introduce them, perhaps only that the plan for this was not finalized. The Labour Party used the same ambiguous wording in its manifesto for the election in 2001, writing: &quot;We will not introduce &#x27;top-up&#x27; fees and have legislated to prevent them.&quot; The increase of university fees up to £3000 was voted for before the next election in 2005, but implemented in 2006. Therefore, the British government explained that the manifesto in 2001 was only valid for the period up to the election in 2005.

===Mark McGwire===
Investigative journalists Lance Williams and Mark Fainaru-Wada used the phrase in their 2006 book &quot;Game of Shadows&quot; to characterize an ambiguous response by retired major league baseball star Mark McGwire during a congressional hearing on steroids in baseball:

===Bruce Edwards Ivins===

Statements allegedly made in 2008 by the US biodefence researcher Bruce Edwards Ivins have been characterized by the FBI as &quot;non-denial denials&quot;. Ivins was the chief suspect in the investigation into the 2001 anthrax attacks on US media outlets and senators. In 2008, he was involuntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital, where the FBI later said his statements included the following.
* &quot;I can tell you I don&#x27;t have it in my heart to kill anybody&quot;
* &quot;I do not have any recollection of ever have doing anything like that. As a matter of fact, I don&#x27;t have no clue how to, how to make a bio-weapon and I don&#x27;t want to know.&quot;
* &quot;I can tell you, I am not a killer at heart&quot;
* &quot;If I found out I was involved in some way, and, and ...&quot;
* &quot;I don&#x27;t think of myself as a vicious, a, a nasty evil person.&quot;
* &quot;I don&#x27;t like to hurt people, accidentally, in, in any way. And [several named scientists] wouldn&#x27;t do that. And I, in my right mind wouldn&#x27;t do it [laughs] ... But it&#x27;s still, but I still feel responsibility because it [the anthrax] wasn&#x27;t locked up at the time ...&quot;

The FBI said these alleged remarks suggested that Ivins, who they said had suffered from long-term mental health problems, had been the perpetrator of the attacks. However, he died before charges were brought against him (a suicide, according to the FBI).

<doc id="352587" wikidata="Q6754149" url="?curid=352587" title="Mapp v. Ohio">
<text>Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643 (1961), was a landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in which the Court ruled that the exclusionary rule, which prevents a prosecutor from using evidence that was obtained by violating the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, applies to states as well as the federal government. 

The Supreme Court accomplished this by use of a principle known as selective incorporation. In &quot;Mapp,&quot; this involved the incorporation of the provisions, as interpreted by the Court, of the 4th Amendment, which applies only to actions of the federal government into the 14th Amendment&#x27;s due process clause. Citing &quot;Boyd v. United States&quot;, the Court opined, &quot;It is not the breaking of his doors, and the rummaging of his drawers, that constitutes the essence of the offense; but it is the invasion of his indefeasible right of personal security, personal liberty, and private property.&quot;

==Legal background==

The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides: &quot;The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated...&quot; Until the early 20th century, Americans&#x27; only legal remedy in cases where law enforcement officers violated the Fourth Amendment was a private lawsuit against the officers involved, either in trespass to recover damages, or in replevin to recover their seized goods or property. This changed in 1914 when the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled in &quot;Weeks v. United States&quot; that any evidence obtained by federal law enforcement officers in violation of the Fourth Amendment could not be used in federal criminal proceedings. In an opinion written by Justice William R. Day, the Court reasoned that the Supreme Court had a constitutional duty to ensure federal courts excluded illegally obtained evidence:

Over the next several decades, the Court generally held that this &quot;exclusionary rule&quot; only applied to cases in which federal law enforcement officers, not state officers, were involved in illegal searches and seizures. In 1949, the Court confronted the issue of the exclusionary rule&#x27;s application to states in the case of &quot;Wolf v. Colorado&quot;. The &quot;Wolf&quot; Court surveyed existing U.S. states and found that although 17 states had adopted the exclusionary rule of &quot;Weeks&quot; in their state law, 30 others had rejected it. It therefore concluded that it was not a &quot;departure from basic standards&quot; of due process to allow states to introduce illegally obtained evidence in state trials. 

For the next 12 years, the Supreme Court only applied the exclusionary rule to evidence obtained by state officers for use in state court prosecutions when the state officers used coercion, violence, or brutality. For example, in the 1952 case &quot;Rochin v. California&quot;, the Court required a California state court to exclude evidence that state officers had illegally obtained, but only because the officers had used &quot;conduct that shocks the conscience&quot;—specifically, they had a doctor give the suspect an emetic to force him to vomit up capsules he had swallowed.

==Case history==
Dollree &quot;Dolly&quot; Mapp was a young woman in Cleveland, Ohio who in the mid-1950s became involved in the illegal gambling operations of mobster and racketeer Shondor Birns, who dominated organized crime in the city. On May 23, 1957, Cleveland police received an anonymous tip that a suspect named Virgil Ogletree might be found at Mapp&#x27;s house, along with illegal betting slips and equipment employed in a &quot;numbers game&quot; set up by Mapp&#x27;s boyfriend. Ogletree was involved in the Cleveland illegal betting world, centered on the city&#x27;s Short Vincent. Ogletree was wanted for questioning regarding his role in the bombing of the home of rival gambling racketeer Don King—who later became a major boxing promoter. Three policemen went to Mapp&#x27;s home and asked for permission to enter, but Mapp, after consulting her lawyer by telephone, refused to admit them without a search warrant. Two officers left, and one remained, watching the house from across the street.

Three hours later, more police officers arrived and knocked on the door. When Mapp did not answer, they forced the door open. Mapp asked to see their search warrant, and was shown a piece of paper, which she snatched away from one of the officers, putting it inside her blouse. The officers struggled with Mapp and recovered the piece of paper, which was not seen by her or her lawyers again, and was not introduced as evidence in any of the ensuing court proceedings. As the search of Mapp&#x27;s second-floor, two-bedroom apartment began, police handcuffed her for being belligerent. The police searched the house thoroughly, and discovered Ogletree (who was eventually cleared on the bombing charge) hiding in the apartment of the downstairs tenant. In the search of Mapp&#x27;s apartment and in a footlocker in the basement of the house, the police found betting slips. They also found a pistol and several pornographic books and pictures, which Mapp said a previous tenant had left behind. The police arrested Mapp, and charged her with a misdemeanor count of possessing numbers-game paraphernalia, but she was acquitted.

Several months later, after Mapp refused to testify against Birns and his associates at their trial for the attempted shakedown of King, she was prosecuted for possession of the pornographic books. Mapp was found guilty at trial of &quot;knowingly having had in her possession and under her control certain lewd and lascivious books, pictures, and photographs in violation of 2905.34 of Ohio&#x27;s Revised Code,&quot; and sentenced to one to seven years in prison. Mapp was convicted, even though prosecutors were unable to produce a valid search warrant. She appealed to the Supreme Court of Ohio, which affirmed her conviction, because even though the search warrant&#x27;s validity was doubtful and the police&#x27;s search of her home was illegal, the police officers had not used brutal force against her, and so under the Supreme Court&#x27;s precedents in &quot;Wolf&quot; and &quot;Rochin,&quot; the exclusionary rule did not have to apply. Mapp then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which agreed to hear her case.

== Decision ==
On June 19, 1961, the Supreme Court issued a 6–3 decision in favor of Mapp that overturned her conviction, and held that the exclusionary rule applies to state governments as well as the federal government.

===Opinion of the Court ===

Six justices formed the majority and joined an opinion written by justice Tom C. Clark. The Court observed that of the 30 U.S. states that had rejected the exclusionary rule at the time of &quot;Wolf v. Colorado&quot; in 1949, more than half had adopted at least a partial form of it in the intervening 12 years. Regarding its statements in &quot;Wolf&quot; that other preexisting remedies, like private lawsuits and good oversight of police forces, would be enough to enforce the Fourth Amendment, the Court said that experience had shown that &quot;such remedies have been worthless and futile.&quot;

The Court then overruled &quot;Wolf,&quot; and held that &quot;all evidence obtained by searches and seizures in violation of the Constitution is, by that same authority, inadmissible in a state court.&quot; Justice Clark stated that without the exclusionary rule, the Fourth Amendment&#x27;s protections against unreasonable searches and seizures would be merely &quot;a form of words&quot; that would be &quot;valueless and undeserving of mention in a perpetual charter of inestimable human liberties.&quot; In addition, because prior cases had ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporated the Fourth Amendment against the states, the Court held that this reasoning applied equally to federal and state criminal proceedings. In a frequently quoted passage, the Court wrote:

Clark concluded the Court&#x27;s opinion by reiterating how the &quot;ignoble shortcut&quot; around the Fourth Amendment that &quot;Wolf&quot; had left open to state law enforcement officers had &quot;tend[ed] to destroy the entire system of constitutional restraints on which the liberties of the people rest,&quot; and subsequently reversed the Supreme Court of Ohio&#x27;s judgment against Dolly Mapp.

===Concurring opinion===
Justice Hugo Black joined the majority opinion, but also wrote a concurring opinion in which he stated that although he thought that the Fourth Amendment alone was not enough to justify the exclusionary rule, when the Fourth Amendment&#x27;s protections were combined with the Fifth Amendment&#x27;s protection against self-incrimination, a resulting &quot;constitutional basis emerges which not only justifies but actually requires the exclusionary rule.&quot;

===Dissenting opinion===
Three justices dissented from the Court&#x27;s decision, and joined an opinion written by Justice John Marshall Harlan II. Harlan wrote that the Court should not have reached the Fourth Amendment issues in the case, because Mapp&#x27;s conviction and the subsequent arguments at her appeals had focused on the legality of Ohio&#x27;s anti-pornography laws, and not on the police officers’ warrantless search of her home. Harlan wrote that the Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Wolf&quot; should be upheld per the principle of &quot;stare decisis&quot;, and that it did not require the entirety of the Fourth Amendment to be enforced against the states, but rather only the &quot;principle of privacy which is at the core of the Fourth Amendment.&quot;

<text>Haka (, ; singular &quot;haka&quot;, in both Māori and New Zealand English) are a variety of ceremonial dances in Māori culture. A performance art, haka are often performed by a group, with vigorous movements and stamping of the feet with rhythmically shouted accompaniment. Haka have been traditionally performed by both men and women for a variety of social functions within Māori culture. They are performed to welcome distinguished guests, or to acknowledge great achievements, occasions, or funerals.

Kapa haka groups are common in schools. The main Māori performing arts competition, Te Matatini, takes place every two years.

New Zealand sports teams&#x27; practice of performing a haka to challenge opponents before international matches has made the dance form more widely known around the world. This tradition began with the 1888–89 New Zealand Native football team tour and has been carried on by the New Zealand rugby union team (known as the All Blacks) since 1905. Although popularly associated with the traditional battle preparations of male warriors, conceptions that haka are typically war dances, are considered erroneous by Māori scholars, alongside the inaccurate performance of haka by non-Māori.

== Etymology ==
The group of people performing a haka is referred to as a &quot;kapa haka&quot; (&quot;kapa&quot; meaning &quot;group&quot; or &quot;team&quot;, and also &quot;rank&quot; or &quot;row&quot;). The Māori word &quot;haka&quot; has cognates in other Polynesian languages, for example: Samoan &quot;saʻa&quot; (saʻasaʻa), Tokelauan &quot;haka&quot;, Rarotongan &quot;ʻaka&quot;, Hawaiian &quot;haʻa&quot;, Marquesan &quot;haka&quot;, meaning &#x27;to be short-legged&#x27; or &#x27;dance&#x27;; all from Proto-Polynesian &quot;saka&quot;, from Proto-Malayo-Polynesian &quot;sakaŋ&quot;, meaning &#x27;bowlegged&#x27;.

== History and practice ==
=== Overview ===
Haka is a form of indigenous dance that encompasses multiple ceremonial purposes in Māori culture. As Nathan Matthew explains, &quot;it is a posture dance accompanied by chanted or shouted song... One of the main characteristics of haka are that actions involving all parts of the body are used to emphasise the words.&quot;

=== Origins in Māori tradition ===
According to Māori tradition, haka originated from a creation story. The sun god, Tama-nui-te-rā, had two wives, the Summer Maid, Hine-raumati, and the Winter Maid, Hine-takurua. Haka originated in the coming of Hine-raumati, whose presence on still, hot days was revealed in a quivering appearance in the air. This was haka of Tāne-rore, the son of Hine-raumati and Tama-nui-te-rā. Hyland comments that &quot;[t]he haka is (and also represents) a natural phenomena ; on hot summer days, the &#x27;shimmering&#x27; atmospheric distortion of air emanating from the ground is personified as &#x27;Te Haka a Tānerore&#x27;&quot;.

=== Types and functions ===
Haka includes various forms serving different ceremonial purposes. These functions include:
* welcoming guests (),
* fare-welling and mourning the deceased (),
* giving advice or instructions (),
* restoring self-respect (),
* intimidating adversaries ( – war dance),
* and transmitting social and political messages ().

The is a war haka that uses weapons, while is performed without weapons and is the more common ceremonial form. Other forms include:
* (similar to but with sideways jumping),
* (like with no jumping),
* (like with no set actions, usually ceremonial and connected with death), and
* (hatred or venting haka).

=== Performance elements ===
Various actions are employed in haka performance, including facial contortions such as showing the whites of the eyes (), and poking out the tongue (, performed by men only), and a wide variety of vigorous body actions such as slapping the hands against the body and stomping of the feet. The body serves as the instrument and vessel of delivery, with the key aspect being the words and the message they contain.

=== 18th and 19th centuries ===

The earliest Europeans to witness haka described them as being &quot;vigorous&quot; and &quot;ferocious&quot;. Joseph Banks, who accompanied James Cook on his first voyage to New Zealand in 1769, later recorded:

From their arrival in the early 19th century, Christian missionaries tried to eradicate haka, along with other forms of Māori culture that they saw as conflicting with Christian beliefs and practice. Henry Williams, the leader of the Church Missionary Society mission in New Zealand, aimed to replace haka and traditional Māori chants () with hymns. Missionaries also encouraged European harmonic singing as part of the process of conversion.

The use of haka in welcoming ceremonies for members of British royal family helped to improve its standing among Europeans. Prince Alfred, the Duke of Edinburgh, was the first royal to visit New Zealand, in 1869. Upon the Duke&#x27;s arrival at the wharf in Wellington, he was greeted by a vigorous haka. The &quot;Wellington Independent&quot; reported, &quot;The excitement of the becomes uncontrollable. They gesticulate, they dance, they throw their weapons wildly in the air, while they yell like fiends let loose. But all this fierce yelling is of the most friendly character. They are bidding the Duke welcome.&quot;

=== Modern haka ===

In modern times, various haka have been composed to be performed by women and even children. In some haka the men start the performance and women join in later. Haka are performed for various reasons: for welcoming distinguished guests, or to acknowledge great achievements, occasions or funerals.

The 1888–89 New Zealand Native football team began a tradition by performing haka during an international tour. The common use of haka by the national rugby union team before matches, beginning with The Original All Blacks in 1905, has made one type of haka familiar.
Some events have caused protests. The 1979 annual &quot;haka party&quot; parade at the University of Auckland – in which engineering students persisted in parodying haka by painting male genitals on their body and performing with sexually obscene gestures – was disrupted by a collection of Māori and Pacific Island students (, or The War Party) headed by Ngā Tamatoa, a prominent Māori activist group. For two decades people including Māori students at the university had asked the university and the engineering department to stop the tradition. In 1979, the protesters included Hone Harawira, later a Member of Parliament. Several of the engineering students were assaulted, and members of were arrested. Their court case in Auckland sparked anti-racism protests outside the courthouse and was supported by a range of people including the president of the Auckland University Students Association.

The choreographed dance and chant popularized around the world by the All Blacks derives from &quot;Ka Mate&quot;, a brief haka previously intended for extemporaneous, non-synchronized performance, whose composition is attributed to Te Rauparaha (1760s–1849), a war leader of the Ngāti Toa tribe. The &quot;Ka Mate&quot; haka is classified as a – a ceremonial haka performed without weapons. &quot;Ka Mate&quot; is about the cunning ruse Te Rauparaha used to outwit his enemies, and may be interpreted as &quot;a celebration of the triumph of life over death&quot;. Concerns were expressed that the authorship and significance of this haka to the Ngāti Toa were being lost and that it had &quot;become the most performed, the most maligned, the most abused of all haka&quot;, and was now &quot;the most globally recognised form of cultural appropriation&quot;. Specific legal challenges regarding the rights of the Ngāti Toa to be acknowledged as the authors and owners of &quot;Ka Mate&quot; were eventually settled in a Deed of Settlement between Ngāti Toa and the New Zealand Government and New Zealand Rugby Union agreed in 2009 and signed in 2012.

====Spread to other Austronesian nation-states====
The Malay College Kuala Kangsar, a historically all-boys all-Malay prestige boarding school in Malaysia adopted the haka for their own rugby team in admiration of the New Zealand All-Blacks&#x27; popularity in the 1970s under the tutelarship of Neil Jonathan Ryan. In return, said college&#x27;s cheer team developed their own cry in similar energy known as the &quot;bungwak&quot;. Neighbouring Singapore&#x27;s Rugby Union in 2004 took on an attempt of collaborating with students all over the island to create a &quot;Singapore Roar&quot; inspired by the haka, even though the majority of its demographic is Chinese.

In Indonesia, a culture of doing the &#x27;Haka-haka&#x27; or its more commonly known variation &#x27;Yel-yel&#x27; exist and performed by groups such as military personnel, law enforcement, civil servants, students, and others.

== Cultural influence ==
In the 21st century, kapa haka has been offered as a subject in universities, including the study of haka, and is practiced in schools and military institutions.

In addition to the national Te Matatini (&quot;many faces&quot;) festival, local and regional competitions attract dozens of teams and thousands of spectators.

The All Blacks&#x27; use of haka has become the most widely known, but several other New Zealand sports teams now perform haka before commencing a game. These include the national rugby league team (&quot;the Kiwis&quot;), and the men&#x27;s national basketball team (&quot;Tall Blacks&quot;). In the lead up to the Rugby World Cup in 2011, flashmob haka became a popular way of expressing support for the All Blacks. Some Māori leaders thought it was &quot;inappropriate&quot; and a &quot;bastardisation&quot; of haka. Sizeable flashmob haka were performed in Wellington and Auckland, as well as London, which has a large New Zealander immigrant community.

The music video for the song &quot;Poi E&quot; (1983) by the Pātea Māori Club, written by Dalvanius Prime and Ngoi Pēwhairangi, used a mixture of kapa haka and hip-hop choreography. This was then mixed with moves from Michael Jackson&#x27;s Thriller music video as the outro song parody for Taika Waititi&#x27;s movie &quot;Boy&quot; (2010)&quot;.&quot;

In November 2012, a Māori kapa haka group from Rotorua performed a version of the &quot;Gangnam Style&quot; dance mixed with a traditional haka in Seoul, celebrating 50 years of diplomatic relations between South Korea and New Zealand.

On 7 December 2014, at the 2014 Roller Derby World Cup in Dallas, Texas, Team New Zealand performed a haka on roller skates to the Australian Roller Derby team before their bout in the quarter-finals. Team New Zealand performed a haka before their debut game against Team USA at the 2011 Roller Derby World Cup, on 1 December 2011; however, it was unexpected and the arena music was still playing. It has since become an expected tradition.

In 2017, actor Dwayne Johnson performed a haka with a girls soccer team in &quot;The Fate of the Furious&quot;.

Actor Jason Momoa performed a haka with a group of performers on the red carpet at the &quot;Aquaman&quot; premiere in Los Angeles in 2018.

In March 2019, following the Christchurch mosque shootings, school pupils and other groups performed haka to honour those killed in the attacks.

The choreography in the &quot;Miroh&quot; music video by South Korean boy band Stray Kids featured haka elements.

Three or four American football teams are known to perform haka as a pregame rite. This appears to have begun at Kahuku High School where both the student body and local community includes many Polynesian Hawaiians, Māori, Samoans, Tahitians, and Tongans. The University of Hawaii Rainbow Warriors football team also adopted haka as a pregame rite during the 2006 season, and the practice has spread to a number of other teams overseas; there has, however, been some criticism of this as inappropriate and disrespectful. Non-traditional or inaccurate haka performances have been criticised by Māori academics, such as Morgan Godfery.

In September 2024, thousands gathered in Eden Park in Auckland to break the record of the largest haka performance. France held the previous official world record since 2014.

On 14 November 2024, MP Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke led a haka inside the New Zealand Parliament to protest the Treaty Principles Bill, joined by Debbie Ngarewa-Packer, Rawiri Waititi, and other MPs. Debate was temporarily paused and the house voted to suspend Maipi-Clarke.

<text>The National Climate Assessment (NCA) is an initiative within the U.S. federal government focused on climate change science, formed under the auspices of the Global Change Research Act of 1990. 

== Background ==
The NCA is a major product of the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) which coordinates a team of experts and receives input from a Federal Advisory Committee. NCA research is integrated and summarized in the mandatory ongoing National Climate Assessment Reports. The reports are &quot;extensively reviewed by the public and experts, including federal agencies and a panel of the National Academy of Sciences. For the Third National Climate Assessment, released in 2014, USGCRP coordinated hundreds of experts and received advice from a sixty-member Federal Advisory Committee. The Fourth NCA (NCA4) was released in two volumes, in October 2017 and in November 2018.

==General==
The First National Climate Assessment was published in 2000. Between 2002 and 2009, USGCRP previously known as the U.S. Climate Change Science Program (CCSP), produced 21 Synthesis and Assessment Products (SAPs). The second NCA was published in 2009 and the third was released in 2014.

NCA&#x27;s overarching goal according to their May 20, 2011 engagement strategy summary, &quot;is to enhance the ability of the U.S. to anticipate, mitigate, and adapt to changes in the global environment (NCA 2011:2).&quot; 

According to the USGCRP official website the NCA, 
In 2013, the President&#x27;s Climate Action Plan released by the Executive Office of the President specifically noted the importance of the National Climate Assessments in achieving the goal of &quot;Using Sound Science to Manage Climate Impacts&quot;.

The next assessment is scheduled to be released is 2023. On August 18, 2017, a 15-member advisory committee that was tasked with writing &quot;concrete guidance&quot; based on the assessment was disbanded. NOAA said that the disbandment of the committee will not &quot;impact the completion of the Fourth National Climate Assessment.&quot;

==Global Change Research Act==
The National Climate Assessment (NCA) is conducted under the auspices of the Global Change Research Act of 1990. The GCRA requires a report to the President and the Congress every four years that integrates, evaluates, and interprets the findings of the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP); analyzes the effects of global change on the natural environment, agriculture, energy production and use, land and water resources, transportation, human health and welfare, human social systems, and biological diversity; and analyzes current trends in global change, both human-induced and natural, and projects major trends for the subsequent 25 to 100 years.

The Federal government is responsible for producing these reports through the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), a collaboration of 13 Federal agencies and departments.

==National Climate Assessment and Development Advisory Committee (NCADAC)==

The National Climate Assessment and Development Advisory Committee (NCADAC) was a 60-person U.S. Federal Advisory Committee which oversaw the development of the draft Third NCA report and made recommendations about the ongoing assessment process. The committee was sun-set in fall 2014. The Department of Commerce established the NCADAC in December 2010 as per the Federal Advisory Committee Act (1972). 1972. The NCADAC was supported through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

The successor &quot;Advisory Committee for the Sustained National Climate Assessment&quot;, established in 2015, was sunsetted by the Trump administration on August 20, 2017. The fifteen-member committee was chaired by Richard H. Moss.

==National Assessment Synthesis Team (NAST)==
In 1998, the first National Assessment Synthesis Team (NAST) was formed under the auspices of the Subcommittee on Global Change Research (SGCR), through the Committee on Environmental and Natural Resources (CENR) and the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) with members from &quot;government, academia, and private enterprise.&quot; Its mandate was to broadly &quot;design and conduct&quot; &quot;national efforts to assess the consequences of climate variability and climate change for the United States.&quot; NAST is an advisory committee chartered under the Federal Advisory Committee Act to help the US Global Change Research Program fulfill its legal mandate under the Global Change Research Act of 1990. The NSTC forwarded the report to the President and Congress for their consideration as required by the Global Change Research Act. Administrative support for the US Global Change Research Program was provided by the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, which was sponsored by the National Science Foundation.&quot; In their 2001 assessment, the NAST concluded in the United States, &quot;natural ecosystems appear to be the most vulnerable to the harmful effects of climate change.&quot; In their 2001 report they also described long-term major trends in climate change in the twenty-first century. The first NAST co-chairs were Dr. Jerry M. Melillo of the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, Tony Janetos, and Thomas Karl.

==National Climate Assessment Reports==
===First National Climate Assessment (NCA1) 2000===
The First National Climate Assessment prepared by National Assessment Synthesis Team (NAST), entitled &quot;Climate Change Impacts on the United States: the Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change&quot;, was released in 2000. The report was a multidisciplinary effort to study and portray in regional detail the potential effects of human-induced global warming on the United States. The project was articulated into some 20 regional studies - each involving dozens of scientific and academic experts as well as representatives of industry and environmental groups.

===Second National Climate Assessment (NCA2) 2009===
The Second National Climate Assessment, entitled &quot;Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States&quot;, was published in 2009. In addition to synthesizing, evaluating, and reporting on what was known about the potential consequences of climate change, the report also sought to identify potential measures to adapt to climate change and to identify the highest research priorities for the future.

===Third National Climate Assessment (NCA3) 2014===
The Third National Climate Assessment report entitled &quot;Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States&quot; was delivered to the Federal Government for review in 2013 and became available to the public in May 2014.

The Third NCA report was written by more than 300 authors drawn from academia; local, state, tribal, and Federal governments; and the private and nonprofit sectors. The NCADAC selected these authors based on criteria that included expertise, experience, and ensuring a variety of perspectives.

After review by the NCADAC, the draft Third NCA report was released for public review and comment on January 14, 2013. By the time the public comment period closed on April 12, 2013, more than 4000 comments had been received from 644 government, non-profit, and commercial sector employees, educators, students, and the general public.

Concurrently, the National Research Council, part of the National Academy of Sciences, reviewed the draft and submitted feedback. The NCADAC produced a final draft of their report and provided it to the federal government for review in late fall of 2013; a final public version of the report was released on May 6, 2014. A number of derivative products, including a printed &quot;Highlights&quot; document, have been produced in addition to the full interactive electronic NCA document that is available on the web.

In preparation for the 2014 NCA, the USGCRP began in 2011 to call for wider participation and reinforced the long-term goal of improving climate literacy. Recruitment began in 2011 for NCAnet, a network of organizations working with the NCA, to further engage producers and users of assessment information across the United States. NCAnet was officially established and registered at the &quot;Federal Register&quot; on April 13, 2012.

===Fourth National Climate Assessment (NCA4) 2017/2018===

In Fourth National Climate Assessment (NCA4) Volume 1, released in October 2017, entitled &quot;Climate Science Special Report&quot; (CSSR), researchers reported that &quot;it is extremely likely that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, are the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century. For the warming over the last century, there is no convincing alternative explanation supported by the extent of the observational evidence.&quot; A 2018 CRS cited the October 2017 CSSR: &quot;Detection and attribution studies, climate models, observations, paleoclimate data, and physical understanding lead to high confidence (extremely likely) that more than half of the observed global mean warming since 1951 was caused by humans, and high confidence that internal climate variability played only a minor role (and possibly even a negative contribution) in the observed warming since 1951. The key message and supporting text summarizes extensive evidence documented in the peer-reviewed detection and attribution literature, including in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report.&quot; Volume 2 entitled &quot;Impacts, Risks, and Adaptation in the United States&quot; was released on November 23, 2018. According to Volume II, &quot;Without substantial and sustained global mitigation and regional adaptation efforts, climate change is expected to cause growing losses to American infrastructure and property and impede the rate of economic growth over this century.&quot; The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) was &quot;administrative lead agency&quot; in the preparation of the Fourth National Climate Assessment. According to NOAA, &quot;human health and safety&quot; and American &quot;quality of life&quot; is &quot;increasingly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change&quot;. The USGCRP team that produced the report included thirteen federal agencies— NOAA, the DOA, DOC, DOD, DOE, HHS, DOI, DOS, DOT, EPA, NASA, NSF, Smithsonian Institution, and the USAID—with the assistance of &quot;1,000 people, including 300 leading scientists, roughly half from outside the government.&quot;

==Global Change Information System==
The U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) has established the Global Change Information System (GCIS) to better coordinate and integrate the use of federal information products on changes in the global environment and the implications of those changes for society. The GCIS is an open-source, web-based resource for traceable, sound global change data, information, and products. Designed for use by scientists, decision makers, and the public, the GCIS provides coordinated links to a select group of information products produced, maintained, and disseminated by government agencies and organizations. As well as guiding users to global change research products selected by the 13 member agencies, the GCIS serves as a key access point to assessments, reports, and tools produced by the USGCRP. The GCIS is managed, integrated, and curated by USGCRP.

<doc id="352603" wikidata="Q321305" url="?curid=352603" title="Morgan le Fay">
<text>Morgan le Fay (; Welsh and Cornish: Morgen, alternatively known as Morgann]a, Morgaina/e], Morgante], Morga]ne, Morgayne], Morgeine], and Morguein] among other names and spellings, is a powerful and ambiguous enchantress from the legend of King Arthur, in which most often she and he are siblings. Early appearances of Morgan in Arthurian literature do not elaborate her character beyond her role as a goddess, a fay, a witch, or a sorceress, generally benevolent and connected to Arthur as his magical saviour and protector. Her prominence increased as the legend of Arthur developed over time, as did her moral ambivalence, and in some texts there is an evolutionary transformation of her to an antagonist, particularly as portrayed in cyclical prose such as the &quot;Lancelot-Grail&quot; and the Post-Vulgate Cycle. A significant aspect in many of Morgan&#x27;s medieval and later iterations is the unpredictable duality of her nature, with potential for both good and evil.

Her character may have originated from Welsh mythology as well as from other ancient and medieval myths and historical figures. The earliest documented account, by Geoffrey of Monmouth in (written ) refers to Morgan in association with the Isle of Apples (Avalon), to which Arthur was carried after having been fatally wounded at the Battle of Camlann, as the leader of the nine magical sisters unrelated to Arthur. Therein, and in the early chivalric romances by Chrétien de Troyes and others, Morgan&#x27;s chief role is that of a great healer. Several of numerous and often unnamed fairy-mistress and maiden-temptress characters found through the Arthurian romance genre may also be considered as appearances of Morgan in her different aspects.

Romance authors of the late 12th century established Morgan as Arthur&#x27;s supernatural elder sister. In the 13th-century prose cycles – and the later works based on them, including the influential &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; – she is usually described as the youngest daughter of Arthur&#x27;s mother Igraine and her first husband Gorlois. Arthur, son of Igraine and Uther Pendragon, is thus Morgan&#x27;s half-brother, and her full sisters include Mordred&#x27;s mother, the Queen of Orkney. The young Morgan unhappily marries Urien, with whom she has a son, Yvain. She becomes an apprentice of Merlin, and a capricious and vindictive adversary of some knights of the Round Table, all the while harbouring a special hatred for Arthur&#x27;s wife Guinevere. In this tradition, she is also sexually active and even predatory, taking numerous lovers that may include Merlin and Accolon, with an unrequited love for Lancelot. In some variants, including in the popular retelling by Malory, Morgan is the greatest enemy of Arthur, scheming to usurp his throne and indirectly becoming an instrument of his death. However, she eventually reconciles with Arthur, retaining her original role of taking him on his final journey to Avalon.

Many other medieval and Renaissance tales feature continuations from the aftermath of Camlann where Morgan appears as the immortal queen of Avalon in both Arthurian and non-Arthurian stories, sometimes alongside Arthur. After a period of being largely absent from contemporary culture, Morgan&#x27;s character again rose to prominence in the 20th and 21st centuries, appearing in a wide variety of roles and portrayals. Notably, her modern character is frequently being conflated with that of her sister, the Queen of Orkney, thus making Morgan the mother of Arthur&#x27;s son and nemesis Mordred.

==Etymology and origins==
The earliest spelling of the name (found in Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s , written c. 1150) is &quot;Morgen&quot;, which is likely derived from Old Welsh or Old Breton &quot;Morgen&quot;, meaning &#x27;sea-born&#x27; (from Common Brittonic &quot;*Mori-genā&quot;, the masculine form of which, &quot;*Mori-genos&quot;, survived in Middle Welsh as &quot;Moryen&quot; or &quot;Morien&quot;; a cognate form in Old Irish is &quot;Muirgen&quot;, the name of a Celtic Christian shapeshifting female saint who was associated with the sea). The name is not to be confused with the unrelated Modern Welsh masculine name Morgan (spelled &quot;Morcant&quot; in the Old Welsh period). As her epithet &quot;le Fay&quot; (a pseudo-French phrase coined up in the 15th century by Thomas Malory, who derived it from the original French descriptive form &quot;la fée&quot; &#x27;the fairy&#x27;; Malory would also use the form &quot;le Fey&quot; alternatively with &quot;le Fay&quot;) and some traits indicate, the figure of Morgan appears to have been a remnant of supernatural females from Celtic mythology, and her main name could be connected to the myths of Morgens (also known as Mari-Morgans or just Morgans), the Welsh and Breton fairy water spirits related to the legend of Princess Dahut (Ahes). Speculatively, beginning with Lucy Allen Paton in 1904, Morgan has been connected with the shapeshifting and multifaced Irish goddess of strife known as the Morrígan (&#x27;Great Queen&#x27;). Proponents of this theory have included Roger Sherman Loomis, who doubted the Muirgen connection. 

Further early inspiration for her figure likely came from other Welsh folklore, as well as possibly other works of medieval Irish literature and hagiography, and perhaps historical figures such as Empress Matilda. One of the proposed candidates for the historical Arthur, Artuir mac Áedán, was recorded as having a sister named Maithgen (daughter of king Áedán mac Gabráin, a 6th-century king of Dál Riata), whose name also appears as that of a prophetic druid in the Irish legend of Saint Brigid of Kildare. Geoffrey&#x27;s description of Morgen and her sisters in the &quot;Vita Merlini&quot; closely resembles the story of the nine Gaulish priestesses of the isle of Sena (now Île de Sein) called &quot;Gallisenae&quot; (or &quot;Gallizenae&quot;), as described by the 1st-century Roman geographer Pomponius Mela, strongly suggesting that Pomponius&#x27; &quot;Description of the World&quot; (&quot;De situ orbis&quot;) was one of Geoffrey&#x27;s prime sources for at least his own, unique version. Also suggested have been possible influence by other magical women from the Irish mythology such as the mother of hero Fráech, and elements of the classical Greek mythology sorceresses or goddesses such as Circe and especially Medea — who, similar to Morgan, are often alternately benevolent and malicious. A chiefly Greek (instead of Celtic) construction Morgan in medieval romances is a relatively new theory by Carolyne Larrington.

Morgan has also been often linked with the supernatural mother Modron, derived from the continental mother goddess figure of Dea Matrona and featured in medieval Welsh literature. Modron appears in Welsh Triad 70 (&quot;Three Blessed Womb-Burdens of the Island of Britain&quot;) – in which her children by Urien are named Owain mab Urien (son) and Morfydd (daughter) – and a later folktale have recorded more fully in the manuscript Peniarth 147. A fictionalised version of the historical king Urien is usually Morgan le Fay&#x27;s husband in the variations of Arthurian legend informed by continental romances, wherein their son is named Yvain. Furthermore, the historical Urien had a treacherous ally named Morcant Bulc who plotted to assassinate him, much as Morgan attempts to kill Urien. Additionally, Modron is called &quot;daughter of Afallach&quot;, a Welsh ancestor figure also known as Avallach or Avalloc, whose name can also be interpreted as a noun meaning &#x27;a place of apples&#x27;; in the tale of Owain and Morfydd&#x27;s conception in Peniarth 147, Modron is called the &quot;daughter of the King of Annwn&quot;, a Celtic Otherworld. This evokes Avalon, the marvelous &quot;Isle of Apples&quot; with which Morgan has been associated since her earliest appearances, and the Irish legend of the otherworldly woman Niamh including the motif of apple in connection to Avalon-like Otherworld isle of Tír na nÓg (&quot;Land of Youth&quot;). As summarised by Will Hasty, &quot;while this is difficult to establish with certainty the relationship between female figures such as these in the Arthurian tradition and the otherworldly goddesses, sprites, and nymphs of Irish and Welsh myths (a relationship is assumed especially in the case of Morgan le Fay), both groups demonstrate similar ambivalent characteristics: they are by turns dangerous and desirable, implicated alternately in fighting, death, sexuality, and fertility.&quot;

While many works make Morgan specifically human, she almost always keeps her magical powers and often also her otherworldly if not divine attributes and qualities. Some medieval authors refer to her as a fairy queen or even outright a goddess (&quot;dea&quot;, &quot;déesse&quot;, &quot;gotinne&quot;). According to Gerald of Wales in his 12th-century &quot;De instructione principis&quot;, a noblewoman and close relative of King Arthur named Morganis carried the dead Arthur to her island of Avalon (identified by him as Glastonbury), where he was buried. Writing in the early 13th century in &quot;Speculum ecclesiae&quot;, Gerald also wrote that &quot;as a result, the fanciful Britons and their bards invented the legend that some kind of a fantastic goddess (&quot;dea quaedam phantastica&quot;) had removed Arthur&#x27;s body to the Isle of Avalon, so that she might cure his wounds there,&quot; for the purpose of enabling the possibility of King Arthur&#x27;s messianic return. In his encyclopaedic work, &quot;Otia Imperialia&quot;, written around the same time and with similar derision for this belief, Gervase of Tilbury calls her Morganda Fatata (Morganda the Fairy). Morgan retains her early role as Arthur&#x27;s legendary healer throughout later Arthurian tradition.

==Medieval and Renaissance literature==

===Geoffrey, Chrétien and other early authors===
Morgan first appears by name in , written by Norman-Welsh cleric Geoffrey of Monmouth. Purportedly an account of the life of Merlin, it elaborates some episodes from Geoffrey&#x27;s more famous earlier work, &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; (1136). In &quot;Historia&quot;, Geoffrey relates how King Arthur, gravely wounded by Mordred at the Battle of Camlann, is taken off to the blessed Isle of Apple Trees (Latin &quot;Insula Pomorum&quot;), Avalon, to be healed; Avalon (&quot;Ynys Afallach&quot; in the Welsh versions of &quot;Historia&quot;) is also mentioned as the place where Arthur&#x27;s sword Excalibur was forged. (Geoffrey&#x27;s Arthur does have a sister, whose name is Anna, but the possibility of her being a predecessor to Morgan is unknown.) In &quot;Vita Merlini&quot;, Geoffrey describes this island in more detail and names &quot;Morgen&quot; as the chief of the nine magical queen sisters who dwell there, ruling in their own right. Morgen agrees to take Arthur, delivered to her by Taliesin to have him revived. She and her sisters are capable of shapeshifting and flying, and (at least seemingly) use their powers only for good. Morgen is also said to be a learned mathematician and to have taught it and astronomy to her fellow nymph (&quot;nymphae&quot;) sisters, whose names are listed as Moronoe, Mazoe, Gliten, Glitonea, Gliton, Tyronoe, Thiten (&quot;Thitis&quot;), and Thiton (&quot;Thetis&quot;).

In the making of this arguably Virgin Mary-type character and her sisters, Geoffrey might have been influenced by the first-century Roman cartographer Pomponius Mela, who has described an oracle at the Île de Sein off the coast of Brittany and its nine virgin priestesses believed by the continental Celtic Gauls to have the power to cure disease and perform various other awesome magic, such as controlling the sea through incantations, foretelling the future, and changing themselves into any animal. In addition, according to a theory postulated by R. S. Loomis, it is possible that Geoffrey has not been the original inventor of Morgan, as character may have had already existed in Breton folklore in the hypothetical unrecorded oral stories that featured her as Arthur&#x27;s fairy saviour, or even also his fairy godmother (her earliest shared supernatural ability being able to traverse on or under water). Such stories being told by wandering storytellers (as credited by Gerald of Wales) would then influence multiple authors writing independently from each other, especially since &quot;Vita Merlini&quot; was a relatively little-known text.

Geoffrey&#x27;s description of Morgan is notably very similar to that in Benoît de Sainte-Maure&#x27;s epic poem &quot;Roman de Troie&quot; (c. 1155–1160), a story of the ancient Trojan War in which Morgan herself makes an unexplained appearance in this second known text featuring her. As Orvan the Fairy (&quot;Orva la fée&quot;, likely a corruption of a spelling such as &quot;*Morgua&quot; in the original-text), there she first lustfully loves the Trojan hero Hector and gifts him a wonderful horse, but then pursues him with hate after he rejects her. The abrupt way in which she is used suggests Benoît did expect his aristocratic audience to have been already familiar with her character. Another such ancient-times appearance of a Morgan character can be found in the much later &quot;Perceforest&quot; (1330s), within the fourth book which is set in Britain during Julius Caesar&#x27;s invasions, where the fairy Morgane lives in the isle of Zeeland and has learned her magic from Zephir. Here, she has a daughter named Morganette and an adoptive son named Passelion, who in turn have a son named Morgan, described as an ancestor of the Lady of the Lake.

In &quot;Jaufre&quot;, an early Occitan language Arthurian romance dated c. 1180, Morgan seems to appear, without being named other than introducing herself as the &quot;Fairy of Gibel&quot; (&quot;fada de Gibel&quot;; Gibel was the Arabic name of Sicily&#x27;s Mount Etna that is also occurring in an Italian version of the Avalon motif in some later works). Here, she is the ruler of an underground kingdom who takes the protagonist knight Jaufre (Griflet) through a fountain to gift him her magic ring of protection. In the romance poem &quot;Lanzelet&quot;, translated by the end of the 12th century by Ulrich von Zatzikhoven from a now-lost French text, the infant Lancelot is spirited away by a water fairy (&quot;merfeine&quot; in Old High German) and raised in her paradise island country of Meidelant (&#x27;Land of Maidens&#x27;). Ulrich&#x27;s unnamed fairy queen character might be also related to Geoffrey&#x27;s Morgen, as well as to the early Breton oral tradition of Morgan&#x27;s figure, especially as her son there is named Mabuz, similar to the name of Modron&#x27;s son Mabon ap Modron. In Layamon&#x27;s Middle English poem &quot;The Chronicle of Britain&quot; (c. 1215), Arthur was taken to Avalon by two women to be healed there by its most beautiful elfen () queen named Argante or Argane; it is possible her name had been originally &quot;Margan(te)&quot; before it was changed in manuscript transmission.

The 12th-century French poet Chrétien de Troyes already mentions her in his first romance, &quot;Erec and Enide&quot;, completed around 1170. In it, a love of Morgan (Morgue) is Guigomar (Guingomar, Guinguemar), the Lord of the Isle of Avalon and a nephew of King Arthur, a character derivative of Guigemar from the Breton lai &quot;Guigemar&quot; by Marie de France. Guingamor&#x27;s own lai links him to the beautiful magical entity known only as the &quot;fairy mistress&quot;, who was later identified by Thomas Chestre&#x27;s &quot;Sir Launfal&quot; as &quot;Dame Tryamour&quot;, the daughter of the King of the Celtic Otherworld who shares many characteristics with Chrétien&#x27;s Morgan. It was noted that even Chrétien&#x27; earliest mention of Morgan already shows an enmity between her and Queen Guinevere, and although Morgan is represented only in a benign role by Chrétien, she resides in a mysterious place known as the Vale Perilous (which some later authors would say she has created as a place of punishment for unfaithful knights). She is later mentioned in the same poem when Arthur provides the wounded hero Erec with a healing balm made by his sister Morgan. This episode affirms her early role as a healer, in addition to being one of the first instances of Morgan presented as Arthur&#x27;s sister. Healing remains Morgan&#x27;s chief ability, but Chrétien also hints at her potential to harm.

Chrétien again refers to Morgan as a great healer in his later romance &quot;Yvain, the Knight of the Lion&quot;, in an episode in which the Lady of Norison restores the maddened hero Yvain to his senses with a magical potion provided by Morgan the Wise (&quot;Morgue la sage&quot;). Morgan the Wise is female in Chrétien&#x27;s original, as well as in the Norse version &quot;Ivens saga&quot;, but male in the English &quot;Ywain and Gawain&quot;. While the fairy Modron is mother of Owain mab Urien in the Welsh myth, and Morgan would be assigned this role in the later literature, this first continental association between Yvain (the romances&#x27; version of Owain) and Morgan does not imply they are son and mother. The earliest mention of Morgan as Yvain&#x27;s mother is found in &quot;Tyolet&quot;, an early 13th-century Breton lai.

The Middle Welsh Arthurian tale &quot;Geraint son of Erbin&quot;, either based on Chrétien&#x27;s &quot;Erec and Enide&quot; or derived from a common source, mentions King Arthur&#x27;s chief physician named Morgan Tud. It is believed that this character, though considered a male in &quot;Gereint&quot;, may be derived from Morgan le Fay, though this has been a matter of debate among Arthurian scholars since the 19th century (the epithet Tud may be a Welsh or Breton cognate or borrowing of Old Irish &quot;tuath&quot;, &#x27;north, left&#x27;, &#x27;sinister, wicked&#x27;, also &#x27;fairy (fay), elf&#x27;). There, Morgan is called to treat Edern ap Nudd, Knight of the Sparrowhawk, following the latter&#x27;s defeat at the hands of his adversary Geraint, and is later called on by Arthur to treat Geraint himself. In the German version of &quot;Erec&quot;, the 12th-century knight and poet Hartmann von Aue has Erec healed by Guinevere with a special plaster that was given to Arthur by the king&#x27;s sister, the goddess (&quot;gotinne&quot;) Feimurgân (&quot;Fâmurgân&quot;, Fairy Murgan):

In writing that, Hartmann might have not been influenced by Chrétien, but rather by an earlier oral tradition from the stories of Breton bards. Hartmann also separated Arthur&#x27;s sister (that is Feimurgân) from the fairy mistress of the lord of Avalon (Chrétien&#x27;s Guigomar), who in his version is named Marguel. In the anonymous First Continuation of Chrétien&#x27;s &quot;Perceval, the Story of the Grail&quot;, the fairy lover of its variant of Guigomar (here as Guingamuer) is named Brangepart, and the two have a son Brangemuer who became the king of an otherworldly isle &quot;where no mortal lived&quot;. In the 13th-century romance &quot;Parzival&quot;, another German knight-poet Wolfram von Eschenbach inverted Hartmann&#x27;s Fâmurgân&#x27;s name to create that of Arthur&#x27;s fairy ancestor named Terdelaschoye de Feimurgân, the wife of Mazadân, where the part &quot;Terdelaschoye&quot; comes from &quot;Terre de la Joie&quot;, or Land of Joy; the text also mentions the mountain of Fâmorgân. Jean Markale further identified a Morganian figure in Wolfram&#x27;s ambiguous character of Cundrie the Sorceress (later better known as Kundry) through her plot function as mistress of illusions in an enchanted fairy garden.

Speculatively, Loomis and John Matthews further identified other perceived avatars of Morgan as the &quot;Besieged Lady&quot; archetype in various early works associated with the Castle of Maidens motif, often appearing as (usually unnamed) wife of King Lot and mother of Gawain. These characters include the Queen of Meidenlant in &quot;Diu Crône&quot;, the lady of Castellum Puellarum in &quot;De Ortu Waluuanii&quot;, and the nameless heroine of the Breton lai &quot;Doon&quot;, among others, including some in later works (such as with Lady Lufamore of Maydenlande in &quot;Sir Perceval of Galles&quot;). Loomis also linked her to the eponymous seductress evil queen from &quot;The Queen of Scotland&quot;, a 19th-century ballad &quot;containing Arthurian material dating back to the year 1200.&quot;

A recently discovered moralistic manuscript written in Anglo-Norman French is the only known instance of medieval Arthurian literature presented as being composed by Morgan herself. This late 12th-century text is purportedly addressed to her court official and tells of the story of a knight called Piers the Fierce; it is likely that the author&#x27;s motive was to draw a satirical moral from the downfall of the English knight Piers Gaveston, 1st Earl of Cornwall. Morgayne is titled in it as &quot;empress of the wilderness, queen of the damsels, lady of the isles, and governor of the waves of the great sea.&quot; Morgan (&quot;Morganis&quot;) is also mentioned in the &quot;Draco Normannicus&quot;, a 12th-century (c. 1167–1169) Latin chronicle by Étienne de Rouen, which contains a fictitious letter addressed by King Arthur to Henry II of England, written for political propaganda purpose of having &#x27;Arthur&#x27; criticise King Henry for invading the Duchy of Brittany. Notably, it is one of the first known texts that made her a sister to Arthur, as she is in the works of Chrétien and many others after him. As described by Étienne,

===French prose cycles===
Morgan&#x27;s role was greatly expanded by the unknown authors of the early-13th-century Old French prose romances of the Vulgate Cycle, also known as the Lancelot-Grail cycle, and its subsequent rewrite, the Prose &quot;Tristan&quot;-influenced Post-Vulgate Cycle. (Both of these cycles are believed to be at least influenced by the Cistercian religious order, which might explain the texts&#x27; demonisation of pagan motifs and increasingly anti-sexual attitudes, altrough some of these attitudes may be arguably shared with the pre-Christian source material.) Integrating her figure fully into the Arthurian world, they also portray Morgan&#x27;s ways and deeds as being much more sinister and aggressive than they are in Geoffrey or Chrétien, showing her undergoing a series of transformations in the process of becoming a much more chaotic and unpredictable character. Beginning as an erratic ally of Arthur and a notorious temptress opposed to his wife and some of his knights (especially Lancelot, doubling as her unrequited love interest) in the original stories of the Vulgate Cycle, Morgan&#x27;s figure eventually often turns into an ambitious and depraved nemesis of King Arthur himself in the Post-Vulgate stories.

A common image of Morgan becomes a malicious, jealous and cruel sorceress, the source of many intrigues at the royal court of Arthur and elsewhere. In some of the later works, she is also subversively working to take over Arthur&#x27;s throne through her mostly harmful magic and scheming, including manipulating men. Most of the time, Morgan&#x27;s magic arts correspond with these of Merlin&#x27;s and the Lady of the Lake&#x27;s, featuring shapeshifting, illusion, and sleeping spells (Richard Kieckhefer connected it with Norse magic). Some scholars even see the figure of the Lady (or Ladies) of the Lake as Morgan&#x27;s split-off literary double serving as a &quot;benevolent anti-Morgan&quot;, especially in the Post-Vulgate tradition: a largely (but not entirely) opposite character created using Morgan&#x27;s copied traits. Although Morgan is usually depicted in medieval romances as beautiful and seductive, the medieval archetype of the loathly lady is used frequently, as Morgan can be in a contradictory fashion described as both beautiful and ugly even within the same narration.

====Family and upbringing====
This version of Morgan (usually named &quot;Morgane&quot;, &quot;Morgain&quot; or &quot;Morgue&quot;) first appears in the few surviving verses of the Old French poem &quot;Merlin&quot;, which later served as the original source for the Vulgate Cycle and consequently also the Post-Vulgate Cycle. It was written c. 1200 by the French knight-poet Robert de Boron, who described her as an illegitimate daughter of Lady Igraine with an initially unnamed Duke of Tintagel, after whose death she is adopted by King Neutres of Garlot. &quot;Merlin&quot; is the first known work linking Morgan to Igraine and mentioning her learning sorcery after having been sent away for an education. The reader is informed that Morgan was given her moniker &#x27;la fée&#x27; (&quot;the fairy&quot;) due to her great knowledge. A 14th-century massive prequel to the Arthurian legend, &quot;Perceforest&quot;, also implies that Arthur&#x27;s sister was later named after its &quot;fée&quot; character Morgane from several centuries earlier. In the &quot;Huth-Merlin&quot; version of &quot;Merlin&quot;, Morgain and Morgue la fee are introduced as two different half-sisters of Arthur who then become merged into one character later in the text.

In a popular tradition, Morgan is the youngest of the daughters of Igraine and her husband, a Duke of Cornwall (or Tintagel) who today best known as Gorlois. Her father dies in battle with the army of the British high king Uther Pendragon in a war over his wife (Morgan&#x27;s mother) at the same moment as when Arthur is conceived by Uther, who infiltrates Tintagel Castle with the half-demon Merlin&#x27;s magic aid. In the poem&#x27;s prose version and its continuations, she has at least two elder sisters. Various manuscripts list up to five sisters or half-sisters of Arthur, sometimes from different fathers, and some do not mention Morgan being a bastard (step)child. In the best-known version, her sisters are Elaine (&quot;Blasine&quot;) and the Queen of Orkney sometimes known as Morgause, the latter of whom is the mother of Arthur&#x27;s knights Gawain, Agravain, Gaheris and Gareth by King Lot, and the traitor Mordred by Arthur (in some romances the wife of King Lot is called Morcades, a name that R. S. Loomis argued was another name of Morgan). At a young age, Morgan is sent to a convent after Arthur&#x27;s father Uther marries her mother, who later gives him a son, Arthur (which makes him Morgan&#x27;s younger half-brother). There, Morgan masters the seven arts and begins her study of magic, going on to specialise in &quot;astronomie&quot; (astronomy and astrology) and healing; the Prose &quot;Merlin&quot; describes her as &quot;wonderfully adept&quot; and &quot;working hard all the time.&quot; The Vulgate &quot;Suite du Merlin&quot; narration describes Morgan&#x27;s unmatched beauty and her various skills and qualities of character:

====Schism with Guinevere and Arthur====
Uther (or Arthur himself in the Post-Vulgate) betroths her to his ally, King Urien of Gorre (&quot;Gore&quot;), the realm described as an Otherworldly northern British kingdom, possibly the historical Rheged (early versions have alternatively named Morgan&#x27;s husband as Nentres of Garlot, who later was recast as the husband of her sister Elaine). Now a queen but unhappy with her husband, Morgan serves as a lady-in-waiting for the high queen, Arthur&#x27;s newly married young wife Guinevere. At first, Morgan and the also young Guinevere are close friends, even wearing shared near-identical rings. However, everything changes when Morgan is caught in an affair with her lover Guiomar (derived from Chrétien&#x27;s Guigomar) by Guinevere. Usually, Guiomar is depicted as Guinevere&#x27;s cousin (alternatively, appearing there as Gaimar, he is Guinevere&#x27;s early lover instead of her relative in the German version &quot;Lancelot und Ginevra&quot;). The high queen intervenes to break their relationship to prevent the loss of honor (according to some scholarship, possibly also because of Guinevere&#x27;s perception of Morgan, with her kinship and close relationship with Arthur, as a rival in political power). This incident, introduced in the Prose &quot;Merlin&quot; and expanded in the Vulgate &quot;Lancelot&quot; and the Post-Vulgate &quot;Suite du Merlin&quot; (the Huth &quot;Merlin&quot;), begins a lifelong feud between Guinevere and Morgan, who leaves the court of Camelot with all her wealth to seek out Merlin and greater powers. The pregnant Morgan later gives birth to Guiomar&#x27;s son, who is not named in the story but is said to grow up to become a great knight.

Morgan then either undertakes or continues her studies of dark magic under Merlin, enamored for her, the details of which vary widely depending on the telling. In the Prose &quot;Merlin&quot;, for instance, it is Morgan who finds Merlin, whom she &quot;loves passionately&quot;. In the &quot;Livre d&#x27;Artus&quot;, where Morgan&#x27;s first lover is a knight named Bertolais, it is rather Merlin who goes to live with Morgan and her two ladies for a long time following the betrayal of him by Niniane (the Lady of the Lake) with her other lover, just as Morgan wished for him to do. In the Post-Vulgate &quot;Suite&quot;, Morgan had been tutored by Merlin even before her relationship with Guiomar, and later she returns to learn more. They meet at Lot&#x27;s funeral, during the time when Morgan is pregnant with Yvain. After Merlin teaches her so much she becomes &quot;the wisest woman in the world&quot;, Morgan scorns and drives Merlin away by threatening to torture and kill him if he would not leave her alone, which causes him great sorrow out of his &quot;foolish love&quot; (&quot;fol amor&quot;) for her. In the Vulgate &quot;Lancelot&quot;, Morgan learns all her magic only from Merlin (and not in the nunnery). In any case, having finished her studies under Merlin, Morgan begins scheming her vengeance as she tries to undermine virtue and achieve Guinevere&#x27;s downfall whenever she can.

While Morgan&#x27;s antagonistic actions in the Vulgate Cycle have been motivated by her &quot;great hatred&quot; (&quot;grant hayne&quot;) toward Guinevere, in the Post-Vulgate Cycle, where Morgan&#x27;s explicitly evil nature is directly stated and accented, she also works to destroy Arthur&#x27;s rule and end his life. The most famous and important of these machinations is introduced in the Post-Vulgate &quot;Suite&quot;, where she arranges for her devoted lover Accolon to obtain the enchanted sword Excalibur as well as its protective scabbard, which has been previously confided to Morgan by Arthur himself as he had trusted her even more than his wife, replacing the real ones with fakes. In a conspiracy with the villainous lord Damas, Morgan plans for Accolon to use Arthur&#x27;s own magic items against him in single combat, so she and her beloved Accolon would become the rulers. As part of her convoluted plan, both Arthur and Accolon are spirited away from their hunt with Urien by a magical boat of twelve damsels. Confident of her coming victory, Morgan also attempts to murder her sleeping husband Urien with his own sword, but in this act she is stopped by their son Yvain (&quot;Uwayne&quot;), who pardons her when she protests she has been under the devil&#x27;s power and promises to abandon her wicked ways. After Arthur nevertheless mortally defeats Accolon in a duel arranged by Morgan, her former mentor Merlin, still having feelings for her, saves her from Arthur&#x27;s wrath by enabling her to escape. To avenge Accolon&#x27;s death, which caused her great sorrow, Morgan again steals the scabbard from the sleeping king. Pursued by Arthur for her betrayal, Morgan throws the scabbard into a lake, before temporarily turning herself and her entourage to stone, the sight of which makes Arthur think they have been already punished by God. That action of Morgan ultimately causes the death of Arthur, who would otherwise be protected by the scabbard&#x27;s magic in his final battle. On her way out, Morgan saves Arthur&#x27;s knight named Manassen (&quot;Manessen&quot;) from certain death when she learns Accolon was Manessen&#x27;s cousin and enables him to kill his captor.

In the same narrative, having been banished from Camelot, Morgan then retires to her lands in the magical kingdom of Gorre and then to her castle near the stronghold of Tauroc (possibly in North Wales). However, her treacherous attempts to bring about Arthur&#x27;s demise in the &quot;Suite&quot; are repeatedly frustrated by the king&#x27;s new sorceress advisor Ninianne (the Lady of the Lake). An iconic case of Morgan&#x27;s such further and very underhanded plots to kill Arthur in the Post-Vulgate occurs when Morgan sends him a supposed offering of peace in the form of a rich mantle cloak, but Morgan&#x27;s messenger maiden is made put on the gift first by Ninianne&#x27;a advice to Arthur, for &quot;if she dies of it, Morgan will be angrier than at anything else that could happen to her, for she loves her with a very great love.&quot; The girl indeed falls dead, and Arthur has her body burned. It is possible that this motif was inspired by classical stories like that how Medea killed her rival for Jason&#x27;s affection or how Deianira sent a poisoned tunic to Hercules. The reasons for Morgan&#x27;s hatred of her brother in the Post-Vulgate narrative are never fully explained, other than by just a &quot;natural&quot; extreme antipathy against goodness by the evil that she is an embodiment of.

====Lancelot, Tristan and other knights====
Morgan is often emphasised as promiscuous, even more than her sister Morgause, as she is &quot;so lustful and wanton that a looser [noble]woman could not have been found.&quot; In some versions, she also associates with two other lascivious enchantresses, Queen Sebile (&quot;Sedile&quot;) and the unnamed Queen of Sorestan. Together, the three &quot;knew so much about magic, they enjoyed one another&#x27;s company and always rode together and ate and drank together.&quot; Sebile and Morgan are particularly close companions, working their magic together, but they tend to fall into petty squabbles due to their rivalries and bad tempers, including a conflict between them when they both seduce Hector de Maris in the late 13th-century &quot;Prophéties de Merlin&quot;. Their friendship is further tested when a quarrel over a handsome widower named Berengier (captured by Sebile after Morgan kidnapped his child) ends in a violent attack by Sebile that leaves Morgan half-dead; Morgan swears revenge, but their relationship is later restored. After Merlin&#x27;s entombment by the Lady of the Lake, Morgan and her three enchantresses also try to find and rescue him but they fail in that task. Morgan&#x27;s other allies in the &quot;Prophéties&quot; include the opponents of chivalry such as Mark and Claudas, and she enlists the help of the latter in her failed attempt to eliminate the Lady of the Lake.

Morgan uses her skills in her dealings, amorous or otherwise, with several of Arthur&#x27;s Knights of the Round Table. It applies in particular to the greatest of them all, Lancelot, whom she alternately tries to seduce and to expose as Guinevere&#x27;s adulterous lover. Her magic aside, Lancelot is always disempowered in his dealings with Morgan as he could never hurt a woman, which, coupled with her being his king&#x27;s kin, made the Vulgate&#x27;s Morgan a perfect foil for Lancelot as &quot;the woman he most feared in the world.&quot; As told in the Prose &quot;Lancelot&quot;, they first meet in her magical domain known as the Val sans Retour (the Vale of No Return), serving as an enchanted prison for false lovers since she took an unnamed knight as her lover but then discovered his affair with another woman. There, Lancelot frees the 250 unfaithful knights entrapped by Morgan, including her former lover Guiomar whom she has turned to stone for his infidelity, but Morgan then captures Lancelot himself under her spell, using a magic ring and keeps him prisoner in the hope Guinevere would then go mad or die of sorrow. She also otherwise torments Guinevere, causing her great distress and making her miserable until the Lady of the Lake gives her a ring that protects her from Morgan&#x27;s power. Since then, Lancelot becomes Morgan&#x27;s prime object of sexual desire but he consistently refuses her obsessive advances due to his great love of Guinevere, even as Morgan repeatedly courts, drugs, enchants or imprisons the knight. Their one-sided relationship (as well as interactions between her and Arthur) may evoke that of the goddess Morrígan and the Celtic hero Cú Chulainn. One time, she lets the captive Lancelot go to rescue Gawain when he promises to come back (but also keeping him the company of the most beautiful of her maidens to do &quot;whatever she could to entice him&quot;), and he keeps his word and does return; she eventually releases him altogether after over a year, when his health falters and he is near death. On another occasion, Lancelot captured in Cart Castle (&quot;Charyot&quot;) by Morgan and her fellow magical queens, each of whom tries to make Lancelot her lover; he refuses to choose either of them and escapes with the help of one of their maidservants, Rocedon. 

Another of Morgan&#x27;s illicit love subjects is the rescued-but-abducted young Cornish knight Alexander the Orphan (&quot;Alisaunder le Orphelin&quot;), a cousin of Tristan and Mark&#x27;s enemy from a later addition in the Prose &quot;Tristan&quot; as well as the &quot;Prophéties de Merlin&quot;, whom she promises to heal but he vows to castrate himself rather than to pleasure her. Nevertheless, Alexander promises to defend her castle of Fair Guard (&quot;Belle Garde&quot;), where he has been held, for a year and a day, and then dutifully continues to guard it even after the castle gets burned down; this eventually leads to his death. Morgan&#x27;s other fancied good knights include Alexander&#x27;s relative Tristan, but her interest in him turns into burning hatred of him and his true love Isolde after he kills her lover as introduced in the Prose &quot;Tristan&quot;. In this story, Morgan&#x27;s paramours include Huneson the Bald (&quot;Hemison&quot; in Malory&#x27;s version) who is mortally wounded when he attacks the great Cornish knight out of his jealously for her attention; the knight soon dies after returning to her, and the anguished Morgan buries him in a grand tomb. In one variation, Morgan then takes revenge as she takes possession of the lance that was used to kill Huneson, enchants it, and sends it to King Mark of Cornwall, her possible lover, who years later uses it to slay Tristan.

In the Prose &quot;Tristan&quot;, wherein Morgan presents herself as Arthur&#x27;s full sister, she delivers by Lamorak to Arthur&#x27;s court a magical drinking horn from which no unfaithful lady can drink without spilling, hoping to disgrace Guinevere by revealing her infidelity, but it is Isolde whose adultery is disclosed instead. With same intent, when Tristan was to be Morgan&#x27;s champion at a jousting tournament, she also gives him an enchanted shield depicting Arthur, Guinevere and Lancelot to deliver to Camelot in the Prose &quot;Tristan&quot;. In the Vulgate &quot;Queste&quot;, after Morgan hosts her nephews Gawain, Mordred and Gaheriet to heal them, Mordred spots the images of Lancelot&#x27;s passionate love for Guinevere that Lancelot painted on her castle&#x27;s walls while he was imprisoned there. Morgan shows it to Gawain and his brothers, encouraging them to take action in the name of loyalty to their king, but they decide not to do this.

====Later years and Avalon====
It is said that Morgan concentrates on witchcraft to such degree that she goes to live in seclusion in the exile of far-away forests. She learns more spells than any other woman, gains an ability to transform herself into any animal, and people begin to call her Morgan the Goddess (&quot;Morgain-la-déesse&quot;, &quot;Morgue la dieuesse&quot;). In the Post-Vulgate version of &quot;Queste del Saint Graal&quot;, Lancelot has a vision of Hell where Morgan still will be able to control demons even in afterlife as they torture Guinevere. In one of her castles, Tugan in Garlot, Morgan has hidden a magic book given to her by Merlin, which actually prophesied the deaths of Arthur and Gawain and who would kill them, but no one can read this passage without dying instantly. In the Vulgate &quot;La Mort le Roi Artu&quot; (&quot;The Death of King Arthur&quot;, also known as just the &quot;Mort Artu&quot;), Morgan ceases troubling Arthur and vanishes for a long time, and the king assumes her to be dead. One day, he and Sagramor wander into Morgan&#x27;s incredibly beautiful castle while lost in a forest, where Arthur is received extremely well and instantly reconciles with his sister. Overjoyed with their reunion, the king allows Morgan to return to Camelot, but she refuses and declares her plan to move to the Isle of Avalon, &quot;where the women live who know all the world&#x27;s magic,&quot; so she can dwell there with these (unspecified) other sorceresses.

However, disaster strikes Arthur when the sight of Lancelot&#x27;s frescoes and Morgan&#x27;s confession finally convinces him about the truth to the rumours of the two&#x27;s secret love affair (about which he has been already warned by his nephew Agravain). This leads to a great conflict between Arthur and Lancelot, which brings down the fellowship of the Round Table. At the end of the Vulgate &quot;Mort Artu&quot;, Morgan is the only one who is recognised among the black-hooded ladies who take the dying Arthur to his final rest and possible revival in Avalon. Depending on the manuscript, she is either the leading lady (usually, being recognised by Griflet as the one holding Arthur&#x27;s hand as he enters the boat), a subordinate to another who is unnamed, or neither of them are superior. The latter part of the Post-Vulgate versions of &quot;Queste&quot; and &quot;Mort&quot; both seem to revert to Morgan&#x27;s friendly attitude toward Arthur from the end of the Vulgate Cycle, despite the Post-Vulgate&#x27; own characterisation of Morgan as thoroughly evil and the earlier fierce hostility between them. As Arthur steps into her boat after Camlann but assures he is not going to return, she makes no mention of Avalon or her intentions when taking him away. His supposed grave is later said to be found mysteriously empty but for his helmet. (Spanish poem &quot;La Faula&quot; has Morgan explain that by saying the tomb&#x27;s purpose was to prevent knights from searching for Arthur.)

=== Malory and other medieval English authors ===
Middle English writer Thomas Malory follows Morgan&#x27;s portrayals from the Old French prose cycles in his late-15th-century seminal work of the selective compilation book &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; (&quot;The Death of Arthur&quot;), though he reduces her in role and detail of characterisation, in particular either removing or limiting her traditions of healing and prophecy, and making her more consistently and inherently evil than she is in most of his sources, just as he makes Merlin more good. He also diminishes Morgan&#x27;s conflict with Guinevere, since there is no mention of Guiomar and instead Accolon (&quot;of Gaul&quot;) is her first named lover in a much abbreviated version of his story, but does not clarify Morgan&#x27;s motivations for her very antagonistic behaviour against Arthur. Overall, up until the war between Arthur and Lancelot and the rebellion of Mordred, it is the evil and chaotic Morgan who remains the main and constant source of direct and indirect threat to the realm. 

In Malory&#x27;s backstory, Morgan has studied astrology as well as &quot;nigremancie&quot; (which might actually mean black magic in general rather than &quot;necromancy&quot;) in the nunnery where she was raised, before being married to Urien (&quot;Uriens&quot;) as a young teenager; in this narrative she did not study with Merlin. Unlike Malory&#x27;s good sorceress Nimue, Morgan deals mostly in &quot;black&quot; rather than &quot;white&quot; magic, employed usually through enchantments and potions. Her powers, however, seem to be inspired by fairy magic of Celtic folklore rather than by medieval Christian demonology. Morgan is widely feared and hated, so much that &quot;many knights wished her burnt.&quot; She is now the leader of the four (not three) witch queens who capture Lancelot (the others being the Queen of the Northgales, the Queen of Eastland, and the Queen of the Outer Isles). In an episode that had been first introduced by the anonymous writer of the earlier Prose &quot;Lancelot&quot;, Lancelot rescues Elaine of Corbenic from being trapped in an enchanted boiling bath by Morgan and the Queen of the Northgales, both envious of Elaine&#x27;s great beauty (echoing Circe&#x27;s treatment of Scylla). Malory also reused the magic mantle assassination plot from the Huth &quot;Merlin&quot; in a slightly modified form, resulting in Morgan&#x27;s damsel instantly burnt to cinders by its curse when she is forced to take it on. In one of later episodes, Morgan plots an elaborate ambush in &quot;The Book of Sir Tristram de Lyons&quot;, after learning of the death of one of her favourites in a tournament, but Tristan ends up killing or routing thirty of her knights. Malory mentions Arthur&#x27;s attempts to conquer at least one of her castles, which originally had been his own gift to her, and which he could not retake (apparently due to magical defences). Nevertheless, despite all of their prior hostility towards each other and her numerous designs directed against Arthur personally (and his own promise to get a terrible revenge on her as long as he lives), she is still redeemed and is one of the four grieving enchantress queens (the others being Nimue, marking the end of conflict between her and Morgan, and two of Morgan&#x27;s allies, the Queen of the Northgales and the Queen of the Wasteland) who arrive in a black boat to transport the wounded king to Avalon in the end. Unlike in the French and earlier stories on which &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; is based, and where Morgan and Arthur usually would either have first made peace or have just never fought to begin with, here her change of attitude towards him is sudden and unexplained (similar to the Post-Vulgate). Arthur is last seen in Morgan&#x27;s lap, with her lament of sorrow referring to him as her &quot;dear brother&quot; (&quot;dere brothir&quot;), as they disappear from the work&#x27;s narrative together.

In the c. 1400 English poem Alliterative &quot;Morte Arthure&quot;, Morgan appears in Arthur&#x27;s dream as Lady Fortune (that is, the goddess Fortuna) with the Wheel of Fortune to warn Arthur prior to his fatal final battle, foretelling his death. She also appears in some other English texts, such as the early-13th-century Anglo-Norman &quot;Roman de Waldef&quot; where she is only &quot;name-dropped&quot; as a minor character. Middle English romance &quot;Arthour and Merlin&quot;, written around 1270, casts a villainous Morgan in the role of the Lady of the Lake and gives her a brother named Morganor as an illegitimate son of King Urien; her wondrous castle Palaus is built mostly of crystal and glass. Conversely, a 14th-century Middle English version of the Vulgate &quot;Mort Artu&quot; known as the Stanzaic &quot;Morte Arthur&quot; makes Morgan an unquestionably good sister of Arthur, concerned only about his honour in regard to the affair of Lancelot and Guinevere. Entering her boat (she is not named in the scene, but addresses him as her brother), Arthur believes he is going to be healed, yet his tomb is later discovered by Bedivere.

At the end of the 14th-century Middle English romance &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;, one of the best-known Arthurian tales, it is revealed that the entire Green Knight plot has been instigated by Gawain&#x27;s aunt, the goddess Morgan le Fay (&quot;Morgue la Faye&quot;, &quot;Morgne þe goddes&quot;), whose prior mentorship by Merlin is mentioned. Here, she is an ambiguous trickster who takes an appearance of an elderly woman (contrasting from the beautiful Lady Bertilak in a role evoking the loathly lady tradition), as a test for Arthur and his knights and to frighten Guinevere to death. Morgan&#x27;s importance to this particular narrative has been disputed and called a &quot;deus ex machina&quot; and simply an artistic device to further connect Gawain&#x27;s episode to the Arthurian legend, but some regard her as a central character and the driving force of the plot. Opinions are also divided regarding Morgan&#x27;s intentions and whether she succeeds or fails, and how the story&#x27;s shapeshifting and enigmatic Morgan might be, or might be not, also Lady Bertilak herself.

===Other later portrayals in various countries===
Morgan further turns up frequently throughout the Western European literature of the High and Late Middle Ages, as well as of the Renaissance. She appears in a variety of roles, generally appearing in works related to the literary cycles of Arthur (the Matter of Britain) or Charlemagne (the Matter of France) and written mostly in various Romance languages and dialects, especially still in France but also in Italy, Spain and elsewhere. In the case of Spain, even public edicts dating from the end of the 14th and the beginning of the 15th century tell of the belief in Morgan continuing to enchant and imprison people at Tintagel and in &quot;the Valley of False Trickery&quot;. 

Later standalone romances often feature Morgan as a lover and benefactor of various heroes, and yet she can also be their opponent, especially when abducting those who turned down her amorous offers or working to separate true lovers. Such texts may also introduce her additional offspring or alternate siblings, or connect her closer with the figure of the Lady of the Lake. For instance, the fairy queen Lady Morgan (&quot;Dame Morgue&quot;, &quot;Morgue li fee&quot;) shows up in Adam de la Halle&#x27;s late-13th-century French farce &quot;Jeu de la feuillée&quot;, in which she visits a contemporary Arras. She arrives accompanied by two of her fay sisters named Arsile and Maglore to dispense enchantment gifts to and curses upon several characters including the author himself, and in the course of the story reverts her love interest in the local mortal (and unfaithful) knight Robert to her previous lover Hellequin (&quot;Hellekin&quot;), a demonic prince of Faerie who has been trying to woo her back. Hellequin&#x27;s character in this case may be connected in some way to Arthur, who like him sometimes also figures as the leader of the Wild Hunt. In Thomas III of Saluzzo&#x27;s &quot;Le Chevalier Errant&quot;, the fairy Morgan (&quot;la fée Morgane&quot;) holds the eponymous Wandering Knight captive inside a magnificent castle in her forest realm Païenie (&#x27;Pagania&#x27;), until messengers from her brother Arthur arrive with a request to lift her enchantment and let him go, to which she agrees. Loosely drawing from the Vulgate Cycle, the Old French anonymous &quot;Li Romans de Claris et Laris&quot; better known as just &quot;Claris and Laris&quot; (c. 1270), has its Morgan (&quot;Morgane la Faye&quot;) as a fairy sister of Arthur as well as a former pupil of the Lady of Lake, Viviane. Ever lascivious and sexual, Morgan lives in a splendid enchanted castle in the wilderness (identified as Brocéliande in a later manuscript) with twelve other beautiful fairy ladies including the sorceress Madoine. There, they lure and ensnare many hundreds of young and attractive knights, who then spend the rest of their lives in the palace:

A human Morgan is named Dioneta in the 14th-century Welsh fragment known as &quot;The Birth of Arthur&quot;, where she is a sister of both Gwyar (Morgause) and Gwalchmei (Gawain), as well as of the other sisters Gracia and Graeria, and is sent off by Uther to Avallach (Avalon). The island of Avalon is often described as an otherworldly place ruled by Morgan in other later texts from all over Western Europe, especially these written in Iberia. In the 14th-century French Crusadic fantasy &quot;Le Bâtard de Bouillon&quot;, the island kingdom of Arthur and his fairy sister Morgan the Beautiful is hidden by a cloud in the Red Sea, where it is visited by King Bauduins (Baldwin II of Jerusalem). In his 14th-century Catalan poem &quot;La faula&quot;, Guillem de Torroella writes about having visited the Enchanted Isle and met Arthur who has been brought back to life by the fay Morgan (&quot;Morgan la feya&quot;, &quot;Morguan la fea&quot;) and they both are now forever young due to the power of the Holy Grail. In the 15th-century Valencian romance &quot;Tirant lo Blanc&quot;, the noble Queen Morgan searches the world for her missing brother. Finally finding him entranced in Constantinople, Morgan brings Arthur back to his senses by removing Excalibur from his hands, after which they celebrate and leave to Avalon. The Castilian &quot;Arderique&quot; begins where the &quot;Mort Artu&quot; ends, that is with the departure and disappearance of Arthur and his sister Morgaina, described there as a fairy necromancer, after the battle with Mordred. Another Spanish work, Francisco de Enciso Zárate&#x27;s &quot;Florambel de Lucea&quot; (1532), features a later appearance of Arthur together with his sister Morgaina, &quot;better known as Morgana the fairy&quot; (&quot;fada Morgana&quot;), who explains how she saved her brother and gifts Excalibur to the eponymous hero Florambel. In &quot;Tristán de Leonis&quot;, Morgana offers her love to Tristan. In the &quot;rondalla&quot; (&#x27;folk tale&#x27; in Catalan) &quot;La fada Morgana&quot;, the protagonist Joana ends up marrying the fairy queen Morgana&#x27;s son named Beuteusell after passing his mother&#x27;s test with his help.

In the legend of the Paladins of Charlemagne, she is most associated with one of the Paladins, the Danish folklore hero Ogier the Dane: following his initial epics, when he is 100 years old, the fairy queen Morgan restores him to his youthful form but removes his memory, then takes him to her mystical island palace in Avalon (where Arthur and Gawain are also still alive) to be her lover for 200 years. She later protects him during his adventures in the mortal world as he defends France from Muslim invasion, before his eventual return to Avalon. In some accounts, Ogier begets her two sons, including Marlyn (&quot;Meurvin&quot;). In the 14th-century pseudo-chronicle &quot;Ly Myreur des Histors&quot; written by the French-Belgian author Jean d&#x27;Outremeuse, one of their sons is a giant and they live in a palace made of jewels. In the 13th-century &quot;chanson de geste&quot; story of another Paladin, Huon of Bordeaux, Morgan is a protector of the eponymous hero and the mother of the fairy king Oberon by none other than Julius Caesar. In the 14th-century &quot;Ogier le Danois&quot;, a prose redaction of the epic poem &quot;Roman d&#x27;Ogier&quot;, Morgue la Fée lives in her palace in Avalon together with Arthur and Oberon, who both seem to be her brothers. Variants of Ogier&#x27;s and Huon&#x27;s stories typically involve Morgan, Arthur, and Oberon (&quot;Auberon&quot;) all living in a fairyland where time passes much slower than in human world. Such works include the 14th century&#x27;s French &quot;Tristan de Nanteuil&quot; and the &quot;Chanson de Lion de Bourges&quot;, the 15th-century French &quot;Mabrien&quot;, and John Bourchier&#x27;s 16th-century English &quot;The Boke of Duke Huon of Burdeux&quot; in which Arthur&#x27;s sister Morgan is mother of not Oberon but Merlin. In another French &quot;chanson de geste&quot;, the early-13th-century &quot;La Bataille Loquifer&quot;, the fays Morgan (&quot;Morgue&quot;) and her sister Marsion (&quot;Marrion&quot;) bring the Saracen hero Renoart (&quot;Renouart&quot;, &quot;Rainouart&quot;) to Avalon, where Arthur is the king. Renoart falls in love with Morgan and impregnates her with his illegitimate son named Corbon (&quot;Corbans&quot;), &quot;a live devil who did nothing but evil.&quot; When Renoart jilts her and escapes to rescue his other son Maileffer, Morgan sends her demonic monster servant Kapalu (character derived from the Welsh legends&#x27; Cath Palug) after him; the shipwrecked Renoart ends up luckily rescued by a mermaid.

The 14th-century Italian romance titled &quot;La Pulzella Gaia&quot; (&quot;The Merry Maiden&quot;) features the titular beautiful young fairy daughter of Morgana (Italian version of Morgan&#x27;s name, here too also a sister of the Lady of the Lake) with Hemison. In her own tale, Morgana&#x27;s daughter defeats Gawain (&quot;Galvano&quot;) in her giant serpent form before becoming his lover; she and her fairy army then save Gawain from the jealous Guinevere, who wants Gawain dead after having been spurned by him. She then herself is imprisoned in a magical torment in her mother&#x27;s glass-and-diamond magical castle Pela-Orso, because of how Morgana wanted to force her to marry Tristan. Eventually, Gawain storms the castle after three years of siege and frees her from a cursed dungeon, also capturing her tyrannical mother for the same punishment. The 15th-century Italian compilation of Arthur and Tristan legends, &quot;La Tavola Ritonda&quot; (&quot;The Round Table&quot;), too makes Morgan a sister to the Lady of the Lake as well as to Arthur (about the fate of whom it says Morgan &quot;brought him away to a little island in the sea; and there he died of his wounds, and the fairy buried him on that island&quot;). It is based on the French prose romances, but here Morgan is a prophetic figure whose main role is to ensure the fulfilment of fate. Her daughter also appears, as Gaia Donzella, in the &quot;Tavola Ritonda&quot;, where she is kidnapped by the knight Burletta of the Desert (&quot;Burletta della Diserta&quot;) who wants to rape her but she is rescued by Lancelot. The Italian Morgana appears in a number of &quot;cantari&quot; poems of the 14th to 15th century. Some of these are original new episodes, such as the &quot;Cantari di Tristano&quot; group&#x27;s &quot;Cantare di Astore e Morgana&quot;, in which Morgana heals the wounded Hector de Maris (&quot;Astore&quot;) but turns him evil, and gives him an armour made in Hell as well as a magical ship in her revenge plot against Gawain as well as Arthur himself, and the &quot;Cantari del Falso Scudo&quot; that features her evil fairy son, the Knight of the False Shield, who ends up slain by Galahad. Other include &quot;Lasencis&quot;, a standalone version of the &quot;Tavola Ritonda&quot; story of the eponymous Corsican knight armed by Morgan with enchanted weapons to avenge his brother killed by Lancelot, and a yet another telling of the familiar story of Morgana&#x27;s good fairy daughter titled the &quot;Ponzela Gaia&quot;. Evangelista Fossa combined and retold some of those in his &quot;Innamoramento di Galvano&quot; (&quot;Gawain Falling in Love&quot;, c. 1494).

Morgan le Fay, or Fata Morgana in Italian, has been in particular associated with Sicily as a location of her enchanted realm in the mythological landscape of medieval Europe (at least since the Norman conquest of southern Italy), and local folklore describes her as living in a magical castle located at or floating over Mount Etna. As such she gave her name to the form of mirage common off the shores of Sicily, the Fata Morgana, since the 14th century. References linking Avalon to Sicily can be found in &quot;Otia Imperialia&quot; (c. 1211) and &quot;La faula&quot;, as well as in Breton and Provençal literature, for example in the aforementioned &quot;Jaufre&quot; and &quot;La Bataille Loquifer&quot;. The 13th-century Chrétien-inspired romance &quot;Floriant et Florete&quot; places Morgan&#x27;s secret mountain castle of Mongibel (also &quot;Montgibel&quot; or &quot;Montegibel&quot;, derived from the Arabic name for Etna), where, in the role of a fairy godmother, Morgane and two other fays spirit away and raises Floriant, a son of a murdered Sicilian king and the hero of the story. Floriant, with the help of her magic ship, eventually reunites with Morgane at her castle when he returns there with his wife Florete. The 15th-century French romance &quot;La Chevalier du Papegau&quot; (&quot;The Knight of the Parrot&quot;) gives Morgaine the Fairy of Montgibel (&quot;Morgaine, la fée de Montgibel&quot;, as she is also known in &quot;Floriant et Florete&quot;) a sister known as the Lady Without Pride (&quot;la Dame sans Orgueil&quot;), whom Arthur saves from the evil Knight of the Wasteland (similar to the story in the &quot;Tavola Ritonda&quot;). Meanwhile, the &quot;Fastnachtspiel&quot; (&quot;Ain Hupsches Vasnacht Spill von Künig Artus&quot;), a German retelling of the enchanted horn episode, moved Morgan&#x27;s Mediterranean Sea island domain to the east of Sicily, referring to her only as the Queen of Cyprus.

During the Italian Renaissance, Morgan has been primarily featured in relation to the cycle of epic poems of Orlando (based on Roland of the historical Charlemagne). In Matteo Maria Boiardo&#x27;s late-15th-century &quot;Orlando Innamorato&quot;, fata Morgana (initially as lady Fortune) is beautiful but wicked fairy enchantress, a sister of King Arthur and a pupil of Merlin. Morgana lives in her paradise-like garden in a crystal cavern under a lake, plotting to eventually destroy the entire world. There, she abducts her favourites until she is thwarted by Orlando who defeats, chases and captures Morgana, destroying her underwater prison and letting her keep only one of her forced lovers, a knight named Ziliante. In Ludovico Ariosto&#x27;s continuation of this tale, &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot; (1532), Morgana is revealed as a twin sister of two other sorceresses, the good Logistilla and the evil Alcina; Orlando again defeats Morgana, rescuing Ziliante who has been turned into a dragon, and forces Morgana to swear by her lord Demogorgon to abandon her plots. The story also features the medieval motif where uses a magic horn to convince Arthur of the infidelity of his queen (Geneura), here successfully. Bernardo Tasso&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Amadigi&quot; (1560) further introduces Morgana&#x27;s three daughters: Carvilia, Morganetta, and Nivetta, themselves temptresses of knights. Morgan&#x27;s other 16th-century appearances include these of Morgue la fée in François Rabelais&#x27; French satirical fantasy novel &quot;Les grandes chroniques du grand et énorme géant Gargantua et il publie Pantagruel&quot; (1532) and of the good Morgana in Erasmo di Valvasone&#x27;s Italian didactic poem &quot;La caccia&quot; (1591). In Edmund Spenser&#x27;s English epic poem &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; (1590), Argante (Layamon&#x27;s name for Morgan) is lustful giantess queen of the &quot;secret Ile&quot;, evoking the Post-Vulgate story of Morgan&#x27;s kidnapping of Sir Alexander. It also features three other counterpart characters: Acrasia, Duessa, and Malecasta, all representing different themes from Malory&#x27;s description of Morgan. Morgan might have also inspired the characters of the healer Loosepaine and the fay Oriande in the Scots language poem &quot;Greysteil&quot;, possibly originally written in 15th-century England.

==Modern culture==
The character of Morgan has become ubiquitous in works of the modern era, spanning fantasy, historical fiction and other genres across various mediums, especially since the mid-20th century.

<text>The Basílica Menor of San Francisco de Asís (; also the Convento de San Francisco de Asis) is a Catholic minor basilica and Franciscan convent in the district of Old Havana, Cuba. Its construction began in 1548 and lasted until 1591, although it was inaugurated in 1575, it was badly damaged by storms in 1680 and 1692, and by a hurricane that broke down its tower in 1694. Started in its current form in 1716, it was completely completed almost 200 years later, with a series of structural reforms from 1731 to 1738.

==Public square==

Plaza de San Francisco de Asís (Saint Francis of Assisi Square) is a public square in the district of Old Havana, Havana, Cuba. Founded on 2 June 1628, it is one of the oldest squares in Havana. It is named after the nearby Convento de San Francisco de Asís, a Franciscan convent built between 1575 and 1591. The iconic Fuente de los Leones, built by Italian sculptor Giuseppe Gaggini, was installed in 1836.

In 1761, José Martín Félix de Arrate, Mayor of Havana, considered the &quot;plaza&quot; to be the best place in the city. Both the city hall (&quot;casas capitulares&quot;), police house, jailhouse and customs office faced the &quot;plaza&quot; at the time. The Basílica Menor of San Francisco de Asís (Minor Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi) is a Franciscan convent in the district of Old Havana, Cuba. Its construction began in 1548 and lasted until 1591, although it was inaugurated in 1575, it was damaged by storms in 1680 and 1692, and by a hurricane that broke down its tower in 1694. It began in its current form in 1716, and completed 200 years later with a series of structural reforms from 1731 to 1738.

===Painting by Dominic Serres===

One of a series of 11 painting completed by Dominic Serres for the Keppel family of the capture of Havana, the last major operation of the Seven Years&#x27; War, 1756–63. It was part of Great Britain&#x27;s offensive against Spain when she entered the war in support of France late in 1761. The British government&#x27;s response was immediately to plan large offensive amphibious operations against Spanish overseas possessions, particularly Havana, the capital of the western dominions and Manila, the capital of the eastern. Havana needed large forces for its capture and early in 1762 ships and troops were dispatched under Admiral Sir George Pocock and General the Earl of Albemarle. The force which descended on Cuba consisted of 22 ships of the line, four 50-gun ships, three 40-gunners, a dozen frigates and a dozen sloops and bomb vessels. In addition there were troopships, storeships, and hospital ships. Pocock took this great fleet of about 180 sail through the dangerous Old Straits of Bahama, from Jamaica, to take Havana by surprise. This painting comes towards the end of the chronological sequence of the series, once Havana has been captured and occupied by the British. The focus of the composition is the magnificent late colonial Baroque architecture of the church of San Francisco de Asís. Despite the received title of the painting, this was not the cathedral of Havana, but a monastic church dating from the 1730s. Serres treats the subject in the conventional manner of a European topographical cityscape, but inserts conspicuous details indicating the context of conflict and the colonial setting. So, red-coated troops exercise in the square, and a sentry stands guard outside his box, across from black-robed figures of Spanish Catholic clerics and alongside a group of self-absorbed boys at play. On the far side of the square another red-coated European strides with his parasol to protect him from the burning tropical sun, while in the harbour beyond the dome of the church sit British warships at anchor.

===British occupation===

The basilica was used by the British for their worship during the year in which they ruled Havana. The Siege of Havana was a military action that lasted from March to August 1762, and was a part of the Seven Years&#x27; War. British forces besieged and captured the city of Havana, which at the time was an important Spanish naval base, the British dealt a serious blow to the Spanish Navy. Havana was subsequently returned to Spain under the 1763 Treaty of Paris that formally ended the war. When it returned to Spanish rule, they chose not to use it as a church. It is now used for concerts. Attached to the basilica is a bell tower (138-ft). Originally a statue of St. Francis of Assisi stood on the top of the bell tower but it was destroyed by a cyclone in 1846. Today a statue of Fray Junípero Serra with Juaneño Indian boy stands next to the basilica.

===Facade===
The facade is located in the Calle Oficios where three stone statues representing the Immaculate Conception, Francis of Assisi and Saint Dominic. It attained its current status of minor basilica in 1739. The adjacent Plaza de San Francisco de Asís was inaugurated in 1628. Along with the rest of Old Havana, it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1982.

===Cloister===

The cloister of the adjacent monastery which dates back to 1739 now houses a museum of sacred art.

<doc id="352612" wikidata="Q336162" url="?curid=352612" title="Margaret Jay, Baroness Jay of Paddington">
<text>Margaret Ann Jay, Baroness Jay of Paddington, (née Callaghan; born 18 November 1939), is a British politician for the Labour Party and former BBC television producer and presenter.

==Early life==
Her father was James Callaghan, a Labour politician and prime minister, and she was educated at Blackheath High School, Blackheath and Somerville College, Oxford.

Between 1965 and 1977 she held production posts within the BBC, working on current affairs and further education television programmes. She then became a journalist on the BBC&#x27;s prestigious &quot;Panorama&quot; programme, and Thames Television&#x27;s &quot;This Week&quot; and presented the BBC 2 series &quot;Social History of Medicine&quot;. She has a strong interest in health issues, notably as a campaigner on HIV and AIDS. She was a founder director of the National AIDS Trust in 1987 and is also a patron of Help the Aged.

Between 1994 and 1997, Baroness Jay was the chairman of the charity Attend (then National Association of Hospital and Community Friends). In 2003, she was elected vice-president of Attend.

==Political career==
Jay was appointed a life peer on 29 July 1992 with the title of Baroness Jay of Paddington, of Paddington in the City of Westminster, and acted as an opposition Whip in the House of Lords. Her status as the daughter of a former Prime Minister led to her being nicknamed &#x27;Posh Spice&#x27; after her ennoblement. As a peer, in association with the shop workers&#x27; union, she led opposition to the liberalisation of Sunday trading hours.

After her party&#x27;s election victory in May 1997, she became Minister of State for Health in the House of Lords. From 1998 she was Leader of the House of Lords, playing a pivotal role in the major reform that led to the removal of most of its hereditary members. On 11 November 1999 the government&#x27;s reform bill (House of Lords Act 1999) was given Royal Assent and more than 660 hereditary peers lost their right to sit and vote in the Lords.

She retired from active politics in 2001. Among numerous non-executive roles that she has taken on since retiring from politics, she was a non-executive director of BT Group.

She was co-chair of the cross-party Iraq Commission (along with Tom King and Paddy Ashdown) which was established by the Foreign Policy Centre think-tank and Channel 4. Before her resignation, Jay gave an interview in which she said she attended a &quot;pretty standard grammar school&quot;, which was actually Blackheath High School, an independent school. (Although, as Jay herself pointed out, during the period when she attended it was a direct-grant school – that is to say, a state-funded direct grant grammar school.) She drew ridicule when she said she could understand the needs of rural voters because she had a &quot;little cottage&quot; in the country, which turned out to be a £500,000 house in Ireland, and she also had a &quot;substantial property&quot; in the Chilterns.

==Personal life==

In 1961, Callaghan married fellow journalist Peter Jay, a child of political parents: Douglas Jay, Labour MP and president of the Board of Trade, and Margaret Garnett, member of the Greater London Council. Peter Jay was appointed ambassador to the United States by his friend David Owen, Foreign Secretary in her father&#x27;s government, leading to accusations of nepotism.

While in the United States, she met journalist Carl Bernstein, with whom she had a much-publicised extramarital affair in 1979. Bernstein&#x27;s then-wife Nora Ephron fictionalised the story in her novel, &quot;Heartburn&quot;, in which the character of Thelma is a thinly disguised representation of Jay. Peter Jay then had an affair with their nanny, fathering a child in the process (he originally denied paternity). The Jays divorced in 1986 after 25 years of marriage.

In 1994, she married AIDS specialist Michael Adler, who had been chair of the National AIDS Trust when she was its director. She retained her surname from her first marriage. She has three children: Tamsin, Alice and Patrick.

<doc id="352614" wikidata="Q5170" url="?curid=352614" title="Blondel de Nesle">
<text>Blondel de Nesle () – either Jean I of Nesle (c. 1155 – 1202) or his son Jean II of Nesle (died 1241) – was a French trouvère.

The name &#x27;Blondel de Nesle&#x27; is attached to twenty-four or twenty-five courtly songs. He was identified in 1942, by Holger Dyggve, as Jean II of Nesle (near Amiens), who was nicknamed &#x27;Blondel&#x27; for his long blond hair. He married at the time of his father&#x27;s death in 1202, and that same year, went on the Fourth Crusade; he later fought in the Albigensian Crusade. However, in 1994, Yvan Lepage suggested that the poet may have been Jean I, father of Jean II, who was Lord of Nesle from 1180 to 1202; this Jean took part in the Third Crusade, which may explain the subsequent legend linking him with King Richard I of England. It is not known for certain if &#x27;Blondel&#x27; is indeed a nickname and some authors are far from convinced that Jean I of Nesle or his son are the real Blondel. The situation is made worse by the loss of records which may have helped solve the problem.

If the works are correctly identified and dated, he was a significant influence on his European contemporaries, who made much use of his melodies. The melody of &quot; is used in , for the song &quot;.

==Legend==

By 1260, Blondel&#x27;s name had become attached to a legend in the highly fictionalised ; this claimed that, after King Richard of England was arrested and held for ransom in 1192, he was found by the minstrel Blondel, whom he saw from his window, and to whom he sang a verse of a song they both knew. Later versions of the story related that Blondel went from castle to castle, singing a particular song that only he and Richard knew, and that the imprisoned Richard replied with the second verse – thus identifying where he was imprisoned. Then, Blondel either aided the king&#x27;s escape or reported his position back to his friends. Blondel finally found Richard at Dürnstein; in fact, there was no mystery about Richard&#x27;s location which was widely publicized by his ransomers.

&#x27;Blondel&#x27; is a common surname in Normandy, including on the Channel Islands. It is recorded that King Richard granted a fief on the island Guernsey to a vassal named Blondel, but it remains uncertain as to whether this has any connection with the legend, or whether the legend has any connection with the known trouvère. 

===Modern versions===
The legend of Blondel did not achieve great popularity in the Middle Ages, but was taken up in the late eighteenth century. It was the basis of André Ernest Modeste Grétry&#x27;s opera (1784). In 1822, Eleanor Anne Porden used the legend in her epic poem : in her version, Blondel is really Richard&#x27;s wife, Berengaria of Navarre, in disguise.

A poem by Johann Gabriel Seidl titled &quot;&quot; was set to music by Robert Schumann (1840).

Throughout the nineteenth century, the legend became a key component in the mythology surrounding Richard. Some later twentieth century novelists, placed a homosexual interpretation on his supposed relationship with the king. Norah Lofts in &quot;The Lute Player&quot; (1951) has Richard make a (rather gentlemanly) approach to Blondel, which is refused, Blondel&#x27;s heart and devotion being entirely given to Richard&#x27;s neglected wife Berengaria.

In the 1962–63 ITV British television series &quot;Richard the Lionheart&quot;, Blondel was a semi-regular character, played by Iain Gregory.

The legend inspired &quot;Blondel&quot;, a 1983 musical by Stephen Oliver and Tim Rice. The play, a comedic rock opera, is set during the period of the Third Crusade. Blondel is portrayed as a frustrated artist, seeking fame as a composer and performer, even as he searches for his imprisoned monarch. Rice collaborated with director Patrick Wilde to revive the show at the Pleasance Theatre in London in 2006.

<text>The morin khuur (), also known as the horsehead fiddle, is a traditional Mongolian bowed stringed instrument. It is one of the most important musical instruments of the Mongol people, and is considered a symbol of the nation of Mongolia. The morin khuur is one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity identified by UNESCO.

== Name ==
In Mongolian, the instrument is usually called morin khuur or &quot;horse fiddle&quot;.

The full Classical Mongolian name for the morin khuur is &quot;morin toloğay’ta quğur&quot;, (which in modern Khalkh cyrillic is Морин толгойтой хуур) meaning &quot;fiddle with a horse&#x27;s head&quot;. Usually it is abbreviated as &quot;Морин хуур&quot;, Latin transcription &quot;Morin huur&quot;. In western Mongolia it is known as ikil (—not to be confused with the similar Tuvan igil)—while in eastern Mongolia it is known as shoor ().

== Construction ==
The instrument consists of a trapeziform wooden-framed sound box to which two strings are attached. It is held nearly upright with the sound box in the musician&#x27;s lap or between the musician&#x27;s legs. The strings are made from hairs from nylon or horses&#x27; tails, strung parallel, and run over a wooden bridge on the body up a long neck, past a second smaller bridge, to the two tuning pegs in the scroll, which is usually carved into the form of a horse&#x27;s head.

The bow is loosely strung with horse hair coated with larch or cedar wood resin, and is held from underneath with the right hand. The underhand grip enables the hand to tighten the loose hair of the bow, allowing very fine control of the instrument&#x27;s timbre.

The larger of the two strings (the &quot;male&quot; string) has 130 hairs from a stallion&#x27;s tail, while the &quot;female&quot; string has 105 hairs from a mare&#x27;s tail. Nowadays the strings are made of nylon. Traditionally, the strings were tuned a fifth apart, though in modern music they are more often tuned a fourth apart, usually to B-flat and F. The strings are stopped either by pinching them in the joints of the index and middle fingers, or by pinching them between the nail of the little finger and the pad of the ring finger.

Traditionally, the frame is covered with camel, goat, or sheep skin, in which case a small opening would be left in the back. However, since the 1970s, new completely wooden sound box instruments have appeared, with carved f-holes similar to European stringed instruments.

A beginner-grade morin khuur typically features a pine top with birch or laminated back and sides. In contrast, player-grade morin khuur is crafted from higher quality tonewoods, such as spruce for the top and birch for the back and sides. Some instruments, particularly those intended for classical music, use maple for the back and sides to produce a brighter sound.

The modern standard height is ; the distance between the upper bridge and the lower bridge is about , but the upper bridge especially can be adapted to match smaller player&#x27;s fingers. The sound box usually has a depth of ; the width of the soundbox is about at the top and at the bottom. Good quality instruments can achieve a strength of 85 dBA, which allows it to be played (if desired) even in mezzoforte or crescendo. When horsehair is used, the luthiers prefer to use the hair of white stallions. In general the quality of a horse hair string depends on its preparation, the climate conditions and the nutrition of the animals. That gives a wide area of quality differences.

Quality nylon strings (Khalkh Mongolian: ) last for up to 2 years, but only if prepared and placed properly on the instrument. Most beginners don&#x27;t comb the strings, then the sound quality worsens quickly. Good strings nearly sound like steel strings, and in spectrograms they show about 7-8 harmonics.

Morin khuur vary in form depending on region. Instruments from central Mongolia tend to have larger bodies and thus possess more volume than the smaller-bodied instruments of Inner Mongolia. In addition, the Inner Mongolian instruments have mostly mechanics for tightening the strings, where Mongolian luthiers mostly use traditional ebony or rosewood pegs in a slightly conic shape. In Tuva, the morin khuur is sometimes used in place of the igil.

== Origin ==
One legend about the origin of the morin khuur is that a shepherd named Namjil the Cuckoo (or Khuhuu Namjil) received the gift of a flying horse; he would mount it at night and fly to meet his beloved. A jealous woman had the horse&#x27;s wings cut off so that the horse fell from the air and died. The grieving shepherd made a horsehead fiddle from the now-wingless horse&#x27;s skin and tail hair and used it to play poignant songs about his horse.

Another legend credits the invention of the morin khuur to a boy named Sükhe (or Suho). After a wicked lord slew the boy&#x27;s prized white horse, the horse&#x27;s spirit came to Sükhe in a dream and instructed him to make an instrument from the horse&#x27;s body, so the two could still be together and neither would be lonely. So the first morin khuur was assembled, with horse bones as its neck, horsehair strings, horse skin covering its wooden soundbox, and its scroll carved into the shape of a horse head.

The fact that most of the eastern Turkic neighbors of the Mongols possess similar horse hair instruments (such as the Tuvan igil, the Kazakh kobyz, or the Kyrgyz Kyl kyyak), though not western Turkic, is a testament to the shared musical heritage across the various Khanates that mutually ruled these people.

The gusle/lahuta from Southeastern Europe (Serbia, Croatia &amp; Albania) is a very similar instrument, and may have been brought along trade routes that both Mongolia and the Balkans shared. Often these instruments are depicted with a goat head instead of a horse in Europe.

== Playing technique ==
The modern style Morin Khuur is played with nearly natural finger positions. That means, the distance between two fingers usually make the distance of a half tone on the lower section of the instrument. On the tune F / B the index finger hits on the low (F) string the G, the middle finger hits the G, the ring finger hits the A, the little finger the B flat. Identical positions are on the high strings - C, C, D, D. The little finger tips the B strings under the F string, while all other fingers touch the strings from the top.

Melodies are usually played from F to F&#x27; on the F string, then the player switches to the B string and continues with G, A, B. There are 3 hand positions on the F string, and 2 positions on the B strings a musician must memorize. The idea is that without moving the string hand too much the sound quality improves. The 2nd hand position on the B string is used to play C, D, E, then moves a little bit for hitting the F&#x27; with the little finger, then without moving the G position can be reached with the 1st finger.

It is also possible to touch the B string with the thumb to get a C, and use the ring finger under the F string to achieve the D.

On the F strings only the first harmonic is used, so the scale ranges from F to F&#x27;. On the B strings several harmonics are available: B&#x27;, F&quot;, B&quot;, also often players accompanying the F&#x27; on the F string with an F&quot; overtone at the F&#x27; position on the B string.

Some parts of the bowing technique is unique - the little and the ring finger of the right hand usually touch the bow hair, which is used for setting accents. The other two fingers maintain a slight pressure on the strings. A common technique with other string instruments is the &quot;Kist&quot;. When the bow direction changes, the right hand moves a little bit in advance to the opposite direction to avoid scratchy sounds and for achieving a better voice. When pushing the bow the hand closes a little bit in direction of a fist, when pulling it the hand opens - nearly to a right angle between the arm and the fingers.

The instrument can be used for playing western style classical music, or Mongolian style pieces. The primary education is to learn the scales, to train the ear for achieving the &quot;muscle memory&quot;, the ability to automatically adapt the finger position when a note wasn&#x27;t hit properly. The main goal is to achieve a &quot;clear&quot; sound, that means no change in volume or frequency is desired. That depends on three main facts:

* finger force used for touching the strings
* pressure of the bow
* constant sound after bow direction changes

As variation are usually used the &quot;accent&quot; and the &quot;vibrato&quot;. Other techniques like the &quot;Col legno&quot;, the &quot;Pizzicato&quot; or the &quot;Martellato&quot; are generally not used on the Morin Huur.

Because of its standard tune to Bb and F mostly western music is transposed for being played in one of the four most common scales: F major, F minor, B Major, E major. When used as a solo instrument the Morin Huur is often tuned a half tone higher or lower.

Nearly all of the Mongolian style pieces are in F minor, and often the instrument is tuned 1-2 notes lower for coming closer to the tunes used in the deep past. The instruments in the pre-socialist era of Mongolia were usually covered with skin, which mostly doesn&#x27;t allow the Bb and F tune - usually tuned 2-4 notes deeper.

On the contemporary Morin Khuur the deep string is placed at the right side and the high string is placed at the left side, seen from the front of the instrument. The Igil has the opposite placement of strings, so a player has to adapt in order to play pieces made for the other one. For contemporary teaching the modern style is in use.

== Education ==
In Mongolia, the morin khuur can be learned at three schools:
* The SUIS (), Engl. &quot;University of Arts and Culture&quot;. Here, students enter in adult age for obtaining a bachelor&#x27;s degree after 2 years and a master&#x27;s degree after 5 years of musical education. After the master&#x27;s degree, the students are considered to be professional musicians, and can play at one of the state ensembles or later become a teacher at the SUIS.
* Mongolian State Conservatory (). Accepting students who are not older than 10 years old for the morin khuur class at the conservatory and since September 2017, the conservatory has been offering a Bachelor of Music and a Master of Music in Morin Khuur Performance degree.
* The culture school of the SUIS (). Here several qualification courses are available. Graduates from this school mostly become teachers or enter the SUIS.

Also many amateur players acquired reasonable skills by taking lessons from private teachers, or being taught by their parents or other relatives.

== Cultural influence ==

The morin khuur is the national instrument in Mongolia. Many festivals are held for celebrating the importance of this instrument on the Mongolian culture, like the biannual &quot;International Morin Huur Festival and Competition&quot;, which is organized by the &quot;World Morinhuur Association&quot;. First held in 2008, second in 2010 - with 8 participating countries (Mongolia, Korea, China, Russia, USA, Germany, France, Japan) - and planned for May 2012. Here, many amateurs come and play freestyle pieces, but also a professional contest is held and an instrument making competition.

During June, the &quot;Roaring Hooves&quot; festival is held. This is a small festival for professional skilled players - but unfortunately a closed festival. These recordings are often shown in TV reports later.

On the national festival &quot;Naadam&quot; praise songs are played for the most magnificent horse and for the highest ranked wrestler and archer. The songs are called &quot;Magtaal&quot; and accompanied by a unique style of praise and morin khuur.

Many Mongolians have the instrument in their home because it is a symbol for peace and happiness.

During the winter time, but also at the beginning of the spring time, a morin khuur player is called in for the &quot;жавар үргээх&quot;, the &quot;ceremony for scaring away the frost&quot;. In general, many traditional pieces are played, divided in the different styles: &quot;уртын дуу&quot;, &quot;urtiin duu&quot; (long song), &quot;магтаал&quot;, &quot;magtaal&quot; (praise songs) and &quot;татлага&quot;, &quot;tatlaga&quot; (solo pieces, mostly imitating horses or camels).

The fourth style, the &quot;биелгее&quot; is rarely played in these ceremonies, but in western Mongolia it is common for accompanying &quot;tatlaga dancing&quot; in 3 times - like a waltz, but with dance movements imitating daily tasks of a nomad&#x27;s family.

A number of folk metal and folk rock bands from Mongolia and the Chinese autonomous region of Inner Mongolia have combined heavy metal and rock music with traditional Mongolian lyrical themes and instruments, including the morin khuur; some of these bands include Altan Urag, Nine Treasures, Tengger Cavalry, Hanggai, the Hu, and Uuhai.

==Animal psychological healing use by Gobi Desert farmers==
In the Mongolian Gobi herder&#x27;s daily life, the Morin Khuur has another important use. When a mother camel gives birth to a calf, sometimes she rejects her calf due to various natural stress situations. Mongolian camel herders use Morin Khuur-based melodies alongside special low-harmonic types of songs called &quot;Khoosloh&quot; to heal the mother camel&#x27;s stress and encourage her to re-adopt her calf. While re-adoption in animal husbandry practice is widely used in various nomadic civilizations worldwide, uniquely for Mongolian Gobi herders, only this instrument is used with camels. If a mother camel dies after giving birth to a calf, the herder would use this Khoosloh technique alongside Morin Khuur melodies to encourage another mother camel who has her own calf to adopt the new one. The practice is well documented in the documentary called &quot;Ingen Egshig&quot; directed by Badraa J. in 1986 and was also remade in 2003 by director Byambasuren Davaa with a different title of &quot;The Story of the Weeping Camel&quot; which was nominated in 2005 Academy Award for Best Documentary.

<text>Timothy Stephen Kenneth Yeo (born 20 March 1945) is a British politician. A member of the Conservative Party, he was the Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency of South Suffolk between the 1983 United Kingdom general election and that of 2015, when he was deselected by his constituency party.

Yeo served as the Minister for the Environment and Countryside from 1993 to 1994 in the government of Prime Minister John Major. He also served in the Shadow Cabinet from 1998 to 2005 under Conservative Party leaders William Hague, Iain Duncan Smith and Michael Howard.

==Early life==
Yeo was educated at Charterhouse School, before going on to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he read History and graduated in 1968. At university he &quot;did no work, got a poor degree and adored it&quot;.

From 1970 to 1973, Yeo was assistant treasurer of Bankers Trust Company. Then, from 1975 to 1986, he was a director of Worcester Engineering Company. From 1980 to 1983, he was chief executive of the Spastics Society (now known as Scope).

The Tadworth Court Children&#x27;s Hospital was founded in 1984 under his chairmanship after Great Ormond Street Hospital had decided to relinquish the building in 1982. He resigned in the early nineties because of his parliamentary workload and was succeeded by Archie Norman.

==Political career==
Yeo contested Bedwellty in the February 1974 general election before being elected as MP for South Suffolk in 1983, replacing Sudbury &amp; Woodbridge MP Keith Stainton who he defeated in the selection contest for South Suffolk.

He asked the first televised Prime Minister&#x27;s Question to Margaret Thatcher on 28 November 1989.

===In government===
In 1988, he became the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Home Secretary, Douglas Hurd and in 1990 was appointed Parliamentary Under Secretary for Housing and Planning. After the 1992 general election Yeo became Parliamentary Under Secretary for Health.

In 1993, Yeo was appointed Minister for the Environment and Countryside in John Major&#x27;s government, but was forced to resign after a scandal involving his so-called &quot;love child&quot; with a Conservative councillor, Julia Stent, who was born on 8 July 1993. Three years earlier, Yeo had said to the branch of Relate in his constituency, &quot;It is in everyone&#x27;s interests to reduce broken families and the number of single parents. I have seen from my own constituency the consequences of marital breakdown.&quot; The story broke on Boxing Day during a quiet news period and intense coverage was given to the scandal. Yeo resigned on 5 January 1994; he was the first ministerial casualty of the media reaction to John Major&#x27;s Back to Basics campaign.

===In opposition===
After the Conservatives&#x27; defeat in the 1997 general election, the party&#x27;s new leader William Hague appointed Yeo as a spokesman on the Environment, Transport and the Regions. He was promoted to the Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Minister of Agriculture in 1998. In 2001, he played a leading role in exposing the Government&#x27;s mishandling of the Foot and Mouth Disease epidemic.

Yeo was a member of Iain Duncan Smith&#x27;s Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. In 2003, Yeo was made Shadow Secretary for Education and Health by the party&#x27;s new leader, Michael Howard, with responsibility for the party&#x27;s policy on both schools and hospitals. In 2004, Howard made Yeo the Shadow Secretary for the Environment and Transport.

Yeo resigned from the shadow cabinet shortly after the 2005 general election, saying he wished to be free to play a role in rethinking the Conservative Party&#x27;s future. On 27 August, he ruled himself out of the ensuing party leadership election following Howard&#x27;s resignation, announcing his backing for former Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke. The contest was won by the then-Shadow Secretary of State for Education and Skills, David Cameron.

===Committee chair===
As chair of the Energy and Climate Change Select Committee, Yeo was an influential voice on energy policy. Despite his committee releasing a report sceptical of hydraulic fracturing in the United Kingdom, Yeo revised his personal opinion and supported the use of the technique in the UK. In 2012, he announced that he supported the proposal for a third runway at Heathrow Airport, and that his long-held &quot;environmental objections&quot; to expansion were &quot;disappearing&quot;. In 2013, he stated that the government reaching an agreement over nuclear power expansion was a &quot;matter of great urgency&quot;, and warned that Britain could run out of energy if negotiations were not concluded quickly.

On 9 June 2013, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; alleged, citing video evidence of a conversation with the MP, that he had helped &quot;coach&quot; a solar energy company executive for an appearance before his parliamentary committee; the parent company pays Yeo. The MP referred himself to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, and said that he intended to fight the claims made against him. On 24 November 2015, he lost his libel action against the newspaper in the High Court, with judge Mr Justice Warby saying that the newspaper&#x27;s reporting was &quot;substantially true&quot; and describing Yeo&#x27;s evidence as &quot;unreliable&quot; and &quot;untruthful&quot;, with one part being &quot;unworthy of belief&quot;. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; suggested this should also raise questions about Kathryn Hudson&#x27;s performance as Standards Commissioner, as she had previously cleared Mr Yeo of breaching the rules on lobbying ministers for financial reward and of bringing the Commons into disrepute.

On 9 June 2013 he temporarily &quot;stepped aside&quot; as the chair of the committee. The Liberal Democrat Sir Robert Smith replaced him on an interim basis.

===Deselection===
Yeo was deselected for the 2015 general election in a secret ballot of South Suffolk Conservative Party members on 29 November 2013. He remained the MP for the constituency until the election in May 2015.

==Business interests==
Previously he has been chairman of AFC Energy, Univent plc, TMO Renewables and Eco City Vehicles plc. TMO Renewables collapsed, leading Yeo to be sued by former stakeholders for misleading them in early 2018.

He and his wife Diane are sole directors of Locana Corporation (London) Ltd., Anacol Holdings Ltd. and General Securities Register Ltd. He is also a director of ITI Energy Ltd. He writes articles for &quot;Golf Weekly&quot; and &quot;Country Life&quot; magazines and, occasionally, the &quot;Financial Times&quot;.

Yeo occupies a seat on the board of Eurotunnel. In June 2013 &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; released a video in which Yeo claimed to have told a representative of GB Railfreight (a subsidiary of Eurotunnel) how to act in front of the Energy and Climate Change Select Committee, saying he was &quot;able to tell him in advance what to say&quot;. Yeo had earlier excused himself from the committee, on the grounds that he might be &quot;biased&quot; if he questioned an employee of a company for which he himself worked, and rejected the claims.

==Political funding==
Yeo received £67,290 in remunerations from corporate donors for work done for AFC Energy PLC, a developer of alkaline fuel cells focused on industrial application. From other corporate donors, he received £372,419 in other remunerations, from companies including TMO Renewables Limited, Groupe Eurotunnel SA, and Eco City Vehicles.

==Post-parliamentary career==
Yeo is chairman of New Nuclear Watch Europe and chairs the University of Sheffield Industrial Advisory Board for the Energy 2050 initiative.

==Personal life==
Yeo married Diane Helen Pickard on 30 March 1970 in Greenwich. They have a son, the portrait painter Jonathan Yeo, and a daughter.

Yeo has two more daughters from outside his marriage. He fathered his first daughter in 1967 when he was still a student at Cambridge University and put her up for adoption. Another daughter was born in 1993 through an extra-marital affair.

<doc id="352628" wikidata="Q7841714" url="?curid=352628" title="Trigger Street Productions">
<text>Trigger Street Productions is an American entertainment production company formed by Kevin Spacey in 1997 and further developed by his business partner Dana Brunetti. The company&#x27;s credits include &quot;Captain Phillips&quot;, &quot;Shakespeare High&quot;, &quot;Safe&quot;, &quot;The Social Network&quot;, &quot;21&quot;, &quot;Shrink&quot;, &quot;Fanboys&quot;, the Emmy-nominated &quot;Bernard and Doris&quot;, Emmy-winning &quot;Recount&quot;, &quot;Mini&#x27;s First Time&quot;, &quot;Beyond the Sea&quot;, &quot;The United States of Leland&quot;, &quot;The Big Kahuna&quot; and &quot;House of Cards&quot;, as well as stage productions of &quot;The Iceman Cometh&quot; and &quot;Cobb&quot;.

Shortly after the company was formed, Trigger Street Productions had signed a deal with Fine Line Features in order to release films for a two-year period. In 2001, Trigger Street Productions was then signed to a contract with film financer Intermedia in order to finance future Trigger Street features, for a first-look deal, which resulted in the founder&#x27;s involvement in producing &quot;K-PAX&quot;.

The name &quot;Trigger Street&quot; is a reference to an actual street in Spacey&#x27;s boyhood home of Chatsworth, where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans (and Roy&#x27;s horse Trigger) had their ranch. Spacey and his childhood friends dreamed of opening a neighborhood theater where they could stage their own &quot;Trigger Street&quot; productions. In 2011, the company signed a deal with Sony Pictures. In 2015, the company had launched a television division with a deal at Fox 21 Television Studios.

In January 2016 it was announced that Relativity Media, which was just emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy, had acquired Trigger Street Productions and that Spacey would become chairman of Relativity Studios whilst Brunetti would become the studio&#x27;s president. Spacey called the move “an incredible opportunity to make great entertainment” and said he considered it the “next evolution in my career.”, and Brunetti said, &quot;Being a disruptor at heart, I look forward to the opportunities that being inside a studio system will present.&quot;

However, when the paperwork for the studio was filed for the court it emerged that Spacey had opted out of assuming the chairmanship of the studios, and by the end of 2016 Brunetti had also left Relativity whilst both remained Executive Producers on &quot;House of Cards&quot; and &quot;&quot; (previous working title: &quot;Manifesto&quot;).

==Trigger Street Labs==
Trigger Street Labs was developed by Dana Brunetti and launched in 2002 as an online community for unrepresented writers and filmmakers. In its first few years it had thousands of online users uploading their work, reviewing work by their peers, and participating in online competitions and short film festivals. The site was previously sponsored by Stella Artois, and in October 2009, Artois hosted the Stella Artois Short Film Project. The project was hosted on the site, and awarded the grand prize of US$50,000 to Jason Klein for his short film &quot;A Perfect Time&quot;.

===Trigg.la===
Trigg.la is a spin-off website from Trigger Street Labs. It hosts several podcasts, a filmmaking blog, and information about other Los Angeles-based industries.

====Triggla podcasts====
Triggla&#x27;s podcasts, which are now off-air, were categorized under the headings of the arts, music, society and culture, and technology. In addition there was a podcast by the porn star Kayden Kross called &quot;Kayden&#x27;s Review&quot; which reviewed mainstream films.

One of the podcasts, &quot;The First 15&quot;, was co-hosted by Carter Swan, vice president of Trigger Street Productions, and screenwriter Philip Eisner. The show featured a different would-be screenwriter each week who was interviewed via Skype and advised on how to make improvements to the first fifteen pages of their script. The screenplays originated from the Trigger Street Labs website.

==Jameson First Shot==
In 2011, the company teamed up with Jameson Irish Whiskey to create Jameson First Shot, which was an opportunity to give three up-and-coming filmmakers a &#x27;first shot&#x27; in the movie business by producing their short film starring an A-List actor. In the competition&#x27;s first year the actor was Kevin Spacey. Each year the competition features a new actor and a new set of finalists to work with that actor. In the first years of the competition only one finalist was selected from each of these three territories: the United States, South Africa and Russia. In later years the competition was opened up to include more territories, but still only produced three winning scripts. The resulting films are debuted in a red carpet screening and screened online on Jameson&#x27;s YouTube channel. The competition has run annually ever since its first year with a new set of winners and a new leading actor or actress.

<doc id="352630" wikidata="Q335926" url="?curid=352630" title="Janet Young, Baroness Young">
<text>Janet Mary Young, Baroness Young, ( Baker, 23 October 1926 – 6 September 2002) was a British Conservative Party politician. She served as the first ever female Leader of the House of Lords from 1981 to 1983, first as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and from 1982 as Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal. She was the only woman ever appointed to the Cabinet by Margaret Thatcher.

==Early life==
Born Janet Mary Baker in Widnes in 1926, she was the daughter of J. N. L. Baker, a geographer at Oxford University, and Phyllis (née Hancock) Baker. She went to the mainly boys Dragon School in Oxford where she played rugby and cricket, and then to Headington School. During World War II she studied at Yale University, and then took an MA in philosophy, politics and economics at St Anne&#x27;s College, Oxford. In 1950, she married the academic chemist Geoffrey Tyndale Young (1915–2014), and had three daughters.

==Political career==
Young became a councillor for Oxford City Council in 1957 and was leader by 1967. Not long after, she was raised to the peerage on the advice of Edward Heath. Her life peerage was announced on 5 April 1971 and was raised to the peerage on 24 May 1971 as Baroness Young, &quot;of Farnworth in the County Palatine of Lancaster&quot;. She became a government whip shortly after appointment and was subsequently promoted to minister of state in the Department for Education. She joined the Cabinet on 15 September 1981, when she was appointed to be the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. On 13 April 1982, she was appointed to be the Leader of the House of Lords and the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, posts which she kept for only 14 months, until 11 June 1983. Thatcher thought that Young &quot;was perhaps too consistent an advocate of caution on all occasions&quot; and was not an effective leader in the Lords. However, Young&#x27;s colleagues disagreed, describing her as &quot;bloody tough&quot; and a &quot;competent minister&quot;.

She sat on the boards of large corporations such as NatWest and Marks &amp; Spencer. In later life she was known for her staunch opposition to gay rights; as an obituary put it: &quot;The wellspring of her moral activism was her belief in Christian marriage and family life, her concern for children&#x27;s welfare and her belief that as a Conservative she should stand up against what she saw as the slide towards an entirely secular society.&quot; She worked to try to stop legislation going through that would allow unmarried couples (including gay men and women) to adopt children, led campaigns in the House of Lords to prevent equalisation of the age of consent for homosexual men with that of heterosexuals, and also fought the repeal of Section 28. She was ultimately defeated on all counts. Although she managed to delay the repeal of Section 28 in England and Wales in 2000, after her death Section 28 was finally removed from the statute book in 2003.

==Death==
Young died from cancer at her home in Oxford on 6 September 2002, at the age of 75.

<text>[[Messier object|Messier]] 61 (also known as M61, [[New General Catalogue|NGC]] 4303, or the Swelling Spiral Galaxy) is an intermediate barred spiral galaxy in the Virgo Cluster of galaxies. It was first discovered by Barnaba Oriani on May 5, 1779, six days before Charles Messier discovered the same galaxy. Messier had observed it on the same night as Oriani but had mistaken it for a comet. Its distance has been estimated to be 45.61 million light years from the Milky Way Galaxy. It is a member of the M61 Group of galaxies, which is a member of the Virgo II Groups, a series of galaxies and galaxy clusters strung out from the southern edge of the Virgo Supercluster.

== Properties ==
M61 is one of the largest members of Virgo Cluster, and belongs to a smaller subgroup known as the &quot;S Cloud&quot;. The morphological classification of SAB(rs)bc indicates a weakly-barred spiral (SAB) with the suggestion of a ring structure (rs) and moderate to loosely wound spiral arms. It has an active galactic nucleus and is classified as a starburst galaxy containing a massive nuclear star cluster with an estimated mass of 105 solar masses and an age of 4 million years, as well as a central candidate supermassive black hole weighing around solar masses.
It cohabits with an older massive star cluster as well as a likely older starburst. Evidence of significant star formation and active bright nebulae appears across M61&#x27;s disk. Unlike most late-type spiral galaxies within the Virgo Cluster, M61 shows an unusual abundance of neutral hydrogen (H I).

==Supernovae==

Eight supernovae have been observed in M61, making it one of the most prodigious galaxies for such cataclysmic events. These include:
* SN 1926A (type II, mag. 14) was discovered by Max Wolf and Karl Wilhelm Reinmuth on 9 May 1926.
* SN 1961I (Type II, mag. 13) was discovered by Milton Humason on 3 June 1961.
* SN 1964F (Type II, mag. 14) was discovered by Leonida Rosino on 30 June 1964.
* SN 1999gn (Type II, mag. 16) was discovered by Alessandro Dimai on 17 December 1999.
* SN 2006ov (Type II, mag. 14.9) was discovered by Kōichi Itagaki on 24 November 2006. 
* SN 2008in (Type II, mag. 14.9) was discovered by Kōichi Itagaki on 26 December 2008.
* SN 2014dt (type Ia-pec, mag. 13.6) was discovered by Kōichi Itagaki on 29 October 2014.
* SN 2020jfo (Type II, mag. 16) was discovered by the Zwicky Transient Facility on 6 May 2020.

<text>Egmond () is a former municipality in the north-western Netherlands, in the province of North Holland. In 2001, it was merged with the municipalities of Schoorl and Bergen to form the municipality of Bergen. The three main villages in the former municipality are Egmond aan den Hoef, Egmond aan Zee and Egmond-Binnen. The place gave its name to the House of Egmond, who became the powerful protectors of Egmond Abbey, founded in the 9th-century in Egmond-Binnen, and who built their residence (&quot;hoeve/hoef&quot;) in Egmond aan den Hoef.

The French philosopher René Descartes, author of &quot;Meditations on First Philosophy&quot;, lived in both Egmond aan den Hoef and (mostly) Egmond-Binnen from April 1636 to September 1638 and again from May 1643 until the end of September 1649 before leaving for Sweden (where he died 4 months later). His &quot;Les Météores&quot;, &quot;La Dioptrique&quot; and &quot;La Géométrie&quot; were published in the first period and his letters to Elisabeth of the Palatinate and &quot;Les Passions de l&#x27;âme&quot; were from the second period. Descartes lived longer in Egmond than in any other place in his life.

<text>The matheme (, from &quot;lesson&quot;) is a concept introduced in the work of the 20th century French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan. The term matheme &quot;occurred for the first time in the lecture Lacan delivered on November 4th, 1971 [...] Between 1972 and 1973 he gave several definitions of it, passing from the use of the singular to the use of the plural and back again&quot;.

==Characteristics==

David Macey writes in his introduction to the translation of Lacan&#x27;s &quot;The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis&quot; that &quot;Lacan saw his &quot;matheme&quot; as something that would ensure the integral transmission of his teachings ... proof against the &quot;noise&quot; or interference inherent in any process of communication&quot;. They are formulae, designed as symbolic representations of his ideas and analyses. They were intended to introduce some degree of technical rigour in philosophical and psychological writing, replacing the often hard-to-understand verbal descriptions with formulae resembling those used in the hard sciences, and as an easy way to hold, remember, and rehearse some of the core ideas of both Freud and Lacan. For example: &quot;$&lt;&gt;a&quot; is the matheme for fantasy in the Lacanian sense, in which &quot;$&quot; refers to the subject as split into the subject of utterance and uttered subject (hence the matheme is a barred S), &quot;a&quot; stands for the object-cause of desire, and &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; stands for the relationship between the two.

A more complex set of mathemes are Lacan&#x27;s &quot;formulae of sexuation&quot; which he outlined in the March 13, 1973, session of his &quot;Seminar XX&quot;. Composed of two pairs of propositions written in a unique logico-mathematical shorthand inspired by Gottlob Frege, one pair was dubbed &#x27;masculine&#x27; and the other &#x27;feminine.&#x27; These formulae Lacan originally constructed from Aristotelian logic over the course of an entire year of study. The &quot;matheme&quot;, for Lacan, is not simply the imitation of science by philosophy, but the ideal of a perfect means for the integral transmission of knowledge. Natural language, with its constant &quot;metonymic slide&quot;, fails here, where mathematics succeeds. Contemporary philosopher Alain Badiou identifies &quot;matheme&quot; with the scientific procedure.

==Criticism==

Though sometimes disparaged as a case of &quot;physics envy&quot; or accused of introducing false rigor into a discipline that is more literary theory than hard science, there is also something of a sense of humor in Lacan&#x27;s formulas: of one &#x27;sigla which I have introduced in the form of an algorithm&#x27;, Lacan himself has declared that &#x27;it is created to allow for a hundred and one different readings, a multiplicity that is admissible as long as the spoken remains caught in its algebra&#x27;.

Serge Leclaire, who is one of the most respected and distinguished of all French analysts, remarked in 1975, for example, that whilst the mathemes might have a certain pedagogic utility, they were basically no more than &quot;graffiti&quot;&#x27;.

<text>John Nepomucene Neumann (, , ; March 28, 1811 – January 5, 1860) was a Bohemian-born American prelate of the Catholic Church.

An immigrant from Bohemia, he came to the United States in 1836, where he was ordained, joined the Redemptorist order, and became the fourth Bishop of Philadelphia in 1852. In Philadelphia, Neumann founded the first Catholic diocesan school system in the US. Canonized in 1977, he is the only male US citizen to be named a saint.

==Early life and education==

Neumann&#x27;s father, Philip Neumann, a stocking knitter from Obernburg am Main, moved to Prachatitz in the Kingdom of Bohemia (then part of the Austrian Empire, now in the Czech Republic) in 1802 at age 28 with his wife, Antonie Strakotinská. Antonie died in November 1804, together with the child she bore. He married the daughter of a Czech harness maker, Agnes Lepší, on July 17, 1805, and Neumann was the third of their six children: Catherine, Veronica, John, Joan, Louise, and Wenceslaus (or Wenzel).

Neumann was born on March 18, 1811, and was baptized in the village church on the same day. He began his education in the town school when he was 6, and was a studious and hardworking child, whose mother called him &quot;my little bibliomaniac&quot; for his love of books and reading. Neumann spoke German at home and at school, and was only passably acquainted in his childhood with Czech.

At age 10, Neumann&#x27;s parents told him they were prepared to allow him to continue his studies after grammar school, whereas most boys of that time would soon have to begin work. The catechist of Prachatitz helped prepare boys who hoped to pursue higher studies by offering them evening lessons in Latin at his home, which Neumann attended with eight or ten other boys for the last two years of his term at grammar school. In the autumn of 1823, Neumann passed the entrance examination with distinction for a school in Budweis which was operated by the Piarist Fathers.

===Adolescence===
Neumann entered the school in a class of 103 students, of whom less than fifty ultimately completed the six-year gymnasium course. The curriculum included Latin, mathematics, geography, history, and Christian doctrine in the first four years and was devoted to Latin and Greek classical authors in the last two years. Neumann was disappointed with the course&#x27;s slow pace in his first years and thought he might easily have been able to advance to the third year, but this was not allowed. In the middle of the third year, Neumann&#x27;s professor was dismissed for appearing before a public gathering while drunk and was replaced with a much stricter man who was resolved to make up for lost time and was very inclined to teaching by rote learning, a method Neumann disliked. The pace now became too fast for many students, and about twenty of Neumann&#x27;s classmates dropped out, but he persevered and passed the examination that year with a fair average, as he had the two previous years.

Neumann&#x27;s grades suffered in the fourth year while he was boarding in Budweis with a woman whose son disturbed him in his studies. Neumann&#x27;s father, observing that he seemed to have lost interest in his studies, initially encouraged him to stay home and choose a trade. Still, his mother and his sister Veronica pressured him to persevere in his studies. His father&#x27;s ideas changed upon having a professor who happened to be vacationing in Prachatitz examine his son and finding Neumann had made greater academic progress than his grades revealed. Upon moving to a new boarding house where he could enjoy greater solitude and quiet, Neumann&#x27;s grades distinctly improved, except in his only weak subject, mathematics. Though the professor of classics was even stricter than the second mentor, Neumann found the study of the humanities very agreeable and achieved the highest grades of his career up to that time in his final term at the gymnasium. Neumann&#x27;s hobbies at this time included playing the guitar and making images with a pantograph.

After completing the gymnasium course in 1829, Neumann began two years of study in philosophy in the same building but under different instructors, the Cistercian monks of Hohenfurth Abbey. The subjects taught at the Philosophical Institute included philosophy, religion, higher mathematics, the natural sciences, and Latin philology. Neumann attained a better than fair average in philosophy, philology, and mathematics, fully overcoming his earlier weakness in the latter. He excelled in botany and astronomy, forming a club with fellow students to discuss scientific subjects in their spare time.

Upon graduating from the philosophical course in the late summer of 1831, Neumann was faced with becoming a physician, a lawyer, or a priest. Finding himself with more of a taste for science and secular poetry than theology and the mystics, and discouraged by the difficulty of admission to the seminary, especially with no influential friends to recommend him, Neumann was initially inclined to study medicine, and his father was prepared to pay the tuition for medical school. His mother, however, sensing that his real desire was to be a priest, encouraged him to apply to the seminary even without testimonials from influential people, and to his surprise, he was accepted.

===Seminary studies===
Neumann entered the seminary of the Diocese of Budweis on November 1, 1831. Neumann&#x27;s first two years studying theology were happy, stimulating days for him. Studying ecclesiastical history, Biblical archaeology, and introduction to and exegesis of the Old Testament in his first year, he received the highest possible grade, &quot;eminentem&quot;, in every subject, including diligence and conduct. At the end of his first year, he was one of the few men in his class permitted to take tonsure and minor orders. In his second year at Budweis, Neumann studied Biblical hermeneutics, philology, Greek, pedagogy, introduction to and exegesis of the New Testament, and canon law. His grades were again very good, receiving the highest grade in every subject except in one semester when he received the second-highest possible grade in pedagogy. In his spare time, he began to study French and worked to improve his command of Italian, which he had started to learn during his philosophy course, and of Czech.

In his second year studying theology, Neumann began to read the reports of the Leopoldine Society on the need for priests in the United States, especially to serve the German-speaking communities there. Inspired by a dramatic lecture given by the seminary director on the missionary activities of Paul the Apostle, Neumann and his friend Adalbert Schmidt both made up their minds to devote their lives to the missions after completing their seminary studies. Neither said a word to the other until Schmidt revealed his plan a few weeks later to Neumann, who teased his friend for the whole month before finally admitting, &quot;I am going with you.&quot;

Neumann&#x27;s intention to go to America made it necessary to learn English, but there was no opportunity to do so in Budweis. The Bishop of Budweis had the privilege of sending two of his seminarians each year to study at the archiepiscopal seminary connected with the University of Prague. In the spring of 1833, Neumann successfully petitioned the bishop to continue his study of theology there, where he hoped to learn French and, more importantly, English. There is some indication that Neumann began to attend the university&#x27;s lectures in French, but this became impossible when the state imposed new regulations in 1834 forbidding seminarians to go out for walks except for four hours a week, two on Tuesday afternoon and two on Thursday. Nevertheless, Neumann continued to study French independently and presented himself for the examination, managing to pass with a very high grade despite not attending all of the lectures. Neumann was disappointed that the university did not offer classes in English but studied independently from a book and by engaging in conversation with some English workmen at a nearby factory. After a year, he was capable of writing portions of his diary in English.

Neumann found the lectures in Prague disagreeable because of the Febronian views of his professors, which Neumann regarded as heterodox. The lector in dogmatic theology, , denied papal infallibility, which Neumann supported in a treatise he sent on the question to an inquiring friend in Budweis, though there is no evidence Neumann openly opposed Zeidler in class. Neumann said of Zeidler that he enjoyed too little reputation with the students to do them much harm. Neumann privately studied the &quot;Roman Catechism&quot;, the works of Robert Bellarmine and Peter Canisius, and the works of the Church Fathers, especially Augustine of Hippo and Gregory the Great. Neumann&#x27;s grades at the end of the 1833–1834 academic year were once again very high, though not as high as at Budweis. In his final year at Prague, Neumann studied pastoral theology, homiletics, pedagogy, and catechetics. His grades, while good, were the lowest of his four years studying theology. By this time, Neumann was able to use German, Czech, French, English, Spanish, and Italian, as well as Latin and Greek.

==Journey to America==
Adalbert Schmidt, who was continuing his studies in Budweis and still planned to go with Neumann to America as a missionary, told his confessor, Hermann Dichtl, of this intention. Dichtl encouraged this plan and thought to send Neumann to the Diocese of Philadelphia in response to Coadjutor Bishop Francis Kenrick&#x27;s call for two German priests, which Dichtl had learned of through his correspondence with Andreas Räss, the director of a seminary in Strasbourg. However, correspondence between Europe and America was slow, and no definite response regarding Neumann was received from Philadelphia.

Neumann expected to be ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Ernest Růžička at the end of the academic year in 1835, but on June 10, Růžička became seriously ill. Although Neumann returned to Budweis for his canonical examination for the priesthood and very successfully passed, the ordinations delayed by the bishop&#x27;s illness were ultimately canceled because the Diocese of Budweis had more priests than it needed, with some priests ordained the previous year still lacking assignments. It was a blow to Neumann that he would not be ordained before leaving for America, as he would not be able to give the traditional first priestly blessing to his parents, nor have his family present at his first Mass.

Neumann&#x27;s family were shocked and saddened when he returned home and informed them of his intention to become a missionary, and his sisters broke down and cried. In his diary, Neumann wrote that the bishop and canons of the diocese &quot;more or less approved&quot; of his plans to go to America. Dichtl still intended to send both Schmidt and Neumann to Philadelphia, but as the money raised for the trip was barely enough to cover the expenses of one, and the Leopoldine Society was unwilling to provide financial support for the journey without a direct and definite call from the Bishop of Philadelphia, Neumann resolved to go alone. Neumann departed for America on the morning of February 8, 1836, without telling anyone except his sister Veronica that he was leaving Bohemia; his mother thought he was leaving only for another of his journeys to Budweis.

Neumann went to see Bishop Růžička, who gave his blessing for the trip, but did not provide the dimissorial letters Neumann desired. Perplexed by the proceedings but confident that the matter would be straightened out in due course, Neumann departed with 200 francs (about $40) in his purse. Schmidt, who had now decided to remain in Budweis as a diocesan priest, accompanied Neumann as far as Einsiedeln. Neumann arrived on February 16 in Linz, where he was hospitably received and given a letter of introduction by Bishop Gregory Ziegler, and departed on the evening of February 18 for Munich.

In Munich, however, Neumann was introduced to John Henni, who told him that a German priest was no longer needed in Philadelphia. Henni reassured him that there was a great need for German priests in such dioceses as Detroit, New York, and Vincennes, but advised him that it would be better to remain in Europe than to leave without dimissorial letters. The next morning, a professor at the University of Munich advised Neumann to get in touch with Bishop Simon Bruté of Vincennes, who was then in Europe recruiting missionaries for his diocese. Henni provided Neumann with Bishop Bruté&#x27;s address in Paris, where a letter could be expected to reach him by the time he returned there around Easter.

Neumann arrived in Strasbourg at midnight, February 26, where Canon Räss confirmed his no longer being needed in Philadelphia. Räss also revealed that he had no money to give Neumann, who did not have enough for the journey overseas, as the money that had been intended for Neumann had been given to some other missionaries from Alsace-Lorraine. However, Räss promised to introduce Neumann to a rich merchant in Paris who was greatly interested in missionaries and would undoubtedly give him a considerable sum and to write to Bishop John Dubois of New York urging him to accept the young Bohemian cleric. Neumann could not quite understand the attitude of Räss, who seemed cold and stiff, but he did make Neumann a present of many books. Neumann went on from Strasbourg to Nancy, where he spent four days with the Sisters of St. Charles, some of whom had been brought by Dichtl as novices from Bohemia so that they could return to found a house there, before continuing to Paris by way of Châlons-en-Champagne and Meaux. Another missionary bound for the United States, a priest surnamed Schaefer, was with him on the trip.

Neumann stayed for a whole month in Paris, buying books and seeing the sights. On the Fourth Sunday of Lent, he was able to hear Henri-Dominique Lacordaire preach at Notre-Dame de Paris. Neumann also visited the Panthéon, Montmartre, and the Louvre. Two weeks after Neumann and Schaefer had arrived in Paris, Schaefer received a letter from Bishop Bruté informing him that he would be accepted. Still, three other missionaries who had applied for a place in the Diocese of Vincennes were rejected. Nothing was said of Neumann, whose letter to Bruté had gone astray. Neumann stayed longer, hoping to receive other news or meet Bruté personally when he came to Paris. Still, as the weeks went on, Neumann was uneasy, as his finances were very strained, and the money Räss had promised from the rich merchant did not materialize. Finally, Neumann decided to wait no longer and sail to America since he was confident German-speaking missionaries would be needed there. If he could not find acceptance in New York, he would seek an assignment in Vincennes, Detroit, or St. Louis, and if these efforts failed, he would return to New York and wait there until his services were required.

On Easter Tuesday, Neumann left Paris and arrived in Le Havre shortly after noon, April 7, 1836. It was the first time in his life that he had seen the ocean. Neumann chose to sail on the largest vessel sailing out of Le Havre, a 210-foot three-master with a sixty-foot beam named the &quot;Europa&quot;, because it seemed less crowded with passengers than other ships. It took Neumann four days to get aboard, which he spent praying in the parish church, reading Francis de Sales&#x27; &quot;Introduction to the Devout Life&quot;, and practicing his English and French with the locals. The voyage lasted forty days. Neumann was seasick for three days but felt better afterward. For three more days, the ship was becalmed and made no progress; when the boat came within sight of icebergs off the banks of Newfoundland, Neumann was chilled by the thought of what might happen if the ship should crash into one of them.

==Priesthood==

===Arrival and ordination===

The passengers came within sight of land on May 28, 1836, which was the eve of Trinity Sunday. The ship remained outside New York Harbor for another three days waiting for bad weather to abate and for some sick people aboard to recover lest quarantine officials require the captain to transport them back to Europe. Neumann, anxious to get ashore, was refused permission to disembark by the captain six times before he was finally let off in a rowboat on which he went to Staten Island. Several hours later, he took the small steamer &quot;Hercules&quot; to lower Manhattan. An hour before noon on the feast of Corpus Christi, Neumann stepped ashore with one tattered suit of clothes and one dollar in his pocket. Neumann immediately sought out a Catholic church, and a Swiss innkeeper directed him to one where the pastor, Joseph A. Schneller, gave him the address of Bishop Dubois and John Raffeiner, the vicar-general of the Germans in New York, to whom Neumann went straightaway.

Neumann was glad to learn from Raffeiner that a note had been sent to Canon Räss three weeks before saying he had been accepted as a priest for the Diocese of New York. Together, they went to the home of Bishop Dubois, who was urgently in need of German pastors. Dubois greeted Neumann and, having sufficient guarantees of Neumann&#x27;s education in Europe, told him to immediately prepare for ordination. Neumann asked for some time for immediate preparation, which the bishop granted, as he was set to leave for a visitation. When Neumann told the bishop that he had no dimissorial letters, Dubois swept that difficulty aside, saying, &quot;I can and must ordain you quickly for I need you.&quot; Raffeiner took Neumann to his parish, St. Nicholas Kirche, and put him to work teaching catechism to the children preparing for their First Communion.

Dubois called Neumann for ordination seventeen days after his arrival, ordaining him at St. Patrick&#x27;s Old Cathedral to the subdiaconate on June 19, the diaconate on Friday, June 24, and the priesthood on June 25. Neumann celebrated his first Mass the next morning, Sunday, June 26, at St. Nicholas. &quot;Oh Jesus, You poured out the fullness of your grace over me yesterday. You made me a priest and gave me the power to offer You up to God. Ah! God! This is too much for my soul! Angels of God, all you saints of heaven, come down and adore my Jesus because what my heart says is only the imperfect echo of what Holy Church tells me to say.&quot; He resolved, &quot;I will pray to You that You may give to me holiness, and to all the living and the dead, pardon, that someday we may all be together with You, our dearest God!&quot;

===Diocesan priest in New York===

The Diocese of New York at that time encompassed all of the State of New York and the upper third of New Jersey. The diocese at that time was home to 200,000 Catholics whose numbers were rapidly being swelled by immigrants, for whom sufficient churches and priests were lacking. The diocese had thirty-three churches and several oratories, while fifty private homes served as temporary places of worship for lack of more suitable buildings. The diocese had thirty-six priests, of whom thirty-one were Irish and only three German, and needed at least fifteen priests more. Dubois, who Räss had informed that Neumann and his friends Adalbert Schmidt and John Savel all wanted to go to the American missions, was disappointed when only one man arrived. Still, his German parishes were growing quickly, and one was better than nothing.

The Catholic hierarchy had been established in the United States only five decades earlier with the appointment of John Carroll as prefect-apostolic and then Bishop of Baltimore, and until 1908, all of the United States was still regarded in the Catholic Church as mission territory under the jurisdiction of the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith (or Propaganda). There were no parishes in the strict sense, and in his own writings, Neumann always observed correct technical usage in referring to a portion of a diocese as a &quot;mission,&quot; &quot;congregation,&quot; or &quot;quasi-parish.&quot; However, places where he worked are often described by more recent writers as parishes.

After his ordination, Dubois assigned Neumann to assist Alexander Pax in serving recent German immigrants in the Buffalo area. The more senior priest there, John Nicholas Mertz, was in Europe raising funds. Neumann departed on a Hudson River liner with new clothes given to him by Raffeiner and the bishop&#x27;s funds for his travel expenses on June 28. Dubois wished Neumann to stop at Rochester before continuing to Buffalo. The German Catholics in Rochester were then holding services in the basement of St. Patrick&#x27;s Church under the direction of Bernard O&#x27;Reilly. Still, as most of the Catholics in that area were Irish, they raised funds to build a separate church where they could be served in their native language.

The German Catholics in Rochester were delighted by a German-speaking priest&#x27;s arrival, and some planned to write to Bishop Dubois asking him to assign Neumann there permanently. Neumann began to teach the children, whom he found sadly neglected and unable to speak either German or English correctly and celebrate the sacraments. After administering his first baptism, he wrote in his journal, &quot;If the child I baptized today dies in the grace of this sacrament, then my journey to America has been repaid a million times, even though I do nothing for the rest of my life.&quot; On the evening of Neumann&#x27;s first Sunday in Rochester, he was relieved by the German Redemptorist Joseph Prost&#x27;s arrival. The encounter with Prost first excited a desire in him to join the Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer himself, although it was then only a passing thought. Neumann continued on to Buffalo on July 11.

The missions in Buffalo were headquartered at a small church established by Mertz in 1829 known as the Church of the Lamb of God. There were four unfinished churches in the surrounding area at North Bush (the present-day parish of St. John the Baptist, now part of Tonawanda) eight miles to the north, at Williamsville eight miles to the northeast (now the parish of Ss. Peter and Paul), at Cayuga Creek, and thirty miles to the south at Eden. Pax was so grateful to have another priest to assist him in caring for the extensive territory that he offered Neumann any share of the work he desired, whether he preferred to work in the city where many of the faithful were concentrated or in the rural areas where Catholics were more dispersed. Neumann chose to station himself at Williamsville, from which he cared for an area of some twelve to fifteen miles around it where four hundred Catholic families lived, of whom three hundred were German. Because no pastoral residence had been constructed, Neumann took a room in the home of a wealthy benefactor of the mission, Jacob Philip Wirtz.

The partially built church at Williamsville had been founded on land that had been donated to the Catholics on the condition that they would build a stone church, 115 feet long, thirty feet high, and twenty feet wide, a stipulation that was difficult to fulfill because the Catholics in the area were largely poor immigrants who were capable of giving little to the church. Mertz had been able to collect or borrow enough money, stone, and volunteer labor to erect four walls, but that was as far as construction had progressed. While Neumann said Mass for the first time in the roofless structure, some non-Catholics from the area threw stones into the church, one of which landed on the altar. Neumann completed this structure, inducing Wirtz to remit a loan he had made of $400 on the condition that a memorial Mass be said for him every year after his death.

A little school was conducted in a neighboring house by a lay teacher appointed by Mertz. Still, Neumann, finding the man&#x27;s conduct unsatisfactory, dismissed him and took up the task of teaching himself, two hours in the morning and two hours in the afternoon, until securing the services of another teacher seven months later. Neumann was a gifted teacher, and his students fondly remembered his stories in catechism class years later. He would often reward good students with small gifts, and when teaching the children to sing in the liturgy, he would induce those who complained of sore throats to return to singing with rock candy, of which he seemed to have an inexhaustible supply. Neumann again had a school after moving his headquarters to North Bush in 1837 and was erecting a third schoolhouse at Lancaster by December 1839.

Although Neumann&#x27;s principal missions were Williamsville, Lancaster, and North Bush, he was soon caring for Transit, Sheldon, Batavia, Pendleton, and Tonawanda. For over four years, he was always on the move, traveling on foot often over swampy ground, from station to station, from house to house, in the biting cold of winter and the heat of summer, visiting the sick, aiding the dying, baptizing the newborn, instilling faith and zeal into the backsliders. In the three main churches under his care, the baptisms averaged sixty-five a year and the marriages eight. Still, Neumann&#x27;s workload was heavy, particularly in virtue of the considerable distances to be traversed on foot, with a heavy pack on his back containing his vestments. The nearest out-mission was two hours away, the furthest twelve hours, and it was necessary to return home to North Bush almost every night, as there were no accommodations at the outposts, and besides, Neumann needed to be at home to teach every day.

The figure of the short-statured man of God was familiar to all the countryside. Out of pity for his exhausting labors, they soon induced him to take a horse. People laughed at the clumsy way Neumann rode; because he was only , his feet did not reach the stirrups. Once, Neumann found himself thrown off the horse&#x27;s back. On several other occasions when the horse wanted to rid himself of his rider, the animal made for the nearby fences and brushed Neumann&#x27;s legs against them so that the cleric fell ignominiously to the ground. After that, Neumann led the horse along by the bridle instead of riding until he learned to control the stubborn creature. But Neumann did learn to ride, not in the manner of an expert but as a fair horseman. He and his horse eventually became great friends, even though on one occasion the voracious animal ate a precious quantity of botanical specimens the missionary had collected to send home to Bohemia.

Here, Neumann had his first difficulties with lay trusteeism. In many American Catholic congregations, the title to the church property was placed in the hands of lay members who formed a majority of the parish corporation and often sought to act independently of the pastor and contrary to the traditional administration of parish concerns. It took the ecclesiastical hierarchy many years to eradicate the disturbances caused by this system. In Neumann&#x27;s day, the trustees were &quot;the&quot; important people in a parish, and it was vitally important for a pastor to get along well with them. Neumann refrained from open arguments with contentious trustees, and no matter what they said, he would smile and say nothing, which more than one trustee regarded as disrespectful. One of these resentful trustees once spread gossip concerning the propriety of Neumann&#x27;s lodging in the home of Wirtz, which was over a tavern and in a room that could only be entered by going through the room of a young servant girl. One day, Neumann was called down to a meeting of the trustees in the tavern below Wirtz&#x27;s house and informed that the meeting&#x27;s purpose was to decide whether Wirtz should be obliged to dismiss the servant girl. Neumann, astounded though he was, responded with only a wry smile and a quiet disavowal. The trustees were convinced the bashful and holy priest was entirely innocent and blamed the jealous neighbor who wanted Neumann to lodge with his family instead of Wirtz&#x27;s. Soon the man lost prestige in the neighborhood. Nevertheless, the danger of such gossip was not lost on Neumann, and he quietly changed his residence in 1837 to North Bush, though the church was not nearly so good as the one in Williamsville. He accepted free lodgings from a friendly Catholic, John Schmidt, who lived a mile and a half from the church, which Neumann had to walk every morning over an almost impassable road to say his daily Mass.

The move from Williamsville to North Bush came when the entire region was sunk in the direst poverty by the depression that followed upon the Panic of 1837. Many of the area&#x27;s Catholics were without work and often without food and could give little or nothing to support the church. Neumann wrote to a fellow priest in Europe, &quot;If you want to be a missionary, you have to love poverty and be entirely disinterested.&quot; Though he found himself $80 in debt at the end of the first year, he was satisfied that thanks to the people&#x27;s gifts of corn and potatoes; he did not starve. Shortly after the move to North Bush, Bishop Dubois arrived on a visitation tour of the district. He expressed his pleasure upon seeing the more advanced stage of the buildings, the schools, the careful attention to the sick and the dying, and the weekly, even daily rounds made by the young pastor.

In North Bush, the people got together and bought five acres of land close to the church on which Neumann could build a house and grow some vegetables for his support. Neumann worked at times on this and other buildings with his own hands and rejoiced when he moved into the two-room log cabin. After Neumann had his own house, he cooked his meals, and often he missed meals; observers noticed smoke rarely rose from Neumann&#x27;s chimney, meaning the stove was not being used. Once, he lived only on bread for four weeks. People also noticed that when he visited the homes of the faithful, he never asked for a meal. Although Neumann&#x27;s efforts to recruit additional priests from Europe were unsuccessful, in September 1839, Neumann&#x27;s brother Wenzel came from Bohemia to assist him, taking over the cooking and teaching in the school, as well as helping with the construction of the churches, schoolhouses, and rectories. Wenzel brought Neumann the first news he&#x27;d had of his family in three years, for no letter of theirs had reached him since he left Europe. Neumann loved his family intensely, and Wenzel&#x27;s coming to help him was a godsend.

Neumann began to experience spiritual aridity and feared his love for God was growing less fervent. Neumann saw pride in himself though everyone else said he was humble and thought he was slothful. Still, people around Buffalo said long after that he burned himself out making the rounds of his parish. After Neumann discussed his spiritual difficulties with Prost, Prost wrote to him that living alone is difficult, quoting Ecclesiastes, &quot;woe to him who is alone!&quot; Neumann often revolved that thought in his mind, especially in the summer of 1840 when his health broke down completely, and he was unable to do any pastoral work for three months. Neumann declared that he had an intense longing for the company of other priests. Frequent consultations with his confessor, Pax, followed, and after a long time, Pax advised Neumann that it was his vocation to become a religious.

On September 4, 1840, Neumann wrote to Prost, the Redemptorists&#x27; superior in America, asking for admission to the Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer. Receiving a favorable reply from Prost on September 16, Neumann immediately wrote to Bishop John Hughes, acquainting him with his desire to enter the Redemptorists and asking him to send one or more priests to take over the churches outside Buffalo. Unbeknownst to Neumann, the bishop was on visitation, so no reply was forthcoming. Still, leaving the negotiations with Hughes in Pax and Prost&#x27;s hands as they advised, Neumann left the Buffalo area on October 8 or 9, 1840. When Hughes learned of the matter, he was not at all inclined to allow a pastor of Neumann&#x27;s caliber to depart from his diocese, but Prost later wrote, &quot;I appealed to canon law and pointed out that I could not refuse to accept him, even if I wished to. The Most Reverend Bishop was obliged to yield.&quot; His brother, Wenzel, stayed to gather up the few belongings that Neumann possessed in the various mission stations and resolved to follow his brother and become a lay brother of the Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer.

===Redemptorist novitiate===

The Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer, popularly known as the Redemptorists, had been founded in Naples in 1732 by Alphonsus Liguori, and had grown only slowly during its founder&#x27;s lifetime. Clement Hofbauer established the Congregation north of the Alps. Joseph Passerat, who ran the Congregation from 1820 to 1848, dispatched the first Redemptorist missionaries to America in 1832. They had secured their first foundation in Pittsburgh in April 1839, taking over St. Philomena&#x27;s Church. When Neumann joined them, they had four foundations: St. Philomena&#x27;s in Pittsburgh, St. John&#x27;s in Baltimore, St. Joseph&#x27;s in Rochester, and St. Alphonsus&#x27; in Norwalk, Ohio.

Neumann arrived in Pittsburgh and presented himself to the Redemptorists on the morning of Sunday, October 18, 1840, where he was invited on the first day to sing the High Mass and preach, which he did despite the fatigue of his long journey from Buffalo. The matter of dimissorial letters having been straightened out with Bishop Hughes, Prost hurried to Pittsburgh to invest Neumann with the Redemptorist habit. As this was the first investiture of a Redemptorist in the New World, the Fathers wished to make it a solemn occasion. Unfortunately, they lacked the ritual of the prescribed ceremonies and prayers, as their only copies of these had been destroyed in a fire in New York. Drawing on their memories of their investitures, they devised a suitable ceremony and proceeded to clothe him in the Redemptorist habit.

He took his religious vows as a member of the congregation in Baltimore, in January 1842. While a novice for the Redemptorists, he served at St. Alphonsus Church in Peru Township, Huron County, Ohio for five months before returning to New York. He was naturalized as a United States citizen in Baltimore on February 10, 1848. He served as the pastor of St. Augustine Church in Elkridge, Maryland, from 1849 to 1851.

===Redemptorist superior===

After six years of difficult but fruitful work in Maryland, Neumann became the Provincial Superior for the United States. He also served as parish priest at St. Alphonsus Church in Baltimore.

==Bishop of Philadelphia==

On February 5, 1852, the Holy See appointed Neumann Bishop of Philadelphia. His predecessor in that office, Francis Kenrick (who had become Archbishop of Baltimore), presided over the consecration on March 28, and Bishop Bernard O&#x27;Reilly assisted. The consecration was held in St. Alphonsus Church, Baltimore.

Philadelphia had a large and expanding Catholic immigrant population; Germans who fled the Napoleonic and other Continental wars had been followed by Irish fleeing the Great Famine caused by the potato blight and wars. Soon Italians and other southern and eastern European Catholics would arrive. Some settled in the diocese&#x27;s rural parts, similar to the rural areas of New York state where Neumann had begun his ministry, but many stayed in the city. At the time, Philadelphia was one of the largest cities in the country.

It was an industrializing mercantile hub with many jobs for people with little command of the English language. The waves of immigration resulted in tensions in the city with native-born residents, who had to compete for work in difficult economic times. Anti-Catholic riots took place in the 1830s and 1844, in the Philadelphia Nativist Riots, occurring as Irish Catholics began to arrive in significant numbers in the city. Soon more riots occurred, mainly since the town was a stronghold of the Know-Nothing political party, known for its anti-immigrant and anti-Catholic prejudices. Bishop Neumann introduced the first Forty Hours Devotion at the Church of St. Philip Neri on May 26, 1853, the Feast of Corpus Christi, in honor of the church&#x27;s patron, despite the hostility of the Know Nothings.

During Neumann&#x27;s administration, new parish churches were completed at the rate of nearly one per month. To encourage savings and to support the financial needs of the Catholic community in Philadelphia, he directed the creation of a mutual savings bank, Beneficial Bank, in 1853. As many immigrants settled in close communities from their hometowns and with speakers of the same language, churches became associated with immigrants from particular regions. They were known as national parishes. Their parishioners often did not speak English or know how to obtain needed social services.

Neumann was particularly committed to providing educational opportunities to immigrant children. He became the first bishop to organize a diocesan school system, as Catholic parents wanted their children taught in the Catholic tradition. They feared Protestant influence and discrimination in public schools. 
Under his administration, the number of parochial schools in his diocese increased from one to 200. His 1852 catechisms became standard texts.

Neumann&#x27;s fluency in several languages endeared him to the many new immigrant communities in Philadelphia. As well as ministering to newcomers in his native German, Neumann also spoke Italian fluently. A growing congregation of Italian-speakers received pastoral care in his private chapel, and Neumann eventually established in Philadelphia the first Italian national parishes in the country.

Neumann actively invited religious institutes to establish new houses within the diocese to provide necessary social services. In 1855, Neumann supported the foundation of a congregation of religious sisters in the city, the Sisters of St. Francis of Philadelphia. He brought the School Sisters of Notre Dame from Germany to assist in religious instruction and staff an orphanage. He also intervened to save the Oblate Sisters of Providence from dissolution; this congregation of African-American women was founded by Haitian refugees in Baltimore.

The large diocese was not wealthy, and Neumann became known for his personal frugality. He kept and wore only one pair of boots throughout his residence in the United States. When given a new set of vestments as a gift, he would often use them to outfit the newest ordained priest in the diocese. Discouraged by conflict as well as anti-Catholic riots and arson of religious buildings, Neumann wrote to Rome asking to be replaced as bishop, but Pope Pius IX insisted that he continue.

===Trip to Rome and Bohemia===

In 1854, Neumann traveled to Rome and was present at St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica on December 8, when Pius IX solemnly defined, &quot;ex cathedra&quot;, the dogma of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary. He visited Prachatice for a week from February 3, 1855. Although he wanted this to be done quietly, the citizens greeted him lavishly on arrival. The visit is noted next to his baptismal record in the parish register alongside a later pencil note about his canonisation in 1977.

===Death===

While doing errands on Thursday, January 5, 1860, Neumann collapsed and died of a heart attack. He was 48 years old. He was buried, per his request, at St. Peter&#x27;s Church beneath the undercroft floor directly below the high altar.

Bishop James Frederick Wood, a Philadelphia native who converted to Catholicism in Cincinnati in 1836 and who had been appointed Neumann&#x27;s coadjutor with right of succession in 1857, succeeded Neumann as Bishop of Philadelphia.

==Veneration==

The cause for Neumann&#x27;s beatification was formally opened on 15 December 1896, granting him the title of Servant of God. Neumann was declared venerable by Pope Benedict XV on December 11, 1921. He was beatified by Pope Paul VI during the Second Vatican Council on October 13, 1963, and was canonized by that same pope on June 19, 1977. His feast days are January 5, the date of his death, on the Roman calendar for the church in the United States of America, and June 19 in the Czech Republic.

After his canonization, the National Shrine of Saint John Neumann was constructed at the Parish of St. Peter the Apostle, at 5th Street and Girard Avenue in Philadelphia. The remains of John Neumann rest under the altar of the shrine within a glass-walled reliquary.

==Legacy==
In 1980, Our Lady of the Angels College, founded by the congregation of Franciscan Sisters he had founded and located within the archdiocese, was renamed Neumann College. It was granted university status by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 2009.

The St. John Neumann Education Trust was established in 2017 in the Diocese of Manchester, New Hampshire, for the advancement of Catholic education in the state of New Hampshire.

A street is named after him in his hometown of Prachatice.

==Jubilee year==
In 2011, the Redemptorist Fathers celebrated the 200th anniversary of the birth of Neumann. The Closing Mass for the Neumann Year was held on June 23, 2012, in Philadelphia.

<text>The University of Graz (, formerly: &quot;Karl-Franzens-Universität Graz&quot;) is a public research university located in Graz, Austria. It is the largest and oldest university in Styria, as well as the second-largest and second-oldest university in Austria. The university is associated with numerous Nobel prize laureates and is highly regarded.

== History ==

The university was founded in 1585 by Archduke Charles II of Austria. The bull of 1 January 1586, published on 15 April 1586, was approved by Pope Sixtus V. For most of its existence it was controlled by the Catholic Church, and was closed in 1782 by Emperor Joseph II in an attempt to gain state control over educational institutions. Joseph II transformed it into a &quot;lyceum&quot;, where civil servants and medical personnel were trained. In 1827 it was re-instituted as a university by Emperor Francis I, thus gaining the name &quot;Karl-Franzens-Universität&quot;, meaning &quot;Charles Francis University&quot;. About 30,000 students are currently enrolled at the university.

== Academics ==
The university is divided into six faculties, the two largest are the Faculty of Arts and Humanities and the Faculty of Natural Sciences. The other faculties are the Faculty of Law; the Faculty of Business, Economic and Social sciences; the Faculty of Environmental, Regional and Educational Sciences; and the Faculty of Catholic Theology. The Faculty of Medicine was separated from the university by state legislation in 2004 and became an independent university – the Medical University of Graz. The faculties offer a wide range of undergraduate (BA, BSc), graduate (MA, MSc), and doctoral degree (PhD) programmes, as well as special teaching degrees in their specific areas of expertise.

Since its re-installation, the university has been home to many internationally renowned scientists and thinkers. Ludwig Boltzmann was professor at the university twice, first from 1869 to 1873 and then from 1876 to 1890, while he was developing his statistical theory of heat. Nobel laureate Otto Loewi taught at the university from 1909 until 1938 and Victor Franz Hess (Nobel prize 1936) graduated in Graz and taught there from 1920 to 1931 and from 1937 to 1938. The physicist Erwin Schrödinger briefly was chancellor of the university in 1936.

The University of Graz does not have a distinct faculty of engineering, however, Graz University of Technology, which is focused on engineering and technology, offers inter-university undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in cooperation with the university&#x27;s Faculty of Natural Sciences under the name &quot;NAWI Graz&quot;. The main intention behind the cooperation was to avoid duplication of efforts and infrastructure, especially in cost-intensive subjects such as chemistry, industrial chemistry, physics, and geosciences, as both universities are located in close proximity to each other. Students enrolled in one of these programmes attend lectures and seminars at both universities and are awarded a combined degree at the end of their studies. Along with the NAWI collaboration, the university is cooperating with the TU Graz to combine their two physics institutes into one, the Graz Center of Physics. The project is planned to be finished in 2030 and located on the campus of the University of Graz instead of the former Vorklinik.

Since Graz was the capital of the then multiethnic Duchy of Styria, Slovenes from Lower Styria came there to study. It has served as a gateway to South-East Europe for Austrian scholars, scientists and businesses. The establishment of the Department for Slovene Language and Literature at the University of Graz, for example, laid the foundation for scholarly studies of Slovenian culture, literature, and language bundled in the so-called Slovene studies.

== Organization ==
The university has 6 faculties. Each of the 6 faculties is in turn divided into institutes and centers: 

# Faculty of Humanities
# Faculty of Catholic theology
# Faculty of Natural Sciences
# Faculty of Law
# Faculty of Social and economic sciences
# Faculty of Environmental, regional and educational sciences

In addition to the institutes and centers of the 6 faculties, there are other university and cross-faculty service areas:

# Center for Digital Teaching and Learning
# Center for teaching competence
# Center for Pedagog:ic Education
# Center for Regional Sciences
# Center for Social Competence
# Center for Southeast European Studies
# the 7th faculty - center for society, knowledge and communication
# Doctoral Academy Graz
# Habilitation Forum Subject Didactics &amp;amp; Teaching Research
# IDea_Lab - The interdisciplinary digital lab of the University of Graz
# Confucius Institute
# Coordination Office for Gender Studies and Equality
# treffpunkt sprachen - Center for Language, Plurilingualism and Subject Didactics
# University Museums
# Vestigia - Center for the Study of Book and Scripture Heritage
# Polar Research Station Sermilik, Greenland

==International acclaim==
The university ranks highest in Arts and Humanities, coming 287th in the 2018 QS World University Rankings, whereas all other subject areas lag behind, with the Faculty of Social Sciences ranking at 451–500 and the Faculty of Natural Sciences ranking at 401–450.

== Religious affiliation ==
Historically speaking, for most of its existence the University of Graz was controlled by the Catholic Church. Even after its re-installation in 1827, it took until 1848 for the university&#x27;s basic principles to be readjusted in accordance with the ideals of Wilhelm von Humboldt and the Enlightenment, meaning that the university became autonomous from the state as well as from the church and their influence as far as possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;history title=History of the University of Graz publisher=University of Graz url=http://archiv.uni-graz.at/de/geschichte/geschichte-der-universitaet&quot;&gt;History of the University of Graz&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Faculty of Catholic Theology has been retained as a part of the university ever since it was established, however, its importance in terms of number of students and its influence on the university board have been diminishing. Evidently, relations between the Catholic Church, especially the local bishop, and the university&#x27;s Faculty of Theology remain strong, yet general policy is not influenced by these connections. To demonstrate the university&#x27;s independence and its shift of focus, the Christogram IHS on the very top of the university&#x27;s seal has been replaced with the sun, symbolising the Enlightenment and von Humboldt&#x27;s ideas.&lt;ref name=&quot;motto/hymn&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

<text>Skellig is a children&#x27;s novel by the British author David Almond, published by Hodder in 1998. It was the Whitbread Children&#x27;s Book of the Year and it won the Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year&#x27;s outstanding children&#x27;s book by a British author. In the US it was a runner up for the Michael L. Printz Award, which recognises one work of young adult fiction annually. Since publication, it has also been adapted into a play, an opera, and a film. In December of 2011, a prequel entitled &quot;My Name is Mina&quot; was published, written by David Almond himself. William Blake poems are also in the book, the play and the film.

Delacorte Press published the first US edition in 1999.

==Plot==
10-year-old Michael and his family have recently moved into a new house. He and his parents are nervous, as his new baby sister (who they have not named yet) was born earlier than expected and may not live because of a heart condition, and because they have to start over in a new home. When Michael goes into the garage, he finds a strange emaciated man hidden amid all the boxes, debris and dead insects. Michael assumes that he is a homeless person, but decides to look after him and gives him food. The man is crotchety and arthritic, demanding aspirin and Chinese food, but Michael helps him anyway. Michael hears a story that human shoulder blades are a vestige of angel wings.

Meanwhile, his new friends from school become more and more distant as Michael stops attending school and spends less time with them in order to figure out more about the strange man. He meets a girl named Mina from across the road who intrigues him; Mina is home-schooled and enjoys nature, birds, drawing and the poems of William Blake. Often drawing or sculpting at home, she invites Michael to join in and the two become friends. She takes care of some baby birds who live in her garden and teaches Michael to hear their tiny sounds. Michael decides to introduce her to the strange man, who shows inhuman attributes and who the two begin to suspect is not human. Michael&#x27;s friends, Leakey and Coot, become skeptical about Michael and try to find out what he is hiding from them. Michael and Mina try to keep it a secret from them, and have to move the creature, who is named &quot;Skellig&quot;, to a safer space.

Michael becomes intrigued with medical conditions like arthritis as his baby sister has been taken to the hospital for her heart condition, and frequently visits her as her condition worsens. The distant, winged Skellig, who remains grumpy and abrasive, finally confirms his name to be Skellig and begins to open up to Mina and Michael.

Michael&#x27;s baby sister comes dangerously close to death, necessitating heart surgery. His mother goes to the hospital to stay with the baby and, that night, &quot;dreams&quot; of seeing Skellig come in, pick the baby up, and hold her high in the air, saving her. He subsequently moves from the garage after saying goodbye to Michael and Mina, answering their questions about his nature by saying that he is &#x27;something&#x27; combining aspects of human, owl and angel.

The family decides to name Michael&#x27;s baby sister since she will now live. After considering naming her after Persephone, a deity whom Mina admires, they settle on Joy because of the joy that her living will bring the family.

==Themes==

&quot;Skellig&quot; is deliberately ambiguous about its title character. Almond has provided public answers to some frequent questions from his school visits. The names &quot;Skellig&quot; and &quot;Michael&quot; are derived from the Skellig Islands off the coast of County Kerry, Ireland. One of them is Skellig Michael Island; St Michael is also the name of an archangel. 

Almond has acknowledged the influence of &quot;A Very Old Man with Enormous Wings&quot;, a short story by Gabriel García Márquez. Paul Latham compares the works in a research article, &quot;Magical Realism and the Child Reader: The Case of David Almond&#x27;s &quot;Skellig&quot;&quot;. Despite many similarities, he notes that Almond&#x27;s child protagonists are much more caring and accepting than the closed-minded and sometimes cruel adults in the García Márquez story. Also, Mina and Michael keep Skellig a secret from the rest of human society. Thus the negative social commentary in &quot;Skellig&quot;, regarding medical institutions and other aspects of adult society, is not as harsh as in Márquez&#x27;s story.

==Prequel==

Hodder published Almond&#x27;s 300-page prequel to &quot;Skellig&quot; late in 2010, &quot;My Name is Mina&quot; (). It was one of four books on the 2011 Guardian Award shortlist and one of eight on the 2012 Carnegie shortlist. Both &quot;The Guardian&quot; and the Carnegie panel recommend &quot;Mina&quot; for readers age nine and up. According to children&#x27;s book editor Julia Eccleshare, &quot;Almond promotes and celebrates freedom for children and their thinking in this lyrical book about growing up.&quot;

Delacorte published the US edition in 2011. According to the summary, &quot;Creative, intelligent, nine-year-old Mina keeps a journal in her own disorderly way that reveals how her mind is growing into something extraordinary, especially after she begins homeschooling under the direction of her widowed mother.&quot;

==Adaptations==

===2003 play===

&quot;Skellig&quot; was adapted into a play in 2003 directed by Trevor Nunn who thought it was important to follow the book&#x27;s example of not revealing Skellig&#x27;s exact nature, designed by John Napier. The original play was conceived from the novel to the play at The Young Vic Theatre, London. Cast included in alphabetical order; Ashley Artus, Noma Dumezweni, Akiya Henry, David Threlfall, Kevin Wathen, Mo Zinal. The play was later performed by Playbox Theatre Company in 2008.
In March 2011 the play was performed at the New Victory Theater, New York by The Birmingham Stage Company who previously toured the UK with their production, from 2008 in London and Birmingham. The BSC founder and manager Neal Foster played Skellig.

===2008 opera===

&quot;Skellig&quot; has been adapted into a contemporary opera with music by American composer Tod Machover and libretto by David Almond himself. The opera was staged at The Sage Gateshead from 4 November to 19 December 2008, with accompaniment by the Northern Sinfonia.
The Opera starred Omar Ebrahim as Skellig with Sophie Daneman and Paul Keohone as Michael&#x27;s parents.

===2009 film===

&quot;Skellig&quot;, produced by Feel Films, was part of Sky 1&#x27;s plan to invest £10 million in producing three new high-definition dramas. Filming started on 2 September 2008 in Caerphilly in Wales. The film stars Tim Roth in the title role, Bill Milner as Michael Cooper, Skye Bennett as Mina, and Kelly Macdonald and John Simm as Michael&#x27;s parents (Louise &#x27;Lou&#x27; and Steve Cooper). The screenplay was written by Irena Brignull and filming was directed by Annabel Jankel. The first showing of &quot;Skellig&quot; on Sky 1 was on 12 April 2009.

In 1959, Ciardi published a book on how to read, write, and teach poetry, &quot;How Does a Poem Mean?&quot;, which has proven to be among the most-used books of its kind. At the peak of his popularity in the early 1960s, Ciardi also had a network television program on CBS, &quot;Accent&quot;. Ciardi&#x27;s impact on poetry is perhaps best measured through the younger poets whom he influenced as a teacher and as editor of the &quot;Saturday Review&quot;.

==Biography==
Ciardi was born at home in Boston&#x27;s North End in 1916. His father, an Italian immigrant, died in an automobile accident in 1919, and he was raised by his Italian mother (who was illiterate) and his three older sisters. In 1921, his family moved to Medford, Massachusetts, where he attended public schools. His family members saved enough money to send him to college. He entered Bates College in Lewiston, Maine, before transferring to Tufts University in Boston to study under poet John Holmes. He graduated from Tufts in 1938, and the following year completed his MA at the University of Michigan. At Michigan he was awarded the Hopwood Prize for &quot;Homeward to America&quot;, a poetry collection which he submitted under the pseudonym &quot;Thomas Aquinas&quot;.

Ciardi taught briefly at the University of Kansas City before joining the United States Army Air Forces in 1942, becoming a gunner on B-29s and flying some twenty missions over Japan before being transferred to desk duty in 1945. He was discharged in October 1945 with the rank of Technical Sergeant and with both the Air Medal and Oak Leaf Cluster. Ciardi&#x27;s war diary, &quot;Saipan&quot;, was published posthumously in 1988. After the war, Ciardi returned to UKC for the spring semester 1946, where he met and, on July 28, married Myra Judith Hostetter, a journalist and journalism instructor. Immediately after the wedding, the couple left for a third-floor apartment at Ciardi&#x27;s Medford, Massachusetts home, which his mother and sisters had put together for the man of their family and his new bride.

John Ciardi was a longtime resident of Metuchen, New Jersey. He died on Easter Sunday in 1986 of a heart attack, but not before composing his own epitaph:

&lt;poem&gt;Here, time concurring (and it does);
Lies Ciardi. If no kingdom come,
A kingdom was. Such as it was
This one beside it is a slum.&lt;/poem&gt;

==Literary career==
After the war, Mr. Ciardi returned briefly to Kansas State, before being named instructor [in 1946], and later assistant professor, in the Briggs Copeland chair at Harvard University, where he stayed until 1953. ... While at Harvard, Mr. Ciardi began his long association with the Bread Loaf Writers Conference at Middlebury College in Vermont, where he lectured on poetry for almost 30 years, half that time as director of the program.

Ciardi had published his first book of poems, &quot;Homeward to America&quot;, in 1940, before the war, and his next book, &quot;Other Skies&quot;, focusing on his wartime experiences, was published in 1947. His third book, &quot;Live Another Day&quot;, came out in 1949. In 1950, Ciardi edited a poetry collection, &quot;Mid-Century American Poets&quot;, which identified the best poets of the generation that had come into its own in the 1940s: Richard Wilbur, Muriel Rukeyser, John Frederick Nims, Karl Shapiro, Elizabeth Bishop, Theodore Roethke, Delmore Schwartz, Randall Jarrell, Robert Lowell, Ciardi himself, and several others. Each poet selected several poems for inclusion, plus his or her comments on the poetic principles that guided the compositions, addressing especially the issue of the &quot;unintelligibility&quot; of modern poetry.

Ciardi had begun translating Dante for his classes at Harvard and continued with the work throughout his time there. His translation of &quot;The Inferno&quot; was published in 1954. Dudley Fitts, himself an important mid-century translator, said of Ciardi&#x27;s version, &quot;[H]ere is our Dante, Dante for the first time translated into virile, tense American verse; a work of enormous erudition which (like its original) never forgets to be poetry; a shining event in a bad age.&quot; Joan Acocella (née Ross), however, noted &quot;The constant stretching for a heartier, more modern and American idiom not only vulgarizes; it also guarantees that wherever Dante expresses himself by implication rather than by direct statement, Ciardi will either miss or ignore the nuance.&quot; The translation &quot;is widely used at universities.&quot; Ciardi&#x27;s translation of &quot;The Purgatorio&quot; followed in 1961 and &quot;The Paradiso&quot; in 1970. Ciardi&#x27;s version of &quot;The Inferno&quot; was recorded and released by Folkways Records in 1954. Two years later, Ciardi would have his work featured again on an album titled, &quot;As If: Poems, New and Selected, by John Ciardi&quot;.

In 1953, Ciardi joined the English Department at Rutgers University in order to begin a writing program, but after eight successful years there, he resigned his professorship in 1961 in favor of several other more lucrative careers, especially fall and spring tours on the college lecture circuit, and to &quot;devote himself fulltime to literary pursuits.&quot; (When he left Rutgers, he famously quipped that teaching was &quot;planned poverty.&quot;) He was popular enough and interesting enough to warrant a pair of appearances in the early 1960s on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;. He was the poetry editor of the &quot;Saturday Review&quot; from 1956 to 1972. In 1962 Ciardi wrote an editorial critical of the government&#x27;s efforts to censor Henry Miller&#x27;s &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot;, which the book&#x27;s publisher Barney Rosset, engaged in defense against legal action across the country, later acknowledged for its impact on public opinion, aiding the defense in the jury trials that followed. He wrote the 1959 poetry textbook &quot;How Does a Poem Mean?&quot; Ciardi was a &quot;fellow of the National Academy of Arts and Sciences and a member and former president of the National Institute of Arts and Letters.&quot; He was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto.

For the last decade of his life, he reported on word histories on National Public Radio&#x27;s &quot;Morning Edition&quot;, as an outgrowth of his series of books of etymologies, &quot;A Browser&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; (1980), &quot;A Second Browser&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; (1983) and &quot;Good Words to You&quot; (posthumously published in 1987). The weekly three-minute spot on etymology was called &quot;Word In Your Ear&quot;. He also taught at the University of Florida.
Among 20th-century American men of letters, he maintained a notably high profile and level of popularity with the general public, as well as a reputation for considerable craftsmanship in his output. Burton Raffel summed up Ciardi&#x27;s career: &quot;Blessed with a fine voice, a ready wit, and a relentless honesty, Ciardi became in many ways an archetype of the existentially successful twentieth-century American poet, peripatetic, able to fit into and exploit chinks in the great American scheme of things, while never fitting in as either a recognized peg or hole.&quot;

==Legacy==
Critic and poet Kenneth Rexroth described Ciardi as &quot;... singularly unlike most American poets with their narrow lives and feuds. He is more like a very literate, gently appetitive, Italo-American airplane pilot, fond of deep simple things like his wife and kids, his friends and students, Dante&#x27;s verse and good food and wine.&quot; &quot;During his years at Bread Loaf and at the &quot;Saturday Review&quot;, Ciardi established a reputation as a tough, sometimes harsh, critic.&quot; &quot;His review of Anne Morrow Lindbergh&#x27;s 1956 book &quot;The Unicorn and Other Poems&quot; touched off what the &quot;Review&#x27;s editor&quot;, Norman Cousins, described as &quot;the biggest storm of reader protest&quot; in the magazine&#x27;s history.&quot; &quot;Ciardi defended his stand, noting that it was &quot;the reviewer&#x27;s duty to damn&quot; when warranted.&quot; In similar circumstances, Ciardi &quot;described Robert Frost&#x27;s &#x27;Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening&#x27; as expressing the death wish of its speaker&quot;. May Sarton, for example, accused Ciardi of &quot;hat[ing her] guts and [of doing] everything he could to destroy [her]&quot; in describing the difficulties faced by women poets.

Working for the &quot;Saturday Review&quot; while overseas, Ciardi sent Harold Norse&#x27;s poem, &quot;Victor Emmanuel Monument (Rome)&quot;, back to the U.S. to be published in the April 13, 1957 issue. The poem described Italian soldiers as flamboyant prostitutes. In Ciardi&#x27;s biography, Cifelli quotes several lines from the poem indicating that the soldiers were &quot;all the brilliance of male panache&quot;, and &quot;picking up extra cash from man and boy&quot;. Ciardi was asked to leave by Italian officials by June 16. Knowing that he could be arrested, he continued to write letters of apology to the government, asking for reprieve. Yet he refused to leave, as he was not scheduled to depart till later on in the summer.

Ciardi did not fare well in the counterculture of the late 1960s and 1970s. He had been a fresh, sometimes brash, voice for modern poetry, but as he approached his fiftieth birthday in 1966, he had become entrenched and his voice became bitter, sometimes bumptious. He urged his only remaining students, those at Bread Loaf for two weeks each August, to learn how to write within the tradition before abandoning it in favor of undisciplined, improvisational free verse. Ciardi was unceremoniously fired from Bread Loaf in 1972, after serving seventeen years as director, and not having missed a single year on the poetry staff since 1947.

Over the past quarter century, John Ciardi has come to be regarded as a mid-level, mid-century formalist, one who was replaced in literary history by the more daring and colorful Beat, Confessional, and Black Mountain poets. However, with revisionism chipping away at the reputations of the latter groups, and the brief emergence of a renewed interest in formalism in the late 20th century, Ciardi&#x27;s type of mostly understated verse enjoyed a small resurgence in popularity, one that has passed as the interest in formalism proved shallow and short lived.

In recognition of Ciardi&#x27;s work, a John Ciardi Lifetime Achievement Award for Poetry is given annually to an Italian American poet for lifetime achievement in poetry.

National Public Radio (NPR) continues to make Ciardi&#x27;s commentaries available. Etymologies and commentary on words such as daisy, demijohn, jimmies, gerrymander, glitch, snafu, cretin, and baseball, among others, are available from the archives of their website. NPR also began making his commentaries available as podcasts, starting in November 2005.

==Awards==
&quot;In 1956, Ciardi received the Prix de Rome from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In 1982, the National Council of Teachers of English awarded him its award for excellence in children&#x27;s poetry.&quot; He also won American Platform Association&#x27;s Carl Sandburg Award in 1980.

<text>Alistair Maclean Darling, Baron Darling of Roulanish, (28 November 1953 – 30 November 2023) was a British politician who served as Chancellor of the Exchequer under prime minister Gordon Brown from 2007 to 2010. A member of the Labour Party, he was a member of Parliament (MP) from 1987 to 2015, representing Edinburgh Central and Edinburgh South West.

Darling was first appointed chief secretary to the Treasury by prime minister Tony Blair in 1997, and was promoted to secretary of state for work and pensions in 1998. After spending four years at that department, he spent a further four years as secretary of state for transport, while also becoming secretary of state for Scotland in 2003. Blair moved Darling for a final time in 2006, making him president of the Board of Trade and secretary of state for trade and industry. After Brown succeeded Blair as prime minister, he promoted Darling to replace himself as chancellor of the Exchequer in 2007, a position he remained in until 2010. He served as chancellor during the 2008 financial crisis and the Great Recession.

From 2012 to 2014, Darling was the chairman of the Better Together Campaign, a cross-party group that successfully campaigned for Scotland to remain part of the United Kingdom in the 2014 independence referendum. He was a vocal advocate for the Remain campaign for the 2016 European Union membership referendum. In November 2014, Darling announced that he was standing down at the 2015 general election. He was nominated for a life peerage in the 2015 Dissolution Honours and sat in the House of Lords until his retirement in 2020.

According to the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, Darling was &quot;one of the most consequential post-war chancellors in modern British history&quot;.

==Early life==
Alistair Darling was born on 28 November 1953 in Hendon, then part of Middlesex (now London), the son of a civil engineer, Thomas, and his wife, Anna MacLean. He was the great-nephew of Sir William Darling, a Conservative/Unionist Member of Parliament for Edinburgh South (1945–1957) who had served as Lord Provost of Edinburgh during the Second World War. He was educated at Chinthurst School, in Tadworth, Surrey, then in Kirkcaldy, and at the private Loretto School, in Musselburgh. He attended the University of Aberdeen, from where he graduated as a Bachelor of Laws (LLB). He became the president of Aberdeen University Students&#x27; Representative Council.

Darling joined the Labour Party aged 23, in 1977. He became a solicitor in 1978, then changed course for the Scots bar and was admitted as an advocate in 1984. In 1982 he was elected to the Lothian Regional Council, where he supported large rates rises in defiance of Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s rate-capping laws, and even threatened not to set a rate at all. He served on the council until he was elected to the House of Commons.

==Member of Parliament==
Darling first entered Parliament at the 1987 general election in Edinburgh Central, defeating the incumbent Conservative MP, Sir Alexander Fletcher, by 2,262 votes; and remained an Edinburgh MP for 28 years until he stood down in 2015.

Following the creation of the devolved Scottish Parliament, the number of Scottish seats at Westminster was reduced, and the Edinburgh Central constituency he represented was abolished, to be split between constituencies centred on peripheral areas of the city. The Labour government offered a peerage to Lynda Clark, the Advocate General for Scotland, so that Darling could contest the new Edinburgh South West constituency, the main successor to Clark&#x27;s Edinburgh Pentlands constituency. At the 2005 general election, he won the seat. The Labour Party was so concerned that Darling might be defeated that several senior party figures, including deputy prime minister John Prescott and chancellor Gordon Brown, made encouragement trips to the constituency during the campaign. Despite being a senior Cabinet minister, Darling was hardly seen outside the area, as he was making the maximum effort to win his seat. In the event he won it with a majority of 7,242 over the second-placed Conservative candidate, the latter having been held back by the Liberal Democrats coming in a close third. Darling won by a comfortable 16.5% margin on a 65.4% turnout. In 2010, despite Labour&#x27;s defeat nationally, he received an increased majority of 8,447.

===Shadow Cabinet===
As a backbencher he sponsored the Solicitors (Scotland) Act 1988. He soon became an opposition home affairs spokesman in 1988 on the front bench of Neil Kinnock.

Following the 1992 general election, he became a spokesman on Treasury affairs, but was promoted to Tony Blair&#x27;s Shadow Cabinet as the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury in 1996.

==In government==

Following the 1997 general election, he entered Cabinet as the chief secretary to the Treasury. In 1998, he was appointed Secretary of State for Social Security, replacing Harriet Harman who had been dismissed. Following the 2001 general election, the Department of Social Security was abolished and replaced by the new Department for Work and Pensions, which also took employment away from the education portfolio. Darling fronted the new department until 2002 when he was moved to the Department for Transport, after his predecessor Stephen Byers resigned.

===Secretary of State for Transport===
Darling was given a brief to &quot;take the department out of the headlines&quot;. He oversaw the creation of Network Rail, the successor to Railtrack, which had collapsed in controversial circumstances for which his predecessor was largely blamed. He also procured the passage of the legislation – the Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003 – which abolished the Rail Regulator and replaced the post with the Office of Rail Regulation. He was responsible for the Railways Act 2005 which abolished the Strategic Rail Authority, a creation of the Labour government under the Transport Act 2000. Darling was also responsible for the cancellation of several major light rail schemes, including a major extension to Manchester Metrolink (later reversed) and the proposed Leeds Supertram, citing rising costs of £620million and £486 million respectively.

Darling gave the government&#x27;s support to the Crossrail scheme for an east–west rail line under London, whose £10 billion projected cost later rose to £15 billion.

Although he was not at the Department for Transport at the time of the collapse of Railtrack, Darling vigorously defended what had been done in a speech to the House of Commons on 24 October 2005. This included threats that had been made to the independent Rail Regulator that if he intervened to defend the company against the government&#x27;s attempts to force it into railway administration – a special status for insolvent railway companies – the government would introduce emergency legislation to take the regulator under direct political control.

===Secretary of State for Scotland===
In 2003, when the Scotland Office was folded into the Department for Constitutional Affairs, he was appointed Secretary of State for Scotland in combination with his Transport portfolio.

===Secretary of State for Trade and Industry===
In the Cabinet reshuffle of May 2006, he was moved to be Secretary of State for Trade and Industry; Douglas Alexander replaced him as both Secretary of State for Transport and Secretary of State for Scotland. On 10 November 2006 in a mini-reshuffle, Malcolm Wicks, the Minister for Energy at the Department of Trade and Industry, and thus one of Darling&#x27;s junior ministers, was appointed Minister for Science while Darling took over day-to-day control of the Energy portfolio.

===Chancellor of the Exchequer===
On 28 June 2007, the new prime minister and former chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown promoted Darling to replace himself as chancellor, a promotion widely anticipated in the media. Journalists observed that three of Darling&#x27;s four junior ministers at the Treasury (Angela Eagle, Jane Kennedy and Kitty Ussher) were female, and dubbed his team &quot;Darling&#x27;s Darlings&quot;.

In September 2007, for the first time since 1860, there was a run on a British bank, Northern Rock. Although the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority have jurisdiction in such cases, ultimate authority for deciding on financial support for a bank in exceptional circumstances rests with the chancellor. The 2007 subprime mortgage crisis had caused a liquidity crisis in the UK banking industry, and Northern Rock was unable to borrow as required by its business model. Darling authorised the Bank of England to lend Northern Rock funds to cover its liabilities and provided an unqualified taxpayers&#x27; guarantee of the deposits of savers in Northern Rock to try to stop the run. Northern Rock borrowed up to £20 billion from the Bank of England, and Darling was criticised for becoming sucked into a position where so much public money was tied up in a private company.

In March 2008, Darling&#x27;s budget was criticised in a media campaign spread by a social networking site. Amid anger at the rise in alcohol duties, James Hughes, a landlord in Edinburgh (where Darling&#x27;s constituency was based) symbolically barred Darling from his pub, and a passing reporter from the &quot;Edinburgh Evening News&quot; ran the story. A Facebook group was created, leading dozens of pubs across Britain to follow Hughes, barring Darling from their pubs. The story was eventually picked up by most national press and broadcast media in Britain, and David Cameron, Leader of the Opposition at the time, cited the movement at Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions on 26 March.

==== Budgets ====
On 12 March 2008, Darling gave his first budget in the House of Commons.

On 22 April 2009, Darling delivered his second budget speech in the House of Commons. To stimulate the motor industry, a £2,000 allowance was announced for a car more than 10 years old, if it was traded in for a new car. A 50% tax band was announced for earners of over £150,000 to start the following tax year.

Darling also announced that personal allowance would be tapered down by £1 for every £2 earned above £100,000 until it reached zero which resulted in an anomalous effective marginal tax rate of 60% above £100,000, with the marginal tax rate returning to 40% for incomes above £112,950.

Gordon Brown confirmed on 10 March 2010 that Darling would deliver his final third budget before the general election, which was delivered on 24 March 2010.

====Child benefit data scandal====

Darling was Chancellor of the Exchequer when the confidential personal details of over 25million British citizens went missing while being sent from his department to the National Audit Office. A former Scotland Yard detective stated that with the current rate of £2.50 per person&#x27;s details this data could have been sold for £60,000,000. The acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, Vince Cable, put the value at £1.5 billion, or £60 per identity.

====Storm warning====
In an interview in &quot;The Guardian&quot; published 30 August 2008, Darling warned, &quot;The economic times we are facing ... are arguably the worst they&#x27;ve been in 60 years. And I think it&#x27;s going to be more profound and long-lasting than people thought.&quot; His blunt warning led to confusion within the Labour Party. However, Darling insisted that it was his duty to be &quot;straight&quot; with people.

In October 2008 the government bailed out the Royal Bank of Scotland as part of the 2008 bank rescue package; Darling said in 2018 that the country was hours away from a breakdown of law and order if the bank had not been bailed out.

====10% income tax band====
Darling&#x27;s predecessor, Gordon Brown, just before he became prime minister, had abolished the 10% starting rate on income tax and reduced the basic rate of income tax from 22% to 20% in his final budget on 21 March 2007; this was to come into effect in the tax year starting 6 April 2008. This was not amended in Darling&#x27;s 2008 budget. Although the majority of taxpayers would be marginally better off as a result of these changes, around 5,100,000 low earners (including those earning less than £18,000 annually) would have been worse off. On 18 October 2007, the Treasury released statistics which established that childless people on low incomes could lose up to £200 a year as a result of the changes, while parents and those earning more than £20,000 would gain money.

Increasing political backlash about the additional tax burden for some put immense pressure onto the government; including Darling with Brown facing criticism from his own Parliamentary Labour Party.
In May 2008 Darling announced he would help low-paid workers hit by the scrapping of the 10p rate, by raising that year&#x27;s personal tax allowance by £600 funded by borrowing an extra £2.7 billion.

====Stimulus spending====
To boost falling demand, the government announced an additional £20 billion spending package. Subsequently, Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, warned the government against further stimulus spending, due to insecure public finances.

==Later activities==
Following the defeat of the Labour Party at the 2010 general election, Darling announced that he intended to leave frontbench politics. He endorsed David Miliband to succeed Brown as Leader of the Labour Party in the 2010 leadership election.

On 17 May 2010, it was reported that he stated: &quot;It has been an honour and a tremendous privilege but I believe it is time for me to return to the backbenches from where I shall look after, with great pride, the constituents of Edinburgh South West.&quot; Darling suggested on 7 September 2010 on &quot;Daily Politics&quot; that he was intending only to take a &quot;year out&quot; and might possibly reconsider his future. 

===Expenses claims===
In May 2009, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that Darling changed the designation of his second home four times in four years, allowing him to claim for the costs of his family home in Edinburgh, and to buy and furnish a flat in London including the cost of stamp duty and other legal fees. Darling said that &quot;the claims were made within House of Commons rules&quot;.

Nick Clegg, Leader of the Liberal Democrats, criticised him by saying: &quot;given that very unique responsibility that [Darling] has [as Chancellor], it&#x27;s simply impossible for him to continue in that role when such very major question marks are being raised about his financial affairs&quot;. A former Scottish Labour chairman and treasurer described Darling&#x27;s position as &quot;untenable&quot; and said that &quot;[Darling] certainly shouldn&#x27;t be in the Cabinet&quot;.

On 1 June 2009, Darling apologised &quot;unreservedly&quot; about a mistaken claim for £700, which he had agreed to repay. He was supported by the Prime Minister, who referred to the incident as an inadvertent mistake.

In 2010, he resigned from the Faculty of Advocates as they were investigating a complaint about his expenses claims. Darling denied any connection between the two events.

===Better Together campaign===
Darling was the chairman and one of the directors of the Better Together campaign, which campaigned for a &quot;No&quot; vote in the 2014 referendum on Scottish independence. He was involved in the campaign&#x27;s launch in June 2012, delivered a speech on the subject in the annual John P Mackintosh lecture in November 2012, and addressed a fringe meeting at the Scottish Conservative Conference in June 2013. In August 2014, Darling took part in &quot;Salmond &amp; Darling: The Debate&quot; and &quot;Scotland Decides: Salmond versus Darling&quot;, televised debates with first minister Alex Salmond on the pros and cons of Scottish Independence.

Darling was criticised by some Scottish Labour MPs and supporters who believed that working with Conservatives on the Better Together campaign might damage Labour&#x27;s prospects in Scotland. At the 2015 general election, Labour lost all but one of their seats in Scotland to the SNP, with swings of over 30% in several seats, including a UK record swing of 39.3% against Labour in Glasgow North East. Labour also lost Darling&#x27;s former constituency to Joanna Cherry of the SNP.

=== House of Lords ===
Darling was nominated for a life peerage in the 2015 Dissolution Honours, becoming &quot;Baron Darling of Roulanish, of Great Bernera in the County of Ross and Cromarty&quot; on 1 December 2015. He was introduced to the House of Lords on 10 December 2015. Darling retired from the Lords on 28 July 2020, citing distance and the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Personal life, illness and death==
Darling had a brief previous marriage when young, but was married to former journalist Margaret McQueen Vaughan from 1986 until his death; the couple had a son and a daughter. Margaret Vaughan worked for Radio Forth, the &quot;Daily Record&quot; and Glasgow &quot;Herald&quot; until Labour&#x27;s election victory in 1997. Darling admitted to smoking cannabis in his youth. He enjoyed listening to Pink Floyd, Coldplay, Leonard Cohen and the Killers.

Darling suffered from cancer and died at Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, on 30 November 2023, at the age of 70. There were widespread tributes from politicians from different political parties. Former prime minister Gordon Brown praised his &quot;integrity&quot; and &quot;wise judgement&quot;. A memorial service for Darling at St Mary&#x27;s Episcopal Cathedral in Edinburgh the following month was attended by many present and former political leaders, including Sir Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, George Osborne, Humza Yousaf and Sir Keir Starmer. Future Labour Chancellor Rachel Reeves also paid tribute, saying that Darling had been a mentor to her.

<text>The following list focuses on the routes taken by trains traveling on railway lines in the [[Netherlands]]. A list including all the stops on the train routes can be found at Dutch railway services.

==Train number series==
Below are the train routes in the Netherlands as of 2011 (may be outdated) with the number of the training series. The series number is typically a multiple of 100, followed by a number between 1 and 99 (where odd numbers are for trains in one direction and even numbers are for trains in the other, except for some international services). These numbers should not be confused with the numbers of locomotives, railcars, or train sets, or with the table numbers of railway lines in the &quot;Spoorboekje&quot;.

For details of these types of train service, and for listings of more stations on the routes, see Dutch railway services.

===Abbreviations===
==Train routes with reversal of direction==

Train routes with reversal of direction on the way (all with multiple units or push-pull trains), with the station:

*3000, 3100 Arnhem
*500, 1700, 2000, 2800, 11700 Utrecht

<doc id="352661" wikidata="Q176542" url="?curid=352661" title="OhmyNews">
<text>OhmyNews () is a South Korean online news website. It was founded by Oh Yeon Ho on 22 February 2000.

The site&#x27;s motto is &quot;Every Citizen is a Reporter&quot;, which reflects its status as the first news website in Korea to accept, edit, and publish articles from its readers in an open source-style. About 20% of the site&#x27;s content is written by the 55-person staff; most articles are written by freelance contributors.

==Political position==
&quot;OhmyNews&quot; is consistently considered liberal and progressive. This is in contrast to the somewhat more moderate liberal Hankyoreh and Kyunghyang.

It is also considered anti-imperialist, anti-racist, and anti-xenophobic. However, anti-China/anti-Japan government left-wing nationalist media is common among South Korean liberals. The site is also generally critical of the &#x27;hegemonic nationalism&#x27; of the Chinese and Japanese governments, and supports &#x27;resistance nationalism&#x27;. The site strongly criticizes and opposes anti-Japanese and anti-Chinese sentiment that is expressed as racism rather than anti-imperialism. &quot;OhmyNews&quot; is not anti-American, but often criticizes U.S. foreign policy.

It opposes improving Japan-South Korea relations and is particularly negative about cooperation in the military sector. In 2022, an article on &quot;OhmyNews&quot; criticized the U.S. effort to improve Japan-South Korea relations to counter China as sacrificing South Korea.

==History==
&quot;OhmyNews&quot; was influential in determining the outcome of the 2002 South Korean presidential election. After being elected, President Roh Moo-hyun granted his first interview to &quot;OhmyNews&quot;.

&quot;OhmyNews International&quot; is an English language online newspaper that features &quot;citizen reporter&quot; articles written by contributors from all over the globe. Its content is almost 100% citizen reporter.

On 22 February 2006, &quot;OhmyNews&quot; and Japanese firm Softbank signed an investment contract valued at US$11 million. In 2006 &quot;OhmyNews&quot; started to build a Japan-based citizen-participatory journalism site called &quot;OhmyNews Japan&quot;, launched on 28 August with a famous Japanese journalist and 22 other employees working under ten reporters. These journalists&#x27; articles were the object of much criticism; on 17 November 2006, the newspaper ended the citizen-participation aspect of the paper. The South Korean newspaper admitted that &quot;OhmyNews Japan&quot; had failed. In July 2008, all staff of OhmyNews Japan were dismissed, and by the end of August operations had ceased on the site.

The 2nd Citizen Reporters&#x27; Forum was held by &quot;OhmyNews&quot; in Seoul, Korea from 12–15 July 2006.

&quot;Curators are important to our operation. They are given a great deal of trust. In order to maintain credibility amongst our team members, new curators join through recommendations of existing curators. And even amongst the curators we have different levels depending on their experience and contributions. This is to maintain a steady level of quality and credibility with our readers.&quot;

During the declaration of martial law in 2024, an &quot;OhmyNews&quot; live stream captured Democratic Party deputy spokesperson Ahn Gwi-ryeong confronting a soldier with a rifle, which was seen by millions on X (formerly twitter).

===Financing===
&quot;OhmyNews&quot; is losing original features as alternative–independent media in financial independence. Oh Yeon-ho said, &quot;70 to 80 percent of our revenue came from corporate advertising and sponsorships. In contrast, contributions from readers only totaled five percent of total revenue.&quot; Oh also said, &quot;We have not received a cent from Lee Myung-bak government for central government advertising.&quot; However a government report to National Assembly in 2009 revealed that &quot;OhmyNews&quot; received 120 million won (approximately 100,000 dollars) for government advertising from February 2008 to July 2009. An &quot;OhmyNews&quot; report also indicated that they had received about 870 million won (approximately 900,000 dollars) for government advertising from 2003 to 2007 by introducing government official reports to National Assembly.

An alternative medium Pressian reported Oh&#x27;s comments, &quot;I respect Samsung as major business partner,&quot; and introduced about 20 percent of the total advertising and cooperation revenue of &quot;OhmyNews&quot; is coming from Samsung for years, the biggest business corporate of Korea.

On 8 July 2009, Oh Yeon-ho revealed that &quot;OhmyNews&quot; was losing up to 700 million won yearly, and appealed to website users to join a voluntary subscription scheme.

==&quot;OhmyNews International&quot;==
In September 2010, &quot;OhmyNews International&quot; changed its format from citizen journalism to becoming a forum about citizen journalism. Verifying facts from around the world became too difficult. The old site is an archive and does not accept new articles.

<doc id="352662" wikidata="Q1168124" url="?curid=352662" title="Platon Lebedev">
<text>Platon Leonidovich Lebedev (Russian: Плато́н Леони́дович Ле́бедев; born 29 November 1956) is a Russian businessman and former CEO of Group Menatep. He was convicted of tax evasion, money laundering and embezzlement by Russian courts in two cases and imprisoned from July 2003 to January 2014. He is best known as a close associate of Mikhail Khodorkovsky.

==Early life==
Platon Lebedev graduated from the Academy of National Economy Plekhanov in Moscow in 1981. After graduating he worked in the Foreign Trade Department &quot;Zarubezhgeologia&quot; (Russian: Зарубежгеология) of the Soviet Ministry of Geology until 1989. There he met Leonid Nevzlin who subsequently introduced him to Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Between 1989 and 1992, Lebedev headed the currency and finance department of Khodorkovsky&#x27;s Bank Menatep and became president and a member of the board in 1993. He was president until 1995. Since 1996 he sat on the board of oil company Yukos. Lebedev was CEO of Group Menatep Ltd. (principal shareholder of YUKOS) from 2002 until his arrest in July 2003.

Since 1997, Lebedev holds a stake of about 7 percent in Group Menatep Limited, now GML Limited. Holding company GML Limited controls 51% of Yukos shares. The other four ultimate beneficial owners of GML Limited are Leonid Nevzlin, Mikhail Brudno, Vladimir Dubov and Vasily Shakhnovsky.

==Conviction and imprisonment==
On 2 July 2003, Lebedev, then chairman of the board of Menatep, was summoned as a witness to the Prosecutor General&#x27;s Office in an investigation into embezzlement of state funds. Shortly before the scheduled visit, Lebedev however felt ill at about 5 a.m. and was taken to a hospital. Lebedev then subsequently was arrested in the hospital on suspicion of stealing a 20% stake in JSC Apatit.

On 31 May 2005, Lebedev was convicted of tax evasion in 2005, and sentenced to nine years in prison. He was subsequently charged with embezzlement and money laundering in 2009, and pleaded not guilty to the charges. There has been speculation that these charges were politically motivated.

On 27 December 2010, Lebedev and Mikhail Khodorkovsky were each sentenced to 13 years in prison for money laundering and embezzlement. In the second case against them, they were found guilty of organizing a criminal group in the oil business, embezzling 218 million tonnes of oil from Yukos&#x27; oil extraction subsidiary companies, Uganskneftegaz, Tomskneft and Samaraneftegaz.

In December 2013 Khodorkovsky was released while Lebedev was released on 24 January 2014. &quot;A short prison sentence might be considered a victory for Mr. Putin&#x27;s protégé, President Dmitry A. Medvedev, a former law professor who is thought of as less of a hard-liner. Mr. Medvedev has been promoting policies to modernize Russia, and analysts say the Khodorkovsky case is an obstacle toward convincing foreign investors that the country&#x27;s legal system is fair.&quot;

On 24 May 2011, Lebedev and Khodorkovsky were named prisoners of conscience by Amnesty International, which criticized the men&#x27;s second trial and called for their release on the expiry of their initial sentences.

On 7 August 2012, Lebedev&#x27;s 13-year sentence was reduced by 3 years and 4 months by a district court judge in the Arkhangelsk region city of Velsk, where Lebedev had been imprisoned. This action came as a result of the prosecutor&#x27;s office requesting a re-qualification of Lebedev&#x27;s offenses due to the passage of a new legal statute in the Russian Criminal Code which reduced the punishment for offenses of which he had been convicted.

On 25 October 2013, the Berlin International Literature Festival held a worldwide reading in solidarity with Platon Lebedev and all criminals who allege they are political prisoners in Russia.

==Release==
On 23 January 2014, the Russian Supreme Court reduced Lebedev&#x27;s sentence and ordered his release from prison. But Supreme Court Judge Pyotr Serkov did not change a court order under which Lebedev and Khodorkovsky had to pay 17bn roubles ($500m; £300m) in tax arrears. Immediately after his release, Lebedev said in an interview with Ren TV that he intended to resume business.

In February 2015, Lebedev announced his first press conference after his release from prison in Moscow on 18 February 2015.
